  Dan Puts Down a Bore</b></h2>
<p>A loud laugh went up that was  heard all over the district when Dan turned up one morning in possession of a  boring plant, and asked for a job. And when the humorous aspect of it wore off  everyone fell to wondering how on earth Dan came by so costly an asset; and  some expressed the opinion that his title to it would hardly hold good in a  court of law. Hitherto, Dan was never known to possess more than a wife and  family and what he stood up in; and what Dan usually stood up in would scarcely  finance him into a boring plant.</p>
<p>But Dan was no ordinary man, and  his ideas of finance were not those of the average person. The man was never  known who could get out of difficulties more easily than Dan, and the man was  never born who could get into difficulties as easily as Dan! In fact, Dan&rsquo;s  whole career was one long succession of difficulties, mostly financial. And he  generally contrived to come through with scarcely a scratch. This time he came  through with a boring plant. But how or why, nobody seemed to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; McCarthy answered, with a  broad smile, when Dan stopped the puffing traction before his door, and  inquired if he wanted water found on his farm; &ldquo;I want warter arright, but&rdquo; &mdash;he  paused and smiled again&mdash;&ldquo;can you do the boring, Dan? That&rsquo;s the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, what th&rsquo; devil do you  think I&rsquo;m cartin&rsquo; this about th&rsquo; country for?&rdquo; And Dan indignantly waved his  long, brown arm over the plant, which consisted of the engine, the boring  apparatus, and a dilapidated spring-cart that was pulled along by a lean,  lonely-looking horse harnessed to it with wire and scraps of rope and binding  twine. &ldquo;You give me twelve bob a foot, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll bloomin&rsquo; quick show you whether  I can bore or not. Give me twelve bob, and I&rsquo;ll put a hole down in any part of  yer ground for y&rsquo; deep enough to hold your overdraft in.</p>
<p>Mrs. McCarthy, and Mary Ann  McCarthy, and Julia Catherine McCarthy came out of the house like the occupants  leaving Noah&rsquo;s Ark, and stared and gaped at Dan&rsquo;s machinery, and were instantly  followed by quite a small regiment of younger McCarthys, who made an excited  raid on the plant, and climbed all over it like monkeys, and scrutinised it  closely.</p>
<p>McCarthy, who rarely ever knew his  own mind, &ldquo;hummed and hahed&rdquo; for quite a while, and finally mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I dunno; p&rsquo;rraps some  other time, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps&rsquo;! I know all about  your &lsquo;p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps,&rsquo; Mac!&rdquo; Dan sneered impudently. &ldquo;That means y&rsquo; don&rsquo;t want it done  at all; or yer can&rsquo;t afford to pay for it, only y&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t game to say it straight  out. Any way. Look out!&rdquo; Dan swept more than half the young McCarthys from the  plant with his long arm, like a horse whisking flies from him with his tail.</p>
<p>McCarthy grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the sort of cove, Mac,&rdquo;  Dan added, &ldquo;what always votes against the Labour Party, because yer reckon they  wants to tax yer bloomin&rsquo; improvements. Why, if they was to come along here  termorrer, y&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t give them a drink of water if they was dyin&rsquo; for one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>McCarthy grinned some more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! I&rsquo;m only wastin&rsquo; me time  an&rsquo; talents here!&rdquo; And Dan swept the remainder of the young McCarthys from his  plant.</p>
<p>Dan carried a competent  engine-driver on board, but to display his own professional abilities to the  spectators, pulled the lever himself and started the rumbling traction. (He had  learned how to pull the lever while travelling the road that morning.) Then  when she was moving he allowed the driver to take charge, and waved his hat in  derision to the staring family.</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make for old Skinnerlouse&rsquo;s,&rdquo;  were Dan&rsquo;s directions to his driver, &ldquo;an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll see if we can knock anything  out of <i>him!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skinnerlouse was the oldest and  wealthiest inhabitant&mdash;and the meanest. And when Dan&rsquo;s plant came puffing into  his farmyard, he hurried out and stood staring and scratching his head. And  when he saw the engine tear down a gate-post to make room for itself to get in,  he jumped several feet in the air, and yelled and blasphemed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang you, and your boring plant!&rdquo;  he shouted, when Dan proceeded to solicit business, &ldquo;Who gave you authority to  bring it into my yard? Take it away&mdash;the heap of rubbish! Be off with it,  fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reception was not quite so  friendly as Dan had expected, as he would have wished; still Dan knew it was  necessary to put up with a lot when one was in business. He promptly humbled himself  before the man of money with studied servility. He submitted without a word of  remonstrance to Skinnerlouse away his character, and the character of his  relations and ancestors. Indeed, Dan approved of many of the vile epithets that  Skinnerlouse applied to his relations, and murmured meekly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t deny what y&rsquo; say, Mister  Skinnerlouse; they&rsquo;re a rotten lot some of &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve always said so meself;  but that&rsquo;s no fault o&rsquo; mine, is it? You would hardly blame me on their  account?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blame you!&rdquo; Skinerlouse yelled.  &ldquo;Of course I blame you!&rdquo; And for a good quarter-hour he lashed himself into  frenzy and foam, telling Dan just what a useless loafer he reckoned he was, and  luridly prophesied that his future would be all spent in languishing behind the  walls of the goal. </p>
<p>Dan smiled at the word picture of  himself, and got right to business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; he said humbly, &ldquo;a  man like y&rsquo;self, Mr. Skinerlouse, who&rsquo;s at the head o&rsquo; everythin&rsquo; going on in  th&rsquo; distric&rsquo;, ought, y&rsquo; know, to encourage a chap when he&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; a move on,  an&rsquo; showin&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; push an&rsquo; industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blast your push an&rsquo; industry!&rdquo;  the old man snorted. &ldquo;To th&rsquo; devil with y&rsquo;! Do you call knocking down a man&rsquo;s  gatepost like that&rdquo;&mdash;pointing with his finger to the ruin&mdash;&ldquo;push and industry? Do  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan meekly apologised for the  accident, and promised to repair the damage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you don&rsquo;t go out of here  till you do. Not one foot . . . if I have to send for the police!&rdquo; Skinnerlouse  roared, and started to walk away.</p>
<p>But Dan trotted after him. Dan was  a hard man to shake off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but won&rsquo;t y&rsquo; have a bore  put down, though, Mr. Skinnerlouse?&rdquo; he pleaded meekly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll pay y&rsquo; well, y&rsquo;  know, to have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to th&rsquo; devil, and put down a  bore in your own place!&rdquo; the other snapped, without turning his head.</p>
<p>But Dan kept at his side, and  answered;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I would, sir, quick enough,  but I haven&rsquo;t got a place o&rsquo; me own, yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s bally near time you  had! Go off with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope I will have one very  soon, now,&rdquo; was Dan&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;When I get goin&rsquo; properly, which won&rsquo;t be long, I  hope, for&mdash;for&mdash;er&mdash;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;er&mdash;left the Labour party, Mr. Skinnerlouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve what?&rdquo; And old  Skinnerlouse stopped suddenly, and looked Dan square in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! left the Party for  ever,&rdquo; Dan repeated with steady emphasis; and added: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t vote that ticket  no more, Mr. Skinnerlouse. I&rsquo;m after a bit o&rsquo; land now; an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re no good to  me with their bloomin&rsquo; tax on a chap&rsquo;s thrift an&rsquo; his little &rsquo;ome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s taken you a blamed long time  to find it out!&rdquo; Skinnerlouse grunted, and moved on again.</p>
<p>Still Dan clung courageously to  him. &ldquo;Well, will y&rsquo; make up yer mind to have one put down here, in th&rsquo; yard,  Mr. Skinnerlouse?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Or&mdash;er&mdash;anywhere here would be a good place to  get water, sir, an&rsquo; now&rsquo;s yer time while the plant&rsquo;s idle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skinnerlouse ignored him, and  walked faster, at the same time waving his hand at a boy in his employ, and  commanding him in bad language to drive some calves from the lucerne.</p>
<p>Dan lost hope. He spat viciously,  and was just in the act of telling Skinnerlouse to go to a place, the name of  which shall be kept secret, when that individual suddenly stopped again and  faced him. There was a changed look in his grizzled countenance. Roguery was in  his eye. He smiled, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, look here! What&rsquo;s the  cheapest you will deepen that well there for?&rdquo; and he pointed to a cranky old  windlass surrounded by a mass of gravel and blue-metal boulders.</p>
<p>Dan smiled, and striding across to  the well, removed some of the rude covering and looked down it.</p>
<p>It was an old warrior of a hole  about sixty feet deep, that had broken the hearts of numerous gangs of  well-sinkers, all of whom abandoned it with seared souls and evil thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve shilings a foot,&rdquo; Dan  said, straightening himself up.</p>
<p>Skinerlouse reflected for a  moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. But  I&rsquo;ll give you nothing for the first five feet, and twelve and six for every  foot after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Dan&rsquo;s turn to reflect. He  took his full time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve an&rsquo; six . . after the first  five feet,&rdquo; he soliloquised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you can take it or leave  it,&rdquo; Skinnerlouse jerked out.</p>
<p>Dan thought he saw his way to make  it pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orright, then, Mr. Skinerlouse,&rdquo;  he replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it at that an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll start an&rsquo; bump the bottom out of her  for yer, right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bargain, then, and the  money&rsquo;s there for you when you&rsquo;re finished.&rdquo; And Skinerlouse, with a pleased  smile on his hard face, went inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fool will be there till he&rsquo;s  grey-headed, and never get down five feet in that rock!&rdquo; he said to his wife.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dan and his  engine-driver set the plant in position and commenced operations on the well.  The engine-driver manipulated the drill, while Dan at intervals carted water,  with the dejected horse to the engine. At longer intervals he mooched about  with his hands behind his back, smoking tranquily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bump! bump! thump! thump!&rdquo; the drill  echoed in monotonous regularity until night, and proceeded long into the night.  Early next morning it commenced again, and went right ahead, taking no  interval for breakfast.</p>
<p>About noon old Skinnerlouse came  along, and with a nasty grin asked Dan if he had struck water yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re only  down a couple o&rsquo; feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skinnerlouse went away pleased. He  was barely out of earshot when the man at the drill gave a jump, and called  out: &ldquo;Water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan staggered as if he had been  hit behind the ear with one of the blue-metal boulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gam! .. No?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Sure as I&rsquo;m livin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the aid of a piece of mirror  they both examined the hole. Water there was, and coming in abundance. It was  starting to flood the floor of the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nark!&rdquo; the engine-driver  said, with a pathetic look at his employer. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you do, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A serious look was in Dan&rsquo;s eye.  It was clear he fully realised the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing to do,&rdquo; he  said quickly. &ldquo;Lower me down, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll plug her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rushed round and secured a  wooden peg, that was made to fit the bore-hole. Then the engine-driver  half-lowered, half-dropped Dan into the well. Dan plugged that hole in quick  time, and came to the top in wet boots, and nervously looked about to see if  old Skinerlouse was near. But Skinnerlouse was half a mile off abusing one of  his ploughmen for knocking a horse down with a spade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pack up now, and be ready  to pull out whenever he comes along,&rdquo; Dan said.</p>
<p>Dan would have made a great leader  of a fusion party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw anything like it,&rdquo;  the engine-driver remarked concernedly. &ldquo;Fancy getting water, and giving it to  that old vagabond for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t got it for nothing yet,&rdquo;  Dan said sternly. &ldquo;You wait a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though born in Australia and by  Scotch parents, Dan was a real Englishman. He never knew when he was beaten. He  hadn&rsquo;t the sense to know.</p>
<p>They &ldquo;waited a bit&rdquo;&mdash;hung idly  round the plant for about two hours, smoking and waiting for Skinnerlouse to  show up.</p>
<p>He showed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan drew himself to full height,  and hitched his pants several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;er,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  think we&rsquo;d ever find water there, Mr. Skinnerlouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you fool,&rdquo; Skinnerlouse  laughed, &ldquo;I could have told you that before you started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never like to be beat,&rdquo;  Dan said modestly, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do if yer like, Mr.  Skinnerlouse.&rdquo; (Skinnerlouse turned his ear sharply, and listened like a  cunning old cockatoo.) &ldquo;If you let me divine a place myself, I&rsquo;ll guarantee to  find you a good supply for &pound;50, and no money if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty pounds for a good supply,  and nothing if you fail; that is to say, no water, no money?&rdquo; Skinnerlouse  said.</p>
<p>Dan nodded assent.</p>
<p>Skinnerlouse thought he had  precipitated a good joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away, then,&rdquo; he chuckled;  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not often fellows come round here putting down bores for the good of  their health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan produced his divining rod&mdash;a  piece of forked willow tree&mdash;and taking a firm grip of it with both hands, went  off &ldquo;merry-widowing&rdquo; round Skinnerlouse&rsquo;s yard. The rod dragged him right back  to the well, where it doubled him like a bullock-bow and threatened to pin him  to the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; Dan said.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a crick runnin&rsquo; strong under here, and the well just missed it by a  couple o&rsquo; feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skinnerlouse ran away, laughing  hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who said it would be a  big saving to the country to build asylums to put sensible people into, and let  the others about outside, was a wise man,&rdquo; he remarked to his wife.</p>
<p>Dan and the engine-driver set the  plant again, and recommenced operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll cover this well over  better than it is,&rdquo; Dan said with a grin, &ldquo;in case someone falls down it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan was a careful workman where  human life was concerned.</p>
<p>Then, while the driver turned the drill,  Dan heaped all the heavy timber he could see about on the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a burglar could get into it  now,&rdquo; he said, and filling his pipe with the engine-driver&rsquo;s tobacco, sat down  and smoked peacefully, and at intervals hummed snatches of &ldquo;Abide with Me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For about a week Dan&rsquo;s boring  plant could be heard bumping continuously at Skinnerlouse&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Then one day it suddenly ceased,  and a commotion set in that attracted the whole of that end of the district.  The engine whistled with all its might; Dan &ldquo;hurrayed,&rdquo; and kicked his hat up  and down the yard; Skinnerlouse&rsquo;s dogs barked and howled; his turkeys&mdash;and he  had hundreds of them&mdash;gobbled; Skinnerlouse, himself, and his two sons, and his  farm-hands came running from different parts of the estate, and shared in the  excitement. Dan McSmith, ploughing on his little eighty acre allotment, stopped  his team to shout to his wife, who was in the cornfield, that &ldquo;Dan had struck  water for old Skinerlouse.&rdquo; And Barney O&rsquo;Brown, who despised Skinnerlouse,  scowled at the horizon upon hearing the jubilating, and said: &ldquo;Just imagine the  old devil finding water on that stony ridge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand gallons a hour!&rdquo; Dan  exclaimed, after testing the supply. &ldquo;An&rsquo; struck it at sixty feet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s a thousand gallons?&rdquo;  Skinnerlouse asked excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; Dan said.</p>
<p>Skinerlouse ran off, and returned  with a bottle of whisky and a glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help yourselves,&rdquo; he said  recklessly.</p>
<p>Dan and the engine-driver helped  themselves, and Dan mixed some of the newly-found water with his, just to prove  its bona-fides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And darn good water it is, too,&rdquo;  Dan said, smacking his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand gallons an hour!&rdquo;  repeated old Skinnerlouse. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s worth as many pounds to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was always a lucky dorg, Mr.  Skinnerlouse,&rdquo; Dan said, in a complimentary sort of way.</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * * *</p>
<p>Skinnerlouse laughed pleasantly,  and paid Dan fifty pounds. Dan pocketed the cheque, and hurried his plant off  the premises.</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * * *</p>
<p>Two years after. Old  Skinnerlouse&rsquo;s sons one day uncovered the well, and one was lowered to the  bottom in search of some missing tools. The plug that Dan had placed in the  bore-hole attracted his attention. He removed it; then shouted wildly to be  hauled up. Young Skinnerlouse couldn&rsquo;t swim, and when he reached the top he was  pale and wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, th&rsquo;&mdash;scoundrel! Th&rsquo;&mdash;th&rsquo;&mdash;daylight  robber!&rdquo; old Skinnerlouse yelled, when he realised how matters were at the  bottom of the well. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered. Then getting back his full  voice, bellowed: &ldquo;<i>Get me my horse!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found Dan, at home, on the  broad of his back, with his boots off, singing songs diluted with fag ends of  &ldquo;Abide with Me&rdquo; to the baby, while his wife was out cutting wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call yourself a <i>man?</i>&rdquo; Skinnerlouse howled, when Dan  appeared at the door in answer to his call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dan replied with a grin,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hardly be able to pass meself off as a <i>woman!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be much uset him  tryin&rsquo;, either, if y&rsquo; arsts me,&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s wife said, appearing at the moment with  a load of wood in her arms, and large drops of perspiration on her brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a robber!&rdquo; Skinnerlouse  shouted in his fury. &ldquo;A bare-faced robber!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan calmly stroked his long black  beard, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did yer find thet out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not twenty minutes ago, when my  son went down that well, you low skunk!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went down what well?&rdquo; inquired  Dan, with an innocent twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pretend you don&rsquo;t know,  man&mdash;the well you plugged, you scoundrel, and took my money for doing it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Dan was lost for a  reply.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dan dropped her load of wood  and stared in astonishment from one to the other. She seemed to regard it her  husband&rsquo;s duty to clear himself of the imputation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear what he says?&rdquo; she  cried, addressing Dan. &ldquo;He says you plugged his well. I don&rsquo;t know as what that  quite means, but if you plugged his well you done somethin&rsquo; against a neighbour  as you wouldn&rsquo;t have him do to you. Now, what about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he dersen&rsquo;t pretty soon make  himself scarce from here I&rsquo;ll plug <i>&rsquo;im!</i> <i>That&rsquo;s</i> what about it!&rdquo; And Dan made a  lurch as though he would execute the threat there and then.</p>
<p>But Dan&rsquo;s wife held him back. She  threw her arms about him, and shrieked to him not to take the law into his own  hands; and she shrieked to old Skinnerlouse &ldquo;to go; for heaven&rsquo;s sake to get  away at oncet&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But she could have held Dan back  with a cotton thread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said once that I would end me  days in gaol,&rdquo; Dan gurgled, struggling with his wife, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m only sorry&rdquo;&mdash;  straining harder&mdash;&ldquo;it will be for takin&rsquo; the life&rdquo;&mdash;hisses and gasps&mdash;&ldquo;of a thing  like &rsquo;im, an&rsquo; not a&rdquo;&mdash;a tremendous effort to get free&mdash;&ldquo;a <i>man!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan at last got free, and flung  himself out of the door. But old Skinnerlouse was then galoping down the road.</p>
<p>Dan turned angrily on his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did yer hold me for?&rdquo; he  growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t want y&rsquo; to get &rsquo;<i>urt</i>,&rdquo; she said. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Dan and Ted</b></h2>
<p>It was spitting rain, and Ted knew  it would be an off-day with Dan, and decided to drop in for a yarn. Ted knew it  would be an off-day with Dan, anyhow. Ted understood Dan. He understood him  because he revered him, because be believed all the lies Dan told him. And in  the art of lying Dan was a wowser. To Ted Dan was the tree of knowledge, the pillar  of light. To Dan Ted was a &ldquo;jolly decent little bloke&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ted found Dan lying on the broad  of his back in the doorway. His large, bare feet, like the front ends of a  couple of large goannas playing hide and seek among the ironbarks, were  sprawling up along either door-post, while the bulk of his hulking carcase  blocked the entrance like the fork end of a large log-swept in by the back way.  In this comfortable attitude Dan was looking after the yearling infant; keeping  it quiet by balancing it above his head on his broad palms, and at intervals  heaving it at the rafters and catching it again. Now and again the voice of  Mrs. Dan, moving about in the performance of the housework, would call  warningly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful you don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;er fall,  now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And from Dan would come a &ldquo;Heigh,  hup-la, hup! Hoh-h, that was a big one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted arrived at the front of Dan&rsquo;s  bark hut. He didn&rsquo;t shout: &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; or knock, or announce himself in any  way. Ted was filled with a notion to steal in quietly and surprise Dan. He had  scarcely conceived the notion when his eye rested on one of Dan&rsquo;s bare feet  embracing the door-post. Ted stared hard at that bare foot for several seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hup-la! Hup! Hoh-h-h,&rsquo;&rsquo; came from  Dan.</p>
<p>Ted grinned to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not s&rsquo; &rsquo;igh as thet!&rdquo; from  Mrs. Dan.</p>
<p>Ted cautiously approached the  door-post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, again, hup!&rdquo; from Dan.</p>
<p>Ted pressed close to the bare  foot, and bit Dan&rsquo;s big toe hard, hard enough to put some life into the dead.  It put quite a lot into Dan. A loud yell came from him, then an oath, followed  by a bump on the floor, and screams from the baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve done it now! You&rsquo;ve  done it! I know&rsquo;d you would!&rdquo; Mrs. Dan rushing from the bedroom end of the  humpy, screeched, &ldquo;Oh, you usetless man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renewed screams came from the  infant as its mother hugged and hushed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why couldn&rsquo;t y&rsquo; mind th&rsquo;  child properly! You wretch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dan, who had gained his feet,  darted out the open door and looked about. There was nothing suspicious in  view. He examined the door-post curiously. It presented no suspicious features.  Then taking the wounded toe in one hand, he hopped inside again, and sitting  down, proceeded to inspect it closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my poor li&rsquo;l&rsquo; darling;  mother&rsquo;s li&rsquo;l&rsquo; pet! What did &rsquo;e do to yer?&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Dan into the  offspring&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By cripes,&rdquo; Dan said, &ldquo;some  bloomin&rsquo; thing bit me on th&rsquo; toe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity it didn&rsquo;t bite yer  &rsquo;ead off,&rdquo; rejoined his wife, savagely, &ldquo;for lettin&rsquo; &rsquo;er fall purpusly. Oh, you  are a pretty man! A nicet father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For lettin&rsquo; yer gran&rsquo;mother fall  purpusly,&rdquo; Dan growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer a <i>crawler!</i> a usetless <i>crawler!</i> that&rsquo;s all y&rsquo;ar&rsquo;!&rdquo; howled Mrs. Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what are <i>you?</i>&rdquo; Dan inquired, with indiference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did <i>right</i> I&rsquo;d go an&rsquo; leave yer!&rdquo; in loud, hysterical tones from Mrs.  Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s th&rsquo; use o&rsquo; doin&rsquo;  what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Dan inquired, gazing hard at his toe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think y&rsquo; would let a &rsquo;elpless  li&rsquo;l&rsquo; child fall on th&rsquo; &rsquo;ard floor! Yer a dog, that&rsquo;s what y&rsquo;ar&rsquo;,&rdquo; fairly screamed  his better half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t yer mind yer kid  th&rsquo; same as other women have ter do?&rdquo; cold-bloodedly from Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same as hother women have to  do!&rsquo;&rsquo; echoed Mrs. Dan. Then raising her voice several notes higher: &ldquo;Hother  women ain&rsquo;t got ter cook, an&rsquo; bake, an&rsquo; scrub, an&rsquo; clean, an&rsquo; cut wood, an&rsquo;  carry warter, an&rsquo; keep YOU too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dan raised his toe nearer his eyes  and growled calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep me? No, they ain&rsquo;t . . . neither  have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, haven&rsquo;t I? Huh!&rdquo; with a  contemptuous scoff, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t I? Eh? Ah! Oh no! Huh!&rdquo; Then lapsing into a  silence, she fell to searching the baby, inside and out for fractures.</p>
<p>Dan took his big toe nearer the  light to diagnose it more.</p>
<p>The silence lasted quite a  while&mdash;lasted till Dan, himself, broke it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If them ain&rsquo;t teeth marks,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat me bloomin&rsquo; hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted sauntered in by the back way.</p>
<p>Dan and Mrs. Dan looked up  together upon hearing the footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helloa, Ted&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Havin&rsquo; some more wet weather!&rdquo;  Ted said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it looks like continyin,&rdquo; Dan  answered, with a glance at the bit of a drizzle that was barely wetting the  grass in front of the door.</p>
<p>Ted flopped into a seat like a  blackfellow&rsquo;s dog into a shade.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dan laughed a ready-made sort  of laugh, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wisht y&rsquo; had come a bit  sooner, Ted.&rdquo; Then her eyes settled on Dan in a loving sort of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, was ennerthin&rsquo; on?&rdquo; Ted  drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would yer believe it, Ted. &rsquo;E  (still looking fondly at Dan) couldn&rsquo;t hold th&rsquo; baby fer a couple o&rsquo; minets  without lettin&rsquo; it fall. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s a pretty nurse, Ted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He oughter be able t&rsquo; be this  time,&rdquo; Ted drawled.</p>
<p>Dan presented his wounded toe to  Ted, and explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, just yeou take care it  wasn&rsquo;t one o&rsquo; them red spiders what bit y&rsquo;!&rdquo; Mrs. Dan said, with a tender  regard for her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re dangerous!&rdquo; Ted put  in.</p>
<p>A troubled look came over Dan. The  red spider business had silently occupied his thoughts for some time. And where  poison was concerned Dan was a cur. He was a cur where poison wasn&rsquo;t concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots o&rsquo; people have been bit be  them red spiders without knowin&rsquo; it, an&rsquo; have died too,&rdquo; the wife added for  Dan&rsquo;s information and consolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; from Ted.</p>
<p>Dan leaned down and squeezed his  toe long and thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Ted winked vigorously at Mrs. Dan,  and made unskilled efforts to let her into the secret that lurked in his bosom.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dan wondered if Ted was going  mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it wasn&rsquo;t a snake?&rdquo; Ted  said, and chancing to look up quickly Dan detected the fag end of a grin that  Ted meant for Mrs. Dan. Then Dan&rsquo;s big, resourceful brain became active. And Dan  had a keen scent for deception and dissimulation. He eyed Ted closely; regarded  his mouth critically. Ted felt he was looking into his very soul, and quailed  under the scrutiny. Dan was satisfied; was confident; relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them ain&rsquo;t th&rsquo; kind o&rsquo; marks a snake  makes with his fangs,&rdquo; he remarked, holding up his toe, &ldquo;But any way, if it wer&rsquo;  a snake he won&rsquo;t be far off, &rsquo;cause when he bit it that toe was all over  arsenic that I put on to kill that corn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan chuckled a fiendish sort of  chuckle, and from out the corner of his eye watched Ted. But he hadn&rsquo;t to watch  long. All at once Ted&rsquo;s eyes began to roll; his jaws to work automatically, and  his whole frame seemed to be falling to pieces.</p>
<p>He rose and staggered to the door  and showed symptoms of sea sickness. Mrs. Dan took alarm at his sudden turn.  She offered him sauce and tried him with pain killer, and suggested a dose of  oil.</p>
<p>But Dan sat and grinned like the  villain in a play. He put his fingers to his nose, too, and signalled at the  back of Ted as though sending a wireless through him.</p>
<p>All at once Ted reeled round, and  with perspiration and desperation on his brow, faced Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fer heaven&rsquo;s s-s-sake tell me,  was th-there arsenic on yer toe, Dan?&rdquo; he cried tragically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wouldn&rsquo;t matter to you if  there were, would it, Ted?&rdquo; Dan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was me th-that bit y&rsquo;, Dan.  Oh, my heavens, it wa-was me!&rdquo; Ted groaned and sank on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer clown!&rdquo; Dan cried, hitting  him on the back, &ldquo;git up; I know&rsquo;d it was you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted partly recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wa-was there any on it, Dan?&rdquo;  he asked, seeking the other&rsquo;s assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! none,&rdquo; Dan replied.</p>
<p>Ted smiled a little and said:  &ldquo;Sure, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look&rdquo;, Dan said, extending his  big toe to the infant as though offering it a lollie stick, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d let th&rsquo; kid  bite it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted looked down at the innocent  offspring and smiled. &ldquo;Oh, yer little devil!&rdquo; Dan suddenly shouted, drawing  himself together, &ldquo;darn me if she ain&rsquo;t got teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? A tooth?&rdquo; Mrs. Dan cried  wildly, grabbing up the infant. &ldquo;Oh, show me, deary, deary, deary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bloomin&rsquo; mouthful of &rsquo;em&rdquo; Dan  growled.</p>
<p>And Ted laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Before Church Went In</b></h2>
<p>Church Sunday at Nelanjie. The  congregation was waiting for the parson to come along; the female portion of  it, about a dozen strong, standing round the front door, which was also the  back door, sheltering themselves from a fierce, unrelenting heat under half as  many umbrellas; the male element lolloping against the walls, rubbing the  white-wash off with their clothes, and talking weirdly about rain, and  rifle-shooting and cows and crops, and the prospect of a certain big estate  that had blocked their progress, and the progress of their fathers and their  grandfathers for more than half a century, being subdivided and sold in small  areas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, if you blokes want  that station cut up,&rdquo; Dan observed advisedly, &ldquo;do as we did down at  Tumburraboo: make yerselves an infernal nuisance to th&rsquo; Government, and y&rsquo;ll  get it. Take it from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darn well kick them outer office;  they&rsquo;re no good to th&rsquo; country!&rdquo; little Alfred, an ardent Labour man, snapped  feelingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for that very reason yer  want to keep them in,&rdquo; Dan replied, looking round upon the others with the air  of a man of much wisdom. But his meaning was too deep for them. They were not  politicians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you can understand, is  what we did,&rdquo; Dan went on, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; now I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it,&rdquo; and dragging  his ungainly length from the wall, and taking up a central position on the  grass, proceeded to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were burstin&rsquo;, of course, same  as you blokes are now, to have Tumburraboo cut up, but we didn&rsquo;t want the  Government to do it, y&rsquo; follow me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t follow him. His words  were a mystery to them, and one said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t want th&rsquo; Government to do  it, and yet you asked them to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we only wanted to scare the  syndicate that was after it into buying it, quick like. And where&rsquo;d be the use  of the Government buying any way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan paused for a reply. One came  promptly from little Alfred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, longer an&rsquo; easier terms, of  course,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Dan smiled pathetically on little  Alfred, and answered, tapping that individual convincingly on the foot:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Government terms were no use to  us, my boy, when the land had to go to ballot, and they won&rsquo;t be any use to any  of you here, either, though you mightn&rsquo;t think it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; little Alfred said, and  started the others laughing. And little Alfred, in gratitude for their  appreciation of his argument, laughed with them.</p>
<p>But Dan didn&rsquo;t laugh. He didn&rsquo;t  even smile. A sensitive man was Dan when the fit moved him. He was also a  hotheaded man in debate, or in business, or in a drink, and he possessed a  large pair of hairy arms, and a long ugly reach. For several seconds he fixed a  pair of half-closed eyes steadily upon little Alfred, then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two pins I&rsquo;d wring your  neck,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t wring it for two  quid, old chap, without y&rsquo; got plenty of help,&rdquo; little Alfred shot back, and  set the others laughing more. He laughed some more himself, too.</p>
<p>Dan rose, and without further  remark, brought his long ugly reach into action. His great hands went out and  groped for little Alfred&rsquo;s wind pipe. But little Alfred was well trained in the  first law of nature. He ducked under that reach, and rapped Dan hard and  unexpectedly on the ribs; one! two! three! Then dancing out into the open he  sparred round like a star performer in a Bora ceremony.</p>
<p>The congregation were carried away  with joy. So sudden a change came over them that one would have thought they  had just risen from the dead. For variation they started to cheer little Alfred  lustily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just keep your mouths shut now,&rdquo;  Dan said threateningly to those who cheered loudest.</p>
<p>But little Alfred responded to  their applause. There was nothing of the white feather about little Alfred. He  sailed in again like a small torpedo boat bunting the side of a cliff, and hit  Dan some more in the ribs, and came away from him as though hauled back by  invisible wires. Little Alfred&rsquo;s leg-work was perfection, it was a  revelation&mdash;to Dan.</p>
<p>Pleased with the impression he had  made on Dan&rsquo;s ribs he fixed his attention to his nose. Dan&rsquo;s nose was a big  nose, and little Alfred started in with the intention of planting one on the  bridge of it. But his laudable design was unexpectedly frustrated. A useless,  mongrel dog in search of a bit of shade&mdash; Alfred&rsquo;s own mongrel too&mdash;sauntered up  and got in the way and interfered with his side-step. Alfred blundered, and Dan  succeeded in getting the grip he had been groping for with closed eyes ever  since the fight started. And a terrible grip it was. He hugged and mauled  little Alfred like a parent bear. Little Alfred kicked, and bit, and scratched,  and yelled indictable language to the others to rescue him. But he might just  as well have appealed to them to drown themselves in the little tin tank  attached to the church. But one was there, a quaint, ragged, bare-footed orphan  boy, known in the district as &ldquo;Snowy&rdquo;, and who was religiously sent to church  once a month by his guardian employer, instead of to a day school, who  entertained no fear for Dan. Snowy started in and attacked Dan in the rear with  his bare foot. Dan glanced back over his shoulder to see what was assaulting  him. If he had possessed a tail he might have &ldquo;flicked&rdquo; him off; but he hadn&rsquo;t.  So Dan just cow-kicked Snowy in the empty stomach and temporarily disabled him.</p>
<p>Little Alfred continued to yell  for first aid, but none was forthcoming. Dan, at arm&rsquo;s-length, elevated him  bodily above his head, and was glaring murderously about for a wheel or  something to break him across, when the parson himself strolled quietly round  the church corner.</p>
<p>Dan was a coward where parsons  were concerned, and at sight of the cloth instantly lowered little Alfred to  the ground and smiled forgivingly and apologetically upon him.</p>
<p>But there was no forgiveness in  the soul of little Alfred, neither was there any fear for the church about him.  He met Dan&rsquo;s smile of forgiveness with a volley of scorching profanity, and was  well on his way with a second lot when the parson with horror in his eye fell  upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! What! What! What&rsquo;s this I  hear?&rdquo; he cried angrily. &ldquo;Oh, wretched sinner! and in the presence of the Lord,  too! How do you expect to go to Heaven! Eh! how do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a wheelbarrow, if I can&rsquo;t go  any other way!&rdquo; little Alfred shouted in a voice of rage calculated to silence  the clergy once and for ever. But the parson was one who took a hand every year  in celebrating the glories of St. George, and had never missed a chance to  boast of the &ldquo;bull-dog&rdquo; blood that trickled proudly through his pious veins,  and wasn&rsquo;t easily silenced, anyhow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, my man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I  come of a good old fighting stock, just you remember that, and there are times  when even a Minister of the Gospel might be justified in taking it into his own  hands to administer physical punishment to sinners such as you. And, mark you  this: though you see me wearing the cloth, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten my boxing days  at Cambridge, and I haven&rsquo;t neglected my dumb-bells either, not for a single  morning.&rdquo; And with vain pride he tapped that part of his arm where the most muscle  should have been, and smiled a brave sort of smile upon his congregation.</p>
<p>But little Alfred was in no mood  to weigh words of warning with the church. He was in no mood but a fighting  mood, and wasn&rsquo;t particular where the fight came from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he snarled,  contemptously looking the parson all over, &ldquo;you, is it? Well, put &rsquo;em up,&rdquo; and  off he danced into the second act of the Bora ceremony, circling and sparring all  round the enemy.</p>
<p>And the congregation showed no  signs of alarm. They weren&rsquo;t at all horrified at the turn things had taken. On the  contrary, their faces shone and glowed with joyful expectancy, as they formed  themselves into a ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then sinner,&rdquo; the  parson replied accommodatingly; and calmly divesting himself of his long black  coat tossed it in business-like fashion over his shoulder. The cloth settled on  the ragged form of Snowy. Snowy embraced it as a trophy. He pulled it on; then  with both hands dug deep into the pockets among the sermons, and expanding his  murky features into a large grin, paraded proudly behind the &ldquo;ring&rdquo;. Jim  McSmith and Joe O&rsquo;Brown and some more at sight of Snowy fell on the grass, and  wriggled and writhed in merriment.</p>
<p>The parson, with cuffs that were  not the same colour as his shirt, rolled up, sparred in real Cambridge fashion,  and getting quickly to work led with the right at little Alfred&rsquo;s head and  knocked all the skin off his own knuckles.</p>
<p>The congregation grinned and  gufawed, and applauded their shepherd.</p>
<p>The shepherd wrung his fingers,  and grimaced and exposed his gold-mounted teeth; then he sparred for another  opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us another o&rsquo; those!&rdquo; little  Alfred said, &ldquo;throwing off&rdquo; at his adversary, &ldquo;come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The congregation laughed.</p>
<p>Little Alfred brought his  foot-work into action and darted about in several directions at the same time.  The church narrowly missed little Alfred&rsquo;s ear with its left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That all they learnt y&rsquo; at  Cambridge?&rdquo; little Alfred said, with a grin.</p>
<p>The congregation laughed again.</p>
<p>Then like an infuriated ram little  Alfred charged the parson and aimed six or seven of his best at all parts of  him. The parson grunted several times, and closed with little Alfred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off! Off! Let go!&rdquo; Dan cried,  assuming the office of referee. &ldquo;Square dinkum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Alfred broke away, then  swopped his right for the church&rsquo;s left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha, sinner!&rdquo; the church chuckled  gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good men! Good men!&rdquo; Dan cried  encouragingly. &ldquo;A dern good little fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into &rsquo;im, Alfy!&rdquo; from Snowy.  &ldquo;Into &rsquo;im!&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make him lick his chops  directly,&rdquo; little Alfred said.</p>
<p>More merriment from the  congregation.</p>
<p>Then true to his word, little Alfred  rushed the enemy, and hitting out wildly and blindly, felled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeerusalem!&rdquo; Dan cried, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s  gone right out to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good man, Alfy!&rdquo; from Snowy,  &ldquo;that fetched him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan stood over the fallen parson,  and started to count him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One &hellip;two &hellip;three &hellip;four &hellip;five &hellip;six &hellip;seven &hellip;eight &hellip;nine&hellip;&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten, yer dorg!&rdquo; little Alfred  said savagely, at the same time landing Dan his best punch on &ldquo;the point&rdquo;. Dan  went down in a limp heap beside the parson, and grabbing up his clothes little  Alfred jumped the fence, and departed without waiting for the service.</p>
<p>The congregation turned pale.  Terror took possession of every soul of them. They were in the act of flying  from the field and leaving someone else be charged with murder, when the parson  showed signs of life. Then they remained. The parson sat up and gazed about in  a dazed sort of way. One of the congregation spoke to him anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revelations, first chapter,  second verse,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then Dan stirred himself, and sat  up dreamily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, is it daylight?&rdquo; he said,  staring foolishly about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s starlight, blokey,&rdquo;  Snowy said, patting him on the head, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t yer see Jupitus shinin&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  Dan Resents a Shabby Trick</b></h2>
<p>Dan was much perturbed over the  prospects of ringing the giant trees that towered in solemn, stately possession  of his patch of wild, unreclaimed earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take the beggars a good  year or two to die, too, when they <i>are</i> rung!&rdquo; came dolefully from him as he rubbed the broken butt of a file over the  face of a rusty old axe held between his knees. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s if they don&rsquo;t all  sucker, them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did y&rsquo; see in th&rsquo; paper that come  round th&rsquo; soap,&rdquo; his wife inquired helpfully, &ldquo;where someone wrote a letter  sayin&rsquo; as how be puttin&rsquo; bluestone on the axe he killed, oh! ever such a lot o&rsquo;  timber, in about a fortnight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan cheered up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;bluestone? . . . on  the axe? . . . Why, that&rsquo;ll be what they was talkin&rsquo; about at th&rsquo; fact&rsquo;ry. . .  . Bluestone? . . . Cripes! . . . on the axe, eh? . . . But how? . . . what way,  I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dan, feeling she had suddenly  risen to someone of importance in the eyes of her husband, rushed away and  began hunting for the paper that &ldquo;come round the soap&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is; I&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo; she  cried, returning in triumph with a fragment of a daily.</p>
<p>Dan eagerly seized the scrap, and  laboriously spelt over a letter addressed to the editor, a letter forming part  of a weird controversy that had been carried on in the daily anent &ldquo;ring-barking green timber&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cripes, eh!&rdquo; he ejaculated when  he reached the end of it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve on&rsquo;y to soak the blade of the axe in  bluestone the night before y&rsquo; start ringin . . . That&rsquo;s easy enough done, an&rsquo; I  just happen to have a bit o&rsquo; bluestone, to . . . Kills &rsquo;em all in a fortnight .  . . Christmas, that&rsquo;s better than waitin&rsquo; for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There y&rsquo;ar&rsquo;, now, yer see,&rdquo; his  wife said pleasantly, &ldquo;yer wouldn&rsquo;t have know&rsquo;d that on&rsquo;y for <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d have found it out  orright,&rdquo; Dan drawled stubbornly, &ldquo;some other way or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan was not a man to admit  anything to a woman&rsquo;s credit. Dan understood women, and knew how easy it was to  spoil them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s alez th&rsquo; way with you  men,&rdquo; Mrs. Dan observed. &ldquo;Yer never likes to give a woman credit for anything  she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yous don&rsquo;t want any credit,&rdquo; Dan  said with an affectionate grin. &ldquo;We give yer all our hard cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dan laughed a short, harsh  laugh, a laugh that sounded like a washing machine in full swing, and answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s th&rsquo; on&rsquo;y joke I ever  heerd y&rsquo; make, Dan Rudd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then yer don&rsquo;t know me very well,  if it is,&rdquo; from Dan, as he rose to hunt up that bit of bluestone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t know y&rsquo;,&rdquo; his wife  shouted after him, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who does then, for there ain&rsquo;t much of yer  that I ain&rsquo;t seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * *</p>
<p>For about a month Dan rose early,  and with his axe stained with bluestone, went out and swung it hard at those  giant trees. Never in his life before did Dan swing an axe so hard and  honestly.</p>
<p>At the end of the long days he  would lean heavily on the handle, and regarding the patches he had rung with a  look of satisfaction, would say to his wife: &ldquo;Now, if that lot goes off right  away, as they ought to, we&rsquo;ll have this twenty acres cleared and under the  plough in no time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And his wife with joy in her heart  would roam the multitude of mutilated ironbarks, scanning them closely for  symptoms of early decay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a month or more now since  yer rung th&rsquo; fust ones.&rdquo; she said one day, &ldquo;and they ain&rsquo;t startin&rsquo; to die  yet.&rdquo; And in her voice there was just a suspicion of doubt and disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to be . . . and y&rsquo;d  think they would be,&rdquo; Dan agreed, pulling hard and thoughtfully at his beard.  After a long pause he added: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s if there&rsquo;s ennerthin&rsquo; in th&rsquo; bloomin&rsquo; bluestone  business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But one day, in response to a  personal appeal from McDoolan, Dan put the axe aside and went over to give a  hand at the threshing. Among the irregular hands engaged on the thresher was a  scholarly sort of ne&rsquo;er-do-well, a talkative individual with an overwhelming  predilection for engaging in arguments. He engaged in one with McDoolan on the  political situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I appeal to any of these men,&rdquo;  the ne&rsquo;er-do-well said, turning to all hands on the machine, &ldquo;to say if I&rsquo;m not  right, and I&rsquo;ll lay a hundred on it I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rarely was ever an appeal made in  vain to Dan, unless it was one for tobacco or money or something that had to be  bought with money. The ne&rsquo;er-do-well didn&rsquo;t appeal in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Dan said advisedly  to McDoolan, &ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Dan scarcely knew what the argument was all  about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! listen here,&rdquo; snorted  McDoolan, and from memory proceeded to quote the views of the editor of the  daily on the matter, concluding confidently with: &ldquo;So there, who&rsquo;s right an&rsquo;  who&rsquo;s wrong now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ne&rsquo;er-do-well burst into loud,  derisive laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy anyone with a grain o&rsquo;  common quoting the editor of that paper,&rdquo; he cried, and laughed some more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, them blanky editors writes a  &rsquo;orrible lot o&rsquo; rot,&rdquo; Dan mentioned incidentally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The editor of that paper in  particular writes, prints, and believes anything that&rsquo;s sent him or told him,&rdquo;  the ne&rsquo;er-do-well said, &ldquo;and to prove it I&rsquo;ll let you into a little secret.&rdquo;  Addressing himself to McDoolan: &ldquo;You read, I suppose, those letters that appeared  not long ago about ring-barking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>McDoolan nodded. Dan nodded too,  while his eyes widened with rapture and interest. He also shifted his position,  so as not to miss anything that might be said about the ring-barking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just for a joke, and to see  if the editor was ass enough to print it, I sent one in advising ringbarkers to  soak their axes in bluestone before starting on the trees&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud laugh came from all hands, all  except Dan. He started up, and began shifting restlessly about. &ldquo;And blow me if  he didn&rsquo;t print every word of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More laughter from all hands  again&mdash;except Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But be writin&rsquo; a thing like that  you might &rsquo;a&rsquo; caused a lot o&rsquo; poor beggars to start bluestonin&rsquo; their axes like  fools!&rdquo; one man said in disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be heavens then!&rdquo; McDoolan cried,  forgetting all about the argument and bursting into laughter on his own  account. &ldquo;Dan Rudd here wer&rsquo; a-ringin&rsquo; trees like th&rsquo; divil when I went forrim  yesserd&rsquo;y. May be he greased the axe wid bluestone.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Great merriment at Dan&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>With a heavy, sinking feeling at  his heart, Dan slouched off to his place on the stack. Seizing the pitch-fork  he prodded it hard into a sheaf, and said in a forced voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Mac; never mind yer  bloomin&rsquo; bluestone an&rsquo; politics! Let us get thrashin&rsquo; over or we&rsquo;ll be here all  night.&rdquo; </p>
<p>McDoolan went on; the machine  rattled, and rust and dust flew up in great clouds again.</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * *</p>
<p>The ne&rsquo;er-do-well and Dan left the  stacks together, and were waking towards McDoolan&rsquo;s cottage, where tea was  prepared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was a true bill,&rdquo; the  ne&rsquo;er-do-well said confidentially to Dan. &ldquo;I wrote a letter to the <i>Daily</i> advising all bally simpletons to  soak their axes well in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>bul-lood!</i>&rdquo; Dan yelled, jumping round savagely and landing him one  between the two eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;s-say!&rdquo; stammered the  ne&rsquo;er-do-well, staggering back, &ldquo;Wh-what did I d-d-do to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what you did all right.&rdquo;  Dan snarled, and walked off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  Dan Decides to go West</b></h2>
<p>The world was wagging badly with  Dan. There was nothing coming in; no money available to meet the store account,  and no work in the district. The confounded country, Dan reckoned, was going to  the devil. Still Dan didn&rsquo;t regard the position as serious enough to worry hard  over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s ready now,&rdquo; Mrs. Dan  said moodily, as she completed laying the table for dinner. (It didn&rsquo;t take  long to lay Dan&rsquo;s dinner table). &ldquo;An&rsquo; yer better sit up, I suppose, an&rsquo; have  what there is to have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan slowly up-ended himself from  the floor where for an hour and more he had been planning schemes for the  future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he muttered, casting his  eyes over the scantily-appointed board, &ldquo;what, has it got down to nothin, but  tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It &rsquo;as! There&rsquo;s only them two  bits o&rsquo; bread left,&rdquo; his wife answered, &ldquo;an&rsquo; if yer eat them there&rsquo;ll be no sop  for th&rsquo; child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, ain&rsquo;t there a egg, or  nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; Dan muttered again, &ldquo;h&rsquo;m,&rdquo;  then contented himself by sipping noisily and thoughtfully at the black tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; unless there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; done  soon,&rdquo; his wife whimpered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen. We  can&rsquo;t stay here for ever an&rsquo; live on air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see much use me  hangin&rsquo; round this rotten place any longer,&rdquo; Dan said feelingly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nothin&rsquo; for a cove to get, an&rsquo; I suppose the only thing to do is to roll up me  blanket straightaway, an&rsquo; make for the Diamantina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dan offered no comment on her  husband&rsquo;s sudden resolution to rise up and do something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could yer get to stay with y&rsquo;  while I&rsquo;d be away?&rdquo; Dan asked. Dan never liked to go away anywhere without  first seeing to his wife&rsquo;s comfort during his absence. Dan was a thoughtful  husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I could get Johnnie  McDoolan to come over an&rsquo; sleep with me,&rdquo; the wife said, in a weird, hopeless  sort of way.</p>
<p>Dan looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which of them is  Johnnie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s not the <i>oldest</i> one!&rdquo; Mrs. Dan snapped, as though  inclined to resent the question. Then the humour of suspicion seemed to dawn  upon her, and her bottom lip curled up till her face broke into a smile.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the <i>youngest</i>,&rdquo; she added, lifting her voice; &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t anyone know that?  But I don&rsquo;t know that he would like to come all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be young!&rdquo; Dan muttered  stubbornly, &ldquo;if he wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; the wife broke out  indignantly, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s only a child, not six years yet. But who would y&rsquo; have stay  with me, then?&rdquo; And she eyed her husband sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Dan  muttered, &ldquo;that p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps Ted would come over an&rsquo; camp on the sofa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed he won&rsquo;t, then!&rdquo; was the  answer, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;d feel much safer with little Johnnie McDoolan in th&rsquo; bed with  me if he was as old again than your friend Ted on th&rsquo; sofa&mdash;or even outside th&rsquo;  door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. For  several seconds he seemed like one who had been hit hard with something. Then  he put several leading questions to his better half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo; she  snapped, &ldquo;so never y&rsquo; mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well then,&rdquo; Dan said  resolutely, &ldquo;get Johnnie McDoolan to come over.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * *</p>
<p>Next day, Dan, with a blanket  strapped to the saddle, and holding the bridle-reins in his hand, stood at the  door, prepared to make a start for the Diamantina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tat-taa,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said to the baby,  and took its little hand in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go as far as the rails to  see you off,&rdquo; his wife said gloomily. And with the infant in her arms she  walked beside Dan, talking of the future, while he led the horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yairs, I&rsquo;ll write reg&rsquo;lar,&rdquo;  Dan replied, in answer to her final injunction. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll send some money be registered  letter as soon as I get into work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; whatever y&rsquo; do, don&rsquo;t go  taking any drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to tell me that,&rdquo;  and Dan looked like one ready to fly off and take offence at the bare  suggestion of a glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, see y&rsquo; doan&rsquo;t! &rdquo; the wife insisted,  &ldquo;for if ever we want to be well off yer&rsquo;ll have to give it up. &rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a familiar-looking seat  on horseback turned into the lane that led to Dan&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The storekeeper! . . . Coming  again, I really believe!&rdquo; Mrs. Dan gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, take care o&rsquo; yourself,&rdquo;  and Dan hurriedly scrambled into the saddle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Wait for a minute, an&rsquo; see  what&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But before Mrs. Dan could say any  more Dan was going at a hand-gallop towards the Diamantina. The Diamantina was  about five hundred miles out.</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * * * *</p>
<p>For about an hour Dan travelled  briskly along, till presently the Tambooroora township came in sight.  Tambooroora was the average sort of agricultural township where Government  purchased support with a few public buildings and an equal distribution of  J.P.-ships.</p>
<p>Dan was wondering if it wouldn&rsquo;t  be wise to ride right past the place without turning his head to look at it,  when he suddenly remembered that he knew the publican well, and thought he&rsquo;d  drop in and bid old Tom good-bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; pwhat th&rsquo; divil do you want  to go to the Diamantina for?&rdquo; old Tom asked, shaking Dan affectionately by the  hand. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there plenty of room in this part of the country for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dunno,&rdquo; Dan drawled,  &ldquo;things is gettin&rsquo; pretty dull about here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just said it then; you&rsquo;ve  just said it,&rdquo; changing his voice and staring seriously at Dan. &ldquo;By heavens,  they <i>are</i> dull now! S&rsquo;help me  goodness, I haven&rsquo;t taken a single bob over the counter for a fortnit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan grinned broadly. Dan  understood old Tom thoroughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he said, &ldquo;if I had one left  on me you&rsquo;d take it now, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that; I don&rsquo;t  mean that. Of course I would. I know I would. But what I&rsquo;ve been tellin&rsquo; you is  only the plain, Gospel terruth. Still,&rdquo; he looked up pleasantly at the bottles  on the shelves, &ldquo;I think I can afford to buy a couple of drinks.&rdquo; And laughing  a squeaky laugh&mdash;the laugh of the prosperous humbug pretending poverty&mdash;he  reached one down and banged it, along with two glasses, on the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help y&rsquo;self,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Dan helped himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! man! take a good one when  you&rsquo;re about it,&rdquo; and he generously spilt some more into Dan&rsquo;s glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woh-h,&rdquo; Dan cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garn!&rdquo; Then old Tom helped  himself to one&mdash;just a small one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My best respecks, Tom,&rdquo; Dan said,  lifting his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; from Tom, &ldquo;and a  fortune to you in the West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Dan murmured, and  emptied his glass in a gulp.</p>
<p>Both glasses were returned to the  counter together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a drop o&rsquo; good stuff,&rdquo; old  Tom claimed, screwing up his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As good as I&rsquo;ve ever tasted,&rdquo; and  Dan smacked his lips. Then taking from a slit in his hat an old clay pipe, he  searched himself all over for tobacco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here y&rsquo; are,&rdquo; and old Tom pushed  a cake towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-h, thanks&rdquo; Dan said, in a  surprised sort of voice, &ldquo;I had some somewhere on me, but I&rsquo;m blowed if I know  what I did with it. &rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan never did know anything of the  whereabouts of his tobacco.</p>
<p>Dan cut himself a liberal fill,  and placed the balance of the cake in his pocket, suiting the action with a  word or two of compliment on old Tom&rsquo;s healthy appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was never better in all my  life,&rdquo; Tom returned proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You (puff) look it (puff) anyhow,  Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dan leaned one elbow on the  bar-counter, and smoked placidly.</p>
<p>Several well-dressed strangers,  accompanied by a number of the leading townsmen, passed the pub door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s them coves they&rsquo;ve got with  &rsquo;em, Tom?&rdquo; Dan enquired, staring hard through the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one is the distinguished  member for the district, you ought to know him&rdquo; Tom answered, &ldquo;another is the  Minister for Lands, and I suppose his private secretary, and I couldn&rsquo;t tell  you who the other cove is in the straw hat to save me life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;N&rsquo; what th&rsquo; devil &rsquo;ll they be  after around here?&rdquo; Dan further inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like yerself, lookin&rsquo; for a job,  I suppose.&rdquo; and old Tom laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to swop jobs with &rsquo;em  anytime they like,&rdquo; Dan growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose ye would, and so  would I,&rdquo; old Tom added, &ldquo;for they have th&rsquo; rosy times, have them same fellows.  They&rsquo;re here to see if we need anything; you see the general election is coming  on.&rdquo; And he laughed some more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Which chap is the Minister for  Lands?&rdquo; Dan interrogated again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thin-looking man with the  umbrella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A smart chap, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; from  Dan, who vaguely remembered having heard a favourable criticism passed on the  Minister some time or other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; Tom answered with  decision, &ldquo;an&rsquo; far too smart for anyone what haven&rsquo;t got two good eyes to watch  his two hands.&rdquo; Old Tom had no respect for Ministers who failed to frequent his  hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! is that th&rsquo; sort o&rsquo; bloke he  is,&rdquo; and Dan struck another match and applied it to his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be coming back this way  in a minute,&rdquo; Tom informed Dan, &ldquo;to look over the cheese factory, and if you&rsquo;re  not in a great hurry we&rsquo;ll join the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan wasn&rsquo;t in a great hurry&mdash;he  wasn&rsquo;t in any hurry.</p>
<p>In a short while the visitors were  seen returning. Handing over charge of the bar to his wife, old Tom, dragging  Dan after him, went out and intercepted them.</p>
<p>Introductions were exchanged.  Then, addressing the Minister for Lands, old Tom said: &ldquo;This is Mr. Dan Rudd,  Mr. Parkes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do!&rdquo; said the  Minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very well, indeed! how&rsquo;s  yourself?&rdquo; Dan answered, shaking the great official warmly by the hand. &ldquo;And if  I might say it, that&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s not a breach of presumption&rdquo;&mdash;Dan was a polished  speaker in polite society&mdash;&ldquo;I hope the visit of yourself and your excellent  friends here, they&rsquo;re the right sort, I can see in a glance, to our little town  and district, so to speak, will be as great a pleasure to yourself and to them  as it will be a benefit to every one of us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; enthusiastically  from old Tom, and the Minister, a solemn, serious sort of individual, bowed to  Dan and said: &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leading townspeople stood by,  and said nothing. Their faces resembled so many gaol doors. In fact, they  silently declined to acknowledge Dan as a desirable addition to the party.</p>
<p>The visitors were escorted to the  factory. Dan swinging his arm about, as he moved along, directed the Minister&rsquo;s  attention to the rapid rise of the town. &ldquo;During the last year,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s  simply rose like a creek in flood.&rdquo; Then he recounted incidents of its  pioneering days&mdash;incidents that had no more truth in them than the professions  of a politician. Still the party became interested in Dan, and encouraged him  to tell all he knew about the place. Dan told them all he knew, and a lot he  didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a vast difference,&rdquo; the  Minister for Lands remarked, gazing over the unsettled space that breasted the  township, &ldquo;between this coastal country and the plains of the West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, yes&rdquo; from Dan,  &ldquo;wonderful, marvellous! an unthinkably believable difference. And so you know  the West then, Mr. Sparks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the party smiled at Dan&rsquo;s  mistake. The local people silently exchanged sneers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parkes,&rdquo; the Minister said,  correcting Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;er humbly beg for pardon!&rdquo;  and Dan bowed low to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; the Minister went on,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a good deal of the West, a good deal. As Minister for Lands of  course it&rsquo;s necessary I should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would be! What was I  thinking about! Why, you&rsquo;ll know it from A to Z, of course you will,&rdquo; from Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; the great official  concurred proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s not the slightest  doubt, sir, that what you have concluded from what you have seen is quite  correct. I&rsquo;m with you every time on that point. There is indeed a terrible  difference between the West and the inside here. Now for instance, take the  grass of the Diamantina&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the Diamantina?&rdquo; the  Minister interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, know it&mdash;every rise and slope  in it. Why, that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m off to now. But isn&rsquo;t it great country, sir? Did  you ever see grass like it anywhere else in yer life, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fattened cattle out there in  three weeks&mdash;cattle that low and weak in condition that we had to hold their  heads up to give them a drink,&rdquo; Dan brazenly declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a holding out there, I  suppose?&rdquo; the Minister enquired .</p>
<p>Dan promptly lied, and rattled on:  &ldquo;As grass country, I wouldn&rsquo;t give an acre on the Diamantina for twenty here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Tom was forced to smile at  Dan&rsquo;s audacity, while the townspeople murmured things to each other as though  hatching a conspiracy.</p>
<p>The party reached the cheese  factory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Rudd,&rdquo; one of the  directors, acting on behalf of his brothers said, calling Dan to one side.</p>
<p>Dan stepped aside with him, and  lowered his woolly ear for him to speak into.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s about time  you went off somewhere and lost yourself. We&rsquo;re quite able to run this show,&rdquo;  he growled.</p>
<p>Dan laughed a loud, hearty &ldquo;Ha! Ha!&rdquo;  and clapping the leading citizen on the back, cried cheerfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were always a droll old dog,  Swenson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next moment Dan was at the  Minister&rsquo;s side again, and leading the way through the establishment like the  proud proprietor of a Mount Morgan.</p>
<p>The local inhabitants, proud of  their co-operative institution, were bursting to explain its wonderful works,  and eager to hear the visitors, in return, praise them for their enterprise and  self-reliance, and all that sort of thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; drawled one of the directors,  drawing attention to a large vat, &ldquo;contains this morning&rsquo;s milk. Presently it  will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that was as far as he got.  With a lordly sweep of the hand Dan threw cold water over that milk vat, and  carrying the Minister off his legs, so to speak, hustled him into the  &ldquo;store-room,&rdquo; where quite a multitude of cheeses were arranged on the shelving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sight you don&rsquo;t see  every day,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with real pride in his eye.</p>
<p>The Minister threw up his eyebrows  and gazed upon the cheese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sufficient to make a feast fit  for the gods,&rdquo; he remarked, attempting a stock joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fit for the <i>dogs!</i>&rdquo; Dan shouted mirthfully. &ldquo;Hoh! Hoh! No, sir! We&rsquo;d hardly give  them to the dogs. Not us. Oh, bli. No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the gods,&rdquo; the Minister  repeated, smiling at Dan. &ldquo;For the gods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, them!&rsquo; Dan said, snapping his  finger (Dan always snapped his finger when pretending he understood things that  were Dutch to him) &ldquo;I thought you meant the blankey mongrels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve quite a lot in stock,&rdquo; the  Minister said, referring to the cheese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lot,&rdquo; Dan replied, &ldquo;let me  see&rdquo;&mdash;turning to the manager of the factory, who stood grinning at his elbow,  Dan murmured: &ldquo;What do they represent?&rdquo; and the manager answered &ldquo;Three  months&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;represents three months&rsquo; making, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any difficulty finding a  market?&rdquo; asked the Minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; Dan answered  promptly.</p>
<p>The manager stared, and evinced an  inclination to correct Dan, but Dan was talking fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every cheese we make here,&rdquo; he  added, &ldquo;is bought before a cloth goes on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager looked round and  blinked meaningly at the directors, who were crowding in the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n him!&rdquo; one of them hissed,  &ldquo;that&rsquo;s one of the things we want to see about!&rdquo; And the chairman of directors  reached after Dan and tugged at his coat. But Dan only swung his arms about and  hustled the Minister along further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s  something you ought to have a look at,&rdquo; and dragging the Minister to the back  verandah pointed out a smellsome, open drain, oozing and stagnating into a  fever bed.</p>
<p>The Minister shrank from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s the only thing you  could say was at all wrong with this little concern of ours,&rdquo; Dan rattled on.  &ldquo;This time o&rsquo; th&rsquo; day it&rsquo;s not so bad, though, but on a moonlight night when  you&rsquo;re on any of the verandahs about here (here Dan pulled ugly faces) it&rsquo;s a  scorcher, I tell you! Pshew!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as the breeze lifted the full  strength of the drain. &ldquo;Pshew!&rdquo; and jumped back.</p>
<p>Those directors looked daggers at  Dan. The Minister spat several times, then turned to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, gentlemen!&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;that drainage is abominable! It&rsquo;s a danger! A menace to public health! It  can&rsquo;t be allowed to exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A guilty feeling took possession  of the directors, and they looked like convicted criminals.</p>
<p>The Minister cast an appealing look  upon Dan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;ve  always maintained,&rdquo; Dan said loftily.</p>
<p>And as though he would exonerate  him while censuring the others, the Minister continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I know that in a  co-operative concern such as yours it is utterly useless for one man to try and  carry out reforms if the others are against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager of the factory stole  away and stuffed cotton-waste into his mouth to smother his mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I feel it is my duty to tell  you, and I do so advisedly, that you are courting trouble by keeping that drain  there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The member for the district saw a  chance to get into favour with the management and its friends, and threw oil on  the troubled water by getting off on an apologetic speech. In Australia it is  the duty of members of Parliament to condone the sins of those who support  them&mdash;and of those who are likely to support them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fine smell the cheese have,&rdquo;  he concluded, &ldquo;more than make up for the sniff you get out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party moved to the machinery  room. Here Dan, by some mischance, became separated from the main body.</p>
<p>Seizing the opportunity he had  been waiting for, the chairman of directors sidled up to Dan, and whispering  hoarsely and savagely into his ear, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go to blazes out of this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed,  with a surprised look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it!&rdquo; hissed the chairman,  clenching his fists.</p>
<p>Old Tom, scenting trouble,  beckoned Dan into a secluded corner, and talked softly and confidentially to him.</p>
<p>Dan laughed lightly and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m beggared! I can&rsquo;t  understand anyone being so touchy as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Tom lowered his voice again,  and spoke some more in confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Dan said, glancing toward  the front door, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to be going now, in any case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye again, old  fellow,&rdquo; and Tom held out his hand, &ldquo;and may you have lots o&rsquo; good luck on the  Diamantina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan glanced round quickly to  assure himself no eyes were upon them. Then with a shake of the head he  motioned old Tom still further into the shades of that secluded corner. He seemed  to have a great and awful secret to impart to Tom.</p>
<p>Tom put his ear up to Dan&rsquo;s mouth,  and Dan imparted the secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got on me,&rdquo;  Tom said, handing Dan a half-crown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;ll see me through,&rdquo; Dan  said eagerly, and put the half-crown in his pocket. Then he held out his hand  to Tom and shook him vigorously, saying as he looked him between the two eyes:  &ldquo;Good old Tom! A friend in need is a friend indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye! Good-bye!&rdquo; Tom said  peevishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop you a line when I get  out there,&rdquo; Dan called back, as he reached the door, &ldquo;and let y&rsquo; know how  things are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go to th&rsquo; devil!&rdquo; Tom  growled, <i>sotto voce</i>, &ldquo;blasht y&rsquo;.&rdquo;  Then he hurried to the machinery room and rejoined the visitors.</p>
<p>Before mounting his horse to  continue his journey Dan stepped into the bar to say &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; to Mrs. Brown,  old Tom&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; are you leaving your wife  behind you?&rdquo; Mrs. Brown enquired, with a look of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t think of takin&rsquo;  her all the way out there,&rdquo; Dan answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can she trust you now, all  that distance away from her?&rdquo; and Mrs. Brown smiled like a maiden of sixteen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my oath,&rdquo; Dan said, and  &ldquo;chucked&rdquo; Mrs. Brown familiarly under the chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along wid you!&rdquo; she cried,  jumping back and colouring up. &ldquo;What is it you want to drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisky every time,&rdquo; Dan said,  flashing the half-crown and banging it down hard on the counter.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown reached down a bottle,  and Dan poured himself out a stiff one.</p>
<p>He drank it, then picked up the  half-crown and put it back into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can y&rsquo; lend us a match, Mrs. B?&rdquo;  he asked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown handed him a full box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have those,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, they&rsquo;ll be handy,&rdquo; Dan  said, and put them into his pocket too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye, Mrs. B,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;take care of yourself!&rdquo; and hurried out the door.</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * * * *</p>
<p>The sun had just gone down.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dan and little Johnnie  McDoolan were having their first tea together, and on the table was a pile of  home-made scones that Mrs. McDoolan had sent over with Johnnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where your daddy is  now?&rdquo; Mrs. Dan was saying to the infant dangling from her knee. &ldquo;Boiling his billy  under a tree, perhaps,&rdquo; when she heard a footstep at the door. She rose  quickly, and looked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heavens!&rdquo; she cried in  surprise, &ldquo;what on earth&rsquo;s happened! What has brought you back already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dunno!&rdquo; Dan drawled. &ldquo;I  think I can get work closer, without goin&rsquo; all that bloomin&rsquo; distance for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he came right in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is (hic)  Johnnie, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnnie blushed and grinned.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s eyes rested on the pile of  scones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scones (hic) eh?&rdquo; he said,  cheerfully. &ldquo;And by Jo&rsquo; (hic) Jove, I&rsquo;m just about (hic) fit for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Dan was. He ate them all  except two!</p>

  At McClure s</b></h2>
<p>Duncan McClure, of Narralane,  required a farm-hand, and Dan was given the job. Dan was given the job because  he answered all the questions that Duncan put to him about agriculture and dairying  in a learned sort of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, he can dae ony bl-oomin&rsquo;  thing aboot a fairm,&rdquo; Duncan told his wife, joyfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s jist the man I&rsquo;m  wantin&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; bad. Ye canna beat th&rsquo; r-rale Australian native. Thae ither chaps  frae the auld country are r-rale gossoons. They dinna ken hoo things are wantit  tae be dune. An&rsquo; yet they think they ken a deil o&rsquo; a lot. By cripes, they dae  that! In fac&rsquo;, they&rsquo;ll tell ye hoo ye&rsquo;re daein&rsquo; things a&rsquo; wrang yoursel&rsquo;! An&rsquo;  sic awfu&rsquo; puir hauns wi horses! It takes them maist five year tae drive sax  beasts i&rsquo; a team. But this yun,&rdquo; meaning Dan, &ldquo;can dae a&rsquo; them things wi&rsquo;  won&rsquo;erfu&rsquo; confidence an&rsquo; speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan, with eight horses drawing a  waggon loaded with timber for a stable that Duncan was having erected, came  swinging through the farm-yard gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes th&rsquo; noo wi&rsquo; th&rsquo;  loadin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Duncan remarked, gazing off the end of his front verandah, &ldquo;ye can  tell in a glance he&rsquo;s a guid driver; he&rsquo;s sae unconcerned aboot it a&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gee back!</i>&rdquo; came in loud, ringing tones from Dan, &ldquo;<i>gee back!</i> Oh you&mdash;! you&mdash;! blast your&mdash;!  you&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure, standing beside  Duncan, was horrified. &ldquo;Oh, heavenly faither!&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;better he couldna  drive ava than use sic awfu&rsquo; words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some more bad language came from  Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! shut ye up!&rdquo; screamed Mrs.  McClure, &ldquo;ye mauna, man! Ye mauna say sic things! It&rsquo;s weeked o&rsquo; you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then addressing Duncan:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye maun stop him frae it! Oh,  what if th&rsquo; meenister wer&rsquo; here sittin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; us? It would be sinfu&rsquo; to his  ears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By cr-ripes, he can swear a&rsquo;  richt,&rdquo; Duncan drawled philosophically. Then stepping from the verandah he  passed out the gate and strode leisurely across to the team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said, greeting Dan,  &ldquo;did ye get them to go a&rsquo; richt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my word,&rdquo; Dan replied cheerfuly.  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re good little &rsquo;orses to pull, boss&mdash;as good as ever looked through a winker,  but they&rsquo;ve been fooled about a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heerd y&rsquo; sweerin&rsquo; at them  comin&rsquo; in th&rsquo; gate,&rdquo; Duncan said in low, confidential sort of tones.</p>
<p>Dan laughed lightly, and wiped the  perspiration from his brow with the crown of his old felt hat. Dan seemed to  think his employer was paying him a high compliment. &ldquo;Oh yairs,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I  let off steam a bit sometimes. It&rsquo;s the only way to get horses to take any  notice of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dae ye r-reckon it is?&rdquo; Duncan  asked cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my word!&rdquo; confidentially from  Dan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wondered how they understand it. Now, just you watch that little  bald-faced mare when I speak to her.&rdquo; Dan faced the team, and addressed a few  words of warning in a calm voice to the bald-face mare. The mare never let on  she heard him. Then Dan walked up to her and spoke terrible language into her  ear. The mare threw up her head and started prancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that?&rdquo; and Dan turned  triumphantly to Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By th&rsquo; holy smoke, ye&rsquo;re richt  aboot her,&rdquo; and Duncan smiled broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, just you try it on th&rsquo; big  brown horse yourself,&rdquo; Dan suggested. &ldquo;Just speak to him the way I spoke to the  mare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan threw a sly glance in the  direction of his wife, and answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dina think I could sweer gude  eneuch. &rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dan insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just try it for the fun o&rsquo; th&rsquo;  thing,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well&rdquo; Duncan consented,  slowly squaring himself for the effort, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just try it once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broonie,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll skin ye  alive if ye dinna pu&rsquo; mair &rsquo;n ye&rsquo;re daein&rsquo;, ye auld sod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brownie paid no attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that,&rdquo; from Dan, with a grin  of approval.</p>
<p>Then Duncan approached the horse  and said into his ear: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Bl-larst ye, Broome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But not a budge was there from  Brownie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he doesna mind me sweerin&rsquo;,&rdquo;  Duncan said with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swearin&rsquo;!&rdquo; Dan snorted in  disgust. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t call that swearin&rsquo;, do you! Yer might as well have said yer  prayers to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, they&rsquo;d reckon that was  sweerin&rsquo; in Scotland,&rdquo; Duncan replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; and Dan walked up to  Brownie and poured such a torrent of profanity into his woolly ear that the  animal tied himself up in the chains in a frantic effort to escape.</p>
<p>Then the voice of Mrs. McClure  angrily protesting in broad Scotch floated across the yard.</p>
<p>Dan looked across and saw her  shaking her fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The misses is gettin&rsquo; up steam  about somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he remarked, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesna like it when ye sweer  at the horses,&rdquo; Duncan, in a whisper, confided to Dan. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo; releegious,  ye ken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan chuckled, and hopping on the  waggon said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she can make up her mind to  hear plenty of it while I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several seconds Duncan  regarded Dan with an air of amusement, then turning on his heel strode slowly  back to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jingo,&rdquo; he said to Mrs. McClure,  &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll nae tak&rsquo; ony hints. I&rsquo;ll hae tae talk richt at him, I can see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; didna ye talk richt at him  th&rsquo; noo, man?&rdquo; inquired his wife, sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, I couldna be seveere for  th&rsquo; first time,&rdquo; Duncan told her, &ldquo;but if I hae tae speak wi&rsquo; him again I&rsquo;ll no  be sae blate wi&rsquo; him. I&rsquo;ll gie it him!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * * * *</p>
<p>A week went by. And talk about work!  The best horse on the farm could scarcely hold out beside Dan. From one job he  rushed to another without cessation or rest. He mended broken fences, built  pig-sties, cut wood, greased waggon-wheels, oiled harness, thatched  wheat-stacks, constructed a corn-bin, fed horses, pursued strange cattle round  the farm, fixed up swingle-trees, and a score of other miscellaneous jobs, and  then complained to his employer that there wasn&rsquo;t half enough to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoot mon!&rdquo; Duncan said, &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll  kill yoursel&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Dan answered with a  brave sort of smile, &ldquo;work&rsquo;s meat to me, sir, and unless I get a real skinful  of it I&rsquo;m no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ye can owerdae it,&rdquo; Duncan  replied, with a concerned look at Dan, and in truth Dan looked as though he had  already overdone it. His form was visibly shrinking, his cheeks hollow, his  pants clinging to his clammy limbs, and altogether strong symptoms of  exhaustion were upon him. Dan in fact was not in good enough form for this  sudden fit of energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I always believe in givin&rsquo; a  man full value for his money,&rdquo; he gasped. &lsquo;&lsquo;Nothin&rsquo; fer nothin&rsquo; is my motto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dinna yae owerdae it,&rdquo;  Duncan counseled kindly, &ldquo;because if ye was tae kill yoursel&rsquo; I&rsquo;d be wi&rsquo;out a  gude man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that it? I see,&rdquo; and Dan  laughed. &ldquo;Two for yourself and one for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan walked off smiling, while  Dan proceeded to yoke up the plough-team.</p>
<p>It was summer-time, and the flies  were bad. They were worrying the horses and maddening them. They were also  worrying Dan, and making him bad-tempered. He swore savagely at Diamond for  stamping her feet and throwing her head about. Diamond threw her head about and  stamped her feet more; then she aggravated the offence by tramping heavily upon  Dan&rsquo;s big toe when he was in the act of buckling her collar on! Dan erupted like  a volcano. He heaped language, loud and lurid, on the offending head of  Diamond, and punched her on the nose&mdash;punched her till she sat back on her  haunches and made trouble with the harness; then he kicked her in the ribs.  Mrs. McClure, with a dish of food-stuff for the fowls, chanced to cross the  yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye mauna kick th&rsquo; beastie, man,&rdquo;  she shrieked broadly, &ldquo;ye mauna. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll no let ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan glared over the mare&rsquo;s back at  Mrs. McClure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; blank! blank! blank! has  it got to do with you?&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Mind your own business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ma business! An, I&rsquo;ll no  let ye kick th&rsquo; beastie!&rdquo; Mrs. McClure flung back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is, is it?&rdquo; Dan snarled  contemptuously, &ldquo;then at that rate I&rsquo;m not takin&rsquo; any blanky women bosses!  Where&rsquo;s me money?&mdash;I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; and tearing the harness from the horses he threw it  back into the harness-room.</p>
<p>Mrs. McClure hurried away and  apprised Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye shouldna tak&rsquo; nae notice,&rdquo;  Duncan said quietly, &ldquo;ye ken what sorrt women are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By cripes, yes,&rdquo; Dan shouted  excitedly, &ldquo;I do know! and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinna do anythin&rsquo; r-rash,&rdquo; Duncan  said advisedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, boss,&rdquo; and Dan waved  his hands about, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use; when I say I&rsquo;m going from a place I&rsquo;m going, and  I wouldn&rsquo;t stay if you gave me the blooming farm. Where&rsquo;s me money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duncan went away and returned with  a cheque in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, noo, R-Rudd,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if  ye care to change ye&rsquo;re mind and stay on I&rsquo;ll gi&rsquo; you ten shillin&rsquo;s a week  mair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan thought hard for a few  moments, then in a half-hearted sort of way answered: &ldquo;Well, of course, I&rsquo;ve  had no row with you, so for that reason, I don&rsquo;t mind if I stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McClure was delighted, and assured  Dan he would never be interfered with again by Mrs. McClure, and gave him a  free hand to carry on the farm work as he saw fit.</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * * * *</p>
<p>For three months or so Dan carried  on the work of McClure&rsquo;s farm as he saw fit. But Dan didn&rsquo;t see fit to put a  lot of energy into things any more. In that direction Dan started out to  economise. A few calves that had been taking up a little of his time he  promptly knocked on the head then argued the point with his employer. &ldquo;No  farmer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with any brains rears calves these days; it&rsquo;s cheaper to buy  grown-up cattle.&rdquo; McClure went off and thought over the matter in Gaelic.</p>
<p>Next Dan turned to the pig  department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;breedin&rsquo;  your own pigs is rot. What them sows &rsquo;ll eat in a year you&rsquo;ll never make up if  you sell hundreds out of &rsquo;em. The right way an&rsquo; the only way to work pigs is  ter wait til they&rsquo;re down pretty low in th&rsquo; market, then buy up a cheap lot an&rsquo;  fatten &rsquo;em. But them sows&mdash;pshaw! I wouldn&rsquo;t have &rsquo;em about th&rsquo; place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Weel, I havena made sic a lot  oot o&rsquo; th&rsquo;m,&rdquo; McClure observed, as he thoughtfully eyed the ponderous sows  across the sty rails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you never will,&rdquo; Dan said  emphatically, &ldquo;until yer do th&rsquo; way I tell y&rsquo;,&rdquo;</p>
<p>McQure did the way Dan told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; Dan remarked a few  days later, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no bloomin&rsquo; good me tryin&rsquo; to grow good crops if I&rsquo;ve got to  keep on workin&rsquo; th&rsquo; ground with a plough like that one you&rsquo;ve got here.&rdquo; (It  was a good plough, but had no seat on it, and when working it Dan was compelled  to walk a long way in a day.) It&rsquo;s an old-fashioned piece o&rsquo; iron, and must  have been out o&rsquo; date twenty year ago. What we want to do the work that&rsquo;s to be  done here is a four-furrow with a seat on it; a McCronkie, they&rsquo;re the only  ploughs worth having. They cost a bit, o&rsquo; course, but one of &rsquo;em &rsquo;ll pay for itself  in three months. I worked one of &rsquo;em for five or six years,&rdquo; Dan lied in  conclusion.</p>
<p>McQure shook his head, and began  to debate the matter. Where hard cash was to be laid out Duncan was a hard man  to move. But Dan waxed warm, then grew surly on the question of that plough.  And finally he hinted at &ldquo;chucking the whole thing up altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That settled the matter, and  within a week the new McCronkie came along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ech!&rdquo; growled Mrs. McClure to  Duncan, &ldquo;ye shouldna give in tae him. Ye shouldna give it tae him. Ye  shouldna!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, he&rsquo;s a gr-reat chap, ye  ken,&rdquo; Duncan drawled, &ldquo;for havin&rsquo; things r-right up tae date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only one more reform now remained  to be effected, and make Dan happy. A number of spare horses that were kept on  the farm had worried him daily since his arrival. They worried Dan because he  had to feed them like other horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I don&rsquo;t see what you want  with all those bloomin&rsquo; horses,&rdquo; he said to McClure one day, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re no good  to you. I&rsquo;d get rid o&rsquo; them if I were you. Five or six horses is all that&rsquo;s  wanted here, an&rsquo; even that&rsquo;s one too many; besides, I&rsquo;m sick an&rsquo; tired o&rsquo; lookin&rsquo;  at that bloomin&rsquo; lot o&rsquo; rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dang it mon, dinna I get  foals frae them?&rdquo; Duncan said, in surprised tones.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pshaw! foals yer call them?&rdquo; Dan  replied, &ldquo;Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t give yer a quid for th&rsquo; lot o&rsquo; them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye wouldna then!&rdquo; Duncan answered  warmly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; ye wouldna give me fefty queeds for them aither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyone with half an eye can  see they&rsquo;re only in the bloomin&rsquo; road here,&rdquo; Dan persisted stubbornly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; as  I said before, I&rsquo;m sick o&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, are ye noo?&rdquo; Duncan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Dan repeated, with a lofty  wave of his hand, &ldquo;an&rsquo; when I see a farm ain&rsquo;t run in th&rsquo; way to make itself  pay as it ought to, it gets on me nerve,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, an&rsquo; what is it ye would  preepose?&rdquo; Duncan sneered again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I propose to go if y&rsquo; don&rsquo;t  get rid o&rsquo; them horses,&rdquo; Dan said boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel, ye can go tae th&rsquo; de&rsquo;il!&rdquo;  Duncan answered promptly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; here&rsquo;s ye&rsquo;re money.&rdquo; And he handed Dan a cheque.  Dan was knocked all of a heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean <i>that</i>,&rdquo; he said, climbing down like a  politician. &ldquo;Any way, we&rsquo;ll let th&rsquo; horses slide, an&rsquo; say no more about them,  boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vera weel, we willna!&rdquo; Duncan  agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn tae saethin&rsquo; else. Whit way, ye tell me, were ye sleepin&rsquo;  i&rsquo; th&rsquo; corn th&rsquo; maist part o&rsquo; yester forenoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here,&rdquo; Dan snapped savagely,  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to waste time naggin&rsquo; with y&rsquo;. You can give my job to your old  woman. I&rsquo;m off! So long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Dan went.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Dan Takes Another Billet</b></h2>
<p>While the few pounds that he earned  from Duncan McClure lasted Dan lived a lordly and independent life at home. At  sight of the little money, too, his wife cheered up and took a fresh and lively  interest in the home and things around her. She was inspired with renewed  confidence in Dan, and was filled with great hopes of him for the future. And  Dan&rsquo;s plans for the future promised big things. They were the forecasts of  abundance and plenty, the key to veritable gold-mines. According to Dan he and  his wife would one day own half the country, and become the envy and admiration  of the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish&rsquo;d we had some of it just  now,&rdquo; Mrs. Dan murmured, with a far-away look in her eye.&rdquo; If it was only a  undered pounds I&rsquo;d be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you want to go just a little  too fast,&rdquo; Dan admonished gently. &ldquo;Everything can&rsquo;t be done all in a day! But  just you wait a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were interrupted by the  arrival of John Sweeney, a dairyman from the head of the creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I would find you  at home,&rdquo; Sweeney said, entering the door, &ldquo;but I thought I&rsquo;d come down and  see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s just a fluke you did  find me here,&rdquo; Dan said, sliding a gin-case into position for his visitor to  sit on, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve just got home from McClure&rsquo;s (Dan had been home a month)  where I&rsquo;ve been workin&rsquo; this good while. But him an&rsquo; me couldn&rsquo;t hit it&mdash;at  least his old woman and me couldn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s th&rsquo; bloomin&rsquo; boss, and that didn&rsquo;t  suit this child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; Sweeney said, getting  down to the object of his visit, &ldquo;you better come over to my place. I&rsquo;m stuck  badly for a good man that can milk and do a bit o&rsquo; ploughin&rsquo;. And no old woman  to boss you round, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan chuckled, while his wife said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you never got  married yourself, Mr. Sweeney, and you with such a big dairy farm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, no one would have an old fellow  like me,&rsquo;&rsquo; Sweeney answered pleasantly.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Dan didn&rsquo;t agree with  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know s&rsquo; much about that,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not that old yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d have y&rsquo; quick enough, any  amount o&rsquo; them,&rdquo; Dan assured him, &ldquo;but if yer take my advice yer a jolly sight  better off without &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sweeney laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, indeed, if thet ain&rsquo;t  good,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Dan. &ldquo;Do you think &rsquo;e &rsquo;d better off hisself it he weren&rsquo;t  married Mr. Sweeney?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he doesn&rsquo;t mean that, Mrs.  Rudd,&rdquo; Sweeney said, casting a furtive glance around the ill-furnished abode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;d just like to see him  gettin&rsquo; his own meals, an&rsquo; doin&rsquo; his own washin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and Mrs. Dan laughed to her  own satisfaction at the mental picture she drew of her ungainly helpmate acting  as his own cook and laundress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that ain&rsquo;t what I mean,&rdquo;  Dan grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it wer&rsquo; not,&rdquo; and  Mrs. Dan started on the floor with the broom.</p>
<p>Sweeney got down to business  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said to Dan, &ldquo;you come?  I&rsquo;m badly in need of someone. I&rsquo;ll give you twenty-five shillngs a week, and if  there&rsquo;s good returns a share of the profits at the end of the year, for I  always believe in encouraging anyone who works for me to do his best. It&rsquo;s a  lot better for <i>them</i>, and better for  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dan drawled, untruthfully,  &ldquo;I was thinkin&rsquo;, of gettin&rsquo; a bit of a herd together and makin&rsquo; a start for  meself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t do better,&rdquo; Sweeney  answered promptly. Sweeney was one of the few fair-minded men who liked to see  others get along as well as himself. And he added: &ldquo;Have you the cows and  plenty water on your place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not yet,&rdquo; Dan answered  slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got me eye on some, though, and it wouldn&rsquo;t take long to put down  a bore once I got goin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;E was jist talkin&rsquo; about it  when y&rsquo; come to th&rsquo; door,&rdquo; Mrs. Dan chipped in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he couldn&rsquo;t do better,&rdquo;  Sweeney said again, and taking out his pipe waited for Dan&rsquo;s final answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yairs . . . still . . . o&rsquo;  course,&rdquo; came thoughtfully from Dan, as he sat brooding over the proposition.  Then, after a further interval he looked up interrogatingly at his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please yerself about it,&rdquo; she  said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all th&rsquo; same to me what yer do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did yer say&mdash;twenty-five  bob?&rdquo; and Dan looked up at Sweeney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five, that&rsquo;s what I always  give to men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-seven and six I was  gettin&rsquo; from McClure,&rdquo; Dan muttered in an incidental sort of way. Dan had  received a pound a week from McClure.</p>
<p>Sweeney opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Twas a big wage as wages go  now-a-days,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course I worked jolly well  night an&rsquo; day for it,&rdquo; Dan observed casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Worked!</i>&rdquo; Mrs. Dan put in with wifely emphasis, &ldquo; &rsquo;E was as thin as  a rake when &rsquo;e come home, an&rsquo; I sez to him, I sez, if yer had stayed there much  longers you&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; been fetched home in yer coffin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give you twenty-seven  an&rsquo; six,&rdquo; Sweeney said, with business-like decision.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dan regarded her husband with  a look of nervous anxiety. She seemed to have been suddenly filled with a fear  that Dan would hesitate too long and lose the billet. But Dan was in no hurry.  Dan was not a man of excitable temperament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what &rsquo;ll th&rsquo; bonus be?&rdquo; he  asked slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the kind of year we  have; ten pounds, fifteen pounds, perhaps twenty pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dan could scarcely control  herself. She slipped from one side of the room to the other in the hope of  catching her breadwinner&rsquo;s eye and signaling him to accept the job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs,&rdquo; Dan drawled, pensively  hacking the edge of the pine table with a pocket knife, while he looked down  along his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fairest I can offer,&rdquo;  Sweeney added, as he rose from the gin case, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll wager there&rsquo;s no other  man in the district getting as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dan clinched her hands  together anxiously. She seemed to see the beginning of the  gold mine that Dan had planted in her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how am I to know if it&rsquo;s a  good year or not?&rdquo; Dan mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you to know?&rdquo; cried  Sweeney in an injured sort of voice. &ldquo;God bless me, anyone would know! Won&rsquo;t  you be taking th&rsquo; milk to th&rsquo; fact&rsquo;ry every morning yourself, man? And do you  think I would try to make out it was a bad year if it was a good one, just for  the sake of doing a man out of a pound or two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course Mr. Sweeney wouldn&rsquo;t  think of such a thing!&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s wife affirmed positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, some of &rsquo;em do y&rsquo; know!&rdquo;  Dan observed doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say that it has been  done,&rdquo; Sweeney concurred, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d sooner go on to the road and carry me swag  than do it to any man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course y&rsquo; would,&rdquo; from Mrs.  Dan, &ldquo;an&rsquo; &rsquo;e&rdquo; (Dan) &ldquo;knows well thet yer would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know <i>that</i> right enough,&rdquo; slowly from Dan, and without lifting his eyes  or ceasing whittling the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s it to be?&rdquo; said  Sweeney, pressing for a final answer. Dan lifted his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;could&rsquo;n&rsquo; ye  fix th&rsquo; bonus for certain at twenty quid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could <i>not!</i>&rdquo; firmly from Sweeney, &ldquo;for then it would be no inducement for  a man to do his best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d do me best,&rdquo; Dan assured  him. &ldquo;An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s no one can say that I never did me best, no matter what I was  at, bonus or no bonus,&rdquo; and his eyes flashed with the fire and pride of  hypocrisy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say for a moment that you  didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; came from Sweeney, &ldquo;and I wouldn&rsquo;t be here now offering you twenty-seven an&rsquo; six a week if I thought otherwise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no man &rsquo;ll do a better  day&rsquo;s work than I will, I&rsquo;ll swear,&rdquo; and Dan spoke like a man whose honour and  feeling had been mortally wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You misunderstand me, Rudd, oh,  you misunderstand me altogether!&rdquo; cried Sweeney, in an apologetic sort of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By cripes, if I can&rsquo;t do a good  day&rsquo;s work I can&rsquo;t do anything!&rdquo; Dan went on in a sulky manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you could, and a  lot better,&rdquo; said Sweeney, &ldquo;a lot better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m any better,  but I&rsquo;ll swear I&rsquo;m as good, and I don&rsquo;t care whether th&rsquo; man&rsquo;s a boss or what  he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they would all like t&rsquo; get  &rsquo;im to work for them,&rdquo; Mrs. Dan confided aside to the visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so would I, so what is it  to be, Rudd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dunno,&rdquo; indifferently from  Dan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use wasting time, then,&rdquo;  and Sweeney took his leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you edjit of a man!&rdquo; Mrs. Dan  squealed as soon as Sweeney was out of hearing, &ldquo;ter let sich a job as that go  past yer! Yer can&rsquo;t think very much of yer wife an&rsquo; child, so yer can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! hold yer gab!&rdquo; and Dan  rose and followed Sweeney to where his horse was fastened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when would you want me to  come?&rdquo; he called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as ever you can come,  Dan, to-night or tomorrow morning if possible,&rdquo; Sweeney answered as he reached  the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, tomorrow mornin&rsquo;  then,&rdquo; Dan said, and returned to the house, whistling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I could hug yer for takin&rsquo;  it,&rdquo; and Mrs. Dan threw her arms around her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garn! gerrout with yer!&rdquo; and Dan  ducked from her embrace. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get all th&rsquo; muggin&rsquo; I want, from his bloomin&rsquo;  old cows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  Shows His Employer Some Points</b></h2>
<p>Dan went to work at Sweeney&rsquo;s with  avarice at his heart and the light of &ldquo;boodle&rdquo; in his eye. The thoughts of a  twenty-pound bonus at the year&rsquo;s end deprived of sleep and encouraged him to  alter old habits by leaving bed while the stars were yet flickering in the sky.  And soon people noticed that there was a new broom employed at Sweeney&rsquo;s, for  his milk now was first to arrive at the cheese factory, and his milk-cans shone  like a jeweller&rsquo;s window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look alive now, an&rsquo; get a move  on,&rdquo; Dan would shout to the factory hands, &ldquo;shake yerselves up and let me get  out of this! Yer too slow to catch jew-lizards, th&rsquo; whole bloomin&rsquo; lot o&rsquo; you.&rdquo;  And the factory hands would regard Dan with sour, sulky looks, and think  profane things about him. Factory hands, like policemen, don&rsquo;t like to be  pushed about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it you&rsquo;re always in such a  devil of a hurry, there was never any o&rsquo; that about Bilkins?&rdquo; the factory  manager, referring to Dan&rsquo;s predecessor one day, observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, by cripes no! there wasn&rsquo;t  from what I&rsquo;ve seen an&rsquo; heard about him!&rdquo; Dan said, &ldquo;A hundred gallons from  cows was his tally, and then hardly ever fattened a pig or reared a calf! He  suited you chaps though, I suppose. Gave yer nothin&rsquo; much to do, an&rsquo; all day to  do it in. But I&rsquo;ll keep yer hoppin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Dan chuckled. &ldquo;Two hundred an&rsquo; twenty  gallons I&rsquo;ll pour into yer directly, and I&rsquo;ll want back every drop o&rsquo; th&rsquo; whey,  too, to th&rsquo; blanky pint. These other blokes have been gettin&rsquo; all th&rsquo; whey up  to now and bringin&rsquo; no milk to entitle &rsquo;em to it either, any how, not much more  than a bloke could put in his eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The factory manager became  indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a low down  lie! And anyone that don&rsquo;t get all their whey from this factory is to blame  themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s th&rsquo; boss&rsquo;s word I&rsquo;m  goin&rsquo; on,&rdquo; Dan snorted back, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d sooner take his word than yours any day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It pays you to, perhaps!&rdquo;  sneeringly from the factory manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whether it does or whether  it don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dan paused and laughed briefly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop here all day to please  you. Where&rsquo;s me blanky whey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan backed his cart to the  whey-tank and filled the cans. Then he gathered the reins together, and was  pulling out when the factory manager made a discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;how many cans  have you filled there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many d&rsquo; yer think?&rdquo; Dan  snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right! That won&rsquo;t do!  You brought two empties with you, and you&rsquo;re taking them all back full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; Dan growled, whipping up  the horse and indicating a number of suppliers with the whip handle, &ldquo;go and  attend to yer customers an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t keep them hangin&rsquo; round th&rsquo; fact&rsquo;ry all day,  waitin&rsquo; on yer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager clenched his fists,  and yelled a profane send-off to Dan.</p>
<p>Dan swung round on his box seat,  and cheerfully waved his old felt hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot vas kervite right, my man,&rdquo;  said a venerable old German, who supplied milk in a small way, &ldquo;dem pig pugs  dey vants all der vey, efery drop! Mine geracious, yes! I not get some vey for  a veek! I not sell one fat pig! Dere now, you see dot! Huh, my geracious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll stop that gentleman next  time he tries that game on!&rdquo; growled the manager, taking no notice of the old  German.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah, dot vas it, my poy!&rdquo; the  German approved enthusiastically. &ldquo;You shtob him, huh? Oh, mine geracious I  tink so!&rdquo; and he clapped the manager in a valedictory way on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go to th&rsquo; devil, Holstein!&rdquo;  and the manager pulled away angrily, and went off to his office.</p>
<p>Holstein hobbled back to his  milk-cart.</p>
<p>It was Christmas with Sweeney&rsquo;s  pigs when Dan arrived with the cargo of whey. And Dan hung round the sties  admiring the gorgings hogs, and dreaming of results, and the bonus that would  be his at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Sweeney came across and inquired  how the swine were getting along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, <i>now</i>,&rdquo; Dan answered, &lsquo;&lsquo;since they&rsquo;ve been gettin&rsquo; fed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Sweeney went into  calculations on the number fattened for twelve months.</p>
<p>Dan laughed derisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you ought to have fattened  three times that many,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with th&rsquo; milk y&rsquo; should have been gettin&rsquo;.  And what was y&rsquo; gettin? Nothin&rsquo;! I&rsquo;d cut their throats if I couldn&rsquo;t get more  out o&rsquo; them than they&rsquo;ve been givin&rsquo; you. In less than three months I reckon  they&rsquo;ll double it, easy, for me. But of course it&rsquo;ll all be the way I feed  &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sweeney smiled an encouraging sort  of smile, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can coax them to find room  for more than I&rsquo;ve been putting into them, Dan, you&rsquo;re welcome to do it.  Anyway, I&rsquo;ll leave the feeding of them all in your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; Dan answered joyfully,  &ldquo;right you are; and as much as you know about cows, I&rsquo;ll open your eyes in a  week or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sweeney smiled like a proud parent upon Dan,  and strolled off down the paddock.</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * *</p>
<p>Under Dan&rsquo;s particular care and  attention Sweeney&rsquo;s herd, in less than a week, started going up in their milk,  gallon after gallon, bucket after bucket.</p>
<p>Dan smiled triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re givin&rsquo; a drop now,&rdquo; he  said.</p>
<p>Sweeney agreed that they were. And  he proceeded to praise Dan to his face in a way that would have ruined many a  man that wasn&rsquo;t as well-balanced.</p>
<p>A few mornings later Dan said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need to get another can or  two&mdash;perhaps three maybe four, to hold it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sweeney was amazed. He was also  wildly delighted, and if Dan had been a woman nothing could have saved him (or  her). Sweeney would surely have hugged him. As it was he patted him vigorously  on the back as though he were a big, hairy retriever, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have fed cows for the  last twenty years, and, as I thought, fed them well, but after seein&rsquo; what you  can do with them I&rsquo;m satisfied I&rsquo;m only a child at the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; but  regerlarity,&rdquo; Dan said modestly, &ldquo;regerlarity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than that in it,&rdquo;  from Sweeney, who was determined that his servant should have every credit for  his achievement. &ldquo;There must be! there must be! Oh, I know it! I&rsquo;m sure of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; Dan admitted  knowingly, &ldquo;yer&rsquo;ve got to know exactly how much charcoal to put in their water,  an&rsquo; that sort o&rsquo; thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charcoal! I never heard of  charcoal being given to a cow for anything; never in my life.&rdquo; Sweeney  confessed. &ldquo;But of course I knew it was good for pigs, but for cows, never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, an&rsquo; c<i>ows</i>, if yer know how to give it,&rdquo; and Dan grinned mysteriously.</p>
<p>Sweeney&rsquo;s curiosity was aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you give it?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
<p>Dan laughed, and clapping his  employer affectionately on the back, said boastingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you for a  thousand quid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; in surprise from  Sweeney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t, and what&rsquo;s more, if  you was to sit up all night an&rsquo; watch me you wouldn&rsquo;t find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; the other echoed in  increased wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t! But,&rdquo; Dan added, as  a sort of favour, &ldquo;some day, p&rsquo;raps it might pay me to let you into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * * *</p>
<p>The factory manager&rsquo;s eyes opened  wide the morning Dan arrived with a further increase of twenty-five gallons of  milk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boss&rsquo;s cows must be milking  well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or has he added to his herd? &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, bless my soul,&rdquo; Dan  answered, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not milking as many now as we were a fortnight ago.&rdquo; And he  started whistling a popular air as he wrestled with the weighty cans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got some champion cows,  then,&rdquo; the manager further remarked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh, I dunno,&rdquo; Dan drawled,  &ldquo;they&rsquo;re darn well looked after, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s looking after them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan straightened up, and striking  him self hard on the chest, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your humble servant, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The factory manager curled his lip  satirically and mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you look after them as well as  you do the whey I can understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha!&rdquo; merrily from Dan,  concluding with: &ldquo;You makes me smile, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holstein, the aged German  supplier, left his cart and hobbled across to Dan, and stood shaking his head  admiringly at the swag of milk-cans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what th&rsquo; devil&rsquo;s th&rsquo; matter  with you, Bismarck?&rdquo; Dan asked off-handedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pring all of dem gans full  mid milk, my man?&rdquo; Holstein inquired, with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what the blazes else would  you think I&rsquo;d bring them full of?&rdquo; Dan snorted, &ldquo;lager beer, bloomin&rsquo; sausages  or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens sake not, you vool!&rdquo;  and the German strode leisurely back to his cart.</p>
<p>Dan stared after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Top o&rsquo; th&rsquo; morning, Rudd,&rdquo; rang  out in sharp Irish accents. And looking round, Dan recognised Mr. Doolan,  Sweeney&rsquo;s nearest neighbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Dan greeted him,  &ldquo;bringin&rsquo; th&rsquo; milk yerseif this mornin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Doolan, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s not  a great undertaking either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cows not milkin&rsquo; well, eh?&rdquo; from  Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are <i>not</i>, then,&rdquo; emphaticaily from Doolan, &ldquo;and t&rsquo;s not for th&rsquo; want o&rsquo;  plenty good feed. I suppose no other mahn in th&rsquo; district feeds as well as I  do, and yet they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; off&mdash; goin&rsquo; off to th&rsquo; very divil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, his is doin&rsquo; pretty good  just now,&rdquo; Dan remarked, referring to Sweeney&rsquo;s cows, &ldquo;better&rsquo;n they ever did  before, in fact.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see they are,&rdquo; casting an  eye over the cans, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m d&mdash;d if I can say the same for me own!&rdquo; And Doolan  went off into the factory.</p>
<p>Dan bustled about and procured his  just measure of whey. Then seeking the manager he inquired if he &ldquo;had a cheese  cut&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s one there that was cut  yesterday,&rdquo; the manager mumbled sulkily, &ldquo;but whatever you take will have to be  charged up to Mr. Sweeney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! charged up to your  grandmother!&rdquo; Dan answered, making straight for that cheese, &ldquo;I like to hear  yer talkin&rsquo;!&rdquo; Then he hacked off several pounds of the cheese, and stuffing a  plug of it in his mouth and the rest of it in his shirt, observed further,  between munches: &ldquo;You blokes have nothin&rsquo; to do here all day but stuff  yourselves with cheese (munching harder) an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d like to know just for the fun  o&rsquo; th&rsquo; thing who th&rsquo; devil it&rsquo;s all put down to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; the manager roared,  pointing his finger dramatically at the big front door, &ldquo;you clear out of this  factory!&rdquo; Dan stuffed another plug of cheese into his mouth, and holding it in  his jaw grunted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to get  now, anyhow, whether I like it or not. What&rsquo;s th&rsquo; blanky time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The factory manager, as though to  prevent himself doing Dan bodily harm, turned impulsively away and walked on.</p>
<p>Dan pulled ugly faces at his  retreating figure, then left the factory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strong as mustard, that fellow!&rdquo;  the factory manager said angrily when Dan had gone.</p>
<p>Doolan inquired what he meant.</p>
<p>The factory manager explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very best man in the  district!&rdquo; Doolan told him, standing up for Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, that crawler?&rdquo; cried the  manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That very same gentleman,&rdquo;  impressively from Doolan. &ldquo;And Sweeney tells me,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that there never  was the likes of him to feed cattle, or to milk them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The factory manager admitted that  Sweeney&rsquo;s milk supply had gone up wonderfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oi never did hear the likes of  it!&rdquo; Doolan said. &ldquo;never did! Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * *</p>
<p>The work and worry entailed  keeping Sweeney&rsquo;s cows up to concert pitch began to tell on Dan. He started to  waste, and looked as poor as wood. He wore the appearance of a man who never  went to bed, but spent the nights in dissipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever go to sleep at all,  Dan?&rdquo; Sweeney asked him one day, &ldquo;or do you sit up all night feeding the cows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; Dan replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just  the very cove that does sleep, now, too jolly much sometimes,&rdquo; and he dodged  hurriedly off down the yard. Dan showed a secret reluctance to be questioned on  his sleeping habits. There were times when Dan was of a most sensitive  disposition.</p>
<p>Just then Doolan came riding into  the yard with a sad, sorrowful look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s th&rsquo; matter with you?&rdquo;  Sweeney inquired of him. &ldquo;You look as if you had been left with a corpse on  your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be left with nothing on my  hands soon, the way my cows are milking!&rdquo; Doolan answered.</p>
<p>Sweeney laughed, and asked if he  had &ldquo;tried feeding them?&rdquo; Doolan worked up a sickly sort of laugh, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know d&mdash;d well I have!&rdquo; Then  added: &ldquo;But I think this man you have here can show me a wrinkle, and that&rsquo;s  what has brought me over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can if he <i>will</i>,&rdquo; Sweeney agreed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve not been able to learn anything  from him myself. I know he gives them charcoal, and that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Charcoal!</i>&rdquo; Doolan exclaimed, &ldquo;I never heard of cows taking  charcoal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor me!&rdquo; from Sweeney, &ldquo;but he  gives it to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doolan was perplexed.</p>
<p>Dan appeared in sight, and Sweeney  hailed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Doolan wants to know  something about feeding cows,&rdquo; he said with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Doolan put in quickly.  Then proceeded to put a number of questions to Dan.</p>
<p>Dan looked wise, and shaking his  head, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! if I was doin&rsquo; th&rsquo; feedin&rsquo;  for you myself I&rsquo;d send them up in the fluid pretty quick. But (pausing) yer  see they&rsquo;re in different hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t ye give me a hint what  to do?&rdquo; Doolan pleaded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you handsomely for the information. I&rsquo;m not a  mean man like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan shook his head and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I refused the same thing to  the boss here,&rdquo; then walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heavens now,&rdquo; cried Doolan in  a rage, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out what he does whether he likes it or not, and won&rsquo;t pay  him anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind finding out what  he does myself,&rdquo; Sweeney mumbled gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then join me this vera night, and  we&rsquo;ll watch him!&rdquo; suggested Doolan quickly.</p>
<p>Sweeney said he would.</p>
<p>Doolan winked a determined sort of  wink, and rode away.</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * *</p>
<p>That very night Doolan and Sweeney  hid themselves away in an old hay-stack, like a pair of criminals hiding from  the law, and silently kept watch over Dan&rsquo;s sleeping quarters. For several  long, weary hours they waited for him to turn out and commence feeding the  milkers&mdash;waited till their limbs became cramped, and stiff and cold. At last  they heard a noise as of someone moving stealthily about; next minute the  coated form of Dan with a string of milk-cans slung about him, issued full into  the moonlight.</p>
<p>Doolan nudged Sweeney; Sweeney  nudged Doolan.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Tis him!&rdquo; Doolan whispered, his  heart beating fast with the joy of anticipation.</p>
<p>Dan moved across the yard, and  what seemed surprising, crawled through the fence on to the main road. Doolan  and Sweeney left their hiding-place and followed cautiously.</p>
<p>Dan crawled through another fence  and entered Doolan&rsquo;s grass paddock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo; where&rsquo;s he going!&rdquo;  Doolan whispered in surprise, &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t be going to feed them at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sweeney was puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a strange cove!&rdquo; he mumbled  under his breath.</p>
<p>They also entered Doolan&rsquo;s  paddock.</p>
<p>Dan kept a straight course, and  swung along smartly through the long, dewy grass. Doolan and Sweeney were  almost compelled to run to keep him in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s gone stark, staring  mad!&rdquo; Doolan gasped, pausing for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or else he&rsquo;s walking in his  sleep,&rdquo; from Sweeney, in tones of sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a mind to yell out to him!&rdquo;  Doolan whispered, as they started in pursuit again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, let him go a while longer,&rdquo;  Sweeney advised, &ldquo;whatever secret he has, perhaps he plants it over here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan went a while longer. He went  until he came across Doolan&rsquo;s herd of milkers snugly camped in a warm corner of  the paddock. Then he put down the surplus buckets, and kicking up one of the  herd sat beneath her and commenced on her with both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swish-h! swish-h!&rdquo; went the milk  into the bucket like a waterfall. &ldquo;Swish-h-h-h.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doolan and Sweeney stood and  stared as though there was a ghost before them. Once only did they shift their  eyes, and then only to look at each other. They stood like fixtures in the  ground, and all the time Dan, sitting with his back to them, made headway with  the &ldquo;swishing&rdquo; act. Several times Doolan&rsquo;s mouth opened wide to the moonlight  and snapped shut like a spring trap. Then his blood suddenly started to  circulate. He made a sign to Sweeney not to move, and looking round lifted a  stick fit to slay a horse with, and started to creep up behind Dan. Sweeney  then seemed to come to his senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! my God, no!&rdquo; he broke out,  springing upon Doolan to avert a tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go of me! Yah-h s-s-s-s. Let  go-h! Oh-h-h!&rdquo; roared Doolan like forty devils upon the still night. The herd  bounded to its feet. Dan bounded to his. And while Doolan struggled with  Sweeney and Sweeney struggled with Doolan, Dan ran as man never ran before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely yer ain&rsquo;t left Mr. Sweeney  a&rsquo; ready?&rdquo; his wife cried as Dan entered the door of the home again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! left him!&rdquo; Dan said,  throwing himself full length on the sofa, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner work for a <i>blackfellow!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  When Uncle Died</b></h2>
<p>Uncle (Dan&rsquo;s Uncle Peter) fell ill one day and took to his old  bag bed. He took to it until Sandy and Kate, with whom he had lived for many  years, carried him from it, and placed him in their own. They placed him in  their own because it was softer, and bigger and better and a lot more  respectable than the one he had been used to; besides, if he were to die they  thought he would make a more attractive corpse on a good bed. The respect and  humanity that people desire to show their fellow-being when they are dead  almost surpasses the understanding. For months Sandy and Kate watched over Uncle,  caring for him, nursing him as tenderly as though he were a member of the Royal  Family. It was hard on them, poor souls! sitting by the smouldering fire  through the silences of those long, long nights, watching, hoping for a change  for the better, and responding tirelessly to every moan, every murmur. And all  this after working hard throughout the live-long day, too!</p>
<p>Morning after morning some of the  neighbours would call, and in a kindly way repeat the old, old inquiry. And  ever hopeful, Sandy always fancied that Uncle seemed a little better.</p>
<p>Of an evening, after supper, Mrs.  O&rsquo;Riley would drop in; and in a kind, motherly way talk to Kate, and coax her  to go and lie down for a while and rest herself. And when Kate, having taken  her advice, would drop off to sleep on the sofa, Mrs. O&rsquo;Riley would sit through  the night with Sandy, and do all there was to be done. A kind, big-hearted  woman was Mrs. O&rsquo;Riley.</p>
<p>And thus the nursing of Uncle was carried on.</p>
<p>It was approaching sundown one  evening, with a sky dappled over with flakes of fugitive clouds all tinted with  gold, when Kate rushed out to the barn and called anxiously for Sandy. Sandy  abandoned the work he was engaged in, and ran to meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and see him!&rdquo; Kate cried in  tones of alarm. &ldquo;I think he has taken a turn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy hurried back to the sick  chamber and softly and silently bent over the wasted invalid. Lifting the frail  hand which hung over the bed he asked Uncle how he felt.</p>
<p>A feeble murmur was all the  response.</p>
<p>Sandy turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of him?&rdquo; Kate,  pale and apprehensive, whispered.</p>
<p>Sandy shook his head, and thought things  to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you go for a doctor?&rdquo;  Kate suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;d be as well,&rdquo; Sandy  said slowly; then he looked at the invalid again, and fell into fresh thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should consider  the cost,&rdquo; Kate whispered, reading what was in Sandy&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll manage to  pay off the bill somehow. It won&rsquo;t matter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I better go,&rdquo; and Sandy ran out  and saddled a horse. Then, when he had bolted a cup of tea and mouthful of  bread, and tied a clean handkerchief round his neck he started for town&mdash; thirty  miles away.</p>
<p>A long, lonely ride it was to town  too, and when Sandy entered the main street all was in darkness. Sandy knew  almost nothing of the town, and where to find a doctor he hadn&rsquo;t the slightest  idea. No one was to be seen about&mdash;the town was in bed so he dismounted from the  tired horse, and hammered on the shutters of the nearest establishment. He  repeated the hammering several times before receiving any response. The flicker  of a light flashed through a glass panel, and a man, half dressed and scarcely  half sober, holding a lantern in his hand, appeared in bad humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah! this ain&rsquo;t th&rsquo; &mdash; doctor&rsquo;s!&rdquo;  he growled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s round th&rsquo; corner, there! This is th&rsquo; undertaker&rsquo;s. And if yer  don&rsquo;t want a darn coffin, wot do yer want huntin&rsquo; me out for? There&rsquo;s plenty of  &rsquo;em waitin&rsquo; here!&rsquo; He flashed the lantern over the establishment, and Sandy&rsquo;s  eyes encountered numbers of coffins of all sizes, waiting, yawning, with the  lids off, for tenants.</p>
<p>Sandy shuddered, and with a sickly  feeling at his heart turned away. He was mounting his horse again, when a  policeman in a heavy top coat strolled along. He was a friendly sort of  officer, and after a word or two, accompanied Sandy to the doctor&rsquo;s door and  pulled the bell that roused the medico from bed.</p>
<p>The doctor invited Sandy to step  inside, where he listened attentively to him. He inquired Uncle&rsquo;s age, how long  he had been ill, and all about him in general. Sandy explained Uncle&rsquo;s  condition as well as he could&mdash;as well as the tears that came into his eyes, and  the lump that rose in his throat would allow.</p>
<p>The doctor placed his hand on  Sandy&rsquo;s shoulder, and said: &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you worry, I&rsquo;ll give you some medicine  to take back with you, and he&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A heavy load, then, was lifted  from Sandy&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Handing Sandy a bottle of  medicine, the doctor said further: &ldquo;As soon as you reach home give him a  tablespoonful, and repeat every two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy, who was not well versed in  the classification of spoons and things, wondered if &ldquo;they had the sort of  spoon at home.&rdquo; The doctor produced one of the kind he meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yairs, oh yairs!&rdquo; Sandy said,  stuffing the medicine into his pocket. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he doesn&rsquo;t show any  improvement, say by noon tomorrow,&rdquo; the doctor said, opening the door to pass  Sandy into the street, &ldquo;let me know, and I&rsquo;ll come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy said he would; then mounting  his horse again turned its head for home and rode hard.</p>
<p>The cocks were crowing, and the  feeble light of the waning moon fast disappearing when Sandy reached the rails.  Dismounting, he threw the saddle on the ground, and leaving the horse to find  its way to the grass-paddock, hurried into the house with the medicine in his  hand.</p>
<p>Kate and Mrs. O&rsquo;Riley met him at  the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he now?&rdquo; Sandy asked in a  low voice.</p>
<p>For a moment neither spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gone</i>,&rdquo; Kate said at last, and sorted to sob.</p>
<p>Sandy tried to speak, but his  voice failed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;he&rsquo;s&mdash;<i>dead!</i>&rdquo; Kate murmured, and she continued to sob til Mrs. O&rsquo;Riley,  putting her arms about her, and drawing her to the sofa, sat beside her and  soothed her with words of comfort and kindness.</p>
<p>Sandy moved into the  death-chamber, and stood gazing upon the lifeless form of Uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old chap!&rdquo; he muttered, and  turning away sunk heavily into a chair. Then with elbows resting on his knees,  his head bowed, his eyes fixed on the floor, he sat and reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well!&rdquo; came consolingly from  Mrs. O&rsquo;Riley, &ldquo;his troubles are all over now, poor man; and perhaps he&rsquo;s better  off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Uncle!&rdquo; Kate sobbed  aloud, &ldquo;he had a hard-life, and oh, I do wish we had been more considerate and  kind to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t now, there&rsquo;s a good girl!&rdquo;  Mrs. O&rsquo;Riley said. &ldquo;No one, I&rsquo;m sure, could have been kinder to your Uncle than  you were and everyone knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped, Kate!&rdquo; Sandy  murmured, &ldquo;we did all we could for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate wiped the tears from her eyes  with her apron, and made an effort to pull herself together. Then remembering  that Sandy had had nothing to eat for many long hours she hurried off to set  the table in the little rude kitchen.</p>
<p>But Sandy was not hungry, and  could only sip the tea.</p>
<p>Then with Mrs. O&rsquo;Riley they sat  waiting together for daylight, and in low tones talking of all that was  required to be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go first and tell Dad,&rdquo;  Kate said, looking compassionately at Sandy, and he can send someone to tell Dan  and all the others. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go to the store for a few little things,  too. We&rsquo;ll want some crepe, or black merino if they haven&rsquo;t any. Then there&rsquo;s  the coffin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richardson &rsquo;ll do that!&rdquo; Sandy  said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll get Smith to help with the grave!&rdquo; And at this, despite Kate&rsquo;s  resolution to be brave, a fresh flood of tears burst from her, and she sobbed  hard again.</p>
<p>Then the cocks started crowing,  and daylight streamed in through the cracks in the walls of the rough wooden  kitchen.</p>
<p>With bridle on arm Sandy proceeded  to the grass paddock for the horse again, tramping through grass as high as his  head, and ringing wet with dew.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing else,&rsquo;&rsquo; Kate said,  when he was ready to start, &ldquo;except to tell Sarah to come if she can. And get  yourself a black hat at the store.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * *</p>
<p>They received a great shock at  Shingle Hut when Sandy arrived with news of Uncle&rsquo;s death. There had been no  deaths in the family before, and Dad couldn&rsquo;t understand it now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m d&mdash;d!&rdquo; he said, and &ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t tell me <i>that!</i>&rdquo; And he folded  his arms and walked thoughtfully about the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go over at once,&rdquo; he cried,  and ordered the horses to be put in the buggy.</p>
<p align="center">* *  * * * * *</p>
<p>Far and wide the news of Uncle&rsquo;s  death was carried in a few hours, and by nightfall it had almost reached the  other end of the earth.</p>
<p>Next day people left their work,  and in traps, carts, drays, and upon horseback and &ldquo;footback&rdquo; rolled up to  attend the funeral. They gathered silently at the fence, about the barn, and  around the door of the house, and waited reverently. They sympathised with Kate  and Dad, and Sandy, and Sarah and all the rest of the relations, and inquired  if there was anything they could do to lighten the load of sorrow. But there  was little left to be done, for from early morning the house had been filled  with eager, willing hands.</p>
<p>Dan was the last of the relatives  to arrive. With, firm, resolute strides he walked into the death-chamber, and,  gazing momentarily upon the shrunken face of the sleeper, said: &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! he&rsquo;s dead  orright. I never see anyone look deader &rsquo;n <i>that</i> though at any time, at th&rsquo; best o&rsquo; times, he was never what you&rsquo;d call a goin&rsquo;  concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate standing by shuddered.</p>
<p>Dan went out again, and accosting  Sandy, who was mooning about in a sad, sorrowful sort of way, inquired what was  the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s n-nothin&rsquo; up with m-me,  Dan,&rdquo; Sandy answered gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Dan grunted, &ldquo;why th&rsquo; devil  don&rsquo;t yer wake up. Anyone &rsquo;d think it was <i>your</i> blanky funeral, be th&rsquo; look o&rsquo; yer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a big blow to us!&rdquo;  Sandy murmured, &ldquo;to lose the ol&rsquo; chap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blow to yer! Pshaw! talk sense!&rdquo;  Dan said. &ldquo;A blanky boon, I&rsquo;d reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;dunno, Dan,&rdquo; Sandy drawled  meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why bless me, he was on&rsquo;y in his  own bloomin&rsquo; way, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Dan interrogated, cold-bloodedly. &ldquo;But what are  y&rsquo; goin&rsquo; to do with him, anyhow? Who&rsquo;s diggin&rsquo; th&rsquo; hole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy explained the burial  arangements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Dan grunted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down  then and lend a hand to put it down a foot or two deeper. Better to make a good  job o&rsquo; <i>that</i> part of it. Sometimes  they get out again, y&rsquo; know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan jumped on his horse then, and  made for the cemetery. A feeble old man, with long, grey hair, came tottering  along with the aid of a crook stick and went inside. He was the clergyman.</p>
<p>Beneath the shade of the  wire-fence Bill Saunders talked entertainingly to a group of sombre-looking  souls about the funerals of &ldquo;early days&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Dan came galloping back from the  cemetery, and, reining up at the door in military fashion, called out to Sandy:  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some water at the bottom of it, about eighteen inches, but that won&rsquo;t  matter, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy came out and pulled a long  face and was about to turn and consult the rest of the family, when Dan, like a  general addressing his army, called to the people gathered about: &ldquo;Now, line  up, and make a start.&rdquo; They lined up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to take the  coffin on?&rdquo; Saunders, who was to drive the hearse, inquired of Dan. &ldquo;On a dray,  or a buggy, or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On none o&rsquo; them things,&rdquo; Dan  answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take him in that German waggon of Holstein&rsquo;s. And,&rdquo; he added,  &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be frightent to drive it, Bill. Crawlin&rsquo; along a road with a corpse is a  lot o&rsquo; rot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it is, too,&rdquo; Saunders  replied, as he hurried off to take charge of Holstein&rsquo;s waggon and pair.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the remains of  Uncle were carried out and placed in the German waggon. Then taking the reins,  Saunders climbed on board and the funeral started. It was a long funeral&mdash;the longest that had  ever been seen at Sleepy Creek.</p>
<p>The hearse moved slowly along  until all the vehicles and horsemen had dropped into place. Then Saunders stood  up in the waggon, and, with one foot on the coffin to steady it, applied the  whip to Holstein&rsquo;s pair of bays. The hearse jumped off at great speed Bump!  bump! rattle! rattle! over ruts, gullies, dead timber, stones, and down long,  steep cuttings! For a while it resembled a locomotive that had broken the  couplings and left the carriages behind. Then disorder broke out in the ranks.  First one, then another, and another, and another, and another, left the line,  and, under the whip, started in pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Christmas!&rdquo; Dan cried,  spurring his horse to keep in sight, &ldquo;he never had a ride like that when he was  alive, I&rsquo;ll swear,&rdquo; and old O&rsquo;Riley, bumping about in the bottom of his trap,  yelled: &ldquo;Oh, be jabers, but this do beat th&rsquo; Darby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hoary, weary-looking old traveller,  resting in the middle of the road, fled at sight of the funeral&rsquo;s approach, and  rolled himself under a fence for safety.</p>
<p>Dan, in a loud, hilarious voice,  called attention to the affrighted wayfarer as the cortege raced past.</p>
<p>But at last the hearse came to a  standstill before the gate of the secluded burial ground&mdash;a thickly timbered  spot hidden in a hollow of the bushland and fenced with a two-rail fence. Only  a few graves as yet were there, and the apple-trees that waved above were  fragrant with bloom, and from the boughs clusters of parrots screamed a  welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better wait till they all come  up,&rdquo; Saunders said to Dan. Dan laughed and answered: &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take some of &rsquo;em all  night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mine Gott!&rdquo; old Holstein  protested to Saunders, &ldquo;you drife too hard, mein friend! too hard altergadder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plase God we&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; O&rsquo;Riley  said, crawling down out of his trap. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis a mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dad and Sandy and Dave and  Dan and Saunders and some more took the coffin on their shoulders, and carried  it to the grave. The others bared their heads and followed in slow procession.  Ah, with all, it was a sad scene. They crowded around the open grave. The  coffin was lowered slowly to the bottom. The parrots in the boughs ceased their  screaming.</p>
<p>In feeble, faltering voice the  clergyman pronounced the words: &ldquo;Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.&rdquo; Dad and Sandy  and Kate and Dave and Joe leaned over and for the time rested their eyes on the  shell that held the remains of Uncle. Then the shovels rattled and rang, and  the earth rolled in, and rose and rose till only a new-made mound was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When <i>I</i> peg out,&rdquo; Dan said, throwing down the shovel, &ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;ll be  none o&rsquo; this humbug about me. Sling me up into the fork of a blanky tree, that&rsquo;ll  be enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the sun dipped down behind  the ranges, and day died out. Night birds hooted and whooped from the shades of  the eerie scrub; the curlews wailed in the long, rank grass; the wild dogs  howled down the mountain gorges, and all kept tryst round that lonely little  country burial ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Shearing Championship</b></h2>
<p>The great shearing match for the  world&rsquo;s championship and a purse of sovereigns, that had been boomed and par&rsquo;d  and puffed for many months, had just taken place in the city, and the  newspapers were full of accounts of the contest.</p>
<p>Country people, denied the chance  of witnessing the match, hastened to the local railway station and awaited  eagerly the arrival of the papers. And when the train brought them in a large  bundle they scrambled for them, and, tearing the wrappers away, scanned the  columns excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fitzgerald!&rdquo; they cried, when the  name in large, startling black letters met their eye, &ldquo;Fitzgerald wins by ten  sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me that!&rdquo; Dan said, looking over the shoulder of old  Tom, the publican.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tell it t&rsquo; ye at all;  &rsquo;tis here!&rsquo;&rsquo; Tom answered; then continued to peruse his bit of print in selfish  silence.</p>
<p>Dan, who was the only one without  a paper, stood waiting for more particulars, and gazing from one to another.</p>
<p>Johnny O&rsquo;Dea, sitting alone at one  end of the platform with his head buried in a Gazette broke out into a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that, Johnny?&rdquo; Dan  cried, dancing to Johnny&rsquo;s side, &ldquo;what does it say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny slavishly spelt aloud for  Dan&rsquo;s information: &ldquo;Seeing his opponent let go the first sheep a few seconds in  advance of him, Malone ceased shearing, and looking up, said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,  old man, take all the lead you can while you&rsquo;re fresh, you won&rsquo;t have time to  think of it directly.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan laughed heartily, and said:  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Malone to a T. I can just imagine Paddy sayin&rsquo; it. He was always  giggin&rsquo; me when I was shearin&rsquo; against him at Billybong and Wakakallabong, and  them places. &lsquo;Take a bit of a lead old man, while you&rsquo;re fresh.&rsquo; A great old  gag of his!&rdquo; And Dan again laughed his appreciation of Paddy Malone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis, but he got dem well walloped  fer all o&rsquo; that!&rsquo;&rsquo; Johnny O&rsquo;Dea said aggressively. &ldquo;Huh! so he did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would seem, eh!&rdquo; Dan said  seriously, almost pathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hoh! Oh, hoh! Oh, hoh!&rdquo;  excitedly from old Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Tom, eh?&rdquo; and Dan  pranced back to the side of the public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be th&rsquo; powers, they vera nearly  had a fight,&rdquo; and Tom threatened to go into hysterics with merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me that!&rdquo;  excitedly from Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do tell it to you, I tell you!&rdquo;  and this time Tom read aloud for Dan&rsquo;s benefit. When it came to the end of the  passage Dan hit himself on the knee and exclaimed wildly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good man, Paddy! and you take it  from me he&rsquo;s just the man that can use them! (Dan had never been nearer than a  thousand miles of Malone in his life.) Don&rsquo;t I know it, too, by crikey I do. It  took me all my time one day at Curramungarallabah to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But &rsquo;twas Fitzgerald who was  goin&rsquo; to biff Malone, man, can&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; old Tom interrupted.</p>
<p>Dan twisted his eye-brows about,  and peering hard at the back of the paper, said he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t catch it quite&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without attempting any further  explanation Tom read on quietly to himself while Charlie Hunt and the local  banker, sharing the same sheet, began to chuckle.</p>
<p>Dan skipped across to them. &ldquo;What  was that, Charlie?&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;any more punchin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One on &rsquo;em, it sez,&rdquo; Charlie  informed him, &ldquo;took th&rsquo; tail right off er a bloomin&rsquo; sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it was only a tail that was  taken off Dan seemed disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he grumbled,  &ldquo;I took th&rsquo; head off an ole yoe one day at Weelawandabingee when I was givin&rsquo; a  New Zealand chap a go to see who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he was interrupted by the  voice of the publican announcing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fitzgerald shore sixty-nine sheep  in three hours, and Malone fifty-seven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo; Dan cried, making his  way back to Tom. Tom read out the figures again; then going into calculations on  his own account remarked: &ldquo;That would be at the rate of a hundred and  eighty-four a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred and eighty-four a day!&rdquo;  Dan echoed disparagingly. &ldquo;What th&rsquo; diggin&rsquo;s were they shearin&rsquo;&mdash;<i>cows?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair sized wethers, it says,&rdquo; the  public answered. &ldquo;Supplied for the purpose by the owner of Nelanjie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, y&rsquo; must be makin&rsquo; a bloomer  about th&rsquo; figures!&rdquo; Dan growled stubbornly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s what it says, here,  too,&rdquo; Johnny O&rsquo;Dea called out in support of old Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knock me end-ways, then!&rdquo; Dan  snarled, spitting right across on to the goods-shed platform, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put that  many through with the <i>shears</i> before  breakfast! &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you put that many  through now, Dan, with the machines, or even half of it,&rdquo; said the publican,  &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a pot o&rsquo; money to be made be backin&rsquo; you, for listen here (reading  from the paper): &ldquo;When spoken to after the match Fitzgerald declared his willingness  to shear against any man in the world for &pound;300 aside and the championship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shear Fitz,&rdquo; Dan said  resolutely and confidently, &ldquo;any time he likes, anywhere he likes, and for any  blanky sum he likes to name,&rdquo; and jerking his head over his shoulder he spat on  to the goods-shed roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>will?</i>&rdquo; said the publican, with loot in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shear for his shirt!&rdquo; Dan  repeated with emphasis.</p>
<p>Others of the company having read all  they wished to read gathered round and concentrated their attention on Dan.</p>
<p>The local banker said, addressing  Dan: &ldquo;Have you ever met Fitzgerald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan promptly lied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Met him!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should  think I have! I suppose, if I&rsquo;ve shorn against Fitzy at one shed I&rsquo;ve shorn  against him a thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be a good man,&rdquo; the  banker observed, with real admiration for the champion.</p>
<p>Dan laughed one of those short,  sneery laughs that damn more than faint praise, and said: &ldquo;Look here, I&rsquo;ve seen  learners, mere kids at th&rsquo; game, who Fitz couldn&rsquo;t make sweat. I don&rsquo;t reckon  he can shear any&mdash;now, that&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; you straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does he come to be a champion  then?&rdquo; the banker asked sceptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Dan replied, &ldquo;but  the last time I met Fitz on the boards was at Muckamundaboobee, just before I  come in here. And let me tell you this (Dan waved his arms about), th&rsquo;  Muckamundaboobee mob was a lot o&rsquo; horny wethers wrinkly as a concertina and  rotten to th&rsquo; toes with grass seed and prickly pear. I had a bad hand, too, to  start with&mdash;I hurt it spreadin&rsquo; a cove out at Dillybong, and could hardly hold a  machine. Well, with all that chucked in, s&rsquo;elp me, if Fitz could make me raise  a sweat. Th&rsquo; first half-dozen or so he <i>did</i> let go fairly fast, but from that out I was doing nothing but slingin&rsquo; belly  wool to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Tom punched his left palm  jubilantly with his right fist, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will ye take him on, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him on!&rdquo; and Dan this time  spat right over the goods-shed, &ldquo;I tell y&rsquo;. Tom, I&rsquo;ll shear him one hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publican&rsquo;s thoughts semed to  be travelling very fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be a water-melon to me,&rdquo; Dan  remarked in the interim, and the little crowd gazed in wonder upon him.</p>
<p>After a bit the publican came to a  definite decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much could you put up  yourself, Dan?&rdquo; he inquired in firm, business-like tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve a couple of quid here  to say I can wallop Fitz whenever he&rsquo;s got a day to spare.&rdquo; And Dan slapped his  empty trouser-pocket very hard and convincingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be hivens, I&rsquo;ve a mind to back  you,&rdquo; and old Tom looked interrogatingly at the banker. The banker was the  person who had charge of Tom&rsquo;s account, which was no mean one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if y&rsquo; do,&rdquo; Dan put it, &ldquo;you&rsquo;l  be pickin&rsquo; up three hundred quid, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; And he grinned a seductive sort  of grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye think I can stand it?&rdquo; Tom  said in a pretending sort of way to the banker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think the bank would trust you,&rdquo;  the other drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over to my place and we&rsquo;ll  have a chat,&rdquo; and grabbing Dan by the shoulder Tom led him across to the pub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see Brown back that  chap and drop his three hundred;&rdquo; the banker remarked feelingly; then strode  off, paper in hand, to his office. Bankers have a particular way, sometimes, of  sharing their sympathy and loyalty to customers.</p>

  Before the Battle</b></h2>
<p>A week later.</p>
<p align="center" class="note">SHEARING  CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE WORLD</p>
<p align="center" class="note">FITZGERALD&rsquo;S  CHALLENGE ACCEPTED</p>
<p>was the announcement made in the  newspaper one morning, in large, exciting headlines. Then underneath:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;A shearing match for the  championship of the world and a wager of &pound;300 has been arranged to take place  between Fitzgerald, who recently defeated Malone, and Dan Rudd, of Saddletop.  The agreement was completed last evening between the parties and the contest is  to take place at the Great Palladium in a month&rsquo;s time. The enterprising  manager speaks of this match as likely to create a draw that will be something  approaching the sensational, as Rudd, who is the ringer of the West, claims to  hold an unbeaten record in any class sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that moment Dan became a hero  of the first rank. The local township rose up and accepted him at his own  value. His name was in the paper! They had read it. Nothing could be nobler.  Mortal couldn&rsquo;t achieve anything greater&mdash;anything grander. Beach, Trumper,  Messenger, Ned Kelly, Carbine, and all the cream-testers and pig-buyers were  dead now, and buried.</p>
<p>The storekeeper, representing the  feeling of his customers, welcomed Dan&rsquo;s entrance to his shop in words of joy  and jubilation. He shook hands with him, too, across the counter, and thrilled  at the touch of his big, brown hand. He thrilled some more when the hero looked  calmly round at the wares and spoke of a &ldquo;decent suit o&rsquo; clobber,&rdquo; and  cheerfully charged the price of it up to him, with a reckless disregard of the  fact that the credit of Daniel Damascus Rudd had long enough been stopped, and  stopped at the point of a Petty Debts judgment that in due official course had  been returned endorsed <i>Nulla Bona</i> by  the bailif, together with that genial gentleman&rsquo;s humble account for &ldquo;mileage,  service of summons, levy fee, etc.,&rdquo; an account which the storekeeper himself  paid by cash, and with bad grace, and many loud misgivings on the rottenness of  the law and the folly of litigation.</p>
<p>The village blacksmith, too, and  the local station-master took Dan between them and walked him across to the  pub, where they drank to his health, and success, and to the health and success  of his backer, who leaned and breathed heavily on the bar-counter, and  smilingly tossed them back their bit of change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope you win, old man,&rdquo; they  said, putting down their empty glasses and clapping Dan warmly on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you deserve success, too,  Tom,&rdquo; they added, addressing boniface, &ldquo;for you&rsquo;re a game &rsquo;un, there&rsquo;s no doubt  about it. The district should be proud of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m backing a good horse,&rdquo;  Tom told them, running his eye proudly over the form of the idol. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve  tied him down strictly to soft rations until it&rsquo;s all over. Hard stuff is no  good to train on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My oath, it ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dan agreed, at  the same instant bestowing a look upon the half-drained glass of ginger-beer  lingering long and sadly in his hand that convicted him of perjury.</p>
<p>And the ever recurring commercial  traveller stepping from the train with his pretentious swag of leather bags and  gorgeous rugs was filled with excitement for the shearing match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This chap Rudd who&rsquo;s taking on Fitzgerald  belongs here, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he said to the storekeeper.</p>
<p>With much local patriotism in his  eye the storekeeper answered in the affirmative, adding enthusiastically: &ldquo;Do  you see that tall fellow over there swinging his arms about talking to those  two coves on the pub verandah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The commercial, after squinting  hard through a pair of magnificent gold-rim glasses that obscured his sight  said he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s him, that&rsquo;s th&rsquo;  chap, that&rsquo;s Dan,&rdquo; responded the storekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is <i>that</i> the fellow?&rdquo; And the man of many leather bags spoke with a  voice deep with interest and curiosity. &ldquo;He looks a strapping chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my word, ain&rsquo;t he just!&rdquo; the  storekeeper enthused. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fearfully&mdash;<i>frightfully</i> strong fellow. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe what he can lift! I&rsquo;ve seen him take things  and lift them into a dray&mdash;things that&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;well, that you and me together  couldn&rsquo;t lift an inch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; and the commercial again  squinted in the direction of Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gum, yes!&rdquo; the storekeeper,  with whom it was a mental effort to express himself freely, said &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a  terribly, awfully powerful fellow. Do you know what&mdash; now, I tell y&rsquo; what we&rsquo;ve  seen him do here&mdash;seen him <i>ourselves</i>,  mind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man of samples cocked his ears  and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know those coils of heavy  barb wire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We supply them,&rdquo; the commercial  said, &ldquo;and can do you a cheap line now if you&rsquo;re out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s come in here and  picked one of them up, oh, just as if it was air, and threw it up to the roof  and caught it again, and flung it up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! barb wire, caught it in his  hands?&rdquo; and the man of bags looked awed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in his hands! Oh, he&rsquo;s got  hands just like board,&rdquo; the storekeeper confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough to put a quid on  him,&rdquo; the other suggested, with an eye to the main chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t bet, you see,&rdquo; the  storekeeper explained, &ldquo;but if I did, you understand, I&rsquo;d put a pound on him  quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen him shearing?&rdquo;  the other inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t seen him shearing  <i>myself</i>, y&rsquo; understand!&rdquo; answered the storekeeper, &ldquo;but for all that I know he&rsquo;s  a great hand at it. He&rsquo;s been at it so long, y&rsquo; know. And fellows who&rsquo;ve been  out West and all those places with him talk a terrible lot about how he can  shear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The commercial took another squint  at Dan, then settled down to business.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * </p>
<p>The days started to pass quickly,  and each succeeding day found Dan a bigger lion than on the day before. And, by  the time the final touches were put into his training work and his backer had  announced him &ldquo;fit as twenty fiddles,&rdquo; the admiration that Dan&rsquo;s native  township had for Dan amounted to idolatry.</p>

  The Contest</b></h2>
<p>The night of the great battle at  last came round And what a night it was! The promoters neither spared  themselves nor their money to create a draw. And it was a draw! It drew people  from everywhere. It left every milking-yard and shearing-shed within travelling  distance short-handed. It emptied the streets, demoralised the town band, threw  cold water on church meetings, and postponed an important gathering of the  People&rsquo;s Slowgressive League. Long before the advertised hour the grounds  surrounding the great Palladium were bearing streams of eager humanity that  poured themselves headlong into its amphitheatre.</p>
<p>Admission charges ranged from two  shillings to one guinea, and it would be difficult to say whether the two  shilling ticket official or the one guinea gent was the busier. The writer,  possessed of a desire to satisfy himself on this point, paused to take  observations, but was carried along on the shoulders of the crushing throng and  dumped down astride the back of a long form. And what a scene it was that met  his view within. On the basement floor rows and rows of seats ran back as far  as one could see, and into them, and over them, a noisy, disorderly mass of  people jumped and climbed and sprawled. Parties and friends in the rush and  tumble lost each other. Shouts and calls issued from every quarter. Overhead  circled a great gallery, into which fresh crowds poured, stamping and crashing  like wild horses galloping over loose cliff.</p>
<p>On the stage where the champions  were presently to appear all was peaceful and quiet. No gorgeous drop curtain  hung there to excite curious speculation as to the mysteries concealed beyond,  or rouse the feelings of expectancy.</p>
<p>A mob of patient, woolly sheep,  obviously indifferent to what was happening, or what was to happen, were  enclosed in a hurdle yard. At intervals they bleated and bah-ed innocently. On  either side of the sheep was an empty pen, into which they were presently to be  shied, heaved, kicked, bundled without their coats.</p>
<p>At the respective &ldquo;stands&rdquo;  assigned to them stood the rival foes, each silently adjusting his shearing  paraphernalia. Judges and referee sauntered quietly about examining the sheep  to see they were genuine, and concluding their arrangements with each other.</p>
<p>Pressmen, note-books in hand,  dogged the heels of judges and referee, and &ldquo;worded&rdquo; the champions themselves  for hints and information to spice their copy with. On such occasions pressmen  are the most important looking people of all. They revere the limelight&mdash;love to  pose under the public eye. It may be they require no information whatever;  already they may have collected a surplusage; but the temptation to advertise  their persons to a great assemblage is strong drink to pressmen.</p>
<p>Moments went quickly by. Only  another quarter-hour to pass. The great audience, like all audiences, began to  grow restless. Calls and shouts increased. But the promoters were prepared for all  emergencies. A palliative was ready at hand. The great Paladium band, the  winning band of a hundred interstate contests, lay sheltered under the left  wing like a military regiment in reserve. At the manager&rsquo;s signal, and by a  species of musical flank movements, that band of brass smashed in on the  whistling noises and cat-calls and fairly blew them to perdition. Their fort  was silenced.</p>
<p>But the music took a different  effect upon Dan. It seemed to make him feel he had left his earthly troubles  and joined the angels above. He suddenly started off into a variety of light  fantastic flights and jiggetty jiggetty jumps. In one voice the audience  laughed loud at him, and pounded its feet on the floor. Dan waltzed right  across the stage. The crowd laughed more and shouted till it made mince-meat of  the band music.</p>
<p>Old Tom, Dan&rsquo;s backer, sitting  handy to the platform, hopped on to the stage, and seizing Dan roughly by both  shoulders, talked excitedly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a fool o&rsquo; yourself,  man!&rdquo; he was heard to say, &ldquo;take it from me you&rsquo;ll want all you&rsquo;ve got in you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yells of applause, mingled with  shouts of disapproval, from the audience. Dan smiled dumbly, and waving his  long arms in response to the house, took Tom&rsquo;s advice and returned to his  stand.</p>
<p>The band stopped playing.</p>
<p>Then the manager of the great Palladium,  a tall, bulky, bony, aggressive-looking man, stepped forward and made the usual  introductory speech. He examined the conditions under which the contest would  be conducted, and challenged anyone in the audience who had the least doubt  that everything was not as Caesar&rsquo;s wife, above reproach, to stand up and say  so right where he was sitting. But whether it was honest, convincing tones in  which the manager spoke or the size of him that satisfied the audience we do  not know; but none accepted the challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This shearing match,&rdquo; the manager  concluded, &ldquo;will I am sure, prove the most sensational that ever took place in  any part of the world. Fitzgerald, the present holder of the championship, is  well known to you, and Dan Rudd (pointing to Dan, who stood shaking his head  about) comes before you as the &lsquo;ringer of the West,&rsquo; and with the reputation of  having shorn no less than three hundred and eighty sheep in one day at  Muckamundaboobee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deafening applause, at the end of  which a man with a head for western geography rose up in the audience and  desired to be informed &ldquo;where the devil Muckamundaboobee was&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Several thousand angry voices  peremptorily ordered him to &ldquo;sit down&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The man sat down.</p>
<p>Then the engine that drove the  shearing machines was put in motion, and the noise it introduced to the stage  reminded us of the machinery section at a national show.</p>
<p>The champions squared up, and  breasting the wicket gate that opened into the sheep-yard, waited for the word  to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; said the manager.</p>
<p>Both were ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then <i>go</i>,&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald, who was nearer the  gate-latch, placed his hands calmly and leisurely on it to open the way. But  Dan was in a hurry. With a tremendous spring he cleared Fitzgerald, gate and all,  and landed in amongst the wethers.</p>
<p>A great cheer went up for Dan. And  Dan&rsquo;s township supporters, led by the storekeeper, cheered longest of all.</p>
<p>Catching a sheep up in his arms,  Dan ran out with it and dumped it down hard on its end on the boards. Then he  tugged his hat off, a greasy old felt, and threw it recklessly from him. The  old hat floated lightly into the guinea seats, and rested affectionately in the  lap of a lady in evening dress. The lady looked upon it as though it were a  reptile, and vainly endeavoured to escape it by wriggling in her chair and  making grimaces and gestures. But a gallant gentleman beside her in a white  shirt front and high collar came to her assistance. He lifted the old felt hat  carefully on the point of his cane and poked it along the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much indeed,&rdquo; the  lady gasped, with a tremendous sigh of relief, and the gallant gentleman bowed  and begged her &ldquo;not to mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dan switched on the  power, and taking a firm grip of his machine commenced hurriedly on the belly  wool.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald, with a sheep in his  arms, arrived later on the scene, and taking time to adjust himself  comfortably, started leisurely in pursuit of Dan. He was in no hurry, and moved  like one who was reared in the &ldquo;Land-o&rsquo;-lots-o&rsquo;-Time&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Dan flung away the belly wool with  a flash of the hand; ripped off the &ldquo;top knot,&rdquo; snipped a bit of wool from  round the horns; gave the animal&rsquo;s head a violent twist; opened up the neck;  down over the shoulder; flung the sheep into fresh position, and was half  finished before his opponent had barely made a start. Then when he flew down  the &ldquo;whipping side,&rdquo; set the sheep on its legs and booted it into the pen  before his opponent was a-quarter way through he became popular with the  audience. It shouted and howled its appreciation of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; some cried  boastfully to those who had discounted Dan&rsquo;s chances, while some more cried  plaintively: &ldquo;Shake it up, Fitz; don&rsquo;t let him get all over you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan patted Fitzgerald  encouragingly on his stooped back, as he passed by, then jumping the gate again  sallied forth with his second sheep.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald&rsquo;s supporter&rsquo;s resented  Dan&rsquo;s familiarity with their idol, and began to hoot Dan. Dan&rsquo;s friends  responded with groans, and a large body who were neutral in the matter joined  in with peals of merriment.</p>
<p>Dan waded in to the second sheep,  working with arms, hands, head and feet, and throwing wool all about him. No  one could doubt his pace, and he was making it too&mdash;like a race horse.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald, coming along with  clean, sweeping blow and a light sympathetic hand on his sheep, seemed in no  way perturbed about Dan. But those who understood the business saw he was  travelling like an express. And when he let go his second sheep simultaneous  with Dan&rsquo;s a great burst of excitement filled the Palladium.</p>
<p>But no one was more surprised than  Dan&mdash;or seemed to be. He cast a quick look in the direction of Fitzgerald, then  jumped the gate again; but this time he blundered and nearly fell on his head,  and caused an outburst of derisive laughter.</p>
<p>Both men started together on the  third sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&rsquo;ll tell! This&rsquo;ll tell!&rdquo; was  murmured breathlessly, expectantly. &ldquo;If he runs away again from Fitz on this  sheep he wins!&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>For two exciting minutes the  machines fairly whistled, while flakes of white wool rolled on the boards like  foam from an ocean liner. Then Fitzgerald let go while Dan was only half-way  through.</p>
<p>Howls of applause&mdash;and some  laughter that was meant for Dan.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald secured his fourth  sheep and started in pursuit of Dan again. He caught him, amidst wild  excitement&mdash;and more laughter which was meant for Dan. Tally: Fitzgerald, four  sheep; Rudd, three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake it up! Shake it up!&rdquo; old  Tom, thinking of his three hundred pounds, called anxiously.</p>
<p>A small man with a large head of  black hair cried out from the gallery:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! he can shear none, that  bloke! He&rsquo;s got too much frill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the crowd enjoyed his courage.</p>
<p>Again both men reached the gate  together; but this time Dan made no attempt to jump it. All the vitality seemed  to have left him. The perspiration was beginning to pour from him, too, and he  was showing signs of going to pieces. Then it was that the audience began to  forget that Dan was its idol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you jump it, old chap?&rdquo;  a lot of them shouted, while more laughed and guffawed.</p>
<p>Seeing to work again, Dan made a  desperate sprint to overtake his man, but instead of gaining he went further to  pieces, and cut and hacked his sheep into the bargain. Then as fate would have  it, Dan struck a fractious brute of a wether that resented the loss of its  fleece with all its legs and head, and as though appealing to the audience for  assistance bellowed terribly.</p>
<p>Some people laugh at anything, and  it was wonderful the number that laughed at that sheep, and at Dan&rsquo;s distress.  But Dan wasn&rsquo;t a man to be tampered with by a sheep, or by an audience for that  matter. Dan just straightened up and kicked that wether in its side, and when  it bellowed for more Dan had it ready. Bif! Bif! Bif! went Dan&rsquo;s big foot. Then  there was a howl, and yells of <i>Shame!</i> <i>Shame!</i> <i>Shame!</i> Why, you&rsquo;d think it was the audience Dan had kicked, it went  on so!</p>
<p>But Dan just lifted his head and  bared his teeth savagely to them, like a dingo at bay, and taking advantage of  the moment, the wether stubbornly scrambled to its feet and plunged and reared  for liberty, and tangled its horns in Dan&rsquo;s singlet.</p>
<p>Dan came Donald Dinie over that  sheep, and threw him with a loud bang on the boards.</p>
<p>More shouts of &ldquo;Shame! Shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan could stand it no longer. With  his knee on the quadruped he lifted his head again and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to th&rsquo; devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ber-r er-r,&rdquo; bellowed the sheep.</p>
<p>Roars of laughter.</p>
<p>Dan punched it on the nose.</p>
<p>A babel of hoots went up, and  confusion set in in the ranks of the audience. Missiles in the shape of peaches  and bananas began to fall about Dan. But Dan had the spirit of a tiger. Placing  both knees on the sheep he sat up, and conveyed profane things to them by  connecting his nose and fingers into a wireless telegraphy instrument. That  settled a lot of them; they rose and hurried to the doors. But something like a  thousand or more were not settled by any means. They came down from those seats  howling like wolves for Dan&rsquo;s blood, and stampeded for the stage.</p>
<p>Giving the wether its liberty Dan  tore a hurdle from the sheep fence, and up-ending it above his head prepared to  engage all and sundry from the edge of the platform. Dan would have made a  great leader on a battle field.</p>
<p>Numerous officials, headed by the  manager, flew on to the stage, and holding up their hands, appealed to the mob  for a hearing. The police arrived, and fighting their way to the front, waved  their batons and pulled up their jacket sleeves, and shook their heads  menacingly. Half the sheep wandered from the yard through the opening that Dan  had made, and stared curiously at the yelling crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have sinse, men! <i>Have</i> <i>sinse!</i>&rdquo;  the police cried advisedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him put that hurdle away,  then!&rdquo; one man shouted, referring to Dan.</p>
<p>The police advised and pleaded  some more, and the sergeant added, addressing a leader: &ldquo;Now, Bill Smith, you  surely ought to know better than this! A man in your position, too, and a Justice  of the Peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And somehow Bill Smith suddenly  thought he did know better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; he cried and beat  a retreat, and was gradually followed by the whole mob, who returned to the  seats.</p>
<p>Taking time by the forelock the  manager stood forward and spoke feelingly to the crowd. He waved his hands dramatically  and referred to the King of England, our great Empire, and the freedom and  spirit of fair play that was so dear to the heart of every Britisher worth his  salt. Then he asked them to be Britons worthy of their grand-parents, and &ldquo;give  these two men a chance&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Great cheering and waving of hats.</p>
<p>When calm was restored Dan and  Fitzgerald faced the music again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;ll show y&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo;  shearin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Dan said at the top of his voice, and the audience laughed.</p>
<p>Into the pen Dan bounded like a  wallaby, and selected a sheep.</p>
<p>Both men began again together, and  all Dan&rsquo;s early form returned. He was shearing now, like a new man. Work how Fitzgerald  would to retain his lead it was fast slipping from him. Dan moved like a flying  machine. Sheep after sheep left the floor, and for every fleece he tossed aside  Dan gained half a sheep.</p>
<p>In the excitement Fitzgerald cut  his hand with the machines, and that helped Dan a good deal.</p>
<p>In less than an hour Dan drew level,  and for twenty minutes the men shore sheep for sheep.</p>
<p>Old Tom and the storekeeper rose  in their places and led the cheering for Dan.</p>
<p>Dan didn&rsquo;t hear them.</p>
<p>Only five minutes to go. In and  out of the pen, and together they opened on their last sheep.</p>
<p>The audience nearly went wild.  They stood on the chairs and shouted and cheered. The officials collected near  the men and watched them keenly. Dan was shearing as though possessed of  several devils, and shearing clean and close. &ldquo;Fitzgerald! Fitzgerald! the  audience shouted. Not a move was in either sheep. They lay like angels in the  hands of the shearers. Both machines started, blow for blow down the whipping  side. &ldquo;Rudd! Rudd! Rudd wins!&rdquo; Then one of the sheep moved. It was Dan&rsquo;s. He  set it on its feet and shoved it into the pen. A tremendous cheering went up,  and there was more waving of hats.</p>
<p>Old Tom, and the storekeeper, and  all Dan&rsquo;s local acquaintances, scrambled on to the stage and shook him by the  hand. Perspiring like a hog, and gasping for breath, Dan stammered: &ldquo;Oh, on&rsquo;y  kid&rsquo;s play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare Mr. D. Rudd to be the  winner of to-night&rsquo;s contest,&rdquo; said the manager in a loud voice, &ldquo;and I further  declare him to be the champion shearer of the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great applause, during which old  Tom and the storekeeper shook hands once more with Dan, and led him away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  After Many Years</b></h2>
<p>More than twenty years had past  since we last saw Dan, and we thought him dead. We thought dead until one year  we had reason to travel south and then west in search of official information.  At Mullabrie they told us to see Rudd&mdash;Dan Rudd of Showery Plains. They said we  would find him an exceptionally well-informed and interesting settler.</p>
<p>We found him in the cow-yard  calmly waving a bucket at a herd of milkers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my colonial,&rdquo; Dan said, &ldquo;it  makes good readin&rsquo;, all right, does all this preachin&rsquo; about us blokes on th&rsquo;  land makin&rsquo; money for ourselves out of crops an&rsquo; cows. It suits the moneylender  and th&rsquo; bloomin&rsquo; middleman an&rsquo; th&rsquo; bloke in office all right. My word, yes,  don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he broke off and ran&mdash;but not  so actively as of old&mdash; to block a cow from doubling back to the paddock. He  blocked the cow, and turned to us again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makin&rsquo; money for ourselves out of  crops and cows, eh!&rdquo; Dan laughed a short, choky sort of laugh. &ldquo;Now, look  here,&rdquo; standing the bucket on a corner post, and placidly removing his old  slouch hat, and scratching his head, &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s to be this great Judgment Day  that we hear so much about&mdash;if a Grand Jury is to take all our weights and  measures and award us all our just measure of fire and brimstone an&rsquo; hot lead,  or whatever it is that&rsquo;s in pickle for us, then all I&rsquo;ve got to say&mdash; and I&rsquo;ve  broken a commandment or two meself in me time&mdash; is God help th&rsquo; boodlers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We said we were sorry he took such  an extreme view of things at his time of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yous needn&rsquo;t be sorry, then,&rdquo; Dan  answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only one among hundreds o&rsquo; them down here that take it&mdash;that  bloomin&rsquo; well <i>have</i> to take it! This farm  that y&rsquo; see me sittin&rsquo; down on here, no doubt is a pretty wealthy and  profitable looking concern to you, with all them buildings an&rsquo; yards an&rsquo;  machinery about it to orniment it with. I bought&mdash;now let me see&mdash;for two pound  ten an acre. I got it from a syndicate, and they gave me twenty years to pay  the installments. Do you follow me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We said we followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course I had settled  down to work then, and to meet them installments, you see, and at th&rsquo; same time  to make a livin&rsquo; for the family I toiled and grafted from daylight to  starlight, year in an&rsquo; year out&mdash;what I never did before&mdash;and so did th&rsquo; wife, my  colonial, she did, livin&rsquo; on just th&rsquo; bare bit o&rsquo; food that was necessary to  keep us alive, and doin&rsquo; with th&rsquo; least bit o&rsquo; clothes you could mention. Well,  I don&rsquo;t suppose we were exactly what you would call like John th&rsquo; Baptist, more  like a whole family of him, with the one difference, perhaps, that we worked a  lot harder. Ah, my bloomin&rsquo; oath, it was all work! There was never any sport or  play-time about it. You see, whenever there was any bit of a gathering on&mdash; a  tea party, or a concert or a little race-meetin&rsquo;&mdash;and God knows they very seldom  happened, anyhow&mdash;we could never think of showin&rsquo; up to them. In th&rsquo; first  place, you see, we could never afford to give a bob or two towards any of them.  And in the second place our clobber was always a bloomin&rsquo; lion in the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, as seasons came and went,  we reaped some pretty good crops, no mistake about that, and some were that bad  that we didn&rsquo;t reap them at all. No mistake about that either! But by constant  pluggin&rsquo; an&rsquo; peggin&rsquo; away, and battlin&rsquo;, the soil, takin&rsquo; it all round,  yielded, I dare say, enough to clear the place of debt, and to keep us all  alive, and pretty humble along with it. My eyes, yes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bloomin&rsquo; ghost of that  syndicate stopped hauntin&rsquo; us in our sleep and at last th&rsquo; little home became  our own. My oath, that was a great moment in my life, in all our lives. I shall  never forget the relief it fetched! One time it wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered a fig! I  might have got tight on th&rsquo; strength of it, but that would have been all.  Heaven may be all what it&rsquo;s cracked up to be; but it only holds half th&rsquo; joy  the parting with that syndicate brought to Daniel then he&rsquo;s prepared to crawl  on his hands and knees over precipices and glass bottles to get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you see, the money that  before had gone to meet principal and interest we began to get a few comforts  with now. And how they were welcomed, believe me! A brighter and a softer side  of life, you understand, started to reveal itself to us&mdash;a side we had only  heard of before. Then we put our heads together of an evening, and began to  plan little schemes for improving the holding, and bettering our  position&mdash;schemes laid out on simple, modest lines, if you understand. In fact,  to cut a long story short, we decided to go in only for those things that we  could afford to pay cash for as we went along. Up to this time, you understand,  we had only built a bit of a slab hut &mdash;that&rsquo;s it standing over there, still  used for the kitchen&mdash;a cow-yard, and the rummiest bit of fencing you ever  looked at. And, take it from me, if we had continued along those lines I&rsquo;d be a  different man to-day. But that&rsquo;s where the rub comes in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a sudden change came over  this district. I don&rsquo;t know and can&rsquo;t tell you how or why it came; but it came.  It certainly wasn&rsquo;t because farmers or dairymen were makin&rsquo; any more or any  less out of their stuff than they had been makin&rsquo; all along. But new-comers  from the South came crowdin&rsquo; down upon us here&mdash;new-comers who might have been  Solomons at agriculture in their own cabbage gardens, for all any of us knew to  the contrary; but any way they knew little or nothin&rsquo; of the conditions rulin&rsquo;  here. Well, they were all carted round the country by the Government at our  expense of course, and they talked themselves hoarse, did these blokes, about  the great bloomin&rsquo; gold mine they saw us sitting down on, and darn well shed  tears about the beauty and the wealth of it all, and they never seemed to get  tired of boasting that our bit of earth was miles ahead of theirs in the South,  which people were falling over one another and pawning their souls to buy at  &pound;50 an acre! And everything these southern grocers and schoolmasters and  starved-out clerks&mdash;for that&rsquo;s all the most of &rsquo;em were, I promise you&mdash;said, was  devoured like water-melons and printed in large letters in the newspapers, and  a darn lot they didn&rsquo;t think of sayin&rsquo; was printed there too. Then, spare me  days, a young town started to rise up all round the railway station. &ldquo;Town&rdquo;  allotments were auctioned and purchased at high figures&mdash;some of &rsquo;em bogus o&rsquo;  course. Costly two-storey pubs went up in a night, and hung round waitin&rsquo; for  tenants. Commission agents opened offices. Then with horses and sulkies and a  week&rsquo;s supply of the grandest ideas you ever heard of about &ldquo;land values&rdquo; and  the &ldquo;prospects in view&rdquo; they started tearing through the country in the devil&rsquo;s  own hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This new turn things had taken  was a staggerer to us old hands, of course. For the life of us we couldn&rsquo;t form  any sane idea as to what the rush was all about, neither could we see what the  &lsquo;town&rsquo; was going to live on&mdash;there was no rations in sight as far as we could  make out. But when the Bank of North Jonah came along and built a branch office  hung out its sign-board we were more than ever up a bloomin&rsquo; tree. Some of us  began to suspect that there was a gold-mine hidden somewhere. My colonial, it  was more of a wonder to us than a late frost. We gave it all up at last, and  just sat down and waited for it to explain itself. And, I tell you, we hadn&rsquo;t  long to wait either. The manager of that branch bank wheeled himself through  the district at greater speed than even the commission agents. And takin&rsquo; us in  turn he called on us all with a full explanation. &ldquo;This is how he explained the  matter to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said he, sittin&rsquo; down in  the old humpy that was, &lsquo;what do you reckon this farm of yours is worth, Rudd,  if you were goin&rsquo; to sell it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;I reckon I  paid as good as four quid an acre for it, and if anyone wants it I wouldn&rsquo;t  take a bob less.&rsquo; &ldquo;He gave a bit of a chuckle, you know, and looking wiser than  a whole hospital full of doctors, asked me if I knew what its value really was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for a moment, you know, I  got a divil of a fright. A terrible suspicion that my bit of earth after all my  years of graft was only worth about five bob or so, got a grip o&rsquo; me, and kept  crawling all over me till I went stone cold. Anyway, I managed to keep silent,  and waited for the worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Ten pounds an acre,</i>&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;What!&rsquo; I shouted, and I jumped  to my feet like a scared wallaby. &lsquo;You must be <i>joking</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Possibly <i>twelve,</i>&rsquo; blow me if he didn&rsquo;t answer, and he looked as calm as though it  was cucumbers we were talkin&rsquo; about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was far too much for  me, and I went off on a go-as-you-please round the bloomin&rsquo; room. I must have  done about twenty laps, I dare say, before me proper senses came back to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Why, dammit then,&rsquo; I sez to  him, &lsquo;I must be worth four thousand quid,&rsquo; and I stopped dead in front of him  and looked him right in the forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;If there&rsquo;s four hundred acres  in it you are,&rsquo; he sez.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s four hundred and twenty  acres,&rsquo; I shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;re worth four thousand  two hundred quid,&rsquo; he sez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say any more. I couldn&rsquo;t  if you understand. I just grabbed him by his two lovely white hands and shook  them for joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I had done shaking he  laughed one o&rsquo; them short, grizzly sort o&rsquo; laughs that coves carry about with  &rsquo;em, and said he could easily understand my feelin&rsquo;s. Then from that out he got  right down to business, and what that bank manager didn&rsquo;t know about his side  of th&rsquo; blanky business wasn&rsquo;t worth knowin&rsquo;, if you understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;What you should do with this  place, Rudd,&rsquo; he starts off with, &lsquo;is to improve it properly. You want a good  barn here, and a bore and a windmill and milking machines, and a hay shed, and  a silo, and a lot more machinery and all that sort o&rsquo; thing to make it an  up-to-date and payable property.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was simply delighted to hear me  own idea of things confirmed, if you understand me, by such a high-up  authority, and right away, as coves will do, y&rsquo; know, I lets him into the  secret of our own little scheme&mdash;that old-fashioned scheme, you know, of going  slowly and paying cash for everything as we could afford it. And when I had  finished, so help me, he just laughed &mdash;laughed one of those wretched discouraging  laughs that break a fellow up, and make him feel that he was never anything  else but a bloomin&rsquo; fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Pshaw!&rsquo;&rsquo; he sniggered &lsquo;that&rsquo;s  no good to a cove in your position. Look here, our bank will advance you all  the money you want, right away, up to sixty per cent. of its full value&rsquo;&mdash; them  I think were his words, as well as I can remember&mdash; &lsquo;but of course you would  have to put it into improvements&mdash; that&rsquo;s all we ask.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That started me thinkin&rsquo; in a  dazed sort of way, same as a chap would when he&rsquo;s had a drop too much, and  while I was doin&rsquo; th&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; act, you understand, he got further down to  business. He gave me some o&rsquo; th&rsquo; loveliest information you ever heard about  banking, about the good friendly side of it, and showed me as clear as day, that  be followin&rsquo; my own wretched idea of finance I would only be marking time. Also  I might tell you that before he left he gave me about two thousand quid as a  present, at five per cent. which I caled round to the bank for at different  times later on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s five bloomin&rsquo; years ago!&rdquo;  Here Dan paused awhile, and stared dreamily at the dim horizon. &ldquo;And this farm  o&rsquo; mine, now worth ten quid an acre, doesn&rsquo;t bring me in any more than it did  when it was only worth two pound ten. But,&rdquo; he paused again, and we noticed how  wrinkled and old-looking he had grown&mdash;&ldquo;what I bring in to the bank is a lot  more than it was. There&rsquo;s been a good improvement in that respect. On that two  thousand quid I&rsquo;m paying seven and a-half per cent. now instead of five per  cent., if you understand. In fact, to tell you straight, I&rsquo;m just about workin&rsquo;  for th&rsquo; bloomin&rsquo; bank. And whenever there&rsquo;s an election about, somehow I&rsquo;m  always votin&rsquo; for it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My colonial, yes,&rdquo; Dan concluded,  lifting the bucket from the corner-post, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s simply marvellous what us blokes  are making out of the land&mdash;in the blanky newspapers!&rdquo;</p>
