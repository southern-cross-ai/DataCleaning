  Jim Takes A Hand</b></h2>
<p>Farmers! We&rsquo;re all farmers.  Well off, too; real well off. Talk about land! You should see our land&mdash;the best  in the district. Miles and miles of splendid country we have, and Grandpa often  wishes we had a lot more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it will all be left to you  grand-children some day, to do with it as you please,&rdquo; Pa and Mamma used to  tell us whenever we sulked or spoke rebelliously of milking. Then we would  smile and whistle tunes into the ears of the old cows, and urge Pa to bring in  a lot more and let us at them. Too many cows, we reckoned, couldn&rsquo;t be milked  on the farmstead when we were to become the proprietors. And while in our  enthusiasm we flowed the milk buckets over, Grandpa&rsquo;s account flowed over at  the local bank, and ran into several other banks.</p>
<p>And often on a frosty morning  when we would be tugging at the last of the herd, and the waggon was waiting to  convey the cans to the factory, Grandpa, after a good breakfast, would hobble  to the yard in his carpet slippers and on two peach sticks, and, scowling  through the rails, would run his eyes over the herd till he discovered one  showing signs of having held back a mouthful of milk. Stars of heaven! how he  would fly off at Pa, and accuse him of negligence!</p>
<p>And how Pa would fly back at  him and challenge him to point to a single cow that wasn&rsquo;t milked dry as a  bone. Then angrily discarding one of the sticks, Grandpa would point to the  whole herd, and to us, and bellow: &ldquo;None o&rsquo; them have; not a d&mdash; one o&rsquo; them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milk buckets in hand, we would  rise from the blocks and stare, and wonder what Pa would do. But we were never  left to wonder long. In a bound Pa would breast the rails and shout: &ldquo;You ought  to be ashamed, you ought! And after sweatin&rsquo; an&rsquo; slavin&rsquo; here for you all me  life! If y&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t pretty civil I&rsquo;ll clear out an&rsquo; take th&rsquo; boys with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You pup! (Pa was 50). Clear  out and take them with you. Who wants them? Did I say I wanted them (striking  the rails with the stick)&mdash; did I? To th&rsquo; devil with th&rsquo; lot o&rsquo; you! I&rsquo;ll sell  off&mdash;sell every inch and stick and put th&rsquo; money in me pocket&mdash;put it in me  pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can put it where you  like,&rdquo; Pa would answer.</p>
<p>Then, mumbling to himself,  Grandpa would go off. And when he had gone a few yards would turn slowly round  and shout: &ldquo;If them cows ain&rsquo;t milked dry to-morrow I&rsquo;ll turn you all out&mdash;every  d&mdash; one of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; Pa would grunt, and go  on with the work. We always went on with it, too. But Jim, the eldest of us,  grumbled sometimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old beggar!&rdquo; he said one  day, &ldquo;he ought to be on a chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, you,&rdquo; Pa promptly  objected, &ldquo;stop that; none of your talkin&rsquo; about him! You&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; to grumble  at him for. He&rsquo;s done a good lot for you in his time if you only knew it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know it,&rdquo; Jim admitted;  &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s that got to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ain&rsquo;t it; it&rsquo;s got a lot  to do with it,&rdquo; Pa argued; &ldquo;and see y&rsquo; don&rsquo;t forget it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jim often forgot it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have to go for him with  an axe some day, Mamma,&rdquo; he declared one evening, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it. <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t stand his humbug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mamma went red in the face,  and stared at Jim. Mamma was a generous, sympathetic soul, who always stood for  peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that, my son,&rdquo;  she said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not old enough to understand everything yet; you shouldn&rsquo;t  take any notice of Grandpa. He&rsquo;s getting childish now, and it does no harm to  humor him a little. Everything will come out right in the end. I&rsquo;m sure of  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine, Mamma,&rdquo;  Jim blubbered, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t care (sob). If ever he starts shaking his stick and  swearing at me again&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;(sob) &mdash; straighten him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim! Jim!!&rdquo; and Mamma looked  alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He needn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s going to  have <i>me</i> soft any more,&rdquo; Jim grumbled  on, &ldquo;to do everything for him for nothing (several sobs). He needn&rsquo;t think  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But one morning when the  milk-supply was falling off, Pa himself was forced to take notice of Grandpa.  Grandpa struck Pa on the ear with one of his peach sticks, and prodded him in  the stomach with the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll g-g-go!&rdquo; Pa, writhing  in pain, shouted. And deserting the milk-waggon, he came running home,  swearing, and said he would never do another hand&rsquo;s turn on the farm as long as  he lived. He&rsquo;d go and work for the neighbours for nothing a week before he  would. &ldquo;By cripes I will!&rdquo; he yelled, stamping his foot hard on the verandah  and frightening the baby.</p>
<p>And all that day he lay about  the home repeating his resolution, while over at the &ldquo;head-house&rdquo; Grandpa paced  the verandah like an aged lion, and kicked up such a shine that Grandma and  Biddy started crying, and wanted to send for a doctor.</p>
<p>And next day, when Pa still  remained on strike, Mamma put on her hat and said she would go &ldquo;straight across  and have it out with Grandpa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa got a great surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h,&rdquo; he groaned; &ldquo;you had  better not. I wouldn&rsquo;t if I was you! It&rsquo;ll only make him worse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>will</i>&mdash;I WILL!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And tugging at her hat-strings,  Mamma looked as mad as a suffragette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you go I&rsquo;m going with  you, Mamma!&rdquo; And Jim put on his hat, too.</p>
<p>Mamma, tossing her head about,  marched firmly down the steps, and directed her way to the head-house. Jim  marched boldly beside her. All of us except Pa ran to the verandah to see them  off. Pa remained on the sofa, groaning louder. Jim looked back at us and  grinned. We waved encouragingly to him. We felt Jim would want encouragement  before he returned. And while Mamma walked quickly on, Jim turned and struck a  fighting attitude for our benefit. He delivered the atmosphere a variety of  heavy punches and place kicks. We grinned approval. Jim grinned acknowledgment,  then hurried after Mamma.</p>
<p>Mamma bounced into the  head-house, and marched through on to the verandah, where Grandpa was leaning  on his peach sticks, grunting things to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by treating  Dicky (Dicky was Pa&rsquo;s name) the way you do?&rdquo; She burst on him. </p>
<p>Grandpa glared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And treating the rest of us  the way he does,&rdquo; Jim prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and treating the boys the  way you do?&rdquo; Mamma added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Grandpa burst out. &ldquo;Are  you comin&rsquo; here to give me insolence?&rdquo; And he pounded the boards with both  sticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; And Mamma  gathered herself together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what th&rsquo; devil are y&rsquo;  here for? Why ain&rsquo;t y&rsquo; at home workin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am&mdash;I&rsquo;m always at home  workin&rsquo;!&rdquo; Mamma stammered excitedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing but work I&rsquo;m always doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t at home when you&rsquo;re  here, are y&rsquo;?&rdquo; And leaning down Grandpa shoved his face close to Mamma&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said I was!&rdquo; Mamma  cried. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s not it?&rdquo; shouted  Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Shut up!</i>&rdquo; and Grandpa pounded the floor again. &ldquo;SHUT UP!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandma and Biddy hurried to  the verandah. &ldquo;What is it? Are you quarrelling?&rdquo; Grandma asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not quarrelling,&rdquo;  Mamma answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want Grandpa to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <i>what?</i>&rdquo; Grandpa interrupted with a howl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he will, dear, so he  will; and when he goes, when we both go, you&rsquo;ll all get everything,&rdquo; Grandma  chipped in, without waiting to hear the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when he goes!&rdquo; Mamma  sneered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no use to us. We want something now.&rdquo; And she began to sob.</p>
<p>Grandpa thumped the floor and  howled: &ldquo;I <i>knew</i> it! I KNEW it! They  want me to die! Here, give me poison; give me poison!&rdquo; And dropping his right  stick, he stretched out his empty hand desperately.</p>
<p>Grandma and Biddy gathered  round him, and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Grandpa! No, No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want me to die!&rdquo; he  insisted.</p>
<p>Then Mamma changed her attitude,  and clung to his arm and moaned: &ldquo;Not that, Grandpa, not that at all. No, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he bellowed, stretching  his hand further. &ldquo;Give me poison; give it to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim rushed inside, and rushed  out again with a razor. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no poison, Grandpa,&rdquo; he  shouted, &ldquo;but here&rsquo;s your razor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandpa glared at the  glistening blade. Then without any warning he hit Jim on the head with the  stick, and Jim dropped on the door-mat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; d&mdash; cub!&rdquo; Grandpa said, in  injured tones.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ever have y&rsquo; done?&rdquo; Pa  cried, when Jim, pale and blood-stained, was carried home for first aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, nothing!&rdquo; Mamma  answered, and hurried to procure a basin of warm water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have y&rsquo; done?&rdquo;&rsquo; Pa  repeated, throwing his hands wildly about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did nothing,&rdquo; Jim murmured  faintly. &ldquo;Grandpa did it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  About Relations</b></h2>
<p>In his day Grandpa must have  been a busy man &mdash;so Jim used to think. Not only did he collect more horses and  cattle and sheep about him than anyone else in the district, but he became  possessed of ten times more descendants. The whole district, and large parts of  several other districts, was mostly Grandpa. People reckoned he should have  been proud of his relations&mdash;especially of the relations themselves.</p>
<p>And how the relations haunted  and hung round the head-house! No other place had any attraction for them. Any  old excuse would bring them along in droves. No matter what it was, an  accident, a death, a birth, a dog-fight or an elopement, they would fall over  one another to be in first with the news. But never did they fall over anyone to  be out and be off. They would loiter round till lunch or afternoon-tea, or whatever was on; then they&rsquo;d make a great fuss and be in a hurry to leave. Of  course, they would be asked to wait and have a cup of tea. Then they&rsquo;d hesitate  and look at the clock that was never going, and say it was getting late.</p>
<p>Eventually they would consent  as a favour to remain and have &ldquo;just a bite.&rdquo; And when they had drained their  cups several times and eaten up all that was put down, they would depart  slowly, and as though they had no place on earth to lay their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Grandma!&rdquo; Mamma used to  say, when from our verandah she would see the relations flocking to the  head-house; &ldquo;I wonder she never gets tired of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they never get tired of  her,&rdquo; Pa would put in. &ldquo;And none o&rsquo; them ever goes home without somethin&rsquo; stuck  under their aprons where the old man won&rsquo;t see it. They wouldn&rsquo;t be always  about if I had me way. By cripes they wouldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d keep them off! But it&rsquo;s a  good job they don&rsquo;t come here, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But one day the relations did  come to our place. And when we saw them coming we looked hard at Pa, and  wondered what he would do about it. We didn&rsquo;t wonder long. Pa rushed out  bareheaded, and greeted them joyfully and took charge of their old sulkies, and  proceeded to stuff their lean horses with good corn and chaff, and yelled to  Jim to come and help. Then, in grieved disappointed tones, he inquired why a  lot of the absent ones didn&rsquo;t come too, and bring all their children. After  that we lost confidence in Pa. </p>
<p>One day, Auntie Sara, with her  first grandson in her big brown arms led an excited rush to the head-house.  You&rsquo;d think it was a gold rush. She showed the wonderful infant to Grandma and  Biddy and Nell. Nell was Grandpa&rsquo;s white-haired granddaughter, and lived at the  head-house. And when they had all kissed it, and turned up its long calico  clothes and looked at its red legs, and felt its weight, and told lies about  its beauty, and predicted a great future for the brat, Auntie Sara expressed a  wish to show it to Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run, Nell, and tell him,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m bringing his latest great little grandson to see him; and tell  him, too, that he&rsquo;s got to give him a present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nell went to the verandah where  Grandpa in a thick heavy coat and a slouch hat lay dozing and grunting in a  large chair, and with a smile delivered the message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great grandson? Whose great  grandson?&rdquo; Grandpa growled, waking up and feeling for his peach sticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jim Jerrick&rsquo;s little baby,&rdquo;  Nell answered; &ldquo;such a sweet little thing, Grandpa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Mrs. Jim Jerricks? What  is she?&rdquo; And raising himself, Grandpa took a firm grip of his stick. &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nell smilingly explained the  relationship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Grandpa grunted, and  closed his eyes. &ldquo;Auntie Sara brought it over to show you,&rdquo; Nell explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did she!&rdquo; opening his eyes  again. &ldquo;Well, tell her to take it away; I don&rsquo;t want to see any more babies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old sinner!&rdquo; Auntie Sara  said, when Nell returned shaking her head dismally. &ldquo;We heard what he said. But  he might be glad yet to see his great little grandson, so he might,&rdquo; kissing  the wonder on both cheeks.</p>
<p>Then a malicious idea occurred  to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back, Nell, and tell him,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;that one of the draught mares has got a foal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; Auntie Sara  insisted. &ldquo;And tell him it&rsquo;s a filly foal, and a beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be true,  Auntie,&rdquo; Nell murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you&rsquo;re so p&rsquo;tic&rsquo;lar about a bit of a fib,&rdquo; the  other snapped, handing the precious infant over to its mother, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and  tell him myself.&rdquo; And bouncing through the house, pushing doors open before  her, she poked her head through a window and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bonnie has a young foal,  Grandpa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she?&rdquo; and Grandpa sat up  instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful filly foal with  two white feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real model,&rdquo; and chuckling  triumphantly, Auntie Sara ran back to the dining-room.</p>
<p>The others looked alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A filly foal is it,&rdquo; Grandpa,  stumping through the house, echoed. &ldquo;I thought it would be this time, I thought  it would be&hellip; Come along, Nell, an&rsquo; see what it&rsquo;s like&hellip; Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then as he descended the steps  into the yard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A filly foal, eh&hellip; Oh, I  thought it would be&hellip; I thought it would be.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  Uncle Dan</b></h2>
<p>After thirty long, lazy years  Uncle Dan lost his wife, and thought he&rsquo;d come and live at the head-house for a  while, and give Pa a hand to look after things for Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nothin&rsquo; to them, now,&rdquo; he  said, referring to his family. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to be bothered with me. I ain&rsquo;t  good enough for them. &rsquo;N&rsquo; what bit o&rsquo; money me &rsquo;n&rsquo; her scraped together &rsquo;n&rsquo; put  by for a rainy day was all banked in her name, and she&rsquo;s left it all to them to  do th&rsquo; grand on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when we heard that Uncle  Dan was coming we laughed. We knew Uncle Dan&mdash;knew how idle and useless and  unreliable he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be a great help, <i>he</i> will,&rdquo; Jim said with a grin. &ldquo;And  he&rsquo;ll look well about the head-house, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We laughed more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where else ought he to  be?&rdquo; Pa snapped.</p>
<p>Jim looked at us and said: &ldquo;In  the museum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re funny, ain&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; Pa  sneered at Jim; &ldquo;and p&rsquo;raps y&rsquo; think he ought to be let starve? An&rsquo; p&rsquo;raps <i>you</i> wouldn&rsquo;t be any better, if you went  through all what he&rsquo;s went through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim said he didn&rsquo;t think Uncle  Dan ever went through anything &rsquo;cept his wages and his pants.&rdquo; We broke into  loud merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now just yous stop that, the  lot of you,&rdquo; Pa reprimanded. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; mightn&rsquo;t be so funny some o&rsquo; these bright  sunny days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stopped it.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * *</p>
<p>Uncle Dan arrived. And the  moment he set foot in the yard he rolled up his sleeves and commenced work. He  plunged into this thing and that with a display of energy that provoked us all  to mirth. Struggling across the yard between two empty buckets he encountered  Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give th&rsquo; dairy a  real good cleaning out, governor,&rdquo; he told him; &ldquo;and it ain&rsquo;t before time  neither. Look at it&mdash;it&rsquo;s not had a cleanin&rsquo; out since the day it was put up,  and that&rsquo;s a day or two ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandpa looked him up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about pitchin&rsquo; th&rsquo;  roof of it a bit higher?&rdquo; Uncle Dan rattled on&mdash;&ldquo;an&rsquo; cementin&rsquo; a couple o&rsquo; more  drains? And them old sheds over there,&rdquo; putting down the empty buckets, and  pointing, &ldquo;would look better pulled down altogether. . . . An&rsquo; that &rsquo;orseyard,&rdquo;  pointing again, &ldquo;is no good the way it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandpa clutched hard at his  sticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought to be shifted about  50 yards this way,&rdquo; Uncle Dan continued. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t take long doing it  neither. A couple of us could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn him, he&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; Grandpa  roared, and was hurried away by Nell.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * *</p>
<p>A couple of weeks passed. Uncle  Dan cooled off a lot. Whenever anything was required to be done he was never to  be found, and whenever he was to be found nothing wanted to be done.</p>
<p>When visitors came, though, he  was always handy, and would pop out of most improbable places. No visitor ever  approached the head-house without being challenged by Uncle Dan.</p>
<p>Henry Cook, the produce dealer,  arrived one day in a gorgeous motor car. Uncle Dan crawled from under a sheet  of tin in the wash house, and saluted him confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take charge of &rsquo;er,&rdquo; he  said, casting a careless eye on the car.</p>
<p>Cook nodded like a  chief-justice and went off in search of Grandpa.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan climbed into the car,  and hanging his feet over the front, sat and smoked.</p>
<p>Biddy, coming from the kitchen  saw him. &ldquo;I declares t&rsquo; heaven!&rdquo; she gasped, and ran back.</p>
<p>Farm-hands entering the yard  stood and lifted their hats to him.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan nodded stiffly.</p>
<p>Jim happened along, and  cheerfully approached the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are y&rsquo; grinnin&rsquo; at?&rdquo;  Uncle Dan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw you in a car  before,&rdquo; Jim answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t y&rsquo;; well I seen meself  in one of&rsquo;en enough,&rdquo; and Uncle Dan discharged a lot of smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about a spin in her?&rdquo; Jim  suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, jump up.&rdquo; And Uncle  Dan took down his feet.</p>
<p>Jim looked in the direction of  the gaping farmhands collected at the stable, and waved to them. Then he took  his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well do it in  style,&rdquo; Uncle Dan said, lifting a dust cloak and a pair of goggles, and  proceeding to disguise himself in them.</p>
<p>The farm-hands waved their  hats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, we&rsquo;ll see what she&rsquo;s  made of.&rdquo; And Uncle Dan began fumbling the works.</p>
<p>But the machine didn&rsquo;t seem to  be made of anything. It showed no signs of life.</p>
<p>Jim laughed and kicked his feet  about.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan pulled and squeezed a  lot of parts. Suddenly the horn went off &ldquo;too-oo-t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Dan got a great start. So  did Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they blow when  they run over y&rsquo;,&rdquo; Uncle Dan explained.</p>
<p>Then Jim blew it just when  Uncle Dan tried something else, and to the astonishment of both the car tooted  and glided off like a living thing. The farm-hands jumped with joy.</p>
<p>Darting past the dairy Jim  sounded the horn some more, then excitedly called on Uncle Dan to stop the car.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan tried hard, but failed.  The car went faster. It upended a spring cart, and ran over the wheel-barrow.  Jim stood up. He saw the stable a few lengths ahead, and the farm-hands flying  from it. Then he jumped, and rolled about the yard. And while he was rolling  the car struck the wall of the stable and left a big gaping hole in it. Out of  the hole bounded the Clydesdale stallion, with mane on end and insanity in his  eye. Talk about commotion! You&rsquo;d think the farmstead was a fire station. Henry  Cook, heading a procession from the house, arrived just when Uncle Dan, looking  like Ned Kelly at Glenrowan, crawled from under the debris, spitting out dirt  and staring through the goggles.</p>
<p>Cook threw up his hands and let  go a string of curses.</p>
<p>Just then Grandpa arrived, and  hit Uncle Dan behind the ear with his stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; Uncle Dan cried, and  dodged behind the produce dealer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Grandpa howled.  &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he your man?&rdquo; from Henry  Cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son an&rsquo; heir,&rdquo; Uncle Dan,  taking off the goggles and grinning at Grandpa, answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Never</i>, damn you, NEVER!&rdquo; and Grandpa pursued Uncle Dan across the  yard.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * *</p>
<p>Next day Uncle Dan drove Cook&rsquo;s  motor car to the railway station. He drove it behind two of the oldest  plough-horses.</p>

  A Discovery</b></h2>
<p>A bright afternoon. Pa and Jim  mending the yard gate. Uncle Joe, cousin Sammy, his son, and the farm-hands  chaff-cutting at the stack-yard; Uncle Dan poking about the stables with an egg  in each hand and the yolk of another clinging to his whiskers.</p>
<p>Nell came from the house and  called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle, Grandpa wants you all  inside&mdash;the men, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened, Nell?&rdquo; and Pa  put down the saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all he said, Uncle,&rdquo;  and Nell disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; up,&rdquo; Pa  murmured, and sent Jim to tell Uncle Joe and the men.</p>
<p>Then turning to Uncle Dan, who  was wiping his whiskers on the sleeve of his shirt: &ldquo;Did you hear that, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Dan didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Pa repeated Nell&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan whistled meaningly.  &ldquo;Thinks he must be nearin&rsquo; the end,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and wants to fix things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it ain&rsquo;t that&mdash;poor old  fellow!&rdquo; and tears started to come into Pa&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan cracked an egg on the  heel of his boot, and dividing the shell with his long fingers skilfully tossed  the contents down his throat, oyster fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s had a good innin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he  drawled, smacking his lips, &ldquo;an&rsquo; better &rsquo;n&rsquo; ever we&rsquo;ll have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Joe and Sammy arrived in  advance of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-w-w-what&rsquo;s th&rsquo; m-m-matter,  Dicky?&rdquo; Uncle Joe asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>Grandpa has sent for every one  of us,&rdquo; Pa answered solemnly, and added: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; up, Joe,&rdquo; and  flicked a tear from his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-wh-when did he take  b-b-bad?&rdquo; Sammy inquired excitedly.</p>
<p>Pa didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he very bub-bub-bad?&rdquo; And  Sammy turned to Uncle Dan.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan sampled the other  egg. Then coughed and said: &ldquo;Seems to me, Sammy, he wants to make his last  testament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D-d-don&rsquo;t you w-w-witness it  then, F-f-father,&rdquo; turning to his parent. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you n-n-now. Billy S-s-smith  witnessed his old m-m-man&rsquo;s, and then couldn&rsquo;t g-g-get any of it l-l-left to  himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, d-d-don&rsquo;t I know?&rdquo; his  parent snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes, F-f-father, but in your  s-s-sorrow you m-m-might forget,&rdquo; Sammy argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hold your t-t-t-tongue!&rdquo;  And Uncle Joe turned to the others.</p>
<p>Then the farm hands arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; Uncle Dan murmured,  &ldquo;if he leaves me a hundred or two and one of the old mares&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But s-s-suppose he don&rsquo;t leave  you anythin&rsquo;?&rdquo; Sammy asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well in that case&mdash;(a pause),  damn him!&rdquo; And Uncle Dan sneezed violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that&mdash;you ought  to know better!&rdquo; Pa said reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C-c-course he ought,&rdquo; and  Uncle Joe frowned at the culprit.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan sneezed again, and  said he was &ldquo;gettin&rsquo; another rotten cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nell appeared at the garden gate  and waved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Pa said, leading the  way. And in gloomy procession they looked like an extemporaneous funeral  crossing the yard.</p>
<p>They entered the dining-room,  and Grandpa, with a newspaper in his hand, rose from the couch.</p>
<p>Pa looked hard at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anythin&rsquo; ser&rsquo;ous th&rsquo; matter?&rdquo;  he asked softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there is!&rdquo; Grandpa  grunted. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted y&rsquo; if there wasn&rsquo;t, would I? Is you all here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The funeral started to shed its  gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; cows is goin&rsquo; off a lot,  ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cows?&rdquo; and Pa frowned at  Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cows, o&rsquo; course; I didn&rsquo;t say  bulls, did I?&rdquo; The funeral smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, th&rsquo; cows&mdash;yairs,&rdquo; Pa  answered with a grin, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve gone off a bit&mdash;only a bit, though; and only the  ones that&rsquo;s been in a good while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the ones that ain&rsquo;t been  in a good while,&rdquo; Grandpa grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few o&rsquo; them,&rdquo; Pa admitted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;All o&rsquo; them!&rdquo; Grandpa roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; Uncle Dan put in&mdash;&ldquo;I  know one of &rsquo;em ain&rsquo;t, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one of &rsquo;em ain&rsquo;t?&rdquo; And  Grandpa glared at Uncle Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t know my own cow?  Wouldn&rsquo;t know my own brand and ear-mark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you might know them  orright&mdash;&rdquo; Uncle Dan agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d know the cow they was  on. I&rsquo;d know her if she was skinned and covered over with bushes in th&rsquo; bottom  of a butcher&rsquo;s cart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The funeral grinned hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought there was  somethin&rsquo; th&rsquo; matter?&rdquo; Pa inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there is&mdash;a lot th&rsquo; matter&mdash;a  lot th&rsquo; matter!&rdquo; And Grandpa rattled the newspaper.</p>
<p>The audience stared at the  paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been readin&rsquo; where it  says here,&rdquo; Grandpa explained, &ldquo;if cows is holdin&rsquo; back their milk and people  sings a chune to them they lets it all down and gives twice as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gathering looked surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s rot!&rdquo; Pa said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t rot&mdash;not if y&rsquo; know  how to sing,&rdquo; and Grandpa glared over the paper.</p>
<p>Jim laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are y&rsquo; laughin&rsquo; at, y&rsquo;  snipe?&rdquo; Grandpa shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems funny that singing  should have such good effect on cows,&rdquo; Jim answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course it seems funny&mdash;don&rsquo;t  all discoveries seem funny when they come out first?&rdquo; from Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When first it was discovered  that the world was round,&rdquo; Uncle Dan put in wisely, &ldquo;no one livin&rsquo; believed  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Course they didn&rsquo;t&mdash;o&rsquo; course  they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Grandpa approved; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s th&rsquo; same with singin&rsquo; to cows.  Because it&rsquo;s just been found out. No one thinks it&rsquo;s true&mdash;&rsquo;cept them who&rsquo;s got  th&rsquo; brains to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what th&rsquo; diggin&rsquo;s did y&rsquo;  bring us here for, anyway?&rdquo; Pa asked impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <i>sing!</i>&rdquo; Grandpa shouted. &ldquo;What th&rsquo; devil else&mdash;if yous know how. If  yous don&rsquo;t someone else will have to milk my cows, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Dan scratched his head,  the farm-hands and Jim grinned and started coughing. Pa looked at Uncle Joe,  and Uncle Joe looked at Pa.</p>
<p>Grandpa shook the paper and  shouted: &ldquo;Damn it, don&rsquo;t y&rsquo; understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what will it be,  governor, a hymn or&mdash;er &mdash;&rdquo; Uncle Dan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>hymn</i> ain&rsquo;t singin&rsquo;, is it? Sing somethin&rsquo; y&rsquo; understand, and I&rsquo;ll  see if it&rsquo;s a chune or not. It&rsquo;s no good if it ain&rsquo;t a chune.&rdquo; And Grandpa  shifted position, and struck a listening attitude.</p>
<p>The choir grinned harder, and  seemed puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-w-what about th&rsquo; W-w-wild  Colonial?&rdquo; Sammy suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Uncle Dan agreed.  &ldquo;The Wild Colonial Boy. Right into my hand. Some of y&rsquo; start it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim started it. The others  joined in at irregular intervals.</p>
<p>Grandpa turned his head  sideways, and made an ear trumpet of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do! That&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; he  shouted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear any more o&rsquo; <i>that!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the choir didn&rsquo;t hear him.  It sang harder. &ldquo;<i>Shut up!</i> damn y&rsquo;,  SHUT UP!&rdquo; and Grandpa lifted a chair.</p>
<p>The choir shut up and grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have y&rsquo; got no ears among th&rsquo;  lot o&rsquo; you!&rdquo; Grandpa grunted, putting the chair down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it, governor?&rdquo; Uncle  Dan, his face running with perspiration, inquired. &ldquo;Good enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See y&rsquo; sings it like thet in  th&rsquo; mornin&rsquo; to th&rsquo; cows what ain&rsquo;t lettin&rsquo; their milk down, and sing it every  mornin&rsquo; to them,&rdquo; Grandpa answered. &ldquo;An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t go tellin&rsquo; everybody round th&rsquo;  country about it either,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;let them find things out for themselves  same as I had to do, same as everyone has to do.&rdquo;</p>

  An Old Friend</b></h2>
<p>Old Regan called one afternoon,  shook hands with Pa, and asked for Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s on the verandah,&rdquo; Pa  said, &ldquo;and he will be glad to see you, Mr. Regan. It&rsquo;s a long time since you  seed each other, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten year come Christmas,  Dicky,&rdquo; and taking off his hat Regan took a handkerchief from it and began  wiping his face and neck. &ldquo;And ye don&rsquo;t think he have forgotten me?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not him!&rdquo; Pa grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cud I have a worrd wid  yourself, Dicky?&rdquo; And Regan lowered his voice.</p>
<p>Pa said he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye think Grandpa wud lind  me a couple o&rsquo; hundred on me deeds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa got a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dare say he would, Mr.  Regan,&rdquo; Pa said with a grin, when he recovered himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I showed him me deeds?&rdquo;  Regan almost whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think so&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll tell  him you want to see him if you like?&rdquo; Pa said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wud loike, then,&rdquo; and the  other started buttoning up his coat. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t tell him for what, Dicky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; and Pa went off,  grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Denis</i> Regan?&rdquo; Grandpa growled, sitting up in his verandah chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to see y&rsquo; if you&rsquo;ve  got a minute to spare,&rdquo; Pa said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no minutes to  spare. You ought to know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, will y&rsquo; or will y&rsquo; not  see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; lyin&rsquo; about is  there?&rdquo; and Grandpa looked all round his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Cept it&rsquo;s yourself,&rdquo; Pa  chuckled, and withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said to  Regan.</p>
<p>Regan clutched his hat and went  in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hel-hel-helloa, Grandpa!&rdquo; he  cried cheerfully.</p>
<p>Grandpa rose stiffly to greet  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shtir yourself mahn,  don&rsquo;t shtir,&rdquo; Regan begged of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do y&rsquo; think I ain&rsquo;t able to  stir myself?&rdquo; Grandpa answered, shaking hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lot younger &rsquo;n&rsquo; stronger  &rsquo;n&rsquo; you yet, Regan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The divil then, but I belaive  ye are if looks have anything to do wid it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down man, sit down,&rdquo; and  Grandpa prodded Regan with a peach stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will then, and &rsquo;tis an honor  to sit wid an old friend who have done so well that he have nearly all the  country to his own cheek, and never a hand&rsquo;s turn to do, nor a care, nor a  worry, nor a sorrow wid it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nothin&rsquo; to do!</i>&rdquo; Grandpa objected. &ldquo;Do y&rsquo; say I&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; to do?  Why there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; on this place that I don&rsquo;t do. And I can work as well today  as I could 40 years ago! I can do a day&rsquo;s work with any man in the country&mdash;with  any <i>two</i> men in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith I belaive ye can. And I  remimber how ye used to wor-ruk when ye had nothing to ate but a bit o&rsquo;  wallaby, and &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Who?</i> ME?&rdquo; interrupted Grandpa with a roar. &ldquo;I never ate wallaby,  man! Never! I alez had good meat o&rsquo; me own to eat, an&rsquo; lots of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not <i>you</i>&mdash;not <i>you</i>. I didn&rsquo;t say <i>you</i> ate wallaby. But I did meself,  and glad I were to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh <i>you</i> might have&mdash;<i>you</i> might  have!&rdquo; Grandpa grunted, &ldquo;but I never did, nor anyone belongin&rsquo; to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Regan shifted ground,  &ldquo;the youngsters of to-day wud think it th&rsquo; divil an&rsquo; all if they had to face  half what we faced, eh?&rdquo; And he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The youngsters of to-day,&rdquo;  Grandpa thundered, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t worth their damn salt. All they thinks about is their  clothes, and their stomachs, and borrowin&rsquo; an&rsquo; thievin&rsquo; from them who has  worked and got some property together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there is exceptions,&rdquo;  Regan put in. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis right enough to lind a pound or two, or a hundred may be,  to a relation or a friend if he have his deeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Grandpa said  firmly. &ldquo;Let them go to a bank or to the buildin&rsquo; &rsquo;ciety. And never lend your  money to a friend, Regan. If you do you&rsquo;ll never see it again. And if y&rsquo; do see  it again, he&rsquo;ll be your worst enemy to the end o&rsquo; your days. He&rsquo;ll cut your  fences, throw burr seed on your land, and burn your grass on y&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regan stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and me,&rdquo; Grandpa went on,  &ldquo;can&rsquo;t afford to run any risks at our time o&rsquo; life. Things is not th&rsquo; same as  they used to be, Regan, and we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s on ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; behind <i>me</i>, anyway,&rdquo; Regan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to-day, but where  are we termorrer?&rdquo; Grandpa continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunwich is where I am  to-morrow,&rdquo; and Regan grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, I never hed to borrow  any money off o&rsquo; you, and you never hed to borrow any off o&rsquo; me, Regan,&rdquo;  Grandpa went on; &ldquo;but we got on for all thet, and got on well&mdash;didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got on the rocks well,&rdquo; and  Regan grinned again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve alez been good  friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very besht,&rdquo; Regan  interrupted proudly. &ldquo;And if ye were to axe me for a hundred or two to-morrow,  there&rsquo;s no mahn I wud lind it to quicker &mdash;if I had it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to borrow any  money off o&rsquo; you, Regan,&rdquo; Grandpa rattled on, &ldquo;an&rsquo; if I did I wouldn&rsquo;t ask you  for it any more &rsquo;n&rsquo; you&rsquo;d ask me.&rdquo; Regan bent down, and smoothed his head with  his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re as bald as a  pig-melon,&rdquo; Grandpa observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am that same,&rdquo; Regan  admitted; &ldquo;and if I don&rsquo;t kape me hat on th&rsquo; flies tickles th&rsquo; divil out o&rsquo;  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put plenty axle grease and  sugar on it,&rdquo; Grandpa advised, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll catch them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make fly paper o&rsquo; me ould  skull? It&rsquo;s time I were leavin&rsquo; ye.&rdquo; And Regan rose to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mind what I was tellin&rsquo;  you, Regan,&rdquo; said Grandpa, holding out his hand; &ldquo;look after your money, Regan,  and lend none of it to no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Divil the one will ever get  the lind o&rsquo; my money. He&rsquo;ll be clever if he do!&rdquo; And Regan departed. Crossing  the yard Pa intercepted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get on, Mr.  Regan?&rdquo; he asked with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did I get on?&rdquo; Regan  mumbled. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo; have got on better with the King of the Jews.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Love Matters</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something more than  business that brings Mr. Cook so often to see Grandpa,&rdquo; Mamma, sitting sewing,  remarked one evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s everlastin&rsquo; pokin&rsquo;  round,&rdquo; Pa affirmed; &ldquo;I wonder Grandpa stands him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Biddy can&rsquo;t stand him,&rdquo;  Jim grinned meaningly.</p>
<p>Pa grinned too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken,&rdquo; Mamma  continued, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Nell that&rsquo;s the attraction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s bottom jaw suddenly  dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Him!</i>&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Attract Nell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all looked hard at Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, does it <i>worry</i> y&rsquo;?&rdquo; Pa asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuh&mdash;it don&rsquo;t worry <i>me!</i>&rdquo; Jim stammered. And seating himself  near the fire he tried to whistle; but he looked miserable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Nell wouldn&rsquo;t have  that flash townie,&rdquo; observed Bertha, starting to set the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she  wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Jim brightened up. </p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks far too much of Tom  Dailey,&rdquo; Bertha added.</p>
<p>Jim bent down and started  playing with the cat. The cat scratched him and slithered.</p>
<p>Willie, the youngest, laughed  hard, and urged Jim to &ldquo;go and catch him and do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim didn&rsquo;t hear Willie.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Some days later, Jim came home  from a Farmers&rsquo; Union meeting, and said Henry Cook was a fraud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, Henry Cook?&rdquo; and Pa  grinned unbelievingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Henry Cook!&rdquo; Jim repeated  firmly. &ldquo;Do you know what&rsquo;s been found out about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s taken everyone down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; from Pa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s taken us down, too,&rdquo;  Jim shouted, &ldquo;on those 500 bags of chaff sent him last week. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s his  account.&rdquo; He produced an account and also a daily newspaper.</p>
<p>Pa stared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Five hundred bags lucerne chaff sold at auction  for 5s. cwt.,&rdquo; Jim read. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Pa mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just see now what the  newspaper says,&rdquo; Jim echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred bags prime  lucerne on trucks from Fairport, realised 5s. 3d. per cwt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s Mr. Henry Cook  for you!&rdquo; and Jim proceeded to roll up the evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never have thought he was  that sort of man,&rdquo; Pa said gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought he was any  other sort,&rdquo; Jim sneered, &ldquo;but of course you and Grandpa would never listen to  the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to listen now. Here,  give me those papers,&rdquo; Pa burst out.</p>
<p>Jim handed him the documents.  Pa rushed away to the head-house.</p>
<p>Mamma overhearing the  conversation called softly to Jim. &ldquo;Now, listen to me,&rdquo; she said, placing a  hand on his shoulder, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you be losing your head over Nell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; and Jim feigned surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hide it from me,  Jim. I&rsquo;ve noticed you a good deal lately. And now remember Nell is your cousin,  and there should be nothing between you. Her mother would go crazy if she heard  of anything&mdash;to say nothing about Grandpa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing, Mamma!&rdquo;  and Jim tried to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought it was my  place to speak to you, that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no need to, Mamma,&rdquo;  and Jim turned away with a sickly feeling in his throat.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; to  tell you,&rdquo; Pa stammered, blundering into the dining-room where Grandpa lay on  the couch listening to Nell reading the newspaper. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s only for yourself  to hear,&rdquo; looking meaningly at Nell.</p>
<p>Nell rose and left the room.</p>
<p>Grandpa sat up and stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you own this house?&rdquo; he  howled at Pa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t matter; I&rsquo;ve  somethin&rsquo; ser&rsquo;ous to say about Henry Cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, have y&rsquo;! Well say it  quick, an&rsquo; get out o&rsquo; here an&rsquo; do some work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa excitedly explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; and  leaving the couch Grandpa hobbled up and down the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been robbin&rsquo; us for  years!&rdquo; Pa declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has?&rdquo; and, stopping  suddenly, Grandpa leaned on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry Cook has. He&rsquo;s a  scoundrel,&rdquo; Pa answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sez so?&rdquo; loudly from  Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone sez so; them papers  sez so,&rdquo; throwing the evidence on the table. &ldquo;Jim sez so; I sez so; old Biddy  has sed so for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she has, has she?&rdquo; and  Grandpa thought hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she could tell you a lot  more about him if she liked, too,&rdquo; Pa added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and bring her here. Bring  her here, and if she sez it to me I&rsquo;ll break her neck!&rdquo; And Grandpa struck the  table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s got nothin&rsquo; to do  with it,&rdquo; Pa protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her here!&rdquo; and Grandpa  struck the table again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll bring her quick  enough,&rdquo; and out Pa ran in search of Biddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scoundref is he&mdash;a  scoundrel!&rdquo; Grandpa repeated to himself. Then taking a chair he sat facing the  door.</p>
<p>The door gently opened, and  Nell with tears in her eyes re-entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that chaff they were  talking about mightn&rsquo;t have been yours at all, Grandpa?&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;It could  have been sent to Mr. Cook by anyone in the district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it could, gal; o&rsquo;  course it could. But what are y&rsquo; cryin&rsquo; for? What are y&rsquo; cryin&rsquo; for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crying, Grandpa.  I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here gal; come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nell went to him and leaned on  his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind what they say,&rdquo; he  said kindly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all lies, gal; all lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nell took out her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go an&rsquo; sit be th&rsquo; window, gal;  sit be th&rsquo; window an&rsquo; look out at th&rsquo; scenery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of farmers send chaff  from Fairport as well as you, Grandpa,&rdquo; and Nell advanced slowly to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they do, gal; o&rsquo;  course they do. Hundreds o&rsquo; them. But never chaff like mine. They can&rsquo;t grow it  like me, gal; nor never could in their lives. When they do happens to grow a  bit they never chaffs it proper. They fills th&rsquo; bags with mud, an&rsquo; stones, an&rsquo;  old boots, to make them weigh well, and calls Henry Cook a scoundrel if he  don&rsquo;t give them top price for it same as he gives me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim suddenly entered and faced  Grandpa with fight in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Pa been speaking to you?&rdquo;  he demanded boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo; loudly from Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Pa been here? Because if  he hasn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ve got something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; have, have y&rsquo;?&rdquo; Grandpa  shouted. &ldquo;Well, tell it quick and go out and do somethin&rsquo; for your livin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry Cook is a <i>scoundrel!</i>&rdquo; Jim cried.</p>
<p>Nell started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is, is he?&rdquo; and Grandpa  glared at Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And long ago he ran away with  Biddy&rsquo;s youngest sister, and after promising to marry her he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <i>lie!</i>&rdquo; Nell screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>what?</i>&rdquo; roared Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; shouted Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why th&rsquo; devil didn&rsquo;t <i>you?</i>&rdquo; howled Grandpa irrelevantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Me? You&rsquo;re mad!&rdquo; stammered  Jim.</p>
<p>Grandpa lifted a chair. Jim ran  out.</p>
<p>Pa, dragging Biddy after him,  entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she is,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Biddy, with flour in her hair  and dough on her fingers, grinned and gesticulated at Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be grinnin&rsquo;; this is  ser&rsquo;ous!&rdquo; Grandpa said.</p>
<p>Biddy took out a hair-pin, and  started doing her hair up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Henry Cook&rsquo;s a scoundrel is  he?&rdquo; Grandpa began. &ldquo;An&rsquo; he promised to marry your youngest sister and didn&rsquo;t,  didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biddy started and stared. Her  eyes opened wide and rolled in her head till they nearly rolled out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promised to marry your  youngest sister?&rdquo; Grandpa repeated.</p>
<p>Biddy suddenly squealed, and  her hands started working and twitching.</p>
<p>Grandpa sat back and gaped at  her. Pa, staring hard, backed away from her. Nell, who seemed to understand,  ran to her and stroked her forehead, and spoke soothingly to her. But Biddy  wasn&rsquo;t to be soothed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sh-h-h</i>,&rdquo; she hissed across the table at Grandpa. &ldquo;<i>Sh-h-h!</i>&rdquo; And struck a listening  attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; devil does she say?&rdquo;  Grandpa shouted excitedly to Pa.</p>
<p>But Pa couldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h! &hellip; <i>She&rsquo;s there!</i> &hellip; <i>She&rsquo;s coming!</i>&rdquo;  Biddy broke out again.</p>
<p>Jim, returning to the charge,  rushed in without knocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll fight it out with  you!&rdquo; he began wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out! <i>Look out!</i>&rdquo; And catching him by the arm, Pa pointed to Biddy.</p>
<p>Jim stopped and stared at  Biddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You killed her!</i>&rdquo; Biddy hissed at Grandpa. &ldquo;&rsquo;<i>Twas you!</i>&rdquo; and she started making passes at him. She moved nearer  him. Grandpa shoved his chair back. It overbalanced, and he made a great noise  falling out of it. Nell screamed and ran to his aid. Biddy turned and made  passes at Pa and Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cripes, look out! Look out!&rdquo; And  Pa rushed for the door. Jim rushed for it, too. They struggled with one  another, but Jim got out first.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and Oi pulled all yer  legs,&rdquo; Biddy said to Nell ten minutes later. </p>

  A New Housekeeper</b></h2>
<p>Medicine wouldn&rsquo;t do her any  good,&rdquo; said the doctor who came to see Grandma; &ldquo;take her to the seaside for a  month. A holiday there would do you a lot of good, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A holiday!&rdquo; Grandpa grunted;  &ldquo;what do anyone want wi&rsquo; a holiday? I never hed a holiday in me life! And ain&rsquo;t  there plenty o&rsquo; air here? Where would you get better scenery in the world, man,  than that out there?&rdquo; waving his hand at the landscape. &ldquo;Change o&rsquo; air an&rsquo;  scenery! Talk sense! Pills is what she wants&mdash;eight in th&rsquo; night an&rsquo; four in th&rsquo;  mornin&rsquo;&mdash;same as I gives meself. But she won&rsquo;t take &rsquo;em, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s th&rsquo;  trouble wi&rsquo; her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor smiled sourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air an&rsquo; scenery! How could  thet cure anyone who were sick?&rdquo; repeated Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you know so much about  your wife&rsquo;s complaint you had better prescribe for her,&rdquo; and, pulling at his  gloves, the doctor prepared to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;ve lived all me  life and never seed anyone sick? Look here,&rdquo; and Grandpa cleared his throat,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hed more horses an&rsquo; cows down an&rsquo; dyin&rsquo; on me hands than all you doctors  in the country ever see, an&rsquo; I brought &rsquo;em all round, every hoof of &rsquo;em, an&rsquo;  stood &rsquo;em on their legs with nothin&rsquo; but crick water an&rsquo; oil an&rsquo; mallers, an&rsquo;  fattened &rsquo;em, too, an&rsquo; got better prices for &rsquo;em than was ever got in th&rsquo;  country before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, bring your wife round  and stand her on her legs!&rdquo; And the doctor walked off the verandah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look here,&rdquo; Grandpa howled  down the steps after him, &ldquo;do you think I could have done thet be sendin&rsquo; &rsquo;em  away for a change o&rsquo; air an&rsquo; scenery&mdash; do yer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For reply the doctor merely  hurried to his car and motored away.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t go yourself,  Grandpa,&rdquo; Mamma reasoned. &ldquo;Nell and Biddy could go with Grandma, and Auntie  Sara or some of us could come and keep house for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No they couldn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want  any more women trottin&rsquo; in and out and pokin&rsquo; an&rsquo; cacklin&rsquo; about me any longer.  It&rsquo;s them that&rsquo;s made your Grandma sick and is keepin&rsquo; her sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Dan, standing behind  Grandpa&rsquo;s chair, winked at the others. The others waited gravely for Grandpa&rsquo;s  decision. They waited several minutes.</p>
<p>Then Grandpa&rsquo;s mouth opened  wide and he started snoring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon me soul, look at that!  There! &hellip; Heigh!&rdquo; Uncle Dan cried.</p>
<p>Grandpa woke with a start, and,  staring at them, asked what they were doing there.</p>
<p>Mamma explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t y&rsquo; keep quiet,  and give me time to think about it,&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan took a tin matchbox  from his pocket containing decayed blowflies, and dropped one on Grandpa&rsquo;s bald  crown. Grandpa rubbed his head with his hand. The blowfly trickled into his  lap. He looked down at it, then up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did that d&mdash;n blowfly  come from?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Pa and Joe too looked up at the  ceiling and grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When them coves starts fallin&rsquo;  down dead it&rsquo;s a sign o&rsquo; dry weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Grandpa,&rdquo; Uncle  Dan agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard lots say the same,&rdquo; and he dropped another fly on  Grandpa.</p>
<p>The others frowned at Uncle  Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn them things!&rdquo; and Grandpa  rubbed his head and looked at the ceiling again; &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want any more  infernal droughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like the last one,  anyway,&rdquo; Uncle Dan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&rsquo; last wer&rsquo; nothin,&rdquo; Grandpa  remarked thoughtfully. &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;56 was th&rsquo; wust of all droughts. &hellip; None o&rsquo;  yous would remember thet!&rdquo; A look of sadness came into his eyes, &ldquo;none o&rsquo; yous  would! &hellip; We was at Razorback then &hellip; at Razorback! &hellip; Your Grandma would  remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, poor old Grandma  would,&rdquo; the others affirmed.</p>
<p>A short silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; Uncle Dan  interrupted confidently, &ldquo;all that he&rsquo;ll want is a bit o&rsquo; grub cooked and th&rsquo;  house kep&rsquo; tidy, an&rsquo; his bed made now and again, and that sort 0&rsquo; thing; an&rsquo;  I&rsquo;ll undertake to do it if anyone&rsquo;ll do my work outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that do, Grandpa?&rdquo; the  others asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will what do?&rdquo; loudly and irritably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Dan to do the housework  for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn &rsquo;im, I s&rsquo;pose so! But  lock everythin&rsquo; up, and don&rsquo;t leave anythin&rsquo; lyin&rsquo; about.&rdquo; And Grandpa leaned  back and closed his eyes.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * *</p>
<p>A week later, broom in hand,  Uncle Dan entered the dining-room and commenced pushing the furniture about and  raking into corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that row about in  there?&rdquo; growled Grandpa, coming from his room in a gorgeous morning gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, bless me,&rdquo; Uncle Dan  gasped, &ldquo;I thought you was the Kaiser!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did y&rsquo;? Well, I thought you  was a damn Uhlan broke into the house. Do you want to break everythin&rsquo; in the  place, or what d&rsquo; y&rsquo; want?&rdquo; Grandpa shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow can&rsquo;t get at th&rsquo; dirt  without shiftin&rsquo; things, can he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get at what dirt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At <i>that</i> dirt!&rdquo; and, with a long stroke of the broom, Uncle Dan  directed a cloud of dust and orange peel at Grandpa.</p>
<p>Grandpa threw up his hands and  hobbled back to his room.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan peeped round the door  after him. Then he gave the floor another touch with the broom and polkaed to  the sideboard. Pausing, he listened. Then he cautiously removed the stopper  from the whisky decanter with one hand. With the other he swept hard while he  raised the decanter to his head and drank greedily. He paused for breath, then  drank some more. Then he rubbed his shirt with the palm of his hand, and made  faces at himself in the mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, old (hic) man,&rdquo; he said  in a high-pitched voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; damn ole lookin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s thet you&rsquo;ve got in  there?&rdquo; the voice of Grandpa shouted from the bedroom.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, who is it?&rdquo; And the whole  house started to creak under the heavy footsteps of Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gen&rsquo;lman, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;m&rsquo;n (hic)  every &rsquo;spect, &rsquo;cept birth an&rsquo; (hic) bringin&rsquo; up,&rdquo; Uncle Dan answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did y&rsquo; say?&rdquo; and,  entering, Grandpa stared about the dining-room.</p>
<p>Beneath the window a hen  cackled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thash th&rsquo; li&rsquo;le brown (hic)  leg&rsquo;orn,&rdquo; Uncle Dan hiccoughed, &ldquo;she&rsquo;sh laid in new nesh.&rdquo; And off he staggered  to collect the egg.</p>
<p>Grandpa, scowling hard,  approached the sideboard, and examined the decanter.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan, holding up the egg  returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thash how to (hic) make &rsquo;em  lay,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Grandpa glared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See thash egg? Besh you a  &rsquo;un&rsquo;ed (hic) quid, an&rsquo; yoush a scholar, yoush can&rsquo;t (hic) tell me if it&rsquo;s (hic)  fer&rsquo;ile&mdash;a &rsquo;un&rsquo;ed quid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Grandpa only stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besh you two &rsquo;un&rsquo;ed quid,  yoush can&rsquo;t (hic) do thish, ol&rsquo; f&rsquo;ler.&rdquo; And opening his mouth wide Uncle Dan  inserted the egg in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re drunk, man, drunk!&rdquo;  Grandpa roared, and went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drunksh or not drunksh, yoush  owe me three (hic) &rsquo;un&rsquo;ed quid.&rdquo; And Uncle Dan sat on the floor and tried to  balance the broom on his chin.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * *</p>
<p>Next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would y&rsquo; like for dinner,  governor?&rdquo; Uncle Dan, appearing on the verandah in a white apron of Biddy&rsquo;s and  a &rsquo;possum-skin cap of his own manufacture, enquired. &ldquo;Cold beef, musherooms,  bit o&rsquo; cold steak, or a egg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s them pigs squealin&rsquo; for  all day?&rdquo; Grandpa growled; &ldquo;are they goin&rsquo; to be let starve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pigs? I&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; to do with  pigs, now. I&rsquo;ve me hands full lookin&rsquo; after th&rsquo; house,&rdquo; Uncle Dan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lookin&rsquo; after th&rsquo; house. What house? Confound it, go and look after th&rsquo; pigs, man,&rdquo; shouted Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what was our  understandin&rsquo;?&rdquo; and Uncle Dan fumbled with his apron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What understandin&rsquo;? Dammit,  what understandin&rsquo;?&rdquo; And Grandpa reached for his stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The honorable understandin&rsquo;  erbout&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dam y&rsquo;, you ain&rsquo;t got any  understandin&rsquo;. Off with y&rsquo; an&rsquo; work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Uncle Dan, making faces, withdrew to the  kitchen, where he started eating the raisins.</p>
<p>Jim came for a jug of hot  water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man&rsquo;s been lookin&rsquo; for  you,&rdquo; Uncle Dan lied to him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been listenin&rsquo; to them pigs squealin&rsquo; and  reckons y&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t been feedin&rsquo; &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s what we bought from  Regan yesterday,&rdquo; Jim explained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re only squealing to get out and go  home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I better go an&rsquo; tell him, if  that&rsquo;s th&rsquo; case, else he&rsquo;ll be bobbing out here looking for you.&rdquo; And Uncle Dan  turned to leave the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him we paid a pound a head  for them, if he asks you,&rdquo; Jim called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, them&rsquo;s th&rsquo; pigs we bought  yesterday, from Regan,&rdquo; Uncle Dan told Grandpa. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re only squealin&rsquo; to get  out an&rsquo; go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go and see they don&rsquo;t  get out an&rsquo; go home,&rdquo; Grandpa grunted without lifting his head.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan pulled more ugly  faces and turned away again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Grandpa called out.  &ldquo;Here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Dan paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they give Regan for  them pigs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money, sir, money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I didn&rsquo;t expect they give  him manure! How much money?&rdquo; shouted Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five bob a head,&rdquo; Uncle Dan  lied with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite enough to give for &rsquo;em,  too; quite enough,&rdquo; and Grandpa closed his eyes and went to sleep.</p>
<p>Later in the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, governor; a good  cup o&rsquo; tea for y&rsquo;. I know it&rsquo;s what you fancy.&rdquo; And placing the steaming  beverage on a round table, Uncle Dan went off humming a tune.</p>
<p>Grandpa sipped at the tea, then  looked up and frowned. He cautiously sipped some more, and blew it from him  like a whale. Then cup in hand he rose and roared like a devil.</p>
<p>Pa heard him from the dairy and  ran to the verandah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send for th&rsquo; police; he&rsquo;s  poisoned me!&rdquo; Grandpa bellowed.</p>
<p>Pa couldn&rsquo;t understand. </p>
<p>Uncle Dan, calling: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  coming, governor,&rdquo; sauntered leisurely through the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sez you&rsquo;ve poisoned, him,&rdquo;  Pa exclaimed, jumping wildly on to the verandah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Nonsense!&rdquo; Uncle Dan  chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink it yourself, then; drink  it!&rdquo; And Grandpa thrust the cup into  Uncle Dan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan took it and drank it  boldly. Then he started to grin. But before the grin had time to expand much he  gave a jump, and reaching for the verandah rail hung over and coughed  violently.</p>
<p>Pa took fresh alarm. He seized  hold of Uncle Dan and called out: &ldquo;Salt! Salt! Bring some salt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he don&rsquo;t want that,&rdquo;  Grandpa grunted, settling down calmly in his big chair. &ldquo;It were salt what were  in th&rsquo; tea!&rdquo;</p>

  In Love With Nell</b></h2>
<p>Grandma, Biddy, and Nell away  at the seaside; Grandpa sitting alone in the dining-room, dozing in a big  chair. Tom Bailey, miserable looking, slowly entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Grandpa,&rdquo; he said,  in pleasing, Irish accents, &ldquo;for coming in without knocking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, is it Tom?&rdquo; and  Grandpa raised his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stepped across to ask how  Grandma is getting on since she went away. She was always as kind to me as a  mother, you know,&rdquo; and Tom played nervously with the tips of his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t much th&rsquo; matter  wi&rsquo; her, Tom&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t much th&rsquo; matter. A change o&rsquo; air an&rsquo; scenery wer&rsquo; all  she wanted, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; that now. Nell an&rsquo; Biddy, they went wi&rsquo; her. But  I&rsquo;m always here, Tom, if y&rsquo; wants anyone&mdash;I&rsquo;m always here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom didn&rsquo;t want Grandpa,  though; Tom didn&rsquo;t want anyone but Nell. Tom was madly in love with Nell. He  had been in love with her for years, but no one knew anything about it, not  even Nell herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that I could have gone  with her, too,&rdquo; Tom mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; Grandpa said sharply.  &ldquo;What would you want to go runnin&rsquo; about th&rsquo; country for? You ain&rsquo;t got no time  to waste runnin&rsquo; about when you&rsquo;ve got a farm to look after, ain&rsquo;t y&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet often enough,&rdquo; Tom said,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing nothing else over there but running about and wasting my time.&rdquo; He  paused and looked up at Nell&rsquo;s picture on the wall, &ldquo;And when I&rsquo;m not running  after old Regan&rsquo;s pigs to hunt them off my potato patch, I&rsquo;m chasing the lambs  that Brady is fattening on my lucerne. And if I&rsquo;m not doing either of those things,  I&rsquo;m running for my life after Logan&rsquo;s bull to yard him and get my front gate  off his horns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t y&rsquo; impound him?&rdquo;  Grandpa grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would, but I don&rsquo;t like to  be unneighbourly, Grandpa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot him then; shoot him!&rdquo;  and Grandpa closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Tom smiled up at Nell&rsquo;s  picture. Then after a silence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Grandma comes back  again in good health, Grandpa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you do. You was alez a  good chap, Tom,&rdquo; Grandpa replied sleepily. &ldquo;And you alez stuck to your farm and  worked it proper. And y&rsquo; never went runnin&rsquo; round after this one an&rsquo; the other  one, and spendin&rsquo; your money like lots o&rsquo; them do. And that&rsquo;s what I likes to  see in a young cove, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might, though, go to the  seaside for a day or two,&rdquo; Tom remarked, looking at Nell&rsquo;s picture again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; devil will y&rsquo; want  goin&rsquo; down there for? They don&rsquo;t want y&rsquo; runnin&rsquo; about after their tails, do  they?&rdquo; And Grandpa sat tight up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they don&rsquo;t  then&mdash;perhaps they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; dreamily from Tom.</p>
<p>Grandpa sat back again, and  grunted. Tom sighed.</p>
<p>Another silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I came to see you about,  Grandpa,&rdquo; Tom said slowly, &ldquo;more than anything else was&mdash;was something  con&mdash;concerning Nell.&rdquo; And again his eyes wandered to her picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; and Grandpa lifted his  head. &ldquo;What is it y&rsquo; want to say concerning Nell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like you to understand  first (pause) that no one ever sent me here&mdash;or&mdash;hinted at all that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? What th&rsquo; devil is it y&rsquo;  want to say?&rdquo; Grandpa barked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; Tom looked  down at his toes, &ldquo;you know that Nell and I were always great chums, and were  brought up together hereabout pretty well ever since we were boy and girl,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t anythin&rsquo; more now,  are y&rsquo;?&rdquo; loudly from Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Together we roamed those great  grey plains outside,&rdquo; Tom went on, &ldquo;picking gum from the grass trees; pulling  the wild flowers, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Grandpa howled,  rising to his feet. &ldquo;Shut up! Comin&rsquo; here mumblin&rsquo; like a damn lunatic! Who  wants to hear o&rsquo; y&rsquo; loafin&rsquo; about th&rsquo; plains pullin&rsquo; flowers? Ain&rsquo;t y&rsquo; got no  corn to pull? If y&rsquo; have, go an&rsquo; pull it. If y&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t go an&rsquo; grow some!&rdquo; And he  left the room.</p>
<p>Tom left too. </p>

  Regan&rsquo;s Pigs</b></h2>
<p>Pa, Mamma, and Uncle Dan,  breakfasting at the head-house. Old Regan, hat in hand, entered the room  excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While ye&rsquo;re enjying yourselves  here, do ye know what&rsquo;s going on out beyant?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fight among th&rsquo; men&mdash;I  &rsquo;spected there would be.&rdquo; And Uncle Dan rose, and started rolling up his  sleeves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is the matter, Mr.  Regan?&rdquo; and Mamma rose.</p>
<p>Pa looked from one to the  other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two magpies up on  ye&rsquo;re windmill building in th&rsquo; cogs of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Regan,&rdquo; and Mamma,  relieved, sat down again and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! is them jolly magpies  still buildin&rsquo; there?&rdquo; Pa said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And goin&rsquo; at it like two  carpenters,&rdquo; Regan answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s only the other day I  knocked the nest all down,&rdquo; Pa added. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They have knocked it all up  again, thin, and have only the roof to put on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roof!&rdquo; Uncle Dan guffawed; &ldquo;a  magpie don&rsquo;t have a roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but a jackass do!&rdquo; Regan  snapped; &ldquo;and one that don&rsquo;t let the rain in, neither.&rdquo; And he looked up at the  ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By cripes, I&rsquo;ll settle those  wretches with a gun,&rdquo; and Pa rose to fulfil the threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One minute, Dicky,&rdquo; Regan  said, lowering his voice, and placing a hand on Pa&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Pa waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About them pigs ye got from me  yesterda&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs, Mr. Regan?&rdquo; and Pa  looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cud ye let me have a cheque for thim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I could,&rdquo; he said  thoughtfully, &ldquo;but y&rsquo; see, Grandpa ain&rsquo;t out of his room yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see, the bank ain&rsquo;t  open,&rdquo; and Regan scratched his bald head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, y&rsquo; know he looks after  all that part of the business,&rdquo; Pa explained, &ldquo;an&rsquo; we do th&rsquo; rest, if y&rsquo;  understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regan grinned, and said he  understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was twelve pigs, wasn&rsquo;t  it?&rdquo; Pa inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It were then, and at a pound a  nob. That were twelve pounds yes owe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orright,&rdquo; Pa agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And good, honest, well-bred  pigs they were,&rdquo; Regan went on. &ldquo;Never were happier dispositioned pigs to be  found anywhere. They&rsquo;d ate out ov ye&rsquo;re hand, so they wud. And they niver  rooted loike other pigs; and there wer&rsquo; always a smile of pleasure on their  faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if y&rsquo; come in directly  we&rsquo;ll fix it up for you,&rdquo; Pa broke in. Then to Uncle Dan, he added: &ldquo;When  Grandpa gets up, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t here, tell him them pigs we bought from Mr. Regan  was a pound a head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him they was twenty  pounds a head, if y&rsquo; like, but I think I told him the other day.&rdquo; And Uncle Dan  started grinning and clearing away the breakfast things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tell him,&rdquo; Regan added,  &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s sorry I am I sold thim, for I cud have got me two pound a nob for  thim twenty minutes after they left the farrum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Dan turned and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  a bit of a liar meself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say that aga-ain?&rdquo; Regan  shouted.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan said it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put &rsquo;em up!&rdquo; Regan yelled,  striking a fighting attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;don&rsquo;t take any notice of <i>him</i>,&rdquo; Pa said, and taking Regan by the  arm led him outside.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * *</p>
<p>Regan looked in again, and  found Grandpa sitting in his big chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, &rsquo;tis up early ye are,  Grandpa,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve alez been up early,&rdquo;  Grandpa grunted, &ldquo;all me life. No one ever seen me in bed after the stars was  off the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wer&rsquo; a bit slow gettin&rsquo;  off th&rsquo; sky, this mornin&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t ye think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is th&rsquo; bank open wid ye yet?&rdquo;  and Regan changed the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is what bank open yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regan explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, them&rsquo;s th&rsquo; pigs that&rsquo;s  been squealin&rsquo; all night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Divil a squeal was ever heard  from thim at my place,&rdquo; Regan answered. &ldquo;And such beautiful pigs they were,  too, and lively as kittens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well what is it y&rsquo; want&mdash;th&rsquo;  money for them, or what?&rdquo; Grandpa growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If &rsquo;tis convenient,&rdquo; and Regan  tried to look unconcerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five shillin&rsquo;s a head weren&rsquo;t  it?&rdquo; Grandpa asked. &ldquo;Pwhat!&rdquo; and Regan looked indignant. &ldquo;A pound a nob it  were, man&mdash;a pound!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you comin&rsquo; here to rob me  in me own house?&rdquo; and Grandpa glared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Tis <i>ye</i> who wud be th&rsquo; robber!&rdquo; shouted Regan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three pounds, and not another  penny do I owe you,&rdquo; loudly from Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Tis twelve pounds!&rdquo; from  Regan.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Tis three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Tis <i>twelve!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Three</i>, dammit, THREE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll summons ye to coort!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Summons me to court?&rdquo; and  Grandpa rose to his feet; &ldquo;do you know that I&rsquo;m a justice of the peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;tis a pity for the  country ye are,&rdquo; and Regan started rolling up his sleeves.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan appeared on the  scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Grandpa yelled to him,  &ldquo;arrest that man! Take him in charge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t! He can&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s no  warrant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regan moved round the table.</p>
<p>But Uncle Dan didn&rsquo;t want a  warrant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said to Regan, &ldquo;come  on!&rdquo; and jerked his thumb towards the door like a policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Arrest</i> him!&rdquo; howled Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye dare!&rdquo; And folding his  arms Regan looked Uncle Dan between the two eyes.</p>
<p>Pa returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; diggin&rsquo;s is th&rsquo;  matter?&rdquo; he asked, staring at the situation.</p>
<p>Regan and Grandpa wildly  explained at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give him a pound apiece for  them,&rdquo; Pa said, addressing the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well if y&rsquo; did,&rdquo; Grandpa  bellowed, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t thet enough? What do he want comin&rsquo; here askin&rsquo; me for more  for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t give th&rsquo; money to  him&mdash;<i>you</i> know that. I told him to get  it from you,&rdquo; Pa explained further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;a pound apiece?&rdquo; roared  Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re well worth it,  too,&rdquo; Pa affirmed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll bring four quid when they&rsquo;re topped off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and Grandpa subsided,  &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t y&rsquo; tell me that before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Pa chuckled  agreeably, &ldquo;you owe him twelve pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve, is it,&rdquo; and taking out  his purse, Grandpa counted the money. </p>

  A Misunderstanding</b></h2>
<p>Jim won&rsquo;t stick to farming  long,&rdquo; Mamma, sitting at the sewing machine, said one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; and Pa frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy he doesn&rsquo;t like the  hard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he don&rsquo;t like to  stick to it, he needn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And off Pa rushed to mend a fence, or bring in a load  of hay or something. Mending fences and bringing in hay were all that Pa seemed  to live for. Nothing else mattered to him. The fate of everything depended on  fences and hay, according to Pa. And he had scarcely gone when Jim, see-sawing  his neck with a handkerchief, and grumbling about the heat and the dust and the  flies, sauntered in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is our wonderful  country,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the only country we  know of, my son,&rdquo; and Mamma bit the end of her thread.</p>
<p>Jim went to the front verandah  and sat in a canvas chair, fanning himself with his hat, and slashing fiercely  at the flies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; he said,  returning to Mamma, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s hotter in here than out in the paddocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use your coming inside  to look for a cool spot,&rdquo; Mamma told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ever they took this  country from the blacks for is a puzzle to me,&rdquo; and moving out to the peach tree  Jim returned with the water-bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you want bringing it  in here to make a mess for?&rdquo; Mamma objected.</p>
<p>Jim silently filled a tumbler.  He filled it four times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hurt yourself, boy,  drinking so much when you&rsquo;re hot,&rdquo; Mamma protested.</p>
<p>Jim filled the tumbler again,  then sat between doors to catch the breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, it&rsquo;s a black&rsquo;s  country, right enough,&rdquo; he said, opening the collar of his shirt. &ldquo;A man can&rsquo;t  work in heat like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have all to put up  with it,&rdquo; Mamma said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put up with it!&rdquo; Jim repeated.  &ldquo;Between it and the flies and the deuce-knows-what, a fellow feels like a dog  that&rsquo;s scalded and smothered with fleas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wait a minute, I&rsquo;ll  make a cup o&rsquo; tea,&rdquo; Mamma suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only makes you hotter,&rdquo; and  rising he visited the verandah again, and for a moment or two scowled at the  shimmering plains. &ldquo;No one should wear clothes weather like this,&rdquo; he added,  returning again to the dining-room and dropping heavily on the couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what should we wear,&rdquo;  Mamma asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; and Jim allowed his  long brown arm to hang near the floor, and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d look well!&rdquo; and Mamma  rattled the machine.</p>
<p>Then after a silence. &ldquo;I think  I took too much blooming water,&rdquo; said Jim, rubbing his stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you just did then,&rdquo;  and Mamma looked anxiously at him. &ldquo; &rsquo;Twas enough to kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow might just as well be  killed as stewed to death!&rdquo; and Jim closed his eyes again.</p>
<p>A horseman rode up to the front  door and called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ken Kerry,&rdquo; Jim  drawled, &ldquo;I know his squeaky voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, jump up and see what he  wants,&rdquo; Mamma urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you, Mamma. I&rsquo;ve got  appendicitus,&rdquo; and Jim rubbed his stomach again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No blessed wonder&mdash;five glasses  of water!&rdquo; and Mamma left the machine and went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old Captain&rsquo;s gone, Mrs.  Dick,&rdquo; Ken Kerry said, with tears in his voice.</p>
<p>Mamma got a shock. &ldquo;What, dead,  Ken?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This mornin&rsquo; at breakfus&rsquo;  time,&rdquo; Ken answered.</p>
<p>Mamma expressed her sorrow, and  asked if anything could be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, everyone is busy  harvestin&rsquo; just now,&rdquo; Ken murmured, &ldquo;but if I could get some one to give me a  hand to bury him, to&mdash;er&mdash;dig&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course you&rsquo;ll get  help,&rdquo; Mamma hurriedly interrupted. &ldquo;Just wait a minute.&rdquo; And returning to Jim  she told him that poor old Captain Kerry was dead, and suggested he help Ken to  dig the grave.</p>
<p>Jim got a fright, and leaving  the couch followed her back to the verandah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could come right away  an&rsquo; give me a hand, Jim,&rdquo; Ken drawled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be erbliged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder where Pa is!&rdquo; and Jim  stared across the glistening fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t want your  father to come and do it!&rdquo; Mamma snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only he&rsquo;s done more of that  sort of work,&rdquo; Jim mentioned, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s a knack in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no use waiting for  your father,&rdquo; Mamma insisted; &ldquo;and if you don&rsquo;t like doing it, I&rsquo;ll go and  help Ken myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; Jim said; &ldquo;get  the tools ready and I&rsquo;ll be after y&rsquo; in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken nodded, and cantered away.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * *</p>
<p>Jim started off <i>via</i> the head-house. Seeing Grandpa  sitting on the verandah he shouted to him that Captain Kerry was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never were a captain!&rdquo;  Grandpa grunted. &ldquo;That wer&rsquo; th&rsquo; name he got when he wer&rsquo; bullock drivin&rsquo; 40  year ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, it don&rsquo;t much matter  to him now,&rdquo; Jim mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old wer&rsquo; he?&rdquo; Grandpa  inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wer&rsquo; a young man,&rdquo; and  Grandpa leaned back in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a colt,&rdquo; and grinning  hard, Jim passed on.</p>
<p>At the slip-rails he was met by  Ken, who conducted him to the site selected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to bury him at  home, then?&rdquo; Jim remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs, oh, yairs,&rdquo; And taking  the pick, Ken commenced digging.</p>
<p>For hours they toiled and  sweated, picking and hacking out clods and stones. Out of respect for Ken&rsquo;s  feelings, Jim maintained a silence throughout. And Ken wasn&rsquo;t one to talk  unnecessarily himself.</p>
<p>Nearly sunset. The hole was  down deeper than themselves. Ken climbed out of it and said he would go and  bring a pot of tea from the house. Jim sat on the bottom of the cold, damp  grave and rested. An evil, creepy feeling came over him. He shook himself and  raised his eyes to the mouth of the hole. A face appeared and looked down at  him and then disappeared. It was old Captain Kerry&rsquo;s. Jim&rsquo;s heart missed beats.  Cold perspiration started from him. Some loose gravel tumbled down, then old  Kerry&rsquo;s face appeared again. Jim up and out of that grave. Without looking to  left or right he ran&mdash;ran till he met Ken returning with the tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Ken asked.</p>
<p>Jim told him whom he had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Ken assured  him. &ldquo;He was there all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who the devil did we dig  the grave for?&rdquo; Jim asked wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dig the grave for?&rdquo; Ken  repeated, puzzled looking. &ldquo;Why for Captain, the old pet kanga.&rdquo; </p>

  A Surprise</b></h2>
<p>Saturday afternoon; the  farm-hands returning to the fields. Pa and Uncle Joe crouched beneath the seed  drill unscrewing and screwing nuts, and maligning the man who invented the  machine, and the manufacturer who made it, and the lying agent who induced  Grandpa to buy it. Uncle Dan hunting round the sheds in search of eggs.</p>
<p>Grandpa hobbled from the house  on a tour of inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why ain&rsquo;t y&rsquo; down th&rsquo; paddock  doin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; with that,&rdquo; he said, looking at the drill, &ldquo;instead o&rsquo; hammerin&rsquo;  an&rsquo; foolin&rsquo; about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s th&rsquo; good of bein&rsquo; down  th&rsquo; paddock with a thing that misses more than it sows, and that don&rsquo;t cover  what it do sow!&rdquo; Pa said, crawling round the machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This drill&rsquo;s d-d-done,&rdquo; Uncle  Joe stuttered; &ldquo;I could s-s-sow as well with me hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course you could, o&rsquo; course  you could! Anyone could!&rdquo; Grandpa agreed. &ldquo;I always said they was a waste o&rsquo;  money them things, and what&rsquo;s more they spoils th&rsquo; seed. (To Pa): Sow it wi&rsquo;  your hand, boy, sow it wi&rsquo; your hand. Put a bag round your neck and sow it same  as I used to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sow a &rsquo;undred and fifty acres  with me hand?&rdquo; and Pa grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, y&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t do it wi&rsquo;  your feet would y&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could just as well as with  me hands,&rdquo; and Pa grinned more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell thet thing,&rdquo; Grandpa  insisted, &ldquo;sell it to someone who believes in &rsquo;em, for a pound or a couple o&rsquo;  pound more &rsquo;n it cost if y&rsquo; can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim and Sammy, dressed in  riding boots and breeches, and mounted on polo ponies pranced past. Grandpa  leaned on his sticks and glared at them. &ldquo;Where are they goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to have a game o&rsquo; polo,&rdquo;  Pa told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A game o&rsquo; polo!&rdquo; Grandpa  gasped. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t there nothin&rsquo; about th&rsquo; place for &rsquo;em to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose there is if they like  to look for it,&rdquo; Pa chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for it!&rdquo; roared Grandpa.  &ldquo;Well, why th&rsquo; devil don&rsquo;t they look for it?&rdquo;&mdash;waving his stick&mdash; &ldquo;Are they goin&rsquo;  to ride off like jukes and governors in th&rsquo; middle of th&rsquo; day to wherever they  like&mdash;are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; needn&rsquo;t lose y&rsquo;r temper,&rdquo;  Pa said, crawling further under the drill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needn&rsquo;t lose my temper!  Needn&rsquo;t lose my temper!&rdquo; Grandpa stammered. &ldquo;Dammit, ain&rsquo;t it everythin&rsquo; about  th&rsquo; place I&rsquo;ll be losin&rsquo; soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here!&rdquo; and Pa poked  his head through the hoes of the drill. &ldquo;The young chaps as is growin&rsquo; up these  days ain&rsquo;t like what we used to be (meaning Uncle Joe and himself). They won&rsquo;t  work all night and all day, and every day, for y&rsquo;. If they don&rsquo;t get a bit o&rsquo;  time to themselves they won&rsquo;t work at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t work at all!&rdquo; and  Grandpa struck one of the hoes with his stick, near Pa&rsquo;s head, and Pa pulled  his head back; &ldquo;dammit, make them work, same as I used to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was all very fine for  you,&rdquo; and Pa crawled from beneath the machine, &ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You try and m-m-make Sammy  work S-S-Saturday afternoon,&rdquo; Uncle Joe, shoving his head through the spokes of  the wheel, put in; &ldquo;and s-s-see how y&rsquo; get on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn Sammy!&rdquo; Grandpa snorted.</p>
<p>And just then a motor-car  appeared at the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s them members o&rsquo;  Parliament back again lookin&rsquo; for y&rsquo;,&rdquo; Pa, pointing to the car, interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Members o&rsquo; Parliament?&rdquo; and  Grandpa stared across the yard. &ldquo;Is they?&rdquo; Then off he strutted to meet them.</p>
<p>Pa and Uncle Joe went on  mending the drill.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * *</p>
<p>Next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were them members o&rsquo;  Parliament wantin&rsquo;, Nell?&rdquo; Pa asked confidentially.</p>
<p>Nell shook her head and smiled,  and said she thought &ldquo;everyone would know it soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a week later everyone did  know it. The whole country side knew it.</p>
<p>In bold type the newspapers  announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;New appointment to the Upper  House,&rdquo; and gave Grandpa&rsquo;s name and address in full.</p>
<p>Talk about a surprise! We did  get a surprise. Pa&rsquo;s hand wasn&rsquo;t steady enough to hold the newspaper. Pa was  proud of Grandpa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do y&rsquo; think of the old  man, now?&rdquo; he cried, thumping Uncle Joe cheerfully on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there was  s-s-somethin&rsquo; in th&rsquo; w-w-wind,&rdquo; Uncle Joe answered, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t th-think it  was th-that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Uncle Dan and Jim and  Sammy and the farm-hands gathered round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandpa&rsquo;s been made M.L.C.,&rdquo;  Pa informed them excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And left me out of it again,&rdquo;  Uncle Dan observed, reaching for the newspaper.</p>
<p>The farm-hands laughed, and one  said that Grandpa would be called &ldquo;the honorable&rdquo; all his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what thousands  would like to be called,&rdquo; Pa claimed proudly.</p>
<p>Sammy asked what a M.L.C. had  to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everythin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Pa said;  &ldquo;everythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sits in th&rsquo; House,&rdquo; Uncle  Dan, who voted Labor, explained cynically, &ldquo;with long hats on, an&rsquo; chucks out  everythin&rsquo; the Labor party brings in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not them,&rdquo; Pa said, in defence  of the House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if they bring in a  policeman?&rdquo; Jim asked with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d go out just the same,&rdquo;  Uncle Dan affirmed; &ldquo;and so would St. Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pa looked round and saw a  stream of excited relations pouring into the head-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go! They&rsquo;ve heard  about it,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;And old Regan&rsquo;s amongst them, too. Look at old Regan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; not one o&rsquo; the lot o&rsquo; them  thinks that about him!&rdquo; and Uncle Dan snapped his fingers. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Pa grinned, &ldquo;<i>we&rsquo;ll</i> go and congratulate him, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went, and eagerly crowded  the front verandah.</p>
<p>Nell touched the slumbering  M.L.C. on the shoulder, and told him he was wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants me?&rdquo; and waking up  out of his chair, Grandpa stared at the gathering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Mr. Regan,&rdquo; Pa  suggested, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re th&rsquo; best at talkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regan removed his hat and  fumbled with his feet, and puffing hard, faced the lion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me ould frind,&rdquo; he commenced,  &ldquo;th&rsquo; divil himself couldn&rsquo;t feel a prouder mahn than ye yereself should be.  &rsquo;Twere a wise gorvermint&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here,&rdquo; Grandpa  interrupted, waving his hand, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear anythin&rsquo; about thet.&rdquo; And  turning to Nell, added: &ldquo;Fetch some whisky, gal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regan laughed, and as Nell  hurried away, rubbed his hands together.</p>
<p>Then Uncle Dan, with great  presence of mind, pushed forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, governor,&rdquo; he said, rising  to his full height, &ldquo;as your first born I &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, give him one, too, gal!  give him one,&rdquo; Grandpa interrupted.</p>
<p>Uncle Dan bowed agreeably and  took his place beside Regan, and poked Regan hard in the ribs. The others  enjoyed the proceedings.</p>
<p>Pa grinned, and came forward  nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And give Dicky a drop too,  gal; give Dicky a drop,&rdquo; Grandpa broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, I didn&rsquo;t come for that!&rdquo;  Pa protested,&rdquo; I come &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And put plenty o&rsquo; water with  Dicky&rsquo;s, gal; plenty o&rsquo; water,&rdquo; Grandpa insisted.</p>
<p>Pa stood down.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jim and Sammy had  been. putting their heads together in consultation. Sammy shoved Jim, and Jim  stepped boldly forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandpa!&rdquo; he commenced.</p>
<p>The others laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away, go away an&rsquo; ketch  flies, or nurse some o&rsquo; them babies!&rdquo; and Grandpa waved him off.</p>
<p>Jim turned red and crept back  to Sammy.</p>
<p>Then Regan raised his glass and  said: &ldquo;Ladies an&rsquo; gentlemin&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, drink it! Drink it!&rdquo;  Grandpa growled, &ldquo;an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t be spillin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regan drank it, so did Uncle  Dan and Pa. But Pa choked and coughed a lot over his.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * *</p>
<p>A month later.</p>
<p>The same crowd at the front  gate to see Grandpa off to the city to take &ldquo;his seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is packed in your  trunks,&rdquo; Mamma said, when her turn came to give Grandpa a parting handshake. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think we have forgotten anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his large foot planted on  the buggy step, the M.L.C. paused and looked at his luggage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Did y&rsquo; put in a pair o&rsquo; blue  blankets an&rsquo; a pillow?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Mamma looked at Nell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not blankets, surely, Grandpa?&rdquo;  Nell said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blankets, yes, o&rsquo; course I  wants blankets,&rdquo; said Grandpa. &ldquo;What would be th&rsquo; good o&rsquo; anyone goin&rsquo; to the  Upper House without &rsquo;em. Dammit, y&rsquo; don&rsquo;t expect me to sleep in me clothes, do  y&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="SomeNeighborsOfGrandpas"></a>Some Neighbors Of Grandpa&rsquo;s</b></h2>
<p>A winter&rsquo;s evening at  McClure&rsquo;s. A glowing fire and a large hanging lamp brightened the long  dining-room. Before the fire sat Minnie McClure perusing a letter, and at  intervals smiling over its contents. She turned her head and looked round  suspiciously. No signs of anyone approaching, she began reading aloud:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sweet dear little Duxie,<br>
  I am thinking of you every minute in the day. I would have wrote before now,  only I was waiting for a chance to go to town first to buy the ring (she paused  and smiled). I went yesterday and got it, and I&rsquo;m bringing it to give to you  to-night. And I made up my mind to ask your father for you this time no matter  what happens. But I hope he won&rsquo;t snort. Be on the look-out for me at 8 p.m. You  must work the oracle so as I can see him by himself, and I hope your little  brother won&rsquo;t be poking his nose in the road. Of course, though, I like him  nearly as much as I do my little Duxie herself, for all that he&rsquo;s such a fool!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your lonely old Bertie.</i></p>
<p>Peter McClure, the little  brother, who had been listening secretly at the door, knocked gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Bertie, now,&rdquo; and  stuffing the letter into her pocket, Minnie rose hurriedly. But instead of  going into her pocket the letter found its way to the floor.</p>
<p>Minnie opened the door and  admitted Peter. He grinned and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ye think I was lovely old  Bertie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away y go out of here, y&rsquo;  sneak; and stay in the kitchen. Cocking your ear and listening at the door! You  ought to be ashamed of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter guffawed, and ran round  the table. Minnie ran out for the broom.</p>
<p>Peter saw the letter on the  floor; lifted it, looked at it, grinned and stuffed it inside his shirt.</p>
<p>Minnie returned waving the  broom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me out! I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; Peter  cried. And Minnie willingly permitted him to go. At the door Peter grinned  triumphantly at her and disappeared.</p>
<p>Old Duncan and Mrs. McClure  entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are ye fichtin&rsquo; aboot?&rdquo;  Duncan enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Paw,&rdquo; Minnie lied,  and began knitting furiously at a sock.</p>
<p>The old folk seated themselves  comfortably at the table, and Duncan grunted and said: &ldquo;Cut for deal.&rdquo; Mrs.  McClure cut, and they started playing euchre.</p>
<p>Another knock at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Peter up to some more of  his tricks,&rdquo; and stealing stealthily across the room Minnie armed herself with  the broom, and stood with it uplifted beside the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The door opened and the Poor  Parson poked his head in. The broom descended with a &ldquo;swish&rdquo; and cleaved his  hat off.</p>
<p>Minnie squealed, and threw down  the broom, and made hysterical efforts to apologise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m very sorry&mdash;very  sorry,&rdquo; the Parson said, stooping and recovering his hat.</p>
<p>Duncan and Mrs. McClure  suddenly put down the cards, and the former snatching up the family bible that  was lying on the table bumped it down hard on top of the pack. Then both turned  and loudly upbraided Minnie, and sympathised with the reverend visitor.</p>
<p>The Parson said there was no  harm done: &ldquo;None whatever! None whatever! And Minnie only did it in fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shah! Her and her danged fun!&rdquo;  Duncan growled, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a&rsquo;ways at it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye ken weel ye shouldna&rsquo;,  Minnie!&rdquo; Mrs. McClure added, wagging her head. &ldquo;And ye ha&rsquo;e no richt tae be  a&rsquo;ways fichtin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; Peter the way ye do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minnie didn&rsquo;t know whether to  laugh or to cry about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bones broken! No  bones broken,&rdquo; and the Parson smiled soothingly.</p>
<p>Then he proceeded to state the  purpose of his visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come alang to ma den, Parson,&rdquo;  Duncan said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo;e a crack aboot it there.&rdquo; And he prepared to lead  the way to a room on the verandah.</p>
<p>But Mrs. McClure had a lot of  questions to ask the Parson about his wife and the children.</p>
<p>Duncan, with one eye on the  family bible that concealed the cards, urged the parson to hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on wi&rsquo; ye mon!&rdquo; he said  holding a side door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinna&rsquo; be sae rude, Duncan!&rdquo;  Mrs. McClure threw back at him; then asked the Parson some more questions.</p>
<p>The parson&rsquo;s eyes wandered to  the bible on the table, and anticipating him Duncan fairly yelled:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can ye no come on, mon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well did ever ye hear sic a  man?&rdquo; And Mrs. McClure glowered reproachfully at her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes. I beg your  pardon,&rdquo; the parson said. Then stepping quickly to the table. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a splendidly  bound bible&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang it!&rdquo; roared Duncan, &ldquo;ha&rsquo;e  ye no time tae look at bibles when ye&rsquo;re at hame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, it&rsquo;s a gude yun!&rdquo; proudly  from Mrs. McClure.</p>
<p>Duncan raised his two arms  above his head and seemed to be in a sort of fit.</p>
<p>The parson was about to lift  the volume when Peter, waving Minnie&rsquo;s letter, bounced in and diverted his  attention and saved Duncan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A letter for you, sir; you  dropped it outside near the door, sir,&rdquo; Peter lied maliciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A letter of mine?&rdquo; the Parson  said, taking the document. And while he examined it Duncan strode across to the  table and skilfully secured the cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t drop such a  letter,&rdquo; the Parson said with a grin, &ldquo;may be it belongs to some of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter lied again, and looked  out the corner of his eye at Minnie. But Minnie was knitting hard at the sock  and listening keenly for sounds at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it say, Parson?&rdquo;  Duncan asked good humouredly. &ldquo;Sit ye doon an&rsquo; read it oot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson sat with his back to  the table and cleared his throat for action, and read:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;My sweet dear little Duxie.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Minnie McClure looked up quickly,  and clutched at her dress pockets. Peter lay flat on his stomach across the  table and gaped and grinned over the Parson&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I am thinking of you every minute in the day. I would have wrote  before now only I was waiting for a chance to go to town first to buy the ring.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The Parson paused and smiled,  and rolled his eyes about. Minnie McClure stared in distress. Peter McClure  laughed loud, Duncan and Mrs. McClure wrinkled their brows and started thinking  hard.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I went yesterday and got it, and I&rsquo;m bringing it to give to you  to-night.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The Parson paused and grinned  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What th&rsquo; de&rsquo;il sort o&rsquo; a  letter is it at a&rsquo;?&rdquo; Duncan broke in loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, but it&rsquo;s a  love-letter!&rdquo; Mrs. McClure discovered.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I made up my mind to ask your father for you this time, no matter what  happens&mdash;I hope he won&rsquo;t&mdash; snort&mdash;&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Her old man must be a bit of a  brumby,&rdquo; Peter interrupted, lifting his head and mocking at Minnie&rsquo;s distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What idiot would write sic a  letter?&rdquo; Duncan put in.</p>
<p>The Parson shook his head  cheerfully, and proceeded :&mdash;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;&mdash; You must work the oracle for me so as I can see him by himself, and  I hope your little brother won&rsquo;t be poking his nose in.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Cripes, that&rsquo;s bosker!&rdquo; from  Peter, who elevated his feet above his back and kicked his heels together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter! Peter!&rdquo; And his mother  pushed him off the table.</p>
<p>Peter frowned at her, and as  soon as the Parson proceeded to read again promptly renewed his old position.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Of course, I like him though, nearly as much as I do my dear little  Duxie, herself, for all that he is such a fool.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the part that tickles  me most,&rdquo; and Peter looked across again at Minnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesna&rsquo; like her little  brither,&rdquo; from Duncan with a loud laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Your lonely old Bertie</i>,&rdquo;and the Parson put down the letter and  joined in the merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it does remind me o&rsquo; ma  courting days,&rdquo; Mrs. McClure sighed cheerfully, and wiped the tears of joy away  from her cheeks.</p>
<p>Duncan turned suddenly upon her  and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never writ ye a letter like  that, wumman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ken weel ye didna&rsquo;!&rdquo; and  Mrs. McClure struck a haughty attitude.</p>
<p>Peter sat up and stared at her  in amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I wasna&rsquo; the only pebble  on the beach?&rdquo; Duncan shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course ye wasna&rsquo;,&rdquo; and Mrs.  McClure wagged her head about proudly.</p>
<p>Duncan looked at Peter and  asked him what he thought of his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she had the lend o&rsquo;  you, Paw,&rdquo; Peter said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she hed,&rdquo; and Duncan  turned to the Parson again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does anyone know the write?&rdquo;  the Parson asked, holding up the letter.</p>
<p>Duncan examined the caligraphy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isna&rsquo; writin&rsquo; at a&rsquo;,  Parson,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dra&rsquo;in&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paintin&rsquo; in ink, that&rsquo;s what  it is,&rdquo; from Mrs. McClure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if a beetle fell into  the ink-pot and crawled over the paper,&rdquo; and Peter glanced slyly at Minnie.  Minnie scowled at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say a man&rsquo;s write portrays  his character,&rdquo; Duncan added, &ldquo;but that isna&rsquo; any write at a&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he can&rsquo;t have any  character, Paw,&rdquo; Peter guffawed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what shall we do with it?&rdquo;  the Parson asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gi&rsquo; it tae Minnie tae light  the fire wi&rsquo; in the morn. Come on, Parson!&rdquo; and leaving the table Duncan led  the way to his den again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps she may find an  owner for it,&rdquo; the Parson said, handing the letter to Minnie and following  McClure.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. McClure went off to  her room, and Peter found himself alone with Minnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; she said, facing  him with high explosives in her eye. Peter cleared three chairs in one jump and  vanished. Minnie sat down and ground her teeth and thought evil of everyone in  the house.</p>
<p>Black Lizzie with a broad grin  stole softly in, and jerking a thumb over her shoulder jabbered:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him been want it see you, Miss  Minnie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minnie looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants to see me?&rdquo; she  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, that fellow been  wear him clothes all a same a rainbow. Him walk it like fat fellow pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Lizzie waddled round the  room in imitation of a fat pig:.</p>
<p>Minnie looked more perplexed  than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All a same that fellow sit  down alonga creek. Put it arm here (indicating the neck) and kiss him you&mdash; eh?  Oh, by golly, I bin see him.&rdquo; And the black girl laughed wildly.</p>
<p>Minnie understood. &ldquo;Bertie? Oh,  it&rsquo;s Mr. Beatles, Lizzie! Is he here?&rdquo; And jumping up she began tidying her  hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beatle?&rdquo; Lizzie repeated. &ldquo;Him  been call Beatle, eh, golly,&rdquo; and she laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, tell Mr. Beatles to  come in, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been tell him. But why you  call him beetle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his name, silly! But  here, Lizzie (confidently), never you say to anyone that you saw Mr. Beatles  kissing me. If you do big fellow come down and punish you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By cripe, no,&rdquo; Lizzie  promised. &ldquo;I been tell no fella. I keep him secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she glided out the door,  and Mr. Beatles, arrayed in a loud check suit and a flaring neck tie and  twirling a bright straw hat in his hand with a gorgeous band around it, came  in. He capered about the room smiling and bowing to Minnie. Minnie smiled and  bowed to him, and called him Bertie, and invited him to sit down. He sat down  and laughed, and pulled Minnie down beside him. Then they crooned and giggled  and talked with their heads jambed against each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought it,&rdquo; Beatles  whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you, Bertie?&rdquo; Minnie  whispered back.</p>
<p>Then he produced the ring and  had just put it on Minnie&rsquo;s finger when McClure and the Parson blundered back  to the room talking loudly of the meanness and insincerity of one of the church  people.</p>
<p>Minnie and Beatles separated  hurriedly, and sat up straight and wide apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid he is a hopeless  quantity&mdash;a hopeless quantity,&rdquo; was the Parson&rsquo;s final judgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid he&rsquo;s a danged  lear!&rdquo; was Duncan&rsquo;s. Then their eyes rested on the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helloa!&rdquo; Duncan said, &ldquo;wha&rsquo;  ha&rsquo;e ye here, Minnie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatles and Minnie both stood  up. &ldquo;This is Mr. Beatles, Paw,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My Paw, Mr. Beatles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beatles? did ye say? It&rsquo;s a  queer name. But how are ye (holding out his hand). Ye didna&rsquo; fly in through the  window did ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minnie laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you knew my father,  sir?&rdquo; Beatles inquired. &ldquo;He was the pound-yard keeper for 45 years and six  months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didna&rsquo;!&rdquo; and Duncan shook  his head, &ldquo;but had he been the gaol-yard keeper for six months I micht ha&rsquo;e met  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Beatles, Mr. McCullock,&rdquo;  Minnie said, ignoring her parent&rsquo;s joke. &ldquo;Mr. McCullock, our minister, Mr.  Beatles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very pleased to make your  acquaintance, Mr. Beatles,&rdquo; the Parson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you are, sir; I know  you are, sir. I am the tick inspector for the Moogoola district, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, then you&rsquo;re th&rsquo; permeet  man?&rdquo; Duncan interrupted with fresh interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I issue permits, sir, to  travel stock from one place to another,&rdquo; Beatles confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And very often he has to write  out as many as one hundred permits in a day,&rdquo; Minnie added, smiling proudly  upon the official wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, and when a stockowner  gets a permeet, Parson,&rdquo; Duncan said disparagingly, &ldquo;he can drove stock hanging  wi&rsquo; ticks to the de&rsquo;il if he likes; but if he droves a poddy calfie tae th&rsquo;  creek an&rsquo; back wi&rsquo;oot a permeet they&rsquo;ll fine him fifty poon&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t blame me, sir, for  that,&rdquo; Beatles protested, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the Department&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Minnie put in  wisely, &ldquo;Mr. Beatles ain&rsquo;t to blame for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Duncan wasn&rsquo;t to be  silenced. &ldquo;Ye wouldna&rsquo; gi&rsquo; a person covered wi&rsquo; sins a permeet tae go tae  heaven would ye, Parson,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;an&rsquo; sen&rsquo; a saint tae hell because he  didna&rsquo; ask ye for one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Parson avoided the  question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you show our friend,  Mr. Beatles, that quaint letter we were reading, Minnie?&rdquo; he asked with a  smile.</p>
<p>Minnie started; then forced a  laugh, and said she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure it would help you to  entertain him,&rdquo; continued the Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; gravely from Duncan;  &ldquo;what did ye do wi&rsquo; you wunnerfu&rsquo; production?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Minnie blushed, and said she  tore it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye shouldna&rsquo; ha&rsquo;e destroyed  sic&rsquo; a gran&rsquo; work,&rdquo; Duncan observed.</p>
<p>Beatles became curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A love-letter, was it, sir?&rdquo;  he asked with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a lot of rubbish,&rdquo; and  Minnie laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, flowing ower wi&rsquo; love,&rdquo;  and Duncan shook his head solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed something then, by  coming late!&rdquo; and Beatles smiled on Minnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye couldna&rsquo; imagine just how  much ye missed,&rdquo; and Duncan shook his head again.</p>
<p>The Parson who had been  scratching his head and thinking hard, said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ran something like this,  Mr. Beatles:&mdash;<i>&lsquo;My sweet, dear little  Duxie,&mdash;I am thinking of you every moment in the day&mdash;&rsquo;</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatles jumped and turned and  looked hard at Minnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I would have wrote before now, only I was waiting for a chance to go to  town to buy the ring</i>&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatles jumped again, and his eyes rolled round and  round. Minnie shuddered, and turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I went yesterday and got it</i>&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the Parson&rsquo;s memory failed him.  &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the writer concluded by signing himself &lsquo;<i>your lonely old  Bertie</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought ta&rsquo;e ha&rsquo;e concluded  by hangin&rsquo; hissel&rsquo;,&rdquo; Duncan observed.</p>
<p>Then the Parson wished everyone  good-night and went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see ye off the premises,  Parson,&rdquo; and Duncan went out, too.</p>
<p>Beatles turned and faced  Minnie. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve found y&rsquo; out already!&rdquo; he said, like a judge passing sentence  on a burglar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bertie! Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t; wait  till you hear all!&rdquo; and Minnie advanced to him with outstretched arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard all I want to  hear!&rdquo; Beatles hissed through his teeth and stepped back from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Bertie!&rdquo; imploringly  from Minnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Showing my letter to a pair of  silly old wowsers!&rdquo; Beatles hissed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never,&rdquo; Minnie said, &ldquo;and  they are not wowsers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, they&rsquo;re a pair of  meddling d&mdash; old jackasses&mdash;and <i>you</i> to  deceive me like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minnie&rsquo;s attitude quickly  changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she snapped, &ldquo;if  you don&rsquo;t like to believe me when I tell you the truth, you needn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s  all! But I <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> show them your  letter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dammit!&rdquo; Beatles stamped his  foot. &ldquo;Do you think a man don&rsquo;t know his own letter when he hears a grinning  old sky-pilot reciting of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well <i>you</i> ought to know yours, anyway,&rdquo; with a sneer; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re such  silly, stupid things!&rdquo; and she laughed.</p>
<p>Beatles jumped, and grabbed his  hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s all coming out of  y&rsquo;,&rdquo; he gasped; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just th&rsquo; sort I thought you was! You&rsquo;re th&rsquo; first girl  that&rsquo;s had the loan o&rsquo; me, but by my old dead father, you&rsquo;ll be th&rsquo; last!&rdquo; and  he moved towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By your old dead father who  was the pound-yard keeper!&rdquo; Minnie laughed ironically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dirt! Dirt! Dirt!&rdquo; Beatles  hissed from the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some of your dirt!&rdquo;  throwing him back the ring. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen wearing a brummyjim. It might  poison me finger! Give it to someone who likes wearing cheap things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off!&rdquo; Beatles choking,  picking up the ring, &ldquo;and I leave you for ever, a free man, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to the war! A  free fat little man like you ought to have been at the front long ago. Won&rsquo;t  mother let you go? (laughing) or are you frightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats! Rats!&rdquo; and Beatles  dragged open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ticks! Ticks!&rdquo; Minnie  squealed, and next moment was alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone! I&rsquo;ve lost him!&rdquo; she  blubbered, &ldquo;and all through my own silly foolish fault!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then throwing herself into a  chair, and covering her face with her hands, she sobbed till&mdash;till Peter came  creeping in again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MyFirstBattle"></a>My First Battle</b></h2>
<p>A sham fight they called it,  but I reckon there was no sham whatever about it. And what a mob of us answered  our country&rsquo;s call! And without any compulsion, or route marches, or any of  those sort of circus tricks, either! We simply rushed and flocked like mad to  the colours.</p>
<p>And it took the buglers, and  the majors, and the Captains, and the little corporals half a day to form us into  marching order. But when they formed us we did them credit. The volunteers of  those days were fine looking men. I know they were because I was one of them.  But that has nothing to do with the battle.</p>
<p>Loaded almost to the ground  with rifles, haversacks, water bottles, bayonets and great-coats we waited  eagerly for the &ldquo;Quick <i>m-a-r-c-h!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then off we went. The band blared  forth &ldquo;Men of Harlech,&rdquo; and we stepped out briskly for the battlefield. Right  into Queen Street we swung, where thousands of girls, dozens deep, crowded to  watch us. We watched them, too. Then across Victoria Bridge, the one that was  washed away; along Stanley Street and into Woolloongabba we marched without  turning a hair. We felt we could go on marching to Eternity. But the girls  suddenly thinned out, and scowling, cynical men, and milk carts, and lorries,  filled their places. Then all at once the band stopped playing, and a rot set  in. Turning the music off was fatal. It was like stopping a man&rsquo;s credit  without giving him any warning. We went to pieces, and the rifles felt heavier  than crow-bars. We tripped, and brushed, and lost step. We were thirsty, too,  and raised the water-bottles to our heads, and kept them there till they were  sucked dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Left, left&mdash;left, left</i>,&rdquo; the officers called, and we responded with  our right. But when the band recovered wind enough it struck up again, and we  were saved. It played us to the top of Galloway&rsquo;s Hill, Galloway&rsquo;s Hill was the  Pyramid of Brisbane, then. I don&rsquo;t know what it is now. On top of it, and all  over it, our army halted to bivouac. It bivouaced by pulling palings off fences  and boiling billy-cans, and eating and drinking everything it brought with it.  Then the rank and file joined in song and tobacco together. The officers  collected in a tent, and conferred about the enemy and strategy. The enemy was  the mounted infantry under Colonel Ricktickardo; and how to locate him and  frustrate his tricks were the problems they had to solve.</p>
<p>At intervals they called for  scouts to go out and see about him. And like the ravens that went from the ark,  those scouts would brace themselves up and fearlessly go forth into the night,  and never return. Others were then sent out to find traces of their fate, and  they wouldn&rsquo;t return either. Nearly half the strength of our forces was sent  looking for the other half.</p>
<p>At last the first scout sent  out stumbled back into camp with scarcely any uniform on, and wearing an enemy  hat. And with a violent attack of hiccoughs complained that the &ldquo;other (hic)  blokes wash all drink (hic) in&rsquo; wish thenemy ash (hic) Pine-applesh pub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that we were suddenly  ordered to stand to arms. We stood to arms. Then the real excitement commenced.  In hoarse whispers we were ordered to advance. We advanced down the hill on  tip-toe, nervously feeling for each other all the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down on your knees, men, and  crawl,&rdquo; came the next order.</p>
<p>Down we dropped and  crawled&mdash;crawled like kids and caterpillars through lantana, and holes in  fences. In the excitement a number of us became detached from the main body and  crawled over the edge of a water-hole containing mud and tins and decayed cats,  and made a great noise. We got a great surprise too.</p>
<p>But we got out again all right.  Frantically executing a series of flank movements we scrambled to the top, and  like shags drying their feathers on dead wood, sat on the edge of the hole  scraping mud off ourselves, and using bad language. Meanwhile the main body  crept right away from us, and we were lost.</p>
<p>Someone suggested coo-ee-ing  for the major, but the others, thinking of the enemy, threatened to throw him  back into the hole if he did&mdash;and he didn&rsquo;t. Then a lean, hollow-chested  law-clerk said he knew the way to Norman Creek bridge, and explained that once  there, we would be on the main road to Brisbane. We appointed that law-clerk  our captain, and told him that wherever he led we would follow&mdash;so long as he  led for the bridge, and Brisbane.</p>
<p>He rose and went off at the  double, and we followed, breaking and crashing through the lantana like  stampeding cattle. He led till a sickly light faintly flickered ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the bridge,&rdquo; he gasped  over his shoulder. From that on he hadn&rsquo;t pace enough to lead the slowest of  us. On we thundered, our captain at our heels. We reached the bridge. We raced  on to it. Half way across we felt it shake and tremble beneath us. We stopped  suddenly, and stared through the dim, dead-of-night light. A dark mass of  plumed heads bobbed up and down against the sky. Then the sound of horse-hooves  rattled on the decking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Kangaroos!&rdquo; our captain  gasped, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of us were struck  speechless. We had not been thinking of the enemy. Now it was either fight or  turn and fly for cover in the lantana. Our captain decided to give battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crouch down!&rdquo; he whispered,  &ldquo;and load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We crouched and loaded.</p>
<p>On came the enemy&mdash;the colonel&rsquo;s  plumes wagging carelessly as he led the advance on his great chestnut charger.  Another yard or two and we would be trampled through the floor of the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand and fire!&rdquo; cried our  captain. We jumped to it and fired point blank at the colonel. Great Napoleon! The plunging and noise of those  chargers slipping and gliding on the bridge was terrifying. And those  that didn&rsquo;t fall tried to jump right off. The colonel&rsquo;s charger stood on its  hind legs and waved its front ones at the stars. And while it pawed at the  Southern Cross we poured in another volley. The colonel, clinging to the  saddle, returned our fire with a round of military profanity. But we didn&rsquo;t  quail beneath it. We hurriedly loaded up again. Just then, we were unexpectedly  attacked from the rear.</p>
<p>Our main body, attracted by the  rifle fire, arrived at the double and rashly poured a volley into us. We were  helpless. We had no way of escape. But we didn&rsquo;t capitulate. We dropped our  rifles hurriedly, and climbing the parapet became neutrals. Then talk about  war! It <i>was</i> a war! Both sides began a  desperate offensive, and everything sounded like hell. In the thick of it all  someone poked the muzzle of his rifle up into the face of our captain astride  the parapet. He ducked suddenly to avoid the explosion, and fell off into the  dirty cold stream below, and dragged us with him! That was <i>my</i> first battle. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AfterTwentyYears"></a>After Twenty Years</b></h2>
<p>I met Steve on the verandah of  the township pub. As boys we had been boon companions, and went to school  together to Cornelius O&rsquo;Brien, at Emu Creek. The school, changed in appearance  now by time and the weather, and the addition of a back verandah and a flag  pole, and a fir tree, still stands on the main stock route about four miles  from the railway line.</p>
<p>We talked of old days, old  selections, old selectors, and numerous other old things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For three years after I left  school I stuck well to the old people,&rdquo; Steve said; &ldquo;stuck to them like grim  death till I saw that it meant nothink but work, work, work, and never a  sixpence for it! Then I got sick of it all, and cleared out. &hellip; That&rsquo;s over  twenty year ago, I s&rsquo;pose, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t sin or heerd from them since. That&rsquo;s  what&rsquo;s brought me back now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to make a few asides  to a blue cattle dog that affectionately poked its nose into his lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the old people have got on  well since then?&rdquo; I put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Med tons o&rsquo; money, I&rsquo;m told,&rdquo;  enthusiastically from Steve. &ldquo;But then y&rsquo; see the ol&rsquo; man, himself, wuz worse  nor a bullick to graft! An&rsquo; she wuz jist as bad. When y&rsquo; comes t&rsquo; look at it,  though,&rdquo; and Steve became philosophical, &ldquo;everything is changed an&rsquo; different  about here now, to what it wuz in them days. Look it all th&rsquo; cheese fact&rsquo;ries,  an&rsquo; th&rsquo; butter fact&rsquo;ries that&rsquo;s croppin&rsquo; up&mdash;like blanky musherooms. An&rsquo; see th&rsquo;  markets there is for everythin&rsquo;. Why there&rsquo;s no comparasing. Anyone who&rsquo;s got a  beast now kin sell it twenty times over. But before I left, the bloomin&rsquo;  butcher wouldn&rsquo;t take a fat bullick from the ol&rsquo; man in payment for half a  quid&rsquo;s worth o&rsquo; meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve paused again, and told  the cattle dog to go to the devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course I&rsquo;d been better, a  damn sight, if I&rsquo;d stopped with the ol&rsquo; man; anyone kin see that now. Still  I&rsquo;ve had a good time for all that, an&rsquo; he ain&rsquo;t any th&rsquo; worse for me leavin&rsquo;  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the railway gates,  opposite, where teams loaded with wheat, and chaff, and cheese were lumbering  through, two aged, grizzly faced, yet sturdy old farmers emerged, and deep in  conversation approached the pub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your old man coming  along, now, Steve,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;the one on the right. The other is the Squire of  Ropedale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I be interned if it  ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he answered with a broad, proud grin. &ldquo;And the same blanky old walk on  &rsquo;im that he alez had.&rdquo; And he stood up to get a good view of his approaching  parent.</p>
<p>Before mounting the pub  verandah the old farmers paused to finally settle a point of difference  concerning wool and the market for fat lambs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell,&rdquo; Steve said in a burst  of family pride and affection, &ldquo;jist look at him&mdash;polished boots, an&rsquo; collar an&rsquo;  tie on a week day. An&rsquo; a gold chain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old farmers stepped on to  the verandah and entered the bar.</p>
<p>Steve straightened himself up;  tightened his belt, pulled the collar ends of his Crimean shirt together, but  failed to button them because the button was missing, took off his old felt  hat, looked inside it and clapped it hard on his head again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When &rsquo;e comes out I&rsquo;ll word  &rsquo;im, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll git a &rsquo;ell of a surprise,&rdquo; and Steve winked and chuckled gladly  at me.</p>
<p>The old farmers came out.</p>
<p>Steve advanced and confidently  touched his parent on the shoulder.</p>
<p>The parent turned and stared at  him.</p>
<p>Steve squared up and grinned  proudly and familiarly into Dad&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got &rsquo;n advarntage o&rsquo; me mah  mahn,&rdquo; the latter said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve&mdash;your son,&rdquo; the other  exclaimed, joyfully removing his hat; &ldquo;now do y&rsquo; know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;ah have no son o&rsquo; thart  name,&rdquo; the parent answered indifferently. &ldquo;There wer&rsquo; one whaht went away agen  mah will when ah sed to &rsquo;im: &lsquo;See here, lad, if yow goes mahnd now there us  ends. Yow&rsquo;l be no laanger a son o&rsquo; mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And calmly turning away he  rejoined the &ldquo;squire&rdquo; of Ropedale, and walked off.</p>
<p>With a grin of disappointment  Steve turned to me and said:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Did ever y&rsquo; see sich a determint &mdash; ol&rsquo; ceow?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AlfredAlfreds"></a>Alfred Alfreds</b></h2>
<p>A quiet, sleepy, slow-moving  man was Alfred Alfreds, and he wore long hair and a stunted whisker.</p>
<p>At intervals he worked hard;  other intervals he didn&rsquo;t work at all. People who rushed and raced about the  district as though they only had a few minutes to live, and wanted to make a  fortune before dying, wondered how he managed to survive. Alfred, himself,  never wondered anything at all about it. He just went on surviving.</p>
<p>Upon all matters Alfred was  silent as the grave, and never complained or approved, or gave his opinion  about anything. He wasn&rsquo;t a talker; but a good listener. He would listen to  other people for hours, for days, for ever if necessary. No argument was too  profound or too senseless, or too pious, or too anything for Alfred to give ear  to.</p>
<p>Once when Grady, a Labour  politician, was arguing wildly with McCannister, a Liberal, the former appealed  to Alfred to decide whether it was the Labour or Liberal party that created the  fleet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it Andrew Fisher?&rdquo; he  yelled.</p>
<p>Alfred smiled, but didn&rsquo;t give  any decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it the Liberal  party&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it Joe Cook?&rdquo; McCannister shouted at Alfred.</p>
<p>Alfred smiled on him, too, but  didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; McCannister  claimed, turning to his opponent, &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t say it wasn&rsquo;t the Liberal party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he can&rsquo;t say it wasn&rsquo;t the  Labour party!&rdquo; And Grady appealed to Alfred again.</p>
<p>Alfred smiled some more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t say it <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> the Liberal party&mdash; isn&rsquo;t that  right?&rdquo; McCannister repeated.</p>
<p>Alfred never said anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew d&mdash; well he couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;  McCannister grunted in self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I knew d&mdash; well he couldn&rsquo;t  neither!&rdquo; and Grady wagged his head triumphantly.</p>
<p>Then they both walked across to  the pub and had a drink.</p>
<p>In his own way Alfred was a  progressive person; never absented himself from public meetings or gatherings  of any kind. If the object was to raise money for charities, or churches, or  patriotic purposes, or for giving a presentation to someone leaving the  district who didn&rsquo;t deserve it, Alfred would be first to attend, and would sit  in a front seat. But when the chairman would call upon those present to  intimate the amount of their donations Alfred was never counted amongst the  donators. And no one ever thought or suggested he should be. And no one but the  local banker knew that Alfred was at least a hundred sovereigns richer than any  other man in the district.</p>
<p>But the day when news arrived  that war had broken out, Alfred for the first time in public said something.</p>
<p>Grady and McCannister, and  Doyle and others collected at the township and discussed Germany&rsquo;s chances of  getting wiped out.</p>
<p>McCannister said the Kaiser  could put nine millions of men in the field in twenty-four hours. Grady said he  didn&rsquo;t care if he could put ninety millions in the field, England still would  lick her.</p>
<p>Doyle said he wasn&rsquo;t so sure of  that, and looked at Alfred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they orter have good  weather for it,&rdquo; Alfred said, looking at the sky.</p>
