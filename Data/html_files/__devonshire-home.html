</p>

<p>Each entry on the burial list has a link to a separate page for
that person which details all of the information which I have
gathered for that person. A list of all <i>references</i> used in
compiling the information is shown on the "Production Notes" page,
accessible from the link at the top of this page. The references
list may need to be consulted when viewing the "person" page as the
burial list contains details of the source(s) used to obtain the
information gathered about the person.</p>

<p>It is worth reading the page about the work of the Fosters,
which is also accessible from the link at the top of this page.
This couple did a great deal of work to help save details of many
of the people buried in Devonshire Street Cemetery. I have created
<a href="Foster-epitaph-index.pdf" target="_blank">an alphabetic
index of the people whose epitaphs appear in A G Foster's Epitaph
Book</a>.</p>

<p>Keith A. Johnson and Malcolm R. Sainty also did a great deal of
work to help save details of many of the people buried in the
cemetery. The pair provide much information about the cemetery and
burials therein in their book, <i>Sydney Burial Ground 1819 to
1901</i>.<sup>2</sup> The book also includes details of epitaphs
carved on more than 2,800 monuments in the cemetery. The
information was transcribed by Johnson and Sainty in 1969-1970. I
have added Johnson and Sainty's inscription number to the record
of each individual mentioned in the inscriptions and have also
provided a list of all of the Person Numbers (PN) relating to each
inscription, against each relevant individual. For example, if an
inscription has details of Mr and Mrs Brown, the PN numbers for both
individuals will appear on the records of both Mr and Mrs Brown.

<p>Beyond the book by Johnson and Sainty, much has been written
about the Devonshire Street cemetery, which was located adjacent to
Devonshire and Elizabeth Streets, Sydney. The site was proclaimed
for use as a cemetery from 29 January 1820, however there were a
few burials prior to the proclaimation date.</p>

<p>The Sydney Gazette of 29 January 1820 printed the
proclaimation:</p>

<p><i>...the new Burial Ground at the Brickfields, having undergone
the Ceremony of Consecration, is henceforth to be used exclusively
as the Place of Interment by the Inhabitants of Sydney and its
Neighbourhood. And the former Burial Ground, situated within the
Town of Sydney, having in Consequence of the Opening of the New
Burial Ground, according to the Ceremonies of the Church of
England, been securely shut up, by the Gate being closed, barred,
and locked, so as to preclude all Access thereto, unless on
Occasions of Necessity such as shall be authorised by the Assistant
Chaplain at Sydney, it is hereby notified, ordered, and directed,
that no Person or Persons shall enter the said Ground without
obtaining such Permission from the Assistant
Chaplain.</i><sup>1</sup>
</p>

<p>The land containing the cemetery was resumed in 1901 to make way
for the expansion of Central Railway Station. Johnson and Sainty
note that "more than 30,000 remains were uncovered at the time of
resumption of the cemetery. The total number buried between 1819
and 1888 will never be known with certainty. As separate interment
registers do not appear to have been maintained, those of the city
parishes of the relevant denomination should be consulted to
ascertain if they record the deceased that are
unidentified."<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>At the Australian Cemeteries Index (ACI) site, Wayne Hill has
contributed details of more than 6,800 of the 6,872 burials
detailed for Devonshire Street cemetery. That site is a free
internet site, dedicated to recording burials at Australian
cemeteries.</p>

<p>It should be noted that some of the entries on my list represent
"memorials" for people not buried at Devonshire Street, since
people sometimes added the names of loved ones, not buried at
Devonshire Street, to a headstone for a person who <i>was</i>
buried at Devonshire Street. Where "memorial" stones are
identified, the relevant name on the list will indicate this
fact.</p>

<p>According to the burial list which I have produced the last
burial took place on 6 February 1888.</p>

<p>I believe that my list is the most comprehensive single list
produced to date for Devonshire Street Cemetery and that it
provides a starting point for others to submit details of burials
for people at Devonshire Street which are not included on the list.
A form to submit details or queries is provided on the "Contact"
page. A link is provided on the menu at the top of this page. Of
course, evidence will be required to support the contention that
the burial took place at Devonshire Street cemetery.</p>

<p>There are sure to be changes and additions to the list as new
information comes to hand. If you make a note of the update date at
the bottom of the list of burials, you will be able to see, on a
later visit, whether it has been updated.</p>

<p>I have always thought of family history research being similar
to doing a jig-saw puzzle. We look for pieces to place into the
incomplete puzzle. Sometimes these pieces are easily discovered.
Sometimes they take some looking for. And sometimes, when we have
put into place all of the pieces to hand, we realise that there are
some "missing" pieces, which we hope to find in the bottom of the
cupboard, when we have time to look for them.</p>

<p>I hope that this list assists you in finding some of the pieces
for <i>your</i> family history puzzle.</p>
