<p>Camperdown cemetery was established in 1848 and became the
Church of England's principal burial ground in Sydney. It is now
the only surviving cemtery of the three main early cemeteries in
Sydney:</p>

<ul>
<li>The cemetery in George Street Sydney, now the site of Sydney
Town Hall,</li>

<li>The cemetery in Devonshire Street Sydney, now the site of
Central Railway Station, and</li>

<li>Camperdown cemetery.</li>
</ul>

<p>A list of all burials at Camperdown Cemetery is provided. Click
the relevant link in the menu, above. It might be helpful to read
the Production Notes page because the present area of the cemetary is
now substantially less than when people were buried. Part of the original
area was resumed to create the "Camperdown Memorial Rest Park."

<p>Although the cemetery is located in Church Street Newtown, it is
referred to as Camperdown cemetery because it was originally part
of a property named &quot;Camperdown.&quot; Subsequently the
suburbs of Newtown and Camperdown were named but the cemetery has
continued to be called Camperdown Cemetery and, sometimes, St
Stephen's Cemetery, because St Stephen's Anglican Church, Newtown,
is located in the grounds of the cemetery. Comprehensive
information about the cemetery is provided in a <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camperdown_Cemetery">Wikipedia
article</a>.</p>

<p>The first burial took place in 1849 and the final burial in
1948. In the first twenty years after its establishment about
16,000 burials were performed. In all, about 18,000 people were
buried in Camperdown Cemetery.</p>

<p>The land for the cemetery was purchased from Sir Maurice Charles
O'Connell, son-in-law of Governor Bligh, and the first interment at
Camperdown, strictly speaking a re-interment, was that of
O'Connell, who died in 1848, shortly before the cemetery was
opened. His remains were exhumed from Devonshire Street and
reburied at Camperown. Interestingly, Bligh's great-grandson,
Richard Stuart O'Connell, was was one the final burials in the
cemetery, nearly 100 years later. Sir Maurice O'Connell and Richard
Stuart O'Connell, bookends for all of those buried at Camperdown
Cemetery.</p>
