<h2><a id="ch0"></a>INTRODUCTION BY MIKE GROST</h2>

<p class="first">FIRST, some spade work. <i>The Triumphs of
Eugène Valmont</i> (collected in book form 1906) is a series of
eight short stories, but the individual tales were broken up into
chapters on book publication, to make the book look like a novel.
The individual stories, and their corresponding chapters,
are:</p>

<ol style="margin-left:25%">
  <li>"The Mystery of the Five Hundred Diamonds" (1-3);</li>

  <li>"The Siamese Twin of a Bomb-Thrower" (4-8);</li>

  <li>"The Clue of the Silver Spoons" (9-10);</li>

  <li>"Lord Chizelrigg's Missing Fortune" (11-12);</li>

  <li>"The Absent-Minded Coterie" (13-17);</li>

  <li>"The Ghost with the Clubfoot" (18-20);</li>

  <li>"The Liberation of Wyoming Ed" (21-22);</li>

  <li>"Lady Alicia's Emeralds" (23-24).</li>
</ol>

<p>The stories are somewhat unusual among the mystery story
sequences of the day in that they were not all written for one
magazine. Nor are the stories uniform in length, as is the
tradition among the typical one-magazine series, but range from
15 to 34 pages. Nor do the stories show any discernible sequence
or progression, unlike, say, Bennett's <i>The Loot of Cities</i>,
in which characters grow and develop, and one tale builds on
another.</p>

<p>The stories are very varied as well.</p>

<p>Several focus on clever con men, which is why Barr is tentatively placed here among the detective story writers inspired by rogue fiction. And in the spy story "The Siamese Twin of a Bomb-Thrower," Valmont himself takes of many of the techniques of the rogue hero, such as dual identities and clever schemes. </p>

<p>By contrast, "The Ghost with the Clubfoot" has elements of the supernatural detective story so popular in Edwardian England.</p>

<p>"The Liberation of Wyoming Ed" includes some Wild West elements, proving Barr was a fan of Bret Harte, then at the height of his popularity in England&mdash;he was loved by Doyle and Chesterton, for example. </p>

<p>And "Lord Chizelrigg's Missing Fortune" reminds one of the scientific detective story. Barr's description of a flashlight in "Ghost", at that time a new high tech device unfamiliar to most readers, is a wonderfully poetic piece of description. Barr also liked typewriters, and they turn up in a couple of his tales, reminding one that Barr's fellow Canadian Grant Allen was one of the first authors to use typewriters. </p>

<p>Barr's best tales include well constructed plots, full of
twists and turns. </p>

<p>Three of the recommended stories in <i>Valmont</i> are
puzzle-plot mystery stories: "The Clue of the Silver Spoons"
(1904), "Lord Chizelrigg's Missing Fortune", "The Ghost with the
Club-Foot". Two other recommended works are best described as
tales in which Valmont intervenes to thwart criminal intrigue:
"The Siamese Twin of a Bomb-Thrower" and "The Liberation of
Wyoming Ed". I didn't like "The Mystery of the Five Hundred
Diamonds" (1904), "The Absent-Minded Coterie" (1906) or "Lady
Alicia's Emeralds".</p>

<p>"The Siamese Twin of a Bomb-Thrower" comes long after
Stevenson's encounter with bomb-throwers in <i>More New Arabian
Nights</i> (1885), and Doyle's "An Exciting Christmas Eve"
(1883). Professor Stephen Knight's fine introduction to the 1997
Oxford paperback edition of <i>Valmont</i> has much useful analysis of Barr's influence from Doyle, especially from the first six stories in <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>.</p>

<p>"The Siamese Twin of a Bomb-Thrower" is best when imagining
the complex relations between Valmont, the police of two
countries, businessmen, government officials, and various kinds
of anarchists. Barr manages to dream up many paradoxes in these
relations.</p>

<p>"The Clue of the Silver Spoons" lacks a con-man. But the
characters do evoke the personalities and behaviors of Rogues.
They have the fancy clothes and elaborate manners often assumed
by Rogues, as well as cleverness beyond Valmont's skill, in some
cases. <span class="smcap"><i>Spoiler</i></span>. Everyone
Valmont meets in this tale outclasses him, in one way or another.
This too reminds one of the way Rogues often out-class the duped
protagonist of a true Rogue tale. The people Valmont meets often
surpass his original low estimation of them, also a sly comic
sign that he is being outdone.</p>

<p>The tone of Barr's fiction is comic. He is often described as
a satirical writer, but this does not seem to me to be an
especially accurate description of his works. His tales instead
tend toward sophisticated wit, paradox, elegant conversations,
clever repartee, and ingenious, off trail situations. This is a
tradition with roots in Saki and Wilde, and is a strain that pops
up in mystery fiction in Barr, Frederick Irving Anderson, and
T.S. Stribling.</p>

<p>Many of Barr's tales are driven by comic but frightening
villains. These are usually all-powerful older men, who will stop
at nothing at imposing their way on everyone around them. </p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I<br>

THE FINDING OF THE FATED FIVE HUNDRED</h2>

<p class="first">
WHEN I say I am called Valmont, the name will convey no
impression to the reader one way or another.   My occupation is
that of private detective in London, but if you ask any policeman
in Paris who Valmont was he will likely be able to tell you,
unless he is a recent recruit.  If you ask him where Valmont is
now, he may not know, yet I have a good deal to do with the
Parisian police.</p>

<p>For a period of seven years I was chief detective to the
Government of France, and if I am unable to prove myself a great
crime hunter, it is because the record of my career is in the
secret archives of Paris.</p>

<p>I may admit at the outset that I have no grievances to air.
The French Government considered itself justified in dismissing
me, and it did so. In this action it was quite within its right,
and I should be the last to dispute that right; but, on the other
hand, I consider myself justified in publishing the following
account of what actually occurred, especially as so many false
rumors have been put abroad concerning the case. However, as I
said at the beginning, I hold no grievance, because my worldly
affairs are now much more prosperous than they were in Paris, my
intimate knowledge of that city and the country of which it is
the capital bringing to me many cases with which I have dealt
more or less successfully since I established myself in
London.</p>

<p>Without further preliminary I shall at once plunge into an
account of the case which riveted the attention of the whole
world a little more than a decade ago.</p>

<p>The year 1893 was a prosperous twelve months for France. The
weather was good, the harvest excellent, and the wine of that
vintage is celebrated to this day. Everyone was well off and
reasonably happy, a marked contrast to the state of things a few
years later, when dissension over the Dreyfus case rent the
country in twain.</p>

<p>Newspaper readers may remember that in 1893 the Government of
France fell heir to an unexpected treasure which set the
civilized world agog, especially those inhabitants of it who are
interested in historical relics. This was the finding of the
diamond necklace in the Chateau de Chaumont, where it had rested
undiscovered for a century in a rubbish heap of an attic. I
believe it has not been questioned that this was the veritable
necklace which the court jeweler, Boehmer, hoped to sell to Marie
Antoinette, although how it came to be in the Château de Chaumont
no one has been able to form even a conjecture. For a hundred
years it was supposed that the necklace had been broken up in
London, and its half a thousand stones, great and small, sold
separately. It has always seemed strange to me that the Countess
de Lamotte-Valois, who was thought to have profited by the sale
of these jewels, should not have abandoned France if she
possessed money to leave that country, for exposure was
inevitable if she remained. Indeed, the unfortunate woman was
branded and imprisoned, and afterwards was dashed to death from
the third story of a London house, when, in the direst poverty,
she sought escape from the consequences of the debts she had
incurred.</p>

<p>I am not superstitious in the least, yet this celebrated piece
of treasure-trove seems actually to have exerted a malign
influence over everyone who had the misfortune to be connected
with it. Indeed, in a small way, I who write these words suffered
dismissal and disgrace, though I caught but one glimpse of this
dazzling scintillation of jewels. The jeweler who made the
necklace met financial ruin; the Queen for whom it was
constructed was beheaded; that high-born Prince Louis René
Edouard, Cardinal de Rohan, who purchased it, was flung into
prison; the unfortunate countess, who said she acted as
go-between until the transfer was concluded, clung for five awful
minutes to a London window sill before dropping to her death to
the flags below;  and now, a hundred and eight years later, up
comes this devil's display of fireworks to the light again!</p>

<p>Droulliard, the workingman who found the ancient box, seems to
have pried it open, and ignorant though he was&mdash;he had
probably never seen a diamond in his life before&mdash;realized
that a fortune was in his grasp. The baleful glitter from the
combination must have sent madness into his brain, working havoc
therein as though the shafts of brightness were those mysterious
rays which scientists have recently discovered. He might quite
easily have walked through the main gate of the chateau
unsuspected and unquestioned with the diamonds concealed about
his person, but instead of this he crept from the attic window on
to the steep roof, slipped to the eaves, fell to the ground, and
lay dead with a broken neck, while the necklace, intact,
shimmered in the sunlight beside his body.</p>

<p>No matter where these jewels had been found the Government
would have insisted that they belonged to the treasury of the
Republic; but as the Château de Chaumont was an historical
monument, and the property of France, there could be no question
regarding the ownership of the necklace. The Government at once
claimed it, and ordered it to be sent by a trustworthy military
man to Paris. It was carried safely and delivered promptly to the
authorities by Alfred Dreyfus, a young captain of artillery, to
whom its custody had been intrusted.</p>

<p>In spite of its fall from the tall tower neither case nor
jewels were perceptibly damaged. The lock of the box had
apparently been forced by Droulliard's hatchet, or perhaps by the
clasp-knife found on his body. On reaching the ground the lid had
flown open, and the necklace was thrown out.</p>

<p>I believe there was some discussion in the cabinet regarding
the fate of this ill-omened trophy, one section wishing it to be
placed in a museum on account of its historical interest, another
advocating the breaking up of the necklace and the selling of the
diamonds for what they would fetch. But a third party maintained
that the method to get the most money into the coffers of the
country was to sell the necklace as it stood, for as the world
now contains so many rich amateurs who collect undoubted
rarities, regardless of expense, the historic associations of the
jeweled collar would enhance the intrinsic value of the stones;
and, this view prevailing, it was announced that the necklace
would be sold by auction a month later in the rooms of Meyer,
Renault &amp; Co., in the Boulevard des Italiens, near the Bank of the Crédit-Lyonnais.</p>

<p>This announcement elicited much comment from the newspapers of
all countries, and it seemed that, from a financial point of view
at least, the decision of the Government had been wise, for it
speedily became evident that a notable coterie of wealthy buyers
would be congregated in Paris on the thirteenth (unlucky day for
me!) when the sale was to take place. But we of the inner circle
were made aware of another result somewhat more disquieting,
which was that the most expert criminals in the world were also
gathering like vultures upon the fair city. The honor of France
was at stake. Whoever bought that necklace must be assured of a
safe conduct out of the country. We might view with equanimity
whatever happened afterwards, but while he was a resident of
France his life and property must not be endangered. Thus it came
about that I was given full authority to insure that neither
murder nor theft nor both combined should be committed while the
purchaser of the necklace remained within our boundaries, and for
this purpose the police resources of France were placed
unreservedly at my disposal. If I failed there should be no one
to blame but myself; consequently, as I have remarked before, I
do not complain of my dismissal by the Government.</p>

<p>The broken lock of the jewel case had been very deftly
repaired by an expert locksmith, who in executing his task was so
unfortunate as to scratch a finger on the broken metal, whereupon
blood poisoning set in, and although his life was saved, he was
dismissed from the hospital with his right arm gone and his
usefulness destroyed.</p>

<p>When the jeweler Boehmer made the necklace he asked eight
hundred thousand dollars for it, but after years of
disappointment he was content to sell it to Cardinal de Rohan for
three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, to be liquidated in
three installments, not one of which was ever paid. This latter
amount was probably somewhere near the value of the five hundred
and sixteen separate stones, one of which was of tremendous size,
a very monarch of diamonds, holding its court among seventeen
brilliants each as large as a filbert. This iridescent
concentration of wealth was, as one might say, placed in my care,
and I had to see to it that no harm came to the necklace or to
its prospective owner until they were safely across the
boundaries of France.</p>

<p>The four weeks previous to the thirteenth proved a busy and
anxious time for me. Thousands, most of whom were actuated by
mere curiosity, wished to view the diamonds. We were compelled to
discriminate, and sometimes discriminated against the wrong
person, which caused unpleasantness. Three distinct attempts were
made to rob the safe, but luckily these criminal efforts were
frustrated, and so we came unscathed to the eventful thirteenth
of the month.</p>

<p>The sale was to begin at two o'clock, and on the morning of
that day I took the somewhat tyrannical precaution of having the
more dangerous of our own malefactors, and as many of the foreign
thieves as I could trump up charges against, laid by the heels.
Yet I knew very well it was not these rascals I had most to fear,
but the suave, well-groomed gentlemen, amply supplied with
unimpeachable credentials, stopping at our fine hotels and living
like princes. Many of these were foreigners against whom we could
prove nothing, and whose arrest might land us into temporary
international difficulties. Nevertheless, I had each of them
shadowed, and on the morning of the thirteenth if one of them had
even disputed a cab fare I should have had him in prison half an
hour later, and taken the consequences; but these gentlemen are
very shrewd and do not commit mistakes.</p>

<p>I made up a list of all the men in the world who were able or
likely to purchase the necklace. Many of them would not be
present in person at the auction rooms; their bidding would be
done by agents. This simplified matters a good deal, for the
agents kept me duly informed of their purposes, and, besides, an
agent who handles treasure every week is an adept at the
business, and does not need the protection which must surround an
amateur, who in nine cases out of ten has but scant idea of the
dangers that threaten him, beyond knowing that if he goes down a
dark street in a dangerous quarter he is likely to be maltreated
and robbed.</p>

<p>There were no less than sixteen clients all told, whom we
learned were to attend personally on the day of the sale, any one
of whom might well have made the purchase. The Marquis of
Warlingham and Lord Oxtead from England were well-known jewel
fanciers, while at least half a dozen millionaires were expected
from the United States, with a smattering from Germany, Austria,
and Russia, and one each from Italy, Belgium, and Holland.</p>

<p>Admission to the auction rooms was allowed by ticket only, to
be applied for at least a week in advance, applications to be
accompanied by satisfactory testimonials. It would possibly have
surprised many of the rich men collected there to know that they
sat cheek by jowl with some of the most noted thieves of England
and America, but I allowed this for two reasons: first, I wished
to keep these sharpers under my own eye until I knew who had
bought the necklace; and, secondly, I was desirous that they
should not know they were suspected.</p>

<p>I stationed trusty men outside on the Boulevard des Italiens,
each of whom knew by sight most of the probable purchasers of the
necklace. It was arranged that when the sale was over I should
walk out to the boulevard alongside the man who was the new owner
of the diamonds, and from that moment until he quitted France my
men were not to lose sight of him if he took personal custody of
the stones, instead of doing the sensible and proper thing of
having them insured and forwarded to his residence by some
responsible transit company, or depositing them in the bank. In
fact, I took every precaution that occurred to me. All police
Paris was on the <i>qui vive</i>, and felt itself pitted against
the scoundrelism of the world.</p>

<p>For one reason or another it was nearly half past two before
the sale began. There had been considerable delay because of
forged tickets, and, indeed, each order for admittance was so
closely scrutinized that this in itself took a good deal more
time than we anticipated. Every chair was occupied, and still a
number of the visitors were compelled to stand. I stationed
myself by the swinging doors at the entrance end of the hall,
where I could command a view of the entire assemblage. Some of my
men were placed with backs against the wall, while others were
distributed among the chairs, all in plain clothes. During the
sale the diamonds themselves were not displayed, but the box
containing them rested in front of the auctioneer, and three
policemen in uniform stood guard on either side.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II<br>

THE SCENE IN THE SALE ROOM</h2>

<p class="first">
VERY quietly the auctioneer began by saying that there was no
need for him to expatiate on the notable character of the
treasure he was privileged to offer for sale, and with this
preliminary he requested those present to bid. Some one offered
twenty thousand francs, which was received with much laughter;
then the bidding went steadily on until it reached nine hundred
thousand francs, which I knew to be less than half the reserve
the Government had placed upon the necklace. The contest advanced
more slowly until the million and a half was touched, and there
it hung fire for a time, while the auctioneer remarked that this
sum did not equal that which the maker of the necklace had
finally been forced to accept for it. After another pause he
added that, as the reserve was not exceeded, the necklace would
be withdrawn, and probably never again offered for sale. He
therefore urged those who were holding back to make their bids
now. At this the contest livened until the sum of two million
three hundred thousand francs had been offered, and now I knew
the necklace would be sold. Nearing the three million mark the
competition thinned down to a few dealers from Hamburg and the
Marquis of Warlingham, from England, when a voice that had not
yet been heard in the auction room was lifted in a tone of some
impatience: "One million dollars!"</p>

<p>There was an instant hush, followed by the scribbling of
pencils, as each person present reduced the sum to its equivalent
in his own currency&mdash;pounds for the English, francs for the
French, marks for the German, and so on. The aggressive tone and
the clear-cut face of the bidder proclaimed him an American, not
less than the financial denomination he had used. In a moment it
was realized that his bid was a clear leap of more than two
million francs, and a sigh went up from the audience as if this
settled it, and the great sale was done. Nevertheless the
auctioneer's hammer hovered over the lid of his desk, and he
looked up and down the long line of faces turned toward him. He
seemed reluctant to tap the board, but no one ventured to compete
against this tremendous sum, and with a sharp click the mallet
fell.</p>

<p>"What name?" he asked, bending over toward the customer.</p>

<p>"Cash," replied the American; "here's a check for the amount.
I'll take the diamonds with me."</p>

<p>"Your request is somewhat unusual," protested the auctioneer
mildly.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," interrupted the American; "you think
the check may not be cashed. You will notice it is drawn on the
Crédit-Lyonnais, which is practically next door. I must have the
jewels with me. Send round your messenger with the check; it will
take only a few minutes to find out whether or not the money is
there to meet it. The necklace is mine, and I insist on having
it."</p>

<p>The auctioneer with some demur handed the check to the
representative of the French Government who was present, and this
official himself went to the bank. There were some other things
to be sold, and the auctioneer endeavored to go on through the
list, but no one paid the slightest attention to him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was studying the countenance of the man who had
made the astounding bid, when I should instead have adjusted my
preparations to meet the new conditions now confronting me. Here
was a man about whom we knew nothing whatever. I had come to the
instant conclusion that he was a prince of criminals, and that a
sinister design, not at that moment fathomed by me, was on foot
to get possession of the jewels. The handing up of the check was
clearly a trick of some sort, and I fully expected the official
to return and say the draft was good. I determined to prevent
this man from getting the jewel box until I knew more of his
game. Quickly I removed from my place near the door to the
auctioneer's desk, having two objects in view: first, to warn the
auctioneer not to part with the treasure too easily; and, second,
to study the suspected man at closer range. Of all evil-doers the
American is most to be feared; he uses more ingenuity in the
planning of his projects, and will take greater risks in carrying
them out than any other malefactor on earth.</p>

<p>From my new station I saw there were two men to deal with. The
bidder's face was keen and intellectual; his hands refined,
ladylike, clean, and white, showing they were long divorced from
manual labor, if indeed they had ever done any useful work.
Coolness and imperturbability were his beyond a doubt. The
companion who sat at his right was of an entirely different
stamp. His hands were hairy and sun-tanned; his face bore the
stamp of grim determination and unflinching bravery. I knew that
these two types usually hunted in couples&mdash;the one to
scheme, the other to execute, and they always formed a
combination dangerous to encounter and difficult to
circumvent.</p>

<p>There was a buzz of conversation up and down the hall as these
two men talked together in low tones. I knew now that I was face
to face with the most hazardous problem of my life.</p>

<p>I whispered to the auctioneer, who bent his head to listen. He
knew very well who I was, of course.</p>

<p>"You must not give up the necklace," I began.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I am under the orders of the official from the Ministry of
the Interior. You must speak to him."</p>

<p>"I shall not fail to do so," I replied. "Nevertheless, do not
give up the box too readily."</p>

<p>"I am helpless," he protested with another shrug. "I obey the
orders of the Government."</p>

<p>Seeing it was useless to parley further with the auctioneer, I
set my wits at work to meet the new emergency. I felt convinced
that the check would prove to be genuine, and that the fraud,
wherever it lay, might not be disclosed in time to aid the
authorities. My duty, therefore, was to make sure we lost sight
of neither the buyer nor the thing bought. Of course, I could not
arrest the purchaser merely on suspicion; besides, it would make
the Government the laughing-stock of the world if it sold a case
of jewels and immediately placed the buyer in custody when it
itself had handed over his goods to him. Ridicule kills in
France. A breath of laughter may blow a government out of
existence in Paris much more effectually than will a whiff of
cannon smoke. My duty then was to give the Government full
warning, and never lose sight of my man until he was clear of
France; then my responsibility ended.</p>

<p>I took aside one of my own men in plain clothes and said to
him:</p>

<p>"You have seen the American who has bought the necklace?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. Go outside quietly and station yourself there. He
is likely to emerge presently with the jewels in his possession.
You are not to lose sight of either the man or the casket. I
shall follow him and be close behind him as he emerges, and you
are to shadow us. If he parts with the case you must be ready at
a sign from me to follow either the man or the jewels. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he answered, and left the room.</p>

<p>It is ever the unforeseen that baffles us; it is easy to be
wise after the event. I should have sent two men, and I have
often thought since how admirable is the regulation of the
Italian Government which sends out its policemen in pairs. Or I
should have given my man power to call for help, but even as it
was he did only half as well as I had a right to expect of him,
and the blunder he committed by a moment's dull-witted
hesitation&mdash;ah, well! there is no use in scolding. After all
the result might have been the same.</p>

<p>Just as my man disappeared between the two folding doors the
official from the Ministry of the interior entered. I intercepted
him about halfway on his journey from the door to the
auctioneer.</p>

<p>"Possibly the check appears to be genuine," I whispered to
him.</p>

<p>"But certainly," he replied pompously. He was an individual
greatly impressed with his own importance; a kind of character
with which it is always difficult to deal. Afterwards the
Government asserted that this official had warned me, and the
utterances of an empty-headed ass dressed in a little brief
authority, as the English poet says, were looked upon as the
epitome of wisdom.</p>

<p>"I advise you strongly not to hand over the necklace as has
been requested," I went on.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because I am convinced the bidder is a criminal."</p>

<p>"If you have proof of that, arrest him."</p>

<p>"I have no proof at the present moment, but I request you to
delay the delivery of the goods."</p>

<p>"That is absurd," he cried impatiently. "The necklace is his,
not ours. The money has already been transferred to the account
of the Government; we cannot retain the five million francs, and
refuse to hand over to him what he has bought with them," and so
the man left me standing there, nonplussed and anxious. The eyes
of everyone in the room had been turned on us during our brief
conversation, and now the official proceeded ostentatiously up
the room with a grand air of importance; then, with a bow and
flourish of the hand, he said dramatically:</p>

<p>"The jewels belong to monsieur."</p>

<p>The two Americans rose simultaneously, the taller holding out
his hand while the auctioneer passed to him the case he had
apparently paid so highly for. The American nonchalantly opened
the box and for the first time the electric radiance of the
jewels burst upon that audience, each member of which craned his
neck to behold it. It seemed to me a most reckless thing to do.
He examined the jewels minutely for a few moments, then snapped
the lid shut again, and calmly put the box in his outside pocket,
and I could not help noticing that the light overcoat he wore
possessed pockets made extraordinarily large, as if on purpose
for this very case. And now this amazing man walked serenely down
the room past miscreants who joyfully would have cut his throat
for even the smallest diamond in that conglomeration;  yet he did
not take the trouble to put his hand on the pocket which
contained the case, or in any way attempt to protect it. The
assemblage seemed stricken dumb by his audacity. His friend
followed closely at his heels, and the tall man disappeared
through the folding doors. Not so the other. He turned quickly,
and whipped two revolvers out of his pockets, which he presented
at the astonished crowd. There had been a movement on the part of
everyone to leave the room, but the sight of these deadly weapons
confronting them made each one shrink into his place again.</p>

<p>The man with his back to the door spoke in a loud and
domineering voice, asking the auctioneer to translate what he had
to say into French and German; he spoke in English.</p>

<p>"These here shiners are valuable; they belong to my friend who
has just gone out. Casting no reflections on the generality of
people in this room, there are, nevertheless, half a dozen
'crooks' among us whom my friend wishes to avoid. Now, no honest
man here will object to giving the buyer of that there trinket
five clear minutes in which to get away. It's only the 'crooks'
that can kick. I ask these five minutes as a favor, but if they
are not granted I am going to take them as a right. Any man who
moves will get shot."</p>

<p>"I am an honest man," I cried, "and I object. I am chief
detective of the French Government. Stand aside; the police will
protect your friend."</p>

<p>"Hold on, my son," warned the American, turning one weapon
directly upon me, while the other held a sort of roving
commission, pointing all over the room. "My friend is from New
York and he distrusts the police as much as he does the grafters.
You may be twenty detectives, but if you move before-that clock
strikes three, I'll bring you down, and don't you forget it."</p>

<p>It is one thing to face death in a fierce struggle, but quite
another to advance coldly upon it toward the muzzle of a pistol
held so steadily that there could be no chance of escape. The
gleam of determination in the man's eye convinced me he meant
what he said. I did not consider then, nor have I considered
since, that the next five minutes, precious as they were, would
be worth paying my life for. Apparently everyone else was of my
opinion, for none moved hand or foot until the clock slowly
struck three.</p>

<p>"Thank you, gentlemen," said the American, as he vanished
between the spring-doors. When I say vanished, I mean that word
and no other, because my men outside saw nothing of this
individual then or later. He vanished as if he had never existed,
and it was some hours before we found how this had been
accomplished.</p>

<p>I rushed out almost on his heels, as one might say, and
hurriedly questioned my waiting men. They had all seen the tall
American come out with the greatest leisureliness and stroll
toward the west As he was not the man any of them were looking
for they paid no further attention to him, as, indeed, is the
custom with our Parisian force. They have eyes for nothing but
what they are sent to look for, and this trait has its drawbacks
for their superiors.</p>

<p>I ran up the boulevard, my whole thought intent on the
diamonds and their owner. I knew my subordinate in command of the
men inside the hall would look after the scoundrel with the
pistols. A short distance up I found the stupid fellow I had sent
out, standing in a dazed manner at the corner of the Rue
Michodière, gazing alternately down that short street and toward
the Place de l'Opéra. The very fact that he was there furnished
proof that he had failed.</p>

<p>"Where is the American?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"He went down this street, sir."</p>

<p>"Then why are you standing here like a fool?"</p>

<p>"I followed him this far, when a man came up the Rue
Michodière, and without a word the American handed him the jewel
box, turning instantly down the street up which the other had
come. The other jumped into a cab, and drove toward the Place de
l'Opéra."</p>

<p>"And what did you do? Stood here like a post, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know what to do, sir. It all happened in a
moment."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you follow the cab?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know which to follow, sir, and the cab was gone
instantly while I watched the American."</p>

<p>"What was its number?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"You clod! Why didn't you call one of our men, whoever was
nearest, and leave him to shadow the American while you followed
the cab?"</p>

<p>"I did shout to the nearest man, sir, but he said you told him
to stay there and watch the English lord, and even before he had
spoken both American and cabman were out of sight."</p>

<p>"Was the man to whom he gave the box an American also?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, he was French."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"By his appearance and the words he spoke."</p>

<p>"I thought you said he didn't speak?"</p>

<p>"He did not speak to the American, sir, but he said to the
cabman, 'Drive to the Madeleine as quickly as you can.'"</p>

<p>"Describe the man."</p>

<p>"He was a head shorter than the American, wore a black beard
and mustache rather neatly trimmed, and seemed to be a superior
sort of artisan."</p>

<p>"You did not take the number of the cab. Should you know the
cabman if you saw him again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I think so."</p>

<p>Taking this fellow with me I returned to the now nearly empty
auction room and there gathered all my men about me. Each in his
notebook took down particulars of the cabman and his passenger
from the lips of my incompetent spy; next I dictated a full
description of the two Americans, then scattered my men to the
various railway stations of the lines leading out of Paris, with
orders to make inquiries of the police on duty there, and to
arrest one or more of the four persons described should they be
so fortunate as to find any of them.</p>

<p>I now learned how the rogue with the pistols vanished so
completely as he did. My subordinate in the auction room had
speedily solved the mystery. To the left of the main entrance of
the auction room was a door that gave private access to the rear
of the premises. As the attendant in charge confessed when
questioned, he had been bribed by the American earlier in the day
to leave this side door open and to allow the man to escape by
the goods entrance. Thus the ruffian did not appear on the
boulevard at all, and so had not been observed by any of my
men.</p>

<p>Taking my futile spy with me I returned to my own office, and
sent an order throughout the city that every cabman who had been
in the Boulevard des Italiens between half past two and half past
three that afternoon, should report immediately to me. The
examination of these men proved a very tedious business indeed,
but whatever other countries may say of us, we French are
patient, and if the haystack is searched long enough the needle
will be found. I did not discover the needle I was looking for,
but I came upon one quite as important, if not more so.</p>

<p>It was nearly ten o'clock at night when a cabman answered my
oft-repeated questions in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Did you take up a passenger a few minutes past three o'clock
on the Boulevard des Italiens, near the Crédit-Lyonnais? Had he a
short black beard? Did he carry a small box in his hand and order
you to drive to the Madeleine?"</p>

<p>The cabman seemed puzzled.</p>

<p>"He wore a short black beard when he got out of the cab," he
replied.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I drive a closed cab, sir. When he got in he was a
smooth-faced gentleman; when he got out he wore a short black
beard."</p>

<p>"Was he a Frenchman?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; he was a foreigner, either English or American."</p>

<p>"Was he carrying a box?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; he held in his hand a small leather bag."</p>

<p>"Where did he tell you to drive?"</p>

<p>"He told me to follow the cab in front, which had just driven
off very rapidly toward the Madeleine. In fact, I heard the man,
such as you describe, order the other cabman to drive to the
Madeleine. I had come alongside the curb when this man held up
his hand for a cab, but the open cab cut in ahead of me. Just
then my passenger stepped up and said in French, but with a
foreign accent: 'Follow that cab wherever it goes.'"</p>

<p>I turned with some indignation to my inefficient spy.</p>

<p>"You told me," I said, "that the American had gone down a side
street. Yet he evidently met a second man, obtained from him the
handbag, turned back, and got into the closed cab directly behind
you."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," stammered the spy, "I could not look in two
directions at the same time. The American certainly went down the
side street, but of course I watched the cab which contained the
jewels."</p>

<p>"And you saw nothing of the closed cab right at your
elbow?"</p>

<p>"The boulevard was full of cabs, sir, and the pavement crowded
with passers-by, as it always is at that hour of the day, and I
have only two eyes in my head." </p>

<p>"I am glad to know you had that many, for I was beginning to
think you were blind."</p>

<p>Although I said this, I knew in my heart it was useless to
censure the poor wretch, for the fault was entirely my own in not
sending two men, and in failing to guess the possibility of the
jewels and their owner being separated. Besides, here was a clew
to my hand at last, and no time must be lost in following it up.
So I continued my interrogation of the cabman.</p>

<p>"The other cab was an open vehicle, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You succeeded in following it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir. At the Madeleine the man in front redirected
the coachman, who turned to the left and drove to the Place de la
Concorde, then up the Champs Elysées to the Arch and so down the
Avenue de la Grande Armée, and the Avenue de Neuilly, to the Pont
de Neuilly, where it came to a standstill. My fare got out, and I
saw he now wore a short black beard, which he had evidently put
on inside the cab. He gave me a ten-franc piece, which was very
satisfactory."</p>

<p>"And the fare you were following? What did he do?"</p>

<p>"He also stepped out, paid the cabman, went down the bank of
the river and got on board a steam launch that seemed to be
waiting for him."</p>

<p>"Did he look behind, or appear to know that he was being
followed?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"And your fare?"</p>

<p>"He ran after the first man, and also went aboard the steam
launch, which instantly started down the river."</p>

<p>"And that was the last you saw of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"At what time did you reach the Pont de Neuilly?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, sir; I was compelled to drive rather fast, but
the distance is seven or eight kilometers."</p>

<p>"You would do it under the hour?"</p>

<p>"But certainly, under the hour."</p>

<p>"Then you must have reached Neuilly bridge about four
o'clock?"</p>

<p>"It is very likely, sir."</p>

<p>The plan of the tall American was now perfectly clear to me,
and it comprised nothing that was contrary to law. He had
evidently placed his luggage on board the steam launch in the
morning. The handbag had contained various materials which would
enable him to disguise himself, and this bag he had probably left
in some shop down the side street, or else some one was waiting
with it for him. The giving of the treasure to another man was
not so risky as it had at first appeared, because he instantly
followed that man, who was probably his confidential servant.
Despite the windings of the river there was ample time for the
launch to reach Havre before the American steamer sailed on
Saturday morning. I surmised it was his intention to come
alongside the steamer before she left her berth in Havre harbor,
and thus transfer himself and his belongings unperceived by
anyone on watch at the land side of the liner. </p>

<p>All this, of course, was perfectly justifiable, and seemed, in
truth, merely a well-laid scheme for escaping observation. His
only danger of being tracked was when he got into the cab. Once
away from the neighborhood of the Boulevard des Italiens he was
reasonably sure to evade pursuit, and the five minutes which his
friend with the pistols had won for him afforded just the time he
needed to get so far as the Place Madeleine, and after that
everything was easy. Yet, if it had not been for those five
minutes secured by coercion, I should not have found the
slightest excuse for arresting him. But he was accessory after
the act in that piece of illegality&mdash;in fact, it was
absolutely certain that he had been accessory before the act, and
guilty of conspiracy with the man who had presented firearms to
the auctioneer's audience, and who had interfered with an officer
in the discharge of his duty by threatening me and my men. So I
was now legally in the right if I arrested every person on board
that steam launch.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III<br>

THE MIDNIGHT RACE DOWN THE SEINE</h2>

<p class="first">
WITH a map of the river before me I proceeded to make some
calculations. It was now nearly ten o'clock at night. The launch
had had six hours in which to travel at its utmost speed. It was
doubtful if so small a vessel could make ten miles an hour, even
with the current in its favor, which is rather sluggish because
of the locks and the level country. Sixty miles would place her
beyond Meulan, which is fifty-eight miles from the Pont Royal,
and, of course, a lesser distance from the Pont de Neuilly. But
the navigation of the river is difficult at all times, and almost
impossible after dark. There were chances of the boat running
aground, and then there was the inevitable delay at the locks. So
I estimated that the launch could not yet have reached Meulan,
which was less than twenty-five miles from Paris by rail. Looking
up the time table I saw there were still two trains to Meulan,
the next at 10.25, which reached Meulan at 11.40. I therefore had
time to reach St. Lazare station, and accomplish some
telegraphing before the train left.</p>

<p>With three of my assistants I got into a cab and drove to the
station. On arrival I sent one of my men to hold the train while
I went into the telegraph office, cleared the wires, and got into
communication with the lock master at Meulan. He replied that no
steam launch had passed down since an hour before sunset. I then
instructed him to allow the yacht to enter the lock, close the
upper gate, let half of the water out, and hold the vessel there
until I came. I also ordered the local Meulan police to send
enough men to the lock to enforce this command. Lastly, I sent
messages all along the river asking the police to report to me on
the train the passage of the steam launch.</p>

<p>The 10.25 is a slow train, stopping at every station. However,
every drawback has its compensation, and these stoppages enabled
me to receive and to send telegraphic messages. I was quite well
aware that I might be on a fool's errand in going to Meulan. The
yacht could have put about before it had steamed a mile, and so
returned back to Paris. There had been no time to learn whether
this was so or not if I was to catch the 10.25. Also, it might
have landed its passengers anywhere along the river. I may say at
once that neither of these two things happened, and my
calculations regarding her movements were accurate to the letter.
But a trap most carefully set may be prematurely sprung by
inadvertence, or more often by the overzeal of some stupid ass
who fails to understand his instructions, or oversteps them if
they are understood. I received a most annoying telegram from
Denouval, a lock about thirteen miles above that of Meulan. The
local policeman, arriving at the lock, found that the yacht had
just cleared. The fool shouted to the captain to return,
threatening him with all the pains and penalties of the law if he
refused. The captain did refuse, rang on full speed ahead, and
disappeared in the darkness. Through this well-meant blunder of
an understrapper those on board the launch had received warning
that we were on their track. I telegraphed to the lock-keeper at
Denouval to allow no craft to pass toward Paris until further
orders. We thus held the launch in a thirteen mile stretch of
water, but the night was pitch dark, and passengers might be
landed on either bank with all France before them, over which to
effect their escape in any direction.</p>

<p>It was midnight when I reached the lock at Meulan, and, as was
to be expected, nothing had been seen or heard of the launch. It
gave me some satisfaction to telegraph to that dunderhead at
Denouval to walk along the river bank to Meulan, and report if he
learned the launch's whereabouts. We took up our quarters in the
lodge-keeper's house and waited. There was little sense in
sending men to scour the country at this time of night, for the
pursued were on the alert, and very unlikely to allow themselves
to be caught if they had gone ashore. On the other hand, there
was every chance that the captain would refuse to let them land,
because he must know his vessel was in a trap from which it could
not escape, and although the demand of the policeman at Denouval
was quite unauthorized, nevertheless the captain could not know
that, while he must be well aware of his danger in refusing to
obey a command from the authorities. Even if he got away for the
moment he must know that arrest was certain, and that his
punishment would be severe. His only plea could be that he had
not heard and understood the order to return. But this plea would
be invalidated if he aided in the escape of two men, whom he must
now know were wanted by the police. I was therefore very
confident that if his passengers asked to be set ashore, the
captain would refuse when he had had time to think about his own
danger. My estimate proved accurate, for toward one o'clock the
lock-keeper came in and said the green and red lights of an
approaching craft were visible, and as he spoke the yacht
whistled for the opening of the lock. I stood by the lock-keeper
while he opened the gates; my men and the local police were
concealed on each side of the lock. The launch came slowly in,
and as soon as it had done so I asked the captain to step ashore,
which he did.</p>

<p>"I wish a word with you," I said. "Follow me."</p>

<p>I took him into the lock-keeper's house and closed the
door.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To Havre."</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"Paris."</p>

<p>"From what quay?"</p>

<p>"From the Pont de Neuilly."</p>

<p>"When did you leave there?"</p>

<p>"At five minutes to four o'clock this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Yesterday afternoon, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Who engaged you to make this voyage?"</p>

<p>"An American; I do not know his name."</p>

<p>"He paid you well, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"He paid me what I asked."</p>

<p>"Have you received the money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I may inform you, captain, that I am Eugène Valmont, chief
detective of the French Government, and that all the police of
France at this moment are under my control. I ask you, therefore,
to be careful of your answers. You were ordered by a policeman at
Denouval to return. Why did you not do so?"</p>

<p>"The lock-keeper ordered me to return, but as he had no right
to order me, I went on."</p>

<p>"You know very well it was the police who ordered you, and you
ignored the command. Again I ask you why you did so."</p>

<p>"I did not know it was the police."</p>

<p>"I thought you would say that. You knew very well, but were
paid to take the risk, and it is likely to cost you dear. You had
two passengers aboard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you put them ashore between here and Denouval?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; but one of them went overboard, and we couldn't find
him again."</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"The short man."</p>

<p>"Then the American is still aboard?"</p>

<p>"What American, sir?"</p>

<p>"Captain, you must not trifle with me. The man who engaged you
is still aboard?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir; he has never been aboard."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that the second man who came on your
launch at the Pont de Neuilly is not the American who engaged
you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; the American was a smooth-faced man; this man wore a
black beard."</p>

<p>"Yes, a false beard."</p>

<p>"I did not know that, sir. I understood from the American that
I was to take but one passenger. One came aboard with a small box
in his hand; the other with a small bag. Each declared himself to
be the passenger in question. I did not know what to do, so I
left Paris with both of them on board."</p>

<p>"Then the tall man with the black beard is still with
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, captain, is there anything else you have to tell me? I
think you will find it better in the end to make a clean breast
of it."</p>

<p>The captain hesitated, turning his cap about in his hands for
a few moments, then he said:</p>

<p>"I am not sure that the first passenger went overboard of his
own accord. When the police hailed us at Denouval&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! you knew it was the police, then?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid after I left it might have been. You see, when
the bargain was made with me the American said that if I reached
Havre at a certain time a thousand francs extra would be paid to
me, so I was anxious to get along as quickly as I could. I told
him it was dangerous to navigate the Seine at night, but he paid
me well for attempting it. After the policeman called to us at
Denouval the man with the small box became very much excited, and
asked me to put him ashore, which I refused to do. The tall man
appeared to be watching him, never letting him get far away. When
I heard the splash in the water I ran aft, and I saw the tall man
putting the box which the other had held into his handbag,
although I said nothing of it at the time. We cruised back and
forth about the spot where the other man had gone overboard, but
saw nothing more of him. Then I came on to Meulan, intending to
give information about what I had seen. That is all I know of the
matter, sir."</p>

<p>"Was the man who had the jewels a Frenchman?"</p>

<p>"What jewels, sir?"</p>

<p>"The man with the small box."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir; he was French."</p>

<p>"You have hinted that the foreigner threw him overboard. What
grounds have you for such a belief if you did not see the
struggle?"</p>

<p>"The night is very dark, sir, and I did not see what happened.
I was at the wheel in the forward part of the launch, with my
back turned to these two. I heard a scream, then a splash. If the
man had jumped overboard as the other said he did, he would not
have screamed. Besides, as I told you, when I ran aft I saw the
foreigner put the little box in his handbag, which he shut up
quickly as if he did not wish me to notice."</p>

<p>"Very good, captain. If you have told the truth it will go
easy with you in the investigation that is to follow."</p>

<p>I now turned the captain over to one of my men, and ordered in
the foreigner with his bag and bogus black whiskers. Before
questioning him I ordered him to open the handbag, which he did
with evident reluctance. It was filled with false whiskers, false
mustaches, and various bottles, but on top of them all lay the
jewel case. I raised the lid and displayed that accursed
necklace. I looked up at the man, who stood there calmly enough,
saying nothing in spite of the overwhelming evidence against
him.</p>

<p>"Will you oblige me by removing your false beard?"</p>

<p>He did so at once, throwing it into the open bag. I knew the
moment I saw him that he was not the American, and thus my theory
had broken down, in one very important part at least. Informing
him who I was, and cautioning him to speak the truth, I asked how
he came in possession of the jewels.</p>

<p>"Am I under arrest?" he asked.</p>

<p>"But certainly," I replied.</p>

<p>"Of what am I accused?"</p>

<p>"You are accused, in the first place, of being in possession
of property which does not belong to you."</p>

<p>"I plead guilty to that. What in the second place?"</p>

<p>"In the second place, you may find yourself accused of
murder."</p>

<p>"I am innocent of the second charge. The man jumped
overboard."</p>

<p>"If that is true, why did he scream as he went over?"</p>

<p>"Because, too late to recover his balance, I seized this box
and held it."</p>

<p>"He was in rightful possession of the box; the owner gave it
to him."</p>

<p>"I admit that; I saw the owner give it to him."</p>

<p>"Then why should he jump overboard?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. He seemed to become panic-stricken when the
police at the last lock ordered us to return. He implored the
captain to put him ashore, and from that moment I watched him
keenly, expecting that if we drew near to the land he would
attempt to escape, as the captain had refused to beach the
launch. He remained quiet for about half an hour, seated on a
camp chair by the rail, with his eyes turned toward the shore,
trying, as I imagined, to penetrate the darkness and estimate the
distance. Then suddenly he sprang up and made his dash. I was
prepared for this and instantly caught the box from his hand. He
gave a half-turn, trying either to save himself or to retain the
box; then with a scream went down shoulders first into the water.
It all happened within a second after he leaped from his
chair."</p>

<p>"You admit yourself, then, indirectly at least, responsible
for his drowning?"</p>

<p>"I see no reason to suppose that the man was drowned. If able
to swim he could easily have reached the river bank. If unable to
swim, why should he attempt it encumbered by the box?"</p>

<p>"You believe he escaped, then?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"It will be lucky for you should that prove to be the
case."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"How did you come to be in the yacht at all?"</p>

<p>"I shall give you a full account of the affair, concealing
nothing. I am a private detective, with an office in London. I
was certain that some attempt would be made, probably by the most
expert criminals at large, to rob the possessor of this necklace.
I came over to Paris, anticipating trouble, determined to keep an
eye upon the jewel case if this proved possible. If the jewels
were stolen the crime was bound to be one of the most celebrated
in legal annals. I was present during the sale, and saw the buyer
of the necklace. I followed the official who went to the bank,
and thus learned that the money was behind the check. I then
stopped outside and waited for the buyer to appear. He held the
case in his hand."</p>

<p>"In his pocket, you mean?" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"He had it in his hand when I saw him. Then the man who
afterwards jumped overboard approached him, took the case without
a word, held up his hand for a cab, and when an open vehicle
approached the curb he stepped in, saying, 'The Madeleine.' I
hailed a closed cab, instructed the cabman to follow the first,
disguising myself with whiskers as near like those the man in
front wore as I had in my collection."</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>"As a detective you should know why I did it. I wished as
nearly as possible to resemble the man in front, so that if
necessity arose I could pretend that I was the person
commissioned to carry the jewel case. As a matter of fact, the
crisis arose when we came to the end of our cab journey. The
captain did not know which was his true passenger, and so let us
both remain aboard the launch. And now you have the whole
story."</p>

<p>"An extremely improbable one, sir. Even by your own account
you had no right to interfere in this business at all."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you there," he replied, with great
nonchalance, taking a card from his pocketbook, which he handed
to me.</p>

<p>"That is my London address; you may make inquiries, and you
will find I am exactly what I represent myself to be."</p>

<p>The first train for Paris left Meulan at eleven minutes past
four in the morning. It was now a quarter after two. I left the
captain, crew, and launch in charge of two of my men, with orders
to proceed to Paris as soon as it was daylight. I, supported by
the third man, waited at the station with our English prisoner,
and reached Paris at half past five in the morning.</p>

<p>The English prisoner, though severely interrogated by the
judge, stood by his story. Inquiry by the police in London proved
that what he said of himself was true. His case, however, began
to look very serious when two of the men from the launch asserted
that they had seen him push the Frenchman overboard, and their
statement could not be shaken. All our energies were bent for the
next two weeks on trying to find something of the identity of the
missing man, or to get any trace of the two Americans. If the
tall American were alive, it seemed incredible that he should not
have made application for the valuable property he had lost. All
attempts to trace him by means of the check on the
Crédit-Lyonnais proved futile. The bank pretended to give me
every assistance, but I sometimes doubt if it actually did so. It
had evidently been well paid for its services, and evinced no
impetuous desire to betray so good a customer.</p>

<p>We made inquiries about every missing man in Paris, but also
without result.</p>

<p>The case had excited much attention throughout the world, and
doubtless was published in full in the American papers. The
Englishman had been in custody three weeks when the Chief of
Police in Paris received the following letter:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">On my arrival in New York by the English
steamer Lucania, I was much amused to read in the papers accounts
of the exploits of detectives, French and English. I am sorry
that only one of them seems to be in prison; I think his French
confrère ought to be there also. I regret exceedingly, however,
that there is the rumor of the death by drowning of my friend
Martin Dubois, of 375, Rue aux Juifs, Rouen. If this is indeed
the case, he has met his death through the blunders of the
police. Nevertheless, I wish you would communicate with his
family at the address I have given, and assure them that I will
make arrangements for their future support.</p>

<p class="letter">I beg to inform you that I am a manufacturer of
imitation diamonds, and through extensive advertising succeeded
in accumulating a fortune of many millions. I was in Europe when
the necklace was found, and had in my possession over a thousand
imitation diamonds of my own manufacture. It occurred to me that
here was the opportunity of the most magnificent advertisement in
the world. I saw the necklace, received its measurements, and
also obtained photographs of it taken by the French Government.
Then I set my expert friend Martin Dubois at work, and with the
artificial stones I gave him he made an imitation necklace so
closely resembling the original that you apparently do not know
it is the unreal you have in your possession. I did not fear the
villainy of the crooks as much as the blundering of the police,
who would have protected me with brass-band vehemence if I could
not elude them. I knew that the detectives would overlook the
obvious, but would at once follow a clew if I provided one for
them. Consequently, I laid my plans, just as you have discovered,
and got Martin Dubois up from Rouen to carry the case I gave him
down to Havre. I had had another box prepared and wrapped in
brown paper, with my address in New York written thereon. The
moment I emerged from the auction room, while my friend the
cowboy was holding up the audience, I turned my face to the door,
took out the genuine diamonds from the case and slipped it into
the box I had prepared for mailing. Into the genuine case I put
the bogus diamonds. After handing the box to Dubois, I turned
down a side street, and then into another whose name I do not
know, and there in a shop with sealing wax and string did up the
real diamonds for posting. I labeled the package "Books," went to
the nearest post office, paid letter postage, and handed it over
unregistered, as if it were of no particular value. After this I
went to my rooms in the Grand Hotel, where I had been staying
under my own name for more than a month. Next morning I took
train for London, and the day after sailed from Liverpool on the
Lucania. I arrived before the Gascogne, which sailed from Havre
on Saturday, met my box at the Customs house, paid duty, and it
now reposes in my safe. I intend to construct an imitation
necklace which will be so like the genuine one that nobody can
tell the two apart; then I shall come to Europe and exhibit the
pair, for the publication of the truth of this matter will give
me the greatest advertisement that ever was.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">John P. Hazard</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>I at once communicated with Rouen and found Martin Dubois
alive and well. His first words were:</p>

<p>"I swear I did not steal the jewels."</p>

<p>He had swum ashore, tramped to Rouen, and kept quiet in great
fear while I was fruitlessly searching Paris for him.</p>

<p>It took Mr. Hazard longer to make his imitation necklace than
he supposed, and several years later he booked his passage with
the two necklaces on the ill-fated steamer <i>Bourgogne</i>, and
now rests beside them at the bottom of the Atlantic.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV<br>

THE ODDITIES OF THE ENGLISH</h2>

<p class="first">
THE events I have just related led to my dismissal by the
French Government. It was not because I had arrested an innocent
man; I had done that dozens of times before, with nothing said
about it. It was not because I had followed a wrong clew, or
because I had failed to solve the mystery of the five hundred
diamonds. Every detective follows a wrong clew now and then, and
every detective fails more often than he cares to admit. No. All
these things would not have shaken my position, but the
newspapers were so fortunate as to find something humorous in the
case, and for weeks Paris rang with laughter over my exploits and
my defeat. The fact that the chief French detective had placed
the most celebrated English detective into prison, and that each
of them were busily sleuth-hounding a bogus clew, deliberately
flung across their path by an amateur, roused all France to great
hilarity. The Government was furious. The Englishman was released
and I was dismissed. Since the year 1893 I have been a resident
of London.</p>

<p>When a man is, as one might say, the guest of a Country, it
does not become him to criticise that country.</p>

<p>I have studied this strange people with interest, and often
with astonishment, and if I now set down some of the differences
between the English and the French, I trust that no note of
criticism of the former will appear, even when my sympathies are
entirely with the latter. These differences have sunk deeply into
my mind, because, during the first years of my stay in London, my
lack of understanding them was often a cause of my own failure
when I thought I had success in hand. Many a time did I come to
the verge of starvation in Soho, through not appreciating the
peculiar trend of mind which causes an Englishman to do
inexplicable things&mdash;that is, of course, from my Gallic
standpoint. For instance, an arrested man is presumed to be
innocent until he is proved guilty. In England, if a murderer is
caught red-handed over his victim, he is held guiltless until the
judge sentences him. In France we make no such foolish
assumption, and although I admit that innocent men have sometimes
been punished, my experience enables me to state very
emphatically that this happens not nearly so often as the public
imagines. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred an innocent man
can at once prove his innocence without the least difficulty. I
hold it is his duty toward the state to run the very slight risk
of unjust imprisonment in order that obstacles may not be thrown
in the way of the conviction of real criminals. But it is
impossible to persuade an Englishman of this. <i>Mon Dieu!</i> I
have tried it often enough.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the bitterness of my disappointment when
I captured Felini, the Italian anarchist, in connection with the
Greenwich Park murder. At this time&mdash;it gives me no shame to
confess it&mdash;I was myself living in Soho, in a state of
extreme poverty. Having been employed so long by the French
Government, I had formed the absurd idea that the future depended
on my getting, not exactly a similar connection with Scotland
Yard, but at least a subordinate position on the police force
which would enable me to prove my capabilities, and lead to
promotion. I had no knowledge, at that time, of the immense
income which awaited me entirely outside the Government circle.
Whether it is contempt for the foreigner, as has often been
stated, or that native stolidity which spells complacency, the
British official of any class rarely thinks it worth his while to
discover the real cause of things in France, or Germany, or
Russia, but plods heavily on from one mistake to another. Take,
for example, those periodical outbursts of hatred against England
which appear in the continental press. They create a dangerous
international situation, and more than once have brought Britain
to the verge of a serious war. Britain sternly spends millions in
defense and preparation, whereas, if she would place in my hand
half a million pounds, I would guarantee to cause Britannia to be
proclaimed an angel with white wings in every European
country.</p>

<p>When I attempted to arrive at some connection with Scotland
Yard, I was invariably asked for my credentials. When I
proclaimed that I had been chief detective to the Republic of
France, I could see that this announcement made a serious
impression, but when I added that the Government of France had
dismissed me without credentials, recommendation, or pension,
official sympathy with officialism at once turned the tables
against me. And here I may be pardoned for pointing out another
portentous dissimilarity between the two lands which I think is
not at all to the credit of my countrymen.</p>

<p>I was summarily dismissed. You may say it was because I
failed, and it is true that in the case of the queen's necklace I
had undoubtedly failed, but, on the other hand, I had followed
unerringly the clew which lay in my path, and although the
conclusion was not in accordance with the facts, it was in
accordance with logic. No, I was not dismissed because I failed.
I had failed on various occasions before, as might happen to any
man in any profession. I was dismissed because I made France for
the moment the laughingstock of Europe and America. France
dismissed me because France had been laughed at. No Frenchman can
endure the turning of a joke against him, but the Englishman does
not appear to care in the least. So far as failure is concerned,
never had any man failed so egregiously as I did with Felini, a
slippery criminal who possessed all the bravery of a Frenchman
and all the subtlety of an Italian. Three times he was in my
hands&mdash;twice in Paris, once in Marseilles&mdash;and each
time he escaped me; yet I was not dismissed.</p>

<p>When I say that Signor Felini was as brave as a Frenchman,
perhaps I do him a little more than justice.</p>

<p>He was desperately afraid of one man, and that man was myself.
Our last interview in France he is not likely to forget, and
although he eluded me, he took good care to get into England as
fast as train and boat could carry him, and never again, while I
was at the head of the French detective force, did he set foot on
French soil. He was an educated villain, a graduate of the
University of Turin, who spoke Spanish, French, and English as
well as his own language, and this education made him all the
more dangerous when he turned his talents to crime.</p>

<p>Now, I knew Felini's handiwork, either in murder or in
housebreaking, as well as I know my own signature on a piece of
white paper, and as soon as I saw the body of the murdered man in
Greenwich Park I was certain Felini was the murderer. The English
authorities at that time looked upon me with a tolerant,
good-natured contempt.</p>

<p>Inspector Standish assumed the manner of a man placing at my
disposal plenty of rope with which I might entangle myself. He
appeared to think me excitable, and used soothing expressions as
if I were a fractious child to be calmed, rather than a sane
equal to be reasoned with. On many occasions I had the facts at
my finger's ends, while he remained in a state of most complacent
ignorance, and though this attitude of lowering himself to deal
gently with one whom he evidently looked upon as an irresponsible
lunatic was most exasperating, I nevertheless claim great credit
for having kept my temper with him. However, it turned out to be
impossible for me to overcome his insular prejudice. He always
supposed me to be a frivolous, volatile person, and so I was
unable to prove myself of any value to him in his arduous
duties.</p>

<p>The Felini instance was my last endeavor to win his favor.
Inspector Standish appeared in his most amiable mood when I was
admitted to his presence, and this in spite of the fact that all
London was ringing with the Greenwich Park tragedy, while the
police possessed not the faintest idea regarding the crime or its
perpetrator. I judged from Inspector Standish's benevolent smile
that I was somewhat excited when I spoke to him, and perhaps used
many gestures which seemed superfluous to a large man whom I
should describe as immovable, and who Spoke slowly, with no
motion of his hand, as if his utterances were the condensed
wisdom of the ages.</p>

<p>"Inspector Standish," I cried, "is it within your power to
arrest a man on suspicion?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is," he replied; "but we must harbor the
suspicion before we make the arrest."</p>

<p>"Have confidence in me," I exclaimed. "The man who committed
the Greenwich Park murder is an Italian named Felini."</p>

<p>I gave the address of the exact room in which he was to be
found, with cautions regarding the elusive nature of this
individual. I said that he had been three times in my custody,
and those three times he had slipped through my fingers. I have
since thought that Inspector Standish did not credit a word I had
spoken.</p>

<p>"What is your proof against this Italian?" asked the inspector
slowly.</p>

<p>"The proof is on the body of the murdered man; but,
nevertheless, if you suddenly confront Felini with me without
giving him any hint of whom he is going to meet, you shall have
the evidence from his own lips before he recovers from his
surprise and fright."</p>

<p>Something of my confidence must have impressed the official,
for the order of arrest was made. Now, during the absence of the
constable sent to bring in Felini, I explained to the inspector
fully the details of my plan. Practically he did not listen to
me, for his head was bent over a writing pad on which I thought
he was taking down my remarks, but when I had finished he went on
writing as before, so I saw I had flattered myself unnecessarily.
More than two hours passed before the constable returned,
bringing with him the trembling Italian. I swung round in front
of him, and cried, in a menacing voice:</p>

<p>"Felini! Regard me! You know Valmont too well to trifle with
him! What have you to say of the murder in Greenwich Park?"</p>

<p>I give you my word that the Italian collapsed, and would have
fallen to the floor in a heap had not the constables upheld him
with hands under each arm. His face became of a pasty whiteness,
and he began to stammer his confession, when this incredible
thing happened, which could not be believed in France. Inspector
Stan-dish held up his finger.</p>

<p>"One moment," he cautioned solemnly; "remember that whatever
you say will be used against you!"</p>

<p>The quick, beady black eyes of the Italian shot from Standish
to me, and from me to Standish. In an instant his alert mind
grasped the situation. Metaphorically I had been waved aside. I
was not there in any official capacity, and he saw in a moment
with what an opaque intellect he had to deal. The Italian closed
his mouth like a steel trap, and refused to utter a word. Shortly
after he was liberated, as there was no evidence against him.
When at last complete proof was in the tardy hands of the British
authorities, the agile Felini was safe in the Apennine Mountains,
and to-day is serving a life sentence in Italy for the
assassination of a senator whose name I have forgotten.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that I threw up my hands in despair at
finding myself among such a people? But this was in the early
days, and now that I have greater experience of the English, many
of my first opinions have been modified.</p>

<p>I mention all this to explain why, in a private capacity, I
often did what no English official would dare to do. A people who
will send a policeman, without even a pistol to protect him, to
arrest a desperate criminal in the most dangerous quarter of
London, cannot be comprehended by any native of France, Italy,
Spain, or Germany. When I began to succeed as a private detective
in London, and had accumulated money enough for my project, I
determined not to be hampered by this unexplainable softness of
the English toward an accused person. I therefore reconstructed
my flat, and placed in the center of it a dark room strong as any
Bastile cell. It was twelve feet square, and contained no
furniture except a number of shelves, a lavatory in one corner,
and a pallet on the floor. It was ventilated by two flues from
the center of the ceiling, in one of which operated an electric
fan, which, when the room was occupied, sent the foul air up that
flue, and drew down fresh air through the other. The entrance to
this cell opened out from my bedroom, and the most minute
inspection would have failed to reveal the door, which was of
massive steel, and was opened and shut by electric buttons that
were partially concealed by the head of my bed. Even if they had
been discovered, they would have revealed nothing, because the
first turn of the button lit the electric light at the head of my
bed; the second turn put it out; and this would happen as often
as the button was turned to the right. But turn it three times
slowly to the left, and the steel door opened. Its juncture was
completely concealed by paneling. I have brought many a scoundrel
to reason within the impregnable walls of that small room.</p>

<p>Those who know the building regulations of London will wonder
how it is possible for me to delude the Government inspector
during the erection of this section of the Bastile in the midst
of the modern metropolis. It was the simplest thing in the world.
Liberty of the subject is the first great rule with the English
people, and thus many a criminal is allowed to escape. Here was
I, laying plans for the contravening of this first great rule,
and to do so I took advantage of the second great rule of the
English people, which is, that property is sacred. I told the
building authorities I was a rich man with a great distrust of
banks, and I wished to build in my flat a safe or strong room in
which to deposit my valuables. I built then such a room as may be
found in every bank, and many private premises of the City, and a
tenant might have lived in my flat for a year and never suspect
the existence of this prison. A railway engine might have
screeched its whistle within it, and not a sound would have
penetrated the apartment that surrounded it unless the door
leading to it had been left open.</p>

<p>But besides M. Eugène Valmont, dressed in elegant attire, as
if he were still a <i>boulevardier</i> of Paris, occupier of the
top floor in the Imperial Flats, there was another Frenchman in
London to whom I must introduce you, namely, Prof. Paul Ducharme,
who occupied a squalid back room in the cheapest and most
undesirable quarter of Soho. Valmont flatters himself he is not
yet middle-aged, but poor Ducharme does not need his sparse gray
beard to proclaim his advancing years. Valmont vaunts an air of
prosperity; Ducharme wears the shabby habiliments and the
shoulder stoop of hopeless poverty. He shuffles cringingly along
the street, a compatriot not to be proud of. There are so many
Frenchmen anxious to give lessons in their language, that merely
a small living is to be picked up by any one of them. You will
never see the spruce Valmont walking alongside the dejected
Ducharme.</p>

<p>"Ah!" you exclaim, "Valmont in his prosperity has forgotten
those less fortunate of his nationality."</p>

<p>Pardon, my friends, it is not so. Behold, I proclaim to you,
the exquisite Valmont and the threadbare Ducharme are one and the
same person. That is why they do not promenade together. And,
indeed, it requires no great histrionic art on my part to act the
role of the miserable Ducharme, for when I first came to London I
warded off starvation in this wretched room, and my hand it was
that nailed to the door the painted sign, "Professor Paul
Ducharme, Teacher of the French Language." I never gave up the
room, even when I became prosperous and moved to Imperial Flats,
with its concealed chamber of horrors unknown to British
authority. I did not give up the Soho chamber principally for
this reason: Paul Ducharme, if the truth were known about him,
would have been regarded as a dangerous character; yet this was a
character sometimes necessary for me to assume. He was a member
of the very inner circle of the International, an anarchist of
the anarchists. This malign organization has its real
headquarters in London, and we who were officials connected with
the secret service of the Continent have more than once cursed
the complacency of the British Government which allows such a
nest of vipers to exist practically unmolested. I confess that
before I came to know the English people as well as I do now, I
thought that this complacency was due to utter selfishness,
because the anarchists never commit an outrage in England.
England is the one spot on the map of Europe where an anarchist
cannot be laid by the heels unless there is evidence against him
that will stand the test of open court. Anarchists take advantage
of this fact, and plots are hatched in London which are executed
in Paris, Berlin, Petersburg, or Madrid. I know now that this
leniency on the part of the British Government does not arise
from craft, but from their unexplainable devotion to their
shibboleth&mdash;"The liberty of the subject." Time and again
France has demanded the extradition of an anarchist, always to be
met with the question: "Where is your proof?"</p>

<p>I know many instances where our certainty was absolute, and
also cases where we possessed legal proof as well, but legal
proof which, for one reason or another, we dared not use in
public; yet all this had no effect on the British authorities.
They would never give up even the vilest criminal except on
publicly attested legal evidence, and not even then if the crime
were political.</p>

<p>During my term of office under the French Government, no part
of my duties caused me more anxiety than that which pertained to
the political secret societies. Of course, with a large portion
of the Secret Service fund at my disposal, I was able to buy
expert assistance, and even to get information from anarchists
themselves. This latter device, however, was always more or less
unreliable. I have never yet met an anarchist I could believe on
oath, and when one of them offered to sell exclusive information
to the police, we rarely knew whether he was merely trying to get
a few francs to keep himself from starving, or whether he was
giving us false particulars which would lead us into a trap. I
have always regarded our dealings with nihilists, anarchists, or
other secret associations for the perpetrating of murder as the
most dangerous service a detective is called upon to perform. Yet
it is absolutely necessary that the authorities should know what
is going on in these secret conclaves. There are three methods of
getting this intelligence. First, periodical raids upon the
suspected, accompanied by confiscation and search of all papers
found. This method is much in favor with the Russian police. I
have always regarded it as largely futile: first, because the
anarchists are not such fools, speaking generally, as to commit
their purposes to writing; and, second, because it leads to
reprisal. Each raid is usually followed by a fresh outbreak of
activity on the part of those left free. The second method is to
bribe an anarchist to betray his comrades. I have never found any
difficulty in getting these gentry to accept money. They are
eternally in need, but I usually find the information they give
in return to be either unimportant or inaccurate. There remains,
then, the third method, which is to place a spy among them. The
spy battalion is the forlorn hope of the detective service. In
one year I lost three men on anarchist duty, among the victims
being my most valuable helper, Henri Brisson. Poor Brisson's fate
was an example of how a man may follow a perilous occupation for
months with safety, and then by a slight mistake bring disaster
on himself.</p>

<p>At the last gathering Brisson attended he received news of
such immediate and fateful import that, on emerging from the
cellar where the gathering was held, he made directly for my
residence instead of going to his own squalid room in the Rue
Falgarie. My concierge said that he arrived shortly after one
o'clock in the morning, and it would seem that at this hour he
could easily have made himself acquainted with the fact that he
was followed. Still, as there was on his track that human
panther, Felini, it is not strange poor Brisson failed to elude
him.</p>

<p>Arriving at the tall building in which my flat was then
situated, Brisson rang the bell, and the concierge, as usual, in
that strange state of semisomnolence which envelops concierges
during the night, pulled the looped wire at the head of his bed,
and unbolted the door. Brisson assuredly closed the huge door
behind him, and yet, the moment before he did so, Felini must
have slipped in unnoticed to the stone-paved courtyard. If
Brisson had not spoken and announced himself, the concierge would
have been wide-awake in an instant. If he had given a name
unknown to the concierge, the same result would have ensued. As
it was, he cried aloud, "Brisson!" whereupon the concierge of the
famous chief of the French detective staff, Valmont, muttered,
<i>"Bon!"</i> and was instantly asleep again.</p>

<p>Now Felini had known Brisson well, but it was under the name
of Revensky, and as an exiled Russian. Brisson had spent all his
early years in Russia, and spoke the language like a native. The
moment Brisson had uttered his true name he had pronounced his
own death warrant. Felini followed him up to the first
landing&mdash;my rooms were on the second floor&mdash;and there
placed his sign manual on the unfortunate man, which was the
swift downward stroke of a long, narrow, sharp poniard, entering
the body below the shoulders, and piercing the heart. The
advantage presented by this terrible blow is that the victim
sinks instantly in a heap at the feet of his slayer, without
uttering a moan. The wound left is a scarcely perceptible blue
mark which rarely even bleeds. It was this mark I saw on the body
of the Maire of Marseilles, and afterwards on one other in Paris
besides poor Brisson. It was the mark found on the man in
Greenwich Park, always just below the left shoulder blade, struck
from behind. Felini's comrades claim that there was this nobility
in his action, namely, he allowed the traitor to prove himself
before he struck the blow. I should be sorry to take away this
poor shred of credit from Felini's character, but the reason he
followed Brisson into the courtyard was to give himself time to
escape. He knew perfectly the ways of the concierge. He knew that
the body would lie there until the morning, as it actually did,
and that this would give him hours in which to effect his
retreat. And this was the man whom British law warned not to
incriminate himself! What a people! What a people!</p>

<p>After Brisson's tragic death, I resolved to set no more
valuable men on the track of the anarchists, but to place upon
myself the task in my moments of relaxation. I became very much
interested in the underground workings of the International. I
joined the organization under the name of Paul Ducharme, a
professor of advanced opinions, who because of them had been
dismissed from his situation in Nantes. As a matter of fact,
there had been such a Paul Ducharme, who had been so dismissed,
but he had drowned himself in the Loire, at Orleans, as the
records show. I adopted the precaution of getting a photograph of
this foolish old man from the police at Nantes, and made myself
up to resemble him. It says much for my disguise that I was
recognized as the professor by a delegate from Nantes, at the
annual convention held in Paris, which I attended, and although
we conversed for some time together he never suspected that I was
not the professor, whose fate was known to no one but the police
of Orleans. I gained much credit among my comrades because of
this encounter, which, during its first few moments, filled me
with dismay, for the delegate from Nantes held me up as an
example of a man well off, who had deliberately sacrificed his
worldly position for the sake of principle. Shortly after this I
was chosen delegate to carry a message to our comrades in London,
and this delicate undertaking passed off without mishap.</p>

<p>It was perhaps natural, then, that when I came to London after
my dismissal by the French Government, I should assume the name
and appearance of Paul Ducharme, and adopt the profession of
French teacher. This profession gave me great advantages. I could
be absent from my rooms for hours at a time without attracting
the least attention, because a teacher goes wherever there are
pupils. If any of my anarchist comrades saw me emerging shabbily
from the grand Imperial Flats where Valmont lived, he greeted me
affably, thinking I was coming from a pupil.</p>

<p>The sumptuous flat was therefore the office in which I
received my rich clients, while the squalid room in Soho was
often the workshop in which the tasks intrusted to me were
brought to completion.</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V<br>

THE SIAMESE TWIN OF A BOMB-THROWER</h2>

<p class="first">
I NOW come to very modern days indeed, when I spent much time
with the emissaries of the International.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the King of England made a round of
visits to European capitals, the far-reaching results of which in
the interest of peace we perhaps do not yet fully understand and
appreciate. His visit to Paris was the beginning of the present
<i>entente cordiale</i>, and I betray no confidence when I say
that this brief official call at the French capital was the
occasion of great anxiety to the Government of my own country and
also of that in which I was domiciled. Anarchists are against all
governments, and would like to see each one destroyed, not even
excepting that of Great Britain.</p>

<p>My task in connection with the visit of King Edward to Paris
was entirely unofficial. A nobleman, for whom on a previous
occasion I had been so happy as to solve a little mystery which
troubled him, complimented me by calling at my flat about two
weeks before the king's entry into the French capital. I know I
shall be pardoned if I fail to mention this nobleman's name. I
gathered that the intended visit of the king met with his
disapproval. He asked if I knew anything, or could discover
anything, of the purposes animating the anarchist clubs of Paris,
and their attitude toward the royal function, which was now the
chief topic in the newspapers. I replied that within four days I
would be able to submit to him a complete report on the subject
He bowed coldly and withdrew. On the evening of the fourth day I
permitted myself the happiness of waiting upon his lordship at
his West End London mansion.</p>

<p>"I have the honor to report to your lordship," I began, "that
the anarchists of Paris are somewhat divided in their opinions
regarding his Majesty's forthcoming progress through that city. A
minority, contemptible in point of number, but important so far
as the extremity of their opinions are concerned, has been
trying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," interrupted the nobleman, with some severity of
tone; "are they going to attempt to injure the king or not?"</p>

<p>"They are not, your lordship," I replied, with what, I trust,
is my usual urbanity of manner, despite his curt interpolation.
"His most gracious Majesty will suffer no molestation, and their
reason for quiescence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Their reasons do not interest me," put in his lordship
gruffly. "You are sure of what you say?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly sure, your lordship."</p>

<p>"No precautions need be taken?"</p>

<p>"None in the least, your lordship."</p>

<p>"Very well," concluded the nobleman shortly. "If you tell my
secretary in the next room as you go out how much I owe you, he
will hand you a check," and with that I was dismissed.</p>

<p>I may say that, mixing as I do with the highest in two lands,
and meeting invariably such courtesy as I myself am always eager
to bestow, a feeling almost of resentment arose at this cavalier
treatment However, I merely bowed somewhat ceremoniously in
silence, and availed myself of the opportunity in the next room
to double my bill, which was paid without demur.</p>

<p>Now, if this nobleman had but listened, he would have heard
much that might interest an ordinary man, although I must say
that during my three conversations with him his mind seemed
closed to all outward impressions save and except the grandeur of
his line, which he traced back unblemished into the northern part
of my own country.</p>

<p>The king's visit had come as a surprise to the anarchists, and
they did not quite know what to do about it. The Paris Reds were
rather in favor of a demonstration, while London bade them, in
God's name, to hold their hands, for, as they pointed out,
England is the only refuge in which an anarchist is safe until
some particular crime can be imputed to him, and, what is more,
proven up to the hilt.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the visit of the king to Paris
passed off without incident, as did the return visit of the
president to London. On the surface all was peace and good will,
but under the surface seethed plot and counterplot, and behind
the scenes two great governments were extremely anxious, and high
officials in the Secret Service spent sleepless nights. As no
"untoward incident" had happened, the vigilance of the
authorities on both sides of the Channel relaxed at the very
moment when, if they had known their adversaries, it should have
been redoubled. Always beware of the anarchist when he has been
good: look out for the reaction. It annoys him to be compelled to
remain quiet when there is a grand opportunity for strutting
across the world's stage, and when he misses the psychological
moment he is apt to turn "nasty," as the English say.</p>

<p>When it first became known that there was to be a royal
procession through the streets of Paris, a few fanatical
hot-heads, both in that city and in London, wished to take
action, but they were overruled by the saner members of the
organization. It must not be supposed that anarchists are a band
of lunatics. There are able brains among them, and these born
leaders as naturally assume control in the underground world of
anarchy as would have been the case if they had devoted their
talents to affairs in ordinary life. They were men whose minds,
at one period, had taken the wrong turning. These people,
although they calmed the frenzy of the extremists, nevertheless
regarded the possible <i>rapprochement</i> between England and
France with grave apprehension. If France and England became as
friendly as France and Russia, might not the refuge which England
had given to anarchy become a thing of the past? I may say here
that my own weight as an anarchist while attending these meetings
in disguise under the name of Paul Ducharme was invariably
thrown in to help the cause of moderation. My role, of course,
was not to talk too much; not to make myself prominent; yet in
such a gathering a man cannot remain wholly a spectator. Care for
my own safety led me to be as inconspicuous as possible, for
members of communities banded together against the laws of the
land in which they live are extremely suspicious of one another,
and an inadvertent word may cause disaster to the person speaking
it.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this conservatism on my part that caused my
advice to be sought after by the inner circle, what you might
term the governing body of the anarchists; for, strange as it may
appear, this organization, sworn to put down all law and order,
was itself most rigidly governed, with a Russian prince elected
as its chairman, a man of striking ability, who, nevertheless, I
believe, owed his election more to the fact that he was a
nobleman than to the recognition of his intrinsic worth. And
another point which interested me much was that this prince ruled
his obstreperous subjects after the fashion of Russian despotism,
rather than according to the liberal ideas of the country in
which he was domiciled. I have known him more than once
ruthlessly overturn the action of the majority, stamp his foot,
smite his huge fist on the table, and declare so and so should
not be done, no matter what the vote was. And the thing was not
done, either.</p>

<p>At the more recent period of which I speak, the chairmanship
of the London anarchists was held by a weak, vacillating man, and
the mob had got somewhat out of hand. In the crisis that
confronted us I yearned for the firm fist and dominant boot of
the uncompromising Russian. I spoke only once during this time,
and assured my listeners that they had nothing to fear from the
coming friendship of the two nations. I said the Englishman was
so wedded to his grotesque ideas regarding the liberty of the
subject; he so worshiped absolute legal evidence, that we would
never find our comrades disappear mysteriously from England as
had been the case in continental countries.</p>

<p>Although restless during the exchange of visits between king
and president, I believe I could have carried the English phalanx
with me, if the international courtesies had ended there. But
after it was announced that members of the British Parliament
were to meet the members of the French Legislature, the Paris
circle became alarmed, and when that conference did not end the
<i>entente</i>, but merely paved the way for a meeting of
business men belonging to the two countries in Paris, the French
anarchists sent a delegate over to us, who made a wild speech one
night, waving continually the red flag. This roused all our own
malcontents to a frenzy. The French speaker practically charged
the English contingent with cowardice; said that as they were
safe from molestation, they felt no sympathy for their comrades
in Paris, at any time liable to summary arrest and the torture of
the secret cross-examination. This Anglo-French love feast must
be wafted to the heavens in a halo of dynamite. The Paris
anarchists were determined, and although they wished the
cooperation of their London brethren, yet, if the speaker did not
bring back with him assurance of such cooperation, Paris would
act on its own initiative.</p>

<p>The Russian despot would have made short work of this
blood-blinded rhetoric, but, alas! he was absent, and an
overwhelming vote in favor of force was carried and accepted by
the trembling chairman. My French <i>confrère</i> took back with
him to Paris the unanimous consent of the English comrades to
whom he had appealed. All that was asked of the English
contingent was that it should arrange for the escape and
safe-keeping of the assassin who flung the bomb into the midst of
the English visitors; and after the oratorical madman had
departed, I, to my horror, was chosen to arrange for the safe
transport and future custody of the bomb thrower. It is not
etiquette in anarchist circles for any member to decline whatever
task is given him by the vote of his comrades. He knows the
alternative, which is suicide. If he declines the task and still
remains upon earth, the dilemma is solved for him, as the Italian
Felini solved it through the back of my unfortunate helper
Brisson. I therefore accepted the unwelcome office in silence,
and received from the treasurer the money necessary for carrying
out the same.</p>

<p>I realized for the first time since joining the anarchist
association years before that I was in genuine danger. A single
false step or a single inadvertent word, might close the career
of Eugène Valmont, and at the same moment terminate the existence
of the quiet, inoffensive Paul Ducharme, teacher of the French
language. I knew perfectly well I should be followed. The moment
I received the money the French delegate asked when they were to
expect me in Paris. He wished to know so that all the resources
of their organization might be placed at my disposal. I replied
calmly enough that I-could not state definitely on what day I
should leave England. There was plenty of time, as the business
men's representatives from London would not reach Paris for
another two weeks. I was well known to the majority of the Paris
organization, and would present myself before them on the first
night of my arrival. The Paris delegate exhibited all the energy
of a new recruit, and he seemed dissatisfied with my vagueness,
but I went on without heeding his displeasure. He was not
personally known to me, nor I to him, but, if I may say so, Paul
Ducharme was well thought of by all the rest of those
present.</p>

<p>I had learned a great lesson during the episode of the queen's
necklace, which resulted in my dismissal by the French
Government. I had learned that if you expect pursuit it is always
well to leave a clew for the pursuer to follow. Therefore I
continued in a low conversational tone:</p>

<p>"I shall want the whole of to-morrow for myself: I must notify
my pupils of my absence. Even if my pupils leave me it will not
so much matter. I can probably get others. But what does matter
is my secretarial work with Monsieur Valmont of the Imperial
Flats. I am just finishing for him the translation of a volume
from French into English, and to-morrow I can complete the work,
and get his permission to leave for a fortnight. This man, who is
a compatriot of my own, has given me employment ever since I came
to London. From him I have received the bulk of my income, and if
it had not been for his patronage, I do not know what I should
have done. I not only have no desire to offend him, but I wish
the secretarial work to continue when I return to London."</p>

<p>There was a murmur of approval at this. It was generally
recognized that a man's living should not be interfered with, if
possible. Anarchists are not poverty-stricken individuals, as
most people think, for many of them hold excellent situations,
some occupying positions of great trust, which is rarely
betrayed.</p>

<p>It is recognized that a man's duty, not only to himself, but
to the organization, is to make all the money he can, and thus
not be liable to fall back on the relief fund. This frank
admission of my dependence on Valmont made it all the more
impossible that anyone there listening should suspect that it was
Valmont himself who was addressing the conclave.</p>

<p>"You will then take the night train to-morrow for Paris?"
persisted the inquisitive French delegate.</p>

<p>"Yes and no. I shall take the night train, and it shall be for
Paris, but not from Charing Cross, Victoria, or Waterloo. I shall
travel on the 8.30 Continental express from Liverpool Street to
Harwich, cross to the Hook of Holland, and from there make my way
to Paris through Holland and Belgium. I wish to investigate that
route as a possible path for our comrade to escape. After
the blow is struck, Calais, Boulogne, Dieppe, and Havre
will be closely watched. I shall perhaps bring him to London by
way of Antwerp and the Hook."</p>

<p>These amiable disclosures were so fully in keeping with Paul
Ducharme's reputation for candor and caution, that I saw they
made an excellent impression on my audience, and here the
chairman intervened, putting an end to further cross-examination
by saying they all had the utmost confidence in the judgment of
Monsieur Paul Ducharme, and the Paris delegate might advise his
friends to be on the lookout for the London representative within
the next three or four days.</p>

<p>I left the meeting and went directly to my room in Soho,
without even taking the trouble to observe whether I was watched
or not. There I stayed all night, and in the morning quitted Soho
as Ducharme, with gray beard and bowed shoulders, walked west to
the Imperial Flats, took the lift to the top, and, seeing the
corridor was clear, let myself into my own flat. I departed from
my flat promptly at six o'clock, again as Paul Ducharme, carrying
this time a bundle done up in brown paper under my arm, and
proceeded directly to my room in Soho. Later I took a bus, still
carrying my brown paper parcel, and reached Liverpool Street in
ample time for the Continental train. By a little private
arrangement with the guard, I secured a compartment for myself,
although, up to the moment the train left the station, I could
not be sure but that I might be compelled to take the trip to the
Hook of Holland after all. If anyone had insisted on coming into
my compartment, I should have crossed the North Sea that night. I
knew I should be followed from Soho to the station, and that
probably the spy would go as far as Harwich, and see me on the
boat. It was doubtful if he would cross. I had chosen this route
for the reason that we have no organization in Holland: the
nearest circle is in Brussels, and if there had been time, the
Brussels circle would have been warned to keep an eye on me.
There was, however, no time for a letter, and anarchists never
use the telegraph, especially so far as the Continent is
concerned, unless in cases of the greatest emergency. If they
telegraphed my description to Brussels, the chances were it would
not be an anarchist who watched my landing, but a member of the
Belgian police force.</p>

<p>The 8.30 Continental express does not stop between Liverpool
Street and Parkeston Quay, which it is timed to reach three
minutes before ten. This gave me an hour and a half in which to
change my apparel. The garments of the poor old professor I
rolled up into a ball, one by one, and flung out through the open
window, far into the marsh past which we were flying in a
pitch-dark night. Coat, trousers, and waistcoat rested in
separate swamps at least ten miles apart. Gray whiskers and gray
wig I tore into little pieces, and dropped the bits out of the
open window.</p>

<p>I had taken the precaution to secure a compartment in the
front of the train, and when it came to rest at Parkeston Quay
Station, the crowd, eager for the steamer, rushed past me, and I
stepped out into the midst of it, a dapper, well-dressed young
man, with black beard and mustaches, my own closely cropped black
hair covered by a new bowler hat. Anyone looking for Paul
Ducharme would have paid small attention to me, and to any friend
of Valmont's I was equally unrecognizable.</p>

<p>I strolled in leisurely manner to the Great Eastern Hotel on
the Quay, and asked the clerk if a portmanteau addressed to Mr.
John Wilkins had arrived that day from London. He said "Yes,"
whereupon I secured a room for the night, as the last train had
already left for the metropolis.</p>

<p>Next morning, Mr. John Wilkins, accompanied by a brand-new and
rather expensive portmanteau, took the 9.57 train for Liverpool
Street, where he arrived at half past ten, stepped into a cab,
and drove to the Savoy Restaurant, lunching there with the
portmanteau deposited in the cloakroom. When John Wilkins had
finished an excellent lunch in a leisurely manner at the Café
Parisien of the Savoy, and had paid his bill, he did not go out
into the Strand over the rubber-paved court by which he had
entered, but went through the hotel and down the stairs, and so
out into the thoroughfare facing the Embankment. Then turning to
his right he reached the Embankment entrance of the Hotel Cecil.
This leads into a long dark corridor, at the end of which the
lift may be rung for. It does not come lower than the floor above
unless specially summoned. In this dark corridor, which was
empty, John Wilkins took off the black beard and mustache, hid it
in the inside pocket of his coat, and there went up into the lift
a few moments later to the office floor, I, Eugène Valmont,
myself for the first time in several days.</p>

<p>Even then I did not take a cab to my flat, but passed under
the arched Strand front of the Cecil in a cab, bound for the
residence of that nobleman who had formerly engaged me to see
after the safety of the king.</p>

<p>You will say that this was all very elaborate precaution to
take when a man was not even sure he was followed. To tell you
the truth, I do not know to this day whether anyone watched me or
not, nor do I care. I live in the present: when once the past is
done with, it ceases to exist for me. It is quite possible, nay,
entirely probable, that no one tracked me farther than Liverpool
Street Station the night before, yet it was for lack of such
precaution that my assistant Brisson received the Italian's
dagger under his shoulder blade fifteen years before. The present
moment is ever the critical time; the future is merely for
intelligent forethought. It was to prepare for the future that I
was now in a cab on the way to my lord's residence. It was not
the French anarchists I feared during the contest in which I was
about to become engaged, but the Paris police. I knew French
officialdom too well not to understand the futility of going to
the authorities there and proclaiming my object. If I ventured to
approach the Chief of Police with the information that I, in
London, had discovered what it was his business in Paris to know,
my reception would be far from cordial, even though, or rather
because, I announced myself as Eugène Valmont. The exploits of
Eugène had become part of the legends of Paris, and these legends
were extremely distasteful to those then in power. My doings have
frequently been made the subject of <i>feuilletons</i> in the
columns of the Paris press, and were, of course, exaggerated by
the imagination of the writers, yet, nevertheless, I admit I did
some good strokes of detection during my service with the French
Government. It is but natural, then, that the present authorities
should listen with some impatience when the name of Eugène
Valmont is mentioned. I recognize this as quite in the order of
things to be expected, and am honest enough to confess that in my
own time I often hearkened to narratives regarding the
performances of Lecocq with a doubting shrug of the
shoulders.</p>

<p>Now, if the French police knew anything of this anarchist
plot, which was quite within the bounds of possibility, and if I
were in surreptitious communication with the anarchists, more
especially with the man who was to fling the bomb, there was
every chance I might find myself in the grip of French justice. I
must, then, provide myself with credentials to show that I was
acting, not against the peace and quiet of my country, but on the
side of law and order. I therefore wished to get from the
nobleman a commission in writing, similar to that command which
he had placed upon me during the king's visit. This commission I
should lodge at my bank in Paris, to be a voucher for me at the
last extremity. I had no doubt his lordship would empower me to
act in this instance as I had acted on two former occasions.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI<br>

A REBUFF AND A RESPONSE</h2>

<p class="first">
PERHAPS if I had not lunched so well I might have approached
his lordship with greater deference than was the case; but when
ordering lunch I permitted a bottle of Château du Tertre, 1878, a
most delicious claret, to be decanted carefully for my
delectation at the table, and this caused a genial glow to
permeate throughout my system, inducing a mental optimism which
left me ready to salute the greatest of earth on a plane of
absolute equality. Besides, after all, I am a citizen of a
Republic.</p>

<p>The nobleman received me with frigid correctness, implying
disapproval of my unauthorized visit, rather than expressing it.
Our interview was extremely brief.</p>

<p>"I had the felicity of serving your lordship upon two
occasions," I began.</p>

<p>"They are well within my recollection," he interrupted, "but I
do not remember sending for you a third time."</p>

<p>"I have taken the liberty of coming unrequested, my lord,
because of the importance of the news I carry. I surmise that you
are interested in the promotion of friendship between France and
England."</p>

<p>"Your surmise, sir, is incorrect. I care not a button about
it. My only anxiety was for the safety of the king."</p>

<p>Even the superb claret was not enough to fortify me against
words so harsh and tones so discourteous as those his lordship
permitted himself to use.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, dropping the title in my rising anger, "it may
interest you to know that a number of your countrymen run the
risk of being blown to eternity by an anarchist bomb in less than
two weeks from to-day. A party of business men, true
representatives of a class to which the preeminence of your
empire is due, are about to proceed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pray spare me," interpolated his lordship wearily. "I have
read that sort of thing so often in the newspapers. If all these
estimable City men are blown up, the empire would doubtless miss
them, as you hint, but I should not, and their fate does not
interest me in the least, although you did me the credit of
believing that it would. Thompson, will you show this person out?
Sir, if I desire your presence here in future, I will send for
you."</p>

<p>"You may send for the devil!" I cried, now thoroughly enraged,
the wine getting the better of me.</p>

<p>"You express my meaning more tersely than I cared to do," he
replied coldly, and that was the last I ever saw of him.</p>

<p>Entering the cab I now drove to my flat, indignant at the
reception I had met with. However, I knew the English people
too well to malign them for the action of one of their number,
and resentment never dwells long with me. Arriving at my rooms
I looked through the newspapers to learn all I could of the
proposed business men's excursion to Paris, and, in reading the
names of those most prominent in carrying out the necessary
arrangements, I came across that of W. Raymond White, which
caused me to sit back in my chair and wrinkle my brow in an
endeavor to stir my memory. Unless I was much mistaken, I
had been so happy as to oblige this gentleman some dozen or
thirteen years before. As I remembered him, he was a business
man who engaged in large transactions with France, dealing
especially in Lyons and that district. His address was given in
the newspaper as Old 'Change, so at once I resolved to see him.
Although I could not recall the details of our previous meeting,
if, indeed, he should turn out to be the same person, yet the
mere sight of the name had produced a mental pleasure, as a
chance chord struck may bring a grateful harmony to the mind.
I determined to get my credentials from Mr. White if possible,
for his recommendation would in truth be much more valuable than
that of the gruff old nobleman to whom I had first applied,
because, if I got into trouble with the police of Paris, I
was well enough acquainted with the natural politeness of the
authorities to know that a letter from one of the city's guests
would secure my instant release.</p>

<p>I took a hansom to the head of that narrow thoroughfare known
as Old 'Change, and there dismissed my cab. I was so fortunate as
to recognize Mr. White coming out of his office. A moment later,
and I should have missed him.</p>

<p>"Mr. White," I accosted him, "I desire to enjoy both the
pleasure and the honor of introducing myself to you."</p>

<p>"Monsieur," replied Mr. White, with a smile, "the introduction
is not necessary, and the pleasure and honor are mine. Unless I
am very much mistaken, this is Monsieur Valmont of Paris?"</p>

<p>"Late of Paris," I corrected.</p>

<p>"Are you no longer in Government service then?"</p>

<p>"For a little more than ten years I have been a resident of
London."</p>

<p>"What, and have never let me know? That is something the
diplomatists call an unfriendly act, monsieur. Now, shall we
return to my office, or go to a café?"</p>

<p>"To your office, if you please, Mr. White. I come on rather
important business."</p>

<p>Entering his private office the merchant closed the door,
offered me a chair, and sat down himself by his desk. From the
first he had addressed me in French, which he spoke with an
accent so pure that it did my lonesome heart good to hear it.</p>

<p>"I called upon you half a dozen years ago," he went on, "when
I was over in Paris on a festive occasion, where I hoped to
secure your company, but I could not learn definitely whether you
were still with the Government or not."</p>

<p>"It is the way of French officialism," I replied. "If they
knew my whereabouts they would keep the knowledge to
themselves."</p>

<p>"Well, if you have been ten years in London, Monsieur Valmont,
we may now perhaps have the pleasure of claiming you as an
Englishman; so I beg you will accompany us on another festive
occasion to Paris next week. Perhaps you have seen that a number
of us are going over there to make the welkin ring."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have read all about the business men's excursion to
Paris, and it is with reference to this journey that I wish to
consult you," and here I gave Mr. White in detail the plot of the
anarchists against the growing cordiality of the two countries.
The merchant listened quietly, without interruption, until I had
finished; then he said:</p>

<p>"I suppose it will be rather useless to inform the police of
Paris?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. White, it is the police of Paris I fear more than
the anarchists. They would resent information coming to them from
the outside, especially from an ex-official, the inference being
that they were not up to their own duties. Friction and delay
would ensue until the deed was inevitable. It is quite on the
cards that the police of Paris may have some inkling of the plot,
and in that case, just before the event, they are reasonably
certain to arrest the wrong men. I shall be moving about Paris,
not as Eugène Valmont, but as Paul Ducharme, the anarchist;
therefore there is some danger that as a stranger and a suspect I
may be laid by the heels at the critical moment. If you would be
so good as to furnish me with credentials which I can deposit
somewhere in Paris in case of need, I may thus be able to
convince the authorities that they have taken the wrong man."</p>

<p>Mr. White, entirely unperturbed by the prospect of having a
bomb thrown at him within two weeks, calmly wrote several
documents, then turned his untroubled face to me, and said, in a
very confidential, winning tone:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Valmont, you have stated the case with that clear
comprehensiveness pertaining to a nation which understands the
meaning of words, and the correct adjustment of them; that
felicity of language which has given France the first place in
the literature of nations. Consequently, I think I see very
clearly the delicacies of the situation. We may expect
hindrances, rather than help, from officials on either side of
the Channel. Secrecy is essential to success. Have you spoken of
this to anyone but me?"</p>

<p>"Only to Lord Blank," I replied; "and now I deeply regret
having made a confidant of him."</p>

<p>"That does not in the least matter," said Mr. White, with a
smile; "Lord Blank's mind is entirely occupied by his own
greatness. Chemists tell me that you cannot add a new ingredient
to a saturated solution; therefore your revelation will have made
no impression upon his lordship's intellect. He has already
forgotten all about it. Am I right in supposing that everything
hinges on the man who is to throw the bomb?"</p>

<p>"Quite right, sir. He may be venal, he may be traitorous, he
may be a coward, he may be revengeful, he may be a drunkard.
Before I am in conversation with him for ten minutes, I shall
know what his weak spot is. It is upon that spot I must act, and
my action must be delayed till the very last moment; for, if he
disappears too long before the event, his first, second, or third
substitute will instantly step into his place."</p>

<p>"Precisely. So you cannot complete your plans until you have
met this man?"</p>

<p><i>"Parfaitement."</i></p>

<p>"Then I propose," continued Mr. White, "that we take no one
into our confidence. In a case like this there is little use in
going before a committee. I can see that you do not need any
advice, and my own part shall be to remain in the background,
content to support the most competent man that could have been
chosen to grapple with a very difficult crisis."</p>

<p>I bowed profoundly. There was a compliment in his glance as
well as in his words. Never before had I met so charming a
man.</p>

<p>"Here," he continued, handing me one of the papers he had
written, "is a letter to whom it may concern, appointing you my
agent for the next three weeks, and holding myself responsible
for all you see fit to do. Here," he went on, passing to me a
second sheet, "is a letter of introduction to Monsieur Largent,
the manager of my bank in Paris, a man well known and highly
respected in all circles, both official and commercial. I suggest
that you introduce yourself to him, and he will hold himself in
readiness to respond to any call you may make, night or day. I
assure you that his mere presence before the authorities will at
once remove any ordinary difficulty. And now," he added, taking
in hand the third slip of paper, speaking with some hesitation,
and choosing his words with care, "I come to a point which cannot
be ignored. Money is a magician's wand, which, like faith, will
remove mountains. It may also remove an anarchist hovering about
the route of a business man's procession."</p>

<p>He now handed to me what I saw was a draft on Paris for a
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>"I assure you, monsieur," I protested, covered with confusion,
"that no thought of money was in my mind when I took the liberty
of presenting myself to you. I have already received more than I
could have expected in the generous confidence you were good
enough to repose in me, as exhibited by these credentials, and
especially the letter to your banker. Thanks to the generosity of
your countrymen, Mr. White, of which you are a most notable
example, I am in no need of money."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Valmont, I am delighted to hear that you have got on
well among us. This money is for two purposes. First, you will
use what you need. I know Paris very well, monsieur, and have
never found gold an embarrassment there. The second purpose is
this: I suggest that when you present the letter of introduction
to Monsieur Largent, you will casually place this amount to your
account in his bank. He will thus see that, besides writing you a
letter of introduction, I transfer a certain amount of my own
balance to your credit. That will do you no harm with him, I
assure you. And now, Monsieur Valmont, it only remains for me to
thank you for the opportunity you have given me, and to assure
you that I shall march from the Gare du Nord without a tremor,
knowing the outcome is in such capable custody."</p>

<p>And then this estimable man shook hands with me in action the
most cordial. I walked away from Old 'Change as if I trod upon
air; a feeling vastly different from that with which I departed
from the residence of the old nobleman in the West End but a few
hours before.</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII<br>

IN THE GRIP OF THE GREEN DEMON</h2>

<p class="first">
NEXT morning I was in Paris, and next night I attended the
underground meeting of the anarchists, held within a quarter of a
mile of the Luxembourg. I was known to many there assembled, but
my acquaintance, of course, was not so large as with the London
circle. They had half expected me the night before, knowing that
even going by the Hook of Holland I might have readied Paris in
time for the conclave. I was introduced generally to the
assemblage as the emissary from England, who was to assist the
bomb-throwing brother to escape either to that country, or to
such other point of safety as I might choose. No questions were
asked me regarding my doings of the day before, nor was I
required to divulge the plans for my fellow-member's escape. I
was responsible; that was enough. If I failed, through no fault
of my own, it was but part of the ill luck we were all prepared
to face. If I failed through treachery, then a dagger in the back
at the earliest possible moment. We all knew the conditions of
our sinister contract, and we all recognized that the least said
the better.</p>

<p>The cellar was dimly lighted by one oil lamp depending from
the ceiling. From this hung a cord attached to an extinguisher,
and one jerk of the cord would put out the light. Then, while the
main entry doors were being battered down by police, the
occupants of the room would escape through one of three or four
human rat holes provided for that purpose.</p>

<p>If any Parisian anarchist does me the honor to read these
jottings, I beg to inform him that while I remained in office
under the Government of France there was never a time when I did
not know the exit of each of these underground passages, and
could, during any night there was a conference, have bagged the
whole lot of those there assembled. It was never my purpose,
however, to shake the anarchists' confidence in their system, for
that merely meant the removal of the gathering to another spot,
thus giving us the additional trouble of mapping out their new
exits and entrances. When I did make a raid on anarchist
headquarters in Paris, it was always to secure some particular
man. I had my emissaries in plain clothes stationed at each exit.
In any case, the rats were allowed to escape unmolested, sneaking
forth with great caution into the night, but we always spotted
the man we wanted and almost invariably arrested him elsewhere,
having followed him from his kennel. In each case my uniformed
officers found a dark and empty cellar, and retired apparently
baffled. But the coincidence that on the night of every raid some
member there present was secretly arrested in another quarter of
Paris, and perhaps given a free passage to Russia, never seemed
to awaken suspicion in the minds of the conspirators.</p>

<p>I think the London anarchists' method is much better, and I
have ever considered the English nihilist the most dangerous of
this fraternity, for he is cool-headed and not carried away by
his own enthusiasm, and consequently rarely carried away by his
own police. The authorities of London meet no opposition in
making a raid. They find a well-lighted room containing a more or
less shabby coterie playing cards at cheap pine tables. There is
no money visible, and, indeed, very little coin would be brought
to light if the whole party were searched; so the police are
unable to convict the players under the Gambling Act. Besides, it
is difficult in any case to obtain a conviction under the
Gambling Act, because the accused has the sympathy of the whole
country with him. It has always been to me one of the anomalies
of the English nature that a magistrate can keep a straight face
while he fines some poor wretch for gambling, knowing that next
race day (if the court is not sitting) the magistrate himself, in
correct sporting costume, with binoculars hanging at his hip,
will be on the lawn by the course, backing his favorite
horse.</p>

<p>After my reception at the anarchists' club of Paris, I
remained seated unobtrusively on a bench, waiting until routine
business was finished, after which I expected an introduction to
the man selected to throw the bomb. I am a very sensitive person,
and sitting there quietly I became aware that I was being
scrutinized with more than ordinary intensity by some one, which
gave me a feeling of uneasiness. At last, in the semiobscurity
opposite me, I saw a pair of eyes, as luminous as those of a
tiger, peering fixedly at me. I returned the stare with such
composure as I could bring to my aid, and the man, as if
fascinated by a look as steady as his own, leaned forward, and
came more and more into the circle of light.</p>

<br>

<a id="pic2"></a>
<div align="center">

<p class="caption">
I returned the stare with such composure as I could bring to my aid.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Then I received a shock which it required my utmost self-
control to conceal. The face, haggard and drawn, was none other
than that of Adolph Simard, who had been my second assistant in
the Secret Service of France during my last year in office. He
was a most capable and rising young man at that time, and, of
course, he knew me well.</p>

<p>Had he, then, penetrated my disguise? Such an event seemed
impossible; he could not have recognized my voice, for I had said
nothing aloud since entering the room, my few words to the
president being spoken in a whisper. Simard's presence there
bewildered me; by this time he should be high up in the Secret
Service. If he were now a spy, he would, of course, wish to
familiarize himself with every particular of my appearance, as in
my hands lay the escape of the criminal. Yet, if such were his
mission, why did he attract the attention of all members by this
open-eyed scrutiny? That he recognized me as Valmont I had not
the least fear; my disguise was too perfect; and, even if I were
there in my own proper person, I had not seen Simard, nor he me,
for ten years, and great changes occur in a man's appearance
during so long a period. Yet I remembered with disquietude that
Mr. White recognized me, and here to-night I had recognized
Simard. I could not move my bench farther back because it stood
already against the wall. Simard, on the contrary, was seated on
one of the few chairs in the room, and this he periodically
hitched forward, the better to continue his examination, which
now attracted the notice of others besides myself. As he came
forward, I could not help admiring the completeness of his
disguise so far as apparel was concerned. He was a perfect
picture of the Paris wastrel, and, what was more, he wore on his
head a cap of the Apaches, the most dangerous band of cutthroats
that have ever cursed a civilized city. I could understand that
even among lawless anarchists this badge of membership of the
Apache band might well strike terror. I felt that before the
meeting adjourned I must speak with him, and I determined to
begin our conversation by asking him why he stared so fixedly at
me. Yet even then I should have made little progress. I did not
dare to hint that he be? longed to the Secret Service;
nevertheless, if the authorities had this plot in charge, it was
absolutely necessary we should work together, or, at least, that
I should know they were in the secret, and steer my course
accordingly. The fact that Simard appeared with undisguised face
was not so important as might appear to an outsider. It is always
safer for a spy to preserve his natural appearance if that is
possible, because a false beard or false mustache or wig runs the
risk of being deranged or torn away. As I have said, an anarchist
assemblage is simply a room filled with the atmosphere of
suspicion. I have known instances where an innocent stranger was
suddenly set upon in the midst of solemn proceedings by two or
three impetuous fellow-members, who nearly jerked his own
whiskers from his face under the impression that they were false.
If Simard, therefore, appeared in his own scraggy beard and
unkempt hair, it meant that he communicated with headquarters by
some circuitous route. I realized, therefore, that a very touchy
bit of diplomacy awaited me if I was to learn from himself his
actual status. While I pondered over this perplexity, it was
suddenly dissolved by the action of the president, and another
substituted for it.</p>

<p>"Will Brother Simard come forward?" asked the president.</p>

<p>My former subordinate removed his eyes from me, slowly rose
from his chair, and shuffled up to the president's table.</p>

<p>"Brother Ducharme," said that official to me in a quiet tone,
"I introduce you to Brother Simard, whom you are commissioned to
see into a place of safety when he has dispersed the
procession."</p>

<p>Simard turned his fishy goggle-eyes upon me, and a grin
disclosed wolf-like teeth. He held out his hand, which, rising to
my feet, I took. He gave me a flabby grasp, and all the time his
inquiring eyes traveled over me.</p>

<p>"You don't look up to much," he said. "What are you?"</p>

<p>"I am a teacher of the French language in London."</p>

<p>"Umph!" growled Simard, evidently in no wise prepossessed by
my appearance. "I thought you weren't much of a fighter. The
<i>gendarmes</i> will make short work of this fellow," he growled
to the chairman.</p>

<p>"Brother Ducharme is vouched for by the whole English circle,"
replied the president firmly.</p>

<p>"Oh, the English! I think very little of them. Still, it
doesn't matter," and with a shrug of the shoulders he shuffled to
his seat again, leaving me standing there in a very embarrassed
state of mind, my brain in a whirl. That the man was present with
his own face was bewildering enough, but that he should be here
under his own name was simply astounding. I scarcely heard what
the president said. It seemed to the effect that Simard would
take me to his own room, where we might talk over our plans. And
now Simard rose again from his chair, and said to the president
that if nothing more were wanted of him we would go. Accordingly
we left the place of meeting together. I watched my comrade
narrowly. There was now a trembling eagerness in his action, and
without a word he hurried me to the nearest <i>café</i>, where we
sat down before a little iron table on the pavement.</p>

<p><i>"Garçon,"</i> he shouted harshly, "bring me four absinths.
What will you drink, Ducharme?"</p>

<p>"A <i>café-cognac</i>, if you please."</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried Simard; "better have absinth."</p>

<p>Then he cursed the waiter for his slowness. When the absinth
came he grasped the half-full glass and swallowed the liquid raw,
a thing I had never seen done before. Into the next measure of
the wormwood he poured the water impetuously from the
<i>carafe</i>, another thing I had never seen done before, and
dropped two lumps of sugar into it. Over the third glass he
placed a flat perforated plated spoon, piled the sugar on this
bridge, and now quite expertly allowed the water to drip through,
the proper way of concocting this seductive mixture. Finishing
his second glass, he placed the perforated spoon over the fourth,
and began now more calmly sipping the third, while the water
dripped slowly into the last glass.</p>

<p>Here before my eyes was enacted a more wonderful change than
the gradual transformation of transparent absinth into an opaque
opalescent liquid. Simard, under the influence of the drink, was
slowly becoming the Simard I had known ten years before.
Remarkable! Absinth, having in earlier years made a beast of the
man, was now forming a man out of the beast. His staring eyes
took on an expression of human comradeship. The whole mystery
became perfectly clear to me without a question asked or an
answer uttered. This man was no spy, but a genuine anarchist.
However it happened, he had become a victim of absinth, one of
many with whom I was acquainted, although I never met any so far
sunk as he. He was into his fourth glass, and had ordered two
more, when he began to speak.</p>

<p>"Here's to us!" he cried, with something like a civilized
smile on his gaunt face. "You're not offended at what I said in
the meeting, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," I answered.</p>

<p>"That's right. You see, I once belonged to the Secret Service,
and if my chief was there to-day, we would soon find ourselves in
a cool dungeon. We couldn't trip up Eugène Valmont."</p>

<p>At these words, spoken with sincerity, I sat up in my chair,
and I am sure such an expression of enjoyment came into my face
that, if I had not instantly suppressed it, I might have betrayed
myself.</p>

<p>"Who was Eugène Valmont?" I asked, in a tone of assumed
indifference.</p>

<p>Mixing his fifth glass he nodded sagely.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't ask that question if you'd been in Paris a dozen
years ago. He was the Government's chief detective, and he knew
more of anarchists, yes, and of Apaches, too, than either you or
I do. He had more brains in his little finger than that whole lot
babbling there to-night. But the Government, being a fool, as all
governments are, dismissed him, and because I was his assistant,
they dismissed me as well. They got rid of all his staff. Valmont
disappeared. If I could have found him, I wouldn't be sitting
here with you to-night;  but he was right to disappear. The
Government did all they could against us who had been his
friends, and I for one came through starvation, and was near
throwing myself in the Seine, which sometimes I wish I had done.
Here, <i>garçon</i>, another absinth! But by and by I came to
like the gutter, and here I am. I'd rather have the gutter and
absinth than the Luxembourg without it. I've had my revenge on
the Government many times since, for I knew their ways, and often
have I circumvented the police. That's why they respect me among
the anarchists. Do you know how I joined? I knew all their
passwords, and walked right into one of their meetings, alone and
in rags.</p>

<p>"'Here am I,' I said; 'Adolph Simard, late second assistant to
Eugène Valmont, chief detective to the French Government.'</p>

<p>"There were twenty weapons covering me at once, but I
laughed.</p>

<p>"'I'm starving,' I cried, 'and I want something to eat, and
more especially something to drink! In return for that I'll show
you every rat-hole you've got. Lift the president's chair, and
there's a trapdoor that leads to the Rue Blanc. I'm one of you,
and I'll tell you the tricks of the police.'</p>

<p>"Such was my initiation, and from that moment the police began
to pick their spies out of the Seine, and now they leave us
alone. Even Valmont himself could do nothing against the
anarchists since I have joined them."</p>

<p>Oh, the incredible self-conceit of human nature! Here was this
ruffian proclaiming the limitations of Valmont, who half an hour
before had shaken his hand within the innermost circle of his
order! Yet my heart warmed toward the wretch who had remembered
me and my exploits.</p>

<p>It now became my anxious and difficult task to lure Simard
away from this <i>café</i> and its absinth. Glass after glass of
the poison had brought him up almost to his former intellectual
level, but now it was shoving him rapidly down the hill again. I
must know where his room was situated, yet if I waited much
longer the man would be in a state of drunken imbecility which
would not only render it impossible for him to guide me to his
room, but likely cause both of us to be arrested by the police. I
tried persuasion, and he laughed at me; I tried threats, whereat
he scowled and cursed me as a renegade from England. At last the
liquor overpowered him, and his head sank on the metal table and
the dark blue cap fell to the floor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br>

THE FATE OF THE PICRIC BOMB</h2>

<p class="first">
I WAS in despair, but now received a lesson which taught me
that if a man leaves a city, even for a short time, he falls out
of touch with its ways. I called the waiter, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Do you know my friend here?"</p>

<p>"I do not know his name," replied the <i>garçon</i>,
"but I have seen him many times at this <i>café</i>. He
is usually in this state when he has money."</p>

<p>"Do you know where he lives? He promised to take me with him,
and I am a stranger in Paris."</p>

<p>"Have no discontent, monsieur. Rest tranquil;  I will
intervene."</p>

<p>With this he stepped across the pavement in front of the
<i>café</i>, into the street, and gave utterance to a low,
peculiar whistle. The <i>café</i> was now nearly deserted, for
the hour was very late, or, rather, very early. When the waiter
returned I whispered to him in some anxiety: "Not the police,
surely?"</p>

<p>"But no!" he cried in scorn; "certainly not the police."</p>

<p>He went on unconcernedly taking in the empty chairs and
tables. A few minutes later there swaggered up to the <i>café</i>
two of the most disreputable, low-browed scoundrels I had ever
seen, each wearing a dark blue cap, with a glazed peak over the
eyes, caps exactly similar to the one which lay in front of
Simard. The band of Apaches which now permeates all Paris has
risen since my time, and Simard had been mistaken an hour before
in asserting that Valmont was familiar with their haunts. The
present Chief of Police in Paris and some of his predecessors
confess there is a difficulty in dealing with these picked
assassins, but I should very much like to take a hand in the game
on the side of law and order. However, that is not to be;
therefore the Apaches increase and prosper.</p>

<p>The two vagabonds roughly smote Simard's cap on his prone
head, and as roughly raised him to his feet.</p>

<p>"He is a friend of mine," I interposed, "and promised to take
me home with him."</p>

<p>"Good! Follow us," said one of them; and now I passed through
the morning streets of Paris behind three cutthroats, yet knew
that I was safer than if broad daylight was in the thoroughfare,
with a meridian sun shining down upon us. I was doubly safe,
being in no fear of harm from midnight prowlers, and equally free
from danger of arrest by the police. Every officer we met avoided
us, and casually stepped to the other side of the street. We
turned down a narrow lane, then through a still narrower one,
which terminated at a courtyard. Entering a tall building, we
climbed up five flights of stairs to a landing, where one of the
scouts kicked open a door, into a room so miserable that there
was not even a lock to protect its poverty. Here they allowed the
insensible Simard to drop with a crash on the floor, and thus
they left us alone without even an adieu. The Apaches take care
of their own&mdash;after a fashion.</p>

<p>I struck a match, and found part of a <i>bougie</i> stuck in
the mouth of an absinth bottle, resting on a rough deal table.
Lighting the <i>bougie</i>, I surveyed the horrible apartment. A
heap of rags lay in a corner, and this was evidently Simard's
bed. I hauled him to it, and there he lay unconscious, himself a
bundle of rags. I found one chair, or, rather, stool, for it had
no back. I drew the table against the lockless door, blew out the
light, sat on the stool, resting my arms on the table, and my
head on my arms, and slept peacefully till long after
daybreak.</p>

<p>Simard awoke in the worst possible humor. He poured forth a
great variety of abusive epithets at me. To make himself still
more agreeable, he turned back the rags on which he had slept,
and brought to the light a round black object, like a small
cannon ball, which he informed me was the picric bomb that was to
scatter destruction among my English friends, for whom he
expressed the greatest possible loathing and contempt. Then
sitting up, he began playing with this infernal machine, knowing,
as well as I, that if he allowed it to drop that was the end of
us two.</p>

<br>

<p class="caption">
Then sitting up, he began playing with this infernal machine.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders at this display, and affected a
nonchalance I was far from feeling, but finally put an end to his
dangerous amusement by telling him that if he came out with me I
would pay for his breakfast, and give him a drink of absinth.</p>

<p>The next few days were the most anxious of my life. Never
before had I lived on terms of intimacy with a picric bomb, that
most deadly and uncertain of all explosive agencies. I speedily
found that Simard was so absinth-soaked I could do nothing with
him. He could not be bribed or cajoled or persuaded or
threatened. Once, indeed, when he talked with drunken affection
of Eugène Valmont, I conceived a wild notion of declaring myself
to him; but a moment's reflection showed the absolute uselessness
of this course. It was not one Simard with whom I had to deal,
but half a dozen or more. There was Simard sober, half sober,
quarter sober, drunk, half drunk, quarter drunk, or wholly drunk.
Any bargain I might make with the one Simard would not be kept by
any of the other six. The only safe Simard was Simard insensible
through overindulgence. I had resolved to get Simard insensibly
drunk on the morning of the procession, but my plans were upset
at a meeting of the anarchists, which luckily took place on an
evening shortly after my arrival, and this gave me time to mature
the plan which was actually carried out. Each member of the
anarchists' club knew of Simard's slavery to absinth, and fears
were expressed that he might prove incapable on the day of the
procession, too late for a substitute to take his place. It was
therefore proposed that one or two others should be stationed
along the route of the procession with bombs ready if Simard
failed. This I strenuously opposed, and guaranteed that Simard
would be ready to launch his missile. I met with little
difficulty in persuading the company to agree, because, after
all, every man among them feared he might be one of those
selected, which choice was practically a sentence of death. I
guaranteed that the bomb would be thrown, and this apparently was
taken to mean that if Simard did not do the deed, I would.</p>

<p>This danger over, I next took the measurements, and estimated
the weight, of the picric bomb. I then sought out a most amiable
and expert pyrotechnist, a capable workman of genius, who with
his own hand makes those dramatic firework arrangements which you
sometimes see in Paris. As Eugène Valmont, I had rendered a great
service to this man, and he was not likely to have forgotten it.
During one of the anarchist scares a stupid policeman had
arrested him, and when I intervened the man was just on the verge
of being committed for life. France trembled in one of her
panics, or, rather, Paris did, and demanded victims. This
blameless little workman had indeed contributed with both
material and advice, but any fool might have seen that he had
done this innocently. His assistance had been invoked and secured
under the pretense that his clients were promoting an amateur
firework display, which was true enough, but the display cost the
lives of three men, and intentionally so. I cheered up the
citizen in the moment of his utmost despair, and brought such
proof of his innocence to the knowledge of those above me that he
was most reluctantly acquitted. To this man I now went with my
measurement of the bomb, and the estimate of its weight.</p>

<p>"Sir," said I, "do you remember Eugène Valmont?"</p>

<p>"Am I ever likely to forget him?" he replied, with a fervor
that pleased me.</p>

<p>"He has sent me to you, and implores you to aid me, and that
aid will wipe out the debt you owe him."</p>

<p>"Willingly, willingly," cried the artisan, "so long; as it has
nothing to do with the anarchists or the making of bombs!"</p>

<p>"It has to do exactly with those two things. I wish you to
make an innocent bomb which will prevent an anarchist
outrage."</p>

<p>At this the little man drew back, and his face became
pale.</p>

<p>"It is impossible," he protested; "I have had enough of
innocent bombs. No, no, and in any case how can I be sure you
come from Eugène Valmont? No, monsieur, I am not to be trapped
the second time."</p>

<p>At this I related rapidly all that Valmont had done for him,
and even repeated Valmont's most intimate conversation with him.
The man was nonplused, but remained firm.</p>

<p>"I dare not do it," he said.</p>

<p>We were alone in his back shop. I walked to the door and
thrust in the bolt; then, after a moment's pause, turned round,
stretched forth my right hand dramatically, and cried:</p>

<p>"Behold Eugène Valmont!"</p>

<p>My friend staggered against the wall in his amazement, and I
continued in solemn tones:</p>

<p>"Eugène Valmont, who by this removal of his disguise places
his life in your hands as your life was in his. Now, monsieur,
what will you do?" He replied:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Valmont, I shall do whatever you ask. If I refused a
moment ago, it was because I thought there was now in France no
Eugène Valmont to rectify my mistake if I make one."</p>

<p>I resumed my disguise, and told him I wished an innocent
substitute for this picric bomb, and he at once suggested an
earthenware globe, which would weigh the same as the bomb, and
which could be colored to resemble it exactly.</p>

<p>"And now, Monsieur Valmont, do you wish smoke to issue from
this imitation bomb?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "in such quantity as you can compress within
it."</p>

<p>"It is easily done!" he cried, with the enthusiasm of a true
French artist. "And may I place within some little design of my
own which will astonish your friends the English, and delight my
friends the French?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said I, "I am in your hands. I trust the project
entirely to your skill." And thus it came about that four days
later I substituted the bogus globe for the real one, and,
unseen, dropped the picric bomb from one of the bridges into the
Seine.</p>

<p>On the morning of the procession I was compelled to allow
Simard several drinks of absinth to bring him up to a point
where he could be depended on, otherwise his anxiety and
determination to fling the bomb, his frenzy against all
government, made it certain that he would betray both of us
before the fateful moment came. My only fear was that I could not
stop him drinking when once he began, but somehow our days of
close companionship, loathsome as they were to me, seemed to have
had the effect of building up again the influence I held over him
in former days, and his yielding more or less to my wishes
appeared to be quite unconscious on his part.</p>

<p>The procession was composed entirely of carriages, each
containing four persons&mdash;two Englishmen sat on the back
seats, with two Frenchmen in front of them. A thick crowd lined
each side of the thoroughfare, cheering vociferously. Right into
the middle of the procession Simard launched his bomb. There was
no crash of explosion. The missile simply went to pieces as if it
were an earthenware jar, and there arose a dense column of very
white smoke. In the immediate vicinity the cheering stopped at
once, and the sinister word "bomb" passed from lip to lip in
awed whispers. As the throwing had been unnoticed in the midst of
the commotion, I held Simard firmly by the wrist, determined he
should not draw attention to himself by his panic-stricken desire
for immediate flight.</p>

<p>"Stand still, you fool!" I hissed into his ear, and he obeyed,
trembling.</p>

<p>The pair of horses in front of which the bomb fell rose for a
moment on their hind legs, and showed signs of bolting, but the
coachman held them firmly, and uplifted his hand so that the
procession behind him came to a momentary pause. No one in the
carriages moved a muscle, then suddenly the tension was broken by
a great and simultaneous cheer. Wondering at this, I turned my
eyes from the frightened horses to the column of pale smoke in
front of us, and saw that in some manner it had resolved itself
into a gigantic calla lily, pure white, while from the base of
this sprang the lilies of France, delicately tinted. Of course,
this could not have happened if there had been the least wind,
but the air was so still that the vibration of the cheering
caused the huge lily to tremble gently as it stood there
marvelously poised; the lily of peace, surrounded by the lilies
of France! That was the design, and if you ask me how it was
done, I can only refer you to my pyrotechnist, and say that
whatever a Frenchman attempts to do he will accomplish
artistically.</p>

<p>And now these imperturbable English, who had been seated,
immobile, when they thought a bomb was thrown, stood up in their
carriages to get a better view of this aerial phenomenon,
cheering and waving their hats. The lily gradually thinned, and
dissolved in little patches of cloud that floated away above our
heads.</p>

<p>"I cannot stay here longer," groaned Simard, quaking, his
nerves, like himself, in rags. "I see the ghosts of those I have
killed floating around me."</p>

<p>"Come on, then, but do not hurry."</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in getting him to London, but it was
absinth, absinth, all the way, and when we reached Charing Cross
I was compelled to help him, partly insensible, into a cab. I
took him direct to the Imperial Flats, and up into my own set of
chambers, where I opened my strong room, and flung him inside
to sleep off his intoxication, and subsist on bread and water
when he became sober.</p>

<p>I attended that night a meeting of the anarchists, and
detailed accurately the story of our escape from France. I knew
we had been watched, and so skipped no detail. I reported that I
had taken Simard directly to my compatriot's flat; to Eugène
Valmont, the man who had given me employment, and who had
promised to do what he could for Simard, beginning by trying to
break him of the absinth habit, as he was now a physical wreck
through overindulgence in that stimulant.</p>

<p>It was curious to note the discussion which took place a few
nights afterwards regarding the failure of the picric bomb.
Scientists among us said that the bomb had been made too long;
that a chemical reaction had taken place which destroyed its
power. A few superstitious ones saw a miracle in what had
happened, and they forthwith left our organization. Then again,
things were made easier by the fact that the man who constructed
the bomb, evidently terror-stricken at what he had done,
disappeared the day before the procession, and has never since
been heard of. The majority of the anarchists believed he had
made a bogus bomb, and had fled to escape their vengeance rather
than to evade the justice of the law.</p>

<p>Simard will need no purgatory in the next world. I kept him on
bread and water for a month in my strong room, and at first he
demanded absinth with threats, then groveled, begging and praying
for it. After that a period of depression and despair ensued, but
finally his naturally strong constitution conquered, and began to
build itself up again. I took him from his prison one midnight,
and gave him a bed in my Soho room, taking care in bringing him
away that he would never recognize the place where he had been
incarcerated. In my dealings with him I had always been that old
man, Paul Ducharme. Next morning I said to him:</p>

<p>"You spoke of Eugène Valmont. I have learned that he lives in
London, and I advise you to call upon him. Perhaps he can get you
something to do."</p>

<p>Simard was overjoyed, and two hours later, as Eugène Valmont,
I received him in my flat, and made him my assistant on the spot.
From that time forward, Paul Ducharme, language teacher,
disappeared from the earth, and Simard abandoned his two
A's&mdash;anarchy and absinth.</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX<br>

THE DINNER FOR SEVEN IN THE TEMPLE</h2>

<p class="first">
WHEN the card was brought in to me, I looked upon it with some
misgiving, for I scented a commercial transaction, and, although
such cases are lucrative enough, nevertheless I, Eugène Valmont,
formerly high in the service of the French Government, do not
care to be connected with them. They usually pertain to sordid
business affairs, presenting little that is of interest to a man
who, in his time, has dealt with subtle questions of diplomacy
upon which the welfare of nations sometimes turned.</p>

<p>The name of Bentham Gibbes is familiar to everyone, connected
as it is with the much-advertised pickles, whose glaring
announcements in crude crimson and green strike the eye
throughout Great Britain, and shock the artistic sense wherever
seen. Me! I have never tasted them, and shall not so long as a
French restaurant remains open in London. But I doubt not they
are as pronounced to the palate as their advertisement is
distressing to the eye. If, then, this gross pickle manufacturer
expected me to track down those who were infringing upon the
recipes for making his so-called sauces, chutneys, and the like,
he would find himself mistaken, for I was now in a position to
pick and choose my cases, and a case of pickles did not allure
me. "Beware of imitations," said the advertisement; "none genuine
without a facsimile of the signature of Bentham Gibbes." Ah,
well, not for me were either the pickles or the tracking of
imitators. A forged check! yes, if you like, but the forged
signature of Mr. Gibbes on a pickle bottle was out of my line.
Nevertheless, I said to Armand:</p>

<p>"Show the gentleman in," and he did so.</p>

<p>To my astonishment there entered a young man, quite correctly
dressed in the dark frock coat, faultless waistcoat and trousers
that proclaimed a Bond Street tailor. When he spoke his voice and
language were those of a gentleman.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Valmont?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"At your service," I replied, bowing and waving my hand as
Armand placed a chair for him, and withdrew.</p>

<p>"I am a barrister with chambers in the Temple," began Mr.
Gibbes, "and for some days a matter has been troubling me about
which I have now come to seek your advice, your name having been
suggested by a friend in whom I confided."</p>

<p>"Am I acquainted with him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I think not," replied Mr. Gibbes; "he also is a barrister
with chambers in the same building as my own. Lionel Dacre is his
name."</p>

<p>"I never heard of him."</p>

<p>"Very likely not. Nevertheless, he recommended you as a man
who could keep his own counsel, and if you take up this case I
desire the utmost secrecy preserved, whatever may be the
outcome."</p>

<p>I bowed, but made no protestation. Secrecy is a matter of
course with me.</p>

<p>The Englishman paused for a few moments as if he expected
fervent assurances; then went on with no trace of disappointment
on his countenance at not receiving them.</p>

<p>"On the night of the twenty-third, I gave a little dinner to
six friends of mine in my own rooms. I may say that so far as I
am aware they are all gentlemen of unimpeachable character. On
the night of the dinner I was detained later than I expected at a
reception, and in driving to the Temple was still further delayed
by a block of traffic in Piccadilly, so that when I arrived at my
chambers there was barely time for me to dress and receive my
guests. My man Johnson had everything laid out ready for me in my
dressing room, and as I passed through to it I hurriedly flung
off the coat I was wearing and carelessly left it hanging over
the back of a chair in the dining room, where neither Johnson nor
myself noticed it until my attention was called to it after the
dinner was over, and everyone rather jolly with wine.</p>

<p>"This coat contains an inside pocket. Usually any frock coat I
wear at an afternoon reception has not an inside pocket, but I
had been rather on the rush all day. My father is a manufacturer
whose name may be familiar to you, and I am on the directors'
board of his company. On this occasion I took a cab from the city
to the reception I spoke of, and had no time to go and change at
my rooms. The reception was a somewhat bohemian affair, extremely
interesting, of course, but not too particular as to costume, so
I went as I was. In this inside pocket rested a thin package,
composed of two pieces of cardboard, and between them rested five
twenty-pound Bank of England notes, folded lengthwise, held in
place by an elastic rubber band. I had thrown the coat across the
chair back in such a way that the inside pocket was exposed,
leaving the ends of the notes plainly recognizable.</p>

<p>"Over the coffee and cigars one of my guests laughingly called
attention to what he termed my vulgar display of wealth, and
Johnson, in some confusion at having neglected to put away the
coat, now picked it up, and took it to the reception room where
the wraps of my guests lay about promiscuously. He should, of
course, have hung it up in my wardrobe, but he said afterwards he
thought it belonged to the guest who had spoken. You see, Johnson
was in my dressing room when I threw my coat on the chair in the
corner while making my way thither, and I suppose he had not
noticed the coat in the hurry of arriving guests, otherwise he
would have put it where it belonged. After everybody had gone
Johnson came to me and said the coat was there, but the package
was missing, nor has any trace of it been found since that
night."</p>

<p>"The dinner was fetched in from outside, I suppose?" </p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How many waiters served it?"</p>

<p>"Two. They are men who have often been in my employ on similar
occasions, but, apart from that, they had left my chambers before
the incident of the coat happened."</p>

<p>"Neither of them went into the reception room, I take it?"</p>

<p>"No. I am certain that not even suspicion can attach to either
of the waiters."</p>

<p>"Your man Johnson?"</p>

<p>"Has been with me for years. He could easily have stolen much
more than the hundred pounds if he had wished to do so, but I
have never known him to take a penny that did not belong to
him."</p>

<p>"Will you favor me with the names of your guests, Mr.
Gibbes?"</p>

<p>"Viscount Stern sat at my right hand, and at my left Lord
Templemere; Sir John Sanclere next to him, and Angus McKeller
next to Sanclere. After Viscount Stern was Lionel Dacre, and at
his right, Vincent Innis."</p>

<p>On a sheet of paper I had written the names of the guests, and
noted their places at the table.</p>

<p>"Which guest drew your attention to the money?"</p>

<p>"Lionel Dacre."</p>

<p>"Is there a window looking out from the reception room?"</p>

<p>"Two of them."</p>

<p>"Were they fastened on the night of the dinner party?"</p>

<p>"I could not be sure; very likely Johnson would know. You are
hinting at the possibility of a thief coming in through a
reception-room window while we were somewhat noisy over our wine.
I think such a solution highly improbable. My rooms are on the
third floor, and a thief would scarcely venture to make an
entrance when he could not but know there was company being
entertained. Besides this, the coat was there less than an hour,
and it appears to me that whoever stole those notes knew where
they were."</p>

<p>"That seems reasonable," I had to admit. "Have you spoken to
anyone of your loss?"</p>

<p>"To no one but Dacre, who recommended me to see you. Oh, yes,
and to Johnson, of course."</p>

<p>I could not help noting that this was the fourth or fifth time
Dacre's name had come up during our conversation.</p>

<p>"What of Dacre?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you see, he occupies chambers in the same building
on the ground floor. He is a very good fellow, and we are by way
of being firm friends. Then it was he who had called attention to
the money, so I thought he should know the sequel."</p>

<p>"How did he take your news?"</p>

<p>"Now that you call attention to the fact, he seemed slightly
troubled. I should like to say, however, that you must not be
misled by that. Lionel Dacre could no more steal than he could
lie."</p>

<p>"Did he show any surprise when you mentioned the theft?"</p>

<p>Bentham Gibbes paused a moment before replying, knitting his
brows in thought.</p>

<p>"No," he said at last; "and, come to think of it, it appeared
as if he had been expecting my announcement."</p>

<p>"Doesn't that strike you as rather strange, Mr. Gibbes?"</p>

<p>"Really, my mind is in such a whirl, I don't know what to
think. But it's perfectly absurd to suspect Dacre. If you knew
the man you would understand what I mean. He comes of an
excellent family, and he is&mdash;oh! he is Lionel Dacre, and
when you have said that you have made any suspicion absurd."</p>

<p>"I suppose you caused the rooms to be thoroughly searched. The
packet didn't drop out and remain unnoticed in some corner?"</p>

<p>"No;  Johnson and myself examined every inch of the
premises."</p>

<p>"Have you the numbers of the notes?"</p>

<p>"Yes;  I got them from the bank next morning. Payment was
stopped, and so far not one of the five has been presented. Of
course, one or more may have been cashed at some shop, but none
have been offered to any of the banks."</p>

<p>"A twenty-pound note is not accepted without scrutiny, so the
chances are the thief may find some difficulty in disposing of
them."</p>

<p>"As I told you, I don't mind the loss of the money at all. It
is the uncertainty, the uneasiness caused by the incident which
troubles me. You will comprehend how little I care about the
notes when I say that if you are good enough to interest yourself
in this case, I shall be disappointed if your fee does not exceed
the amount I have lost."</p>

<p>Mr. Gibbes rose as he said this, and I accompanied him to the
door assuring him that I should do my best to solve the mystery.
Whether he sprang from pickles or not, I realized he was a
polished and generous gentleman, who estimated the services of a
professional expert like myself at their true value.</p>

<p>I shall not set down the details of my researches during the
following few days, because the trend of them must be gone over
in the account of that remarkable interview in which I took part
somewhat later. Suffice it to say that an examination of the
rooms and a close cross-questioning of Johnson satisfied me he
and the two waiters were innocent. I became certain no thief had
made his way through the window, and finally I arrived at the
conclusion that the notes were stolen by one of the guests.
Further investigation convinced me that the thief was no other
than Lionel Dacre, the only one of the six in pressing need of
money at this time. I caused Dacre to be shadowed, and during one
of his absences made the acquaintance of his man Hopper, a surly,
impolite brute, who accepted my golden sovereign quickly enough,
but gave me little in exchange for it. While I conversed with
him, there arrived in the passage where we were talking together
a huge case of champagne, bearing one of the best known names in
the trade, and branded as being of the vintage of '78. Now I knew
that the product of Camelot Frères is not bought as cheaply as
British beer, and I also had learned that two short weeks before
Mr. Lionel Dacre was at his wits' end for money. Yet he was still
the same briefless barrister he had ever been.</p>

<p>On the morning after my unsatisfactory conversation with his
man Hopper, I was astonished to receive the following note,
written on a dainty correspondence card:</p>

<br>

<p class="card" style="font-size:1.1em">
<span class="smcap">3 and 4, Vellum Buildings,<br>
Inner Temple, E.C.</span></p>

<p class="letter">Mr. Lionel Dacre presents his compliments to
Monsieur Eugène Valmont, and would be obliged if Monsieur Valmont
could make it convenient to call upon him in his chambers to-
morrow morning at eleven.</p>
<br>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X<br>

THE CLEW OF THE SILVER SPOONS</h2>

<p class="first">
HAD the young man become aware that he was being shadowed, or
had the surly servant informed him of the inquiries made? I was
soon to know. I called punctually at eleven next morning, and was
received with charming urbanity by Mr. Dacre himself. The
taciturn Hopper had evidently been sent away for the
occasion.</p>

<p>"My dear Monsieur Valmont, I am delighted to meet you," began
the young man with more of effusiveness than I had ever noticed
in an Englishman before, although his very next words supplied an
explanation that did not occur to me until afterwards as somewhat
farfetched. "I believe we are by way of being countrymen, and,
therefore, although the hour is early, I hope you will allow me
to offer you some of this bottled sunshine of the year '78 from
<i>la belle France</i>, to whose prosperity and honor we shall
drink together. For such a toast any hour is propitious," and to
my amazement he brought forth from the case I had seen arrive two
days before a bottle of that superb Camelot Frères '78.</p>

<p>"Now," said I to myself, "it is going to be difficult to keep
a clear head if the aroma of this nectar rises to in the brain.
But tempting as is the cup, I shall drink sparingly, and hope he
may not be so judicious."</p>

<p>Sensitive, I already experienced the charm of his personality,
and well understood the friendship Mr. Bentham Gibbes felt for
him. But I saw the trap spread before me. He expected, under the
influence of champagne and courtesy, to extract a promise from me
which I must find myself unable to give.</p>

<p>"Sir, you interest me by claiming kinship with France. I had
understood that you belonged to one of the oldest families of
England."</p>

<p>"Ah, England!" he cried, with an expressive gesture of
outspreading hands truly Parisian in its significance. "The trunk
belongs to England, of course, but the root&mdash;ah! the
root&mdash;Monsieur Valmont, penetrated the soil from which this
wine of the gods has been drawn."</p>

<p>Then filling my glass and his own he cried:</p>

<p>"To France, which my family left in the year 1066!"</p>

<p>I could not help laughing at his fervent ejaculation.</p>

<p>"1066! With William the Conqueror! That is a long time ago,
Mr. Dacre."</p>

<p>"In years perhaps; in feelings but a day. My forefathers came
over to steal, and, Lord! how well they accomplished it. They
stole the whole country&mdash;something like a theft, say
I&mdash;under that prince of robbers whom you have well named the
Conqueror. In our secret hearts we all admire a great thief, and
if not a great one, then an expert one, who covers his tracks so
perfectly that the hounds of justice are baffled in attempting to
follow them. Now even you, Monsieur Valmont (I can see you are
the most generous of men, with a lively sympathy found to
perfection only in France), even you must suffer a pang of regret
when you lay a thief by the heels who has done his task
deftly."</p>

<p>"I fear, Mr. Dacre, you credit me with a magnanimity to which
I dare not lay claim. The criminal is a danger to society."</p>

<p>"True, true, you are in the right, Monsieur Valmont. Still,
admit there are cases that would touch you tenderly. For example,
a man ordinarily honest; a great need; a sudden opportunity. He
takes that of which another has abundance, and he, nothing. What
then, Monsieur Valmont? Is the man to be sent to perdition for a
momentary weakness?"</p>

<p>His words astonished me. Was I on the verge of hearing a
confession? It almost amounted to that already.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dacre," I said, "I cannot enter into the subtleties you
pursue. My duty is to find the criminal."</p>

<p>"Again I say you are in the right, Monsieur Valmont, and I am
enchanted to find so sensible a head on French shoulders.
Although you are a more recent arrival, if I may say so, than
myself, you nevertheless already give utterance to sentiments
which do honor to England. It is your duty to hunt down the
criminal. Very well. In that I think I can aid you, and thus have
taken the liberty of requesting your attendance here this
morning. Let me fill your glass again, Monsieur Valmont."</p>

<p>"No more, I beg of you, Mr. Dacre."</p>

<p>"What, do you think the receiver is as bad as the thief?"</p>

<p>I was so taken aback by this remark that I suppose my face
showed the amazement within me. But the young man merely laughed
with apparently free-hearted enjoyment, poured more wine into his
own glass, and tossed it off. Not knowing what to say, I changed
the current of conversation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gibbes said you had been kind enough to recommend me to
his attention. May I ask how you came to hear of me?"</p>

<p>"Ah! who has not heard of the renowned Monsieur Valmont," and
as he said this, for the first time there began to grow a
suspicion in my mind that he was chaffing me, as it is called in
England&mdash;a procedure which I cannot endure. Indeed, if this
gentleman practiced such a barbarism in my own country he would
find himself with a duel on his hands before he had gone far.
However, the next instant his voice resumed its original
fascination, and I listened to it as to some delicious
melody.</p>

<p>"I need only mention my cousin, Lady Gladys Dacre, and you
will at once understand why I recommended you to my friend. The
case of Lady Gladys, you will remember, required a delicate touch
which is not always to be had in this land of England, except
when those who possess the gift do us the honor to sojourn with
us."</p>

<p>I noticed that my glass was again filled, and bowing an
acknowledgment of his compliment, I indulged in another sip of
the delicious wine. I sighed, for I began to realize it was going
to be very difficult for me, in spite of my disclaimer, to tell
this man's friend he had stolen the money. All this time he had
been sitting on the edge of the table, while I occupied a chair
at its end. He sat there in careless fashion, swinging a foot to
and fro. Now he sprang to the floor, and drew up a chair, placing
on the table a blank sheet of paper. Then he took from the
mantelshelf a packet of letters, and I was astonished to see they
were held together by two bits of cardboard and a rubber band
similar to the combination that had contained the folded bank
notes. With great nonchalance he slipped off the rubber band,
threw it and the pieces of cardboard on the table before me,
leaving the documents loose to his hand.</p>

<p>"Now, Monsieur Valmont," he cried jauntily, "you have been
occupied for several days on this case, the case of my dear
friend Bentham Gibbes, who is one of the best fellows in the
world."</p>

<p>"He said the same of you, Mr. Dacre."</p>

<p>"I am gratified to hear it. Would you mind letting me know to
what point your researches have led you?"</p>

<p>"They have led me in a direction rather than to a point."</p>

<p>"Ah! In the direction of a man, of course?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Will you pardon me if I decline to answer this question at
the present moment?"</p>

<p>"That means you are not sure."</p>

<p>"It may mean, Mr. Dacre, that I am employed by Mr. Gibbes, and
do not feel at liberty to disclose the results of my quest
without his permission."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Bentham Gibbes and I are entirely at one in this
matter. Perhaps you are aware that I am the only person with whom
he has discussed the case besides yourself."</p>

<p>"That is undoubtedly true, Mr. Dacre; still, you see the
difficulty of my position."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, and so shall press you no farther. But I also have
been studying the problem in a purely amateurish way, of course.
You will perhaps express no disinclination to learn whether or
not my deductions agree with yours."</p>

<p>"None in the least. I should be very glad to know the
conclusion at which you have arrived. May I ask if you suspect
anyone in particular?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Will you name him?"</p>

<p>"No; I shall copy the admirable reticence you yourself have
shown. And now let us attack this mystery in a sane and
businesslike manner. You have already examined the room. Well,
here is a rough sketch of it There is the table; in this corner
stood the chair on which the coat was flung. Here sat Gibbes at
the head of the table. Those on the left-hand side had their
backs to the chair. I, being on the center to the right, saw the
chair, the coat, and the notes and called attention to them. Now
our first duty is to find a motive. If it were a murder our
motive might be hatred, revenge, robbery&mdash;what you like. As
it is simply the stealing of money, the man must have been either
a born thief or else some hitherto innocent person pressed to the
crime by great necessity. Do you agree with me, Monsieur
Valmont?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. You follow exactly the line of my own
reasoning."</p>

<p>"Very well. It is unlikely that a born thief was one of Mr.
Gibbes's guests. Therefore we are reduced to look for a man under
the spur of necessity; a man who has no money of his own, but who
must raise a certain amount, let us say, by a certain date. If we
can find such a man in that company, do you not agree with me
that he is likely to be the thief?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"Then let us start our process of elimination. Out goes
Viscount Stern, a lucky individual with twenty thousand acres of
land, and God only knows what income. I mark off the name of Lord
Templemere, one of his Majesty's judges, entirely above
suspicion. Next, Sir John Sanclere; he also is rich, but Vincent
Innis is still richer, so the pencil obliterates both names. Now
we arrive at Angus McKeller, an author of some note, as you are
well aware, deriving a good income from his books and a better
one from his plays; a canny Scot, so we may rub his name from our
paper and our memory. How do my erasures correspond with yours,
Monsieur Valmont?"</p>

<p>"They correspond exactly, Mr. Dacre."</p>

<p>"I am flattered to hear it. There remains one name untouched,
Mr. Lionel Dacre, the descendant, as I have said, of
robbers."</p>

<p>"I have not said so, Mr. Dacre."</p>

<p>"Ah! my dear Valmont, the politeness of your country asserts
itself. Let us not be deluded, but follow our inquiry wherever it
leads. I suspect Lionel Dacre. What do you know of his
circumstances before the dinner of the twenty-third?"</p>

<p>As I made no reply he looked up at me with his frank, boyish
face illumined by a winning smile.</p>

<p>"You know nothing of his circumstances?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It grieves me to state that I do. Mr. Lionel Dacre was
penniless on the night of the dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't exaggerate, Monsieur Valmont," cried Dacre, with a
gesture of pathetic protest; "his pocket held one sixpence, two
pennies, and a half-penny. How came you to suspect he was
penniless?"</p>

<p>"I knew he ordered a case of champagne from the London
representative of Camelot Frères, and was refused unless he paid
the money down."</p>

<p>"Quite right, and then when you were talking to Hopper you saw
that case of champagne delivered. Excellent! excellent! Monsieur
Valmont. But will a man steal, think you, even to supply himself
with so delicious a wine as this we have been tasting?&mdash;and,
by the way, forgive my neglect. Allow me to fill your glass,
Monsieur Valmont."</p>

<p>"Not another drop, if you will excuse me, Mr. Dacre."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, champagne should not be mixed with evidence. When we
have finished, perhaps. What further proof have you discovered,
monsieur?"</p>

<p>"I hold proof that Mr. Dacre was threatened with bankruptcy
if, on the twenty-fourth, he did not pay a bill of seventy-eight
pounds that had been long outstanding. I hold proof that this was
paid, not on the twenty-fourth, but on the twenty-sixth. Mr.
Dacre had gone to the solicitor and assured him he would pay the
money on that date, whereupon he was given two days' grace."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, he was entitled to three, you know, in law. Yes,
there, Monsieur Valmont, you touch the fatal point. The threat of
bankruptcy will drive a man in Dacre's position to almost any
crime. Bankruptcy to a barrister means ruin. It means a career
blighted; it means a life buried, with little chance of
resurrection. I see, you grasp the supreme importance of that bit
of evidence. The case of champagne is as nothing compared with
it, and this reminds me that in the crisis now upon us I shall
take another sip, with your permission. Sure you won't join
me?"</p>

<p>"Not at this juncture, Mr. Dacre."</p>

<p>"I envy your moderation. Here's to the success of our search,
Monsieur Valmont."</p>

<p>I felt sorry for the gay young fellow as with smiling face he
drank the champagne.</p>

<p>"Now, monsieur," he went on, "I am amazed to learn how much
you have discovered. Really, I think tradespeople, solicitors,
and all such should keep better guard on their tongues than they
do. Nevertheless, these documents at my elbow, which I expected
would surprise you, are merely the letters and receipts. Here is
the communication from the solicitor threatening me with
bankruptcy; here is his receipt dated the twenty-sixth;  here is
the refusal of the 'wine merchant, and here is his receipt for
the money. Here are smaller bills liquidated. With my pencil we
will add them up. Seventy-eight pounds&mdash;the principal
debt&mdash;bulks large. We add the smaller items and it reaches a
total of ninety-three pounds seven shillings and fourpence. Let
us, now examine my purse. Here is a five-pound note; there is a
golden sovereign. I now count out and place on the table twelve
and sixpence in silver and twopence in coppers. The purse thus
becomes empty. Let us add the silver and copper to the amount on
the paper. Do my eyes deceive me, or is the sum exactly a hundred
pounds? There is your money fully accounted for."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Dacre," I said, "but I observe a sovereign
resting on the mantelpiece."</p>

<p>Dacre threw back his head and laughed with greater heartiness
than I had yet known him to indulge in during our short
acquaintance.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he cried; "you've got me there. I'd forgotten
entirely about that pound on the mantelpiece, which belongs to
you."</p>

<p>"To me? Impossible!"</p>

<p>"It does, and cannot interfere in the least with our century
calculation. That is the sovereign you gave to my' man Hopper,
who, knowing me to be hard pressed, took it and shamefacedly
presented it to me, that I might enjoy the spending of it. Hopper
belongs to our family, or the family belongs to him. I am never
sure which. You must have missed in him the deferential bearing
of a manservant in Paris, yet he is true gold, like the sovereign
you bestowed upon him, and he bestowed upon me. Now here,
monsieur, is the evidence of the theft, together with the rubber
band and two pieces of cardboard. Ask my friend Gibbes to examine
them minutely. They are all at your disposition, monsieur, and
thus you learn how much easier it is to deal with the master than
with the servant. All the gold you possess would not have wrung
these incriminating documents from old Hopper. I was compelled to
send him away to the West End an hour ago, fearing that in his
brutal British way he might assault you if he got an inkling of
your mission."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dacre," said I slowly, "you have thoroughly convinced
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I thought I would," he interrupted with a laugh.</p>

<p>"&mdash;that you did <i>not</i> take the money."</p>

<p>"Oho, this is a change of wind, surely. Many a man has been
hanged on a chain of circumstantial evidence much weaker than
this which I have exhibited to you. Don't you see the subtlety of
my action? Ninety-nine persons in a hundred would say: 'No man
could be such a fool as to put Valmont on his own track, and then
place in Valmont's hands such striking evidence.' But there comes
in my craftiness. Of course, the rock you run up against will be
Gibbes's incredulity. The first question he will ask you may be
this: 'Why did not Dacre come and borrow the money from me?' Now
there you find a certain weakness in your chain of evidence. I
knew perfectly well that Gibbes would lend me the money, and he
knew perfectly well that if I were pressed to the wall I should
ask him."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dacre," said I, "you have been playing with me. I should
resent that with most men, but whether it is your own genial
manner or the effect of this excellent champagne, or both
together, I forgive you. But I am convinced of another thing. You
know who took the money."</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I suspect."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me whom you suspect?"</p>

<p>"That would not be fair, but I shall now take the liberty of
filling your glass with champagne."</p>

<p>"I am your guest, Mr. Dacre."</p>

<p>"Admirably answered, monsieur," he replied, pouring out the
wine, "and now I offer you a clew. Find out all about the story
of the silver spoons."</p>

<p>"The story of the silver spoons! What silver spoons?"</p>

<p>"Ah! That is the point. Step out of the Temple into Fleet
Street, seize the first man you meet by the shoulder, and ask him
to tell you about the silver spoons. There are but two men and
two spoons concerned. When you learn who those two men are, you
will know that one of them did not take the money, and I give you
my assurance that the other did."</p>

<p>"You speak in mystery, Mr. Dacre."</p>

<p>"But certainly, for I am speaking to Monsieur Eugène
Valmont."</p>

<p>"I echo your words, sir. Admirably answered. You put me on my
mettle, and I flatter myself that I see your kindly drift. You
wish me to solve the mystery of this stolen money. Sir, you do me
honor, and I drink to your health."</p>

<p>"To yours, monsieur," said Lionel Dacre, and thus we drank and
parted.</p>

<p>On leaving Mr. Dacre I took a hansom to a <i>café</i> in
Regent Street, which is a passable imitation of similar places of
refreshment in Paris. There, calling for a cup of black coffee, I
sat down to think. The clew of the silver spoons! He had
laughingly suggested that I should take by the shoulders the
first man I met, and ask him what the story of the silver spoons
was. This course naturally struck me as absurd, and he doubtless
intended it to seem absurd. Nevertheless, it contained a hint. I
must ask somebody, and that the right person, to tell me the tale
of the silver spoons.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the black coffee I reasoned it out in
this way. On the night of the twenty-third one of the six guests
there present stole a hundred pounds, but Dacre had said that an
actor in the silver-spoon episode was the actual thief. That
person, then, must have been one of Mr. Gibbes's guests at the
dinner of the twenty-third. Probably two of the guests were the
participators in the silver-spoon comedy, but, be that as it may,
it followed that one, at least, of the men around Mr. Gibbes's
table knew the episode of the silver spoons.</p>

<p>Perhaps Bentham Gibbes himself was cognizant of it. It
followed, therefore, that the easiest plan was to question each
of the men who partook of that dinner. Yet if only one knew about
the spoons, that one must also have some idea that these spoons
formed the clew which attached him to the crime of the
twenty-third, in which case he was little likely to divulge what
he knew to an entire stranger.</p>

<p>Of course, I might go to Dacre himself and demand the story of
the silver spoons, but this would be a confession of failure on
my part, and I rather dreaded Lionel Dacre's hearty laughter when
I admitted that the mystery was too much for me. Besides this I
was very well aware of the young man's kindly intentions toward
me. He wished me to unravel the coil myself, and so I determined
not to go to him except as a last resource.</p>

<p>I resolved to begin with Mr. Gibbes, and, finishing my coffee,
I got again into a hansom, and drove back to the Temple. I found
Bentham Gibbes in his room, and after greeting me, his first
inquiry was about the case.</p>

<p>"How are you getting on?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think I'm getting on fairly well," I replied, "and expect
to finish in a day or two, if you will kindly tell me the story
of the silver spoons."</p>

<p>"The silver spoons?" he echoed, quite evidently not
understanding me.</p>

<p>"There happened an incident in which two men were engaged, and
this incident related to a pair of silver spoons. I want to get
the particulars of that."</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest idea of what you are talking about,"
replied Gibbes, thoroughly bewildered. "You will need to be more
definite, I fear, if you are to get any help from me."</p>

<p>"I cannot be more definite, because I have already told you
all I know."</p>

<p>"What bearing has all this on our own case?"</p>

<p>"I was informed that if I got hold of the clew of the silver
spoons I should be in a fair way of settling our case."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Lionel Dacre."</p>

<p>"Oh, does Dacre refer to his own conjuring?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. What was his conjuring?"</p>

<p>"A very clever trick he did one night at dinner here about two
months ago."</p>

<p>"Had it anything to do with silver spoons?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was silver spoons or silver forks, or something of
that kind. I had entirely forgotten the incident. So far as I
recollect at the moment there was a sleight-of-hand man of great
expertness in one of the music halls, and the talk turned upon
him. Then Dacre said the tricks he did were easy, and holding up
a spoon or a fork, I don't remember which, he professed his
ability to make it disappear before our eyes, to be found
afterwards in the clothing of some one there present. Several
offered to bet that he could do nothing of the kind, but he said
he would bet with no one but Innis, who sat opposite him. Innis,
with some reluctance, accepted the bet, and then Dacre, with a
great show of the usual conjurer's gesticulations, spread forth
his empty hands, and said we should find the spoon in Innis's
pocket, and there, sure enough, it was. It seemed a proper
sleight-of-hand trick, but we were never able to get him to
repeat it."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, Mr. Gibbes; I think I see daylight
now."</p>

<p>"If you do you are cleverer than I by a long chalk," cried
Bentham Gibbes as I took my departure.</p>

<p>I went directly downstairs, and knocked at Mr. Dacre's door
once more. He opened the door himself, his man not yet having
returned.</p>

<p>"Ah, monsieur," he cried, "back already? You don't mean to
tell me you have so soon got to the bottom of the silver-spoon
entanglement?"</p>

<p>"I think I have, Mr. Dacre. You were sitting at dinner
opposite Mr. Vincent Innis. You saw him conceal a silver spoon in
his pocket. You probably waited for some time to understand what
he meant by this, and as he did not return the spoon to its
place, you proposed a conjuring trick, made the bet with him, and
thus the spoon was returned to the table."</p>

<p>"Excellent! excellent, monsieur! that is very nearly what
occurred, except that I acted at once. I had had experiences with
Mr. Vincent Innis before. Never did he enter these rooms of mine
without my missing some little trinket after he was gone.
Although Mr. Innis is a very rich person, I am not a man of many
possessions, so if anything is taken, I meet little difficulty in
coming to a knowledge of my loss. Of course, I never mentioned
these abstractions to him. They were all trivial, as I have said,
and so far as the silver spoon was concerned, it was of no great
value either. But I thought the bet and the recovery of the spoon
would teach him a lesson; it apparently has not done so. On the
night of the twenty-third he sat at my right hand, as you will
see by consulting your diagram of the table and the guests. I
asked him a question twice, to which he did not reply, and
looking at him I was startled by the expression in his eyes. They
were fixed on a distant corner of the room, and following his
gaze I saw what he was staring at with such hypnotizing
concentration. So absorbed was he in contemplation of the packet
there so plainly exposed, now my attention was turned to it, that
he seemed to be entirely oblivious of what was going on around
him. I roused him from his trance by jocularly calling Gibbes's
attention to the display of money. I expected in this way to save
Innis from committing the act which he seemingly did commit.
Imagine then the dilemma in which I was placed when Gibbes
confided to me the morning after what had occurred the night
before. I was positive Innis had taken the money, yet I possessed
no proof of it. I could not tell Gibbes, and I dared not speak to
Innis. Of course, monsieur, you do not need to be told that Innis
is not a thief in the ordinary sense of the word. He had no need
to steal, and yet apparently cannot help doing so. I am sure that
no attempt has been made to pass those notes. They are doubtless
resting securely in his house at Kensington. He is, in fact, a
kleptomaniac, or a maniac of some sort. And now, monsieur, was my
hint regarding the silver spoons of any value to you?"</p>

<p>"Of the most infinite value, Mr. Dacre."</p>

<p>"Then let me make another suggestion. I leave it entirely to
your bravery; a bravery which, I confess, I do not myself
possess. Will you take a hansom, drive to Mr. Innis's house on
the Cromwell Road, confront him quietly, and ask for the return
of the packet? I am anxious to know what will happen. If he hands
it to you, as I expect he will, then you must tell Mr. Gibbes the
whole story."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dacre, your suggestion shall be immediately acted upon,
and I thank you for your compliment to my courage."</p>

<p>I found that Mr. Innis inhabited a very grand house. After a
time he entered the study on the ground floor, to which I had
been conducted. He held my card in his hand, and was looking at
it with some surprise.</p>

<p>"I think I have not the pleasure of knowing you, Monsieur
Valmont," he said courteously enough.</p>

<p>"No. I ventured to call on a matter of business. I was once
investigator for the French Government, and now am doing private
detective work here in London."</p>

<p>"Ah! And how is that supposed to interest me? There is nothing
that I wish investigated. I did not send for you, did I?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Innis, I merely took the liberty of calling to ask
you to let me have the package you took from Mr. Bentham Gibbes's
frock-coat pocket on the night of the twenty-third."</p>

<p>"He wishes it returned, does he?"<p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. Innis calmly walked to a desk, which he unlocked and
opened, displaying a veritable museum of trinkets of one sort and
another. Pulling out a small drawer he took from it the packet
containing the five twenty-pound notes. Apparently it had never
been opened. With a smile he handed it to me.</p>

<p>"You will make my apologies to Mr. Gibbes for not returning it
before. Tell him I have been unusually busy of late."</p>

<p>"I shall not fail to do so," said I, with a bow.</p>

<p>"Thanks so much. Good morning, Monsieur Valmont."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Innis."</p>

<p>And so I returned the packet to Mr. Bentham Gibbes, who pulled
the notes from between their pasteboard protection, and begged me
to accept them.</p>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI<br>

"MY PROPHETIC SOUL, MY UNCLE!"</h2>

<p class="first">
THE name of the late Lord Chizelrigg never comes to my mind
without instantly suggesting that of Mr. T. A. Edison. I never
saw the late Lord Chizelrigg, and I have met Mr. Edison only
twice in my life, yet the two men are linked in my memory, and it
was a remark the latter once made that in great measure enabled
me to solve the mystery which the former had wrapped round his
actions.</p>

<p>There is no memorandum at hand to tell me the year in which
those two meetings with Edison took place. I received a note from
the Italian Ambassador in Paris requesting me to wait upon him at
the Embassy. I learned that on the next day a deputation was to
set out from the Embassy to one of the chief hotels, there to
make a call in state upon the great American inventor, and
formally present to him various insignia accompanying certain
honors which the King of Italy had conferred upon him. As many
Italian nobles of high rank had been invited, and as these
dignitaries would not only be robed in the costumes pertaining to
their orders, but in many cases would wear jewels of almost
inestimable value, my presence was desired in the belief that I
might perhaps be able to ward off any attempt on the part of the
deft-handed gentry who might possibly make an effort to gain
these treasures, and I may add, with perhaps some little
self-gratification, no <i>contretemps</i> occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. Edison, of course, had long before received notification
of the hour at which the deputation would wait upon him, but when
we entered the large parlor assigned to the inventor, it was
evident to me at a glance that the celebrated man had forgotten
all about the function. He stood by a bare table, from which the
cloth had been jerked and flung into a corner, and upon that
table were placed several bits of black and greasy
machinery&mdash;cogwheels, pulleys, bolts, etc. These seemingly
belonged to a French workman who stood on the other side of the
table, with one of the parts in his grimy hand. Edison's own
hands were not too clean, for he had palpably been examining the
material, and conversing with the workman, who wore the ordinary
long blouse of an iron craftsman in a small way. I judged him to
be a man with a little shop of his own in some back street, who
did odd jobs of engineering, assisted, perhaps, by a skilled
helper or two, and a few apprentices. Edison looked sternly
toward the door as the solemn procession filed in, and there was
a trace of annoyance on his face at the interruption, mixed with
a shade of perplexity as to what this gorgeous display all meant.
The Italian is as ceremonious as the Spaniard where a function is
concerned, and the official who held the ornate box which
contained the jewelry resting on a velvet cushion stepped slowly
forward, and came to a stand in front of the bewildered American.
Then the Ambassador, in sonorous voice, spoke some gracious words
regarding the friendship existing between the United States and
Italy, expressed a wish that their rivalry should ever take the
form of benefits conferred upon the human race, and instanced the
honored recipient as the most notable example the world had yet
produced of a man bestowing blessings upon all nations in the
arts of peace. The eloquent Ambassador concluded by saying that,
at the command of his royal master, it was both his duty and his
pleasure to present, and so forth and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. Edison, visibly ill at ease, nevertheless made a suitable
reply in the fewest possible words, and the <i>étalage</i>being
thus at an end, the noblemen, headed by their Ambassador, slowly
retired, myself forming the tail of the procession. Inwardly I
deeply sympathized with the French workman who thus unexpectedly
found himself confronted by so much magnificence. He cast one
wild look about him, but saw that his retreat was cut off, unless
he displaced some of these gorgeous grandees. He tried then to
shrink into himself, and finally stood helpless, like one
paralyzed. In spite of republican institutions, there is deep
down in every Frenchman's heart a respect and awe for official
pageants, sumptuously staged and costumed as this one was. But he
likes to view it from afar, and supported by his fellows, not
thrust incongruously into the midst of things, as was the case
with this panic-stricken engineer. As I passed out, I cast a
glance over my shoulder at the humble artisan content with a
profit of a few francs a day, and at the millionaire inventor
opposite him. Edison's face, which during the address had been
cold and impassive, reminding me vividly of a bust of Napoleon,
was now all aglow with enthusiasm as he turned to his humble
visitor. He cried joyfully to the workman:</p>

<p>"A minute's demonstration is worth an hour's explanation. I'll
call round to-morrow at your shop, about ten o'clock, and show
you how to make the thing work."</p>

<p>I lingered in the hall until the Frenchman came out, then,
introducing myself to him, asked the privilege of visiting his
shop next day at ten. This was accorded with that courtesy which
you will always find among the industrial classes of France, and
next day I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Edison. During our
conversation I complimented him on his invention of the
incandescent electric light, and this was the reply that has ever
remained in my memory:</p>

<p>"It was not an invention, but a discovery. We knew what we
wanted: a carbonized tissue, which would withstand the electric
current in a vacuum for, say, a thousand hours. If no such tissue
existed, then the incandescent light, as we know it, was not
possible. My assistants started out to find this tissue, and we
simply carbonized everything we could lay our hands on, and ran
the current through it in a vacuum. At last we struck the right
thing, as we were bound to do if we kept on long enough, and if
the thing existed. Patience and hard work will overcome any
obstacle."</p>

<p>This belief has been of great assistance to me in my
profession. I know the idea is prevalent that a detective arrives
at his solutions in a dramatic way through following clews
invisible to the ordinary man. This doubtless frequently happens,
but, as a general thing, the patience and hard work which Mr.
Edison commends is a much safer guide. Very often the following
of excellent clews has led me to disaster, as was the case with
my unfortunate attempt to solve the mystery of the five hundred
diamonds.</p>

<p>As I was saying, I never think of the late Lord Chizelrigg
without remembering Mr. Edison at the same time, and yet the two
were very dissimilar. I suppose Lord Chizelrigg was the most
useless man that ever lived, while Edison is the opposite.</p>

<p>One day my servant brought in to me a card on which was
engraved "Lord Chizelrigg."</p>

<p>"Show his lordship in," I said, and there appeared a young man
of perhaps twenty-four or twenty-five, well dressed, and of most
charming manners, who, nevertheless, began his interview by
asking a question such as had never before been addressed to me,
and which, if put to a solicitor or other professional man, would
have been answered with some indignation. Indeed, I believe it is
a written or unwritten law of the legal profession that the
acceptance of such a proposal as Lord Chizelrigg made to me
would, if proved, result in the disgrace and ruin of the
lawyer.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Valmont," began Lord Chizelrigg, "do you ever take
up cases on speculation?"</p>

<p>"On speculation, sir? I do not think I understand you."</p>

<p>His lordship blushed like a girl, and stammered slightly as he
attempted an explanation.</p>

<p>"What I mean is, do you accept a case on a contingent fee?
That is to say, monsieur&mdash;Dr&mdash;well, not to put too fine
a point upon it, no results, no pay."</p>

<p>I replied somewhat severely:</p>

<p>"Such an offer has never been made to me, and I may say at
once that I should be compelled to decline it were I favored with
the opportunity. In the cases submitted to me, I devote my time
and attention to their solution. I try to deserve success, but I
cannot command it, and as in the interim I must live, I am
reluctantly compelled to make a charge for my time, at least. I
believe the doctor sends in his bill, though the patient
dies."</p>

<p>The young man laughed uneasily, and seemed almost too
embarrassed to proceed, but finally he said:</p>

<p>"Your illustration strikes home with greater accuracy than
probably you imagined when you uttered it. I have just paid my
last penny to the physician who attended my late uncle, Lord
Chizelrigg, who died six months ago. I am fully aware that the
suggestion I made may seem like a reflection upon your skill, or,
rather, as implying a doubt regarding it. But I should be
grieved, monsieur, if you fell into such an error. I could have
come here and commissioned you to undertake some elucidation of
the strange situation in which I find myself, and I make no doubt
you would have accepted the task if your numerous engagements had
permitted. Then, if you failed, I should have been unable to pay
you, for I am practically bankrupt. My whole desire, therefore,
was to make an honest beginning, and to let you know exactly how
I stand. If you succeed, I shall be a rich man; if you do not
succeed, I shall be what I am now, penniless. Have I made it
plain now why I began with a question which you had every right
to resent?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly plain, my lord, and your candor does you
credit."</p>

<p>I was very much taken with the unassuming manners of the young
man, and his evident desire to accept no service under false
pretenses. When I had finished my sentence the pauper nobleman
rose to his feet and bowed.</p>

<p>"I am very much your debtor, monsieur, for your courtesy in
receiving me, and can only beg pardon for occupying your time on
a futile quest. I wish you good morning, monsieur."</p>

<p>"One moment, my lord," I rejoined, waving him to his chair
again. "Although I am unprepared to accept a commission on the
terms you suggest, I may, nevertheless, be able to offer a hint
or two that will prove of service to you. I think I remember the
announcement of Lord Chizelrigg's death. He was somewhat
eccentric, was he not?"</p>

<p>"Eccentric?" said the young man, with a slight laugh, seating
himself again. "Well, <i>rather</i>."</p>

<p>"I vaguely remember that he was accredited with the possession
of something like twenty thousand acres of land?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven thousand, as a matter of fact," replied my
visitor.</p>

<p>"Have you fallen heir to the lands as well as to the
title?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; the estate was entailed. The old gentleman could not
divert it from me if he would, and I rather suspect that fact
must have been the cause of some worry to him."</p>

<p>"But surely, my lord, a man who owns, as one might say, a
principality in this wealthy realm of England, cannot be
penniless?"</p>

<p>Again the young man laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, no," he replied, thrusting his hand in his pocket and
bringing to light a few brown coppers and a white silver piece.
"I possess enough money to buy some food to-night, but not enough
to dine at the Hotel Cecil. You see, it is like this. I belong to
a somewhat ancient family, various members of whom went the pace,
and mortgaged their acres up to the hilt. I could not raise a
further penny on my estates were I to try my hardest, because at
the time the money was lent, land was much more valuable than it
is to-day. Agricultural depression, and all that sort of thing,
have, if I may put it so, left me a good many thousands worse off
than if I had no land at all. Besides this, during my late
uncle's life, Parliament, on his behalf, intervened once or
twice, allowing him in the first place to cut valuable timber,
and in the second place to sell the pictures of Chizelrigg Chase
at Christie's for figures which make one's mouth water."</p>

<p>"And what became of the money?" I asked; whereupon once more
this genial nobleman laughed.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I came up in the lift to learn if
Monsieur Valmont could discover."</p>

<p>"My lord, you interest me," I said, quite truly, with an
uneasy apprehension that I should take up his case after all, for
I liked the young man already. His lack of pretense appealed to
me, and that sympathy which is so universal among my countrymen
enveloped him, as I may say, quite independent of my own
will.</p>

<p>"My uncle," went on Lord Chizelrigg, "was somewhat of an
anomaly in our family. He must have been a reversal to a very,
very ancient type; a type of which we have no record. He was as
miserly as his forefathers were prodigal. When he came into the
title and estate some twenty years ago, he dismissed the whole
retinue of servants, and, indeed, was defendant in several cases
at law where retainers of our family brought suit against him for
wrongful dismissal, or dismissal without a penny compensation in
lieu of notice. I am pleased to say he lost all his cases, and
when he pleaded poverty, got permission to sell a certain number
of heirlooms, enabling him to make compensation, and giving him
something on which to live. These heirlooms at auction sold so
unexpectedly well, that my uncle acquired a taste, as it were, of
what might be done. He could always prove that the rents went to
the mortgagees, and that he had nothing on which to exist, so on
several occasions he obtained permission from the courts to cut
timber and sell pictures, until he denuded the estate and made an
empty barn of the old manor house. He lived like any laborer,
occupying himself sometimes as a carpenter, sometimes as a
blacksmith; indeed, he made a blacksmith's shop of the library,
one of the most noble rooms in Britain, containing thousands of
valuable books which again and again he applied for permission to
sell, but this privilege was never granted to him. I find, on
coming into the property, that my uncle quite persistently evaded
the law, and depleted this superb collection, book by book,
surreptitiously, through dealers in London. This, of course,
would have got him into deep trouble if it had been discovered
before his death, but now the valuable volumes are gone, and
there is no redress. Many of them are doubtless in America or in
museums and collections of Europe."</p>

<p>"You wish me to trace them, perhaps?" I interpolated.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; they are past praying for. The old man made tens of
thousands by the sale of the timber, and other tens of thousands
by disposing of the pictures. The house is denuded of its fine
old furniture, which was immensely valuable, and then the books,
as I have said, must have brought in the revenue of a prince, if
he got anything like their value, and you may be sure he was
shrewd enough to know their worth. Since the last refusal of the
courts to allow him further relief, as he termed it, which was
some seven years ago, he had quite evidently been disposing of
books and furniture by a private sale, in defiance of the law. At
that time I was under age, but my guardians opposed his
application to the courts, and demanded an account of the moneys
already in his hands. The judges upheld the opposition of my
guardians, and refused to allow a further spoliation of the
estate, but they did not grant the accounting my guardians asked,
because the proceeds of the former sales were entirely at the
disposal of my uncle, and were sanctioned by the law to permit
him to live as befitted his station. If he lived meagerly instead
of lavishly, as my guardians contended, that, the judges said,
was his affair, and there the matter ended.</p>

<p>"My uncle took a violent dislike to me on account of this
opposition to his last application, although, of course, I had
nothing whatever to do with the matter. He lived like a hermit,
mostly in the library, and was waited upon by an old man and his
wife, and these three were the only inhabitants of a mansion that
could comfortably house a hundred. He visited nobody, and would
allow no one to approach Chizelrigg Chase. In order that all who
had the misfortune to have dealings with him should continue to
endure trouble after his death, he left what might be called a
will, but which rather may be termed a letter to me. Here is a
copy of it:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My dear Tom</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">You will find your fortune between a couple of sheets of paper in the library.</p>

<p class="letter">Your affectionate uncle,</p>

<p class="letter">
<span class="smcap">Reginald Moran, Earl of  Chizelrigg.</span></p>

<br>

<p>"I should doubt if that were a legal will," said I. "It
doesn't need to be," replied the young man with a smile. "I am
next of kin, and heir to everything he possessed, although, of
course, he might have given his money elsewhere if he had chosen
to do so. Why he did not bequeath it to some institution, I do
not know. He knew no man personally except his own servants, whom
he misused and starved; but, as he told them, he misused and
starved himself, so they had no cause to grumble. He said he was
treating them like one of the family. I suppose he thought it
would cause me more worry and anxiety if he concealed the money,
and put me on the wrong scent, which I am convinced he has done,
than to leave it openly to any person or charity."</p>

<p>"I need not ask if you have searched the library?"</p>

<p>"Searched it? Why, there never was such a search since the
world began!"</p>

<p>"Possibly you put the task into incompetent hands?"</p>

<p>"You are hinting, Monsieur Valmont, that I engaged others
until my money was gone, then came to you with a speculative
proposal. Let me assure you such is not the case. Incompetent
hands, I grant you, but the hands were my own. For the past six
months I have lived practically as my uncle lived. I have
rummaged that library from floor to ceiling. It was left in a
frightful state, littered with old newspapers, accounts, and what
not. Then, of course, there were the books remaining in the
library, still a formidable collection."</p>

<p>"Was your uncle a religious man?"</p>

<p>"I could not say. I surmise not. You see, I was unacquainted
with him, and never saw him until after his death. I fancy he was
not religious, otherwise he could not have acted as he did.
Still, he proved himself a man of such twisted mentality that
anything is possible."</p>

<p>"I knew a case once where an heir who expected a large sum of
money was bequeathed a family Bible, which he threw into the
fire, learning afterwards, to his dismay, that it contained many
thousands of pounds in Bank of England notes, the object of the
devisor being to induce the legatee to read the good Book or
suffer through the neglect of it."</p>

<p>"I have searched the scriptures," said the youthful earl with
a laugh, "but the benefit has been moral rather than
material."</p>

<p>"Is there any chance that your uncle has deposited his wealth
in a bank, and has written a check for the amount, leaving it
between two leaves of a book?"</p>

<p>"Anything is possible, monsieur, but I think that highly
improbable. I have gone through every tome, page by page, and I
suspect very few of the volumes have been opened for the last
twenty years."</p>

<p>"How much money do you estimate he accumulated?"</p>

<p>"He must have cleared more than a hundred thousand pounds, but
speaking of banking it, I would like to say that my uncle evinced
a deep distrust of banks, and never drew a check in his life, so
far as I am aware. All accounts were paid in gold by his old
steward, who first brought the receipted bill in to my uncle, and
then received the exact amount, after having left the room, and
waited until he was rung for, so that he might not learn the
repository from which my uncle drew his store. I believe if the
money is ever found it will be in gold, and I am very sure that
this will was written, if we may call it a will, to put us on the
wrong scent."</p>

<p>"Have you had the library cleared out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; it is practically as my uncle left it. I realized
that if I were to call in help, it would be well that the
newcomer found it undisturbed."</p>

<p>"You were quite right, my lord. You say you examined all the
papers?"</p>

<p>"Yes; so far as that is concerned, the room has been very
fairly gone over, but nothing that was in it the day my uncle
died has been removed, not even his anvil."</p>

<p>"His anvil?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I told you he made a blacksmith's shop, as well as
bedroom, of the library. It is a huge room, with a great
fireplace at one end which formed an excellent forge. He and the
steward built the forge in the eastern fireplace, of brick and
clay, with their own hands, and erected there a secondhand
blacksmith's bellows."</p>

<p>"What work did he do at his forge?"</p>

<p>"Oh, anything that was required about the place. He seems to
have been a very expert ironworker. He would never buy a new
implement for the garden or the house so long as he could get one
secondhand, and he never bought anything secondhand while at his
forge he might repair what was already in use. He kept an old
cob, on which he used to ride through the park, and he always put
the shoes on this cob himself, the steward informs me, so he must
have understood the use of blacksmith's tools. He made a
carpenter's shop of the chief drawing-room and erected a bench
there. I think a very useful mechanic was spoiled when my uncle
became an earl."</p>

<p>"You have been living at the Chase since your uncle died?"</p>

<p>"If you call it living, yes. The old steward and his wife have
been looking after me, as they looked after my uncle, and, seeing
me day after day, coatless, and covered with dust, I imagine they
think me a second edition of the old man."</p>

<p>"Does the steward know the money is missing?"</p>

<p>"No; no one knows it but myself. This will was left on the
anvil, in an envelope addressed to me."</p>

<p>"Your statement is exceedingly clear, Lord Chizelrigg, but I
confess I don't see much daylight through it. Is there a pleasant
country around Chizelrigg Chase?"</p>

<p>"Very; especially at this season of the year. In autumn and
winter the house is a little draughty. It needs several thousand
pounds to put it in repair."</p>

<p>"Draughts do not matter in the summer. I have been long enough
in England not to share the fear of my countrymen for a
<i>courant d'air</i>. Is there a spare bed in the manor house, or
shall I take down a cot with me, or let us say a hammock?"</p>

<p>"Really," stammered the earl, blushing again, "you must not
think I detailed all these circumstances in order to influence
you to take up what may be a hopeless case. I, of course, am
deeply interested, and, therefore, somewhat prone to be carried
away when I begin a recital of my uncle's eccentricities. If I
receive your permission, I will call on you again in a month or
two. To tell you the truth, I borrowed a little money from the
old steward, and visited London to see my legal advisers, hoping
that in the circumstances I may get permission to sell something
that will keep me from starvation. When I spoke of the house
being denuded, I meant relatively, of course. There are still a
good many antiquities which would doubtless bring me in a
comfortable sum of money. I have been borne up by the belief that
I should find my uncle's gold. Lately I have been beset by a
suspicion that the old gentleman thought the library the only
valuable asset left, and for this reason wrote his note, thinking
I would be afraid to sell anything from that room. The old rascal
must have made a pot of money out of those shelves. The catalogue
shows that there was a copy of the first book printed in England
by Caxton, and several priceless Shakespeares, as well as many
other volumes that a collector would give a small fortune for.
All these are gone. I think when I show this to be the case, the
authorities cannot refuse me the right to sell something, and, if
I get this permission, I shall at once call upon you."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Lord Chizelrigg. Put your application in motion, if
you like. Meanwhile, I beg of you to look upon me as a more
substantial banker than your old steward. Let us enjoy a good
dinner together at the Cecil to-night, if you will do me the
honor to be my guest. To-morrow we can leave for Chizelrigg
Chase. How far is it?"</p>

<p>"About three hours," replied the young man, becoming as red as
a new Queen Anne villa. "Really, Monsieur Valmont, you overwhelm
me with your kindness, but nevertheless I accept your generous
offer."</p>

<p>"Then that's settled. What's the name of the old steward?"</p>

<p>"Higgins."</p>

<p>"You are certain he has no knowledge of the hiding-place of
this treasure?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite sure. My uncle was not a man to make a confidant of
anyone, least of all an old babbler like Higgins."</p>

<p>"Well, I should like to be introduced to Higgins as a
benighted foreigner. That will make him despise me, and treat me
like a child."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say," protested the earl, "I should have thought you'd
lived long enough in England to have got out of the notion that
we do not appreciate the foreigner. Indeed, we are the only
nation in the world that extends a cordial welcome to him, rich
or poor."</p>

<p><i>"Certainement</i>, my lord, I should be deeply disappointed
did you not take me at my proper valuation, but I cherish no
delusions regarding the contempt with which Higgins will regard
me. He will look upon me as a sort of simpleton to whom the Lord
has been unkind by not making England my native land. Now,
Higgins must be led to believe that I am in his own class; that
is, a servant of yours. Higgins and I will gossip over the fire
together, should these spring evenings prove chilly, and before
two or three weeks are past I shall have learned a great deal
about your uncle that you never dreamed of. Higgins will talk
more freely with a fellow-servant than with his master, however
much he may respect that master, and then, as I am a foreigner,
he will babble down to my comprehension, and I shall get details
that he never would think of giving to a fellow-countryman."</p>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII<br>

LORD CHIZELRIGG'S MISSING FORTUNE</h2>

<p class="first">
THE young earl's modesty in such description of his home as he
had given me left me totally unprepared for the grandeur of the
mansion, one corner of which he inhabited. It is such a place as
you read of in romances of the Middle Ages; not a pinnacled or
turreted French <i>château</i> of that period, but a beautiful
and substantial stone manor house of a ruddy color, whose warm
hue seemed to add a softness to the severity of its architecture.
It is built round an outer and an inner courtyard, and could
house a thousand, rather than the hundred with which its owner
had accredited it. There are many stone-mullioned windows, and
one at the end of the library might well have graced a cathedral.
This superb residence occupies the center of a heavily timbered
park, and from the lodge at the gates we drove at least a mile
and a half under the grandest avenue of old oaks I have ever
seen. It seemed incredible that the owner of all this should
actually lack the ready money to pay his fare to town!</p>

<p>Old Higgins met us at the station with a somewhat rickety
cart, to which was attached the ancient cob that the late earl
used to shoe. We entered a noble hall, which probably looked the
larger because of the entire absence of any kind of furniture,
unless two complete suits of venerable armor which stood on
either hand might be considered as furnishing. I laughed aloud
when the door was shut, and the sound echoed like the merriment
of ghosts from the dim timbered roof above me.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" asked the earl. "I am laughing to
see you put your modern tall hat on that mediaeval helmet."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it! Well, put yours on the other. I mean no
disrespect to the ancestor who wore this suit, harmless,
necessary hatrack, so I put my topper on the antique helmet, and
thrust the umbrella (if I have one) in behind here, and down one
of his legs. Since I came in possession, a very crafty-looking
dealer from London visited me, and attempted to sound me
regarding the sale of these suits of armor. I gathered he would
give enough money to keep me in new suits, London made, for the
rest of my life, but when I endeavored to find out if he had had
commercial dealings with my prophetic uncle, he became frightened
and bolted. I imagine that if I had possessed presence of mind
enough to have lured him into one of our most uncomfortable
dungeons, I might have learned where some of the family treasures
went to. Come up these stairs, Monsieur Valmont, and I will show
you your room."</p>

<p>We had lunched on the train coming down, so after a wash in my
own room I proceeded at once to inspect the library. It proved,
indeed, a most noble apartment, and it had been scandalously used
by the old reprobate, its late tenant. There were two huge
fireplaces, one in the middle of the north wall and the other at
the eastern end. In the latter had been erected a rude brick
forge, and beside the forge hung a great black bellows, smoky
with usage. On a wooden block lay the anvil, and around it rested
and rusted several hammers, large and small. At the western end
was a glorious window filled with ancient stained glass, which,
as I have said, might have adorned a cathedral. Extensive as the
collection of books was, the great size of this chamber made it
necessary that only the outside wall should be covered with
bookcases, and even these were divided by tall windows. The
opposite wall was blank, with the exception of a picture here and
there, and these pictures offered a further insult to the room,
for they were cheap prints, mostly colored lithographs that had
appeared in Christmas numbers of London weekly journals, incased
in poverty-stricken frames, hanging from nails ruthlessly driven
in above them. The floor was covered with a litter of papers, in
some places knee-deep, and in the corner farthest from the forge
still stood the bed on which the ancient miser had died.</p>

<p>"Looks like a stable, doesn't it?" commented the earl, when I
had finished my inspection. "I am sure the old boy simply filled
it up with this rubbish to give me the trouble of examining it.
Higgins tells me that up to within a month before he died the
room was reasonably clear of all this muck. Of course it had to
be, or the place would have caught fire from the sparks of the
forge. The old man made Higgins gather all the papers he could
find anywhere about the place, ancient accounts, newspapers, and
what not, even to the brown wrapping paper you see, in which
parcels came, and commanded him to strew the floor with this
litter, because, as he complained, Higgins's boots on the boards
made too much noise, and Higgins, who is not in the least of an
inquiring mind, accepted this explanation as entirely meeting the
case."</p>

<p>Higgins proved to be a garrulous old fellow, who needed no
urging to talk about the late earl; indeed, it was almost
impossible to deflect his conversation into any other channel.
Twenty years' intimacy with the eccentric nobleman had largely
obliterated that sense of deference with which an English servant
usually approaches his master. An English underling's idea of
nobility is the man who never by any possibility works with his
hands. The fact that Lord Chizelrigg had toiled at the
carpenter's bench; had mixed cement in the drawing-room; had
caused the anvil to ring out till midnight, aroused no admiration
in Higgins's mind. In addition to this, the ancient nobleman had
been penuriously strict in his examination of accounts, exacting
the uttermost farthing, so the humble servitor regarded his
memory with supreme contempt. I realized before the drive was
finished from the station to Chizelrigg Chase that there was
little use of introducing me to Higgins as a foreigner and a
fellow-servant. I found myself completely unable to understand
what the old fellow said. His dialect was as unknown to me as the
Choctaw language would have been, and the young earl was
compelled to act as interpreter on the occasions when we set this
garrulous talking machine going.</p>

<p>The new Earl of Chizelrigg, with the enthusiasm of a boy,
proclaimed himself my pupil and assistant, and said he would do
whatever he was told. His thorough and fruitless search of the
library had convinced him that the old man was merely chaffing
him, as he put it, by leaving such a letter as he had written.
His lordship was certain that the money had been hidden somewhere
else; probably buried under one of the trees in the park. Of
course, this was possible, and represented the usual method by
which a stupid person conceals treasure, yet I did not think it
probable. All conversations with Higgins showed the earl to have
been an extremely suspicious man; suspicious of banks, suspicious
even of Bank of England notes, suspicious of every person on
earth, not omitting Higgins himself. Therefore, as I told his
nephew, the miser would never allow the fortune out of his sight
and immediate reach.</p>

<p>From the first the oddity of the forge and anvil being placed
in his bedroom struck me as peculiar, and I said to the young
man:</p>

<p>"I'll stake my reputation that that forge or anvil, or both,
contain the secret. You see, the old gentleman worked sometimes
till midnight, for Higgins could hear his hammering. If he used
hard coal on the forge, the fire would last through the night,
and being in continual terror of thieves, as Higgins says,
barricading the castle every evening before dark, as if it were a
fortress, he was bound to place the treasure in the most unlikely
spot for a thief to get at it. Now, the coal fire smoldered all
night long, and if the gold was in the forge underneath the
embers, it would be extremely difficult to get at. A robber
rummaging in the dark would burn his fingers in more senses than
one. Then, as his lordship kept no less than four loaded
revolvers under his pillow, all he had to do, if a thief entered
his room, was to allow the search to go on until the thief
started at the forge, then, doubtless, as he had the range with
reasonable accuracy, night or day, he might sit up in bed and
blaze away with revolver after revolver. There were twenty-eight
shots that could be fired in about double as many seconds, so you
see the robber stood little chance in the face of such a
fusillade. I propose that we dismantle the forge."</p>

<p>Lord Chizelrigg was much taken by my reasoning, and one
morning early we cut down the big bellows, tore it open, found it
empty, then took brick after brick from the forge with a crowbar,
for the old man had builded better than he knew with Portland
cement. In fact, when we cleared away the rubbish between the
bricks and the core of the furnace we came upon one cube of
cement which was as hard as granite. With the aid of Higgins, and
a set of rollers and levers, we managed to get this block out
into the park, and attempted to crush it with the sledge hammers
belonging to the forge, in which we were entirely unsuccessful.
The more it resisted our efforts, the more certain we bell came
that the coins would be found within it. As this would not be
treasure-trove in the sense that the Government might make a
claim upon it, there was no particular necessity for secrecy, so
we had up a man from the mines near by with drills and dynamite,
who speedily shattered the block into a million pieces, more or
less. Alas! there was no trace in its <i>débris</i> of "pay
dirt," as the western miner puts it. While the dynamite expert
was on the spot, we induced him to shatter the anvil as well as
the block of cement, and then the workman, doubtless thinking the
new earl was as insane as the old one had been, shouldered his
tools and went back to his mine.</p>

<p>The earl reverted to his former opinion that the gold was
concealed in the park, while I held even more firmly to my own
belief that the fortune rested in the library.</p>

<p>"It is obvious," I said to him, "that if the treasure is
buried outside, some one must have dug the hole. A man so
timorous and so reticent as your uncle would allow no one to do
this but himself. Higgins maintained the other evening that all
picks and spades were safely locked up by himself each night in
the tool house. The mansion itself was barricaded with such
exceeding care that it would have been difficult for your uncle
to get outside even if he wished to do so. Then such a man as
your uncle is described to have been would continually desire
ocular demonstration that his savings were intact, which would be
practically impossible if the gold had found a grave in the park
I propose now that we abandon violence and dynamite, and proceed
to an intellectual search of the library."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the young earl; "but as I have already
searched the library very thoroughly, your use of the word
'intellectual,' Monsieur Valmont, is not in accord with your
customary politeness. However, I am with you. Tis for you to
command, and me to obey."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my lord," I said, "I used the word 'intellectual'
in contradistinction to the word 'dynamite.' It had no
reference to your former search. I merely propose that we now
abandon the use of chemical reaction, and employ the much greater
force of mental activity. Did you notice any writing on the
margins of the newspapers you examined?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not."</p>

<p>"Is it possible that there may have been some communication on
the white border of a newspaper?"</p>

<p>"It is, of course, possible."</p>

<p>"Then will you set yourself to the task of glancing over the
margin of every newspaper, piling them away in another room when
your scrutiny of each is complete? Do not destroy anything, but
we must clear out the library completely. I am interested in the
accounts, and will examine them."</p>

<p>It was exasperatingly tedious work; but after several days my
assistant reported every margin scanned without result, while I
had collected each bill and memorandum, classifying them
according to date. I could not get rid of a suspicion that the
contrary old beast had written instructions for the finding of
the treasure on the back of some account, or on the flyleaf of a
book, and as I looked at the thousands of volumes still left in
the library, the prospect of such a patient and minute search
appalled me. But I remembered Edison's words to the effect that
if a thing exists, search, exhaustive enough, will find it. From
the mass of accounts I selected several; the rest I placed in
another room, alongside the heap of the earl's newspapers.</p>

<p>"Now," said I to my helper, "if it please you, we will have
Higgins in, as I wish some explanation of these accounts."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can assist you," suggested his lordship, drawing up
a chair opposite the table on which I had spread the statements.
"I have lived here for six months, and know as much about things
as Higgins does. He is so difficult to stop when once he begins
to talk. What is the first account you wish further light
upon?"</p>

<p>"To go back thirteen years, I find that your uncle bought a
secondhand safe in Sheffield. Here is the bill. I consider it
necessary to find that safe."</p>

<p>"Pray forgive me, Monsieur Valmont," cried the young man,
springing to his feet and laughing; "so heavy an article as a
safe should not slip readily from a man's memory, but it did from
mine. The safe is empty, and I gave no more thought to it."</p>

<p>Saying this, the earl went to one of the bookcases that stood
against the wall, pulled it round as if it were a door, books and
all, and displayed the front of an iron safe, the door of which
he also drew open, exhibiting the usual empty interior of such a
receptacle.</p>

<p>"I came on this," he said, "when I took down all these
volumes. It appears that there was once a secret door leading
from the library into an outside room, which has long since
disappeared; the walls are very thick. My uncle doubtless caused
this door to be taken off its hinges, and the safe placed in the
aperture, the rest of which he then bricked up."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said I, endeavoring to conceal my disappointment.
"As this strong box was bought secondhand and not made to order,
I suppose there can be no secret crannies in it?"</p>

<p>"It looks like a common or garden safe," reported my
assistant, "but we'll have it out if you say so."</p>

<p>"Not just now," I replied; "we've had enough of dynamiting to
make us feel like housebreakers already."</p>

<p>"I agree with you. What's the next item on the programme?"</p>

<p>"Your uncle's mania for buying things at second hand was
broken in three instances so far as I have been able to learn
from a scrutiny of these accounts. About four years ago he
purchased a new book from Denny &amp; Co., the well-known booksellers
of the Strand. Denny &amp; Co. deal only in new books. Is there any
comparatively new volume in the library?"</p>

<p>"Not one."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite; I searched all the literature in the house. What
is the name of the volume he bought?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot decipher. The initial letter looks like 'M,'
but the rest is a mere wavy line. I see, however, that it cost
twelve-and-sixpence, while the cost of carriage by parcel post
was sixpence, which shows it weighed something under four pounds.
This, with the price of the book, induces me to think it was a
scientific work, printed on heavy paper and illustrated."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of it," said the earl.</p>

<p>"The third account is for wall paper; twenty-seven rolls of an
expensive wall paper, and twenty-seven rolls of a cheap paper,
the latter being just half the price of the former. This wall
paper seems to have been supplied by a tradesman in the station
road in the village of Chizelrigg."</p>

<p>"There's your wall paper," cried the youth, waving his hand;
"he was going to paper the whole house, Higgins told me, but got
tired after he had finished the library, which took him nearly a
year to accomplish, for he worked at it very intermittently,
mixing the paste in the <i>boudoir</i>, a pailful at a time, as
he needed it. It was a scandalous thing to do, for underneath the
paper is the most exquisite oak paneling, very plain, but very
rich in color."</p>

<p>I rose and examined the paper on the wall. It was dark brown,
and answered the description of the expensive paper on the
bill.</p>

<p>"What became of the cheap paper?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I think," said I, "we are on the track of the mystery. I
believe that paper covers a sliding panel or concealed door."</p>

<p>"It is very likely," replied the earl. "I intended to have the
paper off, but I had no money to pay a workman, and I am not so
industrious as was my uncle. What is your remaining account?"</p>

<p>"The last also pertains to paper, but comes from a firm in
Budge Row, London, E.C. He has had, it seems, a thousand sheets
of it, and it appears to have been frightfully expensive. This
bill is also illegible, but I take it a thousand sheets were
supplied, although, of course, it may have been a thousand
quires, which would be a little more reasonable for the price
charged, or a thousand reams, which would be exceedingly
cheap."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that. Let's turn on Higgins."</p>

<p>Higgins knew nothing of this last order of paper either. The
wall-paper mystery he at once cleared up. Apparently the old earl
had discovered by experiment that the heavy, expensive wall paper
would not stick to the glossy paneling, so he had purchased a
cheaper paper, and had pasted that on first. Higgins said he had
gone all over the paneling with a yellowish-white paper, and
after that was dry he pasted over it the more expensive
rolls.</p>

<p>"But," I objected, "the two papers were bought and delivered
at the same time; therefore he could not have found by experiment
that the heavy paper would not stick."</p>

<p>"I don't think there is much in that," commented the earl;
"the heavy paper may have been bought first, and found to be
unsuitable, and then the coarse, cheap paper bought afterwards.
The bill merely shows that the account was sent in on that date.
Indeed, as the village of Chizelrigg is but a few miles away, it
would have been quite possible for my uncle to have bought the
heavy paper in the morning, tried it, and in the afternoon sent
for the commoner lot; but, in any case, the bill would not have
been presented until months after the order, and the two
purchases were thus lumped together."</p>

<p>I was forced to confess that this seemed reasonable.</p>

<p>Now, about the book ordered from Denny's. Did Higgins remember
anything regarding it? It came four years ago.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, Higgins did; he remembered it very well indeed. He
had come in one morning with the earl's tea, and the old man was
sitting up in bed reading this volume with such interest that he
was unaware of Higgins's knock, and Higgins himself, being a
little hard of hearing, took for granted the command to enter.
The earl hastily thrust the book under the pillow, alongside the
revolvers, and rated Higgins in a most cruel way for entering the
room before getting permission to do so. He had never seen the
earl so angry before, and he laid it all to this book. It was
after the book had come that the forge had been erected and the
anvil bought. Higgins never saw the book again, but one morning,
six months before the earl died, Higgins, in raking out the
cinders of the forge, found what he supposed was a portion of the
book's cover. He believed his master had burned the volume.</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>Having dismissed Higgins, I said to the earl:</p>

<p>"The first thing to be done is to inclose this bill to Denny &amp;
Co., booksellers, Strand. Tell them you have lost the volume, and
ask them to send another. There is likely some one in the shop
who can decipher the illegible writing. I am certain the book
will give us a clew. Now, I shall write to Braun &amp; Sons, Budge
Row. This is evidently a French company; in fact, the name as
connected with paper making runs in my mind, although I cannot at
this moment place it. I shall ask them the use of this paper that
they furnished to the late earl."</p>

<p>This was done accordingly, and now, as we thought, until the
answers came, we were two men out of work. Yet the next morning,
I am pleased to say, and I have always rather plumed myself on
the fact, I solved the mystery before replies were received from
London. Of course, both the book and the answer of the paper
agents, by putting two and two together, would have given us the
key.</p>

<p>After breakfast I strolled somewhat aimlessly into the
library, whose floor was now strewn merely with brown wrapping
paper, bits of string, and all that. As I shuffled among this
with my feet, as if tossing aside dead autumn leaves in a forest
path, my attention was suddenly drawn to several squares of
paper, unwrinkled, and never used for wrapping. These sheets
seemed to me strangely familiar. I picked one of them up, and at
once the significance of the name Braun &amp; Sons occurred to me.
They are paper makers in France, who produce a smooth, very tough
sheet, which, dear as it is, proves infinitely cheap compared
with the fine vellum it deposed in a certain branch of industry.
In Paris, years before, these sheets had given me the knowledge
of how a gang of thieves disposed of their gold without melting
it. The paper was used instead of vellum in the rougher processes
of manufacturing gold leaf. It stood the constant beating of the
hammer nearly as well as the vellum, and here at once there
flashed on me the secret of the old man's midnight anvil work. He
was transforming his sovereigns into gold leaf, which must have
been of a rude, thick kind, because to produce the gold leaf of
commerce he still needed the vellum as well as a "cutch" and
other machinery, of which we had found no trace.</p>

<p>"My lord," I called to my assistant (he was at the other end
of the room), "I wish to test a theory on the anvil of your own
fresh common sense."</p>

<p>"Hammer away," replied the earl, approaching me with his usual
good-natured, jocular expression.</p>

<p>"I eliminate the safe from our investigations because it was
purchased thirteen years ago, but the buying of the book, of wall
covering, of this tough paper from France, all group themselves
into a set of incidents occurring within the same month as the
purchase of the anvil and the building of the forge; therefore, I
think they are related to one another. Here are some sheets of
paper he got from Budge Row. Have you ever seen anything like it?
Try to tear this sample."</p>

<p>"It's reasonably tough," admitted his lordship, fruitlessly
endeavoring to rip it apart.</p>

<p>"Yes. It was made in France, and is used in gold beating. Your
uncle beat his sovereigns into gold leaf. You will find that the
book from Denny's is a volume on gold beating, and now as I
remember that scribbled word which I could not make out, I think
the title of the volume is 'Metallurgy.' It contains, no doubt,
a chapter on the manufacture of gold leaf."</p>

<p>"I believe you," said the earl; "but I don't see that the
discovery sets us any farther forward. We're now looking for gold
leaf instead of sovereigns.".</p>

<p>"Let's examine this wall paper," said I.</p>

<p>I placed my knife under a corner of it at the floor, and quite
easily ripped off a large section. As Higgins had said, the brown
paper was on top, and the coarse, light-colored paper underneath.
But even that came away from the oak paneling as easily as though
it hung there from habit, and not because of paste.</p>

<p>"Feel the weight of that," I cried, handing him the sheet I
had torn from the wall.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said the earl, in a voice almost of awe.</p>

<p>I took it from him, and laid it, face downward, on the wooden
table, threw a little water on the back, and with a knife scraped
away the porous white paper. Instantly there gleamed up at us the
baleful yellow of the gold. I shrugged my shoulders and spread
out my hands. The Earl of Chizelrigg laughed aloud and very
heartily.</p>

<p>"You see how it is," I cried. "The old man first covered the
entire wall with this whitish paper. He heated his sovereigns at
the forge and beat them out on the anvil, then completed the
process rudely between the sheets of this paper from France.
Probably he pasted the gold to the wall as soon as he shut
himself in for the night, and covered it over with the more
expensive paper before Higgins entered in the morning."</p>

<p>We found afterwards, however, that he had actually fastened
the thick sheets of gold to the wall with carpet tacks.</p>

<p>His lordship netted a trifle over a hundred and twenty-three
thousand pounds through my discovery, and I am pleased to pay
tribute to the young man's generosity by saying that his
voluntary settlement made my bank account swell stout as a City
alderman.</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br>

THE FUTILITY OF A SEARCH WARRANT</h2>

<p class="first">
SOME years ago I enjoyed the unique experience of pursuing a
man for one crime, and getting evidence against him of another.
He was innocent of the misdemeanor, the proof of which I sought,
but was guilty of another most serious offense, yet he and his
confederates escaped scot-free in circumstances which I now
purpose to relate.</p>

<p>You may remember that in Rudyard Kipling's story, "Bedalia
Herodsfoot," the unfortunate woman's husband ran the risk of
being arrested as a simple drunkard, at a moment when the blood
of murder was upon his boots. The case of Ralph Summertrees was
rather the reverse of this. The English authorities were trying
to fasten upon him a crime almost as important as murder, while I
was collecting evidence which proved him guilty of an action much
more momentous than that of drunkenness.</p>

<p>The English authorities have always been good enough, when
they recognize my existence at all, to look down upon me with
amused condescension. If to-day you ask Spenser Hale, of Scotland
Yard, what he thinks of Eugène Valmont, that complacent man will
put on the superior smile which so well becomes him, and if you
are a very intimate friend of his, he may draw down the lid of
his right eye as he replies:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; a very decent fellow, Valmont, but he's a
Frenchman!" as if, that said, there was no need of further
inquiry.</p>

<p>Myself, I like the English detective very much, and if I were
to be in a <i>mêlée</i> to-morrow, there is no man I would rather
find beside me than Spenser Hale. In any situation where a fist
that can fell an ox is desirable, my friend Hale is a useful
companion, but for intellectuality, mental acumen,
finesse&mdash;ah, well! I am the most modest of men, and will say
nothing.</p>

<p>It would amuse you to see this giant come into my room during
an evening, on the bluff pretense that he wishes to smoke a pipe
with me. There is the same difference between this good-natured
giant and myself as exists between that strong black pipe of his
and my delicate cigarette, which I smoke feverishly, when he is
present, to protect myself from the fumes of his terrible
tobacco. I look with delight upon the huge man, who, with an air
of the utmost good humor, and a twinkle in his eye as he thinks
he is twisting me about his finger, vainly endeavors to obtain a
hint regarding whatever case is perplexing him at that moment. I
baffle him with the ease that an active greyhound eludes the
pursuit of a heavy mastiff, then at last I say to him, with a
laugh:</p>

<p>"Come, <i>mon ami</i> Hale, tell me all about it, and I will
help you if I can."</p>

<p>Once or twice at the beginning he shook his massive head, and
replied the secret was not his. The last time he did this I
assured him that what he said was quite correct, and then I
related full particulars of the situation in which he found
himself, excepting the names, for these he had not mentioned. I
had pieced together his perplexity from scraps of conversation in
his half-hour's fishing for my advice, which, of course, he could
have had for the plain asking. Since that time he has not come to
me except with cases he feels at liberty to reveal, and one or
two complications I have happily been enabled to unravel for
him.</p>

<p>But, stanch as Spenser Hale holds the belief that no detective
service on earth can excel that centering in Scotland Yard, there
is one department of activity in which even he confesses that
Frenchmen are his masters, although he somewhat grudgingly
qualifies his admission, by adding that we in France are
constantly allowed to do what is prohibited in England. I refer
to the minute search of a house during the owner's absence. If
you read that excellent story entitled "The Purloined Letter,"
by Edgar Allan Poe, you will find a record of the kind of thing I
mean, which is better than any description I, who have so often
taken part in such a search, can set down.</p>

<p>Now, these people among whom I live are proud of their phrase,
"The Englishman's house is his castle," and into that castle even
a policeman cannot penetrate without a legal warrant. This may be
all very well in theory, but if you are compelled to march up to
a man's house, blowing a trumpet and rattling a snare drum, you
need not be disappointed if you fail to find what you are in
search of when all the legal restrictions are complied with. Of
course, the English are a very excellent people, a fact to which
I am always proud to bear testimony, but it must be admitted that
for cold common sense the French are very much their superiors.
In Paris, if I wish to obtain an incriminating document, I do not
send the possessor a <i>carte postale</i> to inform him of my
desire, and in this procedure the French people sanely acquiesce.
I have known men who, when they go out to spend an evening on the
boulevards, toss their bunch of keys to the concierge,
saying:</p>

<p>"If you hear the police rummaging about while I'm away, pray
assist them, with an expression of my distinguished
consideration."</p>

<p>I remember, while I was chief detective in the service of the
French Government, being requested to call at a certain hour at
the private hotel of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was
during the time that Bismarck meditated a second attack upon my
country, and I am happy to say that I was then instrumental in
supplying the Secret Bureau with documents which mollified that
iron man's purpose, a fact which I think entitled me to my
country's gratitude, not that I ever even hinted such a claim
when a succeeding ministry forgot my services. The memory of a
republic, as has been said by a greater man than I, is short.
However, all that has nothing to do with the incident I am about
to relate. I merely mention the crisis to excuse a momentary
forgetfulness on my part which in any other country might have
been followed by serious results to myself. But in
France&mdash;ah, we understand those things, and nothing
happened.</p>

<p>I am the last person in the world to give myself away, as they
say in the great West. I am usually the calm, collected Eugène
Valmont whom nothing can perturb, but this was a time of great
tension, and I had become absorbed. I was alone with the minister
in his private house, and one of the papers he wished was in his
bureau at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; at least, he thought
so, and said:</p>

<p>"Ah! it is in my desk at the bureau. How annoying! I must send
for it!"</p>

<p>"No, Excellency," I cried, springing up in a self-oblivion the
most complete; "it is here." Touching the spring of a secret
drawer, I opened it, and taking out the document he wished,
handed it to him.</p>

<p>It was not until I met his searching look, and saw the faint
smile on his lips, that I realized what I had done.</p>

<p>"Valmont," he said quietly, "on whose behalf did you search my
house?"</p>

<p>"Excellency," I replied in tones no less agreeable than his
own, "to-night at your orders I pay a domiciliary visit to the
mansion of Baron Dumoulaine, who stands high in the estimation of
the President of the French Republic. If either of those
distinguished gentlemen should learn of my informal call, and
should ask me in whose interests I made the domiciliary visit,
what is it you wish that I should reply?"</p>

<p>"You should reply, Valmont, that you did it in the interests
of the Secret Service."</p>

<p>"I shall not fail to do so, Excellency, and in answer to your
question just now, I had the honor of searching this mansion in
the interests of the Secret Service of France."</p>

<p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs laughed; a hearty laugh that
expressed no resentment.</p>

<p>"I merely wished to compliment you, Valmont, on the efficiency
of your search and the excellence of your memory. This is indeed
the document which I thought was left in my office."</p>

<p>I wonder what Lord Lansdowne would say if Spenser Hale showed
an equal familiarity with his private papers! But now that we
have returned to our good friend Hale, we must not keep him
waiting any longer.</p>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br>

MR. SPENSER HALE OF SCOTLAND YARD</h2>

<p class="first">
I WELL remember the November day when I first heard of the
Summertrees case, because there hung over London a fog so thick
that two or three times I lost my way, and no cab was to be had
at any price. The few cabmen then in the streets were leading
their animals slowly along, making for their stables. It was one
of those depressing London days which filled me with <i>ennui</i>
and a yearning for my own clear city of Paris, where, if we are
ever visited by a slight mist, it is at least clean, white vapor,
and not this horrible London mixture saturated with suffocating
carbon. The fog was too thick for any passer to read the contents
bills of the newspapers plastered on the pavement, and as there
were probably no races that day the newsboys were shouting what
they considered the next most important event&mdash;the election
of an American President. I bought a paper and thrust it into my
pocket. It was late when I reached my flat, and, after dining
there, which was an unusual thing for me to do, I put on my
slippers, took an easy-chair before the fire, and began to read
my evening journal. I was distressed to learn that the eloquent
Mr. Bryan had been defeated.</p>

<p>I knew little about the silver question, but the man's
oratorical powers had appealed to me, and my sympathy was aroused
because he owned many silver mines, and yet the price of the
metal was so low that apparently he could not make a living
through the operation of them. But, of course, the cry that he
was a plutocrat, and a reputed millionaire over and over again,
was bound to defeat him in a democracy where the average voter is
exceedingly poor and not comfortably well-to-do, as is the case
with our peasants in France. I always took great interest in the
affairs of the huge republic to the west, having been at some
pains to inform myself accurately regarding its politics; and
although, as my readers know, I seldom quote anything
complimentary that is said of me, nevertheless, an American
client of mine once admitted that he never knew the true
inwardness&mdash;I think that was the phrase he used&mdash;of
American politics until he heard me discourse upon them. But
then, he added, he had been a very busy man all his life.</p>

<p>I had allowed my paper to slip to the floor, for in very truth
the fog was penetrating even into my flat, and it was becoming
difficult to read, notwithstanding the electric light. My man
came in, and announced that Mr. Spenser Hale wished to see me,
and, indeed, any night, but especially when there is rain or fog
outside, I am more pleased to talk with a friend than to read a
newspaper.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu</i>, my dear Monsieur Hale, it is a brave man
you are to venture out in such a fog as is abroad to-night."</p>

<p>"Ah, Monsieur Valmont," said Hale with pride, "you cannot
raise a fog like this in Paris!"</p>

<p>"No. There you are supreme," I admitted, rising and saluting
my visitor, then offering him a chair.</p>

<p>"I see you are reading the latest news," he said, indicating
my newspaper. "I am very glad that man Bryan is defeated. Now we
shall have better times."</p>

<p>I waved my hand as I took my chair again. I will discuss many
things with Spenser Hale, but not American politics; he does not
understand them. It is a common defect of the English to suffer
complete ignorance regarding the internal affairs of other
countries.</p>

<p>"It is surely an important thing that brought you out on such
a night as this. The fog must be very thick in Scotland
Yard."</p>

<p>This delicate shaft of fancy completely missed him, and he
answered stolidly:</p>

<p>"It's thick all over London, and, indeed, throughout most of
England."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," I agreed, but he did not see that either.</p>

<p>Still, a moment later, he made a remark which, if it had come
from some people I know, might have indicated a glimmer of
comprehension.</p>

<p>"You are a very, very clever man, Monsieur Valmont, so all I
need say is that the question which brought me here is the same
as that on which the American election was fought. Now, to a
countryman, I should be compelled to give further explanation,
but to you, monsieur, that will not be necessary."</p>

<p>There are times when I dislike the crafty smile and partial
closing of the eyes which always distinguishes Spenser Hale when
he places on the table a problem which he expects will baffle me.
If I said he never did baffle me, I would be wrong, of course,
for sometimes the utter simplicity of the puzzles which trouble
him leads me into an intricate involution entirely unnecessary in
the circumstances.</p>

<p>I pressed my finger tips together, and gazed for a few moments
at the ceiling. Hale had lit his black pipe, and my silent
servant placed at his elbow the whisky and soda, then tiptoed out
of the room. As the door closed my eyes came from the ceiling to
the level of Hale's expansive countenance.</p>

<p>"Have they eluded you?" I asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The coiners."</p>

<p>Hale's pipe dropped from his jaw, but he managed to catch it
before it reached the floor. Then he took a gulp from the
tumbler.</p>

<p>"That was just a lucky shot," he said.</p>

<p><i>"Parfaitement,"</i> I replied carelessly.</p>

<p>"Now, own up, Valmont, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. A man cannot contradict a guest in
his own house.</p>

<p>"Oh, stow that!" cried Hale impolitely. He is a trifle prone
to strong and even slangy expressions when puzzled. "Tell me how
you guessed it."</p>

<p>"It is very simple, <i>mon ami</i>. The question on which the
American election was fought is the price of silver, which is so
low that it has ruined Mr. Bryan, and threatens to ruin all the
farmers of the West who possess silver mines on their farms.
Silver troubled America, <i>ergo</i> silver troubles Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p>"Very well; the natural inference is that some one has stolen
bars of silver. But such a theft happened three months ago, when
the metal was being unloaded from a German steamer at
Southampton, and my dear friend Spenser Hale ran down the thieves
very cleverly as they were trying to dissolve the marks off the
bars with acid. Now crimes do not run in series, like the numbers
in roulette at Monte Carlo. The thieves are men of brains. They
say to themselves, 'What chance is there successfully to steal
bars of silver while Mr. Hale is at Scotland Yard?' Eh, my good
friend?"</p>

<p>"Really, Valmont," said Hale, taking another sip, "sometimes
you almost persuade me that you have reasoning powers."</p>

<p>"Thanks, comrade. Then it is not a <i>theft</i> of silver we
have now to deal with. But the American election was fought on
the <i>price</i> of silver. If silver had been high in cost,
there would have been no silver question. So the crime that is
bothering you arises through the low price of silver, and this
suggests that it must be a case of illicit coinage, for there the
low price of the metal comes in. You have, perhaps, found a more
subtle illegitimate act going forward than heretofore. Some one
is making your shillings and your half crowns from real silver,
instead of from baser metal, and yet there is a large profit
which has not hitherto been possible through the high price of
silver. With the old conditions you were familiar, but this new
element sets at naught all your previous formulas. That is how I
reasoned the matter out."</p>

<p>"Well, Valmont, you have hit it, I'll say that for you; you
have hit it. There is a gang of expert coiners who are putting
out real silver money, and making a clear shilling on the half
crown. We can find no trace of the coiners, but we know the man
who is shoving the stuff."</p>

<p>"That ought to be sufficient," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes, it should, but it hasn't proved so up to date. Now I
came to-night to see if you would do one of your French tricks
for us, right on the quiet."</p>

<p>"What French trick, Monsieur Spenser Hale?" I inquired with
some asperity, forgetting for the moment that the man invariably
became impolite when he grew excited.</p>

<p>"No offense intended," said this blundering officer, who
really is a good-natured fellow, but always puts his foot in it,
and then apologizes. "I want some one to go through a man's house
without a search warrant, spot the evidence, let me know, and
then we'll rush the place before he has time to hide his
tracks."</p>

<p>"Who is this man, and where does he live?"</p>

<p>"His name is Ralph Summertrees, and he lives in a very natty
little <i>bijou</i> residence, as the advertisements call it,
situated in no less a fashionable street than Park Lane."</p>

<p>"I see. What has aroused your suspicions against him?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know, that's an expensive district to live in; it
takes a bit of money to do the trick. This Summertrees has no
ostensible business, yet every Friday he goes to the United
Capital Bank in Piccadilly, and deposits a bag of swag, usually
all silver coin."</p>

<p>"Yes; and this money?"</p>

<p>"This money, so far as we can learn, contains a good many of
these new pieces which never saw the British Mint."</p>

<p>"It's not all the new coinage, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, he's a bit too artful for that! You see, a man can go
round London, his pockets filled with new-coined five-shilling
pieces, buy this, that, and the other, and come home with his
change in legitimate coins of the realm&mdash;half crowns,
florins, shillings, sixpences, and all that."</p>

<p>"I see. Then why don't you nab him one day when his pockets
are stuffed with illegitimate five-shilling pieces?"</p>

<p>"That could be done, of course, and I've thought of it, but,
you see, we want to land the whole gang. Once we arrested him,
without knowing where the money came from, the real coiners would
take flight."</p>

<p>"How do you know he is not the real coiner himself?"</p>

<p>Now poor Hale is as easy to read as a book. He hesitated
before answering this question, and looked confused as a culprit
caught in some dishonest act.</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid to tell me," I said soothingly, after
a pause. "You have had one of your men in Mr. Summertrees's
house, and so learned that he is not the coiner. But your man has
not succeeded in getting you evidence to incriminate other
people."</p>

<p>"You've about hit it again, Monsieur Valmont. One of my men
has been Summertrees's butler for two weeks, but, as you say, he
has found no evidence."</p>

<p>"Is he still butler?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Now tell me how far you have got. You know that Summertrees
deposits a bag of coin every Friday in the Piccadilly Bank, and I
suppose the bank has allowed you to examine one or two of the
bags."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, they have, but, you see, banks are very difficult
to treat with. They don't like detectives bothering round, and
while they do not stand out against the law, still they never
answer any more questions than they're asked, and Mr. Summertrees
has been a good customer at the United Capital for many
years."</p>

<p>"Haven't you found out where the money comes from?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we have; it is brought there night after night by a man
who looks like a respectable city clerk, and he puts it into a
large safe, of which he holds the key, this safe being on the
ground floor, in the dining room."</p>

<p>"Haven't you followed the clerk?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He sleeps in the Park Lane house every night and goes up
in the morning to an old curiosity shop in Tottenham Court Road,
where he stays all day, returning with his bag of money in the
evening."</p>

<p>"Why don't you arrest and question him?"</p>

<p>"Well, Monsieur Valmont, there is just the same objection to
his arrest as to that of Summertrees himself. We could easily
arrest both, but we have not the slightest evidence against
either of them, and then, although we put the go-betweens in
clink, the worst criminals of the lot would escape."</p>

<p>"Nothing suspicious about the old curiosity shop?"</p>

<p>"No. It appears to be perfectly regular."</p>

<p>"This game has been going on under your noses for how
long?"</p>

<p>"For about six weeks."</p>

<p>"Is Summertrees a married man?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Are there any women servants in the house?"</p>

<p>"No, except that three charwomen come in every morning to do
up the rooms."</p>

<p>"Of what is his household comprised?"</p>

<p>"There is the butler, then the valet, and last the French
cook."</p>

<p>"Ah," cried I, "the French cook! This case interests me. So
Summertrees has succeeded in completely disconcerting your man?
Has he prevented him going from top to bottom of the house?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! He has rather assisted him than otherwise. On one
occasion he went to the safe, took out the money, had
Podgers&mdash;that's my chap's name&mdash;help him to count it,
and then actually sent Podgers to the bank with the bag of
coin."</p>

<p>"And Podgers has been all over the place?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Saw no signs of a coining establishment?"</p>

<p>"No. It is absolutely impossible that any coining can be done
there. Besides, as I tell you, that respectable clerk brings him
the money."</p>

<p>"I suppose you want me to take Podgers's position?"</p>

<p>"Well, Monsieur Valmont, to tell you the truth, I would rather
you didn't. Podgers has done everything a man can do, but I
thought if you got into the house, Podgers assisting, you might
go through it night after night at your leisure."</p>

<p>"I see. That's just a little dangerous in England. I think I
should prefer to assure myself the legitimate standing of being
amiable Podgers's successor. You say that Summertrees has no
business?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, not what you might call a business. He is by way
of being an author, but I don't count that any business."</p>

<p>"Oh, an author, is he? When does he do his writing?"</p>

<p>"He locks himself up most of the day in his study."</p>

<p>"Does he come out for lunch?"</p>

<p>"No; he lights a little spirit lamp inside, Podgers tells me,
and makes himself a cup of coffee, which he takes with a sandwich
or two."</p>

<p>"That's rather frugal fare for Park Lane."</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur Valmont, it is, but he makes it up in the
evening, when he has a long dinner, with all them foreign
kickshaws you people like, done by his French cook."</p>

<p>"Sensible man! Well, Hale, I see I shall look forward with
pleasure to making the acquaintance of Mr. Summertrees. Is there
any restriction on the going and coming of your man Podgers?"</p>

<p>"None in the least. He can get away either night or day."</p>

<p>"Very good, friend Hale; bring him here to-morrow, as soon as
our author locks himself up in his study, or rather, I should
say, as soon as the respectable clerk leaves for Tottenham Court
Road, which I should guess, as you put it, is about half an hour
after his master turns the key of the room in which he
writes."</p>

<p>"You are quite right in that guess, Valmont. How did you hit
it?"</p>

<p>"Merely a surmise, Hale. There is a good deal of oddity about
that Park Lane house, so it doesn't surprise me in the least that
the master gets to work earlier in the morning than the man. I
have also a suspicion that Ralph Summertrees knows perfectly well
what the estimable Podgers is there for."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"I can give no reason except that my opinion of the acuteness
of Summertrees has been gradually rising all the while you were
speaking, and at the same time my estimate of Podgers's craft has
been as steadily declining. However, bring the man here
to-morrow, that I may ask him a few questions."</p>

THE STRANGE HOUSE IN PARK LANE</h2>

<p class="first">
NEXT day, about eleven o'clock, the ponderous Podgers, hat in
hand, followed his chief into my room. His broad, impassive,
immobile, smooth face gave him rather more the air of a genuine
butler than I had expected, and this appearance, of course, was
enhanced by his livery. His replies to my questions were those of
a well-trained servant who will not say too much unless it is
made worth his while. All in all, Podgers exceeded my
expectations, and really my friend Hale had some justification
for regarding him, as he evidently did, a triumph in his
line.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Hale, and you, Podgers." The man disregarded my
invitation, standing like a statue until his chief made a motion;
then he dropped into a chair. The English are great on
discipline.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Hale, I must first congratulate you on the make-up
of Podgers. It is excellent. You depend less on artificial
assistance than we do in France, and in that I think you are
right."</p>

<p>"Oh, we know a bit over here. Monsieur Valmont!" said Hale,
with pardonable pride.</p>

<p>"Now then, Podgers, I want to ask you about this clerk. What
time does he arrive in the evening?"</p>

<p>"At prompt six, sir."</p>

<p>"Does he ring, or let himself in with a latchkey?"</p>

<p>"With a latchkey, sir."</p>

<p>"How does he carry the money?"</p>

<p>"In a little locked leather satchel, sir, flung over his
shoulder."</p>

<p>"Does he go direct to the dining room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him unlock the safe, and put in the money?"
</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Does the safe unlock with a word or a key?"</p>

<p>"With a key, sir. It's one of the old-fashioned kind."</p>

<p>"Then the clerk unlocks his leather money bag?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"That's three keys used within as many minutes. Are they
separate or in a bunch?"</p>

<p>"In a bunch, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see your master with this bunch of keys?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You saw him open the safe once, I am told?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Did he use a separate key, or one of a bunch?"</p>

<p>Podgers slowly scratched his head, then said: "I don't just
remember, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, Podgers, you are neglecting the big things in that house!
Sure you can't remember?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Once the money is in and the safe locked up, what does the
clerk do?"</p>

<p>"Goes to his room, sir."</p>

<p>"Where is this room?"</p>

<p>"On the third floor, sir."</p>

<p>"Where do you sleep?"</p>

<p>"On the fourth floor with the rest of the servants, sir."</p>

<p>"Where does the master sleep?"</p>

<p>"On the second floor, adjoining his study."</p>

<p>"The house consists of four stories and a basement, does
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I have somehow arrived at the suspicion that it is a very
narrow house. Is that true?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Does the clerk ever dine with your master?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. The clerk don't eat in the house at all, sir."</p>

<p>"Does he go away before breakfast?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"No one takes breakfast to his room?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"What time does he leave the house?"</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock, sir."</p>

<p>"When is breakfast served?"</p>

<p>"At nine o'clock, sir."</p>

<p>"At what hour does your master retire to his study?"</p>

<p>"At half past nine, sir."</p>

<p>"Locks the door on the inside?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Never rings for anything during the day?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of, sir."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man is he?"</p>

<p>Here Podgers was on familiar ground, and he rattled off a
description minute in every particular.</p>

<p>"What I meant was, Podgers, is he silent, or talkative, or
does he get angry? Does he seem furtive, suspicious, anxious,
terrorized, calm, excitable, or what?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, he is by way of being very quiet, never has much
to say for hisself; never saw him angry or excited."</p>

<p>"Now, Podgers, you've been at Park Lane for a fortnight or
more. You are a sharp, alert, observant man. What happens there
that strikes you as unusual?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't exactly say, sir," replied Podgers, looking
rather helplessly from his chief to myself, and back again.</p>

<p>"Your professional duties have often compelled you to enact
the part of butler before, otherwise you wouldn't do it so well.
Isn't that the case?"</p>

<p>Podgers did not reply, but glanced at his chief. This was
evidently a question pertaining to the service, which a
subordinate was not allowed to answer. However, Hale said at
once:</p>

<p>"Certainly. Podgers has been in dozens of places."</p>

<p>"Well, Podgers, just call to mind some of the other households
where you have been employed, and tell me any particulars in
which Mr. Summertrees's establishment differs from them."</p>

<p>Podgers pondered a long time. "Well, sir, he do stick to
writing pretty close."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's his profession, you see, Podgers. Hard at it
from half past nine till toward seven, I imagine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Anything else, Podgers? No matter how trivial."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, he's fond of reading, too; leastways, he's
fond of newspapers."</p>

<p>"When does he read?"</p>

<p>"I never seen him read 'em, sir; indeed, so far as I can tell,
I never knew the papers to be opened, but he takes them all in,
sir."</p>

<p>"What, all the morning papers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and all the evening papers, too."</p>

<p>"Where are the morning papers placed?"</p>

<p>"On the table in his study, sir."</p>

<p>"And the evening papers?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, when the evening papers come, the study is locked.
They are put on a side table in the dining room, and he takes
them upstairs with him to his study."</p>

<p>"This has happened every day since you've been there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You reported that very striking fact to your chief, of
course?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I don't think I did," said Podgers con-' fused.</p>

<p>"You should have done so. Mr. Hale would have known how to
make the most of a point so vital."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Valmont," interrupted Hale, "you're chaffing
us! Plenty of people take in all the papers!"</p>

<p>"I think not. Even clubs and hotels subscribe to the leading
journals only. You said <i>all</i>, I think, Podgers?"</p>

<p>"Well, <i>nearly</i> all, sir."</p>

<p>"But which is it? There's a vast difference."</p>

<p>"He takes a good many, sir."</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"I don't just know, sir."</p>

<p>"That's easily found out, Valmont," cried Hale, with some
impatience, "if you think it really important."</p>

<p>"I think it so important that I'm going back with Podgers
myself. You can take me into the house, I suppose, when you
return?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"Coming back to these newspapers for a moment, Podgers. What
is done with them?"</p>

<p>"They are sold to the ragman, sir, once a week."</p>

<p>"Who takes them from the study?"</p>

<p>"I do, sir."</p>

<p>"Do they appear to have been read very carefully?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, sir; leastways, some of them seem never to have
been opened, or else folded up very carefully again."</p>

<p>"Did you notice that extracts have been clipped from any of
them?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Summertrees keep a scrapbook?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, the case is perfectly plain!" said I, leaning back in my
chair, and regarding the puzzled Hale with that cherubic
expression of self-satisfaction which I know is so annoying to
him.</p>

<p>"<i>What's</i> perfectly plain?" he demanded, more gruffly
perhaps than etiquette would have sanctioned.</p>

<p>"Summertrees is no coiner, nor is he linked with any band of
coiners."</p>

<p>"What is he, then?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that opens another avenue of inquiry! For all I know to
the contrary, he may be the most honest of men. On the surface it
would appear that he is a reasonably industrious tradesman in
Tottenham Court Road, who is anxious that there should be no
visible connection between a plebeian employment and so
aristocratic a residence as that in Park Lane."</p>

<p>At this point Spenser Hale gave expression to one of those
rare flashes of reason which are always an astonishment to his
friends.</p>

<p>"That is nonsense, Monsieur Valmont," he said; "the man who is
ashamed of the connection between his business and his house is
one who is trying to get into society, or else the women of his
family are trying it, as is usually the case. Now Summertrees has
no family. He himself goes nowhere, gives no entertainments, and
accepts no invitations. He belongs to no club; therefore, to say
that he is ashamed of his connection with the Tottenham Court
Road shop is absurd. He is concealing the connection for some
other reason that will bear looking into."</p>

<p>"My dear Hale, the Goddess of Wisdom herself could not have
made a more sensible series of remarks. Now, <i>mon ami</i>, do
you want my assistance, or have you enough to go on with?"</p>

<p>"Enough to go on with? We have nothing more than we had when I
called on you last night."</p>

<p>"Last night, my dear Hale, you supposed this man was in league
with coiners. To-day you know he is not."</p>

<p>"I know you <i>say</i> he is not."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders, and raised my eyebrows, smiling at
him.</p>

<p>"It is the same thing, Monsieur Hale."</p>

<p>"Well, of all the conceited&mdash;" and the good Hale could
get no farther.</p>

<p>"If you wish my assistance, it is yours."</p>

<p>"Very good. Not to put too fine a point upon it, I do."</p>

<p>"In that case, my dear Podgers, you will return to the
residence of our friend Summertrees, and get together for me in a
bundle all of yesterday's morning and evening papers that were
delivered to the house. Can you do that, or are they mixed up in
a heap in the coal cellar?"</p>

<p>"I can do it, sir. I have instructions to place each day's
papers in a pile by itself in case they should be wanted again.
There is always one week's supply in the cellar, and we sell the
papers of the week before to the ragman."</p>

<p>"Excellent. Well, take the risk of abstracting one day's
journals, and have them ready for me. I will call upon you at
half past three o'clock exactly, and then I want you to take me
upstairs to the clerk's bedroom in the third story, which I
suppose is not locked during the daytime?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, it is not."</p>

<p>With this the patient Podgers took his departure. Spenser Hale
rose when his assistant left.</p>

<p>"Anything further I can do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; give me the address of the shop in Tottenham Court Road.
Do you happen to have about you one of those new five-shilling
pieces which you believe to be illegally coined?"</p>

<p>He opened his pocketbook, took out the bit of white metal, and
handed it to me.</p>

<p>"I'm going to pass this off before evening," I said, putting
it in my pocket, "and I hope none of your men will arrest
me."</p>

<p>"That's all right," laughed Hale as he took his leave.</p>

<p>At half past three Podgers was waiting for me, and opened the
front door as I came up the steps, thus saving me the necessity
of ringing. The house seemed strangely quiet. The French cook was
evidently down in the basement, and we had probably all the upper
part to ourselves, unless Summertrees was in his study, which I
doubted. Podgers led me directly upstairs to the clerk's room on
the third floor, walking on tiptoe, with an elephantine air of
silence and secrecy combined, which struck me as unnecessary.</p>

<p>"I will make an examination of this room," I said. "Kindly
wait for me down by the door of the study."</p>

<p>The bedroom proved to be of respectable size when one
considers the smallness of the house. The bed was all nicely made
up, and there were two chairs in the room, but the usual
washstand and swing mirror were not visible. However, seeing a
curtain at the farther end of the room, I drew it aside, and
found, as I expected, a fixed lavatory in an alcove of perhaps
four feet deep by five in width. As the room was about fifteen
feet wide, this left two-thirds of the space unaccounted for. A
moment later I opened a door which exhibited a closet filled with
clothes hanging on hooks. This left a space of five feet between
the clothes closet and the lavatory. I thought at first that the
entrance to the secret stairway must have issued from the
lavatory, but examining the boards closely, although they sounded
hollow to the knuckles, they were quite evidently plain match,
boarding, and not a concealed door. The entrance to the stairway,
therefore, must issue from the clothes closet. The right-hand
wall proved similar to the match boarding of the lavatory, so far
as the casual eye or touch was concerned, but I saw at once it
was a door. The latch turned out to be somewhat ingeniously
operated by one of the hooks which held a pair of old trousers. I
found that the hook, if pressed upward, allowed the door to swing
outward, over the stairhead. Descending to the second floor, a
similar latch let me into a similar clothes closet in the room
beneath. The two rooms were identical in size, one directly above
the other, the only difference being that the lower-room door
gave into the study, instead of into the hall, as was the case
with the upper chamber.</p>

<p>The study was extremely neat, either not much used, or the
abode of a very methodical man. There was nothing on the table
except a pile of that morning's papers. I walked to the farther
end, turned the key in the lock, and came out upon the astonished
Podgers.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed!" exclaimed he.</p>

<p>"Quite so," I rejoined; "you've been tiptoeing past an empty
room for the last two weeks. Now, if you'll come with me,
Podgers, I'll show you how the trick is done."</p>

<p>When he entered the study I locked the door once more, and led
the assumed butler, still tiptoeing through force of habit, up
the stair into the top bedroom, and so out again, leaving
everything exactly as we found it. We went down the main stair to
the front hall, and there Podgers had my parcel of papers all
neatly wrapped up. This bundle I carried to my flat, gave one of
my assistants some instructions, and left him at work on the
papers.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br>

THE QUEER SHOP IN TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD</h2>

<p class="first">
I TOOK a cab to the foot of Tottenham Court Road, and walked
up that street till I came to J. Simpson's old curiosity shop.
After gazing at the well-filled windows for some time, I stepped
inside, having selected a little iron crucifix displayed behind
the pane; the work of some ancient craftsman.</p>

<p>I knew at once from Podgers's description that I was waited
upon by the veritable respectable clerk who brought the bag of
money each night to Park Lane, and who, I was certain, was no
other than Ralph Summer-trees himself.</p>

<p>There was nothing in his manner differing from that of any
other quiet salesman. The price of the crucifix proved to be
seven-and-six, and I threw down a sovereign to pay for it.</p>

<p>"Do you mind the change being all in silver, sir?" he asked,
and I answered without any eagerness, although the question
aroused a suspicion that had begun to be allayed:</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>He gave me half a crown, three two-shilling pieces, and four
separate shillings, all coins being well-worn silver of the
realm, the undoubted inartistic product of the reputable British
Mint. This seemed to dispose of the theory that he was palming
off illegitimate money. He asked me if I were interested in any
particular branch of antiquity, and I replied that my curiosity
was merely general, and exceedingly amateurish, whereupon he
invited me to look around. This I proceeded to do, while he
resumed the addressing and stamping of some wrapped-up pamphlets
which I surmised to be copies of his catalogue.</p>

<p>He made no attempt either to watch me or to press his wares
upon me. I selected at random a little inkstand, and asked its
price. It was two shillings, he said, whereupon I produced my
fraudulent five-shilling piece. He took it, gave me the change
without comment, and the last doubt about his connection with
coiners flickered from my mind.</p>

<p>At this moment a young man came in who, I saw at once, was not
a customer. He walked briskly to the farther end of the shop, and
disappeared behind a partition which had one pane of glass in it
that gave an outlook toward the front door.</p>

<p>"Excuse me a moment," said the shopkeeper, and he followed the
young man into the private office.</p>

<p>As I examined the curious heterogeneous collection of things
for sale, I heard the clink of coins being poured out on the lid
of a desk or an uncovered table, and the murmur of voices floated
out to me. I was now near the entrance of the shop, and by a
sleight-of-hand trick, keeping the corner of my eye on the glass
pane of the private office, I removed the key of the front door
without a sound, and took an impression of it in wax, returning
the key to its place unobserved. At this moment another young man
came in, and walked straight past me into the private office. I
heard him say:</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg pardon, Mr. Simpson! How are you, Rogers?"</p>

<p>"Hello, Macpherson," saluted Rogers, who then came out,
bidding good night to Mr. Simpson, and departed, whistling, down
the street, but not before he had repeated his phrase to another
young man entering, to whom he gave the name of Tyrrel.</p>

<p>I noted these three names in my mind. Two others came in
together, but I was compelled to content myself with memorizing
their features, for I did not learn their names. These men were
evidently collectors, for I heard the rattle of money in every
case; yet here was a small shop, doing apparently very little
business, for I had been within it for more than half an hour,
and yet remained the only customer. If credit were given, one
collector would certainly have been sufficient, yet five had come
in, and had poured their contributions into the pile Summertrees
was to take home with him that night.</p>

<p>I determined to secure one of the pamphlets which the man had
been addressing. They were piled on a shelf behind the counter,
but I had no difficulty in reaching across and taking the one on
top, which I slipped into my pocket. When the fifth young man
went down the street Summertrees himself emerged, and this time
he carried in his hand the well-filled locked leather satchel,
with the straps dangling. It was now approaching half past five,
and I saw he was eager to close up and get away.</p>

<p>"Anything else you fancy, sir?" he asked me.</p>

<p>"No, or, rather, yes and no. You have a very interesting
collection here, but it's getting so dark I can hardly see."</p>

<p>"I close at half past five, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! in that case," I said, consulting my watch, "I shall be
pleased to call some other time."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied Summertrees quietly, and with that I
took my leave.</p>

<p>From the corner of an alley on the other side of the street I
saw him put up the shutters with his own hands, then he emerged
with overcoat on, and the money satchel slung across his
shoulder. He locked the door, tested it with his knuckles, and
walked down the street, carrying under one arm the pamphlets he
had been addressing. I followed him at some distance, saw him
drop the pamphlets into the box at the first post office he
passed, and walk rapidly toward his house in Park Lane.</p>

<p>When I returned to my flat and called in my assistant, he
said:</p>

<p>"After putting to one side the regular advertisements of
pills, soap, and what not, here is the only one common to all
the newspapers, morning and evening alike. The advertisements
are not identical, sir, but they have two points of similarity,
or perhaps I should say three. They all profess to furnish a
cure for absent-mindedness; they all ask that the applicant's
chief hobby shall be stated, and they all bear the same address:
Dr. Willoughby, in Tottenham Court Road."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said I, as he placed the scissored advertisements
before me.</p>

<p>I read several of the announcements. They were all small, and
perhaps that is why I had never noticed one of them in the
newspapers, for certainly they were odd enough. Some asked for
lists of absent-minded men, with the hobbies of each, and for
these lists, prizes of from one shilling to six were offered. In
other clippings Dr. Willoughby professed to be able to cure
absent-mindedness. There were no fees and no treatment, but a
pamphlet would be sent, which, if it did not benefit the
receiver, could do no harm. The doctor was unable to meet
patients personally, nor could he enter into correspondence with
them. The address was the same as that of the old curiosity shop
in Tottenham Court Road. At this juncture I pulled the pamphlet
from my pocket, and saw it was entitled, "Christian Science and
Absent-Mindedness," by Dr. Stamford Willoughby, and at the end of
the article was the statement contained in the advertisements,
that Dr. Willoughby would neither see patients nor hold any
correspondence with them.</p>

<p>I drew a sheet of paper toward me, wrote to Dr. Willoughby,
alleging that I was a very absent-minded man, and would be glad
of his pamphlet, adding that my special hobby was the collecting
of first editions.</p>

<p>I then signed myself, <i>"Alport Webster, Imperial Flats,
London, W."</i></p>

<p>I may here explain that it is often necessary for me to see
people under some other name than the well-known appellation of
Eugène Valmont. There are two doors to my flat, and on one of
these is painted, "Eugène Valmont"; on the other there is a
receptacle, into which can be slipped a sliding panel bearing any
<i>nom de guerre</i> I choose. The same device is arranged on the
ground floor, where the names of all the occupants of the
building appear on the right-hand wall.</p>

<p>I sealed, addressed, and stamped my letter, then told my man
to put out the name of Alport Webster, and if I did not happen to
be in when anyone called upon that mythical person, he was to
make an appointment for me.</p>

<p>It was nearly six o'clock next afternoon when the card of
Angus Macpherson was brought in to Mr. Alport Webster. I
recognized the young man at once as the second who had entered
the little shop, carrying his tribute to Mr. Simpson the day
before. He held three volumes under his arm, and spoke in such a
pleasant, insinuating sort of way, that I knew at once he was an
adept in his profession of canvasser.</p>

<p>"Will you be seated, Mr. Macpherson? In what can I serve
you?"</p>

<p>He placed the three volumes, backs upward, on my table.</p>

<p>"Are you interested at all in first editions, Mr.
Webster?"</p>

<p>"It is the one thing I am interested in," I replied; "but
unfortunately they often run into a lot of money."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Macpherson sympathetically, "and I have
here three books, one of which is an exemplification of what you
say. This one costs a hundred pounds. The last copy that was sold
by auction in London brought a hundred and twenty-three pounds.
This next one is forty pounds, and the third ten pounds. At these
prices I am certain you could not duplicate three such treasures
in any bookshop in Britain."</p>

<p>I examined them critically, and saw at once that what he said
was true. He was still standing on the opposite side of the
table.</p>

<p>"Please take a chair, Mr. Macpherson. Do you mean to say you
go round London with a hundred and fifty pounds' worth of goods
under your arm in this careless way?"</p>

<p>The young man laughed.</p>

<p>"I run very little risk, Mr. Webster. I don't suppose anyone I
meet imagines for a moment there is more under my arm than
perhaps a trio of volumes I have picked up in the fourpenny box
to take home with me."</p>

<p>I lingered over the volume for which he asked a hundred
pounds, then said, looking across at him:</p>

<p>"How came you to be possessed of this book, for instance?"</p>

<p>He turned upon me a fine, open countenance, and answered
without hesitation in the frankest possible manner:</p>

<p>"I am not in actual possession of it, Mr. Webster. I am by way
of being a connoisseur in rare and valuable books myself,
although, of course, I have little money with which to indulge in
the collection of them. I am acquainted, however, with the lovers
of desirable books in different quarters of London. These three
volumes, for instance, are from the library of a private
gentleman in the West End. I have sold many books to him, and he
knows I am trustworthy. He wishes to dispose of them at something
under their real value, and has kindly allowed me to conduct the
negotiations. I make it my business to find out those who are
interested in rare books, and by such trading I add considerably
to my income."</p>

<p>"How, for instance, did you learn that I was a
bibliophile?"</p>

<p>Mr. Macpherson laughed genially.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Webster, I must confess that I chanced it. I do
that very often. I take a flat like this, and send in my card to
the name on the door. If I am invited in, I ask the occupant the
question I asked you just now: 'Are you interested in rare
editions?' If he says no, I simply beg pardon and retire. If he
says yes, then I show my wares."</p>

<p>"I see," said I, nodding. What a glib young liar he was, with
that innocent face of his, and yet my next question brought forth
the truth.</p>

<p>"As this is the first time you have called upon me, Mr.
Macpherson, you have no objection to my making some further
inquiry, I suppose. Would you mind telling me the name of the
owner of these books in the West End?"</p>

<p>"His name is Mr. Ralph Summertrees, of Park Lane."</p>

<p>"Of Park Lane? Ah, indeed!"</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to leave the books with you, Mr. Webster, and
if you care to make an appointment with Mr. Summertrees, I am
sure he will not object to say a word in my favor."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do not in the least doubt it, and should not think of
troubling the gentleman."</p>

<p>"I was going to tell you," went on the young man, "that I have
a friend, a capitalist, who, in a way, is my supporter; for, as I
said, I have little money of my own. I find it is often
inconvenient for people to pay down any considerable sum. When,
however, I strike a bargain, my capitalist buys the books, and I
make an arrangement with my customer to pay a certain amount each
week, and so even a large purchase is not felt, as I make the
installments small enough to suit my client."</p>

<p>"You are employed during the day, I take it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am a clerk in the City."</p>

<p>Again we were in the blissful realms of fiction!</p>

<p>"Suppose I take this book at ten pounds, what installments
should I have to pay each week?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what you like, sir. Would five shillings be too
much?"</p>

<p>"I think not."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir; if you pay me five shillings now, I will
leave the book with you, and shall have pleasure in calling this
day week for the next installment."</p>

<p>I put my hand into my pocket, and drew out two half crowns,
which I passed over to him.</p>

<p>"Do I need to sign any form or undertaking to pay the
rest?"</p>

<p>The young man laughed cordially.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir, there is no formality necessary. You see, sir,
this is largely a labor of love with me, although I don't deny I
have my eye on the future. I am getting together what I hope will
be a very valuable connection with gentlemen like yourself who
are fond of books, and I trust some day that I may be able to
resign my place with the insurance company and set up a choice
little business of my own, where my knowledge of values in
literature will prove useful."</p>

<p>And then, after making a note in a little book he took from
his pocket, he bade me a most graceful good-by and departed,
leaving me cogitating over what it all meant.</p>

<p>Next morning two articles were handed to me. The first came by
post and was a pamphlet on "Christian Science and
Absent-Mindedness," exactly similar to the one I had taken away
from the old curiosity shop; the second was a small key made from
my wax impression that would fit the front door of the same
shop&mdash;a key fashioned by an excellent anarchist friend of
mine in an obscure street near Holborn.</p>

<p>That night at ten o'clock I was inside the old curiosity shop,
with a small storage battery in my pocket, and a little electric
glowlamp at my buttonhole, a most useful instrument for either
burglar or detective.</p>

<p>I had expected to find the books of the establishment in a
safe, which, if it was similar to the one in Park Lane, I was
prepared to open with the false keys in my possession, or to take
an impression of the keyhole and trust to my anarchist friend for
the rest. But to my amazement I discovered all the papers
pertaining to the concern in a desk which was not even locked.
The books, three in number, were the ordinary daybook, journal,
and ledger referring to the shop; bookkeeping of the older
fashion; but in a portfolio lay half a dozen foolscap sheets,
headed, "Mr. Rogers's List," "Mr. Macpherson's," "Mr.
Tyrrel's," the names I had already learned, and three others.
These lists contained in the first column, names; in the second
column, addresses; in the third, sums of money; and then in the
small, square places following were amounts ranging from
two-and-sixpence to a pound. At the bottom of Mr. Macpherson's
list was the name Alport Webster, Imperial Flats, £10; then in
the small, square place, five shillings. These six sheets, each
headed by a canvasser's name, were evidently the record of
current collections, and the innocence of the whole thing was so
apparent that, if it were not for my fixed rule never to believe
that I am at the bottom of any case until I have come on
something suspicious, I would have gone out empty-handed as I
came in.</p>

<p>The six sheets were loose in a thin portfolio, but standing on
a shelf above the desk were a number of fat volumes, one of which
I took down, and saw that it contained similar lists running back
several years. I noticed on Mr. Macpherson's current list the
name of Lord Semptam, an eccentric old nobleman whom I knew
slightly. Then turning to the list immediately before the current
one the name was still there; I traced it back through list after
list until I found the first entry, which was no less than three
years previous, and there Lord Semptam was down for a piece of
furniture costing fifty pounds, and on that account he had paid a
pound a week for more than three years, totaling a hundred and
seventy pounds at the least, and instantly the glorious
simplicity of the scheme dawned upon me, and I became so
interested in the swindle that I lit the gas, fearing my little
lamp would be exhausted before my investigation ended, for it
promised to be a long one.</p>

<p>In several instances the intended victim proved shrewder than
old Simpson had counted upon, and the word "Settled" had been
written on the line carrying the name when the exact number of
installments was paid. But as these shrewd persons dropped out,
others took their places, and Simpson's dependence on their
absent-mindedness seemed to be justified in nine cases out of
ten. His collectors were collecting long after the debt had been
paid. In Lord Semptam's case, the payment had evidently become
chronic, and the old man was giving away his pound a week to the
suave Macpherson two years after his debt had been
liquidated.</p>

<p>From the big volume I detached the loose leaf, dated 1893,
which recorded Lord Semptam's purchase of a carved table for
fifty pounds, and on which he had been paying a pound a week from
that time to the date of which I am writing, which was November,
1896. This single document, taken from the file of three years
previous, was not likely to be missed, as would have been the
case if I had selected a current sheet. I nevertheless made a
copy of the names and addresses of Macpherson's present clients;
then, carefully placing everything exactly as I had found it, I
extinguished the gas, and went out of the shop, locking the door
behind me. With the 1893 sheet in my pocket I resolved to prepare
a pleasant little surprise for my suave friend Macpherson when he
called to get his next installment of five shillings.</p>

<p>Late as was the hour when I reached Trafalgar Square, I could
not deprive myself of the felicity of calling on Mr. Spenser
Hale, who I knew was then on duty. He never appeared at his best
during office hours, because officialism stiffened his stalwart
frame. Mentally he was impressed with the importance of his
position, and added to this he was not then allowed to smoke his
big black pipe and terrible tobacco. He received me with the
curtness I had been taught to expect when I inflicted myself upon
him at his office. He greeted me abruptly with:</p>

<p>"I say, Valmont, how long do you expect to be on this
job?"</p>

<p>"What job?" I asked mildly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know what I mean: the Summertrees affair?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i>!" I exclaimed, with surprise. "The
Summertrees case is already completed, of course. If I had known
you were in a hurry, I should have finished up everything
yesterday, but as you and Podgers, and I don't know how many
more, have been at it sixteen or seventeen days, if not longer, I
thought I might venture to take as many hours, as I am working
entirely alone. You said nothing about haste, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Valmont, that's a bit thick. Do you mean to say
you have already got evidence against the man?"</p>

<p>"Evidence absolute and complete."</p>

<p>"Then who are the coiners?"</p>

<p>"My most estimable friend, how often have I told you not to
jump at conclusions? I informed you when you first spoke to me
about the matter that Summer-trees was neither a coiner nor a
confederate of coiners. I secured evidence sufficient to convict
him of quite another offense, which is probably unique in the
annals of crime. I have penetrated the mystery of the shop, and
discovered the reason for all those suspicious actions which
quite properly set you on his trail. Now I wish you to come to my
flat next Wednesday night at a quarter to six, prepared to make
an arrest."</p>

<p>"I must know whom I am to arrest, and on what counts."</p>

<p>"Quite so, <i>mon ami</i> Hale; I did not say you were to make
an arrest, but merely warned you to be prepared. If you have time
now to listen to the disclosures, I am quite at your service. I
promise you there are some original features in the case. If,
however, the present moment is inopportune, drop in on me at your
convenience, previously telephoning so that you may know whether
I am there or not, and thus your valuable time will not be
expended purposelessly."</p>

<p>With this I presented to him my most courteous bow, and
although his mystified expression hinted a suspicion that he
thought I was chaffing him, as he would call it, official dignity
dissolved somewhat, and he intimated his desire to hear all about
it then and there. I had succeeded in arousing my friend Hale's
curiosity. He listened to the evidence with perplexed brow, and
at last ejaculated he would be blessed.</p>

<p>"This young man," I said, in conclusion, "will call upon me at
six on Wednesday afternoon, to receive his second five shillings.
I propose that you, in your uniform, shall be seated there with
me to receive him, and I am anxious to study Mr. Macpherson's
countenance when he realizes he has walked in to confront a
policeman. If you will then allow me to cross-examine him for a
few moments, not after the manner of Scotland Yard, with a
warning lest he incriminate himself, but in the free and easy
fashion we adopt in Paris, I shall afterwards turn the case over
to you to be dealt with at your discretion."</p>

<p>"You have a wonderful flow of language, Monsieur Valmont," was
the officer's tribute to me. "I shall be on hand at a quarter to
six on Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," said I, "kindly say nothing of this to anyone. We
must arrange a complete surprise for Macpherson. That is
essential. Please make no move in the matter at all until
Wednesday night."</p>

<p>Spenser Hale, much impressed, nodded acquiescence, and I took
a polite leave of him.</p>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br>

THE ABSENT-MINDED COTERIE</h2>

<p class="first">
THE question of lighting is an important one in a room such as
mine, and electricity offers a good deal of scope to the
ingenious. Of this fact I have taken full advantage. I can
manipulate the lighting of my room so that any particular spot is
bathed in brilliancy, while the rest of the space remains in
comparative gloom, and I arranged the lamps so that the full
force of their rays impinged against the door that Wednesday
evening, while I sat on one side of the table in semidarkness and
Hale sat on the other, with a light beating down on him from
above which gave him the odd, sculptured look of a living statue
of Justice, stern and triumphant. Anyone entering the room would
first be dazzled by the light, and next would see the gigantic
form of Hale in the full uniform of his order.</p>

<p>When Angus Macpherson was shown into this room, he was quite
visibly taken aback, and paused abruptly on the threshold, his
gaze riveted on the huge policeman. I think his first purpose was
to turn and run, but the door closed behind him, and he doubtless
heard, as we all did, the sound of the bolt being thrust in its
place, thus locking him in.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon," he stammered, "I expected to meet
Mr. Webster."</p>

<p>As he said this, I pressed the button under my table, and was
instantly enshrouded with light. A sickly smile overspread the
countenance of Macpherson as he caught sight of me, and he made a
very creditable attempt to carry off the situation with
nonchalance.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are, Mr. Webster; I did not notice you at
first."</p>

<p>It was a tense moment. I spoke slowly and impressively.</p>

<p>"Sir, perhaps you are not unacquainted with the name of Eugène
Valmont." He replied brazenly:</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say, sir, I never heard of the gentleman
before."</p>

<p>At this came a most inopportune "Haw-haw" from that
blockhead Spenser Hale, completely spoiling the dramatic
situation I had elaborated with such thought and care. It is
little wonder the English possess no drama, for they show scant
appreciation of the sensational moments in life; they are not
quickly alive to the lights and shadows of events.</p>

<p>"Haw-haw," brayed Spenser Hale, and at once reduced the
emotional atmosphere to a fog of commonplace. However, what is a
man to do? He must handle the tools with which it pleases
Providence to provide him. I ignored Hale's untimely
laughter.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sir," I said to Macpherson, and he obeyed.</p>

<p>"You have called on Lord Semptam this week," I continued
sternly. </p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And collected a pound from him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"In October, 1893, you sold Lord Semptam a carved antique
table for fifty pounds?"</p>

<p>"Quite right, sir." </p>

<p>"When you were here last week you gave me Ralph Summertrees as
the name of a gentleman living in Park Lane. You knew at the time
that this man was your employer?"</p>

<p>Macpherson was now looking fixedly at me, and on this occasion
made no reply. I went on calmly:</p>

<p>"You also knew that Summertrees, of Park Lane, was identical
with Simpson, of Tottenham Court Road?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Macpherson, "I don't exactly see what you're
driving at, but it's quite usual for a man to carry on a business
under an assumed name. There is nothing illegal about that."</p>

<p>"We will come to the illegality in a moment, Mr. Macpherson.
You and Rogers and Tyrrel and three others are confederates of
this man Simpson."</p>

<p>"We are in his employ; yes, sir, but no more confederates than
clerks usually are."</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Macpherson, I have said enough to show you that
the game is what you call up. You are now in the presence of Mr.
Spenser Hale, from Scotland Yard, who is waiting to hear your
confession."</p>

<p>Here the stupid Hale broke in with his:</p>

<p>"And remember, sir, that anything you say will</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Hale," I interrupted hastily, "I shall turn
over the case to you in a very few moments, but I ask you to
remember our compact, and to leave it for the present entirely in
my hands. Now, Mr. Macpherson, I want your confession, and I want
it at once."</p>

<p>"Confession? Confederates?" protested Macpherson, with
admirably simulated surprise. "I must say you use extraordinary
terms, Mr.&mdash; Mr.&mdash; What did you say the name was?"</p>

<p>"Haw-haw," roared Hale. "His name is Monsieur Valmont."</p>

<p>"I implore you, Mr. Hale, to leave this man to me for a very
few moments. Now, Macpherson, what have you to say in your
defense?"</p>

<p>"Where nothing criminal has been alleged, Monsieur Valmont, I
see no necessity for defense. If you wish me to admit that
somehow you have acquired a number of details regarding our
business, I am perfectly willing to do so, and to subscribe to
their accuracy. If you will be good enough to let me know of what
you complain, I shall endeavor to make the point clear to you, if
I can. There has evidently been some misapprehension, but for the
life of me, without further explanation, I am as much in a fog as
I was on my way coming here, for it is getting a little thick
outside."</p>

<p>Macpherson certainly was conducting himself with great
discretion, and presented, quite unconsciously, a much more
diplomatic figure than my friend Spenser Hale, sitting stiffly
opposite me. His tone was one of mild expostulation, mitigated by
the intimation that all misunderstanding speedily would be
cleared away. To outward view he offered a perfect picture of
innocence, neither protesting too much nor too little. I had,
however, another surprise in store for him, a trump card, as it
were, and I played it down on the table.</p>

<p>"There!" I cried with vim, "have you ever seen that sheet
before?"</p>

<p>He glanced at it without offering to take it in his hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said, "that has been abstracted from our file.
It is what I call my visiting list."</p>

<p>"Come, come, sir," I cried sternly, "you refuse to confess,
but I warn you we know all about it. You never heard of Dr.
Willoughby, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is the author of the silly pamphlet on Christian
Science."</p>

<p>"You are in the right, Mr. Macpherson; on Christian Science
and Absent-Mindedness."</p>

<p>"Possibly. I haven't read it for a long while."</p>

<p>"Have you ever met this learned doctor, Mr. Macpherson?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Dr. Willoughby is the pen name of Mr. Summertrees.
He believes in Christian Science and that sort of thing, and
writes about it."</p>

<p>"Ah, really. We are getting your confession bit by bit, Mr.
Macpherson. I think it would be better to be quite frank with
us."</p>

<p>"I was just going to make the same suggestion to you, Monsieur
Valmont. If you will tell me in a few words exactly what is your
charge against either Mr. Summertrees or myself, I will know then
what to say."</p>

<p>"We charge you, sir, with obtaining money under false
pretenses, which is a crime that has landed more than one
distinguished financier in prison."</p>

<p>Spenser Hale shook his fat forefinger at me, and said:</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, Valmont; we mustn't threaten, we mustn't threaten,
you know "; but I went on without heeding him.</p>

<p>"Take, for instance, Lord Semptam. You sold him a table for
fifty pounds, on the installment plan. He was to pay a pound a
week, and in less than a year the debt was liquidated. But he is
an absent-minded man, as all your clients are. That is why you
came to me. I had answered the bogus Willoughby's advertisement.
And so you kept on collecting and collecting for something more
than three years. Now do you understand the charge?"</p>

<p>Mr. Macpherson's head, during this accusation, was held
slightly inclined to one side. At first his face was clouded by
the most clever imitation of anxious concentration of mind I had
ever seen, and this was gradually cleared away by the dawn of
awakening perception. When I had finished, an ingratiating smile
hovered about his lips.</p>

<p>"Really, you know," he said, "that is rather a capital scheme.
The absent-minded league, as one might call them. Most ingenious<
Summertrees, if he had any sense of humor, which he hasn't, would
be rather taken by the idea that his innocent fad for Christian
Science had led him to be suspected of obtaining money under
false pretenses. But, really, there are no pretensions about the
matter at all. As I understand it, I simply call and receive the
money through the forgetfulness of the persons on my list, but
where I think you would have both Summertrees and myself, if
there was anything in your audacious theory, would be an
indictment for conspiracy. Still, I quite see how the mistake
arises. You have jumped to the conclusion that we sold nothing to
Lord Semptam except that carved table three years ago. I have
pleasure in pointing out to you that his lordship is a frequent
customer of ours, and has had many things from us at one time or
another. Sometimes he is in our debt; sometimes we are in his. We
keep a sort of running contract with him by which he pays us a
pound a week. He and several other customers deal on the same
plan, and in return, for an income that we can count upon, they
get the first offer of anything in which they are supposed to be
interested. As I have told you, we call these sheets in the
office our visiting lists, but to make the visiting lists
complete you need what we term our encyclopedia. We call it that
because it is in so many volumes; a volume for each year, running
back I don't know how long. You will notice little figures here
from time to time above the amount stated on this visiting list.
These figures refer to the page of the encyclopedia for the
current year, and on that page is noted the new sale and the
amount of it, as it might be set down, say, in a ledger."</p>

<p>"That is a very entertaining explanation, Mr. Mac-pherson. I
suppose this encyclopedia, as you call it, is in the shop at
Tottenham Court Road?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. Each volume of the encyclopedia is self-locking.
These books contain the real secret of our business, and they are
kept in the safe at Mr. Sum-mertrees's house in Park Lane. Take
Lord Semptam's account, for instance. You will find in faint
figures under a certain date, 102. If you turn to page 102 of the
encyclopedia for that year, you will then see a list of what Lord
Semptam has bought, and the prices he was charged for them. It is
really a very simple matter. If you will allow me to use your
telephone for a moment, I will ask Mr. Summertrees, who has not
yet begun dinner, to bring with him here the volume for 1893, and
within a quarter of an hour you will be perfectly satisfied that
everything is quite legitimate."</p>

<p>I confess that the young man's naturalness and confidence
staggered me, the more so as I saw by the sarcastic smile on
Hale's lips that he did not believe a single word spoken. A
portable telephone stood on the table, and as Macpherson finished
his explanation, he reached over and drew it toward him. Then
Spenser Hale interfered.</p>

<p>"Excuse <i>me</i>," he said, "I'll do the telephoning. What is
the call number of Mr. Summertrees?"</p>

<p>"One forty Hyde Park."</p>

<p>Hale at once called up Central, and presently was answered
from Park Lane. We heard him say:</p>

<p>"Is this the residence of Mr. Summertrees? Oh, is that you,
Podgers? Is Mr. Summertrees in? Very well. This is Hale. I am in
Valmont's flat&mdash;Imperial Flats&mdash;you know. Yes, where
you went with me the other day. Very well, go to Mr. Summertrees,
and say to him that Mr. Macpherson wants the encyclopedia for
1893. Do you get that? Yes, encyclopedia. Oh, don't understand
what it is. Mr. Macpherson. No, don't mention my name at all.
Just say Mr. Macpherson wants the encyclopedia for the year 1893,
and that you are to bring it. Yes, you may tell him that Mr.
Macpherson is at Imperial Flats, but don't mention my name at
all. Exactly. As soon as he gives you the book, get into a cab,
and come here as quickly as possible with it. If Summertrees
doesn't want to let the book go, then tell him to come with you.
If he won't do that, place him under arrest, and bring both him
and the book here. All right. Be as quick as you can; we're
waiting."</p>

<p>Macpherson made no protest against Hale's use of the
telephone; he merely sat back in his chair with a resigned
expression on his face which, if painted on canvas, might have
been entitled, "The Falsely Accused." When Hale rang off,
Macpherson said:</p>

<p>"Of course you know your own business best, but if your man
arrests Summertrees, he will make you the laughingstock of
London. There is such a thing as unjustifiable arrest, as well as
getting money under false pretenses, and Mr. Summertrees is not
the man to forgive an insult. And then, if you will allow me to
say so, the more I think over your absent-minded theory, the more
absolutely grotesque it seems, and if the case ever gets into the
newspapers, I am sure, Mr. Hale, you'll experience an
uncomfortable half hour with your chiefs at Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"I'll take the risk of that, thank you," said Hale
stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Am I to consider myself under arrest?" inquired the young
man. "No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then, if you will pardon me, I shall withdraw. Mr.
Summertrees will show you everything you wish to see in his
books, and can explain his business much more capably than I,
because he knows more about it; therefore, gentlemen, I bid you
good night."</p>

<p>"No you don't. Not just yet awhile," exclaimed Hale, rising to
his feet simultaneously with the young man.</p>

<p>"Then I <i>am</i> under arrest," protested Macpherson.</p>

<p>"You're not going to leave this room until Podgers brings that
book."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," and he sat down again.</p>

<p>And now, as talking is dry work, I set out something to drink,
a box of cigars, and a box of cigarettes. Hale mixed his favorite
brew, but Macpherson, shunning the wine of his country, contented
himself with a glass of plain mineral water, and lit a cigarette.
Then he awoke my high regard by saying pleasantly, as if nothing
had happened:</p>

<p>"While we are waiting, Monsieur Valmont, may I remind you that
you owe me five shillings?"</p>

<p>I laughed, took the coin from my pocket, and paid him,
whereupon he thanked me.</p>

<p>"Are you connected with Scotland Yard, Monsieur Valmont?"
asked Macpherson, with the air of a man trying to make
conversation to bridge over a tedious interval;  but before I
could reply Hale blurted out:</p>

<p>"Not likely!"</p>

<p>"You have no official standing as a detective, then, Monsieur
Valmont?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," I replied quickly, thus getting in my oar
ahead of Hale.</p>

<p>"That is a loss to our country," pursued this admirable young
man, with evident sincerity.</p>

<p>I began to see I could make a good deal of so clever a fellow
if he came under my tuition.</p>

<p>"The blunders of our police," he went on, "are something
deplorable. If they would but take lessons in strategy, say, from
France, their unpleasant duties would be so much more acceptably
performed, with much less discomfort to their victims."</p>

<p>"France," snorted Hale in derision, "why, they call a man
guilty there until he's proven innocent."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Hale, and the same seems to be the case in Imperial
Flats. You have quite made up your mind that Mr. Summertrees is
guilty, and will not be content until he proves his innocence. I
venture to predict that you will hear from him before long in a
manner that may astonish you."</p>

<p>Hale grunted and looked at his watch. The minutes passed very
slowly as we sat there smoking and at last even I began to get
uneasy. Macpherson, seeing our anxiety, said that when he came in
the fog was almost as thick as it had been the week before, and
that there might be some difficulty in getting a cab. Just as he
was speaking the door was unlocked from the outside, and Podgers
entered, bearing a thick volume in his hand. This he gave to his
superior, who turned over its pages in amazement, and then looked
at the back, crying:</p>

<p>"'Encyclopedia of Sport, 1893'! What sort of a joke is this,
Mr. Macpherson?"</p>

<p>There was a pained look on Mr. Macpherson's face as he reached
forward and took the book. He said with a sigh:</p>

<p>"If you had allowed me to telephone, Mr. Hale, I should have
made it perfectly plain to Summertrees what was wanted. I might
have known this mistake was liable to occur. There is an
increasing demand for out-of-date books of sport, and no doubt
Mr. Summertrees thought this was what I meant. There is nothing
for it but to send your man back to Park Lane and tell Mr.
Summertrees that what we want is the locked volume of accounts
for 1893, which we call the encyclopedia. Allow me to write an
order that will bring it. Oh, I'll show you what I have written
before your man takes it," he said, as Hale stood ready to look
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>On my note paper he dashed off a request such as he had
outlined, and handed it to Hale, who read it and gave it to
Podgers.</p>

<p>"Take that to Summertrees, and get back as quickly as
possible. Have you a cab at the door?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Is it foggy outside?"</p>

<p>"Not so much, sir, as it was an hour ago. No difficulty about
the traffic now, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well, get back as soon as you can."</p>

<p>Podgers saluted, and left with the book under his arm. Again
the door was locked, and again we sat smoking in silence until
the stillness was broken by the tinkle of the telephone. Hale put
the receiver to his ear.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is the Imperial Flats. Yes. Valmont. Oh, yes;
Macpherson is here. What? Out of what? Can't hear you. Out of
print. What, the encyclopedia's out of print? Who is that
speaking? Dr. Willoughby; thanks."</p>

<p>Macpherson rose as if he would go to the telephone, but
instead (and he acted so quietly that I did not notice what he
was doing until the thing was done) he picked up the sheet which
he called his visiting list, and walking quite without haste,
held it in the glowing coals of the fireplace until it
disappeared in a flash of flame up the chimney. I sprang to my
feet indignant, but too late to make even a motion toward saving
the sheet. Macpherson regarded us both with that self-deprecatory
smile which had several times lighted up his face.</p>

<p>"How dared you burn that sheet?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Because, Monsieur Valmont, it did not belong to you; because
you do not belong to Scotland Yard; because you stole it; because
you had no right to it; and because you have no official standing
in this country. If it had been in Mr. Hale's possession I should
not have dared, as you put it, to destroy the sheet, but as this
sheet was abstracted from my master's premises by you, an
entirely unauthorized person, whom he would have been justified
in shooting dead if he had found you housebreaking, and you had
resisted him on his discovery, I took the liberty of destroying
the document. I have always held that these sheets should not
have been kept, for, as has been the case, if they fell under the
scrutiny of so intelligent a person as Eugène Valmont, improper
inferences might have been drawn. Mr. Summertrees, however,
persisted in keeping them, but made this concession, that if I
ever telegraphed him or telephoned him the word 'Encyclopedia,'
he would at once burn these records, and he, on his part, was to
telegraph or telephone to me 'The encyclopedia is out of print,'
whereupon I would know that he had succeeded.</p>

<br>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, open this door, which will save me the
trouble of forcing it. Either put me formally under arrest, or
cease to restrict my liberty. I am very much obliged to Mr. Hale
for telephoning, and I have made no protest to so gallant a host
as Monsieur Valmont is, because of the locked door. However, the
farce is now terminated. The proceedings I have sat through were
entirely illegal, and if you will pardon me, Mr. Hale, they have
been a little too French to go down here in old England, or to
make a report in the newspapers that would be quite satisfactory
to your chiefs. I demand either my formal arrest of the unlocking
of that door."</p>

<p>In silence I pressed a button, and my man threw open the door.
Macpherson walked to the threshold, paused, and looked back at
Spenser Hale, who sat there silent as a sphinx.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Hale."</p>

<p>There being no reply, he turned to me with the same
ingratiating smile:</p>

<p>"Good evening, Monsieur Eugène Valmont," he said. "I shall
give myself the pleasure of calling next Wednesday at six for my
five shillings."</p>

THE SAD CASE OF SOPHIA BROOKS</h2>

<p class="first">
CELEBRATED critics have written with scorn of what they call
"the long arm of coincidence" in fiction. Coincidence is supposed
to be the device of a novelist who does not possess ingenuity
enough to construct a book without it. In France our incomparable
writers pay no attention to this, because they are gifted with a
keener insight into real life than is the case with the British.
The superb Charles Dickens, possibly as well known in France as
he is wherever the English language is read, and who loved French
soil and the French people, probably probed deeper into the
intricacies of human character than any other novelist of modern
times, and if you read his works, you will see that he
continually makes use of coincidence. The experience that has
come to me throughout my own strange and varied career convinces
me that coincidence happens in real life with exceeding
frequency, and this fact is especially borne in upon me when I
set out to relate my conflict with the Rantremly ghost, which
wrought startling changes upon the lives of two people, one an
objectionable, domineering man, and the other a humble and
crushed woman. Of course, there was a third person, and the
consequences that came to him were the most striking of all, as
you will learn, if you do me the honor to read this account of
the episode.</p>

<p>So far as coincidence is concerned, there was first the
arrival of the newspaper clipping, then the coming of Sophia
Brooks; and when that much-injured woman left my flat I wrote
down this sentence on a sheet of paper:</p>

<p>"Before the week is out, I predict that Lord Rantremly himself
will call to see me."</p>

<p>Next day my servant brought in the card of Lord Rantremly.</p>

<p>I must begin with the visit of Sophia Brooks, for though that
comes second, yet I had paid no attention in particular to the
newspaper clipping until the lady told her story. My man brought
me a typewritten sheet of paper on which were inscribed the
words:</p>

<br>

<p class="card" style="font-size:1.1em">
SOPHIA BROOKS,<br>
Typewriting and Translating Office,<br>
First Floor,<br>
No. 51, Beaumont Street,<br>
Strand,<br>
London, W.C.</p>

<p>I said to my servant:</p>

<p>"Tell the lady as kindly as possible that I have no
typewriting work to give out and that in fact I keep a
stenographer and typewriting machine on the premises."</p>

<p>A few moments later my man returned, and said the lady wished
to see me, not about typewriting, but regarding a case in which
she hoped to interest me. I was still in some hesitation about
admitting her, for my transactions had now risen to a higher
plane than when I was new to London. My expenses were naturally
very heavy, and it was not possible for me, in justice to myself,
to waste time in commissions from the poor, which even if they
resulted successfully meant little money added to my banking
account, and often nothing at all, because the client was unable
to pay. As I remarked before, I possess a heart the most tender,
and therefore must, greatly to my grief, steel myself against the
enlisting of my sympathy, which, alas! has frequently led to my
financial loss. Still, sometimes the apparently poor are involved
in matters of extreme importance, and England is so eccentric a
country that one may find himself at fault if he closes his door
too harshly. Indeed, ever since my servant, in the utmost good
faith, threw downstairs the persistent and tattered beggarman,
who he learned later to his sorrow was actually his grace the
Duke of Ventnor, I have always cautioned my subordinates not to
judge too hastily from appearances.</p>

<p>"Show the lady in," I said, and there came to me, hesitating,
backward, abashed, a middle-aged woman, dressed with distressing
plainness, when one thinks of the charming costumes to be seen on
a Parisian boulevard. Her subdued manner was that of one to whom
the world had been cruel. I rose, bowed profoundly, and placed a
chair at her disposal, with the air I should have used if my
caller had been a royal princess. I claim no credit for this; it
is of my nature. There you behold Eugène Valmont. My visitor was
a woman. <i>Voila!</i></p>

<p>"Madam," I said politely, "in what may I have the pleasure of
serving you?"</p>

<p>The poor woman seemed for the moment confused, and was, I
feared, on the verge of tears, but at last she spoke, and
said:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have read in the newspapers of the tragedy at
Rantremly Castle?"</p>

<p>"The name, madam, remains in my memory, associated elusively
with some hint of seriousness. Will you pardon me a moment?" and
a vague thought that I had seen the castle mentioned either in a
newspaper, or a clipping from one, caused me to pick up the
latest bunch which had come from my agent. I am imbued with no
vanity at all; still it is amusing to note what the newspapers
say of one, and therefore I have subscribed to a clipping agency.
In fact, I indulge in two subscriptions&mdash;one personal; the
other calling for any pronouncement pertaining to the differences
between England and France; for it is my determination yet to
write a book on the comparative characteristics of the two
people. I hold a theory that the English people are utterly
incomprehensible to the rest of humanity, and this will be duly
set out in my forthcoming volume.</p>

<p>I speedily found the clipping I was in search of. It proved to
be a letter to the <i>Times</i>, and was headed: "Proposed
Destruction of Rantremly Castle." The letter went on to say that
this edifice was one of the most noted examples of Norman
architecture in the north of England; that Charles II had hidden
there for some days after his disastrous defeat at Worcester.
Part of the castle had been battered down by Cromwell, and later
it again proved the refuge of a Stuart when the Pretender made it
a temporary place of concealment. The new Lord Rantremly, it
seemed, had determined to demolish this ancient stronghold, so
interesting architecturally and historically, and to build with
its stones a modern residence. Against this act of vandalism the
writer strongly protested, and suggested that England should
acquire the power which France constantly exerts, in making an
historical monument of an edifice so interwoven with the fortunes
of the country.</p>

<p>"Well, madam," I said, "all this extract alludes to is the
coming demolition of Rantremly Castle. Is that the tragedy of
which you speak?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she exclaimed; "I mean the death of the eleventh
Lord Rantremly about six weeks ago. For ten years Lord Rantremly
lived practically alone in the castle. Servants would not remain
there because the place was haunted, and well it may be, for a
terrible family the Rantremlys have been, and a cruel, as I shall
be able to tell you. Up to a month and a half ago Lord Rantremly
was waited on by a butler older than himself, and, if possible,
more wicked. One morning this old butler came up the stairs from
the kitchen with Lord Rantremly's breakfast on a silver tray, as
was his custom. His lordship always partook of breakfast in his
own room. It is not known how the accident happened, as the old
servant was going up the stairs instead of coming down, but the
steps are very smooth and slippery, and without a carpet; at any
rate, he seems to have fallen from the top to the bottom, and lay
there with a broken neck. Lord Rantremly, who was very deaf,
seemingly did not hear the crash, and it is supposed that after
ringing and ringing in vain, and doubtless working himself into a
violent fit of temper&mdash;alas! too frequent an
occurrence&mdash;the old nobleman got out of bed, and walked
barefooted down the stair, upon the body of his ancient servant
and confederate. There the man who comes in every morning to
light the fires found them, the servant dead, and Lord Rantremly
helpless from an attack of paralysis. The physicians say that
only his eyes seemed alive, and they were filled with a great
fear, and, indeed, that is not to be wondered at, after his
wicked, wicked life. His right hand was but partially disabled,
and with that he tried to scribble something which proved
indecipherable. And so he died, and those who attended him at his
last moments say that if ever a soul had a taste of future
punishment before it left this earth, it was the soul of Lord
Rantremly as it shone through those terror-stricken eyes."</p>

<p>Here the woman stopped, with a catch in her breath, as if the
fear of that grim deathbed had communicated itself to her. I
interjected calmness into an emotional situation by remarking in
a commonplace tone:</p>

<p>"And it is the present Lord Rantremly who proposes to destroy
the castle, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is he the son of the late lord?"</p>

<p>"No; he is a distant relative. The branch of the family to
which he belongs has been engaged in commerce, and, I believe,
its members are very wealth."</p>

<p>"Well, madam, no doubt this is all extremely interesting and
rather grewsome. In what way are you concerned in these
occurrences?"</p>

<p>"Ten years ago I replied to an advertisement, there being
required one who knew shorthand, who possessed a typewriting
machine and a knowledge of French, to act as secretary to a
nobleman. I was at that time twenty-three years old, and for two
years had been trying to earn my living in London through the
typing of manuscript. But I was making a hard struggle of it, so
I applied for this position and got it. There are in the library
of Rantremly Castle many documents relating to the Stuart exile
in France. His lordship wished these documents assorted and
catalogued, as well as copies taken of each. Many of the letters
were in the French language, and these I was required to
translate and type. It was a somber place of residence, but the
salary was good, and I saw before me work enough to keep me busy
for years. Besides this, the task was extremely congenial, and I
became absorbed in it, being young and romantically inclined.
Here I seemed to live in the midst of these wonderful intrigues
of long ago. Documents passed through my hands whose very
possession at one period meant capital danger, bringing up even
now visions of block, ax, and masked headsman. It seemed strange
to me that so sinister a man as Lord Rantremly, who, I had heard,
cared for nothing but drink and gambling, should have desired to
promote this historical research, and, indeed, I soon found he
felt nothing but contempt for it. However, he had undertaken it
at the instance of his only son, then a young man of my own age,
at Oxford University.</p>

<p>"Lord Rantremly at that time was sixty-five years old. His
countenance was dark, harsh, and imperious, and his language
brutal. He indulged in frightful outbursts of temper, but he paid
so well for service that there was no lack of it, as there has
been since the ghost appeared some years ago. He was very tall
and of commanding appearance, but had a deformity in the shape of
a clubfoot, and walked with the halting step of those so
afflicted. There were at that time servants in plenty at the
castle, for although a tradition existed that the ghost of the
founder of the house trod certain rooms, this ghost, it was said,
never demonstrated its presence when the living representative of
the family was a man with a clubfoot. Tradition further affirmed
that if this clubfooted ghost allowed its halting footsteps to be
heard while the reigning lord possessed a similar deformity, the
conjunction foreshadowed the passing of title and estates to a
stranger. The ghost haunted the castle only when it was occupied
by a descendant whose two feet were normal. It seems that the
founder of the house was a clubfooted man, and this disagreeable
peculiarity often missed one generation, and sometimes two, while
at other times both father and son had clubfeet, as was the case
with the late Lord Rantremly and the young man at Oxford. I am
not a believer in the supernatural, of course; but, nevertheless,
it is strange that within the past few years everyone residing in
the castle has heard the clubfooted ghost, and now title and
estates descend to a family that were utter strangers to the
Rantremlys."</p>

<p>"Well, madam, this also sounds most alluring, and were my time
not taken up with affairs more material than those to which you
allude, I should be content to listen all day, but as it
is&mdash;" I spread my hands and shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>The woman with a deep sigh said:</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have taken so long, but I wished you to
understand the situation, and now I will come direct to the heart
of the case. I worked alone in the library, as I told you, much
interested in what I was doing. The chaplain, a great friend of
Lord Rantremly's son, and, indeed, a former tutor of his,
assisted me with the documents that were in Latin, and a
friendship sprang up between us. He was an elderly man, and
extremely unworldly. Lord Rantremly never concealed his scorn of
this clergyman, but did not interfere with him because of the
son.</p>

<p>"My work went on very pleasantly up to the time that Reginald,
the heir of his lordship, came down from Oxford. Then began the
happiest days of a life that has been otherwise full of hardships
and distress. Reginald was as different as possible from his
father. In one respect only did he bear any resemblance to that
terrible old man, and this resemblance was the deformity of a
clubfoot, a blemish which one soon forgot when one came to know
the gentle and high-minded nature of the young man. As I have
said, it was at his instance that Lord Rantremly had engaged me
to set in order those historical papers. Reginald became
enthusiastic at the progress I had made, and thus the young
nobleman, the chaplain, and myself continued our work together
with ever-increasing enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"To cut short a recital which must be trying to your patience,
but which is necessary if you are to understand the situation, I
may say that our companionship resulted in a proposal of marriage
to me, which I foolishly, perhaps, and selfishly, it may be,
accepted. Reginald knew that his father would never consent, but
we enlisted the sympathy of the chaplain, and he, mild, unworldly
man, married us one day in the consecrated chapel of the
castle.</p>

<p>"As I have told you, the house at that time contained many
servants, and I think, without being sure, that the butler, whom
I feared even more than Lord Rantremly himself, got some inkling
of what was going forward. But, be that as it may, he and his
lordship entered the chapel just as the ceremony was finished,
and there followed an agonizing scene. His lordship flung the
ancient chaplain from his place, and when Reginald attempted to
interfere, the maddened nobleman struck his son full in the face
with his clinched fist, and my husband lay as one dead on the
stone floor of the chapel. By this time the butler had locked the
doors, and had rudely torn the vestments from the aged,
half-insensible clergyman, and with these tied him hand and foot.
All this took place in a very few moments, and I stood there as
one paralyzed, unable either to speak or scream, not that
screaming would have done me any good in that horrible place of
thick walls. The butler produced a key, and unlocked a small,
private door at the side of the chapel which led from the
apartments of his lordship to the family pew. Then taking my
husband by feet and shoulders, Lord Rantremly and the butler
carried him out, locking the door, and leaving the clergyman and
me prisoners in the chapel. The reverend old gentleman took no
notice of me. He seemed to be dazed, and when at last I found my
voice and addressed him, he merely murmured over and over texts
of Scripture pertaining to the marriage service.</p>

<p>"In a short time I heard the key turn again in the lock of the
private door, and the butler entered alone. He unloosened the
bands around the clergyman's knees, escorted him out, and once
more locked the door behind him. A third time that terrible
servant came back, grasped me roughly by the wrist, and without a
word dragged me with him along a narrow passage, up a stair, and
finally to the main hall, and so to my lord's private study,
which adjoined his bedroom, and there on a table I found my
typewriting machine brought up from the library.</p>

<p>"I have but the most confused recollection of what took place.
I am not a courageous woman, and was in mortal terror both of
Lord Rantremly and his attendant. His lordship was pacing up and
down the room, and, when I came in, used the most unseemly
language to me; then ordered me to write at his dictation,
swearing that if I did not do exactly as he told me, he would
finish his son, as he put it. I sat down at the machine, and he
dictated a letter to himself, demanding two thousand pounds paid
to me, otherwise I should claim that I was the wife of his son,
secretly married. This, placing pen and ink before me, he
compelled me to sign, and when I had done so, pleading to be
allowed to see my husband, if only for a moment, I thought he was
going to strike me, for he shook his fist in my face, and used
words which were appalling to hear. That was the last I ever saw
of Lord Rantremly, my husband, the clergyman, or the butler. I
was at once sent off to London with my belongings, the butler
himself buying my ticket, and flinging a handful of sovereigns
into my lap as the train moved out."</p>

<p>Here the woman stopped, buried her face in her hands, and
began to weep.</p>

<p>"Have you done nothing about this for the past ten years?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"What could I do?" she gasped. "I had little money, and no
friends. Who would believe my story? Besides this, Lord Rantremly
retained possession of a letter, signed by myself, that would
convict me of attempted blackmail, while the butler would swear
to anything against me."</p>

<p>"You have no marriage certificate, of course?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What has become of the clergyman?"</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"And what of Lord Rantremly's son?"</p>

<p>"It was announced that he had gone on a voyage to Australia
for his health in a sailing ship, which was wrecked on the
African coast, and everyone on board lost."</p>

<p>"What is your own theory?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my husband was killed by the blow given him in the
chapel."</p>

<p>"Madam, that does not seem credible. A blow from the fist
seldom kills."</p>

<p>"But he fell backward, and his head struck the sharp stone
steps at the foot of the altar. I know my husband was dead when
the butler and his father carried him out."</p>

<br>

<p class="caption">
"He fell backward, and his head struck the<br>
sharp stone steps at the foot of the altar."</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"You think the clergyman also was murdered?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. Both master and servant were capable of any
crime or cruelty."</p>

<p>"You received no letters from the young man?"</p>

<p>"No. You see, during our short friendship we were constantly
together, and there was no need of correspondence."</p>

<p>"Well, madam, what do you expect of me?"</p>

<p>"I hoped you would investigate, and find perhaps where
Reginald and the clergyman are buried. I realize that I have no
proof, but in that way my strange story will be
corroborated."</p>

<p>I leaned back in my chair and looked at her. Truth to tell, I
only partially credited her story myself, and yet I was positive
she believed every word of it. Ten years brooding on a fancied
injustice by a woman living alone, and doubtless often in dire
poverty, had mixed together the actual and the imaginary, until
now, what had possibly been an aimless flirtation on the part of
the young man, unexpectedly discovered by the father, had formed
itself into the tragedy which she had told me.</p>

<p>"Would it not be well," I suggested, "to lay the facts before
the present Lord Rantremly?"</p>

<p>"I have done so," she answered simply.</p>

<p>"With what result?"</p>

<p>"His lordship said my story was preposterous. In examining the
late lord's private papers, he discovered the letter which I
typed and signed. He said very coldly that the fact I had waited
until everyone who could corroborate or deny my story was dead,
united with the improbability of the narrative itself, would very
likely consign me to prison if I made public a statement so
incredible."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, madam, I think his lordship is right."</p>

<p>"He offered me an annuity of fifty pounds, which I
refused."</p>

<p>"In that refusal, madam, I think you are wrong. If you take my
advice, you will accept the annuity."</p>

<p>The woman rose slowly to her feet.</p>

<p>"It is not money I am after," she said, "although, God knows,
I have often been in sore need of it. But I am the Countess of
Rantremly, and I wish my rights to that name acknowledged. My
character has been under an impalpable shadow for ten years. On
several occasions mysterious hints have reached me that in some
manner I left the castle under a cloud. If Lord Rantremly will
destroy the letter which I was compelled to write under duress,
and if he will give me a written acknowledgment that there was
nothing to be alleged against me during my stay in the castle, he
may enjoy his money in peace for all of me. I want none of
it."</p>

<p>"Have you asked him to do this?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He refuses to give up or destroy the letter, although I
told him in what circumstances it had been written. But, desiring
to be fair, he said he would allow me a pound a week for life,
entirely through his own generosity."</p>

<p>"And this you refused?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I refused."</p>

<p>"Madam, I regret to say that I cannot see my way to do
anything with regard to what I admit is very unjust usage. We
have absolutely nothing to go upon except your unsupported word.
Lord Rantremly was perfectly right when he said no one would
credit your story. I could not go down to Rantremly Castle and
make investigations there. I should have no right upon the
premises at all, and would get into instant trouble as an
interfering trespasser. I beg you to heed my advice, and accept
his annuity."</p>

<p>Sophia Brooks, with that mild obstinacy of which I had
perceived indications during her recital, slowly shook her
head.</p>

<p>"You have been very kind to listen for so long," she said, and
then, with a curt "Good day!" turned and left the room. On the
sheet of paper underneath her address I wrote this prophecy:
"Before the week is out, I predict that Lord Rantremly himself
will call to see me."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br>

A COMMISSION FROM LORD RANTREMLY</h2>

<p class="first">
NEXT morning, at almost the same hour that Miss Brooks had
arrived the day before, the Earl of Rantremly's card was brought
in to me.</p>

<p>His lordship proved to be an abrupt, ill-mannered, dapper
business man; purse-proud, I should call him, as there was every
reason he should be, for he had earned his own fortune. He was
doubtless equally proud of his new title, which he was trying to
live up to, assuming now and then a haughty, domineering
attitude, and again relapsing into the keen, incisive manner of
the man of affairs; shrewd financial sense waging a constant
struggle with the glamour of an ancient name. I am sure he would
have shone to better advantage either as a financier or as a
nobleman, but the combination was too much for him. I formed an
instinctive dislike to the man, which probably would not have
happened had he been wearing the title for twenty years, or had I
met him as a business man, with no thought of the aristocratic
honor awaiting him. There seemed nothing in common between him
and the former holder of the title. He had keen, ferrety eves, a
sharp financial nose, a thin-lipped line of mouth, which
indicated little of human kindness. He was short of stature, but
he did not possess the clubfoot, which was one advantage. He
seated himself before I had time to offer him a chair, and kept
on his hat in my presence, which he would not have done if he had
either been a genuine nobleman or a courteous business man.</p>

<p>"I am Lord Rantremly," he announced pompously, which
announcement was quite unnecessary, because I held his card in my
hand.</p>

<p>"Quite so, my lord. And you have come to learn whether or no I
can lay the ghost in that old castle to the north which bears
your name?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blessed!" cried his lordship, agape. "How could you
guess that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not a guess, but rather a choice of two objects,
either of which might bring you to my rooms. I chose the first
motive because I thought you might prefer to arrange the second
problem with your solicitor, and he doubtless told you that Miss
Sophia Brooks's claim was absurd; that you were quite right in
refusing to give up or destroy the typewritten letter she had
signed ten years ago, and that it was weakness on your part,
without consulting him, to offer her an annuity of fifty-two
pounds a year."</p>

<p>Long before this harangue was finished, which I uttered in an
easy and nonchalant tone of voice, as if reciting something that
everybody knew, his lordship stood on his feet again, staring at
me like a man thunderstruck. This gave me the opportunity of
exercising that politeness which his abrupt entrance and demeanor
had forestalled. I rose and, bowing, said:</p>

<p>"I pray you to be seated, my lord." He dropped into the chair,
rather than sat down in it.</p>

<p>"And now," I continued, with the utmost suavity, stretching
forth my hand, "may I place your hat on this shelf out of the
way, where it will not incommode you during our discourse?"</p>

<p>Like a man in a dream, he took his hat from his head, and
passively handed it to me, and after placing it in safety I
resumed my chair with the comfortable feeling that his lordship
and I were much nearer a plane of equality than when he entered
the room.</p>

<p>"How about the ghost with a clubfoot, my lord?" said I
genially. "May I take it that in the City, that sensible,
commercial portion of London, no spirits are believed in except
those sold over the bars?"</p>

<p>"If you mean," began his lordship, struggling to reach his
dignity once more, "if you mean to ask if there is any man fool
enough to place credit in the story of a ghost, I answer no. I am
a practical man, sir. I now possess in the north property
representing, in farming lands, in shooting rights, and what not,
a locked-up capital of many thousand pounds. As you seem to know
everything, sir, perhaps you are aware that I propose to build a
modern mansion on the estate."</p>

<p>"Yes; I saw the letter in the <i>Times</i>."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. It has come to a fine pass if, in this
country of law and the rights of property, a man may not do what
he pleases with his own."</p>

<p>"I think, my lord, cases may be cited where the decisions of
your courts have shown a man may not do what he likes with his
own. Nevertheless, I am quite certain that if you level Rantremly
Castle with the ground, and build a modern mansion in its place,
the law will not hinder you."</p>

<p>"I should hope not, sir, I should hope not," said his lordship
gruffly. "Nevertheless, I am not one who wishes to ride roughshod
over public opinion.</p>

<p>"I am chairman of several companies which depend more or less
on popular favor for success. I deplore unnecessary antagonism.
Technically, I might assert my right to destroy this ancient
stronghold to-morrow if I wished to do so, and if that right were
seriously disputed, I should, of course, stand firm. But it is
not seriously disputed. The British nation, sir, is too sensible
a people to object to the removal of an antiquated structure that
has long outlived its usefulness, and the erection of a mansion
replete with all modern improvements would be a distinct addition
to the country, sir. A few impertinent busybodies protest against
the demolition of Rantremly Castle, but that is all."</p>

<p>"Ah, then, you <i>do</i> intend to destroy it?" I rejoined,
and it is possible that a touch of regret was manifest in my
tones.</p>

<p>"Not just at present; not until this vulgar clamor has had
time to subside. Nevertheless, as a business man, I am forced to
recognize that a large amount of unproductive capital is locked
up in that property."</p>

<p>"And why is it locked up?"</p>

<p>"Because of an absurd belief that the place is haunted. I
could let it to-morrow at a good figure, if it were not for that
rumor."</p>

<p>"But surely sensible men do not pay any attention to such a
rumor?"</p>

<p>"Sensible men may not, but sensible men are often married to
silly women, and the women object. It is only the other day that
I was in negotiation with Bates, of Bates, Sturgeon &amp; Bates, a
very wealthy man, quite able and willing to pay the price I
demanded. He cared nothing about the alleged ghost, but his
family absolutely refused to have anything to do with the place,
and so the arrangement fell through."</p>

<p>"What is your theory regarding this ghost, my lord?"</p>

<p>He answered me with some impatience.</p>

<p>"How can a sane man hold a theory about a ghost? I can,
however, advance a theory regarding the noises heard in the
castle. For years that place has been the resort of questionable
characters."</p>

<p>"I understand the Rantremly family is a very old one," I
commented innocently, but his lordship did not notice the
innuendo.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are an old family," he went on with great
complacency. "The castle, as perhaps you are aware, is a huge,
ramshackle place, honeycombed underneath with cellars. I dare say
in the old days some of these cellars and caves were the resort
of smugglers, and the receptacle of their contraband wares,
doubtless with the full knowledge of my ancestors, who, I regret
to admit, as a business man, were not too particular in their
respect for law. I make no doubt that the castle is now the
refuge of a number of dangerous characters, who, knowing the
legends of the place, frighten away fools by impersonating
ghosts."</p>

<p>"You wish me to uncover their retreat, then?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"Could I get accommodation in the castle itself?"</p>

<p>"Lord bless you, no! Nor within two miles of it. You might
secure bed and board at the porter's lodge, perhaps, or in the
village, which is three miles distant."</p>

<p>"I should prefer to live in the castle night and day, until
the mystery is solved."</p>

<p>"Ah! you are a practical man. That is a very sensible
resolution. But you can persuade no one in that neighborhood to
bear you company. You would need to take some person down with
you from London, and the chances are that person will not stay
long."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, my lord, if you used your influence, the chief of
police in the village might allow a constable to bear me company.
I do not mind roughing it in the least, but I should like some
one to prepare my meals, and to be on hand in case of a struggle,
should your surmise concerning the ghost prove correct."</p>

<p>"I regret to inform you," said his lordship, "that the police
in that barbarous district are as superstitious as the
peasantry. I myself told the chief constable my theory, and for
six weeks he has been trying to run down the miscreants, who I am
sure are making a rendezvous of the castle. Would you believe it,
sir, that the constabulary, after a few nights' experience in the
castle, threatened to resign in a body if they were placed on
duty at Rantremly? They said they heard groans and shrieks, and
the measured beat of a clubfoot on the oaken floors. Perfectly
absurd, of course, but there you are! Why, I cannot even get a
charwoman or laborer to clear up the evidences of the tragedy
which took place there six weeks ago. The beds are untouched, the
broken china and the silver tray lie to-day at the foot of the
stairway, and everything remains just as it was when the inquest
took place."</p>

<p>"Very well, my lord, the case presents many difficulties, and
so, speaking as one business man to another, you will understand
that my compensation must be correspondingly great."</p>

<p>All the assumed dignity which straightened up this man
whenever I addressed him as "my lord" instantly fell from him
when I enunciated the word "compensation." His eyes narrowed,
and all the native shrewdness of an adept skinflint appeared in
his face. I shall do him the justice to say that he drove the
very best bargain he could with me, and I, on my part, very
deftly concealed from him the fact that I was so much interested
in the affair that I should have gone down to Rantremly for
nothing rather than forego the privilege of ransacking Rantremly
Castle.</p>

<p>When the new earl had taken his departure, walking to the door
with the haughty air of a nobleman, then bowing to me with the
affability of a business man, I left my flat, took a cab, and
speedily found myself climbing the stair to the first floor of
51, Beaumont Street, Strand. As I paused at the door on which
were painted the words, <span class="smcap">"S. Brooks,
Stenography, Typewriting, Translation,"</span> I heard the rapid
<i>click-click</i> of a machine inside. Knocking at the door the
writing ceased, and I was bidden to enter. The room was but
meagerly furnished, and showed scant signs of prosperity. On a
small side table, clean, but uncovered, the breakfast dishes,
washed, but not yet put away, stood, and the kettle on the hob by
the dying fire led me to infer that the typewriting woman was her
own cook. I suspected that the awkward-looking sofa which partly
occupied one side of the room concealed a bed. By the lone front
window stood the typewriting machine on a small stand, and in
front of it sat the woman who had visited me the morning before.
She was now gazing at me, probably hoping I was a customer, for
there was no recognition in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Lady Rantremly," was my greeting, which caused
her to spring immediately to her feet, with a little exclamation
of surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said at last, "you are Monsieur Valmont. Excuse me
that I am so stupid. Will you take a chair?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, madam. It is I who should ask to be excused for so
unceremonious a morning call. I have come to ask you a question.
Can you cook?"</p>

<p>The lady looked at me with some surprise, mingled perhaps with
so much of indignation as such a mild person could assume. She
did not reply, but, glancing at the kettle, and then turning
toward the breakfast dishes on the table by the wall, a slow
flush of color suffused her wan cheeks.</p>

<p>"My lady," I said at last, as the silence became embarrassing,
"you must pardon the impulse of a foreigner who finds himself
constantly brought into conflict with prejudices which he fails
to understand. You are perhaps offended at my question. The last
person of whom I made that inquiry was the young and beautiful
Madame la Comtesse de Valerie-Moberanne, who enthusiastically
clapped her hands with delight at the compliment, and replied
impulsively:</p>

<p>"'Oh, Monsieur Valmont, let me compose for you an omelet which
will prove a dream,' and she did. One should not forget that
Louis XVIII himself cooked the <i>truffes à la purée
d'ortolans</i> that caused the Duc d'Escars, who partook of the
royal dish, to die of an indigestion. Cooking is a noble, yes, a
regal art. I am a Frenchman, my lady, and, like all my
countrymen, regard the occupation of a <i>cuisinière</i> as
infinitely superior to the manipulation of that machine, which is
your profession, or the science of investigation, which is
mine."</p>

<p>"Sir," she said, quite unmollified by my harangue, speaking
with a lofty pride which somehow seemed much more natural than
that so intermittently assumed by my recent visitor, "Sir, have
you come to offer me a situation as cook?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, at Rantremly Castle."</p>

<p>"You are going there?" she demanded, almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, I leave on the ten o'clock train to-morrow
morning. I am commissioned by Lord Rantremly to investigate the
supposed presence of the ghost in that moldering dwelling. I am
allowed to bring with me whatever assistants I require, and am
assured that no one in the neighborhood can be retained who dare
sleep in the castle. You know the place very well, having lived
there, so I shall be glad of your assistance, if you will come.
If there is any person whom you can trust, and who is not afraid
of ghosts, I shall be delighted to escort you both to Rantremly
Castle to-morrow."</p>

<p>"There is an old woman," she said, "who comes here to clear up
my room, and do whatever I wish done. She is so deaf that she
will hear no ghosts, and besides, monsieur, she can cook."</p>

<p>I laughed in acknowledgment of this last sly dig at me, as the
English say.</p>

<p>"That will do excellently," I replied, rising, and placing a
ten-pound note before her. "I suggest, madam, that you purchase
with this anything you may need. My man has instructions to send
by passenger train a huge case of provisions, which should arrive
there before us. If you could make it convenient to meet me at
Euston Station about a quarter of an hour before the train
leaves, we may be able to discover all you wish to know regarding
the mystery of Rantremly Castle."</p>

<p>Sophia Brooks accepted the money without demur, and thanked
me. I could see that her thin hands were trembling with
excitement as she put the crackling bank note into her purse.</p>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX<br>

THE GHOST WITH THE CLUBFOOT</h2>

<p class="first">
DARKNESS was coming on next evening before we were installed
in the grim building, which at first sight seemed more like a
fortress than a residence. I had telegraphed from London to order
a wagonette for us, and in this vehicle we drove to the police
station, where I presented the written order from Lord Rantremly
for the keys of the castle. The chief constable himself, a
stolid, taciturn person, exhibited, nevertheless, some interest
in my mission, and he was good enough to take the fourth seat in
the wagonette, and accompany us through the park to the castle,
returning in that conveyance to the village as nightfall
approached, and I could not but notice that this grave official
betrayed some uneasiness to get off before dusk had completely
set in. Silent as he was, I soon learned that he entirely
disbelieved Lord Rantremly's theory that the castle harbored
dangerous characters, yet so great was his inherent respect for
the nobility that I could not induce him to dispute with any
decisiveness his lordship's conjecture. It was plain to be seen,
however, that the chief constable believed implicitly in the club
footed ghost. I asked him to return the next morning, as I should
spend the night in investigation, and might possibly have some
questions to ask him, questions which none but the chief
constable could answer. The good man promised, and left us rather
hurriedly, the driver of the wagonette galloping his horse down
the long, somber avenue toward the village outside the gates.</p>

<p>I found Sophia Brooks but a doleful companion, and of very
little assistance that evening. She seemed overcome by her
remembrances. She had visited the library where her former work
was done, doubtless the scene of her brief love episode, and she
returned with red eyes and trembling chin, telling me haltingly
that the great tome from which she was working ten years ago, and
which had been left open on the solid library table, was still
there exactly as she had placed it before being forced to abandon
her work. For a decade apparently no one had entered that
library. I could not but sympathize with the poor lady, thus
revisiting, almost herself like a ghost, the haunted arena of her
short happiness. But though she proved so dismal a companion, the
old woman who came with her was a treasure. Having lived all her
life in some semi-slum near the Strand, and having rarely
experienced more than a summer's-day glimpse of the country, the
long journey had delighted her, and now this rambling old castle
in the midst of the forest seemed to realize all the dreams which
a perusal of half-penny fiction had engendered in her
imagination. She lit a fire, and cooked for us a very creditable
supper, bustling about the place, singing to herself in a high
key.</p>

<p>Shortly after supper Sophia Brooks, exhausted as much by her
emotions and memories as by her long journey of that day, retired
to rest. After being left to myself I smoked some cigarettes, and
finished a bottle of superb claret which stood at my elbow. A few
hours before I had undoubtedly fallen in the estimation of the
stolid constable when, instead of asking him questions regarding
the tragedy, I had inquired the position of the wine cellar, and
obtained possession of the key that opened its portal. The sight
of bin after bin of dust-laden, cobwebbed bottles did more than
anything else to reconcile me to my lonely vigil. There were some
notable vintages represented in that dismal cavern.</p>

<p>It was perhaps half past ten or eleven o'clock when I began my
investigations. I had taken the precaution to provide myself with
half a dozen so-called electric torches before I left London.
These give illumination for twenty or thirty hours steadily, and
much longer if the flash is used only now and then. The torch is
a thick tube, perhaps a foot and a half long, with a bull's-eye
of glass at one end. By pressing a spring the electric rays
project like the illumination of an engine's headlight A release
of the spring causes instant darkness. I have found this
invention useful in that it concentrates the light on any
particular spot desired, leaving all the surroundings in gloom,
so that the mind is not distracted, even unconsciously, by the
eye beholding more than is necessary at the moment. One pours a
white light over any particular substance as water is poured from
the nozzle of a hose.</p>

<p>The great house was almost painfully silent. I took one of
these torches, and went to the foot of the grand staircase where
the wicked butler had met his death. There, as his lordship had
said, lay the silver tray, and near by a silver jug, a pair of
spoons, a knife and fork, and scattered all around the fragments
of broken plates, cups, and saucers. With an exclamation of
surprise at the stupidity of the searchers who had preceded me, I
ran up the stair two steps at a time, turned to the right, and
along the corridor until I came to the room occupied by the late
earl. The coverings of the bed lay turned down just as they were
when his lordship sprang to the floor, doubtless, in spite of his
deafness, having heard faintly the fatal crash at the foot of the
stairs. A great oaken chest stood at the head of the bed, perhaps
six inches from the wall. Leaning against this chest at the edge
of the bed inclined a small, round table, and the cover of the
table had slipped from its sloping surface until it partly
concealed the chest lid. I mounted on this carven box of old
black oak and directed the rays of electric light into the chasm
between it and the wall. Then I laughed aloud, and was somewhat
startled to hear another laugh directly behind me. I jumped down
on the floor again, and swung round my torch like a searchlight
on a battle ship at sea. There was no human presence in that
chamber except myself. Of course, after my first moment of
surprise, I realized that the laugh was but an echo of my own.
The old walls of the old house were like sounding boards. The
place resembled an ancient fiddle, still tremulous with the music
that had been played on it. It was easy to understand how a
superstitious population came to believe in its being haunted; in
fact, I found by experiment that if one trod quickly along the
uncovered floor of the corridor, and stopped suddenly, one seemed
to hear the sound of steps still going on.</p>

<p>I now returned to the stair head, and examined the bare
polished boards with most gratifying results. Amazed at having
learned so much in such a short time, I took from my pocket the
paper on which the dying nobleman had attempted to write with his
half-paralyzed hand. The chief constable had given the document
to me, and I sat on the stair head, spread it out on the floor
and scrutinized it. It was all but meaningless. Apparently two
words and the initial letter of a third had been attempted. Now,
however grotesque a piece of writing may be, you can sometimes
decipher it by holding it at various angles, as those puzzles are
solved which remain a mystery when gazed at direct. By partially
closing the eyes you frequently catch the intent, as in those
pictures where a human figure is concealed among the outlines of
trees and leaves. I held the paper at arm's length, and with the
electric light gleaming upon it, examined it at all angles, with
eyes wide open, and eyes half closed. At last, inclining it away
from me, I saw that the words were intended to mean, "The
Secret." The secret, of course, was what he was trying to impart,
but he had apparently got no farther than the title of it. Deeply
absorbed in my investigation, I was never more startled in my
life than to hear in the stillness down the corridor the gasped
words, <i>"Oh, God!"</i></p>

<p>I swept round my light, and saw leaning against the wall, in
an almost fainting condition, Sophia Brooks, her eyes staring
like those of a demented person, and her face white as any
ghost's could have been. Wrapped round her was a dressing gown. I
sprang to my feet.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that you, Monsieur Valmont? Thank God, thank God! I
thought I was going insane. I saw a hand, a bodiless hand,
holding a white sheet of paper."</p>

<p>"The hand was far from bodiless, madam, for it belonged to me.
But why are you here? It must be near midnight."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> midnight," answered the woman. "I came here
because I heard my husband call me three times distinctly,
'Sophia, Sophia, Sophia!' just like that."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, madam," I said, with an asperity I seldom use where
the fair sex is concerned; but I began to see that this
hysterical creature was going to be in the way during a research
that called for coolness and calmness. I was sorry I had invited
her to come. "Nonsense, madam, you have been dreaming."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Monsieur Valmont, I have not. I have not even been
asleep, and I heard the words quite plainly. You must not think I
am either mad or superstitious."</p>

<p>I thought she was both, and next moment she gave further
evidence of it, running suddenly forward, and clutching me by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Listen! listen!" she whispered. "You hear nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" I cried again, almost roughly, for my patience was
at an end, and I wished to go on with my inquiry undisturbed.</p>

<p>"Hist, hist!" she whispered; "listen!" holding up her finger.
We both stood like statues, and suddenly I felt that curious
creeping of the scalp which shows that even the most civilized
among us have not yet eliminated superstitious fear. In the tense
silence I heard some one slowly coming up the stair; I heard the
halting step of a lame man. In the tension of the moment I had
allowed the light to go out; now recovering myself, I pressed the
spring, and waved its rays backward and forward down the
stairway. The space was entirely empty, yet the hesitating
footsteps approached us, up and up. I could almost have sworn on
which step they last struck. At this interesting moment Sophia
Brooks uttered a piercing shriek and collapsed into my arms,
sending the electric torch rattling down the steps, and leaving
us in impenetrable darkness. Really, I profess myself to be a
gallant man, but there are situations which have a tendency to
cause annoyance. I carried the limp creature cautiously down the
stairs, fearing the fate of the butler, and at last got her into
the dining room, where I lit a candle, which gave a light less
brilliant, perhaps, but more steady than my torch. I dashed some
water in her face, and brought her to her senses, then uncorking
another bottle of wine, I bade her drink a glassful, which she
did.</p>

<p>"What was it?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Madam, I do not know. Very possibly the club-footed ghost of
Rantremly."</p>

<p>"Do you believe in ghosts, Monsieur Valmont?"</p>

<p>"Last night I did not, but at this hour I believe in only one
thing, which is that it is time everyone was asleep."</p>

<p>She rose to her feet at this, and with a tremulous little
laugh apologized for her terror, but I assured her that for the
moment there were two panic-stricken persons at the stair head.
Taking the candle, and recovering my electric torch, which
luckily was uninjured by its roll down the incline the butler had
taken, I escorted the lady to the door of her room, and bade her
good night, or, rather, as the case happened to be, good
morning.</p>

<p>The rising sun dissipated a slight veil of mist which hung
over the park, and also dissolved, so far as I was concerned, the
phantoms which my imagination had conjured up at midnight. It was
about half past ten when the chief constable arrived. I flatter
myself I put some life into that unimaginative man before I was
done with him.</p>

<p>"What made you think that the butler was mounting the stair
when he fell?"</p>

<p>"He was going up with my lord's breakfast," replied the
chief.</p>

<p>"Then did it not occur to you that, if such were the case, the
silver pitcher would not have been empty, and, besides the broken
dishes, there would have been the rolls, butter, toast, or what
not strewn about the floor?"</p>

<p>The chief constable opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"There was no one else for him to bring breakfast to," he
objected.</p>

<p>"That is where you are very much mistaken. Bring me the boots
the butler wore?"</p>

<p>"He did not wear boots, sir. He wore a pair of cloth
slippers."</p>

<p>"Do you know where they are?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they are in the boot closet."</p>

<p>"Very well, bring them out, examine their soles, and sticking
in one of them you will find a short sliver of pointed oak."</p>

<p>The constable, looking slightly more stupefied than ever,
brought the slippers, and I heard him ejaculate "Well, I'm
blowed!" as he approached me. He handed me the slippers soles
upward, and there, as I have stated, was the fragment of oak,
which I pulled out.</p>

<p>"Now, if you take this piece of oak to the top of the stair,
you will see that it fits exactly a slight interstice at the edge
of one of the planks. It is as well to keep one's eyes open,
constable, when investigating a case like this."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed!" he said again, as we walked up the stair
together.</p>

<p>I showed him that the sliver taken from the slipper fitted
exactly the interstice I had indicated.</p>

<p>"Now," said I to him, "the butler was not going up the stairs,
but was coming down. When he fell headlong he must have made a
fearful clatter. Shuffling along with his burden, his slipper was
impaled by this sliver, and the butler's hands being full, he
could not save himself, but went head-foremost down the stair.
The startling point, however, is the fact that he was <i>not</i>
carrying my lord's breakfast to him, or taking it away from him,
but that there is some one else in the castle for whom he was
caterer. Who is that person?"</p>

<p>"I'm blessed if I know," said the constable, "but I think you
are wrong there. He may not have been carrying up the breakfast,
but he certainly was taking away the tray, as is shown by the
empty dishes, which you have just a moment ago pointed out."</p>

<p>"No, constable; when his lordship heard the crash, and sprang
impulsively from his bed, he upset the little table on which had
been placed his own tray; it shot over the oaken chest at the
head of the bed, and if you look between it and the wall you will
find tray, dishes, and the remnants of a breakfast."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blessed!" exclaimed the chief constable once
again.</p>

<p>"The main point of all this," I went on calmly, "is not the
disaster to the butler, nor even the shock to his lordship, but
the fact that the tray the serving man carried brought food to a
prisoner, who probably for six weeks has been without anything to
eat."</p>

<p>"Then," said the constable, "he is a dead man."</p>

<p>"I find it easier," said I, "to believe in a living man than
in a dead man's ghost. I think I heard his footsteps at midnight,
and they seemed to me the footsteps of a person very nearly
exhausted. Therefore, constable, I have awaited your arrival with
some impatience. The words his late lordship endeavored to write
on the paper were 'The Secret.' I am sure that the hieroglyphics
with which he ended his effort stood for the letter 'R,' and if
he had finished his sentence, it would have stood: 'The Secret
Room.' Now, constable, it is a matter of legend that a secret
room exists in this castle. Do you know where it is?"</p>

<p>"No one knows where the secret room is, or the way to enter
it, except the Lords of Rantremly."</p>

<p>"Well, I can assure you that the Lord of Rantremly who lives
in London knows nothing about it. I have been up and about since
daylight, taking some rough measurements by stepping off
distances. I surmise that the secret room is to the left of this
stairway. Probably a whole suite of rooms exists, for there is
certainly a stair coinciding with this one, and up that stair at
midnight I heard a clubfooted man ascend. Either that, or the
ghost that has frightened you all, and, as I have said, I believe
in the man."</p>

<p>Here the official made the first sensible remark I had yet
heard him utter.</p>

<p>"If the walls are so thick that a prisoner's cry has not been
heard, how could you hear his footsteps, which make much less
noise?"</p>

<p>"That is very well put, constable, and when the same thing
occurred to me earlier this morning, I began to study the
architecture of this castle. In the first place, the entrance
hall is double as wide at the big doors as it is near the
stairway. If you stand with your back to the front door you will
at once wonder why the builders made this curious and unnecessary
right angle, narrowing the farther part of the hall to half its
width. Then, as you gaze at the stair, and see that marvelous
carved oak newell post standing like a monumental column, you
guess, if you have any imagination, that the stairway, like the
hall, was once double as wide as it is now. We are seeing only
half of it, and doubtless we shall find a similar newell post
within the hidden room. You must remember, constable, that these
secret apartments are no small added chambers. Twice they have
sheltered a king."</p>

<p>The constable's head bent low at the mention of royalty. I saw
that his insular prejudice against me and my methods was
vanishing, and that he had come to look upon me with greater
respect than was shown at first.</p>

<p>"The walls need not be thick to be impenetrable to sound. Two
courses of brick and a space between filled with deafening would
do it. The secret apartment has been cut off from the rest of the
house since the castle was built, and was not designed by the
original architect. The partition was probably built in a hurry
to fulfill a pressing need, and it was constructed straight up
the middle of the stair, leaving the stout planks intact, each
step passing thus, as it were, through the wall. Now, when a man
walks up the secret stairway, his footsteps reverberate until one
would swear that some unseen person was treading the visible
boards on the outside."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said the constable, in an awed tone of voice.</p>

<p>"Now, officer, I have here a pickax and a crowbar. I propose
that we settle the question at once."</p>

<p>But to this proposal the constable demurred.</p>

<p>"You surely would not break the wall without permission from
his lordship in London?"</p>

<p>"Constable, I suspect there is no Lord Rantremly in London,
and that we will find a very emaciated but genuine Lord Rantremly
within ten feet of us. I need not tell you that if you are
instrumental in his immediate rescue without the exercise of too
much red tape, your interests will not suffer because you the
more speedily brought food and drink to the lord paramount of
your district."</p>

<p>"Right you are," cried the constable, with an enthusiasm for
which I was not prepared. "Where shall we begin?"</p>

<p>"Oh, anywhere; this wall is all false from the entrance hall
to some point up here. Still, as the butler was carrying the meal
upstairs I think we shall save time if we begin on the
landing."</p>

<p>I found the constable's brawn much superior to his brain. He
worked like a <i>sans-culotte</i> on a barricade. When we had
torn down part of the old oak paneling, which it seemed such a
pity to mutilate with ax and crowbar, we came upon a brick wall,
that quickly gave way before the strength of the constable. Then
we pulled out some substance like matting, and found a second
brick wall, beyond which was a further shell of paneling. The
hole we made revealed nothing but darkness inside, and although
we shouted, there was no answer. At last, when we had hewn it
large enough for a man to enter, I took with me an electric
torch, and stepped inside, the constable following, with crowbar
still in hand. I learned, as I had surmised, that we were in the
upper hall of a staircase nearly as wide as the one on the
outside. A flash of the light showed a door corresponding with
the fireplace of the upper landing, and this door not being
locked, we entered a large room, rather dimly lighted by strongly
barred windows that gave into a blind courtyard, of which there
had been no indication heretofore, either outside or inside the
castle. Broken glass crunched under our feet, and I saw that the
floor was strewn with wine bottles whose necks had been snapped
off to save the pulling of the cork. On a mattress at the farther
end of the room lay a man with gray hair and shaggy, unkempt,
iron-gray beard. He seemed either asleep or dead, but when I
turned my electric light full on his face he proved to be still
alive, for he rubbed his eyes languidly, and groaned, rather than
spoke:</p>

<p>"Is that you at last, you beast of a butler? Bring me
something to eat, in heaven's name!"</p>

<p>I shook him wider awake. He seemed to be drowsed with drink,
and was fearfully emaciated. When I got him on his feet, I
noticed then the deformity that characterized one of them. We
assisted him through the aperture, and down into the dining room,
where he cried out continually for something to eat, but when we
placed food before him, he could scarcely touch it. He became
more like a human being when he had drunk two glasses of wine,
and I saw at once he was not as old as his gray hair seemed to
indicate. There was a haunted look in his eyes, and he watched
the door as if apprehensive.</p>

<p>"Where is that butler?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"Dead," I replied.</p>

<p>"Did I kill him?"</p>

<p>"No; he fell down the stairway and broke his neck."</p>

<p>The man laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"Where is my father?"</p>

<p>"Who is your father?"</p>

<p>"Lord Rantremly."</p>

<p>"He is dead also."</p>

<p>"How came he to die?"</p>

<p>"He died from a stroke of paralysis on the morning the butler
was killed."</p>

<p>The rescued man made no comment on this, but turned and ate a
little more of his food. Then he said to me:</p>

<p>"Do you know a girl named Sophia Brooks?"</p>

<p>"Yes. For ten years she thought you dead."</p>

<p>"Ten years! Good God, do you mean to say I've been in there
only ten years? Why, I'm an old man. I must be sixty at
least."</p>

<p>"No; you're not much over thirty."</p>

<p>"Is Sophia&mdash;" He stopped, and the haunted look came into
his eyes again.</p>

<p>"No. She is all right, and she is here."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere in the grounds. I sent her and the servant out for
a walk, and told them not to return till luncheon time, as the
constable and I had something to do, and did not wish to be
interrupted."</p>

<p>The man ran his hand through his long tangled beard.</p>

<p>"I should like to be trimmed up a bit before I see Sophia," he
said.</p>

<p>"I can do that for you, my lord," cried the constable.</p>

<p>"My lord?" echoed the man. "Oh, yes, I understand. You are a
policeman, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord, chief constable."</p>

<p>"Then I shall give myself up to you. I killed the butler."</p>

<p>"Oh, impossible, my lord!"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't. The beast, as I called him, was getting old,
and one morning he forgot to close the door behind him. I
followed him stealthily out, and, at the head of the stair,
planted my foot in the small of his back, which sent him
headlong. There was an infernal crash. I did not mean to kill the
brute, but merely to escape, and just as I was about to run down
the stairway, I was appalled to see my father looking
like&mdash;looking like&mdash;well, I won't attempt to say what
he looked like; but all my old fear of him returned. As he strode
toward me, along the corridor, I was in such terror that I jumped
through the secret door and slammed it shut."</p>

<p>"Where is the secret door?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The secret door is that fireplace. The whole fireplace moves
inward, if you push aside the carved ornament at the left-hand
corner."</p>

<p>"Is it a dummy fireplace, then?"</p>

<p>"No, you may build a fire in it, and the smoke will escape up
the chimney. But I killed the butler, constable, though not
intending it, I swear."</p>

<p>And now the constable shone forth like the real rough diamond
he was.</p>

<p>"My lord, we'll say nothing about that. Legally you didn't do
it. You see, there's been an inquest on the butler, and the jury
brought in the verdict, 'Death by accident, through stumbling
from the top of the stair.' You can't go behind a coroner's
inquest, my lord."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said his lordship, with the first laugh in which he
had indulged for many a year, "I don't want to go behind
anything, constable. I've been behind that accursed chimney too
long to wish any further imprisonment."</p>

<h2><a id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br>

THE SECRET OF A NOBLE HOUSE</h2>

<p class="first">
A MAN should present the whole truth to his doctor, his
lawyer, or his detective. If a doctor is to cure, he must be
given the full confidence of the patient; if a lawyer is to win a
case, he needs to know what tells against his client as well as
the points in his favor; if a secret agent is to solve a mystery,
all the cards should be put on the table. Those who half trust a
professional man need not be disappointed when results prove
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>A partial confidence reposed in me led to the liberation of a
dangerous criminal, caused me to associate with a robber much
against my own inclination, and brought me within danger of the
law. Of course, I never pretend to possess that absolute
confidence in the law which seems to be the birthright of every
Englishman. I have lived too intimately among the machinery of
the law, and have seen too many of its ghastly mistakes, to hold
it in that blind esteem which appears to be prevalent in the
British Isles.</p>

<p>There is a doggerel couplet which typifies this spirit better
than anything I can write, and it runs:</p>

<p>No rogue ere felt the halter draw, With a good opinion of the
law.</p>

<p>Those lines exemplify the trend of British thought in this
direction. If you question a verdict of their courts, you are a
rogue, and that ends the matter. And yet, when an Englishman
undertakes to circumvent the law, there is no other man on earth
who will go to greater lengths. An amazing people! Never
understandable by the sane of other countries.</p>

<p>It was entirely my own fault that I became involved in affairs
which were almost indefensible and wholly illegal.</p>

<p>My client first tried to bribe me into compliance with his
wishes, which bribe I sternly refused. Then he partially broke
down and, quite unconsciously as I take it, made an appeal to the
heart&mdash;a strange thing for an Englishman to do. My kind
heart has ever been my most vulnerable point. We French are
sentimentalists. France has before now staked its very existence
for an ideal, while other countries fight for continents, cash,
or commerce. You cannot pierce me with a lance of gold, but wave
a wand of sympathy, and I am yours.</p>

<p>There waited upon me in my flat a man who gave his name as
Douglas Sanderson, which may or may not have been his legitimate
title. This was a question into which I never probed, and at the
moment of writing am as ignorant of his true cognomen, if that
was not it, as on the morning he first met me. He was an elderly
man of natural dignity and sobriety, slow in speech, almost
somber in dress. His costume was not quite that of a professional
man, and not quite that of a gentleman. I at once recognized the
order to which he belonged, and a most difficult class it is to
deal with. He was the confidential servant or steward of some
ancient and probably noble family, embodying in himself all the
faults and virtues, each a trifle, accentuated, of the line he
served, and to which, in order to produce him and his like, his
father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had doubtless been
attached. It is frequently the case that the honor of the house
he serves is more dear to him than it is to the representative of
that house. Such a man is almost always the repository of family
secrets; a repository whose inviolability gold cannot affect,
threats sway, or cajolery influence.</p>

<p>I knew, when I looked at him, that practically I was looking
at his master, for I have known many cases where even the
personal appearance of the two were almost identical, which may
have given rise to the English phrase, "Like master, like man."
The servant was a little more haughty, a little less kind, a
little more exclusive, a little less confidential, a little more
condescending, a little less human, a little more Tory, and
altogether a little less pleasant and easy person to deal
with.</p>

<p>"Sir," he began, when I had waved him to a seat, "I am a very
rich man, and can afford to pay well for the commission I request
you to undertake. To ask you to name your own terms may seem
unbusinesslike, so I may say at the outset I am not a business
man. The service I shall ask will involve the utmost secrecy, and
for that I am willing to pay. It may expose you to risk of limb
or liberty, and for that I am willing to pay. It will probably
necessitate the expenditure of a large sum of money; that sum is
at your disposal."</p>

<p>Here he paused; he had spoken slowly and impressively, with a
touch of arrogance in his tone which aroused to his prejudice the
combativeness latent in my nature. However, at this juncture I
merely bowed my head, and replied in accents almost as
supercilious as his own:</p>

<p>"The task must either be unworthy or unwelcome. In mentioning
first the compensation you are inverting the natural order of
things. You should state at the outset what you expect me to do,
then, if I accept the commission, it is time to discuss the
details of expenditure."</p>

<p>Either he had not looked for such a reply, or was loath to
open his budget, for he remained a few moments with his eyes bent
upon the floor, and lips compressed in silence. At last he went
on, without change of inflection, without any diminution of that
air of condescension which had so exasperated me in the
beginning, and which was preparing a downfall for himself that
would rudely shake the cold dignity which encompassed him like a
cloak:</p>

<p>"It is difficult for a father to confide in a complete
stranger the vagaries of a beloved son, and before doing so you
must pledge your word that my communication will be regarded as
strictly confidential."</p>

<p><i>"Celà va sans dire."</i></p>

<p>"I do not understand French," said Mr. Sanderson severely, as
if the use of the phrase were an insult to him.</p>

<p>I replied nonchalantly:</p>

<p>"It means, as a matter of course,' That goes without saying.'
Whatever you care to tell me about your son will be mentioned to
no one. Pray proceed, without further circumlocution, for my time
is valuable."</p>

<p>"My son was always a little wild and impatient of control.
Although everything he could wish was at his disposal here at
home, he chose to visit America, where he fell into bad company.
I assure you there is no real harm in the boy, but he became
implicated with others, and has suffered severely for his
recklessness. For five years he has been an inmate of a prison in
the West. He was known and convicted under the name of Wyoming
Ed."</p>

<p>"What was his crime?"</p>

<p>"His alleged crime was the stopping and robbing of a railway
train."</p>

<p>"For how long was he sentenced?"</p>

<p>"He was sentenced for life."</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do?"</p>

<p>"Every appeal has been made to the governor of the State, in
an endeavor to obtain a pardon. These appeals have failed. I am
informed that if money enough is expended it may be possible to
arrange my son's escape."</p>

<p>"In other words, you wish me to bribe the officials of the
jail?"</p>

<p>"I assure you the lad is innocent."</p>

<p>For the first time a quiver of human emotion came into the old
man's voice.</p>

<p>"Then, if you can prove that, why not apply for a new
trial?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the circumstances of the case of his arrest on
the train itself, the number of witnesses against him, give me no
hope that a new trial would end in a different verdict, even if a
new trial could be obtained, which I am informed is not possible.
Every legal means tending to his liberation has already been
tried."</p>

<p>"I see. And now you are determined to adopt illegal means? I
refuse to have anything to do with the malpractice you propose.
You objected to a phrase in French, Mr. Sanderson; perhaps one in
Latin will please you better. It is <i>'Veritas prævalebit'</i>,
which means 'Truth will prevail.' I shall set your mind entirely
at rest regarding your son. Your son at this moment occupies a
humble, if honorable, position in the great house from which you
came, and he hopes in time worthily to fill his father's shoes,
as you have filled the shoes of your father. You are not a rich
man, but a servant. Your son never was in America, and never will
go there. It is your master's son, the heir to great English
estates, who became the Wyoming Ed of the Western prison. Even
from what you say, I do not in the least doubt he was justly
convicted, and you may go back to your master and tell him so.
You came here to conceal the shameful secret of a wealthy and
noble house; you may return knowing that secret has been
revealed, and that the circumstances in which you so solemnly
bound me to secrecy never existed. Sir, that is the penalty of
lying."</p>

<p>The old man's contempt for me had been something to be felt,
so palpable was it. The armor of icy reserve had been so complete
that actually I had expected to see him rise with undiminished
hauteur and leave the room, disdaining further parley with one
who had insulted him. Doubtless that is the way in which his
master would have acted, but even in the underling I was
unprepared for the instantaneous crumbling of this monument of
pomp and pride. A few moments after I began to speak in terms as
severe as his own, his trembling hands grasped the arms of the
chair in which he sat, and his ever-widening eyes, which came to
regard me with something like superstitious dread as I went on,
showed me I had launched my random arrow straight at the
bull's-eye of fact. His face grew mottled and green rather than
pale. When at last I accused him of lying, he arose slowly,
shaking like a man with a palsy, but, unable to support himself
erect, sank helplessly back into his chair again. His head fell
forward to the table before him, and he sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>"God help me!" he cried, "it is not my own secret I am trying
to guard.'"</p>

<p>I sprang to the door, and turned the key in the lock so that
by no chance might we be interrupted; then, going to the
sideboard, I poured him out a <i>liqueur</i> glass full of the
finest Cognac ever imported from south of the Loire, and tapping
him on the shoulder said brusquely:</p>

<p>"Here, drink this. The case is no worse than it was half an
hour ago. I shall not betray the secret."</p>

<p>He tossed off the brandy, and with some effort regained his
self-control.</p>

<p>"I have done my errand badly," he wailed. "I don't know what I
have said that has led you to so accurate a statement of the real
situation, but I have been a blundering fool. God forgive me,
when so much depended on my making no mistake."</p>

<p>"Don't let that trouble you," I replied; "nothing you said
gave me the slightest clew."</p>

<p>"You called me a liar," he continued, "and that is a hard word
from one man to another; but I would not lie for myself, and when
I do it for one I revere and respect, my only regret is that I
have done it without avail."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," I assured him, "the fault is not with yourself
at all. You were simply attempting the impossible. Stripped and
bare, your proposal amounts to this: I am to betake myself to the
United States, and there commit a crime, or a series of crimes,
in bribing sworn officials to turn traitor to their duty and
permit a convict to escape."</p>

<p>"You put it very harshly, sir. You must admit that, especially
in new countries, there is lawlessness within the law as well as
outside of it. The real criminals in the robbery of the railway
train escaped; my young master, poor fellow, was caught. His
father, one of the proudest men in England, has grown prematurely
old under the burden of this terrible dishonor. He is
broken-hearted and a dying man, yet he presents an impassive
front to the world, with all the ancient courage of his race. My
young master is an only son, and failing his appearance, should
his father die, title and estate will pass to strangers. Our
helplessness in this situation adds to its horror. We dare not
make any public move. My old master is one with such influence
among the governing class of this country, of which he has long
been a member, that the average Englishman, if his name were
mentioned, would think his power limitless. Yet that power he
dare not exert to save his own son from a felon's life and death.
However much he or another may suffer, publicity must be avoided,
and this is a secret which cannot safely be shared with more than
those who know it now."</p>

<p>"How many know it?"</p>

<p>"In this country, three persons. In an American prison,
one."</p>

<p>"Have you kept up communication with the young man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Direct?"</p>

<p>"No; through a third person. My young master has implored his
father not to write to him direct."</p>

<p>"This go-between, as we may call him, is the third person in
the secret? Who is he?"</p>

<p>"That I dare not tell you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sanderson, it would be much better for your master and
his son that you should be more open with me. These half
confidences are misleading. Has the son made any suggestion
regarding his release?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but not the suggestion I have put before you. His
latest letter was to the effect that within six months or so
there is to be an election for governor. He proposes that a large
sum of money shall be used to influence this election so that a
man pledged to pardon him may sit in the governor's chair."</p>

<p>"I see. And this sum of money is to be paid to the third
person you referred to?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"May I take it that this third person is the one to whom
various sums have been paid during the last five years in order
to bribe the governor to pardon the young man?"</p>

<p>Sanderson hesitated a moment before answering; in fact, he
appeared so torn between inclination and duty, anxious to give me
whatever information I deemed necessary, yet hemmed in by the
instructions with which his master had limited him, that at last
I waved my hand and said:</p>

<p>"You need not reply, Mr. Sanderson. That third party is the
crux of the situation. I strongly suspect him of blackmail. If
you would but name him, and allow me to lure him to these rooms,
I possess a little private prison of my own into which I could
thrust him, and I venture to say that before he had passed a week
in darkness, on bread and water, we should have the truth about
this business."</p>

<p>Look you now the illogical nature of an Englishman! Poor old
Sanderson, who had come to me with a proposal to break the law of
America, seemed horror-stricken when I airily suggested the
immuring of a man in a dungeon here in England! He gazed at me in
amazement, then cast his eyes furtively about him, as if afraid a
trapdoor would drop beneath him and land him in my private
<i>oubliette</i>.</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed, Mr. Sanderson; you are perfectly safe. You
are beginning at the wrong end of this business, and it seems to
me five years of contributions to this third party without any
result might have opened the eyes of even the most influential
nobleman in England, not to mention those of his faithful
servant."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir," said Sanderson, "I must confess to you that I
have long had a suspicion of this third person, but my master has
clung to him as his only hope, and if this third person were
interfered with, I may tell you that he has deposited in London,
at some place unknown to us, a full history of the case, and if
it should happen that he disappears for more than a week at a
time, this record will be brought to light."</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Sanderson, that device is as old as Noah and his
ark. I should chance that. Let me lay this fellow by the heels,
and I will guarantee that no publicity follows."</p>

<p>Sanderson sadly shook his head.</p>

<p>"Everything might happen as you say, sir, but all that would
put us no farther forward. The only point is the liberation of my
young master. It is possible that the person unmentioned, whom we
may call Number Three, has been cheating us throughout, but that
is a matter of no consequence."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but I think it is. Suppose your young master here
and at liberty. This Number Three would continue to maintain the
power over him which he seems to have held over his father for
the last five years."</p>

<p>"I think we can prevent that, sir, if my plan is carried
out."</p>

<p>"The scheme for bribing the American officials is yours,
then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and I may say I am taking a great deal upon myself
in coming to you. I am, in fact, disobeying the implied commands
of my master; but I have seen him pay money, and very large sums
of money, to this Number Three for the last five years, and
nothing has come of it. My master is an unsuspicious man, who has
seen little of the real world, and thinks everyone as honest as
himself."</p>

<p>"Well, that may be, Mr. Sanderson, but permit me to suggest
that the one who proposes a scheme of bribery and, to put it
mildly, an evasion of the law, shows some knowledge of the lower
levels of this world, and is not quite in a position to plume
himself on his own honesty."</p>

<p>"I am coming to that, Mr. Valmont. My master knows nothing
whatever of my plan. He has given me the huge sum of money
demanded by Number Three, and he supposes that amount has been
already paid over. As a matter of fact, it has not been paid
over, and will not be until my suggestion has been carried out,
and failed. In fact, I am about to use this money, all of it if
necessary, if you will undertake the commission. I have paid
Number Three his usual monthly allowance, and will continue to do
so. I have told him my master has his proposal under
consideration; that there are still six months to come and go
upon, and that my master is not one who decides in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Number Three says there is an election in six months for
governor. What is the name of the State?"</p>

<p>Sanderson informed me. I walked to my bookcase, and took down
a current American year book, consulted it, and returned to the
table.</p>

<p>"There is no election in that State, Mr. Sanderson, for
eighteen months. Number Three is simply a blackmailer, as I have
suspected."</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir," replied Sanderson, taking a newspaper from
his pocket. "I read in this paper an account of a man immured in
a Spanish dungeon. His friends arranged it with the officials in
this way: The prisoner was certified to have died, and his body
was turned over to his relatives. Now, if that could be done in
America, it would serve two purposes. It would be the easiest way
to get my young master out of the jail. It would remain a matter
of record that he had died, therefore there could be no search
for him, as would be the case if he simply escaped. If you were
so good as to undertake this task you might perhaps see my young
master in his cell, and ask him to write to this Number Three,
with whom he is in constant communication, telling him he was
very ill. Then you could arrange with the prison doctor that this
person was informed of my young master's death."</p>

<p>"Very well, we can try that, but a blackmailer is not so
easily thrown off the scent. Once he has tasted blood he is a
human man-eating tiger. But still, there is always my private
dungeon in the background, and if your plan for silencing him
fails, I guarantee that my more drastic and equally illegal
method will be a success."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br>

LIBERATING THE WRONG MAN</h2>

<p class="first">
IT will be seen that my scruples concerning the acceptance of
this commission and my first dislike for the old man had both
faded away during the conversation which I have set down in the
preceding chapter. I saw him under the stress of deep emotion,
and latterly began to realize the tremendous chances he was
taking in contravening the will of his imperious master. If the
large sum of money was long withheld from the blackmailer,
Douglas Sanderson ran the risk of Number Three opening up
communication direct with his master. Investigation would show
that the old servant had come perilously near laying himself open
to a charge of breach of trust, and even of defalcation with
regard to the money, and all this danger he was heroically
incurring for the unselfish purpose of serving the interests of
his employer. During our long interview old Sanderson gradually
became a hero in my eyes, and entirely in opposition to the
resolution I had made at the beginning, I accepted his commission
at the end of it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my American experiences are those of which I am
least proud, and all I care to say upon the subject is that my
expedition proved completely successful. The late convict was my
companion on the <i>Arontic</i>, the first steamship sailing for
England after we reached New York from the West. Of course I knew
that two or three years roughing it in mining camps and on
ranches, followed by five years in prison, must have produced a
radical effect not only on the character, but also in the
personal appearance of a man who had undergone these privations.
Nevertheless, making due allowance for all this, I could not but
fear that the ancient English family, of which this young man was
the hope and pride, would be exceedingly disappointed with him.
In spite of the change which grooming and the wearing of a
civilized costume made, Wyoming Ed still looked much more the
criminal than the gentleman. I considered myself in honor bound
not to make any inquiries of the young man regarding his
parentage. Of course, if I had wished to possess myself of the
secret, I had but to touch a button under the table when
Sanderson left my rooms in the Imperial Flats, which would have
caused him to be shadowed and run to earth. I may also add that
the ex-prisoner volunteered no particulars about himself or his
family. Only once on board ship did he attempt to obtain some
information from me as we walked up and down the deck
together.</p>

<p>"You are acting for some one else, I suppose?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"For some one in England?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He put up the money, did he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which we took two or three turns in
silence.</p>

<p>"Of course, there's no secret about it," he said at last. "I
expected help from the other side, but Colonel Jim has been so
mighty long about it, I was afraid he'd forgotten me."</p>

<p>"Who is Colonel Jim?"</p>

<p>"Colonel Jim Baxter. Wasn't it him gave you the money?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of the man before."</p>

<p>"Then who put up the coin?"</p>

<p>"Douglas Sanderson," I replied, looking at him side-wise as I
mentioned the name. It had apparently no effect upon him. He
wrinkled his brow for a moment, then said:</p>

<p>"Well, if you never heard of Baxter, I never heard of
Sanderson."</p>

<p>This led me to suspect that Douglas Sanderson did not give me
his own name, and doubtless the address with which he had
furnished me was merely temporary. I did not cable to him from
America regarding the success of the expedition, because I could
not be certain it was a success until I was safely on English
ground, and not even then, to tell the truth. Anyhow, I wished to
leave no trail behind me, but the moment the <i>Arontic</i>
reached Liverpool, I telegraphed Sanderson to meet us that
evening at my flat.</p>

<p>He was waiting for me when Wyoming Ed and I entered together.
The old man was quite evidently in a state of nervous tension. He
had been walking up and down the room with hands clinched behind
his back, and now stood at the end farthest from the door as he
heard us approach, with his hands still clasped behind his back,
and an expression of deep anxiety upon his rugged face. All the
electric lamps were turned on, and the room was bright as
day.</p>

<p>"Have you not brought him with you?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Brought him with me?" I echoed. "Here is Wyoming Ed!"</p>

<p>The old man glared at him for a moment or two stupefied, then
moaned:</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, my God, that is not the man!" I turned to my
short-haired fellow-traveler. "You told me you were Wyoming Ed!"
He laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>"Well, in a manner of speaking, so I have been for the last
five years, but I wasn't Wyoming Ed before that. Say, old man,
are you acting for Colonel Jim Baxter?"</p>

<p>Sanderson, on whom a dozen years seemed to have fallen since
we entered the room, appeared unable to speak, and merely shook
his head in a hopeless sort of way.</p>

<p>"I say, boys," ejaculated the ex-convict, with an uneasy
laugh, half comic, half bewildered, "this is a sort of mix-up,
isn't it? I wish Colonel Jim was here to explain. I say, Boss,"
he cried suddenly, turning sharp on me, "this here misfit's not
my fault. I didn't change the children in the cradle. You don't
intend to send me back to that hellhole, do you?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, "not if you tell the truth. Sit down."</p>

<p>The late prisoner seated himself in a chair as close to the
door as possible, hitching a little nearer as he sat down. His
face had taken on a sharp, crafty aspect like that of a trapped
rat.</p>

<p>"You are perfectly safe," I assured him. "Sit over here by the
table. Even if you bolted through that door, you couldn't get out
of this flat. Mr. Sanderson, take a chair."</p>

<p>The old man sank despondently into the one nearest at hand. I
pressed a button, and when my servant entered I said to him:</p>

<p>"Bring some cognac and Scotch whisky, glasses, and two siphons
of soda."</p>

<p>"You haven't got any Kentucky or Canadian?" asked the
prisoner, moistening his lips. The jail whiteness in his face was
now accentuated by the pallor of fear, and the haunted look of
the escaped convict glimmered from his eyes. In spite of the
comfort I had attempted to bestow upon him, he knew that he had
been rescued in mistake for another, and for the first time since
he left prison realized he was among strangers, and not among
friends. In his trouble he turned to the beverage of his native
continent.</p>

<p>"Bring a bottle of Canadian whisky," I said to the servant,
who disappeared, and shortly returned with what I had ordered. I
locked the door after him, and put the key in my pocket.</p>

<p>"What am I to call you?" I asked the ex-convict. With a forced
laugh he said: "You can call me Jack for short."</p>

<p>"Very well, Jack, help yourself," and he poured out a very
liberal glass of the Dominion liquor, refusing to dilute it with
soda. Sanderson took Scotch, and I helped myself to a <i>petit
verre</i> of brandy.</p>

<p>"Now, Jack," I began, "I may tell you plainly that if I wished
to send you back to prison, I could not do so without
incriminating myself. You are legally dead, and you have now a
chance to begin life anew, an opportunity of which I hope you
will take advantage. If you were to apply three weeks from to-day
at the prison doors, they would not dare admit you. You are dead.
Does that console you?"</p>

<p>"Well, squire, you can bet your bottom dollar I never thought
I'd be pleased to hear I was dead, but I'm glad if it's all fixed
as you say, and you can bet your last pair of boots I'm going to
keep out of the jug in future if I can."</p>

<p>"That's right. Now, I can promise that if you answer all my
questions truthfully, you shall be given money enough to afford
you a new beginning in life."</p>

<p>"Good enough," said Jack briefly.</p>

<p>"You were known in prison as Wyoming Ed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"If that was not your name, why did you use it?"</p>

<p>"Because Colonel Jim, on the train, asked me to do that. He
said it would give him a pull in England to get me free."</p>

<p>"Did you know Wyoming Ed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, he was one of us three that held up the
train."</p>

<p>"What became of him?"</p>

<p>"He was shot dead."</p>

<p>"By one of the passengers?"</p>

<p>There was silence, during which the old man groaned and bowed
his head. Jack was studying the floor. Then he looked up at me
and said:</p>

<p>"You don't expect me to give a pal away, do you?"</p>

<p>"As that pal has given you away for the last five years, it
seems to me you need not show very much consideration for
him."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure he did."</p>

<p>"I am; but never mind that point. Colonel Jim Baxter shot
Wyoming Ed and killed him. Why?"</p>

<p>"See here, my friend, you're going a little too fast. I didn't
say that."</p>

<p>He reached somewhat defiantly for the bottle from Canada.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I said, rising quietly, and taking possession of
the bottle myself, "it grieves me more than I can say to restrict
my hospitality. I have never done such a thing in my life before,
but this is not a drinking bout; it is a very serious conference.
The whisky you have already taken has given you a bogus courage
and a false view of things. Are you going to tell me the truth,
or are you not?"</p>

<p>Jack pondered on this for a while, then he said:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I'm perfectly willing to tell you the truth as fur
as it concerns myself, but I don't want to rat on, a friend."</p>

<p>"As I have said, he isn't your friend. He told you to take the
name of Wyoming Ed, so that he might blackmail the father of
Wyoming Ed. He has done so for the last five years, living in
luxury here in London, and not moving a finger to help you. In
fact, nothing would appall him more than to learn that you are
now in this country. By this time he has probably received the
news from the prison doctor that you are dead, and so thinks
himself safe forever."</p>

<p>"If you can prove that to me&mdash;" said Jack.</p>

<p>"I can and will," I interrupted; then, turning to Sanderson, I
demanded:</p>

<p>"When are you to meet this man next?"</p>

<p>"To-night, at nine o'clock," he answered. "His monthly payment
is due, and he is clamoring for the large sum I told you of."</p>

<p>"Where do you meet him? In London?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"At your master's town house?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Will you take us there, and place us where we can see him and
he can't see us?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I trust to your honor, Mr. Valmont. A closed carriage
will call for me at eight, and you can accompany me. Still, after
all, Mr. Valmont, we have no assurance that he is the same person
this young man refers to."</p>

<p>"I am certain he is. He does not go under the name of Colonel
Jim Baxter, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The convict had been looking from one to the other of us
during this colloquy. Suddenly he drew his chair up closer to the
table.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said; "you fellows are square, I can see that,
and after all's said and done, you're the man that got me out of
clink. Now, I half suspicion you're right about Colonel Jim, but
anyhow, I'll tell you exactly what happened. Colonel Jim was a
Britisher, and I suppose that's why he and Wyoming Ed chummed
together a good deal. We called Jim Baxter colonel, but he never
said he was a colonel or anything else. I was told he belonged to
the British army, and that something happened in India so that he
had to light out. He never talked about himself, but he was a
mighty taking fellow when he laid out to please anybody, We
called him colonel because he was so straight in the back, and
walked as if he were on parade. When this young English
tenderfoot came out, he and the colonel got to be as thick as
thieves, and the colonel won a good deal of money from him at
cards, but that didn't make any difference in their friendship.
The colonel most always won when he played cards, and perhaps
that's what started the talk about why he left the British army.
He was the luckiest beggar I ever knew in that line of business.
We all met in the rush to the new gold fields, which didn't pan
out worth a cent, and one after another of the fellows quit and
went somewhere else. But Wyoming Ed, he held on, even after
Colonel Jim wanted to quit. As long as there were plenty of
fellows there, Colonel Jim never lacked money, although he didn't
dig it out of the ground, but when the population thinned down to
only a few of us, then we all struck hard times. Now, I knew
Colonel Jim was going to hold up a train. He asked me if I would
join him, and I said I would if there wasn't too many in the
gang. I'd been into that business afore, and I knew there was no
greater danger than to have a whole mob of fellows. Three men can
hold up a train better than three dozen. Everybody's scared
except the express messenger, and it's generally easy to settle
him, for he stands where the light is, and we shoot from the
dark. Well, I thought at first Wyoming Ed was on to the scheme,
because, when we were waiting in the cut to signal the train, he
talked about us going on with her to San Francisco, but I thought
he was only joking. I guess that Colonel Jim imagined that when
it came to the pinch Ed wouldn't back out and leave us in the
lurch; he knew Ed was as brave as a lion. In the cut, where the
train would be on the up grade, the colonel got his lantern
ready, lit it, and wrapped a thin red silk handkerchief round it.
The express was timed to pass up there about midnight, but it was
near one o'clock when her headlight came in sight. We knew all
the passengers would be in bed in the sleepers, and asleep in the
smoking car and the day coach. We didn't intend to meddle with
them. The colonel had brought a stick or two of dynamite from the
mines, and was going to blow open the safe in the express car,
and climb out with whatever was inside.</p>

<p>"The train stopped to the signal all right, and the colonel
fired a couple of shots just to let the engineer know we meant
business. The engineer and fireman at once threw up their hands,
then the colonel turns to Ed, who was standing there like a man
poleaxed, and says to him mighty sharp, just like if he was
speaking to a regiment of soldiers:</p>

<p>"'You keep these two men covered. Come on, Jack!' he says to
me, and then we steps up to the door of the express car, which
the fellow inside had got locked and bolted. The colonel fires
his revolver in through the lock, then flung his shoulder ag'in
the door, and it went in with a crash, which was followed
instantly by another crash, for the little expressman was game
right through. He had put out the lights and was blazing away at
the open door. The colonel sprang for cover inside the car, and
wasn't touched, but one of the shots took me just above the knee,
and broke my leg, so I went down in a heap. The minute the
colonel counted seven shots he was on to that express messenger
like a tiger, and had him tied up in a hard knot before you could
shake a stick. Then quick as a wink he struck a match and lit a
lamp. Plucky as the express messenger was, he looked scared to
death, and now, when Colonel Jim held a pistol to his head, he
gave up the keys and told him how to open the safe. I had fallen
back against the corner of the car, inside, and was groaning with
pain. Colonel Jim was scooping out the money from the shelves of
the safe and stuffing it into a sack.</p>

<p>"'Are you hurt, Jack?' he cried. </p>

<p>"'Yes, my leg's broke.'</p>

<p>"'Don't let that trouble you; we'll get you clear all right.
Do you think you can ride your horse?'</p>

<p>"'I don't believe it,' said I; 'I guess I'm done fur,' and I
thought I was.</p>

<p>"Colonel Jim never looked round, but he went through that safe
in a way that'd make your hair curl, throwing aside the bulky
packages after tearing them open, taking only cash, which he
thrust into a bag he had with him, till he was loaded like a
millionaire. Then suddenly he swore, for the train began to
move.</p>

<p>"'What is that fool Ed doing?' he shouted, rising to his
feet.</p>

<p>"At that minute Ed came in, pistol in each hand, and his face
ablaze.</p>

<p>"'Here, you cursed thief!' he cried, 'I didn't come with you
to rob a train!'</p>

<p>"'Get outside, you fool!' roared Colonel Jim, 'get outside and
stop this train. Jack has got his leg broke. Don't come another
step toward me or I'll kill you!'</p>

<p>"But Ed, he walked right on, Colonel Jim backing, then there
was a shot that rang like cannon fire in the closed car, and Ed
fell forward on his face. Colonel Jim turned him over, and I saw
he had been hit square in the middle of the forehead. The train
was now going at good speed, and we were already miles away from
where our horses were tied. I never heard a man swear like
Colonel Jim. He went through the pockets of Ed, and took a bundle
of papers that was inside his coat, and this he stuffed away in
his own clothes. Then he turned to me, and his voice was like a
lamb:</p>

<p>"'Jack, old man,' he said, 'I can't help you. They're going to
nab you, but not for murder. The expressman there will be your
witness. It isn't murder anyhow on my part, but self-defense. You
saw he was coming at me when I warned him to keep away.'</p>

<p>"All this he said in a loud voice, for the expressman to hear,
then he bent over to me and whispered:</p>

<p>"'I'll get the best lawyer I can for you, but I'm afraid
they're bound to convict you, and if they do, I will spend every
penny of this money to get you free. You call yourself Wyoming Ed
at the trial. I've taken all this man's papers so that he can't
be identified. And don't you worry if you're sentenced, for
remember I'll be working night and day for you, and if money can
get you out, you'll be got out, because these papers will help me
to get the cash required. Ed's folks are rich in England, so
they'll fork over to get you out if you pretend to be him.' With
that he bade me good-by and jumped off the train. There,
gentlemen, that's the whole story just as it happened, and that's
why I thought it was Colonel Jim had sent you to get me
free."</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt in my mind that the convict
had told the exact truth, and that night, at nine o'clock, he
identified Major Renn as the former Colonel Jim Baxter. Sanderson
placed us in a gallery where we could see, but could not hear.
The old man seemed determined that we should not know where we
were, and took every precaution to keep us in the dark. I suppose
he put us out of earshot, so that if the major mentioned the name
of the nobleman we should not be any the wiser. We remained in
the gallery for some time after the major had left before
Sanderson came to us again, carrying with him a packet.</p>

<p>"The carriage is waiting at the door," he said, "and with your
permission, Mr. Valmont, I will accompany you to your flat."</p>

<p>I smiled at the old man's extreme caution, but he continued
very gravely:</p>

<p>"It is not that, Mr. Valmont. I wish to consult with you, and
if you will accept it, I have another commission to offer."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I hope it is not so unsavory as the last."
But to this the old man made no response.</p>

<p>There was silence in the carriage as we drove back to my flat.
Sanderson had taken the precaution of pulling down the blinds of
the carriage, which he need not have troubled to do, for, as I
have said, it would have been the simplest matter in the world
for me to have discovered who his employer was, if I had desired
to know. As a matter of fact, I do not know to this day whom he
represented.</p>

<p>Once more in my room, with the electric light turned on, I was
shocked and astonished to see the expression on Sanderson's face.
It was the face of a man who would grimly commit murder and hang
for it. If ever the thirst for vengeance was portrayed on a human
countenance, it was on his that night. He spoke very quietly,
laying down the packet before him on the table.</p>

<p>"I think you will agree with me," he said, "that no punishment
on earth is too severe for that creature calling himself Major
Renn."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to shoot him dead in the streets of London
to-morrow," said the convict, "if you give the word."</p>

<p>Sanderson went on implacably: "He not only murdered the son,
but for five years has kept the father in an agony of sorrow and
apprehension, bleeding him of money all the time, which was the
least of his crimes. To-morrow I shall tell my master that his
son has been dead these five years, and heavy as that blow must
prove, it will be mitigated by the fact that his son died an
honest and honorable man. I thank you for offering to kill this
vile criminal. I intend that he shall die, but not so quickly or
so mercifully."</p>

<p>Here he untied the packet, and took from it a photograph,
which he handed to the convict.</p>

<p>"Do you recognize that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; that's Wyoming Ed as he appeared at the mine; as,
indeed, he appeared when he was shot."</p>

<p>The photograph Sanderson then handed to me.</p>

<p>"An article that I read about you in the paper, Mr. Valmont,
said you could impersonate anybody. Can you impersonate this
young man?"</p>

<p>"There's no difficulty in that," I replied.</p>

<p>"Then will you do this? I wish you two to dress in that
fashion. I shall give you particulars of the haunts of Major
Renn. I want you to meet him together and separately, as often as
you can, until you drive him mad or to suicide. He believes you
to be dead," said Sanderson, addressing Jack. "I am certain he
has the news, by his manner to-night. He is extremely anxious to
get the lump sum of money which I have been holding back from
him. You may address him, for he will recognize your voice as
well as your person, but I think Mr. Valmont had better not
speak, as then he might know it was not the voice of my poor
young master. I suggest that you meet him first together, always
at night. The rest I leave in your hands, Monsieur Valmont."</p>

<p>With that the old man rose and left us.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should stop this narration here, for I have often
wondered if practically I am guilty of manslaughter.</p>

<p>We did not meet Major Renn together, but arranged that he
should encounter Jack under one lamp-post, and me under the next.
It was just after midnight, and the streets were practically
deserted. The theater crowds had gone, and the traffic was
represented by the last "buses, and a belated cab now and then.
Major Renn came down the steps of his club, and under the first
lamp-post, with the light shining full upon him, Jack the convict
stepped forth.</p>

<p>"Colonel Jim," he said, "Ed and I are waiting for you. There
were three in that robbery, and one was a traitor. His dead
comrades ask the traitor to join them."</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>The major staggered back against the lamp-post, drew his hand
across his brow, and muttered, Jack told me afterwards:</p>

<p>"I must stop drinking! I must stop drinking!"</p>

<p>Then he pulled himself together, and walked rapidly toward the
next lamp-post. I stood out square in front of him, but made no
sound. He looked at me with distended eyes, while Jack shouted
out in his boisterous voice, that had no doubt often echoed over
the plain:</p>

<p>"Come on, Wyoming Ed, and never mind him. He must follow."</p>

<p>Then he gave a war whoop. The major did not turn round, but
continued to stare at me, breathing stertorously, like a person
with apoplexy. I slowly pushed back my hat, and on my brow he saw
the red mark of a bullet hole. He threw up his hands and fell
with a crash to the pavement.</p>

<p>"Heart failure" was the verdict of the coroner's jury.</p>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br>

THE FASCINATING LADY ALICIA</h2>

<p class="first">
MANY Englishmen, if you speak to them of me, indulge
themselves in a detraction that I hope they will not mind my
saying is rarely graced by the delicacy of innuendo with which
some of my own countrymen attempt to diminish whatever merit I
possess. Mr. Spenser Hale, of Scotland Yard, whose lack of
imagination I have so often endeavored to amend, alas without
perceptible success, was good enough to say, after I had begun
these reminiscences, which he read with affected scorn, that I
was wise in setting down my successes, because the life of
Methuselah himself would not be long enough to chronicle my
failures, and the man to whom this was said replied that it was
only my artfulness, a word of which these people are very fond;
that I intended to use my successes as bait, issue a small
pamphlet filled with them, and then record my failures in a
thousand volumes, after the plan of a Chinese encyclopedia,
selling these to the public on the installment plan.</p>

<p>Ah, well; it is not for me to pass comment on such
observations. Every profession is marred by its little
jealousies, and why should the coterie of detection be exempt? I
hope I may never follow an example so deleterious, and thus be
tempted to express my contempt for the stupidity with which, as
all persons know, the official detective system of England is
imbued. I have had my failures, of course. Did I ever pretend
to be otherwise than human? But what has been the cause of
these failures? They have arisen through the conservatism of
the English. When there is a mystery to be solved, the average
Englishman almost invariably places it in the hands of the
regular police. When these good people are utterly baffled; when
their big boots have crushed out all evidences that the grounds
may have had to offer to a discerning mind; when their clumsy
hands have obliterated the clews which are everywhere around
them, I am at last called in, and if I fail, they say:</p>

<p>"What could you expect; he is a Frenchman."</p>

<p>This was exactly what happened in the case of Lady Alicia's
emeralds. For two months the regular police were not only
befogged, but they blatantly sounded the alarm to every thief in
Europe. All the pawnbrokers' shops of Great Britain were
ransacked, as if a robber of so valuable a collection would be
foolish enough to take it to a pawnbroker. Of course, the police
say that they thought the thief would dismantle the cluster and
sell the gems separately. As to this necklace of emeralds,
possessing as it does an historical value which is probably in
excess of its intrinsic worth, what more natural than that the
holder of it should open negotiations with its rightful owner,
and thus make more money by quietly restoring it than by its
dismemberment and sale piecemeal? But such a fuss was kicked up,
such a <i>furore</i> created, that it is no wonder the receiver
of the goods lay low and said nothing. In vain were all ports
giving access to the Continent watched; in vain were the police
of France, Belgium, and Holland warned to look out for this
treasure. Two valuable months were lost, and then the Marquis of
Blair sent for me! I maintain that the case was hopeless from the
moment I took it up.</p>

<p>It may be asked why the Marquis of Blair allowed the regular
police to blunder along for two precious months, but anyone who
is acquainted with that nobleman will not wonder that he clung so
long to a forlorn hope. Very few members of the House of Peers
are richer than Lord Blair, and still fewer more penurious. He
maintained that, as he paid his taxes, he was entitled to
protection from theft; that it was the duty of the Government to
restore the gems, and if this proved impossible, to make
compensation for them. This theory is not accepted in the English
courts, and while Scotland Yard did all it could during those two
months, what but failure was to be expected from its limited
mental equipment?</p>

<p>When I arrived at the Manor of Blair, as his lordship's very
ugly and somewhat modern mansion house is termed, I was instantly
admitted to his presence. I had been summoned from London by a
letter in his lordship's own hand, on which the postage was not
paid. It was late in the afternoon when I arrived, and our first
conference was what might be termed futile. It was taken up
entirely with haggling about terms, the marquis endeavoring to
beat down the price of my services to a sum so insignificant that
it would barely have paid my expenses from London to Blair and
back. Such bargaining is intensely distasteful to me. When the
marquis found all his offers declined with a politeness which
left no opening for anger on his part, he endeavored to induce me
to take up the case on a commission contingent upon my recovery
of the gems, and when I had declined this for the twentieth time
darkness had come on, and the gong rang for dinner. I dined alone
in a <i>salle à manger</i>, which appeared to be set apart for
those calling at the mansion on business, and the meagerness of
the fare, together with the indifferent nature of the claret,
strengthened my determination to return to London as early as
possible next morning.</p>

<p>When the repast was finished the dignified serving man said
gravely to me:</p>

<p>"The Lady Alicia asks if you will be good enough to give her a
few moments in the drawing-room, sir."</p>

<p>I followed the man to the drawing-room, and found the young
lady seated at the piano, on which she was strumming idly and
absent-mindedly, but with a touch, nevertheless, that indicated
advanced excellence in the art of music. She was not dressed as
one who had just risen from the dining table, but was somewhat
primly and commonly attired, looking more like a cottager's
daughter than a member of the great county family.</p>

<p>Her head was small, and crowned with a mass of jet black hair.
My first impression on entering the large, rather dimly lighted
room was unfavorable, but that vanished instantly under the charm
of a manner so graceful and vivacious that in a moment I seemed
to be standing in a brilliant Parisian <i>salon</i> rather than
in the somber drawing-room of an English country house. Every
poise of her dainty head; every gesture of those small, perfect
hands; every modulated tone of the voice, whether sparkling with
laughter or caressing in confidential speech, reminded me of the
<i>grandes dames</i> of my own land. It was strange to find this
perfect human flower amid the gloomy ugliness of a huge square
house built in the time of the Georges; but I remembered now that
the Blairs are the English equivalent of the de Bellairs of
France, from which family sprang the fascinating Marquise de
Bellairs, who adorned the court of Louis XIV. Here, advancing
toward me, was the very reincarnation of the lovely marquise, who
gave luster to this dull world nearly three hundred years ago.
Ah, after all, what are the English but a conquered race! I often
forget this, and I trust I never remind them of it, but it
enables one to forgive them much. A vivid twentieth-century
marquise was Lady Alicia, in all except attire. What a dream some
of our Parisian dress artists could have made of her, and here
she was immured in this dull English house in the high-necked
costume of a laborer's wife.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Monsieur Valmont," she cried in French of almost
faultless intonation. "I am so glad you have arrived," and she
greeted me as if I were an old friend of the family. There was
nothing of condescension in her manner; no display of her own
affability, while at the same time teaching me my place and the
difference in our stations of life. I can stand the rudeness of
the nobility, but I detest their condescension. No; Lady Alicia
was a true de Bellairs, and in my confusion, bending over her
slender hand, I said:</p>

<p>"Madame la Marquise, it is a privilege to extend to you my
most respectful salutations."</p>

<p>She laughed at this quietly, with the melting laugh of the
nightingale.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you mistake my title. Although my uncle is a
marquis, I am but Lady Alicia."</p>

<p>"Your pardon, my lady. For the moment I was back in that
scintillating court which surrounded Louis le Grand."</p>

<p>"How flatteringly you introduce yourself, monsieur. In the
gallery upstairs there is a painting of the Marquise de Bellairs,
and when I show it to you to-morrow, you will then understand how
charmingly you have pleased a vain woman by your reference to
that beautiful lady. But I must not talk in this frivolous
strain, monsieur. There is serious business to be considered, and
I assure you I looked forward to your coming, monsieur, with the
eagerness of Sister Anne on the tower of Bluebeard."</p>

<p>I fear my expression as I bowed to her must have betrayed my
gratification at hearing these words, so confidentially uttered
by lips so sweet, while the glance of her lovely eyes was even
more eloquent than her words. Instantly I felt ashamed of my
chaffering over terms with her uncle; instantly I forgot my
resolution to depart on the morrow; instantly I resolved to be of
what assistance I could to this dainty lady. Alas! the heart of
Valmont is to-day as unprotected against the artillery of
inspiring eyes as ever it was in his extreme youth.</p>

<p>"This house," she continued vivaciously, "has been practically
in a state of siege for two months. I could take none of my usual
walks in the gardens, on the lawns, or through the park without
some clumsy policeman in uniform crashing his way through the
bushes, or some detective in plain clothes accosting me and
questioning me under the pretense that he was a stranger who had
lost his way. The lack of all subtlety in our police is something
deplorable. I am sure the real criminal might have passed through
their hands a dozen times unmolested, while our poor innocent
servants, and the strangers within our gates, were made to feel
that the stern eye of the law was upon them night and day."</p>

<p>The face of the young lady was an entrancing picture of
animated indignation as she gave utterance to this truism which
her countrymen are so slow to appreciate. I experienced a glow of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Yes," she went on, "they sent down from London an army of
stupid men, who have kept our household in a state of abject
terror for eight long weeks, and where are the emeralds?"</p>

<p>As she suddenly asked this question, in the most Parisian of
accents, with a little outward spreading of the hand, a flash of
the eye, and a toss of the head, the united effect was something
indescribable through the limitations of the language I am
compelled to use.</p>

<p>"Well, monsieur, your arrival has put to flight this tiresome
brigade, if, indeed, the word flight is not too airy a term to
use toward a company so elephantine, and I assure you a sigh of
relief has gone up from the whole household with the exception of
my uncle. I said to him at dinner to-night: 'If Monsieur Valmont
had been induced to take an interest in the Case at first, the
jewels would have been in my possession long before
to-night.'"</p>

<p>"Ah, my lady," I protested, "I fear you overrate my poor
ability. It is quite true that if I had been called in on the
night of the robbery, my chances of success would have been
infinitely greater than they are now."</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she cried, clasping her hands over her knees and
leaning toward me, hypnotizing me with those starry eyes,
"Monsieur, I am perfectly confident that before a week is past
you will restore the necklace, if such restoration be possible. I
have said so from the first. Now, am I right in my conjecture,
monsieur, that you come here alone; that you bring with you no
train of followers and assistants?"</p>

<p>"That is as you have stated it my lady."</p>

<p>"I was sure of it. It is to be a contest of trained mentality
in opposition to our two months' experience of brute force."</p>

<p>Never before had I felt such ambition to succeed, and a
determination not to disappoint took full possession of me.
Appreciation is a needed stimulant, and here it was offered to me
in its most intoxicating form. Ah, Valmont, Valmont, will you
never grow old! I am sure that at this moment, if I had been
eighty, the same thrill of enthusiasm would have tingled to my
fingers' ends. Leave the Manor of Blair in the morning? Not for
the Bank of France!</p>

<p>"Has my uncle acquainted you with particulars of the
robbery?"</p>

<p>"No, madame, we were talking of other things."</p>

<p>The lady leaned back in her low chair, partially closed her
eyes, and breathed a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"I can well imagine the subject of your conversation," she
said at last. "The Marquis of Blair was endeavoring to impose
usurer's terms upon you, while you, nobly scorning such mercenary
considerations, had perhaps resolved to leave us at the earliest
opportunity."</p>

<p>"I assure you, my lady, that if any such conclusion had been
arrived at on my part, it vanished the moment I was privileged to
set foot in this drawing-room."</p>

<p>"It is kind of you to say that, monsieur, but you must not
allow your conversation with my uncle to prejudice you against
him. He is an old man now, and, of course, has his fancies. You
would think him mercenary, perhaps, and so he is; but then so,
too, am I. Oh, yes, I am, monsieur, frightfully mercenary. To be
mercenary, I believe, means to be fond of money. No one is fonder
of money than I, except, perhaps, my uncle; but you see,
monsieur, we occupy the two extremes. He is fond of money to
hoard it; I am fond of money to spend it. I am fond of money for
the things it will buy. I should like to scatter largesse as did
my fair ancestress in France. I should love a manor house in the
country, and a mansion in May-fair. I could wish to make everyone
around me happy if the expenditure of money would do it."</p>

<p>"That is a form of money love, Lady Alicia, which will find a
multitude of admirers."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head and laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"I should so dislike to forfeit your esteem, Monsieur Valmont,
and therefore I shall not reveal the depth of my cupidity. You
will learn that probably from my uncle, and then you will
understand my extreme anxiety for the recovery of these
jewels."</p>

<p>"<i>Are</i> they very valuable?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; the necklace consists of twenty stones, no one of
which weighs less than an ounce. Altogether, I believe, they
amount to two thousand four hundred or two thousand five hundred
carats, and their intrinsic value is twenty pounds a carat at
least. So you see that means nearly fifty thousand pounds, yet
even this sum is trivial compared with what it involves. There is
something like a million at stake, together with my coveted manor
house in the country, and my equally coveted mansion in Mayfair.
All this is within my grasp if I can but recover the
emeralds."</p>

<p>The girl blushed prettily as she noticed how intently I
regarded her while she evolved this tantalizing mystery. I
thought there was a trace of embarrassment in her laugh when she
cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, what will you think of me when you understand the
situation? Pray, pray do not judge me harshly. I assure you the
position I aim at will be used for the good of others as well as
for my own pleasure. If my uncle does not make a confidant of
you, I must take my courage in both hands and give you all the
particulars, but not to-night. Of course, if one is to unravel
such a snarl as that in which we find ourselves, he must be made
aware of every particular, must he not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my lady."</p>

<p>"Very well, Monsieur Valmont, I shall supply any deficiencies
that occur in my uncle's conversation with you. There is one
point on which I should like to warn you. Both my uncle and the
police have made up their minds that a certain young man is the
culprit. The police found several clews which apparently led in
his direction, but they were unable to find enough to justify his
arrest. At first I could have sworn he had nothing whatever to do
with the matter, but lately I am not so sure. All I ask of you
until we secure another opportunity of consulting together is to
preserve an open mind. Please do not allow my uncle to prejudice
you against him."</p>

<p>"What is the name of this young man?"</p>

<p>"He is the Honorable John Haddon."</p>

<p>"The Honorable! Is he a person who could do so dishonorable an
action?"</p>

<p>The young lady shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am almost sure he would not, and yet one never can tell. I
think at the present moment there are one or two noble lords in
prison, but their crimes have not been mere vulgar
housebreaking."</p>

<p>"Am I to infer, Lady Alicia, that you are in possession of
certain facts unknown either to your uncle or the police?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but do these facts tend to incriminate the young
man?"</p>

<p>Again the young lady leaned back in her chair and gazed past
me, a wrinkle of perplexity on her fair brow. Then she said very
slowly:</p>

<p>"You will understand, Monsieur Valmont, how loath I am to
speak against one who was formerly a friend. If he had been
content to remain a friend, I am sure this incident, which has
caused us all such worry and trouble, would never have happened.
I do not wish to dwell on what my uncle will tell you was a very
unpleasant episode, but the Honorable John Haddon is a poor man,
and it is quite out of the question for one brought up as I have
been to marry into poverty. He was very headstrong and reckless
about the matter, and involved my uncle in a bitter quarrel while
discussing it, much to my chagrin and disappointment. It is as
necessary for him to marry wealth as it is for me to make a good
match, but he could not be brought to see that. Oh, he is not at
all a sensible young man, and my former friendship for him has
ceased. Yet I should dislike very much to take any action that
might harm him, therefore I have spoken to no one but you about
the evidence that is in my hands, and this you must treat as
entirely confidential, giving no hint to my uncle, who is already
bitter enough against Mr. Haddon."</p>

<p>"Does this evidence convince you that he stole the
necklace?"</p>

<p>"No; I do not believe that he actually stole it, but I am
persuaded he was an accessory after the fact&mdash;is that the
legal term? Now, Monsieur Valmont, we will say no more to-night.
If I talk any longer about this crisis I shall not sleep, and I
wish, assured of your help, to attack the situation with a very
clear mind tomorrow."</p>

<p>When I retired to my room, I found that I, too, could not
sleep, although I needed a clear mind to face the problem of
to-morrow. It is difficult for me to describe accurately the
effect this interview had upon my mind, but to use a bodily
simile, I may say that it seemed as if I had indulged too freely
in a subtle champagne which appeared exceedingly excellent at
first, but from which the exhilaration had now departed. No man
could have been more completely under a spell than I was when
Lady Alicia's eyes first told me more than her lips revealed; but
although I had challenged her right to the title "mercenary" when
she applied it to herself, I could not but confess that her
nonchalant recital regarding the friend who desired to be a lover
jarred upon me. I found my sympathy extending itself to that
unknown young man, on whom it appeared the shadow of suspicion
already rested. I was confident that if he had actually taken the
emeralds it was not at all from motives of cupidity. Indeed, that
was practically shown by the fact that Scotland Yard found itself
unable to trace the jewels, which at least they might have done
if the necklace had been sold either as a whole or dismembered.
Of course, an emerald weighing an ounce is by no means unusual.
The Hope emerald, for example, weighs six ounces, and the gem
owned by the Duke of Devonshire measures two and a quarter inches
through its greatest diameter. Nevertheless, such a constellation
as the Blair emeralds was not to be disposed of very easily, and
I surmised no attempt had been made either to sell them or to
raise money upon them. Now that I had removed myself from the
glamour of her presence, I began to suspect that the young lady,
after all, although undoubtedly possessing the brilliancy of her
jewels, retained also something of their hardness. There had been
no expression of sympathy for the discarded friend; it was too
evident, recalling what had latterly passed between us, that the
young woman's sole desire, and a perfectly natural desire, was to
recover her missing treasure. There was something behind all this
which I could not comprehend, and I resolved in the morning to
question the Marquis of Blair as shrewdly as he cared to allow.
Failing him, I should cross-question the niece in a somewhat
dryer light than that which had enshrouded me during this
interesting evening. I care not who knows it, but I have been
befooled more than once by a woman, and I determined that in
clear daylight I should resist the hypnotizing influence of those
glorious eyes. <i>Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!</i> How easy it is for me
to make good resolutions when I am far from temptation!</p>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br>

WHERE THE EMERALDS WERE FOUND</h2>

<p class="first">
IT was ten o'clock next morning when I was admitted to the
study of the aged bachelor Marquis of Blair. His keen eyes looked
through and through me as I seated myself before him. "Well!" he
said shortly.</p>

<p>"My lord," I began deliberately, "I know nothing more of the
case than was furnished by the accounts I have read in the
newspapers. Two months have elapsed since the robbery. Every day
that passed made the detection of the criminal more difficult. I
do not wish to waste either my time or your money on a forlorn
hope. If, therefore, you will be good enough to place me in
possession of all the facts known to you, I shall tell you at
once whether or not I can take up the case."</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to give you the name of the criminal?" asked
his lordship.</p>

<p>"Is his name known to you?" I asked in return.</p>

<p>"Yes. John Haddon stole the necklace."</p>

<p>"Did you give that name to the police?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why didn't they arrest him?"</p>

<p>"Because the evidence against him is so small, and the
improbability of his having committed the crime is so great."</p>

<p>"What is the evidence against him?"</p>

<p>His lordship spoke with the dry deliberation of an aged
solicitor.</p>

<p>"The robbery was committed on the night of October the fifth.
All day there had been a heavy rain, and the grounds were wet.
For reasons into which I do not care to enter, John Haddon was
familiar with this house and with our grounds. He was well known
to my servants, and, unfortunately, popular with them, for he is
an open-handed spendthrift. The estate of his elder brother, Lord
Steffenham, adjoins my own to the west, and Lord Steffenham's
house is three miles from where we sit. On the night of the fifth
a ball was given in the mansion of Lord Steffenham, to which, of
course, my niece and myself were invited, and which invitation we
accepted. I had no quarrel with the elder brother. It was known
to John Haddon that my niece intended to wear her necklace of
emeralds. The robbery occurred at a time when most crimes of that
nature are committed in country houses, namely, while we were at
dinner, an hour during which the servants are almost invariably
in the lower part of the house. In October the days are getting
short. The night was exceptionally dark, for, although the rain
had ceased, not a star was visible. The thief placed a ladder
against the sill of one of the upper windows, opened it, and came
in. He must have been perfectly familiar with the house, for
there are evidences that he went direct to the boudoir where the
jewel case had been carelessly left on my niece's dressing table
when she came down to dinner. It had been taken from the strong
room about an hour before. The box was locked, but, of course,
that made no difference. The thief wrenched the lid off, breaking
the lock, stole the necklace, and escaped by the way he
came."</p>

<p>"Did he leave the window open and the ladder in place?"
"Yes."</p>

<p>"Doesn't that strike you as very extraordinary?"</p>

<p>"No. I do not assert that he is a professional burglar, who
would take all the precautions against the discovery that might
have been expected from one of the craft. Indeed, the man's
carelessness in going straight across the country to his
brother's house, and leaving footsteps in the soft earth, easily
traceable almost to the very boundary fence, shows he is
incapable of any serious thought."</p>

<p>"Is John Haddon rich?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't a penny."</p>

<p>"Did you go to the ball that night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I had promised to go."</p>

<p>"Was John Haddon there?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but he appeared late. He should have been present at the
opening, and his brother was seriously annoyed by his absence.
When he did come he acted in a wild and reckless manner, which
gave the guests the impression that he had been drinking. Both my
niece and myself were disgusted with his actions."</p>

<p>"Do you think your niece suspects him?"</p>

<p>"She certainly did not at first, and was indignant when I told
her, coming home from the ball, that her jewels were undoubtedly
in Steffenham House, even though they were not round her neck,
but latterly I think her opinion has changed."</p>

<p>"To go back a moment. Did any of your servants see him
prowling about the place?"</p>

<p>"They all say they didn't, but I myself saw him, just before
dusk, coming across the fields toward this house, and next
morning we found the same footprints both going and coming. It
seems to me the circumstantial evidence is rather strong."</p>

<p>"It's a pity that no one but yourself saw him. What more
evidence are the authorities waiting for?"</p>

<p>"They are waiting until he attempts to dispose of the
jewels."</p>

<p>"You think, then, he has not done so up to date?"</p>

<p>"I think he will never do so."</p>

<p>"Then why did he steal them?"</p>

<p>"To prevent the marriage of my niece with Jonas Carter, of
Sheffield, to whom she is betrothed. They were to be married
early in the new year."</p>

<p>"My lord, you amaze me. If Mr. Carter and Lady Alicia are
engaged, why should the theft of the jewels interfere with the
ceremony?"</p>

<br>

<p class="caption">
Mr. Jonas Carter</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>"Mr. Jonas Carter is a most estimable man, who, however, does
not move in our sphere of life. He is connected with the steel or
cutlery industry, and is a person of great wealth, rising upward
of a million, with a large estate in Derbyshire, and a house
fronting Hyde Park, in London. He is a very strict business man,
and both my niece and myself agree that he is also an eligible
man. I myself am rather strict in matters of business, and I must
admit that Mr. Carter showed a very generous spirit in arranging
the preliminaries of the engagement with me. When Alicia's father
died he had run through all the money he himself possessed or
could borrow from his friends. Although a man of noble birth, I
never liked him. He was married to my only sister. The Blair
emeralds, as perhaps you know, descend down the female line.
They, therefore, came to my niece from her mother. My poor sister
had long been disillusioned before death released her from the
titled scamp she had married, and she very wisely placed the
emeralds in my custody to be held in trust for her daughter. They
constitute my niece's only fortune, and would produce, if offered
in London to-day, probably seventy-five or a hundred thousand
pounds, although actually they are not worth so much. Mr. Jonas
Carter very amiably consented to receive my niece with a dowry of
only fifty thousand pounds, and that money I offered to advance,
if I was allowed to retain the jewels as security. This was
arranged between Mr. Carter and myself."</p>

<p>"But surely Mr. Carter does not refuse to carry out his
engagement because the jewels have been stolen?"</p>

<p>"He does. Why should he not?"</p>

<p>"Then surely you will advance the fifty thousand
necessary?"</p>

<p>"I will not. Why should I?"</p>

<p>"Well, it seems to me," said I, with a slight laugh, "the
young man has very definitely checkmated both of you."</p>

<p>"He has, until I have laid him by the heels, which I am
determined to do if he were the brother of twenty Lord
Steffenhams."</p>

<p>"Please answer one more question. Are you determined to put
the young man in prison, or would you be content with the return
of the emeralds intact?"</p>

<p>"Of course I should prefer to put him in prison and get the
emeralds too, but if there's no choice in the matter, I must
content myself with the necklace."</p>

<p>"Very well, my lord, I will undertake the case."</p>

<p>This conference had detained us in the study till after
eleven, and then, as it was a clear, crisp December morning, I
went out through the gardens into the park, that I might walk
along the well-kept private road and meditate upon my course of
action, or, rather, think over what had been said, because I
could not map my route until I had heard the secret which the
Lady Alicia promised to impart. As at present instructed, it
seemed to me the best way to go direct to the young man, show him
as effectively as could the danger in which he stood, and, if
possible, persuade him to deliver up the necklace to me. As I
strolled along under the grand old leafless trees, I suddenly
heard my name called impulsively two or three times, and turning
round saw the Lady Alicia running toward me. Her cheeks were
bright with nature's rouge, and her eyes sparkled more dazzlingly
than any emerald that ever tempted man to wickedness.</p>

<p>"Oh, Monsieur Valmont, I have been waiting for you, and you
escaped me. Have you seen my uncle?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have been with him since ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Your ladyship, that is exactly the word with which he
accosted me."</p>

<p>"Ah, you see an additional likeness between my uncle and
myself this morning, then? Has he told you about Mr. Carter?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So now you understand how important it is that I should
regain possession of my property?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said with a sigh; "the house near Hyde Park and the
great estate in Derbyshire."</p>

<p>She clapped her hands with glee, eyes and feet dancing in
unison, as she capered along gayly beside me; a sort of
skippety-hop, skippety-hop, sideways, keeping pace with my more
stately step, as if she were a little girl of six instead of a
young woman of twenty.</p>

<p>"Not only that!" she cried, "but one million pounds to spend!
Oh, Monsieur Valmont, you know Paris, and yet you do not seem to
comprehend what that plethora of money means!"</p>

<p>"Well, madame, I have seen Paris, and I have seen a good deal
of the world, but I am not so certain you will secure the million
to spend."</p>

<p>"What!" she cried, stopping short, that little wrinkle which
betokened temper appearing on her brow. "Do you think we won't
get the emeralds, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure we will get the emeralds. I, Valmont, pledge
you my word. But if Mr. Jonas Carter before marriage calls a halt
upon the ceremony until your uncle places fifty thousand pounds
upon the table, I confess I am very pessimistic about your
obtaining control of the million afterwards."</p>

<p>All her vivacity instantaneously returned.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" she cried, dancing round in front of me, and standing
there directly in my path, so that I came to a stand. "Pooh!" she
repeated, snapping her fingers, with an inimitable gesture of
that lovely hand, "Monsieur Valmont, I am disappointed in you.
You are not nearly so nice as you were last evening. It is very
uncomplimentary in you to intimate that when once I am married to
Mr. Jonas I shall not wheedle from him all the money I want. Do
not rest your eyes on the ground; look at me and answer!"</p>

<p>I glanced up at her, and could not forbear laughing. The
witchery of the wood was in that girl; yes, and a perceptible
trace of the Gallic devil flickered in those enchanting eyes of
hers. I could not help myself.</p>

<p>"Ah, Madame la Marquise de Bellairs, how jauntily you would
scatter despair in that susceptible court of Louis!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Monsieur Eugène de Valmont," she cried, mimicking my
tones, and imitating my manner with an exactitude that amazed me,
"you are once more my dear de Valmont of last night. I dreamed of
you, I assure you I did, and now to find you in the morning, oh,
so changed!" She clasped her little hands and inclined her head,
while the sweet voice sank into a cadence of melancholy which
seemed so genuine that the mocking ripple of a laugh immediately
following was almost a shock to me. Where had this creature of
the dull English countryside learned all such <i>froufrou</i> of
gesture and tone?</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen Sarah Bernhardt?" I asked.</p>

<p>Now, the average Englishwoman would have inquired the genesis
of so inconsequent a question, but Lady Alicia followed the trend
of my thought, and answered at once as if my query had been quite
expected:</p>

<p><i>"Mais non</i>, monsieur. Sarah the Divine! Ah, she comes
with my million a year and the house of Hyde Park. No, the only
inhabitant of my real world whom I have yet seen is Monsieur
Valmont, and he, alas! I find so changeable. But now, adieu
frivolity; we must be serious," and she walked sedately by my
side.</p>

<p>"Do you know where you are going, monsieur? You are going to
church. Oh, do not look frightened; not to a service. I am
decorating the church with holly, and you shall help me and get
thorns in your poor fingers."</p>

<p>The private road, which up to this time had passed through a
forest, now reached a secluded glade in which stood a very small,
but exquisite, church, evidently centuries older than the mansion
we had left. Beyond it were gray stone ruins, which Lady Alicia
pointed out to me as remnants of the original mansion that had
been built in the reign of the second Henry. The church, it was
thought, formed the private chapel to the hall, and it had been
kept in repair by the various lords of the manor.</p>

<p>"Now hearken to the power of the poor, and learn how they may
flout the proud marquis," cried Lady Alicia gleefully; "the
poorest man in England may walk along this private road on Sunday
to the church, and the proud marquis is powerless to prevent him.
Of course, if the poor man prolongs his walk then is he in danger
from the law of trespass. On week days, however, this is the most
secluded spot on the estate, and I regret to say that my lordly
uncle does not trouble it even on Sundays. I fear we are a
degenerate race, Monsieur Valmont, for doubtless a fighting and
deeply religious ancestor of mine built this church, and to think
that when the useful masons cemented those stones together,
Madame la Marquise de Bell-airs or Lady Alicia were alike
unthought of, and though three hundred years divide them, this
ancient chapel makes them seem, as one might say, contemporaries.
Oh, Monsieur Valmont, what is the use of worrying about emeralds
or anything else? As I look at this beautiful old church, even
the house of Hyde Park appears as naught," and to my amazement
the eyes that Lady Alicia turned upon me were wet.</p>

<p>The front door was unlocked, and we walked into the church in
silence. Around the pillars holly and ivy were twined. Great
armfuls of the shrubs had been flung here and there along the
wall in heaps, and a stepladder stood in one of the aisles,
showing that the decoration of the edifice was not yet complete.
A subdued melancholy had settled down on my erstwhile vivacious
companion, the inevitable reaction so characteristic of the
artistic temperament, augmented doubtless by the solemnity of the
place, around whose walls in brass and marble were sculptured
memorials of her ancient race.</p>

<p>"You promised," I said at last, "to tell me how you came to
suspect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not here, not here," she whispered; then rising from the pew
in which she had seated herself, she said:</p>

<p>"Let us go; I am in no mood for working this morning. I shall
finish the decoration in the afternoon."</p>

<p>We came out into the cool and brilliant sunlight again, and as
we turned homeward, her spirits immediately began to rise.</p>

<p>"I am anxious to know," I persisted, "why you came to suspect
a man whom at first you believed innocent."</p>

<p>"I am not sure but I believe him innocent now, although I am
forced to the conclusion that he knows where the treasure
is."</p>

<p>"What forces you to that conclusion, my lady?"</p>

<p>"A letter I received from himself, in which he makes a
proposal so extraordinary that I am almost disinclined to accede
to it, even though it leads to the discovery of my necklace.
However, I am determined to leave no means untried if I receive
the support of my friend, Monsieur Valmont."</p>

<p>"My lady," said I, with a bow, "it is but yours to command,
mine to obey. What were the contents of that letter?"</p>

<p>"Read it," she replied, taking the folded sheet from her
pocket and handing it to me.</p>

<p>She had been quite right in characterizing the note as an
extraordinary epistle. The Honorable John Haddon had the temerity
to propose that she should go through a form of marriage with him
in the old church we had just left. If she did that, he said, it
would console him for the mad love he felt for her. The ceremony
would have no binding force upon her whatever, and she might
bring whom she pleased to perform it. If she knew no one that she
could trust, he would invite an old college chum, and bring him
to the church next morning at half past seven o'clock. Even if an
ordained clergyman performed the ceremony, it would not be legal
unless it took place between the hours of eight in the morning
and three in the afternoon. If she consented to this, the
emeralds were hers once more.</p>

<p>"This is the proposal of a madman," said I, as I handed back
the letter.</p>

<p>"Well," she replied, with a nonchalant shrug of her shoulders,
"he has always said he was madly in love with me, and I quite
believe it. Poor young man, if this mummery were to console him
for the rest of his life, why should I not indulge him in
it?"</p>

<p>"Lady Alicia, surely you would not countenance the profaning
of that lovely old edifice with a mock ceremonial? No man in his
senses could suggest such a thing!"</p>

<p>Once more her eyes were twinkling with merriment.</p>

<p>"But the Honorable John Haddon, as I have told you, is not in
his senses."</p>

<p>"Then why should you indulge him?"</p>

<p>"Why? How can you ask such a question? Because of the
emeralds. It is only a mad lark, after all, and no one need know
of it. Oh, Monsieur Valmont," she cried pleadingly, clasping her
hands, and yet it seemed to me with an undercurrent of laughter
in her beseeching tones, "will you not enact for us the part of
clergyman? I am sure if your face were as serious as it is at
this moment, the robes of a priest would become you."</p>

<p>"Lady Alicia, you are incorrigible. I am somewhat of a man of
the world, yet I should not dare to counterfeit the sacred
office, and I hope you but jest. In fact, I am sure you do, my
lady."</p>

<p>She turned away from me with a very pretty pout.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Valmont, your knighthood is, after all, but surface
deep. Tis not mine to command, and yours to obey. Certainly I did
but jest. John shall bring his own imitation clergyman with
him."</p>

<p>"Are you going to meet him to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I am. I have promised. I must secure my
necklace."</p>

<p>"You seem to place great confidence in the belief that he will
produce it."</p>

<p>"If he fails to do so, then I play Monsieur Valmont as my
trump card. But, monsieur, although you quite rightly refuse to
comply with my first request, you will surely not reject my
second. Please meet me to-morrow at the head of the avenue,
promptly at a quarter past seven, and escort me to the
church."</p>

<p>For a moment the negative trembled on my tongue's end, but she
turned those enchanting eyes upon me, and I was undone.</p>

<p>"Very well," I answered.</p>

<p>She seized both my hands, like a little girl overjoyed at a
promised excursion.</p>

<p>"Oh, Monsieur Valmont, you are a darling! I feel as if I'd
known you all my life. I am sure you will never regret having
humored me," then added a moment later, "if we get the
emeralds."</p>

<p>"Ah," said I, "<i>if</i> we get the emeralds."</p>

<p>We were now within sight of the house, and she pointed out our
rendezvous for the following day, and with that I bade her
good-by.</p>

<p>It was shortly after seven o'clock next morning when I reached
the meeting-place. The Lady Alicia was somewhat long in coming,
but when she arrived her face was aglow with girlish delight at
the solemn prank she was about to play.</p>

<p>"You have not changed your mind?" I asked, after the morning's
greetings.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Monsieur Valmont," she replied, with a bright laugh.
"I am determined to recover those emeralds."</p>

<p>"We must hurry, Lady Alicia, or we will be too late."</p>

<p>"There is plenty of time," she remarked calmly; and she proved
to be right, because when we came in sight of the church, the
clock pointed to the hour of half-past seven.</p>

<p>"Now," she said "I shall wait here until you steal up to the
church and look in through one of the windows that do not contain
stained glass. I should not for the world arrive before Mr.
Haddon and his friend are there."</p>

<p>I did as requested, and saw two young men standing together in
the center aisle, one in the full robes of a clergyman, the other
in his ordinary dress, whom I took to be the Honorable John
Haddon. His profile was toward me, and I must admit there was
very little of the madman in his calm countenance. His was a
well-cut face, clean shaven, and strikingly manly. In one of the
pews was seated a woman. I learned afterwards she was Lady
Alicia's maid, who had been instructed to come and go from the
house by a footpath, while we had taken the longer road. I
returned and escorted Lady Alicia to the church, and there was
introduced to Mr. Haddon and his friend, the made-up divine. The
ceremony was at once performed, and, man of the world as I
professed myself to be, this enacting of private theatricals in a
church grated upon me. When the maid and I were asked to sign the
book as witnesses, I said:</p>

<p>"Surely this is carrying realism a little too far?"</p>

<p>Mr. Haddon smiled, and replied:</p>

<p>"I am amazed to hear a Frenchman objecting to realism going to
its full length, and speaking for myself, I should be delighted
to see the autograph of the renowned Eugène Valmont," and with
that he proffered me the pen, whereupon I scrawled my signature.
The maid had already signed, and disappeared. The reputed
clergyman bowed us out of the church, standing in the porch to
see us walk up the avenue.</p>

<p>"Ed," cried John Haddon, "I'll be back within half an hour, and
we'll attend to the clock. You won't mind waiting?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least, dear boy. God bless you both," and the
tremor in his voice seemed to me carrying realism one step
further still.</p>

<p>The Lady Alicia, with downcast head, hurried us on until we
were within the gloom of the forest, and then, ignoring me, she
turned suddenly to the young man, and placed her two hands on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, Jack!" she cried.</p>

<p>He kissed her twice on the lips.</p>

<p>"Jack, Monsieur Valmont insists on the emeralds."</p>

<p>The young man laughed. Her ladyship stood fronting him with
her back towards me. Tenderly the young man unfastened something
at the throat of that high-necked dress of hers, then there was a
snap, and he drew out an amazing, dazzling, shimmering sheen of
green, that seemed to turn the whole bleak December landscape
verdant as with a touch of spring. The girl hid her rosy face
against him, and over her shoulder, with a smile, he handed me
the celebrated Blair emeralds.</p>

<p>"There is the treasure, Valmont," he cried, "on condition that
you do not molest the culprit."</p>

<p>"Or the accessory after the fact," gurgled Lady Alicia in
smothered tones, with a hand clasping together her high-necked
dress at the throat.</p>

<p>"We trust to your invention, Valmont, to deliver that necklace
to uncle with a detective story that will thrill him to his very
heart."</p>

<p>We heard the clock strike eight; then a second later smaller
bells chimed a quarter-past, and another second after they
tinkled the half-hour. "Hallo!" cried Haddon, "Ed has attended to
the clock himself. What a good fellow he is."</p>

<p>I looked at my watch; it was twenty-five minutes to nine.</p>

<p>"Was the ceremony genuine then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, Valmont," said the young man, patting his wife
affectionately on the shoulder, "nothing on earth can be more
genuine than that ceremony was."</p>

<p>And the volatile Lady Alicia snuggled closer to him.</p>
