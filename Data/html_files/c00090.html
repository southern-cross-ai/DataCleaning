<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>Author's Note</h2>

<p>These adventures were told to me in the old days by Arsène
Lupin, as though they had happened to a friend of his, named Prince
Rénine. As for me, considering the way in which they were
conducted, the actions, the behaviour and the very character of the
hero, I find it very difficult not to identify the two friends as
one and the same person. Arsène Lupin is gifted with a powerful
imagination and is quite capable of attributing to himself
adventures which are not his at all and of disowning those which
are really his. The reader will judge for himself.<br>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. On the Top of the Tower</h2>

<p>Hortense Daniel pushed her window ajar and whispered:</p>

<p>"Are you there, Rossigny?"</p>

<p>"I am here," replied a voice from the shrubbery at the front of
the house.</p>

<p>Leaning forward, she saw a rather fat man looking up at her out
of a gross red face with its cheeks and chin set in unpleasantly
fair whiskers.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I had a great argument with my uncle and aunt last night.
They absolutely refuse to sign the document of which my lawyer sent
them the draft, or to restore the dowry squandered by my
husband."</p>

<p>"But your uncle is responsible by the terms of the
marriage-settlement."</p>

<p>"No matter. He refuses."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>"Are you still determined to run away with me?" she asked, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>"More so than ever."</p>

<p>"Your intentions are strictly honourable, remember!"</p>

<p>"Just as you please. You know that I am madly in love with
you."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I am not madly in love with you!"</p>

<p>"Then what made you choose me?"</p>

<p>"Chance. I was bored. I was growing tired of my humdrum
existence. So I'm ready to run risks...Here's my luggage:
catch!"</p>

<p>She let down from the window a couple of large leather kit-bags.
Rossigny caught them in his arms.</p>

<p>"The die is cast," she whispered. "Go and wait for me with your
car at the If crossroads. I shall come on horseback."</p>

<p>"Hang it, I can't run off with your horse!"</p>

<p>"He will go home by himself."</p>

<p>"Capital!...Oh, by the way..."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Who is this Prince Rénine, who's been here the last three days
and whom nobody seems to know?"</p>

<p>"I don't know much about him. My uncle met him at a friend's
shoot and asked him here to stay."</p>

<p>"You seem to have made a great impression on him. You went for a
long ride with him yesterday. He's a man I don't care for."</p>

<p>"In two hours I shall have left the house in your company. The
scandal will cool him off...Well, we've talked long enough. We have
no time to lose."</p>

<p>For a few minutes she stood watching the fat man bending under
the weight of her traps as he moved away in the shelter of an empty
avenue. Then she closed the window.</p>

<p>Outside, in the park, the huntsmen's horns were sounding the
reveille. The hounds burst into frantic baying. It was the opening
day of the hunt that morning at the Château de la Marèze, where,
every year, in the first week in September, the Comte d'Aigleroche,
a mighty hunter before the Lord, and his countess were accustomed
to invite a few personal friends and the neighbouring
landowners.</p>

<p>Hortense slowly finished dressing, put on a riding-habit, which
revealed the lines of her supple figure, and a wide-brimmed felt
hat, which encircled her lovely face and auburn hair, and sat down
to her writing-desk, at which she wrote to her uncle, M.
d'Aigleroche, a farewell letter to be delivered to him that
evening. It was a difficult letter to word; and, after beginning it
several times, she ended by giving up the idea.</p>

<p>"I will write to him later," she said to herself, "when his
anger has cooled down."</p>

<p>And she went downstairs to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Enormous logs were blazing in the hearth of the lofty room. The
walls were hung with trophies of rifles and shotguns. The guests
were flocking in from every side, shaking hands with the Comte
d'Aigleroche, one of those typical country squires, heavily and
powerfully built, who lives only for hunting and shooting. He was
standing before the fire, with a large glass of old brandy in his
hand, drinking the health of each new arrival.</p>

<p>Hortense kissed him absently:</p>

<p>"What, uncle! You who are usually so sober!"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" he said. "A man may surely indulge himself a little once
a year!..."</p>

<p>"Aunt will give you a scolding!"</p>

<p>"Your aunt has one of her sick headaches and is not coming down.
Besides," he added, gruffly, "it is not her business...and still
less is it yours, my dear child."</p>

<p>Prince Rénine came up to Hortense. He was a young man, very
smartly dressed, with a narrow and rather pale face, whose eyes
held by turns the gentlest and the harshest, the most friendly and
the most satirical expression. He bowed to her, kissed her hand and
said:</p>

<p>"May I remind you of your kind promise, dear madame?"</p>

<p>"My promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we agreed that we should repeat our delightful excursion
of yesterday and try to go over that old boarded-up place the look
of which made us so curious. It seems to be known as the Domaine de
Halingre."</p>

<p>She answered a little curtly:</p>

<p>"I'm extremely sorry, monsieur, but it would be rather far and
I'm feeling a little done up. I shall go for a canter in the park
and come indoors again."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then Serge Rénine said, smiling, with his
eyes fixed on hers and in a voice which she alone could hear:</p>

<p>"I am sure that you'll keep your promise and that you'll let me
come with you. It would be better."</p>

<p>"For whom? For you, you mean?"</p>

<p>"For you, too, I assure you."</p>

<p>She coloured slightly, but did not reply, shook hands with a few
people around her and left the room.</p>

<p>A groom was holding the horse at the foot of the steps. She
mounted and set off towards the woods beyond the park.</p>

<p>It was a cool, still morning. Through the leaves, which barely
quivered, the sky showed crystalline blue. Hortense rode at a walk
down winding avenues which in half an hour brought her to a
countryside of ravines and bluffs intersected by the highroad.</p>

<p>She stopped. There was not a sound. Rossigny must have stopped
his engine and concealed the car in the thickets around the If
crossroads.</p>

<p>She was five hundred yards at most from that circular space.
After hesitating for a few seconds, she dismounted, tied her horse
carelessly, so that he could release himself by the least effort
and return to the house, shrouded her face in the long brown veil
that hung over her shoulders and walked on.</p>

<p>As she expected, she saw Rossigny directly she reached the first
turn in the road. He ran up to her and drew her into the
coppice!</p>

<p>"Quick, quick! Oh, I was so afraid that you would be late...or
even change your mind! And here you are! It seems too good to be
true!"</p>

<p>She smiled:</p>

<p>"You appear to be quite happy to do an idiotic thing!"</p>

<p>"I should think I <i>am</i> happy! And so will you be, I swear
you will! Your life will be one long fairytale. You shall have
every luxury, and all the money you can wish for."</p>

<p>"I want neither money nor luxuries."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Happiness."</p>

<p>"You can safely leave your happiness to me."</p>

<p>She replied, jestingly:</p>

<p>"I rather doubt the quality of the happiness which you would
give me."</p>

<p>"Wait! You'll see! You'll see!"</p>

<p>They had reached the motor. Rossigny, still stammering
expressions of delight, started the engine. Hortense stepped in and
wrapped herself in a wide cloak. The car followed the narrow,
grassy path which led back to the crossroads and Rossigny was
accelerating the speed, when he was suddenly forced to pull up. A
shot had rung out from the neighbouring wood, on the right. The car
was swerving from side to side.</p>

<p>"A front tire burst," shouted Rossigny, leaping to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!" cried Hortense. "Somebody fired!"</p>

<p>"Impossible, my dear! Don't be so absurd!"</p>

<p>At that moment, two slight shocks were felt and two more reports
were heard, one after the other, some way off and still in the
wood.</p>

<p>Rossigny snarled:</p>

<p>"The back tires burst now...both of them...But who, in the
devil's name, can the ruffian be?...Just let me get hold of him,
that's all!..."</p>

<p>He clambered up the roadside slope. There was no one there.
Moreover, the leaves of the coppice blocked the view.</p>

<p>"Damn it! Damn it!" he swore. "You were right: somebody was
firing at the car! Oh, this is a bit thick! We shall be held up for
hours! Three tires to mend!...But what are you doing, dear
girl?"</p>

<p>Hortense herself had alighted from the car. She ran to him,
greatly excited:</p>

<p>"I'm going."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"I want to know. Someone fired. I want to know who it was."</p>

<p>"Don't let us separate, please!"</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm going to wait here for you for hours?"</p>

<p>"What about your running away?...All our plans...?"</p>

<p>"We'll discuss that tomorrow. Go back to the house. Take back my
things with you...And goodbye for the present."</p>

<p>She hurried, left him, had the good luck to find her horse and
set off at a gallop in a direction leading away from La Marèze.</p>

<p>There was not the least doubt in her mind that the three shots
had been fired by Prince Rénine.</p>

<p>"It was he," she muttered, angrily, "it was he. No one else
would be capable of such behaviour."</p>

<p>Besides, he had warned her, in his smiling, masterful way, that
he would expect her.</p>

<p>She was weeping with rage and humiliation. At that moment, had
she found herself face to face with Prince Rénine, she could have
struck him with her riding-whip.</p>

<p>Before her was the rugged and picturesque stretch of country
which lies between the Orne and the Sarthe, above Alençon, and
which is known as Little Switzerland. Steep hills compelled her
frequently to moderate her pace, the more so as she had to cover
some six miles before reaching her destination. But, though the
speed at which she rode became less headlong, though her physical
effort gradually slackened, she nevertheless persisted in her
indignation against Prince Rénine. She bore him a grudge not only
for the unspeakable action of which he had been guilty, but also
for his behaviour to her during the last three days, his persistent
attentions, his assurance, his air of excessive politeness.</p>

<p>She was nearly there. In the bottom of a valley, an old
park-wall, full of cracks and covered with moss and weeds, revealed
the ball-turret of a château and a few windows with closed
shutters. This was the Domaine de Halingre. She followed the wall
and turned a corner. In the middle of the crescent-shaped space
before which lay the entrance-gates, Serge Rénine stood waiting
beside his horse.</p>

<p>She sprang to the ground, and, as he stepped forward, hat in
hand, thanking her for coming, she cried:</p>

<p>"One word, monsieur, to begin with. Something quite inexplicable
happened just now. Three shots were fired at a motorcar in which I
was sitting. Did you fire those shots?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She seemed dumbfounded:</p>

<p>"Then you confess it?"</p>

<p>"You have asked a question, madame, and I have answered it."</p>

<p>"But how dared you? What gave you the right?"</p>

<p>"I was not exercising a right, madame; I was performing a
duty!"</p>

<p>"Indeed! And what duty, pray?"</p>

<p>"The duty of protecting you against a man who is trying to
profit by your troubles."</p>

<p>"I forbid you to speak like that. I am responsible for my own
actions, and I decided upon them in perfect liberty."</p>

<p>"Madame, I overheard your conversation with M. Rossigny this
morning and it did not appear to me that you were accompanying him
with a light heart. I admit the ruthlessness and bad taste of my
interference and I apologise for it humbly; but I risked being
taken for a ruffian in order to give you a few hours for
reflection."</p>

<p>"I have reflected fully, monsieur. When I have once made up my
mind to a thing, I do not change it."</p>

<p>"Yes, madame, you do, sometimes. If not, why are you here
instead of there?"</p>

<p>Hortense was confused for a moment. All her anger had subsided.
She looked at Rénine with the surprise which one experiences when
confronted with certain persons who are unlike their fellows, more
capable of performing unusual actions, more generous and
disinterested. She realised perfectly that he was acting without
any ulterior motive or calculation, that he was, as he had said,
merely fulfilling his duty as a gentleman to a woman who has taken
the wrong turning.</p>

<p>Speaking very gently, he said:</p>

<p>"I know very little about you, madame, but enough to make me
wish to be of use to you. You are twenty-six years old and have
lost both your parents. Seven years ago, you became the wife of the
Comte d'Aigleroche's nephew by marriage, who proved to be of
unsound mind, half insane indeed, and had to be confined. This made
it impossible for you to obtain a divorce and compelled you, since
your dowry had been squandered, to live with your uncle and at his
expense. It's a depressing environment. The count and countess do
not agree. Years ago, the count was deserted by his first wife, who
ran away with the countess' first husband. The abandoned husband
and wife decided out of spite to unite their fortunes, but found
nothing but disappointment and ill-will in this second marriage.
And you suffer the consequences. They lead a monotonous, narrow,
lonely life for eleven months or more out of the year. One day, you
met M. Rossigny, who fell in love with you and suggested an
elopement. You did not care for him. But you were bored, your youth
was being wasted, you longed for the unexpected, for adventure...in
a word, you accepted with the very definite intention of keeping
your admirer at arm's length, but also with the rather ingenuous
hope that the scandal would force your uncle's hand and make him
account for his trusteeship and assure you of an independent
existence. That is how you stand. At present you have to choose
between placing yourself in M. Rossigny's hands...or trusting
yourself to me."</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to his. What did he mean? What was the
purport of this offer which he made so seriously, like a friend who
asks nothing but to prove his devotion?</p>

<p>After a moment's silence, he took the two horses by the bridle
and tied them up. Then he examined the heavy gates, each of which
was strengthened by two planks nailed crosswise. An electoral
poster, dated twenty years earlier, showed that no one had entered
the domain since that time.</p>

<p>Rénine tore up one of the iron posts which supported a railing
that ran round the crescent and used it as a lever. The rotten
planks gave way. One of them uncovered the lock, which he attacked
with a big knife, containing a number of blades and implements. A
minute later, the gate opened on a waste of bracken which led up to
a long, dilapidated building, with a turret at each corner and a
sort of a belvedere, built on a taller tower, in the middle.</p>

<p>The Prince turned to Hortense:</p>

<p>"You are in no hurry," he said. "You will form your decision
this evening; and, if M. Rossigny succeeds in persuading you for
the second time, I give you my word of honour that I shall not
cross your path. Until then, grant me the privilege of your
company. We made up our minds yesterday to inspect the château. Let
us do so. Will you? It is as good a way as any of passing the time
and I have a notion that it will not be uninteresting."</p>

<p>He had a way of talking which compelled obedience. He seemed to
be commanding and entreating at the same time. Hortense did not
even seek to shake off the enervation into which her will was
slowly sinking. She followed him to a half-demolished flight of
steps at the top of which was a door likewise strengthened by
planks nailed in the form of a cross.</p>

<p>Rénine went to work in the same way as before. They entered a
spacious hall paved with white and black flagstones, furnished with
old sideboards and choir-stalls and adorned with a carved
escutcheon which displayed the remains of armorial bearings,
representing an eagle standing on a block of stone, all half-hidden
behind a veil of cobwebs which hung down over a pair of
folding-doors.</p>

<p>"The door of the drawing-room, evidently," said Rénine.</p>

<p>He found this more difficult to open; and it was only by
repeatedly charging it with his shoulder that he was able to move
one of the doors.</p>

<p>Hortense had not spoken a word. She watched not without surprise
this series of forcible entries, which were accomplished with a
really masterly skill. He guessed her thoughts and, turning round,
said in a serious voice:</p>

<p>"It's child's-play to me. I was a locksmith once."</p>

<p>She seized his arm and whispered:</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>"To what?" he asked.</p>

<p>She increased the pressure of her hand, to demand silence. The
next moment, he murmured:</p>

<p>"It's really very strange."</p>

<p>"Listen, listen!" Hortense repeated, in bewilderment. "Can it be
possible?"</p>

<p>They heard, not far from where they were standing, a sharp
sound, the sound of a light tap recurring at regular intervals; and
they had only to listen attentively to recognise the ticking of a
clock. Yes, it was this and nothing else that broke the profound
silence of the dark room; it was indeed the deliberate ticking,
rhythmical as the beat of a metronome, produced by a heavy brass
pendulum. That was it! And nothing could be more impressive than
the measured pulsation of this trivial mechanism, which by some
miracle, some inexplicable phenomenon, had continued to live in the
heart of the dead château.</p>

<p>"And yet," stammered Hortense, without daring to raise her
voice, "no one has entered the house?"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"And it is quite impossible for that clock to have kept going
for twenty years without being wound up?"</p>

<p>"Quite impossible."</p>

<p>"Then...?"</p>

<p>Serge Rénine opened the three windows and threw back the
shutters.</p>

<p>He and Hortense were in a drawing-room, as he had thought; and
the room showed not the least sign of disorder. The chairs were in
their places. Not a piece of furniture was missing. The people who
had lived there and who had made it the most individual room in
their house had gone away leaving everything just as it was, the
books which they used to read, the knickknacks on the tables and
consoles.</p>

<p>Rénine examined the old grandfather's clock, contained in its
tall carved case which showed the disk of the pendulum through an
oval pane of glass. He opened the door of the clock. The weights
hanging from the cords were at their lowest point.</p>

<p>At that moment there was a click. The clock struck eight with a
serious note which Hortense was never to forget.</p>

<p>"How extraordinary!" she said.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary indeed," said he, "for the works are exceedingly
simple and would hardly keep going for a week."</p>

<p>"And do you see nothing out of the common?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing...or, at least..."</p>

<p>He stooped and, from the back of the case, drew a metal tube
which was concealed by the weights. Holding it up to the light:</p>

<p>"A telescope," he said, thoughtfully. "Why did they hide
it?...And they left it drawn out to its full length...That's
odd...What does it mean?"</p>

<p>The clock, as is sometimes usual, began to strike a second time,
sounding eight strokes. Rénine closed the case and continued his
inspection without putting his telescope down. A wide arch led from
the drawing-room to a smaller apartment, a sort of smoking-room.
This also was furnished, but contained a glass case for guns of
which the rack was empty. Hanging on a panel near by was a calendar
with the date of the 5th of September.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Hortense, in astonishment, "the same date as
today!...They tore off the leaves until the 5th of September...And
this is the anniversary! What an astonishing coincidence!"</p>

<p>"Astonishing," he echoed. "It's the anniversary of their
departure...twenty years ago today."</p>

<p>"You must admit," she said, "that all this is
incomprehensible."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course...but, all the same...perhaps not."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea?"</p>

<p>He waited a few seconds before replying:</p>

<p>"What puzzles me is this telescope hidden, dropped in that
corner, at the last moment. I wonder what it was used for...From
the ground-floor windows you see nothing but the trees in the
garden...and the same, I expect, from all the windows...We are in a
valley, without the least open horizon...To use the telescope, one
would have to go up to the top of the house...Shall we go up?"</p>

<p>She did not hesitate. The mystery surrounding the whole
adventure excited her curiosity so keenly that she could think of
nothing but accompanying Rénine and assisting him in his
investigations.</p>

<p>They went upstairs accordingly, and, on the second floor, came
to a landing where they found the spiral staircase leading to the
belvedere.</p>

<p>At the top of this was a platform in the open air, but
surrounded by a parapet over six feet high.</p>

<p>"There must have been battlements which have been filled in
since," observed Prince Rénine. "Look here, there were loopholes at
one time. They may have been blocked."</p>

<p>"In any case," she said, "the telescope was of no use up here
either and we may as well go down again."</p>

<p>"I don't agree," he said. "Logic tells us that there must have
been some gap through which the country could be seen and this was
the spot where the telescope was used."</p>

<p>He hoisted himself by his wrists to the top of the parapet and
then saw that this point of vantage commanded the whole of the
valley, including the park, with its tall trees marking the
horizon; and, beyond, a depression in a wood surmounting a hill, at
a distance of some seven or eight hundred yards, stood another
tower, squat and in ruins, covered with ivy from top to bottom.</p>

<p>Rénine resumed his inspection. He seemed to consider that the
key to the problem lay in the use to which the telescope was put
and that the problem would be solved if only they could discover
this use.</p>

<p>He studied the loopholes one after the other. One of them, or
rather the place which it had occupied, attracted his attention
above the rest. In the middle of the layer of plaster, which had
served to block it, there was a hollow filled with earth in which
plants had grown. He pulled out the plants and removed the earth,
thus clearing the mouth of a hole some five inches in diameter,
which completely penetrated the wall. On bending forward, Rénine
perceived that this deep and narrow opening inevitably carried the
eye, above the dense tops of the trees and through the depression
in the hill, to the ivy-clad tower.</p>

<p>At the bottom of this channel, in a sort of groove which ran
through it like a gutter, the telescope fitted so exactly that it
was quite impossible to shift it, however little, either to the
right or to the left.</p>

<p>Rénine, after wiping the outside of the lenses, while taking
care not to disturb the lie of the instrument by a hair's breadth,
put his eye to the small end.</p>

<p>He remained for thirty or forty seconds, gazing attentively and
silently. Then he drew himself up and said, in a husky voice:</p>

<p>"It's terrible...it's really terrible."</p>

<p>"What is?" she asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Look."</p>

<p>She bent down but the image was not clear to her and the
telescope had to be focused to suit her sight. The next moment she
shuddered and said:</p>

<p>"It's two scarecrows, isn't it, both stuck up on the top? But
why?"</p>

<p>"Look again," he said. "Look more carefully under the hats...the
faces..."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, turning faint with horror, "how awful!"</p>

<p>The field of the telescope, like the circular picture shown by a
magic lantern, presented this spectacle: the platform of a broken
tower, the walls of which were higher in the more distant part and
formed as it were a backdrop, over which surged waves of ivy. In
front, amid a cluster of bushes, were two human beings, a man and a
woman, leaning back against a heap of fallen stones.</p>

<p>But the words man and woman could hardly be applied to these two
forms, these two sinister puppets, which, it is true, wore clothes
and hats&mdash;or rather shreds of clothes and remnants of
hats&mdash;but had lost their eyes, their cheeks, their chins,
every particle of flesh, until they were actually and positively
nothing more than two skeletons.</p>

<p>"Two skeletons," stammered Hortense. "Two skeletons with clothes
on. Who carried them up there?"</p>

<p>"Nobody."</p>

<p>"But still..."</p>

<p>"That man and that woman must have died at the top of the tower,
years and years ago...and their flesh rotted under their clothes
and the ravens ate them."</p>

<p>"But it's hideous, hideous!" cried Hortense, pale as death, her
face drawn with horror.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Hortense Daniel and Rénine left the Château
de Halingre. Before their departure, they had gone as far as the
ivy-grown tower, the remains of an old donjon-keep more than half
demolished. The inside was empty. There seemed to have been a way
of climbing to the top, at a comparatively recent period, by means
of wooden stairs and ladders which now lay broken and scattered
over the ground. The tower backed against the wall which marked the
end of the park.</p>

<p>A curious fact, which surprised Hortense, was that Prince Rénine
had neglected to pursue a more minute enquiry, as though the matter
had lost all interest for him. He did not even speak of it any
longer; and, in the inn at which they stopped and took a light meal
in the nearest village, it was she who asked the landlord about the
abandoned château. But she learnt nothing from him, for the man was
new to the district and could give her no particulars. He did not
even know the name of the owner.</p>

<p>They turned their horses' heads towards La Marèze. Again and
again Hortense recalled the squalid sight which had met their eyes.
But Rénine, who was in a lively mood and full of attentions to his
companion, seemed utterly indifferent to those questions.</p>

<p>"But, after all," she exclaimed, impatiently, "we can't leave
the matter there! It calls for a solution."</p>

<p>"As you say," he replied, "a solution is called for. M. Rossigny
has to know where he stands and you have to decide what to do about
him."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders: "He's of no importance for the
moment. The thing today..."</p>

<p>"Is what?"</p>

<p>"Is to know what those two dead bodies are."</p>

<p>"Still, Rossigny..."</p>

<p>"Rossigny can wait. But I can't. You have shown me a mystery
which is now the only thing that matters. What do you intend to
do?"</p>

<p>"To do?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There are two bodies...You'll inform the police, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Gracious goodness!" he exclaimed, laughing. "What for?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's a riddle that has to be cleared up at all costs,
a terrible tragedy."</p>

<p>"We don't need anyone to do that."</p>

<p>"What! Do you mean to say that you understand it?"</p>

<p>"Almost as plainly as though I had read it in a book, told in
full detail, with explanatory illustrations. It's all so
simple!"</p>

<p>She looked at him askance, wondering if he was making fun of
her. But he seemed quite serious.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked, quivering with curiosity.</p>

<p>The light was beginning to wane. They had trotted at a good
pace; and the hunt was returning as they neared La Marèze.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "we shall get the rest of our information from
people living round about...from your uncle, for instance; and you
will see how logically all the facts fit in. When you hold the
first link of a chain, you are bound, whether you like it or not,
to reach the last. It's the greatest fun in the world."</p>

<p>Once in the house, they separated. On going to her room,
Hortense found her luggage and a furious letter from Rossigny in
which he bade her goodbye and announced his departure.</p>

<p>Then Rénine knocked at her door:</p>

<p>"Your uncle is in the library," he said. "Will you go down with
me? I've sent word that I am coming."</p>

<p>She went with him. He added:</p>

<p>"One word more. This morning, when I thwarted your plans and
begged you to trust me, I naturally undertook an obligation towards
you which I mean to fulfill without delay. I want to give you a
positive proof of this."</p>

<p>She laughed:</p>

<p>"The only obligation which you took upon yourself was to satisfy
my curiosity."</p>

<p>"It shall be satisfied," he assured her, gravely, "and more
fully than you can possibly imagine."</p>

<p>M. d'Aigleroche was alone. He was smoking his pipe and drinking
sherry. He offered a glass to Rénine, who refused.</p>

<p>"Well, Hortense!" he said, in a rather thick voice. "You know
that it's pretty dull here, except in these September days. You
must make the most of them. Have you had a pleasant ride with
Rénine?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I wanted to talk about, my dear sir,"
interrupted the prince.</p>

<p>"You must excuse me, but I have to go to the station in ten
minutes, to meet a friend of my wife's."</p>

<p>"Oh, ten minutes will be ample!"</p>

<p>"Just the time to smoke a cigarette?"</p>

<p>"No longer."</p>

<p>He took a cigarette from the case which M. d'Aigleroche handed
to him, lit it and said:</p>

<p>"I must tell you that our ride happened to take us to an old
domain which you are sure to know, the Domaine de Halingre."</p>

<p>"Certainly I know it. But it has been closed, boarded up for
twenty-five years or so. You weren't able to get in, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we were."</p>

<p>"Really? Was it interesting?"</p>

<p>"Extremely. We discovered the strangest things."</p>

<p>"What things?" asked the count, looking at his watch.</p>

<p>Rénine described what they had seen:</p>

<p>"On a tower some way from the house there were two dead bodies,
two skeletons rather...a man and a woman still wearing the clothes
which they had on when they were murdered."</p>

<p>"Come, come, now! Murdered?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and that is what we have come to trouble you about. The
tragedy must date back to some twenty years ago. Was nothing known
of it at the time?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," declared the count. "I never heard of any such
crime or disappearance."</p>

<p>"Oh, really!" said Rénine, looking a little disappointed. "I
hoped to obtain a few particulars."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"In that case, I apologise."</p>

<p>He consulted Hortense with a glance and moved towards the door.
But on second thought:</p>

<p>"Could you not at least, my dear sir, bring me into touch with
some persons in the neighbourhood, some members of your family, who
might know more about it?"</p>

<p>"Of my family? And why?"</p>

<p>"Because the Domaine de Halingre used to belong and no doubt
still belongs to the d'Aigleroches. The arms are an eagle on a heap
of stones, on a rock. This at once suggested the connection."</p>

<p>This time the count appeared surprised. He pushed back his
decanter and his glass of sherry and said:</p>

<p>"What's this you're telling me? I had no idea that we had any
such neighbours."</p>

<p>Rénine shook his head and smiled:</p>

<p>"I should be more inclined to believe, sir, that you were not
very eager to admit any relationship between yourself...and the
unknown owner of the property."</p>

<p>"Then he's not a respectable man?"</p>

<p>"The man, to put it plainly, is a murderer."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>The count had risen from his chair. Hortense, greatly excited,
said:</p>

<p>"Are you really sure that there has been a murder and that the
murder was done by someone belonging to the house?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure."</p>

<p>"But why are you so certain?"</p>

<p>"Because I know who the two victims were and what caused them to
be killed."</p>

<p>Prince Rénine was making none but positive statements and his
method suggested the belief that he supported by the strongest
proofs.</p>

<p>M. d'Aigleroche strode up and down the room, with his hands
behind his back. He ended by saying:</p>

<p>"I always had an instinctive feeling that something had
happened, but I never tried to find out...Now, as a matter of fact,
twenty years ago, a relation of mine, a distant cousin, used to
live at the Domaine de Halingre. I hoped, because of the name I
bear, that this story, which, as I say, I never knew but suspected,
would remain hidden forever."</p>

<p>"So this cousin killed somebody?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he was obliged to."</p>

<p>Rénine shook his head:</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have to amend that phrase, my dear sir. The
truth, on the contrary, is that your cousin took his victims' lives
in cold blood and in a cowardly manner. I never heard of a crime
more deliberately and craftily planned."</p>

<p>"What is it that you know?"</p>

<p>The moment had come for Rénine to explain himself, a solemn and
anguish-stricken moment, the full gravity of which Hortense
understood, though she had not yet divined any part of the tragedy
which the prince unfolded step by step.</p>

<p>"It's a very simple story," he said. "There is every reason to
believe that M. d'Aigleroche was married and that there was another
couple living in the neighbourhood with whom the owner of the
Domaine de Halingre were on friendly terms. What happened one day,
which of these four persons first disturbed the relations between
the two households, I am unable to say. But a likely version, which
at once occurs to the mind, is that your cousin's wife, Madame
d'Aigleroche, was in the habit of meeting the other husband in the
ivy-covered tower, which had a door opening outside the estate. On
discovering the intrigue, your cousin d'Aigleroche resolved to be
revenged, but in such a manner that there should be no scandal and
that no one even should ever know that the guilty pair had been
killed. Now he had ascertained&mdash;as I did just now&mdash;that
there was a part of the house, the belvedere, from which you can
see, over the trees and the undulations of the park, the tower
standing eight hundred yards away, and that this was the only place
that overlooked the top of the tower. He therefore pierced a hole
in the parapet, through one of the former loopholes, and from
there, by using a telescope which fitted exactly in the grove which
he had hollowed out, he watched the meetings of the two lovers. And
it was from there, also, that, after carefully taking all his
measurements, and calculating all his distances, on a Sunday, the
5th of September, when the house was empty, he killed them with two
shots."</p>

<p>The truth was becoming apparent. The light of day was breaking.
The count muttered:</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what must have happened. I expect that my cousin
d'Aigleroche..."</p>

<p>"The murderer," Rénine continued, "stopped up the loophole
neatly with a clod of earth. No one would ever know that two dead
bodies were decaying on the top of that tower which was never
visited and of which he took the precaution to demolish the wooden
stairs. Nothing therefore remained for him to do but to explain the
disappearance of his wife and his friend. This presented no
difficulty. He accused them of having eloped together."</p>

<p>Hortense gave a start. Suddenly, as though the last sentence
were a complete and to her an absolutely unexpected revelation, she
understood what Rénine was trying to convey:</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I mean that M. d'Aigleroche accused his wife and his friend of
eloping together."</p>

<p>"No, no!" she cried. "I can't allow that!...You are speaking of
a cousin of my uncle's? Why mix up the two stories?"</p>

<p>"Why mix up this story with another which took place at that
time?" said the prince. "But I am not mixing them up, my dear
madame; there is only one story and I am telling it as it
happened."</p>

<p>Hortense turned to her uncle. He sat silent, with his arms
folded; and his head remained in the shadow cast by the lampshade.
Why had he not protested?</p>

<p>Rénine repeated in a firm tone:</p>

<p>"There is only one story. On the evening of that very day, the
5th of September at eight o'clock, M. d'Aigleroche, doubtless
alleging as his reason that he was going in pursuit of the runaway
couple, left his house after boarding up the entrance. He went
away, leaving all the rooms as they were and removing only the
firearms from their glass case. At the last minute, he had a
presentiment, which has been justified today, that the discovery of
the telescope which had played so great a part in the preparation
of his crime might serve as a clue to an enquiry; and he threw it
into the clock-case, where, as luck would have it, it interrupted
the swing of the pendulum. This unreflecting action, one of those
which every criminal inevitably commits, was to betray him twenty
years later. Just now, the blows which I struck to force the door
of the drawing-room released the pendulum. The clock was set going,
struck eight o'clock...and I possessed the clue of thread which was
to lead me through the labyrinth."</p>

<p>"Proofs!" stammered Hortense. "Proofs!"</p>

<p>"Proofs?" replied Rénine, in a loud voice. "Why, there are any
number of proofs; and you know them as well as I do. Who could have
killed at that distance of eight hundred yards, except an expert
shot, an ardent sportsman? You agree, M. d'Aigleroche, do you
not?...Proofs? Why was nothing removed from the house, nothing
except the guns, those guns which an ardent sportsman cannot afford
to leave behind&mdash;you agree, M. d'Aigleroche&mdash;those guns
which we find here, hanging in trophies on the walls!...Proofs?
What about that date, the 5th of September, which was the date of
the crime and which has left such a horrible memory in the
criminal's mind that every year at this time&mdash;at this time
alone&mdash;he surrounds himself with distractions and that every
year, on this same 5th of September, he forgets his habits of
temperance? Well, today, is the 5th of September...Proofs? Why, if
there weren't any others, would that not be enough for you?"</p>

<p>And Rénine, flinging out his arm, pointed to the Comte
d'Aigleroche, who, terrified by this evocation of the past, had
sunk huddled into a chair and was hiding his head in his hands.</p>

<p>Hortense did not attempt to argue with him. She had never liked
her uncle, or rather her husband's uncle. She now accepted the
accusation laid against him.</p>

<p>Sixty seconds passed. Then M. d'Aigleroche walked up to them and
said:</p>

<p>"Whether the story be true or not, you can't call a husband a
criminal for avenging his honour and killing his faithless
wife."</p>

<p>"No," replied Rénine, "but I have told only the first version of
the story. There is another which is infinitely more serious...and
more probable, one to which a more thorough investigation would be
sure to lead."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean this. It may not be a matter of a husband taking the law
into his own hands, as I charitably supposed. It may be a matter of
a ruined man who covets his friend's money and his friend's wife
and who, with this object in view, to secure his freedom, to get
rid of his friend and of his own wife, draws them into a trap,
suggests to them that they should visit that lonely tower and kills
them by shooting them from a distance safely under cover."</p>

<p>"No, no," the count protested. "No, all that is untrue."</p>

<p>"I don't say it isn't. I am basing my accusation on proofs, but
also on intuitions and arguments which up to now have been
extremely accurate. All the same, I admit that the second version
may be incorrect. But, if so, why feel any remorse? One does not
feel remorse for punishing guilty people."</p>

<p>"One does for taking life. It is a crushing burden to bear."</p>

<p>"Was it to give himself greater strength to bear this burden
that M. d'Aigleroche afterwards married his victim's widow? For
that, sir, is the crux of the question. What was the motive of that
marriage? Was M. d'Aigleroche penniless? Was the woman he was
taking as his second wife rich? Or were they both in love with each
other and did M. d'Aigleroche plan with her to kill his first wife
and the husband of his second wife? These are problems to which I
do not know the answer. They have no interest for the moment; but
the police, with all the means at their disposal, would have no
great difficulty in elucidating them."</p>

<p>M. d'Aigleroche staggered and had to steady himself against the
back of a chair. Livid in the face, he spluttered:</p>

<p>"Are you going to inform the police?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Rénine. "To begin with, there is the statute of
limitations. Then there are twenty years of remorse and dread, a
memory which will pursue the criminal to his dying hour,
accompanied no doubt by domestic discord, hatred, a daily
hell...and, in the end, the necessity of returning to the tower and
removing the traces of the two murders, the frightful punishment of
climbing that tower, of touching those skeletons, of undressing
them and burying them. That will be enough. We will not ask for
more. We will not give it to the public to batten on and create a
scandal which would recoil upon M. d'Aigleroche's niece. No, let us
leave this disgraceful business alone."</p>

<p>The count resumed his seat at the table, with his hands
clutching his forehead, and asked:</p>

<p>"Then why...?"</p>

<p>"Why do I interfere?" said Rénine. "What you mean is that I must
have had some object in speaking. That is so. There must indeed be
a penalty, however slight, and our interview must lead to some
practical result. But have no fear: M. d'Aigleroche will be let off
lightly."</p>

<p>The contest was ended. The count felt that he had only a small
formality to fulfil, a sacrifice to accept; and, recovering some of
his self-assurance, he said, in an almost sarcastic tone:</p>

<p>"What's your price?"</p>

<p>Rénine burst out laughing:</p>

<p>"Splendid! You see the position. Only, you make a mistake in
drawing me into the business. I'm working for the glory of the
thing."</p>

<p>"In that case?"</p>

<p>"You will be called upon at most to make restitution."</p>

<p>"Restitution?"</p>

<p>Rénine leant over the table and said:</p>

<p>"In one of those drawers is a deed awaiting your signature. It
is a draft agreement between you and your niece Hortense Daniel,
relating to her private fortune, which fortune was squandered and
for which you are responsible. Sign the deed."</p>

<p>M. d'Aigleroche gave a start:</p>

<p>"Do you know the amount?"</p>

<p>"I don't wish to know it."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse?..."</p>

<p>"I shall ask to see the Comtesse d'Aigleroche."</p>

<p>Without further hesitation, the count opened a drawer, produced
a document on stamped paper and quickly signed it:</p>

<p>"Here you are," he said, "and I hope..."</p>

<p>"You hope, as I do, that you and I may never have any future
dealings? I'm convinced of it. I shall leave this evening; your
niece, no doubt, tomorrow. Goodbye."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>In the drawing-room, which was still empty, while the guests at
the house were dressing for dinner, Rénine handed the deed to
Hortense. She seemed dazed by all that she had heard; and the thing
that bewildered her even more than the relentless light shed upon
her uncle's past was the miraculous insight and amazing lucidity
displayed by this man: the man who for some hours had controlled
events and conjured up before her eyes the actual scenes of a
tragedy which no one had beheld.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied with me?" he asked.</p>

<p>She gave him both her hands:</p>

<p>"You have saved me from Rossigny. You have given me back my
freedom and my independence. I thank you from the bottom of my
heart."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's not what I am asking you to say!" he answered. "My
first and main object was to amuse you. Your life seemed so humdrum
and lacking in the unexpected. Has it been so today?"</p>

<p>"How can you ask such a question? I have had the strangest and
most stirring experiences."</p>

<p>"That is life," he said. "When one knows how to use one's eyes.
Adventure exists everywhere, in the meanest hovel, under the mask
of the wisest of men. Everywhere, if you are only willing, you will
find an excuse for excitement, for doing good, for saving a victim,
for ending an injustice."</p>

<p>Impressed by his power and authority, she murmured:</p>

<p>"Who are you exactly?"</p>

<p>"An adventurer. Nothing more. A lover of adventures. Life is not
worth living except in moments of adventure, the adventures of
others or personal adventures. Today's has upset you because it
affected the innermost depths of your being. But those of others
are no less stimulating. Would you like to make the
experiment?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Become the companion of my adventures. If anyone calls on me
for help, help him with me. If chance or instinct puts me on the
track of a crime or the trace of a sorrow, let us both set out
together. Do you consent?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "but..."</p>

<p>She hesitated, as though trying to guess Rénine's secret
intentions.</p>

<p>"But," he said, expressing her thoughts for her, with a smile,
"you are a trifle sceptical. What you are saying to yourself is,
'How far does that lover of adventures want to make me go? It is
quite obvious that I attract him; and sooner or later he would not
be sorry to receive payment for his services.' You are quite right.
We must have a formal contract."</p>

<p>"Very formal," said Hortense, preferring to give a jesting tone
to the conversation. "Let me hear your proposals."</p>

<p>He reflected for a moment and continued:</p>

<p>"Well, we'll say this. The clock at Halingre gave eight strokes
this afternoon, the day of the first adventure. Will you accept its
decree and agree to carry out seven more of these delightful
enterprises with me, during a period, for instance, of three
months? And shall we say that, at the eighth, you will be pledged
to grant me..."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>He deferred his answer:</p>

<p>"Observe that you will always be at liberty to leave me on the
road if I do not succeed in interesting you. But, if you accompany
me to the end, if you allow me to begin and complete the eighth
enterprise with you, in three months, on the 5th of December, at
the very moment when the eighth stroke of that clock
sounds&mdash;and it will sound, you may be sure of that, for the
old brass pendulum will not stop swinging again&mdash;you will be
pledged to grant me..."</p>

<p>"What?" she repeated, a little unnerved by waiting.</p>

<p>He was silent. He looked at the beautiful lips which he had
meant to claim as his reward. He felt perfectly certain that
Hortense had understood and he thought it unnecessary to speak more
plainly:</p>

<p>"The mere delight of seeing you will be enough to satisfy me. It
is not for me but for you to impose conditions. Name them: what do
you demand?"</p>

<p>She was grateful for his respect and said, laughingly:</p>

<p>"What do I demand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Can I demand anything I like, however difficult and
impossible?"</p>

<p>"Everything is easy and everything is possible to the man who is
bent on winning you."</p>

<p>Then she said:</p>

<p>"I demand that you shall restore to me a small, antique clasp,
made of a cornelian set in a silver mount. It came to me from my
mother and everyone knew that it used to bring her happiness and me
too. Since the day when it vanished from my jewel-case, I have had
nothing but unhappiness. Restore it to me, my good genius."</p>

<p>"When was the clasp stolen?"</p>

<p>She answered gaily:</p>

<p>"Seven years ago...or eight...or nine; I don't know exactly...I
don't know where...I don't know how...I know nothing about
it..."</p>

<p>"I will find it," Rénine declared, "and you shall be happy."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. The Water-Bottle</h2>

<p>Four days after she had settled down in Paris, Hortense Daniel
agreed to meet Prince Rénine in the Bois. It was a glorious morning
and they sat down on the terrace of the Restaurant Impérial, a
little to one side.</p>

<p>Hortense, feeling glad to be alive, was in a playful mood, full
of attractive grace. Rénine, lest he should startle her, refrained
from alluding to the compact into which they had entered at his
suggestion. She told him how she had left La Marèze and said that
she had not heard of Rossigny.</p>

<p>"I have," said Rénine. "I've heard of him."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he sent me a challenge. We fought a duel this morning.
Rossigny got a scratch in the shoulder. That finished the duel.
Let's talk of something else."</p>

<p>There was no further mention of Rossigny. Rénine at once
expounded to Hortense the plan of two enterprises which he had in
view and in which he offered, with no great enthusiasm, to let her
share:</p>

<p>"The finest adventure," he declared, "is that which we do not
foresee. It comes unexpectedly, unannounced; and no one, save the
initiated, realizes that an opportunity to act and to expend one's
energies is close at hand. It has to be seized at once. A moment's
hesitation may mean that we are too late. We are warned by a
special sense, like that of a sleuthhound which distinguishes the
right scent from all the others that cross it."</p>

<p>The terrace was beginning to fill up around them. At the next
table sat a young man reading a newspaper. They were able to see
his insignificant profile and his long, dark moustache. From behind
them, through an open window of the restaurant, came the distant
strains of a band; in one of the rooms a few couples were
dancing.</p>

<p>As Rénine was paying for the refreshments, the young man with
the long moustache stifled a cry and, in a choking voice, called
one of the waiters:</p>

<p>"What do I owe you?...No change? Oh, good Lord, hurry up!"</p>

<p>Rénine, without a moment's hesitation, had picked up the paper.
After casting a swift glance down the page, he read, under his
breath:</p>

<p>"Maître Dourdens, the counsel for the defence in the trial of
Jacques Aubrieux, has been received at the &Eacute;lysée. We are
informed that the President of the Republic has refused to reprieve
the condemned man and that the execution will take place tomorrow
morning."</p>

<p>After crossing the terrace, the young man found himself faced,
at the entrance to the garden, by a lady and gentleman who blocked
his way; and the latter said:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, but I noticed your agitation. It's about
Jacques Aubrieux, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Jacques Aubrieux," the young man stammered. "Jacques,
the friend of my childhood. I'm hurrying to see his wife. She must
be beside herself with grief."</p>

<p>"Can I offer you my assistance? I am Prince Rénine. This lady
and I would be happy to call on Madame Aubrieux and to place our
services at her disposal."</p>

<p>The young man, upset by the news which he had read, seemed not
to understand. He introduced himself awkwardly:</p>

<p>"My name is Dutreuil, Gaston Dutreuil."</p>

<p>Rénine beckoned to his chauffeur, who was waiting at some little
distance, and pushed Gaston Dutreuil into the car, asking:</p>

<p>"What address? Where does Madame Aubrieux live?"</p>

<p>"23 <i>bis</i>, Avenue du Roule."</p>

<p>After helping Hortense in, Rénine repeated the address to the
chauffeur and, as soon as they drove off, tried to question Gaston
Dutreuil:</p>

<p>"I know very little of the case," he said. "Tell it to me as
briefly as you can. Jacques Aubrieux killed one of his near
relations, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"He is innocent, sir," replied the young man, who seemed
incapable of giving the least explanation. "Innocent, I swear it.
I've been Jacques' friend for twenty years...He is innocent...and
it would be monstrous..."</p>

<p>There was nothing to be got out of him. Besides, it was only a
short drive. They entered Neuilly through the Porte des Sablons
and, two minutes later, stopped before a long, narrow passage
between high walls which led them to a small, one-storeyed
house.</p>

<p>Gaston Dutreuil rang.</p>

<p>"Madame is in the drawing-room, with her mother," said the maid
who opened the door.</p>

<p>"I'll go in to the ladies," he said, taking Rénine and Hortense
with him.</p>

<p>It was a fair-sized, prettily-furnished room, which, in ordinary
times, must have been used also as a study. Two women sat weeping,
one of whom, elderly and grey-haired, came up to Gaston Dutreuil.
He explained the reason for Rénine's presence and she at once
cried, amid her sobs:</p>

<p>"My daughter's husband is innocent, sir. Jacques? A better man
never lived. He was so good-hearted! Murder his cousin? But he
worshipped his cousin! I swear that he's not guilty, sir! And they
are going to commit the infamy of putting him to death? Oh, sir, it
will kill my daughter!"</p>

<p>Rénine realized that all these people had been living for months
under the obsession of that innocence and in the certainty that an
innocent man could never be executed. The news of the execution,
which was now inevitable, was driving them mad.</p>

<p>He went up to a poor creature bent in two whose face, a quite
young face, framed in pretty, flaxen hair, was convulsed with
desperate grief. Hortense, who had already taken a seat beside her,
gently drew her head against her shoulder. Rénine said to her:</p>

<p>"Madame, I do not know what I can do for you. But I give you my
word of honour that, if anyone in this world can be of use to you,
it is myself. I therefore implore you to answer my questions as
though the clear and definite wording of your replies were able to
alter the aspect of things and as though you wished to make me
share your opinion of Jacques Aubrieux. For he is innocent, is he
not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, indeed he is!" she exclaimed; and the woman's whole
soul was in the words.</p>

<p>"You are certain of it. But you were unable to communicate your
certainty to the court. Well, you must now compel me to share it. I
am not asking you to go into details and to live again through the
hideous torment which you have suffered, but merely to answer
certain questions. Will you do this?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>Rénine's influence over her was complete. With a few sentences
Rénine had succeeded in subduing her and inspiring her with the
will to obey. And once more Hortense realized all the man's power,
authority and persuasion.</p>

<p>"What was your husband?" he asked, after begging the mother and
Gaston Dutreuil to preserve absolute silence.</p>

<p>"An insurance-broker."</p>

<p>"Lucky in business?"</p>

<p>"Until last year, yes."</p>

<p>"So there have been financial difficulties during the past few
months?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And the murder was committed when?"</p>

<p>"Last March, on a Sunday."</p>

<p>"Who was the victim?"</p>

<p>"A distant cousin, M. Guillaume, who lived at Suresnes."</p>

<p>"What was the sum stolen?"</p>

<p>"Sixty thousand-franc notes, which this cousin had received the
day before, in payment of a long-outstanding debt."</p>

<p>"Did your husband know that?"</p>

<p>"Yes. His cousin told him of it on the Sunday, in the course of
a conversation on the telephone, and Jacques insisted that his
cousin ought not to keep so large a sum in the house and that he
ought to pay it into a bank next day."</p>

<p>"Was this in the morning?"</p>

<p>"At one o'clock in the afternoon. Jacques was to have gone to M.
Guillaume on his motorcycle. But he felt tired and told him that he
would not go out. So he remained here all day."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The two servants were out. I went to the Cinéma des Ternes
with my mother and our friend Dutreuil. In the evening, we learnt
that M. Guillaume had been murdered. Next morning, Jacques was
arrested."</p>

<p>"On what evidence?"</p>

<p>The poor creature hesitated to reply: the evidence of guilt had
evidently been overwhelming. Then, obeying a sign from Rénine, she
answered without a pause:</p>

<p>"The murderer went to Suresnes on a motorcycle and the tracks
discovered were those of my husband's machine. They found a
handkerchief with my husband's initials; and the revolver which was
used belonged to him. Lastly, one of our neighbours maintains that
he saw my husband go out on his bicycle at three o'clock and
another that he saw him come in at half-past four. The murder was
committed at four o'clock."</p>

<p>"And what does Jacques Aubrieux say in his defence?"</p>

<p>"He declares that he slept all the afternoon. During that time,
someone came who managed to unlock the cycle-shed and take the
motorcycle to go to Suresnes. As for the handkerchief and the
revolver, they were in the tool-bag. There would be nothing
surprising in the murderer's using them."</p>

<p>"It seems a plausible explanation."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the prosecution raised two objections. In the first
place, nobody, absolutely nobody, knew that my husband was going to
stay at home all day, because, on the contrary, it was his habit to
go out on his motorcycle every Sunday afternoon."</p>

<p>"And the second objection?"</p>

<p>She flushed and murmured:</p>

<p>"The murderer went to the pantry at M. Guillaume's and drank
half a bottle of wine straight out of the bottle, which shows my
husband's fingerprints."</p>

<p>It seemed as though her strength was exhausted and as though, at
the same time, the unconscious hope which Rénine's intervention had
awakened in her had suddenly vanished before the accumulation of
adverse facts. Again she collapsed, withdrawn into a sort of silent
meditation from which Hortense's affectionate attentions were
unable to distract her.</p>

<p>The mother stammered:</p>

<p>"He's not guilty, is he, sir? And they can't punish an innocent
man. They haven't the right to kill my daughter. Oh dear, oh dear,
what have we done to be tortured like this? My poor little
Madeleine!"</p>

<p>"She will kill herself," said Dutreuil, in a scared voice. "She
will never be able to endure the idea that they are guillotining
Jacques. She will kill herself presently...this very night..."</p>

<p>Rénine was striding up and down the room.</p>

<p>"You can do nothing for her, can you?" asked Hortense.</p>

<p>"It's half-past eleven now," he replied, in an anxious tone,
"and it's to happen tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"Do you think he's guilty?"</p>

<p>"I don't know...I don't know...The poor woman's conviction is
too impressive to be neglected. When two people have lived together
for years, they can hardly be mistaken about each other to that
degree. And yet..."</p>

<p>He stretched himself out on a sofa and lit a cigarette. He
smoked three in succession, without a word from anyone to interrupt
his train of thought. From time to time he looked at his watch.
Every minute was of such importance!</p>

<p>At last he went back to Madeleine Aubrieux, took her hands and
said, very gently:</p>

<p>"You must not kill yourself. There is hope left until the last
minute has come; and I promise you that, for my part, I will not be
disheartened until that last minute. But I need your calmness and
your confidence."</p>

<p>"I will be calm," she said, with a pitiable air.</p>

<p>"And confident?"</p>

<p>"And confident."</p>

<p>"Well, wait for me. I shall be back in two hours from now. Will
you come with us, M. Dutreuil?"</p>

<p>As they were stepping into his car, he asked the young man:</p>

<p>"Do you know any small, unfrequented restaurant, not too far
inside Paris?"</p>

<p>"There's the Brasserie Lutetia, on the ground-floor of the house
in which I live, on the Place des Ternes."</p>

<p>"Capital. That will be very handy."</p>

<p>They scarcely spoke on the way. Rénine, however, said to Gaston
Dutreuil:</p>

<p>"So far as I remember, the numbers of the notes are known,
aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes. M. Guillaume had entered the sixty numbers in his
pocketbook."</p>

<p>Rénine muttered, a moment later:</p>

<p>"That's where the whole problem lies. Where are the notes? If we
could lay our hands on them, we should know everything."</p>

<p>At the Brasserie Lutetia there was a telephone in the private
room where he asked to have lunch served. When the waiter had left
him alone with Hortense and Dutreuil, he took down the receiver
with a resolute air:</p>

<p>"Hullo!...Prefecture of police, please...Hullo! Hullo!...Is that
the Prefecture of police? Please put me on to the criminal
investigation department. I have a very important communication to
make. You can say it's Prince Rénine."</p>

<p>Holding the receiver in his hand, he turned to Gaston
Dutreuil:</p>

<p>"I can ask someone to come here, I suppose? We shall be quite
undisturbed?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>He listened again:</p>

<p>"The secretary to the head of the criminal investigation
department? Oh, excellent! Mr. Secretary, I have on several
occasions been in communication with M. Dudouis and have given him
information which has been of great use to him. He is sure to
remember Prince Rénine. I may be able today to show him where the
sixty thousand-franc notes are hidden which Aubrieux the murderer
stole from his cousin. If he's interested in the proposal, beg him
to send an inspector to the Brasserie Lutetia, Place des Ternes. I
shall be there with a lady and M. Dutreuil, Aubrieux's friend. Good
day, Mr. Secretary."</p>

<p>When Rénine hung up the instrument, he saw the amazed faces of
Hortense and of Gaston Dutreuil confronting him.</p>

<p>Hortense whispered:</p>

<p>"Then you know? You've discovered...?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said, laughing.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm acting as though I knew. It's not a bad method. Let's
have some lunch, shall we?"</p>

<p>The clock marked a quarter to one.</p>

<p>"The man from the prefecture will be here," he said, "in twenty
minutes at latest."</p>

<p>"And if no one comes?" Hortense objected.</p>

<p>"That would surprise me. Of course, if I had sent a message to
M. Dudouis saying, 'Aubrieux is innocent,' I should have failed to
make any impression. It's not the least use, on the eve of an
execution, to attempt to convince the gentry of the police or of
the law that a man condemned to death is innocent. No. From
henceforth Jacques Aubrieux belongs to the executioner. But the
prospect of securing the sixty banknotes is a windfall worth taking
a little trouble over. Just think: that was the weak point in the
indictment, those sixty notes which they were unable to trace."</p>

<p>"But, as you know nothing of their whereabouts..."</p>

<p>"My dear girl&mdash;I hope you don't mind my calling you
so&mdash;my dear girl, when a man can't explain this or that
physical phenomenon, he adopts some sort of theory which explains
the various manifestations of the phenomenon and says that
everything happened as though the theory were correct. That's what
I am doing."</p>

<p>"That amounts to saying that you are going upon a
supposition?"</p>

<p>Rénine did not reply. Not until some time later, when lunch was
over, did he say:</p>

<p>"Obviously I am going upon a supposition. If I had several days
before me, I should take the trouble of first verifying my theory,
which is based upon intuition quite as much as upon a few scattered
facts. But I have only two hours; and I am embarking on the unknown
path as though I were certain that it would lead me to the
truth."</p>

<p>"And suppose you are wrong?"</p>

<p>"I have no choice. Besides, it is too late. There's a knock. Oh,
one word more! Whatever I may say, don't contradict me. Nor you, M.
Dutreuil."</p>

<p>He opened the door. A thin man, with a red imperial,
entered:</p>

<p>"Prince Rénine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. You, of course, are from M. Dudouis?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>And the newcomer gave his name:</p>

<p>"Chief-inspector Morisseau."</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you for coming so promptly, Mr.
Chief-inspector," said Prince Rénine, "and I hope that M. Dudouis
will not regret having placed you at my disposal."</p>

<p>"At your entire disposal, in addition to two inspectors whom I
have left in the square outside and who have been in the case, with
me, from the first."</p>

<p>"I shall not detain you for any length of time," said Rénine,
"and I will not even ask you to sit down. We have only a few
minutes in which to settle everything. You know what it's all
about?"</p>

<p>"The sixty thousand-franc notes stolen from M. Guillaume. I have
the numbers here."</p>

<p>Rénine ran his eyes down the slip of paper which the
chief-inspector handed him and said:</p>

<p>"That's right. The two lists agree."</p>

<p>Inspector Morisseau seemed greatly excited:</p>

<p>"The chief attaches the greatest importance to your discovery.
So you will be able to show me?..."</p>

<p>Rénine was silent for a moment and then declared:</p>

<p>"Mr. Chief-inspector, a personal investigation&mdash;and a most
exhaustive investigation it was, as I will explain to you
presently&mdash;has revealed the fact that, on his return from
Suresnes, the murderer, after replacing the motorcycle in the shed
in the Avenue du Roule, ran to the Ternes and entered this
house."</p>

<p>"This house?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But what did he come here for?"</p>

<p>"To hide the proceeds of his theft, the sixty banknotes."</p>

<p>"How do you mean? Where?"</p>

<p>"In a flat of which he had the key, on the fifth floor."</p>

<p>Gaston Dutreuil exclaimed, in amazement:</p>

<p>"But there's only one flat on the fifth floor and that's the one
I live in!"</p>

<p>"Exactly; and, as you were at the cinema with Madame Aubrieux
and her mother, advantage was taken of your absence..."</p>

<p>"Impossible! No one has the key except myself."</p>

<p>"One can get in without a key."</p>

<p>"But I have seen no marks of any kind."</p>

<p>Morisseau intervened:</p>

<p>"Come, let us understand one another. You say the banknotes were
hidden in M. Dutreuil's flat?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then, as Jacques Aubrieux was arrested the next morning, the
notes ought to be there still?"</p>

<p>"That's my opinion."</p>

<p>Gaston Dutreuil could not help laughing:</p>

<p>"But that's absurd! I should have found them!"</p>

<p>"Did you look for them?"</p>

<p>"No. But I should have come across them at any moment. The place
isn't big enough to swing a cat in. Would you care to see it?"</p>

<p>"However small it may be, it's large enough to hold sixty bits
of paper."</p>

<p>"Of course, everything is possible," said Dutreuil. "Still, I
must repeat that nobody, to my knowledge, has been to my rooms;
that there is only one key; that I am my own housekeeper; and that
I can't quite understand..."</p>

<p>Hortense too could not understand. With her eyes fixed on Prince
Rénine's, she was trying to read his innermost thoughts. What game
was he playing? Was it her duty to support his statements? She
ended by saying:</p>

<p>"Mr. Chief-inspector, since Prince Rénine maintains that the
notes have been put away upstairs, wouldn't the simplest thing be
to go and look? M. Dutreuil will take us up, won't you?"</p>

<p>"This minute," said the young man. "As you say, that will be
simplest."</p>

<p>They all four climbed the five storys of the house and, after
Dutreuil had opened the door, entered a tiny set of chambers
consisting of a sitting-room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom, all
arranged with fastidious neatness. It was easy to see that every
chair in the sitting-room occupied a definite place. The pipes had
a rack to themselves; so had the matches. Three walking-sticks,
arranged according to their length, hung from three nails. On a
little table before the window a hatbox, filled with tissue-paper,
awaited the felt hat which Dutreuil carefully placed in it. He laid
his gloves beside it, on the lid.</p>

<p>He did all this with sedate and mechanical movements, like a man
who loves to see things in the places which he has chosen for them.
Indeed, no sooner did Rénine shift something than Dutreuil made a
slight gesture of protest, took out his hat again, stuck it on his
head, opened the window and rested his elbows on the sill, with his
back turned to the room, as though he were unable to bear the sight
of such vandalism.</p>

<p>"You're positive, are you not?" the inspector asked Rénine.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I'm positive that the sixty notes were brought here
after the murder."</p>

<p>"Let's look for them."</p>

<p>This was easy and soon done. In half an hour, not a corner
remained unexplored, not a knickknack unlifted.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Inspector Morisseau. "Shall we continue?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Rénine, "The notes are no longer here."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that they have been removed."</p>

<p>"By whom? Can't you make a more definite accusation?"</p>

<p>Rénine did not reply. But Gaston Dutreuil wheeled round. He was
choking and spluttered:</p>

<p>"Mr. Inspector, would you like <i>me</i> to make the accusation
more definite, as conveyed by this gentleman's remarks? It all
means that there's a dishonest man here, that the notes hidden by
the murderer were discovered and stolen by that dishonest man and
deposited in another and safer place. That is your idea, sir, is it
not? And you accuse me of committing this theft don't you?"</p>

<p>He came forward, drumming his chest with his fists: "Me! Me! I
found the notes, did I, and kept them for myself? You dare to
suggest that!"</p>

<p>Rénine still made no reply. Dutreuil flew into a rage and,
taking Inspector Morisseau aside, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Mr. Inspector, I strongly protest against all this farce and
against the part which you are unconsciously playing in it. Before
your arrival, Prince Rénine told this lady and myself that he knew
nothing, that he was venturing into this affair at random and that
he was following the first road that offered, trusting to luck. Do
you deny it, sir?"</p>

<p>Rénine did not open his lips.</p>

<p>"Answer me, will you? Explain yourself; for, really, you are
putting forward the most improbable facts without any proof
whatever. It's easy enough to say that I stole the notes. And how
were you to know that they were here at all? Who brought them here?
Why should the murderer choose this flat to hide them in? It's all
so stupid, so illogical and absurd!...Give us your proofs,
sir...one single proof!"</p>

<p>Inspector Morisseau seemed perplexed. He questioned Rénine with
a glance. Rénine said:</p>

<p>"Since you want specific details, we will get them from Madame
Aubrieux herself. She's on the telephone. Let's go downstairs. We
shall know all about it in a minute."</p>

<p>Dutreuil shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>"As you please; but what a waste of time!"</p>

<p>He seemed greatly irritated. His long wait at the window, under
a blazing sun, had thrown him into a sweat. He went to his bedroom
and returned with a bottle of water, of which he took a few sips,
afterwards placing the bottle on the windowsill:</p>

<p>"Come along," he said.</p>

<p>Prince Rénine chuckled.</p>

<p>"You seem to be in a hurry to leave the place."</p>

<p>"I'm in a hurry to show you up," retorted Dutreuil, slamming the
door.</p>

<p>They went downstairs to the private room containing the
telephone. The room was empty. Rénine asked Gaston Dutreuil for the
Aubrieuxs' number, took down the instrument and was put
through.</p>

<p>The maid who came to the telephone answered that Madame Aubrieux
had fainted, after giving way to an access of despair, and that she
was now asleep.</p>

<p>"Fetch her mother, please. Prince Rénine speaking. It's
urgent."</p>

<p>He handed the second receiver to Morisseau. For that matter, the
voices were so distinct that Dutreuil and Hortense were able to
hear every word exchanged.</p>

<p>"Is that you, madame?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Prince Rénine, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Prince Rénine."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, what news have you for me? Is there any hope?" asked
the old lady, in a tone of entreaty.</p>

<p>"The enquiry is proceeding very satisfactorily," said Rénine,
"and you may hope for the best. For the moment, I want you to give
me some very important particulars. On the day of the murder, did
Gaston Dutreuil come to your house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he came to fetch my daughter and myself, after lunch."</p>

<p>"Did he know at the time that M. Guillaume had sixty thousand
francs at his place?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I told him."</p>

<p>"And that Jacques Aubrieux was not feeling very well and was
proposing not to take his usual cycle-ride but to stay at home and
sleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are sure?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely certain."</p>

<p>"And you all three went to the cinema together?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you were all sitting together?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! There was no room. He took a seat farther away."</p>

<p>"A seat where you could see him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But he came to you during the interval?"</p>

<p>"No, we did not see him until we were going out."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of that?"</p>

<p>"None at all."</p>

<p>"Very well, madame. I will tell you the result of my efforts in
an hour's time. But above all, don't wake up Madame Aubrieux."</p>

<p>"And suppose she wakes of her own accord?"</p>

<p>"Reassure her and give her confidence. Everything is going well,
very well indeed."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and turned to Dutreuil, laughing:</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, my boy! Things are beginning to look clearer. What do
you say?"</p>

<p>It was difficult to tell what these words meant or what
conclusions Rénine had drawn from his conversation. The silence was
painful and oppressive.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chief-Inspector, you have some of your men outside, haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"Two detective-sergeants."</p>

<p>"It's important that they should be there. Please also ask the
manager not to disturb us on any account."</p>

<p>And, when Morisseau returned, Rénine closed the door, took his
stand in front of Dutreuil and, speaking in a good-humoured but
emphatic tone, said:</p>

<p>"It amounts to this, young man, that the ladies saw nothing of
you between three and five o'clock on that Sunday. That's rather a
curious detail."</p>

<p>"A perfectly natural detail," Dutreuil retorted, "and one,
moreover, which proves nothing at all."</p>

<p>"It proves, young man, that you had a good two hours at your
disposal."</p>

<p>"Obviously. Two hours which I spent at the cinema."</p>

<p>"Or somewhere else."</p>

<p>Dutreuil looked at him:</p>

<p>"Somewhere else?"</p>

<p>"Yes. As you were free, you had plenty of time to go wherever
you liked...to Suresnes, for instance."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the young man, jesting in his turn. "Suresnes is a
long way off!"</p>

<p>"It's quite close! Hadn't you your friend Jacques Aubrieux's
motorcycle?"</p>

<p>A fresh pause followed these words. Dutreuil had knitted his
brows as though he were trying to understand. At last he was heard
to whisper:</p>

<p>"So that is what he was trying to lead up to!...The
brute!..."</p>

<p>Rénine brought down his hand on Dutreuil's shoulder:</p>

<p>"No more talk! Facts! Gaston Dutreuil, you are the only person
who on that day knew two essential things: first, that Cousin
Guillaume had sixty thousand francs in his house; secondly, that
Jacques Aubrieux was not going out. You at once saw your chance.
The motorcycle was available. You slipped out during the
performance. You went to Suresnes. You killed Cousin Guillaume. You
took the sixty banknotes and left them at your rooms. And at five
o'clock you went back to fetch the ladies."</p>

<p>Dutreuil had listened with an expression at once mocking and
flurried, casting an occasional glance at Inspector Morisseau as
though to enlist him as a witness:</p>

<p>"The man's mad," it seemed to say. "It's no use being angry with
him."</p>

<p>When Rénine had finished, he began to laugh:</p>

<p>"Very funny!...A capital joke!...So it was I whom the neighbours
saw going and returning on the motorcycle?"</p>

<p>"It was you disguised in Jacques Aubrieux's clothes."</p>

<p>"And it was my fingerprints that were found on the bottle in M.
Guillaume's pantry?"</p>

<p>"The bottle had been opened by Jacques Aubrieux at lunch, in his
own house, and it was you who took it with you to serve as
evidence."</p>

<p>"Funnier and funnier!" cried Dutreuil, who had the air of being
frankly amused. "Then I contrived the whole affair so that Jacques
Aubrieux might be accused of the crime?"</p>

<p>"It was the safest means of not being accused yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes, but Jacques is a friend whom I have known from
childhood."</p>

<p>"You're in love with his wife."</p>

<p>The young man gave a sudden, infuriated start:</p>

<p>"You dare!...What! You dare make such an infamous
suggestion?"</p>

<p>"I have proof of it."</p>

<p>"That's a lie! I have always respected Madeleine Aubrieux and
revered her..."</p>

<p>"Apparently. But you're in love with her. You desire her. Don't
contradict me. I have abundant proof of it."</p>

<p>"That's a lie, I tell you! You have only known me a few
hours!"</p>

<p>"Come, come! I've been quietly watching you for days, waiting
for the moment to pounce upon you."</p>

<p>He took the young man by the shoulders and shook him:</p>

<p>"Come, Dutreuil, confess! I hold all the proofs in my hand. I
have witnesses whom we shall meet presently at the criminal
investigation department. Confess, can't you? In spite of
everything, you're tortured by remorse. Remember your dismay, at
the restaurant, when you had seen the newspaper. What? Jacques
Aubrieux condemned to die? That's more than you bargained for!
Penal servitude would have suited your book; but the
scaffold!...Jacques Aubrieux executed tomorrow, an innocent
man!...Confess, won't you? Confess to save your own skin! Own
up!"</p>

<p>Bending over the other, he was trying with all his might to
extort a confession from him. But Dutreuil drew himself up and
coldly, with a sort of scorn in his voice, said:</p>

<p>"Sir, you are a madman. Not a word that you have said has any
sense in it. All your accusations are false. What about the
banknotes? Did you find them at my place as you said you
would?"</p>

<p>Rénine, exasperated, clenched his fist in his face:</p>

<p>"Oh, you swine, I'll dish you yet, I swear I will!"</p>

<p>He drew the inspector aside:</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say to it? An arrant rogue, isn't he?"</p>

<p>The inspector nodded his head:</p>

<p>"It may be...But, all the same...so far there's no real
evidence."</p>

<p>"Wait, M. Morisseau," said Rénine. "Wait until we've had our
interview with M. Dudouis. For we shall see M. Dudouis at the
prefecture, shall we not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he'll be there at three o'clock."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll be convinced, Mr. Inspector! I tell you here and
now that you will be convinced."</p>

<p>Rénine was chuckling like a man who feels certain of the course
of events. Hortense, who was standing near him and was able to
speak to him without being heard by the others, asked, in a low
voice:</p>

<p>"You've got him, haven't you?"</p>

<p>He nodded his head in assent:</p>

<p>"Got him? I should think I have! All the same, I'm no farther
forward than I was at the beginning."</p>

<p>"But this is awful! And your proofs?"</p>

<p>"Not the shadow of a proof...I was hoping to trip him up. But
he's kept his feet, the rascal!"</p>

<p>"Still, you're certain it's he?"</p>

<p>"It can't be anyone else. I had an intuition at the very outset;
and I've not taken my eyes off him since. I have seen his anxiety
increasing as my investigations seemed to centre on him and concern
him more closely. Now I know."</p>

<p>"And he's in love with Madame Aubrieux?"</p>

<p>"In logic, he's bound to be. But so far we have only
hypothetical suppositions, or rather certainties which are personal
to myself. We shall never intercept the guillotine with those. Ah,
if we could only find the banknotes! Given the banknotes, M.
Dudouis would act. Without them, he will laugh in my face."</p>

<p>"What then?" murmured Hortense, in anguished accents.</p>

<p>He did not reply. He walked up and down the room, assuming an
air of gaiety and rubbing his hands. All was going so well! It was
really a treat to take up a case which, so to speak, worked itself
out automatically.</p>

<p>"Suppose we went on to the prefecture, M. Morisseau? The chief
must be there by now. And, having gone so far, we may as well
finish. Will M. Dutreuil come with us?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Dutreuil, arrogantly.</p>

<p>But, just as Rénine was opening the door, there was a noise in
the passage and the manager ran up, waving his arms:</p>

<p>"Is M. Dutreuil still here?... M. Dutreuil, your flat is on
fire!...A man outside told us. He saw it from the square."</p>

<p>The young man's eyes lit up. For perhaps half a second his mouth
was twisted by a smile which Rénine noticed:</p>

<p>"Oh, you ruffian!" he cried. "You've given yourself away, my
beauty! It was you who set fire to the place upstairs; and now the
notes are burning."</p>

<p>He blocked his exit.</p>

<p>"Let me pass," shouted Dutreuil. "There's a fire and no one can
get in, because no one else has a key. Here it is. Let me pass,
damn it!"</p>

<p>Rénine snatched the key from his hand and, holding him by the
collar of his coat:</p>

<p>"Don't you move, my fine fellow! The game's up! You precious
blackguard! M. Morisseau, will you give orders to the sergeant not
to let him out of his sight and to blow out his brains if he tries
to get away? Sergeant, we rely on you! Put a bullet into him, if
necessary!..."</p>

<p>He hurried up the stairs, followed by Hortense and the chief
inspector, who was protesting rather peevishly:</p>

<p>"But, I say, look here, it wasn't he who set the place on fire!
How do you make out that he set it on fire, seeing that he never
left us?"</p>

<p>"Why, he set it on fire beforehand, to be sure!"</p>

<p>"How? I ask you, how?"</p>

<p>"How do I know? But a fire doesn't break out like that, for no
reason at all, at the very moment when a man wants to burn
compromising papers."</p>

<p>They heard a commotion upstairs. It was the waiters of the
restaurant trying to burst the door open. An acrid smell filled the
well of the staircase.</p>

<p>Rénine reached the top floor:</p>

<p>"By your leave, friends. I have the key."</p>

<p>He inserted it in the lock and opened the door.</p>

<p>He was met by a gust of smoke so dense that one might well have
supposed the whole floor to be ablaze. Rénine at once saw that the
fire had gone out of its own accord, for lack of fuel, and that
there were no more flames:</p>

<p>"M. Morisseau, you won't let anyone come in with us, will you?
An intruder might spoil everything. Bolt the door, that will be
best."</p>

<p>He stepped into the front room, where the fire had obviously had
its chief centre. The furniture, the walls and the ceiling, though
blackened by the smoke, had not been touched. As a matter of fact,
the fire was confined to a blaze of papers which was still burning
in the middle of the room, in front of the window.</p>

<p>Rénine struck his forehead:</p>

<p>"What a fool I am! What an unspeakable ass!"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the inspector.</p>

<p>"The hatbox, of course! The cardboard hatbox which was standing
on the table. That's where he hid the notes. They were there all
through our search."</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, we always overlook that particular hiding-place, the
one just under our eyes, within reach of our hands! How could one
imagine that a thief would leave sixty thousand francs in an open
cardboard box, in which he places his hat when he comes in, with an
absentminded air? That's just the one place we don't look in...Well
played, M. Dutreuil!"</p>

<p>The inspector, who remained incredulous, repeated:</p>

<p>"No, no, impossible! We were with him and he could not have
started the fire himself."</p>

<p>"Everything was prepared beforehand on the supposition that
there might be an alarm...The hatbox...the tissue paper...the
banknotes: they must all have been steeped in some inflammable
liquid. He must have thrown a match, a chemical preparation or
whatnot into it, as we were leaving."</p>

<p>"But we should have seen him, hang it all! And then is it
credible that a man who has committed a murder for the sake of
sixty thousand francs should do away with the money in this way? If
the hiding-place was such a good one&mdash;and it was, because we
never discovered it&mdash;why this useless destruction?"</p>

<p>"He got frightened, M. Morisseau. Remember that his head is at
stake and he knows it. Anything rather than the guillotine; and
they&mdash;the banknotes&mdash;were the only proof which we had
against him. How could he have left them where they were?"</p>

<p>Morisseau was flabbergasted:</p>

<p>"What! The only proof?"</p>

<p>"Why, obviously!"</p>

<p>"But your witnesses? Your evidence? All that you were going to
tell the chief?"</p>

<p>"Mere bluff."</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word," growled the bewildered inspector, "you're
a cool customer!"</p>

<p>"Would you have taken action without my bluff?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then what more do you want?"</p>

<p>Rénine stooped to stir the ashes. But there was nothing left,
not even those remnants of stiff paper which still retain their
shape.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said. "It's queer, all the same! How the deuce did
he manage to set the thing alight?"</p>

<p>He stood up, looking attentively about him. Hortense had a
feeling that he was making his supreme effort and that, after this
last struggle in the dark, he would either have devised his plan of
victory or admit that he was beaten.</p>

<p>Faltering with anxiety, she asked:</p>

<p>"It's all up, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, thoughtfully, "it's not all up. It was, a few
seconds ago. But now there is a gleam of light...and one that gives
me hope."</p>

<p>"God grant that it may be justified!"</p>

<p>"We must go slowly," he said. "It is only an attempt, but a
fine, a very fine attempt; and it may succeed."</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment; then, with an amused smile and a
click of the tongue, he said:</p>

<p>"An infernally clever fellow, that Dutreuil! His trick of
burning the notes: what a fertile imagination! And what coolness! A
pretty dance the beggar has led me! He's a master!"</p>

<p>He fetched a broom from the kitchen and swept a part of the
ashes into the next room, returning with a hatbox of the same size
and appearance as the one which had been burnt. After crumpling the
tissue paper with which it was filled, he placed the hatbox on the
little table and set fire to it with a match.</p>

<p>It burst into flames, which he extinguished when they had
consumed half the cardboard and nearly all the paper. Then he took
from an inner pocket of his waistcoat a bundle of banknotes and
selected six, which he burnt almost completely, arranging the
remains and hiding the rest of the notes at the bottom of the box,
among the ashes and the blackened bits of paper:</p>

<p>"M. Morisseau," he said, when he had done, "I am asking for your
assistance for the last time. Go and fetch Dutreuil. Tell him just
this: 'You are unmasked. The notes did not catch fire. Come with
me.' And bring him up here."</p>

<p>Despite his hesitation and his fear of exceeding his
instructions from the head of the detective service, the
chief-inspector was powerless to throw off the ascendancy which
Rénine had acquired over him. He left the room.</p>

<p>Rénine turned to Hortense:</p>

<p>"Do you understand my plan of battle?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "but it's a dangerous experiment. Do you think
that Dutreuil will fall into the trap?"</p>

<p>"Everything depends on the state of his nerves and the degree of
demoralization to which he is reduced. A surprise attack may very
well do for him."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, suppose he recognizes by some sign that the box
has been changed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, he has a few chances in his favour! The fellow
is much more cunning than I thought and quite capable of wriggling
out of the trap. On the other hand, however, how uneasy he must be!
How the blood must be buzzing in his ears and obscuring his sight!
No, I don't think that he will avoid the trap...He will give
in...He will give in..."</p>

<p>They exchanged no more words. Rénine did not move. Hortense was
stirred to the very depths of her being. The life of an innocent
man hung trembling in the balance. An error of judgment, a little
bad luck...and, twelve hours later, Jacques Aubrieux would be put
to death. And together with a horrible anguish she experienced, in
spite of all, a feeling of eager curiosity. What was Prince Rénine
going to do? What would be the outcome of the experiment on which
he was venturing? What resistance would Gaston Dutreuil offer? She
lived through one of those minutes of superhuman tension in which
life becomes intensified until it reaches its utmost value.</p>

<p>They heard footsteps on the stairs, the footsteps of men in a
hurry. The sound drew nearer. They were reaching the top floor.</p>

<p>Hortense looked at her companion. He had stood up and was
listening, his features already transfigured by action. The
footsteps were now echoing in the passage. Then, suddenly, he ran
to the door and cried:</p>

<p>"Quick! Let's make an end of it!"</p>

<p>Two or three detectives and a couple of waiters entered. He
caught hold of Dutreuil in the midst of the detectives and pulled
him by the arm, gaily exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Well done, old man! That trick of yours with the table and the
water-bottle was really splendid! A masterpiece, on my word! Only,
it didn't come off!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What's the matter?" mumbled Gaston Dutreuil,
staggering.</p>

<p>"What I say: the fire burnt only half the tissue-paper and the
hatbox; and, though some of the banknotes were destroyed, like the
tissue-paper, the others are there, at the bottom...You understand?
The long-sought notes, the great proof of the murder: they're
there, where you hid them...As chance would have it, they've
escaped burning...Here, look: there are the numbers; you can check
them...Oh, you're done for, done for, my beauty!"</p>

<p>The young man drew himself up stiffly. His eyelids quivered. He
did not accept Rénine's invitation to look; he examined neither the
hatbox nor the banknotes. From the first moment, without taking the
time to reflect and before his instinct could warn him, he believed
what he was told and collapsed heavily into a chair, weeping.</p>

<p>The surprise attack, to use Rénine's expression, had succeeded.
On seeing all his plans baffled and the enemy master of his
secrets, the wretched man had neither the strength nor the
perspicacity necessary to defend himself. He threw up the
sponge.</p>

<p>Rénine gave him no time to breathe:</p>

<p>"Capital! You're saving your head; and that's all, my good
youth! Write down your confession and get it off your chest. Here's
a fountain-pen...The luck has been against you, I admit. It was
devilishly well thought out, your trick of the last moment. You had
the banknotes which were in your way and which you wanted to
destroy. Nothing simpler. You take a big, round-bellied
water-bottle and stand it on the windowsill. It acts as a
burning-glass, concentrating the rays of the sun on the cardboard
and tissue-paper, all nicely prepared. Ten minutes later, it bursts
into flames. A splendid idea! And, like all great discoveries, it
came quite by chance, what? It reminds one of Newton's apple...One
day, the sun, passing through the water in that bottle, must have
set fire to a scrap of cotton or the head of a match; and, as you
had the sun at your disposal just now, you said to yourself, 'Now's
the time,' and stood the bottle in the right position. My
congratulations, Gaston!...Look, here's a sheet of paper. Write
down: 'It was I who murdered M. Guillaume.' Write, I tell you!"</p>

<p>Leaning over the young man, with all his implacable force of
will he compelled him to write, guiding his hand and dictating the
sentences. Dutreuil, exhausted, at the end of his strength, wrote
as he was told.</p>

<p>"Here's the confession, Mr. Chief-inspector," said Rénine. "You
will be good enough to take it to M. Dudouis. These gentlemen,"
turning to the waiters, from the restaurant, "will, I am sure,
consent to serve as witnesses."</p>

<p>And, seeing that Dutreuil, overwhelmed by what had happened, did
not move, he gave him a shake:</p>

<p>"Hi, you, look alive! Now that you've been fool enough to
confess, make an end of the job, my gentle idiot!"</p>

<p>The other watched him, standing in front of him.</p>

<p>"Obviously," Rénine continued, "you're only a simpleton. The
hatbox was fairly burnt to ashes: so were the notes. That hatbox,
my dear fellow, is a different one; and those notes belong to me. I
even burnt six of them to make you swallow the stunt. And you
couldn't make out what had happened. What an owl you must be! To
furnish me with evidence at the last moment, when I hadn't a single
proof of my own! And such evidence! A written confession! Written
before witnesses!...Look here, my man, if they do cut off your
head&mdash;as I sincerely hope they will&mdash;upon my word, you'll
have jolly well deserved it! Goodbye, Dutreuil!"</p>

<p>Downstairs, in the street, Rénine asked Hortense Daniel to take
the car, go to Madeleine Aubrieux and tell her what had
happened.</p>

<p>"And you?" asked Hortense.</p>

<p>"I have a lot to do...urgent appointments..."</p>

<p>"And you deny yourself the pleasure of bringing the good
news?"</p>

<p>"It's one of the pleasures that pall upon one. The only pleasure
that never flags is that of the fight itself. Afterwards, things
cease to be interesting."</p>

<p>She took his hand and for a moment held it in both her own. She
would have liked to express all her admiration to that strange man,
who seemed to do good as a sort of game and who did it with
something like genius. But she was unable to speak. All these rapid
incidents had upset her. Emotion constricted her throat and brought
the tears to her eyes.</p>

<p>Rénine bowed his head, saying:</p>

<p>"Thank you. I have my reward."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. The Case of Jean Louis</h2>

<p>"Monsieur," continued the young girl, addressing Serge Rénine,
"it was while I was spending the Easter holidays at Nice with my
father that I made the acquaintance of Jean Louis
d'Imbleval..."</p>

<p>Rénine interrupted her:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, mademoiselle, but just now you spoke of this young
man as Jean Louis Vaurois."</p>

<p>"That's his name also," she said.</p>

<p>"Has he two names then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know...I don't know anything about it," she said, with
some embarrassment, "and that is why, by Hortense's advice, I came
to ask for your help."</p>

<p>This conversation was taking place in Rénine's flat on the
Boulevard Haussmann, to which Hortense had brought her friend
Geneviève Aymard, a slender, pretty little creature with a face
overshadowed by an expression of the greatest melancholy.</p>

<p>"Rénine will be successful, take my word for it, Geneviève. You
will, Rénine, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Please tell me the rest of the story, mademoiselle," he
said.</p>

<p>Geneviève continued:</p>

<p>"I was already engaged at the time to a man whom I loathe and
detest. My father was trying to force me to marry him and is still
trying to do so. Jean Louis and I felt the keenest sympathy for
each other, a sympathy that soon developed into a profound and
passionate affection which, I can assure you, was equally sincere
on both sides. On my return to Paris, Jean Louis, who lives in the
country with his mother and his aunt, took rooms in our part of the
town; and, as I am allowed to go out by myself, we used to see each
other daily. I need not tell you that we were engaged to be
married. I told my father so. And this is what he said: 'I don't
particularly like the fellow. But, whether it's he or another, what
I want is that you should get married. So let him come and ask for
your hand. If not, you must do as I say.' In the middle of June,
Jean Louis went home to arrange matters with his mother and aunt. I
received some passionate letters; and then just these few
words:</p>

<p class="letter">There are too many obstacles in the way of our
happiness. I give up. I am mad with despair. I love you more than
ever. Goodbye and forgive me.</p>

<p>"Since then, I have received nothing: no reply to my letters and
telegrams."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has fallen in love with somebody else?" asked
Rénine. "Or there may be some old connection which he is unable to
shake off."</p>

<p>Geneviève shook her head:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, believe me, if our engagement had been broken off for
an ordinary reason, I should not have allowed Hortense to trouble
you. But it is something quite different, I am absolutely
convinced. There's a mystery in Jean Louis' life, or rather an
endless number of mysteries which hamper and pursue him. I never
saw such distress in a human face; and, from the first moment of
our meeting, I was conscious in him of a grief and melancholy which
have always persisted, even at times when he was giving himself to
our love with the greatest confidence."</p>

<p>"But your impression must have been confirmed by minor details,
by things which happened to strike you as peculiar?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite know what to say."</p>

<p>"These two names, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there was certainly that."</p>

<p>"By what name did he introduce himself to you?"</p>

<p>"Jean Louis d'Imbleval."</p>

<p>"But Jean Louis Vaurois?"</p>

<p>"That's what my father calls him."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because that was how he was introduced to my father, at Nice,
by a gentleman who knew him. Besides, he carries visiting-cards
which describe him under either name."</p>

<p>"Have you never questioned him on this point?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have, twice. The first time, he said that his aunt's
name was Vaurois and his mother's d'Imbleval."</p>

<p>"And the second time?"</p>

<p>"He told me the contrary: he spoke of his mother as Vaurois and
of his aunt as d'Imbleval. I pointed this out. He coloured up and I
thought it better not to question him any further."</p>

<p>"Does he live far from Paris?"</p>

<p>"Right down in Brittany: at the Manoir d'Elseven, five miles
from Carhaix."</p>

<p>Rénine rose and asked the girl, seriously:</p>

<p>"Are you quite certain that he loves you, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"I am certain of it and I know too that he represents all my
life and all my happiness. He alone can save me. If he can't, then
I shall be married in a week's time to a man whom I hate. I have
promised my father; and the banns have been published."</p>

<p>"We shall leave for Carhaix, Madame Daniel and I, this evening,"
said Rénine.</p>

<p>That evening he and Hortense took the train for Brittany. They
reached Carhaix at ten o'clock in the morning; and, after lunch, at
half past twelve o'clock they stepped into a car borrowed from a
leading resident of the district.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>"You're looking a little pale, my dear," said Rénine, with a
laugh, as they alighted by the gate of the garden at Elseven.</p>

<p>"I'm very fond of Geneviève," she said. "She's the only friend I
have. And I'm feeling frightened."</p>

<p>He called her attention to the fact that the central gate was
flanked by two wickets bearing the names of Madame d'Imbleval and
Madame Vaurois respectively. Each of these wickets opened on a
narrow path which ran among the shrubberies of box and aucuba to
the left and right of the main avenue. The avenue itself led to an
old manor-house, long, low and picturesque, but provided with two
clumsily-built, ugly wings, each in a different style of
architecture and each forming the destination of one of the
side-paths. Madame d'Imbleval evidently lived on the left and
Madame Vaurois on the right.</p>

<p>Hortense and Rénine listened. Shrill, hasty voices were
disputing inside the house. The sound came through one of the
windows of the ground-floor, which was level with the garden and
covered throughout its length with red creepers and white
roses.</p>

<p>"We can't go any farther," said Hortense. "It would be
indiscreet."</p>

<p>"All the more reason," whispered Rénine. "Look here: if we walk
straight ahead, we shan't be seen by the people who are
quarrelling."</p>

<p>The sounds of conflict were by no means abating; and, when they
reached the window next to the front-door, through the roses and
creepers they could both see and hear two old ladies shrieking at
the tops of their voices and shaking their fists at each other.</p>

<p>The women were standing in the foreground, in a large
dining-room where the table was not yet cleared; and at the farther
side of the table sat a young man, doubtless Jean Louis himself,
smoking his pipe and reading a newspaper, without appearing to
trouble about the two old harridans.</p>

<p>One of these, a thin, tall woman, was wearing a purple silk
dress; and her hair was dressed in a mass of curls much too yellow
for the ravaged face around which they tumbled. The other, who was
still thinner, but quite short, was bustling round the room in a
cotton dressing-gown and displayed a red, painted face blazing with
anger:</p>

<p>"A baggage, that's what you are!" she yelped. "The wickedest
woman in the world and a thief into the bargain!"</p>

<p>"I, a thief!" screamed the other.</p>

<p>"What about that business with the ducks at ten francs apiece:
don't you call that thieving?"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, you low creature! Who stole the fifty-franc
note from my dressing-table? Lord, that I should have to live with
such a wretch!"</p>

<p>The other started with fury at the outrage and, addressing the
young man, cried:</p>

<p>"Jean, are you going to sit there and let me be insulted by your
hussy of a d'Imbleval?"</p>

<p>And the tall one retorted, furiously:</p>

<p>"Hussy! Do you hear that, Louis? Look at her, your Vaurois!
She's got the airs of a superannuated barmaid! Make her stop, can't
you?"</p>

<p>Suddenly Jean Louis banged his fist upon the table, making the
plates and dishes jump, and shouted:</p>

<p>"Be quiet, both of you, you old lunatics!"</p>

<p>They turned upon him at once and loaded him with abuse:</p>

<p>"Coward!...Hypocrite!...Liar!...A pretty sort of son you
are!...The son of a slut and not much better yourself!..."</p>

<p>The insults rained down upon him. He stopped his ears with his
fingers and writhed as he sat at table like a man who has lost all
patience and has need to restrain himself lest he should fall upon
his enemy.</p>

<p>Rénine whispered:</p>

<p>"Now's the time to go in."</p>

<p>"In among all those infuriated people?" protested Hortense.</p>

<p>"Exactly. We shall see them better with their masks off."</p>

<p>And, with a determined step, he walked to the door, opened it
and entered the room, followed by Hortense.</p>

<p>His advent gave rise to a feeling of stupefaction. The two women
stopped yelling, but were still scarlet in the face and trembling
with rage. Jean Louis, who was very pale, stood up.</p>

<p>Profiting by the general confusion, Rénine said briskly:</p>

<p>"Allow me to introduce myself. I am Prince Rénine. This is
Madame Daniel. We are friends of Mlle. Geneviève Aymard and we have
come in her name. I have a letter from her addressed to you,
monsieur."</p>

<p>Jean Louis, already disconcerted by the newcomers' arrival, lost
countenance entirely on hearing the name of Geneviève. Without
quite knowing what he was saying and with the intention of
responding to Rénine's courteous behaviour, he tried in his turn to
introduce the two ladies and let fall the astounding words:</p>

<p>"My mother, Madame d'Imbleval; my mother, Madame Vaurois."</p>

<p>For some time no one spoke. Rénine bowed. Hortense did not know
with whom she should shake hands, with Madame d'Imbleval, the
mother, or with Madame Vaurois, the mother. But what happened was
that Madame d'Imbleval and Madame Vaurois both at the same time
attempted to snatch the letter which Rénine was holding out to Jean
Louis, while both at the same time mumbled:</p>

<p>"Mlle. Aymard!...She has had the coolness...she has had the
audacity...!"</p>

<p>Then Jean Louis, recovering his self-possession, laid hold of
his mother d'Imbleval and pushed her out of the room by a door on
the left and next of his mother Vaurois and pushed her out of the
room by a door on the right. Then, returning to his two visitors,
he opened the envelope and read, in an undertone:</p>

<p class="letter">I am to be married in a week, Jean Louis. Come to
my rescue, I beseech you. My friend Hortense and Prince Rénine will
help you to overcome the obstacles that baffle you. Trust them. I
love you.<br>
<br>
Geneviève.</p>

<p>He was a rather dull-looking young man, whose very swarthy, lean
and bony face certainly bore the expression of melancholy and
distress described by Geneviève. Indeed, the marks of suffering
were visible in all his harassed features, as well as in his sad
and anxious eyes.</p>

<p>He repeated Geneviève's name over and over again, while looking
about him with a distracted air. He seemed to be seeking a course
of conduct.</p>

<p>He seemed on the point of offering an explanation but could find
nothing to say. The sudden intervention had taken him at a
disadvantage, like an unforseen attack which he did not know how to
meet.</p>

<p>Rénine felt that the adversary would capitulate at the first
summons. The man had been fighting so desperately during the last
few months and had suffered so severely in the retirement and
obstinate silence in which he had taken refuge that he was not
thinking of defending himself. Moreover, how could he do so, now
that they had forced their way into the privacy of his odious
existence?</p>

<p>"Take my word for it, monsieur," declared Rénine, "that it is in
your best interests to confide in us. We are Geneviève Aymard's
friends. Do not hesitate to speak."</p>

<p>"I can hardly hesitate," he said, "after what you have just
heard. This is the life I lead, monsieur. I will tell you the whole
secret, so that you may tell it to Geneviève. She will then
understand why I have not gone back to her...and why I have not the
right to do so."</p>

<p>He pushed a chair forward for Hortense. The two men sat down,
and, without any need of further persuasion, rather as though he
himself felt a certain relief in unburdening himself, he said:</p>

<p>"You must not be surprised, monsieur, if I tell my story with a
certain flippancy, for, as a matter of fact, it is a frankly
comical story and cannot fail to make you laugh. Fate often amuses
itself by playing these imbecile tricks, these monstrous farces
which seem as though they must have been invented by the brain of a
madman or a drunkard. Judge for yourself. Twenty-seven years ago,
the Manoir d'Elseven, which at that time consisted only of the main
building, was occupied by an old doctor who, to increase his modest
means, used to receive one or two paying guests. In this way,
Madame d'Imbleval spent the summer here one year and Madame Vaurois
the following summer. Now these two ladies did not know each other.
One of them was married to a Breton of a merchant-vessel and the
other to a commercial traveller from the Vendée.</p>

<p>"It so happened that they lost their husbands at the same time,
at a period when each of them was expecting a baby. And, as they
both lived in the country, at places some distance from any town,
they wrote to the old doctor that they intended to come to his
house for their confinement...He agreed. They arrived almost on the
same day, in the autumn. Two small bedrooms were prepared for them,
behind the room in which we are sitting. The doctor had engaged a
nurse, who slept in this very room. Everything was perfectly
satisfactory. The ladies were putting the finishing touches to
their baby-clothes and were getting on together splendidly. They
were determined that their children should be boys and had chosen
the names of Jean and Louis respectively...One evening the doctor
was called out to a case and drove off in his gig with the
manservant, saying that he would not be back till next day. In her
master's absence, a little girl who served as maid-of-all-work ran
out to keep company with her sweetheart. These accidents destiny
turned to account with diabolical malignity. At about midnight,
Madame d'Imbleval was seized with the first pains. The nurse, Mlle.
Boussignol, had had some training as a midwife and did not lose her
head. But, an hour later, Madame Vaurois' turn came; and the
tragedy, or I might rather say the tragicomedy, was enacted amid
the screams and moans of the two patients and the bewildered
agitation of the nurse running from one to the other, bewailing her
fate, opening the window to call out for the doctor or falling on
her knees to implore the aid of Providence...Madame Vaurois was the
first to bring a son into the world. Mlle. Boussignol hurriedly
carried him in here, washed and tended him and laid him in the
cradle prepared for him...But Madame d'Imbleval was screaming with
pain; and the nurse had to attend to her while the newborn child
was yelling like a stuck pig and the terrified mother, unable to
stir from her bed, fainted...Add to this all the wretchedness of
darkness and disorder, the only lamp, without any oil, for the
servant had neglected to fill it, the candles burning out, the
moaning of the wind, the screeching of the owls, and you will
understand that Mlle. Boussignol was scared out of her wits.
However, at five o'clock in the morning, after many tragic
incidents, she came in here with the d'Imbleval baby, likewise a
boy, washed and tended him, laid him in his cradle and went off to
help Madame Vaurois, who had come to herself and was crying out,
while Madame d'Imbleval had fainted in her turn. And, when Mlle.
Boussignol, having settled the two mothers, but half-crazed with
fatigue, her brain in a whirl, returned to the newborn children,
she realized with horror that she had wrapped them in similar
binders, thrust their feet into similar woolen socks and laid them
both, side by side, <i>in the same cradle</i>, so that it was
impossible to tell Louis d'Imbleval from Jean Vaurois!...To make
matters worse, when she lifted one of them out of the cradle, she
found that his hands were cold as ice and that he had ceased to
breathe. He was dead. What was his name and what the
survivor's?...Three hours later, the doctor found the two women in
a condition of frenzied delirium, while the nurse was dragging
herself from one bed to the other, entreating the two mothers to
forgive her. She held me out first to one, then to the other, to
receive their caresses&mdash;for I was the surviving
child&mdash;and they first kissed me and then pushed me away; for,
after all, who was I? The son of the widowed Madame d'Imbleval and
the late merchant-captain or the son of the widowed Madame Vaurois
and the late commercial traveller? There was not a clue by which
they could tell...The doctor begged each of the two mothers to
sacrifice her rights, at least from the legal point of view, so
that I might be called either Louis d'Imbleval or Jean Vaurois.
They refused absolutely. 'Why Jean Vaurois, if he's a d'Imbleval?'
protested the one. 'Why Louis d'Imbleval, if he's a Vaurois?'
retorted the other. And I was registered under the name of Jean
Louis, the son of an unknown father and mother."</p>

<p>Prince Rénine had listened in silence. But Hortense, as the
story approached its conclusion, had given way to a hilarity which
she could no longer restrain and suddenly, in spite of all her
efforts, she burst into a fit of the wildest laughter:</p>

<p>"Forgive me," she said, her eyes filled with tears, "do forgive
me; it's too much for my nerves..."</p>

<p>"Don't apologize, madame," said the young man, gently, in a
voice free from resentment. "I warned you that my story was
laughable; I, better than anyone, know how absurd, how nonsensical
it is. Yes, the whole thing is perfectly grotesque. But believe me
when I tell you that it was no fun in reality. It seems a humorous
situation and it remains humorous by the force of circumstances;
but it is also horrible. You can see that for yourself, can't you?
The two mothers, neither of whom was certain of being a mother, but
neither of whom was certain that she was not one, both clung to
Jean Louis. He might be a stranger; on the other hand, he might be
their own flesh and blood. They loved him to excess and fought for
him furiously. And, above all, they both came to hate each other
with a deadly hatred. Differing completely in character and
education and obliged to live together because neither was willing
to forego the advantage of her possible maternity, they lived the
life of irreconcilable enemies who can never lay their weapons
aside...I grew up in the midst of this hatred and had it instilled
into me by both of them. When my childish heart, hungering for
affection, inclined me to one of them, the other would seek to
inspire me with loathing and contempt for her. In this manor-house,
which they bought on the old doctor's death and to which they added
the two wings, I was the involuntary torturer and their daily
victim. Tormented as a child, and, as a young man, leading the most
hideous of lives, I doubt if anyone on earth ever suffered more
than I did."</p>

<p>"You ought to have left them!" exclaimed Hortense, who had
stopped laughing.</p>

<p>"One can't leave one's mother; and one of those two women was my
mother. And a woman can't abandon her son; and each of them was
entitled to believe that I was her son. We were all three chained
together like convicts, with chains of sorrow, compassion, doubt
and also of hope that the truth might one day become apparent. And
here we still are, all three, insulting one another and blaming one
another for our wasted lives. Oh, what a hell! And there was no
escaping it. I tried often enough...but in vain. The broken bonds
became tied again. Only this summer, under the stimulus of my love
for Geneviève, I tried to free myself and did my utmost to persuade
the two women whom I call mother. And then...and then! I was up
against their complaints, their immediate hatred of the wife, of
the stranger, whom I was proposing to force upon them...I gave way.
What sort of a life would Geneviève have had here, between Madame
d'Imbleval and Madame Vaurois? I had no right to victimize
her."</p>

<p>Jean Louis, who had been gradually becoming excited, uttered
these last words in a firm voice, as though he would have wished
his conduct to be ascribed to conscientious motives and a sense of
duty. In reality, as Rénine and Hortense clearly saw, his was an
unusually weak nature, incapable of reacting against a ridiculous
position from which he had suffered ever since he was a child and
which he had come to look upon as final and irremediable. He
endured it as a man bears a cross which he has no right to cast
aside; and at the same time he was ashamed of it. He had never
spoken of it to Geneviève, from dread of ridicule; and afterwards,
on returning to his prison, he had remained there out of habit and
weakness.</p>

<p>He sat down to a writing-table and quickly wrote a letter which
he handed to Rénine:</p>

<p>"Would you be kind enough to give this note to Mlle. Aymard and
beg her once more to forgive me?"</p>

<p>Rénine did not move and, when the other pressed the letter upon
him, he took it and tore it up.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" asked the young man.</p>

<p>"It means that I will not charge myself with any message."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you are coming with us."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You will see Mlle. Aymard tomorrow and ask for her hand in
marriage."</p>

<p>Jean Louis looked at Rénine with a rather disdainful air, as
though he were thinking:</p>

<p>"Here's a man who has not understood a word of what I've been
explaining to him."</p>

<p>But Hortense went up to Rénine:</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"Because it will be as I say."</p>

<p>"But you must have your reasons?"</p>

<p>"One only; but it will be enough, provided this gentleman is so
kind as to help me in my enquiries."</p>

<p>"Enquiries? With what object?" asked the young man.</p>

<p>"With the object of proving that your story is not quite
accurate."</p>

<p>Jean Louis took umbrage at this:</p>

<p>"I must ask you to believe, monsieur, that I have not said a
word which is not the exact truth."</p>

<p>"I expressed myself badly," said Rénine, with great kindliness.
"Certainly you have not said a word that does not agree with what
you believe to be the exact truth. But the truth is not, cannot be
what you believe it to be."</p>

<p>The young man folded his arms:</p>

<p>"In any case, monsieur, it seems likely that I should know the
truth better than you do."</p>

<p>"Why better? What happened on that tragic night can obviously be
known to you only at secondhand. You have no proofs. Neither have
Madame d'Imbleval and Madame Vaurois."</p>

<p>"No proofs of what?" exclaimed Jean Louis, losing patience.</p>

<p>"No proofs of the confusion that took place."</p>

<p>"What! Why, it's an absolute certainty! The two children were
laid in the same cradle, with no marks to distinguish one from the
other; and the nurse was unable to tell..."</p>

<p>"At least, that's her version of it," interrupted Rénine.</p>

<p>"What's that? Her version? But you're accusing the woman."</p>

<p>"I'm accusing her of nothing."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are: you're accusing her of lying. And why should she
lie? She had no interest in doing so; and her tears and despair are
so much evidence of her good faith. For, after all, the two mothers
were there...they saw the woman weeping...they questioned her...And
then, I repeat, what interest had she...?"</p>

<p>Jean Louis was greatly excited. Close beside him, Madame
d'Imbleval and Madame Vaurois, who had no doubt been listening
behind the doors and who had stealthily entered the room, stood
stammering, in amazement:</p>

<p>"No, no...it's impossible...We've questioned her over and over
again. Why should she tell a lie?..."</p>

<p>"Speak, monsieur, speak," Jean Louis enjoined. "Explain
yourself. Give your reasons for trying to cast doubt upon an
absolute truth!"</p>

<p>"Because that truth is inadmissible," declared Rénine, raising
his voice and growing excited in turn to the point of punctuating
his remarks by thumping the table. "No, things don't happen like
that. No, fate does not display those refinements of cruelty and
chance is not added to chance with such reckless extravagance! It
was already an unprecedented chance that, on the very night on
which the doctor, his manservant and his maid were out of the
house, the two ladies should be seized with labour-pains at the
same hour and should bring two sons into the world at the same
time. Don't let us add a still more exceptional event! Enough of
the uncanny! Enough of lamps that go out and candles that refuse to
burn! No and again no, it is not admissable that a midwife should
become confused in the essential details of her trade. However
bewildered she may be by the unforeseen nature of the
circumstances, a remnant of instinct is still on the alert, so that
there is a place prepared for each child and each is kept distinct
from the other. The first child is here, the second is there. Even
if they are lying side by side, one is on the left and the other on
the right. Even if they are wrapped in the same kind of binders,
some little detail differs, a trifle which is recorded by the
memory and which is inevitably recalled to the mind without any
need of reflection. Confusion? I refuse to believe in it.
Impossible to tell one from the other? It isn't true. In the world
of fiction, yes, one can imagine all sorts of fantastic accidents
and heap contradiction on contradiction. But, in the world of
reality, at the very heart of reality, there is always a fixed
point, a solid nucleus, about which the facts group themselves in
accordance with a logical order. I therefore declare most
positively that Nurse Boussignol could not have mixed up the two
children."</p>

<p>All this he said decisively, as though he had been present
during the night in question; and so great was his power of
persuasion that from the very first he shook the certainty of those
who for more than a quarter of a century had never doubted.</p>

<p>The two women and their son pressed round him and questioned him
with breathless anxiety:</p>

<p>"Then you think that she may know...that she may be able to tell
us...?"</p>

<p>He corrected himself:</p>

<p>"I don't say yes and I don't say no. All I say is that there was
something in her behaviour during those hours that does not tally
with her statements and with reality. All the vast and intolerable
mystery that has weighed down upon you three arises not from a
momentary lack of attention but from something of which we do not
know, but of which she does. That is what I maintain; and that is
what happened."</p>

<p>Jean Louis said, in a husky voice:</p>

<p>"She is alive...She lives at Carhaix...We can send for
her..."</p>

<p>Hortense at once proposed:</p>

<p>"Would you like me to go for her? I will take the motor and
bring her back with me. Where does she live?"</p>

<p>"In the middle of the town, at a little draper's shop. The
chauffeur will show you. Mlle. Boussignol: everybody knows
her..."</p>

<p>"And, whatever you do," added Rénine, "don't warn her in any
way. If she's uneasy, so much the better. But don't let her know
what we want with her."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes passed in absolute silence. Rénine paced the
room, in which the fine old furniture, the handsome tapestries, the
well-bound books and pretty knickknacks denoted a love of art and a
seeking after style in Jean Louis. This room was really his. In the
adjoining apartments on either side, through the open doors, Rénine
was able to note the bad taste of the two mothers.</p>

<p>He went up to Jean Louis and, in a low voice, asked:</p>

<p>"Are they well off?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"They settled the manor-house upon me, with all the land around
it, which makes me quite independent."</p>

<p>"Have they any relations?"</p>

<p>"Sisters, both of them."</p>

<p>"With whom they could go to live?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and they have sometimes thought of doing so. But there
can't be any question of that. Once more, I assure you..."</p>

<p>Meantime the car had returned. The two women jumped up
hurriedly, ready to speak.</p>

<p>"Leave it to me," said Rénine, "and don't be surprised by
anything that I say. It's not a matter of asking her questions but
of frightening her, of flurrying her...The sudden attack," he added
between his teeth.</p>

<p>The car drove round the lawn and drew up outside the windows.
Hortense sprang out and helped an old woman to alight, dressed in a
fluted linen cap, a black velvet bodice and a heavy gathered
skirt.</p>

<p>The old woman entered in a great state of alarm. She had a
pointed face, like a weasel's, with a prominent mouth full of
protruding teeth.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Madame d'Imbleval?" she asked, timidly
stepping into the room from which the doctor had once driven her.
"Good day to you, Madame Vaurois."</p>

<p>The ladies did not reply. Rénine came forward and said,
sternly:</p>

<p>"Mlle. Boussignol, I have been sent by the Paris police to throw
light upon a tragedy which took place here twenty-seven years ago.
I have just secured evidence that you have distorted the truth and
that, as the result of your false declarations, the
birth-certificate of one of the children born in the course of that
night is inaccurate. Now false declarations in matters of
birth-certificates are misdemeanours punishable by law. I shall
therefore be obliged to take you to Paris to be
interrogated...unless you are prepared here and now to confess
everything that might repair the consequences of your offence."</p>

<p>The old maid was shaking in every limb. Her teeth were
chattering. She was evidently incapable of opposing the least
resistance to Rénine.</p>

<p>"Are you ready to confess everything?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she panted.</p>

<p>"Without delay? I have to catch a train. The business must be
settled immediately. If you show the least hesitation, I take you
with me. Have you made up your mind to speak?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He pointed to Jean Louis:</p>

<p>"Whose son is this gentleman? Madame d'Imbleval's?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Madame Vaurois', therefore?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>A stupefied silence welcomed the two replies.</p>

<p>"Explain yourself," Rénine commanded, looking at his watch.</p>

<p>Then Madame Boussignol fell on her knees and said, in so low and
dull a voice that they had to bend over her in order to catch the
sense of what she was mumbling:</p>

<p>"Someone came in the evening...a gentleman with a newborn baby
wrapped in blankets, which he wanted the doctor to look after. As
the doctor wasn't there, he waited all night and it was he who did
it all."</p>

<p>"Did what?" asked Rénine. "What did he do? What happened?"</p>

<p>"Well, what happened was that it was not one child but the two
of them that died: Madame d'Imbleval's and Madame Vaurois' too,
both in convulsions. Then the gentleman, seeing this, said, 'This
shows me where my duty lies. I must seize this opportunity of
making sure that my own boy shall be happy and well cared for. Put
him in the place of one of the dead children.' He offered me a big
sum of money, saying that this one payment would save him the
expense of providing for his child every month; and I accepted.
Only, I did not know in whose place to put him and whether to say
that the boy was Louis d'Imbleval or Jean Vaurois. The gentleman
thought a moment and said neither. Then he explained to me what I
was to do and what I was to say after he had gone. And, while I was
dressing his boy in vest and binders the same as one of the dead
children, he wrapped the other in the blankets he had brought with
him and went out into the night."</p>

<p>Mlle. Boussignol bent her head and wept. After a moment, Rénine
said:</p>

<p>"Your deposition agrees with the result of my
investigations."</p>

<p>"Can I go?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And is it over, as far as I'm concerned? They won't be talking
about this all over the district?"</p>

<p>"No. Oh, just one more question: do you know the man's
name?"</p>

<p>"No. He didn't tell me his name."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen him since?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Have you anything more to say?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Are you prepared to sign the written text of your
confession?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well. I shall send for you in a week or two. Till then,
not a word to anybody."</p>

<p>He saw her to the door and closed it after her. When he
returned, Jean Louis was between the two old ladies and all three
were holding hands. The bond of hatred and wretchedness which had
bound them had suddenly snapped; and this rupture, without
requiring them to reflect upon the matter, filled them with a
gentle tranquillity of which they were hardly conscious, but which
made them serious and thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Let's rush things," said Rénine to Hortense. "This is the
decisive moment of the battle. We must get Jean Louis on
board."</p>

<p>Hortense seemed preoccupied. She whispered:</p>

<p>"Why did you let the woman go? Were you satisfied with her
statement?"</p>

<p>"I don't need to be satisfied. She told us what happened. What
more do you want?"</p>

<p>"Nothing...I don't know..."</p>

<p>"We'll talk about it later, my dear. For the moment, I repeat,
we must get Jean Louis on board. And
immediately...Otherwise..."</p>

<p>He turned to the young man:</p>

<p>"You agree with me, don't you, that, things being as they are,
it is best for you and Madame Vaurois and Madame d'Imbleval to
separate for a time? That will enable you all to see matters more
clearly and to decide in perfect freedom what is to be done. Come
with us, monsieur. The most pressing thing is to save Geneviève
Aymard, your <i>fiancée</i>."</p>

<p>Jean Louis stood perplexed and undecided. Rénine turned to the
two women:</p>

<p>"That is your opinion too, I am sure, ladies?"</p>

<p>They nodded.</p>

<p>"You see, monsieur," he said to Jean Louis, "we are all agreed.
In great crises, there is nothing like separation...a few days'
respite. Quickly now, monsieur."</p>

<p>And, without giving him time to hesitate, he drove him towards
his bedroom to pack up.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Jean Louis left the manor-house with his new
friends.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>"And he won't go back until he's married," said Rénine to
Hortense, as they were waiting at Carhaix station, to which the car
had taken them, while Jean Louis was attending to his luggage.
"Everything's for the best. Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Geneviève will be glad," she replied, absently.</p>

<p>When they had taken their seats in the train, Rénine and she
repaired to the dining-car. Rénine, who had asked Hortense several
questions to which she had replied only in monosyllables,
protested:</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, my child? You look worried!"</p>

<p>"I? Not at all!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know you. Now, no secrets, no mysteries!"</p>

<p>She smiled:</p>

<p>"Well, since you insist on knowing if I am satisfied, I am bound
to admit that of course I am...as regards my friend Geneviève, but
that, in another respect&mdash;from the point of view of the
adventure&mdash;I have an uncomfortable sort of feeling..."</p>

<p>"To speak frankly, I haven't 'staggered' you this time?"</p>

<p>"Not very much."</p>

<p>"I seem to you to have played a secondary part. For, after all,
what have I done? We arrived. We listened to Jean Louis' tale of
woe. I had a midwife fetched. And that was all."</p>

<p>"Exactly. I want to know if that <i>was</i> all; and I'm not
quite sure. To tell you the truth, our other adventures left behind
them an impression which was&mdash;how shall I put it&mdash;more
definite, clearer."</p>

<p>"And this one strikes you as obscure?"</p>

<p>"Obscure, yes, and incomplete."</p>

<p>"But in what way?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Perhaps it has something to do with that woman's
confession. Yes, very likely that is it. It was all so unexpected
and so short."</p>

<p>"Well, of course, I cut it short, as you can readily imagine!"
said Rénine, laughing. "We didn't want too many explanations."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, if she had given her explanations with too much detail, we
should have ended by doubting what she was telling us."</p>

<p>"By doubting it?"</p>

<p>"Well, hang it all, the story is a trifle farfetched! That
fellow arriving at night, with a live baby in his pocket, and going
away with a dead one: the thing hardly holds water. But you see, my
dear, I hadn't much time to coach the unfortunate woman in her
part."</p>

<p>Hortense stared at him in amazement:</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know how dull-witted these countrywomen are. And she
and I had no time to spare. So we worked out a little scene in a
hurry...and she really didn't act it so badly. It was all in the
right key: terror, tremolo, tears..."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" murmured Hortense. "Is it possible? You had
seen her beforehand?"</p>

<p>"I had to, of course."</p>

<p>"But when?"</p>

<p>"This morning, when we arrived. While you were titivating
yourself at the hotel at Carhaix, I was running round to see what
information I could pick up. As you may imagine, everybody in the
district knows the d'Imbleval-Vaurois story. I was at once directed
to the former midwife, Mlle. Boussignol. With Mlle. Boussignol it
did not take long. Three minutes to settle a new version of what
had happened and ten thousand francs to induce her to repeat
that...more or less credible...version to the people at the
manor-house."</p>

<p>"A quite incredible version!"</p>

<p>"Not so bad as all that, my child, seeing that you believed
it...and the others too. And that was the essential thing. What I
had to do was to demolish at one blow a truth which had been
twenty-seven years in existence and which was all the more firmly
established because it was founded on actual facts. That was why I
went for it with all my might and attacked it by sheer force of
eloquence. Impossible to identify the children? I deny it.
Inevitable confusion? It's not true. 'You're all three,' I say,
'the victims of something which I don't know but which it is your
duty to clear up!' 'That's easily done,' says Jean Louis, whose
conviction is at once shaken. 'Let's send for Mlle. Boussignol.'
'Right! Let's send for her.' Whereupon Mlle. Boussignol arrives and
mumbles out the little speech which I have taught her. Sensation!
General stupefaction...of which I take advantage to carry off our
young man!"</p>

<p>Hortense shook her head:</p>

<p>"But they'll get over it, all three of them, on thinking!"</p>

<p>"Never! Never! They will have their doubts, perhaps. But they
will never consent to feel certain! They will never agree to think!
Use your imagination! Here are three people whom I have rescued
from the hell in which they have been floundering for a quarter of
a century. Do you think they're going back to it? Here are three
people who, from weakness or a false sense of duty, had not the
courage to escape. Do you think that they won't cling like grim
death to the liberty which I'm giving them? Nonsense! Why, they
would have swallowed a hoax twice as difficult to digest as that
which Mlle. Boussignol dished up for them! After all, my version
was no more absurd than the truth. On the contrary. And they
swallowed it whole! Look at this: before we left, I heard Madame
d'Imbleval and Madame Vaurois speak of an immediate removal. They
were already becoming quite affectionate at the thought of seeing
the last of each other."</p>

<p>"But what about Jean Louis?"</p>

<p>"Jean Louis? Why, he was fed up with his two mothers! By Jingo,
one can't do with two mothers in a lifetime! What a situation! And
when one has the luck to be able to choose between having two
mothers or none at all, why, bless me, one doesn't hesitate! And,
besides, Jean Louis is in love with Geneviève." He laughed. "And he
loves her well enough, I hope and trust, not to inflict two
mothers-in-law upon her! Come, you may be easy in your mind. Your
friend's happiness is assured; and that is all you asked for. All
that matters is the object which we achieve and not the more or
less peculiar nature of the methods which we employ. And, if some
adventures are wound up and some mysteries elucidated by looking
for and finding cigarette-ends, or incendiary water-bottles and
blazing hatboxes as on our last expedition, others call for
psychology and for purely psychological solutions. I have spoken.
And I charge you to be silent."</p>

<p>"Silent?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there's a man and woman sitting behind us who seem to be
saying something uncommonly interesting."</p>

<p>"But they're talking in whispers."</p>

<p>"Just so. When people talk in whispers, it's always about
something shady."</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette and sat back in his chair. Hortense listened,
but in vain. As for him, he was emitting little slow puffs of
smoke.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, the train stopped and the man and woman
got out.</p>

<p>"Pity," said Rénine, "that I don't know their names or where
they're going. But I know where to find them. My dear, we have a
new adventure before us."</p>

<p>Hortense protested:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, please, not yet!...Give me a little rest!...And
oughtn't we to think of Geneviève?"</p>

<p>He seemed greatly surprised:</p>

<p>"Why, all that's over and done with! Do you mean to say you want
to waste any more time over that old story? Well, I for my part
confess that I've lost all interest in the man with the two
mammas."</p>

<p>And this was said in such a comical tone and with such diverting
sincerity that Hortense was once more seized with a fit of
giggling. Laughter alone was able to relax her exasperated nerves
and to distract her from so many contradictory emotions.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. The Tell-tale Film</h2>

<p>"Do look at the man who's playing the butler," said Serge
Rénine.</p>

<p>"What is there peculiar about him?" asked Hortense.</p>

<p>They were sitting in the balcony at a picture-palace, to which
Hortense had asked to be taken so that she might see on the screen
the daughter of a lady, now dead, who used to give her
piano-lessons. Rose Andrée, a lovely girl with lissome movements
and a smiling face, was that evening figuring in a new film, <i>The
Happy Princess</i>, which she lit up with her high spirits and her
warm, glowing beauty.</p>

<p>Rénine made no direct reply, but, during a pause in the
performance, continued:</p>

<p>"I sometimes console myself for an indifferent film by watching
the subordinate characters. It seems to me that those poor devils,
who are made to rehearse certain scenes ten or twenty times over,
must often be thinking of other things than their parts at the time
of the final exposure. And it's great fun noting those little
moments of distraction which reveal something of their temperament,
of their instinct self. As, for instance, in the case of that
butler: look!"</p>

<p>The screen now showed a luxuriously served table. The Happy
Princess sat at the head, surrounded by all her suitors.
Half-a-dozen footmen moved about the room, under the orders of the
butler, a big fellow with a dull, coarse face, a common appearance
and a pair of enormous eyebrows which met across his forehead in a
single line.</p>

<p>"He looks a brute," said Hortense, "but what do you see in him
that's peculiar?"</p>

<p>"Just note how he gazes at the princess and tell me if he
doesn't stare at her oftener than he ought to."</p>

<p>"I really haven't noticed anything, so far," said Hortense.</p>

<p>"Why, of course he does!" Serge Rénine declared. "It is quite
obvious that in actual life he entertains for Rose Andrée personal
feelings which are quite out of place in a nameless servant. It is
possible that, in real life, no one has any idea of such a thing;
but, on the screen, when he is not watching himself, or when he
thinks that the actors at rehearsal cannot see him, his secret
escapes him. Look..."</p>

<p>The man was standing still. It was the end of dinner. The
princess was drinking a glass of champagne and he was gloating over
her with his glittering eyes half-hidden behind their heavy
lids.</p>

<p>Twice again they surprised in his face those strange expressions
to which Rénine ascribed an emotional meaning which Hortense
refused to see:</p>

<p>"It's just his way of looking at people," she said.</p>

<p>The first part of the film ended. There were two parts, divided
by an entr'acte. The notice on the programme stated that "a year
had elapsed and that the Happy Princess was living in a pretty
Norman cottage, all hung with creepers, together with her husband,
a poor musician."</p>

<p>The princess was still happy, as was evident on the screen,
still as attractive as ever and still besieged by the greatest
variety of suitors. Nobles and commoners, peasants and financiers,
men of all kinds fell swooning at her feet; and prominent among
them was a sort of boorish solitary, a shaggy, half-wild
woodcutter, whom she met whenever she went out for a walk. Armed
with his axe, a formidable, crafty being, he prowled around the
cottage; and the spectators felt with a sense of dismay that a
peril was hanging over the Happy Princess' head.</p>

<p>"Look at that!" whispered Rénine. "Do you realise who the man of
the woods is?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Simply the butler. The same actor is doubling the two
parts."</p>

<p>In fact, notwithstanding the new figure which he cut, the
butler's movements and postures were apparent under the heavy gait
and rounded shoulders of the woodcutter, even as under the unkempt
beard and long, thick hair the once clean-shaven face was visible
with the cruel expression and the bushy line of the eyebrows.</p>

<p>The princess, in the background, was seen to emerge from the
thatched cottage. The man hid himself behind a clump of trees. From
time to time, the screen displayed, on an enormously enlarged
scale, his fiercely rolling eyes or his murderous hands with their
huge thumbs.</p>

<p>"The man frightens me," said Hortense. "He is really
terrifying."</p>

<p>"Because he's acting on his own account," said Rénine. "You must
understand that, in the space of three or four months that appears
to separate the dates at which the two films were made, his passion
has made progress; and to him it is not the princess who is coming
but Rose Andrée."</p>

<p>The man crouched low. The victim approached, gaily and
unsuspectingly. She passed, heard a sound, stopped and looked about
her with a smiling air which became attentive, then uneasy, and
then more and more anxious. The woodcutter had pushed aside the
branches and was coming through the copse.</p>

<p>They were now standing face to face. He opened his arms as
though to seize her. She tried to scream, to call out for help; but
the arms closed around her before she could offer the slightest
resistance. Then he threw her over his shoulder and began to
run.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied?" whispered Rénine. "Do you think that this
fourth-rate actor would have had all that strength and energy if it
had been any other woman than Rose Andrée?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the woodcutter was crossing the skirt of a forest and
plunging through great trees and masses of rocks. After setting the
princess down, he cleared the entrance to a cave which the daylight
entered by a slanting crevice.</p>

<p>A succession of views displayed the husband's despair, the
search and the discovery of some small branches which had been
broken by the princess and which showed the path that had been
taken. Then came the final scene, with the terrible struggle
between the man and the woman when the woman, vanquished and
exhausted, is flung to the ground, the sudden arrival of the
husband and the shot that puts an end to the brute's life...</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>"Well," said Rénine, when they had left the
picture-palace&mdash;and he spoke with a certain gravity&mdash;"I
maintain that the daughter of your old piano-teacher has been in
danger ever since the day when that last scene was filmed. I
maintain that this scene represents not so much an assault by the
man of the woods on the Happy Princess as a violent and frantic
attack by an actor on the woman he desires. Certainly it all
happened within the bounds prescribed by the part and nobody saw
anything in it&mdash;nobody except perhaps Rose Andrée
herself&mdash;but I, for my part, have detected flashes of passion
which leave not a doubt in my mind. I have seen glances that
betrayed the wish and even the intention to commit murder. I have
seen clenched hands, ready to strangle, in short, a score of
details which prove to me that, at that time, the man's instinct
was urging him to kill the woman who could never be his."</p>

<p>"And it all amounts to what?"</p>

<p>"We must protect Rose Andrée if she is still in danger and if it
is not too late."</p>

<p>"And to do this?"</p>

<p>"We must get hold of further information."</p>

<p>"From whom?"</p>

<p>"From the World's Cinema Company, which made the film. I will go
to them tomorrow morning. Will you wait for me in your flat about
lunchtime?"</p>

<p>At heart, Hortense was still sceptical. All these manifestations
of passion, of which she denied neither the ardour nor the
ferocity, seemed to her to be the rational behaviour of a good
actor. She had seen nothing of the terrible tragedy which Rénine
contended that he had divined; and she wondered whether he was not
erring through an excess of imagination.</p>

<p>"Well," she asked, next day, not without a touch of irony, "how
far have you got? Have you made a good bag? Anything mysterious?
Anything thrilling?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good."</p>

<p>"Oh, really? And your so-called lover..."</p>

<p>"Is one Dalbrèque, originally a scene-painter, who played the
butler in the first part of the film and the man of the woods in
the second and was so much appreciated that they engaged him for a
new film. Consequently, he has been acting lately. He was acting
near Paris. But, on the morning of Friday the 18th of September, he
broke into the garage of the World's Cinema Company and made off
with a magnificent car and forty thousand francs in money.
Information was lodged with the police; and on the Sunday the car
was found a little way outside Dreux. And up to now the enquiry has
revealed two things, which will appear in the papers tomorrow:
first, Dalbrèque is alleged to have committed a murder which
created a great stir last year, the murder of Bourguet, the
jeweller; secondly, on the day after his two robberies, Dalbrèque
was driving through Le Havre in a motorcar with two men who helped
him to carry off, in broad daylight and in a crowded street, a lady
whose identity has not yet been discovered."</p>

<p>"Rose Andrée?" asked Hortense, uneasily.</p>

<p>"I have just been to Rose Andrée's: the World's Cinema Company
gave me her address. Rose Andrée spent this summer travelling and
then stayed for a fortnight in the Seine-inférieure, where she has
a small place of her own, the actual cottage in <i>The Happy
Princess</i>. On receiving an invitation from America to do a film
there, she came back to Paris, registered her luggage at the Gare
Saint-Lazare and left on Friday the 18th of September, intending to
sleep at Le Havre and take Saturday's boat."</p>

<p>"Friday the 18th," muttered Hortense, "the same day on which
that man..."</p>

<p>"And it was on the Saturday that a woman was carried off by him
at Le Havre. I looked in at the Compagnie Transatlantique and a
brief investigation showed that Rose Andrée had booked a cabin but
that the cabin remained unoccupied. The passenger did not turn
up."</p>

<p>"This is frightful. She has been carried off. You were
right."</p>

<p>"I fear so."</p>

<p>"What have you decided to do?"</p>

<p>"Adolphe, my chauffeur, is outside with the car. Let us go to Le
Havre. Up to the present, Rose Andrée's disappearance does not seem
to have become known. Before it does and before the police identify
the woman carried off by Dalbrèque with the woman who did not turn
up to claim her cabin, we will get on Rose Andrée's track."</p>

<p>There was not much said on the journey. At four o'clock Hortense
and Rénine reached Rouen. But here Rénine changed his road.</p>

<p>"Adolphe, take the left bank of the Seine."</p>

<p>He unfolded a motoring-map on his knees and, tracing the route
with his finger, showed Hortense that, if you draw a line from Le
Havre, or rather from Quillebeuf, where the road crosses the Seine,
to Dreux, where the stolen car was found, this line passes through
Routot, a market-town lying west of the forest of Brotonne:</p>

<p>"Now it was in the forest of Brotonne," he continued, "according
to what I heard, that the second part of <i>The Happy Princess</i>
was filmed. And the question that arises is this: having got hold
of Rose Andrée, would it not occur to Dalbrèque, when passing near
the forest on the Saturday night, to hide his prey there, while his
two accomplices went on to Dreux and from there returned to Paris?
The cave was quite near. Was he not bound to go to it? How should
he do otherwise? Wasn't it while running to this cave, a few months
ago, that he held in his arms, against his breast, within reach of
his lips, the woman whom he loved and whom he has now conquered? By
every rule of fate and logic, the adventure is being repeated all
over again...but this time in reality. Rose Andrée is a captive.
There is no hope of rescue. The forest is vast and lonely. That
night, or on one of the following nights, Rose Andrée must
surrender...or die."</p>

<p>Hortense gave a shudder:</p>

<p>"We shall be too late. Besides, you don't suppose that he's
keeping her a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. The place I have in mind is at a crossroads and
is not a safe retreat. But we may discover some clue or other."</p>

<p>The shades of night were falling from the tall trees when they
entered the ancient forest of Brotonne, full of Roman remains and
medieval relics. Rénine knew the forest well and remembered that
near a famous oak, known as the Wine-cask, there was a cave which
must be the cave of the Happy Princess. He found it easily,
switched on his electric torch, rummaged in the dark corners and
brought Hortense back to the entrance:</p>

<p>"There's nothing inside," he said, "but here is the evidence
which I was looking for. Dalbrèque was obsessed by the recollection
of the film, but so was Rose Andrée. The Happy Princess had broken
off the tips of the branches on the way through the forest. Rose
Andrée has managed to break off some to the right of this opening,
in the hope that she would be discovered as on the first
occasion."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hortense, "it's a proof that she has been here; but
the proof is three weeks old. Since that time..."</p>

<p>"Since that time, she is either dead and buried under a heap of
leaves or else alive in some hole even lonelier than this."</p>

<p>"If so, where is he?"</p>

<p>Rénine pricked up his ears. Repeated blows of the axe were
sounding from some distance, no doubt coming from a part of the
forest that was being cleared.</p>

<p>"He?" said Rénine, "I wonder whether he may not have continued
to behave under the influence of the film and whether the man of
the woods in <i>The Happy Princess</i> has not quite naturally
resumed his calling. For how is the man to live, to obtain his
food, without attracting attention? He will have found a job."</p>

<p>"We can't make sure of that."</p>

<p>"We might, by questioning the woodcutters whom we can hear."</p>

<p>The car took them by a forest-road to another crossroads where
they entered on foot a track which was deeply rutted by
wagon-wheels. The sound of axes ceased. After walking for a quarter
of an hour, they met a dozen men who, having finished work for the
day, were returning to the villages near by.</p>

<p>"Will this path take us to Routot?" ask Rénine, in order to open
a conversation with them.</p>

<p>"No, you're turning your backs on it," said one of the men,
gruffly.</p>

<p>And he went on, accompanied by his mates.</p>

<p>Hortense and Rénine stood rooted to the spot. They had
recognized the butler. His cheeks and chin were shaved, but his
upper lip was covered by a black moustache, evidently dyed. The
eyebrows no longer met and were reduced to normal dimensions.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Thus, in less than twenty hours, acting on the vague hints
supplied by the bearing of a film-actor, Serge Rénine had touched
the very heart of the tragedy by means of purely psychological
arguments.</p>

<p>"Rose Andrée is alive," he said. "Otherwise Dalbrèque would have
left the country. The poor thing must be imprisoned and bound up;
and he takes her some food at night."</p>

<p>"We will save her, won't we?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, by keeping a watch on him and, if necessary, but in
the last resort, compelling him by force to give up his
secret."</p>

<p>They followed the woodcutter at a distance and, on the pretext
that the car needed overhauling, engaged rooms in the principal inn
at Routot.</p>

<p>Attached to the inn was a small café from which they were
separated by the entrance to the yard and above which were two
rooms, reached by a wooden outer staircase, at one side. Dalbrèque
occupied one of these rooms and Rénine took the other for his
chauffeur.</p>

<p>Next morning he learnt from Adolphe that Dalbrèque, on the
previous evening, after all the lights were out, had carried down a
bicycle from his room and mounted it and had not returned until
shortly before sunrise.</p>

<p>The bicycle tracks led Rénine to the uninhabited Château des
Landes, five miles from the village. They disappeared in a rocky
path which ran beside the park down to the Seine, opposite the
Jumièges peninsula.</p>

<p>Next night, he took up his position there. At eleven o'clock,
Dalbrèque climbed a bank, scrambled over a wire fence, hid his
bicycle under the branches and moved away. It seemed impossible to
follow him in the pitchy darkness, on a mossy soil that muffled the
sound of footsteps. Rénine did not make the attempt; but, at
daybreak, he came with his chauffeur and hunted through the park
all the morning. Though the park, which covered the side of a hill
and was bounded below by the river, was not very large, he found no
clue which gave him any reason to suppose that Rose Andrée was
imprisoned there.</p>

<p>He therefore went back to the village, with the firm intention
of taking action that evening and employing force:</p>

<p>"This state of things cannot go on," he said to Hortense. "I
must rescue Rose Andrée at all costs and save her from that
ruffian's clutches. He must be made to speak. He must. Otherwise
there's a danger that we may be too late."</p>

<p>That day was Sunday; and Dalbrèque did not go to work. He did
not leave his room except for lunch and went upstairs again
immediately afterwards. But at three o'clock Rénine and Hortense,
who were keeping a watch on him from the inn, saw him come down the
wooden staircase, with his bicycle on his shoulder. Leaning it
against the bottom step, he inflated the tires and fastened to the
handlebar a rather bulky object wrapped in a newspaper.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" muttered Rénine.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>In front of the café was a small terrace bordered on the right
and left by spindle-trees planted in boxes, which were connected by
a paling. Behind the shrubs, sitting on a bank but stooping forward
so that they could see Dalbrèque through the branches, were four
men.</p>

<p>"Police!" said Rénine. "What bad luck! If those fellows take a
hand, they will spoil everything."</p>

<p>"Why? On the contrary, I should have thought..."</p>

<p>"Yes, they will. They will put Dalbrèque out of the way...and
then? Will that give us Rose Andrée?"</p>

<p>Dalbrèque had finished his preparations. Just as he was mounting
his bicycle, the detectives rose in a body, ready to make a dash
for him. But Dalbrèque, though quite unconscious of their presence,
changed his mind and went back to his room as though he had
forgotten something.</p>

<p>"Now's the time!" said Rénine. "I'm going to risk it. But it's a
difficult situation and I've no great hopes."</p>

<p>He went out into the yard and, at a moment when the detectives
were not looking, ran up the staircase, as was only natural if he
wished to give an order to his chauffeur. But he had no sooner
reached the rustic balcony at the back of the house, which gave
admission to the two bedrooms than he stopped. Dalbrèque's door was
open. Rénine walked in.</p>

<p>Dalbrèque stepped back, at once assuming the defensive:</p>

<p>"What do you want? Who said you could..."</p>

<p>"Silence!" whispered Rénine, with an imperious gesture. "It's
all up with you!"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" growled the man, angrily.</p>

<p>"Lean out of your window. There are four men below on the watch
for you to leave, four detectives."</p>

<p>Dalbrèque leant over the terrace and muttered an oath:</p>

<p>"On the watch for me?" he said, turning round. "What do I
care?"</p>

<p>"They have a warrant."</p>

<p>He folded his arms:</p>

<p>"Shut up with your piffle! A warrant! What's that to me?"</p>

<p>"Listen," said Rénine, "and let us waste no time. It's urgent.
Your name's Dalbrèque, or, at least, that's the name under which
you acted in <i>The Happy Princess</i> and under which the police
are looking for you as being the murderer of Bourguet the jeweller,
the man who stole a motorcar and forty thousand francs from the
World's Cinema Company and the man who abducted a woman at Le
Havre. All this is known and proved...and here's the upshot. Four
men downstairs. Myself here, my chauffeur in the next room. You're
done for. Do you want me to save you?"</p>

<p>Dalbrèque gave his adversary a long look:</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"A friend of Rose Andrée's," said Rénine.</p>

<p>The other started and, to some extent dropping his mask,
retorted:</p>

<p>"What are your conditions?"</p>

<p>"Rose Andrée, whom you have abducted and tormented, is dying in
some hole or corner. Where is she?"</p>

<p>A strange thing occurred and impressed Rénine. Dalbrèque's face,
usually so common, was lit up by a smile that made it almost
attractive. But this was only a flashing vision: the man
immediately resumed his hard and impassive expression.</p>

<p>"And suppose I refuse to speak?" he said.</p>

<p>"So much the worse for you. It means your arrest."</p>

<p>"I dare say; but it means the death of Rose Andrée. Who will
release her?"</p>

<p>"You. You will speak now, or in an hour, or two hours hence at
least. You will never have the heart to keep silent and let her
die."</p>

<p>Dalbrèque shrugged his shoulders. Then, raising his hand, he
said:</p>

<p>"I swear on my life that, if they arrest me, not a word will
leave my lips."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Then save me. We will meet this evening at the entrance to the
Parc des Landes and say what we have to say."</p>

<p>"Why not at once?"</p>

<p>"I have spoken."</p>

<p>"Will you be there?"</p>

<p>"I shall be there."</p>

<p>Rénine reflected. There was something in all this that he failed
to grasp. In any case, the frightful danger that threatened Rose
Andrée dominated the whole situation; and Rénine was not the man to
despise this threat and to persist out of vanity in a perilous
course. Rose Andrée's life came before everything.</p>

<p>He struck several blows on the wall of the next bedroom and
called his chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Adolphe, is the car ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Set her going and pull her up in front of the terrace outside
the café, right against the boxes so as to block the exit. As for
you," he continued, addressing Dalbrèque, "you're to jump on your
machine and, instead of making off along the road, cross the yard.
At the end of the yard is a passage leading into a lane. There you
will be free. But no hesitation and no blundering...else you'll get
yourself nabbed. Good luck to you."</p>

<p>He waited till the car was drawn up in accordance with his
instructions and, when he reached it, he began to question his
chauffeur, in order to attract the detectives' attention.</p>

<p>One of them, however, having cast a glance through the
spindle-trees, caught sight of Dalbrèque just as he reached the
bottom of the staircase. He gave the alarm and darted forward,
followed by his comrades, but had to run round the car and bumped
into the chauffeur, which gave Dalbrèque time to mount his bicycle
and cross the yard unimpeded. He thus had some seconds' start.
Unfortunately for him as he was about to enter the passage at the
back, a troop of boys and girls appeared, returning from vespers.
On hearing the shouts of the detectives, they spread their arms in
front of the fugitive, who gave two or three lurches and ended by
falling.</p>

<p>Cries of triumph were raised:</p>

<p>"Lay hold of him! Stop him!" roared the detectives as they
rushed forward.</p>

<p>Rénine, seeing that the game was up, ran after the others and
called out:</p>

<p>"Stop him!"</p>

<p>He came up with them just as Dalbrèque, after regaining his
feet, knocked one of the policemen down and levelled his revolver.
Rénine snatched it out of his hands. But the two other detectives,
startled, had also produced their weapons. They fired. Dalbrèque,
hit in the leg and the chest, pitched forward and fell.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said the inspector to Rénine introducing
himself. "We owe a lot to you."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that you've done for the fellow," said Rénine.
"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"One Dalbrèque, a scoundrel for whom we were looking."</p>

<p>Rénine was beside himself. Hortense had joined him by this time;
and he growled:</p>

<p>"The silly fools! Now they've killed him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't possible!"</p>

<p>"We shall see. But, whether he's dead or alive, it's death to
Rose Andrée. How are we to trace her? And what chance have we of
finding the place&mdash;some inaccessible retreat&mdash;where the
poor thing is dying of misery and starvation?"</p>

<p>The detectives and peasants had moved away, bearing Dalbrèque
with them on an improvised stretcher. Rénine, who had at first
followed them, in order to find out what was going to happen,
changed his mind and was now standing with his eyes fixed on the
ground. The fall of the bicycle had unfastened the parcel which
Dalbrèque had tied to the handlebar; and the newspaper had burst,
revealing its contents, a tin saucepan, rusty, dented, battered and
useless.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" he muttered. "What was the
idea?..."</p>

<p>He picked it up examined it. Then he gave a grin and a click of
the tongue and chuckled, slowly:</p>

<p>"Don't move an eyelash, my dear. Let all these people clear off.
All this is no business of ours, is it? The troubles of police
don't concern us. We are two motorists travelling for our pleasure
and collecting old saucepans if we feel so inclined."</p>

<p>He called his chauffeur:</p>

<p>"Adolphe, take us to the Parc des Landes by a roundabout
road."</p>

<p>Half an hour later they reached the sunken track and began to
scramble down it on foot beside the wooded slopes. The Seine, which
was very low at this time of day, was lapping against a little
jetty near which lay a worm-eaten, mouldering boat, full of puddles
of water.</p>

<p>Rénine stepped into the boat and at once began to bale out the
puddles with his saucepan. He then drew the boat alongside of the
jetty, helped Hortense in and used the one oar which he shipped in
a gap in the stern to work her into midstream:</p>

<p>"I believe I'm there!" he said, with a laugh. "The worst that
can happen to us is to get our feet wet, for our craft leaks a
trifle. But haven't we a saucepan? Oh, blessings on that useful
utensil! Almost as soon as I set eyes upon it, I remembered that
people use those articles to bale out the bottoms of leaky boats.
Why, there was bound to be a boat in the Landes woods! How was it I
never thought of that? But of course Dalbrèque made use of her to
cross the Seine! And, as she made water, he brought a
saucepan."</p>

<p>"Then Rose Andrée...?" asked Hortense.</p>

<p>"Is a prisoner on the other bank, on the Jumièges peninsula. You
see the famous abbey from here."</p>

<p>They ran aground on a beach of big pebbles covered with
slime.</p>

<p>"And it can't be very far away," he added. "Dalbrèque did not
spend the whole night running about."</p>

<p>A towpath followed the deserted bank. Another path led away from
it. They chose the second and, passing between orchards enclosed by
hedges, came to a landscape that seemed strangely familiar to them.
Where had they seen that pool before, with the willows overhanging
it? And where had they seen that abandoned hovel?</p>

<p>Suddenly both of them stopped with one accord:</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Hortense. "I can hardly believe my eyes!"</p>

<p>Opposite them was the white gate of a large orchard, at the back
of which, among groups of old, gnarled apple-trees, appeared a
cottage with blue shutters, the cottage of the Happy Princess.</p>

<p>"Of course!" cried Rénine. "And I ought to have known it,
considering that the film showed both this cottage and the forest
close by. And isn't everything happening exactly as in <i>The Happy
Princess</i>? Isn't Dalbrèque dominated by the memory of it? The
house, which is certainly the one in which Rose Andrée spent the
summer, was empty. He has shut her up there."</p>

<p>"But the house, you told me, was in the Seine-inférieure."</p>

<p>"Well, so are we! To the left of the river, the Eure and the
forest of Brotonne; to the right, the Seine-inférieure. But between
them is the obstacle of the river, which is why I didn't connect
the two. A hundred and fifty yards of water form a more effective
division than dozens of miles."</p>

<p>The gate was locked. They got through the hedge a little lower
down and walked towards the house, which was screened on one side
by an old wall shaggy with ivy and roofed with thatch.</p>

<p>"It seems as if there was somebody there," said Hortense.
"Didn't I hear the sound of a window?"</p>

<p>"Listen."</p>

<p>Someone struck a few chords on a piano. Then a voice arose, a
woman's voice softly and solemnly singing a ballad that thrilled
with restrained passion. The woman's whole soul seemed to breathe
itself into the melodious notes.</p>

<p>They walked on. The wall concealed them from view, but they saw
a sitting-room furnished with bright wallpaper and a blue Roman
carpet. The throbbing voice ceased. The piano ended with a last
chord; and the singer rose and appeared framed in the window.</p>

<p>"Rose Andrée!" whispered Hortense.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Rénine, admitting his astonishment. "This is the
last thing that I expected! Rose Andrée! Rose Andrée at liberty!
And singing Massenet in the sitting room of her cottage!"</p>

<p>"What does it all mean? Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it has taken me long enough! But how could we have
guessed...?"</p>

<p>Although they had never seen her except on the screen, they had
not the least doubt that this was she. It was really Rose Andrée,
or rather, the Happy Princess, whom they had admired a few days
before, amidst the furniture of that very sitting-room or on the
threshold of that very cottage. She was wearing the same dress; her
hair was done in the same way; she had on the same bangles and
necklaces as in <i>The Happy Princess</i>; and her lovely face,
with its rosy cheeks and laughing eyes, bore the same look of joy
and serenity.</p>

<p>Some sound must have caught her ear, for she leant over towards
a clump of shrubs beside the cottage and whispered into the silent
garden:</p>

<p>"Georges...Georges...Is that you, my darling?"</p>

<p>Receiving no reply, she drew herself up and stood smiling at the
happy thoughts that seemed to flood her being.</p>

<p>But a door opened at the back of the room and an old peasant
woman entered with a tray laden with bread, butter and milk:</p>

<p>"Here, Rose, my pretty one, I've brought you your supper. Milk
fresh from the cow..."</p>

<p>And, putting down the tray, she continued:</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid, Rose, of the chill of the night air? Perhaps
you're expecting your sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"I haven't a sweetheart, my dear old Catherine."</p>

<p>"What next!" said the old woman, laughing. "Only this morning
there were footprints under the window that didn't look at all
proper!"</p>

<p>"A burglar's footprints perhaps, Catherine."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't say they weren't, Rose dear, especially as in
your calling you have a lot of people round you whom it's well to
be careful of. For instance, your friend Dalbrèque, eh? Nice goings
on his are! You saw the paper yesterday. A fellow who has robbed
and murdered people and carried off a woman at Le Havre...!"</p>

<p>Hortense and Rénine would have much liked to know what Rose
Andrée thought of the revelations, but she had turned her back to
them and was sitting at her supper; and the window was now closed,
so that they could neither hear her reply nor see the expression of
her features.</p>

<p>They waited for a moment. Hortense was listening with an anxious
face. But Rénine began to laugh:</p>

<p>"Very funny, really funny! And such an unexpected ending! And we
who were hunting for her in some cave or damp cellar, a horrible
tomb where the poor thing was dying of hunger! It's a fact, she
knew the terrors of that first night of captivity; and I maintain
that, on that first night, she was flung, half-dead, into the cave.
Only, there you are: the next morning she was alive! One night was
enough to tame the little rogue and to make Dalbrèque as handsome
as Prince Charming in her eyes! For see the difference. On the
films or in novels, the Happy Princesses resist or commit suicide.
But in real life...oh, woman, woman!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hortense, "but the man she loves is almost certainly
dead."</p>

<p>"And a good thing too! It would be the best solution. What would
be the outcome of this criminal love for a thief and murderer?"</p>

<p>A few minutes passed. Then, amid the peaceful silence of the
waning day, mingled with the first shadows of the twilight, they
again heard the grating of the window, which was cautiously opened.
Rose Andrée leant over the garden and waited, with her eyes turned
to the wall, as though she saw something there.</p>

<p>Presently, Rénine shook the ivy-branches.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said. "This time I know you're there! Yes, the ivy's
moving. Georges, Georges darling, why do you keep me waiting?
Catherine has gone. I am all alone..."</p>

<p>She had knelt down and was distractedly stretching out her
shapely arms covered with bangles which clashed with a metallic
sound:</p>

<p>"Georges!...Georges!..."</p>

<p>Her every movement, the thrill of her voice, her whole being
expressed desire and love. Hortense, deeply touched, could not help
saying:</p>

<p>"How the poor thing loves him! If she but knew..."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the girl. "You've spoken. You're there, and you want
me to come to you, don't you? Here I am, Georges!..."</p>

<p>She climbed over the window-ledge and began to run, while Rénine
went round the wall and advanced to meet her.</p>

<p>She stopped short in front of him and stood choking at the sight
of this man and woman whom she did not know and who were stepping
out of the very shadow from which her beloved appeared to her each
night.</p>

<p>Rénine bowed, gave his name and introduced his companion:</p>

<p>"Madame Hortense Daniel, a pupil and friend of your
mother's."</p>

<p>Still motionless with stupefaction, her features drawn, she
stammered:</p>

<p>"You know who I am?...And you were there just now?...You heard
what I was saying...?"</p>

<p>Rénine, without hesitating or pausing in his speech, said:</p>

<p>"You are Rose Andrée, the Happy Princess. We saw you on the
films the other evening; and circumstances led us to set out in
search of you...to Le Havre, where you were abducted on the day
when you were to have left for America, and to the forest of
Brotonne, where you were imprisoned."</p>

<p>She protested eagerly, with a forced laugh:</p>

<p>"What is all this? I have not been to Le Havre. I came straight
here. Abducted? Imprisoned? What nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Yes, imprisoned, in the same cave as the Happy Princess; and
you broke off some branches to the right of the cave."</p>

<p>"But how absurd! Who would have abducted me? I have no
enemy."</p>

<p>"There is a man in love with you: the one whom you were
expecting just now."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lover," she said, proudly. "Have I not the right to
receive whom I like?"</p>

<p>"You have the right; you are a free agent. But the man who comes
to see you every evening is wanted by the police. His name is
Georges Dalbrèque. He killed Bourguet the jeweller."</p>

<p>The accusation made her start with indignation and she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It's a lie! An infamous fabrication of the newspapers! Georges
was in Paris on the night of the murder. He can prove it."</p>

<p>"He stole a motor car and forty thousand francs in notes."</p>

<p>She retorted vehemently:</p>

<p>"The motorcar was taken back by his friends and the notes will
be restored. He never touched them. My leaving for America had made
him lose his head."</p>

<p>"Very well. I am quite willing to believe everything that you
say. But the police may show less faith in these statements and
less indulgence."</p>

<p>She became suddenly uneasy and faltered:</p>

<p>"The police...There's nothing to fear from them...They won't
know..."</p>

<p>"Where to find him? I succeeded, at all events. He's working as
a woodcutter, in the forest of Brotonne."</p>

<p>"Yes, but...you...that was an accident...whereas the
police..."</p>

<p>The words left her lips with the greatest difficulty. Her voice
was trembling. And suddenly she rushed at Rénine, stammering:</p>

<p>"He is arrested?...I am sure of it!...And you have come to tell
me...Arrested! Wounded! Dead perhaps?...Oh, please, please!..."</p>

<p>She had no strength left. All her pride, all the certainty of
her great love gave way to an immense despair and she sobbed
out.</p>

<p>"No, he's not dead, is he? No, I feel that he's not dead. Oh,
sir, how unjust it all is! He's the gentlest man, the best that
ever lived. He has changed my whole life. Everything is different
since I began to love him. And I love him so! I love him! I want to
go to him. Take me to him. I want them to arrest me too. I love
him...I could not live without him..."</p>

<p>An impulse of sympathy made Hortense put her arms around the
girl's neck and say warmly:</p>

<p>"Yes, come. He is not dead, I am sure, only wounded; and Prince
Rénine will save him. You will, won't you, Rénine?...Come. Make up
a story for your servant: say that you're going somewhere by train
and that she is not to tell anybody. Be quick. Put on a wrap. We
will save him, I swear we will."</p>

<p>Rose Andrée went indoors and returned almost at once, disguised
beyond recognition in a long cloak and a veil that shrouded her
face; and they all took the road back to Routot. At the inn, Rose
Andrée passed as a friend whom they had been to fetch in the
neighbourhood and were taking to Paris with them. Rénine ran out to
make enquiries and came back to the two women.</p>

<p>"It's all right. Dalbrèque is alive. They have put him to bed in
a private room at the mayor's offices. He has a broken leg and a
rather high temperature; but all the same they expect to move him
to Rouen tomorrow and they have telephoned there for a
motorcar."</p>

<p>"And then?" asked Rose Andrée, anxiously.</p>

<p>Rénine smiled:</p>

<p>"Why, then we shall leave at daybreak. We shall take up our
positions in a sunken road, rifle in hand, attack the motor-coach
and carry off Georges!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't laugh!" she said, plaintively. "I am so unhappy!"</p>

<p>But the adventure seemed to amuse Rénine; and, when he was alone
with Hortense, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You see what comes of preferring dishonour to death! But hang
it all, who could have expected this? It isn't a bit the way in
which things happen in the pictures! Once the man of the woods had
carried off his victim and considering that for three weeks there
was no one to defend her, how could we imagine&mdash;we who had
been proceeding all along under the influence of the
pictures&mdash;that in the space of a few hours the victim would
become a princess in love? Confound that Georges! I now understand
the sly, humorous look which I surprised on his mobile features! He
remembered, Georges did, and he didn't care a hang for me! Oh, he
tricked me nicely! And you, my dear, he tricked you too! And it was
all the influence of the film. They show us, at the cinema, a brute
beast, a sort of long-haired, ape-faced savage. What can a man like
that be in real life? A brute, inevitably, don't you agree? Well,
he's nothing of the kind; he's a Don Juan! The humbug!"</p>

<p>"You will save him, won't you?" said Hortense, in a beseeching
tone.</p>

<p>"Are you very anxious that I should?"</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"In that case, promise to give me your hand to kiss."</p>

<p>"You can have both hands, Rénine, and gladly."</p>

<p>The night was uneventful. Rénine had given orders for the two
ladies to be waked at an early hour. When they came down, the motor
was leaving the yard and pulling up in front of the inn. It was
raining; and Adolphe, the chauffeur, had fixed up the long, low
hood and packed the luggage inside.</p>

<p>Rénine called for his bill. They all three took a cup of coffee.
But, just as they were leaving the room, one of the inspector's men
came rushing in:</p>

<p>"Have you seen him?" he asked. "Isn't he here?"</p>

<p>The inspector himself arrived at a run, greatly excited:</p>

<p>"The prisoner has escaped! He ran back through the inn! He can't
be far away!"</p>

<p>A dozen rustics appeared like a whirlwind. They ransacked the
lofts, the stables, the sheds. They scattered over the
neighbourhood. But the search led to no discovery.</p>

<p>"Oh, hang it all!" said Rénine, who had taken his part in the
hunt. "How can it have happened?"</p>

<p>"How do I know?" spluttered the inspector in despair. "I left my
three men watching in the next room. I found them this morning fast
asleep, stupefied by some narcotic which had been mixed with their
wine! And the Dalbrèque bird had flown!"</p>

<p>"Which way?"</p>

<p>"Through the window. There were evidently accomplices, with
ropes and a ladder. And, as Dalbrèque had a broken leg, they
carried him off on the stretcher itself."</p>

<p>"They left no traces?"</p>

<p>"No traces of footsteps, true. The rain has messed everything
up. But they went through the yard, because the stretcher's
there."</p>

<p>"You'll find him, Mr. Inspector, there's no doubt of that. In
any case, you may be sure that you won't have any trouble over the
affair. I shall be in Paris this evening and shall go straight to
the prefecture, where I have influential friends."</p>

<p>Rénine went back to the two women in the coffee-room and
Hortense at once said:</p>

<p>"It was you who carried him off, wasn't it? Please put Rose
Andrée's mind at rest. She is so terrified!"</p>

<p>He gave Rose Andrée his arm and led her to the car. She was
staggering and very pale; and she said, in a faint voice:</p>

<p>"Are we going? And he: is he safe? Won't they catch him
again?"</p>

<p>Looking deep into her eyes, he said:</p>

<p>"Swear to me, Rose Andrée, that in two months, when he is well
and when I have proved his innocence, swear that you will go away
with him to America."</p>

<p>"I swear."</p>

<p>"And that, once there, you will marry him."</p>

<p>"I swear."</p>

<p>He spoke a few words in her ear.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said. "May Heaven bless you for it!"</p>

<p>Hortense took her seat in front, with Rénine, who sat at the
wheel. The inspector, hat in hand, fussed around the car until it
moved off.</p>

<p>They drove through the forest, crossed the Seine at La
Mailleraie and struck into the Havre-Rouen road.</p>

<p>"Take off your glove and give me your hand to kiss," Rénine
ordered. "You promised that you would."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Hortense. "But it was to be when Dalbrèque was
saved."</p>

<p>"He is saved."</p>

<p>"Not yet. The police are after him. They may catch him again. He
will not be really saved until he is with Rose Andrée."</p>

<p>"He is with Rose Andrée," he declared.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Turn round."</p>

<p>She did so.</p>

<p>In the shadow of the hood, right at the back, behind the
chauffeur, Rose Andrée was kneeling beside a man lying on the
seat.</p>

<p>"Oh," stammered Hortense, "it's incredible! Then it was you who
hid him last night? And he was there, in front of the inn, when the
inspector was seeing us off?"</p>

<p>"Lord, yes! He was there, under the cushions and rugs!"</p>

<p>"It's incredible!" she repeated, utterly bewildered. "It's
incredible! How were you able to manage it all?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to kiss your hand," he said.</p>

<p>She removed her glove, as he bade her, and raised her hand to
his lips.</p>

<p>The car was speeding between the peaceful Seine and the white
cliffs that border it. They sat silent for a long while. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"I had a talk with Dalbrèque last night. He's a fine fellow and
is ready to do anything for Rose Andrée. He's right. A man must do
anything for the woman he loves. He must devote himself to her,
offer her all that is beautiful in this world: joy and
happiness...and, if she should be bored, stirring adventures to
distract her, to excite her and to make her smile...or even
weep."</p>

<p>Hortense shivered; and her eyes were not quite free from tears.
For the first time he was alluding to the sentimental adventure
that bound them by a tie which as yet was frail, but which became
stronger and more enduring with each of the ventures on which they
entered together, pursuing them feverishly and anxiously to their
close. Already she felt powerless and uneasy with this
extraordinary man, who subjected events to his will and seemed to
play with the destinies of those whom he fought or protected. He
filled her with dread and at the same time he attracted her. She
thought of him sometimes as her master, sometimes as an enemy
against whom she must defend herself, but oftenest as a perturbing
friend, full of charm and fascination...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. Thérèse and Germaine</h2>

<p>The weather was so mild that autumn that, on the 12th of
October, in the morning, several families still lingering in their
villas at &Eacute;tretat had gone down to the beach. The sea, lying
between the cliffs and the clouds on the horizon, might have
suggested a mountain-lake slumbering in the hollow of the enclosing
rocks, were it not for that crispness in the air and those pale,
soft and indefinite colours in the sky which give a special charm
to certain days in Normandy.</p>

<p>"It's delicious," murmured Hortense. But the next moment she
added: "All the same, we did not come here to enjoy the spectacle
of nature or to wonder whether that huge stone Needle on our left
was really at one time the home of Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>"We came here," said Prince Rénine, "because of the conversation
which I overheard, a fortnight ago, in a dining-car, between a man
and a woman."</p>

<p>"A conversation of which I was unable to catch a single
word."</p>

<p>"If those two people could have guessed for an instant that it
was possible to hear a single word of what they were saying, they
would not have spoken, for their conversation was one of
extraordinary gravity and importance. But I have very sharp ears;
and though I could not follow every sentence, I insist that we may
be certain of two things. First, that man and woman, who are
brother and sister, have an appointment at a quarter to twelve this
morning, the 12th of October, at the spot known as the Trois
Mathildes, with a third person, who is married and who wishes at
all costs to recover his or her liberty. Secondly, this
appointment, at which they will come to a final agreement, is to be
followed this evening by a walk along the cliffs, when the third
person will bring with him or her the man or woman, I can't
definitely say which, whom they want to get rid of. That is the
gist of the whole thing. Now, as I know a spot called the Trois
Mathildes some way above &Eacute;tretat and as this is not an
everyday name, we came down yesterday to thwart the plan of these
objectionable persons."</p>

<p>"What plan?" asked Hortense. "For, after all, it's only your
assumption that there's to be a victim and that the victim is to be
flung off the top of the cliffs. You yourself told me that you
heard no allusion to a possible murder."</p>

<p>"That is so. But I heard some very plain words relating to the
marriage of the brother or the sister with the wife or the husband
of the third person, which implies the need for a crime."</p>

<p>They were sitting on the terrace of the casino, facing the
stairs which run down to the beach. They therefore overlooked the
few privately-owned cabins on the shingle, where a party of four
men were playing bridge, while a group of ladies sat talking and
knitting.</p>

<p>A short distance away and nearer to the sea was another cabin,
standing by itself and closed.</p>

<p>Half-a-dozen barelegged children were paddling in the water.</p>

<p>"No," said Hortense, "all this autumnal sweetness and charm
fails to attract me. I have so much faith in all your theories that
I can't help thinking, in spite of everything, of this dreadful
problem. Which of those people yonder is threatened? Death has
already selected its victim. Who is it? Is it that young,
fair-haired woman, rocking herself and laughing? Is it that tall
man over there, smoking his cigar? And which of them has the
thought of murder hidden in his heart? All the people we see are
quietly enjoying themselves. Yet death is prowling among them."</p>

<p>"Capital!" said Rénine. "You too are becoming enthusiastic. What
did I tell you? The whole of life's an adventure; and nothing but
adventure is worth while. At the first breath of coming events,
there you are, quivering in every nerve. You share in all the
tragedies stirring around you; and the feeling of mystery awakens
in the depths of your being. See, how closely you are observing
that couple who have just arrived. You never can tell: that may be
the gentleman who proposes to do away with his wife? Or perhaps the
lady contemplates making away with her husband?"</p>

<p>"The d'Ormevals? Never! A perfectly happy couple! Yesterday, at
the hotel, I had a long talk with the wife. And you
yourself..."</p>

<p>"Oh, I played a round of golf with Jacques d'Ormeval, who rather
fancies himself as an athlete, and I played at dolls with their two
charming little girls!"</p>

<p>The d'Ormevals came up and exchanged a few words with them.
Madame d'Ormeval said that her two daughters had gone back to Paris
that morning with their governess. Her husband, a great tall fellow
with a yellow beard, carrying his blazer over his arm and puffing
out his chest under a cellular shirt, complained of the heat:</p>

<p>"Have you the key of the cabin, Thérèse?" he asked his wife,
when they had left Rénine and Hortense and stopped at the top of
the stairs, a few yards away.</p>

<p>"Here it is," said the wife. "Are you going to read your
papers?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Unless we go for a stroll?..."</p>

<p>"I had rather wait till the afternoon: do you mind? I have a lot
of letters to write this morning."</p>

<p>"Very well. We'll go on the cliff."</p>

<p>Hortense and Rénine exchanged a glance of surprise. Was this
suggestion accidental? Or had they before them, contrary to their
expectations, the very couple of whom they were in search?</p>

<p>Hortense tried to laugh:</p>

<p>"My heart is thumping," she said. "Nevertheless, I absolutely
refuse to believe in anything so improbable. 'My husband and I have
never had the slightest quarrel,' she said to me. No, it's quite
clear that those two get on admirably."</p>

<p>"We shall see presently, at the Trois Mathildes, if one of them
comes to meet the brother and sister."</p>

<p>M. d'Ormeval had gone down the stairs, while his wife stood
leaning on the balustrade of the terrace. She had a beautiful,
slender, supple figure. Her clear-cut profile was emphasized by a
rather too prominent chin when at rest; and, when it was not
smiling, the face gave an expression of sadness and suffering.</p>

<p>"Have you lost something, Jacques?" she called out to her
husband, who was stooping over the shingle.</p>

<p>"Yes, the key," he said. "It slipped out of my hand."</p>

<p>She went down to him and began to look also. For two or three
minutes, as they sheered off to the right and remained close to the
bottom of the under-cliff, they were invisible to Hortense and
Rénine. Their voices were covered by the noise of a dispute which
had arisen among the bridge-players.</p>

<p>They reappeared almost simultaneously. Madame d'Ormeval slowly
climbed a few steps of the stairs and then stopped and turned her
face towards the sea. Her husband had thrown his blazer over his
shoulders and was making for the isolated cabin. As he passed the
bridge-players, they asked him for a decision, pointing to their
cards spread out upon the table. But, with a wave of the hand, he
refused to give an opinion and walked on, covered the thirty yards
which divided them from the cabin, opened the door and went in.</p>

<p>Thérèse d'Ormeval came back to the terrace and remained for ten
minutes sitting on a bench. Then she came out through the casino.
Hortense, on leaning forward, saw her entering one of the chalets
annexed to the Hôtel Hauville and, a moment later, caught sight of
her again on the balcony.</p>

<p>"Eleven o'clock," said Rénine. "Whoever it is, he or she, or one
of the card-players, or one of their wives, it won't be long before
someone goes to the appointed place."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, twenty minutes passed and twenty-five; and no one
stirred.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Madame d'Ormeval has gone." Hortense suggested,
anxiously. "She is no longer on her balcony."</p>

<p>"If she is at the Trois Mathildes," said Rénine, "we will go and
catch her there."</p>

<p>He was rising to his feet, when a fresh discussion broke out
among the bridge-players and one of them exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Let's put it to d'Ormeval."</p>

<p>"Very well," said his adversary. "I'll accept his decision...if
he consents to act as umpire. He was rather huffy just now."</p>

<p>They called out:</p>

<p>"D'Ormeval! D'Ormeval!"</p>

<p>They then saw that d'Ormeval must have shut the door behind him,
which kept him in the half dark, the cabin being one of the sort
that has no window.</p>

<p>"He's asleep," cried one. "Let's wake him up."</p>

<p>All four went to the cabin, began by calling to him and, on
receiving no answer, thumped on the door:</p>

<p>"Hi! D'Ormeval! Are you asleep?"</p>

<p>On the terrace Serge Rénine suddenly leapt to his feet with so
uneasy an air that Hortense was astonished. He muttered:</p>

<p>"If only it's not too late!"</p>

<p>And, when Hortense asked him what he meant, he tore down the
steps and started running to the cabin. He reached it just as the
bridge-players were trying to break in the door:</p>

<p>"Stop!" he ordered. "Things must be done in the regular
fashion."</p>

<p>"What things?" they asked.</p>

<p>He examined the Venetian shutters at the top of each of the
folding-doors and, on finding that one of the upper slats was
partly broken, hung on as best he could to the roof of the cabin
and cast a glance inside. Then he said to the four men:</p>

<p>"I was right in thinking that, if M. d'Ormeval did not reply, he
must have been prevented by some serious cause. There is every
reason to believe that M. d'Ormeval is wounded...or dead."</p>

<p>"Dead!" they cried. "What do you mean? He has only just left
us."</p>

<p>Rénine took out his knife, prized open the lock and pulled back
the two doors.</p>

<p>There were shouts of dismay. M. d'Ormeval was lying flat on his
face, clutching his jacket and his newspaper in his hands. Blood
was flowing from his back and staining his shirt.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said someone. "He has killed himself!"</p>

<p>"How can he have killed himself?" said Rénine. "The wound is
right in the middle of the back, at a place which the hand can't
reach. And, besides, there's not a knife in the cabin."</p>

<p>The others protested:</p>

<p>"If so, he has been murdered. But that's impossible! There has
been nobody here. We should have seen, if there had been. Nobody
could have passed us without our seeing..."</p>

<p>The other men, all the ladies and the children paddling in the
sea had come running up. Rénine allowed no one to enter the cabin,
except a doctor who was present. But the doctor could only say that
M. d'Ormeval was dead, stabbed with a dagger.</p>

<p>At that moment, the mayor and the policeman arrived, together
with some people of the village. After the usual enquiries, they
carried away the body.</p>

<p>A few persons went on ahead to break the news to Thérèse
d'Ormeval, who was once more to be seen on her balcony.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>And so the tragedy had taken place without any clue to explain
how a man, protected by a closed door with an uninjured lock, could
have been murdered in the space of a few minutes and in front of
twenty witnesses, one might almost say, twenty spectators. No one
had entered the cabin. No one had come out of it. As for the dagger
with which M. d'Ormeval had been stabbed between the shoulders, it
could not be traced. And all this would have suggested the idea of
a trick of sleight-of-hand performed by a clever conjuror, had it
not concerned a terrible murder, committed under the most
mysterious conditions.</p>

<p>Hortense was unable to follow, as Rénine would have liked, the
small party who were making for Madame d'Ormeval; she was paralysed
with excitement and incapable of moving. It was the first time that
her adventures with Rénine had taken her into the very heart of the
action and that, instead of noting the consequences of a murder, or
assisting in the pursuit of the criminals, she found herself
confronted with the murder itself.</p>

<p>It left her trembling all over; and she stammered:</p>

<p>"How horrible!...The poor fellow!...Ah, Rénine, you couldn't
save him this time!...And that's what upsets me more than anything,
that we could and should have saved him, since we knew of the
plot..."</p>

<p>Rénine made her sniff at a bottle of salts; and when she had
quite recovered her composure, he said, while observing her
attentively:</p>

<p>"So you think that there is some connection between the murder
and the plot which we were trying to frustrate?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said she, astonished at the question.</p>

<p>"Then, as that plot was hatched by a husband against his wife or
by a wife against her husband, you admit that Madame
d'Ormeval...?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, impossible!" she said. "To begin with, Madame d'Ormeval
did not leave her rooms...and then I shall never believe that
pretty woman capable...No, no, of course there was something
else..."</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"I don't know...You may have misunderstood what the brother and
sister were saying to each other...You see, the murder has been
committed under quite different conditions...at another hour and
another place..."</p>

<p>"And therefore," concluded Rénine, "the two cases are not in any
way related?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "there's no making it out! It's all so
strange!"</p>

<p>Rénine became a little satirical:</p>

<p>"My pupil is doing me no credit today," he said. "Why, here is a
perfectly simple story, unfolded before your eyes. You have seen it
reeled off like a scene in the cinema; and it all remains as
obscure to you as though you were hearing of an affair that
happened in a cave a hundred miles away!"</p>

<p>Hortense was confounded:</p>

<p>"What are you saying? Do you mean that you have understood it?
What clues have you to go by?"</p>

<p>Rénine looked at his watch:</p>

<p>"I have not understood everything," he said. "The murder itself,
the mere brutal murder, yes. But the essential thing, that is to
say, the psychology of the crime: I've no clue to that. Only, it is
twelve o'clock. The brother and sister, seeing no one come to the
appointment at the Trois Mathildes, will go down to the beach.
Don't you think that we shall learn something then of the
accomplice whom I accuse them of having and of the connection
between the two cases?"</p>

<p>They reached the esplanade in front of the Hauville chalets,
with the capstans by which the fishermen haul up their boats to the
beach. A number of inquisitive persons were standing outside the
door of one of the chalets. Two coastguards, posted at the door,
prevented them from entering.</p>

<p>The mayor shouldered his way eagerly through the crowd. He was
back from the post-office, where he had been telephoning to Le
Havre, to the office of the procurator-general, and had been told
that the public prosecutor and an examining-magistrate would come
on to &Eacute;tretat in the course of the afternoon.</p>

<p>"That leaves us plenty of time for lunch," said Rénine. "The
tragedy will not be enacted before two or three o'clock. And I have
an idea that it will be sensational."</p>

<p>They hurried nevertheless. Hortense, overwrought by fatigue and
her desire to know what was happening, continually questioned
Rénine, who replied evasively, with his eyes turned to the
esplanade, which they could see through the windows of the
coffee-room.</p>

<p>"Are you watching for those two?" asked Hortense.</p>

<p>"Yes, the brother and sister."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that they will venture?..."</p>

<p>"Look out! Here they come!"</p>

<p>He went out quickly.</p>

<p>Where the main street opened on the seafront, a lady and
gentleman were advancing with hesitating steps, as though
unfamiliar with the place. The brother was a puny little man, with
a sallow complexion. He was wearing a motoring-cap. The sister too
was short, but rather stout, and was wrapped in a large cloak. She
struck them as a woman of a certain age, but still good-looking
under the thin veil that covered her face.</p>

<p>They saw the groups of bystanders and drew nearer. Their gait
betrayed uneasiness and hesitation.</p>

<p>The sister asked a question of a seaman. At the first words of
his answer, which no doubt conveyed the news of d'Ormeval's death,
she uttered a cry and tried to force her way through the crowd. The
brother, learning in his turn what had happened, made great play
with his elbows and shouted to the coastguards:</p>

<p>"I'm a friend of d'Ormeval's!...Here's my card! Frédéric
Astaing...My sister, Germaine Astaing, knows Madame d'Ormeval
intimately!...They were expecting us...We had an
appointment!..."</p>

<p>They were allowed to pass. Rénine, who had slipped behind them,
followed them in without a word, accompanied by Hortense.</p>

<p>The d'Ormevals had four bedrooms and a sitting-room on the
second floor. The sister rushed into one of the rooms and threw
herself on her knees beside the bed on which the corpse lay
stretched. Thérèse d'Ormeval was in the sitting-room and was
sobbing in the midst of a small company of silent persons. The
brother sat down beside her, eagerly seized her hands and said, in
a trembling voice:</p>

<p>"My poor friend!...My poor friend!..."</p>

<p>Rénine and Hortense gazed at the pair of them: and Hortense
whispered:</p>

<p>"And she's supposed to have killed him for that?
Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," observed Rénine, "they are acquaintances; and we
know that Astaing and his sister were also acquainted with a third
person who was their accomplice. So that..."</p>

<p>"It's impossible!" Hortense repeated.</p>

<p>And, in spite of all presumption, she felt so much attracted by
Thérèse that, when Frédéric Astaing stood up, she proceeded
straightway to sit down beside her and consoled her in a gentle
voice. The unhappy woman's tears distressed her profoundly.</p>

<p>Rénine, on the other hand, applied himself from the outset to
watching the brother and sister, as though this were the only thing
that mattered, and did not take his eyes off Frédéric Astaing, who,
with an air of indifference, began to make a minute inspection of
the premises, examining the sitting-room, going into all the
bedrooms, mingling with the various groups of persons present and
asking questions about the manner in which the murder had been
committed. Twice his sister came up and spoke to him. Then he went
back to Madame d'Ormeval and again sat down beside her, full of
earnest sympathy. Lastly, in the lobby, he had a long conversation
with his sister, after which they parted, like people who have come
to a perfect understanding. Frédéric then left. These manoeuvers
had lasted quite thirty or forty minutes.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the motorcar containing the
examining-magistrate and the public prosecutor pulled up outside
the chalets. Rénine, who did not expect them until later, said to
Hortense:</p>

<p>"We must be quick. On no account leave Madame d'Ormeval."</p>

<p>Word was sent up to the persons whose evidence might be of any
service that they were to go to the beach, where the magistrate was
beginning a preliminary investigation. He would call on Madame
d'Ormeval afterwards. Accordingly, all who were present left the
chalet. No one remained behind except the two guards and Germaine
Astaing.</p>

<p>Germaine knelt down for the last time beside the dead man and,
bending low, with her face in her hands, prayed for a long time.
Then she rose and was opening the door on the landing, when Rénine
came forward:</p>

<p>"I should like a few words with you, madame."</p>

<p>She seemed surprised and replied:</p>

<p>"What is it, monsieur? I am listening."</p>

<p>"Not here."</p>

<p>"Where then, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Next door, in the sitting-room."</p>

<p>"No," she said, sharply.</p>

<p>"Why not? Though you did not even shake hands with her, I
presume that Madame d'Ormeval is your friend?"</p>

<p>He gave her no time to reflect, drew her into the next room,
closed the door and, at once pouncing upon Madame d'Ormeval, who
was trying to go out and return to her own room, said:</p>

<p>"No, madame, listen, I implore you. Madame Astaing's presence
need not drive you away. We have very serious matters to discuss,
without losing a minute."</p>

<p>The two women, standing face to face, were looking at each other
with the same expression of implacable hatred, in which might be
read the same confusion of spirit and the same restrained anger.
Hortense, who believed them to be friends and who might, up to a
certain point, have believed them to be accomplices, foresaw with
terror the hostile encounter which she felt to be inevitable. She
compelled Madame d'Ormeval to resume her seat, while Rénine took up
his position in the middle of the room and spoke in resolute
tones:</p>

<p>"Chance, which has placed me in possession of part of the truth,
will enable me to save you both, if you are willing to assist me
with a frank explanation that will give me the particulars which I
still need. Each of you knows the danger in which she stands,
because each of you is conscious in her heart of the evil for which
she is responsible. But you are carried away by hatred; and it is
for me to see clearly and to act. The examining-magistrate will be
here in half-an-hour. By that time, you must have come to an
agreement."</p>

<p>They both started, as though offended by such a word.</p>

<p>"Yes, an agreement," he repeated, in a more imperious tone.
"Whether you like it or not, you will come to an agreement. You are
not the only ones to be considered. There are your two little
daughters, Madame d'Ormeval. Since circumstances have set me in
their path, I am intervening in their defence and for their safety.
A blunder, a word too much; and they are ruined. That must not
happen."</p>

<p>At the mention of her children, Madame d'Ormeval broke down and
sobbed. Germaine Astaing shrugged her shoulders and made a movement
towards the door. Rénine once more blocked the way:</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I have been summoned by the examining-magistrate."</p>

<p>"No, you have not."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have. Just as all those have been who have any evidence
to give."</p>

<p>"You were not on the spot. You know nothing of what happened.
Nobody knows anything of the murder."</p>

<p>"I know who committed it."</p>

<p>"That's impossible."</p>

<p>"It was Thérèse d'Ormeval."</p>

<p>The accusation was hurled forth in an outburst of rage and with
a fiercely threatening gesture.</p>

<p>"You wretched creature!" exclaimed madame d'Ormeval, rushing at
her. "Go! Leave the room! Oh, what a wretch the woman is!"</p>

<p>Hortense was trying to restrain her, but Rénine whispered:</p>

<p>"Let them be. It's what I wanted...to pitch them one against the
other and so to let in the daylight."</p>

<p>Madame Astaing had made a convulsive effort to ward off the
insult with a jest; and she sniggered:</p>

<p>"A wretched creature? Why? Because I have accused you?"</p>

<p>"Why? For every reason! You're a wretched creature! You hear
what I say, Germaine: you're a wretch!"</p>

<p>Thérèse d'Ormeval was repeating the insult as though it afforded
her some relief. Her anger was abating. Very likely also she no
longer had the strength to keep up the struggle; and it was Madame
Astaing who returned to the attack, with her fists clenched and her
face distorted and suddenly aged by fully twenty years:</p>

<p>"You! You dare to insult me, you! You after the murder you have
committed! You dare to lift up your head when the man whom you
killed is lying in there on his deathbed! Ah, if one of us is a
wretched creature, it's you, Thérèse, and you know it! You have
killed your husband! You have killed your husband!"</p>

<p>She leapt forward, in the excitement of the terrible words which
she was uttering; and her fingernails were almost touching her
friend's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't tell me you didn't kill him!" she cried. "Don't say
that: I won't let you. Don't say it. The dagger is there, in your
bag. My brother felt it, while he was talking to you; and his hand
came out with stains of blood upon it: your husband's blood,
Thérèse. And then, even if I had not discovered anything, do you
think that I should not have guessed, in the first few minutes?
Why, I knew the truth at once, Thérèse! When a sailor down there
answered, 'M. d'Ormeval? He has been murdered,' I said to myself
then and there, 'It's she, it's Thérèse, she killed him.'"</p>

<p>Thérèse did not reply. She had abandoned her attitude of
protest. Hortense, who was watching her with anguish, thought that
she could perceive in her the despondency of those who know
themselves to be lost. Her cheeks had fallen in and she wore such
an expression of despair that Hortense, moved to compassion,
implored her to defend herself:</p>

<p>"Please, please, explain things. When the murder was committed,
you were here, on the balcony...But then the dagger...how did you
come to have it...? How do you explain it?..."</p>

<p>"Explanations!" sneered Germaine Astaing. "How could she
possibly explain? What do outward appearances matter? What does it
matter what anyone saw or did not see? The proof is the thing that
tells...The dagger is there, in your bag, Thérèse: that's a
fact...Yes, yes, it was you who did it! You killed him! You killed
him in the end!...Ah, how often I've told my brother, 'She will
kill him yet!' Frédéric used to try to defend you. He always had a
weakness for you. But in his innermost heart he foresaw what would
happen...And now the horrible thing has been done. A stab in the
back! Coward! Coward!...And you would have me say nothing? Why, I
didn't hesitate a moment! Nor did Frédéric. We looked for proofs at
once...And I've denounced you of my own free will, perfectly well
aware of what I was doing...And it's over, Thérèse. You're done
for. Nothing can save you now. The dagger is in that bag which you
are clutching in your hand. The magistrate is coming; and the
dagger will be found, stained with the blood of your husband. So
will your pocketbook. They're both there. And they will be
found..."</p>

<p>Her rage had incensed her so vehemently that she was unable to
continue and stood with her hand outstretched and her chin
twitching with nervous tremors.</p>

<p>Rénine gently took hold of Madame d'Ormeval's bag. She clung to
it, but he insisted and said:</p>

<p>"Please allow me, madame. Your friend Germaine is right. The
examining-magistrate will be here presently; and the fact that the
dagger and the pocketbook are in your possession will lead to your
immediate arrest. This must not happen. Please allow me."</p>

<p>His insinuating voice diminished Thérèse d'Ormeval's resistance.
She released her fingers, one by one. He took the bag, opened it,
produced a little dagger with an ebony handle and a grey leather
pocketbook and quietly slipped the two into the inside pocket of
his jacket.</p>

<p>Germaine Astaing gazed at him in amazement:</p>

<p>"You're mad, monsieur! What right have you...?"</p>

<p>"These things must not be left lying about. I shan't worry now.
The magistrate will never look for them in my pocket."</p>

<p>"But I shall denounce you to the police," she exclaimed,
indignantly. "They shall be told!"</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, laughing, "you won't say anything! The police
have nothing to do with this. The quarrel between you must be
settled in private. What an idea, to go dragging the police into
every incident of one's life!"</p>

<p>Madame Astaing was choking with fury:</p>

<p>"But you have no right to talk like this, monsieur! Who are you,
after all? A friend of that woman's?"</p>

<p>"Since you have been attacking her, yes."</p>

<p>"But I'm only attacking her because she's guilty. For you can't
deny it: she has killed her husband."</p>

<p>"I don't deny it," said Rénine, calmly. "We are all agreed on
that point. Jacques d'Ormeval was killed by his wife. But, I
repeat, the police must not know the truth."</p>

<p>"They shall know it through me, monsieur, I swear they shall.
That woman must be punished: she has committed murder."</p>

<p>Rénine went up to her and, touching her on the shoulder:</p>

<p>"You asked me just now by what right I was interfering. And you
yourself, madame?"</p>

<p>"I was a friend of Jacques d'Ormeval."</p>

<p>"Only a friend?"</p>

<p>She was a little taken aback, but at once pulled herself
together and replied:</p>

<p>"I was his friend and it is my duty to avenge his death."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, you will remain silent, as he did."</p>

<p>"He did not know, when he died."</p>

<p>"That's where you are wrong. He could have accused his wife, if
he had wished. He had ample time to accuse her; and he said
nothing."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because of his children."</p>

<p>Madame Astaing was not appeased; and her attitude displayed the
same longing for revenge and the same detestation. But she was
influenced by Rénine in spite of herself. In the small, closed
room, where there was such a clash of hatred, he was gradually
becoming the master; and Germaine Astaing understood that it was
against him that she had to struggle, while Madame d'Ormeval felt
all the comfort of that unexpected support which was offering
itself on the brink of the abyss:</p>

<p>"Thank you, monsieur," she said. "As you have seen all this so
clearly, you also know that it was for my children's sake that I
did not give myself up. But for that...I am so tired...!"</p>

<p>And so the scene was changing and things assuming a different
aspect. Thanks to a few words let fall in the midst of the dispute,
the culprit was lifting her head and taking heart, whereas her
accuser was hesitating and seemed to be uneasy. And it also came
about that the accuser dared not say anything further and that the
culprit was nearing the moment at which the need is felt of
breaking silence and of speaking, quite naturally, words that are
at once a confession and a relief.</p>

<p>"The time, I think, has come," said Rénine to Thérèse, with the
same unvarying gentleness, "when you can and ought to explain
yourself."</p>

<p>She was again weeping, lying huddled in a chair. She too
revealed a face aged and ravaged by sorrow; and, in a very low
voice, with no display of anger, she spoke, in short, broken
sentences:</p>

<p>"She has been his mistress for the last four years...I can't
tell you how I suffered...She herself told me of it...out of sheer
wickedness...Her loathing for me was even greater than her love for
Jacques...and every day I had some fresh injury to bear...She would
ring me up to tell me of her appointments with my husband...she
hoped to make me suffer so much I should end by killing myself...I
did think of it sometimes, but I held out, for the children's
sake...Jacques was weakening. She wanted him to get a divorce...and
little by little he began to consent...dominated by her and by her
brother, who is slyer than she is, but quite as dangerous...I felt
all this...Jacques was becoming harsh to me...He had not the
courage to leave me, but I was the obstacle and he bore me a
grudge...Heavens, the tortures I suffered!..."</p>

<p>"You should have given him his liberty," cried Germaine Astaing.
"A woman doesn't kill her husband for wanting a divorce."</p>

<p>Thérèse shook her head and answered:</p>

<p>"I did not kill him because he wanted a divorce. If he had
really wanted it, he would have left me; and what could I have
done? But your plans had changed, Germaine; divorce was not enough
for you; and it was something else that you would have obtained
from him, another, much more serious thing which you and your
brother had insisted on...and to which he had consented...out of
cowardice...in spite of himself..."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" spluttered Germaine. "What other thing?"</p>

<p>"My death."</p>

<p>"You lie!" cried Madame Astaing.</p>

<p>Thérèse did not raise her voice. She made not a movement of
aversion or indignation and simply repeated:</p>

<p>"My death, Germaine. I have read your latest letters, six
letters from you which he was foolish enough to leave about in his
pocketbook and which I read last night, six letters in which the
terrible word is not set down, but in which it appears between
every line. I trembled as I read it! That Jacques should come to
this!...Nevertheless the idea of stabbing him did not occur to me
for a second. A woman like myself, Germaine, does not readily
commit murder...If I lost my head, it was after that...and it was
your fault..."</p>

<p>She turned her eyes to Rénine as if to ask him if there was no
danger in her speaking and revealing the truth.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," he said. "I will be answerable for
everything."</p>

<p>She drew her hand across her forehead. The horrible scene was
being reenacted within her and was torturing her. Germaine Astaing
did not move, but stood with folded arms and anxious eyes, while
Hortense Daniel sat distractedly awaiting the confession of the
crime and the explanation of the unfathomable mystery.</p>

<p>"It was after that and it was through your fault Germaine...I
had put back the pocketbook in the drawer where it was hidden; and
I said nothing to Jacques this morning...I did not want to tell him
what I knew...It was too horrible...All the same, I had to act
quickly; your letters announced your secret arrival today...I
thought at first of running away, of taking the train...I had
mechanically picked up that dagger, to defend myself...But when
Jacques and I went down to the beach, I was resigned...Yes, I had
accepted death: 'I will die,' I thought, 'and put an end to all
this nightmare!'...Only, for the children's sake, I was anxious
that my death should look like an accident and that Jacques should
have no part in it. That was why your plan of a walk on the cliff
suited me...A fall from the top of a cliff seems quite
natural...Jacques therefore left me to go to his cabin, from which
he was to join you later at the Trois Mathildes. On the way, below
the terrace, he dropped the key of the cabin. I went down and began
to look for it with him...And it happened then...through your
fault...yes, Germaine, through your fault...Jacques' pocketbook had
slipped from his jacket, without his noticing it, and, together
with the pocketbook, a photograph which I recognized at once: a
photograph, taken this year, of myself and my two children. I
picked it up...and I saw...You know what I saw, Germaine. Instead
of my face, the face in the photograph was <i>yours</i>!...You had
put in your likeness, Germaine, and blotted me out! It was your
face! One of your arms was round my elder daughter's neck; and the
younger was sitting on your knees...It was you, Germaine, the wife
of my husband, the future mother of my children, you, who were
going to bring them up...you, you!...Then I lost my head. I had the
dagger...Jacques was stooping...I stabbed him..."</p>

<p>Every word of her confession was strictly true. Those who
listened to her felt this profoundly; and nothing could have given
Hortense and Rénine a keener impression of tragedy.</p>

<p>She had fallen back into her chair, utterly exhausted.
Nevertheless, she went on speaking unintelligible words; and it was
only gradually by leaning over her, that they were able to make
out:</p>

<p>"I thought that there would be an outcry and that I should be
arrested. But no. It happened in such a way and under such
conditions that no one had seen anything. Further, Jacques had
drawn himself up at the same time as myself; and he actually did
not fall. No, he did not fall! I had stabbed him; and he remained
standing! I saw him from the terrace, to which I had returned. He
had hung his jacket over his shoulders, evidently to hide his
wound, and he moved away without staggering...or staggering so
little that I alone was able to perceive it. He even spoke to some
friends who were playing cards. Then he went to his cabin and
disappeared...In a few moments, I came back indoors. I was
persuaded that all of this was only a bad dream...that I had not
killed him...or that at the worst the wound was a slight one.
Jacques would come out again. I was certain of it...I watched from
my balcony...If I had thought for a moment that he needed
assistance, I should have flown to him...But truly I didn't
know...I didn't guess...People speak of presentiments: there are no
such things. I was perfectly calm, just as one is after a nightmare
of which the memory is fading away...No, I swear to you, I knew
nothing...until the moment..."</p>

<p>She interrupted herself, stifled by sobs.</p>

<p>Rénine finished her sentence for her,</p>

<p>"Until the moment when they came and told you, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Thérèse stammered:</p>

<p>"Yes. It was not till then that I was conscious of what I had
done...and I felt that I was going mad and that I should cry out to
all those people, 'Why, it was I who did it! Don't search! Here is
the dagger...I am the culprit!' Yes, I was going to say that, when
suddenly I caught sight of my poor Jacques...They were carrying him
along...His face was very peaceful, very gentle...And, in his
presence, I understood my duty, as he had understood his...He had
kept silent, for the sake of the children. I would be silent too.
We were both guilty of the murder of which he was the victim; and
we must both do all we could to prevent the crime from recoiling
upon them...He had seen this clearly in his dying agony. He had had
the amazing courage to keep his feet, to answer the people who
spoke to him and to lock himself up to die. He had done this,
wiping out all his faults with a single action, and in so doing had
granted me his forgiveness, because he was not accusing me...and
was ordering me to hold my peace...and to defend myself...against
everybody...especially against you, Germaine."</p>

<p>She uttered these last words more firmly. At first wholly
overwhelmed by the unconscious act which she had committed in
killing her husband, she had recovered her strength a little in
thinking of what she had done and in defending herself with such
energy. Faced by the intriguing woman whose hatred had driven both
of them to death and crime, she clenched her fists, ready for the
struggle, all quivering with resolution.</p>

<p>Germaine Astaing did not flinch. She had listened without a
word, with a relentless expression which grew harder and harder as
Thérèse's confessions became precise. No emotion seemed to soften
her and no remorse to penetrate her being. At most, towards the
end, her thin lips shaped themselves into a faint smile. She was
holding her prey in her clutches.</p>

<p>Slowly, with her eyes raised to a mirror, she adjusted her hat
and powdered her face. Then she walked to the door.</p>

<p>Thérèse darted forward:</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Where I choose."</p>

<p>"To see the examining-magistrate?"</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>"You shan't pass!"</p>

<p>"As you please. I'll wait for him here."</p>

<p>"And you'll tell him what?"</p>

<p>"Why, all that you've said, of course, all that you've been
silly enough to say. How could he doubt the story? You have
explained it all to me so fully."</p>

<p>Thérèse took her by the shoulders:</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'll explain other things to him at the same time,
Germaine, things that concern you. If I'm ruined, so shall you
be."</p>

<p>"You can't touch me."</p>

<p>"I can expose you, show your letters."</p>

<p>"What letters?"</p>

<p>"Those in which my death was decided on."</p>

<p>"Lies, Thérèse! You know that famous plot exists only in your
imagination. Neither Jacques nor I wished for your death."</p>

<p>"You did, at any rate. Your letters condemn you."</p>

<p>"Lies! They were the letters of a friend to a friend."</p>

<p>"Letters of a mistress to her paramour."</p>

<p>"Prove it."</p>

<p>"They are there, in Jacques' pocketbook."</p>

<p>"No, they're not."</p>

<p>"What's that you say?"</p>

<p>"I say that those letters belonged to me. I've taken them back,
or rather my brother has."</p>

<p>"You've stolen them, you wretch! And you shall give them back
again," cried Thérèse, shaking her.</p>

<p>"I haven't them. My brother kept them. He has gone."</p>

<p>Thérèse staggered and stretched out her hands to Rénine with an
expression of despair. Rénine said:</p>

<p>"What she says is true. I watched the brother's proceedings
while he was feeling in your bag. He took out the pocketbook,
looked through it with his sister, came and put it back again and
went off with the letters."</p>

<p>Rénine paused and added,</p>

<p>"Or, at least, with five of them."</p>

<p>The two women moved closer to him. What did he intend to convey?
If Frédéric Astaing had taken away only five letters, what had
become of the sixth?</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Rénine, "that, when the pocketbook fell on the
shingle, that sixth letter slipped out at the same time as the
photograph and that M. d'Ormeval must have picked it up, for I
found it in the pocket of his blazer, which had been hung up near
the bed. Here it is. It's signed Germaine Astaing and it is quite
enough to prove the writer's intentions and the murderous counsels
which she was pressing upon her lover."</p>

<p>Madame Astaing had turned grey in the face and was so much
disconcerted that she did not try to defend herself. Rénine
continued, addressing his remarks to her:</p>

<p>"To my mind, madame, you are responsible for all that happened.
Penniless, no doubt, and at the end of your resources, you tried to
profit by the passion with which you inspired M. d'Ormeval in order
to make him marry you, in spite of all the obstacles, and to lay
your hands upon his fortune. I have proofs of this greed for money
and these abominable calculations and can supply them if need be. A
few minutes after I had felt in the pocket of that jacket, you did
the same. I had removed the sixth letter, but had left a slip of
paper which you looked for eagerly and which also must have dropped
out of the pocketbook. It was an uncrossed cheque for a hundred
thousand francs, drawn by M. d'Ormeval in your brother's
name...just a little wedding-present...what we might call
pin-money. Acting on your instructions, your brother dashed off by
motor to Le Havre to reach the bank before four o'clock. I may as
well tell you that he will not have cashed the cheque, for I had a
telephone-message sent to the bank to announce the murder of M.
d'Ormeval, which stops all payments. The upshot of all this is that
the police, if you persist in your schemes of revenge, will have in
their hands all the proofs that are wanted against you and your
brother. I might add, as an edifying piece of evidence, the story
of the conversation which I overheard between your brother and
yourself in a dining-car on the railway between Brest and Paris, a
fortnight ago. But I feel sure that you will not drive me to adopt
these extreme measures and that we understand each other. Isn't
that so?"</p>

<p>Natures like Madame Astaing's, which are violent and headstrong
so long as a fight is possible and while a gleam of hope remains,
are easily swayed in defeat. Germaine was too intelligent not to
grasp the fact that the least attempt at resistance would be
shattered by such an adversary as this. She was in his hands. She
could but yield.</p>

<p>She therefore did not indulge in any playacting, nor in any
demonstration such as threats, outbursts of fury or hysterics. She
bowed:</p>

<p>"We are agreed," she said. "What are your terms?"</p>

<p>"Go away. If ever you are called upon for your evidence, say
that you know nothing."</p>

<p>She walked away. At the door, she hesitated and then, between
her teeth, said:</p>

<p>"The cheque."</p>

<p>Rénine looked at Madame d'Ormeval, who declared:</p>

<p>"Let her keep it. I would not touch that money."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>When Rénine had given Thérèse d'Ormeval precise instructions as
to how she was to behave at the enquiry and to answer the questions
put to her, he left the chalet, accompanied by Hortense Daniel.</p>

<p>On the beach below, the magistrate and the public prosecutor
were continuing their investigations, taking measurements,
examining the witnesses and generally laying their heads
together.</p>

<p>"When I think," said Hortense, "that you have the dagger and M.
d'Ormeval's pocketbook on you!"</p>

<p>"And it strikes you as awfully dangerous, I suppose?" he said,
laughing. "It strikes <i>me</i> as awfully comic."</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid?"</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"That they may suspect something?"</p>

<p>"Lord, they won't suspect a thing! We shall tell those good
people what we saw and our evidence will only increase their
perplexity, for we saw nothing at all. For prudence sake we will
stay a day or two, to see which way the wind is blowing. But it's
quite settled: they will never be able to make head or tail of the
matter."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, <i>you</i> guessed the secret and from the first.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Because, instead of seeking difficulties where none exist, as
people generally do, I always put the question as it should be put;
and the solution comes quite naturally. A man goes to his cabin and
locks himself in. Half an hour later, he is found inside, dead. No
one has gone in. What has happened? To my mind there is only one
answer. There is no need to think about it. As the murder was not
committed in the cabin, it must have been committed beforehand and
the man was already mortally wounded when he entered his cabin. And
forthwith the truth in this particular case appeared to me. Madame
d'Ormeval, who was to have been killed this evening, forestalled
her murderers and while her husband was stooping to the ground, in
a moment of frenzy stabbed him in the back. There was nothing left
to do but look for the reasons that prompted her action. When I
knew them, I took her part unreservedly. That's the whole
story."</p>

<p>The day was beginning to wane. The blue of the sky was becoming
darker and the sea, even more peaceful than before.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of?" asked Rénine, after a moment.</p>

<p>"I am thinking," she said, "that if I too were the victim of
some machination, I should trust you whatever happened, trust you
through and against all. I know, as certainly as I know that I
exist, that you would save me, whatever the obstacles might be.
There is no limit to the power of your will."</p>

<p>He said, very softly:</p>

<p>"There is no limit to my wish to please you."</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. The Lady with the Hatchet</h2>

<p>One of the most incomprehensible incidents that preceded the
great war was certainly the one which was known as the episode of
the lady with the hatchet. The solution of the mystery was unknown
and would never have been known, had not circumstances in the
cruellest fashion obliged Prince Rénine&mdash;or should I say,
Arsène Lupin&mdash;to take up the matter and had I not been able
today to tell the true story from the details supplied by him.</p>

<p>Let me recite the facts. In a space of eighteen months, five
women disappeared, five women of different stations in life, all
between twenty and thirty years of age and living in Paris or the
Paris district.</p>

<p>I will give their names: Madame Ladoue, the wife of a doctor;
Mlle. Ardant, the daughter of a banker; Mlle. Covereau, a
washerwoman of Courbevoie; Mlle. Honorine Vernisset, a dressmaker;
and Madame Grollinger, an artist. These five women disappeared
without the possibility of discovering a single particular to
explain why they had left their homes, why they did not return to
them, who had enticed them away, and where and how they were
detained.</p>

<p>Each of these women, a week after her departure, was found
somewhere or other in the western outskirts of Paris; and each time
it was a dead body that was found, the dead body of a woman who had
been killed by a blow on the head from a hatchet. And each time,
not far from the woman, who was firmly bound, her face covered with
blood and her body emaciated by lack of food, the marks of
carriage-wheels proved that the corpse had been driven to the
spot.</p>

<p>The five murders were so much alike that there was only a single
investigation, embracing all the five enquiries and, for that
matter, leading to no result. A woman disappeared; a week later, to
a day, her body was discovered; and that was all. The bonds that
fastened her were similar in each case; so were the tracks left by
the wheels; so were the blows of the hatchet, all of which were
struck vertically at the top and right in the middle of the
forehead.</p>

<p>The motive of the crime? The five women had been completely
stripped of their jewels, purses and other objects of value. But
the robberies might well have been attributed to marauders or any
passersby, since the bodies were lying in deserted spots. Were the
authorities to believe in the execution of a plan of revenge or of
a plan intended to do away with the series of persons mutually
connected, persons, for instance, likely to benefit by a future
inheritance? Here again the same obscurity prevailed. Theories were
built up, only to be demolished forthwith by an examination of the
facts. Trails were followed and at once abandoned.</p>

<p>And suddenly there was a sensation. A woman engaged in sweeping
the roads picked up on the pavement a little notebook which she
brought to the local police-station. The leaves of this notebook
were all blank, excepting one, on which was written a list of the
murdered women, with their names set down in order of date and
accompanied by three figures: Ladoue, 132; Vernisset, 118; and so
on.</p>

<p>Certainly no importance would have been attached to these
entries, which anybody might have written, since everyone was
acquainted with the sinister list. But, instead of five names, it
included six! Yes, below the words "Grollinger, 128," there
appeared "Williamson, 114." Did this indicate a sixth murder?</p>

<p>The obviously English origin of the name limited the field of
the investigations, which did not in fact take long. It was
ascertained that, a fortnight ago, a Miss Hermione Williamson, a
governess in a family at Auteuil, had left her place to go back to
England and that, since then, her sisters, though she had written
to tell them that she was coming over, had heard no more of
her.</p>

<p>A fresh enquiry was instituted. A postman found the body in the
Meudon woods. Miss Williamson's skull was split down the
middle.</p>

<p>I need not describe the public excitement at this stage nor the
shudder of horror which passed through the crowd when it read this
list, written without a doubt in the murderer's own hand. What
could be more frightful than such a record, kept up to date like a
careful tradesman's ledger:</p>

<p>"On such a day, I killed so-and-so; on such a day
so-and-so!"</p>

<p>And the sum total was six dead bodies.</p>

<p>Against all expectation, the experts in handwriting had no
difficulty in agreeing and unanimously declared that the writing
was "that of a woman, an educated woman, possessing artistic
tastes, imagination and an extremely sensitive nature." The "lady
with the hatchet," as the journalists christened her, was decidedly
no ordinary person; and scores of newspaper-articles made a special
study of her case, exposing her mental condition and losing
themselves in farfetched explanations.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was the writer of one of these articles, a young
journalist whose chance discovery made him the centre of public
attention, who supplied the one element of truth and shed upon the
darkness the only ray of light that was to penetrate it. In casting
about for the meaning of the figures which followed the six names,
he had come to ask himself whether those figures did not simply
represent the number of the days separating one crime from the
next. All that he had to do was to check the dates. He at once
found that his theory was correct. Mlle. Vernisset had been carried
off one hundred and thirty-two days after Madame Ladoue; Mlle.
Covereau one hundred and eighteen days after Honorine Vernisset;
and so on.</p>

<p>There was therefore no room for doubt; and the police had no
choice but to accept a solution which so precisely fitted the
circumstances: the figures corresponded with the intervals. There
was no mistake in the records of the lady with the hatchet.</p>

<p>But then one deduction became inevitable. Miss Williamson, the
latest victim, had been carried off on the 26th of June last, and
her name was followed by the figures 114: was it not to be presumed
that a fresh crime would be committed a hundred and fourteen days
later, that is to say, on the 18th of October? Was it not probable
that the horrible business would be repeated in accordance with the
murderer's secret intentions? Were they not bound to pursue to its
logical conclusion the argument which ascribed to the
figures&mdash;to all the figures, to the last as well as to the
others&mdash;their value as eventual dates?</p>

<p>Now it was precisely this deduction which was drawn and was
being weighed and discussed during the few days that preceded the
18th of October, when logic demanded the performance of yet another
act of the abominable tragedy. And it was only natural that, on the
morning of that day, Prince Rénine and Hortense, when making an
appointment by telephone for the evening, should allude to the
newspaper-articles which they had both been reading:</p>

<p>"Look out!" said Rénine, laughing. "If you meet the lady with
the hatchet, take the other side of the road!"</p>

<p>"And, if the good lady carries me off, what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Strew your path with little white pebbles and say, until the
very moment when the hatchet flashes in the air, 'I have nothing to
fear; <i>he</i> will save me.' <i>He</i> is myself...and I kiss
your hands. Till this evening, my dear."</p>

<p>That afternoon, Rénine had an appointment with Rose Andrée and
Dalbrèque to arrange for their departure for the States.* Before
four and seven o'clock, he bought the different editions of the
evening papers. None of them reported an abduction.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* See <i>The Telltale Film</i>]</p>

<p>At nine o'clock he went to the Gymnase, where he had taken a
private box.</p>

<p>At half-past nine, as Hortense had not arrived, he rang her up,
though without thought of anxiety. The maid replied that Madame
Daniel had not come in yet.</p>

<p>Seized with a sudden fear, Rénine hurried to the furnished flat
which Hortense was occupying for the time being, near the Parc
Monceau, and questioned the maid, whom he had engaged for her and
who was completely devoted to him. The woman said that her mistress
had gone out at two o'clock, with a stamped letter in her hand,
saying that she was going to the post and that she would come back
to dress. This was the last that had been seen of her.</p>

<p>"To whom was the letter addressed?"</p>

<p>"To you, sir. I saw the writing on the envelope: Prince Serge
Rénine."</p>

<p>He waited until midnight, but in vain. Hortense did not return;
nor did she return next day.</p>

<p>"Not a word to anyone," said Rénine to the maid. "Say that your
mistress is in the country and that you are going to join her."</p>

<p>For his own part, he had not a doubt: Hortense's disappearance
was explained by the very fact of the date, the 18th of October.
She was the seventh victim of the lady with the hatchet.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>"The abduction," said Rénine to himself, "precedes the blow of
the hatchet by a week. I have, therefore, at the present moment,
seven full days before me. Let us say six, to avoid any surprise.
This is Saturday: Hortense must be set free by midday on Friday;
and, to make sure of this, I must know her hiding-place by nine
o'clock on Thursday evening at latest."</p>

<p>Rénine wrote:</p>

<p class="letter">THURSDAY EVENING, NINE O'CLOCK,</p>

<p>in big letters, on a card which he nailed above the mantelpiece
in his study. Then at midday on Saturday, the day after the
disappearance, he locked himself into the study, after telling his
man not to disturb him except for meals and letters.</p>

<p>He spent four days there, almost without moving. He had
immediately sent for a set of all the leading newspapers which had
spoken in detail of the first six crimes. When he had read and
reread them, he closed the shutters, drew the curtains and lay down
on the sofa in the dark, with the door bolted, thinking.</p>

<p>By Tuesday evening he was no further advanced than on the
Saturday. The darkness was as dense as ever. He had not discovered
the smallest clue for his guidance, nor could he see the slightest
reason to hope.</p>

<p>At times, notwithstanding his immense power of self-control and
his unlimited confidence in the resources at his disposal, at times
he would quake with anguish. Would he arrive in time? There was no
reason why he should see more clearly during the last few days than
during those which had already elapsed. And this meant that
Hortense Daniel would inevitably be murdered.</p>

<p>The thought tortured him. He was attached to Hortense by a much
stronger and deeper feeling than the appearance of the relations
between them would have led an onlooker to believe. The curiosity
at the beginning, the first desire, the impulse to protect
Hortense, to distract her, to inspire her with a relish for
existence: all this had simply turned to love. Neither of them was
aware of it, because they barely saw each other save at critical
times when they were occupied with the adventures of others and not
with their own. But, at the first onslaught of danger, Rénine
realized the place which Hortense had taken in his life and he was
in despair at knowing her to be a prisoner and a martyr and at
being unable to save her.</p>

<p>He spent a feverish, agitated night, turning the case over and
over from every point of view. The Wednesday morning was also a
terrible time for him. He was losing ground. Giving up his
hermit-like seclusion, he threw open the windows and paced to and
fro through his rooms, ran out into the street and came in again,
as though fleeing before the thought that obsessed him:</p>

<p>"Hortense is suffering...Hortense is in the depths...She sees
the hatchet...She is calling to me...She is entreating me...And I
can do nothing..."</p>

<p>It was at five o'clock in the afternoon that, on examining the
list of the six names, he received that little inward shock which
is a sort of signal of the truth that is being sought for. A light
shot through his mind. It was not, to be sure, that brilliant light
in which every detail is made plain, but it was enough to tell him
in which direction to move.</p>

<p>His plan of campaign was formed at once. He sent Adolphe, his
chauffeur, to the principal newspapers, with a few lines which were
to appear in type among the next morning's advertisements. Adolphe
was also told to go to the laundry at Courbevoie, where Mlle.
Covereau, the second of the six victims, had been employed.</p>

<p>On the Thursday, Rénine did not stir out of doors. In the
afternoon, he received several letters in reply to his
advertisement. Then two telegrams arrived. Lastly, at three
o'clock, there came a pneumatic letter, bearing the Trocadéro
postmark, which seemed to be what he was expecting.</p>

<p>He turned up a directory, noted an address&mdash;"M. de
Lourtier-Vaneau, retired colonial governor, 47 <i>bis</i>, Avenue
Kléber"&mdash;and ran down to his car:</p>

<p>"Adolphe, 47 <i>bis</i>, Avenue Kléber."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>He was shown into a large study furnished with magnificent
bookcases containing old volumes in costly bindings. M. de
Lourtier-Vaneau was a man still in the prime of life, wearing a
slightly grizzled beard and, by his affable manners and genuine
distinction, commanding confidence and liking.</p>

<p>"M. de Lourtier," said Rénine, "I have ventured to call on your
excellency because I read in last year's newspapers that you used
to know one of the victims of the lady with the hatchet, Honorine
Vernisset."</p>

<p>"Why, of course we knew her!" cried M. de Lourtier. "My wife
used to employ her as a dressmaker by the day. Poor girl!"</p>

<p>"M. de Lourtier, a lady of my acquaintance has disappeared as
the other six victims disappeared."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed M. de Lourtier, with a start. "But I have
followed the newspapers carefully. There was nothing on the 18th of
October."</p>

<p>"Yes, a woman of whom I am very fond, Madame Hortense Daniel,
was abducted on the 17th of October."</p>

<p>"And this is the 22nd!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and the murder will be committed on the 24th."</p>

<p>"Horrible! Horrible! It must be prevented at all costs..."</p>

<p>"And I shall perhaps succeed in preventing it, with your
excellency's assistance."</p>

<p>"But have you been to the police?"</p>

<p>"No. We are faced by mysteries which are, so to speak, absolute
and compact, which offer no gap through which the keenest eyes can
see and which it is useless to hope to clear up by ordinary
methods, such as inspection of the scenes of the crimes, police
enquiries, searching for fingerprints and so on. As none of those
proceedings served any good purpose in the previous cases, it would
be waste of time to resort to them in a seventh, similar case. An
enemy who displays such skill and subtlety would not leave behind
her any of those clumsy traces which are the first things that a
professional detective seizes upon."</p>

<p>"Then what have you done?"</p>

<p>"Before taking any action, I have reflected. I gave four days to
thinking the matter over."</p>

<p>M. de Lourtier-Vaneau examined his visitor closely and, with a
touch of irony, asked:</p>

<p>"And the result of your meditations...?"</p>

<p>"To begin with," said Rénine, refusing to be put out of
countenance, "I have submitted all these cases to a comprehensive
survey, which hitherto no one else had done. This enabled me to
discover their general meaning, to put aside all the tangle of
embarrassing theories and, since no one was able to agree as to the
motives of all this filthy business, to attribute it to the only
class of persons capable of it."</p>

<p>"That is to say?"</p>

<p>"Lunatics, your excellency."</p>

<p>M. de Lourtier-Vaneau started:</p>

<p>"Lunatics? What an idea!"</p>

<p>"M. de Lourtier, the woman known as the lady with the hatchet is
a madwoman."</p>

<p>"But she would be locked up!"</p>

<p>"We don't know that she's not. We don't know that she is not one
of those half-mad people, apparently harmless, who are watched so
slightly that they have full scope to indulge their little manias,
their wild-beast instincts. Nothing could be more treacherous than
these creatures. Nothing could be more crafty, more patient, more
persistent, more dangerous and at the same time more absurd and
more logical, more slovenly and more methodical. All these
epithets, M. de Lourtier, may be applied to the doings of the lady
with the hatchet. The obsession of an idea and the continual
repetition of an act are characteristics of the maniac. I do not
yet know the idea by which the lady with the hatchet is obsessed
but I do know the act that results from it; and it is always the
same. The victim is bound with precisely similar ropes. She is
killed after the same number of days. She is struck by an identical
blow, with the same instrument, in the same place, the middle of
the forehead, producing an absolutely vertical wound. An ordinary
murderer displays some variety. His trembling hand swerves aside
and strikes awry. The lady with the hatchet does not tremble. It is
as though she had taken measurements; and the edge of her weapon
does not swerve by a hair's breadth. Need I give you any further
proofs or examine all the other details with you? Surely not. You
now possess the key to the riddle; and you know as I do that only a
lunatic can behave in this way, stupidly, savagely, mechanically,
like a striking clock or the blade of the guillotine..."</p>

<p>M. de Lourtier-Vaneau nodded his head:</p>

<p>"Yes, that is so. One can see the whole affair from that
angle...and I am beginning to believe that this is how one ought to
see it. But, if we admit that this madwoman has the sort of
mathematical logic which governed the murders of the six victims, I
see no connection between the victims themselves. She struck at
random. Why this victim rather than that?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Rénine. "Your excellency is asking me a question
which I asked myself from the first moment, the question which sums
up the whole problem and which cost me so much trouble to solve!
Why Hortense Daniel rather than another? Among two millions of
women who might have been selected, why Hortense? Why little
Vernisset? Why Miss Williamson? If the affair is such as I
conceived it, as a whole, that is to say, based upon the blind and
fantastic logic of a madwoman, a choice was inevitably exercised.
Now in what did that choice consist? What was the quality, or the
defect, or the sign needed to induce the lady with the hatchet to
strike? In a word, if she chose&mdash;and she must have
chosen&mdash;what directed her choice?"</p>

<p>"Have you found the answer?"</p>

<p>Rénine paused and replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, your excellency, I have. And I could have found it at the
very outset, since all that I had to do was to make a careful
examination of the list of victims. But these flashes of truth are
never kindled save in a brain overstimulated by effort and
reflection. I stared at the list twenty times over, before that
little detail took a definite shape."</p>

<p>"I don't follow you," said M. de Lourtier-Vaneau.</p>

<p>"M. de Lourtier, it may be noted that, if a number of persons
are brought together in any transaction, or crime, or public
scandal or whatnot, they are almost invariably described in the
same way. On this occasion, the newspapers never mentioned anything
more than their surnames in speaking of Madame Ladoue, Mlle. Ardent
or Mlle. Covereau. On the other hand, Mlle. Vernisset and Miss
Williamson were always described by their Christian names as well:
Honorine and Hermione. If the same thing had been done in the case
of all the six victims, there would have been no mystery."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because we should at once have realized the relation existing
between the six unfortunate women, as I myself suddenly realized it
on comparing those two Christian names with that of Hortense
Daniel. You understand now, don't you? You see the three Christian
names before your eyes..."</p>

<p>M. de Lourtier-Vaneau seemed to be perturbed. Turning a little
pale, he said:</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean," continued Rénine, in a clear voice, sounding each
syllable separately, "I mean that you see before your eyes three
Christian names which all three begin with the same initial and
which all three, by a remarkable coincidence, consist of the same
number of letters, as you may prove. If you enquire at the
Courbevoie laundry, where Mlle. Covereau used to work, you will
find that her name was Hilairie. Here again we have the same
initial and the same number of letters. There is no need to seek
any farther. We are sure, are we not, that the Christian names of
all the victims offer the same peculiarities? And this gives us,
with absolute certainty, the key to the problem which was set us.
It explains the madwoman's choice. We now know the connection
between the unfortunate victims. There can be no mistake about it.
It's that and nothing else. And how this method of choosing
confirms my theory! What proof of madness! Why kill these women
rather than any others? Because their names begin with an H and
consist of eight letters! You understand me, M. de Lourtier, do you
not? The number of letters is eight. The initial letter is the
eighth letter of the alphabet; and the word <i>huit</i>, eight,
begins with an H. Always the letter H. <i>And the implement used to
commit the crime was a hatchet.</i> Is your excellency prepared to
tell me that the lady with the hatchet is not a madwoman?"</p>

<p>Rénine interrupted himself and went up to M. de
Lourtier-Vaneau:</p>

<p>"What's the matter, your excellency? Are you unwell?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said M. de Lourtier, with the perspiration streaming
down his forehead. "No...but all this story is so upsetting! Only
think, I knew one of the victims! And then..."</p>

<p>Rénine took a water-bottle and tumbler from a small table,
filled the glass and handed it to M. de Lourtier, who sipped a few
mouthfuls from it and then, pulling himself together, continued, in
a voice which he strove to make firmer than it had been:</p>

<p>"Very well. We'll admit your supposition. Even so, it is
necessary that it should lead to tangible results. What have you
done?"</p>

<p>"This morning I published in all the newspapers an advertisement
worded as follows: 'Excellent cook seeks situation. Write before 5
p.m. to Herminie, Boulevard Haussmann, etc.' You continue to follow
me, don't you, M. de Lourtier? Christian names beginning with an H
and consisting of eight letters are extremely rare and are all
rather out of date: Herminie, Hilairie, Hermione. Well, these
Christian names, for reasons which I do not understand, are
essential to the madwoman. She cannot do without them. To find
women bearing one of these Christian names and for this purpose
only she summons up all her remaining powers of reason,
discernment, reflection and intelligence. She hunts about. She asks
questions. She lies in wait. She reads newspapers which she hardly
understands, but in which certain details, certain capital letters
catch her eye. And consequently I did not doubt for a second that
this name of Herminie, printed in large type, would attract her
attention and that she would be caught today in the trap of my
advertisement."</p>

<p>"Did she write?" asked M. de Lourtier-Vaneau, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Several ladies," Rénine continued, "wrote the letters which are
usual in such cases, to offer a home to the so-called Herminie. But
I received an express letter which struck me as interesting."</p>

<p>"From whom?"</p>

<p>"Read it, M. de Lourtier."</p>

<p>M. de Lourtier-Vaneau snatched the sheet from Rénine's hands and
cast a glance at the signature. His first movement was one of
surprise, as though he had expected something different. Then he
gave a long, loud laugh of something like joy and relief.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh, M. de Lourtier? You seem pleased."</p>

<p>"Pleased, no. But this letter is signed by my wife."</p>

<p>"And you were afraid of finding something else?"</p>

<p>"Oh no! But since it's my wife..."</p>

<p>He did not finish his sentence and said to Rénine:</p>

<p>"Come this way."</p>

<p>He led him through a passage to a little drawing-room where a
fair-haired lady, with a happy and tender expression on her comely
face, was sitting in the midst of three children and helping them
with their lessons.</p>

<p>She rose. M. de Lourtier briefly presented his visitor and asked
his wife:</p>

<p>"Suzanne, is this express message from you?"</p>

<p>"To Mlle. Herminie, Boulevard Haussmann? Yes," she said, "I sent
it. As you know, our parlourmaid's leaving and I'm looking out for
a new one."</p>

<p>Rénine interrupted her:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, madame. Just one question: where did you get the
woman's address?"</p>

<p>She flushed. Her husband insisted:</p>

<p>"Tell us, Suzanne. Who gave you the address?"</p>

<p>"I was rung up."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>She hesitated and then said:</p>

<p>"Your old nurse."</p>

<p>"Félicienne?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>M. de Lourtier cut short the conversation and, without
permitting Rénine to ask any more questions, took him back to the
study:</p>

<p>"You see, monsieur, that pneumatic letter came from a quite
natural source. Félicienne, my old nurse, who lives not far from
Paris on an allowance which I make her, read your advertisement and
told Madame de Lourtier of it. For, after all," he added laughing,
"I don't suppose that you suspect my wife of being the lady with
the hatchet."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then the incident is closed...at least on my side. I have done
what I could, I have listened to your arguments and I am very sorry
that I can be of no more use to you..."</p>

<p>He drank another glass of water and sat down. His face was
distorted. Rénine looked at him for a few seconds, as a man will
look at a failing adversary who has only to receive the knockout
blow, and, sitting down beside him, suddenly gripped his arm:</p>

<p>"Your excellency, if you do not speak, Hortense Daniel will be
the seventh victim."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say, monsieur! What do you think I know?"</p>

<p>"The truth! My explanations have made it plain to you. Your
distress, your terror are positive proofs."</p>

<p>"But, after all, monsieur, if I knew, why should I be
silent?"</p>

<p>"For fear of scandal. There is in your life, so a profound
intuition assures me, something that you are constrained to hide.
The truth about this monstrous tragedy, which suddenly flashed upon
you, this truth, if it were known, would spell dishonour to you,
disgrace...and you are shrinking from your duty."</p>

<p>M. de Lourtier did not reply. Rénine leant over him and, looking
him in the eyes, whispered:</p>

<p>"There will be no scandal. I shall be the only person in the
world to know what has happened. And I am as much interested as
yourself in not attracting attention, because I love Hortense
Daniel and do not wish her name to be mixed up in your horrible
story."</p>

<p>They remained face to face during a long interval. Rénine's
expression was harsh and unyielding. M. de Lourtier felt that
nothing would bend him if the necessary words remained unspoken;
but he could not bring himself to utter them:</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," he said. "You think you have seen things
that don't exist."</p>

<p>Rénine received a sudden and terrifying conviction that, if this
man took refuge in a stolid silence, there was no hope for Hortense
Daniel; and he was so much infuriated by the thought that the key
to the riddle lay there, within reach of his hand, that he clutched
M. de Lourtier by the throat and forced him backwards:</p>

<p>"I'll have no more lies! A woman's life is at stake! Speak...and
speak at once! If not...!"</p>

<p>M. de Lourtier had no strength left in him. All resistance was
impossible. It was not that Rénine's attack alarmed him, or that he
was yielding to this act of violence, but he felt crushed by that
indomitable will, which seemed to admit no obstacle, and he
stammered:</p>

<p>"You are right. It is my duty to tell everything, whatever comes
of it."</p>

<p>"Nothing will come of it, I pledge my word, on condition that
you save Hortense Daniel. A moment's hesitation may undo us all.
Speak. No details, but the actual facts."</p>

<p>"Madame de Lourtier is not my wife. The only woman who has the
right to bear my name is one whom I married when I was a young
colonial official. She was a rather eccentric woman, of feeble
mentality and incredibly subject to impulses that amounted to
monomania. We had two children, twins, whom she worshipped and in
whose company she would no doubt have recovered her mental balance
and moral health, when, by a stupid accident&mdash;a passing
carriage&mdash;they were killed before her eyes. The poor thing
went mad...with the silent, secretive madness which you imagined.
Some time afterwards, when I was appointed to an Algerian station,
I brought her to France and put her in the charge of a worthy
creature who had nursed me and brought me up. Two years later, I
made the acquaintance of the woman who was to become the joy of my
life. You saw her just now. She is the mother of my children and
she passes as my wife. Are we to sacrifice her? Is our whole
existence to be shipwrecked in horror and must our name be coupled
with this tragedy of madness and blood?"</p>

<p>Rénine thought for a moment and asked:</p>

<p>"What is the other one's name?"</p>

<p>"Hermance."</p>

<p>"Hermance! Still that initial...still those eight letters!"</p>

<p>"That was what made me realize everything just now," said M. de
Lourtier. "When you compared the different names, I at once
reflected that my unhappy wife was called Hermance and that she was
mad...and all the proofs leapt to my mind."</p>

<p>"But, though we understand the selection of the victims, how are
we to explain the murders? What are the symptoms of her madness?
Does she suffer at all?"</p>

<p>"She does not suffer very much at present. But she has suffered
in the past, the most terrible suffering that you can imagine:
since the moment when her two children were run over before her
eyes, night and day she had the horrible spectacle of their death
before her eyes, without a moment's interruption, for she never
slept for a single second. Think of the torture of it! To see her
children dying through all the hours of the long day and all the
hours of the interminable night!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," Rénine objected, "it is not to drive away that
picture that she commits murder?"</p>

<p>"Yes, possibly," said M. de Lourtier, thoughtfully, "to drive it
away by sleep."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"You don't understand, because we are talking of a
madwoman...and because all that happens in that disordered brain is
necessarily incoherent and abnormal?"</p>

<p>"Obviously. But, all the same, is your supposition based on
facts that justify it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, on facts which I had, in a way, overlooked but which today
assume their true significance. The first of these facts dates a
few years back, to a morning when my old nurse for the first time
found Hermance fast asleep. Now she was holding her hands clutched
around a puppy which she had strangled. And the same thing was
repeated on three other occasions."</p>

<p>"And she slept?"</p>

<p>"Yes, each time she slept a sleep which lasted for several
nights."</p>

<p>"And what conclusion did you draw?"</p>

<p>"I concluded that the relaxation of the nerves provoked by
taking life exhausted her and predisposed her for sleep."</p>

<p>Rénine shuddered:</p>

<p>"That's it! There's not a doubt of it! The taking life, the
effort of killing makes her sleep. And she began with women what
had served her so well with animals. All her madness has become
concentrated on that one point: she kills them to rob them of their
sleep! She wanted sleep; and she steals the sleep of others! That's
it, isn't it? For the past two years, she has been sleeping?"</p>

<p>"For the past two years, she has been sleeping," stammered M. de
Lourtier.</p>

<p>Rénine gripped him by the shoulder:</p>

<p>"And it never occurred to you that her madness might go farther,
that she would stop at nothing to win the blessing of sleep! Let us
make haste, monsieur! All this is horrible!"</p>

<p>They were both making for the door, when M. de Lourtier
hesitated. The telephone-bell was ringing.</p>

<p>"It's from there," he said.</p>

<p>"From there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my old nurse gives me the news at the same time every
day."</p>

<p>He unhooked the receivers and handed one to Rénine, who
whispered in his ear the questions which he was to put.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Félicienne? How is she?"</p>

<p>"Not so bad, sir."</p>

<p>"Is she sleeping well?"</p>

<p>"Not very well, lately. Last night, indeed, she never closed her
eyes. So she's very gloomy just now."</p>

<p>"What is she doing at the moment?"</p>

<p>"She is in her room."</p>

<p>"Go to her, Félicienne, and don't leave her."</p>

<p>"I can't. She's locked herself in."</p>

<p>"You must, Félicienne. Break open the door. I'm coming straight
on...Hullo! Hullo!...Oh, damnation, they've cut us off!"</p>

<p>Without a word, the two men left the flat and ran down to the
avenue. Rénine hustled M. de Lourtier into the car:</p>

<p>"What address?"</p>

<p>"Ville d'Avray."</p>

<p>"Of course! In the very center of her operations...like a spider
in the middle of her web! Oh, the shame of it!"</p>

<p>He was profoundly agitated. He saw the whole adventure in its
monstrous reality.</p>

<p>"Yes, she kills them to steal their sleep, as she used to kill
the animals. It is the same obsession, but complicated by a whole
array of utterly incomprehensible practices and superstitions. She
evidently fancies that the similarity of the Christian names to her
own is indispensable and that she will not sleep unless her victim
is an Hortense or an Honorine. It's a madwoman's argument; its
logic escapes us and we know nothing of its origin; but we can't
get away from it. She has to hunt and has to find. And she finds
and carries off her prey beforehand and watches over it for the
appointed number of days, until the moment when, crazily, through
the hole which she digs with a hatchet in the middle of the skull,
she absorbs the sleep which stupefies her and grants her oblivion
for a given period. And here again we see absurdity and madness.
Why does she fix that period at so many days? Why should one victim
ensure her a hundred and twenty days of sleep and another a hundred
and twenty-five? What insanity! The calculation is mysterious and
of course mad; but the fact remains that, at the end of a hundred
or a hundred and twenty-five days, as the case may be, a fresh
victim is sacrificed; and there have been six already and the
seventh is awaiting her turn. Ah, monsieur, what a terrible
responsibility for you! Such a monster as that! She should never
have been allowed out of sight!"</p>

<p>M. de Lourtier-Vaneau made no protest. His air of dejection, his
pallor, his trembling hands, all proved his remorse and his
despair:</p>

<p>"She deceived me," he murmured. "She was outwardly so quiet, so
docile! And, after all, she's in a lunatic asylum."</p>

<p>"Then how can she...?"</p>

<p>"The asylum," explained M. de Lourtier, "is made up of a number
of separate buildings scattered over extensive grounds. The sort of
cottage in which Hermance lives stands quite apart. There is first
a room occupied by Félicienne, then Hermance's bedroom and two
separate rooms, one of which has its windows overlooking the open
country. I suppose it is there that she locks up her victims."</p>

<p>"But the carriage that conveys the dead bodies?"</p>

<p>"The stables of the asylum are quite close to the cottage.
There's a horse and carriage there for station work. Hermance no
doubt gets up at night, harnesses the horse and slips the body
through the window."</p>

<p>"And the nurse who watches her?"</p>

<p>"Félicienne is very old and rather deaf."</p>

<p>"But by day she sees her mistress moving to and fro, doing this
and that. Must we not admit a certain complicity?"</p>

<p>"Never! Félicienne herself has been deceived by Hermance's
hypocrisy."</p>

<p>"All the same, it was she who telephoned to Madame de Lourtier
first, about that advertisement..."</p>

<p>"Very naturally. Hermance, who talks now and then, who argues,
who buries herself in the newspapers, which she does not
understand, as you were saying just now, but reads through them
attentively, must have seen the advertisement and, having heard
that we were looking for a servant, must have asked Félicienne to
ring me up."</p>

<p>"Yes...yes...that is what I felt," said Rénine, slowly. "She
marks down her victims...With Hortense dead, she would have known,
once she had used up her allowance of sleep, where to find an
eighth victim...But how did she entice the unfortunate women? How
did she entice Hortense?"</p>

<p>The car was rushing along, but not fast enough to please Rénine,
who rated the chauffeur:</p>

<p>"Push her along, Adolphe, can't you?...We're losing time, my
man."</p>

<p>Suddenly the fear of arriving too late began to torture him. The
logic of the insane is subject to sudden changes of mood, to any
perilous idea that may enter the mind. The madwoman might easily
mistake the date and hasten the catastrophe, like a clock out of
order which strikes an hour too soon.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as her sleep was once more disturbed, might
she not be tempted to take action without waiting for the appointed
moment? Was this not the reason why she had locked herself into her
room? Heavens, what agonies her prisoner must be suffering! What
shudders of terror at the executioner's least movement!</p>

<p>"Faster, Adolphe, or I'll take the wheel myself! Faster, hang
it."</p>

<p>At last they reached Ville d'Avray. There was a steep, sloping
road on the right and walls interrupted by a long railing.</p>

<p>"Drive round the grounds, Adolphe. We mustn't give warning of
our presence, must we, M. de Lourtier? Where is the cottage?"</p>

<p>"Just opposite," said M. de Lourtier-Vaneau.</p>

<p>They got out a little farther on. Rénine began to run along a
bank at the side of an ill-kept sunken road. It was almost dark. M.
de Lourtier said:</p>

<p>"Here, this building standing a little way back...Look at that
window on the ground-floor. It belongs to one of the separate
rooms...and that is obviously how she slips out."</p>

<p>"But the window seems to be barred."</p>

<p>"Yes; and that is why no one suspected anything. But she must
have found some way to get through."</p>

<p>The ground-floor was built over deep cellars. Rénine quickly
clambered up, finding a foothold on a projecting ledge of
stone.</p>

<p>Sure enough, one of the bars was missing.</p>

<p>He pressed his face to the windowpane and looked in.</p>

<p>The room was dark inside. Nevertheless he was able to
distinguish at the back a woman seated beside another woman, who
was lying on a mattress. The woman seated was holding her forehead
in her hands and gazing at the woman who was lying down.</p>

<p>"It's she," whispered M. de Lourtier, who had also climbed the
wall. "The other one is bound."</p>

<p>Rénine took from his pocket a glazier's diamond and cut out one
of the panes without making enough noise to arouse the madwoman's
attention. He next slid his hand to the window-fastening and turned
it softly, while with his left hand he levelled a revolver.</p>

<p>"You're not going to fire, surely!" M. de Lourtier-Vaneau
entreated.</p>

<p>"If I must, I shall."</p>

<p>Rénine pushed open the window gently. But there was an obstacle
of which he was not aware, a chair which toppled over and fell.</p>

<p>He leapt into the room and threw away his revolver in order to
seize the madwoman. But she did not wait for him. She rushed to the
door, opened it and fled, with a hoarse cry.</p>

<p>M. de Lourtier made as though to run after her.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" said Rénine, kneeling down, "Let's save the
victim first."</p>

<p>He was instantly reassured: Hortense was alive.</p>

<p>The first thing that he did was to cut the cords and remove the
gag that was stifling her. Attracted by the noise, the old nurse
had hastened to the room with a lamp, which Rénine took from her,
casting its light on Hortense.</p>

<p>He was astounded: though livid and exhausted, with emaciated
features and eyes blazing with fever, Hortense was trying to smile.
She whispered:</p>

<p>"I was expecting you...I did not despair for a moment...I was
sure of you..."</p>

<p>She fainted.</p>

<p>An hour later, after much useless searching around the cottage,
they found the madwoman locked into a large cupboard in the loft.
She had hanged herself.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Hortense refused to stay another night. Besides, it was better
that the cottage should be empty when the old nurse announced the
madwoman's suicide. Rénine gave Félicienne minute directions as to
what she should do and say; and then, assisted by the chauffeur and
M. de Lourtier, carried Hortense to the car and brought her
home.</p>

<p>She was soon convalescent. Two days later, Rénine carefully
questioned her and asked her how she had come to know the
madwoman.</p>

<p>"It was very simple," she said. "My husband, who is not quite
sane, as I have told you, is being looked after at Ville d'Avray;
and I sometimes go to see him, without telling anybody, I admit.
That was how I came to speak to that poor madwoman and how, the
other day, she made signs that she wanted me to visit her. We were
alone. I went into the cottage. She threw herself upon me and
overpowered me before I had time to cry for help. I thought it was
a jest; and so it was, wasn't it: a madwoman's jest? She was quite
gentle with me...All the same, she let me starve. But I was so sure
of you!"</p>

<p>"And weren't you frightened?"</p>

<p>"Of starving? No. Besides, she gave me some food, now and then,
when the fancy took her...And then I was sure of you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but there was something else: that other peril..."</p>

<p>"What other peril?" she asked, ingenuously.</p>

<p>Rénine gave a start. He suddenly understood&mdash;it seemed
strange at first, though it was quite natural&mdash;that Hortense
had not for a moment suspected and did not yet suspect the terrible
danger which she had run. Her mind had not connected with her own
adventure the murders committed by the lady with the hatchet.</p>

<p>He thought that it would always be time enough to tell her the
truth. For that matter, a few days later her husband, who had been
locked up for years, died in the asylum at Ville d'Avray, and
Hortense, who had been recommended by her doctor a short period of
rest and solitude, went to stay with a relation living near the
village of Bassicourt, in the centre of France.</p>

<p class="letter">To Prince Serge Rénine,<br>
Boulevard Haussmann,<br>
Paris<br>
<br></p>

<p>La Roncière<br>
Near Bassicourt,<br>
14 November.<br>
<br>
My dear friend&mdash;<br>
<br>
You must be thinking me very ungrateful. I have been here three
weeks; and you have had not one letter from me! Not a word of
thanks! And yet I ended by realizing from what terrible death you
saved me and understanding the secret of that terrible business!
But indeed, indeed I couldn't help it! I was in such a state of
prostration after it all! I needed rest and solitude so badly! Was
I to stay in Paris? Was I to continue my expeditions with you? No,
no, no! I had had enough adventures! Other people's are very
interesting, I admit. But when one is one's self the victim and
barely escapes with one's life?...Oh, my dear friend, how horrible
it was! Shall I ever forget it?...<br>
<br>
Here, at la Roncière, I enjoy the greatest peace. My old spinster
cousin Ermelin pets and coddles me like an invalid. I am getting
back my colour and am very well, physically...so much so, in fact,
that I no longer ever think of interesting myself in other people's
business. Never again! For instance (I am only telling you this
because you are incorrigible, as inquisitive as any old charwoman,
and always ready to busy yourself with things that don't concern
you), yesterday I was present at a rather curious meeting.
Antoinette had taken me to the inn at Bassicourt, where we were
having tea in the public room, among the peasants (it was
market-day), when the arrival of three people, two men and a woman,
caused a sudden pause in the conversation.<br>
<br>
One of the men was a fat farmer in a long blouse, with a jovial,
red face, framed in white whiskers. The other was younger, was
dressed in corduroy and had lean, yellow, cross-grained features.
Each of them carried a gun slung over his shoulder. Between them
was a short, slender young woman, in a brown cloak and a fur cap,
whose rather thin and extremely pale face was surprisingly delicate
and distinguished-looking.</p>

<p>"'Father, son and daughter-in-law,' whispered my cousin.</p>

<p>"'What! Can that charming creature be the wife of that
clodhopper?'</p>

<p>"'And the daughter-in-law of Baron de Gorne.'</p>

<p>"'Is the old fellow over there a baron?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, descended from a very ancient, noble family which used to
own the château in the old days. He has always lived like a
peasant: a great hunter, a great drinker, a great litigant, always
at law with somebody, now very nearly ruined. His son Mathias was
more ambitious and less attached to the soil and studied for the
bar. Then he went to America. Next, the lack of money brought him
back to the village, whereupon he fell in love with a young girl in
the nearest town. The poor girl consented, no one knows why, to
marry him; and for five years past she has been leading the life of
a hermit, or rather of a prisoner, in a little manor-house close
by, the Manoir-au-Puits, the Well Manor.'</p>

<p>"'With the father and the son?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'No, the father lives at the far end of the village, on a
lonely farm.'</p>

<p>"'And is Master Mathias jealous?'</p>

<p>"'A perfect tiger!'</p>

<p>"'Without reason?'</p>

<p>"'Without reason, for Natalie de Gorne is the straightest woman
in the world and it is not her fault if a handsome young man has
been hanging around the manor-house for the past few months.
However, the de Gornes can't get over it.'</p>

<p>"'What, the father neither?'</p>

<p>"'The handsome young man is the last descendant of the people
who bought the château long ago. This explains old de Gorne's
hatred. Jérôme Vignal&mdash;I know him and am very fond of
him&mdash;is a good-looking fellow and very well off; and he has
sworn to run off with Natalie de Gorne. It's the old man who says
so, whenever he has had a drop too much. There, listen!'</p>

<p>"The old chap was sitting among a group of men who were amusing
themselves by making him drink and plying him with questions. He
was already a little bit 'on' and was holding forth with a tone of
indignation and a mocking smile which formed the most comic
contrast:</p>

<p>"'He's wasting his time, I tell you, the coxcomb! It's no manner
of use his poaching round our way and making sheep's-eyes at the
wench...The coverts are watched! If he comes too near, it means a
bullet, eh, Mathias?'</p>

<p>"He gripped his daughter-in-law's hand:</p>

<p>"'And then the little wench knows how to defend herself too,' he
chuckled. 'Eh, you don't want any admirers, do you Natalie?'</p>

<p>"The young wife blushed, in her confusion at being addressed in
these terms, while her husband growled:</p>

<p>"'You'd do better to hold your tongue, father. There are things
one doesn't talk about in public.'</p>

<p>"'Things that affect one's honour are best settled in public,'
retorted the old one. 'Where I'm concerned, the honour of the de
Gornes comes before everything; and that fine spark, with his Paris
airs, shan't...'</p>

<p>"He stopped short. Before him stood a man who had just come in
and who seemed to be waiting for him to finish his sentence. The
newcomer was a tall, powerfully-built young fellow, in riding-kit,
with a hunting-crop in his hand. His strong and rather stern face
was lighted up by a pair of fine eyes in which shone an ironical
smile.</p>

<p>"'Jérôme Vignal,' whispered my cousin.</p>

<p>"The young man seemed not at all embarrassed. On seeing Natalie,
he made a low bow; and, when Mathias de Gorne took a step forward,
he eyed him from head to foot, as though to say:</p>

<p>"'Well, what about it?'</p>

<p>"And his attitude was so haughty and contemptuous that the de
Gornes unslung their guns and took them in both hands, like
sportsmen about to shoot. The son's expression was very fierce.</p>

<p>"Jérôme was quite unmoved by the threat. After a few seconds,
turning to the innkeeper, he remarked:</p>

<p>"'Oh, I say! I came to see old Vasseur. But his shop is shut.
Would you mind giving him the holster of my revolver? It wants a
stitch or two.'</p>

<p>"He handed the holster to the innkeeper and added, laughing:</p>

<p>"'I'm keeping the revolver, in case I need it. You never can
tell!'</p>

<p>"Then, still very calmly, he took a cigarette from a silver
case, lit it and walked out. We saw him through the window vaulting
on his horse and riding off at a slow trot.</p>

<p>"Old de Gorne tossed off a glass of brandy, swearing most
horribly.</p>

<p>"His son clapped his hand to the old man's mouth and forced him
to sit down. Natalie de Gorne was weeping beside them...</p>

<p>"That's my story, dear friend. As you see, it's not tremendously
interesting and does not deserve your attention. There's no mystery
in it and no part for you to play. Indeed, I particularly insist
that you should not seek a pretext for any untimely interference.
Of course, I should be glad to see the poor thing protected: she
appears to be a perfect martyr. But, as I said before, let us leave
other people to get out of their own troubles and go no farther
with our little experiments..."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Rénine finished reading the letter, read it over again and ended
by saying:</p>

<p>"That's it. Everything's right as right can be. She doesn't want
to continue our little experiments, because this would make the
seventh and because she's afraid of the eighth, which under the
terms of our agreement has a very particular significance. She
doesn't want to...and she does want to...without seeming to want
to."</p>

<p>He rubbed his hands. The letter was an invaluable witness to the
influence which he had gradually, gently and patiently gained over
Hortense Daniel. It betrayed a rather complex feeling, composed of
admiration, unbounded confidence, uneasiness at times, fear and
almost terror, but also love: he was convinced of that. His
companion in adventures which she shared with a good fellowship
that excluded any awkwardness between them, she had suddenly taken
fright; and a sort of modesty, mingled with a certain coquetry; was
impelling her to hold back.</p>

<p>That very evening, Sunday, Rénine took the train.</p>

<p>And, at break of day, after covering by diligence, on a road
white with snow, the five miles between the little town of
Pompignat, where he alighted, and the village of Bassicourt, he
learnt that his journey might prove of some use: three shots had
been heard during the night in the direction of the
Manoir-au-Puits.</p>

<p>"Three shots, sergeant. I heard them as plainly as I see you
standing before me," said a peasant whom the gendarmes were
questioning in the parlour of the inn which Rénine had entered.</p>

<p>"So did I," said the waiter. "Three shots. It may have been
twelve o'clock at night. The snow, which had been falling since
nine, had stopped...and the shots sounded across the fields, one
after the other: bang, bang, bang."</p>

<p>Five more peasants gave their evidence. The sergeant and his men
had heard nothing, because the police-station backed on the fields.
But a farm-labourer and a woman arrived, who said that they were in
Mathias de Gorne's service, that they had been away for two days
because of the intervening Sunday and that they had come straight
from the manor-house, where they were unable to obtain
admission:</p>

<p>"The gate of the grounds is locked, sergeant," said the man.
"It's the first time I've known this to happen. M. Mathias comes
out to open it himself, every morning at the stroke of six, winter
and summer. Well, it's past eight now. I called and shouted. Nobody
answered. So we came on here."</p>

<p>"You might have enquired at old M. de Gorne's," said the
sergeant. "He lives on the highroad."</p>

<p>"On my word, so I might! I never thought of that."</p>

<p>"We'd better go there now," the sergeant decided. Two of his men
went with him, as well as the peasants and a locksmith whose
services were called into requisition. Rénine joined the party.</p>

<p>Soon, at the end of the village, they reached old de Gorne's
farmyard, which Rénine recognized by Hortense's description of its
position.</p>

<p>The old fellow was harnessing his horse and trap. When they told
him what had happened, he burst out laughing:</p>

<p>"Three shots? Bang, bang, bang? Why, my dear sergeant, there are
only two barrels to Mathias' gun!"</p>

<p>"What about the locked gate?"</p>

<p>"It means that the lad's asleep, that's all. Last night, he came
and cracked a bottle with me...perhaps two...or even three; and
he'll be sleeping it off, I expect...he and Natalie."</p>

<p>He climbed on to the box of his trap&mdash;an old cart with a
patched tilt&mdash;and cracked his whip:</p>

<p>"Goodbye, gentlemen all. Those three shots of yours won't stop
me from going to market at Pompignat, as I do every Monday. I've a
couple of calves under the tilt; and they're just fit for the
butcher. Good day to you!"</p>

<p>The others walked on. Rénine went up to the sergeant and gave
him his name:</p>

<p>"I'm a friend of Mlle. Ermelin, of La Roncière; and, as it's too
early to call on her yet, I shall be glad if you'll allow me to go
round by the manor with you. Mlle. Ermelin knows Madame de Gorne;
and it will be a satisfaction to me to relieve her mind, for
there's nothing wrong at the manor-house, I hope?"</p>

<p>"If there is," replied the sergeant, "we shall read all about it
as plainly as on a map, because of the snow."</p>

<p>He was a likable young man and seemed smart and intelligent.
From the very first he had shown great acuteness in observing the
tracks which Mathias had left behind him, the evening before, on
returning home, tracks which soon became confused with the
footprints made in going and coming by the farm-labourer and the
woman. Meanwhile they came to the walls of a property of which the
locksmith readily opened the gate.</p>

<p>From here onward, a single trail appeared upon the spotless
snow, that of Mathias; and it was easy to perceive that the son
must have shared largely in the father's libations, as the line of
footprints described sudden curves which made it swerve right up to
the trees of the avenue.</p>

<p>Two hundred yards farther stood the dilapidated two-storeyed
building of the Manoir-au-Puits. The principal door was open.</p>

<p>"Let's go in," said the sergeant.</p>

<p>And, the moment he had crossed the threshold, he muttered:</p>

<p>"Oho! Old de Gorne made a mistake in not coming. They've been
fighting in here."</p>

<p>The big room was in disorder. Two shattered chairs, the
overturned table and much broken glass and china bore witness to
the violence of the struggle. The tall clock, lying on the ground,
had stopped at twenty past eleven.</p>

<p>With the farm-girl showing them the way, they ran up to the
first floor. Neither Mathias nor his wife was there. But the door
of their bedroom had been broken down with a hammer which they
discovered under the bed.</p>

<p>Rénine and the sergeant went downstairs again. The living-room
had a passage communicating with the kitchen, which lay at the back
of the house and opened on a small yard fenced off from the
orchard. At the end of this enclosure was a well near which one was
bound to pass.</p>

<p>Now, from the door of the kitchen to the well, the snow, which
was not very thick, had been pressed down to this side and that, as
though a body had been dragged over it. And all around the well
were tangled traces of trampling feet, showing that the struggle
must have been resumed at this spot. The sergeant again discovered
Mathias' footprints, together with others which were shapelier and
lighter.</p>

<p>These latter went straight into the orchard, by themselves. And,
thirty yards on, near the footprints, a revolver was picked up and
recognized by one of the peasants as resembling that which Jérôme
Vignal had produced in the inn two days before.</p>

<p>The sergeant examined the cylinder. Three of the seven bullets
had been fired.</p>

<p>And so the tragedy was little by little reconstructed in its
main outlines; and the sergeant, who had ordered everybody to stand
aside and not to step on the site of the footprints, came back to
the well, leant over, put a few questions to the farm-girl and,
going up to Rénine, whispered:</p>

<p>"It all seems fairly clear to me."</p>

<p>Rénine took his arm:</p>

<p>"Let's speak out plainly, sergeant. I understand the business
pretty well, for, as I told you, I know Mlle. Ermelin, who is a
friend of Jérôme Vignal's and also knows Madame de Gorne. Do you
suppose...?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to suppose anything. I simply declare that someone
came there last night..."</p>

<p>"By which way? The only tracks of a person coming towards the
manor are those of M. de Gorne."</p>

<p>"That's because the other person arrived before the snowfall,
that is to say, before nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"Then he must have hidden in a corner of the living-room and
waited for the return of M. de Gorne, who came after the snow?"</p>

<p>"Just so. As soon as Mathias came in, the man went for him.
There was a fight. Mathias made his escape through the kitchen. The
man ran after him to the well and fired three revolver-shots."</p>

<p>"And where's the body?"</p>

<p>"Down the well."</p>

<p>Rénine protested:</p>

<p>"Oh, I say! Aren't you taking a lot for granted?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, the snow's there, to tell the story; and the snow
plainly says that, after the struggle, after the three shots, one
man alone walked away and left the farm, one man only, and his
footprints are not those of Mathias de Gorne. Then where can
Mathias de Gorne be?"</p>

<p>"But the well...can be dragged?"</p>

<p>"No. The well is practically bottomless. It is known all over
the district and gives its name to the manor."</p>

<p>"So you really believe...?"</p>

<p>"I repeat what I said. Before the snowfall, a single arrival,
Mathias, and a single departure, the stranger."</p>

<p>"And Madame de Gorne? Was she too killed and thrown down the
well like her husband?"</p>

<p>"No, carried off."</p>

<p>"Carried off?"</p>

<p>"Remember that her bedroom was broken down with a hammer."</p>

<p>"Come, come, sergeant! You yourself declare that there was only
one departure, the stranger's."</p>

<p>"Stoop down. Look at the man's footprints. See how they sink
into the snow, until they actually touch the ground. Those are the
footprints of a man, laden with a heavy burden. The stranger was
carrying Madame de Gorne on his shoulder."</p>

<p>"Then there's an outlet this way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a little door of which Mathias de Gorne always had the key
on him. The man must have taken it from him."</p>

<p>"A way out into the open fields?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a road which joins the departmental highway three quarters
of a mile from here...And do you know where?"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At the corner of the château."</p>

<p>"Jérôme Vignal's château?"</p>

<p>"By Jove, this is beginning to look serious! If the trail leads
to the château and stops there, we shall know where we stand."</p>

<p>The trail did continue to the château, as they were able to
perceive after following it across the undulating fields, on which
the snow lay heaped in places. The approach to the main gates had
been swept, but they saw that another trail, formed by the two
wheels of a vehicle, was running in the opposite direction to the
village.</p>

<p>The sergeant rang the bell. The porter, who had also been
sweeping the drive, came to the gates, with a broom in his hand. In
answer to a question, the man said that M. Vignal had gone away
that morning before anyone else was up and that he himself had
harnessed the horse to the trap.</p>

<p>"In that case," said Rénine, when they had moved away, "all we
have to do is to follow the tracks of the wheels."</p>

<p>"That will be no use," said the sergeant. "They have taken the
railway."</p>

<p>"At Pompignat station, where I came from? But they would have
passed through the village."</p>

<p>"They have gone just the other way, because it leads to the
town, where the express trains stop. The procurator-general has an
office in the town. I'll telephone; and, as there's no train before
eleven o'clock, all that they need do is to keep a watch at the
station."</p>

<p>"I think you're doing the right thing, sergeant," said Rénine,
"and I congratulate you on the way in which you have carried out
your investigation."</p>

<p>They parted. Rénine went back to the inn in the village and sent
a note to Hortense Daniel by hand:</p>

<p class="letter">My very dear friend,<br>
<br>
I seemed to gather from your letter that, touched as always by
anything that concerns the heart, you were anxious to protect the
love-affair of Jérôme and Natalie. Now there is every reason to
suppose that these two, without consulting their fair protectress,
have run away, after throwing Mathias de Gorne down a well.<br>
<br>
Forgive me for not coming to see you. The whole thing is extremely
obscure; and, if I were with you, I should not have the detachment
of mind which is needed to think the case over.</p>

<p>It was then half-past ten. Rénine went for a walk into the
country, with his hands clasped behind his back and without
vouchsafing a glance at the exquisite spectacle of the white
meadows. He came back for lunch, still absorbed in his thoughts and
indifferent to the talk of the customers of the inn, who on all
sides were discussing recent events.</p>

<p>He went up to his room and had been asleep some time when he was
awakened by a tapping at the door. He got up and opened it:</p>

<p>"Is it you?...Is it you?" he whispered.</p>

<p>Hortense and he stood gazing at each other for some seconds in
silence, holding each other's hands, as though nothing, no
irrelevant thought and no utterance, must be allowed to interfere
with the joy of their meeting. Then he asked:</p>

<p>"Was I right in coming?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, gently, "I expected you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would have been better if you had sent for me
sooner, instead of waiting...Events did not wait, you see, and I
don't quite know what's to become of Jérôme Vignal and Natalie de
Gorne."</p>

<p>"What, haven't you heard?" she said, quickly. "They've been
arrested. They were going to travel by the express."</p>

<p>"Arrested? No." Rénine objected. "People are not arrested like
that. They have to be questioned first."</p>

<p>"That's what's being done now. The authorities are making a
search."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At the château. And, as they are innocent...For they are
innocent, aren't they? You don't admit that they are guilty, any
more than I do?"</p>

<p>He replied:</p>

<p>"I admit nothing, I can admit nothing, my dear. Nevertheless, I
am bound to say that everything is against them...except one fact,
which is that everything is too much against them. It is not normal
for so many proofs to be heaped up one on top of the other and for
the man who commits a murder to tell his story so frankly. Apart
from this, there's nothing but mystery and discrepancy."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, I am greatly puzzled."</p>

<p>"But you have a plan?"</p>

<p>"None at all, so far. Ah, if I could see him, Jérôme Vignal, and
her, Natalie de Gorne, and hear them and know what they are saying
in their own defence! But you can understand that I shan't be
permitted either to ask them any questions or to be present at
their examination. Besides, it must be finished by this time."</p>

<p>"It's finished at the château," she said, "but it's going to be
continued at the manor-house."</p>

<p>"Are they taking them to the manor-house?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes...at least, judging by what was said to the chauffeur of
one of the procurator's two cars."</p>

<p>"Oh, in that case," exclaimed Rénine, "the thing's done! The
manor-house! Why, we shall be in the front row of the stalls! We
shall see and hear everything; and, as a word, a tone of the voice,
a quiver of the eyelids will be enough to give me the tiny clue I
need, we may entertain some hope. Come along."</p>

<p>He took her by the direct route which he had followed that
morning, leading to the gate which the locksmith had opened. The
gendarmes on duty at the manor-house had made a passage through the
snow, beside the line of footprints and around the house. Chance
enabled Rénine and Hortense to approach unseen and through a
side-window to enter a corridor near a back-staircase. A few steps
up was a little chamber which received its only light through a
sort of bull's-eye, from the large room on the ground-floor.
Rénine, during the morning visit, had noticed the bull's-eye, which
was covered on the inside with a piece of cloth. He removed the
cloth and cut out one of the panes.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, a sound of voices rose from the other side
of the house, no doubt near the well. The sound grew more distinct.
A number of people flocked into the house. Some of them went
upstairs to the first floor, while the sergeant arrived with a
young man of whom Rénine and Hortense were able to distinguish only
the tall figure:</p>

<p>"Jérôme Vignal," said she.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rénine. "They are examining Madame de Gorne first,
upstairs, in her bedroom."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour passed. Then the persons on the first floor
came downstairs and went in. They were the procurator's deputy, his
clerk, a commissary of police and two detectives.</p>

<p>Madame de Gorne was shown in and the deputy asked Jérôme Vignal
to step forward.</p>

<p>Jérôme Vignal's face was certainly that of the strong man whom
Hortense had depicted in her letter. He displayed no uneasiness,
but rather decision and a resolute will. Natalie, who was short and
very slight, with a feverish light in her eyes, nevertheless
produced the same impression of quiet confidence.</p>

<p>The deputy, who was examining the disordered furniture and the
traces of the struggle, invited her to sit down and said to
Jérôme:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I have not asked you many questions so far. This is a
summary enquiry which I am conducting in your presence and which
will be continued later by the examining-magistrate; and I wished
above all to explain to you the very serious reasons for which I
asked you to interrupt your journey and to come back here with
Madame de Gorne. You are now in a position to refute the truly
distressing charges that are hanging over you. I therefore ask you
to tell me the exact truth."</p>

<p>"Mr. Deputy," replied Jérôme, "the charges in question trouble
me very little. The truth for which you are asking will defeat all
the lies which chance has accumulated against me. It is this."</p>

<p>He reflected for an instant and then, in clear, frank tones,
said:</p>

<p>"I love Madame de Gorne. The first time I met her, I conceived
the greatest sympathy and admiration for her. But my affection has
always been directed by the sole thought of her happiness. I love
her, but I respect her even more. Madame de Gorne must have told
you and I tell you again that she and I exchanged our first few
words last night."</p>

<p>He continued, in a lower voice:</p>

<p>"I respect her the more inasmuch as she is exceedingly unhappy.
All the world knows that every minute of her life was a martyrdom.
Her husband persecuted her with ferocious hatred and frantic
jealousy. Ask the servants. They will tell you of the long
suffering of Natalie de Gorne, of the blows which she received and
the insults which she had to endure. I tried to stop this torture
by restoring to the rights of appeal which the merest stranger may
claim when unhappiness and injustice pass a certain limit. I went
three times to old de Gorne and begged him to interfere; but I
found in him an almost equal hatred towards his daughter-in-law,
the hatred which many people feel for anything beautiful and noble.
At last I resolved on direct action and last night I took a step
with regard to Mathias de Gorne which was...a little unusual, I
admit, but which seemed likely to succeed, considering the man's
character. I swear, Mr. Deputy, that I had no other intention than
to talk to Mathias de Gorne. Knowing certain particulars of his
life which enabled me to bring effective pressure to bear upon him,
I wished to make use of this advantage in order to achieve my
purpose. If things turned out differently, I am not wholly to
blame...So I went there a little before nine o'clock. The servants,
I knew, were out. He opened the door himself. He was alone."</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said the deputy, interrupting him, "you are saying
something&mdash;as Madame de Gorne, for that matter, did just
now&mdash;which is manifestly opposed to the truth. Mathias de
Gorne did not come home last night until eleven o'clock. We have
two definite proofs of this: his father's evidence and the prints
of his feet in the snow, which fell from a quarter past nine
o'clock to eleven."</p>

<p>"Mr. Deputy," Jérôme Vignal declared, without heeding the bad
effect which his obstinacy was producing, "I am relating things as
they were and not as they may be interpreted. But to continue. That
clock marked ten minutes to nine when I entered this room. M. de
Gorne, believing that he was about to be attacked, had taken down
his gun. I placed my revolver on the table, out of reach of my
hand, and sat down: 'I want to speak to you, monsieur,' I said.
'Please listen to me.' He did not stir and did not utter a single
syllable. So I spoke. And straightway, crudely, without any
previous explanations which might have softened the bluntness of my
proposal, I spoke the few words which I had prepared beforehand: 'I
have spent some months, monsieur,' I said, 'in making careful
enquiries into your financial position. You have mortgaged every
foot of your land. You have signed bills which will shortly be
falling due and which it will be absolutely impossible for you to
honour. You have nothing to hope for from your father, whose own
affairs are in a very bad condition. So you are ruined. I have come
to save you.'...He watched me, still without speaking, and sat
down, which I took to mean that my suggestion was not entirely
displeasing. Then I took a sheaf of banknotes from my pocket,
placed it before him and continued: 'Here is sixty thousand francs,
monsieur. I will buy the Manoir-au-Puits, its lands and
dependencies and take over the mortgages. The sum named is exactly
twice what they are worth.'...I saw his eyes glittering. He asked
my conditions. 'Only one,' I said, 'that you go to America.'... Mr.
Deputy, we sat discussing for two hours. It was not that my offer
roused his indignation&mdash;I should not have risked it if I had
not known with whom I was dealing&mdash;but he wanted more and
haggled greedily, though he refrained from mentioning the name of
Madame de Gorne, to whom I myself had not once alluded. We might
have been two men engaged in a dispute and seeking an agreement on
common ground, whereas it was the happiness and the whole destiny
of a woman that were at stake. At last, weary of the discussion, I
accepted a compromise and we came to terms, which I resolved to
make definite then and there. Two letters were exchanged between
us: one in which he made the Manoir-au-Puits over to me for the sum
which I had paid him; and one, which he pocketed immediately, by
which I was to send him as much more in America on the day on which
the decree of divorce was pronounced...So the affair was settled. I
am sure that at that moment he was accepting in good faith. He
looked upon me less as an enemy and a rival than as a man who was
doing him a service. He even went so far as to give me the key of
the little door which opens on the fields, so that I might go home
by the shortcut. Unfortunately, while I was picking up my cap and
greatcoat, I made the mistake of leaving on the table the letter of
sale which he had signed. In a moment, Mathias de Gorne had seen
the advantage which he could take of my slip: he could keep his
property, keep his wife...and keep the money. Quick as lightning,
he tucked away the paper, hit me over the head with the butt-end of
his gun, threw the gun on the floor and seized me by the throat
with both hands. He had reckoned without his host. I was the
stronger of the two; and after a sharp but short struggle, I
mastered him and tied him up with a cord which I found lying in a
corner... Mr. Deputy, if my enemy's resolve was sudden, mine was no
less so. Since, when all was said, he had accepted the bargain, I
would force him to keep it, at least in so far as I was interested.
A very few steps brought me to the first floor...I had not a doubt
that Madame de Gorne was there and had heard the sound of our
discussion. Switching on the light of my pocket-torch, I looked
into three bedrooms. The fourth was locked. I knocked at the door.
There was no reply. But this was one of the moments in which a man
allows no obstacle to stand in his way. I had seen a hammer in one
of the rooms. I picked it up and smashed in the door...Yes, Natalie
was lying there, on the floor, in a dead faint. I took her in my
arms, carried her downstairs and went through the kitchen. On
seeing the snow outside, I at once realized that my footprints
would be easily traced. But what did it matter? Was there any
reason why I should put Mathias de Gorne off the scent? Not at all.
With the sixty thousand francs in his possession, as well as the
paper in which I undertook to pay him a like sum on the day of his
divorce, to say nothing of his house and land, he would go away,
leaving Natalie de Gorne to me. Nothing was changed between us,
except one thing: instead of awaiting his good pleasure, I had at
once seized the precious pledge which I coveted. What I feared,
therefore, was not so much any subsequent attack on the part of
Mathias de Gorne, but rather the indignant reproaches of his wife.
What would she say when she realized that she was a prisoner in my
hands?...The reasons why I escaped reproach Madame de Gorne has, I
believe, had the frankness to tell you. Love calls forth love. That
night, in my house, broken by emotion, she confessed her feeling
for me. She loved me as I loved her. Our destinies were henceforth
mingled. She and I set out at five o'clock this morning...not
foreseeing for an instant that we were amenable to the law."</p>

<p>Jérôme Vignal's story was finished. He had told it straight off
the reel, like a story learnt by heart and incapable of revision in
any detail.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, during which Hortense whispered:</p>

<p>"It all sounds quite possible and, in any case, very
logical."</p>

<p>"There are the objections to come," said Rénine. "Wait till you
hear them. They are very serious. There's one in particular..."</p>

<p>The deputy-procurator stated it at once:</p>

<p>"And what became of M. de Gorne in all this?"</p>

<p>"Mathias de Gorne?" asked Jérôme.</p>

<p>"Yes. You have related, with an accent of great sincerity, a
series of facts which I am quite willing to admit. Unfortunately,
you have forgotten a point of the first importance: what became of
Mathias de Gorne? You tied him up here, in this room. Well, this
morning he was gone."</p>

<p>"Of course, Mr. Deputy, Mathias de Gorne accepted the bargain in
the end and went away."</p>

<p>"By what road?"</p>

<p>"No doubt by the road that leads to his father's house."</p>

<p>"Where are his footprints? The expanse of snow is an impartial
witness. After your fight with him, we see you, on the snow, moving
away. Why don't we see him? He came and did not go away again.
Where is he? There is not a trace of him...or rather..."</p>

<p>The deputy lowered his voice:</p>

<p>"Or rather, yes, there are some traces on the way to the well
and around the well...traces which prove that the last struggle of
all took place there...And after that there is nothing...not a
thing..."</p>

<p>Jérôme shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>"You have already mentioned this, Mr. Deputy, and it implies a
charge of homicide against me. I have nothing to say to it."</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say to the fact that your revolver was
picked up within fifteen yards of the well?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Or to the strange coincidence between the three shots heard in
the night and the three cartridges missing from your revolver?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Deputy, there was not, as you believe, a last struggle
by the well, because I left M. de Gorne tied up, in this room, and
because I also left my revolver here. On the other hand, if shots
were heard, they were not fired by me."</p>

<p>"A casual coincidence, therefore?"</p>

<p>"That's a matter for the police to explain. My only duty is to
tell the truth and you are not entitled to ask more of me."</p>

<p>"And if that truth conflicts with the facts observed?"</p>

<p>"It means that the facts are wrong, Mr. Deputy."</p>

<p>"As you please. But, until the day when the police are able to
make them agree with your statements, you will understand that I am
obliged to keep you under arrest."</p>

<p>"And Madame de Gorne?" asked Jérôme, greatly distressed.</p>

<p>The deputy did not reply. He exchanged a few words with the
commissary of police and then, beckoning to a detective, ordered
him to bring up one of the two motorcars. Then he turned to
Natalie:</p>

<p>"Madame, you have heard M. Vignal's evidence. It agrees word for
word with your own. M. Vignal declares in particular that you had
fainted when he carried you away. But did you remain unconscious
all the way?"</p>

<p>It seemed as though Jérôme's composure had increased Madame de
Gorne's assurance. She replied:</p>

<p>"I did not come to, monsieur, until I was at the château."</p>

<p>"It's most extraordinary. Didn't you hear the three shots which
were heard by almost everyone in the village?"</p>

<p>"I did not."</p>

<p>"And did you see nothing of what happened beside the well?"</p>

<p>"Nothing did happen. M. Vignal has told you so."</p>

<p>"Then what has become of your husband?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Come, madame, you really must assist the officers of the law
and at least tell us what you think. Do you believe that there may
have been an accident and that possibly M. de Gorne, who had been
to see his father and had more to drink than usual, lost his
balance and fell into the well?"</p>

<p>"When my husband came back from seeing his father, he was not in
the least intoxicated."</p>

<p>"His father, however, has stated that he was. His father and he
had drunk two or three bottles of wine."</p>

<p>"His father is not telling the truth."</p>

<p>"But the snow tells the truth, madame," said the deputy,
irritably. "And the line of his footprints wavers from side to
side."</p>

<p>"My husband came in at half-past-eight, monsieur, before the
snow had begun to fall."</p>

<p>The deputy struck the table with his fist:</p>

<p>"But, really, madame, you're going right against the
evidence!...That sheet of snow cannot speak false!...I may accept
your denial of matters that cannot be verified. But these
footprints in the snow...in the snow..."</p>

<p>He controlled himself.</p>

<p>The motorcar drew up outside the windows. Forming a sudden
resolve, he said to Natalie:</p>

<p>"You will be good enough to hold yourself at the disposal of the
authorities, madame, and to remain here, in the manor-house..."</p>

<p>And he made a sign to the sergeant to remove Jérôme Vignal in
the car.</p>

<p>The game was lost for the two lovers. Barely united, they had to
separate and to fight, far away from each other, against the most
grievous accusations.</p>

<p>Jérôme took a step towards Natalie. They exchanged a long,
sorrowful look. Then he bowed to her and walked to the door, in the
wake of the sergeant of gendarmes.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried a voice. "Sergeant, right about...turn!...Jérôme
Vignal, stay where you are!"</p>

<p>The ruffled deputy raised his head, as did the other people
present. The voice came from the ceiling. The bulls-eye window had
opened and Rénine, leaning through it, was waving his arms:</p>

<p>"I wish to be heard!...I have several remarks to
make...especially in respect of the zigzag footprints!...It all
lies in that!...Mathias had not been drinking!..."</p>

<p>He had turned round and put his two legs through the opening,
saying to Hortense, who tried to prevent him:</p>

<p>"Don't move...No one will disturb you."</p>

<p>And, releasing his hold, he dropped into the room.</p>

<p>The deputy appeared dumbfounded:</p>

<p>"But, really, monsieur, who are you? Where do you come
from?"</p>

<p>Rénine brushed the dust from his clothes and replied:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Deputy. I ought to have come the same way as
everybody else. But I was in a hurry. Besides, if I had come in by
the door instead of falling from the ceiling, my words would not
have made the same impression."</p>

<p>The infuriated deputy advanced to meet him:</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Prince Rénine. I was with the sergeant this morning when he was
pursuing his investigations, wasn't I, sergeant? Since then I have
been hunting about for information. That's why, wishing to be
present at the hearing, I found a corner in a little private
room..."</p>

<p>"You were there? You had the audacity?..."</p>

<p>"One must needs be audacious, when the truth's at stake. If I
had not been there, I should not have discovered just the one
little clue which I missed. I should not have known that Mathias de
Gorne was not the least bit drunk. Now that's the key to the
riddle. When we know that, we know the solution."</p>

<p>The deputy found himself in a rather ridiculous position. Since
he had failed to take the necessary precautions to ensure the
secrecy of his enquiry, it was difficult for him to take any steps
against this interloper. He growled:</p>

<p>"Let's have done with this. What are you asking?"</p>

<p>"A few minutes of your kind attention."</p>

<p>"And with what object?"</p>

<p>"To establish the innocence of M. Vignal and Madame de
Gorne."</p>

<p>He was wearing that calm air, that sort of indifferent look
which was peculiar to him in moments of actions when the crisis of
the drama depended solely upon himself. Hortense felt a thrill pass
through her and at once became full of confidence:</p>

<p>"They're saved," she thought, with sudden emotion. "I asked him
to protect that young creature; and he is saving her from prison
and despair."</p>

<p>Jérôme and Natalie must have experienced the same impression of
sudden hope, for they had drawn nearer to each other, as though
this stranger, descended from the clouds, had already given them
the right to clasp hands.</p>

<p>The deputy shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>"The prosecution will have every means, when the time comes, of
establishing their innocence for itself. You will be called."</p>

<p>"It would be better to establish it here and now. Any delay
might lead to grievous consequences."</p>

<p>"I happen to be in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Two or three minutes will do."</p>

<p>"Two or three minutes to explain a case like this!"</p>

<p>"No longer, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Are you as certain of it as all that?"</p>

<p>"I am now. I have been thinking hard since this morning."</p>

<p>The deputy realized that this was one of those gentry who stick
to you like a leech and that there was nothing for it but to
submit. In a rather bantering tone, he asked:</p>

<p>"Does your thinking enable you to tell us the exact spot where
M. Mathias de Gorne is at this moment?"</p>

<p>Rénine took out his watch and answered:</p>

<p>"In Paris, Mr. Deputy."</p>

<p>"In Paris? Alive then?"</p>

<p>"Alive and, what is more, in the pink of health."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear it. But then what's the meaning of the
footprints around the well and the presence of that revolver and
those three shots?"</p>

<p>"Simply camouflage."</p>

<p>"Oh, really? Camouflage contrived by whom?"</p>

<p>"By Mathias de Gorne himself."</p>

<p>"That's curious! And with what object?"</p>

<p>"With the object of passing himself off for dead and of
arranging subsequent matters in such a way that M. Vignal was bound
to be accused of the death, the murder."</p>

<p>"An ingenious theory," the deputy agreed, still in a satirical
tone. "What do you think of it, M. Vignal?"</p>

<p>"It is a theory which flashed through my own mind. Mr. Deputy,"
replied Jérôme. "It is quite likely that, after our struggle and
after I had gone, Mathias de Gorne conceived a new plan by which,
this time, his hatred would be fully gratified. He both loved and
detested his wife. He held me in the greatest loathing. This must
be his revenge."</p>

<p>"His revenge would cost him dear, considering that, according to
your statement, Mathias de Gorne was to receive a second sum of
sixty thousand francs from you."</p>

<p>"He would receive that sum in another quarter, Mr. Deputy. My
examination of the financial position of the de Gorne family
revealed to me the fact that the father and son had taken out a
life-insurance policy in each other's favour. With the son dead, or
passing for dead, the father would receive the insurance-money and
indemnify his son."</p>

<p>"You mean to say," asked the deputy, with a smile, "that in all
this camouflage, as you call it, M. de Gorne the elder would act as
his son's accomplice?"</p>

<p>Rénine took up the challenge:</p>

<p>"Just so, Mr. Deputy. The father and son are accomplices."</p>

<p>"Then we shall find the son at the father's?"</p>

<p>"You would have found him there last night."</p>

<p>"What became of him?"</p>

<p>"He took the train at Pompignat."</p>

<p>"That's a mere supposition."</p>

<p>"No, a certainty."</p>

<p>"A moral certainty, perhaps, but you'll admit there's not the
slightest proof."</p>

<p>The deputy did not wait for a reply. He considered that he had
displayed an excessive goodwill and that patience has its limits
and he put an end to the interview:</p>

<p>"Not the slightest proof," he repeated, taking up his hat. "And,
above all,...above all, there's nothing in what you've said that
can contradict in the very least the evidence of that relentless
witness, the snow. To go to his father, Mathias de Gorne must have
left this house. Which way did he go?"</p>

<p>"Hang it all, M. Vignal told you: by the road which leads from
here to his father's!"</p>

<p>"There are no tracks in the snow."</p>

<p>"Yes, there are."</p>

<p>"But they show him coming here and not going away from
here."</p>

<p>"It's the same thing."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is. There's more than one way of walking. One
doesn't always go ahead by following one's nose."</p>

<p>"In what other way can one go ahead?"</p>

<p>"By walking backwards, Mr. Deputy."</p>

<p>These few words, spoken very simply, but in a clear tone which
gave full value to every syllable, produced a profound silence.
Those present at once grasped their extreme significance and, by
adapting it to the actual happenings, perceived in a flash the
impenetrable truth, which suddenly appeared to be the most natural
thing in the world.</p>

<p>Rénine continued his argument. Stepping backwards in the
direction of the window, he said:</p>

<p>"If I want to get to that window, I can of course walk straight
up to it; but I can just as easily turn my back to it and walk that
way. In either case I reach my goal."</p>

<p>And he at once proceeded in a vigorous tone:</p>

<p>"Here's the gist of it all. At half-past eight, before the snow
fell, M. de Gorne comes home from his father's house. M. Vignal
arrives twenty minutes later. There is a long discussion and a
struggle, taking up three hours in all. It is then, after M. Vignal
has carried off Madame de Gorne and made his escape, that Mathias
de Gorne, foaming at the mouth, wild with rage, but suddenly seeing
his chance of taking the most terrible revenge, hits upon the
ingenious idea of using against his enemy the very snowfall upon
whose evidence you are now relying. He therefore plans his own
murder, or rather the appearance of his murder and of his fall to
the bottom of the well and makes off backwards, step by step, thus
recording his arrival instead of his departure on the white
page."</p>

<p>The deputy sneered no longer. This eccentric intruder suddenly
appeared to him in the light of a person worthy of attention, whom
it would not do to make fun of. He asked:</p>

<p>"And how could he have left his father's house?"</p>

<p>"In a trap, quite simply."</p>

<p>"Who drove it?"</p>

<p>"The father. This morning the sergeant and I saw the trap and
spoke to the father, who was going to market as usual. The son was
hidden under the tilt. He took the train at Pompignat and is in
Paris by now."</p>

<p>Rénine's explanation, as promised, had taken hardly five
minutes. He had based it solely on logic and the probabilities of
the case. And yet not a jot was left of the distressing mystery in
which they were floundering. The darkness was dispelled. The whole
truth appeared.</p>

<p>Madame de Gorne wept for joy and Jérôme Vignal thanked the good
genius who was changing the course of events with a stroke of his
magic wand.</p>

<p>"Shall we examine those footprints together, Mr. Deputy?" asked
Rénine. "Do you mind? The mistake which the sergeant and I made
this morning was to investigate only the footprints left by the
alleged murderer and to neglect Mathias de Gorne's. Why indeed
should they have attracted our attention? Yet it was precisely
there that the crux of the whole affair was to be found."</p>

<p>They stepped into the orchard and went to the well. It did not
need a long examination to observe that many of the footprints were
awkward, hesitating, too deeply sunk at the heel and toe and
differing from one another in the angle at which the feet were
turned.</p>

<p>"This clumsiness was unavoidable," said Rénine. "Mathias de
Gorne would have needed a regular apprenticeship before his
backward progress could have equalled his ordinary gait; and both
his father and he must have been aware of this, at least as regards
the zigzags which you see here since old de Gorne went out of his
way to tell the sergeant that his son had had too much drink." And
he added "Indeed it was the detection of this falsehood that
suddenly enlightened me. When Madame de Gorne stated that her
husband was not drunk, I thought of the footprints and guessed the
truth."</p>

<p>The deputy frankly accepted his part in the matter and began to
laugh:</p>

<p>"There's nothing left for it but to send detectives after the
bogus corpse."</p>

<p>"On what grounds, Mr. Deputy?" asked Rénine. "Mathias de Gorne
has committed no offence against the law. There's nothing criminal
in trampling the soil around a well, in shifting the position of a
revolver that doesn't belong to you, in firing three shots or in
walking backwards to one's father's house. What can we ask of him?
The sixty thousand francs? I presume that this is not M. Vignal's
intention and that he does not mean to bring a charge against
him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Jérôme.</p>

<p>"Well, what then? The insurance-policy in favour of the
survivor? But there would be no misdemeanour unless the father
claimed payment. And I should be greatly surprised if he
did...Hullo, here the old chap is! You'll soon know all about
it."</p>

<p>Old de Gorne was coming along, gesticulating as he walked. His
easygoing features were screwed up to express sorrow and anger.</p>

<p>"Where's my son?" he cried. "It seems the brute's killed
him!...My poor Mathias dead! Oh, that scoundrel of a Vignal!"</p>

<p>And he shook his fist at Jérôme.</p>

<p>The deputy said, bluntly:</p>

<p>"A word with you, M. de Gorne. Do you intend to claim your
rights under a certain insurance-policy?"</p>

<p>"Well, what do <i>you</i> think?" said the old man, off his
guard.</p>

<p>"The fact is...your son's not dead. People are even saying that
you were a partner in his little schemes and that you stuffed him
under the tilt of your trap and drove him to the station."</p>

<p>The old fellow spat on the ground, stretched out his hand as
though he were going to take a solemn oath, stood for an instant
without moving and then, suddenly, changing his mind and his
tactics with ingenuous cynicism, he relaxed his features, assumed a
conciliatory attitude and burst out laughing:</p>

<p>"That blackguard Mathias! So he tried to pass himself off as
dead? What a rascal! And he reckoned on me to collect the
insurance-money and send it to him? As if I should be capable of
such a low, dirty trick!...You don't know me, my boy!"</p>

<p>And, without waiting for more, shaking with merriment like a
jolly old fellow amused by a funny story, he took his departure,
not forgetting, however, to set his great hobnail boots on each of
the compromising footprints which his son had left behind him.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Later, when Rénine went back to the manor to let Hortense out,
he found that she had disappeared.</p>

<p>He called and asked for her at her cousin Ermelin's. Hortense
sent down word asking him to excuse her: she was feeling a little
tired and was lying down.</p>

<p>"Capital!" thought Rénine. "Capital! She avoids me, therefore
she loves me. The end is not far off."</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. At the Sign of Mercury</h2>

<p class="letter">To Madame Daniel,<br>
La Roncière,<br>
near Bassicourt.<br>
<br>
Paris 30 November<br>
<br>
My Dearest Friend&mdash;<br>
<br>
There has been no letter from you for a fortnight; so I don't
expect now to receive one for that troublesome date of the 5th of
December, which we fixed as the last day of our partnership. I
rather wish it would come, because you will then be released from a
contract which no longer seems to give you pleasure. To me the
seven battles which we fought and won together were a time of
endless delight and enthusiasm. I was living beside you. I was
conscious of all the good which that more active and stirring
existence was doing you. My happiness was so great that I dared not
speak of it to you or let you see anything of my secret feelings
except my desire to please you and my passionate devotion. Today
you have had enough of your brother in arms. Your will shall be
law.<br>
<br>
But, though I bow to your decree, may I remind you what it was that
I always believed our final adventure would be? May I repeat your
words, not one of which I have forgotten?<br>
<br>
'I demand,' you said, 'that you shall restore to me a small,
antique clasp, made of a cornelian set in a filigree mount. It came
to me from my mother; and everyone knew that it used to bring her
happiness and me too. Since the day when it vanished from my
jewel-case, I have had nothing but unhappiness. Restore it to me,
my good genius.'<br>
<br>
And, when I asked you when the clasp had disappeared, you answered,
with a laugh:<br>
<br>
'Seven years ago...or eight...or nine: I don't know exactly...I
don't know when...I don't know how...I know nothing about
it...'<br>
<br>
You were challenging me, were you not, and you set me that
condition because it was one which I could not fulfil?
Nevertheless, I promised and I should like to keep my promise. What
I have tried to do, in order to place life before you in a more
favourable light, would seem purposeless, if your confidence feels
the lack of this talisman to which you attach so great a value. We
must not laugh at these little superstitions. They are often the
mainspring of our best actions.<br>
<br>
Dear friend, if you had helped me, I should have achieved yet one
more victory. Alone and hard pushed by the proximity of the date, I
have failed, not however without placing things on such a footing
that the undertaking if you care to follow it up, has the greatest
chance of success.<br>
<br>
And you will follow it up, won't you? We have entered into a mutual
agreement which we are bound to honour. It behooves us, within a
fixed time, to inscribe in the book of our common life eight good
stories, to which we shall have brought energy, logic,
perseverance, some subtlety and occasionally a little heroism. This
is the eighth of them. It is for you to act so that it may be
written in its proper place on the 5th of December, before the
clock strikes eight in the evening.<br>
<br>
And, on that day, you will act as I shall now tell you.<br>
<br>
First of all&mdash;and above all, my dear, do not complain that my
instructions are fanciful: each of them is an indispensable
condition of success&mdash;first of all, cut in your cousin's
garden three slender lengths of rush. Plait them together and bind
up the two ends so as to make a rude switch, like a child's
whiplash.<br>
<br>
When you get to Paris, buy a long necklace of jet beads, cut into
facets, and shorten it so that it consists of seventy-five beads,
of almost equal size.<br>
<br>
Under your winter cloak, wear a blue woollen gown. On your head, a
toque with red leaves on it. Round your neck, a feather boa. No
gloves. No rings.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, take a cab along the left bank of the river to
the church of Saint-&Eacute;tienne-du-Mont. At four o'clock
exactly, there will be, near the holy-water basin, just inside the
church, an old woman dressed in black, saying her prayers on a
silver rosary. She will offer you holy water. Give her your
necklace. She will count the beads and hand it back to you. After
this, you will walk behind her, you will cross an arm of the Seine
and she will lead you, down a lonely street in the Ile Saint-Louis,
to a house which you will enter by yourself.<br>
<br>
On the ground-floor of this house, you will find a youngish man
with a very pasty complexion. Take off your cloak and then say to
him:<br>
<br>
'I have come to fetch my clasp.'<br>
<br>
Do not be astonished by his agitation or dismay. Keep calm in his
presence. If he questions you, if he wants to know your reason for
applying to him or what impels you to make that request, give him
no explanation. Your replies must be confined to these brief
formulas:<br>
<br>
'I have come to fetch what belongs to me. I don't know you, I don't
know your name; but I am obliged to come to you like this. I must
have my clasp returned to me. I must.'<br>
<br>
I honestly believe that, if you have the firmness not to swerve
from that attitude, whatever farce the man may play, you will be
completely successful. But the contest must be a short one and the
issue will depend solely on your confidence in yourself and your
certainty of success. It will be a sort of match in which you must
defeat your opponent in the first round. If you remain impassive,
you will win. If you show hesitation or uneasiness, you can do
nothing against him. He will escape you and regain the upper hand
after a first moment of distress; and the game will be lost in a
few minutes. There is no midway house between victory
or...defeat.<br>
<br>
In the latter event, you would be obliged&mdash;I beg you to pardon
me for saying so&mdash;again to accept my collaboration. I offer it
you in advance, my dear, and without any conditions, while stating
quite plainly that all that I have been able to do for you and all
that I may yet do gives me no other right than that of thanking you
and devoting myself more than ever to the woman who represents my
joy, my whole life.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Hortense, after reading the letter, folded it up and put it away
at the back of a drawer, saying, in a resolute voice:</p>

<p>"I shan't go."</p>

<p>To begin with, although she had formerly attached some slight
importance to this trinket, which she had regarded as a mascot, she
felt very little interest in it now that the period of her trials
was apparently at an end. She could not forget that figure eight,
which was the serial number of the next adventure. To launch
herself upon it meant taking up the interrupted chain, going back
to Rénine and giving him a pledge which, with his powers of
suggestion, he would know how to turn to account.</p>

<p>Two days before the 5th of December, she was still in the same
frame of mind. So she was on the morning of the 4th; but suddenly,
without even having to contend against preliminary subterfuges, she
ran out into the garden, cut three lengths of rush, plaited them as
she used to do in her childhood and at twelve o'clock had herself
driven to the station. She was uplifted by an eager curiosity. She
was unable to resist all the amusing and novel sensations which the
adventure, proposed by Rénine, promised her. It was really too
tempting. The jet necklace, the toque with the autumn leaves, the
old woman with the silver rosary: how could she resist their
mysterious appeal and how could she refuse this opportunity of
showing Rénine what she was capable of doing?</p>

<p>"And then, after all," she said to herself, laughing, "he's
summoning me to Paris. Now eight o'clock is dangerous to me at a
spot three hundred miles from Paris, in that old deserted Château
de Halingre, but nowhere else. The only clock that can strike the
threatening hour is down there, under lock and key, a
prisoner!"</p>

<p>She reached Paris that evening. On the morning of the 5th she
went out and bought a jet necklace, which she reduced to
seventy-five beads, put on a blue gown and a toque with red leaves
and, at four o'clock precisely, entered the church of
Saint-&Eacute;tienne-du-Mont.</p>

<p>Her heart was throbbing violently. This time she was alone; and
how acutely she now felt the strength of that support which, from
unreflecting fear rather than any reasonable motive, she had thrust
aside! She looked around her, almost hoping to see him. But there
was no one there...no one except an old lady in black, standing
beside the holy water basin.</p>

<p>Hortense went up to her. The old lady, who held a silver rosary
in her hands, offered her holy water and then began to count the
beads of the necklace which Hortense gave her.</p>

<p>She whispered:</p>

<p>"Seventy-five. That's right. Come."</p>

<p>Without another word, she toddled along under the light of the
street-lamps, crossed the Pont des Tournelles to the Ile
Saint-Louis and went down an empty street leading to a crossroads,
where she stopped in front of an old house with wrought-iron
balconies:</p>

<p>"Go in," she said.</p>

<p>And the old lady went away.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Hortense now saw a prosperous-looking shop which occupied almost
the whole of the ground-floor and whose windows, blazing with
electric light, displayed a huddled array of old furniture and
antiquities. She stood there for a few seconds, gazing at it
absently. A signboard bore the words "The Mercury," together with
the name of the owner of the shop, "Pancaldi." Higher up, on a
projecting cornice which ran on a level with the first floor, a
small niche sheltered a terra-cotta Mercury poised on one foot,
with wings to his sandals and the caduceus in his hand, who, as
Hortense noted, was leaning a little too far forward in the ardour
of his flight and ought logically to have lost his balance and
taken a header into the street.</p>

<p>"Now!" she said, under her breath.</p>

<p>She turned the handle of the door and walked in.</p>

<p>Despite the ringing of the bells actuated by the opening door,
no one came to meet her. The shop seemed to be empty. However, at
the extreme end there was a room at the back of the shop and after
that another, both crammed with furniture and knickknacks, many of
which looked very valuable. Hortense followed a narrow gangway
which twisted and turned between two walls built up of cupboards,
cabinets and console-tables, went up two steps and found herself in
the last room of all.</p>

<p>A man was sitting at a writing-desk and looking through some
account-books. Without turning his head, he said:</p>

<p>"I am at your service, madam...Please look round you..."</p>

<p>This room contained nothing but articles of a special character
which gave it the appearance of some alchemist's laboratory in the
middle ages: stuffed owls, skeletons, skulls, copper alembics,
astrolabes and all around, hanging on the walls, amulets of every
description, mainly hands of ivory or coral with two fingers
pointing to ward off ill-luck.</p>

<p>"Are you wanting anything in particular, madam?" asked M.
Pancaldi, closing his desk and rising from his chair.</p>

<p>"It's the man," thought Hortense.</p>

<p>He had in fact an uncommonly pasty complexion. A little forked
beard, flecked with grey, lengthened his face, which was surmounted
by a bald, pallid forehead, beneath which gleamed a pair of small,
prominent, restless, shifty eyes.</p>

<p>Hortense, who had not removed her veil or cloak, replied:</p>

<p>"I want a clasp."</p>

<p>"They're in this showcase," he said, leading the way to the
connecting room.</p>

<p>Hortense glanced over the glass case and said:</p>

<p>"No, no,...I don't see what I'm looking for. I don't want just
any clasp, but a clasp which I lost out of a jewel-case some years
ago and which I have to look for here."</p>

<p>She was astounded to see the commotion displayed on his
features. His eyes became haggard.</p>

<p>"Here?...I don't think you are in the least likely...What sort
of clasp is it?..."</p>

<p>"A cornelian, mounted in gold filigree...of the 1830
period."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," he stammered. "Why do you come to me?"</p>

<p>She now removed her veil and laid aside her cloak.</p>

<p>He stepped back, as though terrified by the sight of her, and
whispered:</p>

<p>"The blue gown!...The toque!...And&mdash;can I believe my
eyes&mdash;the jet necklace!..."</p>

<p>It was perhaps the whiplash formed of three rushes that excited
him most violently. He pointed his finger at it, began to stagger
where he stood and ended by beating the air with his arms, like a
drowning man, and fainting away in a chair.</p>

<p>Hortense did not move.</p>

<p>"Whatever farce he may play," Rénine had written, "have the
courage to remain impassive."</p>

<p>Perhaps he was not playing a farce. Nevertheless she forced
herself to be calm and indifferent.</p>

<p>This lasted for a minute or two, after which M. Pancaldi
recovered from his swoon, wiped away the perspiration streaming
down his forehead and, striving to control himself, resumed, in a
trembling voice:</p>

<p>"Why do you apply to me?"</p>

<p>"Because the clasp is in your possession."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" he said, without denying the accusation.
"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I know because it is so. Nobody has told me anything. I came
here positive that I should find my clasp and with the immovable
determination to take it away with me."</p>

<p>"But do you know me? Do you know my name?"</p>

<p>"I don't know you. I did not know your name before I read it
over your shop. To me you are simply the man who is going to give
me back what belongs to me."</p>

<p>He was greatly agitated. He kept on walking to and fro in a
small empty space surrounded by a circle of piled-up furniture, at
which he hit out idiotically, at the risk of bringing it down.</p>

<p>Hortense felt that she had the whip hand of him; and, profiting
by his confusion, she said, suddenly, in a commanding and
threatening tone:</p>

<p>"Where is the thing? You must give it back to me. I insist upon
it."</p>

<p>Pancaldi gave way to a moment of despair. He folded his hands
and mumbled a few words of entreaty. Then, defeated and suddenly
resigned, he said, more distinctly:</p>

<p>"You insist?..."</p>

<p>"I do. You must give it to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I must...I agree."</p>

<p>"Speak!" she ordered, more harshly still.</p>

<p>"Speak, no, but write: I will write my secret...And that will be
the end of me."</p>

<p>He turned to his desk and feverishly wrote a few lines on a
sheet of paper, which he put into an envelope and sealed it:</p>

<p>"See," he said, "here's my secret...It was my whole life..."</p>

<p>And, so saying, he suddenly pressed against his temple a
revolver which he had produced from under a pile of papers and
fired.</p>

<p>With a quick movement, Hortense struck up his arm. The bullet
struck the mirror of a cheval-glass. But Pancaldi collapsed and
began to groan, as though he were wounded.</p>

<p>Hortense made a great effort not to lose her composure:</p>

<p>"Rénine warned me," she reflected. "The man's a play-actor. He
has kept the envelope. He has kept his revolver, I won't be taken
in by him."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she realized that, despite his apparent calmness,
the attempt at suicide and the revolver-shot had completely
unnerved her. All her energies were dispersed, like the sticks of a
bundle whose string has been cut; and she had a painful impression
that the man, who was grovelling at her feet, was in reality slowly
getting the better of her.</p>

<p>She sat down, exhausted. As Rénine had foretold, the duel had
not lasted longer than a few minutes but it was she who had
succumbed, thanks to her feminine nerves and at the very moment
when she felt entitled to believe that she had won.</p>

<p>The man Pancaldi was fully aware of this; and, without troubling
to invent a transition, he ceased his jeremiads, leapt to his feet,
cut a sort of agile caper before Hortense' eyes and cried, in a
jeering tone:</p>

<p>"Now we are going to have a little chat; but it would be a
nuisance to be at the mercy of the first passing customer, wouldn't
it?"</p>

<p>He ran to the street-door, opened it and pulled down the iron
shutter which closed the shop. Then, still hopping and skipping, he
came back to Hortense:</p>

<p>"Oof! I really thought I was done for! One more effort, madam,
and you would have pulled it off. But then I'm such a simple chap!
It seemed to me that you had come from the back of beyond, as an
emissary of Providence, to call me to account; and, like a fool, I
was about to give the thing back...Ah, Mlle. Hortense&mdash;let me
call you so: I used to know you by that name&mdash;Mlle. Hortense,
what you lack, to use a vulgar expression, is gut."</p>

<p>He sat down beside her and, with a malicious look, said,
savagely:</p>

<p>"The time has come to speak out. Who contrived this business?
Not you; eh? It's not in your style. Then who?...I have always been
honest in my life, scrupulously honest...except once...in the
matter of that clasp. And, whereas I thought the story was buried
and forgotten, here it is suddenly raked up again. Why? That's what
I want to know."</p>

<p>Hortense was no longer even attempting to fight. He was bringing
to bear upon her all his virile strength, all his spite, all his
fears, all the threats expressed in his furious gestures and on his
features, which were both ridiculous and evil:</p>

<p>"Speak, I want to know. If I have a secret foe, let me defend
myself against him! Who is he? Who sent you here? Who urged you to
take action? Is it a rival incensed by my good luck, who wants in
his turn to benefit by the clasp? Speak, can't you, damn it
all...or, I swear by Heaven, I'll make you!..."</p>

<p>She had an idea that he was reaching out for his revolver and
stepped back, holding her arms before her, in the hope of
escaping.</p>

<p>They thus struggled against each other; and Hortense, who was
becoming more and more frightened, not so much of the attack as of
her assailant's distorted face, was beginning to scream, when
Pancaldi suddenly stood motionless, with his arms before him, his
fingers outstretched and his eyes staring above Hortense's
head:</p>

<p>"Who's there? How did you get in?" he asked, in a stifled
voice.</p>

<p>Hortense did not even need to turn round to feel assured that
Rénine was coming to her assistance and that it was his
inexplicable appearance that was causing the dealer such dismay. As
a matter of fact, a slender figure stole through a heap of easy
chairs and sofas: and Rénine came forward with a tranquil step.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" repeated Pancaldi. "Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"From up there," he said, very amiably, pointing to the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"From up there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, from the first floor. I have been the tenant of the floor
above this for the past three months. I heard a noise just now.
Someone was calling out for help. So I came down."</p>

<p>"But how did you get in here?"</p>

<p>"By the staircase."</p>

<p>"What staircase?"</p>

<p>"The iron staircase, at the end of the shop. The man who owned
it before you had a flat on my floor and used to go up and down by
that hidden staircase. You had the door shut off. I opened it."</p>

<p>"But by what right, sir? It amounts to breaking in."</p>

<p>"Breaking in is allowed, when there's a fellow-creature to be
rescued."</p>

<p>"Once more, who are you?"</p>

<p>"Prince Rénine...and a friend of this lady's," said Rénine,
bending over Hortense and kissing her hand.</p>

<p>Pancaldi seemed to be choking, and mumbled:</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand!...You instigated the plot...it was you who
sent the lady..."</p>

<p>"It was, M. Pancaldi, it was!"</p>

<p>"And what are your intentions?"</p>

<p>"My intentions are irreproachable. No violence. Simply a little
interview. When that is over, you will hand over what I in my turn
have come to fetch."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The clasp."</p>

<p>"That, never!" shouted the dealer.</p>

<p>"Don't say no. It's a foregone conclusion."</p>

<p>"No power on earth, sir, can compel me to do such a thing!"</p>

<p>"Shall we send for your wife? Madame Pancaldi will perhaps
realize the position better than you do."</p>

<p>The idea of no longer being alone with this unexpected adversary
seemed to appeal to Pancaldi. There was a bell on the table beside
him. He struck it three times.</p>

<p>"Capital!" exclaimed Rénine "You see, my dear, M. Pancaldi is
becoming quite amiable. Not a trace left of the devil broken loose
who was going for you just now. No, M. Pancaldi only has to find
himself dealing with a man to recover his qualities of courtesy and
kindness. A perfect sheep! Which does not mean that things will go
quite of themselves. Far from it! There's no more obstinate animal
than a sheep..."</p>

<p>Right at the end of the shop, between the dealer's writing-desk
and the winding staircase, a curtain was raised, admitting a woman
who was holding a door open. She might have been thirty years of
age. Very simply dressed, she looked, with the apron on her, more
like a cook than like the mistress of a household. But she had an
attractive face and a pleasing figure.</p>

<p>Hortense, who had followed Rénine, was surprised to recognize
her as a maid whom she had had in her service when a girl:</p>

<p>"What! Is that you, Lucienne? Are you Madame Pancaldi?"</p>

<p>The newcomer looked at her, recognized her also and seemed
embarrassed. Rénine said to her:</p>

<p>"Your husband and I need your assistance, Madame Pancaldi, to
settle a rather complicated matter a matter in which you played an
important part..."</p>

<p>She came forward without a word, obviously ill at ease, asking
her husband, who did not take his eyes off her:</p>

<p>"What is it?...What do they want with me?...What is he referring
to?"</p>

<p>"It's about the clasp!" Pancaldi whispered, under his
breath.</p>

<p>These few words were enough to make Madame Pancaldi realize to
the full the seriousness of her position. And she did not try to
keep her countenance or to retort with futile protests. She sank
into a chair, sighing:</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it!...I understand... Mlle. Hortense has found the
track...Oh, it's all up with us!"</p>

<p>There was a moment's respite. The struggle between the
adversaries had hardly begun, before the husband and wife adopted
the attitude of defeated persons whose only hope lay in the
victor's clemency. Staring motionless before her, Madame Pancaldi
began to cry. Rénine bent over her and said:</p>

<p>"Do you mind if we go over the case from the beginning? We shall
then see things more clearly; and I am sure that our interview will
lead to a perfectly natural solution...This is how things happened:
nine years ago, when you were lady's maid to Mlle. Hortense in the
country, you made the acquaintance of M. Pancaldi, who soon became
your lover. You were both of you Corsicans, in other words, you
came from a country where superstitions are very strong and where
questions of good and bad luck, the evil eye, and spells and charms
exert a profound influence over the lives of one and all. Now it
was said that your young mistress' clasp had always brought luck to
its owners. That was why, in a weak moment prompted by M. Pancaldi,
you stole the clasp. Six months afterwards, you became Madame
Pancaldi...That is your whole story, is it not, told in a few
sentences? The whole story of two people who would have remained
honest members of society, if they had been able to resist that
casual temptation?...I need not tell you how you both succeeded in
life and how, possessing the talisman, believing its powers and
trusting in yourselves, you rose to the first rank of antiquarians.
Today, well-off, owning this shop, 'The Mercury,' you attribute the
success of your undertakings to that clasp. To lose it would to
your eyes spell bankruptcy and poverty. Your whole life has been
centred upon it. It is your fetish. It is the little household god
who watches over you and guides your steps. It is there, somewhere,
hidden in this jungle; and no one of course would ever have
suspected anything&mdash;for I repeat, you are decent people, but
for this one lapse&mdash;if an accident had not led me to look into
your affairs."</p>

<p>Rénine paused and continued:</p>

<p>"That was two months ago, two months of minute investigations,
which presented no difficulty to me, because, having discovered
your trail, I hired the flat overhead and was able to use that
staircase...but, all the same, two months wasted to a certain
extent because I have not yet succeeded. And Heaven knows how I
have ransacked this shop of yours! There is not a piece of
furniture that I have left unsearched, not a plank in the floor
that I have not inspected. All to no purpose. Yes, there was one
thing, an incidental discovery. In a secret recess in your
writing-table, Pancaldi, I turned up a little account-book in which
you have set down your remorse, your uneasiness, your fear of
punishment and your dread of God's wrath...It was highly imprudent
of you, Pancaldi! People don't write such confessions! And, above
all, they don't leave them lying about! Be this as it may, I read
them and I noted one passage, which struck me as particularly
important and was of use to me in preparing my plan of campaign:
'Should she come to me, the woman whom I robbed, should she come to
me as I saw her in her garden, while Lucienne was taking the clasp;
should she appear to me wearing the blue gown and the toque of red
leaves, with the jet necklace and the whip of three plaited rushes
which she was carrying that day; should she appear to me thus and
say: 'I have come to claim my property,' then I shall understand
that her conduct is inspired from on high and that I must obey the
decree of Providence.' That is what is written in your book,
Pancaldi, and it explains the conduct of the lady whom you call
Mlle. Hortense. Acting on my instructions and in accordance with
the setting thought out by yourself, she came to you, from the back
of beyond, to use your own expression. A little more
self-possession on her part; and you know that she would have won
the day. Unfortunately, you are a wonderful actor; your sham
suicide put her out; and you understood that this was not a decree
of Providence, but simply an offensive on the part of your former
victim. I had no choice, therefore, but to intervene. Here I
am...And now let's finish the business. Pancaldi, that clasp!"</p>

<p>"No," said the dealer, who seemed to recover all his energy at
the very thought of restoring the clasp.</p>

<p>"And you, Madame Pancaldi."</p>

<p>"I don't know where it is," the wife declared.</p>

<p>"Very well. Then let us come to deeds. Madame Pancaldi, you have
a son of seven whom you love with all your heart. This is Thursday
and, as on every Thursday, your little boy is to come home alone
from his aunt's. Two of my friends are posted on the road by which
he returns and, in the absence of instructions to the contrary,
will kidnap him as he passes."</p>

<p>Madame Pancaldi lost her head at once:</p>

<p>"My son! Oh, please, please...not that!...I swear that I know
nothing. My husband would never consent to confide in me."</p>

<p>Rénine continued:</p>

<p>"Next point. This evening, I shall lodge an information with the
public prosecutor. Evidence: the confessions in the account-book.
Consequences: action by the police, search of the premises and the
rest."</p>

<p>Pancaldi was silent. The others had a feeling that all these
threats did not affect him and that, protected by his fetish, he
believed himself to be invulnerable. But his wife fell on her knees
at Rénine's feet and stammered:</p>

<p>"No, no...I entreat you!...It would mean going to prison and I
don't want to go!...And then my son!...Oh, I entreat you!..."</p>

<p>Hortense, seized with compassion, took Rénine to one side:</p>

<p>"Poor woman! Let me intercede for her."</p>

<p>"Set your mind at rest," he said. "Nothing is going to happen to
her son."</p>

<p>"But your two friends?"</p>

<p>"Sheer bluff."</p>

<p>"Your application to the public prosecutor?"</p>

<p>"A mere threat."</p>

<p>"Then what are you trying to do?"</p>

<p>"To frighten them out of their wits, in the hope of making them
drop a remark, a word, which will tell us what we want to know.
We've tried every other means. This is the last; and it is a method
which, I find, nearly always succeeds. Remember our
adventures."</p>

<p>"But if the word which you expect to hear is not spoken?"</p>

<p>"It must be spoken," said Rénine, in a low voice. "We must
finish the matter. The hour is at hand."</p>

<p>His eyes met hers; and she blushed crimson at the thought that
the hour to which he was alluding was the eighth and that he had no
other object than to finish the matter before that eighth hour
struck.</p>

<p>"So you see, on the one hand, what you are risking," he said to
the Pancaldi pair. "The disappearance of your child...and prison:
prison for certain, since there is the book with its confessions.
And now, on the other hand, here's my offer: twenty thousand francs
if you hand over the clasp immediately, this minute. Remember, it
isn't worth three louis."</p>

<p>No reply. Madame Pancaldi was crying.</p>

<p>Rénine resumed, pausing between each proposal:</p>

<p>"I'll double my offer...I'll treble it...Hang it all, Pancaldi,
you're unreasonable!...I suppose you want me to make it a round
sum? All right: a hundred thousand francs."</p>

<p>He held out his hand as if there was no doubt that they would
give him the clasp.</p>

<p>Madame Pancaldi was the first to yield and did so with a sudden
outburst of rage against her husband:</p>

<p>"Well, confess, can't you?...Speak up!...Where have you hidden
it?...Look here, you aren't going to be obstinate, what? If you
are, it means ruin...and poverty...And then there's our
boy!...Speak out, do!"</p>

<p>Hortense whispered:</p>

<p>"Rénine, this is madness; the clasp has no value..."</p>

<p>"Never fear," said Rénine, "he's not going to accept...But look
at him...How excited he is! Exactly what I wanted...Ah, this, you
know, is really exciting!...To make people lose their heads! To rob
them of all control over what they are thinking and saying!...And,
in the midst of this confusion, in the storm that tosses them to
and fro, to catch sight of the tiny spark which will flash forth
somewhere or other!...Look at him! Look at the fellow! A hundred
thousand francs for a valueless pebble...if not, prison: it's
enough to turn any man's head!"</p>

<p>Pancaldi, in fact, was grey in the face; his lips were trembling
and a drop of saliva was trickling from their corners. It was easy
to guess the seething turmoil of his whole being, shaken by
conflicting emotions, by the clash between greed and fear. Suddenly
he burst out; and it was obvious that his words were pouring forth
at random, without his knowing in the least what he was saying:</p>

<p>"A hundred thousand francs! Two hundred thousand! Five hundred
thousand! A million! A two fig for your millions! What's the use of
millions? One loses them. They disappear...They go...There's only
one thing that counts: luck. It's on your side or else against you.
And luck has been on my side these last nine years. It has never
betrayed me; and you expect me to betray it? Why? Out of fear?
Prison? My son? Bosh!...No harm will come to me so long as I compel
luck to work on my behalf. It's my servant, it's my friend. It
clings to the clasp. How? How can I tell? It's the cornelian, no
doubt...There are magic stones, which hold happiness, as others
hold fire, or sulphur, or gold..."</p>

<p>Rénine kept his eyes fixed upon him, watching for the least
word, the least modulation of the voice. The curiosity-dealer was
now laughing, with a nervous laugh, while resuming the self-control
of a man who feels sure of himself: and he walked up to Rénine with
jerky movements that revealed an increasing resolution:</p>

<p>"Millions? My dear sir, I wouldn't have them as a gift. The
little bit of stone which I possess is worth much more than that.
And the proof of it lies in all the pains which you are at to take
it from me. Aha! Months devoted to looking for it, as you yourself
confess! Months in which you turned everything topsy-turvy, while
I, who suspected nothing, did not even defend myself! Why should I?
The little thing defended itself all alone...It does not want to be
discovered and it shan't be...It likes being here...It presides
over a good, honest business that satisfies it...Pancaldi's luck!
Why, it's known to all the neighbourhood, among all the dealers! I
proclaim it from the housetops: 'I'm a lucky man!' I even made so
bold as to take the god of luck, Mercury, as my patron! He too
protects me. See, I've got Mercuries all over my shop! Look up
there, on that shelf, a whole row of statuettes, like the one over
the front-door, proofs signed by a great sculptor who went smash
and sold them to me...Would you like one, my dear sir? It will
bring you luck too. Take your pick! A present from Pancaldi, to
make up to you for your defeat! Does that suit you?"</p>

<p>He put a stool against the wall, under the shelf, took down a
statuette and plumped it into Rénine's arms. And, laughing
heartily, growing more and more excited as his enemy seemed to
yield ground and to fall back before his spirited attack, he
explained:</p>

<p>"Well done! He accepts! And the fact that he accepts shows that
we are all agreed! Madame Pancaldi, don't distress yourself. Your
son's coming back and nobody's going to prison! Goodbye, Mlle.
Hortense! Good day, sir! Hope to see you again! If you want to
speak to me at any time, just give three thumps on the ceiling.
Goodbye...don't forget your present...and may Mercury be kind to
you! Goodbye, my dear Prince! Goodbye, Mlle. Hortense!..."</p>

<p>He hustled them to the iron staircase, gripped each of them by
the arm in turn and pushed them up to the little door hidden at the
top of the stairs.</p>

<p>And the strange thing was that Rénine made no protest. He did
not attempt to resist. He allowed himself to be led along like a
naughty child that is taken up to bed.</p>

<p>Less than five minutes had elapsed between the moment when he
made his offer to Pancaldi and the moment when Pancaldi turned him
out of the shop with a statuette in his arms.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The dining-room and drawing-room of the flat which Rénine had
taken on the first floor looked out upon the street. The table in
the dining-room was laid for two.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, won't you?" said Rénine, as he opened the door of
the drawing-room for Hortense. "I thought that, whatever happened,
I should most likely see you this evening and that we might as well
dine together. Don't refuse me this kindness, which will be the
last favour granted in our last adventure."</p>

<p>Hortense did not refuse him. The manner in which the battle had
ended was so different from everything that she had seen hitherto
that she felt disconcerted. At any rate, why should she refuse,
seeing that the terms of the contract had not been fulfilled?</p>

<p>Rénine left the room to give an order to his manservant. Two
minutes later, he came back for Hortense. It was then a little past
seven.</p>

<p>There were flowers on the table; and the statue of Mercury,
Pancaldi's present, stood overtopping them.</p>

<p>"May the god of luck preside over our repast," said Rénine.</p>

<p>He was full of animation and expressed his great delight at
having her sitting opposite him:</p>

<p>"Yes," he exclaimed, "I had to resort to powerful means and
attract you by the bait of the most fabulous enterprises. You must
confess that my letter was jolly smart! The three rushes, the blue
gown; simply irresistible! And, when I had thrown in a few puzzles
of my own invention, such as the seventy-five beads of the necklace
and the old woman with the silver rosary, I knew that you were
bound to succumb to the temptation. Don't be angry with me. I
wanted to see you and I wanted it to be today. You have come and I
thank you."</p>

<p>He next told her how he had got on the track of the stolen
trinket:</p>

<p>"You hoped, didn't you, in laying down that condition, that I
shouldn't be able to fulfil it? You made a mistake, my dear. The
test, at least at the beginning, was easy enough, because it was
based upon an undoubted fact: the talismanic character attributed
to the clasp. I had only to hunt about and see whether among the
people around you, among your servants, there was ever anyone upon
whom that character may have exercised some attraction. Now, on the
list of persons which I succeeded in drawing up. I at once noticed
the name of Mlle. Lucienne, as coming from Corsica. This was my
starting-point. The rest was a mere concatenation of events."</p>

<p>Hortense stared at him in amazement. How was it that he was
accepting his defeat with such a careless air and even talking in a
tone of triumph, whereas really he had been soundly beaten by
Pancaldi and even made to look just a trifle ridiculous?</p>

<p>She could not help letting him feel this; and the fashion in
which she did so betrayed a certain disappointment, a certain
humiliation:</p>

<p>"Everything is a concatenation of events: very well. But the
chain is broken, because, when all is said, though you know the
thief, you did not succeed in laying hands upon the stolen
clasp."</p>

<p>The reproach was obvious. Rénine had not accustomed her to
failure. And furthermore she was irritated to see how heedlessly he
was accepting a blow which, after all, entailed the ruin of any
hopes that he might have entertained.</p>

<p>He did not reply. He had filled their two glasses with champagne
and was slowly emptying his own, with his eyes fixed on the
statuette of Mercury. He turned it about on its pedestal and
examined it with the eye of a delighted connoisseur:</p>

<p>"What a beautiful thing is a harmonious line! Colour does not
uplift me so much as outline, proportion, symmetry and all the
wonderful properties of form. Look at this little statue.
Pancaldi's right: it's the work of a great artist. The legs are
both slender and muscular; the whole figure gives an impression of
buoyancy and speed. It is very well done. There's only one fault, a
very slight one: perhaps you've not noticed it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," said Hortense. "It struck me the moment I saw the
sign, outside. You mean, don't you, a certain lack of balance? The
god is leaning over too far on the leg that carries him. He looks
as though he were going to pitch forward."</p>

<p>"That's very clever of you," said Rénine. "The fault is almost
imperceptible and it needs a trained eye to see it. Really,
however, as a matter of logic, the weight of the body ought to have
its way and, in accordance with natural laws, the little god ought
to take a header."</p>

<p>After a pause he continued:</p>

<p>"I noticed that flaw on the first day. How was it that I did not
draw an inference at once? I was shocked because the artist had
sinned against an aesthetic law, whereas I ought to have been
shocked because he had overlooked a physical law. As though art and
nature were not blended together! And as though the laws of gravity
could be disturbed without some fundamental reason!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Hortense, puzzled by these
reflections, which seemed so far removed from their secret
thoughts. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!" he said. "I am only surprised that I didn't
understand sooner why Mercury did not plump forward, as he should
have done."</p>

<p>"And what is the reason?"</p>

<p>"The reason? I imagine that Pancaldi, when pulling the statuette
about to make it serve his purpose, must have disturbed its
balance, but that this balance was restored by something which
holds the little god back and which makes up for his really too
dangerous posture."</p>

<p>"Something, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a counterweight."</p>

<p>Hortense gave a start. She too was beginning to see a little
light. She murmured:</p>

<p>"A counterweight?...Are you thinking that it might be...in the
pedestal?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Is that possible? But, if so, how did Pancaldi come to give you
this statuette?"</p>

<p>"He never gave me <i>this</i> one," Rénine declared. "I took
this one myself."</p>

<p>"But where? And when?"</p>

<p>"Just now, while you were in the drawing-room. I got out of that
window, which is just over the signboard and beside the niche
containing the little god. And I exchanged the two, that is to say,
I took the statue which was outside and put the one which Pancaldi
gave me in its place."</p>

<p>"But doesn't that one lean forward?"</p>

<p>"No, no more than the others do, on the shelf in his shop. But
Pancaldi is not an artist. A lack of equilibrium does not impress
him; he will see nothing wrong; and he will continue to think
himself favoured by luck, which is another way of saying that luck
will continue to favour him. Meanwhile, here's the statuette, the
one used for the sign. Am I to break the pedestal and take your
clasp out of the leaden sheath, soldered to the back of the
pedestal, which keeps Mercury steady?"</p>

<p>"No, no, there's no need for that," Hortense hurriedly
murmured.</p>

<p>Rénine's intuition, his subtlety, the skill with which he had
managed the whole business: to her, for the moment, all these
things remained in the background. But she suddenly remembered that
the eighth adventure was completed, that Rénine had surmounted
every obstacle, that the test had turned to his advantage and that
the extreme limit of time fixed for the last of the adventures was
not yet reached.</p>

<p>He had the cruelty to call attention to the fact:</p>

<p>"A quarter to eight," he said.</p>

<p>An oppressive silence fell between them. Both felt its
discomfort to such a degree that they hesitated to make the least
movement. In order to break it, Rénine jested:</p>

<p>"That worthy M. Pancaldi, how good it was of him to tell me what
I wished to know! I knew, however, that by exasperating him, I
should end by picking up the missing clue in what he said. It was
just as though one were to hand someone a flint and steel and
suggest to him that he was to use it. In the end, the spark is
obtained. In my case, what produced the spark was the unconscious
but inevitable comparison which he drew between the cornelian
clasp, the element of luck, and Mercury, the god of luck. That was
enough. I understood that this association of ideas arose from his
having actually associated the two factors of luck by embodying one
in the other, or, to speak more plainly, by hiding the trinket in
the statuette. And I at once remembered the Mercury outside the
door and its defective poise..."</p>

<p>Rénine suddenly interrupted himself. It seemed to him that all
his remarks were falling on deaf ears. Hortense had put her hand to
her forehead and, thus veiling her eyes, sat motionless and
remote.</p>

<p>She was indeed not listening. The end of this particular
adventure and the manner in which Rénine had acted on this occasion
no longer interested her. What she was thinking of was the complex
series of adventures amid which she had been living for the past
three months and the wonderful behaviour of the man who had offered
her his devotion. She saw, as in a magic picture, the fabulous
deeds performed by him, all the good that he had done, the lives
saved, the sorrows assuaged, the order restored wherever his
masterly will had been brought to bear. Nothing was impossible to
him. What he undertook to do he did. Every aim that he set before
him was attained in advance. And all this without excessive effort,
with the calmness of one who knows his own strength and knows that
nothing can resist it.</p>

<p>Then what could she do against him? Why should she defend
herself and how? If he demanded that she should yield, would he not
know how to make her do so and would this last adventure be any
more difficult for him than the others? Supposing that she ran
away: did the wide world contain a retreat in which she would be
safe from his pursuit? From the first moment of their first
meeting, the end was certain, since Rénine had decreed that it
should be so.</p>

<p>However, she still cast about for weapons, for protection of
some sort; and she said to herself that, though he had fulfilled
the eight conditions and restored the cornelian clasp to her before
the eighth hour had struck, she was nevertheless protected by the
fact that this eighth hour was to strike on the clock of the
Château de Halingre and not elsewhere. It was a formal compact.
Rénine had said that day, gazing on the lips which he longed to
kiss:</p>

<p>"The old brass pendulum will start swinging again; and, when, on
the fixed date, the clock once more strikes eight, then..."</p>

<p>She looked up. He was not moving either, but sat solemnly,
patiently waiting.</p>

<p>She was on the point of saying, she was even preparing her
words:</p>

<p>"You know, our agreement says it must be the Halingre clock. All
the other conditions have been fulfilled...but not this one. So I
am free, am I not? I am entitled not to keep my promise, which,
moreover, I never made, but which in any case falls to the
ground?...And I am perfectly free...released from any scruple of
conscience?..."</p>

<p>She had not time to speak. At that precise moment, there was a
click behind her, like that of a clock about to strike.</p>

<p>A first stroke sounded, then a second, then a third.</p>

<p>Hortense moaned. She had recognized the very sound of the old
clock, the Halingre clock, which three months ago, by breaking in a
supernatural manner the silence of the deserted château, had set
both of them on the road of the eight adventures.</p>

<p>She counted the strokes. The clock struck eight.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she murmured, half swooning and hiding her face in her
hands. "The clock...the clock is here...the one from over there...I
recognize its voice..."</p>

<p>She said no more. She felt that Rénine had his eyes fixed upon
her and this sapped all her energies. Besides, had she been able to
recover them, she would have been no better off nor sought to offer
him the least resistance, for the reason that she did not wish to
resist. All the adventures were over, but one remained to be
undertaken, the anticipation of which wiped out the memory of all
the rest. It was the adventure of love, the most delightful, the
most bewildering, the most adorable of all adventures. She accepted
fate's decree, rejoicing in all that might come, because she was in
love. She smiled in spite of herself, as she reflected that
happiness was again to enter her life at the very moment when her
well-beloved was bringing her the cornelian clasp.</p>

<p>The clock struck the hour for the second time.</p>

<p>Hortense raised her eyes to Rénine. She struggled a few seconds
longer. But she was like a charmed bird, incapable of any movement
of revolt; and at the eighth stroke she fell upon his breast and
offered him her lips...</p>
