</p>

<p>Carnegie was the fourth son of the Earl of Suffolk, England.
After education as an engineer, David Carnegie worked on tea
plantations in Ceylon, but joined the rush to Coolgardie when gold
was discovered in Western Australia in 1892. Over a period of five
years he prospected, and led several important exploring
expeditions into some of Australia's most arid areas. After leaving
Australia, Canegie was appointed Assistant Resident in Nigeria
where, at the age of twenty-nine, he died as a result of a wound
inflicted by a poison arrow. At the time he was involved in
attempting to stop a native uprising.</p>

<p>In &quot;Spinifex and Sand&quot; Carnegie has this to say:<br>
<br>
&quot;Think of us, picture us, ye city magnates, toiling and
struggling that your capacious pockets may be filled by the fruits
of our labour: think of us, I say, and remember that our
experiences are but as those of many more, and that hardly a mine,
out of which you have made all the profit, has been found without
similar hardships and battles for life! Not a penny would you have
made from the wealth of West Australia but for us prospectors--and
what do we get for our pains? A share in the bare sale of the mine
if lucky; if not, God help us! for nothing but curses and
complaints will be our portion. The natural rejoinder to this is,
&quot;Why, then, do you go?&quot; To which I can only answer that
one must make a living somehow, and that some like to make money
hard, and some to make it easily. Perhaps I belong to the former
class.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Spinifex and Sand&quot; is not a dry, daily journal but a
remarkable account of discovery and survival in a most inhospitable
part of the world.</p>
