      <p><b>METHODS OF CURING MEAT.</b> The two most common methods of curing
        meat are first the brine or sugar cure process and second the dry-curing
        process. For general farm use the brine cured process is the better. It
        requires less time, less effort and not such an exacting place for the
        work. On most farms it is impossible to secure a desirable place in which
        to do the dry-curing as the meat is exposed to rats, cats, flies and other
        insects. The dry-curing requires considerable time to rub and salt the
        meat at different times while the only attention that is necessary for
        brine-curing is to properly prepare and pack the meat in the vessel and
        prepare the brine for it.</p>

      <p>The precaution of coming to table with clean hands was inculcated perhaps
        first as a necessity, when neither forks nor knives were used, and subsequently
        as a mark of breeding. The knife preceded the spoon, and the fork, which
        had been introduced into Italy in the eleventh century, and which strikes
        one as a fortuitous development of the Oriental chopstick, came last.
        It was not in general use even in the seventeenth century here. Coryat
        the traveller saw it among the Italians, and deemed it a luxury and a
        notable fact.</p>

      <p> <b>WHAT THE PURCHASER LOOKS FOR</b>--It has been amply proved that women
        are not especially interested in fine points of design unless that interest

        the work; and that its purchase will save them money, time or labor, perhaps
        all three. Let the appliance itself impress them with the strength of

        <b>POTATO CHIPS</b>--To fry potatoes successfully, two things must be
        carefully attended to. First of all dry the potatoes thoroughly, and then
        have very hot fat. Peel the potatoes and dry them in a cloth. Cut into
        any shape--slices, strips, quarters, &amp;c.--and dry again. Have a good
        quantity of very hot fat ready, put the chips into a frying basket, and
        plunge into the fat. Fry quickly, and directly they are brown enough they
        are done. Throw them on to some kitchen paper to drain off the fat. Pile
        high on a dish, sprinkle with salt, and serve very hot.</p>

      <p><b>Eggs, Hard-boiled</b>--Place the eggs in cold water, bring the water
        to boiling point, and let them boil for ten minutes; if the hard-boiled
        eggs are wanted hot, put them in cold water for half a minute, in order
        that you may remove the shells without burning your fingers. If the eggs
        are required cold, it is best not to remove the shells till just before
        they are wanted; but if they have to be served cold, similar to what we
        meet with at railway refreshment-rooms, let them be served cold, whole.
        If you cut a hard-boiled egg the yolk very soon gets discoloured and brown
        round the edge, shrivels up, and becomes most unappetising in appearance.</p>
