<h2><a name="fourthfield" id="fourthfield">FOURTH FIELD
AMBULANCE</a>
</h2>

<p>Shortly after the outbreak of War&mdash;after the first
contingent had been mobilised, and while they were undergoing
training&mdash;it became evident that it would be necessary to
raise another force to proceed on the heels of the first. Three
Infantry Brigades with their Ambulances had already been formed;
orders for a fourth were now issued, and naturally the Ambulance
would be designated Fourth Field Ambulance.</p>

<p>The Fourth Brigade was composed of the 13th Battalion (N.S.W.),
14th (Victoria), 15th (Queensland) and 16th (Western
Australia)&mdash;commanded respectively by Lieutenant-Colonel
Burnage, Lieutenant-Colonel Courtnay, Lieutenant-Colonel Cannon and
Lieutenant-Colonel Pope. The Brigade was in charge of Colonel
Monash, V.D., with Lieutenant-Colonel McGlinn as his Brigade
Major.</p>

<p>As it will be necessary from time to time to allude to the
component parts of the Ambulance, it may be as well to describe how
an ambulance is made up. It is composed of three sections, known as
A, B, and C, the total of all ranks being 254 on a war strength. It
is subdivided into Bearer, Tent and Transport Divisions. Each
section has its own officers, and is capable of acting
independently. Where there is an extended front, it is frequently
desirable to detach sections and send them to positions where the
work is heaviest.</p>

<p>As the name implies, the Bearers convey the wounded to the
dressing station (or Field Hospital, as the case may be). Those in
the Tent Division dress the cases and perform nursing duties, while
the Transport Division undertakes their conveyance to Base
Hospital.</p>

<p>It was decided to recruit the Fourth Field Ambulance from three
States, A Section from Victoria, B from South Australia, C from
Western Australia. Recruiting started in Broadmeadows, Victoria, on
the 19th October, 1914, and thirty men enrolled from New South
Wales were included in A Section. Towards the end of November B
Section from South Australia joined us, and participated in the
training. On the 22nd December we embarked on a transport forming
one of a convoy of eighteen ships. The nineteenth ship
&mdash;&mdash; joined after we left Albany.</p>

<p>Details from the Ambulance were supplied to different ships and
the officers distributed among the fleet. Our last port in
Australia was Albany, which was cleared on the last day of
1914&mdash;a beautiful night and clear day, with the sea as smooth
as the proverbial glass.</p>

<h2><a name="voyage" id="voyage">THE VOYAGE</a>
</h2>

<p>The convoy was under the command of Captain Brewis&mdash;a most
capable and courteous officer, but a strict disciplinarian. To a
landsman, his control of the various ships and his forethought in
obtaining supplies seemed little short of marvellous. I had the
good fortune to be associated with Captain Brewis on the passage
from Colombo to Alexandria on board the &mdash;&mdash; and his
friendship is a pleasant memory.</p>

<p>The fleet was arranged in three lines, each ship being about
three lengths astern of the one ahead. The sight was most
inspiriting, and made one feel proud of the privilege of
participation. The &mdash;&mdash; towed the submarine AE2, and kept
clear of the convoy, sometimes ahead, then astern, so that we
viewed the convoy from all points.</p>

<p>The day after leaving Albany a steamer, which proved to be the
&mdash;&mdash;, joined us with C Section of our Ambulance. Signals
were made for the &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; to move ahead and
the &mdash;&mdash; to drop astern, the &mdash;&mdash; moving into
the vacant place. The manoeuvre was carried out in a most
seamanlike manner, and Captain Young of the &mdash;&mdash; received
many compliments on his performance.</p>

<p>Three days later a message was flagged from the &mdash;&mdash;
that Major Stewart (who commanded the C Section of the Ambulance)
was ill with enteric, and that his condition was serious. The
flagship then sent orders (also by flag) "Colonel Beeston will
proceed to &mdash;&mdash; and will remain there until next port.
&mdash;&mdash; to provide transport." A boat was hoisted out, and
Sergeant Draper as a nurse, Walkley my orderly, my little dog Paddy
and I were lowered from the boat deck. What appeared smooth water
proved to a long undulating swell; no water was shipped, but the
fleet at times was not visible when the boat was in the trough of
the sea.</p>

<p>However, the &mdash;&mdash; was manoeuvred so as to form a
shelter, and we gained the deck by means of the companion ladder as
comfortably as if we had been in harbour. Major Stewart's illness
proved to be of such a nature that his disembarkation at Colombo
was imperative, and on our arrival there he was left in the
hospital.</p>

<p>The heat in the tropics was very oppressive, and the horses
suffered considerably. One day all the ships carrying horses were
turned about and steamed for twenty minutes in the opposite
direction in order to obtain a breath of air for the poor animals.
In the holds the temperature was 90&deg; and steamy at that. The
sight of horses down a ship's hold is a novel one. Each is in a
stall of such dimensions that the animal cannot be knocked about.
All heads are inwards, and each horse has his own trough. At a
certain time in the day lucerne hay is issued. This is the signal
for a prodigious amount of stamping and noise on the part of the
animals. They throw their heads about, snort and neigh, and seem as
if they would jump over the barriers in their frantic effort to get
a good feed. Horses on land are nice beasts, but on board ship they
are a totally different proposition. One intelligent neddy stabled
just outside my cabin spent the night in stamping on an adjacent
steam pipe; consequently my sleep was of a disturbed nature, and
not so restful as one might look for on a sea voyage. When he
became tired, the brute on the opposite side took up the refrain,
so that it seemed like Morse signalling on a large scale.</p>

<p>We reached Colombo on the 13th January, and found a number of
ships of various nationalities in the harbour. Our convoy almost
filled it. We were soon surrounded by boats offering for sale all
sorts of things, mostly edibles. Of course no one was allowed on
board.</p>

<p>After arranging for Major Stewart's accommodation at the
hospital, we transferred from the &mdash;&mdash; to the
&mdash;&mdash;. The voyage was resumed on the 15th. When a few days
out, one of the ships flagged that there were two cases of
appendicitis on board. The convoy was stopped; the ship drew near
ours, and lowered a boat with the two cases, which was soon
alongside. Meanwhile a large box which had been made by our
carpenter was lowered over the side by a winch on the boat deck;
the cases were placed in it and hoisted aboard, where the
stretcher-bearers conveyed them to the hospital. Examination showed
that operation was necessary in both cases, and the necessary
preparations were made.</p>

<p>The day was a glorious one&mdash;not a cloud in the sky, and the
sea almost oily in its smoothness. As the hospital was full of
cases of measles, it was decided to operate on deck a little aft of
the hospital. A guard was placed to keep inquisitive onlookers at a
distance, and the two operations were carried out successfully. It
was a novel experience to operate under these conditions. When one
looked up from the work, instead of the usual tiled walls of a
hospital theatre, one saw nothing but the sea and the transports.
After all, they were ideal conditions; for the air was absolutely
pure and free from any kind of germ.</p>

<p>While the convoy was stopped, the opportunity was taken to
transfer Lieutenant-Colonel Bean from the &mdash;&mdash; to the
&mdash;&mdash;. There had been a number of fatal cases on board the
latter vessel, and it was deemed advisable to place a senior
officer on board.</p>

<p>On arrival at Aden I had personal experience of the worth of the
Red Cross Society. A number of cases had died aboard one of the
transports, and I had to go over to investigate. The sea was fairly
rough, the boat rising and falling ten or twelve feet. For a
landsman to gain a ladder on a ship's side under these conditions
is not a thing of undiluted joy. Anyhow I missed the ladder and
went into the water. The first fear one had was that the boat would
drop on one's head; however, I was hauled on board by two hefty
sailors. The inspection finished, we were rowed back to our own
ship, wet and cold. By the time "home" was reached I felt pretty
chilly; a hot bath soon put me right, and a dressing gown was dug
out of the Red Cross goods supplied to the ship, in which I
remained while my clothes were drying. Sewn inside was a card on
which was printed: "Will the recipient kindly write his personal
experiences to George W. Parker, Daylesford, Victoria, Australia."
I wrote to Mr. Parker from Suez. I would recommend everyone sending
articles of this kind to put a similar notice inside. To be able to
acknowledge kindness is as gratifying to the recipient as the
knowledge of its usefulness is to the giver.</p>

<p>The voyage to Suez (which was reached on the 28th January) was
uneventful. We arrived there about 4 in the morning and found most
of our convoy around us when we got on deck at daylight. Here we
got news of the Turks' attack on the Canal. We heard that there had
been a brush with the Turks, in which Australians had participated,
and all the ships were to be sandbagged round the bridge. Bags of
flour were used on the &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The submarine cast off from the &mdash;&mdash; outside and came
alongside our ship. I was invited to go and inspect her, and Paddy
accompanied me. On going below, however, I left him on the deck,
and by some means he slipped overboard (this appears to run in the
family on this trip); one of the crew fished him out, and he was
sent up on to the &mdash;&mdash;. When I got back I found Colonel
Monash, the Brigadier, running up and down the deck with the dog so
that he would not catch cold! The Colonel was almost as fond of the
dog as I was.</p>

<h2><a name="egypt" id="egypt">EGYPT</a>
</h2>

<p>All along the canal we saw troops entrenched&mdash;chiefly
Indians. This at the time was very novel&mdash;we little knew then
how familiar trenches would become. At various points&mdash;about
every four or five miles-a warship was passed. The troops on each
ship stood to attention and the bugler blew the general salute.
Port Said was reached in the afternoon, and here a great calamity
overtook me. Paddy was lost! He was seen going ashore in the boat
which took the mails. Though orders were out against any one's
leaving the ship, Colonel Monash offered me permission to go and
look for him. With Sergeant Nickson and Walkley I started off and
tramped through all sorts of slums and places, without any success.
Finally we returned to the water front, where one of the natives (a
little more intelligent than the others) took me to the Custom
House close by. One of the officials could speak a little English,
and in response to my enquiry he turned up a large book. Then I
saw, among a lot of Egyptian writing, PADDY 4 A.M.C. MORMON. This
corresponded to his identity disc, which was round his neck. He was
out at the abattoirs, where after a three-mile drive we obtained
him. His return to the ship was hailed by the men with vociferous
cheers.</p>

<p>On arrival at Alexandria we made arrangements for the
disembarkation of all our sick, Lieutenant-Colonel Beach
superintending their transport. We left soon after by rail for
Heilwan, arriving after nightfall. A guide was detailed to conduct
us to camp, and we set out to march a couple of miles across the
desert. It was quite cold, so that the march was rather good; but,
loaded as we were, in full marching order and soft after a long sea
voyage, it was a stiff tramp. In the pitch dark, as silent as the
grave, we stumbled along, and finally arrived at the camp outside
Heliopolis, a place known as the Aerodrome.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Sutherland and Major Helsham were camped with
their Ambulance close by, and with most kindly forethought had
pitched our tents for us. We just lay down in our greatcoats and
slept until morning. Our Brigade was camped just across the road,
and formed part of the New Zealand and Australian Division under
General Sir Alexander Godley.</p>

<p>Training soon began, and everyone seemed full of the idea of
making himself "fit." Our peace camps and continuous training at
home look very puny and small in comparison with the work which now
occupied our time. At manoeuvres the number of troops might be
anything up to thirty thousand. To march in the rear of such a
column meant that each of the Ambulances soon swallowed its peck of
dirt. But with it all we were healthy and vigorous. As an Ambulance
we practiced all sorts of movements. Under supposition that we
might have to retreat suddenly, the whole camp would be struck,
packed on the waggon and taken down the Suez road, where it was
pitched again, ready to receive patients; then tents would be
struck and a return made to camp. Or we would make a start after
nightfall and practise the movements without lights; the transport
handling the horses in the dark. Or the different sections would
march out independently, and concentrate on a point agreed upon. It
was great practice, but in the end not necessary; for we went, not
to France, as we expected, but to Gallipoli, where we had no
horses. However, it taught the men to believe in themselves. That
period of training was great. Everyone benefited, and by the
beginning of April we felt fit for anything.</p>

<p>We were exceedingly well looked after in the way of a standing
camp. Sand of course was everywhere, but when watered it became
quite hard, and the quadrangle made a fine drill ground. Each unit
had a mess house in which the men had their meals; there was an
abundant supply of water obtained from the Nile, so that shower
baths were plentiful. Canteens were established, and the men were
able to supplement their rations. The Y.M.C.A. erected buildings
for the men's entertainment, which served an excellent purpose in
keeping the troops in camp. Cinematographs showed pictures, and all
round the camp dealers established shops, so that there was very
little inducement for men to leave at night. A good deal of our
time was occupied in weeding out undesirables from the Brigade.
Thank goodness, I had not to send a man from the Ambulance back for
this reason.</p>

<p>Apart from the instructive side of our stay in Egypt, the
sojourn was most educational. We were camped just on the edge of
the Land of Goshen; the place where Joseph obtained his wife was
only about a mile away from my tent, and the well where the Virgin
Mother rested with our Saviour was in close proximity. The same
water wheels are here as are mentioned in the Bible, and one can
see the camels and asses brought to water, and the women going to
and fro with pitchers on their heads. Then in the museum in Cairo
one could see the mummy of the Pharaoh of Joseph's time. All this
made the Bible quite the most interesting book to read.</p>

<p>The troops having undergone pretty strenuous training, we were
inspected by Sir Ian Hamilton, who was to command us in the
forthcoming campaign. Then, early in April, the commanding officers
of units were assembled at Headquarters and the different ships
allotted. Finally, on the evening of the 11th April, our camp was
struck, and; we bade good-bye to Heliopolis. The waggons were
packed and the Ambulance moved off, marching to the Railway Station
in Cairo. Nine-thirty was the time fixed for our entraining, and we
were there on the minute&mdash;and it was as well that such was the
case, for General Williams stood at the gate to watch
proceedings.</p>

<p>The waggons with four horses (drivers mounted, of course) were
taken at a trot up an incline, through a narrow gateway on to the
platform. The horses were then taken out and to the rear, and the
waggons placed on the trucks by Egyptian porters.</p>

<p>We had 16 vehicles, 69 horses, 10 officers and 245 men. The
whole were entrained in 35 minutes. The General was very pleased
with the performance, and asked me to convey his approbation to the
men. Certainly they did well.</p>

<h2><a name="gallipoli" id="gallipoli">TO GALLIPOLI</a>
</h2>

<p>At midnight we left Cairo and arrived at daybreak at Alexandria,
the train running right on to the wharf, alongside which was the
transport to convey us to Gallipoli&mdash;the Dardanelles we called
it then. Loading started almost immediately, and I found that
I&mdash;who in ordinary life am a peaceful citizen and a surgeon by
profession&mdash;had to direct operations by which our waggons were
to be removed from the railway trucks on to the wharf and thence to
the ship's hold. Men with some knowledge of the mysteries of steam
winches had to be specially selected and instructed in these
duties, and I&mdash;well, beyond at times watching a ship being
loaded at Newcastle, I was as innocent of their details as the
unborn babe. However, everyone went at it, and the transport was
loaded soon after dinner. We had the New Zealand Battery of
Artillery, Battery Ammunition Column, 14th Battalion Transport and
Army Service Corps with us, the whole numbering 560 men and 480
horses. At 4 p.m. the ship cast off, and we went to the outer
harbour and began to shake down. The same hour the next day saw us
under weigh for the front. The voyage was quite uneventful, the sea
beautifully calm, and the various islands in the Egean Sea most
picturesque. Three days later we arrived at Lemnos, and found the
harbour (which is of considerable size) packed with warships and
transports. I counted 20 warships of various sizes and
nationalities. The <i>Agamemnon</i> was just opposite us, showing
signs of the damage she had received in the bombardment of the
Turkish forts a couple of months before. We stayed here a week, and
every day practised going ashore in boats, each man in full
marching order leaving the ship by the pilot ladder.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how one adapts oneself to circumstances. For
years it has been almost painful to me to look down from a height;
as for going down a ladder, in ordinary times I could not do it.
However, here there was no help for it; a commanding officer cannot
order his men to do what he will not do himself, so up and down we
went in full marching order. Bearer work was carried out among the
stony hills which surround the harbour.</p>

<p>Finally, on the 24th April, the whole armada got under weigh,
headed by the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, or as the men affectionately
termed her, "Lizzie." We had been under steam for only about four
hours when a case of smallpox was reported on board. As the captain
informed me he had time to spare, we returned to Lemnor and landed
the man, afterwards proceeding on our journey. At night the ship
was darkened. Our ship carried eight horse-boats, which were to be
used by the 29th Division in their landing at Cape Helles.</p>

<p>Just about dawn on Sunday the 25th I came on deck and could see
the forms of a number of warships in close proximity to us, with
destroyers here and there and numbers of transports. Suddenly one
ship fired a gun, and then they were all at it, the Turks replying
in quick time from the forts on Seddul Bahr, as well as from those
on the Asiatic side. None of our ships appeared to be hit, but
great clouds of dust were thrown up in the forts opposite us.
Meanwhile destroyers were passing us loaded with troops, and barges
filled with grim and determined-looking men were being towed
towards the shore. One could not help wondering how many of them
would be alive in an hour's time. Slowly they neared the cliffs; as
the first barge appeared to ground, a burst of fire broke out along
the beach, alternately rifles and machine guns. The men leaped out
of the barges&mdash;almost at once the firing on the beach ceased,
and more came from halfway up the cliff. The troops had obviously
landed, and were driving the Turks back. After a couple of hours
the top of the cliff was gained; there the troops became exposed to
a very heavy fire from some batteries of artillery placed well in
the rear, to which the warships attended as soon as they could
locate them. The <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> was close by us, apparently
watching a village just under the fort. Evidently some guns were
placed there. She loosed off her two fifteen-inch guns, and after
the dust had cleared away we could see that new streets had been
made for the inhabitants. Meanwhile the British had gained the top
and were making headway, but losing a lot of men&mdash;one could
see them falling everywhere.</p>

<h2><a name="landing" id="landing">THE ANZAC LANDING</a>
</h2>

<p>The horse-boats having been got overboard, we continued our
voyage towards what is now know as Anzac. Troops&mdash;Australians
and New Zealanders&mdash;were being taken ashore in barges.
Warships were firing apparently as fast as they could load, the
Turks replying with equal cordiality. In fact, as Captain Dawson
remarked to me, it was quite the most "willing" Sunday he had ever
seen.</p>

<p>Our troops were ascending the hills through a dwarf scrub, just
low enough to let us see the men's heads, though sometimes we could
only locate them by the glint of the bayonets in the sunshine.
Everywhere they were pushing on in extended order, but many
falling. The Turks appeared to have the range pretty accurately.
About mid-day our men seemed to be held up, the Turkish shrapnel
appearing to be too much for them. It was now that there occurred
what I think one of the finest incidents of the campaign. This was
the landing of the Australian Artillery. They got two of their guns
ashore, and over very rough country dragged them up the hills with
what looked like a hundred men to each. Up they went, through a
wheat-field, covered and plastered with shrapnel, but with never a
stop until the crest of the hill on the right was reached. Very
little time was wasted in getting into action, and from this time
it became evident that we were there to stay.</p>

<p>The practice of the naval guns was simply perfect. They lodged
shell after shell just in front of the foremost rank of our men; in
response to a message asking them to clear one of the gullies, one
ship placed shell after shell up that gully, each about a hundred
yards apart, and in as straight a line as if they were ploughing
the ground for Johnny Turk, instead of making the place too hot to
hold him.</p>

<p>The Turks now began to try for this warship, and in their
endeavours almost succeeded in getting the vessel we were on, as a
shell burst right overhead.</p>

<p>The wounded now began to come back, and the one hospital ship
there was filled in a very short time. Every available transport
was then utilised for the reception of casualties, and as each was
filled she steamed off to the base at Alexandria. As night came on
we appeared to have a good hold of the place, and orders came for
our bearer division to land. They took with them three days' "iron"
rations, which consisted of a tin of bully beef, a bag of small
biscuits, and some tea and sugar, dixies, a tent, medical comforts,
and (for firewood) all the empty cases we could scrape up in the
ship. Each squad had a set of splints, and every man carried a
tourniquet and two roller bandages in his pouch. Orders were issued
that the men were to make the contents of their water-bottles last
three days, as no water was available on shore.</p>

<p>The following evening the remainder of the Ambulance, less the
transport, was ordered ashore. We embarked in a trawler, and
steamed towards the shore in the growing dusk as far as the depth
of water would allow. The night was bitterly cold, it was raining,
and all felt this was real soldiering. None of us could understand
what occasioned the noise we heard at times, of something hitting
the iron deck houses behind us; at last one of the men exclaimed:
"Those are bullets, sir," so that we were having our baptism of
fire. It was marvellous that no one was hit, for they were fairly
frequent, and we all stood closely packed. Finally the skipper of
the trawler, Captain Hubbard, told me he did not think we could be
taken off that night, and therefore intended to drop anchor. He
invited Major Meikle and myself to the cabin, where the cook served
out hot tea to all hands. I have drunk a considerable number of
cups of tea in my time, but that mug was very, very nice. The night
was spent dozing where we stood, Paddy being very disturbed with
the noise of the guns.</p>

<p>At daylight a barge was towed out and, after placing all our
equipment on board, we started for the beach. As soon as the barge
grounded, we jumped out into the water (which was about waist deep)
and got to dry land. Colonel Manders, the A.D.M.S. of our Division,
was there, and directed us up a gully where we were to stay in
reserve for the time being, meantime to take lightly-wounded cases.
One tent was pitched and dug-outs made for both men and patients,
the Turks supplying shrapnel pretty freely. Our position happened
to be in rear of a mountain battery, whose guns the Turks appeared
very anxious to silence, and any shells the battery did not want
came over to us. As soon as we were settled down I had time to look
round. Down on the beach the 1st Casualty Clearing Station (under
Lieutenant-Colonel Giblin) and the Ambulance of the Royal Marine
Light Infantry were at work. There were scores of casualties
awaiting treatment, some of them horribly knocked about. It was my
first experience of such a number of cases. In civil practice, if
an accident took place in which three or four men were injured, the
occurrence would be deemed out of the ordinary: but here there were
almost as many hundreds, and all the flower of Australia. It made
one feel really that, in the words of General Sherman, "War is
hell," and it seemed damnable that it should be in the power of one
man, even if be he the German Emperor, to decree that all these men
should be mutilated or killed. The great majority were just coming
into manhood with all their life before them. The stoicism and
fortitude with which they bore their pain was truly remarkable.
Every one of them was cheery and optimistic; there was not a
murmur; the only requests were for a cigarette or a drink of water.
One felt very proud of these Australians, each waiting his turn to
be dressed without complaining. It really quite unnerved me for a
time. However, it was no time to allow the sentimental side of
one's nature to come uppermost.</p>

<p>I watched the pinnaces towing the barges in. Each pinnace
belonged to a warship and was in charge of a
midshipman&mdash;dubbed by his shipmates a "snotty." This name
originates from the days of Trafalgar. The little chaps appear to
have suffered from chronic colds in the head, with the usual
accompaniment of a copious flow from the nasal organs. Before
addressing an officer the boys would clean their faces by drawing
the sleeve of their jacket across the nose; and, I understand that
this practice so incensed Lord Nelson that he ordered three brass
buttons to be sewn on the wristbands of the boys' jackets. However,
this is by the way. These boys, of all ages from 14 to 16, were
steering their pinnaces with supreme indifference to the shrapnel
falling about, disdaining any cover and as cool as if there was no
such thing as war. I spoke to one, remarking that they were having
a great time. He was a bright, chubby, sunny-faced little chap, and
with a smile said: "Isn't it beautiful, sir? When we started, there
were sixteen of us, and now there are only six!" This is the class
of man they make officers out of in Britain's navy, and while this
is so there need be no fear of the result of any encounter with the
Germans.</p>

<p>Another boy, bringing a barge full of men ashore, directed them
to lie down and take all the cover they could, he meanwhile
steering the pinnace and standing quite unconcernedly with one foot
on the boat's rail.</p>

<h2><a name="peninsula" id="peninsula">AT WORK ON THE PENINSULA</a>
</h2>

<p>Casualties began to come in pretty freely, so that our tent was
soon filled. We now commenced making dug-outs in the side of the
gully and placing the men in these. Meantime stores of all kinds
were being accumulated on the beach&mdash;stacks of biscuits,
cheese and preserved beef, all of the best. One particular kind of
biscuit, known as the "forty-niners," had forty-nine holes in it,
was believed to take forty-nine years to bake, and needed
forty-nine chews to a bite. But there were also beautiful hams and
preserved vegetables, and with these and a tube of Oxo a very
palatable soup could be prepared. A well-known firm in England puts
up a tin which they term an Army Ration, consisting of meat and
vegetables, nicely seasoned and very palatable. For a time this
ration was eagerly looked for and appreciated, but later on, when
the men began to get stale, it did not agree with them so well; it
appeared to be too rich for many of us. We had plenty of jam, of a
kind&mdash;one kind. Oh! how we used to revile the maker of "Damson
and Apple'!" The damson coloured it, and whatever they used for
apple gave it body.</p>

<p>One thing was good all the time, and that was the tea. The brand
never wavered, and the flavour was always full. Maynard could
always make a good cup of it. It has been already mentioned that
water was not at first available on shore. This was soon overcome,
thanks to the Navy. They convoyed water barges from somewhere,
which they placed along shore; the water was then pumped into our
water carts, and the men filled their water-bottles from them. The
water, however, never appeared to quench our thirst. It was always
better made up into tea, or taken with lime juice when we could get
it.</p>

<p>Tobacco, cigarettes and matches were on issue, but the tobacco
was of too light a brand for me, so that Walkley used to trade off
my share of the pernicious weed for matches. The latter became a
precious commodity. I have seen three men light their pipes from
one match. Captain Welch was very independent; he had a burning
glass, and obtained his light from the sun. After a few days the
R.M.L.I. were ordered away, and we were directed to take up their
position on the beach. A place for operating was prepared by
putting sandbags at either end, the roof being formed by planks
covered with sandbags and loose earth. Stanchions of 4 x 4 in.
timber were driven into the ground, with crosspieces at a
convenient height; the stretcher was placed on these, and thus an
operating table was formed. Shelves were made to hold our
instruments, trays and bottles; these were all in charge of
Staff-Sergeant Henderson, a most capable and willing assistant.
Close by a kitchen was made, and a cook kept constantly employed
keeping a supply of hot water, bovril, milk and biscuits ready for
the men when they came in wounded, for they had to be fed as well
as medically attended to.</p>

<h2><a name="yarns" id="yarns">INCIDENTS AND YARNS</a>
</h2>

<p>One never ceased admiring our men, and their cheeriness under
these circumstances and their droll remarks caused us many a laugh.
One man, just blown up by a shell, informed us that it was a
&mdash;&mdash; of a place&mdash;'no place to take a lady.' Another
told of the mishap to his "cobber," who picked up a bomb and blew
on it to make it light; "all at once it blew his &mdash;&mdash;
head off&mdash;Gorblime! you would have laughed!" For lurid and
perfervid language commend me to the Australian Tommy. Profanity
oozes from him like music from a barrel organ. At the same time, he
will give you his idea of the situation, almost without exception
in an optimistic strain, generally concluding his observation with
the intimation that "We gave them hell." I have seen scores of them
lying wounded and yet chatting one to another while waiting their
turn to be dressed. The stretcher-bearers were a fine body of men.
Prior to this campaign, the Army Medical Corps was always looked
upon as a soft job. In peacetime we had to submit to all sorts of
flippant remarks, and were called Linseed Lancers, Body-snatchers,
and other cheery and jovial names; but, thanks to Abdul and the
cordiality of his reception, the A.A.M.C. can hold up their heads
with any of the fighting troops. It was a common thing to hear men
say: "This beach is a hell of a place! The trenches are better than
this." The praises of the stretcher-bearers were in all the men's
mouths; enough could not be said in their favour. Owing to the
impossibility of landing the transport, all the wounded had to be
carried; often for a distance of a mile and a half, in a blazing
sun, and through shrapnel and machine-gun fire. But there was never
a flinch; through it all they went, and performed their duty. Of
our Ambulance 185 men and officers landed, and when I relinquished
command, 43 remained. At one time we were losing so many bearers,
that carrying during the day-time was abandoned, and orders were
given that it should only be undertaken after night-fall. On one
occasion a man was being sent off to the hospital ship from our
tent in the gully. He was not very bad, but he felt like being
carried down. As the party went along the beach, Beachy Bill became
active; one of the bearers lost his leg, the other was wounded, but
the man who was being carried down got up and ran! All the remarks
I have made regarding the intrepidity and valour of the
stretcher-bearers apply also to the regimental bearers. These are
made up from the bandsmen. Very few people think, when they see the
band leading the battalion in parade through the streets, what
happens to them on active service. Here bands are not thought of;
the instruments are left at the base, and the men become bearers,
and carry the wounded out of the front line for the Ambulance men
to care for. Many a stretcher-bearer has deserved the V.C.</p>

<p>One of ours told me they had reached a man severely wounded in
the leg, in close proximity to his dug-out. After he had been
placed on the stretcher and made comfortable, he was asked whether
there was anything he would like to take with him. He pondered a
bit, and then said: "Oh! you might give me my diary&mdash;I would
like to make a note of this before I forget it!"</p>

<p>It can be readily understood that in dealing with large bodies
of men, such as ours, a considerable degree of organization is
necessary, in order to keep an account, not only of the man, but of
the nature of his injury (or illness, as the case may be) and of
his destination. Without method chaos would soon reign. As each
casualty came in he was examined, and dressed or operated upon as
the necessity arose. Sergeant Baxter then got orders from the
officer as to where the case was to be sent. A ticket was made out,
containing the man's name, his regimental number, the nature of his
complaint, whether morphia had been administered and the quantity,
and finally his destination. All this was also recorded in our
books, and returns made weekly, both to headquarters and to the
base. Cases likely to recover in a fortnight's time were sent by
fleet-sweeper to Mudros; the others were embarked on the hospital
ship. They were placed in barges, and towed out by a pinnace to a
trawler, and by that to the hospital ship, where the cases were
sorted out. When once they had left the beach, our knowledge of
them ceased, and of course our responsibility. One man arriving at
the hospital ship was describing, with the usual picturesque
invective, how the bullet had got into his shoulder. One of the
officers, who apparently was unacquainted with the Australian
vocabulary, said: "What was that you said, my man?" The reply came,
"A blightah ovah theah put a bullet in heah."</p>

<p>At a later period a new gun had come into action on our left,
which the men christened "Windy Annie." Beachy Bill occupied the
olive grove, and was on our right. Annie was getting the range of
our dressing station pretty accurately, and requisition on the
Engineers evoked the information that sandbags were not available.
However, the Army Service came to our rescue with some old friends,
the "forty-niners." Three tiers of these in their boxes defied the
shells just as they defied our teeth.</p>

<p>As the sickness began to be more manifest, it became necessary
to enlarge the accommodation in our gully. The hill was dug out,
and the soil placed in bags with which a wall was built, the
intervening portion being filled up with the remainder of the hill.
By this means we were able to pitch a second tent and house more of
those who were slightly ill. It was in connection with this
engineering scheme that I found the value of W.O. Cosgrove. He was
possessed of a good deal of the <i>suaviter in modo</i>, and it was
owing to his dextrous handling of Ordnance that we got such a fine
supply of bags. This necessitated a redistribution of dug-outs, and
a line of them was constructed sufficient to take a section of
bearers. The men christened this "Shrapnel Avenue." They called my
dug-out "The Nut," because it held the "Kernel." I offer this with
every apology. It's not my joke.</p>

<p>The new dug-outs were not too safe. Murphy was killed there one
afternoon, and Claude Grime badly wounded later on. Claude caused a
good deal of amusement. He had a rooted objection to putting on
clothes and wore only a hat, pants, boots and his smile.
Consequently his body became quite mahogany-coloured. When he was
wounded he was put under an an&aelig;sthetic so that I could search
for the bullet. As the an&aelig;sthetic began to take effect,
Claude talked the usual unintelligible gibberish. Now, we happened
to have a Turkish prisoner at the time, and in the midst of
Claude's struggles and shouts in rushed an interpreter. He looked
round, and promptly came over to Claude, uttering words which I
suppose were calculated to soothe a wounded Turk; and we had some
difficulty in assuring him that the other man, not Claude, was the
Turk he was in quest of.</p>

<h2><a name="air" id="air">AIR FIGHTING</a>
</h2>

<p>The German aeroplanes flew over our gully pretty regularly. As
first we were rather perturbed, as they had a nasty habit of
dropping bombs, but as far as I know they never did any damage.
Almost all the bombs dropped into the water. One of them sent some
steel arrows down, about six or eight inches in length, with a
metal point something like a carpenter's bit. In order to conceal
our tents, we covered them with holly-bushes, cut and placed over
the canvas. Our aeroplanes were constantly up, and were easily
recognised by a red ring painted underneath, while the Taube was
adorned with a large black cross; but after we had been there a
little time we found it was not necessary to use glasses in order
to ascertain whose flying machine was over us; we were able to tell
by listening, as their engines had a different sound from those
belonging to us.</p>

<p>Our aeroplanes were the source of a good deal of annoyance to
the Turks. They continually fired at them, but, as far as I was
able to judge, never went within cooee of one. The bursts of
shrapnel away in the air made a pretty sight, puffs of white smoke
like bits of cotton-wool in succession, and the aeroplane sailing
unconcernedly along. It appears to be very difficult to judge
distance away in the air, and even more difficult to estimate the
rate at which the object is travelling. What became of the
shell-cases of the shrapnel used to puzzle us. One day Walkley
remarked that it was peculiar that none fell on us. I replied
"surely there is plenty of room other than where we are for them to
fall." Scarcely were the words uttered than down one came close by.
We knew it was a case from above and not one fired direct, because
the noise was so different.</p>

<p>The hydroplanes used by the Navy were interesting. Floating on
the water, they would gather way and soar upwards like a bird.
Their construction was different from that of the aeroplanes.</p>

<p>A captive balloon was used a good deal to give the ranges for
the warships. It was carried on the forepart of a steamer and was,
I believe, in connection with it by telephone or wireless.</p>

<h2><a name="mess" id="mess">THE OFFICERS' MESS</a>
</h2>

<p>We kept up the custom of having an officers' mess right through
the campaign. When we first landed, while everything was in
confusion, each man catered for himself; but it was a lonely
business, and not conducive to health. When a man cooked his own
rations he probably did not eat much. So a dug-out was made close
to the hospital tent, and we all had our meals together. A rather
pathetic incident occurred one day. Just after we had finished
lunch three of us were seated, talking of the meals the "Australia"
provided, when a fragment of shell came through the roof on to the
table and broke one of the enamel plates. This may seem a trivial
affair and not worth grousing about; but the sorry part of it was
that we only had one plate each, and this loss entailed one man
having to wait until the others had finished their banquet.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere alluded to the stacks of food on the beach.
Amongst them bully beef was largely in evidence. Ford, our cook,
was very good in always endeavouring to disguise the fact that
"Bully" was up again. He used to fry it; occasionally he got curry
powder from the Indians and persuaded us that the resultant
compound was curried goose; but it was bully beef all the time.
Then he made what he called rissoles&mdash;onions entered largely
into their framework, and when you opened them you wanted to get
out into the fresh air. Preserved potatoes, too, were very handy.
We had them with our meat, and what remained over we put treacle
on, and ate as pancakes. Walkley and Betts obtained flour on
several occasions, and made very presentable pancakes. John Harris,
too, was a great forager&mdash;he knew exactly where to put his
hand on decent biscuits, and the smile with which he landed his
booty made the goods toothsome in the extreme. Harris had a
gruesome experience. One day he was seated on a hill, talking to a
friend, when a shell took the friend's head off and scattered his
brains over Harris.</p>

<p>Before leaving the description of the officers' mess, I must not
omit to introduce our constant companions, the flies. As
Australians we rather prided ourselves on our judgment regarding
these pests, and in Gallipoli we had every opportunity of putting
our faculties to the test. There were flies, big horse flies, blue
flies, green flies, and flies. They turned up everywhere and with
everything. While one was eating one's food with the right hand,
one had to keep the left going with a wisp, and even then the flies
beat us. Then we always had the comforting reflection of those dead
Turks not far away&mdash;the distance being nothing to a fly. In
order to get a little peace at one meal in the day, our dinner hour
was put back until dusk. Men wounded had a horrible time.
Fortunately we had a good supply of mosquito netting purchased with
the Red Cross money. It was cut up into large squares and each
bearer had a supply.</p>

<h2><a name="armistice" id="armistice">THE ARMISTICE</a>
</h2>

<p>On the 23rd of May anyone looking down the coast could see a man
on Gaba Tepe waving a white flag. He was soon joined by another
occupied in a like manner. Some officers came into the Ambulance
and asked for the loan of some towels; we gave them two, which were
pinned together with safety pins. White flags don't form part of
the equipment of Australia's army.</p>

<p>Seven mounted men had been observed coming down Gaba Tepe, and
they were joined on the beach by our four. The upshot was that one
was brought in blindfolded to General Birdwood. Shortly after we
heard it announced that a truce had been arranged for the following
day in order to bury the dead.</p>

<p>The following morning Major Millard and I started from our right
and walked up and across the battle-field. It was a stretch of
country between our lines and those of the Turks, and was
designated No Man's Land. At the extreme right there was a small
farm; the owner's house occupied part of it, and was just as the
man had left it. Our guns had knocked it about a good deal. In
close proximity was a field of wheat, in which there were scores of
dead Turks. As these had been dead anything from a fortnight to
three weeks their condition may be better imagined than described.
One body I saw was lying with the leg shattered. He had crawled
into a depression in the ground and lay with his great-coat rolled
up for a pillow; the stains on the ground showed that he had bled
to death, and it can only be conjectured how long he lay there
before death relieved him of his sufferings. Scores of the bodies
were simply riddled with bullets. Midway between the trenches a
line of Turkish sentries were posted. Each was in a natty blue
uniform with gold braid, and top boots, and all were done "up to
the nines." Each stood by a white flag on a pole stuck in the
ground. We buried all the dead on our side of this line and they
performed a similar office for those on their side. Stretchers were
used to carry the bodies, which were all placed in large trenches.
The stench was awful, and many of our men wore handkerchiefs over
their mouths in their endeavour to escape it. I counted two
thousand dead Turks. One I judged to be an officer of rank, for the
bearers carried him shoulder-high down a gully to the rear. The
ground was absolutely covered with rifles and equipment of all
kinds, shell-cases and caps, and ammunition clips. The rifles were
all collected and the bolts removed to prevent their being used
again. Some of the Turks were lying right on our trenches, almost
in some of them. The Turkish sentries were peaceable-looking men,
stolid in type and of the peasant class mostly. We fraternised with
them and gave them cigarettes and tobacco. Some Germans were there,
but they viewed us with malignant eyes. When I talked to Colonel
Pope about it afterwards he said the Germans were a mean lot of
beggars: "Why," said he most indignantly, "they came and had a look
into my trenches." I asked "What did you do?" He replied, "Well, I
had a look at theirs."</p>

<h2><a name="triumph" id="triumph">TORPEDOING OF THE
<i>TRIUMPH</i></a>
</h2>

<p>The day after the armistice, at fifteen minutes after noon, I
was in my dug-out when one of the men exclaimed that something was
wrong with the <i>Triumph</i>. I ran out and was in time to see the
fall of the water sent up by the explosive. It was a beautifully
calm day, and the ship was about a mile and a quarter from us; she
had a decided list towards us, and it was evident that something
was radically wrong. With glasses one could see the men lined up in
two ranks as if on parade, without the least confusion. Then two
destroyers went over and put their noses on each side of the big
ship's bows; all hands from the <i>Triumph</i> marched aboard the
destroyers. She was gradually heeling over, and all movables were
slipping into the sea. One of the destroyers barked three or four
shots at something which we took to be the submarine. In fifteen
minutes the <i>Triumph</i> was keel up, the water spurting from her
different vent pipes as it was expelled by the imprisoned air. She
lay thus for seventeen minutes, gradually getting lower and lower
in the water, when quietly her stern rose and she slipped
underneath, not a ripple remaining to show where she had sunk. I
have often read of the vortex caused by a ship sinking, but as far
as I could see there was in this case not the slightest
disturbance. It was pathetic to see this beautiful ship torpedoed
and in thirty-two minutes at the bottom of the sea. I believe the
only lives lost were those of men injured by the explosion.
Meanwhile five destroyers came up from Helles at a terrific speed,
the water curling from their bows; they and all the other
destroyers circled round and round the bay, but the submarine lay
low and got off. Her commander certainly did his job well.</p>

<h2><a name="destroyers" id="destroyers">THE DESTROYERS</a>
</h2>

<p>After the torpedoing of the <i>Triumph</i> here, and the
<i>Majestic</i> in the Straits all the big ships left and went to
Mudros, as there was no sense in leaving vessels costing over a
million each to the mercy of submarines. This gave the destroyers
the chance of their lives. Up to this they had not been allowed to
speak, but now they took on much of the bombardment required. They
were constantly nosing about, and the slightest movement on the
part of the Turks brought forth a bang from one of their guns. If a
Turk so much as winked he received a rebuke from the destroyer. The
Naval men all appeared to have an unbounded admiration for the
Australians as soldiers, and boats rarely came ashore without
bringing some fresh bread or meat or other delicacy; their tobacco,
too, was much sought after. It is made up from the leaf, and rolled
up in spun yarn. The flavour is full, and after a pipe of
it&mdash;well, you feel that you have had a smoke.</p>

<h2><a name="indian" id="indian">THE INDIAN REGIMENTS</a>
</h2>

<p>We had a good many Indian regiments in the Army Corps. The
mountain battery occupied a position on "Pluggey's Plateau" in the
early stage of the campaign, and they had a playful way of handing
out the shrapnel to the Turks. It was placed in boiling water to
soften the resin in which the bullets are held. By this means the
bullets spread more readily, much to the joy of the sender and the
discomfiture of Abdul. The Indians were always very solicitous
about their wounded. When one came in to be attended to, he was
always followed by two of his chums bearing, one a water bottle,
the other some food, for their caste prohibits their taking
anything directly from our hands. When medicine had to be
administered, the man came in, knelt down, and opened his mouth,
and the medicine was poured into him without the glass touching his
lips. Food was given in the same way. I don't know how they got on
when they were put on the ship. When one was killed, he was wrapped
up in a sheet and his comrades carried him shoulder-high to their
cemetery, for they had a place set apart for their own dead. They
were constantly squatting on their haunches making a sort of
pancake. I tasted one; but it was too fatty and I spat it out, much
to the amusement of the Indians.</p>

<p>One of them saw the humorous side of life. He described to Mr.
Henderson the different attitudes adopted towards Turkish shells by
the British, Indian and Australian soldiers. "British Tommy," said
he, "Turk shell, Tommy says 'Ah!' Turk shell, Indian say 'Oosh!'
Australian say 'Where the hell did that come from?'"</p>

<p>The Divisional Ammunition Column was composed of Sikhs, and they
were a brave body of men. It was their job to get the ammunition to
the front line, so that they were always fair targets for the
Turks. The mules were hitched up in threes, one in rear of the
other, each mule carrying two boxes of ammunition. The train might
number anything from 15 to 20 mules. All went along at a trot,
constantly under fire. When a mule was hit he was unhitched, the
boxes of ammunition were rolled off, and the train proceeded;
nothing stopped them. It was the same if one of the men became a
casualty; he was put on one side to await the
stretcher-bearers&mdash;but almost always one of the other men
appeared with a water bottle.</p>

<p>They were very adept in the management of mules. Frequently a
block would occur while the mule train occupied a sap; the mules at
times became fractious and manipulated their hind legs with the
most marvellous precision&mdash;certainly they placed a good deal
of weight in their arguments. But in the midst of it all, when one
could see nothing but mules' heels, straps and ammunition boxes,
the Indian drivers would talk to their charges and soothe them
down. I don't know what they said, but presume it resembled the
cooing, coaxing and persuasive tongue of our bullock-driver. The
mules were all stalled in the next gully to ours, and one afternoon
three or four of us were sitting admiring the sunset when a shell
came over. It was different from that usually sent by Abdul, being
seemingly formed of paper and black rag; someone suggested, too,
that there was a good deal of faultiness in the powder. From
subsequent inquiries we found that what we saw going over our
dug-outs was Mule! A shell had burst right in one of them, and the
resultant mass was what we had observed. The Ceylon Tea Planter's
Corps was bivouacked just below us and were having tea at the time;
their repast was mixed with mule.</p>

<p>Donkeys formed part of the population of the Peninsula. I am
referring here to the four-footed variety, though, of course,
others were in evidence at times. The Neddies were docile little
beasts, and did a great deal of transport work. When we moved out
in August, orders were issued that all equipment was to be carried.
I pointed out a drove of ten of these little animals, which
appeared handy and without an owner, and suggested to the men that
they would look well with our brand on. It took very little time to
round them up, cut a cross in the hair on their backs and place a
brassard round their ears. They were then our property. The other
type of donkey generally indulged in what were known as Furfys or
Beachograms. Furfy originated in Broadmeadows, Victoria; the second
title was born in the Peninsula. The least breath of rumour ran
from mouth to mouth in the most astonishing way. Talk about a Bush
Telegraph! It is a tortoise in its movements compared with a
Beachogram. The number of times that Achi Baba fell cannot be
accurately stated but it was twice a day at the least. A man came
in to be dressed on one occasion; suddenly some pretty smart rifle
fire broke out on the right. "Hell!" said the man, "what's up?"
"Oh!" said Captain Dawson, "There's a war on&mdash;didn't you hear
about it?"</p>

<h2><a name="swimming" id="swimming">THE SWIMMING</a>
</h2>

<p>One thing that was really good in Anzac was the swimming. At
first we used to dive off the barges; then the Engineers built
Watson's pier, at the end of which the water was fifteen feet deep
and as clear as crystal, so that one could see every pebble at the
bottom. At times the water was very cold, but always invigorating.
General Birdwood was an enthusiastic swimmer, but he always caused
me a lot of anxiety. That pier was well covered by Beachy Bill, and
one never knew when he might choose to give it his attention. This
did not deter the General. He came down most regularly, sauntered
out to the end, went through a lot of Sandow exercises and finally
jumped in. He then swam out to a buoy moored about a quarter of a
mile away. On his return he was most leisurely in drying himself.
Had anything happened to him I don't know what the men would have
done, for he was adored by everyone.</p>

<p>Swimming was popular with all hands. Early in the campaign we
had a Turkish attack one morning; it was over by midday, and an
hour later most of the men were in swimming. I think it not
unlikely that some of the "missing" men were due to this habit.
They would come to the beach and leave their clothes and identity
discs ashore, and sometimes they were killed in the water. In this
case there was no possibility of ascertaining their names. It often
struck me that this might account for some whose whereabouts were
unknown.</p>

<p>While swimming, the opportunity was taken by a good many to soak
their pants and shirts, inside which there was, very often, more
than the owner himself. I saw one man fish his pants out; after
examining the seams, he said to his pal: "They're not dead yet."
His pal replied "Never mind, you gave them a &mdash;&mdash; of a
fright." These insects were a great pest, and I would counsel
friends sending parcels to the soldiers to include a tin of
insecticide; it was invaluable when it could be obtained. I got a
fright myself one night. A lot of things were doing the Melbourne
Cup inside my blanket. The horrible thought suggested itself that I
had got "them" too, but a light revealed the presence of fleas.
These were very large able-bodied animals and became our constant
companions at nighttime; in fact, one could only get to sleep after
dosing the blanket with insecticide.</p>

<p>My little dog Paddy enjoyed the swim almost as much as I did. He
was a great favourite with everybody but the Provost-Martial. This
official was a terror for red tape, and an order came out that dogs
were to be destroyed. That meant that the Military Police were
after Paddy. However, I went to General Birdwood, who was very
handsome about it, and gave me permission to keep the little chap.
Almost immediately after he was reprieved he ran down to the
Provost-Martial's dug-out and barked at him. Paddy was very nearly
human. One day we were down as usual when Beachy Bill got busy, and
I had to leave the pier with only boots and a smile on. I took
refuge behind my old friends the biscuits, and Paddy ran out to
each shell, barking until it exploded. Finally one burst over him
and a bullet perforated his abdomen. His squeals were piteous. He
lived until the next day, but he got a soldier's burial.</p>

<h2><a name="prisoners" id="prisoners">TURKISH PRISONERS</a>
</h2>

<p>We saw a good many Turkish prisoners at one time or another, and
invariably fraternised with them. They were kept inside a
barbed-wire enclosure with a guard over them; but there was no need
to prevent their escape&mdash;they would not leave if they got the
chance. On one occasion twelve of them were told to go some
distance into the scrub and bring in some firewood. No one was sent
with them, the idea being to encourage them to go to their lines
and persuade some of the Turks to desert to us. But they were like
the cat; they all came back&mdash;with the firewood.</p>

<p>I saw two of our men on one occasion bringing in a prisoner.
They halted on the hill opposite us, and one of them went to
headquarters to ascertain how the prisoner was to be disposed of.
In a very short time he was surrounded by fourteen or fifteen of
our soldiers, trying to carry on a conversation, and giving him
cigarettes and in fact anything he would accept. An hour before
they had been trying their best to shoot one another. In one of the
attacks on our left the Turks were badly beaten off and left a lot
of their dead close up to our trenches. As it was not safe to get
over and remove the bodies, a number of boat-hooks were obtained,
and with them the bodies were pulled in to our trenches. One of the
"bodies" proved to be a live Turk who had been unable to get back
to his line for fear of being shot by our men. He was blindfolded
and sent down to the compound with the other prisoners.</p>

<p>The difficulty of obtaining sufficient exercise was very great
at times. We only held a piece of territory under a square mile in
extent, and none of it was free from shell or rifle-fire, so that
our perambulations were carried on under difficulty. Major Meikle
and I had our regular walk before breakfast. At first we went down
the beach towards Gaba Tepe, and then sat for a while talking and
trying to see what we could see; but a sniper apparently used to
watch for us, for we were invariably saluted by the ping of a rifle
in the distance and the dust of the bullet in close proximity to
our feet. We concluded that, if we continued to walk in this
direction someone would be getting hurt, so our walks were altered
to the road round "Pluggey's Plateau." We were seated there one
morning when our howitzer in the gully was fired, and we felt that
the shell was not far from where we sat. We went down to the
Battery, and I interrogated some of the gunners. "How far off the
top of that hill does that shell go?" said I. "About a yard, sir,"
replied the man; "one time we hit it." I asked him if it would be
convenient for the battery to elevate a bit if we were sitting
there again.</p>

<h2><a name="postoffice" id="postoffice">POST OFFICE</a>
</h2>

<p>The postal arrangements on the whole were good, considering the
circumstances under which the mails were handled. It was always a
matter of interest for all of us when we saw mail-bags in the
barges, whether or no we were to participate in the good luck of
receiving letters. And here I might make the suggestion to
correspondents in Australia to send as many snap-shot photos. as
possible. They tell more than a letter, for one can see how the
loved ones are looking. Papers were what we needed most, and we got
very few indeed of these. I wrote home once that I was fortunate in
having a paper to read that had been wrapped round greasy bacon.
This was a positive fact. We were up the gully at the advance
dressing station, and a machine gun was playing right down the
position. Four men were killed and six wounded right in front of
us, so that it was not prudent to leave until night fell. It was
then that reading matter became so necessary. The paper was the
<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> and contained an advertisement stating
that there was a vacancy for two boarders at Katoomba; I was an
applicant for the vacancy. The <i>Bulletin</i> was a God-send when
it arrived, as was <i>Punch</i>. Norman Morris occasionally got
files of the <i>Newcastle Morning Herald</i>, which he would hand
on to us, as there were a lot of men from the Newcastle district in
the Ambulance. Later on it was possible to register a small parcel
in the Field Post Office&mdash;for home.</p>

<h2><a name="sanitary" id="sanitary">SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS</a>
</h2>

<p>In order to keep the health of the troops good it was necessary
to be exceedingly careful in the matter of sanitation.
Lieutenant-Colonel Millard was the Sanitary Officer for our
Division, and Lieutenant-Colonel Stokes for the 1st Australian
Division.</p>

<p>The garbage at first was collected in casks, placed in a barge
and conveyed out into the bay; it was found, however, that a lot of
it drifted back. It reminded one so much of Newcastle and Stockton.
The same complaints were made by the men on the right as are put
forth by Stockton residents regarding the Newcastle garbage. We, of
course, occupied the position of the Newcastle Council, and were
just as vehement in our denial of what was a most obvious fact. The
situation was exactly the same&mdash;only that, instead of dead
horses, there were dead mules. Three incinerators were started,
enclosures built up with stone, and a fire lighted. This was
effective, but gave rise to a very unpleasant smell along the
beach. The only time I was shot was from an incinerator; a
cartridge had been included in the rubbish and exploded just as I
was passing. The bullet gave me a nasty knock on the shin.</p>

<p>It was a fairly common practice among men just arrived to put a
cartridge in their fire just to hear the noise. Of course down on
the beach it was not usual to hear a rifle fired at close range,
and the sound would make everybody look up to "see where the
&mdash;&mdash; that came from." The discovery of the culprit would
bring out a chorus from the working parties: "Give him a popgun,
give him a popgun!" "Popgun" was preceded by the usual Australian
expletive.</p>

<p>The water found on the Peninsula was always subjected to careful
examination, and, before the troops were allowed to use it notices
were placed on each well stating whether the water was to be boiled
or if only to be used for washing.</p>

<h2><a name="simpson" id="simpson">SIMPSON</a>
</h2>

<p>Everyone knows of Simpson and his donkey. This man belonged to
one of the other Ambulances, but he made quite frequent trips
backwards and forwards to the trenches, the donkey always carrying
a wounded man. Simpson was frequently warned of the danger he ran,
for he never stopped, no matter how heavy the firing was. His
invariable reply was "My troubles!" The brave chap was killed in
the end. His donkey was afterwards taken over by Johnstone, one of
our men, who improvised stirrups out of the stretcher-slings, and
conveyed many wounded in this manner.</p>

<h2><a name="church" id="church">CHURCH SERVICES</a>
</h2>

<p>No account of the war would be complete without some mention of
the good work of the chaplains. They did their work nobly, and gave
the greatest assistance to the bearers in getting the wounded down.
I came into contact chiefly with those belonging to our own
Brigade. Colonel Green, Colonel Wray, and Captain Gillitson; the
latter was killed while trying to get one of our men who had been
wounded. Services were held whenever possible, and sometimes under
very peculiar circumstances. Once service was being conducted in
the gully when a platoon was observed coming down the opposite hill
in a position exposed to rifle fire. The thoughts of the audience
were at once distracted from what the Padre was expounding by the
risk the platoon was running; and members of the congregation
pointed out the folly of such conduct, emphasizing their remarks by
all the adjectives in the Australian vocabulary. Suddenly a shell
burst over the platoon and killed a few men. After the wounded had
been cared for, the Padre regained the attention of his
congregation and gave out the last verse of "Praise God from Whom
all blessings flow." There was one man for whom I had a great
admiration&mdash;a clergyman in civil life but a stretcher-bearer
on the Peninsula&mdash;Private Greig McGregor. He belonged to the
1st Field Ambulance, and I frequently saw him. He always had a
stretcher, either carrying a man or going for one, and in his odd
moments he cared for the graves of those who were buried on Hell
Spit. The neatness of many of them was due to his kindly thought.
He gained the D.C.M., and richly deserved it.</p>

<p>All the graves were looked after by the departed one's chums.
Each was adorned with the Corps' emblems: thus the Artillery used
shell caps, the Army Medical Corps a Red Cross in stone, etc.</p>

<h2><a name="engineers" id="engineers">THE ENGINEERS</a>
</h2>

<p>The Engineers did wonderfully good work, and to a layman their
ingenuity was most marked. Piers were made out of all sorts of
things; for instance, a boat would be sunk and used as a buttress,
then planks put over it for a wharf. They built a very fine pier
which was afterwards named Watson's. Again, the "monkey" of a pile
driver they erected was formed out of an unexploded shell from the
<i>Goeben</i>. This warship, a German cruiser taken over by the
Turks, was in the Sea of Marmora, and occasionally the Commander in
a fit of German humour would fire a few shells over Gallipoli neck
into the bay&mdash;a distance of about eight or nine miles. As soon
as the <i>Goeben</i> began firing, one of our aeroplanes would go
up, and shortly afterwards the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> could be seen
taking up a position on our side of the Peninsula, and loosing off.
Whether she hit the <i>Goeben</i> or not we never heard. It was
<i>Mafeesh</i>.</p>

<p>The Engineers also made miles upon miles of roads and,
furthermore, created the nucleus of a water storage. A number of
large tanks from Egypt were placed high up on "Pluggey's," whence
the water was reticulated into the far distant gullies.</p>

<h2><a name="attack" id="attack">TURKS ATTACK</a>
</h2>

<p>One night in May the Turks made a fierce attack on us,
apparently determined to carry out their oft-repeated threat of
driving us into the sea. The shells just rained down over our
gully, lighting up the dug-outs with each explosion. It was like
Hell let loose. Word came up from the beach station that they were
full of casualties and on getting down there one found that the
situation had not been over-estimated. The whole beach was filled
with stretchers, the only light being that from bursting shells. We
worked hard all night operating and dressing, and when one had time
to think, one's thoughts generally took the shape of wondering how
the men were keeping the Turks off. It was useless to be
sentimental, although many of my friends were amongst those
injured; the work just had to be done in the best way possible.</p>

<p>One night a strong wind got up, just like our "Southerly
Busters," and in the middle of it all firing began on our left. I
heard that the Turks nearly got into the trenches, but they were
beaten off and rolled right round the position&mdash;passed on, as
it were, from battalion to battalion.</p>

<p>It was very interesting to watch the warships bombarding Turkish
positions. One ship, attacking Achi Baba, used to fire her
broadside, and on the skyline six clouds would appear at regular
intervals, for all the world like windmills. On another occasion I
watched two ships bombarding the same hill a whole afternoon. One
would think there was not a square yard left untouched, and each
shot seemed to lift half the hill. Twenty minutes after they had
ceased firing, a battery of guns came out from somewhere and fired
in their turn. They must have been in a tunnel to have escaped that
inferno. One day we were up on "Pluggey's" while our beach was
being shelled; at last the stack of ammunition caught fire and was
blazing fiercely until some of the men got buckets and quenched the
fire with sea water most courageously. Later a shell landed among a
lot of dug-outs. There was quietness for a bit; then one man began
scraping at the disturbed earth, then another; finally about six of
them were shovelling earth away; at last a man appeared with his
birthday suit for his only attire. He ran like a hare for the next
gully, amid the yells of laughter of all who witnessed the
occurrence. I think he had been swimming, and being disturbed by
"Beachy," had run for a dug-out only to be buried by the shell.</p>

<p>That was the extraordinary thing about our soldiers. Shelling
might be severe and searching, but only if a man was hit was it
taken seriously. In that case a yell went up for stretcher-bearers;
if it was a narrow squeak, then he was only laughed at.</p>

<p>That beach at times was the most unhealthy place in the
Peninsula. Men frequently said they would sooner go back to the
trenches. One day we had five killed and twenty-five wounded. Yet,
had Johnny Turk been aware of it, he could have made the place
quite untenable. I saw one shell get seven men who were standing in
a group. The effect was remarkable. All screwed themselves up
before falling. They were all lightly wounded.</p>

<h2><a name="redcross" id="redcross">RED CROSS</a>
</h2>

<p>About the middle of July I sent a corporal and two men over to
Heliopolis with a letter to Lieutenant-Colonel Barrett, asking for
some Red Cross goods. I had already received issue vouchers for two
lots, but these had been intercepted in transit, so the men were
ordered to sit on the cases until they gave delivery to the
Ambulance. Fifty cases came, filled with pyjamas, socks, shirts,
soap and all sorts of things. The day they arrived was very, very
hot, and our hospital was full of men whose uniform had not been
off since they landed. No time was lost in getting into the
pyjamas, and the contented look on the men's faces would have
gratified the ladies who worked so hard for the Red Cross. Talk
about peace and contentment&mdash;they simply lolled about in the
scrub smoking cigarettes, and I don't believe they would have
changed places with a Federal Senator.</p>

<p>Those Red Cross goods saved one man's life at least. All the
unopened cases were placed outside the tent. One afternoon a shell
came over into a case of jam, went through it, and then into
another containing socks. A man was lying under the shelter of this
box, but the socks persuaded the shell to stay with them, and thus
his life was saved. It was on this day that my nephew,
Staff-Sergeant Nickson, was wounded. He had just left his dug-out
to go to the dressing station on the beach when a shrapnel shell
severely wounded him in the leg. The same shell killed
Staff-Sergeant Gordon, a solicitor from Adelaide, and one of the
finest characters I knew. He was shot through the spine and killed
instantly. Two other men were wounded.</p>

<p>Our Ambulance was ordered to pitch a hospital up Canterbury
Gully to provide for a possible outbreak of cholera, as almost
every writer on the subject stated that, when European troops
occupied trenches that had been previously held by Turks, an
outbreak of cholera invariably followed. Major Clayton was detailed
for the work, and soon had accommodation for a hundred men. As
there was no cholera, the sick men were kept here. We had been so
long in this place without a change, and so many troops were
crowded into such a small area, without a possibility of real rest,
that the men began to get very stale. Sickness was prevalent, and
this hospital seemed to help them a great deal. It was a picture to
see them all lying in their pyjamas reading the <i>Bulletin</i> and
<i>Punch</i>, and swapping lies.</p>

<p>The New Zealanders held a concert here one night. Major
Johnston, the O.C., filled the position of chairman, the chair
being a cask. One man with a cornet proved a good performer;
several others sang, while some gave recitations. We all sat round
in various places in the gully, and joined in the choruses. It was
very enjoyable while it lasted; but, as darkness came on,
rifle-fire began on the tops of the surrounding hills&mdash;also,
occasionally, shell fire. This completely drowned the sound of the
performers' voices, and the concert had to be brought to a close;
Abdul had counted us out.</p>

<h2><a name="advance" id="advance">PREPARING FOR THE ADVANCE</a>
</h2>

<p>Towards the end of July great preparations were made for an
offensive movement, the object being to take Hill 971 and so turn
the Turk's right. Large platforms were dug out of the hillsides in
Monash Gully, each capable of holding three to five hundred men;
they were constructed well below the sky line, and were fairly
secure from shell fire. On these the incoming battalions were
placed. There was not much room for sleep, but the main object
seemed to be to have as many men handy as possible. The Turks
seemed to be aware of the influx of troops, as they shelled the
whole position almost all night. The beach, of course, was attended
to most fervently, but considering the numbers of men landing few
casualties occurred.</p>

<p>A 4.7 naval gun, which, I understand, had served in the relief
of Ladysmith, was swathed in bags and landed on a barge, which
conveyed it to a position alongside the pier. A party was put on to
make a shield on the pier of boxes of our faithful friends the
"forty-niners," in case there were any Turks of an enquiring turn
of mind along the beach towards Suvla.</p>

<p>The Engineers then constructed a landing place, and the gun was
hauled ashore, again covered up, and conveyed to its position on
our right during the night. General Birdwood outwitted the Turks
that time, as they did not fire a shot during the whole
operation.</p>

<p>On the third of August we received orders to remove to the left
flank, the right being held by the Australian Division which
participated in the operation known afterwards as Lone Pine. The
last day on the beach proved to be pretty hot with shelling,
chiefly from Beachy Bill. A number of pinnaces were busy all day
towing in barges from the transports, and this could be easily seen
from the olive grove where Bill had his lair. At one time the
shells came over like rain; two of the pinnaces were hit below the
water-line, and were in imminent danger of sinking. Through all the
shelling Commander Cater ran along the pier to give some direction
regarding the pinnaces, but was killed before he got there. He was
a brave man, and always very courteous and considerate.</p>

<p>Our casualties during this afternoon were pretty considerable,
and our stretcher-bearers were constantly on the "go" getting men
under shelter.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the Ghurkas came ashore, but the Turks
spotted them, and gave them a cordial welcome to Anzac. They are a
small-sized set of men, very dark (almost black), with Mongol type
of face and very stolid. One was killed while landing. They were
evidently not accustomed to shell-fire, and at first were rather
scared, but were soon reassured when we told them where to stand in
safety. Each carried in addition to his rifle a Kukri&mdash;a
heavy, sharp knife, shaped something like a reaping-hook, though
with a curve not quite so pronounced. It was carried in a leather
case, and was as keen as a razor. I believe the Ghurkas' particular
delight is to use it in lopping off arms at the shoulder-joint. As
events turned out we were to see a good deal of these little chaps,
and to appreciate their fighting qualities.</p>

<p>The 2nd Field Ambulance was to take our position on the beach.
We packed up our panniers and prepared to leave the spot where we
had done so much work during the last three months, and where we
had been the unwilling recipients of so much attention from Beachy
Bill and his friend Windy Annie. Our donkeys carried the panniers,
and each man took his own wardrobe. Even in a place like this one
collects rubbish, just as at home, and one had to choose just what
he required to take away; in some cases this was very little, for
each had to be his own beast of burden. Still, with our needs
reduced to the minimum, we looked rather like walking
Christmas-trees. The distance to Rest Gully was about a mile and a
half, through saps and over very rough cobble-stones, and our
household goods and chattels became heavy indeed before we halted;
I know mine did.</p>

<h2><a name="attempt" id="attempt">THE ATTEMPT ON SARI BAIR</a>
</h2>

<p>Our Ambulance was attached to the Left Assaulting Column, which
consisted of the 29th Indian Brigade, 4th Australian Infantry
Brigade, Mountain Battery and one company of New Zealand Engineers
under Brigadier-General Cox.</p>

<p>The commanding officers of all the ambulances in General
Godley's Division met in the gully and had the operation orders
explained to them by the A.D.M.S. of the Division, Colonel Manders,
a very capable officer. To my great regret he was killed two days
later; we had been acquainted for some time, and I had a great
regard for him.</p>

<p>The 4th Infantry Brigade was to operate in what was known as the
Aghyl Dere (Dere in Turkish means "gully"). The operation order
gave out that we were to establish our Field Hospital in such a
position as to be readily accessible for the great number of
wounded we expected. Meantime, after making all arrangements for
the move and ascertaining that each man knew his job exactly, we
sat about for a while. The bombardment was to commence at 5 p.m.
Precisely at that hour the <i>Bacchante</i> opened fire, the
howitzers and our field guns co-operating, the Turks making a
hearty response. The din was frightful. To make a man sitting
beside me hear what I was saying, I had to shout at the top of my
voice. However, there were not many men hit. We had tea&mdash;for
which Walkley had got three eggs from somewhere, the first I had
tasted since leaving Egypt. We tried to get some sleep, but that
was impossible, the noise being so great; it was hard, too, to know
where one was safe from bullets. Mr. Tute, the Quartermaster, and I
got a dug-out fairly well up the hill, and turned in. We had not
been long there when a machine-gun appeared to be trained right on
to us&mdash;bullets were coming in quantities. It was pitch-dark,
so we waited until they stopped, and then got further down the
gully and tried to sleep there&mdash;but this particular dug-out
had more than ourselves in it, and we passed the night hunting for
things. The Division started to march out just after dark, the 4th
Brigade leading. It was almost daylight before the rear of the
column passed the place at which we were waiting. The men were all
in great spirits, laughing and chaffing and giving the usual "Are
we down'earted?". I think those men would laugh if they were going
to be hanged. Our bearer divisions, in charge respectively of
Captains Welch, Jeffries and Kenny, followed in rear of the
Brigade, while the tent divisions came in rear of the whole
column.</p>

<p>Major Meikle and I had often, like Moses viewing the Land of
Promise, looked at the country over which the fight was now to take
place&mdash;a stretch of flats about three miles long, from the
beach up to the foot of the hills. As the day broke, we found a
transformation at Nibronesi Point, which is the southernmost part
of Suvla Bay. At nightfall not a ship was there; now there was a
perfect forest of masts. The place looked like Siberia in Newcastle
when there was a strike on. I counted ten transports, seven
battle-cruisers, fourteen destroyers, twelve trawlers and a lot of
pinnaces. These had landed the force which was afterwards known as
the Suvla Bay Army. A balloon ship and five hospital ships were
also at anchor in the bay. As we passed what was known as our No. 3
Outpost, we came across evidences of the fight&mdash;dead men, dead
mules, equipment, ammunition boxes and rifles lying all over the
place. We noted, too, little hillocks of sand here and there, from
behind which the Turks had fired at our column. It was evident that
our men had soon got in touch with the enemy and had driven him
back. The Aghyl Dere proved to be a fairly wide gully with steep
hills on either side. A little distance, about three quarters of a
mile up, we came to what had been the Turkish Brigade Headquarters.
Here everything was as they had left it. The surprise had been
complete, and we had given them very short notice to quit.
Clothing, rifles, equipment, copper pans and boilers were in
abundance, and it was evident that Abdul makes war with regard to
every comfort, for there were visible also sundry articles of
wearing apparel only used by the gentler sex. The men had
comfortable bivouacs and plenty of bed-clothing of various
patterns. The camp was situated in a hollow, round in shape and
about a hundred yards in diameter, with dug-outs in the surrounding
hillsides; all was very clean, except for the fleas, of which a
good assortment remained. The dug-outs were roofed in with
waterproof sheets, buttoned together and held up by pegs which
fitted into one another. These sheets, with the poles, made handy
bivouac shelters, easily pitched and struck. Altogether, their camp
equipment was better than ours.</p>

<p>We annexed all the pans and boilers and made good use of them
for our own Ambulance. Then, proceeding further up the gully, we
found it almost impassable by reason of dead Ghurkas and mules; a
gun on a ridge had the range of this place to a nicety, and the
ammunition train was held up for a time. I never saw such a mess of
entangled mules; they were kicking and squealing, many of them were
wounded, and through it all the Indian drivers were endeavouring to
restore some kind of order. One had to keep close under the banks
to escape the shells. Not far from here was the emplacement of our
old friend "Windy Annie," but alas! Annie was constant to Abdul,
and they had taken her with them. It was a great pity we did not
get the gun. No wonder our guns never found the place. The ground
had been dug out to some depth and then roofed over with great logs
and covered with earth and sandbags; the ammunition&mdash;plenty of
it&mdash;was in deep pits on either side; artillery quarters were
in close proximity, and the tracks of the gun were clearly
seen.</p>

<p>The shelling was far too heavy to let us pitch a dressing
station anywhere here, so we retired to the beach to find a place
more sheltered under the hills; the bearers meanwhile followed the
troops. Soon scores of casualties began to arrive, and we selected
a position in a dry creek about six yards wide, with high banks on
either side. The operating tent was used as a protection from the
sun and stretched from bank to bank, the centre being upheld by
rifles lashed together; the panniers were used to form the
operating table, and our drugs were placed round the banks. We
were, however, much handicapped by not having any transport, as our
donkeys had been requisitioned by the Army Service Corps.
Everything had to be carried from a distance, and water was
exceedingly scarce. All day we were treating cases and operating
until late at night. Major Meikle and I divided the night, and we
were kept going. From one until four in the morning I slept in a
hole in a trench like a tomb.</p>

<p>At daylight we could see our men righting their way through the
scrub over Sari Bair, the warships firing just ahead of them to
clear the scrub of the Turkish Infantry. The foremost men carried
flags, which denoted the farthest point reached and the extent of
the two flanks, as a direction to the ship. With the glasses one
could see that the bayonet was being used pretty freely; the Turks
were making a great stand, and we were losing a lot of men. They
could be seen falling everywhere.</p>

<h2><a name="ambulance" id="ambulance">AMBULANCE WORK</a>

<p>Our bearers were doing splendid work; it was a long and
dangerous carry, and a lot of them were wounded themselves. The
miserable part of the affair was that the Casualty Clearing Station
on the beach broke down and could not evacuate our wounded. This
caused a block, and we had numbers of wounded on our hands. A block
of a few hours can be dealt with, but when it is impossible to get
cases away for forty hours the condition of the men is very
miserable. However, we got the cooks going, and had plenty of
Bovril and Oxo, which we boiled up with biscuits broken small. It
made a very sustaining meal, but caused thirst, which was
troublesome, as it was particularly difficult to obtain water.
Shelter from the sun, too, was hard to get; the day was exceedingly
hot, and there were only a few trees about. As many as could be got
into the shade were put there, but we had to keep moving them round
to avoid the sun. Many of the cases were desperate, but they
uttered not a word of complaint&mdash;they all seemed to understand
that it was not our fault that they were kept here.</p>

<p>As the cases were treated by us, they were taken down towards
the beach and kept under cover as much as possible. At one time we
had nearly four hundred waiting for removal to the ship. Then came
a message asking for more stretchers to be sent to the firing line,
and none were to be obtained; so we just had to remove the wounded
from those we had, lay them on the ground, and send the stretchers
up. Thank goodness, we had plenty of morphia, and the hypodermic
syringe relieved many who would otherwise have suffered great
agony.</p>

<p>Going through the cases, I found one man who had his arm
shattered and a large wound in his chest. Amputation at the
shoulder-joint was the only way of saving his life. Major Clayton
gave the anaesthetic, and we got him through.</p>

<p>Quite a number of Ghurkas and Sikhs were amongst the wounded,
and they all seemed to think that it was part of the game; patience
loomed large among their virtues. Turkish wounded were also on our
hands, and, though they could not speak our language, still they
expressed gratitude with their eyes. One of the Turks was
interrogated, first by the Turkish interpreter with no result; the
Frenchman then had a go at him, and still nothing could be got out
of him. After these two had finished, Captain Jefferies went over
to the man and said, "Would you like a drink of water?" "Yes,
please," was the reply.</p>

<p>During one afternoon, after we had been in this place for three
days, a battalion crossed the ground between us and the beach. This
brought the Turkish guns into action immediately, and we got the
time of our lives. We had reached a stage when we regarded
ourselves as fair judges of decent shell-fire, and could give an
unbiassed opinion on the point, but&mdash;to paraphrase
Kipling&mdash;what we knew before was "Pop" to what we now had to
swallow. The shells simply rained on us, shrapnel all the time; of
course our tent was no protection as it consisted simply of canvas,
and the only thing to do was to keep under the banks as much as
possible. We were jammed full of wounded in no time. Men rushing
into the gully one after another, and even a company of infantry
tried to take shelter there; but that, of course, could not be
allowed. We had our Geneva Cross flag up, and their coming there
only drew fire.</p>

<p>In three-quarters of an hour we put through fifty-four cases.
Many bearers were hit, and McGowen and Threlfall of the 1st Light
Horse Field Ambulance were killed. Seven of our tent division were
wounded. One man reported to me that he had been sent as a
reinforcement, had been through Samoa, and had just arrived in
Gallipoli. While he was speaking, he sank quietly down without a
sound. A bullet had come over my shoulder into his heart. That was
another instance of the fortune of war. Many men were hit, either
before they landed or soon after, while others could go months with
never a scratch. From 2 till 7 p.m. we dealt with 142 cases.</p>

<p>This shelling lasted for an hour or more, and when it subsided a
party of men arrived with a message from Divisional Headquarters.
They had been instructed to remove as many of the Ambulance as were
alive. Headquarters, it appears, had been watching the firing. We
lost very little time in leaving, and for the night we dossed down
in the scrub a mile further along the beach, where we were only
exposed to the fire of spent bullets coming over the hills. Our
fervent prayer was that we had said good-bye to shells.</p>

<p>The new position was very nice; it had been a farm&mdash;in fact
the plough was still there, made of wood, no iron being used in its
construction. Blackberries, olives, and wild thyme grew on the
place, and also a kind of small melon. We did not eat any; we
thought we were running enough risks already; but the cooks used
the thyme to flavour the bovril, and it was a nice addition.</p>

<p>Not far from us something happened that was for all the world
like an incident described by Zola in his "D&egrave;bacle," when
during the bombardment before Sedan a man went on ploughing in a
valley with a white horse, while an artillery duel continued over
his head. Precisely the same thing occurred here&mdash;the only
difference being that here a man persisted in looking after his
cattle, while the guns were firing over his head.</p>

<p>Walkley and Betts proved ingenious craftsmen. They secured two
wheels left by the Signalling Corps, and on these fastened a
stretcher; out of a lot of the web equipment lying about they made
a set of harness; two donkeys eventuated from somewhere, and with
this conveyance quite a lot of transport was done. Water and
rations were carried as well, and the saving to our men was great.
Goodness knows the bearers were already sufficiently worked
carrying wounded.</p>

<p>The <i>Bacchante</i> did some splendid firing, right into the
trenches every time. With one shot, amongst the dust and earth, a
Turk went up about thirty feet: arms and legs extended, his body
revolving like a catherine wheel. One saw plenty of limbs go up at
different times, but this was the only time when I saw a man go
aloft <i>in extenso</i>.</p>

<p>It was while we were in this position that W.O. Henderson was
hit; the bullet came through the tent, through another man's arm
and into Mr. Henderson. He was a serious loss to the Ambulance, as
since its inception he had had sole charge of everything connected
with the supply of drugs and dressings, and I missed his services
very much.</p>

<p>We were now being kept very busy and had little time for rest,
numbers of cases being brought down. Our table was made of four
biscuit boxes, on which were placed the stretchers. We had to be
very sparing of water, as all had to be carried. The donkey
conveyance was kept constantly employed. Whenever that party left
we used to wonder whether they would return, for one part of the
road was quite exposed to fire; but Betts and Walkley both pulled
through.</p>

<p>One night I had just turned in at nine-thirty, when Captain
Welch came up to say that a bad casualty had come in, and so many
came in afterwards that it was three o'clock in the following
morning before I had finished operating. While in the middle of the
work I looked up and found G. Anschau holding the lantern. He
belonged to the 1st Field Ambulance, but had come over to our side
to give any assistance he could. He worked like a Trojan.</p>

<p>We still had our swim off the beach from this position. It will
be a wonderful place for tourists after the war is over. For
Australians particularly it will have an unbounded interest. The
trenches where the men fought will be visible for a long time, and
there will be trophies to be picked up for years to come. All along
the flat land by the beach there are sufficient bullets to start a
lead factory. Then searching among the gullies will give good
results. We came across the Turkish Quartermaster's store, any
quantity of coats and boots and bully beef. The latter was much
more palatable than ours.</p>

<p>Our men had a novel way of fishing; they threw a bomb into the
water, and the dead fish would either float and be caught or go to
the bottom&mdash;in which case the water was so clear that they
were easily seen. Wilson brought me two, something like a mackerel,
that were delicious.</p>

<p>As there was still a good deal of delay in getting the cases
off, our tent was brought over from Canterbury Gully and pitched on
the beach; the cooks keeping the bovril and biscuits going. We
could not maintain it there long, however, as the Turks' rifle-fire
was too heavy, so the evacuation was all done from Walker's Ridge
about two miles away. The Casualty Clearing Station here (the 16th)
was a totally different proposition from the other one. Colonel
Corkery was commanding officer, and knew his job. His command was
exceedingly well administered, and there was no further occasion to
fear any block in getting our wounded off.</p>

<p>Amongst the men who came in to be dressed was one wounded in the
leg. The injury was a pretty bad one, though the bone was not
fractured. The leg being uncovered, the man sat up to look at it.
He exclaimed "Eggs a cook! I thought it was only a scratch!"</p>

<p>Our bearers did great work here, Sergeant Baber being in charge
and the guiding spirit amongst them. Carberry from Western
Australia proved his worth in another manner. The 4th Brigade were
some distance up the gully and greatly in want of water. Carberry
seems to have the knack of divining, for he selected a spot where
water was obtained after sinking. General Monash drew my attention
to this, and Carberry was recommended for the D.C.M.</p>

<p>Early in August, soon after Colonel Manders was killed, I was
promoted to his position as Assistant Director of Medical Services,
or, as it is usually written, A.D.M.S. On this I relinquished
command of the 4th Field Ambulance, and though I appreciated the
honour of the promotion yet I was sorry to leave the Ambulance. We
had been together so long, and through so much, and every member of
it was of such sterling worth, that when the order came for me to
join Headquarters I must say that my joy was mingled with regret.
Everyone&mdash;officers, non-commissioned officers and
men&mdash;had all striven to do their level best, and had
succeeded. With one or two exceptions it was our first experience
on active service, but all went through their work like veterans.
General Godley, in whose division we were, told me how pleased he
was with the work of the Ambulance and how proud he was to have
them in his command. The Honour list was quite sufficient to
satisfy any man. We got one D.S.O., two D.C.M.s, and sixteen
"Mentioned in Despatches." Many more deserved recognition, but then
all can't get it.</p>

<p>Major Meikle took charge, and I am sure the same good work will
be done under his command. Captain Dawson came over with me as
D.A.D.M.S. He had been Adjutant from the start until the landing,
when he "handed over" to Captain Finn, D.S.O., who was the dentist.
Major Clayton had charge of C Section; Captains Welch, Jeffries and
Kenny were the officers in charge of the Bearer Divisions. Jeffries
and Kenny were both wounded. Captain B. Finn, of Perth, Western
Australia, was a specialist in eye and ear diseases. Mr. Cosgrove
was the Quartermaster, and Mr. Baber the Warrant Officer; Sergeant
Baxter was the Sergeant Clerk. To mention any of the men
individually would be invidious. They were as fine a set of men as
one would desire to command. In fact, the whole Ambulance was a
very happy family, all doing their bit and doing it well.</p>

<p>On the 21st of August an attack was made on what were know as
the W Hills&mdash;so named from their resemblance to that letter of
the alphabet. Seated on a hill one had a splendid view of the
battle. First the Australians went forward over some open ground at
a slow double with bayonets fixed, not firing a shot; the Turks
gave them shrapnel and rifle-fire, but very few fell. They got
right up to the first Turkish trench, when all the occupants turned
out and retired with more speed than elegance. Still our men went
on, taking a few prisoners and getting close to the hills, over
which they disappeared from my view. Next, a battalion from Suvla
came across as supports. The Turks meanwhile had got the range to a
nicety; the shrapnel was bursting neatly and low and spreading
beautifully&mdash;it was the best Turkish shooting I had seen. The
battalion was rather badly cut up, but a second body came across in
more open order than the others, and well under the control of
their officers; they took advantage of cover, and did not lose so
many men. The fight was more like those one sees in the illustrated
papers than any hitherto&mdash;shells bursting, men falling, and
bearers going out for the wounded. The position was gained and
held, but there was plenty of work for the Ambulance.</p>

<p>There were very few horses on the Peninsula, and those few
belonged to the Artillery. But at the time I speak of we had one
attached to the New Zealand and Australian Headquarters, to be used
by the despatch rider. Anzac, the Headquarters of General Birdwood,
was about two and a half miles away; and, being a true Australian,
the despatch-carrier declined to walk when he could ride, so he
rode every day with despatches. Part of the journey had to be made
across a position open to fire from Walker's Ridge. We used to
watch for the man every day, and make bets whether he would be hit.
Directly he entered the fire zone, he started as if he were riding
in the Melbourne Cup, sitting low in the saddle, while the bullets
kicked up dust all round him. One day the horse returned alone, and
everyone thought the man had been hit at last; but in about an
hour's time he walked in. The saddle had slipped, and he came off
and rolled into a sap, whence he made his way to us on foot.</p>

<p>When going through the trenches it is not a disadvantage to be
small of stature. It is not good form to put one's head over the
sandbags; the Turks invariably objected, and even entered their
protest against periscopes, which are very small in size. Numbers
of observers were cut about the face and a few lost their eyes
through the mirror at the top being smashed by a bullet. On one
occasion I was in a trench which the men were making deeper. A rise
in the bottom of it just enabled me, by standing on it, to peer
through the loophole. On commending the man for leaving this lump,
he replied, "That's a dead Turk, sir!"</p>

<h2><a name="artillery" id="artillery">ARTILLERY</a>
</h2>

<p>Watching the Field Artillery firing is very interesting. I went
one day with General Johnstone of the New Zealand Artillery to
Major Standish's Battery, some distance out on the left, and the
observing station was reached through a long sap. It was quite
close to the Turk's trenches, close enough to see the men's faces.
All directions were given by telephone, and an observer placed on
another hill gave the result of the shot&mdash;whether under, over,
or to the right or left. Errors were corrected and the order to
fire again given, the target meanwhile being quite out of sight of
the battery commander.</p>

<p>It was amusing to hear the heated arguments between the
Artillery and Infantry, in which the latter frequently and
vehemently asseverated that they "could have taken the sanguinary
place only our own Artillery fired on them." They invariably
supported these arguments by the production of pieces of shell
which had "blanky near put their Australian adjective lights out."
Of course the denials of the Artillery under these accusations were
very emphatic; but the production of the shell-fragments was
awkward evidence, and it was hard to prove an alibi.</p>

<p>The advent of the hospital ship <i>Maheno</i> resulted in a
pleasant addition to our dietary, as the officers sent ashore some
butter, fresh bread and a case of apples. The butter was the first
I had tasted for four and a half months. The <i>Maheno</i> belonged
to the Union Company, and had been fitted up as a hospital ship
under the command of Colonel Collins. He was the essence of
hospitality, and a meal on board there was a dream.</p>

<p>While we were away along the beach for a swim one afternoon, the
Turks began shelling our quarters. It had not happened previously,
and everyone thought we were out of range. The firing lasted for
about an hour and a half. I fully expected that the whole place
would be smashed. On the contrary, beyond a few mules and three men
hit, nothing had happened, and there was little in the ground to
show the effects of the firing. (I noticed the same with regard to
the firing of the naval guns. They appeared to lift tons of earth,
but when one traversed the position later very little alteration
could be detected.) The Turks, however started at night again, and
one shot almost buried me in my dug-out.</p>

<p>The number of transports that came in and out of Anzac while we
were there was marvellous, and a great tribute to the British Navy.
There is no question as to who is Mistress of the Sea. Occasionally
we heard of one being torpedoed, but considering the number
constantly going to and fro those lost were hardly noticeable. The
<i>Southland</i> was torpedoed while we were in Gallipoli, and
Major Millard (who was on board) told me that there was not the
slightest confusion, and only one life was lost.</p>

<h2><a name="fighters" id="fighters">TURKS AS FIGHTERS</a>
</h2>

<p>One cannot conclude these reminiscences without paying a tribute
to Abdul as a fighting man. All I know about him is in his favour.
We have heard all about his atrocities and his perfidy and
unspeakablenesses, but the men we met fought fairly and squarely;
and as for atrocities it is always well to hear the other side of
the question. At the beginning of the campaign it was commonly
reported that the Turks mutilated our wounded. Now I believe that
to be an unmitigated lie, probably given a start by men who had
never set foot in the Peninsula&mdash;or who, if they did, had
taken an early opportunity of departure. We were in a position to
know whether any mutilation had occurred, and I certainly saw none.
I believe that similar reports were existent among the Turks
regarding us, and I formed that opinion from the attitude and
behaviour of one of the prisoners when I went to dress his wound.
He uttered most piteous cries and his conduct led me to believe
that he thought he was to be illtreated. I have mentioned before
the class to which most of the prisoners were. They were always
most grateful for any kindness shown them.</p>

<p>As to their sense of fair play, when the <i>Triumph</i> was
sunk, they never fired on her&mdash;though I understand it would
have been quite allowable directly the men set foot on another
warship. Again, about a fortnight after the landing at Anzac, we
tried to land a force at Gaba Tepe, but had to retire and leave our
wounded. The Turks signalled us to bring them off, and then they
never fired or abused the white flag. The third instance occurred
on our left, when we made the advance in August. Our Ambulance was
under a hill, and a howitzer battery took up a position just in
front. The Turk <i>sent word</i> that either the Ambulance or the
battery would have to move, otherwise they would be forced to fire
on the Ambulance.</p>

<p>The shells we got on the beach could not be attributed to any
disregard of the Red Cross, for they could not see the flag, and
moreover the Ordnance was next to us, a thing utterly out of order,
but unavoidable under the circumstances.</p>

<p>My career on the Peninsula came to a close at the end of
September, when I fell ill and was put on the hospital ship. The
same evening a very willing attack was put up by the Turk. One had
a good and most interesting view, as one was in perfect safety. The
bursting shells in the darkness were very picturesque.</p>

<p>Prior to going off we had often discussed the pleasure of
getting between sheets and into a decent bed&mdash;how one would
curl up and enjoy it. But my first night under those conditions was
spent in tossing about, without a wink of sleep. It was too quiet.
Being accustomed to be lulled to sleep by the noise of six-inch
guns from a destroyer going over my dug-out, I could now hear a pin
drop, and it was far too quiet. We found we were to be sent to
England. Malta was no place in which to get rid of Mediterranean
fever. The treatment the people of England give the Australians is
handsome in the extreme. They cannot do enough to make them
comfortable. Country houses are thrown open to the invalided men,
perfect strangers though they are, and all are welcome.</p>

<p>Together with Major Courtenay (with whom I came over) I was
taken to Lockleys, in Hertfordshire. Sir Evelyn and Lady de La Rue
had a standing invitation at Horseferry Road, the Australian
Military Headquarters, for six officers. We happened to be among
the lucky ones to be included, and the kindness I received from our
host and hostess will be remembered during the remainder of my
life.</p>
