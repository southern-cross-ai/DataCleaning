  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</b></h2>
  <p>No introduction to Mrs. Langloh Parker&rsquo;s book can be more than that
  superfluous &lsquo;bush&rsquo; which, according to the proverb, good wine
  does not need. Our knowledge of the life, manners, and customary laws of
  many Australian tribes has, in recent years, been vastly increased by the
  admirable works of Mr. Howitt, and of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen. But Mrs.
  Parker treats of a tribe which, hitherto, has hardly been mentioned by anthropologists,
  and she has had unexampled opportunities of study. It is hardly possible
  for a scientific male observer to be intimately familiar with the women and
  children of a savage tribe. Mrs. Parker, on the other hand, has had, as regards
  the women and children of the Euahlayi, all the advantages of the squire&rsquo;s
  wife in a rural neighbourhood, supposing the squire&rsquo;s wife to be an
  intelligent and sympathetic lady, with a strong taste for the study of folklore
  and rustic custom. Among the Zulus, we know, it is the elder women who tell
  the popular tales, so carefully translated and edited by Bishop Colenso.
  Mrs. Parker has already published two volumes of Euahlayi tales, though I
  do not know that I have ever seen them cited, except by myself, in anthropological
  discussion. As they contain many beautiful and romantic touches, and references
  to the Euahlayi &lsquo;All Father,&rsquo; or paternal &lsquo;super man,&rsquo; Byamee,
  they may possibly have been regarded as dubious materials, dressed up for
  the European market. Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s new volume, I hope, will prove that
  she is a close scientific observer, who must be reckoned with by students.
  She has not scurried through the region occupied by her tribe, but has had
  them constantly under her eyes for a number of years.</p>
  <p>My own slight share in the book as it stands ought to be mentioned. After
  reading the original MS., I catechised Mrs. Parker as to her amount of knowledge
  of the native language; her methods of obtaining information; and the chances
  that missionary influence had affected the Euahlayi legends and beliefs.
  I wrote out her answers, and she read and revised what I had written. I also
  collected many scattered notices of Byamee into the chapter on that being,
  which Mrs. Parker has read and approved. I introduced a reference to Mr.
  Howitt&rsquo;s theory of the &lsquo;All Father,&rsquo; and I added some references
  to other authorities on the Australian tribes. Except for this, and for a
  very few purely verbal changes in matter of style, Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s original
  manuscript is untouched by me. It seems necessary to mention these details,
  as I have, in other works, expressed my own opinions on Australian religion
  and customary law.[<i>Making Of Religion</i>, second edition; <i>Myth</i>, <i>Ritual,
  And Religion</i>, second edition.] These opinions I have not, so to speak,
  edited into the work of Mrs. Parker. The author herself has remarked that,
  beginning as a disciple of Mr. Herbert Spencer in regard to the religious
  ideas of the Australians&mdash;according to that writer, mere dread of casual &lsquo;spirits&rsquo;&mdash;she
  was obliged to alter her attitude, in consequence of all that she learned
  at first hand. She also explains that her tribe are not &lsquo;wild blacks,&rsquo; though,
  in the absence of missionary influences, they retain their ancient beliefs,
  at least the old people do; and, in a decadent form, preserve their tribal
  initiations, or Boorah. How she tested and controlled the evidence of her
  informants she has herself stated, and I venture to think that she could
  hardly have made a better use of her opportunities.</p>
  <p>In one point there is perhaps, almost unavoidably, a lacuna or gap in her
  information. The Euahlayi, she says, certainly do not possess the Dieri and
  Urabunna custom of Pirrauru or Piraungaru, by which married, and unmarried
  men, of the classes men and women which may intermarry, are solemnly allotted
  to each other as more or less permanent paramours.[See Mr. Howitt&rsquo;s <i>Native
  Tribes Of South-East Australia</i>, and my <i>Secret Of The Totem</i>, chapter
  iii.] That custom, for some unknown reason, is confined to certain tribes
  possessing the two social divisions with the untranslated names <i>Matteri</i> and <i>Kiraru</i>.
  These tribes range from Lake Eyre southward, perhaps, as far as the sea.
  Their peculiar custom is unknown to the Euahlayi, but Mrs. Parker does not
  inform us concerning any recognised licence which may, as is usual, accompany
  their Boorah assemblies, or their &lsquo;harvest home&rsquo; of gathered
  grass seed, which she describes.</p>
  <p>Any reader of Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s book who has not followed recent anthropological
  discussions, may need to be apprised of the nature of these controversies,
  and of the probable light thrown on them by the full description of the Euahlayi
  tribe. The two chief points in dispute are (1) the nature and origin of the
  marriage laws of the Australians; and (2) the nature and origin of such among
  their ideas and practices as may be styled &lsquo;religious.&rsquo; As far
  as what we commonly call material civilisation is concerned, the natives
  of the Australian continent are probably the most backward of mankind, having
  no agriculture, no domestic animals, and no knowledge of metal-working. Their
  weapons and implements are of wood, stone, and bone, and they have not even
  the rudest kind of pottery. But though the natives are all, in their natural
  state, on or about this common low level, their customary laws, ceremonials,
  and beliefs are rich in variety.</p>
  <p>As regards marriage rules they are in several <i>apparently</i> ascending
  grades of progress. First we have tribes in which each person is born into
  one or other of two social divisions usually called &lsquo;phratries.&rsquo; Say
  that the names of the phratries mean Eagle Hawk and Crow. Each born Crow
  must marry an Eagle Hawk; each born Eagle Hawk must marry a Crow. The names
  are derived through the mothers. One obvious result is that no two persons,
  brother and sister maternal, can intermarry; but the rule also excludes from
  intermarriage great numbers of persons in no way akin to each other by blood,
  who merely share the common phratry name, Crow or Eagle Hawk.</p>
  <p>In each phratry are smaller sets of persons, each set distinguished by the
  name of some animal or other natural object, their &lsquo;totem.&rsquo; The
  same totem is never found in <i>both</i> phratries. Thus a person marrying
  out of his or her phratry, as all must do, necessarily marries out of his
  or her totem.</p>
  <p>The same arrangements exist among tribes which derive phratry and totem
  names through the father.</p>
  <p>This derivation of names and descent through the father is regarded by almost
  all students, and by Mr. J. G. Frazer, in one passage of his latest study
  of the subject, as a great step in progress.[&lsquo;The Beginnings of Religion
  and Totemism among the Australian Aborigines,&rsquo; <i>Fortnightly Review</i>,
  September 1905, p. 452.] The obvious result of paternal descent is to make
  totem communities or kins <i>local</i>. In any district most of the people
  will be of the same paternal totem name&mdash;say, Grub, Iguana, Emu, or
  what not. Just so, in Glencoe of old, most of the people were MacIans; in
  Appin most were Stewarts; in South Argyll Campbells, and so on.</p>
  <p>The totem kins are thus, with paternal descent, united both by supposed
  blood ties in the totem kin, and by associations of locality. This is certainly
  a step in social progress.</p>
  <p>But while Mr. Frazer, with almost all inquirers, acknowledges this, ten
  pages later in his essay he no longer considers the descent of the totem
  in the paternal line as necessarily &lsquo;a step in progress&rsquo; from
  descent in the maternal line. &lsquo;The common assumption that inheritance
  of the totem through the mother always preceded inheritance of it through
  the father need not hold good,&rsquo;[<i>Ibid</i>. p. 462.] he remarks.</p>
  <p>Thus it appears that a tribe has not necessarily made &lsquo;a great step
  in progress,&rsquo; because it reckons descent of the totem on the male side.
  If this be so, we cannot so easily decide as to which tribe is socially advanced
  and which is not.</p>
  <p>In any case, however, there is a test of social advance. There is an acknowledged
  advance when a tribe is divided into, not two, but four or eight divisions,
  which may not intermarry.[<i>Ibid</i>. p. 454] The Euahlayi have four such
  divisions. In each of their intermarrying phratries are two &lsquo;Matrimonial
  Classes,&rsquo; each with its name, and these are so constituted that a member
  of the elder generation can never marry a member of the succeeding generation.
  This rule prevents, of course, marriage between parent and child, but such
  marriages never do occur in the pristine tribes of the Darling river which
  have no such classes. The four-class arrangement excludes from intermarriage
  all persons, whether parents and children or not, who bear the same class
  name, say Hippai.</p>
  <p>Among the central and northern tribes, from the Arunta of the Macdonnell
  hills to the Gulf of Carpentaria, the eight-class rule exists, and it is,
  confessedly, the most advanced of all.</p>
  <p>In this respect, then, the Arunta of the centre of Australia are certainly
  more advanced than the Euahlayi. The Arunta have eight, not four, intermarrying
  classes. In the matter of rites and ceremonies, too, they are, in the opinion
  of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, more advanced than, say, the Euahlayi. They
  practise universal &lsquo;subincision&rsquo; of the males, and circumcision,
  in place of the more primitive knocking out of the front teeth. Their ceremonies
  are very prolonged: in Messrs. Spencer and Gillen&rsquo;s experience, rites
  lasted for four months during a great tribal gathering. That the Arunta could
  provide supplies for so prolonged and large an assembly, argues high organisation,
  or a region well found in natural edible objects. Yet the region is arid
  and barren, so the organisation is very high. For all these reasons, even
  if we do not regard paternal descent of the totem as a step in progress from
  maternal descent, the Arunta seem greatly advanced in social conditions.</p>
  <p>Yet they are said to lack entirely that belief in a moral and kindly &lsquo;All
  Father,&rsquo; such as Byamee, which Mrs. Parker describes as potent among
  the less advanced Euahlayi, and which Mr. Howitt has found among non-coastal
  tribes of the south-east, with female descent of the totem, but without matrimonial
  classes&mdash;that is, among the most primitive tribes of all.</p>
  <p>Here occurs a remarkable difficulty. Mr. Howitt asserts, with Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s
  concurrence, that (in Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s words) &lsquo;the same regions in
  which the germs of religion begin to appear have also made some progress
  towards a higher form of social and family life.&rsquo;[&lsquo;The Beginnings
  of Religion and Totemism among the Australian Aborigines,&rsquo; <i>Fortnightly
  Review</i>, September 1905, p. 452.] But the social advance from maternal
  to paternal descent of the totem, we have seen, is not necessarily an advance
  at all, in Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s opinion.[ <i>Ibid</i>. p. 462.] The Arunta,
  for example, he thinks, never recognised female descent of the totem. They
  have never recognised, indeed, he thinks, any hereditary descent of the totem,
  though in all other respects, as in hereditary magistracies, and inheritance
  of the right to practise the father&rsquo;s totemic ritual, they do reckon
  in the male line. By such advantage, however it was acquired, they are more
  progressive than, say, the Euahlayi. But, progressive as they are, they have
  not, like the more pristine tribes of the south-east, developed &lsquo;the
  germs of religion,&rsquo; the belief in a benevolent or ruling &lsquo;All
  Father.&rsquo; Unlike the tribes of the south-east, they have co-operative
  totemic magic. Each totem community does magic for its totem, as part of
  the food supply of the united tribe. But the tribe, though so <i>solidaire</i>,
  and with its eight classes and hereditary magistracies so advanced, has developed
  no germs of religion at all. Arunta progress has thus been singularly unequal.</p>
  <p>The germs of religion are spoken of as the results of social advance, but,
  while so prominent in social advance, the Arunta have no trace of religion.
  The tribes northward from them to the sea are also very advanced socially,
  but (with one known exception not alluded to by Mr. Frazer) have no &lsquo;All
  Father,&rsquo; no germ of religion.</p>
  <p>From this fact, if correctly reported, it is obvious that social progress
  is not the cause, nor the necessary concomitant, of advance in religious
  ideas.</p>
  <p>Again, the influence of the sea, in causing a &lsquo;heavier rainfall, a
  more abundant vegetation, and a more plentiful supply of food,&rsquo; with
  an easier and more reflective life than that of &lsquo;the arid wilderness
  of the interior,&rsquo; cannot be, as is alleged, the cause of the germs
  of religion.[<i>Ibid</i>. p. 463.] If this were the case, the coastal tribes
  of the Gulf of Carpentaria and of the north generally would have developed
  the All Father belief. Yet, in spite of their coastal environment, and richer
  existence, and social advance, the northern coastal tribes are not credited
  with the belief in the All Father. Meanwhile tribes with no matrimonial classes,
  and with female descent of the totem&mdash;tribes dwelling from five to seven
  hundred miles away from the southern sea&mdash;do possess the All Father
  belief as far north as Central Queensland, no less than did the almost or
  quite extinct tribes of the south coast, who had made what is (or is not) &lsquo;the
  great step in progress&rsquo; of paternal descent of the totem.</p>
  <p>Again, arid and barren as is the central region tenanted by the Arunta,
  it seems to permit or encourage philosophic reflection, for their theory
  of evolution is remarkably coherent and ingenious. The theory of evolution
  implies as much reflection as that of creation! Their magic for the behoof
  of edible objects is attributed to the suddenness of their first rains,[<i>Ibid</i>.
  p. 465.] and the consequent outburst of life, which the natives attribute
  to their own magical success. But rainmaking magic, as Mrs. Langloh Parker
  shows, is practised with sometimes amazing success among the Euahlayi, who
  work no magic at all for their totems. Their magic, if it brings rain, benefits
  their totems at large, but for each totem in particular, no Euahlayi totem
  kin does magic.</p>
  <p>Again, agricultural magic has been, and indeed is, practised in Europe,
  in conditions of climate unlike those of the Arunta; and totemic magic is
  freely practised in North America, in climatic conditions dissimilar from
  those of Central Australia.</p>
  <p>For all these reasons I must confess that I do not follow the logic of the
  philosophy which makes social advance the cause of the belief in the All
  Father, and coastal rains the cause of social advance. The Arunta have the
  social advance, the eight classes, the relatively high organisation; but
  they have neither the climatic conditions supposed to produce the advance,
  nor the religion which the advance is supposed to produce. The northern coastal
  tribes, again, have the desired climatic conditions, and the social advance,
  but they have not the germs of religion found in many far inland southern
  tribes, like the Euahlayi, whose social progress is extremely moderate. We
  thus find, from the northern coast to the centre, one supposed result of
  coastal conditions, namely, social progress, but not the other supposed result
  of coastal conditions, namely, the All Father belief. I do not say that it
  does not exist, for it is a secret belief, but it is not reported by Messrs.
  Spencer and Gillen. On the other hand, among tribes of the south-east very
  far from the coast, we find the lowest grades of social progress, but we
  also find the All Father belief. I am ready, of course, to believe that good
  conditions of life beget progress, social and religious, as a general rule.
  But other causes exist; speculation anywhere may take crudely scientific
  rather than crudely religious lines. Especially the belief in ancestral spirits
  may check or nullify the belief in a remote All Father. We see this among
  the Zulus, where spirits entirely dominate religion, and the All Father is,
  at most, the shadow of a name, Unkulunkulu. We may detect the same influence
  among the northern tribes of Australia, where ancestral spirits dominate
  thought and society, though they receive no sacrifice or prayer. Meanwhile,
  if we accept Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s evidence, among the Euahlayi ancestral spirits
  are of no account in religion, while the All Father is obeyed, and, on some
  occasions, is addressed in prayer; and may even cause rain, if property approached
  by a human spirit which has just entered his mansions. Clearly, climatic
  causes and natural environment are not the only factors in producing and
  directing the speculative ideas of men in early society.</p>
  <p>We must also remember that the neighbours of the Arunta, northwards, who
  share certain peculiar Arunta ideas, possess, beyond all doubt, either the
  earliest germs of belief in the All Father, or that belief in a decadent
  condition of survival. This is quite certain; for, whereas the Arunta laugh
  at all inquiries as to what went before the &lsquo;Alcheringa,&rsquo; or
  mythic age of evolution, the Kaitish, according to Messrs. Spencer and Gillen,
  aver that an anthropomorphic being, who dwells above the sky, and is named
  Atnatu, first created himself, and then &lsquo;made the Alcheringa,&rsquo;&mdash;the
  mythic age of primal evolution. Of mankind, some, in Kaitish opinion, were
  evolved; of others Atnatu is the father. He expelled men to earth from his
  heaven for neglect of his ceremonies, but he provided them with weapons and
  all that they possess. He is not <i>Tr&egrave;s Ferr&eacute; Sur La Morale</i>:
  he has made no <i>moral</i> laws, but his <i>ritual</i> laws, as to circumcision
  and the whirling of the bull-roarer, must be observed as strictly as the
  ritual laws of Byamee of the Euahlayi. In this sense of obedience due to
  a heavenly father who begat men, or some of them, punished them, and started
  them on their terrene career, laying down ceremonial rules, we have certainly &lsquo;the
  germs of religion&rsquo; in a central tribe cognate to the Arunta.</p>
  <p>Mr. Frazer detects only two traces of religion in the centre, omitting the
  Kaitish Atnatu, [&lsquo;The Beginnings of Religion and Totemism among the
  Australian Aborigines,&rsquo; <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, September 1905,
  p. 452, Note 1.] but I am unable to see how the religious aspect of Atnatu,
  non-moral as it is, can be overlooked. He is the father of part of the tribe,
  and all are bound to observe his ceremonial rules. He accounts for the beginning
  of the beginning; he is the cause of the Alcheringa; men owe duties to him.
  We do not know whether he was once as potent in their hearts, and as moral
  as Byamee, but has <i>d&eacute;gringol&eacute;</i> under Arunta philosophic
  influences; or whether Byamee is a more highly evolved form of Atnatu. But
  it is quite certain that the Kaitish, in a region as far almost from the
  north sea as that of the Arunta, and further from southern coastal influences
  than the Arunta, have a modified belief in the All Father. How are we to
  account for this on the philosophic hypothesis of Oceanus as the father of
  all the gods; of coastal influences producing a richer life, and causing
  both social and religious progress?</p>
  <p>Another difficulty is that while the Arunta, with no religion, and the Kaitish,
  with the Atnatu belief, are socially advanced in organisation (whether we
  reckon male descent of the totem &lsquo;a great step in progress,&rsquo; or
  an accident), they are yet supposed by Mr. Frazer to be, in one respect,
  the least advanced, the most primitive, of known human beings. The reason
  is this: the Arunta do not recognise the processes of sexual union as the
  cause of the production of children. Sexual acts, they say, merely prepare
  women for the reception of original ancestral spirits, which enter into them,
  and are reincarnated and brought to the birth.</p>
  <p>If the women cannot accept the spirits without being &lsquo;prepared&rsquo; by
  sexual union, then sexual union plays a physical part in the generation of
  a spirit incarnated, a fact which all believers in the human soul are as
  ready as the Arunta to admit. If the Arunta recognise the prior necessity
  of &lsquo; preparation,&rsquo; then they are not so ignorant as they are
  thought to be; and their view is produced, not so much by stark ignorance,
  as by their philosophy of the eternal reincarnation of primal human spirits.
  The Arunta philosophers, in fact, seem to concentrate their speculation on
  a point which puzzled Mr. Shandy. How does the animating principle, or soul,
  regarded as immaterial, clothe itself in flesh? Material acts cannot effect
  the incarnation of a spirit. Therefore, the spirit enters women from without,
  and is not the direct result of human action.</p>
  <p>The south-eastern tribes, with female descent of the totem, and with no
  belief in the universal and constant reincarnation of ancestral spirits,
  take the &lsquo;schylean view, according to Mr. Howitt, that the male is
  the sole originating cause of children, while the female is only the recipient
  and &lsquo;nurse.&rsquo; These tribes, socially less advanced than the Arunta,
  have not the Arunta nescience of the facts of procreation, a nescience which
  I regard as merely the consequence and corollary of the Arunta philosophy
  of reincarnation. Each Arunta child, by that philosophy, has been in being
  since the Alcheringa: his mother of the moment only reproduces him, after &lsquo;preparation.&rsquo; He
  is not a new thing; he is as old as the development of organic forms. This
  is the Arunta belief, and I must reckon it as not more primitive than the
  peculiar philosophy of reincarnation of ancestral spirits. Certainly such
  an elaborate philosophy manifestly cannot be primitive. It is, however, the
  philosophy of the tribes from the Urabunna, on Lake Eyre (with female descent
  of the totem), to the most northerly tribes, with male descent.</p>
  <p>But among none of these tribes has the philosophy that extraordinary effect
  on totemic institutions which, by a peculiar and isolated addition, it possesses
  among the septs of the Arunta nation, and in a limited way among the Kaitish.</p>
  <p>Among all tribes except these the child <i>inherits</i> its totem: from
  the mother, among the Urabunna; from the father in the northern peoples.
  But, among the Arunta and Kaitish, the totem is not inherited from either
  parent. According to the belief of these tribes, in every district there
  is a place where the first human ancestors&mdash;in each case all of one
  totem, whichsoever that totem, in each case, might happen to be&mdash;died, &lsquo;went
  under the earth.&rsquo; Rocks or trees arose to mark such spots. These places
  are haunted by the spirits of the dead ancestors; here they are all Grubs,
  there all Eagle Hawks, or all Iguanas, or all Emus, or all Cats. Or as in
  these sites the ancestors left each his own sacred stone, <i>churinga nanja</i>,
  with archaic patterns inscribed on it, patterns now fancifully interpreted
  as totemic inscriptions. Such stones are especially haunted by the ancestral
  souls, all desiring reincarnation.</p>
  <p>When a woman becomes aware of the life of the child she bears, among the
  Arunta and Kaitish, she supposes that a local spirit of the local totem has
  entered her, and her child&rsquo;s totem is therefore the totem of that locality,
  whatever other totems she and her husbands may own. The stone amulet of the
  ancestral spirit, <i>who is the child</i>, is sought; if it cannot be found
  at the spot, a wooden <i>churinga</i> is made to represent it, and it is
  kept carefully in a sacred storehouse.</p>
  <p>Even in the centre and north, where the belief in reincarnation prevails,
  this odd manner of acquiring totems is only practised by the Arunta tribes
  and the Kaitish, and only among them are the inscribed stones known to exist
  as favoured haunts of ancestral spirits desiring incarnation. The other northern
  tribes believe in reincarnation, but not in the haunted sacred stones, which
  they do not, north of the Worgaia, possess; nor do they derive totems from
  locality, but, as usual, by inheritance.</p>
  <p>It thus appears that these Arunta sacred stones are an inseparable accident
  of the Arunta method of acquiring the totem. How they and the faith in them
  cause that method is not obvious, but the two things&mdash;the haunted sacred
  stone, and the local source of totems&mdash;are inseparable&mdash;that is,
  the former never is found apart from the latter. Now such stones, with the
  sense and usage attached to them, cannot well be primitive. They are the
  result of the peculiar and strictly isolated Arunta custom and belief, which
  gives to each man and woman one of these stones, the property of himself
  or herself, since the mythical age, through all reincarnations.</p>
  <p>One cannot see how such an unique custom and belief, associated with objects
  of art, can be reckoned primitive. Yet, where such stones do not exist, the
  usage of acquiring totems by locality does not exist; even where the belief
  in reincarnation and in local centres haunted by totemic spirits is found
  in North Australia.[For an hypothesis of the origin of the <i>Churinga Nanja</i> belief,
  see my<i> Secret Of The Totem</i>, chapter iv.]</p>
  <p>On these grounds it appears that the hereditary totem is the earlier, and
  that the Arunta usage is the result of the special and inseparable superstition
  about the sacred stones. It may be a relatively recent complication of and
  addition to the theory of reincarnation. Meanwhile, the belief and usage
  produce an unique effect. The Arunta and Kaitish, we saw, are so advanced
  socially that they possess not two, or four, but eight matrimonial classes.
  The tribe is divided into two sets of four classes each, and no person in
  A division (nameless) of four classes may marry another person of any one
  of these four, but must marry a person of a given class among the four in
  B division (nameless). The succession to the class is hereditary in the male
  line. But any person among the Arunta, contrary to universal custom elsewhere,
  may marry another person of his or her own totem, if that person be in the
  right class of the opposite division. Nowhere else can a person of division
  A and totem Grub find a Grub to marry in the opposite division B. But this
  is possible among the Arunta and Kaitish, because their totems are acquired
  by pure accident, are not hereditary, and all totems exist, or may exist,
  in division A and also in division B.</p>
  <p>Mr. Frazer argues that the Arunta is the earlier state of affairs. He supposes
  that men acquired their totems, at first, by local accident, before they
  had laid any restrictions on marriage. Later, they divided their tribe, first
  into two, then into four, then into eight classes; and every one had to marry
  out of his class, or set of classes. All other known tribes introduced these
  restrictions after totems had been made hereditary. On passing the restrictive
  marriage law, they merely drafted people of one set of hereditary totems
  into one division, all the other totem kins into the other division. But
  the Arunta had not made totems hereditary, but accidental, so all the children
  of one crowd of mothers were placed in division A, all other children in
  division B. The mothers in each division would have children of all the totems,
  and thus the same totems now appeared in both of the exogamous divisions.
  If a man married into his lawful opposite class, the fact that the woman
  was of the same totem made no difference.</p>
  <p>I have offered quite an opposite explanation. Arunta totems were, originally,
  hereditary among the Arunta, as everywhere else, and no totem occurred in
  both exogamous divisions. The same totems, later, got into both divisions
  as the result of the later and isolated belief in reincarnation <i>plus</i> the
  sacred haunted stones. That superstition has left the Kaitish <i>practice</i> of
  marriage still almost untouched. A Kaitish <i>may</i>, like an Arunta, marry
  a woman of his own totem, but he scarcely ever does so. The old prohibition,
  extinct in law, persists in custom; unless we say that the Kaitish are now
  merely imitating the usual practice of the rest of the totemic races of the
  world.</p>
  <p>Moreover, even among the Arunta, certain totems greatly preponderate in
  each of the two exogamous intermarrying divisions of the tribe. This must
  be because the present practice has not yet quite upset the ancient usage,
  by which no totem ever occurred in both divisions. There is even an Arunta
  myth asserting that this was so, but it is, of course, of no historical value
  as evidence. Here it is proper to give Mr. Frazer&rsquo;s contrary theory
  in his own words:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;This [Arunta] mode of determining the totem has all the appearance
  of extreme antiquity. For it ignores altogether the intercourse of the sexes
  as the cause of offspring, and further, it ignores the tie of blood on the
  maternal as well as the paternal side, substituting for it a purely local
  bond, since the members of a totem stock are merely those who gave the first
  sign of life in the womb at one or other of certain definite spots. This
  form of totemism, which may be called conceptional or local to distinguish
  it from hereditary totemism, may with great probability be regarded as the
  most primitive known to exist at the present day, since it seems to date
  from a time when blood relationship was not yet recognised, and when even
  the idea of paternity had not yet presented itself to the savage mind. Moreover,
  it is hardly possible that this peculiar form of local totemism, with its
  implied ignorance of such a thing as paternity at all, could be derived from
  hereditary totemism, whereas it is easy to understand how hereditary totemism,
  either in the paternal or in the maternal line, could be derived from it.
  Indeed, among the Umbaia and Gnanji tribes we can see at the present day
  how the change from local to hereditary totemism has been effected. These
  tribes, like the Arunta and Kaitish, believe that conception is caused by
  the entrance into a woman of a spirit who has lived in its disembodied state,
  along with other spirits of the same totem, at any one of a number of totem
  centres scattered over the country; but, unlike the Arunta and Kaitish, they
  almost always assign the father&rsquo;s totem to the child, even though the
  infant may have given the first sign of life at a place haunted by spirits
  of a different totem. For example, the wife of a snake man may first feel
  her womb quickened at a tree haunted by spirits of goshawk people; yet the
  child will not be a goshawk but a snake, like its father. The theory by which
  the Umbaia and Gnanji reconcile these apparently inconsistent beliefs is
  that a spirit of the husband&rsquo;s totem follows the wife and enters into
  her wherever an opportunity offers, whereas spirits of other totems would
  not think of doing so. In the example supposed, a snake spirit is thought
  to have followed up the wife of the snake man and entered into her at the
  tree haunted by goshawk spirits, while the goshawk spirits would refuse to
  trespass, so to say, on a snake preserve by quartering themselves in the
  wife of a snake man. This theory clearly marks a transition from local to
  hereditary totemism in the paternal line. And precisely the same theory could, <i>mutatis
  mutandis</i>, be employed to effect a change from local to hereditary totemism
  in the maternal line; it would only be necessary to suppose that a pregnant
  woman is always followed by a spirit of her own totem, which sooner or later
  effects a lodgement in her body. For example, a pregnant woman of the bee
  totem would always be followed by a bee spirit, which would enter into her
  wherever and whenever she felt her womb quickened, and so the child would
  be born of her own bee totem. Thus the local form of totemism, which obtains
  among the Arunta and Kaitish tribes, is older than the hereditary form, which
  is the ordinary type of totemism in Australia and elsewhere, first, because
  it rests on far more archaic conceptions of society and of life; and, secondly,
  because both the hereditary kinds of totemism, the paternal and the maternal,
  can be derived from it, whereas it can hardly be derived from either of them.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This argument appears to take for granted that the conception of primal
  ancestral spirits, perpetually reincarnated, is primitive. But, in fact,
  we seem to know it, among Australian tribes, only in these which have advanced
  to the possession of eight classes, and have made &lsquo;the great step in
  progress&rsquo; (if it is a great step), of descent of the totem in the
  paternal line. The Urabunna, with female descent of the totem, have, it is
  true, the belief in reincarnation. But they intermarry with the Arunta, borrow
  their sacred stones, and practise the same advanced rites and ceremonies.
  The idea may thus have been borrowed. On the other hand, the more pristine
  tribes of the south-east, with two or four exogamous divisions, and with
  female descent of the totem, have no known trace of the doctrine of reincarnation
  (except as displayed by the Euahlayi), and have no doubt that the father
  is the cause of procreation, save in the case of the Euahlayi, who believe
  that the Moon and the Crow &lsquo;make&rsquo; the new children.</p>
  <p>It would thus appear that the central and northern belief in perpetual reincarnation
  of primal spirits is not primitive, yet the Arunta method of acquiring totems
  does not exist save by grace of this belief, <i>plus</i> the isolated belief
  in primal sacred stones.</p>
  <p>I am obliged to differ from Mr. Frazer when he says that &lsquo;it is easy
  to see how hereditary totemism, either in the paternal or in the maternal
  line, would be derived from&rsquo; the Arunta belief and practice, whereas &lsquo;it
  is hardly possible that this peculiar form of local totemism [Arunta], with
  its implied ignorance of such a thing as paternity at all, could be derived
  from hereditary totemism.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I do not know whether the other northern tribes share the Arunta nescience
  of procreation, or not. Whether they do or do not, it was as easy for them
  to explain all difficulties by a reconciling myth&mdash;a spirit of the husband&rsquo;s
  totem follows his wife&mdash;as for a white <i>savant</i> to frame an hypothesis.
  The Urabunna, with female descent of the totem, have quite another myth&mdash;to
  reconcile everything. Nothing can be more easy. Supposing the Arunta to have
  begun, as in my theory, with hereditary totemism, the rise of their isolated
  belief in spirit-haunted sacred stones, encroached on and destroyed the hereditary
  character of their totemism. The belief in <i>churinga nanja</i> is an isolated
  freak, but it has done its work, while leaving traces of an earlier state
  of things, as we have shown, both among the Kaitish and Arunta.</p>
  <p>If I am right in differing from such a master of many legions as the learned
  author of <i>The Golden Bough</i>, the irreligion of the Arunta and northern
  tribes (if these be really without religion) is the result of their form
  of speculation, wholly occupied by the idea of reincarnation, while the Arunta
  form of totemism is the consequence of an isolated fantasy about their peculiar
  sacred stones. Meanwhile the Euahlayi, as Mrs. Parker proves, entertain,
  in a limited way, not elsewhere recorded in Australia, the belief in the
  reincarnation of the souls of uninitiated young people. They also, like the
  Arunta, recognise haunted trees and rocks, but the haunting spirits do not
  desire reincarnation, and are not ancestral. Spirits of the dead go to one
  or other abode of souls, to Baiame, or far from his presence to a place of
  pain. So limited is human fancy, that here, as in Beckford&rsquo;s picture
  of hell in <i>Vathek</i>, each spirit eternally presses his hand against
  his side. Were this a Christian doctrine, the Euahlayi would be said to have
  borrowed it, but few will accuse them of plagiarising from Beckford. These
  myths, like all myths, are not consistent. Baiame may change a soul into
  a bird.</p>
  <p>We may ask whether, with their limited belief in reincarnation, and with
  their haunted Minggah trees and rocks, the Euahlayi have set up a creed which
  might possibly develop into the northern faith, or whether they once held
  the northern faith, and have almost emerged from it. Without further information
  about intermediate tribes and their ideas on these matters, the question
  cannot be answered. We are also without data as to whether the nearly extinct
  southern coastal tribes evolved the All Father belief, and transmitted it
  to the Euahlayi, to some Queensland tribe, with their Mulkari, and even to
  the Kaitish, or whether the faith has been independently developed among
  the tribes with no matrimonial classes and the others. Conjecture is at present
  useless.</p>
  <p>In one respect a discovery of Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s is unfavourable to my
  theories. In <i>The Secret Of The Totem</i> I have shown that, when the names
  of the phratry divisions of the tribes can be interpreted, they prove to
  be names of animals, and I have shown how this may have come to be the case.
  But among the Euahlayi the phratry names mean &lsquo;light blood&rsquo; and &lsquo;dark
  blood.&rsquo; This, <i>prima facie</i>, seems to favour the theory of the
  Rev. Mr. Mathews, in his <i>Eagle Hawk and Crow</i>, that two peoples, lighter
  and darker, after an age of war, made <i>connubium</i> and marriage treaty,
  whence came the phratries. The same author might urge, if he pleased, that
  Eagle Hawk (about the colour of the peregrine) was chosen to represent &lsquo;light,&rsquo; and
  Crow to represent &lsquo;dark&rsquo;; while the phratry animals, White and
  Black Cockatoo, were selected, elsewhere, to represent the same contrast.
  But we need more information as to the meanings of other phratry names which
  have defied translation.</p>
  <p>In many other things, as in the account of the <i>yunbeai</i> of the Euahlayi,
  their mode of removing the tabu on the totem in food, their magic, their &lsquo;multiplex
  totems,&rsquo; their methods of hunting, their initiatory ceremonies, their
  highly moral lullabies, and the whole of their kindly life, Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s
  book appears to deserve a welcome from the few who care to study the ways
  of early men, &lsquo;the pit whence we were dug.&rsquo; The Euahlayi are
  a sympathetic people, and have found a sympathetic chronicler.<br>
 &nbsp;A. Lang</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter1"></a>Chapter 1<br>
  Introductory</b></h2>
  <p>The following pages are intended as a contribution to the study of the manners,
  customs, beliefs, and legends of the Aborigines of Australia. The area of
  my observation is mainly limited to the region occupied by the Euahlayi tribe
  of north-western New South Wales, who for twenty years were my neighbours
  on the Narran River. I have been acquainted since childhood with the natives,
  first in southern South Australia; next on my father&rsquo;s station on the
  Darling River, where I was saved by a native girl, when my sisters were drowned
  while bathing. I was intimate with the dispositions of the blacks, and was
  on friendly terms with them, before I began a regular attempt to inquire
  into their folk-lore and customary laws, at my husband&rsquo;s station on
  the Narran, due north of the Barwon River, the great affluent of the Murray
  River.</p>
  <p>My tribe is a neighbour of that mentioned by Mr. Howitt as the &lsquo;Wollaroi,&rsquo; &lsquo;Yualloroi,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Yualaroi.&rsquo;[Howitt, <i>Native
   Tribes Of South-East Australia</i>, pp. 57, 467, 694, 769.] I spell the
   tribal name &lsquo;Euahlayi&rsquo;; the accent is on the second syllable&mdash;&rsquo;You-ahl-ayi&rsquo;;
   and the name is derived from the tribal word for the negative: <i>Euahl</i>,
   or <i>Youal</i>, &lsquo;No,&rsquo; as in the case of the Kamilaroi (Kamil, &lsquo;No&rsquo;),
   and many other tribes.</p>
  <p>Mr. Howitt regards these tribes as on the limits of what he calls the &lsquo;Four
  Sub-Class&rsquo; system. The people, that is to say, have not only the division
  into two &lsquo;phratries,&rsquo; or &lsquo;exogamous moieties,&rsquo; intermarrying,
  but also the four &lsquo;Matrimonial Classes&rsquo; further regulating marriage.
  These classes bear the Kamilaroi names, of unknown meaning, Ipai, Kumbo,
  Murri, and Kubbi; but the names of the two main divisions, or phratries,
  are not those of the Kamilaroi&mdash;<i>Dilbi</i> and <i>Kupathin</i>.</p>
  <p>The Euahlayi language, or dialect, is not identical with that of the great
  Kamilaroi tribe to their south-east, but is clearly allied with it, many
  names of animals being the same in both tongues. A few names of animals are
  shared with the Wir&aacute;djuri speech, as <i>Mullian</i>, Eagle Hawk; Pelican, <i>Goolayyahlee</i> (Wir&aacute;djuri, <i>Gulaiguli</i>).
  The term for the being called &lsquo;The All Father&rsquo; by Mr. Howitt
  is also the term used by the Wir djuri and Kamilaroi, &lsquo;Baiame&rsquo; or &lsquo;Byamee.&rsquo; The
  Euahlayi, however, possess myths, beliefs, and usages not recorded as extant
  among the Kamilaroi, but rather forming a link with the ideas of peoples
  dwelling much further west, such as the tribes, on Lake Eyre, and the southernmost
  Arunta of the centre. Thus, there is a limited and modified shape of the
  central and northern belief in reincarnation, and there is a great development
  of what are called by Mr. Howitt &lsquo;sub-totems,&rsquo; which have been
  found most in a region of Northern Victoria, to the south of the Euahlayi.
  There is a belief in spirit&mdash;haunted trees, as among the Arunta, and
  there is a form of the Arunta myth of the &lsquo;Dream Time,&rsquo; the
  age of pristine evolution.</p>
  <p>The Euahlayi thus present a mixture of ideas and usages which appears to
  be somewhat peculiar and deserving of closer study than it has received.
  Mr. Howitt himself refers to the tribe very seldom. It will be asked, &lsquo;How
  far have the Euahlayi been brought under the influence of missionaries, and
  of European ideas in general?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The nearest missionary settlement was founded after we settled among the
  Euahlayi, and was distant about one hundred miles, at Brewarrina. None of
  my native informants had been at any time, to my knowledge, under the influence
  of missionaries. They all wore shirts, and almost all of them trousers, on
  occasion; and all, except the old men, my chief sources, were employed by
  white settlers. We conversed in a kind of <i>lingua franca</i>. An informant,
  say Peter, would try to express himself in English, when he thought that
  I was not successful in following him in his own tongue. With Paddy, who
  had no English but a curse, I used two native women, one old, one younger,
  as interpreters, checking each other alternately. The younger natives themselves
  had lost the sense of some of the native words used by their elders, but
  the middle-aged interpreters were usually adequate. Occasionally there were
  disputes on linguistic points, when Paddy, a man already grey in 1845, would
  march off the scene, and need to be reconciled. They were on very good terms
  with me. They would exchange gifts with me: I might receive a carved weapon,
  and one of them some tobacco. The giving was not all on my side, by any means.</p>
  <p>My anthropological reading was scanty, but I was well acquainted with and
  believed in Mr. Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ghost theory&rsquo; of the
  origin of religion in the worship of ancestral spirits. What I learned from
  the natives surprised me, and shook my faith in Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s theory,
  with which it seemed incompatible.</p>
  <p>In hearing the old blacks tell their legends you notice a great difference
  between them as <i>raconteurs</i>&mdash;some tell the bare plot or feature
  of the legend, others give descriptive touches all through. If they are strangers
  to their audience, they get it over as quickly as possible in a half-contemptuous
  way, as if saying, &lsquo;What do you want to know such rubbish for?&rsquo; But
  if they know you well, and know you really are interested, then they tell
  you the stories as they would tell them to one another, giving them a new
  life and adding considerably to their poetical expression.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter2<br>
  The All Father, Byamee</b></h2>
  <p>As throughout the chapters on the customary laws, mysteries, and legends
  of the Euahlayi, there occur frequent mentions of a superhuman though anthropomorphic
  being named Byamee (in Kamilaroi and Wir djuri &lsquo;Baiame&rsquo;), it
  is necessary to give a preliminary account of the beliefs entertained concerning
  him. The name Byamee (usually spelled Baiame) occurs in Euahlayi, Kamilaroi,
  and Wir djuri; &lsquo;the Wir djuri language is spoken over a greater extent
  of territory than any other tongue in New South Wales.&rsquo;[R. H. Mathews, <i>J.
  A. I</i>., vol. xxxiv. p. 284.] The word occurs in the Rev. Mr. Ridley&rsquo;s <i>Gurre
  Kamilaroi</i>, an illustrated manual of Biblical instruction for the education
  of the Kamilaroi: Mr. Ridley translated our &lsquo;God&rsquo; by &lsquo;Baiame.&rsquo; He
  supposed that native term, which he found and did not introduce, to be a
  derivative from the verb <i>baia</i>, or <i>biai</i>, &lsquo;to make.&rsquo; Literally,
  however, at least in Euahlayi, the word <i>byamee</i> means &lsquo;great
  one.&rsquo; In its sense as the name of the All Father it is not supposed
  to be used by women or by the uninitiated. If it is necessary to speak to
  them of Byamee, he is called Boyjerh, which means Father, just as in the
  Theddora tribe the women speak of Darramulun as <i>Papang</i>, &lsquo;Father.&rsquo; [Howitt, <i>Native
  Tribes of South-East Australia</i>, p. 493.] Among the Euahlayi both women
  and the uninitiated use <i>byamee</i>, the adjective for &lsquo;great,&rsquo; in
  ordinary talk, though the more usual adjective answering to &lsquo;great&rsquo; is <i>boorool</i>,
  which occurs in Kamilaroi as well as in Euahlayi. The verb <i>baia</i> or<i> biai</i>,
  to make or shape, whence Mr. Ridley derived Baiame, is not known to me in
  Euahlayi. Wir djuri has <i>bai</i>, a footmark, and Byamee left footmarks
  on the rocks, but that is probably a chance coincidence.</p>
  <p>I was first told of Byamee, in whispers, by a very old native, Yudtha Dulleebah
  (Bald Head), said to have been already grey haired when Sir Thomas Mitchell
  discovered the Narran in 1846. My informant said that he was instructed as
  to Byamee in his first Boorah, or initiation. If he was early grey, say at
  thirty, in 1846, that takes his initiation back to 1830, when, as a matter
  of fact, we have contemporary evidence to the belief in Byamee, who is not
  of missionary importation, though after 1856 Christian ideas may, through
  Mr. Ridley&rsquo;s book, have been attached to his name by educated Kamilaroi.
  But he was a worshipful being, revealed in the mysteries, long before missionaries
  came, as all my informants aver.</p>
  <p>There has, indeed, been much dispute as to whether the Aborigines of Australia
  have any idea, or germ of an idea, of a God; anything more than vague beliefs
  about unattached spirits, mainly mischievous, who might be propitiated or
  scared away. Mr. Huxley maintained this view, as did Mr. Herbert Spencer.[<i>Ecclesiastical
  Institutions</i>, p. 674.] Both of these authors, who have great influence
  on popular opinion, omitted to notice the contradictory statement of Waitz,
  published in 1872. He credited the natives, in some regions, with belief
  in, and dances performed in honour of, a &lsquo;Good Being,&rsquo; and denied
  that the belief and rites were the result of European influence.[Waitz, <i>Anthropologie
  Der Natur&mdash;Volker</i>, vol. vi. pp. 796-798. Leipzig, 1872.] Mr. Tylor,
  admitting to some extent that the belief now exists, attributed it in part
  to the influence of missionaries and of white settlers.[Journal, Anthropological
  Institute, vol. xxi. p. 292 <i>et seq</i>.] &lsquo;Baiame,&rsquo; he held,
  was a word of missionary manufacture, introduced about 1830-1840. This opinion
  was controverted by Mr. Lang,[<i>Magic And Religion</i>, p. 25 sq. <i>Myth,
  Ritual, And Religion</i>, vol. ii. chap. xii., 1899.] and by Mr. N. W. Thomas.
  Mr. Thomas[<i>Man</i>, 1905, No. 28.] has produced the evidence of Henderson,
  writing in 1829-1830, for the belief in &lsquo;Piame&rsquo; or Byamee, or
  Baiame.[<i>Observations On The Colonies Of New South Wales And Van Dieman&rsquo;s
  Land</i>, p. 147.]</p>
  <p>In 1904 Mr. Howitt gave a great mass of evidence for the belief in what
  he calls an &lsquo;All Father&rsquo;: in many dialects styled by various
  names meaning &lsquo;Our Father,&rsquo; dwelling in or above the sky, and
  often receiving the souls of blacks who have been &lsquo;good.&rsquo; These
  ideas are not derived, Mr. Howitt holds, from Europeans, or developed out
  of ancestor-worship, which does not exist in the tribes. The belief is concealed
  from women, but communicated to lads at their initiation.[Howitt, <i>Native
  Tribes Of South-East Australia</i>, pp. 488-508.] The belief, in favourable
  circumstances, might develop, Mr. Howitt thinks, into what he speaks of as
  a &lsquo;religion,&rsquo; a &lsquo;recognised religion.&rsquo; Without asking
  how &lsquo;a recognised religion&rsquo; is to be defined, I shall merely
  tell what I have gathered as to the belief in Byamee among the Euahlayi.</p>
  <p>It may seem strange that I should know anything about a belief carefully
  kept from women, but I have even been privileged to hear &lsquo;Byamee&rsquo;s
  Song,&rsquo; which only the fully initiated may sing; an old black, as will
  later appear, did chant this old lay, now no longer understood, to myself
  and my husband. Moreover, the women of the Euahlayi have some knowledge of,
  and some means of, mystic access to Byamee, though they call him by another
  name.</p>
  <p>Byamee, in the first place, is to the Euahlayi what the &lsquo;Alcheringa&rsquo; or &lsquo;Dream
  time&rsquo; is to the Arunta. Asked for the reason why of anything, the Arunta
  answer, &lsquo;It was so in the Alcheringa.&rsquo; Our tribe have a subsidiary
  myth corresponding to that of the Alcheringa. There was an age, in their
  opinion, when only birds and beasts were on earth; but a colossal man and
  two women came from the remote north-east, changed birds and beasts into
  men and women, made other folk of clay or stone, taught them everything,
  and left laws for their guidance, then returned whence they came. This is
  a kind of &lsquo;Alcheringa&rsquo; myth, but whether this colossal man was
  Byamee or not, our tribe give, as the final answer to any question about
  the origin of customs, &lsquo;Because Byamee say so.&rsquo; Byamee declared
  his will, and that was and is enough for his children. At the Boorah, or
  initiatory ceremonies, he is proclaimed as &lsquo;Father of All, whose laws
  the tribes are now obeying.&rsquo; Byamee, at least in one myth (told also
  by the Wir djuri), is the original source of all totems, and of the law that
  people of the same totem may not intermarry, &lsquo;however far apart their
  hunting-grounds.&rsquo; I heard first in a legend, then received confirmation
  from all old blacks, that Byamee had a totem name for every part of his body,
  even to a different one for each finger and toe. And when he was passing
  on to fresh fields, he gave each kinship of the tribe he was leaving one
  of his totems. The usual version is, that to such as were metamorphosed from
  birds and animals he gave as totem the animal or whatever it was from which
  they were evolved. But no one dreams of claiming Byamee as a relation belonging
  to one clan; he is one apart and yet the father of all, even as Birrahgnooloo
  is mother of all and not related to any one clan; Cunnumbeillee, his other
  wife, had only one totem.</p>
  <p>Certainly woman is given a high place in their sacred lore. The chief wife
  of Byamee, Birrahgnooloo, is claimed as the mother of all, for she, like
  him, had a totem for each part of her body; no one totem can claim her, but
  all do.</p>
  <p>Mother of all, though mother of none in particular, she was not to be vulgarised
  by ordinary domestic relations, For those purposes Cunnumbeillee was at hand,
  as a bearer of children and a caterer. Yet it was Birrahgnooloo whom Byamee
  best loved and made his companion, giving her power and position which no
  other held. She too, like him, is partially crystallised in the sky-camp,
  where they are together; the upper parts of their bodies are as on earth;
  to her, those who want floods go, and when willing to grant their requests,
  she bids Cunnumbeillee start the flood-ball of flood rolling down the mountains.
  Cunnumbeillee, as has been said, had but one totem which her children derived
  from her.</p>
  <p>Byamee is the originator of things less archaic and important than totemism.
  There is a large stone fish-trap at Brewarrina, on the Barwan River. It is
  said to have been made by Byamee and his gigantic sons, just as later Greece
  attributed the walls of Tiryns to the Cyclops, or as Glasgow Cathedral has
  been explained in legend as the work of the Picts. Byamee also established
  the rule that there should be a common camping-ground for the various tribes,
  where, during the fishing festival, peace should be strictly kept, all meeting
  to enjoy the fish, and do their share towards preserving the fisheries.</p>
  <p>Byamee still exists. I have been told by an old native, as will be shown
  later, that prayers for the souls of the dead used to be addressed to Byamee
  at funerals; certainly not a practice derived from Protestant missionaries.</p>
  <p>Byamee is supposed to listen to the cry of an orphan for rain. Such an one
  has but to run out when the clouds are overhead, and, looking at the sky,
  call aloud</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Gullee boorboor. Gullee boorboor.&rsquo;<br>
 &lsquo;Water come down. Water come down.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Or should it be raining too much, the last possible child of a woman can
  stop it by burning Midjeer wood.</p>
  <p>Bootha told me after one rain that she had sent one of her tutelary spirits
  to tell Boyjerh&mdash;Byamee is called by women and children Boyjerh&mdash;that
  the country wanted rain. In answer he had taken up a handful of crystal pebbles
  and thrown them from the sky down into the water in a stone basin on the
  top of the sacred mountain; as the pebbles fell in, the water splashed up
  into the clouds above, whence it descended as the desired rain.</p>
  <p>It is told to me, that at some initiatory rites the oldest medicine man,
  or Wirreenun, present addresses a prayer to Byamee, asking him to give them
  long life, as they have kept his law.</p>
  <p>The tribesmen do not profess to pray, or to have prayed, to Byamee on any
  occasions except at funerals, and at the conclusion of the Boorah.</p>
  <p>As for Byamee&rsquo;s relation to ethics, it will be stated in the chapter
  on the tribal ceremonies, while the stories as to the rewards and punishments
  of the future life will be given in their place. Baiame&rsquo;s troubles
  with a kind of disobedient deputy, Darramulun, will also be narrated: the
  myth is current, too, among the Wir djuri tribe.</p>
  <p>Other particulars about Byamee will occur in the course of later chapters:
  here I have tried to give a general summary of the native beliefs. The reader
  may interpret them in his own fashion, and may decide as to whether the beliefs
  do or do not indicate a kind of &lsquo;religion,&rsquo; whether &lsquo;a
  recognised religion&rsquo; or not. There is necessarily, of course, an absence
  of temples and of priests, and I have found no trace or vestige of sacrifice.
  What may be said on the affirmative side as to the religious aspect of the
  belief, the reader can supply from the summary of facts. Other potent beings
  occur in native myth, as we shall show, but there appears to exist between
  them and mankind no relation of affection, reverence, or duty, as in the
  case of Byamee.</p>
  <p>Here it seems necessary to advert to a remark of Mr. Howitt&rsquo;s which
  appears to be erroneous. He says &lsquo;that part of Australia which I have
  indicated as the habitat of that belief&rsquo; (namely, in an All Father),&rsquo; is
  also the area where there has been the advance from group marriage to individual
  marriage; from descent in the female line to that in the male line; where
  the primitive organisation under the class system has been more or less replaced
  by an organisation based on locality; in fact, where these advances have
  been made to which I have more than once drawn attention.&rsquo;[Howitt, <i>Native
  Tribes Of South-East Australia</i>, p. 500.]</p>
  <p>Mr. Howitt forgets that he himself attributes the early system of descent
  through women, and also the belief in an All Father (Nurelli), to the Wiimbaio
  tribe [<i>Ibid</i>. p. 489] to the Wotjobaluk tribe,[<i>Native Tribes Of
  South-East Australia</i>, pp. 120, 490.] to the Kamilaroi, to the Ta-Ta-thi,[<i>Ibid</i>.
  p. 494] while female descent and the belief in Baiame mark the Euahlayi and
  Wir djuri.[<i>Journal, Anthropological Institute, xxv.</i>, p. 297.]</p>
  <p>These tribes cover an enormous area of country, and, though they have not
  advanced to male kinship, they all possess the belief in an All Father. That
  belief does not appear to be in any way associated with advance in social
  organisation, for Messrs. Spencer and Gillen cannot find a trace of it in
  more than one of the central and northern tribes, which have male kinship,
  and a kind of local self-government. On the other hand, it does occur among
  southern tribes, like the Kurnai, which have advanced almost altogether out
  of totemism.</p>
  <p>In short, we have tribes with female descent, such as the Dieri and Urabunna,
  to whom all knowledge of an All Father is denied. We have many large and
  important tribes with female descent who certainly believe in an All Father.
  We have tribes of the highest social advancement who are said to show no
  vestige of the belief, and we have tribes also socially advanced who hold
  the belief with great vigour. In these circumstances, authenticated by Mr.
  Howitt himself, it is impossible to accept the theory that belief in an All
  Father is only reached in the course of such advance to a higher social organisation
  as is made by tribes who reckon descent in the male line.</p>

  Relationships And Totems</b></h2>
  <p>Some <i>savants</i> question the intellectual ability of the blacks because
  they have not elaborate systems of numeration and notation, which in their
  life were quite unneeded. Such as were needed were supplied. They are often
  incorporate in one word-noun and qualifying numerical adjective, as for example&mdash;</p>
  <p>Gundooee &mdash; <i>a solitary emu</i></p>
  <p>Booloowah &mdash; <i>two emus</i></p>
  <p>Oogle oogle &mdash; <i>four emus</i></p>
  <p>Gayyahnai &mdash; <i>five or six emus</i></p>
  <p>Gonurrun &mdash; <i>fourteen or fifteen emus</i></p>
  <p>I fancy the brains that could have elaborated their marriage rules were
  capable of workaday arithmetic if necessary, and few indeed of us know our
  family trees as the blacks know theirs.</p>
  <p>Even the smallest black child who can talk seems full of knowledge as to
  all his relations, animate and inanimate, the marriage taboos, and the rest
  of their complicated system.</p>
  <p>The first division among this tribe is a blood distinction (&lsquo;phratries&rsquo;):&mdash;</p>
  <p>Gwaigulleeah &mdash; <i>light blooded</i></p>
  <p>Gwaimudthen &mdash; <i>dark blooded</i></p>
  <p>This distinction is not confined to the human beings of the tribe, who must
  be of one or the other, but there are the Gwaigulleeah and Gwaimudthen divisions
  in all things. The first and chief division in our tribe, as regards customary
  marriage law, is the partition of all tribes-folk into these &lsquo;phratries,&rsquo; or &lsquo;exogamous
  moieties.&rsquo; While in most Australian tribes the meanings of the names
  of phratries are lost, where the meanings are known they are usually names
  of animals&mdash;Eagle, Hawk, and Crow, White Cockatoo and Black Cockatoo,
  and so forth. Among the great Kamilaroi tribe, akin in speech to the Euahlayi,
  the names of phratries, <i>Dilbi</i> and <i>Kupathin</i>, are of unknown
  significance. The Euahlayi names, we have seen, are Gwaigulleeah, Light blooded,
  and Gwaimudthen, Dark blooded.</p>
  <p>The origin of this division is said to be the fact that the original ancestors
  were, on the one side, a red race coming from the west, the Gwaigulleeah;
  on the other, a dark race coming from the east.</p>
  <p>A Gwaigulleeah may under no circumstances marry a Gwaigulleeah; he or she
  must mate with a Gwaimudthen. This rule has no exception. A child belongs
  to the same phratry as its mother.</p>
  <p>The next name of connection is <i>local</i>, based on belonging to one country
  or hunting-ground; this name a child takes from its mother wherever it may
  happen to be born. Any one who is called a Noongahburrah belongs to the Noongah-Kurrajong
  country; Ghurreeburrah to the orchid country; Mirriehburrah, poligonum country;
  Bibbilah, Bibbil country, and so on. This division, not of blood relationship,
  carries no independent marriage restriction, but keeps up a feeling equivalent
  to Scotch, Irish, or English, and is counted by the blacks as &lsquo;relationship,&rsquo; but
  not sufficiently so to bar marriage.</p>
  <p>The next division is the name in common for all daughters, or all sons of
  one family of sisters. The daughters take the name from their maternal grandmother,
  the sons from their maternal great-uncle.</p>
  <p>Of these divisions, called I Matrimonial Classes, there are four for each
  sex, bearing the same names as among the Kamilaroi. The names are&mdash;</p>
  <p>Masculine Kumbo <i>brother and sister</i> Feminine, Bootha<br>
  Masculine Murree <i>brother and sister</i> Feminine, Matha<br>
  Masculine Hippi <i>brother and sister</i> Feminine, Hippitha<br>
  Masculine Kubbee <i>brother and sister</i> Feminine, Kubbootha</p>
  <p>The children of Bootha will be</p>
  <p>Masculine Hippi <i>brother and sister</i> Feminine, Hippitha</p>
  <p>The children of Matha will be</p>
  <p>Masculine Kubbee <i>brother and sister</i> Feminine, Kubbootha</p>
  <p>The children of Hippatha will be</p>
  <p>Masculine Kumbo <i>brother and sister</i> Feminine, Bootha</p>
  <p>The children of Kubbootha will be</p>
  <p>Masculine Murree <i>brother and sister</i> Feminine, Matha</p>
  <p>Thus, you see, they take, if girls, their grandmother&rsquo;s and her sisters&rsquo; &lsquo;class&rsquo; names
  in common; if boys, the &lsquo;class&rsquo; name of their grandmother&rsquo;s
  brothers.</p>
  <p>Bootha can only marry Murree,<br>
  Matha can only marry Kumbo,<br>
  Hippitha can only marry Kubbee,<br>
  Kubbootha can only marry Hippi.</p>
  <p>Both men and women are often addressed by these names when spoken to.</p>
  <p>A <i>propos</i> of names, a child is never called at night by the same name
  as in the daytime, lest the &lsquo;devils&rsquo; hear it and entice him
  away.</p>
  <p>Names are made for the newly born according to circumstances; a girl born
  under a Dheal tree, for example, was called Dheala. Any incident happening
  at the time of birth may gain a child a name, such as a particular lizard
  passing. Two of my black maids were called after lizards in that way: Barahgurree
  and Bogginbinnia.</p>
  <p>Nimmaylee is a porcupine with the spines coming; such an one having been
  brought to the camp just as a girl was born, she became Nimmaylee.</p>
  <p>The mothers, with native politeness, ask you to give their children English
  names, but much more often use in familiar conversation either the Kumbo
  Bootha names, or others derived from place of birth, from some circumstance
  connected with it, a child&rsquo;s mispronunciation of a word, some peculiarity
  noticed in the child, or still more often they call each other by the name
  proclaiming the degree of relationship.</p>
  <p>For example, a girl calls the daughters of her mother and of her aunts alike
  sisters.</p>
  <p>Boahdee <i>sister</i><br>
  Wambaneah <i>full brother</i><br>
  Dayadee <i>half brother</i><br>
  Gurrooghee <i>uncle</i><br>
  Wulgundee <i>uncle&rsquo;s wife</i><br>
  Kummean <i>sister&rsquo;s sister</i><br>
  Numbardee <i>mother</i><br>
  Numbardee <i>mother&rsquo;s sister</i><br>
  Beealahdee <i>father</i><br>
  Beealahdee <i>mother&rsquo;s sisters&rsquo; husbands</i><br>
  Gnahgnahdee <i>grandmother on father&rsquo;s side</i><br>
  Bargie <i>grandmother on mother&rsquo;s side</i><br>
  Dadadee <i>grandfather on mother&rsquo;s side</i><br>
  Gurroomi <i>a son-in-law, or one who could be a son-in-law</i><br>
  Goonooahdee <i>a daughter-in-law, or one who could be a daughter-in-law</i><br>
  Gooleerh <i>husband or wife, or one who might be so</i></p>
  <p>So relationships are always kept in their memories by being daily used as
  names. There are other general names, too, such as&mdash;</p>
  <p>Mullayerh <i>a temporary mate or companion</i><br>
  Moothie <i>a friend of childhood in after life</i><br>
  Doore-oothai <i>a lover</i><br>
  Dillahga <i>an elderly man of the same totem</i><br>
  Tuckandee <i>a young man of the same totem, reckoned as a sort of brother</i></p>
  <p>Another list of names used ordinarily is&mdash;</p>
  <p>Boothan <i>last possible child of a woman</i><br>
  Mahmee <i>old woman</i><br>
  Beewun <i>motherless girl</i><br>
  Gowun <i>fatherless girl</i><br>
  Yumbui <i>fatherless boy</i><br>
  Moogul <i>only child</i></p>
  <p>Those of the same totem are reckoned as brothers and sisters, so cannot
  intermarry. &lsquo;Boyjerh&rsquo; relations, as those on the father&rsquo;s
  side are called, are not so important as on the mother&rsquo;s side, but
  are still recognised.</p>
  <p>Now for the great Dh&eacute;, or totem system, by some called Mah, but Dh&eacute;,
  is the more correct.</p>
  <p>Dinewan, or emu, is a totem, and has amongst its &lsquo;multiplex totems&rsquo; or &lsquo;sub-totems&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
  <p>Goodoo <i>or codfish</i><br>
  Gumbarl <i>silver bream</i><br>
  Inga <i>crayfish</i><br>
  Boomool <i>shrimps</i><br>
  Gowargay <i>water emu spirit</i><br>
  Moograbah <i>big black-and-white magpie</i><br>
  Booloorl <i>little night owl</i><br>
  Byahmul <i>black swan</i><br>
  Eerin <i>a little night owl</i><br>
  Beerwon <i>a bird like a swallow</i><br>
  Dulloorah <i>the manna-bringing birds</i><br>
  Bunnyal <i>flies</i><br>
  Dheal <i>sacred fire</i><br>
  Gidya <i>an acacia</i><br>
  Yaraan <i>an eucalyptus</i><br>
  Deenyi <i>ironbark</i><br>
  Guatha <i>quandong</i><br>
  Goodooroo <i>river box</i><br>
  Mirieh <i>poligonum</i><br>
  Yarragerh <i>the north-east wind</i><br>
 &nbsp;Guie <i>tree&mdash;owenia acidula</i><br>
  Niune <i>wild melon</i><br>
  Binnamayah <i>big saltbush</i></p>
  <p>Bohrah, the kangaroo, is another totem, and is considered somewhat akin
  to Dinewan. For example, in a quarrel between, say, the Bohrah totem and
  the Beewee, the Dinewan would take the part of the former rather than the
  latter.</p>
  <p>Amongst the multiplex totems of Bohrah are&mdash;</p>
  <p>Goolahwilleel <i>topknot pigeons</i><br>
  Boogoodoogadah <i>the rain-bird</i><br>
  Gilah <i>pink-breasted parrot</i><br>
  Quarrian <i>yellow and red breasted grey parrot</i><br>
  Buln Buln <i>green parrot</i><br>
  Gidgerregah <i>small green parrot</i><br>
  Cocklerina <i>a rose and yellow crested white cockatoo</i><br>
  Youayah <i>frogs</i><br>
  Guiggahboorool <i>biggest ant-beds</i><br>
  Dunnia <i>wattle tree</i><br>
  Mulga <i>an acacia</i><br>
  Gnoel <i>sandalwood</i><br>
  Brigalow <i>an acacia</i><br>
  Yarragerh <i>north-east wind, same as Dinewan&rsquo;s</i></p>
  <p>All clouds, lightning, thunder, and rain that is not blown up by the wind
  of another totem, belong to Bohrah.</p>
  <p>Beewee, brown and yellow Iguana, numerically a very powerful totem, has
  for multiplex totems&mdash;</p>
  <p>Gai-gai <i>catfish</i><br>
  Curreequinquin <i>butcher-bird</i><br>
  Gougourgahgah <i>laughing-jackass</i><br>
  Deenbi <i>divers</i><br>
  Birroo Birroo <i>sand builders</i><br>
  Deegeenboyah <i>soldier-bird</i><br>
  Weedah <i>bower-bird</i><br>
  Mooregoo Mooregoo <i>black ibis</i><br>
  Booloon <i>white crane</i><br>
  Noodulnoodul <i>whistling ducks</i><br>
  Goborrai <i>stars</i><br>
  Gulghureer <i>pink lizard</i><br>
  Goori <i>pine</i><br>
  Talingerh <i>native fuchsia</i><br>
  Guiebet <i>native passion fruit</i><br>
  Boonburr <i>poison tree</i><br>
  Gungooday <i>stockman&rsquo;s wood</i><br>
  Guddeeboondoo <i>bitter bark</i><br>
  Boorgoolbean or Mooloowerh <i>a shrub with creamy blossoms</i><br>
  Yarragerh <i>spring wind</i><br>
  Muddernwurderh <i>west wind</i></p>
  <p>Those with whom the Beewee shares the winds he counts as relations. It is
  the Beewees of the Gwaimudthen, or dark blood, who own Yarragerh (spring
  wind); the light-blooded own Mudderwurderh (west wind).</p>
  <p>Another totem is Gouyou, or Bandicoot. The animal has disappeared from the
  Narran district, but the totem tribe is still strong, though not so numerous
  as either the Beewees or Dinewans.</p>
  <p>Multiplex totems of Gouyou&mdash;</p>
  <p>Wayarnberh <i>turtle</i><br>
  Mungghee <i>mussels</i><br>
  Piggiebillah <i>porcupine</i><br>
  Dayahminnah <i>small carpet snake</i><br>
  Mungun <i>large carpet snake</i><br>
  Douyouie <i>ants</i><br>
  Moondoo <i>wasps</i><br>
  Murgahmuggui <i>spider</i><br>
  Bayarh <i>green-head ants</i><br>
  Mubboo <i>beefwood</i><br>
  Coolabah <i>eucalyptus, flooded box</i><br>
  Bingahwingul <i>needlebush</i><br>
  Mayarnah <i>stones</i><br>
  Gheeger Gheeger <i>cold west wind</i><br>

 &nbsp;Guineeboo <i>redbreasts</i><br>
  Munggheewurraywurraymul <i>seagulls</i><br>
  Guiggah <i>ordinary ant-beds</i></p>
  <p>Next we take Doolungaiyah, or Bilber, commonly known as Bilby, a large species
  of rat the size of a small rabbit, like which it burrows; almost died out
  now. The totem clan are very few here too, so it is difficult to learn much
  as to their multiplex totems, amongst which, however, are&mdash;</p>
  <p>Ooboon <i>blue-tongued lizard</i><br>
  Goomblegubbon <i>plains turkey or bustard</i><br>
  Boothagullagulla <i>bird like seagull</i><br>
  Tekel Barain <i>large white amaryllis</i></p>
  <p>Douyou, black snake, totem claims&mdash;</p>
  <p>Noongah <i>kurrajong&mdash;sterculia</i><br>
  Carbeen <i>an eucalyptus</i><br>

  Woggoon <i>scrub turkey</i><br>
  Beeargah <i>crane</i><br>
  Waggestmul <i>kind of rat</i><br>
  Wi <i>small fish</i><br>
  Millan <i>small water-yam&mdash;sourtop</i></p>
  <p>Moodai, or opossum, another totem, claims&mdash;</p>
  <p>Bibbil <i>popular-leaved gum</i><br>
  Bumble <i>capparis mitchellianni</i><br>
  Birah <i>whitewood</i><br>
  Beebuyer <i>yellow flowering broom</i><br>
  Illay <i>hop bush</i><br>
  Mirrie <i>wild currant bush</i><br>
  Mooregoo <i>swamp oak&mdash;belah</i><br>
  Mungoongarlee <i>largest iguana</i><br>
  Mouyi <i>white cockatoo</i><br>
  Beeleer <i>black cockatoo</i><br>
  Wungghee <i>white night owl</i><br>
  Mooregoo <i>mopoke</i><br>
  Narahdarn <i>bat</i><br>
  Bahloo <i>moon</i><br>
  Euloowirrie <i>rainbow</i><br>
  Bibbee <i>woodpecker</i><br>
  Billai <i>crimson wing parrot</i><br>
  Durrahgeegin <i>green frog</i></p>
  <p>Maira, a paddy melon, claims as multiplex totems&mdash;</p>
  <p>Wahn <i>the crow</i><br>
  Mullyan <i>the eagle-hawk</i><br>
  Gooboothoo <i>doves</i><br>
  Goolayyalilee <i>pelican</i><br>
  Oonaywah <i>black diver</i><br>
  Gunundar <i>white diver</i><br>
  Birriebungar <i>small diver</i><br>
  Mounin <i>mosquito</i><br>
  Mouninguggahgui <i>mosquito bird</i><br>
  Bullah Bullah <i>butterflies</i><br>
  Tucki <i>a kind of bream</i><br>
  Beewerh <i>bony bream</i><br>
  Gulbarlee <i>shingleback lizard</i><br>
  Budtha <i>rosewood</i><br>
  Goodoogah <i>yalli</i><br>
  Wayarah <i>wild grapes</i><br>
  Garwah <i>rivers</i><br>
  Gooroongoodilbaydilbay <i>south wind</i></p>
  <p>It is said a Maira will never be drowned, for the rivers are a sub-totem
  of theirs; but I notice they nevertheless learn to swim.</p>
  <p>Yubbah, carpet snake, as a kin has almost disappeared, only a few members
  remaining to claim</p>
  <p>Mungahran <i>hawk</i></p>
  <p>Burrahwahn, a big sandhill rat, now extinct here, claims&mdash;</p>
  <p>Mien <i>dingo</i><br>
  Dalleerin <i>a lizard</i><br>
  Gaengaen <i>wild lime</i><br>
  Willerhderh, or Douran Douran <i>north wind</i><br>
  Bralgah <i>native companion</i></p>
  <p>Buckandee, native cat kin, claim&mdash;</p>
  <p>Buggila <i>leopard wood</i><br>
  Bean <i>myall</i><br>
  Bunbundoolooey <i>a little brown bird</i><br>
  Dunnee Bunbun <i>a very large green parrot</i><br>
  Dooroongul <i>hairy caterpillar</i></p>
  <p>Amongst other totems were once the Bralgah, Native Companion, and Dibbee,
  a sort of sandpiper, but their kins are quite extinct as far as our blacks
  are concerned; the birds themselves are still plentiful. The Bralgah birds
  have a Boorah ground at the back of our old horse-paddock, a smooth, well-beaten
  circle, where they dance the grotesque dances peculiar to them, which are
  really most amusing to watch, somewhat like a set of kitchen lancers into
  which some dignified dames have got by mistake, and a curious mixture is
  the dance of dignity and romping.</p>
  <p>The totem kins numerically strongest with us were the Dinewans, Beewees,
  Bohrahs, and Gouyous. Further back in the country, they tell me, the crow,
  the eaglehawk, and the bees were original totems, not multiplex ones, as
  with us.</p>
  <p>It may be as well for those interested in the marriage law puzzles to state
  that Dinewans, Bohrahs, Douyous, and Doolungayers are always</p>
  <p>Kumbo Hippi<br>
  Bootha Hippitha.</p>
  <p>That Moodai, Gouyou, Beewee, Maira, Yubbah are always</p>
  <p>Murree Kubbee<br>
  Matha Kubbootha.</p>
  <p>Our blacks may and do eat their hereditary totems, if so desirous, with
  no ill effects to themselves, either real or imaginary; their totem names
  they take from their mothers. They may, in fact, in any way use their totems,
  but never abuse them. A Beewee, for example, may kill, or see another kill,
  and eat or use a Beewee, or one of its multiplex totems, and show no sign
  of sorrow or anger. but should any one speak evil of the Beewee, or of any
  of its multiplex totems, there will be a quarrel.</p>
  <p>There will likewise be a quarrel if any one dares to mimic a totem, either
  by drawing one, except at Boorahs, or imitating it in any way.</p>
  <p>There are members of the tribes, principally wizards, or men intended to
  be such, who are given an individual totem called Yunbeai. This they must
  never eat or they will die. Any injury to his yunbeai hurts the man himself.
  In danger he has the power to assume the shape of his yunbeai, which of course
  is a great assistance to him, especially in legendary lore; but, on the other
  hand, a yunbeai is almost a Heel of Achilles to a wirreenun (see the chapter
  on Medicine and Magic).</p>
  <p>Women are given a yunbeai too, sometimes. One girl had a yunbeai given her
  as a child, and she was to be brought up as a witch, but she caught rheumatic
  fever which left her with St. Vitus&rsquo;s dance. The yunbeai during one
  of her bad attacks jumped out of her, and she lost her chance of witchery.
  One old fellow told me once that when he was going to a public-house he took
  a miniature form of his yunbeai, which was the Kurrea&mdash;crocodile&mdash;out
  of himself and put it safety in a bottle of water, in case by any chance
  he got drunk, and an enemy, knowing his yunbeai, coaxed it away. I wanted
  to see that yunbeai in a bottle, but never succeeded.</p>
  <p>The differences between the hereditary totem or Dh&eacute;, inherited from
  the mother, and the individual totem or yunbeai, acquired by chance, are
  these: Food restrictions do not affect the totem, but marriage restrictions
  do; the yunbeai has no marriage restrictions; a man having an opossum for
  yunbeai may marry a woman having the same either as her yunbeai or hereditary
  totem, other things being in order, but under no circumstances must a yunbeai
  be eaten by its possessor.</p>
  <p>The yunbeai is a sort of <i>alter ego</i>; a man&rsquo;s spirit is in his
  yunbeai, and his yunbeai&rsquo;s spirit in him.</p>
  <p>A Minggah, or spirit-haunted tree of an individual, usually chosen from
  amongst a man&rsquo;s multiplex totems, is another source of danger to him,
  as also a help.</p>
  <p>As Mr. Canton says: &lsquo;What singular threads of superstition bind the
  ends of the earth together! In an old German story a pair of lovers about
  to part chose each a tree, and by the tree of the absent one was the one
  left to know of his wellbeing or the reverse. In time his tree died, and
  she, hearing no news of him, pined away, her tree withering with her, and
  both dying at the same time.</p>
  <p>Well, that is just what a wirreenun would believe about his Minggah. These
  Minggah and Goomarh spirit trees and stones always make me think, perhaps
  irrelevantly, of one of the restored sayings of the Lord, which ends &lsquo;Raise
  the stone, and there thou shalt find Me; cleave the wood, and I am there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Blacks were early scientists in some of their ideas, being before Darwin
  with the evolution theory, only theirs was a kind of evolution aided by Byamee.
  I dare say, though, the missing link is somewhere in the legends. I rather
  think the Central Australians have the key to it. One old man here was quite
  an Ibsen with his ghastly version of heredity.</p>
  <p>He said, when I asked him what harm it would do for, say, a Beewee totem
  man to come from the Gulf country, where his tribe had never had any communication
  with ours, and marry a girl here,&mdash;that all Beewees were originally
  changed from the Beewee form into human shape. The Beewee of the Gulf, originally,
  like the Beewee here, had the same animal shape, and should two of this same
  blood mate the offspring would throw back, as they say of horses, to the
  original strain, and partake of iguana (Beewee) attributes either in nature
  or form.</p>
  <p>From the statements just given, it will be seen that the Euahlayi are in
  the Kamilaroi stage of social organisation. They reckon descent in the female
  line: they have &lsquo;phratries&rsquo; and four matrimonial classes, with
  totems within the phratries. In their system of &lsquo;multiplex-totems&rsquo; or &lsquo;sub-totems&rsquo; they
  resemble the Wotjobaluk tribe.[Howitt, <i>Native Tribes Of South-East Australia</i>,
  pp. 121, 125, 453, 455.] The essence of the &lsquo;sub-totem&rsquo; system
  is the division of all things into the categories provided by the social
  system of the human society. The arrangement is a very early attempt at a
  scientific system of classification.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the most peculiar feature in the organisation of the Euahlayi is
  the existence of Matrimonial Classes, which are named as in the Kamilaroi
  tongue, while the phratry names are not those of the Kamilaroi, and alone
  among phratry names in Australia which can be translated, are not names of
  animals. The phratries have thus no presiding animals, and in the phratries
  there are no totem kins of the phratriac names. The cause of these peculiarities
  is matter of conjecture.</p>
  <p>A peculiarity in the totemic system of the Euahlayi&mdash;the right of each
  individual to kill and eat his own totem&mdash;has been mentioned, and may
  be associated here with other taboos on food.</p>
  <p>The wunnarl, or food taboo, was taken off a different kind of food for boys
  at each Boorah, until at last they could eat what they pleased except their
  yunbeai, or individual familiar: their Dh&eacute;, or family totem, was never
  wunnarl or taboo to them.</p>
  <p>A child may not perhaps know that it has had a yunbeai given to it, and
  may eat of it in ignorance, when immediately they say that child sickens.</p>
  <p>Should a boy or a girl eat plains turkey or bustard eggs while they were
  yet wunnarl, or taboo, he or she would lose his or her sight. Should they
  eat the eggs or flesh of kangaroo or piggiebillah, their skins would break
  out in sores and their limbs wither.</p>
  <p>Even honey is wunnarl at times to all but the very old or very young. Fish
  is wunnarl for about four years after his Boorah to a boy, and about four
  months after she is wirreebeeun, or young woman, to a girl.</p>
  <p>When the wunnarl was taken off a particular kind of meat, a wizard poured
  some of the melted fat and inside blood of that animal or bird, as the case
  might be, over the boy, and rubbed it into him. The boy, shaking and shivering,
  made a spluttering noise with his lips; after that he could eat of the hitherto
  forbidden food.</p>
  <p>This did not necessarily refer to his totem, but any food wunnarl to him,
  though it is possible that there may have been a time in tribal history,
  now forgotten, when totems were wunnarl, and these ceremonies may be all
  that is left to point to that time.</p>
  <p>When a boy, after his first Boorah, killed his first emu, whether it was
  his Dh&eacute;, or totem, or not, his father made him lie on the bird before
  it was cooked. Afterwards a wirreenun (wizard) and the father rubbed the
  fat on the boy&rsquo;s joints, and put a piece of the flesh in his mouth. &lsquo;The
  boy chewed it, making a noise as he did so of fright and disgust; finally
  he dropped the meat from his mouth, making a blowing noise through his lips
  of &lsquo;Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!&rsquo; After that he could eat the flesh.</p>
  <p>A girl, too, had to be rubbed with the fat and blood of anything from which
  the wunnarl was to be removed for her. No ceremony of this sort would be
  gone through with the flesh, fat, or blood of any one&rsquo;s yunbeai, or
  individual familiar animal, for under no circumstances would any one kill
  or eat their yunbeai.</p>
  <p>Concerning the yunbeai, or animal familiar of the individual, conferred
  by the medicine men, more is to be said in the ensuing chapters. The yunbeai
  answers to the Manitu obtained by Red Indians during the fast at puberty;
  to the &lsquo;Bush Soul&rsquo; of West Africa; to the Nagual of South American
  tribes; and to the Nyarong of Borneo. The yunbeai has hitherto been scarcely
  remarked on among Australian tribes. Mr. Thomas declares it to be &lsquo;almost
  non-existent&rsquo; in Australia, mentioning as exceptions its presence among
  the Euahlayi; the Wotjobaluk in Victoria; the Yaraikkanna of Cape York; and &lsquo;probably&rsquo; some
  of the northern tribes on the other side of the Gulf of Carpentaria.[<i>Man</i> (1904),
  No. 53, p. 85.]</p>
  <p>Perhaps attention has not been directed to the animal familiar in Australia,
  or perhaps it is really an infrequent thing among the tribes.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  The Medicine Men</b></h2>
  <p>I used to wonder how the wirreenuns or doctor-wizards of the tribe attained
  their degrees.</p>
  <p>I found out that the old wizards fix upon a young boy who is to follow their
  profession. They take him to a tribal burial-ground at night. There they
  tie him down and leave him, after having lit some fires of fat at short distances
  round him.</p>
  <p>During the night that boy, if he be shaky in his nerves, has rather a bad
  time.</p>
  <p>One doctor of our tribe gave me a recital of his own early experience.</p>
  <p>He said, after the old fellows had gone, a spirit came to him, and without
  undoing his fastenings by which he was bound, turned him over, then went
  away. Scarcely had the spirit departed when a big star fell straight from
  the sky alongside the boy; he gazed fixedly at it, and saw emerge from it,
  first the two hind legs, then the whole of a Beewee or iguana. The boy&rsquo;s
  totem was a Beewee, so he knew it would not hurt him. It ran close up to
  him, climbed on him, ran down his whole length, then went away.</p>
  <p>Next came a snake straight towards his nose, hissing all the time. He was
  frightened now, for the snake is the hereditary enemy of the iguana. The
  boy struggled to free himself, but ineffectually. He tried to call out but
  found himself dumb. He tried to shut his eyes, or turn them from the snake,
  but was powerless to do so. The snake crawled on to him and licked him. Then
  it went away, leaving the boy as one paralysed. Next came a huge figure to
  him, having in its hand a gunnai or yam stick. The figure drove this into
  the boy&rsquo;s head, pulled it out through his back, and in the hole thus
  made placed a &lsquo;Gubberah,&rsquo; or sacred stone, with the help of
  which much of the boy&rsquo;s magic in the future was to be worked.</p>
  <p>This stone was about the size and something the shape of a small lemon,
  looking like a smoothed lump of semi-transparent crystal. It is in such stones
  that the wi-wirreenuns, or cleverest wizards, see visions of the past, of
  what is happening in the present at a distance, and of the future; also by
  directing rays from them towards their victims they are said to cause instantaneous
  death.</p>
  <p>Next, to the doctor-boy on trial, came the spirits of the dead who corroboreed
  round him, chanting songs full of sacred lore as regards the art of healing,
  and instructions how, when he needed it, he could call upon their aid.</p>
  <p>Then they silently and mysteriously disappeared. The next day one of the
  old wizards came to release the boy; he kept him away from the camp all day
  and at night took him to a weedah, or bower-bird&rsquo;s, playground. There
  he tied him down again, and there the boy was visited again by the spirits
  of the dead, and more lore was imparted to him.</p>
  <p>The reason given for taking him to a weedah&rsquo;s playground is, that
  before the weedah was changed into a bird, he was a great wirreenun; that
  is why, as a bird, he makes such a collection of pebbles and bones at his
  playground.</p>
  <p>The bower-bird&rsquo;s playgrounds are numerous in the bush. They are made
  of grass built into a tent-shaped arch open at each end, through which the
  weedahs run in and out, and scattered in heaps all around are white bones
  and black stones, bits of glass, and sometimes we have found coins, rings,
  and brooches.</p>
  <p>The weedahs do not lay their eggs at their playgrounds; their nests are
    hard to find. A little boy always known as &lsquo;Weedah,&rsquo; died lately,
  so probably a new name will have to be found for the bird, or to mention
  it will be taboo, at all events before the old people, who never allow the
  names of the dead to be mentioned.</p>
  <p>For several nights the medical student was tied down in case he should be
  frightened and run away, after that he was left without bonds. He was kept
  away from the camp for about two months. But he was not allowed to become
  a practitioner until he was some years older: first he dealt in conjuring,
  later on he was permitted to show his knowledge of pharmacy.</p>
  <p>His conjuring cures are divers.</p>
  <p>A burn he cures by sucking lumps of charcoal from it. Obstinate pains in
  the chest, the wizard says, must be caused by some enemy having put a dead
  person&rsquo;s hair, or bone in it. Looking wisdom personified in
  truly professional manner, he sucks at the affected spot, and soon produces
  from his mouth hair, bones, or whatever he said was there.</p>
  <p>If this faith-healing does not succeed, a stronger wizard than he must have
  bewitched the patient; he will consult the spirits. To that end he goes to
  his Minggah, a tree or stone&mdash;more often a tree, only the very greatest
  wirreenuns have stones, which are called Goomah&mdash;where his own and any
  spirits friendly towards him may dwell.</p>
  <p>He finds out there who the enemy is, and whence he obtained his poison.
  If a wirreenun is too far away to consult his friendly spirits in person,
  he can send his Mullee Mullee, or dream spirit, to interview them.</p>
  <p>He may learn that an enemy has captured the sick person&rsquo;s Doowee,
  or dream spirit&mdash;only wirreenuns&rsquo; dream spirits are Mullee Mullee,
  the others are Doowee&mdash;then he makes it his business to get that Doowee
  back.</p>
  <p>These dream spirits are rather troublesome possessions while their human
  habitations sleep they can leave them and wander at will. The things seen
  in dreams are supposed to be what the Doowees see while away from the sleeping
  bodies. This wandering of the Doowees is a great chance for their enemies:
  capture the Doowee and the body sickens; knock the Doowee about before it
  returns and the body wakes up tired and languid. Should the Doowee not return
  at all, the person from whom it wandered dies. When you wake up unaccountably
  tired in the morning, be sure your Doowee has been &lsquo;on the spree,&rsquo; having
  a free fight or something of that sort. And though your Doowee may give you
  at times lovely visions of passing paradises, on the whole you would be better
  without him.</p>
  <p>There is on the Queensland border country a dillee bag full of unclaimed
  Doowees. The wirreenun who has charge of this is one of the most feared of
  wirreenuns; he is a great magician, who, with his wonder-working glassy stones,
  can conjure up visions of the old fleshly habitations of the captured Doowees.</p>
  <p>He has Gubberahs, or clever stones, in which are the active spirits of evil-working
  devils, as well as others to work good. Should a Doowee once get into this
  wirreenun&rsquo;s bag, which has the power of self-movement, there is not
  a great chance of getting it back, though it is sometimes said to be done
  by a rival combination of magic. The worst of it is that ordinary people
  have no power over their Doowees; all they can do is to guard against their
  escaping by trying to keep their mouths shut while asleep.</p>
  <p>The wirreenuns are masters of their Mullee Mullees, sending them where they
  please, to do what they are ordered, always provided they do not meet a greater
  than themselves.</p>
  <p>All sorts of complications arise through the substitution of mad or evil
  spirits for the rightful Doowee. Be sure if you think any one has suddenly
  changed his character unaccountably, there has been some hankey-pankey with
  that person&rsquo;s Doowee. One of the greatest warnings of coming evil is
  to see your totem in a dream; such a sign is a herald of misfortune to you
  or one of your immediate kin. Should a wirreenun, perhaps for enmity, perhaps
  for the sake of ransom, decide to capture a Doowee, he will send his Mullee
  Mullee out to do it, bidding the Mullee Mullee secrete the Doowee in his&mdash;the
  wirreenun&rsquo;s&mdash;Minggah, tree or rock.</p>
  <p>When he is consulted as to the return of the missing Doowee, he will order
  the one who has lost it to sleep, then the Doowee, should the terms made
  suit the wirreenun, re-enters the body. Should it not do so, the Doowee-less
  one is doomed to die.</p>
  <p>In a wirreenun&rsquo;s Minggah, too, are often secreted shadow spirits stolen
  from their owners, who are by their loss dying a lingering death, for no
  man can live without Mulloowil, his shadow. Every one has a shadow spirit
  which he is very careful not to parade before his enemies, as any injury
  to it affects himself. A wirreenun can gradually shrink the shadow&rsquo;s
  size, the owner sickens and dies. &lsquo;May your shadow never be less!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The shadow of a wirreenun is, like his head, always mahgarl, or taboo; any
  one touching either will be made to suffer for such sacrilege.</p>
  <p>A man&rsquo;s Minggah is generally a tree from amongst his multiplex totems,
    as having greater reason to help him, being of the same family.</p>
  <p>In his Minggah a wirreenun will probably keep some Wundah, or white devil
  spirits, with which to work evil. There, too, he often keeps his yunbeai,
  or animal spirit&mdash;that is, his individual totem, not hereditary one.
  All wirreenuns have a yunbeai, and sometimes a special favourite of the wirreenuns
  is given a yunbeai too&mdash;or in the event of any one being very ill, he
  is given a yunbeai, and the strength of that animal goes into the patient,
  making him strong again, or a dying wirreenun leaves his yunbeai to some
  one else. Though this spirit gives extra strength it likewise gives an extra
  danger, for any injury to the animal hurts the man too; thus even wirreenuns
  are exposed to danger.</p>
  <p>No one, as we have said, must eat the flesh of his yunbeai animal; he may
  of his family totem, inherited from his mother, but of his yunbeai or individual
  familiar, never.</p>
  <p>A wirreenun can assume the shape of his yunbeai; so if his yunbeai were,
  for example, a bird, and the wirreenun were in danger of being wounded or
  killed, he would change himself into that bird and fly away.</p>
  <p>A great wirreenun can substitute one yunbeai for another, as was done when
  the opossum disappeared from our district, and the wirreenun, whose yunbeai
  it was, sickened and lay ill for months. Two very powerful wirreenuns gave
  him a new yunbeai, piggiebillah, the porcupine. His recovery began at once.
  The porcupine had been one of his favourite foods; from the time its spirit
  was put into him as his yunbeai, he never touched it.</p>
  <p>A wirreenun has the power to conjure up a vision of his particular yunbeai,
  which he can make visible to those whom he chooses shall see it.</p>
  <p>The blacks always told me that a very old man on the Narran, dead some years
  ago, would show me his yunbeai if I wished; it was Oolah, the prickly lizard.</p>
  <p>One day I went to the camp, saw the old man in his usual airy costume, only
  assumed as I came in sight, a tailless shirt. One of the gins said something
  to him; he growled an answer; she seemed persuading him to do something.
  Presently he moved away to a quite clear spot on the other side of the fire;
  he muttered something in a sing-song voice, and suddenly I saw him beating
  his head as if in accompaniment to his song, and then&mdash;where it came
  from I can&rsquo;t say&mdash;there beside him was a lizard. That fragment
  of a shirt was too transparent to have hidden that lizard; he could not have
  had it up his sleeve, because his sleeves were in shreds. It may have been
  a pet lizard that he charmed in from the bush by his song, but I did not
  see it arrive.</p>
  <p>They told me this old man had two yunbeai, the other was a snake. He often
  had them in evidence at his camp, and when he died they were seen beside
  him; there they remained until he was put into his coffin, then they disappeared
  and were never seen again. This man was the greatest of our local wizards,
  and I think really the last of the very clever ones. They say he was an old
  grey-headed man when Sir Thomas Mitchell first explored the Narran district
  in 1845. We always considered him a centenarian.</p>
  <p>It was through him that I heard some of the best of the old legends, with
  an interpreter to make good our respective deficiencies in each other&rsquo;s
  language.</p>
  <p>In the lives of blacks, or rather in their deaths, the Gooweera, or poison
  sticks or bones, play a great part.</p>
  <p>A Gooweera is a stick about six inches long and half an inch through, pointed
  at both ends. This is used for sickening or killing men.</p>
  <p>A Guddeegooree is a similar stick, but much smaller, about three inches
  in length, and is used against women.</p>
  <p>A man wishing to injure another takes one of these sticks, and warms it
  at a small fire he has made; he sticks the gooweera in the ground a few inches
  from the fire. While it is warming, he chants an incantation, telling who
  he wants to kill, why he wants to kill him, how long he wants the process
  to last, whether it is to be sudden death or a lingering sickness.</p>
  <p>The chant over, and the gooweera warmed, he takes it from the fire. Should
  he wish to kill his enemy quickly, he binds opossum hair cord round the stick,
  only leaving one point exposed; should he only want to make his enemy ill,
  he only partially binds the stick. Then he ties a ligature tightly round
  his right arm, between the wrist and elbow, and taking the gooweera, or guddeegooree,
  according to the sex of his enemy, he points it at the person he wishes to
  injure, taking care he is not seen doing it.</p>
  <p>Suddenly he feels the stick becoming heavier, he knows then it is drawing
  the blood from his enemy. The poison is prevented from entering himself by
  the ligature he has put round his arm. When the gooweera is heavy enough
  he ceases pointing it.</p>
  <p>If he wants to kill the person outright, he goes away, makes a small hole
  in the earth, makes a fire beside it. In this hole he puts a few Dheal leaves&mdash;Dheal
  is the tree sacred to the dead; on top of the leaves he puts the gooweera,
  then more leaves. This done, he goes away. The next day he comes back with
  his hand he hits the earth beside the buried stick, out jumps the gooweera,
  his enemy is dead. He takes the stick, which may be used many times, and
  goes on his way satisfied. Should he only wish to inflict a lingering illness
  on his enemy, he refrains from burying the gooweera, and in this case it
  is possible to save the afflicted person.</p>
  <p>For instance, should any one suspect the man with the gooweera of having
  caused the illness, knowing of some grudge he had against the sick person,
  the one who suspects will probably intercede for mercy. The man may deny
  that he knows anything about it. He may, on the other hand, confess that
  he is the agent. If the intercessions prevail, he produces the gooweera,
  rubs it all over with iguana fat, and gives the intercessor what fat is left
  to rub over the sick person, who, on that being done, gradually regains his
  normal condition after having probably been reduced to a living skeleton
  from an indescribable wasting sickness, which I suspect we spell funk.</p>
  <p>The best way to make a gooweera effective is to tie on the end of it some
  hair from the victim&rsquo;s head&mdash;a lock of hair being, in this country
  of upside-downs, a hate token instead of one of love.</p>
  <p>When the lock of hair method is chosen as a means of happy dispatch, the
  process is carried out by a professional.</p>
  <p>The hair is taken to the Boogahroo&mdash;a bag of hair and gooweeras&mdash;which
  is kept by one or two powerful wirreenuns in a certain Minggah. The wirreenun
  on receiving the hair asks to whom it belongs. Should it belong to one of
  a tribe he is favourably disposed towards, he takes the gooweera or hair,
  puts it in the bag, but never sings the death song over it, nor
  does he warm it.</p>
  <p>Should he, however, be indifferent, or ill-disposed towards the individual
  or his tribe, he completes the process by going through the form already
  given, or rather when there are two wirreenuns at the Boogahroo, the receiver
  of the hair gives it to the other one, who sings the death-song, warms the
  gooweera, and burns the hair. The person from whose head the hair on the
  gooweera came, then by sympathetic magic, at whatever distance he is, dies
  a sudden or lingering death according to the incantation sung over the poison-stick.
  Gooweeras need not necessarily be of wood; bone is sometimes used, and in
  these latter days even iron.</p>
  <p>Sometimes at a large meeting of the blacks the Boogahroo wirreenuns bring
  the bag and produce from it various locks of hair, which the owners or their
  relations recognise, claim, and recover. They find out, from the wirreenun,
  who put them there; on gaining which knowledge a tribal feud is declared&mdash;a
  regular vendetta, which lasts from generation to generation.</p>
  <p>If it be known that a man has stolen a lock of hair, he will be watched
  and prevented from reaching the Boogahroo tree, if possible.</p>
  <p>These gooweeras used to be a terrible nuisance to us on the station.
  A really good working black boy would say he must leave, he was going to
  die. On inquiry we would extract the information that some one was pointing
  a gooweera at him.</p>
  <p>Then sometimes the whole camp was upset; a strange black fellow had arrived,
  and was said to have brought gooweeras. This reaching the boss&rsquo;s ears,
  confiscation would result in order to restore peace of mind in the camp.
  Before I left the station a gin brought me a gooweera and told me to keep
  it; she had stolen it from her husband, who had threatened to point it at
  her for talking to another man.</p>
  <p>Some of them, though they still had faith in the power of such charms, had
  faith also in me. I used to drive devils out with patent medicines; my tobacco
  and patent medicine accounts while collecting folk-lore were enormous.</p>
  <p>A wirreenun, or, in fact, any one having a yunbeai, has the power to cure
  any one suffering an injury from whatever that yunbeai is; as, for example,
  a man whose yunbeai is a black snake can cure a man who is bitten by a black
  snake, the method being to chant an incantation which makes the yunbeai enter
  the stricken body and drive out the poison. These various incantations are
  a large part of the wirreenun&rsquo;s education; not least valuable amongst
  them is the chant sung over the tracks of snakes, which renders the bites
  of those snakes innocuous.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  More About The Medicine Men And Leechcraft</b></h2>
  <p>The wirreenuns sometimes hold meetings which they allow non-professionals
  to attend. At these the spirits of the dead speak through the medium of those
  they liked best on earth, and whose bodies their spirits now animate. These
  spirits are known as Yowee, the equivalent of our soul, which never leave
  the body of the living, growing as it grows, and when it dies take judgment
  for it, and can at will assume its perishable shape unless reincarnated in
  another form. So you see each person has at least three spirits, and some
  four, as follows: his Yowee, soul equivalent; his Doowee, a dream spirit;
  his Mulloowil, a shadow spirit; and may be his Yunbeai, or animal spirit.</p>
  <p>Sometimes one person is so good a medium as to have the spirits of almost
  any one amongst the dead people speak through him or her, in the whistling
  spirit voice.</p>
  <p>I think it is very clever of these mediums to have decided that spirits
  all have one sort of voice.</p>
  <p>At these meetings there would be great rivalry among the wirreenuns. The
  one who could produce the most magical stones would be supposed to be the
  most powerful. The strength of the stones in them, whether swallowed or rubbed
  in through their heads, adds its strength to theirs, for these stones are
  living spirits, as it were, breathing and growing in their fleshly cases,
  the owner having the power to produce them at any time. The manifestation
  of such power is sometimes, at one of these trials of magic, a small shower
  of pebbles as seeming to fall from the heads and mouths of the rivals, and
  should by chance any one steal any of these as they fall, the power of the
  original possessor would be lessened. The dying bequeath these stones, their
  most precious possessions, to the living wirreenun most nearly related to
  them.</p>
  <p>The wirreenun&rsquo;s health and power not only depend upon his crystals
  and yunbeai, but also on his Minggah; should an accident happen to that,
  unless he has another, he will die&mdash;in any case, he will sicken. Many
  of the legends deal with the magic of these spirit-animated trees.</p>
  <p>They are places of refuge in time of danger; no one save the wirreenun,
  whose spirit-tree it was, would dare to touch a refugee at a Minggah; and
  should the sanctuary be a Goomarh, or spirit-stone, not even a wirreenun
  would dare to interfere, so that it is a perfectly safe sanctuary from humanly
  dealt evil. But a refugee at a Minggah or Goomarh runs a great risk of incurring
  the wrath of the spirits, for Minggah are taboo to all but their own wirreenun.</p>
  <p>There was a Minggah, a great gaunt Coolabah, near our river garden. Some
  gilahs build in it every year, but nothing would induce the most avaricious
  of black bird-collectors to get the young ones from there.</p>
  <p>A wirreenun&rsquo;s boondoorr, or dillee bag, holds a queer collection:
  several sizes of gooweeras, of both bone and wood, poison-stones, bones,
  gubberahs (sacred stones), perhaps a dillee&mdash;the biggest, most magical
  stone used for crystal-gazing, the spirit out of which is said to go to the
  person of whom you want to hear, wherever he is, to see what he is doing,
  and then show you the person in the crystal. A dinahgurrerhlowah, or moolee,
  death-dealing stone, which is said to knock a person insensible, or strike
  him dead as lightning would by an instantaneous flash.</p>
  <p>To these are added in this miscellaneous collection medicinal herbs, nose-bones
  to put through the cartilage of his nose when going to a strange camp, so
  that he will not smell strangers easily. The blacks say the smell of white
  people makes them sick; we in our arrogance had thought it the other way
  on.</p>
  <p>Swansdown, shells, and woven strands of opossum&rsquo;s hair are valuable,
  and guarded as such in the boondoorr, which is sometimes kept for safety
  in the wirreenun&rsquo;s Minggah.</p>
  <p>Having dealt with the supernatural part of a wirreenun&rsquo;s training,
  which argues cunning in him and credulity in others, I must get to his more
  natural remedies.</p>
  <p>Snakebite they cure by sucking the wound and cauterising it with a firestick.
  They say they suck out the young snakes which have been injected into the
  bitten person.</p>
  <p>For headaches or pains which do not yield to the vegetable medicine, the
  wirreenuns tie a piece of opossum&rsquo;s hair string round the sore place,
  take one end in their mouths, and pull it round and round until it draws
  blood along the cord. For rheumatic pains in the head or in the small of
  the back and loins they often bind the places affected with coils of opossum
  hair cord, as people do sometimes with red knitting-silk.</p>
  <p>The blacks have many herbal medicines, infusions of various barks, which
  they drink or wash themselves with, as the case may be.</p>
  <p>Various leaves they grind on their dayoorl-stones, rubbing themselves with
  the pulp. Steam baths they make of pennyroyal, eucalyptus, pine, and others.</p>
  <p>The bleeding of wounds they stanch with the down of birds.</p>
  <p>For irritations of the skin they heat dwarf saltbush twigs and put the hot
  ends on the irritable parts.</p>
  <p>After setting a broken limb they put grass and bark round it, then bind
  it up.</p>
  <p>For swollen eyes they warm the leaves of certain trees and hold them to
  the affected parts, or make an infusion of Budtha leaves and bathe the eyes
  in it.</p>
  <p>For rheumatic pains a fire is made, Budtha twigs laid on it, a little water
  thrown on them; the ashes raked out, a little more water thrown on, then
  the patient lies on top, his opossum rug spread over him, and thus his body
  is steamed. To induce perspiration, earth or sand is also often heated and
  placed in a hollowed-out space; on it the patient lies, and is covered with
  more heated earth.</p>
  <p>Pennyroyal infused they consider a great blood purifier they also use a
  heap as a pillow if suffering from insomnia. It is hard to believe a black
  ever does suffer from insomnia, yet the cure argues the fact.</p>
  <p>Beefwood gum is supposed to strengthen children. It is also used for reducing
  swollen joints. A hole is made in the ground, some coals put in, on them
  some beefwood leaves, on top of them the gum; over the hole is put enough
  bark to cover it with a piece cut out of it the size of the swollen joint
  to be steamed, which joint is held over this hole.</p>
  <p>Various fats are also used as cures. Iguana fat for pains in the head and
  stiffness anywhere. Porcupine and opossum fats for preserving their hair,
  fish fat to gloss their skins, emu fat in cold weather to save their skins
  from chapping.</p>
  <p>But what is supposed to strengthen them more than anything, both mentally
  and physically, is a small piece of the flesh of a dead person, or before
  a body is put in a bark coffin a few incisions were made in it; when it was
  coffined it was stood on end, and what drained from the incisions was caught
  in small wirrees and drunk by the mourners.</p>
  <p>I fancy such cannibalism as has been in these tribes was not with a view
  to satisfaction of appetite but to the incorporation of additional strength.
  Either men or women are allowed to assist in this particularly nauseating
  funeral rite, but not the young people.</p>
  <p>Nor must their shadows fall across any one who has partaken of this rite;
  should they do so some evil will befall them.</p>
  <p>If the mother of a young child has not enough milk for its sustenance, she
  is steamed over &lsquo;old man&rsquo; saltbush, and hot twigs of it laid
  on her breasts. To expedite the expulsion of the afterbirth, an old woman
  presses the patient round the waist, gives her frequent drinks of cold water,
  and sprinkles water over her. As soon as the afterbirth is removed a steam
  is prepared. Two logs are laid horizontally, some stones put in between them,
  then some fire, on top leaves of eucalyptus, and water is then sprinkled
  over them. The patient stands astride these logs, an opossum rug all over
  her, until she is well steamed. After this she is able to walk about as if
  nothing unusual had happened. Every night for about a month she has to lie
  on a steam bed made of damped eucalyptus leaves. She is not allowed to return
  to the general camp for about three months after the birth of her child.</p>
  <p>Though perfectly well, she is considered unclean, and not allowed to touch
  anything belonging to any one. Her food is brought to her by some old woman.
  Were she to touch the food or food utensils of another they would be considered
  unclean and unfit for use. Her camp is gailie&mdash;that is, only for her;
  and she is goorerwon as soon as her child is born&mdash;a woman unclean and
  apart. Immediately a baby is born it is washed in cold water.</p>
  <p>Ghastly traditions the blacks have of the time when Dunnerh-Dunnerh, the
  smallpox, decimated their ancestors. Enemies sent it in the winds, which
  hung it on the trees, over the camps, whence it dropped on to its victims.
  So terror-stricken were the tribes that, with few exceptions, they did not
  stay to bury their dead; and because they did not do so, flying even from
  the dying, a curse was laid on them that some day the plague would return,
  brought back by the Wundah or white devils; and the blacks shudder still,
  though it was generations before them, at the thought that such a horror
  may come again.</p>
  <p>Poison-stones are ground up finely and placed in the food of the person
  desired to be got rid of. These poison-stones are of two kinds, a yellowish-looking
  stone and a black one; they cause a lingering death. The small bones of the
  wrist of a dead person are also pounded up and put into food, in honey or
  water, as a poison.</p>
  <p>One cure struck me as quaint. The patient may be lying down, when up will
  come one of the tribe, most likely a wirreenun with a big piece of bark.
  He strikes the ground with this all round the patient, making a great row;
  this is to frighten the sickness away.</p>
  <p>What seems to me a somewhat peculiar ceremony is the reception a coming
  baby holds before its birth.</p>
  <p>The baby is presumably about to be born. Its grandmother is there naturally,
  but the black baby declines to appear at the request of its grandmother,
  and, moreover, declines to come if even the voice of its grandmother is heard;
  so grannie has to be a silent spectator while some other woman tempts the
  baby into the world by descanting on the glories of it. First, perhaps, she
  will say:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come now, here&rsquo;s your auntie waiting to see you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your sister.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your father&rsquo;s sister,&rsquo; and so on through
  a whole list. Then she will say, as the relatives and friends do not seem
  a draw:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Make haste, the bumble fruit is ripe. The guiebet flowers are blooming.
  The grass is waving high. The birds are all talking. And it is a beautiful
  place, hurry up and see for yourself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But it generally happens that the baby is too cute to be tempted, and an
  old woman has to produce what she calls a wi-mouyan&mdash;a clever stick&mdash;which
  she waves over the expectant mother, crooning a charm which brings forth
  the baby.</p>
  <p>If any one nurses a patient and the patient dies, the nurse wears an armlet
  of opossum&rsquo;s hair called goomil, and a sort of fur boa called gurroo.</p>
  <p>If blacks go visiting, when they leave they make a smoke fire and smoke
  themselves, so that they may not carry home any disease.</p>
  <p>As a rule blacks do not have small feet, but their hands are almost invariably
  small and well shaped, having tapering fingers.</p>

  Our Witch Woman</b></h2>
  <p>Our witch woman was rather a remarkable old person. When she was, I suppose,
  considerably over sixty, her favourite granddaughter died.</p>
  <p>Old Bootha was in a terrible state of grief, and chopped herself in a most
  merciless manner at the burial, especially about the head. She would speak
  to no one, used to spend her time about the grave, round which she fixed
  upright posts which she painted white, red, and black. All round the grave
  she used to sweep continually.</p>
  <p>More and more she isolated herself, and at last discarded all her clothes
  and roamed the bush <i>a la</i> Eve before the Fall, as she had probably
  done as a young girl.</p>
  <p>She dug herself an underground camp, roofed it over, and painted enormous
  posts which she erected in front of her &lsquo;Muddy wine,&rsquo; as she
  called her camp. She never came near the house, though we had been great
  friends before.</p>
  <p>She used to prowl round the outhouses and pick up all sorts of things, rubbish
  for the most part, but often good utensils too; all used to be secreted in
  the underground camp. She never talked to any one, but used to mutter continually
  to herself and her dogs in an unknown tongue which only her dogs seemed to
  understand.</p>
  <p>We thought she was quite mad.</p>
  <p>One day, while we were playing tennis, she suddenly, muttering her strange
  language and dancing new corroboree steps, clad only in her black skin, came
  up. Matah told her to go away, but she only corroboreed round him and said
  she wanted to see me. I have the most morbid horror of lunacy in any form.
  I was once induced to go over a lunatic asylum&mdash;the horror of it haunts
  me still. However, I thought it would never do to show the coward I was,
  so though I felt as if I had been scooped out and filled up with ice, I went
  to her. She danced round me for a little time, then sidled up to me and said:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wahl you frightened, wahl me hurt you. I only womba&mdash;mad&mdash;all
  yowee&mdash;spirits&mdash;in me tell me gubbah&mdash;good&mdash;I lib &lsquo;long
  a youee; bimeby I come back big feller wirreenun; wahl you frightened? I
  not hurt you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And after crooning an accompaniment to her steps off she went, a strange
  enough figure, dancing and crooning as she went towards her camp; and not
  until the spirits gave up possession of her did she come near the house again.</p>
  <p>One day she gave us a start. We were schooling a new team of four horses.
  The off-side leader had only been in once before, and was a brumby (horse
  run in from a wild mob). We had to pass Bootha&rsquo;s camp. I looked about
  as we neared it but saw nothing of her. Suddenly from the ground, as it seemed,
  out dashed the weird old figure, arms full of things, jabbering away at a
  great rate. Whiz came a tin plate past the leaders&rsquo; heads; the offside
  horse reared and plunged and took some holding. Whiz came an old bill; then,
  one after another, a regular fusilade of various utensils.</p>
  <p>It did not take us long to get past, but for as long as we could see the
  attack was kept up. Coming back we saw nothing of Bootha, and all the utensils
  had been picked up.</p>
  <p>I used to tell the other blacks to see that Bootha had plenty of food. They
  said she was all right, the spirits were looking after her. Lunatics, from
  their point of view, are only persons spirit-possessed.</p>
  <p>Gradually old Bootha, clothed as usual, came back about the place.</p>
  <p>Strange stories came through the house blacks to me of old Bootha. She was
  very ill for a long time, then suddenly she recovered; not only recovered
  but seemed rejuvenated. We heard of wonderful cures she made; how she always
  consulted the spirits about any illness; how there were said to be spirits
  in some of her dogs; how she was now a rainmaker and, in fact, a fully fledged
  witch.</p>
  <p>I was curious to see some of these wonders, so used to get the old woman
  to come up when any one was ill, consult her, and generally make much of
  her. There is no doubt she could diagnose a case well enough. Matah suffered
  a good deal with a constant pain in one knee, he was quite lame from it.
  He showed it to Bootha one day. She sang a song to her spirits, then said:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Too muchee water there; you steam him, put him on hot rag; you drink
  plenty cold water, all lite dat go.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>As it happened a medical man was passing a few days afterwards with an insurance
  agent. Matah consulted him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hum! Yes, yes. Hot fomentations to the place affected, poultices,
  a cooling draught. There&rsquo;s a stoppage of fluid at the knee-joint which
  must be dispersed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I thought Bootha ought to have been called in consultation.</p>
  <p>A girl I had staying with me was taken suddenly and, to us, unaccountably
  ill. She was just able to get out of her room into the drawing-room, where
  she would lie back on the cushions of a lounge looking dreadfully limp and
  utterly washed out. Hearing of her illness old Bootha came up. I thought
  it might amuse Adelaide to see an old witch; she agreed, so I brought her
  in.</p>
  <p>Bootha went straight up to the sick girl, expressed a few sympathetic sentences,
  then she said she would ask the spirits what had made Adelaide ill and what
  would cure her.</p>
  <p>She moved my furniture until she left the centre of the room clear; she
  squatted down, and hanging her head began muttering in an unintelligible
  dialect. Presently her voice ceased and we heard from beside her a most peculiar
  whistling sort of voice, to which she responded, evidently interrogating.
  Again the whistling voice from further away. Bootha then told me she had
  asked a dead black fellow, Big Joe, to tell her what she wanted to know;
  but he could not, so now she was going to ask her dead granddaughter. Again
  she said a sort of incantation, and again, after a while, came the whistling
  voice reply&mdash;this time from another direction, not quite so loud. The
  same sort of thing was gone through with the same result.</p>
  <p>Then Bootha said she would ask Guadgee, a black girl who had been one of
  my first favourites in the camp, and who had died a few years previously.</p>
  <p>The whistling voice came from a third direction, though all the time I could
  see Bootha&rsquo;s lips moving.</p>
  <p>Guadgee answered all she was asked. She said Adelaide was made ill because
  she had offended the spirits by bathing in the creek under the shade of a
  Minggah, or spirit-tree, a place tabooed to all but wirreenuns, or such as
  hold communion with spirits.</p>
  <p>Of course, according to the blacks, to disturb a shadow is to hurt the original.</p>
  <p>In this Minggah, Guadgee. said, were swarms of bees invisible to all but
  wirreenuns, and they are ready always to resent any insult to the Minggah
  or its shadow. These spirit-bees had entered Adelaide and secreted some wax
  on her liver; their bites, Guadgee said, were on her back.</p>
  <p>Well, that can&rsquo;t be it, I said, I for you never did bathe in the shade
  of a Minggah; for, going as you always do with the house-girls, you are bound
  to be kept from such sacrilege; they would never dare such desecration.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Which is their Minggah? Is it a big Coolabah between the Bend and
  the garden?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then I did bathe there the last time I went down. I was up too late
  to go with the Black-but-Comelys, and as the sun was hot I went further round
  the point and bathed in the shade. And the bee-bites must be those horribly
  irritating pimples I have across my back.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The cause of illness settled to her satisfaction, Bootha asked how to cure
  it. The patient was to drink nothing hot nor heating but as much cold water
  as she liked, especially a long drink before going to bed. Guadgee said she
  would come in the night when the patient was asleep and take the wax from
  her liver; she would sleep well and wake better in the morning.</p>
  <p>Bootha got up then, came over to the patient, took her hand, rubbed it round
  the wrist several times, muttering an incantation; then saying she would
  see her again next day, off she went, taking, she told us, all the spirits
  away inside her, whence at desire they could be returned to such Minggah
  in their own Noorunbah, or hereditary hunting-grounds, as wirreenuns had
  placed them in, or to roam at their pleasure when not required by those in
  authority over spirits. Our old spiritualist denies us freedom even in the
  after-life she promises us.</p>
  <p>Adelaide slept that night, looked a better colour the next morning, and
  rapidly recovered.</p>
  <p>We think old Bootha must be a good physician and a ventriloquist, only I
  believe it is said ventriloquists cannot live long, and Bootha is now over
  eighty.</p>
  <p>Others besides wirreenuns see spirits sometimes, but rarely, though wirreenuns
  are said to have the power to conjure them up in a form visible to ordinary
  eyes.</p>
  <p>Babies are said to see spirits when they are smiling or crowing as if to
  themselves; it&rsquo;s to some spirit visible to them but to no one else.</p>
  <p>When a baby opens his hands and shuts them again quickly, smiling all the
  while, that baby is with the spirits catching crabs!</p>
  <p>Dogs see spirits; when they bark and howl suddenly and you see nothing about,
  it is because they have seen a spirit.</p>
  <p>One person may embody many spirits, but such an one must be careful not
  to drink anything hot or heating, such would drive out the spirits at once.
  The spirits would never enter a person defiled by the white man&rsquo;s &lsquo;grog.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Old Bootha had an interview with a very powerful spirit after she was ill,
  who told her that the spirit of her father was now in Bahloo, the moon; and
  that it was this spirit which had cured her, and if she kept his commands
  she would live for ever. The commands were never to drink &lsquo;grog,&rsquo; never
  to wear red, never to eat fish. This was told her fifteen years ago, never
  once has she transgressed; her vigour for an old woman considerably over
  eighty is marvellous.</p>
  <p>She was going away for a trip. Before going she said, as she would not be
  able to know when I wanted rain for my garden, she would put two posts in
  it which had in them the spirits of Kurreahs, or crocodiles. As these spirits
  required water I might be certain my tanks would never go dry while they
  were on guard. She asked one of my Black-but-Comelys, a very stalwart young
  woman, to help her lift one of these posts into the garden where she wanted
  to erect it. The girl took hold of one end, but in a little while dropped
  it, said it was too heavy. Old Bootha got furious.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I get the spirits to help me,&rsquo; she said, and started a little
  sing-song, then shouldered the post herself and carried it in. These posts
  are painted red, black, and white, with a snaky pattern, the Kurreah sign,
  on them. She also planted in my garden two other witch-poles, one painted
  red and having a cross-bar about midway down it from which raddled strings
  were attached to the top; this was to keep away the Euloowayi, black fellows
  possessed of devils, who came from behind the sunset.</p>
  <p>The other was a plain red-painted, tapering pine-pole which she said, when
  it fell to the ground, would tell of the death of some one related to an
  inmate of the house. Should it lean towards the house it foretold misfortune;
  or if she were any time away, when she was returning she would send her Mullee
  Mullee to sit on the top and bend it just to let us know. This pole would
  also keep away the spirits of the dead from the house during her absence.
  While she was away there would be no one to come and clear the place of evil
  by smoking the Budtha twigs all round it, as she always did if I were alone
  and, she thought, in need of protection.</p>
  <p>Old Bootha has what she calls a wi-mouyan, clever-stick. It is about six
  feet long, great lumps of beefwood gum making knobs on it at intervals; between
  each knob it is painted. Armed with this stick, a piece of crystal, some
  green twigs, and sometimes a stick with a bunch of feathers on top, and a
  large flat stone, she goes out to make rain. The crystal and stone she puts
  under the water in the creek, the feathered stick she erects on the edge
  of the water, then goes in and splashes about with green twigs, singing all
  the time.</p>
  <p>After a while she gets out and parades the bank with the wi-mouyan, singing
  a rain-song which charms some of the water out of the creek into the clouds,
  whence it falls where she directs it. Once my garden of roses looked very
  wilted. I asked Bootha to make rain, but just then she was very offended
  with Matah. One of her dogs had been poisoned, she would make no rain on
  his country. However, at last she said she would make some for me. I bound
  her down to a certain day. The day came; a heavy storm fell just over my
  garden, filling the ground tank, which was almost empty. About two inches
  fell. Within half a mile of each side of the garden the dust was barely laid.</p>
  <p>Old Bootha&rsquo;s luck stuck to her that time, and I had to give her a
  new dress and some &lsquo;bacca.&rsquo; But during the last drought she failed
  signally. Her excuse for failing was that a great wirreenun up the creek
  was so angry with the white people who were driving away all emu, kangaroo,
  and opossums, the black fellow&rsquo;s food, and yet made a fuss if their
  dogs killed a sheep for them sometimes, that he put his rain-stone in a fire,
  and while he did that no rain would fall. He said if all the sheep died the
  white fellows would go away again, and then, as long ago, the black fellows&rsquo; country
  would have plenty of emu and kangaroo.</p>
  <p>We saw a curious coincidence in connection with one of Bootha&rsquo;s witch-poles
  in my garden, the pole whose falling foretold death of some relative of some
  one in the house.</p>
  <p>One afternoon there had been drizzling rain and a grey mist overshadowing
  things. Matah went out to look at the chances of a continuance of rain, the
  usual drought being on. He called to me to come and see a curious sky. Looking
  towards the west I saw a golden ball of a sun piercing the grey clouds which
  seemed like a spangled veil over its face; shooting from the sun was a perfect
  halo of golden light, from which three shafts spread into roadways up past
  the grey clouds into the vault of heaven. The effect was very striking indeed,
  against the grey clouds shaded from silver to almost black.</p>
  <p>As we stood waiting for the sun to sink and the afterglow to paint these
  clouds, as it did, from shrimp pink and heliotrope to vivid crimson, we saw
  Bootha&rsquo;s pole fall. The air was quite still.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The damp has loosened its setting,&rsquo; said Matah, &lsquo;but
  we had better leave it alone and let the old girl fix it up again herself;
  it may be taboo to ordinary mortals like us.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We left it.</p>
  <p>That evening a messenger arrived from the sheep station to say my cook&rsquo;s
  mother had died just before sunset. The camp were firm believers in Bootha&rsquo;s
  witch-stick after that.</p>
  <p>It was just as well we did not touch that stick; had we done so, Bootha
  says we should have broken out in sores all over our bodies.</p>
  <p>They say that long ago the wirreenuns always used to have a sort of totem
  wizard-stick guarding the front of their camps.</p>

  Birth&mdash;Betrothal&mdash;An Aboriginal Girl From Infancy To Womanhood</b></h2>
  <p>To begin at the beginning, Bahloo, the moon, is a sort of patron of women.
  He it is who creates the girl babies, assisted by Wahn, the crow, sometimes.</p>
  <p>Should Wahn attempt the business on his own account the result is direful;
  women of his creating are always noisy and quarrelsome.</p>
  <p>Bahloo&rsquo;s favourite spot for carrying on the girl manufacturing is
  somewhere on the Culgoa. On one of the creeks there is to be seen, when it
  is dry, a hole in the ground. As water runs along, the bed of this creek,
  gradually a stone rises from this hole. As the water rises it rises, always
  keeping its top out of the water.</p>
  <p>This is the Goomarh, or spirit-stone, of Bahloo. No one would dare to touch
  this stone where the baby girls&rsquo; spirits are launched into space.</p>
  <p>In the same neighbourhood is a clear water-hole, the rendezvous of the snakes
  of Bahloo. Should a man go to drink there he sees no snakes, but no sooner
  has he drunk some of the water than he sees hundreds; so even water-drinkers
  see their snakes.</p>
  <p>The name of the hole is Dahn.</p>
  <p>Spirit-babies are usually despatched to Waddahgudjaelwon and sent by her
  to hang promiscuously on trees, until some woman passes under where they
  are, then they will seize a mother and be incarnated. This resembles the
  Arunta belief, but with the Euahlayi the spirits are new freshly created
  beings, not reincarnations of ancestral souls, as among the Arunta. To live,
  a child must have an earthly father; that it has not, is known by its being
  born with teeth.</p>
  <p>Wurrawilberoo is said to snatch up a baby spirit sometimes and whirl along
  towards some woman he wishes to discredit, and through the medium of this
  woman he incarnates perhaps twins, or at least one baby. No doubt were it
  not for signs of teeth in a spirit-baby of immaculate conception, many a
  camp scandal would be conveniently nipped in the bud.</p>
  <p>Babies are sometimes sent directly to their mothers without the Coolabah-tree
  or whirlwind medium.</p>
  <p>The bronze mistletoe branches with their orange-red flowers are said to
  be the disappointed babies whose wailing in vain for mothers has wearied
  the spirits who transform them into these bunches, the red flowers being
  formed from their baby blood. The spirits of babies and children who die
  young are reincarnated, and should their first mother have pleased them they
  choose her again and are called millanboo&mdash;the same again.</p>
  <p>They can instead, if they like, choose some other woman they know, which
  seems very accommodating in those presiding over the reincarnation department.</p>
  <p>Sometimes two baby spirits will hang on one branch and incarnate themselves
  in the same woman, who as result is the mother of twins, and the object of
  much opprobrium in the camp. In fact, in the old days, one of the twins would
  have been killed.</p>
  <p>One of my Black-but-Comelys said, on hearing that a woman had twins:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If it had been me I would have put my fingers round the throat of
  one of them and killed it.&rsquo; The woman who made this speech I had always
  looked upon as the gentlest and kindliest of creatures.</p>
  <p>The father of the twins has treated his wife with the utmost contempt since
  their birth, and declines to acknowledge more than one of the babies.</p>
  <p>They say the first-born of twins is always born grinning with his tongue
  out, as if to say, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s another to come yet; nice sort of
  mother I have.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>No wonder the women cover themselves under a blanket when they see a whirlwind
  coming, and avoid drooping Coolabah trees, believing that either may make
  them objects of scorn as the mother of twins.</p>
  <p>When a baby is born, some old woman takes the Coolabah leaf out of its mouth.
  Such a leaf is said always to be found there if the baby was incarnated from
  a Coolabah tree; should this leaf not be removed it will carry the baby back
  to spirit-land. As soon as the leaf is taken away the baby is bathed in cold
  water. Hot gum leaves are pressed on the bridge of its nose to ensure its
  flatness; the more bridgeless the nose the greater the beauty.</p>
  <p>When a baby clutches hold of anything as if to give it to some one, the
  bargie&mdash;grandmother&mdash;or some elderly woman takes what the baby
  offers, and makes a muffled clicking sort of noise with her tongue rolled
  over against the roof of her mouth, then croons the charm which is to make
  the child a free giver: so is generosity inculcated in extreme youth. I have
  often heard the grannies croon over the babies:</p>
  <p>Oonahgnai Birrablee,<br>
  Oonahgnoo Birrahlee,<br>
  Oonahgnoo Birrahlee,<br>
  Oonabmillangoo Birrahlee,<br>
  Gunnoognoo oonah Birrahlee.</p>
  <p>Which translated is:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Give to me, Baby,<br>
  Give to her, Baby,<br>
  Give to him, Baby,<br>
  Give to one, Baby,<br>
  Give to all, Baby.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>As babies are all under the patronage of the moon, the mothers are very
  careful every new moon to make a white cross-like mark on the babies&rsquo; foreheads,
  and white dabs on cheeks and chins.</p>
  <p>And very careful are the mothers not to look at the full moon, nor let their
  babies do so; an attack of thrush would be the result.</p>
  <p>Bahloo, too, has a spiteful way of punishing a woman who has the temerity
  to stare at him, by sending her the dreaded twins.</p>
  <p>If babies do not sleep well their mothers get the red powdered stuff like
  pine pollen, from the joints of the Bingahwingul, or needlebush tree, and
  rub it on the babies&rsquo; skulls and foreheads.</p>
  <p>If the babies cry too much their mothers say evil spirits are in them, and
  must be smoked out. They make a smoke fire of Budtha twigs and hold the baby
  in the thick of the smoke. I have seen the mother of a fretful child of three
  or four years even, apply the smoke anodyne.</p>
  <p>Whenever the mother of a young child woke in the night, if well up in her
  mother duties, she was supposed to warm her hands, and rub her baby&rsquo;s
  joints so that the child might grow lissome and a good shape, and she always
  saw that her baby&rsquo;s mouth was shut when the child was asleep lest an
  evilly disposed person should slip in a disease or evil-working spirit. For
  the same reason they will not let a baby lie on its back unless they cover
  its head.</p>
  <p>If a gilah flies over the camp crying out as it passes, it is a sure sign
  of &lsquo;debbil debbil&rsquo;; the child, to escape evil consequences, must
  be turned on to its left side.</p>
  <p>If a gooloo, or magpie, did the same, the child had to be laid flat on her
  moobil&mdash;stomach: for the passing of a cawing crow, a child had to be
  laid on the right side.</p>
  <p>As these birds are not night birds, it is evident that they are evil spirits
  abroad in bird form, hence the precautions. As soon as a baby begins to crawl,
  the mother finds a centipede, half cooks it, takes it from the fire, and
  catching hold of her child&rsquo;s hands beats them with it, crooning as
  she does so:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Gheerlayi ghilayer,<br>
  Wahl munnoomerhdayer,<br>
  Wahl mooroonbahgoo,<br>
  Yelgayerdayer deermuldayer,<br>
  Gheerlayi ghilayer.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Which means:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Kind be,<br>
  Do not steal,<br>
  Do not touch what to another belongs,<br>
  Leave all such alone,<br>
  Kind be.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The accompaniment being a muffled click of a rolled-up tongue against the
  roof of a mouth.</p>
  <p>No child must touch the big feathers of a goomblegubbon, or bustard&rsquo;s
  wings, nor any of its bones. At the age of about four, the mother takes one
  of these wings and beats the child all over the shoulders and under the arms
  with it. Again making the clicking noise, she croons:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Goobean gillaygoo,<br>
  Oogowahdee goobolaygoo,<br>
  Wahl goonundoo,<br>
  Ghurranbul daygoo.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Which charm means:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A swimmer be,<br>
  Flood to swim against,<br>
  No water,<br>
  Strong to stop you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And so was a child made a good swimmer.</p>
  <p>The wirreenuns would see that the septum of a child&rsquo;s nose was pierced
  at the right time, and their tribal marks cut on them. The nose was pierced
  at midwinter when ice was about, with which to numb the place to be pierced;
  ice was held to the septum, then prod through it went a bone needle.</p>
  <p>An old gin who worked about the station had a pierced nose, and often wore
  a mouyerh, or bone, through it. A white laundress wore earrings. She said
  one day to the old gin:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why you have hole made in your nose and put that bone there? No good
  that. White women don&rsquo;t do that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The black woman looked the laundress up and down, and finally anchored her
  eyes on the earrings.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why you make hole in your ears? No good that. Black gin no do that,
  pull &rsquo;em down your ears like dogs. Plenty good bone in your nose make
  you sing good. Sposin&rsquo; cuggil&mdash;bad&mdash;smell you put bone longa
  nose no smell &lsquo;im. Plenty good make hole longa nose, no good make hole
  longa ears, make &rsquo;em hang down all same dogs.&rsquo; And off she went
  laughing, and pulling down the lobes of her ears, began to imitate the barking
  of a dog.</p>
  <p>There is often a baby betrothal called Bahnmul.</p>
  <p>For some reason or another it has been decided that a baby girl is to be
  given to a man, perhaps because he has been kind to her mother, perhaps she
  is owed to his kin by her own; any way the granny of the baby girl puts feathers,
  white swansdown, on the baby&rsquo;s head, and takes her over to the man
  when she is about a month old. Granny says to the baby:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look at him, and remember him, because you are promised to him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then she takes some feathers off the baby&rsquo;s head and puts them on
  to his; that makes it a formal betrothal, binding to both sides.</p>
  <p>I have heard great camp rows because girls made a struggle for independence,
  having found out they had only been promised, not formally betrothed, to
  some old chap whom they did not wish to marry. Perhaps the old fellow will
  already have a wife or so, a man can have as many as he pleases. I have heard
  of one with three; I have known some with two; but the generality of them
  seem content with one.</p>
  <p>Should a young girl marry a man with an old wife, the old wife rules her
  to any extent, not even letting her have a say about her own children, and
  no duenna could be stricter. Should the young wife in the absence of her
  husband speak to a young man, she will probably get a scolding from the old
  wife and a &lsquo;real hiding&rsquo; from the old man, to whom the old wife
  will report her conduct. Quite young men often marry quite old women; a reason
  sometimes given is that these young men were on earth before and loved these
  same women, but died before their initiation, so could not marry until now
  in their reincarnation.</p>
  <p>Certainly, amongst the blacks, age is no disqualification for a woman; she
  never seems to be too old to marry, and certainly with age gains power.</p>
  <p>At whatever age a girl may be betrothed to a man he never claims her while
  she is yet Mullerhgun, or child girl; not until she is Wirreebeeun, or woman
  girl.</p>
  <p>A girl&rsquo;s initiation into womanhood is as follows. Her granny probably,
  or some old woman relation, takes her from the big camp into the scrub where
  they make a bough shade. As soon as this is made, the old woman sets fire
  to a thick heap of Budtha leaves and makes the girl swallow the smoke. She
  then bids her lie down in a scooped-out hollow she has made in the earth,
  saying to her, &lsquo;You are to be made a young woman now. No more must
  you run about as you please. Here must you stay with me, doing as I say.
  Then in two moons&rsquo; time you shall go and claim your husband, to do
  for ever what he bids you. You must not sleep as you lie there in the day
  time, nor must you go to sleep at night until those in the camp are at rest.
  I will put food ready for you. Honey you must not eat again for four moons.
  At first streak of day you must get up, and eat the food I have placed for
  you. Then when you hear a bird note you must shake yourself all over, and
  make a noise like this.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And the old woman makes a ringing noise with her lips.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That you must do every time you hear a fresh bird note; so too when
  you hear the people in the camp begin to talk, or even if you hear them laugh
  or sneeze. If you do not, then grey will your hair be while you are yet a
  young woman, dull will your eyes be, and limp your body.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Girls have told me that they got very tired of being away with only the
  old woman for so long, and were glad enough when she told them they were
  to move to a new camp, nearer to the big one, which the women had prepared
  for them.</p>
  <p>When they reached this the old woman rubbed off the mud with which she had
  plastered the girl&rsquo;s limbs when first they went away to camp, and which
  she had renewed from time to time. When this was all off she painted the
  girl in different designs with red ochre and white gypsum, principally in
  spots. She put on her head a gnooloogail, or forehead band, made of Kurrajong
  fibre, plaited and tied with some Kurrajong string, from over the ears to
  the back of the head; in this band, which she had painted white, she stuck
  sprays of white flowers. Sweetly scented Budtha and clustering Birah were
  the flowers most used for this ceremony. Should neither of these be in bloom,
  then sprays of Collarene or Coolibah blossom were used. When the flowers
  were placed in the band the old woman scattered a handful of white swansdown
  over the girl&rsquo;s head. Next she tied round her a girdle of opossum&rsquo;s
  sinews with strands of woven opossum&rsquo;s hair hanging about a foot square
  in front. Round her arms she bound goomils&mdash;opossum hair armlets&mdash;into
  which she placed more sprays of flowers, matching those in the girl&rsquo;s
  hair.</p>
  <p>To show that the occasion was a sacred one a sprig of Dheal tree was placed
  through the hole in the septum of the nose. The toilet of a wirreebeeun was
  now complete.</p>
  <p>The old woman gave her a bunch of smoking Budtha leaves to carry, and told
  her what to do. Note here the origin of bridal bouquets.</p>
  <p>Having received her instructions, the girl, holding the smoking twigs, went
  towards the big camp.</p>
  <p>When the women there saw her coming they began to sing a song in, to her,
  a strange language.</p>
  <p>On a log, with his back towards her&mdash;for he must not yet look on her
  face&mdash;sat the man to whom she was betrothed. The girl went up to him.
  As the women chanted louder she threw the smoking Budtha twigs away, placed
  a hand on each of his shoulders and shook him. Then she turned and ran back
  to her new camp, the women singing and pelting her with dry twigs and small
  sticks as she went. For another moon she stayed with her granny in this camp,
  then the women made her another one nearer.</p>
  <p>In a few weeks they made her one on the outskirts of the main camp. Here
  she stayed until they made her another in the camp, but a little apart. In
  front of the opening of this dardurr they made a fire. That night her betrothed
  camped on one side of this fire and she on the other. For a moon they camped
  so. Then the old granny told the girl she must camp on the same side of the
  fire as her betrothed, and as long as she lived be his faithful and obedient
  wife, having no thought of other men. Should he ill-treat her, her relations
  had the power to take her from him. Or should he for some reason, after a
  while, not care for her, he can send her back to her people; should she have
  a child he leaves it with her until old enough to camp away from her, when
  it is returned to him.</p>
  <p>The wedding presents are not given to the bride and bridegroom, but by the
  latter to his mother-in-law, to whom, however, he is never allowed to speak.
  Failing a mother-in-law, the presents are given to the nearest of kin to
  the wife. You can hardly reckon it as purchase money, for sometimes a man
  gives no presents and yet gets a wife.</p>
  <p>In books about blacks, you always read of the subjection of the women, but
  I have seen henpecked black husbands.</p>
  <p>There are two codes of morals, one for men and one for women. Old Testament
  morality for men, New Testament for women. The black men keep the inner mysteries
  of the Boorah, or initiation ceremonies, from the knowledge of women, but
  so do Masons keep their secrets.</p>
  <p>As to the black women carrying most of the baggage on march, naturally so;
  the men want their hands free for hunting en route, or to be in readiness
  for enemies in a strange country.</p>
  <p>Black women think a great deal of the Moonaibaraban, or as they more often
  call them, Kumbuy, or sister-in-law. These are spirit-women who come a few
  days after the Boorah to bring presents to the women relations of the boys
  who have been initiated. The Kumbuy are never seen, but their voices are
  heard&mdash;voices like dogs barking; on hearing which the women in the camp
  have to answer, calling out:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you my Kumbuy?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>An answer comes like a muffled bark, &lsquo;Bah! bah bah!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then the old men&mdash;crafty old men&mdash;go out to where the &lsquo;bahing&rsquo; comes
  from, and bring in the gifts, which take the form of food, yams, honey, fruit
  principally.</p>
  <p>These Kumbuy are among the few beneficent spirits they never hurt any one,
  simply supply the bereaved women with comfort in the shape of food, for the
  temporary loss of their male relatives. Should an uninitiate have a wife,
  which of course is improper, the Kumbuy decline to recognise her; and should
  she presume to answer their spirit back, they make in token of displeasure
  a thudding noise as if earth were being violently banged with a yam stick.
  She has encroached on the Kumbuy preserves, for prior to his initiation a
  man should only have a spirit wife, never an incarnate one.</p>
  <p>If you ask a black woman why the Kumbuy thud the earth in answer to an initiate&rsquo;s
  wife, she will say:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dat one jealous.&rsquo; jealousy even in the spirit world of women!</p>
  <p>Unchaste women were punished terribly. After we went west even the death
  penalty for wantonness was enforced, though at the time we did not know it.</p>
  <p>Should a girl be found guilty of a frailty, it being her first fault, her
  brothers and nearest male relations made a ring round her, after having bound
  her hands and feet, and toss her one from the other until she is in a dazed
  condition and almost frightened to death.</p>
  <p>The punishment over, she is unbound and given to her betrothed, or a husband
  chosen for her.</p>
  <p>Should a woman have been discovered to be an absolute wanton, men from any
  of the clans make a ring round her, she being bound, and tossed from one
  to the other, and when exhausted is unbound and left by her relations to
  the men to do as they please to her&mdash;the almost inevitable result is
  death. With this terror before them, it is possible the old blacks are right
  who say that their women were very different in their domestic relations
  in olden times.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  The Training Of A Boy Up To Boorah Preliminaries</b></h2>
  <p>At the boy manufactory, Boomayahmayahmul, the wood lizard, was the principal
  worker, though Bahloo from time to time gave him assistance.</p>
  <p>The little blacks throw their mythical origin at each other tauntingly.
  A little black girl, when offended with a boy friend, says:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ooh, a lizard made you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wah! wah! a crow made you,&rsquo; he retorts.</p>
  <p>Up to a certain age boys are trained as are girls&mdash;charms sung over
  them to make them generous, honest, good swimmers, and the rest; but after
  that they are taken into the Weedegah, or bachelors&rsquo; camp, and developed
  on manly lines.</p>
  <p>When he is about seven years old, his mother will paint her son up every
  day for about a week with red and white colourings. After that he would go
  to the Weedegah Gahreemai, bachelors&rsquo; camp. He would then be allowed
  to go hunting with boys and men. He would see, now when he was out with the
  men, how fire was made in the olden time, almost a lost art now when wax
  matches are plentiful.</p>
  <p>No boy who had not been to a Boorah would dare to try to make fire.</p>
  <p>The implements for fire-making are a little log about as thick as a man&rsquo;s
  arm, of Nummaybirah wood&mdash;a rather soft white wood&mdash;and a split
  flat piece about a foot long and three inches wide. The little log was split
  open at one end, a wedge put in it, and the opening filled up with dry grass
  broken up. This log was laid on the ground and firmly held there; the fire-maker
  squatted in front, and with the flat piece rubbed edgeways across the opening
  in the log. The sawdust fell quickly into the opening. After about a minute
  and a half&rsquo;s rubbing a smoke started out. After rubbing on a little
  longer the fire-maker took a handful of dry grass, emptied the smoking sawdust
  and dry grass into it, waved it about, and in three and a half minutes from
  starting the process I have seen a blaze. Sometimes it has taken longer,
  but just under five minutes is the longest time I have ever seen it take.</p>
  <p>They use pine too, I believe, but whenever I timed them it was Nummaybirah
  they were using.</p>
  <p>The boys pick up the woodcraft of the tribes when they begin going out with
  the men. As the boys began to grow up, when a good season came round, and
  game and grass were plentiful, the old men were seen to draw apart often
  and talk earnestly.</p>
  <p>At length there came a night when was heard a whizzing, whirling boom far
  in the scrub. As the first echo of it reached the camp, the women, such as
  were still young enough to bear children, stopped their ears, for should
  any such hear the Gurraymi, the women&rsquo;s name for the Gayandi, or Boorah
  spirit&rsquo;s voice, that spirit will first make them mad, then kill them.</p>
  <p>The old women began to sing a Boorah song. To deaden the sound of the dreaded
  voice, opossum rugs were thrown over the children, none of whom must hear,
  unless they are boys old enough to be initiated; the sound reveals the fact
  to such that the hour of their initiation is at hand.</p>
  <p>The men all gathered together with the boys, except two old wirreenuns,
  who earlier in the evening have seemingly quarrelled and gone away into the
  scrub.</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="page062"></a><img src="e00022-images/page062.jpg" alt="image" width="551" height="600"></p>
  <p>The men and boys in camp march up and down to some distance from the camp.
  The old women keep on singing, and one man with a spear painted red with
  a waywah fastened on top, walks up and down in the middle of the crowd of
  men, holding the spear, with its emblematic belt of manhood, aloft; as he
  does so, calling out the names of the bends of the creek, beginning with
  the one nearest to which they are camped. When he gets to the end of the
  names along that creek and comes to the name of a big river, all the men
  join him in giving a loud crow like</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wah! wah! wah!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then he begins with the names along the next creek across the big river,
  and so on; at the mention of each main stream the crowd again join in the
  cry of</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wah! wah! wah!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>All the while, closer and still closer, comes the sound of the Gayandi,
  as the men call the Gurraymi, or bull roarer.</p>
  <p>At length the two old wirreenuns come back to the camp and the noise ceases,
  to recur sometimes during the night, when I expect, did any one search for
  them, the old wirreenuns would be found missing from the camp.</p>
  <p>After the first whirling of the bull roarers and calling of the creek names,
  the Gooyeanawannah, or messengers, prepare for a journey, and when ready,
  the wirreenuns start them off in various directions to summon neighbouring
  tribes from hundreds of miles round to attend the Boorah. The messengers
  each carry a spear with a waywah (or belt of manhood) on the top, seeing
  which no tribe, even at enmity with the messenger, will molest him. When
  a messenger arrived at a strange camp, he was not asked his business but
  left to choose his own time for telling. He would squat down a little way
  from the strangers&rsquo; camp, food would probably be brought to him which
  he would cat.</p>
  <p>He would find out who was the chief wirreenun of the tribe, then take him
  apart, give to him his Boorah message-stick as guarantee of his good faith,
  and tell him where and when the Boorah was to be held. After having given
  all necessary information, the Gooyeanawannah would return to his tribe;
  the wirreenun to whom he had given the Doolooboorah, or message-stick, would
  send it on by the messenger of his tribe, and so with others, until all were
  summoned, each tribe letting it be known that a Boorah summons had been received
  by sounding the Gayandi, which would carry its own tale to those in the camp.</p>
  <p>Should young boys be chosen as messengers, they were held in high honour;
  Woormerh they were called.</p>
  <p>While the messengers were away, the old men of the tribe in whose Noorumbah,
  or hereditary hunting lands, the Boorah was to be held, prepared the sacred
  grounds.</p>
  <p>They cleared a big circle, round which they put a bank of earth, and from
  the circle was cleared a path leading to a thick scrub; along this path were
  low earthen embankments, and the trees on both sides had the bark stripped
  off, and carved on them the various totems and multiplex totems of the tribes.
  Such carvings were also put on the trees round the Bunbul, or little Boorah
  ring, where the branches were also in some instances lopped, and the trunks
  carved and painted to represent figures of men, amongst whom were supposed
  to be the sons of Byamee&rsquo;s wives. Two of these sons had been made young
  men at the first Boorah Byamee instituted in this district, the ground of
  which is pointed out to this day.</p>
  <p>In the middle of the Bunbul a large heap of wood was placed ready for the
  Yungawee, or sacred fire.</p>
  <p>When the preliminary preparations were over, the camps were moved to just
  outside the Boorah, or big Boorah ring. By that time the other tribes began
  to arrive. First came from each tribe the boys to be initiated and the Munthdeeguns,
  or men in charge of them. The men were painted, and had leafy twigs tied
  round their wrists and ankles, as had the boys also, and all carried in their
  hands small branches of green. Those especially in charge of boys held, too,
  a painted spear with a waywah on top of it.</p>
  <p>As they approached the place of gathering the head man, with the painted
  spear, began calling out all the names of the places along the creeks from
  whence he came; at the name of each big watercourse they all cried together</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wah! Wah! wah!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They were met at some distance from the camp by the men who had summoned
  them, and who had made a round brush yard where they were to meet them. Here
  the older women were singing Boorah songs. Some held their breasts as a sign
  they had sons among the initiates; others put their hands on their shoulders,
  which showed they had brothers going to be made young men. All the women
  had leafy twigs tied round their wrists and ankles as the men had. The newcomers
  and the men who met them walked round the yard at a measured beat, lifting
  one leg and throwing up one arm each time the cry of &lsquo;Wah! wah! wah!&rsquo; was
  given, for here too the enumeration of geographical names went on.</p>
  <p>When the Boorah song was over, the men marched out of the yard; closely
  behind them the two oldest men with the tufted spears; the Boorah boys closely
  after them. The women followed, carrying bunches of leafy twigs with which
  they pelted the boys until they reached the camp.</p>
  <p>Matah and I had been watching the whole performance, and followed in the
  wake of the women.</p>
  <p>The whole scene impressed us as picturesque&mdash;the painted figures of
  the men and boys, with the peculiarly native stealthy tread, threading their
  way through the grey Coolabah trees; the decorated women throwing their leafy
  missiles with accurate aim into the ranks of the boys, who did not dare to
  look at their assailants. A Boorah boy must give no evidence of curiosity;
  the <i>nil admirari</i> attitude then begun clings to a black man through
  life. The women of the tribe express voluble surprise, but a black man never
  except by the dilation of his eyes.</p>
  <p>Every night after this a corroboree was held. The fully initiated of each
  tribe, as they arrived, help in the preparation of the inner sacred ground,
  while the younger men collected game and other food.</p>
  <p>The old men cut out of the ground along the narrow path leading to the Bunbul,
  and round it, huge earthen animals, their various totems, such as crocodiles,
  kangaroos, emus and others, all of a colossal size. These they plastered
  over with mud and painted in different colours and designs. On the right
  of the Bunbul they made an earthen figure of Byamee&mdash;this figure was
  reclining holding in each hand a Boondee. On the other side was the huge
  figure of a woman&mdash;this represented Birrahgnooloo, the favourite wife
  of Byamee; she held two spears. There was a third figure not so large as
  the other two but like them, apart from the figures near the path and the
  Bunbul; this was Baillahburrah, according to some, Dillalee according to
  others, the supernatural son of Byamee&mdash;or as some say, brother&mdash;not
  born of woman, having lived before the human race existed, before Byamee
  travelled as Creator and culture hero through Australia.</p>
  <p>Of the Gayandi, the Boorah spirit, sometimes called Wallahgooroonboooan,
  there was no figure, because he was always present at Boorahs, though invisible.
  His voice only gave evidence of his presence.</p>
  <p>The wirreenuns said it was he who had placed in the forks of trees round
  the big ring heaps of dry wood, which they said, when the ceremonies began,
  he would light, making a dazzling illumination of the scene.</p>
  <p>In the middle of the Boorah ring was placed a mudgee, a painted stick or
  spear, with a bunch of hawk&rsquo;s feathers on the top. Every night was
  heard at intervals the Gayandi, and immediately the younger women and children
  stopped their ears, while the old women shrieked their <i>brumboorah</i>.</p>
  <p>As each fresh batch of blacks arrived the volume of sound was increased,
  for the old men with their Gayandi would go into the scrub and whirl them.
  These bull roarers sound curiously uncanny&mdash;I did not wonder the uninitiated
  accepted the spirit theory as to their origin.</p>
  <p>The bush of Australia is a good background for superstition; there is such
  a non-natural air about its Nature, as if it has been sketched in roughly
  by a Beardsley-like artist.</p>
  <p>The function of the Gayandi is to inspire awe, and it fulfils it. Byamee
  himself made the first. It was some time before he got quite the effect he
  wanted. At first he desired to give the Boorah spirit a form as well as a
  voice, to inspire awe; he also wished it to knock out the front tooth of
  an initiate.</p>
  <p>He made a stone figure in the image of man, having a voice. This spirit,
  known variously as Gayandi, or Darramulun, went to the Boorah, but when he
  was to knock out the front tooth, he began to eat the boys&rsquo; faces.
  He was too strong; he would not do to preside over, Boorahs. Byamee transformed
  him into a large piggiebillah-like animal, though instead of being covered
  with spines, thick hair grew over him; he has since been known as Nahgul.
  He went away into the bush, where he has been a dreaded devil ever since;
  for if he touches a man&rsquo;s shadow even, that man will itch all over
  and nothing can cure him of it. He haunts Boorah grounds.</p>
  <p>Next Byamee made a stone bull roarer sort of thing, but this was too heavy
  to make the noise he wanted. One day he was chopping a big Coolabah tree
  close to Weetalibah water-hole, which tree, much to the horror of our blacks,
  was burnt down a few years ago by travellers.</p>
  <p>As Byamee chopped, out flew a big chip. He heard the whizzing sound it made,
  gave another chop, out flew another; again the whizzing sound.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That is what I want,&rsquo; he said I&rsquo;ll make a Gayandi of
  wood.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He cut a piece of mubboo, or beefwood, and shaped it; he tied a piece of
  string to a hole in one end; he hung it up in the big Coolabah tree. Then
  he went and cut one out of Noongah or Kurrajong, tied a string on to that
  and put it beside the other on the tree, and left them swinging there.</p>
  <p>One day he came back and was camping near; his wives, came along to the
  big tree. There the Gayandi swung, making a whirring noise.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; said the women. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll have
  a look what it is.&rsquo; Seeing Byamee they said, &lsquo;We heard voices
  in that big tree over there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Whereabouts?&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In that Coolabah tree. Such strange voices, such as we never heard.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You two go&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to our camp and make a fire. I&rsquo;ll
  go and see what it is.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>When the women were out of sight he went to the tree and took the pieces
  of wood down. He was satisfied now they would answer his purpose. He carefully
  hid them until he made a Boorah. And since then such pieces of wood have
  been the medium for the Gayandi&rsquo;s voice, and are kept carefully hidden
  away from all but the eyes of wirreenuns.</p>
  <p>At length all the expected tribes had arrived, preparations were finished,
  and a signal was given for a move to be made that the real ceremonies might
  begin.</p>
  <p>The fully initiated men went away after their midday meal, and about sundown
  came in single file along the banked-in path each carrying a firestick in
  one hand, a green switch in the other. When they reached the mudgee in the
  middle of the big ring and corroboreed for a little round it, the old women
  answered with a Boorah song, and all moved to the edge of the ring. At this
  stage men often tried to steal each other&rsquo;s boys, and great wrestling
  matches came off. One man would try to pull up the mudgee, out would rush
  one of another clan to wrestle with him. First the boys would wrestle, then
  the elder men, each determined his clan should prove victorious at this great
  Boorah wrestling.</p>
  <p>The skill of the eeramooun, or uninitiated boys, would be tried in sham
  fights too. They were given bark shields, and their attackers had bark boomerangs;
  great was the, applause when the boys ably defended themselves. Previously
  they have been tried with boomerang and boodthul throwing, and other arts
  of sport and warfare, boys of each tribe trying to excel those of the others.
  If a boy comes well out of these trials the men say he is worthy to be a
  yelgidyi, or fully initiated young man.</p>
  <p>When the wrestling and sham fights are over, corroborees begin. All night
  they are kept up, and sometimes there are day performances too.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  The Boorah And Other Meetings</b></h2>
  <p>At last would come the night when everything was ready. Sports and corroborees
  would be held as usual, until, at a given signal, the younger women were
  ordered into bough sheds which were round the ring.</p>
  <p>The old women stayed on singing.</p>
  <p>The boys, who are painted red, are beckoned into the middle of the ring,
  where their respective Munthdeeguns daub them with white. That done, each
  man seizing his charge, hoists him on to his shoulder, and dances round the
  ring with him. Then the old women are told to bid the boys good-bye.</p>
  <p>Forward they come, singing each her own brumboorah, for every oldest woman
  relation of each of the boys makes a song for him. They corroboree a few
  steps behind the men, chanting a farewell, then corroboree back a few steps,
  then hasten to join the younger women in the bough sheds, which are now pulled
  down on top of them by the men, that they may see nothing further. Then the
  Munthdeeguns disappear down the track into the scrub.</p>
  <p>When they are out of sight the women are released, that they may get ready
  to travel to where the Durrawunga, or Little Boorah, will be held in about
  four days&rsquo; time, at about ten miles distance.</p>
  <p>As the Munthdeeguns passed their totem-marked trees, or images, which would
  be those of the boys in their charge&mdash;for each guardian was a relation
  of the same totem as his charge&mdash;they would perform some magical feat,
  such as producing gubberahs, charcoal, gypsum, and so on, uttering as they
  did so a little chant about that totem.</p>
  <p>The boy&rsquo;s eyes are closed all this time and his head bent down.</p>
  <p>Boys at a Boorah always remind me of <i>Wilhelm Meisler&rsquo;s Travels</i>,
  where, at the school to which Wilhelm takes Felix, he learns, on inquiry
  as to the three attitudes assumed by the pupils, that these gestures inculcate
  veneration, which also seems to be the keynote of the eeramooun&rsquo;s instruction.
  The Boorah over, he too, &lsquo;Stands erect and bold, yet not selfishly
  isolated; only in an union with his equals (his fellow initiates) does he
  present a front towards the world.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And only when the fear, the abasement, is gone does the true reverence come,
  which makes the most primitive creed a living religion.</p>
  <p>As the Munthdeeguns pass the sacred fire they throw in a weapon each. This
  done they place their charges in slightly scooped-out places, already prepared
  in the inner ring.</p>
  <p>Then they bid them, on pain of death, not to look up whatever happens.</p>
  <p>Soon a great whirring is heard, telling that Gayandi, the Boorah spirit,
  is near.</p>
  <p>Yudtha Dulleebah, one of the oldest black men in the district, said at this
  stage once two boys did look up.</p>
  <p>The wirreenuns saw them, though the boys did not know it and went on looking.
  These boys saw the men advance each to the fire where they had thrown their
  weapons; chanting in a strange tongue, they corroboreed round the fire for
  some time.</p>
  <p>Then the wirreenuns snatched up the coals left from the weapons and rubbed
  them into their limbs, trampling as they did so on the edge of the fire,
  which did not seem to burn them, rubbing and chanting until the sacred coals
  were supposed to be absorbed by them, from which they would derive new powers.</p>
  <p>This over, the boys were all ordered to get up, and march round, hands on
  thighs and heads abased, while they learnt a Boorah song, giving new words
  for common things, which acted as pass-words hereafter for the initiated.
  Into a slow chant these words were strung, as the men and boys passed round
  the ring, two of the oldest men standing beating time with painted spears
  with tufted tops.</p>
  <p>The two boys who had transgressed before looked up again, curious as to
  their surroundings. Suddenly the men with the spears roared at the boys to
  lower their heads.</p>
  <p>The boys laughed. Their fates were sealed. Out flashed the sacred gubberahs
  of these two old men.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dead is he,&rsquo; they cried, &lsquo;who laughs in the Bunbul where
  yungawee burns more fiercely than Yirangal, the sun, where near lies the
  image of Byamee: Byamee, father of all, whose laws the tribes are now obeying.&rsquo; Then
  the men chanted to the gubberahs and held them between the fires and the
  boys, the light of the flames seemed to play on them and stretch its beams
  to the boys, who began to tremble. As louder grew the chant an answer came
  from the scrub, the voice of Gayandi; shaking with fear the boys fell to
  the ground, to all appearance lifeless. Then the old men went forward, each
  with a stone knife in hand. Stooping over the two boys they opened veins
  in each, out flowed the blood, and the other men all raised a death cry.
  The boys were lifeless. The old wirreenuns, dipping their stone knives in
  the blood, touched with them the lips of all present. Then the bodies were
  put on the edge of the sacred fire and the other initiates taken a little
  further into the scrub. There they were tried in many ways.</p>
  <p>With the Boorah spirits whistling and whizzing all round them, spears were
  pointed at them. Their skins were scratched with stone knives and mussel
  shells. Hideously painted, fiendish-looking creatures suddenly rushed upon
  them. Should they show fear and quail at the Little Boorah they would be
  returned to their mothers as cowards unfit for initiation, and sooner or
  later sympathetic magic would do its work, a poison-stick or bone would end
  them. Or if one of the initiates was considered stupid and generally incapable,
  having been brought to the Boorah for that purpose, he was now, after having
  been made to suffer all sorts of indignities, such as eating filth and so
  on, bound to the earth, strapped down, killed, and his body burnt.</p>
  <p>When the trials were over and the old wirreenuns said to the boys who had
  not quailed, &lsquo;You are brave; you shall be boorahbayyi first and afterwards
  yelgidyi, and carry the marks that all may know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then they made on the shoulder of each boy a round hole with a pointed stone;
  this hole they licked to feel no splinter of stone remained, then filled
  it with powdered charcoal.</p>
  <p>After this, leaving the boys there, the men went back to the Bunbul ring.
  The bodies of the Boorah victims were cooked. Each man who had been to five
  Boorahs ate a piece of this flesh, no others were allowed even to see this
  done. Then the bones and what was left of the bodies were put into the middle
  of the fire, and all traces of the victims so destroyed.</p>
  <p>The men then sang a song, saying that so must always be served those who
  scoffed at sacred things; that the strength they had wasted should go into
  other men who would use it better; while the spirits of the victims should
  wander about until reincarnated if the Boorah spirit gave them another chance.
  Perhaps he would only let them be reincarnated in animals.</p>
  <p>After another dance and chant round the yungawee, the men went and brought
  the boys back again. They came with their hands on their thighs, and their
  heads abased; each was taken to his allotted place near the outer edge of
  the ring. There each Munthdeegun told his boy he could sleep that night;
  he would go to sleep the boy he had been, to wake in the morning a new man;
  his courage had now been tried, and in the morning a new name and a sacred
  stone would be given to him. The Gayandi would settle their names that night
  and tell the wirreenuns.</p>
  <p>The next morning the boys were awakened by the Munthdeegun chanting and
  dancing before them. They stopped in front of the first boy, called him to
  rise by a new name; as he did so all the men clapped their thighs and shouted</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wah! wah! wah!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then an old wirreenun gave him a small white gubberah, which he was bidden
  to keep concealed for ever from the uninitiated and the women, and he must
  be ready to produce it whenever called upon to do so. The result of failure
  would be fatal to him. With the loss of the stone his life spirit would be
  weakened, and the strength of the Boorah spirit, with which he was now endowed,
  be used against him instead of for him, as would be the case as long as he
  kept the stone.</p>
  <p>These stones seem somewhat in the way of &lsquo;Baetyli&rsquo; of pagan
  antiquity, which were of round form; they were supposed to be animated, by
  means of magical incantations, with a portion of the Deity; they were consulted
  on occasions of great and pressing emergency as a kind of divine oracle,
  and were suspended either round the neck or some other part of the body.</p>
  <p>As each boy received his stone another loud chorus of &lsquo;Wah! wah! wah!&rsquo; went
  up from that crowd, making the scrub ring with the sound.</p>
  <p>Some of those, of whose tribe it was the custom&mdash;it is not invariably
  so&mdash;now had a front tooth knocked off; this done a wirreenun chanted
  to the boy, who had been blindfolded and almost deafened by the whirring
  of Gayandi.</p>
  <p>One chant was as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p>Now you can meet the Boorah spirit,<br>
  Now will he harm you not.<br>
  He will know his spirit is in you.<br>
  For this is the sign,<br>
  A front tooth gone.<br>
  That is his sign,<br>
  He will know you by it.</p>
  <p>Some of the wirreenuns buried these teeth by the Boorah fire, others carefully
  wrapped them up to keep as charms, or to send to other tribes, each according
  to the individual custom of his tribe.</p>
  <p>This all over, once more there was a marching and chanting round the fire,
  then the boys were taken away and given food for the first time since they
  left their mothers.</p>
  <p>No wonder that the &lsquo;supernatural&rsquo; was mixed up with their impressions
  of the Boorah: fasting nourishes hallucinations. While the boys were eating,
  they could hear in the distance other chants, and knew that ceremonies were
  going on to which they were not yet to be admitted, there being degrees of
  initiation.</p>
  <p>On the fourth day the men took them about ten miles, and camped with them
  where they could hear faintly in the distance the noise of the main camp;
  so they knew they were near the place chosen for the Durramunga, or Little
  Boorah.</p>
  <p>Just before dawn next morning each Munthdeegun took his Boorahbayyi, or
  partially initiated one, to the Durramunga. There was a Boorah ring, but
  instead of earth, grass was heaped all round it. No young women were visible,
  only the old women, who sang and corroboreed towards the boys. Slowly they
  came forward, peered at their shoulders, and seeing there the marks, embraced
  them, shrieking out cries of joy that their boys had borne the tests. They
  danced round them, then at a sign from the old men embraced them again; and
  while, the women sang their brumboorah and danced, the boys were taken away
  by their guardians.</p>
  <p>For two moons they remained away, learning much as to sacred things. They
  were told that the oldest wirreenuns could see in their sacred crystals pictures
  of the past, pictures of what was happening at a distance in the present,
  and pictures of the future; some of which last filled their minds with dread,
  for they said as time went on the colours of the blacks, as seen in these
  magical stones, seemed to grow paler and paler, until at last only the white
  faces of the Wundah, or spirits of the dead, and white devils were seen,
  as if it should mean that some day no more blacks should be on this earth.</p>
  <p>The reason of this must surely be that the tribes fell away from the Boorah
  rites, and in his wrath Byamee stirred from his crystal seat in Bullimah.
  He had said that as long as the blacks kept his sacred laws, so long should
  he stay in his crystal seat, and the blacks live on earth; but if they failed
  to keep up the Boorah rites as he had taught them, then he would move and
  their end would come, and only Wundah, or white devils, be in their country.</p>
  <p>It is said that this prophetic vision was the reason that so many of the
  first-born half-caste babies were killed, the old wirreenuns seeing in them
  the beginning of the end.</p>
  <p>At the end of two moons they make back towards the place where the Boorah
  had begun, and where preparations were now being made to receive them.</p>
  <p>They camped in the scrub near the old camp of the tribe who had started
  the Boorah.</p>
  <p>That night in the camp the Gayandi was heard again, another ceremony was
  at hand.</p>
  <p>The next day the women at the big camp made a big fire, a little distance
  away. When this fire was nearly burnt out they covered it thickly with Budtha,
  Dheal, and Coolabah leaves to make a great smoke. On the top of these leaves,
  which were piled about two feet high, logs were placed; this fire was round
  a Dheal tree.</p>
  <p>When the thick smoke was seen curling up in a column, the Boorahbayyi were
  brought out of the scrub by the Munthdeegun, while in the distance sounded
  the whizzing voice of the Boorah spirit. As it ceased, when the women&rsquo;s
  chanting rose above it, the painted boys came into the open. On they came,
  heads down and hands on thighs, looking neither to the right nor to the left,
  but walking straight ahead until they stood on the logs on the fire. They
  leaned over and placed a hand each on the tree in the centre, there they
  stood while the smoke curled all round them. The women past child-bearing
  were singing all the time, while the men danced outside the leaf-smoke, clicking
  boomerangs as they did so.</p>
  <p>For some time this went on, then the men took the boys back into the scrub.</p>
  <p>In about four moons&rsquo; time another leaf-smoke was made ready, and the
  Boorahbayyi were again brought out and smoked. This time while chanting a
  song the old women brought a big net and put it right over the boys. Then
  they stepped back and danced round to the clicking of boomerangs by the men.
  The boys were again taken away.</p>
  <p>But after this they were allowed to camp nearer the general camp, though
  they held no intercourse with the people of it. I have often met these Boorah
  boys in the bush, and on sighting me they have fled as if I were a devil
  in petticoats.</p>
  <p>In about another moon&rsquo;s time, the boys were painted principally white,
  a waywah put on them, a yunbean&mdash;a piece of beefwood gum with two kangaroo
  teeth stuck in it, and a hole through it&mdash;was tied to their front lock
  of hair. A number of these yunbean were tied to forehead bands, which they
  wore too. Armlets of opossum&rsquo;s hair string were put on their arms,
  and feathers stuck in them. Feathers were also stuck upright in the forehead
  bands.</p>
  <p>Some of the old men added to their own decorations by putting on wongins,
  from which were hanging those most precious possessions to inland blacks&mdash;seaside
  shells. Some had fresh beads of gum fastened on to their hair, hanging round
  their heads in dozens.</p>
  <p>The women, too, had coiffured themselves with fresh gum beads; the mothers
  of the Boorahbayyi were painted, too, in corroboree style. They had made
  a smoke fire, but the logs instead of being put on it, were placed at a little
  distance; on these the painted boys sat, the smoke enveloping them.</p>
  <p>After they had been seated there some time, their mothers came up behind
  them, and put their hands on their sons&rsquo; shoulders. Then they rubbed
  all the paint off the boys&rsquo; bodies; the boys never once looking at
  them. When the paint was all off, the women sang and danced, until the men
  in charge took the boys away again.</p>
  <p>After this, supervision was relaxed except at night. During the day-time
  the boys might wander at will, so as they kept clear of the general camp.
  They might not receive food from nor speak to a woman for twelve months,
  as if they were monks of Byamee in training.</p>
  <p>At his second Boorah a young man was allowed to see the sacred fire ceremony,
  throwing in of weapons, walking on burning coals, and the rest. He saw the
  huge earthen figures of Byamee, Birrahgnooloo, and Baillahburrah, or Dillalee,
  and was told all about them; that Byamee having initiated the Boorah, only
  such as have been through its rites can go to his sky-camp.</p>
  <p>Three sins are unforgiveable, and commit a spirit of a guilty one to continual
  movement in the lower world of the Eleanbah Wundah, where, but for big fires
  kept up, would be darkness.</p>
  <p>There the guilty one had to keep his right hand at his side, never moving
  it, but he himself perpetually moving. Those who know the blacks and their
  love of a &lsquo;dolce far niente,&rsquo; will understand what a veritable
  hell this perpetual movement would make.</p>
  <p>The three deadly sins were unprovoked murder, lying to the elders of the
  tribe, or stealing a woman within the forbidden degrees&mdash;that is, of
  the same hereditary totem, i.e. of the same blood, or of the prohibited family
  name clan.</p>
  <p>But by a curious train of reasoning two wrongs make a right. Should by any
  chance a man succeed in getting a wife he had no right to, having lived with
  her, he could keep her, if he came unhurt from the trial he had to stand;
  he only having a shield to defend himself with, the men of the stolen woman&rsquo;s
  kin threw weapons at him. Only the men of her kin are assailants, not as
  in a murder trial, when the men of all kins can throw at the guilty man.
  Should he defend himself successfully, he can keep the woman on the understanding
  that a woman of his family is given to a man of hers, to square things. A
  man who stands his trial is called a Booreenbayyi.</p>
  <p>Kindliness towards the old and sick is strictly inculcated as a command
  of Byamee, to whom all breaches of his laws are reported by the all-seeing
  spirit at a man&rsquo;s death, and he is judged accordingly. Sir Thomas Mitchell,
  writing in 1837 his experiences of the blacks during his explorations, notices
  as very striking their care and affection for the aged of their race.</p>
  <p>At his second Boorah a man is allowed to see the carvings on the trees and
  to hear the legends of them. Also to hear the Boorah song of Byamee, which
  Byamee himself sang; and to hear the prayer of the oldest wirreenun to Byamee,
  asking him to let the blacks live long, for they have been faithful to his
  charge as shown by the observance of the Boorah ceremony.</p>
  <p>The old wirreenun says words to this effect several times imploringly, his
  head turned to the east; facing this direction the dead are mostly buried.</p>
  <p>Though we say that actually these people have but two attempts at prayers,
  one at the grave and one at the inner Boorah ring, I think perhaps we are
  wrong. These two seem the only ones directly addressed to Byamee. But perhaps
  it is his indirect aid which is otherwise invoked. Daily set prayers seem
  to them a foolishness and an insult, rather than otherwise, to Byamee. He
  knows; why weary him by repetition, disturbing the rest he enjoys after his
  earth labours? But a prayer need not necessarily be addressed to the highest
  god. I think if we really understood and appreciated the mental attitude
  of the blacks, we should find more in their so-called incantations of the
  nature of invocations. When a man invokes aid on the eve of a battle, or
  in his hour of danger and need; when a woman croons over her baby an incantation
  to keep him honest and true, and that he shall be spared in danger, surely
  these croonings are of the nature of prayers born of the same elementary
  frame of mind as our more elaborate litany. I fancy inherent devotional impulses
  are common to all races irrespective of country or colour.</p>
  <p>When the prayer was over the old men chanted Byamee&rsquo;s song, which
  only the fully initiated may sing, and which an old black fellow chanted
  for us as the greatest thing he could do.</p>
  <p>There seemed very little in this song, for no one can translate it, the
  meaning having been lost in the &lsquo;dark backward,&rsquo; if it was ever
  known to the Euahlayi.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Byamee guadoun.<br>
  Byamee guadoun.<br>
  Byamee guadoun.<br>
  Mungerh wirree.<br>
  Mungerh wirree.<br>
  Mungerh wirree.<br>
  Birree gunyah, birrie gunyah.<br>
  Dilbay gooran mulah bungarn.<br>
  Oodoo doo gilah.<br>
  Googoo wurra wurra.</p>
  <p>Bulloo than nulgah delah boombee nulgah.<br>
  Delah boombee. Nulgah delah boombee boombee.<br>
  Buddereebah . . . . . . Eumoolan.<br>
  Dooar wullah doo. Boombee nulgah delah.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The old fellow said wherever Byamee had travelled this song was known, but
  no one now knew the meaning of the whole, not even the oldest wirreenuns.</p>
  <p>Another stone was given to a Boorahbayyi when he first heard this song.</p>
  <p>The wirreenuns, they say, swallow their stones to keep them safe.</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="page080"></a><img src="e00022-images/page080.png" alt="image" width="800" height="643"></p>
  <p>At each Boorah a taboo is taken off food. After a third Boorah a man could
  eat fish, after a fourth honey, after a fifth what he liked. He was then,
  too, shown and taught the meanings of the tribal message-sticks, and the
  big Boorah one of Byamee. As few men now have ever been to five Boorahs,
  few know anything about these last. At each Boorah a stone was given to a
  man, and when he had the five he could marry.</p>
  <p>After each Boorah all the figures and embankments are destroyed.</p>
  <p>After the fifth Boorah the mystery of the Gayandi was revealed and the bull
  roarers shown&mdash;oval pieces of wood pointed at both ends, fastened to
  a string and swung round; but though this was shown, the wirreenuns told
  them that the spirit&rsquo;s voice was really in this wood animating it.
  After a man has been to one Boorah he can have war weapons and is a warrior,
  but not until he has been to five can he join or be one of the dorrunmai&mdash;sort
  of chiefs&mdash;who hold councils of war, but have few privileges beyond
  being accepted authorities as to war and hunting. With the wirreenuns rests
  the real power, by reason of their skill in magic.</p>
  <p>Besides Boorahs are minor corroboree meetings where marriages are arranged;
  meetings where the illegality of marriages is gone into, and, if necessary,
  exchanges effected or arranged; meetings where the wirreenuns of the Boogahroo
  produce the bags of hair, etc., and vendettas are sworn; meetings of Boodther,
  or giving, where each person receives and gives presents. A person who went
  to a Boodther without a goolay full of presents would be thought a very poor
  thing indeed.</p>
  <p>Of course every meeting has a corroboree as part of it.</p>
  <p>Every totem even has its own special corroboree and time for having it,
  as the Beewees, or iguanas, when the pine pollen is failing and the red dust-storms
  come. And if you abused these dust-storms to a Beewee black, you would insult
  him: it is not dust, it is the pollen off the pines, and so a multiplex totem
  to him!</p>
  <p>The winds belong to various totems, and the rains are claimed by the totem
  whose wind it was that blew it up.</p>
  <p>If a storm comes up without wind it belongs to Bohrah, the kangaroo.</p>
  <p>The big mountainous clouds when they come from the south-west are said to
  be Mullyan, the eagle-hawk, who makes the south-west wind claimed by Maira,
  paddy melon totem, one of whose multiplex totems Mullyan is.</p>
  <p>The crow keeps the cold west wind in a hollow log, as she was too fond of
  blowing up hurricanes; she escapes sometimes, but the crow hunts her back.
  But they say the log is rotting and she will get away yet, when there will
  be great wreckage and quite a change in climates.[Here we see the usual antagonism
  of crow and eagle-hawk.&mdash;A. L.]</p>
  <p>Away to the north-west a tribe of blacks have almost a monopoly in wind-making,
  holding great corroborees to sing these hurricanes up. One of this tribe
  came to the station once and wanted to marry a girl there. She would not
  consent, and told him to go home. He went, threatening to send a storm to
  wreck the station. The storm came; the house escaped, but stable, store,
  and cellar were unroofed. I told my Black-but-Comelys to kindly avoid such
  vehemently revengeful lovers for the future.</p>

  Chiefly As To Funerals And Mourning</b></h2>
  <p>I was awakened one morning on the station by distant wailing.</p>
  <p>A wailing that came in waves of sound, beginning slowly and lowly, to gain
  gradually in volume until it reached the full height or limit of the human
  voice, when gradually, as it had risen, it fell again. No shrieking, just
  a wailing inexpressibly saddening to hear.</p>
  <p>I lay for some minutes not realising what the sound was, yet penetrated
  by its sorrow. Then came consciousness. It was from the blacks&rsquo; camp,
  and must mean death. Beemunny, the oldest woman of the camp, who for weeks
  had been ill, must now be dead.</p>
  <p>Poor old Beemunny, who was blind and used to get her great-granddaughter,
  little Buggaloo, to lead her up to the tree outside my window, under whose
  shade she had spent so many hours, telling me legends of the golden age when
  man, birds, beasts, trees, and elements spoke a common language. But the
  day before I had been to the camp to hear how she was. The old women were
  sitting round her; one of the younger ones told me her end had nearly come.</p>
  <p>The Boolees, or whirlwinds, with the Mullee Mullees of her enemies in, had
  been playing round and through the camp for days, they said, watching to
  seize her fleeting spirit&mdash;a sure sign the end was near. That night
  surely would come Yowee, the skeleton spirit, with the big head and fiery
  eyes, whose coming meant death.</p>
  <p>Last night more than one of the blacks had dreamt of an emu, which meant
  misfortune to one of that totem, which was Beemunny&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>As Yellen spoke in a hushed sad voice, suddenly, though no breath of wind
  was stirring, sprang up on the edge of the camp a boolee, rearing its head
  as if it were a living thing. Round it whirled, snatching the dead leaves
  of the Coolabahs, swirling them with the dust it gathered into a spiral column,
  which sped, as if indeed a spirit animated it, straight to the camp of the
  dying woman. Round and round it eddied, a dust-devil dancing a dance of death.</p>
  <p>The watchers drew nearer to Beemunny, who was past heeding even the spirits
  of evil.</p>
  <p>The women in other camps clutched their children to them, but spoke no word.
  All was silent but the swirling leaves as the column gathered them. Finding
  the deathbed guarded, the boolee turned sharply from the camp and sped away
  down the road, dissolving on the poligonum flat in the distance.</p>
  <p>Yellen gave a sigh of relief.</p>
  <p>But now her fears were verified; Beemunny was dead.</p>
  <p>Poor old Beemunny! How the vanities of youth cling to one; how we are &lsquo;all
  sisters under the skin.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She was ever so old, she was blind, her face was scarred with wrinkles,
  yet one of her beauties remained, and she absolutely joyed in its possession:
  it was her hair. Her hair was thick and fuzzy, when combed would stand nearly
  straight out, which is quite unusual with the native women&rsquo;s hair in
  that part. Beemunny one day asked one of the younger women if I had ever
  heard what a lot of lovers she had had in her youth, what fights there had
  been over her, and all because of her beautiful hair.</p>
  <p>Poor old Beemunny! Something in my own woman nature went out to her in sympathy.
  She was old, she was ugly, her husband was dead, as were all men to her.</p>
  <p>Poor old Beemunny! Having once learnt her vanity, I never passed her without
  saying &lsquo;Gubbah Tekkul!&rsquo; &lsquo;Beautiful hair!&rsquo; at which
  she would beam and toss her head.</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="page084"></a><img src="e00022-images/page084.jpg" alt="image" width="850" height="574"></p>
  <p>At sunrise came again the wailing; the singing of the Goohnai, or dirge,
  wherein are enumerated all the multiplex totems of the deceased, crooned
  in a wailing way, and each fresh person who comes to the camp sings this
  dirge again. In olden times all would have been painted in full war paint,
  weapons in hand, to see the corpse.</p>
  <p>I was given permission to go to the funeral, old Bootha was to take me.</p>
  <p>I heard that Beemunny had died early in the night. Her daughter and nearest
  of kin had sat all night beside her body, with each a hand on it to guard
  her from the spirits. She was now in her bark coffin, round which were her
  own blankets to be buried with her. The coffin was made of bark cut off right
  round a tree, split on one side from end to end; the body was placed in this,
  then the bark lapped over it, the ends were blocked up with other pieces,
  the whole secured by ropes. All day until the burial some one of kin stayed
  beside the coffin, little fires of Budtha kept smoking all the while. In
  the afternoon old Bootha came for me, and we set out.</p>
  <p>First in the procession marched two old men of the tribe, behind them some
  young men, then those in charge of the coffin and the two nearest women relations,
  immediately behind them the old women, then the young women. No women with
  babies were allowed to go, nor any children. I came last with old Bootha.</p>
  <p>The procession moved along an old winding track on the top of a moorilla,
  or pebbly ridge, pine-trees overarching in places carving the sky into a
  dome&mdash;a natural temple through which we walked to the burial-ground.</p>
  <p>Every now and then we heard a bird note, which made the women glance at
  each other and say, first, &lsquo;Guadgee,&rsquo; then &lsquo;Bootha,&rsquo; as
  it came again, and a third time &lsquo;Hippitha.&rsquo; To my uneducated
  ear the note seemed the same each time. I asked Bootha what it was. She told
  me it was the note of a little bird, something like a wren, called Durrooee,
  in whose shape the spirits of dead women revisited the earth. It seems that
  Numbardee, the first woman, was, like Milton&rsquo;s Eve, a caterer; she
  acquired art in beating the roots of plants into flat cakes much esteemed;
  she was never to be met without some, carrying them always in a bag across
  her shoulders.</p>
  <p>And Byamee was so pleased with her for always having food for the hungry
  that, when at length she died, he allowed her to revisit her old gahreemai,
  or camp, her spirit returning in the form of the little honey-eater bird,
  Durrooee; and all women after her had a like privilege if they had done their
  duty in life. These birds are sacred; no one must harm them, nor even imitate
  their cry. It would be hard to hurt them, for the spirit in them is so strong.
  If any one even takes up a stick or stone to throw at them, hardly is it
  raised from the ground when the would-be assailant is forcibly knocked over,
  though he sees nothing but the little bird he was about to attack. Then he
  knows the bird must be a spirit bird, and perhaps seeing him look at her,
  the bird calls a woman&rsquo;s name, then he knows whose spirit it is.</p>
  <p>A black boy on the station was badly hurt by a fall from a tree. It had
  seemed strange that such a good climber should fall. The blacks said it was
  because there was a Durrooee&rsquo;s nest in that tree, the spirit had knocked
  him down, and for a time so paralysed the man with him that he could not
  move to his assistance. Needless to say, they have avoided that tree since.</p>
  <p>In the distance we heard the sound of the grave being dug. None of the same
  totem as the dead person must dig the grave. The coffin was put down beside
  the grave, the daughter and other nearest women relations stayed with it,
  the other women went away into the bush in one direction, some of the men
  in another.</p>
  <p>Old Hippi heaped up some Budtha twigs he had gathered, I noticed as we came
  along; these he set fire to, and made a dense smoke which hung low over the
  open grave and spread over the old graves.</p>
  <p>Hippi smoked himself in this smoke. The women came back with arms full of
  small branches of the sacred Dheal tree, these they laid beside the grave,
  then sat down and broke them into small twigs; the old women had twigs put
  through the bored hole in their noses.</p>
  <p>The men came back with some pine saplings; two of these they laid at the
  bottom of the grave, which was about five feet deep. On these pines they
  spread strips of bark, then a thick bed of Dheal twigs; then a woman handed
  a bag containing the belongings of the dead woman&mdash;boogurr they were
  called&mdash;to the oldest male relative, who was standing in the grave;
  he placed it as a pillow at one end. Then Hippi and the daughter&rsquo;s
  husband took each an end of the coffin and lowered it into the grave; the
  daughter cried loudly as they did so. Over the coffin they laid a rug, and
  on the rug they placed Beemunny&rsquo;s yam stick. Hippi signalled to the
  daughter, who then came with the other women close to the edge of the grave.
  She sat at one end, looked over into the grave, and called out: &lsquo;My
  mother! Oh, my mother! Come back to me, my mother! My mother that I have
  been with always, why did you leave me?&rsquo; Then she wailed the death-wail,
  which the other women caught up. As the wail died away, Hippi said:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She has gone from us; never as she was will she return.<br>
  Never more as she once did will she chop honey.<br>
  Never more with her gunnai dig yams.<br>
  She has gone from us; never as she was to return.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>As he finished all the women wailed again, and loudest of all the daughter.
  Then the old man in the grave said:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mussels there are in the creek and plenty,<br>
  But she who lies here will dig no more.<br>
  We shall fish as of old for cod-fish,<br>
  But she who lies here will beg no more oil,<br>
  Oil for her hair, she will want no more.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then again the women wailed.</p>
  <p>Old Hippi said, as the other man, in a sort of recitative</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never again will she use a fire.<br>
  Where she goes fires are not.<br>
  For she goes to the women, the dead women,<br>
  And women can make no fires.<br>
  Fruit is there in plenty and grass seed,<br>
  But no birds nor beasts in the heaven of woman.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Again the women wailed, wail after wail. Then they handed the remaining
  twigs of Dheal to the men, who laid them on the top of the coffin, then bark
  again over the twigs, and pine saplings on them, on top some old rugs.</p>
  <p>While this was being done the old, old gins danced slowly a corroboree step
  round the edge of the grave, crooning a Goohnai-wurrai or dirge.</p>
  <p>Then the men began to throw in the earth, the oldest male relative of the
  deceased standing in the grave to guard the body until the earth covered
  the coffin. As thud after thud went the earth in, the daughter shrieked and
  swayed over as if to fall into the grave, but her friend drew her back. She
  called &lsquo;Mother! mother!&rsquo; took a sharp stone which was beside
  her and hit it against her head until the blood gushed out. They took the
  stone from her. There she sat rocking her body to and fro, wailing all the
  time, the other women wailing too, until the grave was quite covered in.</p>
  <p>When it was filled in Hippi made another big smoke, thoroughly smoked himself,
  calling to all the men to do the same.</p>
  <p>An old woman made a big smoke behind where the women were sitting; she called
  them one by one and made them stand in the thick of it for a while.</p>
  <p>Hippi said something to her. I caught the word &lsquo;Innerah&rsquo;&mdash;they
  called me Innerah, which meant literally a woman with a camp of her own.
  The old woman gave the smoke fire a stir, and out at once came a thick column
  of smoke circling round my guest and myself.</p>
  <p>They covered the grave with logs and boughs and then swept round it.</p>
  <p>All was over, we turned homewards. As we did so a flock of screeching gilahs
  flew over, their bright rose colouring lighting up the sombre scene where
  the only colour was that of the dark pines silhouetted against a sky from
  which the blue had now faded. Going home Bootha told me that the smoking
  process was to keep the spirits away, and to disinfect us from any disease
  the dead might have; and she said had we not been smoked the spirits might
  have followed us back to the house.</p>
  <p>They would at once change their camp; the old one would be gummarl&mdash;a
  tabooed place; but before they left it they would burn smoke fires there
  to scare away the spirits.</p>
  <p>I asked her why they swept round the grave. She said, in case the dead person
  had been poisoned or killed by magic; and, indeed, so little do they allow
  the possibility of death from natural causes, they even said old Beemunny
  had been given poison in her honey by an old-time rejected lover. Well, by
  sweeping round the grave they would see what track was on the swept place
  next morning, and according to that they would know to what totem the murderer
  belonged. If the track should be an iguana&rsquo;s, then one of the Beewee,
  or iguana totem, was guilty; if an emu, then one of the Dinewan, or emu totem,
  and so on.</p>
  <p>Old Hippi joined me a little further on. He explained that the service was
  not as it would have been some years ago. That I knew, because when I first
  went to the station I had seen them going to funerals all decorated as if
  for corroborees. Round their waists, wrists, knees and ankles had been twigs
  of Dheal, the sacred tree, and the rest of their bodies had been painted.</p>
  <p>Hippi said a great deal more would have been spoken and sung at the grave
  if the dead person had been a man. His spirit would have in a short sort
  of prayer been commended to Byamee, who would have been intreated to let
  the dead enter Bullimah (heaven), as he had kept the Boorah laws&mdash;that
  is, of course, if he had been initiated: the spirits of the uninitiated wander
  until they are reincarnated, and never enter Bullimah. One curious coincidence
  occurred in connection with this burial.</p>
  <p>Seeing the droughty desolation of the country, as we walked to the grave,
  I asked old Bootha when she thought it would rain again. Coming very close
  to me she half whispered:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In three days I think it; old woman dead tell me when she dying that &ldquo;&lsquo;sposin&rdquo; she
  can send &rsquo;em rain, she send &lsquo;im three days when her Yowee bulleerul&mdash;spirit
  breath&mdash;go long Oobi Oobi.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Beemunny died on Wednesday night. On Saturday when we went to bed the skies
  were as cloudless as they had been for weeks. In the middle of the night
  we were awakened by the patter of rain-drops on the iron roof. All night
  it rained, and all the next day.</p>
  <p>It is said that a dead person always sends rain within a week of his death
  to wash out his tracks on earth.</p>
  <p>One little black girl told me she always felt sad when she saw thunderclouds,
  because she thought some dead person had sent them.</p>
  <p>As a rule, there is a good deal more shedding of blood over a grave than
  I saw. This blood offering is said to please the dead, being a proof to them
  of the affection of the living. It is funeral etiquette to prepare yourself
  with a weapon with which to shed this blood, but likewise etiquette for a
  friend to intervene and stop your self-mutilation.</p>
  <p>On emerging from the grave the spirit finds the spirits of his dead relations
  waiting to go with him to Oobi Oobi, that is, a sacred mountain whose top
  towers into the sky, nearly touching Bullimah. The new spirit recognises
  his relations at once; they had, many of them, been round the death-bed visible
  at the last to the dying, though not to any of the watchers with him, though
  these are said sometimes to hear the spirit voices.</p>
  <p>The spirit from the grave carried with him the twigs of the sacred Dheal
  tree which were placed over and under his body; he follows his spirit relations,
  dropping these twigs as he goes along, leaving thus a trail that those who
  follow may see. At the top of Oobi Oobi he finds the spirits called Mooroobeaigunnil,
  whose business it is to bridge over the distance a spirit has to traverse
  between the top of the mountain and Bullimah, the great Byamee&rsquo;s sky-camp.</p>
  <p>One of these Mooroobeaigunnil seizes him and hoists him on to his shoulders;
  then comes another and hoists the first; and so on, until the one holding
  the spirit can lift him into Bullimah. As the spirit is hoisted in, one of
  the Mooroobeaigunnil, knocks the lowest one in the ladder of spirits down;
  thud to the earth come the rest, making a sound like a thunderclap, which
  the far away tribes hear, and hearing say:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A spirit has entered Bullimah.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Should a big meteor fall followed by a thunderclap, it is a sign that a
  great man has died. Should a number of stars shoot off from a falling star,
  it is a sign that a man has died leaving a large family. When a star is seen
  falling in the day-time, it is a sign that one of the Noongahburrah tribe
  dies.</p>
  <p>In the olden time some of the tribes would keep a body at least five days.
  Then they would rub the outside black skin off, make an opening in the side
  of the body, take out the internal parts, fill it up with Dheal leaves. They
  would place the rubbed-off skin and internals in bark and put it in hollow
  trees. They would then bury the body, which they said would come up white.</p>
  <p>Sometimes they would keep their dead for weeks, that they might easily extract
  the small joint bones with which to make poison.</p>
  <p>A baby&rsquo;s body they would sometimes carry for years before burying,
  but it would usually have been well smoke-dried first, though not, I believe,
  invariably so.</p>
  <p>Sometimes a body was kept so that relations from a distance might come and
  see for themselves the death was not the result of foul play.</p>
  <p>After the body was filled up with Dheal leaves it was put into its bark
  coffin and smoke fires made round it.</p>
  <p>As each relation arrived he was blindfolded and led up to the corpse, which
  was held up standing by some of the men. When the blindfolded relation came
  near, the bandage was taken off him and before him he saw standing his relation,
  whom he examined to see if wounds were visible. If signs of violence were
  apparent, the murderer had to be discovered and stand his trial. He was given
  a shield to defend himself with. Every man had a right to throw a weapon
  at him; should he manage to defend himself successfully, as far as that crime
  was concerned he would be henceforth a free man, no stigma attaching to him
  whatever. In which, I fancy, the blacks show themselves a larger-minded people
  than their white supplanters, who make this world no place for repentance
  for wrong-doers, &lsquo;though they seek it with tears.&rsquo; In the world&rsquo;s
  opinion there is no limit to a man&rsquo;s sentence. We read the letter of
  the Gospel, and leave the spirit of it to the blacks to apply.</p>
  <p>Should there be a difficulty as to discovering the criminal, all the men
  of the tribes amongst whom the murderer could be stand round the coffin.
  A head man says to the corpse, &lsquo;Did such and such a man harm you?&rsquo; naming,
  one after another, all the men. At the guilty one&rsquo;s name the corpse
  is said to knock a sort of rap, rap, rap.</p>
  <p>That man has to stand his trial.</p>
  <p>But as a rule the blacks like to bury their dead quickly, because the spirit
  haunts their neighbourhood or its late camp until the body is buried. Mysterious
  lights are said to be seen at night, and there is a general scare in camp-land
  until a corpse is safely buried.</p>
  <p>There are variations in the funeral rites of nearly every tribe. Even in
  our district the dead were sometimes placed in hollow trees. I know of skeletons
  in trees on the edge of the ridge on which the home station was built. These
  are said to be for the most part the bodies of worthless women or babies.</p>
  <p>In the coastal districts there are platforms in trees on which dead bodies
  were laid. In some places corpses are tied up in a sitting posture. The tying,
  they say, is to keep them secure when spirits come about, or body-snatchers
  for poison bones.</p>
  <p>In some places the graves are covered with a sort of emu egg-shaped and
  sized lumps of copi; and also, when a widow&rsquo;s term of mourning was
  over, she would take the widow&rsquo;s cap&mdash;which was a sort of copi
  or gypsum covering put on wet to her head&mdash;and place it on the grave
  of her husband.</p>
  <p>On the Narran the widows plaster their heads with copi or bidyi, as they
  call it, but so thinly that it cakes off. They renew it, and keep their heads
  covered with it for the allotted term of mourning, then just let it gradually
  all wear off.</p>
  <p>Those widows&rsquo; caps, having the imprint of nets inside them, are very
  old; for hair nets have been out of fashion for very many years in camp-land,
  so such rank as antique curios.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t think the small girl who thought when she grew up she&rsquo;d
  choose to be a widow, would have thought so if she had been born black.</p>
  <p>When a black woman&rsquo;s husband dies she has to cover herself with mud,
  and sleep beside a smouldering smoke all night. Three days afterwards, black
  fellows go and make a fire by the creek. They chase the widow and her sisters,
  who might have been her husband&rsquo;s wives, down to the creek. The widow
  catches hold of the smoking bush, puts it under her arm, and jumps into the
  middle of the creek; as the smoking bush is going out she drinks some of
  the smoky water. Then out she comes, is smoked at the fire; she then calls
  to those in the camp, and looks towards her husband&rsquo;s grave and calls
  again; his spirit answers, and the blacks call to her that they have heard
  him.</p>
  <p>After that she is allowed to speak; she had been doomed to silence since
  his death, but for lamentations. She goes to the new camp, where another
  big smoke is made. She puts on her widow&rsquo;s cap, which, as it wears
  out, has to be renewed for many months; for some months, too, she keeps her
  face daubed with white.</p>
  <p>Every time a stranger comes to the camp the widow has to make a smoke and
  smoke the camp again. The nearest of kin to her husband has a right to claim
  her as wife when her mourning is over.</p>
  <p>Should a woman be left a widow two or three times there are sinister whisperings
  about her. She is spoken of as having a &lsquo;white heart&rsquo;; and no
  man can live long, they say, with a woman having a &lsquo;white heart.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The graves in some parts of Australia are marked by carved trees; only a
  few painted upright posts marked them on the Narran.</p>
  <p>A tabooed camp has always a marked tree&mdash;just a piece of bark cut off
  and some red markings made on the wood, which indicate that the place is
  gummarl.</p>
  <p>Any possessions of the dead not buried with them are burnt, except the sacred
  stones; they are left to the wirreenun nearest of kin to the dead person.</p>
  <p>Lately a case came under my notice of the taboo extended to the possessions
  of dead people.</p>
  <p>A black man having two horses died. Neither his widow nor her mother would
  use those horses, even when he had been dead over a year. They would walk
  ten or twelve miles for their rations and carry them back, rather than use
  those horses before the term of mourning was over.</p>
  <p>The widow was one of my particular friends, but she would not come to see
  me because her husband had been at the house shortly before he died. She
  camped nearly a mile away, and I went to see her there. After he had been
  dead about a year, she came to see me; but before she did so her mother walked
  all round the out-buildings, garden, yards, etc., with a bunch of smoking
  Budtha, crooning little spirit songs.</p>

  Something About Stars And Legends</b></h2>
  <p>Venus in the Summer evenings is a striking object in the western sky. Our
  Venus they call the Laughing Star, who is a man. He once said something very
  improper, and has been laughing at his joke ever since. As he scintillates
  you seem to see him grinning still at his Rabelais-like witticism, seeing
  which the {aborigines} say:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a rude old man, that Laughing Star.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The Milky Way is a warrambool, or water overflow; the stars are the fires,
  and the dusky haze the smoke from them, which spirits of the dead have lit
  on their journey across the sky. In their fires they are cooking the mussels
  they gather where they camp.</p>
  <p>There is one old man up there who was once a great rainmaker, and when you
  see that he has turned round as the position of the Milky Way is altered,
  you may expect rain; he never moves except to make it.</p>
  <p>A waving dark shadow that you will see along the same course is Kurreah,
  the crocodile.</p>
  <p>To get to the Warrambool, the Wurrawilberoo, two dark spots in Scorpio,
  have to be passed. They are devils who try to catch the spirits of the dead;
  sometimes even coming to earth, when they animate whirlwinds and strike terror
  into the blacks. The old men try to keep them from racing through the camp
  by throwing their spears and boomerangs at them.</p>
  <p>The Pleiades are seven sisters, as usual, the dimmed ones having been dulled
  because on earth Wurrunnah seized them and tried to melt the crystal off
  them at a fire; for, beautiful as they were with their long hair, they were
  ice-maidens. But he was unsuccessful beyond dulling their brightness, for
  the ice as it melted put out the fire. The two ice-maidens were miserable
  on earth with him, and eventually escaped by the aid of one of their &lsquo;multiplex
  totems,&rsquo; the pine-tree. Wurrunnah had told them to get him pine bark.
  Now the Meamei&mdash;Pleiades&mdash;belong to the Beewee totem, so does the
  pine-tree. They chopped the pine bark, and as they did so the tree telescoped
  itself to the sky where the five other Meamei were, whom they now joined,
  and with whom they have remained ever since. But they who were polluted by
  their enforced residence with the earth-man never shone again with the brightness
  of their sisters. This legend was told emphasising the beauty of chastity.</p>
  <p>Men had desired all the sisters when once they travelled on earth, but they
  kept themselves unspotted from the world, with the exception of the two Wurrunnah
  captured by stratagem.</p>
  <p>Orion&rsquo;s Sword and Belt are the Berai-Berai&mdash;the boys&mdash;who
  best of all loved the Meamei, for whom they used to hunt, bringing their
  offerings to them; but the ice-maidens were obdurate and cold, disdaining
  lovers, as might be expected from their parentage. Their father was a rocky
  mountain, their mother an icy mountain stream. But when they were translated
  to the sky the Berai-Berai were inconsolable. They would not hunt, they would
  not eat, they pined away and died. The spirits pitied them and placed them
  in the sky within sound of the singing of the Meamei, and there they are
  happy. By day they hunt, and at night light their corroboree fires, and dance
  to the singing in the distance. just to remind the earth-people of them,
  the Meamei drop down some ice in the winter, and they it is who make the
  winter thunderstorms.</p>
  <p>Castor and Pollux, in some tribes, are two hunters of long ago.</p>
  <p>Canopus is Womba, the Mad Star, the wonderful Weedah of long ago, who, on
  losing his loves, went mad, and was sent to the sky that they might not reach
  him; but they followed, and are travelling after him to this day, and after
  them the wizard Beereeun, their evil genius, who made the mirage on the plains
  in order to deceive them, that they and Weedah might be lured on by it and
  perish of thirst.</p>
  <p>When they escaped him Beereeun threw a barbed spear into the sky, and hooked
  one spear on to another until he made a ladder up which he climbed after
  them; and across the sky he is still pursuing them.</p>
  <p>The Clouds of Magellan are the Bralgah, or Native Companions, mother and
  daughter, whom the Wurrawilberoo chased in order to kill and eat the mother
  and keep the daughter, who was the great dancer of the tribes. They almost
  caught her, but her tribe pursued them too quickly; when, determined that
  if they lost her so should her people, they chanted an incantation and changed
  her from Bralgah, the dancing-girl, to Bralgah, the dancing-bird, then left
  her to wander about the plains. They translated themselves on beefwood trees
  into the sky, and there they are still.</p>
  <p>Gowargay, the featherless emu, is a debbil-debbil of water-holes; he drags
  people who bathe in his holes down and drowns them, but goes every night
  to his sky-camp, the Coalpit, a dark place by the Southern Cross, and there
  he crouches. Our Corvus, the crow, is the kangaroo.</p>
  <p>The Southern Crown is Mullyan, the eagle-hawk. The Southern Cross was the
  first Minggah, or spirit tree a huge Yaraan, which was the medium for the
  translation of the first man who died on earth to the sky. The white cockatoos
  which used to roost in this tree when they saw it moving skywards followed
  it, and are following it still as Mouyi, the pointers. The other Yaraan trees
  wailed for the sadness that death brought into the world, weeping tears of
  blood. The red gum which crystallises down their trunks is the tears.</p>
  <p>Some tribes say it was by a woman&rsquo;s fault that death came into the
  world.</p>
  <p>This legend avers that at first the tribes were meant to live for ever.
  The women were told never to go near a certain hollow tree. The bees made
  a nest in this tree; the women coveted the honey, but the men forbade them
  to go near it. But at last one woman determined to get that honey; chop went
  her tomahawk into that hollow trunk, and out flew a huge bat. This was the
  spirit of death which was now let free to roam the world, claiming all it
  could touch with its wings.</p>
  <p>Of eclipses there are various accounts. Some say it is Yhi, the sun, the
  wanton woman, who has overtaken at last her enemy the moon, who scorned her
  love, and whom now she tries to kill, but the spirits intervene, dreading
  a return to a dark world. Some say the enemies have managed to get evil spirits
  into each other which are destroying them. The wirreenuns chant incantations
  to oust these spirits of evil, and when the eclipse is over claim a triumph
  of their magic.</p>
  <p>Another account says that Yhi, the sun, after many lovers, tried to ensnare
  Bahloo, the moon; but he would have none of her, and so she chases him across
  the sky, telling the spirits who stand round the sky holding it up, that
  if they let him escape past them to earth, she will throw down the spirit
  who sits in the sky holding the ends of the Kurrajong ropes which they guard
  at the other end, and if that spirit falls the earth will be hurled down
  into everlasting darkness.</p>
  <p>So poor Bahloo, when he wants to get to earth and go on with the creation
  of baby girls, has to sneak down as an emu past the spirits, hurrying off
  as soon as the sun sinks down too.</p>
  <p>Bahloo is a very important personage in legends.</p>
  <p>When the blacks see a halo round the moon they say,</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hullo! Going to be rain. Bahloo building a house to keep himself
  dry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>All sorts of scraps of folk-lore used to crop out from the little girls
  I took from the camp into the house to domesticate. When storms were threatening,
  some of the clouds have a netted sort of look, something like a mackerel
  sky, only with a dusky green tinge, they would say: &lsquo;See the old man
  with the net on his back; he&rsquo;s going to drop some hailstones.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Meteors always mean death; should a trail follow them, the dead person has
  left a large family.</p>
  <p>Comets are a spirit of evil supposed to drink up the rain-clouds, so causing
  a drought; their tails being huge families all thirsty, so thirsty that they
  draw the river up into the clouds.</p>
  <p>Every natural feature in any way pronounced has a mythical reason for its
  existence, every peculiarity in bird life, every peculiarity in the trees
  and stones. Besides there are many mythical bogies still at large, according
  to native lore, making the bush a gnome-land.</p>
  <p>Even the winds carry a legend in their breath.</p>
  <p>You hear people say they could have &lsquo;burst with rage,&rsquo; but it
  is left to a black&rsquo;s legend to tell of a whole tribe bursting with
  rage, and so originating the winds.</p>
  <p>There was once an invisible tribe called Mayrah. These people, men and women,
  though they talked and hunted with them, could never be seen by the other
  tribes, to whom were only visible their accoutrements for hunting. They would
  hear a woman&rsquo;s voice speak to them, see perhaps a goolay in mid-air
  and hear from it an invisible baby&rsquo;s cry; they would know then a Mayrah
  woman was there. Or a man would speak to them. Looking up they would see
  a belt with weapons in it, a forehead band too, perhaps, but no waist nor
  forehead, a water-vessel invisibly held: a man was there, an invisible Mayrah.
  One of these Mayrah men chummed with one of the Doolungaiyah tribe; he was
  a splendid mate, a great hunter, and all that was desirable, but for his
  invisibility. The Doolungaiyah longed to see him, and began to worry him
  on the subject until at last the Mayrah became enraged, went to his tribe,
  and told them of the curiosity of the other tribes as to their bodily forms.
  The others became as furious as he was; they all burst with rage and rushed
  away roaring in six different directions, and ever since have only returned
  as formless wind to be heard but never seen. So savagely the Mayrah howled
  round the Doolungaiyah&rsquo;s camp that he burrowed into the sand to escape,
  and his tribe have burrowed ever since.</p>
  <p>Three of the winds are masculine and three feminine. The Crow, according
  to legend, controls Gheeger Gheeger, and keeps her in a hollow log. The Eagle-hawk
  owns Gooroongoodilbaydilbay, and flies with her in the shape of high clouds.
  Yarragerh is a man, and he has for wives the Budtha, Bibbil, and Bumble trees,
  and when he breathes on them they burst into new shoots, buds, flowers, and
  fruits, telling the world that their lover Yarragerh, the spring, has come.</p>
  <p>Douran Doura woos the Coolabah, and Kurrajong, who flower after the hot
  north wind has kissed them.</p>
  <p>The women winds have no power to make trees fruitful. They can but moan
  through them, or tear them in rage for the lovers they have stolen, whom
  they can only meet twice a year at the great corroboree of the winds, when
  they all come together, heard but never seen; for Mayrah, the winds, are
  invisible, as were the Mayrah, the tribe who in bursting gave them birth.</p>
  <p>Yarragerh and Douran Doura are the most honoured winds as being the surest
  rain-bringers. In some of the blacks&rsquo; songs Mayrah is sung of as the
  mother of Yarragerh, the spring, or as a woman kissed into life by Yarragerh
  putting such warmth into her that she blows the winter away. But these are
  poetical licences, for Yarragerh is ordinarily a man who woos the trees as
  a spring wind until the flowers are born and the fruit formed, then back
  he goes to the heaven whence he came.</p>
  <p>Then there are the historical landmarks: Byamee&rsquo;s tracks in stone,
  and so on, and the battle-fields, too, of old tribal fights. just in front
  of our station store was a gnarled old Coolabah tree covered with warty excrescences,
  which are supposed to be seats for spirits, so showing a spirit haunt.</p>
  <p>In this particular tree are the spirits of the Moungun, or armless women,
  and when the wind blows you could hear them wailing. Their cruel husband
  chopped their arms off because they could not get him the honey he wanted,
  and their spirits have wailed ever since.</p>
  <p>Across the creek is another very old tree, having one hollow part in which
  is said to be secreted a shell which old Wurrunnah, the traveller of the
  tribes, and the first to see the sea, brought back. No one would dare to
  touch the shell. The tribe of a neighbouring creek, when we were first at
  the station, used to threaten to come and get it, but the men of the local
  tribe used to muster to protect it from desecration even at the expense of
  their lives.</p>
  <p>The Minggah by the garden I have told you of before. Further down the creek
  are others.</p>
  <p>At Weetalibah was the tree from which Byamee cut the first Gayandi. This
  tree was burnt by travellers a few years ago. The blacks were furious: the
  sacred tree of Byamee burnt by the white devils! There are trees, too, considered
  sacred, from which Byamee cut honey and marked them for his own, just as
  a man even now, on finding a bee&rsquo;s nest and not being able to stay
  and get it, marks a tree, which for any one else to touch is theft.</p>
  <p>A little way from the head station was an outcrop of white stones. These
  are said to be fossilised bones of Boogoodoogahdah&rsquo;s victims. She was
  a cannibal woman who had hundreds of dogs; with them she used to round up
  blacks and kill them, and she and her dogs ate them. At last she was outwitted
  and killed herself, and her spirit flew out as a bird from her heart. This
  bird haunts burial grounds, and if in a drought any one can run it down and
  make it cry out, rain will fall.</p>
  <p>During a drought one of these birds came into my garden, hearing which the
  blacks said rain would come soon, and it did. In another drought when the
  rainmakers had failed, some of the old blacks saw a rain-bird and hunted
  it, but could not get it to call out.</p>
  <p>Geologists say there should be diamonds along some of the old water-courses
  of the Moorilla ridges. Perhaps the white stone that the blacks talk about,
  which shows a light at night, and has, they say, a devil in it, is a diamond.
  Ruskin rather thought there was a devil in diamonds, making women do all
  sorts of evil to possess them. The blacks told me that a Queensland tribe
  had a marvellous stone which at great gatherings they show. Taking those
  who are privileged to see it into the dark, there they suddenly produce it,
  and it glows like a star, though when looked closely at in daylight seems
  only like a large drop of rain solidified. This stone, they said, has to
  be well guarded, as it has the power of self-movement, or rather, the devil
  in it can move it.</p>
  <p>The greatest of local landmarks is at Brewarrina; this is the work of Byamee
  and his giant sons, the stone fisheries made in the bed of the Barwon.</p>
  <p>At Boogira, on the Narran Lake, is an imprint in stone of Byamee&rsquo;s
  hand and foot, which shows that in those days were giants. There it was that
  Byamee brought to bay the crocodiles who had swallowed his wives, from which
  he recovered them and restored them to life.</p>
  <p>At Mildool is a scooped-out rock which Byamee made to catch and hold water;
  beside it he hollowed out a smaller stone, that his dog might have a drinking-place
  too. This recurrence of the mention of dogs in the legends touching Byamee
  looks as if blacks at all events believed dogs to have been in Australia
  as long as men.</p>
  <p>At Dooyanweenia are two rocks where Byamee and Birrahgnooloo rested, and
  to these rocks are still sticking the hairs he pulled from his beard, after
  rubbing his face with gum to make them come out easily.</p>
  <p>At Guddee, a spring in the Brewarrina district, every now and then come
  up huge bones of animals now extinct. Legends say that these bones are the
  remains of the victims of Mullyan, the eagle-hawk, whose camp was in the
  tree at the foot of which was the spring. This tree was a tree of trees;
  first, a widely spreading gum, then another kind, next a pine, and lastly
  a midgee, in which was Mullyan&rsquo;s camp, out of which the relations of
  his victims burnt him and his wives, and they now form the Northern Crown
  constellation. The roots of this gigantic tree travelled for miles, forming
  underground water-courses. At Eurahbah and elsewhere are hollowed-out caves
  like stones; in these places Birrahgnooloo slept, and near them, before the
  stock trampled them out, were always to be found springs made at her instigation
  for her refreshment; she is the patroness of water.</p>
  <p>At Toulby and elsewhere are mud springs. It is said that long ago there
  were no springs there, nor in the Warrego district, and in the droughts the
  water-courses all dried up and the blacks perished in hundreds. Time, after
  time this happened, until at last it seemed as if the tribes would be exterminated.
  The Yanta&mdash;spirits&mdash;saw what was happening and felt grieved, so
  they determined to come and live on the earth again to try and bring relief
  to the drought-stricken people. Down they came and set to work to excavate
  springs. They scooped out earth and dug, deeper and deeper, until at length
  after many of them gave in from exhaustion, those that were left were rewarded
  by seeing springs bubble up.</p>
  <p>The first of those that they made was at Yantabulla, which bears their name
  to this day.</p>
  <p>The blacks were delighted at having watering-places which neither a drought
  nor the fiercest sun could dry up. The Yantas were not contented with this
  nor with the other springs they made. They determined to excavate a whole
  plain, and turn it into a lake so deep that the sun could never dry it, and
  which would be full of fish for the tribes.</p>
  <p>They went to Kinggle and there began their work. On they toiled unceasingly,
  but work as they would they could not complete their scheme, for one after
  another wearied and died, until at last nothing was left on the plain but
  the mud springs under the surface and the graves of the Yantas on top. No
  blacks will cross Kinggle plains lest some of these spirits arise through
  the openings of their graves.</p>
  <p>This legend shows what a disheartening country the West is in a drought.
  When even the spirits gave in, how can ordinary men succeed? But indeed it
  is not ordinary men who do, but our &lsquo;Western heroes,&rsquo; as Will
  Ogilvie calls them, who wear their cross of bronze on neck and cheek in the
  country where &lsquo;the green fades into grey.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  The Trapping Of Game</b></h2>
  <p>Some of the blacks&rsquo; methods of catching game I have seen practised,
  some have long since died out of use.</p>
  <p>Of course the sportsmen knew the favourite watering-holes of the game. At
  such a place they made a rough break at each side, leaving an opening where
  the track was. Along this track they would lay a net with one end on the
  edge of the water; in the water they put sticks on the ends of which the
  birds rest to drink, the other ends are out in the trap. They would make
  a hole low down on each side of the net, and a man would hide in each.</p>
  <p>A bird&rsquo;s watering-place, where the blacks trap them, is called Dheelgoolee.
  When the Dheelgoolee trapping begins, on the first day those who go out hunting
  must bring home their game alive to give the man at the Dheelgoolee luck.
  Then they never try to catch an emu or kangaroo, only iguana, opossum, piggiebillah,
  paddy melon, or bandicoot, all of which could be brought home alive. But
  after the first day they can kill as they go along.</p>
  <p>All day some birds come to the Dheelgoolee-pigeons, gilahs, young crows,
  and others, and the man watching catches them. When the game was thick on
  the net, the men in the holes would catch hold of the ends of the sticks
  in the net and quickly turn them over the lower ends, thus entrapping all
  on the net. In the evening turkeys and such things as water at night-time,
  amongst which are opossums and paddy melons, would be trapped.</p>
  <p>Ducks were trapped, too, by making bough breaks across the shallow part
  of the creek, with a net across the deep part from break to break. A couple
  of the men would go up stream to hunt the ducks down, and some would stay
  each side of the net armed with pieces of bark. The two hunters up stream
  frightened the ducks off the water, and sent them flying down stream to the
  trap. Should they seem flying too high as if to pass, the blacks would throw
  the pieces of bark high in the air, imitating, as they did so, the cry of
  hawks. Down the ducks would fly turning back; some of the men would whistle
  like ducks, others would throw bark again, giving the hawk&rsquo;s cry, which
  would frighten the birds, making them double back into the net, where they
  were quickly despatched by those waiting.</p>
  <p>Murrahgul is another trap. This is a yard made all round a waterhole with
  one opening; about this opening they will fasten, from stumps or logs, strong
  strings with a slipping knot. The game, emu or kangaroo, would probably step
  into one of these string nooses, would try to pull its leg out; the harder
  it pulled the tighter the knot. Or the blacks might have put a sort of cross-bar
  overhead at the entrance, with hanging strings having a slip knot; in would
  go an emu&rsquo;s head, the bird would rush on and be strangled.</p>
  <p>Boobeen is a primitive cornet, a hollowed piece of Bibbil wood, one end
  partially filled up with pine gum, and ornamented outside with carvings.
  To blow through it is an art, and the result rather like a big horn. The
  noise is said to be very like an emu&rsquo;s cry, and this emu bugle will
  certainly, they say, draw towards it a gundooee, or solitary emu.</p>
  <p>The blacks used on the sandhills to make a deep hole to hide themselves
  in, usually only one though. From this hole they would run out a drain for
  about thirty yards. The man with the Boobeen would have a little break of
  bushes round him; scattered over the leaves he&rsquo;d have emu feathers,
  and then he would have a strong string, on the end of which he would have
  a small branch with this he would place about midway emu feathers on it;
  down the drain.</p>
  <p>When the emu answers the Boobeen&rsquo;s call, the bugler gets lower and
  slower with his call. The emu sees the feathered thing in the drain, comes
  inquisitively up and sniffs at it. The man in the hole pulls in the string
  slowly; the emu follows, on, on, until heedlessly he steps on a Murrahgul,
  or string trap, and is caught. The hunters would sometimes stalk kangaroo,
  holding in front of them boughs of trees or bushy young saplings, closing
  silently in and in, until at last the kangaroo were so closely surrounded
  by men armed with boondees and spears that there was no escape for them.</p>
  <p>For catching emu they had a net made of string as thick as a clothes-line.
  These nets were made either of Kurrajong (Noongah) bark, or of Burraungah
  grass. The Kurrajong bark is stripped off the trees, beaten, chewed, and
  then teased. Then it was taken and rubbed, principally by the women on their
  legs, into strands.</p>
  <p>The grass was used preferably to Kurrajong bark, as it was easier to work.
  The process of preparation was as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p>A hole was dug in the ground, some fire put in it, a quantity of ordinary
  grass was put on the top of the coals, and on top of that a heap of Burraungah
  grass, that topped with ordinary grass.</p>
  <p>Water was sprinkled over it all and the hole earthed up.</p>
  <p>When it had been in long enough the earth was cleared away, and the grass,
  which was quite soft, taken out. It was then chewed and worked like the Kurrajong
  bark, than which it was much more pliable.</p>
  <p>String was made of various thicknesses according to what it was required
  for.</p>
  <p>Fishing nets were always smoked before being used, and all nets had little
  charm songs sung over them. In netting, their only implement was a piece
  of wood to wind their string on. An emu net was about five feet high, and
  between two and three hundred yards long.</p>
  <p>When any one discovered a setting emu, they used not to disturb her at once
  and get her eggs, but returned to the camp, singing as they neared it a song
  known as the Noorunglely, or setting emu song; those in camp would recognise
  it, and sing back the reply. The black fellows having learnt where the nest
  was, would get their net and go out to camp near it. All that evening they
  would have an emu-hunting corroboree. The next morning at daylight they would
  erect their net into a sort of triangular-shaped yard, one side open. Black
  fellows would be stationed at each end of the net, and at stated intervals
  along the mirroon, as the net was called. When the others were all ready
  some of the blacks would make a wide circle round the emu, leaving open the
  side towards the net; they would close in gradually until they frightened
  the emu off her nest; she would run in the direction where she saw no black
  fellows and where the net was; the black fellows closing in behind, followed
  quickly. Poor Noorunglely floundered into the net, up rushed a black fellow
  and, seizing her, wrung her neck. Having secured her, they would next secure
  her eggs; that they might be a trifle stale was a matter of indifference
  to them.</p>
  <p>Another old method was by making sort of brush yards and catching the emus
  in these.</p>
  <p>One modern way is to run them down with kangaroo dogs, the same way with
  kangaroo; but at one time still another method obtained. A black fellow would
  get a long spear and fasten on the end a bunch of emu feathers. When he sighted
  an emu he would climb a tree, break some boughs to place beneath him, if
  the trees were thinly foliaged, to hide him from the emu, then he would let
  his spear dangle down. The emu, a most inquisitive bird, seeing the emu feathers,
  would investigate. Directly the bird was underneath the tree, the black fellow
  would grip his spear tightly and throw it at the emu, rarely, if ever, failing
  to hit it, though the emu might run wounded for a short distance, but the
  black fellow would be quickly after it to give it happy despatch.</p>
  <p>If the emu got a good start even, it was easily tracked by the trail of
  blood. It has happened that a black fellow has not found his emu until the
  next day, when it was dead and the spear still in it; but usually very soon
  after the wounded birds start running the spear is shaken out.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the blacks killed birds with their boomerangs, ducks in particular.
  I fancy this killing of ducks by a well-thrown boomerang is one of the feats
  that black fellows allow themselves to blow about. Every man has usually
  one subject, a speciality he considers of his own, and on that subject he
  waxes eloquent.</p>
  <p>Pigeons, gilahs, and plains turkeys are also killed with boomerangs. Blacks&rsquo; fishing-nets
  are about ten feet by five, a stick run through each end, for choice of Eurah
  wood. Eurah is a pretty drooping shrub with bell-shaped spotted flowers,
  having a horrible smell. The wood is very pliable. It is sometimes used instead
  of the sacred Dheal at funerals.</p>
  <p>Two of the fishermen take the net into the creek, one at each end; they
  stand in a rather shallow place, holding the net upright in the water. Some
  other blacks go up stream and splash about, frightening the fish down towards
  the net. When those holding the net feel the fish in it, they fold the two
  sticks together and bring the net out.</p>
  <p>To catch fish they also make small weirs and dams of stones, with narrow
  passages of stones leading to them. The fish are swept by the current into
  these yards, and there either caught by the blacks with their hands, or speared.
  The most celebrated of these stone fish-traps is at Brewarrina on the Barwon.
  It is said to have been made by Byamee, the god and culture-hero of these
  people, and his giant sons. He it was who established the rule that there
  should be a camping-ground in common for the various tribes where, during
  the fishing festival, peace should be strictly kept, all meeting to enjoy
  the fish, to do their share towards preserving the fisheries.</p>
  <p>Each tribe has its particular yards; for another to take fish from these
  is theft. Each tribe keeps its yards in repair, replacing stones removed
  by floods, and so on.</p>
  <p>These stony fish mazes are fully two hundred yards in length, substantially
  built; some huge boulders are amongst the stones which form these most intricate
  labyrinthine fish yards, which as traps are eminently successful, many thousands
  of Murray cod and other fish being caught in them.</p>
  <p>Dingo pups, in the days when dingoes were plentiful, were a most esteemed
  delicacy. To eat dog is dangerous for a woman, as causing increased birth-pangs;
  that suggests dog must be rather good eating, some epicure wirreenun scaring
  women off it by making that assertion.</p>
  <p>Ant larvae, a special gift from some spirit in the stars, and frogs,
  are also thought good by camp epicures.</p>
  <p>The blacks smear themselves over with the fat of fish or of almost any game
  they catch. It is supposed to keep their limbs supple, and give the admired
  ebony gloss to their skins which, by the way, are very fine grained. After
  a flood, when the water is running out of the tributaries of the creek, the
  blacks make a bough break beginning on each bank and almost meeting in the
  middle; across the gap they place a fishing-net which folds in like a bag,
  thus forming a fish-trap in which are caught any number of fish. Crayfish
  and mussels they caught by digging down their holes in the mud for them.
  Their mode of catching shrimps was very (with all apologies to scientists
  for using the word) primitive. Quite nude, the women sit down in the water,
  let the shrimps bite them; as they nip, seize them.</p>
  <p>Iguanas burrow into the soft sand ridges and there remain during the winter,
  only coming out after the Curreequinquins&mdash;butcher birds&mdash;one of
  their sub-totems, sing their loudest to warn them that the winter is gone,
  calling Dooloomai, the thunder, to their aid lest their singing is not heard
  by their relations, who after the storms come out again in as good condition
  as when they disappeared.</p>
  <p>Black men do not approve of women cooks. At least the old men, under the
  iron rule of ancient custom, will not eat bread made by gins, nor would they
  eat iguana, fish, piggiebillah, or anything like that if the inside were
  removed by a woman, though after themselves having prepared such things,
  they allow the gins to cook them&mdash;that is, if they have not young children
  or are enceinte; under those conditions they are unclean.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  Foraging And Cooking</b></h2>
  <p>It is very strange to me to hear the average white person speak of the blacks
  collectively as having no individuality, for really they are as diverse in
  characteristics as possible; no two girls I had in the house but were totally
  different.</p>
  <p>There has been too much generalisation about the blacks. For instance, you
  hear some people assert all blacks are trackers and good bushmen. That there
  are some whose tracking power is marvellous is true, but they are not the
  rule, and a black fellow off his own beat is often useless as a bushman.</p>
  <p>So with their eyesight; what they have been trained to look out for they
  see in a marvellously quick way, or so it seems to us who have not in their
  lines the same aptitude. Of course, for seeing things at a distance a black
  has the advantage, unless the white has had the same open-air life. Some
  white bushmen are as good as any blacks.</p>
  <p>Nimmaylee, a little black girl who lived in the house, used to tell me all
  sorts of bush wonders, as we went in the early summer mornings for a swim
  in the river. She was a great water-baby, with rather a contempt for my aquatic
  limitations. Then she thought it too idiotic to want to dry yourself with
  a towel,&mdash;just like a mad white woman!</p>
  <p>White people were an immense joke to Nimmaylee. She conformed to their rules
  as one playing a new game. She has a little brother as black as herself.
  She has a substantial pair of legs, but his are so thin and his little body
  so round that he looks like a little black spider.</p>
  <p>Nimmaylee is quite an authority on corroborees, knowing ever so many different
  steps, from the serpentile trail of the codfish to the mimic fight. The songs
  she knows too. She used, when she lived in the camp, to marshal in a little
  crowd of camp children, and put them through a varied performance for my
  benefit.</p>
  <p>These performances were of daily occurrence when the fruit was ripe, for
  Nimmaylee&rsquo;s capacity for water-melon was practically unlimited.</p>
  <p>Nimmaylee was a wonderful little fisherwoman; she delighted in a fishing
  expedition with me. Off we used to go with our lines, worms or frogs for
  bait, or perhaps shrimps or mussels if we were after cod. If we were successful,
  Nimmaylee would string the fish on a stick in a most professional manner,
  and carry them with an air of pride to the cook. She attributes her fishing
  successes to a charm having been sung over her to that end as a baby.</p>
  <p>Accompanied by some reliable old &lsquo;gins&rsquo; and ever so many piccaninnies,
  I used to take long walks through the &lsquo;bush.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>How interesting those blacks made my bush walks for me! Every ridge, plain,
  and bend had its name and probably legend; each bird a past, every excrescence
  of nature a reason for its being.</p>
  <p>Those walks certainly at least modified my conceit. I was always the dunce
  of the party&mdash;the smallest child knew more of woodcraft than I did,
  and had something to tell of everything. Seeing Oogahnahbayah, a small eagle-hawk,
  flying over, they would say, &lsquo;He eats the emu eggs.&rsquo; He flies
  over where the emu is sitting on her eggs and makes a noise hoping to frighten
  the bird off; having done so, he will drop a stone on the eggs. If the emu
  is not startled off the nest, the hawk will fly on, alight at some distance,
  and walk up like a black fellow, still with the stone in his beak, to the
  nest; off the emu will go, then the hawk bangs the eggs with the stone until
  he breaks them. He throws the stone on one side, has a feed of emu eggs,
  and goes off, leaving poor Moorunglely, the sitting emu, to come back and
  find her eggs all destroyed. As the narrative ended, the little {aborigines}
  would look quite sad, and say &lsquo;Nurragah!&rsquo; &lsquo;Poor thing!&rsquo; at
  the thought of the domestic tragedy in bird life.</p>
  <p>I had to hear the stingless little native bees humming before I could see
  them; and as to knowing which tree had honey in it, unless I saw the bees,
  that was quite beyond me, while a mere toddler would point triumphantly to
  a &lsquo;sugar-bag&rsquo; tree, recognising it as such by the wax on its
  fork, black before rain, yellowish afterwards.</p>
  <p>This honey is good strained, but as the blacks get it, it is all mixed up
  with dirty wax and dead bees.</p>
  <p>I deplored the sacrifice of the bees one day, but was told it was all right.
  Whoever had chopped the nest out would take home the waxy stick they had
  used to help get the honey out; they would throw the stick in the fire, then
  all the dead bees would go to a paradise in the skies, whence next season
  they would send Yarragerh Mayrah, the Spring Wind, to blow the flowers open,
  and then down they would come to earth again. One year the manna just streamed
  down the Coolabah and Bibbil trees; it ran down like liquid honey, crystallising
  where it dropped.</p>
  <p>The old blacks said, &lsquo;It is a drought now, but it will be worse. Byamee
  has sent the manna by the little Dulloorah birds and the black ants, because
  there will be no flowers for the bees to get honey from, so he has sent this
  manna.&rsquo; Each time he has done so, a great drought has followed, and
  indeed it was followed by one of the worst droughts Australia has ever known.
  Byamee, it is said, first sent them the manna because their children were
  crying for honey, of which there was none except in the trees that Byamee,
  when on earth, had marked for his own. The women had murmured that they were
  not allowed to get this; but the men were firm, and would neither touch it
  nor let them touch it, which so pleased Byamee that he sent the manna, and
  said he always would when a long drought threatened.</p>
  <p>A great chorus of &lsquo;My Jerhs&rsquo; would tell something was sighted.</p>
  <p>It might be the track of a piggiebillah porcupine. This track was followed
  to a hollow log; then came the difficulty, how to get it out, for porcupines
  cling tightly with their sharp claws, and all a dog can do where a piggiebillah
  is concerned is to bark, their spines are too much to tackle at close quarters.
  But the old gins are equal to the occasion: a tomahawk to chop the log, and
  a yam-stick to dislodge the porcupine, who takes a good deal of killing before
  he is vanquished.</p>
  <p>They say a fully initiated man can sing a charm which will make a piggiebillah
  relax his grip and be taken captive without any trouble. The piggiebillahs
  burrow into the sand and leave their young there as soon as the faintest
  feel of a spine appears. The baby piggiebillahs look like little indiarubber
  toys.</p>
  <p>The opossums all disappeared from our district. When we were first there
  they were very numerous and used to make raids at night to my rose-bushes&mdash;great
  havoc the result. It is said a very great wirreenun&mdash;wizard&mdash;willed
  them away so that his enemy, whose yunbeai, or personal totem, the opossum
  was, should die. This design was frustrated by counter magic; two powerful
  wizards appeared and, acting in concert, put a new yunbeai into the dying
  man; he recovered.</p>
  <p>When the opossums were about the blacks used to see their scratched tracks
  on the trees, and chop or burn them out. They miss the opossums very much,
  for not only were they a prized food, but their skins made rugs, their hair
  was woven into cords of which were made amulets worn on the forearm or head
  against sickness, and with no modern instrument can they so well carve their
  weapons, as with an opossum tooth. Naturally their desire is to see Moodai,
  the opossum, return; to that end a wirreenun is now singing incantations
  to charm him back.</p>
  <p>Opossum hunters had a way of bringing them home strung round their necks;
  very disagreeable, I should think, but custom, that tyrant, rules it so.
  The old gins dug out yams vigorously; some were eaten raw, others were kept
  for cooking.</p>
  <p>To cook them they dug out a hole, made a fire in it, put some stones on
  the fire, then, when the stones were heated and the fire burnt down, they
  laid some leaves and grass on the stones, sprinkled some water, then put
  on the yams, on top of them more grass, sprinkled more water, then more grass
  and a thick coating of earth, leaving the yams to cook.</p>
  <p>Several other roots they cooked and ate. Raw they ate thistle tops, pigweed,
  and crowfoot, with great relish. Their game they cooked as follows. Kangaroo
  were first singed, cleaned out, and filled with hot stones, then put on the
  top of a burnt-down fire, hot ashes heaped all over them. The blacks like
  their meats with the gravy in, very distinctly red gravy. Emu were plucked,
  the insides taken out, and the birds filled up with hot stones, box leaves,
  and some of their own feathers. A fire was made in a hole; when it was burnt
  down, leaves and emu feathers were put in it, on top of these the bird, on
  top of it leaves and feathers again, then a good layer of hot ashes, and
  over all some earth.</p>
  <p>The piggiebillahs were first smoked so that their quills might be easily
  knocked off. This done, the insides were taken out, then the piggiebillahs
  were put in little holes made beside the fire, and covered over with hot
  ashes, as were also opossums, ducks and other birds, iguanas and fish.</p>
  <p>Ducks were plucked by our tribe, but in some places they were encased thickly
  in mud, buried in the ashes to cook, and, when done, the plaster of mud would
  be knocked off, and with it would come all the feathers.</p>
  <p>The insides of iguanas and fish are taken out all in one piece. Each fish
  carries in its inside a representation of its Minggah&mdash;spirit tree;
  by drying the inside and pressing it you can plainly see the imprint of the
  tree.</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="page116"></a><img src="e00022-images/page116.jpg" alt="image" width="850" height="409"></p>
  <p>When we go bathing, the blacks tell me that the holes in the creek filled
  with gum leaves are codfish nests. They say too, that when they beat the
  river to drive the fish out towards the net waiting for them, that they hear
  the startled cod sing out.</p>
  <p>Mussels and crayfish are cooked in the ashes.</p>
  <p>The seagulls, which occasionally we used to see inland, are said to have
  brought the first mussels to the back creeks.</p>
  <p>Emu eggs the blacks roll in hot ashes, shake, roll again; shake once more,
  and then bury them in the ashes, where they are left for about an hour until
  they are baked hard, when they are eaten with much relish and apparently
  no hurt to digestion, though one egg is by no means considered enough for
  a meal in spite of its being equal to several eggs of our domestic hen.</p>
  <p>Not only are the blacks very particular in the way their game is carved
  or divided, but also in the distribution of the portions allotted to each
  person. The right to a particular part is an inherited one. No polite offering
  of a choice to an honoured guest, no suggestion of the leg or wing. You may
  loathe the leg of a bird as food, but at a black fellow&rsquo;s feast, if
  convention ordains that as your portion, have it you must; just as each rank
  in society had its invariable joint in early mediaeval Ireland.</p>
  <p>The seeds of Noongah&mdash;a sterculia&mdash;and Dheal, were ground on their
  flat dayoorl-stones and made into cakes, which they baked, first on pieces
  of bark beside the fire to harden them, then in the ashes. These dayoorl,
  or grinding-stones, are handed down from generation to generation, being
  kept each in the family to whom it had first belonged. Should a member of
  any other use it without permission, a fight would ensue. Some of these stones
  are said to have spirits in them; those are self-moving, and at times have
  the power of speech. I have neither seen them move nor heard them speak,
  though I have a couple in my possession. I suppose the statement must be
  taken on faith; and as faith can move mountains, why not a dayoorl-stone?</p>
  <p>The so-called improvident blacks actually used to have a harvest time, and
  a harvest home too. When the doonburr, or seed, was thick on the yarmmara,
  or barley-grass, the tribes gathered this grass in quantities.</p>
  <p>First, they made a little space clear of everything, round which they made
  a brush-yard. Each fresh supply of yarmmara, as it was brought in by the
  harvesters, was put in this yard. When enough was gathered, the brush-yard
  was thrown on one side, and fire set to the grass, which was in full ear
  though yet green. While the fire was burning, the blacks kept turning the
  grass with sticks all the time to knock the seeds out. When this was done,
  and the fire burnt out, they gathered up the seed into a big opossum-skin
  rug, and carried it to the camp.</p>
  <p>There, the next day, they made a round hole like a bucket, and a square
  hole close to it. These they filled with grass seed. One man trampled on
  the seed in the square hole to thresh it out with his feet; another man had
  a boonal, or stick, about a yard long, rounded at one end, and nearly a foot
  broad; with this he worked the grass in the round hole, and as he worked
  the husks flew away.</p>
  <p>It took all one day to do this. The next day they took the large bark wirrees,
  canoe-shaped vessels, which when big like these are called yubbil. They put
  some grain in these, and shook it up; one end of the yubbils being held much
  higher than the other, thus all the dust and dirt sifted to one end, whence
  it was blown off. When the grain was sufficiently clean, it was put away
  in skin bags to be used as required, being then ground on the large flat
  dayoorl-stones, with a smaller flat stone held in both hands by the one grinding;
  this stone was rubbed up and down the dayoorl, grinding the seed on it, on
  which, from time to time, water was thrown to soften it.</p>
  <p>When ground, the grain was made into little flat cakes, and cooked as the
  tree-seed cakes were. When the harvesting of the yarmmara was done, a great
  hunt took place, a big feast was prepared, and a big corroboree held night
  after night for some time.</p>
  <p>The two principal drinks were gullendoorie&mdash;that is, water sweetened
  with honey; and another made of the collarene, or flowers of the Coolabah
  (grey-leaved box), or Bibbil (poplar-leaved box) flowers, soaked all night
  in binguies (canoe-shaped wooden vessels) of water. Just about Christmas
  time the collarene is at its best; and then, in the olden days, there were
  great feasts and corroborees held.</p>
  <p>The flat dayoorl-stones on which the seeds are ground with the smaller stone,
  are like the &lsquo;saddle-stone querns&rsquo; occasionally found in ancient
  British sites. These primitive appliances preceded the circular rotatory
  querns in evolution, and as the monuments prove were used in ancient Egypt.
  I cannot say whether, amongst the Euahlayi, there was a recognised licence
  as to exchange of wives on these festal occasions, or at boorahs. If the
  custom existed, I was not told of it by the blacks; but it is quite possible
  that, unless I made inquiries on the subject, I would not be told.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  Costumes And Weapons</b></h2>
  <p>I have seen a coloured king simply smirking with pride, in what he considered
  modern full dress&mdash;a short shirt and an old tall hat.</p>
  <p>And I suppose, as far as actual clothing went, it was an advance on the
  old-time costume of paint and feathers. A black woman&rsquo;s needle was
  a little bone from the leg of an emu, pointed. Her thread was sinews of opossums,
  kangaroos, and emus; that was all that was necessary for her plain sewing,
  which was plain indeed.</p>
  <p>Her fancy work consisted of netting dillee, goolays, or miniature hammocks
  to sling her baby across her back, or, failing a baby, her mixed possessions,
  from food to feathers; her larder and wardrobe in one.</p>
  <p>Her costume being simple in the extreme did not require much room. It consisted
  of a goomillah, which was a string wound round the waist, made of opossum
  sinews, and in front, hanging down for about a foot, were twisted strands
  of opossum hair. A bone, or on state occasions a green twig, stuck through
  the cartilage of her nose, a string net over her hair, or perhaps only a
  fillet, or a kangaroo&rsquo;s tooth fastened to her front lock, gum balls
  dried on side-locks, an opossum&rsquo;s hair armlet, and perhaps a reed bead
  necklet and a polished black skin, toilette complete, unless for certain
  ceremonies a further decoration of flowers or down feathers was required.</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="page120"></a><img src="e00022-images/page120.jpg" alt="image" width="882" height="750"></p>
  <p>The principal article of the man&rsquo;s dress was called waywah. It was
  a belt, about six inches wide, made of twisted sinews and hair, with four
  tufts about eighteen inches long hanging back and front and at each side
  from it, made of narrow strips of kangaroo or paddy melon skins.</p>
  <p>For warmth in winter they would wrap themselves in their opossum-skin rugs.
  Sometimes both sexes adorned themselves with strings of kangaroo teeth fixed
  into gum, in which a little hole was made, round their heads and necks&mdash;yumbean
  they called them; or forehead bands with hanging kangaroo teeth, which were
  called gnooloogail.</p>
  <p>Pine gum they rolled into small egg-shaped balls, warmed them and stuck
  them in dozens all over their heads, where they would be left until they
  wore off, hairdressings being only an occasional duty. The gum they used
  for sticking the kangaroo&rsquo;s teeth was that of the Mubboo, or beefwood
  tree.</p>
  <p>Sometimes wongins were worn; they consisted of cords round the neck and
  under the arms, crossing the chest with a shell pendant at the centre of
  the cross. A shell is still a most prized ornament.</p>
  <p>The corroboree dress is one of paint; the feature of it being its design,
  a man can gain quite a tribal reputation for being an originator of decorative
  designs.</p>
  <p>Their original paint colourings were white, red, and yellow; occasionally
  they said they got some sort of blue by barter, but very occasionally, as
  it came from very far. White was from Gidya ash, or gypsum; red and yellow,
  ochre clay; but they also got both red and yellow from burning at a certain
  stage certain trees, gooroolay for red; the charcoal, instead of being black,
  having red and yellow tinges. But since the white people came the blue bag
  has put yellow out of fashion, and raddle is used for the red.</p>
  <p>Their opossum rugs used to have designs scratched on the skin sides and
  also painted patterns, some say tribal marks, others just to look pretty
  and distinguish each their own.</p>
  <p>Feathers tied into little bunches and fastened on to small wooden skewers
  were stuck upright in the hair at corroborees, also swansdown fluffed in
  puff balls over the heads.</p>
  <p>The Gooumoorh, or corroboree, is a sort of black fellow&rsquo;s opera; as
  to the musical part, rather, as some one found an oratorio, a thing of high
  notes and vain repetition.</p>
  <p>The stage effects of corroborees are sometimes huge sheets of bark fastened
  on to poles; these sheets of bark are painted in different designs and colours,
  something like Moorish embroideries. Sometimes there is a huge imitation
  of an alligator made of logs plastered over with earth and painted in stripes
  of different colours, a piece of wood cut open stuck in at one end as a gaping
  mouth. This alligator corroboree is generally indicative of a Boorah, or
  initiation ceremony, being near at hand. Sometimes the stage effects are
  high painted poles merely.</p>
  <p>At the back of the goomboo, or stage, are large fires; in the front, in
  a semicircle, sit the women as orchestra, and the audience; a fire at each
  end of the semicircle, as a sort of footlights. The music of the orchestra
  is made by some beating time on rolled-up opossum rugs, and some clicking
  two boomerangs together. The time is faultless. The tunes are monotonous,
  but rhythmical and musical, curiously well suited to the stage and players.
  These last have a very weird look as they steal out of the thick scrub,
  out of the darkness, quickly one after another, dancing round the goomboo
  in time to the music, their grotesquely painted figures and feather-decorated
  heads lit up by the flickering lights of the fires around.</p>
  <p>As the dancing gets faster the singing gets louder, every muscle of the
  dancers seems strained, and the wonder is the voices do not crack. Just as
  you think they must, the dancing slows again; the voices die away, to swell
  out once more with renewed vigour when the fires are built up again and again;
  the same dance is gone through, time after time&mdash;one night one dance,
  or, for that matter, many nights one dance.</p>
  <p>The dancers sometimes make dumb-show of hunts, fights, slaughters, the women
  sometimes translating the actions in the songs; sometimes the words seem
  to have nothing to do with them, and the dances only a series of steps illustrating
  nothing.</p>
  <p>Corroborees seem to fit in with the indescribable mystery of the bush. That
  the spirit of the bush is mystery makes it so difficult to describe beyond
  bald realism, otherwise it seems an effort to seize the intangible. Poor
  Barcroft Boake got something of the mystery into words.</p>
  <p>If an Australian Wagner could be born we might hope for a musical adaptation
  of corroborees. Wagner was essentially the exponent of folk-lore music, wherein
  must be expressed the fundamentals of human passion unrefined.</p>
  <p>The most celebrated weapon is probably the boomerang the most celebrated
  kind to whites, though not most useful to blacks, is the Bubberab, or returning
  boomerang. These are made chiefly of Gidya and Myall. Here these &lsquo;Come
  backs&rsquo; are never carved, are more curved than the ordinary boomerang,
  and were greased, rubbed with charred grass, and warmed before being used,
  so that the slightest warp would be straightened. It is marvellous the accuracy
  with which an adept can throw one of these weapons, locating it on the exact
  place to which he wishes it to return.</p>
  <p>Gidya is the favourite wood for boomerangs. They are first roughly shaped,
  then thrown into water and soaked for two or three days; taken out and made
  into the proper shape, rubbed with charred grass, greased well, and carved
  in various designs with an opossum&rsquo;s tooth.</p>
  <p>Boomerangs have many uses&mdash;in peace two clicked together as a musical
  instrument, as a war weapon, and as a weapon in the chase. Its last and rapidly
  approaching use will be as a curio for collectors.</p>
  <p>Billah, or spears, are made of Belah (swamp oak) or Gidya. These too are
  cut roughly first and thrown into water, then cut a little more, thrown into
  water again, and so day after day until finished. Sometimes they are carved
  with a running featherstitch-like pattern from end to end, sometimes have
  bingles, or barbs, cut down one or both sides; some barbarous things with
  barbs pointing both ways, so that they could be neither pushed out nor drawn
  through a wound; some are plain, painted at each end or darkened with poison
  tips.</p>
  <p>Billah are war weapons; a larger kind called Moornin are used for spearing
  emu.</p>
  <p>Woggarahs, the hatchet-shaped weapons, were made of Myall, Gidya, and other
  woods, carved as were boomerangs, each carver usually having a favourite
  design by which his weapons were recognised.</p>
  <p>Booreens, or shields, were of three kinds: a narrow kind made of hardwood,
  a broad flat kind of Kurrajong, and a medium-sized one of Birah, or whitewood,
  all painted in coloured designs. It is wonderful the way a man can defend
  himself single-handed against a number of men, he having only a narrow shield,
  the only defence he is allowed when he has to stand his trial for a breach
  of the laws.</p>
  <p>Their tomahawks, or Cumbees, were of dark-green stone, of which there is
  none in this district, so it must have been obtained by barter, as in the
  first instance were the flat, light Booreens from the Queensland side, and
  the grass-tree gum from the Narrabri mountains side, for which Gidya boomerangs
  were given in exchange.</p>
  <p>The stone tomahawks have a handle put over one end of the stone, gummed
  on with beefwood gum, then drawn together under the stone, crossed, and the
  two ends tied together as a handle, with sinews of emus, opossums, or kangaroos.</p>
  <p>Muggils, or stone knives, are just sharpened pieces of stone.</p>
  <p>Moorooleh are plain waddies used in war and for killing game; a smaller
  kind called Boodthul are thrown for amusement.</p>
  <p>Boondees are heavy-headed clubs used in war.</p>
  <p>The black fellow won&rsquo;t allow his womenkind a heaven of rest, for the
  spirit women are supposed to make weapons which the wirreenuns journey towards
  the sunset clouds to get&mdash;the women&rsquo;s heaven is in the west&mdash;giving
  in exchange animal food and opossum rugs, no animals being there.</p>
  <p>For carrying water they used to make bags of opossum skins. To prepare the
  skins they would pluck the hair off, and, after cleansing them well, sew
  up the skins with sinews, leaving only the neck open. They would fill this
  vessel with air and hang it out to dry.</p>
  <p>As, a water vessel, to mix their drinks and medicines in, they used Binguies
  or Coolamons, a deep, canoe-shaped vessel cut out of solid wood, carved sometimes
  and painted, a string handle to it. They used little bark vessels to drink
  out of, like shallow basins, cut from excrescences on eucalyptus trees; these
  were called wirree. A larger bark vessel they used for holding water, honey,
  or anything liquid.</p>
  <p>While on the subject of personal decoration I forgot the Moobir, or cuts
  on the bodies, some of which are tribal marks, some marks of mourning, some
  merely of ornamentation. Both men and women are seen with these marks in
  the Narran district; some huge wales on the skin from the shoulders half-way
  down the back, some on the chest and the forepart of the arms. They are cut
  with a stone knife, licked along by the medicine man, filled in with charcoal,
  and the skin let grow over.</p>
  <p>Various reasons are given for these marks: some say they are to give strength,
  others as a tribal sign, others just to look pretty. Some give the final
  reason for everything, &lsquo;Because Byamee say so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>In summer the blacks are great bathers, and play all sorts of games in the
  water. Their soap is clay; they rub themselves with that, the women plastering
  it under their arms again and again; the little children rub themselves all
  over with it, then tumble into the water to wash it off.</p>
  <p>In winter they forgo bathing, and rub themselves with liberal applications
  of grease.</p>
  <p>The old blacks used to have very good teeth; they never ate without afterwards
  rinsing out their mouths, and sometimes munched up charcoal to purify them.
  But the younger generation have discarded the mouth-rinsing habit, and not
  yet attained to a tooth-brush: result, gradual deterioration in teeth, a
  deterioration probably helped by the drinking of hot liquids. Blacks of the
  old time drank nothing hot. Perhaps, too, their tough meats gave muscular
  strength to their jaws.</p>
  <p>To blacks, kissing is a &lsquo;white foolishness,&rsquo; also handshaking;
  in olden times even to smell a stranger was considered a risk.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  The Amusements Of Blacks</b></h2>
  <p>A very favourite game of the old men was skipping&mdash;Brambahl, they called
  it.</p>
  <p>They had a long rope, a man at each end to swing it. When it is in full
  swing in goes the skipper. After skipping in an ordinary way for a few rounds,
  he begins the variations, which consist, amongst other things, of his taking
  thorns out of his feet, digging as if for larvae of ants, digging yams,
  grinding grass-seed, jumping like a frog, doing a sort of cobbler&rsquo;s
  dance, striking an attitude as if looking for something in the distance,
  running out, snatching up a child, and skipping with it in his arms, or lying
  flat down on the ground, measuring his full length in that position, rising
  and letting the rope slip under him; the rope going the whole time, of course,
  never varying in pace nor pausing for any of the variations.</p>
  <p>The one who can most successfully vary the performance is victor. Old men
  of over seventy seemed the best at skipping.</p>
  <p>There is great excitement over Bubberah, or come-back boomerang throwing.</p>
  <p>Every candidate has a little fire, where, after having rubbed his bubberah
  with charred grass and fat, he warms it, eyes it up and down to see that
  it is true, then out he comes, weapon in hand. He looks at the winning spot,
  and with a scientific flourish of his arm sends his bubberah forth on its
  circular flight; you would think it was going into the Beyond, when it curves
  round and comes gyrating back to the given spot. Here again the old ones
  score.</p>
  <p>Wungoolay is another old game.</p>
  <p>A number of black fellows arm themselves with a number of spears, or rather
  pointed sticks, between four and five feet long, called widyu-widyu. Two
  men take the wungoolays, which are pieces of bark, either squared or roughly
  rounded, about fifteen inches in diameter. These men go about fifty yards
  from each other; first one and then another throws the wungoolays, which
  roll swiftly along the ground past the men with the spears, who are stationed
  midway between the other two a few yards from the path of the wungoolays,
  which, as they come rolling rapidly past, the men try to spear with their
  widyu-widyu; he who hits the most, wins the game. It looks easy enough, but
  here again the old men scored.</p>
  <p>For Gurril Boodthul, if a bush is not at hand, a bushy branch of a tree
  is stuck up. The men arm themselves with small boodthuls, or miniature waddies,
  then stand a few feet behind the bush, which varies from five to eight feet
  or so in height at competitions. They throw their boodthuls in turn; these
  have to skim through the top of the bush, which seems to give them fresh
  impetus instead of slackening them. The distance they go beyond is the test
  of a good thrower; over three hundred yards is not unusual. As practice in
  this game is kept up, the young men hold their own.</p>
  <p>There is another throwing stick somewhat larger than the gurril boodthul,
  which only weighs about three ounces, and is about a foot in length. The
  other stick is thrown to touch the ground, then bound on, sometimes making
  one high long leap, sometimes a series of jumps, as a flat pebble does when
  thrown along the water in the game children call &lsquo;ducks and drakes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Yahweerh is a sort of sham trial fight. One man has a bark shield, and he
  has to defend himself with it from the bark toy boomerangs the others throw.
  Here again the old men win. Their games, which old and young alike play,
  are distinctly childish.</p>
  <p>Boogalah, or ball, is one. In playing this all of one Dh&eacute;, or totem,
  are partners. The ball, made of sewn-up kangaroo skin, is thrown in the air;
  whoever catches it goes with his or her division&mdash;for women join in
  this game&mdash;into a group in the middle, the other circling round. The
  ball is thrown in the air, and if one of the circle outside the centre ring
  catches it, then his side namely, all his totem&mdash;go into the middle,
  the others circling round, and so on. The totem keeping it longest wins.</p>
  <p>Goomboobooddoo, or wrestling, is a great Boorah-time entertainment. Family
  clan against clan. Kubbee against Hippi, and so on. A Hippi, for example,
  will go into a ring and plant there a mudgee, or painted stick with a bunch
  of feathers at the top. In will run a Kubbee and try to make off with the
  stick; Hippi will grapple with him, and a wrestling match comes off. Into
  the ring will go others of each side wrestling in their turn. The side that
  finally throws the most men, and gets the mudgee, wins. Before wrestling
  matches, there is much greasing of bodies to make them slippery.</p>
  <p>Wimberoo was a favourite fireside game. A big fire was made of leafy branches.
  Each player got a dry Coolabah leaf, warmed it until it bent a little, then
  placed it on two fingers and hit it with one into where the current of air,
  caused by the flame, caught it and bore it aloft. They all jerked their leaves
  together, and anxiously watched whose would go the highest. Each watched
  his leaf descend, caught it, and began again. So on until tired.</p>
  <p>Woolbooldarn is an absolutely infantile game. A low, overhanging branch
  of a tree is chosen, and as many as it will bear, old and young, men and
  women, straddle it; and, holding on to the higher overhanging branches, they
  swing up and down with as much spring as they can get out of the branch they
  are on.</p>
  <p>Whagoo is just like our &lsquo;hide and seek.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Gooumoorhs, or corroborees, are of course their greatest entertainment,
  their opera, ballet, and the rest; only they reverse the usual order of things
  obtaining elsewhere. The women form the orchestra, the men are the dancers,
  as a rule, though women do on occasions take part too. The dancers rarely
  sing while performing their evolutions, though they will end up a measure
  at times with a loud &lsquo;Ooh! Ooh!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Wahl Wah!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There are two dances they think very clever: one a sort of in and out movement
  with the knees, while keeping the feet close together. Another, which they
  called &lsquo;shivering of the chest,&rsquo; a sort of drawing in and out of their
  breath, causing a vibratory motion.</p>
  <p>Then they give a sort of Sandow performance all in time to the music. They
  first start the muscles of their legs showing, then the arms, and down the
  sides of the chest. I am afraid I was not educated up to be appreciative
  of any of these special wonders, though Matah and others said their muscular
  training was marvellous.</p>
  <p>From a spectacular point of view I thought much more interesting a corroboree
  illustrating the coming of the first steamer up the Barwon.</p>
  <p>The steamer was made&mdash;for the corroboree, I mean&mdash;of logs with
  mud layered over them, painted up, a hollow log for a funnel in the middle.
  There was a little opening in the far side of the steamer in which a fire
  was made, the smoke issuing through the hollow log in the most realistic
  fashion. The blacks who first came on the stage were all supposed to represent
  various birds disturbed by this strange sight&mdash;cranes, pelicans, black
  swans, and ducks. The peculiarities of each bird were well imitated; and
  as each section in turn was startled, their cries were realistically given.
  Hearing which, on the scene came some armed black fellows, who, seeing what
  the birds had seen, started back in astonishment, seemed to have a great
  dumb-show palaver, then one by one, clutching their weapons, they came forward
  to more closely examine the new &lsquo;debbil debbil.&rsquo; Here some one
  would stoke the fire, out would belch through the funnel a big smoke and
  a lapping flame, away went the blacks into the bush as if too terrified to
  stay. But you can&rsquo;t describe a corroboree, it wants the scenic effects
  of the grim bush: tapering, dark Belahs, Coolabahs contorted into quaint
  shapes and excrescences by extremes of flood and drought, and their grotesqueness
  lit up by the flickering fires, until the trees themselves look like demons
  of the night, and the painted black fellows their attendant spirits stealing
  into the firelight from what seems a vast, dark, unknown Beyond.</p>
  <p>The sing-song seems to suit it, and the well-timed clicking of the boomerangs
  and thudding of the rolled-up rugs. The blacks are great patrons of art,
  and encourage native talent in the most praiseworthy way; although, judging
  from one of their legends, you might think they were not.</p>
  <p>This legend tells how Goolahwilleel had the soul of an artist, and when
  his family sent him out to hunt their daily dinner, he forgot his quest and
  perfected his art, which was the modelling of a kangaroo in gum. When his
  work was finished, with the pride of a successful artist he returned for
  applause.</p>
  <p>His family demanded of him meat; he showed his kangaroo.</p>
  <p>His masterpiece was unappreciated. Even as did Palissy&rsquo;s&mdash;of
  pottery fame&mdash;wife, so did Goolahwilleel&rsquo;s family revile him.</p>
  <p>His freedom to wander at will, seeking inspiration and giving it form, was
  taken from him. He was driven out: daily to slay, that his family might feed,
  and never again was he let go alone&mdash;a crowd of relations went with
  him!</p>
  <p>Figure to yourself what a damper to inspiration must have been that crowd
  of relations; how it must have slain the artist in Goolahwilleel.</p>
  <p>How the old legend repeats itself, and now as then, how often the artist
  is woman&mdash;slain that she by the caterer may live. Surely in the interests
  of intellect was the prayer made: &lsquo;Give us our daily bread.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Perhaps the old legend of Goolahwilleel was originally told with a moral,
  and that may be: why black artists are so well treated now.</p>
  <p>A maker of new songs or corroborees is always kept well supplied with the
  luxuries of life; it may be that such an one is a little feared as being
  supposed to have direct communication with the spirits who teach him his
  art. A fine frenzy is said to seize some of their poets and playwrights,
  who, for the time being, are quite under the domination of the spirits&mdash;possessed
  of devils, in fact. When the period of mental incubation is over and the
  song hatched out, the possessed ones return to their normal condition, the
  devils are cast out, and the songs are all that remain in evidence that the
  artist was ever possessed.</p>
  <p>Some songs do not require this process of fine frenzy they come along in
  the course of barter, handed from tribe to tribe.</p>
  <p>Ghiribul, or riddles, play a great part in their social life, and he who
  knows many is much sought after.</p>
  <p>Most of these ghiribul are not translatable, being little songs describing
  the things to be guessed, whose peculiarities the singer acts as he sings&mdash;a
  sort of one-man show, pantomime in miniature, with a riddle running through
  it.</p>
  <p>Some which I will give indicate the nature of others.</p>
  <p>What is it that says to the flood-water, &lsquo;I am too strong for you;
  you can not push me back&rsquo;? <i>Ans</i>. Goodoo, the codfish.</p>
  <p>What is it that says, &lsquo;You cannot help yourself; you will have to
  go and let me take your place; you cannot stay when I come&rsquo;? <i>Ans</i>.
  The grey hairs in a man&rsquo;s beard to the black ones.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If a man hide himself so that his wife could not see him, and he
  wanted her to know where he was, yet had promised not to speak, laugh, cry,
  sneeze, cough, nor move his hands nor feet, how could he do so?&rsquo; <i>Ans</i>.
  Whistle.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The strongest man cannot stand against me. I can knock him down,
  yet I do not hurt him. He feels better for my having knocked him down. What
  am I?&rsquo; <i>Ans</i>. Sleep.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I am not water, yet all who are thirsty, seeing me, come toward me
  to drink, though I am no liquid. What am I?&rsquo; <i>Ans</i>. Mirage.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it that goes along the creek, across the creek, underneath
  it, and along it again, and yet has left neither side?&rsquo; <i>Ans</i>.
  The yellow-flowering creeping water-weed.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here I am, just in front of you. I can&rsquo;t move; but if you kick
  me, I will knock you down, though I will not move to do it. Who says this?&rsquo; <i>Ans</i>.
  A stump that any one falls over.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You cannot walk without me, yet you grease your body and forget me
  and let me crack, even though but for me you could neither walk nor run.
  Who says that?&rsquo; <i>Ans</i>. A black fellow&rsquo;s feet, which he neglects
  to grease when doing the rest of his body.</p>
  <p>With riddles ends, I think, the list of the blacks&rsquo; amusements, unless
  you count fights. The blacks are a bit Celtic in that way; some are real
  fire-eaters, always spoiling for a row. But in most everyday rows the feelings
  are more damaged than the bodies.</p>
  <p>An old gin in a rage will say more in a given time, without taking breath,
  than any human being I have ever seen; it is simply physiologically marvellous.
  From the noise you would think murder at least would result. You listen in
  dread of a tragedy; you hear the totem and multiplex totems of her opponent
  being scoffed at, strung out one after another, deadly insult after deadly
  insult. The insulted returns insult for insult; result, a lively cross fire.</p>
  <p>It lulls down; the insults are exhausted, quietude reigns. Some one makes
  a joke, all are laughing together in amity. From impending tragedy to comedy
  the work of a few minutes. A mercurial race indeed, but not a forgetful one.
  A black fellow never forgives a broken promise, and he can cherish a grudge
  from generation to generation as well as remember a kindness.</p>
  <p>Though, when high pitched in quarrels, their voices lose their natural tones,
  as a rule those of the blacks are remarkably sweet and soft, quite musical;
  their language noticeable for its freedom from harsh sounds.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  Bush Bogies And Finis</b></h2>
  <p>Weeweemul is a big spirit that flies in the air; he takes the bodies of
  dead people away and eats them. That is why the dead are so closely watched
  before burial.</p>
  <p>Gwaibooyanbooyan is the hairless red devil of the scrubs, who kills and
  eats any one he meets, unless they are quick enough to get away before he
  sees them, as one woman of this tribe is said to have done on the Eurahbah
  ridge. It would really seem as if there were a debbil debbil on that ridge;
  every boundary rider who lives there takes to drink. I think the red spirit
  must be rum.</p>
  <p>Marahgoo are man-shaped devils, to be recognised by the white swansdown
  cap they wear, and the red rugs they carry. Red is a great devil&rsquo;s
  colour amongst blacks some will never wear it on that account.</p>
  <p>These Marahgoo always have with them a mysterious drink, which they offer
  to any one they meet. It is like drinking dirt, and makes the drinker dream
  dreams and see visions, in which he is taken down to the underground spirit-world
  of the Marahgoo, where anything he wishes for appears at once. The entrance
  to this world is said to be near a never-drying waterhole, in a huge scrub,
  near Pilliga. If a man drinks the draught, unless he is made Marahgoo, he
  dies.</p>
  <p>Each totem is warned by its bird sub-totems of the coming of Marahgoo, and
  after such a warning tribes take care, if wise, to stay in camp; or should
  a man go out, he will smear his face with black, and put rings of black round
  his wrists and ankles, and probably have a little charm song sung over him.</p>
  <p>Birrahmulgerhyerh are blacks with devils in them, who, armed with bags full
  of poison-sticks, or bones&mdash;called gooweera&mdash;are invisible to all
  but wirreenuns or wizards. Others are warned of their coming by hearing the
  rattle of the gooweeras knocking together. When the Birrahmulgerhyerh are
  about, all are warned not to carry firesticks, which at other times after
  dark they are never without in order to scare off spirits, but now such a
  light would show the Birrahmulgerhyerh where to point their gooweeras. They
  are said only to point these poison-sticks at law-breakers, and even then
  only against persons in a strange country. Their own land is down Brewarrina
  way, but there they make no punitive expeditions, travelling up the Narran
  and elsewhere for that purpose.</p>
  <p>The Euloowayi, or long-nailed devils, are spirits which live where the sun
  sets. Just as the afterglow dies in the sky, they come out victim-hunting.
  These Euloowayi demand a tribute of young black men from the camp, to recoup
  their own ranks.</p>
  <p>When this tribute has to be paid, the old men get some ten or so young ones,
  and march them off to a Minggah at about ten or fifteen miles from the camp.
  There they make them climb into the Minggah, to sit there all day. They must
  not move, not even so much as wink an eyelid. At night time they are allowed
  to come down, and are given some meat, which they must eat raw.</p>
  <p>The old men from the camp go back leaving their victims with the Euloowayi,
  who keep the boys up the tree for some days, bringing them raw meat at night.
  At last they say:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come and try if your nails are long and strong enough. See who can
  best tear this bark off with them.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They all try, and if all are equally good, the old Euloowayi say:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You are right. How do you feel?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Strong,&rsquo; they answer.</p>
  <p>They are kept on the tree about a month, then taken into the bush to hunt
  human beings, to deceive whom they take new forms at times. A couple of blacks
  may be hunting&mdash;one will be after honey, another after opossums. The
  one after opossums will go to a tree, see an opossum, chop into the tree,
  seize the opossum by the tail as usual. He cannot move him. He&rsquo;ll seize
  him by the hind legs, still he cannot move him. Then he will hear a voice
  say, &lsquo;Leave him alone, you can&rsquo;t move him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The hunter will look down, see nothing but a rainbow at the foot of the
  tree. Wonderingly he&rsquo;ll come down, and immediately the Euloowayi, who
  have been in the form of the opossum in the tree and the rainbow on the ground,
  seize him, tear him open with their long nails, take out all his fat, stuff
  him up again with grass and leaves, and send him back to the camp. When he
  reaches there, he starts scolding every one. Probably they guess by his violent
  words and actions that he is a victim of the Euloowayi. If so, they are careful
  not to answer him; were they to do so he would drop dead. Any way, he will
  die that night. When the magpies and butcher-birds sing much it is a sign
  the Euloowayi are about.</p>
  <p>Gineet Gineet, so called from his cry, is the bogy that black children dread.
  He is a black man who goes about with a goolay or net across his shoulders,
  into which he pops any children he can steal.</p>
  <p>Several waterholes are taboo as bathing-places. They are said to be haunted
  by Kurreah, which swallow their victims whole, or by Gowargay, the featherless
  emu, who sucks down in a whirlpool any one who dares to bathe in his holes.</p>
  <p>Nahgul is the rejected Gayandil who was found by Byamee too destructive
  to act as president of the Boorahs.</p>
  <p>He principally haunts Boorah grounds. He still has a Boorah gubberrah, a
  sacred stone, inside him, hence his strength.</p>
  <p>He sets string traps for men, touching which they feel ill, and suddenly
  drop down never to rise again. The wirreenuns know then that Nahgul is about.
  They find out where he is. Circling, at a good distance, the spot he is on,
  they corroboree round it. Hearing them, Nahgul comes out. They close in and
  seize him, kill him, drink his blood, and eat him; by so doing gaining immense
  additional strength.</p>
  <p>Marmbeyah are tree spirits, somewhat akin to the Nats of Burmah. One, a
  huge, fat spirit&mdash;if you can imagine a fat spirit&mdash;carried a green
  boondee, or waddy, with which he tapped people on the backs of their necks:
  result, heat apoplexy. A few years ago, an old black fellow laid wait for
  him and &lsquo;flattened him out,&rsquo; since which there has been no heat
  apoplexy. We think it is because the bad times have made people too poor
  to overheat themselves with bad spirits of a liquid kind. The blacks differ,
  and certainly there were some cases of even total abstainers falling victims
  to the heat wave.</p>
  <p>Hatefully frequent devil visitors are those who animate the boolees, or
  whirlwinds. If these whirl near the house they smother everything with debris
  and dust.</p>
  <p>The Black-but-Comelys say, as they clear the dirt away: &lsquo;I wish whoever
  in this house those boolees are after would go out when they come, not let &rsquo;em
  hunt after &rsquo;em here and make this mess.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The Wurrawilberos chiefly animate these. But sometimes the wirreenuns use
  whirlwinds as mediums of transit for their Mullee Mullees, or dream spirits,
  sent in pursuit of some enemy, to capture a woman, or incarnate child spirit;
  women dread boolees, more even than men, on this account. Great wirreenuns
  are said to get rid of evil spirits by eating the form in which they appear.
  I&rsquo;m sure we all swallowed a good share of the dust devils, but still
  they came; evidently we were not wizards or witches.</p>
  <p>The plain of Weawarra is haunted. Once long ago there was a fight there.
  Two young warriors but lately married were slain. As their bodies were never
  recovered, they were supposed to have been stolen and eaten by the enemy.
  Their young widows spent days searching for them, after the tribe had given
  up hope of finding them. At last the widows&mdash;who had refused to marry
  again, declaring their husbands yet lived, and that one day they would find
  them&mdash;disappeared.</p>
  <p>Time passed; they did not return, so were supposed to be dead too. Then
  arose the rumour that their ghosts had been seen, and to this day it is said
  the plain of Weawarra is haunted by them.</p>
  <p>Should men camp there at night, these women spirits silently steal into
  the camp. The men, thinking they are women from some tribe they do not know,
  speak to them; but silently there they sit, making no answer, and vanish
  again before the dawn of day, to renew their search night after night.</p>
  <p>The high ridges above Warrangilla are haunted by two women, who tradition
  says were buried alive. Their spirits have never rested, but come out at
  all times from the huge fissure in the ridges where their bodies were put.
  Their anguished cries as the stones and earth fell on them are still to be
  heard echoing through the scrub there; and sometimes it is said one, keener
  sighted than his fellows, sees their spirit forms flitting through the Budtha
  bushes, and hears again their tragic cries, as they disappear once more into
  the fathomless fissure.</p>
  <p>There is a tradition&mdash;common, I believe, to many black tribes, even
  outside Australia&mdash;that, long before the coming of the white people
  into this country, two beautiful white girls lived with the blacks. They
  had long hair to their waists. They were called Bungebah, and were killed
  as devils by an alien tribe somewhere between Noorahwahgean and Gooroolay.
  Where their blood was spilled two red-leaved trees have grown, and that place
  is still haunted by their spirits.</p>
  <p>Amid the Cookeran Lake still wanders the woman who arrived late at the big
  Boorah, having lost her children one by one on the track, arriving at last
  with only her dead baby in the net at her back. As she died she cursed the
  tribes who had deserted her, and turned them into trees. Some of the blacks
  were in groups a little way off; those, too, she cursed, and they were changed
  into forests of Belah, which look dark and funereal as you drive through
  them; and the murmuring sound, as the wind wails through their tops, has
  a very sad sound. She wanders through these forests and round the lake, the
  dead baby still in the goolay on her back, and sometimes her voice is heard
  mingling with the voices of the forest; and as the shadows fall, she may
  be seen flitting past, they say.</p>
  <p>Noorahgogo is a very handsome bronze and peacock-blue beetle, said to embody
  a spirit which always answers the cry of a Noongahburrah in the bush. The
  bright orange-red fungi on the fallen trees are devils&rsquo; bread, and
  should a child touch any he will be spirited away.</p>
  <p>Very mournful are the bush nights if you happen to be alone on your verandah.
  Away on the flat sound the cries of curlews; past flies a night heron; then
  the discordant voice of a plover is heard. In all these birds are embodied
  the spirits of men of the past; each has its legend.</p>
  <p>Perhaps some passing swans will cry &lsquo;Biboh, biboh,&rsquo; reminding
  in vain the camp wizards that they too were once men, and long to be again.
  Poor enchanted swans! to whose enchantment we owe the lovely flannel flowers
  of New South Wales, and the red epacris bells.</p>
  <p>But in spite of their sadness the bush nights are lovely, when the landscapes
  are glorified by the magic of the moon. Even the gum leaves are transmuted
  into silver as the moonlight laves them, making the blacks say the leaves
  laugh, and the shimmer is like a smile.</p>
  <p>No wonder trees have such a place in the old religions of the world, and
  wirreenuns, even as do Buddhists, love to linger beneath their branches&mdash;the
  one holding converse with his spirit friends, the other cultivating the perfect
  peace.</p>
  <p>There would not be much perfect peace about a wirreenun&rsquo;s communing
  with the spirits if it happened to be in mosquito time. The blacks say a
  little grey-speckled bird rules the mosquitoes, and calls them from their
  swamp-homes to attack us. In the mythological days this bird&mdash;a woman&mdash;was
  badly treated by a man who translated her sons to the sky; having revenged
  herself on him, she vowed vengeance on all men, and in the form of the mosquito
  bird wreaks that vengeance. Her mosquito slaves have just the same spots
  on their wings as she has.</p>
  <p>I dare say little with an air of finality about black people; I have lived
  too much with them for that. To be positive, you should never spend more
  than six months in their neighbourhood; in fact, if you want to keep your
  anthropological ideas quite firm, it is safer to let the blacks remain in
  inland Australia while you stay a few thousand miles away. Otherwise, your
  preconceived notions are almost sure to totter to their foundations; and
  nothing is more annoying than to have elaborately built-up, delightfully
  logical theories, played ninepins with by an old greybeard of a black, who
  apparently objects to his beliefs being classified, docketed, and pigeon-holed,
  until he has had his say.</p>
  <p>After all, when we consider their marriage restrictions, their totems, and
  the rest, what becomes of the freedom of the savage? As with us, as Montague
  says, &lsquo;Our laws of conscience, which we pretend to be derived from
  Nature, proceed from custom.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I have often thought the failure of the generality of missionaries lay in
  the fact that they began at the wrong end. Not recognising the tyranny of
  custom, though themselves victims to it, they ignore, as a rule, the religion
  into which the black is born, and by which he lived, in much closer obedience
  to its laws than we of this latter-day Christendom. It seems to me, if we
  cannot respect the religion of others we deny our own. If we are powerless
  to see the theism behind the overlying animism, we argue a strange ignorance
  of what crept over other faiths, in the way of legends and superstitions
  quite foreign to the simplicity of the beginnings.</p>
  <p>To be a success, a missionary, I think, should&mdash;as many do, happily&mdash;before
  he goes out to teach, acquaint himself with the making of the world&rsquo;s
  religions, and particularly with the one he is going to supplant. He will
  probably find that elimination of some savageries is all that is required,
  leaving enough good to form a workable religion understanded of his congregation.</p>
  <p>If he ignores their faith, thrusting his own, with its mysteries which puzzle
  even theologians, upon them, they will be but as whited sepulchres, or, at
  best, parrots.</p>
