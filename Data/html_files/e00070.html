<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Preface"></a>Preface</b></h2>
<p>The&nbsp;object of the present publication is  to gather together all the old bush songs that are worth remembering. Apart  from other considerations, there are many Australians who will be reminded by  these songs of the life of the shearing sheds, the roar of the diggings  townships, and the campfires of the overlanders. The diggings are all deep  sinking now, the shearing is done by contract, and the cattle are sent by rail  to market, while newspapers travel all over Australia; so there will be no more  bush ballads composed and sung, as these were composed and sung, as records of  the early days of the nation. In their very roughness, in their absolute lack  of any mention of home ties or of the domestic affections, they proclaim their  genuineness. They were collected from all parts of Australia, and have been patched  together by the compiler to the best of his ability, with the idea of  presenting the song as nearly as possible as it was sung, rather than  attempting to soften any roughness or irregularity of metre. Attempts to  ascertain the names of the authors have produced contradictory statements, and  no doubt some of the songs were begun by one man and finished or improved by  another, or several others. Some few fairly recent ballads have been included,  but for the most part no attempt has been made to include any of the more  ambitious literary productions of modern writers. This collection is intended  to consist of the old bush songs as they were sung in the early days, and as  such it is placed before the reader.</p>
<p>Most cordial thanks are due to those who have sent contributions,  and it is hoped that others who can remember any old songs not included here  will forward them for inclusion in a future edition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;All&nbsp;human beings not utterly savage long for some information  about past times, and are delighted by narratives which present pictures to the  eye of the mind. But it is only in very enlightened communities that books are  readily accessible. Metrical composition, therefore, which, in a highly civilised  nation, is a mere luxury, is in nations imperfectly civilised almost a  necessity of life, and is valued less on account of the pleasure which it gives  to the ear than on account of the help which it gives to the memory. A man who  can invent or embellish an interesting story and put it into a form which  others may easily retain in their recollection will always be highly esteemed  by a people eager for amusement and information, but destitute of libraries.  Such is the origin of ballad poetry, a species of composition which scarcely  ever fails to spring up and flourish in every society at a certain point in the  progress towards refinement.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Macaulay</i>.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s&nbsp;history is so short, and her  progress has been so wonderfully rapid, that, seeing things as they are to-day,  it is hard to believe that among us still are men who can remember the days  when convicts in irons tramped the streets of Sydney, and it was unsafe to go  to and from Sydney and Parramatta without an armed escort; who were partakers  of the roaring days of the diggings when miners lit their pipes with five-pound  notes and shod their horses with gold; who have exchanged shots with Gilbert  and Morgan, and have watched the lumbering police of the old days scouring the  country to earn the thousand pounds reward on the head of Ben Hall. So far as  materials for ballads go, the first sixty or seventy years of our history are  equal to about three hundred years of the life of an old and settled nation.  The population of the country comprised a most curious medley. Among the early  settlers were some of the most refined and educated, and some of the most  ignorant, people on the face of the earth. Among the assisted immigrants and  currency lads of the earlier days education was not a strong point; and such  newspapers as there were could not be obtained by one-half of the population,  and could not be read by a very large percentage of the other half. It is no  wonder, then, that the making of ballads flourished in Australia just as it did in England, Scotland,  and Ireland  in the days before printing was in common use. And it was not only in the  abundance of matter that the circumstances of the infant Colony were favourable  to ballad-making. The curious upheavals of Australian life had set the Oxford  graduate carrying his swag and cadging for food at the prosperous homestead of  one who could scarcely write his name; the digger, peeping out of his hole&mdash;like  a rabbit out of his burrow&mdash;at the license hunters, had, perhaps, in another  clime charmed cultivated audiences by his singing and improvisation; the bush  was full of ne&rsquo;er-do-wells&mdash;singers and professional entertainers and so on&mdash;who  had &ldquo;come to grief&rdquo; and had to take to hard work to earn a crust to carry them  on until they could &ldquo;strike a new patch.&rdquo; No wonder that, with all this talent  to hand, songs and ballads of a rough sort were plentiful enough.</p>
<p>Most of these songs, even in the few years  that they have been extant, have developed three or four different readings,  and not only have the ballads been altered, but many of them have been  forgotten altogether. Only one very imperfect song has come to hand dealing  directly with the convict days, but there must have been many ballads composed  and sung by the prisoners&mdash;ballads in which the horrors of Port Arthur in  Tasmania, the grim, grey prisons of Norfolk Island, the curse of official  tyranny, and the humours of the rum traffic had their share. Possibly some lost  singer of convictdom poured out his regrets in words straight from the soul,  and produced a song worthy to rank as a classic: but all the songs of that day  have been mercifully allowed to drift into oblivion; and their singers, with  their grey clothes and their fetters, have gone clanking down to the limbo of  forgotten things.</p>
<p>The collection begins with two aboriginal  songs. These songs were supplied by Mr. S. M. Mowle, a very old colonist, with  much experience of the blacks fifty years ago. He writes&mdash; &ldquo;I could never find  out what the words meant, and I don&rsquo;t think the blacks themselves knew.&rdquo; Other  authorities, however, say that the blacks&rsquo; songs were very elaborate, and that  they composed corroborees which reached a high dramatic level. The question is  of interest, and might be worth investigation.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see how the progress  of settlement is reflected in the various songs. Beginning with the crude early  days, when there was land and to spare, and when labour was in demand and Australia  was&nbsp;<i>terra incognita</i>&nbsp;to all, we find in &ldquo;Paddy Malone&rdquo; a  fitting chronicle in rhyme. In this ballad a raw, Irish immigrant tells of his  adventures in the Australian bush. He was put to shepherding and  bullock-driving, which in itself proves that labourers were at a premium, and  that instead of a man having to hunt for a job the job had to hunt for the man.  He lost his sheep, and the bullocks got away from him. It will be noticed that  there is no mention of fences or roads in this ballad, as in the &ldquo;Paddy Malone&rdquo;  days fences and roads were not very much met with. Compare also &ldquo;The Beautiful  Land of Australia.&rdquo;  In this the settler reaches Sydney,  and &ldquo;Upon the map I chose my land,&rdquo; which shows that there was land enough and  to spare, and that the system of grants to free immigrants was in full swing.  It is noticeable that in all the ballads of early days there is a sort of  happy-go-lucky spirit which reflects the easy-come, easy-go style of the times.</p>
<p>Next in order come the ballads of the days  when the squatters had established themselves, and the poorer classes found it  harder to live. &ldquo;The Squatter&rsquo;s Man&rdquo; is a balled of these harder times. Compare  it with &ldquo;Paddy Malone.&rdquo; There is no talk of sending a new-chum out with sheep  and bullocks now. The first rush of settlement is over, and the haughty  squatter contemptuously offers ten shillings a week as wages to a man for a  variety of drudgery that is set out with much spirit in the song.</p>
<p>Next come the free-selection days, when  the runs of these squatters were thrown open to purchase on certain easy  conditions, and at once the ballads change their tone, and there is quite a  p&aelig;an of victory in &ldquo;The Free Selector&mdash;a Song of 1861.&rdquo; The reader will note  that &ldquo;The Land Bill has passed and the good time has come,&rdquo; and further on the  singer says</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;We may reside<br>
In a home of our own by some clear waterside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squatters also had a word to say, and  &ldquo;The Broken-down Squatter&rdquo; puts their side of the case in a sort of&nbsp;<i>ad  misericordiam</i>&nbsp;appeal; while &ldquo;The Eumerella Shore&rdquo; is a smart hit at  the cattle-stealers who availed themselves of the chances afforded by the new  state of things in the country. Later still comes the time when the selectors  became employers of labour, and &ldquo;The Stringy-bark Cockatoo,&rdquo; though rough in  style and versification, is a splendid hit at the new squireens. A &ldquo;cockatoo,&rdquo;  it should be explained, is a small settler, and the stringy-bark tree is an  unfailing sign of poor land; and the minstrel was much worse treated when  working for &ldquo;The Stringy-bark Cockatoo&rdquo; than when he was a &ldquo;Squatter&rsquo;s man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much for the historical element; now as  to the songs themselves. As metrical compositions they cannot be expected to  rank high. In all her history England  has produced only a few good ballads, and ballads do not get justice from cold  print. An old Scotchman, to whom&nbsp;Sir Walter Scott&nbsp;read some of his  collected ballads, expressed the opinion that the ballads were spoilt by  printing. And these bush songs, to be heard at their best, should be heard to  an accompaniment of clashing shears when the voice of a shearer rises through  the din caused by the rush and bustle of a shearing shed, the scrambling of the  sheep in their pens, and the hurry of the pickers-up; or when, on the roads,  the cattle are restless on their camp at night and the man on watch, riding  round them, strikes up &ldquo;Bold Jack Donahoo&rdquo; to steady their nerves a little.  Drovers know that they must not sneak quietly about restless cattle&mdash;it is  better to sing to them and let them know that someone is stirring and watching;  and many a mob of wild, pike-horned Queensland cattle, half inclined to  stampede, has listened contentedly to the &ldquo;Wild Colonial Boy&rdquo; droned out in  true bush fashion till the daylight began to break and the mob was safe for  another day. Heard under such circumstances as these the songs have quite a  character of their own. A great deal depends, too, on the way in which they are  sung. The true bushman never hurries his songs. They are designed expressly to  pass the time on long journeys or slow, wearisome rides after sheep or tired  cattle; so the songs are sung conscientiously through&mdash;chorus and all&mdash;and the  last three words of the song are always spoken, never sung. There is, too, a  strong Irish influence in the greater number of the songs; quite a large  proportion are sung to the tune of the &ldquo;Wearing of the Green,&rdquo; and the  admixture of Irish wit and Irish pathos in their composition can only be  brought out by a good singer.</p>
<p>One excuse, if excuse be needed, for the  publication of this collection is the fact that the songs it contains are fast  being forgotten. Thirty or forty years ago every station and every shearing  shed had its singer, who knew some of the bush songs. Nowadays they are never  sung, and even in districts where they took their rise they have pretty well  died out. Only a few years ago, every shearing shed had at least one minstrel  who could drone out the refrain of a shearing song&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;But, oh, boys, such sheep I never shore,<br>
As those that made us knuckle down at Goorianawa&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Goorianawa sheep are not  celebrated in song nowadays, and advertisement has failed to produce a copy of  the song. Down in the rough country near the Upper   Murrumbidgee, where the bushranger Gilbert was betrayed by a  relative and was shot by the police, there was a song about &ldquo;Dunn, Gilbert, and  Ben Hall&rdquo; It commenced&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Come all ye lads of loyalty and listen to my tale,<br>
  A story of bushranging days I will to you unveil,<br>
  &rsquo;Tis of those gallant heroes, we&rsquo;ll bless them one and all,<br>
And we&rsquo;ll sit and sing long live the King, Dunn, Gilbert, and Ben Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another line ran&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thousand pounds alive or dead, for Dunn, Gilbert, and Ben  Hall&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thirty years ago every one in the district  had heard this song, and all the sympathisers with the bushrangers (which meant  the bulk of the wild and scattered population) used to sing it on occasion; but  to-day the most persistent inquiry has failed to reveal one man who can  remember more than a few fragments of it; and yet it is only forty years since  Ben Hall was shot. It is in the hope of rescuing these rough bush ballads from  oblivion that the present collection is placed before the public.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="PaddyMaloneinAustralia"></a>Paddy Malone in Australia</b></h2>
<p>Och!&nbsp;my name’s Pat Malone, and I’m from Tipperary.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, I don’t know it now I’m so bothered, Ohone!<br>
  And the gals that I danced with, light-hearted and airy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s scarcely they’d notice poor Paddy Malone.<br>
  ’Tis twelve months or more since our ship she cast anchor<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In happy Australia, the Emigrant’s home,<br>
  And from that day to this there’s been nothing but canker,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grafe and vexation for Paddy Malone.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,  Paddy Malone! Oh, Paddy, Ohone!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad luck  to the agent that coaxed ye to roam.</p>
<p>Wid a man  called a squatter I soon got a place, sure,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’d a beard like a goat, and such whiskers, Ohone!<br>
  And he said—as he peeped through the hair on his faitures—<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he liked the appearance of Paddy Malone.<br>
  Wid him I agreed to go up to his station,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying abroad in the bush you’ll find yourself at home.<br>
  I liked his proposal, and ’out hesitation<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signed my name wid a ✘ that spelt  Paddy Malone.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,  Paddy Malone, you’re no scholard, Ohone!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, I  made a cris-crass that spelt Paddy Malone.</p>
<p>A-herding  my sheep in the bush, as they call it—<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no bush at all, but a mighty great wood,<br>
  Wid all the big trees that were small bushes one time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago, faith! I ’spose ’fore the flood.<br>
  To find out this big bush one day I went further,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees grew so thick that I couldn’t, Ohone!<br>
  I tried to go back then, but that I found harder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bothered and lost was poor Paddy Malone.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,  Paddy Malone, through the bush he did roam<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a  Babe in the Wood was poor Paddy Malone.</p>
<p>I was  soon overcome, sure, wid grafe and vexation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And camped, you must know, by the side of a log;<br>
  I was found the next day by a man from the station,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I coo-ey’d and roared like a bull in a bog.<br>
  The man said to me, “Arrah, Pat! where’s the sheep now?”<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says I, “I dunno! barring one here at home,”<br>
  And the master began and kicked up a big row too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swore he’d stop the wages of Paddy Malone.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrah!  Paddy Malone, you’re no shepherd, Ohone!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ll  try you with bullocks now, Paddy Malone.</p>
<p>To see me  dressed out with my team and my dray too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid a whip like a flail and such gaiters, Ohone!<br>
  But the bullocks, as they eyed me, they seemed for to say too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You may do your best, Paddy, we’re blest if we go.”<br>
  “Gee whoa! Redman! come hither, Damper!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoot, Magpie! Gee, Blackbird! Come hither, Whalebone!”<br>
  But the brutes turned round sharp, and away they did scamper,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heels over head turned poor Paddy Malone.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,  Paddy Malone! you’ve seen some bulls at home,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the  bulls of Australia  cows Paddy Malone.</p>
<p>I was found the next day where the brutes they did throw me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a man passing by, upon hearing me groan,<br>
  And wiping the mud from my face that he knew me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says he, “Your name’s Paddy?” “Yes! Paddy Malone.”<br>
  I thin says to him, “You’re an angel sent down, sure!”<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No, faith, but I’m not; but a friend of your own!”<br>
  And by his persuasion, for home then I started,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you now see before you poor Paddy Malone.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrah,  Paddy Malone! you are now safe at home.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad  luck to the agent that coaxed ye to roam.</p>

<p class="note">“Calling at the depôt to get an offsider.”—Female immigrants were  housed at the depôt on arrival, and many found husbands within a few hours of  their landing. The minstrel, therefore, proposes to call at the depôt to get himself  a wife from among the immigrants. An offsider is a bullock-drivers  assistant—one who walks on the off-side of the team and flogs the bullocks on  that side when occasion arises. The word afterwards came to mean an assistant  of any kind.</p>

<p>I’ve&nbsp;had all sorts of luck, sometimes bad, sometimes  better,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now I have somebody’s luck and my own,<br>
  For I stooped in the street and I picked up a letter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which some one had written to send away home.</p>
<p>The old  adage says, “What you find, you may keep it,”<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as most of these old sayings are very true,<br>
  I straight broke the seal, and then having read it,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of this letter I tell unto you.</p>
<p align="center">The&nbsp;Letter</p>
<p>Dear  Dermot, I hope when this letter gets to you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’Twill find you in health, as now it leaves me;<br>
  But I hope you’re more happy than I am in Australia—<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, it’s small comfort that you have, achree!</p>
<p>Hard  fortune’s been mine since crossing the line,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though that same I ne’er saw, for we crossed it at night;<br>
  But they say ’twas laid down at expense of the Crown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To divide the wrong side of the world from the right.</p>
<p>But what  should a boy placed in my situation<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know about lines laid across the big sea!<br>
  But, faith, this I know, and without navigation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m at the wrong side of the line, anyway.</p>
<p>I’m  telling you now how strange seasons fall.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here rain and sleet in the month of July,<br>
  And hailstones as big as a small cannon-ball—<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they do as much harm—not a word of a lie!</p>
<p>But the  making of magistrates now all the rage is,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every flockmaster’s a justice of peace;<br>
  They find it so easy to cancel the wages,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law is their own and they rob whom they please.</p>
<p>Pat  Murphy’s boy Tim, that married Moll Casey,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives on the Barcoo that’s away in the bush.<br>
  Himself and the wife, why they lived mighty aisy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till one day on Tim, oh, the blacks they did rush.</p>
<p>They  killed little Paddy, but spared the young baby,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was sickly—I think it was that—<br>
  And while Molly was crying, a gin said, “No habbie<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your thin picaninny—well wait till it’s fat.”</p>
<p>’Tis a  beautiful country to practise economy.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the houses out here are not quite waterproof,<br>
  But they’re illigant houses for studying astronomy—<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can lie on your back and read stars through the  roof</p>
<p>P.S.—This is cramped—if there’s no one to read it,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send for Tim Murphy, he’ll know every stroke.<br>

<p>Ten  pounds of flour, ten pounds of beef, some sugar and some tea,<br>
  That’s all they give to a hungry man, until the Seventh Day.<br>
  If you don’t be moighty sparing, you’ll go with a hungry gut—<br>
  For that’s one of the great misfortunes in an old bark hut.</p>

<p>The  bucket you boil your beef in has to carry water, too,<br>
  And they’ll say you’re getting mighty flash if you should ask for two.<br>

<p>Faith,  the table is not made of wood, as many you have seen—<br>
  For if I had one half so good, I’d think myself serene—<br>
  ’Tis only an old sheet of bark—God knows when it was cut—<br>

<p>And of  furniture, there’s no such thing, ’twas never in the place,<br>
  Except the stool I sit upon—and that’s an old gin case.<br>
  It does us for a safe as well, but you must keep it shut,<br>

<p>If you  should leave it open, and the flies should find your meat,<br>
  They’ll scarcely leave a single piece that’s fit for man to eat.<br>
  But you mustn’t curse, nor grumble—what won’t fatten will fill up—<br>

<p>In the  summer time, when the weather’s warm, this hut is nice and cool,<br>
  And you’ll find the gentle breezes blowing in through every hole.<br>
  You can leave the old door open, or you can leave it shut,<br>
  There’s no fear of suffocation in the old bark hut.</p>

<p>In the  winter time—preserve us all—to live in there’s a treat<br>
  Especially when it’s raining hard, and blowing wind and sleet.<br>
  The rain comes down the chimney, and your meat is black with soot—<br>
  That’s a substitute for pepper in an old bark hut.</p>

<p>I’ve seen  the rain come in this hut just like a perfect flood,<br>
  Especially through that great big hole where once the table stood.<br>
  There’s not a blessed spot, me boys, where you could lay your nut,<br>
  But the rain is sure to find you in the old bark hut.</p>

<p>So beside  the fire I make me bed, and there I lay me down,<br>
  And think myself as happy as the king that wears a crown.<br>
  But as you’d be dozing off to sleep a flea will wake you up,<br>
  Which makes you curse the vermin in the old bark hut.</p>

<p>Faith,  such flocks of fleas you never saw, they are so plump and fat,<br>
  And if you make a grab at one, he’ll spit just like a cat.<br>
  Last night they got my pack of cards, and were fighting for the cut—<br>
  I thought the devil had me in the old bark hut.</p>

<p>Oh, we started down from Roto when the sheds had all cut out.<br>
  We’d whips and whips of Rhino as we meant to push about,<br>
  So we humped our blues serenely and made for Sydney town,<br>
  With a three-spot cheque between us, as wanted knocking down.</p>
<p align="center">CHORUS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  we camped at Lazy Harry’s, on the road to Gundagai<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to Gundagai!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not five  miles from Gundagai!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we camped at Lazy Harry’s, on the road to  Gundagai.</p>
<p>Well, we  struck the Murrumbidgee near the Yanko in a  week,<br>
  And passed through old Narrandera and crossed the Burnet Creek.<br>
  And we never stopped at Wagga, for we’d Sydney  in our eye.<br>
  But we camped at Lazy Harry’s, on the road to Gundagai.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: But we camped, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Oh, I’ve  seen a lot of girls, my boys, and drunk a lot of beer,<br>
  And I’ve met with some of both, chaps, as has left me mighty queer;<br>
  But for beer to knock you sideways, and for girls to make you sigh,<br>
  You must camp at Lazy Harry’s, on the road to Gundagai.</p>
<p>Well, we  chucked our blooming swags off, and we walked into the bar,<br>
  And we called for rum-an’-raspb’ry and a shilling each cigar.<br>
  But the girl that served the pizen, she winked at Bill and I—<br>
  And we camped at Lazy Harry’s, not five miles from Gundagai.</p>
<p>In a week  the spree was over and the cheque was all knocked down,<br>
  So we shouldered our “Matildas,” and we turned our backs on town,<br>
  And the girls they stood a nobbler as we sadly said “Good bye,”<br>
  And we tramped from Lazy Harry’s, not five miles from Gundagai;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus:  And we tramped, &amp;c.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>I’ve&nbsp;shore at Burrabogie, and I’ve shore at Toganmain,<br>
  I’ve shore at big Willandra and upon the old Coleraine,<br>
  But before the shearin’ was over I’ve wished myself back, again<br>
  Shearin’ for old Tom Patterson, on the One Tree Plain.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they know me round the back blocks as Flash Jack  from Gundagai.</p>
<p>I’ve  shore at big Willandra and I’ve shore at Tilberoo,<br>
  And once I drew my blades, my boys, upon the famed Barcoo,<br>
  At Cowan Downs and Trida, as far as Moulamein,<br>
  But I always was glad to get back again to the One Tree Plain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus:  All among the wool, &amp;c.</p>
<p>I’ve  pinked ’em with the Wolseleys and I’ve rushed with B-bows, too,<br>
  And shaved ’em in the grease, my boys, with the grass seed showing through.<br>
  But I never slummed my pen, my lads, whate’er it might contain,<br>
  While shearin’ for old Tom Patterson, on the One Tree Plain.</p>
<p>I’ve been whalin’ up the Lachlan,  and I’ve dossed on Cooper’s Creek,<br>
  And once I rung Cudjingie shed, and blued it in a week.<br>
  But when Gabriel blows his trumpet, lads, I’ll catch the morning train,<br>
  And I’ll push for old Tom Patterson’s, on the One Tree Plain.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p class="note">“I’ve pinked ’em with the  Wolseleys, and I’ve rushed with B-bows, too.”—Wolseleys and B-bows are  respectively machines and hand-shears, and “pinking” means that he had shorn  the sheep so closely that the pink skin showed through. “I rung Cudjingie shed  and blued it in a week,” i.e., he was the ringer or fastest shearer of the  shed, and he dissipated the earnings in a single week’s drunkenness.</p>
<p class="note">“Whalin’ up the Lachlan.”—In  the old days there was an army of “sundowners” or professional loafers who  walked from station to station, ostensibly to look for work, but without any  idea of accepting it. These nomads often followed up and down certain rivers,  and would camp for days and fish for cod in the bends of the river. Hence  whaling up the Lachlan.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;weather had been sultry for a fortnight’s time or  more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the shearers had been driving might and main,<br>
  For some had got the century who’d ne’er got it before,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now all hands were wishing for the rain.</p>
<p align="center">CHORUS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For the boss is getting rusty and the ringer’s caving in,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his  bandaged wrist is aching with the pain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the second man, I fear, will make it hot for him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless  we have another fall of rain.</p>
<p>A few had  taken quarters and were coiling in their bunks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we shore the six-tooth wethers from the plain.<br>
  And if the sheep get harder, then a few more men will funk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we get another fall of rain.</p>
<p>But the  sky is clouding over, and the thunder’s muttering loud,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the clouds are driving eastward o’er the plain,<br>
  And I see the lightning flashing from the edge of yon black cloud,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I hear the gentle patter of the rain.</p>
<p>So, lads,  put on your stoppers, and let us to the hut,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where we’ll gather round and have a friendly game,<br>
  While some are playing music and some play ante up,<br>

  And we’ll block the classer’s table by the way we’ll put them through,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For everything is merry since the rain.</p>
<p>And the boss he won’t be rusty when his sheep they all are shorn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wringer’s wrist won’t ache much with the pain<br>
  Of pocketing his cheque for fifty pounds or more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the second man will press him hard again.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p class="note">“Another Fall of Rain” is a song  that needs a little explanation. The strain of shearing is very severe on the  wrists, and the ringer or fastest shearer is very apt to go in the wrists,  especially at the beginning of a season. Hence the desire of the shearers for a  fall of rain after a long stretch of hot weather.</p>

  But when they came to Sydney  gaol, he left them in a stew,<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus:  Then come, &amp;c.</p>
<p>As  Donahoo was cruising, one summer’s afternoon,<br>
  Little was his notion his death was near so soon,<br>
  When a sergeant of the horse police discharged his car-a-bine,<br>
  And called aloud on Donahoo to fight or to resign.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">(Air:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Four and  twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.”)</p>
<p>John Gilbert&nbsp;was a bushranger of terrible renown,<br>
  For sticking lots of people up and shooting others down.<br>
  John Gilbert said unto his pals, “Although they make a bobbery<br>
  About our tricks we have never done a tip-top thing in robbery.</p>
<p>“We have all of us a fancy for experiments in pillage,<br>
  Yet never have we seized a town, or even sacked a village.”<br>
  John Gilbert said unto his mates— “Though partners we have been<br>
  In all rascality, yet we no festal day have seen.”</p>
<p>John Gilbert said he thought he saw no obstacle to hinder a<br>
  Piratical descent upon the town of Canowindra.<br>
  So into Canowindra town rode Gilbert and his men,<br>
  And all the Canowindra folk subsided there and then.</p>
<p>The Canowindra populace cried, “Here’s a lot of strangers!!!”<br>
  But immediately recovered when they found they were bushrangers.<br>
  And Johnny Gilbert said to them, “You need not be afraid.<br>
  We are only old companions whom bushrangers you have made.”</p>
<p>And Johnny Gilbert said, said he, “We’ll never hurt a hair<br>
  Of men who bravely recognise that we are just all there.”<br>
  The New South Welshmen said at once, not making any fuss,<br>
  That Johnny Gilbert, after all, was “Just but one of us.”</p>
<p>So Johnny Gilbert took the town (including public houses),<br>
  And treated all the “cockatoos” and shouted for their spouses.<br>
  And Miss O’Flanagan performed in manner quite gintailly<br>
  Upon the grand pianner for the bushranger O’Meally.</p>
<p>And every stranger passing by they took, and when they got him<br>
  They robbed him of his money and occasionally shot him.<br>
  And Johnny’s enigmatic feat admits of this solution,<br>
  That bushranging in New South Wales  is a favoured institution.</p>
<p>So Johnny Gilbert ne’er allows an anxious thought to fetch him,<br>
  For well he knows the Government don’t really want to ketch him.<br>
  And if such practices should be to New South Welshmen dear,<br>
  With not the least demurring word ought we to interfere.</p>

  ’Twas sweetened with honey bees and wax for the stringy-bark cockatoo.</p>

<p>I have come to tell you of the glorious news you’ll all be glad  to hear,<br>
  Of the pleasant alterations that are taking place this year.<br>
  So kindly pay attention, and I’ll pass the whisper round,<br>
  The squatters of their own free will this year will pay the pound.</p>
<p>For this is a year of great prosperity, that everybody knows,<br>
  We’ll take no top knots off this year, nor trim them to the toes,<br>
  But a level cut for a level pound, and the rations thrown in free.<br>
  That’s how the squatters say they’ll keep their Sovereign’s Jubilee.</p>
<p>And kind Providence  once more has sent the sweet, refreshing rains.<br>
  The trefoil and the barley grass wave high upon the plains,<br>
  The tanks all overflowing and the saltbush fresh and green,<br>
  It’s a pleasure for to ramble o’er the plains of Riverine.</p>
<p>Once more upon the rippling lake the wild swan flaps her wing.<br>
  Out in the lignum swamps once more frogs croak and crickets sing.<br>
  Once more the wild fowl, sporting midst the crab-holes, may be seen,<br>
  For prosperity is hovering o’er the plains of Riverine.</p>
<p>Yes, ’twill be a year of full and plenty for those back-block  pioneers,<br>
  Though behind each scrub and saltbush you can spot the bunny’s ears;<br>
  And although the price for scalps is not so high as it has been,<br>
  Yet the bunny snappers they will thrive on the plains of Riverine.</p>
<p>You should see the jolly teamsters how with joy their faces  beam,<br>
  As they talk about the crowfoot, carrots, crab-holes, and their team.<br>
  They tell you that this year they do intend to steer sixteen.<br>
  They’ll show the “cockies” how to plough the plains of Riverine.</p>
<p>Yes, in more respects than one it is a year of joy and glee,<br>
  And the news of our prosperity has crossed the briny sea.<br>
  Once more the Maorilander and the Tassey will be seen<br>
  Cooking johnny cakes and jimmies on the plains of Riverine.</p>
<p>They will gather like a regiment to the beating of the drum,<br>
  But it matters not to us from whence our future penmates come.<br>
  From New Zealand’s snow-clad  summits or Tasmania’s  meadows green,<br>
  We’ll always make them welcome on the plains of Riverine.</p>
<p>Down from her rocky peaks Monaro will send her champions bold;<br>
  Victoria will  send her “cockies,” too, her honour to uphold.<br>
  They’ll be here from Cunnamulla, and the rolling downs between,<br>
  For this is the real convincing ground, these plains of Riverine.</p>
<p>I have a message to deliver now, before I say farewell,<br>
  Some news which all the squatters have commissioned me to tell;<br>
  Your backs well bent, bows long and clean, that’s what they want to see,<br>
  That your tallies may do you credit in this year of Jubilee.</p>

<p>“This  year will pay the pound.”—A pound a hundred is the price for shearing sheep,  and several bitterly fought-out strikes have taken place about it.</p>
<p>“We’ll  take no topknots off this year nor trim them to the toes.”—Owing to the  amiability of the squatters and the excellence of the season, the shearers  intend to leave some of the wool on the sheep, i.e., the topknots on the head  and wool down on the legs.</p>
<p>“To  steer sixteen”—sixteen horses in the team.</p>

<p>Come&nbsp;now, ye sighing washers all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Join in my doleful lay,<br>
  Mourn for the times none can recall,<br>

  Lamenting on the days gone by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne’er to return again.</p>
<p>When  first I went a-washing sheep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year was sixty-one,<br>
  The master was a worker then,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant was a man;<br>
  But now the squatters, puffed with pride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They treat us with disdain;<br>
  Lament the days that are gone by<br>

<p>From  sixty-one to sixty-six,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bushman, stout and strong,<br>
  Would smoke his pipe and whistle his tune,<br>

  As wanton as the kangaroo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bounds across the plain.<br>

<p>Supplies  of food unstinted, good,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No squatter did withhold.<br>
  With plenty grog to cheer our hearts,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feared nor heat nor cold.<br>
  With six-and-six per man per day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sought not to complain.<br>
  Lament the days that are gone by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne’er to return again.</p>
<p>With  perfect health, a mine of wealth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our days seemed short and sweet,<br>
  On pleasure bent our evenings spent,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoyment was complete.<br>
  But now we toil from morn till night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though much against the grain,<br>
  Lamenting on the days gone by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne’er to return again.</p>
<p>I once  could boast two noble steeds,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bear me on my way,<br>
  My good revolver in my belt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never knew dismay.<br>
  But lonely now I hump my drum<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sunshine and in rain,<br>
  Lamenting on the days gone by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne’er to return again.</p>
<p>A worthy  cheque I always earned,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spent it like a lord.<br>
  My dress a prince’s form would grace.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spells I could afford.<br>
  But now in tattered rags arrayed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My limbs they ache with pain,<br>
  Lamenting on the days gone by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne’er to return again.</p>
<p>May bushmen all in unity<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combine with heart and hand,<br>
  May cursed cringing poverty<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be banished from the land.<br>
  In Queensland  may prosperity<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regal glory reign,<br>
  And washers in the time to come<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their vanished rights regain.</p>

<p>That’s&nbsp;his saddle on the tie-beam,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And them’s his spurs up there<br>
  On the wall-plate over yonder—<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You ken see they ain’t a pair.</p>
<p>For the  daddy of all the stockmen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ever come mustering here<br>
  Was killed in the flaming mulga,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-yarding a bald-faced steer.</p>
<p>They say  as he’s gone to heaven,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shook off all worldly cares<br>
  But I can’t sight Bill in a halo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up on three blinded hairs.</p>
<p>In  heaven! what next I wonder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For strike me pink and blue,<br>
  If I see whatever in thunder<br>

<p>He’d  never make one of them angels,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With faces as white as chalk,<br>
  All wool to the toes like hoggets,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wings like an eagle-hawk.</p>
<p>He  couldn’t ’arp for apples,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice had tones as jarred,<br>
  And he’d no more ear than a bald-faced steer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or calves in a branding yard.</p>
<p>He could  sit on a bucking brumbie<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a nob in an easy chair,<br>
  And chop his name with a greenhide fall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the flank of a flying steer.</p>
<p>He could  show them saints in glory<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way that a fall should drop,<br>
  But sit on a throne—not William,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless they could make it prop.</p>
<p>He  mightn’t freeze to the seraphs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or chum with the cherubim,<br>
  But if ever them seraph johnnies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get a-poking it like at him—</p>
<p>Well! if  there’s hide in heaven,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silk for to make a lash,<br>
  He’ll yard ’em all in the Jasper Lake<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blinded lightning flash.</p>
<p>If the  heavenly hosts get boxed now,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mobs most always will,<br>
  Who’ll cut ’em out like William,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or draft on a camp like Bill?</p>
<p>An  ’orseman would find it awkward<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first with a push that flew,<br>
  But blame my cats if I know what else<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They’ll find for Bill to do.</p>
<p>It’s hard  if there ain’t no cattle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And perhaps they’ll let him sleep,<br>
  And wake him up at the judgment<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To draft those goats and sheep.</p>
<p>It’s  playing it low on William,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps he’ll buckle to,<br>
  To show them high-toned seraphs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a Mulga man can do.</p>
<p>If they  saddles a big-boned angel,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a turn of speed, of course,<br>
  As can spiel like a four-year brumbie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prop like an old camp horse,</p>
<p>And puts  Bill up with a snaffle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A four or five inch spur,<br>
  And eighteen foot of greenhide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To chop the blinded fur—</p>
<p>He’ll yard them blamed Angoras<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way that it’s safe to swear<br>
  Will make them tony seraphs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit back on their thrones and stare.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To you of olden praise.<br>
  To tell of merry friends of old<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were gay and young;<br>
  How we sat and sang together<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the Old Keg of Rum.</p>
<p align="center">CHORUS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh!  the Old Keg of Rum! the Old Keg of Rum!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How we sat and sang together<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round  the Old Keg of Rum.</p>
<p>There was  I and Jack the plough-boy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jem Moore and old Tom Hines,<br>
  And poor old Tom the fiddler,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who now in glory shines;<br>
  And several more of our old chums,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shine in Kingdom Come,<br>
  We all associated round the<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we’d get our harvest fee,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then we’d have a spree.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We’d laugh, we’d chat, we’d sing;<br>
  Sometimes we’d have a little row<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some argument would bring.<br>
  And oftimes in a scrimmage, boys,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waking from a snooze,<br>
  For to give another drain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old keg would refuse.<br>
  We’d rap it with our knuckles—<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had left the Old Keg of Rum.</p>

<p>Those  happy days have passed away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve seen their pleasures fade;<br>
  And many of our good old friends<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have with old times decayed.<br>
  But still, when on my travels, boys,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I meet with an old chum,<br>
  We will sigh, in conversation,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you won’t complain.<br>

<p>Come, all you jolly natives, and I’ll relate to you<br>
  Some of my observations—adventures, too, a few.<br>
  I’ve travelled about the country for miles, full many a score,<br>
  And oft-times would have hungered, but for the cheek I bore.</p>
<p>I’ve  coasted on the Barwon—low down the Darling, too,<br>
  I’ve been on the Murrumbidgee, and out on the Paroo;<br>
  I’ve been on all the diggings, boys, from famous Ballarat;<br>
  I’ve loafed upon the Lachlan and fossicked  Lambing Flat.</p>
<p>I went up  to a squatter, and asked him for a feed,<br>
  But the knowledge of my hunger was swallowed by his greed.<br>
  He said I was a loafer and for work had no desire,<br>
  And so, to do him justice, I set his shed on fire.</p>
<p>Oh, yes,  I’ve touched the shepherd’s hut, of sugar, tea, and flour;<br>
  And a tender bit of mutton I always could devour.<br>
  I went up to a station, and there I got a job;<br>
  Plunged in the store, and hooked it, with a very tidy lob.</p>
<p>Oh, yes,  my jolly dandies, I’ve done it on the cross.<br>
  Although I carry bluey now, I’ve sweated many a horse.<br>
  I’ve helped to ease the escort of many’s the ounce of gold;<br>
  The traps have often chased me, more times than can be told.</p>
<p>Oh, yes,  the traps have chased me, been frightened of their stripes<br>
  They never could have caught me, they feared my cure for gripes.<br>
  And well they knew I carried it, which they had often seen<br>
  A-glistening in my flipper, chaps, a patent pill machine.</p>
<p>I’ve been  hunted like a panther into my mountain lair.<br>
  Anxiety and misery my grim companions there.<br>
  I’ve planted in the scrub, my boys, and fed on kangaroo,<br>
  And wound up my avocations by ten years on Cockatoo.</p>
<p>So you can understand, my boys, just from this little rhyme,<br>
  I’m a Murrumbidgee shearer, and one of the  good old time.</p>

<p>Kind&nbsp;friends, pray give attention<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this, my little song.<br>
  Some rum things I will mention,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I’ll not detain you long.<br>
  Up and down this country<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I travel, don’t you see,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! don’t you pity me.<br>
  I’m a swagman on the wallaby,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! don’t you pity me.</p>
<p>At first I started shearing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I bought a pair of shears.<br>
  On my first sheep appearing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, I cut off both its ears.<br>
  Then I nearly skinned the brute,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As clean as clean could he.<br>
  So I was kicked out of the shed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! don’t you pity me, &amp;c.</p>
<p>I started station loafing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short stages and took my ease;<br>
  So all day long till sundown<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’d camp beneath the trees.<br>
  Then I’d walk up to the station,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager to see.<br>
  “Boss, I’m hard up and I want a job,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! don’t you pity me,” &amp;c.</p>
<p>Says the overseer: “Go to the hut.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning I’ll tell you<br>
  If I’ve any work about<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can find for you to do.”<br>
  But at breakfast I cuts off enough<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For dinner, don’t you see.<br>
  And then my name is Walker.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! don’t you pity me.<br>
  I’m a swagman, &amp;c.</p>
<p>And now, my friends, I’ll say good-bye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I must go and camp.<br>
  For if the Sergeant sees me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may take me for a tramp;<br>
  But if there’s any covey here<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s got a cheque, d’ye see,<br>
  I’ll stop and help him smash it.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! don’t you pity me.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! don’t you pity me.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="SongoftheSquatter"></a>Song of the Squatter</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The subjoined is one of the “Songs of the  Squatters,” written by the Hon. Robert Lowe (afterwards Viscount Sherbrooke),  while resident in New South Wales.]</p>
<p>The commissioner&nbsp;bet me a pony—I won;<br>
  So he cut off exactly two-thirds of my run;<br>
  For he said I was making a fortune too fast,<br>
  And profit gained slower the longer would last.</p>
<p>He remarked as devouring my mutton he sat,<br>
  That I suffered my sheep to grow sadly too fat;<br>
  That they wasted waste land, did prerogative brown,<br>
  And rebelliously nibbled the droits of the Crown;—</p>
<p>That the creek that divided my station in two<br>
  Showed that Nature designed that two fees should be due.<br>
  Mr. Riddle assured me ’twas paid but for show;<br>
  But he kept it and spent it; that’s all that I know.</p>
<p>The Commissioner fined me because I forgot<br>
  To return an old ewe that was ill of the rot,<br>
  And a poor wry-necked lamb that we kept for a pet;<br>
  And he said it was treason such things to forget.</p>
<p>The Commissioner pounded my cattle because<br>
  They had mumbled the scrub with their famishing jaws<br>
  On the part of the run he had taken away;<br>
  And he sold them by auction the costs to defray.</p>
<p>The Border Police they were out all the day<br>
  To look for some thieves who had ransacked my dray;<br>
  But the thieves they continued in quiet and peace,<br>
  For they’d robbed it themselves—had the Border Police!</p>
<p>When the white thieves had left me the black thieves appeared,<br>
  My shepherds they waddied, my cattle they speared;<br>
  But for fear of my licence I said not a word,<br>
  For I knew it was gone if the Government heard.</p>
<p>The Commissioner’s bosom with anger was filled<br>
  Against me because my poor shepherd was killed;<br>
  So he straight took away the last third of my run,<br>
  And got it transferred to the name of his son.</p>
<p>The son had from Cambridge  been lately expelled,<br>
  And his licence for preaching most justly withheld!<br>
  But this is no cause, the Commissioner says,<br>
  Why he should not be fit for a licence to graze.</p>
<p>The cattle that had not been sold at the pound<br>
  He took with the run at five shillings all round;<br>
  And the sheep the blacks left me at sixpence a head—<br>
  “A very good price,” the Commissioner said.</p>
<p>The Governor told me I justly was served,<br>
  That Commissioners never from duty had swerved;<br>
  But that if I’d a fancy for any more land<br>
  For one pound an acre he’d plenty on hand.</p>
<p>I’m not very proud! I can dig in a bog,<br>
  Feed pigs or for firewood can split up a log,<br>
  Clean shoes, riddle cinders, or help to boil down—<br>
  Or whatever you please, but graze lands of the Crown.</p>

  And the poor old horse stood whisking his tail,<br>
  For there never was seen such a regular screw<br>
  As Wallabi Joe, of Bunnagaroo;<br>
  Whilst the shearers all said, as they say, of course,<br>
  That Wallabi Joe’s a fine lump of a horse;<br>
  But the stockmen said, as they laughed aside,<br>
  He’d barely do for a Sunday’s ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: Oh! poor  Wallabi Joe.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O—oh!  poor Wallabi Joe.</p>
<p>“I’m weary of galloping now,” he cried,<br>
  “I wish I were killed for my hide, my hide;<br>
  For my eyes are dim, and my back is sore,<br>
  And I feel that my legs won’t stand much more.”<br>
  Now stockman Bill, who took care of his nag,<br>
  Put under the saddle a soojee bag,<br>
  And off he rode with a whip in his hand<br>
  To look for a mob of the R.J. brand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: Oh! poor  Wallabi Joe, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Now stockman Bill camped out that night,<br>
  And he hobbled his horse in a sheltered bight;<br>
  Next day of old Joe he found not a track,<br>
  So he had to trudge home with his swag on his back.<br>
  He searched up and down every gully he knew,<br>
  But he found not a hair of his poor old screw,<br>
  And the stockmen all said as they laughed at his woe,<br>
  “Would you sell us the chance of old Wallabi Joe.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: Oh! poor  Wallabi Joe, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Now as years sped by, and as Bill grew old,<br>
  It came into his head to go poking for gold;<br>
  So away he went with a spade in his fist,<br>
  To hunt for a nugget among the schist.<br>
  One day as a gully he chanced to cross,<br>
  He came on the bones of his poor old horse;<br>
  The hobbles being jammed in a root below<br>
  Had occasioned the death of poor Wallabi Joe.</p>

<p>I’ll&nbsp;sing to you a fine new song, made by my blessed mate,<br>
  Of a fine Australian squatter who had a fine estate,<br>
  Who swore by right pre-emptive at a sanguinary rate<br>
  That by his rams, his ewes, his lambs, Australia was made great—<br>

<p>His hut around was hung with guns, whips, spurs, and boots and  shoes,<br>

  And quaffs his cup of hysouskin, the beverage old chums choose—<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a fine Australian squatter, one of the olden time.</p>
<p>And when shearing time approaches he opens hut to all,<br>
  And though ten thousand are his flocks, he featly shears them all,<br>
  Even to the scabby wanderer you’d think no good at all;<br>
  For while he fattens all the great, he boils down all the small—<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a fine old Murray squatter, one of the olden time.</p>
<p>And when his worship comes to town his agents for to see,<br>
  His wool to ship, his beasts to sell, he lives right merrily;<br>
  The club his place of residence, as becomes a bush J.P.,<br>
  He darkly hints that Thompson’s run from scab is scarcely free—<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fine old Murray settler, one of the olden time.</p>
<p>And now his fortune he has made to England straight goes he,<br>
  But finds with grief he’s not received as he had hoped to be.<br>

<p>The&nbsp;boss last night in the hut did say—<br>
  “We start to muster at break of day;<br>
  So be up first thing, and don’t be slow;<br>
  Saddle your horses and off you go.”</p>
<p align="center">CHORUS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So early in the morning, so early in the  morning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So early in the morning, before the break of day.</p>
<p>Such a night in the yard there never was seen<br>
  (The horses were fat and the grass was green);<br>
  Bursting of girths and slipping of packs<br>
  As the stockmen saddled the fastest hacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: So early  in the morning, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Across the plain we jog along<br>
  Over gully, swamp, and billabong;<br>
  We drop on a mob pretty lively, too<br>
  We round ’em up and give ’em a slue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: So early  in the morning, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Now the scrub grows thick and the cattle are wild,<br>
  A regular caution to this ’ere child—<br>
  A new chum man on an old chum horse,<br>
  Who sails through the scrub as a matter of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: So early  in the morning, &amp;c.</p>
<p>I was close up stuck in a rotten bog;<br>
  I got a buster jumping a log;<br>
  I found this scouting rather hot,<br>
  So I joined the niggers with the lot we’d got.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: So early  in the morning, &amp;c.</p>
<p>A long-haired shepherd we chanced to meet<br>
  With a water bag, billy, and dog complete;<br>
  He came too close to a knocked up steer,<br>
  Who up a sapling made him clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: So early  in the morning, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Now on every side we faintly hear<br>
  The crack of the stockwhip drawing near;<br>
  To the camp the cattle soon converge,<br>
  As from the thick scrub they emerge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: So early  in the morning, &amp;c.</p>
<p>We hastily comfort the inner man<br>
  With the warm contents of the billy can;<br>
  The beef and damper are passed about<br>
  Before we tackle the cutting out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: So early  in the morning, &amp;c.</p>
<p>We’re at it now—that bally calf<br>
  Would surely make a sick man laugh;<br>
  The silly fool can’t take a joke;<br>
  I hope some day in the drought he’ll croak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: So early  in the morning, &amp;c.</p>
<p>We’ve got ’em now—the cows and calves<br>
  (Things here are never done by halves);<br>
  Strangers, workers, and milkers, too,<br>
  Of scrubbers also not a few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: So early  in the morning, &amp;c.</p>
<p>It’s getting late, we’d better push;<br>
  ’Tis a good long way across the bush,<br>
  And the mob to drive are middling hard;<br>
  I do not think we’ll reach the yard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chorus: So early  in the morning, &amp;c.</p>

  An old and tattered cabbage-tree concealed his locks of jet;<br>
  His footsteps had a languor, his voice a husky tone;<br>
  Both man and dog were spent with toil as they slowly wandered home.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his sheep were gently feeding ’neath the rugged  mountain brow.</p>
<p>When next we met, the old blue shirt and cabbage-tree were gone;<br>
  A brand new suit of tweed and “Doctor Dod” he had put on;<br>
  Arm in arm with him was one who strove, and not in vain,<br>
  To ease his pockets of their load by drinking real champagne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw him but a moment, and he was going a  pace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouting nobbler after nobbler, with a smile upon his  face.</p>
<p>When next again I saw that man his suit of tweed was gone,<br>
  The old blue shirt and cabbage-tree once more he had put on;<br>
  Slowly he trudged along the road and took the well-known track<br>
  From the station he so lately left with a swag upon his back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw him but a moment as he was walking  by<br>

<p>There’s&nbsp;a trade you all know well—<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s bringing cattle over—<br>
  I’ll tell you all about the time<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I became a drover.<br>
  I made up my mind to try the spec,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Clarence I did wander,<br>
  And bought a mob of duffers there<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin as an overlander.</p>
<p align="center">CHORUS</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For to-night we’ll drink the health<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of  every overlander.</p>
<p>Next  morning counted the cattle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw the outfit ready to start,<br>
  Saw all the lads well mounted,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their swags put in a cart.<br>
  All kinds of men I had<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From France,  Germany, and Flanders;<br>
  Lawyers, doctors, good and bad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mob of overlanders.</p>
<p>Next  morning I set out<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the grass was green and young;<br>
  And they swore they’d break my snout<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I did not move along.<br>
  I said, “You’re very hard;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take care, don’t raise my dander,<br>
  For I’m a regular knowing card,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queensland overlander.”</p>
<p>’Tis true  we pay no license,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our run is rather large;<br>
  ’Tis not often they can catch us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they cannot make a charge.<br>
  They think we live on store beef,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no, I’m not a gander;<br>
  When a good fat stranger joins the mob,<br>
  “He’ll do,” says the overlander.</p>
<p>One day a  squatter rode up.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says he, “You’re on my run;<br>
  I’ve got two boys as witnesses.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider your stock in pound.”<br>
  I tried to coax, then bounce him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my tin I had to squander,<br>
  For he put threepence a head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mob of the overlander.</p>
<p>The  pretty girls in Brisbane<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were hanging out their duds.<br>
  I wished to have a chat with them,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So steered straight for the tubs.<br>
  Some dirty urchins saw me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon they raised my dander,<br>
  Crying, “Mother, quick! take in the clothes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here comes an overlander!”</p>
<p>In town we drain the wine cup,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And go to see the play,<br>
  And never think to be hard up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For how to pass the day.<br>
  Each has a sweetheart there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dressed out in all her grandeur—<br>
  Dark eyes and jet black flowing hair.<br>
  “She’s a plum,” says the overlander.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to Sydney once more went poor  Billy Barlow.</p>
<p>They at  last let me go, and I then did repair<br>
  For my station once more, and at length I got there;<br>
  But a few days before, the blacks, you must know,<br>
  Had spear’d all the cattle of Billy Barlow.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh  dear, lackaday, oh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a  beautiful country,” said Billy Barlow.</p>
<p>And for  nine months before no rain there had been,<br>
  So the devil a blade of grass could be seen;<br>
  And one-third of my wethers the scab they had got,<br>
  And the other two-thirds had just died of the rot.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh  dear, lackaday, oh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I  shall soon be a settler,” said Billy Barlow.</p>
<p>And the  matter to mend, now my bill was near due,<br>
  So I wrote to my friend, and just asked to renew;<br>
  He replied he was sorry he couldn’t, because<br>
  The bill had passed into a usurer’s claws.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh  dear, lackaday, oh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But  perhaps he’ll renew it,” said Billy Barlow.</p>
<p>I  applied; to renew he was quite content,<br>
  If secured, and allowed just three hundred per cent.;<br>
  But as I couldn’t do, Barr, Rodgers, and Co.<br>
  Soon sent up a summons for Billy Barlow.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh  dear, lackaday, oh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They  soon settled the business of Billy Barlow.</p>
<p>For a  month or six weeks I stewed over my loss,<br>
  And a tall man rode up one day on a black horse;<br>
  He asked, “Don’t you know me?” I answered him “No.”<br>
  “Why,” said he, “my name’s Kinsmill; how are you, Barlow?”<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh  dear, lackaday, oh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’d  got a&nbsp;<i>fi. fa.</i>&nbsp;for poor Billy Barlow.</p>
<p>What I’d  left of my sheep and my traps he did seize,<br>
  And he said, “They won’t pay all the costs and my fees;”<br>
  Then he sold off the lot, and I’m sure ’twas a sin,<br>
  At sixpence a head, and the station giv’n in.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh  dear, lackaday, oh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ll  go back to England,”  said Billy Barlow.</p>
<p>My sheep  being sold, and my money all gone,<br>
  Oh, I wandered about then quite sad and forlorn;<br>
  How I managed to live it would shock you to know,<br>
  And as thin as a lath got poor Billy Barlow.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh  dear, lackaday, oh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite  down on his luck was poor Billy Barlow.</p>
<p>And in a  few weeks more, the sheriff, you see,<br>
  Sent the tall man on horseback once more unto me;<br>
  Having got all he could by the writ of&nbsp;<i>fi. fa.</i>,<br>
  By way of a change he’d brought up a&nbsp;<i>ca. sa.</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh  dear, lackaday, oh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  seized on the body of Billy Barlow.</p>
<p>He took  me to Sydney,  and there they did lock<br>
  Poor unfortunate Billy fast “under the clock;”<br>
  And to get myself out I was forced, you must know<br>
  The schedule to file of poor Billy Barlow.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh  dear, lackaday, oh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the  list of insolvents was Billy Barlow.</p>
<p>Then once more I got free, but in poverty’s toil;<br>
  I’ve no “cattle for salting,” no “sheep for to boil;”<br>
  I can’t get a job—though to any I’d stoop,<br>
  If it was only the making of portable soup.”<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh  dear, lackaday, oh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray  give some employment to Billy Barlow.</p>
