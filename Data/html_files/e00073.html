  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Preface"></a>Preface</b></h2>
  <p><i>It is not so easy to write ballads descriptive  of the bushland of Australia  as on light consideration would appear. Reasonably good verse on the subject  has been supplied in sufficient quantity. But the maker of folksongs for our  newborn nation requires a somewhat rare combination of gifts and experiences.  Dowered with the poet&rsquo;s heart, he must yet have passed his &lsquo;wander-j&auml;hre&rsquo; amid  the stern solitude of the Austral waste &mdash; must have ridden the race in the  back-block township, guided the reckless stock-horse adown the mountain spur,  and followed the night-long moving, spectral-seeming herd &lsquo;in the droving  days&rsquo;. Amid such scarce congenial surroundings comes oft that finer sense which  renders visible bright gleams of humour, pathos, and romance, which, like  undiscovered gold, await the fortunate adventurer. That the author has touched  this treasure-trove, not less delicately than distinctly, no true Australian  will deny. In my opinion this collection comprises the best bush ballads  written since the death of&nbsp;Lindsay Gordon.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolf  Boldrewood&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><i>A number of these verses are now published  for the first time, most of the others were written for and appeared in &ldquo;The  Bulletin&rdquo; (Sydney, N.S.W.), and are therefore already widely known to readers  in Australasia.<br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Prelude"></a>Prelude</b></h2>
<p>I&nbsp;have  gathered these stories afar,<br>
  In the wind and the rain,<br>
  In the land where the cattle camps are,<br>
  On the edge of the plain.<br>
  On the overland routes of the west,<br>
  When the watches were long,<br>
  I have fashioned in earnest and jest<br>
  These fragments of song.</p>
<p>They  are just the rude stories one hears<br>
  In sadness and mirth,<br>
  The records of wandering years,<br>
  And scant is their worth<br>
  Though their merits indeed are but slight,<br>
  &nbsp;I shall not repine,<br>
  If they give you one moment's delight,<br>
  Old comrades of mine.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheManfromSnowyRiver"></a>The Man from Snowy River</h2>
<p>There&nbsp;was movement at the station, for the  word had passed around<br>
  That the colt from old Regret had got away,<br>
  And had joined the wild bush horses &mdash; he was worth a thousand pound,<br>
  So all the cracks had gathered to the fray.<br>
  All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far<br>
  Had mustered at the homestead overnight,<br>
  For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,<br>
  And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight.</p>
<p>There was Harrison, who made his pile when  Pardon won the cup,<br>
  The old man with his hair as white as snow;<br>
  But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up&mdash;<br>
  He would go wherever horse and man could go.<br>
  And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,<br>
  No better horseman ever held the reins;<br>
  For never horse could throw him while the saddle-girths would stand,<br>
  He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.</p>
<p>And one was there, a stripling on a small  and weedy beast,<br>
  He was something like a racehorse undersized,<br>
  With a touch of Timor pony&mdash;three parts  thoroughbred at least&mdash;<br>
  And such as are by mountain horsemen prized.<br>
  He was hard and tough and wiry&mdash;just the sort that won&rsquo;t say die&mdash;<br>
  There was courage in his quick impatient tread;<br>
  And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,<br>
  And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.</p>
<p>But still so slight and weedy, one would  doubt his power to stay,<br>
  And the old man said, &ldquo;That horse will never do<br>
  For a long and tiring gallop&mdash;lad, you&rsquo;d better stop away,<br>
  Those hills are far too rough for such as you.&rdquo;<br>
  So he waited sad and wistful&mdash;only Clancy stood his friend &mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;I think we ought to let him come,&rdquo; he said;<br>
  &ldquo;I warrant he&rsquo;ll be with us when he&rsquo;s wanted at the end,<br>
  For both his horse and he are mountain bred.</p>
<p>He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko&rsquo;s  side,<br>
  Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough,<br>
  Where a horse&rsquo;s hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride,<br>
  The man that holds his own is good enough.<br>
  And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their  home,<br>
  Where the river runs those giant hills between;<br>
  I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,<br>
  But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went &mdash; they found the horses by the  big mimosa clump &mdash;<br>
  They raced away towards the mountain&rsquo;s brow,<br>
  And the old man gave his orders, &ldquo;Boys, go at them from the jump,<br>
  No use to try for fancy riding now.<br>
  And, Clancy, you must wheel them, try and wheel them to the right.<br>
  Ride boldly, lad, and never fear the spills,<br>
  For never yet was rider that could keep the mob in sight,<br>
  If once they gain the shelter of those hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Clancy rode to wheel them&mdash;he was racing  on the wing<br>
  Where the best and boldest riders take their place,<br>
  And he raced his stock-horse past them, and he made the ranges ring<br>
  With the stockwhip, as he met them face to face.<br>
  Then they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash,<br>
  But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view,<br>
  And they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash,<br>
  And off into the mountain scrub they flew.</p>
<p>Then fast the horsemen followed, where the  gorges deep and black<br>
  Resounded to the thunder of their tread,<br>
  And the stockwhips woke the echoes, and they fiercely answered back<br>
  From cliffs and crags that beetled overhead.<br>
  And upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their way,<br>
  Where mountain ash and kurrajong grew wide;<br>
  And the old man muttered fiercely, &ldquo;We may bid the mob good day,<br>
  <i>No</i>&nbsp;man can hold them down the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the mountain&rsquo;s summit,  even Clancy took a pull,<br>
  It well might make the boldest hold their breath,<br>
  The wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full<br>
  Of wombat holes, and any slip was death.<br>
  But the man from Snowy   River let the pony have  his head,<br>
  And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer,<br>
  And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed,<br>
  While the others stood and watched in very fear.</p>
<p>He sent the flint stones flying, but the  pony kept his feet,<br>
  He cleared the fallen timber in his stride,<br>
  And the man from Snowy   River never shifted in  his seat&mdash;<br>
  It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride.<br>
  Through the stringy barks and saplings, on the rough and broken ground,<br>
  Down the hillside at a racing pace he went;<br>
  And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound,<br>
  At the bottom of that terrible descent.</p>
<p>He was right among the horses as they  climbed the further hill,<br>
  And the watchers on the mountain standing mute,<br>
  Saw him ply the stockwhip fiercely, he was right among them still,<br>
  As he raced across the clearing in pursuit.<br>
  Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met<br>
  In the ranges, but a final glimpse reveals<br>
  On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet,<br>
  With the man from Snowy   River at their heels.</p>
<p>And he ran them single-handed till their  sides were white with foam.<br>
  He followed like a bloodhound on their track,<br>
  Till they halted cowed and beaten, then he turned their heads for home,<br>
  And alone and unassisted brought them back.<br>
  But his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot,<br>
  He was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur;<br>
  But his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot,<br>
  For never yet was mountain horse a cur.</p>
<p>And down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad  ridges raise<br>
  Their torn and rugged battlements on high,<br>
  Where the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze<br>
  At midnight in the cold and frosty sky,<br>
  And where around the Overflow the reedbeds sweep and sway<br>
  To the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide,<br>
  The man from Snowy River is a household word to-day,<br>
  And the stockmen tell the story of his ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="OldPardontheSonofReprieve"></a>Old Pardon, the Son of Reprieve</h2>
<p>You&nbsp;never heard tell  of the story?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now, I can  hardly believe!<br>
  Never heard of the honour and glory<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Pardon, the son of  Reprieve?<br>
  But maybe you&rsquo;re only a Johnnie<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And don&rsquo;t know a horse  from a hoe?<br>
  Well, well, don&rsquo;t get angry, my sonny,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, really, a young &rsquo;un  should know. </p>
<p>They bred him out back on the &lsquo;Never&rsquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother was Mameluke breed.<br>
  To the front&mdash;and then stay there&mdash;was ever<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root of the Mameluke creed.<br>
  He seemed to inherit their wiry<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong frames&mdash;and their pluck to receive&mdash;<br>
  As hard as a flint and as fiery<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Pardon, the son of Reprieve.</p>
<p>We ran him at many a meeting<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At crossing and gully and town,<br>
  And nothing could give him a beating&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least when our money was down.<br>
  For weight wouldn&rsquo;t stop him, nor distance,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor odds, though the others were fast,<br>
  He&rsquo;d race with a dogged persistence,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wear them all down at the last.</p>
<p>At the Turon the Yattendon filly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led by lengths at the mile-and-a-half,<br>
  And we all began to look silly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While <i>her</i> crowd were starting to laugh;<br>
  But the old horse came faster and faster,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pluck told its tale, and his strength,<br>
  He gained on her, caught her, and passed her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And won it, hands-down, by a length.</p>
<p>And then we swooped down on Menindie<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run for the President&rsquo;s Cup&mdash;<br>
  Oh! that&rsquo;s a sweet township&mdash;a shindy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To them is board, lodging, and sup.<br>
  Eye-openers they are, and their system<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is never to suffer defeat;<br>
  It&rsquo;s &ldquo;win, tie, or wrangle&rdquo;&mdash;to best &rsquo;em<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must lose &rsquo;em, or else it&rsquo;s &lsquo;dead heat&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We strolled down the township and found  &rsquo;em<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At drinking and gaming and play;<br>
  If sorrows they had, why they drowned &rsquo;em,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And betting was soon under way.<br>
  Their horses were good &rsquo;uns and fit &rsquo;uns,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was plenty of cash in the town;<br>
  They backed their own horses like Britons,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Lord! how&nbsp;<i>we</i>&nbsp;rattled it down!</p>
<p>With gladness we thought of the morrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We counted our wagers with glee,<br>
  A simile homely to borrow&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;There was plenty of milk in our tea.&rsquo;<br>
  You see we were green; and we never<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had even a thought of foul play,<br>
  Though we well might have known that the clever<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Division would &ldquo;put us away&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Experience&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>docet</i>,&rsquo; they tell  us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least so I&rsquo;ve frequently heard,<br>
  But, &lsquo;dosing&rsquo; or &lsquo;stuffing&rsquo;, those fellows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were up to each move on the board:<br>
  They got to his stall&mdash;it is sinful<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think what such villains would do&mdash;<br>
  And they gave him a regular skinful<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of barley&mdash;green barley&mdash;to chew.</p>
<p>He munched it all night, and we found him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next morning as full as a hog&mdash;<br>
  The girths wouldn&rsquo;t nearly meet round him;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked like an overfed frog.<br>
  We saw we were done like a dinner&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The odds were a thousand to one<br>
  Against Pardon turning up winner,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas cruel to ask him to run.</p>
<p>We got to the course with our troubles,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crestfallen couple were we;<br>
  And we heard the &lsquo;books&rsquo; calling the doubles&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A roar like the surf of the sea;<br>
  And over the tumult and louder<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang &ldquo;Any price Pardon, I lay!&rdquo;<br>
  Says Jimmy, &ldquo;The children of Judah<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are out on the warpath to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three miles in three heats:&mdash;Ah, my sonny,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horses in those days were stout,<br>
  They had to run well to win money;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t see such horses about.<br>
  Your six-furlong vermin that scamper<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-a-mile with their feather-weight up;<br>
  They wouldn&rsquo;t earn much of their damper<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a race like the President&rsquo;s Cup.</p>
<p>The first heat was soon set a-going;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dancer went off to the front;<br>
  The Don on his quarters was showing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Pardon right out of the hunt.<br>
  He rolled and he weltered and wallowed&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;d kick your hat faster, I&rsquo;ll bet;<br>
  They finished all bunched, and he followed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All lathered and dripping with sweat.</p>
<p>But troubles came thicker upon us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For while we were rubbing him dry<br>
  The stewards came over to warn us:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We hear you are running a bye!<br>
  If Pardon don&rsquo;t spiel like tarnation<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And win the next heat&mdash;if he can&mdash;<br>
  He&rsquo;ll earn a disqualification;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just think over&nbsp;<i>that</i>, now, my man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our money all gone and our credit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our horse couldn&rsquo;t gallop a yard;<br>
  And then people thought that&nbsp;<i>we</i>&nbsp;did it!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really was terribly hard.<br>
  We were objects of mirth and derision<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To folk in the lawn and the stand,<br>
  And the yells of the clever division<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of &ldquo;Any price Pardon!&rdquo; were grand.</p>
<p>We still had a chance for the money,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two heats still remained to be run;<br>
  If both fell to us&mdash;why, my sonny,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clever division were done.<br>
  And Pardon was better, we reckoned,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sickness was passing away,<br>
  So he went to the post for the second<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And principal heat of the day.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re off and away with a rattle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like dogs from the leashes let slip,<br>
  And right at the back of the battle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed them under the whip.<br>
  They gained ten good lengths on him quickly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dropped right away from the pack;<br>
  I tell you it made me feel sickly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the blue jacket fall back.</p>
<p>Our very last hope had departed&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thought the old fellow was done,<br>
  When all of a sudden he started<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go like a shot from a gun.<br>
  His chances seemed slight to embolden<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts; but, with teeth firmly set,<br>
  We thought, &ldquo;Now or never! The old &rsquo;un<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May reckon with some of &rsquo;em yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then loud rose the war-cry for Pardon;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swept like the wind down the dip,<br>
  And over the rise by the garden,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jockey was done with the whip<br>
  The field were at sixes and sevens&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace at the first had been fast&mdash;<br>
  And hope seemed to drop from the heavens,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Pardon was coming at last.</p>
<p>And how he did come! It was splendid;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gained on them yards every bound,<br>
  Stretching out like a greyhound extended,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His girth laid right down on the ground.<br>
  A shimmer of silk in the cedars<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As into the running they wheeled,<br>
  And out flashed the whips on the leaders,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Pardon had collared the field.</p>
<p>Then right through the ruck he came  sailing&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew that the battle was won&mdash;<br>
  The son of Haphazard was failing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yattendon filly was done;<br>
  He cut down the Don and the Dancer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raced clean away from the mare&mdash;<br>
  He&rsquo;s in front! Catch him now if you can, sir!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And up went my hat in the air!</p>
<p>Then loud from the lawn and the garden<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose offers of &ldquo;Ten to one&nbsp;<i>on</i>!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll bet on the field? I back Pardon!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No use; all the money was gone.<br>
  He came for the third heat light-hearted,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-jumping and dancing about;<br>
  The others were done ere they started<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crestfallen, and tired, and worn out.</p>
<p>He won it, and ran it much faster<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than even the first, I believe<br>
  Oh, he was the daddy, the master,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Pardon, the son of Reprieve.<br>
  He showed &rsquo;em the method to travel&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy sat as still as a stone&mdash;<br>
  They never could see him for gravel;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came in hard-held, and alone.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * *</b> </p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s old&mdash;and his eyes are grown  hollow;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like me, with my thatch of the snow;<br>
  When he dies, then I hope I may follow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And go where the racehorses go.<br>
  I don&rsquo;t want no harping nor singing&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such things with my style don&rsquo;t agree;<br>
  Where the hoofs of the horses are ringing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s music sufficient for me.</p>
<p>And surely the thoroughbred horses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will rise up again and begin<br>
  Fresh races on far-away courses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And p&rsquo;raps they might let me slip in.<br>
  It would look rather well the race-card on<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Mongst Cherubs and Seraphs and things,<br>
  &ldquo;Angel Harrison&rsquo;s black gelding Pardon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue halo, white body and wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if they have racing hereafter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And who is to say they will not?)<br>
  When the cheers and the shouting and laughter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proclaim that the battle grows hot;<br>
  As they come down the racecourse a-steering,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll rush to the front, I believe;<br>
  And you&rsquo;ll hear the great multitude cheering<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Pardon, the son of Reprieve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ClancyoftheOverflow"></a>Clancy of the Overflow</h2>
<p>I&nbsp;had&nbsp;written him a  letter which I had, for want of better<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge, sent to  where I met him down the Lachlan, years ago,<br>
  He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the  letter to him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Just on &ldquo;spec,&rdquo; addressed as  follows, &ldquo;Clancy, of The Overflow&rdquo;. </p>
<p>And an answer came directed in a writing  unexpected,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail  dipped in tar)<br>
  &rsquo;Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and&nbsp;<i>verbatim</i>&nbsp;I will  quote it:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Clancy&rsquo;s gone to Queensland droving, and we don&rsquo;t know where  he are.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>In my wild erratic fancy visions come to  me of Clancy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone a-droving &ldquo;down the Cooper&rdquo; where the Western  drovers go;<br>
  As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the drover&rsquo;s life has pleasures that the townsfolk  never know.</p>
<p>And the bush hath friends to meet him, and  their kindly voices greet him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,<br>
  And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at night the wond&rsquo;rous glory of the everlasting  stars.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>I am sitting in my dingy little office,  where a stingy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the  houses tall,<br>
  And the f&oelig;tid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the open window floating, spreads its foulness  over all.</p>
<p>And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear  the fiendish rattle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the tramways and the &rsquo;buses making hurry down the  street,<br>
  And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp  of feet.</p>
<p>And the hurrying people daunt me, and  their pallid faces haunt me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous  haste,<br>
  With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time  to waste.</p>
<p>And I somehow rather fancy that I&rsquo;d like  to change with Clancy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come  and go,<br>
  While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I doubt he&rsquo;d suit the office, Clancy, of &ldquo;The  Overflow.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ConroysGap"></a>Conroy&rsquo;s Gap</h2>
<p>This&nbsp;was the way of  it, don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan was &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; for  stealing sheep,<br>
  And never a trooper, high or low,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could find him&mdash;catch a  weasel asleep!<br>
  Till Trooper Scott, from the Stockman&rsquo;s Ford&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bushman, too, as  I&rsquo;ve heard them tell&mdash;<br>
  Chanced to find him drunk as a lord<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round at the Shadow of  Death Hotel. </p>
<p>D&rsquo;you know the place? It&rsquo;s a wayside inn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A low grog-shanty&mdash;a bushman trap,<br>
  Hiding away in its shame and sin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the shelter of Conroy&rsquo;s Gap&mdash;<br>
  Under the shade of that frowning range,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roughest crowd that ever drew breath&mdash;<br>
  Thieves and rowdies, uncouth and strange,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were mustered round at the &ldquo;=Shadow of Death.</p>
<p>The trooper knew that his man would slide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a dingo pup, if he saw the chance;<br>
  And with half a start on the mountain side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan would lead him a merry dance.<br>
  Drunk as he was when the trooper came,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him that did not matter a rap&mdash;<br>
  Drunk or sober, he was the same,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boldest rider in Conroy&rsquo;s Gap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you, Ryan,&rdquo; the trooper said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And listen to me, if you dare resist,<br>
  So help me heaven, I&rsquo;ll shoot you dead!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snapped the steel on his prisoner&rsquo;s wrist,<br>
  And Ryan, hearing the handcuffs click,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovered his wits as they turned to go,<br>
  For fright will sober a man as quick<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all the drugs that the doctors know.</p>
<p>There was a girl in that rough bar<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went by the name of Kate Carew,<br>
  Quiet and shy as the bush girls are,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ready-witted and plucky, too.<br>
  She loved this Ryan, or so they say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passing by, while her eyes were dim<br>
  With tears, she said in a careless way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The Swagman&rsquo;s round in the stable, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spoken too low for the trooper&rsquo;s ear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should she care if he heard or not?<br>
  Plenty of swagmen far and near,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet to Ryan it meant a lot.<br>
  That was the name of the grandest horse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the district from east to west<br>
  In every show ring, on every course<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They always counted the Swagman best.</p>
<p>He was a wonder, a raking bay&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the grand old Snowdon  strain&mdash;<br>
  One of the sort that could race and stay<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mighty limbs and his length of rein.<br>
  Born and bred on the mountain side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could race through scrub like a kangaroo,<br>
  The girl herself on his back might ride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Swagman would carry her safely through.</p>
<p>He would travel gaily from daylight&rsquo;s  flush<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till after the stars hung out their lamps,<br>
  There was never his like in the open bush,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never his match on the cattle-camps.<br>
  For faster horses might well be found<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On racing tracks, or a plain&rsquo;s extent,<br>
  But few, if any, on broken ground<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could see the way that the Swagman went.</p>
<p>When this girl&rsquo;s father, old Jim Carew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was droving out on the Castlereagh<br>
  With Conroy&rsquo;s cattle, a wire came through<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that his wife couldn&rsquo;t live the day.<br>
  And he was a hundred miles from home,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As flies the crow, with never a track,<br>
  Through plains as pathless as ocean&rsquo;s foam,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mounted straight on the Swagman&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>He left the camp by the sundown light,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the settlers out on the Marthaguy<br>
  Awoke and heard, in the dead of night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single horseman hurrying by.<br>
  He crossed the Bogan at Dandaloo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a mile of the silent plain<br>
  That lonely rider behind him threw<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they settled to sleep again.</p>
<p>He rode all night and he steered his  course<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shining stars with a bushman&rsquo;s skill,<br>
  And every time that he pressed his horse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swagman answered him gamely still.<br>
  He neared his home as the east was bright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor met him outside the town:<br>
  &ldquo;Carew! How far did you come last night?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A hundred miles since the sun went down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And his wife got round, and an oath he  passed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as he or one of his breed<br>
  Could raise a coin, though it took their last<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swagman never should want a feed.<br>
  And Kate Carew, when her father died,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kept the horse and she kept him well:<br>
  The pride of the district far and wide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lived in style at the bush hotel.</p>
<p>Such was the Swagman; and Ryan knew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing about could pace the crack;<br>
  Little he&rsquo;d care for the man in blue<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If once he got on the Swagman&rsquo;s back.<br>
  But how to do it? A word let fall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave him the hint as the girl passed by;<br>
  Nothing but &ldquo;Swagman&mdash;stable-wall;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Go to the stable and mind your eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught her meaning, and quickly turned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the trooper: &ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;ll gain a stripe<br>
  By arresting me, and it&rsquo;s easily earned;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s go to the stable and get my pipe,<br>
  The Swagman has it.&rdquo; So off they went,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon as ever they turned their backs<br>
  The girl slipped down, on some errand bent<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the stable, and seized an axe.</p>
<p>The trooper stood at the stable door<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Ryan went in quite cool and slow,<br>
  And then (the trick had been played before)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl outside gave the wall a blow.<br>
  Three slabs fell out of the stable wall&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas done &rsquo;fore ever the trooper knew&mdash;<br>
  And Ryan, as soon as he saw them fall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mounted the Swagman and rushed him through.</p>
<p>The trooper heard the hoof-beats ring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stable yard, and he slammed the gate,<br>
  But the Swagman rose with a mighty spring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fence, and the trooper fired too late,<br>
  As they raced away and his shots flew wide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ryan no longer need care a rap,<br>
  For never a horse that was lapped in hide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could catch the Swagman in Conroy&rsquo;s Gap.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the story. You want to know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ryan came back to his Kate Carew;<br>
  Of course he should have, as stories go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the worst of it is, this story&rsquo;s true:<br>
  And in real life it&rsquo;s a certain rule,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever poets and authors say<br>
  Of high-toned robbers and all their school,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These horsethief fellows aren&rsquo;t built that way.</p>
<p>Come back! Don&rsquo;t hope it&mdash;the slinking  hound,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sloped across to the Queensland side,<br>
  And sold the Swagman for fifty pound,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stole the money, and more beside.<br>
  And took to drink, and by some good chance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was killed&mdash;thrown out of a stolen trap.<br>
  And that was the end of this small romance,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the story of Conroy&rsquo;s Gap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="OurNewHorse"></a>Our New Horse</h2>
<p>The boys&nbsp;had come back  from the races<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All silent and down on  their luck;<br>
  They&rsquo;d backed &rsquo;em, straight out and for  places,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never a winner  they struck.<br>
  They lost their good money on Slogan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fell, most  uncommonly flat,<br>
  When Partner, the pride of the Bogan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was beaten by  Aristocrat. </p>
<p>And one said, &ldquo;I move that instanter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sell out our horses and quit,<br>
  The brutes ought to win in a canter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such trials they do when they&rsquo;re fit.<br>
  The last one they ran was a snorter&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gallop to gladden one&rsquo;s heart&mdash;<br>
  Two-twelve for a mile and a quarter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finished as straight as a dart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then when I think that they&rsquo;re ready<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win me a nice little swag,<br>
  They are licked like the veriest neddy&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re licked from the fall of the flag.<br>
  The mare held her own to the stable,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She died out to nothing at that,<br>
  And Partner he never seemed able<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pace it with Aristocrat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And times have been bad, and the seasons<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t promise to be of the best;<br>
  In short, boys, there&rsquo;s plenty of reasons<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For giving the racing a rest.<br>
  The mare can be kept on the station&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her breeding is good as can be&mdash;<br>
  But Partner, his next destination<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is rather a trouble to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t sell him here, for they know him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as the clerk of the course;<br>
  He&rsquo;s raced and won races till, blow him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s done as a handicap horse.<br>
  A jady, uncertain performer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They weight him right out of the hunt,<br>
  And clap it on warmer and warmer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever he gets near the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use to paint him or dot him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or put any &lsquo;fake&rsquo; on his brand,<br>
  For bushmen are smart, and they&rsquo;d spot him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any sale-yard in the land.<br>
  The folk about here could all tell him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could swear to each separate hair;<br>
  Let us send him to Sydney  and sell him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s plenty of Jugginses there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call him a maiden, and treat &rsquo;em<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To trials will open their eyes,<br>
  We&rsquo;ll run their best horses and beat &rsquo;em,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then won&rsquo;t they think him a prize.<br>
  I pity the fellow that buys him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll find in a very short space,<br>
  No matter how highly he tries him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beggar won&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>race</i>&nbsp;in a race.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>Next week, under &ldquo;Seller and Buyer&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeared in the&nbsp;<i>Daily Gazette</i>:<br>
  &ldquo;A racehorse for sale, and a flyer;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has never been started as yet,<br>
  A trial will show what his pace is;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buyer can get him in light,<br>
  And win all the handicap races.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply here before Wednesday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sold for a hundred and thirty,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of a gallop he had<br>
  One morning with Bluefish and Bertie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And donkey-licked both of &rsquo;em bad.<br>
  And when the old horse had departed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life on the station grew tame;<br>
  The race-track was dull and deserted,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys had gone back on the game.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>The winter rolled by, and the station<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was green with the garland of spring<br>
  A spirit of glad exultation<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awoke in each animate thing.<br>
  And all the old love, the old longing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke out in the breasts of the boys,<br>
  The visions of racing came thronging<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its delirious joys.</p>
<p>The rushing of floods in their courses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rattle of rain on the roofs<br>
  Recalled the fierce rush of the horses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder of galloping hoofs.<br>
  And soon one broke out: &ldquo;I can suffer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer the life of a slug,<br>
  The man that don&rsquo;t race is a duffer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s have one more run for the mug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why, <i>everything</i> races, no matter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever its method may be:<br>
  The waterfowl hold a regatta;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &rsquo;possums run heats up a tree;<br>
  The emus are constantly sprinting<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A handicap out on the plain;<br>
  It seems like all nature was hinting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis time to be at it again.</p>
<p>The cockatoo parrots are talking<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of races to far away lands;<br>
  The native companions are walking<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A go-as-you-please on the sands;<br>
  The little foals gallop for pastime;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wallabies race down the gap;<br>
  Let&rsquo;s try it once more for the last time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring out the old jacket and cap.</p>
<p>And now for a horse; we might try one<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those that are bred on the place,<br>
  But I think it better to buy one,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A horse that has proved he can race.<br>
  Let us send down to Sydney  to Skinner,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thorough good judge who can ride,<br>
  And ask him to buy us a spinner<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clean out the whole countryside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They wrote him a letter as follows:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We want you to buy us a horse;<br>
  He must have the speed to catch swallows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stamina with it of course.<br>
  The price ain&rsquo;t a thing that&rsquo;ll grieve us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s getting a bad &rsquo;un annoys<br>
  The undersigned blokes, and believe us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;re yours to a cinder, &lsquo;the boys&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bought you a hummer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A horse that has never been raced;<br>
  I saw him run over the Drummer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held him outclassed and outpaced.<br>
  His breeding&rsquo;s not known, but they state he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is born of a thoroughbred strain,<br>
  I paid them a hundred and eighty,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And started the horse in the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They met him&mdash;alas, that these verses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aren&rsquo;t up to the subject&rsquo;s demands&mdash;<br>
  Can&rsquo;t set forth their eloquent curses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>For Partner was back on their hands</i>.<br>
  They went in to meet him in gladness,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They opened his box with delight&mdash;<br>
  A silent procession of sadness<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They crept to the station at night.</p>
<p>And life has grown dull on the station,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boys are all silent and slow;<br>
  Their work is a daily vexation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sport is unknown to them now.<br>
  Whenever they think how they stranded,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They squeal just like guinea-pigs squeal;<br>
  They bit their own hook, and were landed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fifty pounds loss on the deal.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="AnIdyllofDandaloo"></a>An Idyll of Dandaloo</h2>
<p>On&nbsp;Western plains,  where shade is not,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Neath summer skies of  cloudless blue,<br>
  Where all is dry and all is hot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stands the town  of Dandaloo&mdash;<br>
  A township where life&rsquo;s total sum<br>
  Is sleep, diversified with rum. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s grass-grown streets with dust are  deep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twere vain endeavour to express<br>
  The dreamless silence of its sleep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its wide, expansive drunkenness.<br>
  The yearly races mostly drew<br>
  A lively crowd to Dandaloo.</p>
<p>There came a sportsman from the East,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eastern land where sportsmen blow,<br>
  And brought with him a speedy beast&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A speedy beast as horses go.<br>
  He came afar in hope to &ldquo;do&rdquo;<br>
  The little town of Dandaloo.</p>
<p>Now this was weak of him, I wot&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceeding weak, it seemed to me&mdash;<br>
  For we in Dandaloo were not<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jugginses we seemed to be;<br>
  In fact, we rather thought we knew<br>
  Our book by heart in Dandaloo.</p>
<p>We held a meeting at the bar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And met the question fair and square&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve stumped the country near and far<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise the cash for races here;<br>
  We&rsquo;ve got a hundred pounds or two&mdash;<br>
  Not half so bad for Dandaloo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, it seems, we have to be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleaned out by this here Sydney bloke,<br>
  With his imported horse; and he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will scoop the pool and leave us broke<br>
  Shall we sit still, and make no fuss<br>
  While this chap climbs all over us?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>The races came to Dandaloo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the cornstalks from the West,<br>
  On ev&rsquo;ry kind of moke and screw,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came forth in all their glory drest.<br>
  The stranger&rsquo;s horse, as hard as nails,<br>
  Look&rsquo;d fit to run for New South Wales.</p>
<p>He won the race by half a length&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Quite</i>&nbsp;half a length, it seemed to me&mdash;<br>
  But Dandaloo, with all its strength,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roared out &ldquo;Dead heat!&rdquo; most fervently;<br>
  And, after hesitation meet,<br>
  The judge&rsquo;s verdict was &ldquo;Dead heat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And many men there were could tell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What gave the verdict extra force:<br>
  The stewards, and the judge as well&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all had backed the second horse.<br>
  For things like this they sometimes do<br>
  In larger towns than Dandaloo.</p>
<p>They ran it off; the stranger won,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands down, by near a hundred yards<br>
  He smiled to think his troubles done;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dandaloo held all the cards.<br>
  They went to scale and&mdash;cruel fate!&mdash;<br>
  His jockey turned out under-weight.</p>
<p>Perhaps they&rsquo;d tampered with the scale!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot tell. I only know<br>
  It weighed him <i>out</i> all right. I fail<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To paint that Sydney  sportsman&rsquo;s woe.<br>
  He said the stewards were a crew<br>
  Of low-lived thieves in Dandaloo.</p>
<p>He lifted up his voice, irate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swore till all the air was blue;<br>
  So then we rose to vindicate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dignity of Dandaloo.<br>
  &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said we, &ldquo;you must not poke<br>
  Such oaths at us poor country folk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We rode him softly on a rail,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shied at him, in careless glee,<br>
  Some large tomatoes, rank and stale,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eggs of great antiquity&mdash;<br>
  Their wild, unholy fragrance flew<br>
  About the town of Dandaloo.</p>
<p>He left the town at break of day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He led his race-horse through the streets,<br>
  And now he tells the tale, they say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To every racing man he meets.<br>
  And Sydney  sportsmen all eschew<br>
  The atmosphere of Dandaloo.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheGeebungPoloClub"></a>The Geebung Polo Club</h2>
<p>It&nbsp;was somewhere up  the country, in a land of rock and scrub,<br>
  That they formed an institution called the  Geebung Polo Club.<br>
  They were long and wiry natives from the  rugged mountain side,<br>
  And the horse was never saddled that the  Geebungs couldn&rsquo;t ride;<br>
  But their style of playing polo was irregular  and rash&mdash;<br>
  They had mighty little science, but a mighty  lot of dash:<br>
  And they played on mountain ponies that were  muscular and strong,<br>
  Though their coats were quite unpolished, and  their manes and tails were long.<br>
  And they used to train those ponies wheeling  cattle in the scrub:<br>
  They were demons, were the members of the  Geebung Polo Club. </p>
<p>It was somewhere down the country, in a  city&rsquo;s smoke and steam,<br>
  That a polo club existed, called &ldquo;The Cuff and Collar Team&rdquo;.<br>
  As a social institution &rsquo;twas a marvellous success,<br>
  For the members were distinguished by exclusiveness and dress.<br>
  They had natty little ponies that were nice, and smooth, and sleek,<br>
  For their cultivated owners only rode &rsquo;em once a week.<br>
  So they started up the country in pursuit of sport and fame,<br>
  For they meant to show the Geebungs how they ought to play the game;<br>
  And they took their valets with them&mdash;just to give their boots a rub<br>
  Ere they started operations on the Geebung Polo Club.</p>
<p>Now my readers can imagine how the contest  ebbed and flowed,<br>
  When the Geebung boys got going it was time to clear the road;<br>
  And the game was so terrific that ere half the time was gone<br>
  A spectator&rsquo;s leg was broken&mdash;just from merely looking on.<br>
  For they waddied one another till the plain was strewn with dead,<br>
  While the score was kept so even that they neither got ahead.<br>
  And the Cuff and Collar Captain, when he tumbled off to die,<br>
  Was the last surviving player&mdash;so the game was called a tie.</p>
<p>Then the Captain of the Geebungs raised  him slowly from the ground,<br>
  Though his wounds were mostly mortal, yet he fiercely gazed around;<br>
  There was no one to oppose him&mdash;all the rest were in a trance,<br>
  So he scrambled on his pony for his last expiring chance,<br>
  For he meant to make an effort to get victory to his side;<br>
  So he struck at goal&mdash;and missed it&mdash;then he tumbled off and died.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>By the old Campaspe River, where the  breezes shake the grass,<br>
  There&rsquo;s a row of little gravestones that the stockmen never pass,<br>
  For they bear a crude inscription saying, &ldquo;Stranger, drop a tear,<br>
  For the Cuff and Collar players and the Geebung boys lie here.&rdquo;<br>
  And on misty moonlit evenings, while the dingoes howl around,<br>
  You can see their shadows flitting down that phantom polo ground;<br>
  You can hear the loud collisions as the flying players meet,<br>
  And the rattle of the mallets, and the rush of ponies&rsquo; feet,<br>
  Till the terrified spectator rides like blazes to the pub&mdash;<br>
  He&rsquo;s been haunted by the spectres of the Geebung Polo Club.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheTravellingPostOffice"></a>The Travelling Post Office</h2>
<p>The roving&nbsp;breezes come and  go, the reed beds sweep and sway,<br>
  The sleepy river murmurs low, and loiters on  its way,<br>
  It is the land of lots o&rsquo; time along the  Castlereagh. </p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * *</b></p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s son had left the farm, he  found it dull and slow,<br>
  He drifted to the great North-west where all the rovers go.<br>
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone so long,&rdquo; the old man said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s dropped right out of mind,<br>
  But if you&rsquo;d write a line to him I&rsquo;d take it very kind;<br>
  He&rsquo;s shearing here and fencing there, a kind of waif and stray,<br>
  He&rsquo;s droving now with Conroy&rsquo;s sheep along the Castlereagh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sheep are travelling for the grass,  and travelling very slow;<br>
  They may be at Mundooran now, or past the Overflow,<br>
  Or tramping down the black soil flats across by Waddiwong,<br>
  But all those little country towns would send the letter wrong,<br>
  The mailman, if he&rsquo;s extra tired, would pass them in his sleep,<br>
  It&rsquo;s safest to address the note to &lsquo;Care of Conroy&rsquo;s sheep&rsquo;,<br>
  For five and twenty thousand head can scarcely go astray,<br>
  You write to &lsquo;Care of Conroy&rsquo;s sheep along the Castlereagh&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>By rock and ridge and riverside the  western mail has gone,<br>
  Across the great Blue Mountain Range to take that letter on.<br>
  A moment on the topmost grade while open fire doors glare,<br>
  She pauses like a living thing to breathe the mountain air,<br>
  Then launches down the other side across the plains away<br>
  To bear that note to &ldquo;Conroy&rsquo;s sheep along the Castlereagh&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And now by coach and mailman&rsquo;s bag it goes  from town to town,<br>
  And Conroy&rsquo;s Gap and Conroy&rsquo;s Creek have marked it &ldquo;further down&rdquo;.<br>
  Beneath a sky of deepest blue where never cloud abides,<br>
  A speck upon the waste of plain the lonely mailman rides.<br>
  Where fierce hot winds have set the pine and myall boughs asweep<br>
  He hails the shearers passing by for news of Conroy&rsquo;s sheep.<br>
  By big lagoons where wildfowl play and crested pigeons flock,<br>
  By camp fires where the drovers ride around their restless stock,<br>
  And past the teamster toiling down to fetch the wool away<br>
  My letter chases Conroy&rsquo;s sheep along the Castlereagh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="SaltbushBill"></a>Saltbush Bill</h2>
<p>Now&nbsp;this is the law  of the Overland that all in the West obey&mdash;<br>
  A man must cover with travelling sheep a  six-mile stage a day;<br>
  But this is the law which the drovers make,  right easily understood,<br>
  They travel their stage where the grass is  bad, but they camp where the grass is good;<br>
  They camp, and they ravage the squatter&rsquo;s  grass till never a blade remains,<br>
  Then they drift away as the white clouds drift  on the edge of the saltbush plains,<br>
  From camp to camp and from run to run they  battle it hand to hand,<br>
  For a blade of grass and the right to pass on  the track of the Overland.<br>
  For this is the law of the Great Stock Routes,  &rsquo;tis written in white and black&mdash;<br>
  The man that goes with a travelling mob must  keep to a half-mile track;<br>
  And the drovers keep to a half-mile track on  the runs where the grass is dead,<br>
  But they spread their sheep on a well-grassed  run till they go with a two-mile spread.<br>
  So the squatters hurry the drovers on from  dawn till the fall of night,<br>
  And the squatters&rsquo; dogs and the drovers&rsquo; dogs  get mixed in a deadly fight;<br>
  Yet the squatters&rsquo; men, though they hunt the  mob, are willing the peace to keep,<br>
  For the drovers learn how to use their hands  when they go with the travelling sheep;<br>
  But this is the tale of a Jackaroo that came  from a foreign strand,<br>
  And the fight that he fought with Saltbush  Bill, the King of the Overland. </p>
<p>Now Saltbush Bill was a drover tough, as  ever the country knew,<br>
  He had fought his way on the Great Stock Routes from the sea to the big Barcoo;<br>
  He could tell when he came to a friendly run that gave him a chance to spread,<br>
  And he knew where the hungry owners were that hurried his sheep ahead;<br>
  He was drifting down in the Eighty drought with a mob that could scarcely  creep,<br>
  (When the kangaroos by the thousands starve, it is rough on the travelling  sheep),<br>
  And he camped one night at the crossing-place on the edge of the Wilga run,<br>
  &ldquo;We must manage a feed for them here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or the half of the mob are  done!&rdquo;<br>
  So he spread them out when they left the camp wherever they liked to go,<br>
  Till he grew aware of a Jackaroo with a station-hand in tow,<br>
  And they set to work on the straggling sheep, and with many a stockwhip crack<br>
  They forced them in where the grass was dead in the space of the half-mile  track;<br>
  So William prayed that the hand of fate might suddenly strike him blue<br>
  But he&rsquo;d get some grass for his starving sheep in the teeth of that Jackaroo.<br>
  So he turned and he cursed the Jackaroo, he cursed him alive or dead,<br>
  From the soles of his great unwieldy feet to the crown of his ugly head,<br>
  With an extra curse on the moke he rode and the cur at his heels that ran,<br>
  Till the Jackaroo from his horse got down and he went for the drover-man;<br>
  With the station-hand for his picker-up, though the sheep ran loose the while,<br>
  They battled it out on the saltbush plain in the regular prize-ring style.</p>
<p>Now, the new chum fought for his honour&rsquo;s  sake and the pride of the English race,<br>
  But the drover fought for his daily bread with a smile on his bearded face;<br>
  So he shifted ground and he sparred for wind and he made it a lengthy mill,<br>
  And from time to time as his scouts came in they whispered to Saltbush Bill&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;We have spread the sheep with a two-mile spread, and the grass it is something  grand,<br>
  You must stick to him, Bill, for another round for the pride of the Overland.&rdquo;<br>
  The new chum made it a rushing fight, though never a blow got home,<br>
  Till the sun rode high in the cloudless sky and glared on the brick-red loam,<br>
  Till the sheep drew in to the shelter-trees and settled them down to rest,<br>
  Then the drover said he would fight no more and he gave his opponent best.</p>
<p>So the new chum rode to the homestead  straight and he told them a story grand<br>
  Of the desperate fight that he fought that day with the King of the Overland.<br>
  And the tale went home to the Public Schools of the pluck of the English swell&mdash;<br>
  How the drover fought for his very life, but blood in the end must tell.<br>
  But the travelling sheep and the Wilga sheep were boxed on the Old Man Plain.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a full week&rsquo;s work ere they drafted out and hunted them off again,<br>
  With a week&rsquo;s good grass in their wretched hides, with a curse and a stockwhip  crack,<br>
  They hunted them off on the road once more to starve on the half-mile track.<br>
  And Saltbush Bill, on the Overland,  will many a time recite<br>
  How the best day&rsquo;s work that ever he did was the day that he lost the fight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AMountainStation"></a>A Mountain Station</h2>
<p>I&nbsp;bought&nbsp;a run a while  ago,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On country rough and  ridgy,<br>
  Where wallaroos and wombats grow&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Upper  Murrumbidgee.<br>
  The grass is rather scant, it&rsquo;s true,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this a fair  exchange is,<br>
  The sheep can see a lovely view<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By climbing up the  ranges. </p>
<p>And She-oak Flat&rsquo;s the station&rsquo;s name,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not surprised at that, sirs:<br>
  The oaks were there before I came,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I supplied the flat, sirs.<br>
  A man would wonder how it&rsquo;s done,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stock so soon decreases&mdash;<br>
  They sometimes tumble off the run<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And break themselves to pieces.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to make expenses meet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But wasted all my labours,<br>
  The sheep the dingoes didn&rsquo;t eat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were stolen by the neighbours.<br>
  They stole my pears&mdash;my native pears&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thrice-convicted felons,<br>
  And ravished from me unawares<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My crop of paddy-melons.</p>
<p>And sometimes under sunny skies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without an explanation,<br>
  The Murrumbidgee used to rise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And overflow the station.<br>
  But this was caused (as now I know)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When summer sunshine glowing<br>
  Had melted all Kiandra&rsquo;s snow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set the river going.</p>
<p>And in the news, perhaps you read:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Stock passings. Puckawidgee,<br>
  Fat cattle: Seven hundred head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept down the Murrumbidgee;<br>
  Their destination&rsquo;s quite obscure,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, somehow, there&rsquo;s a notion,<br>
  Unless the river falls, they&rsquo;re sure<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach the Southern Ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So after that I&rsquo;ll give it best;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more with Fate I&rsquo;ll battle.<br>
  I&rsquo;ll let the river take the rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those were all my cattle.<br>
  And with one comprehensive curse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I close my brief narration,<br>
  And advertise it in my verse&mdash;<br>

<p>It was&nbsp;the man from  Ironbark who struck the Sydney  town,<br>
  He wandered over street and park, he wandered  up and down.<br>
  He loitered here, he loitered there, till he  was like to drop,<br>
  Until at last in sheer despair he sought a  barber&rsquo;s shop.<br>
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere! shave my beard and whiskers off, I&rsquo;ll  be a man of mark,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll go and do the Sydney toff up home in Ironbark.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The barber man was small and flash, as  barbers mostly are,<br>
  He wore a strike-your-fancy sash, he smoked a huge cigar:<br>
  He was a humorist of note and keen at repartee,<br>
  He laid the odds and kept a &ldquo;tote&rdquo;, whatever that may be,<br>
  And when he saw our friend arrive, he whispered &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a lark!<br>
  Just watch me catch him all alive, this man from Ironbark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were some gilded youths that sat  along the barber&rsquo;s wall,<br>
  Their eyes were dull, their heads were flat, they had no brains at all;<br>
  To them the barber passed the wink, his dexter eyelid shut,<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make this bloomin&rsquo; yokel think his bloomin&rsquo; throat is cut.&rdquo;<br>
  And as he soaped and rubbed it in he made a rude remark:<br>
  &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose the flats is pretty green up there in Ironbark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A grunt was all reply he got; he shaved  the bushman&rsquo;s chin,<br>
  Then made the water boiling hot and dipped the razor in.<br>
  He raised his hand, his brow grew black, he paused awhile to gloat,<br>
  Then slashed the red-hot razor-back across his victim&rsquo;s throat;<br>
  Upon the newly shaven skin it made a livid mark&mdash;<br>
  No doubt it fairly took him in&mdash;the man from Ironbark.</p>
<p>He fetched a wild up-country yell might  wake the dead to hear,<br>
  And though his throat, he knew full well, was cut from ear to ear,<br>
  He struggled gamely to his feet, and faced the murd&rsquo;rous foe:<br>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done for me! you dog, I&rsquo;m beat! one hit before I go!<br>
  I only wish I had a knife, you blessed murdering shark!<br>
  But you&rsquo;ll remember all your life, the man from Ironbark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted up his hairy paw, with one  tremendous clout<br>
  He landed on the barber&rsquo;s jaw, and knocked the barber out.<br>
  He set to work with tooth and nail, he made the place a wreck;<br>
  He grabbed the nearest gilded youth, and tried to break his neck.<br>
  And all the while his throat he held to save his vital spark,<br>
  And &ldquo;Murder! Bloody Murder!&rdquo; yelled the man from Ironbark.</p>
<p>A peeler man who heard the din came in to  see the show;<br>
  He tried to run the bushman in, but he refused to go.<br>
  And when at last the barber spoke, and said, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas all in fun&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas just a little harmless joke, a trifle overdone.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;A joke!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;By George, that&rsquo;s fine; a lively sort of lark;<br>
  I&rsquo;d like to catch that murdering swine some night in Ironbark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now while round the shearing floor the  list&rsquo;ning shearers gape,<br>
  He tells the story o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er, and brags of his escape.<br>
  &ldquo;Them barber chaps what keeps a tote, By George, I&rsquo;ve had enough,<br>
  One tried to cut my bloomin&rsquo; throat, but thank the Lord it&rsquo;s tough.&rdquo;<br>
  And whether he&rsquo;s believed or no, there&rsquo;s one thing to remark,<br>
  That flowing beards are all the go way up in Ironbark.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheOpenSteeplechase"></a>The Open Steeplechase</h2>
<p>I&nbsp;had&nbsp;ridden over hurdles up the country  once or twice,<br>
  By the side of Snowy   River with a horse they  called &ldquo;The Ace&rdquo;.<br>
  And we brought him down to Sydney, and our rider Jimmy Rice,<br>
  Got a fall and broke his shoulder, so they nabbed me in a trice&mdash;<br>
  Me, that never wore the colours, for the Open Steeplechase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make the running,&rdquo; said the trainer,  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your only chance whatever,<br>
  Make it hot from start to finish, for the old black horse can stay,<br>
  And just think of how they&rsquo;ll take it, when they hear on Snowy River<br>
  That the country boy was plucky, and the country horse was clever.<br>
  You must ride for old Monaro and the mountain boys to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rsquo; said the starter, as we  held the horses back,<br>
  All ablazing with impatience, with excitement all aglow;<br>
  Before us like a ribbon stretched the steeple-chasing track,<br>
  And the sun-rays glistened brightly on the chestnut and the black<br>
  As the starter&rsquo;s words came slowly, &ldquo;Are &mdash;you &mdash;ready? Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I scarcely knew we&rsquo;d started, I was  stupid-like with wonder<br>
  Till the field closed up beside me and a jump appeared ahead.<br>
  And we flew it like a hurdle, not a baulk and not a blunder,<br>
  As we charged it all together, and it fairly whistled under,<br>
  And then some were pulled behind me and a few shot out and led.</p>
<p>So we ran for half the distance, and I&rsquo;m  making no pretences<br>
  When I tell you I was feeling very nervous-like and queer,<br>
  For those jockeys rode like demons; you would think they&rsquo;d lost their senses<br>
  If you saw them rush their horses at those rasping five foot fences &mdash;<br>
  And in place of making running I was falling to the rear.</p>
<p>Till a chap came racing past me on a horse  they called &ldquo;The Quiver&rdquo;,<br>
  And said he, &ldquo;My country joker, are you going to give it best?<br>
  Are you frightened of the fences? does their stoutness make you shiver?<br>
  Have they come to breeding cowards by the side of Snowy River?<br>
  Are there riders on Monaro?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but I never heard the rest.</p>
<p>For I drove the Ace and sent him just as  fast as he could pace it,<br>
  At the big black line of timber stretching fair across the track,<br>
  And he shot beside the Quiver. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my boy, we&rsquo;ll race it.<br>
  You can come with Snowy   River if you&rsquo;re only game  to face it,<br>
  Let us mend the pace a little and we&rsquo;ll see who cries a crack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we raced away together, and we left the  others standing,<br>
  And the people cheered and shouted as we settled down to ride,<br>
  And we clung beside the Quiver. At his taking off and landing<br>
  I could see his scarlet nostril and his mighty ribs expanding,<br>
  And the Ace stretched out in earnest and we held him stride for stride.</p>
<p>But the pace was so terrific that they  soon ran out their tether&mdash;<br>
  They were rolling in their gallop, they were fairly blown and beat&mdash;<br>
  But they both were game as pebbles&mdash;neither one would show the feather.<br>
  And we rushed them at the fences, and they cleared them both together,<br>
  Nearly every time they clouted, but they somehow kept their feet.</p>
<p>Then the last jump rose before us, and  they faced it game as ever&mdash;<br>
  We were both at spur and whipcord, fetching blood at every bound&mdash;<br>
  And above the people&rsquo;s cheering and the cries of &ldquo;Ace&rdquo; and &ldquo;Quiver&rdquo;,<br>
  I could hear the trainer shouting, &ldquo;One more run for Snowy River.&rdquo;<br>
  Then we struck the jump together and came smashing to the ground.</p>
<p>Well, the Quiver ran to blazes, but the  Ace stood still and waited,<br>
  Stood and waited like a statue while I scrambled on his back.<br>
  There was no one next or near me for the field was fairly slated,<br>
  So I cantered home a winner with my shoulder dislocated,<br>
  While the man that rode the Quiver followed limping down the track.</p>
<p>And he shook my hand and told me that in  all his days he never<br>
  Met a man who rode more gamely, and our last set to was prime,<br>
  And we wired them on Monaro how we chanced to beat the Quiver.<br>
  And they sent us back an answer, &ldquo;Good old sort from Snowy River:<br>
  Send us word each race you start in and we&rsquo;ll back you every time.&rdquo;</p>

  Boss must be gone off his head to be sending  our steeplechase crack<br>
  Out over fences like these with an object like  that on his back. </p>
<p>Ride! Don&rsquo;t tell&nbsp;<i>me</i>&nbsp;he  can ride. With his pants just as loose as balloons,<br>
  How can he sit on his horse? and his spurs like a pair of harpoons;<br>
  Ought to be under the Dog Act, he ought, and be kept off the course.<br>
  Fall! why, he&rsquo;d fall off a cart, let alone off a steeplechase horse.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>Yessir! the &rsquo;orse is all ready&mdash;I wish  you&rsquo;d have rode him before;<br>
  Nothing like knowing your &rsquo;orse, sir, and this chap&rsquo;s a terror to bore;<br>
  Battleaxe always could pull, and he rushes his fences like fun&mdash;<br>
  Stands off his jump twenty feet, and then springs like a shot from a gun.</p>
<p>Oh, he can jump &rsquo;em all right, sir, you  make no mistake, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s a toff;<br>
  Clouts &rsquo;em in earnest, too, sometimes, you mind that he don&rsquo;t clout you off&mdash;<br>
  Don&rsquo;t seem to mind how he hits &rsquo;em, his shins is as hard as a nail,<br>
  Sometimes you&rsquo;ll see the fence shake and the splinters fly up from the rail.</p>
<p>All you can do is to hold him and just let  him jump as he likes,<br>
  Give him his head at the fences, and hang on like death if he strikes;<br>
  Don&rsquo;t let him run himself out&mdash;you can lie third or fourth in the race&mdash;<br>
  Until you clear the stone wall, and from that you can put on the pace.</p>
<p>Fell at that wall once, he did, and it  gave him a regular spread,<br>
  Ever since that time he flies it&mdash;he&rsquo;ll stop if you pull at his head,<br>
  Just let him race&mdash;you can trust him&mdash;he&rsquo;ll take first-class care he don&rsquo;t fall,<br>
  And I think that&rsquo;s the lot&mdash;but remember, <i>he  must have his head at the wall</i>.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s down safe as far as the start,  and he seems to sit on pretty neat,<br>
  Only his baggified breeches would ruinate anyone&rsquo;s seat&mdash;<br>
  They&rsquo;re away&mdash;here they come&mdash;the first fence, and he&rsquo;s head over heels for a  crown!<br>
  Good for the new chum, he&rsquo;s over, and two of the others are down!</p>
<p>Now for the treble, my hearty&mdash;By Jove, he  can ride, after all;<br>
  Whoop, that&rsquo;s your sort&mdash;let him fly them! He hasn&rsquo;t much fear of a fall.<br>
  Who in the world would have thought it? And aren&rsquo;t they just going a pace?<br>
  Little Recruit in the lead there will make it a stoutly-run race.</p>
<p>Lord! But they&rsquo;re racing in earnest&mdash;and  down goes Recruit on his head,<br>
  Rolling clean over his boy&mdash;it&rsquo;s a miracle if he ain&rsquo;t dead.<br>
  Battleaxe, Battleaxe, yet! By the Lord, he&rsquo;s got most of &rsquo;em beat&mdash;<br>
  Ho! did you see how he struck, and the swell never moved in his seat?</p>
<p>Second time round, and, by Jingo! he&rsquo;s  holding his lead of &rsquo;em well;<br>
  Hark to him clouting the timber! It don&rsquo;t seem to trouble the swell.<br>
  Now for the wall&mdash;let him rush it. A thirty-foot leap, I declare&mdash;<br>
  Never a shift in his seat, and he&rsquo;s racing for home like a hare.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s chasing  him&mdash;Rataplan&mdash;regular demon to stay!<br>
  Sit down and ride for your life now! Oh, good, that&rsquo;s the style&mdash;come away!<br>
  Rataplan&rsquo;s certain to beat you, unless you can give him the slip;<br>
  Sit down and rub in the whalebone now&mdash;give him the spurs and the whip!</p>
<p>Battleaxe, Battleaxe, yet&mdash;and it&rsquo;s  Battleaxe wins for a crown;<br>
  Look at him rushing the fences, he wants to bring t&rsquo;other chap down.<br>
  Rataplan never will catch him if only he keeps on his pins;<br>

  And far away one dimly sees<br>
  Beyond the stretch of forest trees&mdash;<br>
  Beyond the foothills dusk and dun&mdash;<br>
  The ranges sleeping in the sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  Kiley&rsquo;s Run.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis many years since first I came<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  Kiley&rsquo;s Run,<br>
  More years than I would care to name<br>
  Since I, a stripling, used to ride<br>
  For miles and miles at Kiley&rsquo;s side,<br>
  The while in stirring tones he told<br>
  The stories of the days of old<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  Kiley&rsquo;s Run.</p>
<p>I see the old bush homestead now<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  Kiley&rsquo;s Run,<br>
  Just nestled down beneath the brow<br>
  Of one small ridge above the sweep<br>
  Of river-flat, where willows weep<br>
  And jasmine flowers and roses bloom,<br>
  The air was laden with perfume<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  Kiley&rsquo;s Run.</p>
<p>We lived the good old station life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  Kiley&rsquo;s Run,<br>
  With little thought of care or strife.<br>
  Old Kiley seldom used to roam,<br>
  He liked to make the Run his home,<br>
  The swagman never turned away<br>
  With empty hand at close of day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From  Kiley&rsquo;s Run.</p>
<p>We kept a racehorse now and then<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  Kiley&rsquo;s Run,<br>
  And neighb&rsquo;ring stations brought their men<br>
  To meetings where the sport was free,<br>
  And dainty ladies came to see<br>
  Their champions ride; with laugh and song<br>
  The old house rang the whole night long<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  Kiley&rsquo;s Run.</p>
<p>The station hands were friends I wot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  Kiley&rsquo;s Run,<br>
  A reckless, merry-hearted lot&mdash;<br>
  All splendid riders, and they knew<br>
  The &ldquo;boss&rdquo; was kindness through and through.<br>
  Old Kiley always stood their friend,<br>
  And so they served him to the end<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  Kiley&rsquo;s Run.</p>
<p>But droughts and losses came apace<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  Kiley&rsquo;s Run,<br>
  Till ruin stared him in the face;<br>
  He toiled and toiled while lived the light,<br>
  He dreamed of overdrafts at night:<br>
  At length, because he could not pay,<br>
  His bankers took the stock away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From  Kiley&rsquo;s Run.</p>
<p>Old Kiley stood and saw them go<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From  Kiley&rsquo;s Run.<br>
  The well-bred cattle marching slow;<br>
  His stockmen, mates for many a day,<br>
  They wrung his hand and went away.<br>
  Too old to make another start,<br>
  Old Kiley died&mdash;of broken heart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  Kiley&rsquo;s Run.</p>

  He knows a racehorse from a cow;<br>
  But that is all he knows of stock:<br>
  His chiefest care is how to dock<br>
  Expenses, and he sends from town<br>
  To cut the shearers&rsquo; wages down<br>

  The hospitable homes are bare,<br>
  The gardens gone; for no pretence<br>
  Must hinder cutting down expense:<br>
  The homestead that we held so dear<br>

  No longer there the stockmen ride;<br>
  For sour-faced boundary riders creep<br>
  On mongrel horses after sheep,<br>
  Through ranges where, at racing speed,<br>
  Old Kiley used to &ldquo;wheel the lead&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  Kiley&rsquo;s Run.</p>

  On either side the herbage smiles,<br>
  But wretched trav&rsquo;lling sheep must pass<br>
  Without a drink or blade of grass<br>
  Thro&rsquo; that long lane of death and shame:<br>
  The weary drovers curse the name<br>

  The lonely swagman through the dark<br>
  Must hump his swag past Chandos Park.<br>

<p>It was&nbsp;shearing-time at  the Myall Lake,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there rose the  sound thro&rsquo; the livelong day<br>
  Of the constant clash that the shear-blades  make<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fastest  shearers are making play,<br>
  But there wasn&rsquo;t a man in the shearers&rsquo; lines<br>
  That could shear a sheep with the two Devines. </p>
<p>They had rung the sheds of the east and  west,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had beaten the cracks of the Walgett side,<br>
  And the Cooma shearers had giv&rsquo;n them best&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they saw them shear, they were satisfied.<br>
  From the southern slopes to the western pines<br>
  They were noted men, were the two Devines.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas a wether flock that had come to  hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great struggling brutes, that the shearers shirk,<br>
  For the fleece was filled with the grass and sand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seventy sheep was a big day&rsquo;s work.<br>
  &ldquo;At a pound a hundred it&rsquo;s dashed hard lines<br>
  To shear such sheep,&rdquo; said the two Devines.</p>
<p>But the shearers knew that they&rsquo;d make a  cheque<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they came to deal with the station ewes;<br>
  They were bare of belly and bare of neck<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a fleece as light as a kangaroo&rsquo;s.<br>
  &ldquo;We will show the boss how a shear-blade shines<br>
  When we reach those ewes,&rdquo; said the two Devines.</p>
<p>But it chanced next day when the stunted  pines<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were swayed and stirred with the dawn-wind&rsquo;s breath,<br>
  That a message came for the two Devines<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That their father lay at the point of death.<br>
  So away at speed through the whispering pines<br>
  Down the bridle track rode the two Devines.</p>
<p>It was fifty miles to their father&rsquo;s hut,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dawn was bright when they rode away;<br>
  At the fall of night when the shed was shut<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the men had rest from the toilsome day,<br>
  To the shed once more through the dark&rsquo;ning pines<br>
  On their weary steeds came the two Devines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re back right sudden,&rdquo; the  super. said;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is the old man dead and the funeral done?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Well, no, sir, he ain&rsquo;t not exactly dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as good as dead,&rdquo; said the eldest son&mdash;<br>

  Over the miles of the saltbush plain&mdash;<br>
  The shining plain that is said to be<br>
  The dried-up bed of an inland sea,<br>
  Where the air so dry and so clear and bright<br>
  Refracts the sun with a wondrous light,<br>
  And out in the dim horizon makes<br>
  The deep blue gleam of the phantom lakes.</p>
<p>At dawn of day we would feel the breeze<br>
  That stirred the boughs of the sleeping trees,<br>
  And brought a breath of the fragrance rare<br>
  That comes and goes in that scented air;<br>
  For the trees and grass and the shrubs contain<br>
  A dry sweet scent on the saltbush plain.<br>
  For those that love it and understand,<br>
  The saltbush plain is a wonderland.<br>
  A wondrous country, where Nature&rsquo;s ways<br>
  Were revealed to me in the droving days.</p>
<p>We saw the fleet wild horses pass,<br>
  And the kangaroos through the Mitchell grass,<br>
  The emu ran with her frightened brood<br>
  All unmolested and unpursued.<br>
  But there rose a shout and a wild hubbub<br>
  When the dingo raced for his native scrub,<br>
  And he paid right dear for his stolen meals<br>
  With the drover&rsquo;s dogs at his wretched heels.<br>
  For we ran him down at a rattling pace,<br>
  While the packhorse joined in the stirring chase.<br>
  And a wild halloo at the kill we&rsquo;d raise&mdash;<br>
  We were light of heart in the droving days.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas a drover&rsquo;s horse, and my hand again<br>
  Made a move to close on a fancied rein.<br>
  For I felt the swing and the easy stride<br>
  Of the grand old horse that I used to ride<br>
  In drought or plenty, in good or ill,<br>
  That same old steed was my comrade still;<br>
  The old grey horse with his honest ways<br>
  Was a mate to me in the droving days.</p>
<p>When we kept our watch in the cold and  damp,<br>
  If the cattle broke from the sleeping camp,<br>
  Over the flats and across the plain,<br>
  With my head bent down on his waving mane,<br>
  Through the boughs above and the stumps below<br>
  On the darkest night I could let him go<br>
  At a racing speed; he would choose his course,<br>
  And my life was safe with the old grey horse.<br>
  But man and horse had a favourite job,<br>
  When an outlaw broke from a station mob,<br>
  With a right good will was the stockwhip plied,<br>
  As the old horse raced at the straggler&rsquo;s side,<br>
  And the greenhide whip such a weal would raise,<br>
  We could use the whip in the droving days.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a pound!&rdquo; and was this the end&mdash;<br>
  Only a pound for the drover&rsquo;s friend.<br>
  The drover&rsquo;s friend that had seen his day,<br>
  And now was worthless, and cast away<br>
  With a broken knee and a broken heart<br>
  To be flogged and starved in a hawker&rsquo;s cart.<br>
  Well, I made a bid for a sense of shame<br>
  And the memories dear of the good old game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you? Guinea! and cheap at that!<br>
  Against you there in the curly hat!<br>
  Only a guinea, and one more chance,<br>
  Down he goes if there&rsquo;s no advance,<br>
  Third, and the last time, one! two! three!&rdquo;<br>
  And the old grey horse was knocked down to me.<br>
  And now he&rsquo;s wandering, fat and sleek,<br>
  On the lucerne flats by the Homestead Creek;<br>
  I dare not ride him for fear he&rsquo;d fall,<br>
  But he does a journey to beat them all,<br>
  For though he scarcely a trot can raise,<br>
  He can take me back to the droving days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Lost"></a>Lost</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He&nbsp;ought to be  home,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;without there&rsquo;s something amiss.<br>
  He only went to the Two-mile&mdash;he ought to be  back by this.<br>
  He&nbsp;<i>would</i>&nbsp;ride the Reckless  filly, he&nbsp;<i>would</i>&nbsp;have his wilful way;<br>
  And, here, he&rsquo;s not back at sundown&mdash;and what  will his mother say? </p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always his mother&rsquo;s idol, since  ever his father died;<br>
  And there isn&rsquo;t a horse on the station that he isn&rsquo;t game to ride.<br>
  But that Reckless mare is vicious, and if once she gets away<br>
  He hasn&rsquo;t got strength to hold her&mdash;and what will his mother say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man walked to the sliprail, and  peered up the darkening track,<br>
  And looked and longed for the rider that would never more come back;<br>
  And the mother came and clutched him, with sudden, spasmodic fright:<br>
  &ldquo;What has become of my Willie?&mdash;why isn&rsquo;t he home to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away in the gloomy ranges, at the foot of  an ironbark,<br>
  The bonnie, winsome laddie was lying stiff and stark;<br>
  For the Reckless mare had smashed him against a leaning limb,<br>
  And his comely face was battered, and his merry eyes were dim.</p>
<p>And the thoroughbred chestnut filly, the  saddle beneath her flanks,<br>
  Was away like fire through the ranges to join the wild mob&rsquo;s ranks;<br>
  And a broken-hearted woman and an old man worn and grey<br>
  Were searching all night in the ranges till the sunrise brought the day.</p>
<p>And the mother kept feebly calling, with a  hope that would not die,<br>
  &ldquo;Willie! where are you, Willie?&rdquo; But how can the dead reply;<br>
  And hope died out with the daylight, and the darkness brought despair,<br>
  God pity the stricken mother, and answer the widow&rsquo;s prayer!</p>
<p>Though far and wide they sought him, they  found not where he fell;<br>
  For the ranges held him precious, and guarded their treasure well.<br>
  The wattle blooms above him, and the blue bells blow close by,<br>
  And the brown bees buzz the secret, and the wild birds sing reply.</p>
<p>But the mother pined and faded, and cried,  and took no rest,<br>
  And rode each day to the ranges on her hopeless, weary quest.<br>
  Seeking her loved one ever, she faded and pined away,<br>
  But with strength of her great affection she still sought every day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that sooner or later I shall find  my boy,&rdquo; she said.<br>
  But she came not home one evening, and they found her lying dead,<br>
  And stamped on the poor pale features, as the spirit homeward pass&rsquo;d,<br>
  Was an angel smile of gladness&mdash;she had found the boy at last.</p>

<p>Little&nbsp;bush maiden,  wondering-eyed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing alone in the  creek-bed dry,<br>
  In the small green flat on every side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walled in by the  Moonbi Ranges high;<br>
  Tell us the tale of your lonely life,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Mid the great grey forests  that know no change.<br>
  &ldquo;I never have left my home,&rdquo; she said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have never been  over the Moonbi Range. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Father and mother are both long dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I live with granny in yon wee place.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Where are your father and mother?&rdquo; we said.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She puzzled awhile with thoughtful face,<br>
  Then a light came into the shy brown eye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she smiled, for she thought the question strange<br>
  On a thing so certain&mdash;&ldquo;When people die<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They go to the country over the range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is this country like, my lass?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There are blossoming trees and pretty flowers,<br>
  And shining creeks where the golden grass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is fresh and sweet from the summer showers.<br>
  They never need work, nor want, nor weep;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No troubles can come their hearts to estrange.<br>
  Some summer night I shall fall asleep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wake in the country over the range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Child, you are wise in your simple trust,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the wisest man knows no more than you<br>
  Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our views by a range are bounded too;<br>
  But we know that God hath this gift in store,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That when we come to the final change,<br>
  We shall meet with our loved ones gone before<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beautiful country over the range.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the tears bedew  our cheek,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been missing for a  week. </p>
<p>Where the roaring flooded Murray<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered all the lower land,<br>
  There he started in a hurry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bottle in his hand.</p>
<p>And his fate is hid for ever,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the public seem to think<br>
  That he slumbered by the river,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Neath the influence of drink.</p>
<p>And they scarcely seem to wonder<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the river, wide and deep,<br>
  Never woke him with its thunder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never stirred him in his sleep.</p>
<p>As the crashing logs came sweeping,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their tumult filled the air,<br>
  Then M&rsquo;Ginnis murmured, sleeping,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a wake in ould Kildare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the river rose and found him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleeping softly by the stream,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere he wakened from his dream.</p>
<p>And the blossom-tufted wattle,<br>

<h2 align="center"><a name="AVoicefromtheTown"></a>A Voice from the Town</h2>
<p align="center">A Sequel to &ldquo;A Voice from the Bush&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;thought, in the days of the  droving,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of steps I might hope  to retrace,<br>
  To be done with the bush and the roving<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And settle once more  in my place.<br>
  With a heart that was well nigh to breaking,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long, lonely  rides on the plain,<br>
  I thought of the pleasure of taking<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of a lady  again. </p>
<p>I am back into civilisation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more in the stir and the strife,<br>
  But the old joys have lost their sensation&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light has gone out of my life;<br>
  The men of my time they have married,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made fortunes or gone to the wall;<br>
  Too long from the scene I have tarried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, somehow, I&rsquo;m out of it all.</p>
<p>For I go to the balls and the races<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lonely companionless elf,<br>
  And the ladies bestow all their graces<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On others less grey than myself;<br>
  While the talk goes around I&rsquo;m a dumb one<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Midst youngsters that chatter and prate,<br>
  And they call me &ldquo;the Man who was Someone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Way back in the year Sixty-eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I look, sour and old, at the dancers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That swing to the strains of the band,<br>
  And the ladies all give me the Lancers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No waltzes&mdash;I quite understand.<br>
  For matrons intent upon matching<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their daughters with infinite push,<br>
  Would scarce think him worthy the catching,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken-down man from the bush.</p>
<p>New partners have come and new faces,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, of the bygone brigade,<br>
  Sharply feel that oblivion my place is&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must lie with the rest in the shade.<br>
  And the youngsters, fresh-featured and pleasant,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They live as we lived&mdash;fairly fast;<br>
  But I doubt if the men of the present<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are as good as the men of the past.</p>
<p>Of excitement and praise they are chary,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing much good upon earth;<br>
  Their watchword is&nbsp;<i>nil admirari</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are bored from the days of their birth.<br>
  Where the life that we led was a revel<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They &ldquo;wince and relent and refrain&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  I could show them the road&mdash;to the devil,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were I only a youngster again.</p>
<p>I could show them the road where the  stumps are<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleasures that end in remorse,<br>
  And the game where the Devil&rsquo;s three trumps are,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman, the card, and the horse.<br>
  Shall the blind lead the blind&mdash;shall the sower<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wind reap the storm as of yore?<br>
  Though they get to their goal somewhat slower,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They march where we hurried before.</p>
<p>For the world never learns&mdash;just as we did,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gallantly go to their fate,<br>
  Unheeded all warnings, unheeded<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maxims of elders sedate.<br>
  As the husbandman, patiently toiling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draws a harvest each year from the soil,<br>
  So the fools grow afresh for the spoiling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a new crop of thieves for the spoil.</p>
<p>But a truce to this dull moralising,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them drink while the drops are of gold,<br>
  I have tasted the dregs&mdash;&rsquo;twere surprising<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the new wine to me like the old;<br>
  And I weary for lack of employment<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In idleness day after day,<br>
  For the key to the door of enjoyment<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Youth&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve thrown it away.</p>

<p>As I&nbsp;lie at rest on a  patch of clover<br>
  In the Western Park when the day is done,<br>
  I watch as the wild black swans fly over<br>
  With their phalanx turned to the sinking sun;<br>
  And I hear the clang of their leader crying<br>
  To a lagging mate in the rearward flying,<br>
  And they fade away in the darkness dying,<br>
  Where the stars are mustering one by one. </p>
<p>O ye wild black swans, &rsquo;twere a world of  wonder<br>
  For a while to join in your westward flight,<br>
  With the stars above and the dim earth under,<br>
  Through the cooling air of the glorious night.<br>
  As we swept along on our pinions winging,<br>
  We should catch the chime of a church-bell ringing,<br>
  Or the distant note of a torrent singing,<br>
  Or the far-off flash of a station light.</p>
<p>From the northern lakes with the reeds and  rushes,<br>
  Where the hills are clothed with a purple haze,<br>
  Where the bell-birds chime and the songs of thrushes<br>
  Make music sweet in the jungle maze,<br>
  They will hold their course to the westward ever,<br>
  Till they reach the banks of the old grey river,<br>
  Where the waters wash, and the reed-beds quiver<br>
  In the burning heat of the summer days.</p>
<p>O ye strange wild birds, will ye bear a  greeting<br>
  To the folk that live in that western land?<br>
  Then for every sweep of your pinions beating,<br>
  Ye shall bear a wish to the sunburnt band,<br>
  To the stalwart men who are stoutly fighting<br>
  With the heat and drought and the dust-storm smiting,<br>
  Yet whose life somehow has a strange inviting,<br>
  When once to the work they have put their hand.</p>
<p>Facing it yet! O my friend stout-hearted,<br>
  What does it matter for rain or shine,<br>
  For the hopes deferred and the gain departed?<br>
  Nothing could conquer that heart of thine.<br>
  And thy health and strength are beyond confessing<br>
  As the only joys that are worth possessing.<br>
  May the days to come be as rich in blessing<br>
  As the days we spent in the auld lang syne.</p>
<p>I would fain go back to the old grey  river,<br>
  To the old bush days when our hearts were light,<br>
  But, alas! those days they have fled for ever,<br>
  They are like the swans that have swept from sight.<br>
  And I know full well that the strangers&rsquo; faces<br>
  Would meet us now in our dearest places;<br>
  For our day is dead and has left no traces<br>
  But the thoughts that live in my mind to-night.</p>
<p>There are folk long dead, and our hearts  would sicken&mdash;<br>
  We would grieve for them with a bitter pain,<br>
  If the past could live and the dead could quicken,<br>
  We then might turn to that life again.<br>
  But on lonely nights we would hear them calling,<br>
  We should hear their steps on the pathways falling,<br>
  We should loathe the life with a hate appalling<br>
  In our lonely rides by the ridge and plain.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheBossoftheAdmiralLynch"></a>The Boss of the&nbsp;<i>Admiral Lynch</i></h2>
<p>Did&nbsp;you ever hear  tell of Chili? I was readin&rsquo; the other day<br>
  Of President Balmaceda and of how he was sent  away.<br>
  It seems that he didn&rsquo;t suit &rsquo;em&mdash;they thought  that they&rsquo;d like a change,<br>
  So they started an insurrection and chased him  across the range.<br>
  They seemed to be restless people&mdash;and, judging  by what you hear,<br>
  They raise up these revolutions &rsquo;bout two or  three times a year;<br>
  And the man that goes out of office, he goes  for the boundary <i>quick</i>,<br>
  For there isn&rsquo;t no vote by ballot&mdash;it&rsquo;s bullets  that does the trick.<br>
  And it ain&rsquo;t like a real battle, where the  prisoners&rsquo; lives are spared,<br>
  And they fight till there&rsquo;s one side beaten  and then there&rsquo;s a truce declared,</p>
<p>And the man that has got the licking goes down  like a blooming lord<br>
  To hand in his resignation and give up his  blooming sword,<br>
  And the other man bows and takes it, and  everything&rsquo;s all polite&mdash;<br>
  This wasn&rsquo;t that kind of a picnic, this wasn&rsquo;t  that sort of a fight.<br>
  For the pris&rsquo;ners they took&mdash;they shot &rsquo;em; no  odds were they small or great,<br>
  If they&rsquo;d collared old Balmaceda, they  reckoned to shoot him straight.<br>
  A lot of bloodthirsty devils they were&mdash;but  there ain&rsquo;t a doubt<br>
  They must have been real plucked &rsquo;uns, the way  that they fought it out,<br>
  And the king of &rsquo;em all, I reckon, the man  that could stand a pinch,<br>
  Was the boss of a one-horse gunboat. They  called her the&nbsp;<i>Admiral Lynch</i>. </p>
<p>Well, he was for Balmaceda, and after the  war was done,<br>
  And Balmaceda was beaten and his troops had been forced to run,<br>
  The other man fetched his army and proceeded to do things brown,<br>
  He marched &rsquo;em into the fortress and took command of the town.<br>
  Cannon and guns and horses troopin&rsquo; along the road,<br>
  Rumblin&rsquo; over the bridges, and never a foeman showed<br>
  Till they came in sight of the harbour, and the very first thing they see<br>
  Was this mite of a one-horse gunboat a-lying against the quay,<br>
  And there as they watched they noticed a flutter of crimson rag,<br>
  And under their eyes he hoisted old Balmaceda&rsquo;s flag.<br>
  Well, I tell you it fairly knocked &rsquo;em&mdash;it just took away their breath,<br>
  For he must ha&rsquo; known if they caught him, &rsquo;twas nothin&rsquo; but sudden death.<br>
  An&rsquo; he&rsquo;d got no fire in his furnace, no chance to put out to sea,<br>
  So he stood by his gun and waited with his vessel against the quay.<br>
  Well, they sent him a civil message to say that the war was done,<br>
  And most of his side were corpses, and all that were left had run;<br>
  And blood had been spilt sufficient, so they gave him a chance to decide<br>
  If he&rsquo;d haul down his bit of bunting and come on the winning side.<br>
  He listened and heard their message, and answered them all polite,<br>
  That he was a Spanish hidalgo,  and the men of his race&nbsp;<i>must</i>&nbsp;fight!<br>
  A gunboat against an army, and with never a chance to run,<br>
  And them with their hundred cannon and him with a single gun:<br>
  The odds were a trifle heavy&mdash;but he wasn&rsquo;t the sort to flinch,<br>
  So he opened fire on the army, did the boss of the&nbsp;<i>Admiral Lynch</i>.</p>
<p>They pounded his boat to pieces, they  silenced his single gun,<br>
  And captured the whole consignment, for none of &rsquo;em cared to run;<br>
  And it don&rsquo;t say whether they shot him&mdash;it don&rsquo;t even give his name&mdash;<br>
  But whatever they did I&rsquo;ll wager that he went to his graveyard game.<br>
  I tell you those old hidalgos  so stately and so polite,<br>
  They turn out the real Maginnis when it comes to an uphill fight.<br>
  There was General Alcantara, who died in the heaviest brunt,<br>
  And General Alzereca was killed in the battle&rsquo;s front;<br>
  But the king of &rsquo;em all, I reckon&mdash;the man that could stand a pinch&mdash;<br>
  Was the man who attacked the army with the gunboat&nbsp;<i>Admiral Lynch</i>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m&nbsp;travellin&rsquo; down  the Castlereagh, and I&rsquo;m a station hand,<br>
  I&rsquo;m handy with the ropin&rsquo; pole, I&rsquo;m handy with  the brand,<br>
  And I can ride a rowdy colt, or swing the axe  all day,<br>
  But there&rsquo;s no demand for a station-hand along  the Castlereagh. </p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s shift, boys, shift, for there  isn&rsquo;t the slightest doubt<br>
  That we&rsquo;ve got to make a shift to the stations further out,<br>
  With the pack-horse runnin&rsquo; after, for he follows like a dog,<br>
  We must strike across the country at the old jig-jog.</p>
<p>This old black horse I&rsquo;m riding&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll  notice what&rsquo;s his brand,<br>
  He wears the crooked R, you see&mdash;none better in the land.<br>
  He takes a lot of beatin&rsquo;, and the other day we tried,<br>
  For a bit of a joke, with a racing bloke, for twenty pounds a side.</p>
<p>It was shift, boys, shift, for there  wasn&rsquo;t the slightest doubt<br>
  That I had to make him shift, for the money was nearly out;<br>
  But he cantered home a winner, with the other one at the flog&mdash;<br>
  He&rsquo;s a red-hot sort to pick up with his old jig-jog.</p>
<p>I asked a cove for shearin&rsquo; once along the  Marthaguy:<br>
  &ldquo;We shear non-union here,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I call it scab,&rdquo; says I.<br>
  I looked along the shearin&rsquo; floor before I turned to go&mdash;<br>
  There were eight or ten dashed Chinamen a-shearin&rsquo; in a row.</p>
<p>It was shift, boys, shift, for there  wasn&rsquo;t the slightest doubt<br>
  It was time to make a shift with the leprosy about.<br>
  So I saddled up my horses, and I whistled to my dog,<br>
  And I left his scabby station at the old jig-jog.</p>
<p>I went to Illawarra, where my brother&rsquo;s  got a farm,<br>
  He has to ask his landlord&rsquo;s leave before he lifts his arm;<br>
  The landlord owns the country side&mdash;man, woman, dog, and cat,<br>
  They haven&rsquo;t the cheek to dare to speak without they touch their hat.</p>
<p>It was shift, boys, shift, for there  wasn&rsquo;t the slightest doubt<br>
  Their little landlord god and I would soon have fallen out;<br>
  Was I to touch my hat to him?&mdash;was I his bloomin&rsquo; dog?<br>
  So I makes for up the country at the old jig-jog.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s time that I was movin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ve a  mighty way to go<br>
  Till I drink artesian water from a thousand feet below;<br>
  Till I meet the overlanders with the cattle comin&rsquo; down,<br>
  And I&rsquo;ll work a while till I make a pile, then have a spree in town.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s shift, boys, shift, for there  isn&rsquo;t the slightest doubt<br>
  We&rsquo;ve got to make a shift to the stations further out;<br>
  The pack-horse runs behind us, for he follows like a dog,<br>
  And we cross a lot of country at the old jig-jog.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="HowGilbertDied"></a>How Gilbert Died</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s&nbsp;never a stone at  the sleeper&rsquo;s head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s never a fence  beside,<br>
  And the wandering stock on the grave may tread<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unnoticed and  undenied,<br>
  But the smallest child on the Watershed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can tell you how  Gilbert died. </p>
<p>For he rode at dusk, with his comrade Dunn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the hut at the Stockman&rsquo;s Ford,<br>
  In the waning light of the sinking sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They peered with a fierce accord.<br>
  They were outlaws both&mdash;and on each man&rsquo;s head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a thousand pounds reward.</p>
<p>They had taken toll of the country round,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the troopers came behind<br>
  With a black that tracked like a human hound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scrub and the ranges blind:<br>
  He could run the trail where a white man&rsquo;s eye<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sign of a track could find.</p>
<p>He had hunted them out of the One Tree Hill<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over the Old Man Plain,<br>
  But they wheeled their tracks with a wild beast&rsquo;s skill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they made for the range again.<br>
  Then away to the hut where their grandsire dwelt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rode with a loosened rein.</p>
<p>And their grandsire gave them a greeting  bold:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Come in and rest in peace,<br>
  No safer place does the country hold&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the night pursuit must cease,<br>
  And we&rsquo;ll drink success to the roving boys,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to hell with the black police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they went to death when they entered  there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hut at the Stockman&rsquo;s Ford,<br>
  For their grandsire&rsquo;s words were as false as fair&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were doomed to the hangman&rsquo;s cord.<br>
  He had sold them both to the black police<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of the big reward.</p>
<p>In the depth of night there are forms that  glide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stealthy as serpents creep,<br>
  And around the hut where the outlaws hide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They plant in the shadows deep,<br>
  And they wait till the first faint flush of dawn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall waken their prey from sleep.</p>
<p>But Gilbert wakes while the night is dark&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A restless sleeper, aye,<br>
  He has heard the sound of a sheep-dog&rsquo;s bark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his horse&rsquo;s warning neigh,<br>
  And he says to his mate, &ldquo;There are hawks abroad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&rsquo;s time that we went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their rifles stood at the stretcher head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bridles lay to hand,<br>
  They wakened the old man out of his bed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they heard the sharp command:<br>
  &ldquo;In the name of the Queen lay down your arms,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Dunn and Gilbert, stand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Gilbert reached for his rifle true<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That close at his hand he kept,<br>
  He pointed it straight at the voice and drew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never a flash outleapt,<br>
  For the water ran from the rifle breech&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was drenched while the outlaws slept.</p>
<p>Then he dropped the piece with a bitter  oath,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he turned to his comrade Dunn:<br>
  &ldquo;We are sold,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are dead men both,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there may be a chance for one;<br>
  I&rsquo;ll stop and I&rsquo;ll fight with the pistol here,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take to your heels and run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Dunn crept out on his hands and knees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dim, half-dawning light,<br>
  And he made his way to a patch of trees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vanished among the night,<br>
  And the trackers hunted his tracks all day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they never could trace his flight.</p>
<p>But Gilbert walked from the open door<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a confident style and rash;<br>
  He heard at his side the rifles roar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he heard the bullets crash.<br>
  But he laughed as he lifted his pistol-hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he fired at the rifle flash.</p>
<p>Then out of the shadows the troopers aimed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his voice and the pistol sound,<br>
  With the rifle flashes the darkness flamed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He staggered and spun around,<br>
  And they riddled his body with rifle balls<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it lay on the blood-soaked ground.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never a stone at the sleeper&rsquo;s  head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s never a fence beside,<br>
  And the wandering stock on the grave may tread<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unnoticed and undenied,<br>
  But the smallest child on the Watershed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can tell you how Gilbert died.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheFlyingGang"></a>The Flying Gang</h2>
<p align="center" class="note">(A Railroad Song)</p>
<p>I&nbsp;served&nbsp;my time, in the  days gone by,<br>
  In the railway&rsquo;s clash and clang,<br>
  And I worked my way to the end, and I<br>
  Was the head of the &ldquo;Flying Gang&rdquo;.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a chosen band that was kept at hand<br>
  In case of an urgent need,<br>
  Was it south or north we were started forth,<br>
  And away at our utmost speed.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If  word reached town that a bridge was down,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  imperious summons rang&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Come  out with the pilot engine sharp,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  away with the flying gang.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then a piercing scream and a rush of steam<br>
  As the engine moved ahead,<br>
  With a measured beat by the slum and street<br>
  Of the busy town we fled,<br>
  By the uplands bright and the homesteads white,<br>
  With the rush of the western gale,<br>
  And the pilot swayed with the pace we made<br>
  As she rocked on the ringing rail.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the country children  clapped their hands<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the engine&rsquo;s echoes rang,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their elders said: &ldquo;There  is work ahead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they send for the flying  gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then across the miles of the saltbush  plain<br>
  That gleamed with the morning dew,<br>
  Where the grasses waved like the ripening grain<br>
  The pilot engine flew,<br>
  A fiery rush in the open bush<br>
  Where the grade marks seemed to fly,<br>
  And the order sped on the wires ahead,<br>
  The pilot&nbsp;<i>must</i>&nbsp;go by.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor&rsquo;s special must  stand aside,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fast express go hang,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your orders be that the  line is free<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the boys of the flying  gang.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ShearingatCastlereagh"></a>Shearing at Castlereagh</h2>
<p>The bell&nbsp;is set a-ringing,  and the engine gives a toot,<br>
  There&rsquo;s five and thirty shearers here are  shearing for the loot,<br>
  So stir yourselves, you penners-up, and shove  the sheep along&mdash;<br>
  The musterers are fetching them a hundred  thousand strong,<br>
  And make your collie dogs speak up&mdash;what would  the buyers say<br>
  In London if the wool was late this year from  Castlereagh? </p>
<p>The man that &ldquo;rung&rdquo; the Tubbo shed is not  the ringer here,<br>
  That stripling from the Cooma side can teach him how to shear.<br>
  They trim away the ragged locks, and rip the cutter goes,<br>
  And leaves a track of snowy fleece from brisket to the nose;<br>
  It&rsquo;s lovely how they peel it off with never stop nor stay,<br>
  They&rsquo;re racing for the ringer&rsquo;s place this year at Castlereagh.</p>
<p>The man that keeps the cutters sharp is  growling in his cage,<br>
  He&rsquo;s always in a hurry and he&rsquo;s always in a rage&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;You clumsy-fisted mutton-heads, you&rsquo;d turn a fellow sick,<br>
  You pass yourselves as shearers, you were born to swing a pick.<br>
  Another broken cutter here, that&rsquo;s two you&rsquo;ve broke to-day,<br>
  It&rsquo;s awful how such crawlers come to shear at Castlereagh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youngsters picking up the fleece enjoy  the merry din,<br>
  They throw the classer up the fleece, he throws it to the bin;<br>
  The pressers standing by the rack are waiting for the wool,<br>
  There&rsquo;s room for just a couple more, the press is nearly full;<br>
  Now jump upon the lever, lads, and heave and heave away,<br>
  Another bale of golden fleece is branded &ldquo;Castlereagh&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheWindsMessage"></a>The Wind&rsquo;s Message</h2>
<p>There&nbsp;came a whisper  down the Bland between the dawn and dark,<br>
  Above the tossing of the pines, above the  river&rsquo;s flow;<br>
  It stirred the boughs of giant gums and  stalwart ironbark;<br>
  It drifted where the wild ducks played amid  the swamps below;<br>
  It brought a breath of mountain air from off  the hills of pine,<br>
  A scent of eucalyptus trees in honey-laden  bloom;<br>
  And drifting, drifting far away along the  southern line<br>
  It caught from leaf and grass and fern a  subtle strange perfume.</p>
<p>It reached the toiling city folk, but few  there were that heard&mdash;<br>
  The rattle of their busy life had choked the whisper down;<br>
  And some but caught a fresh-blown breeze with scent of pine that stirred<br>
  A thought of blue hills far away beyond the smoky town;<br>
  And others heard the whisper pass, but could not understand<br>
  The magic of the breeze&rsquo;s breath that set their hearts aglow,<br>
  Nor how the roving wind could bring across the Overland<br>
  A sound of voices silent now and songs of long ago.</p>
<p>But some that heard the whisper clear were  filled with vague unrest;<br>
  The breeze had brought its message home, they could not fixed abide;<br>
  Their fancies wandered all the day towards the blue hills&rsquo; breast,<br>
  Towards the sunny slopes that lie along the riverside,<br>
  The mighty rolling western plains are very fair to see,<br>
  Where waving to the passing breeze the silver myalls stand,<br>
  But fairer are the giant hills, all rugged though they be,<br>
  From which the two great rivers rise that run along the Bland.</p>
<p>Oh! rocky range and rugged spur and river  running clear,<br>
  That swings around the sudden bends with swirl of snow-white foam,<br>
  Though we, your sons, are far away, we sometimes seem to hear<br>
  The message that the breezes bring to call the wanderers home.<br>
  The mountain peaks are white with snow that feeds a thousand rills,<br>
  Along the river banks the maize grows tall on virgin land,<br>
  And we shall live to see once more those sunny southern hills,<br>
  And strike once more the bridle track that leads along the Bland.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="JohnsonsAntidote"></a>Johnson&rsquo;s Antidote</h2>
<p>Down&nbsp;along the  Snakebite River, where the overlanders camp,<br>
  Where the serpents are in millions, all of the  most deadly stamp;<br>
  Where the station-cook in terror, nearly every  time he bakes,<br>
  Mixes up among the doughboys half-a-dozen  poison-snakes:<br>
  Where the wily free-selector walks in  armour-plated pants,<br>
  And defies the stings of scorpions, and the  bites of bull-dog ants:<br>
  Where the adder and the viper tear each other  by the throat,&mdash;<br>
  There it was that William Johnson sought his  snake-bite antidote. </p>
<p>Johnson was a free-selector, and his brain  went rather queer,<br>
  For the constant sight of serpents filled him with a deadly fear;<br>
  So he tramped his free-selection, morning, afternoon, and night,<br>
  Seeking for some great specific that would cure the serpent&rsquo;s bite.<br>
  Till King Billy, of the Mooki, chieftain of the flour-bag head,<br>
  Told him, &ldquo;Spos&rsquo;n snake bite pfeller, pfeller mostly drop down dead;<br>
  Spos&rsquo;n snake bite old goanna, then you watch a while you see,<br>
  Old goanna cure himself with eating little pfeller tree.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the cure,&rdquo; said William Johnson, &ldquo;point me out this plant sublime,&rdquo;<br>
  But King Billy, feeling lazy, said he&rsquo;d go another time.<br>
  Thus it came to pass that Johnson, having got the tale by rote,<br>
  Followed every stray goanna, seeking for the antidote.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>Loafing once beside the river, while he  thought his heart would break,<br>
  There he saw a big goanna fighting with a tiger-snake,<br>
  In and out they rolled and wriggled, bit each other, heart and soul,<br>
  Till the valiant old goanna swallowed his opponent whole.<br>
  Breathless, Johnson sat and watched him, saw him struggle up the bank,<br>
  Saw him nibbling at the branches of some bushes, green and rank;<br>
  Saw him, happy and contented, lick his lips, as off he crept,<br>
  While the bulging in his stomach showed where his opponent slept.<br>
  Then a cheer of exultation burst aloud from Johnson&rsquo;s throat;<br>
  &ldquo;Luck at last,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve struck it! &rsquo;tis the famous antidote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, the Grand Elixir, greatest  blessing ever known,&mdash;<br>
  Twenty thousand men in India  die each year of snakes alone.<br>
  Think of all the foreign nations, negro, chow, and blackamoor,<br>
  Saved from sudden expiration, by my wondrous snakebite cure.<br>
  It will bring me fame and fortune! In the happy days to be,<br>
  Men of every clime and nation will be round to gaze on me&mdash;<br>
  Scientific men in thousands, men of mark and men of note,<br>
  Rushing down the Mooki   River, after Johnson&rsquo;s  antidote.<br>
  It will cure&nbsp;<i>delirium tremens</i>, when the patient&rsquo;s eyeballs stare<br>
  At imaginary spiders, snakes which really are not there.<br>
  When he thinks he sees them wriggle, when he thinks he sees them bloat,<br>
  It will cure him just to think of Johnson&rsquo;s Snakebite Antidote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he rushed to the museum, found a  scientific man&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Trot me out a deadly serpent, just the deadliest you can;<br>
  I intend to let him bite me, all the risk I will endure,<br>
  Just to prove the sterling value of my wondrous snakebite cure.<br>
  Even though an adder bit me, back to life again I&rsquo;d float;<br>
  Snakes are out of date, I tell you, since I&rsquo;ve found the antidote.&rdquo;<br>
  Said the scientific person, &ldquo;If you really want to die,<br>
  Go ahead&mdash;but, if you&rsquo;re doubtful, let your sheep-dog have a try.<br>
  Get a pair of dogs and try it, let the snake give both a nip;<br>
  Give your dog the snakebite mixture, let the other fellow rip;<br>
  If he dies and yours survives him, then it proves the thing is good.<br>
  Will you fetch your dog and try it?&rdquo; Johnson rather thought he would.<br>
  So he went and fetched his canine, hauled him forward by the throat.<br>
  &ldquo;Stump, old man,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll show them we&rsquo;ve the genwine antidote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the dogs were duly loaded with the  poison-gland&rsquo;s contents;<br>
  Johnson gave his dog the mixture, then sat down to wait events.<br>
  &ldquo;Mark,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in twenty minutes Stump&rsquo;ll be a-rushing round,<br>
  While the other wretched creature lies a corpse upon the ground.&rdquo;<br>
  But, alas for William Johnson! ere they&rsquo;d watched a half-hour&rsquo;s spell<br>
  Stumpy was as dead as mutton, t&rsquo;other dog was live and well.<br>
  And the scientific person hurried off with utmost speed,<br>
  Tested Johnson&rsquo;s drug and found it was a deadly poison-weed;<br>
  Half a tumbler killed an emu, half a spoonful killed a goat,<br>
  All the snakes on earth were harmless to that awful antidote.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>Down along the Mooki River, on the  overlanders&rsquo; camp,<br>
  Where the serpents are in millions, all of the most deadly stamp,<br>
  Wanders, daily, William Johnson, down among those poisonous hordes,<br>
  Shooting every stray goanna, calls them &ldquo;black and yaller frauds&rdquo;.<br>
  And King Billy, of the Mooki, cadging for the cast-off coat,<br>
  Somehow seems to dodge the subject of the snake-bite antidote.</p>

  To fierce endeavour.<br>
  In the restless days and the sleepless nights<br>
  I urge thee ever.</p>
<p>Thou shalt wake from sleep with a startled  cry,<br>
  In fright upleaping<br>
  At a rival&rsquo;s step as it passes by<br>
  Whilst thou art sleeping.</p>
<p>Honour and truth shall be overthrown<br>
  In fierce desire;<br>
  Thou shalt use thy friend as a stepping-stone<br>
  To mount thee higher.</p>
<p>When the curtain falls on the sordid  strife<br>
  That seemed so splendid,<br>
  Thou shalt look with pain on the wasted life<br>
  That thou hast ended.</p>
<p>Thou hast sold thy life for a guerdon  small<br>
  In fitful flashes;<br>
  There has been reward&mdash;but the end of all<br>
  Is dust and ashes.</p>
<p>For the night has come and it brings to  naught<br>
  Thy projects cherished,<br>
  And thine epitaph shall in brass be wrought&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;He lived and perished.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>Art</b><b> </b></p>
<p>I wait for thee at the outer gate,<br>
  My love, mine only;<br>
  Wherefore tarriest thou so late<br>
  While I am lonely.</p>
<p>Thou shalt seek my side with a footstep  swift,<br>
  In thee implanted<br>
  Is the love of Art and the greatest gift<br>
  That God has granted.</p>
<p>And the world&rsquo;s concerns with its rights  and wrongs<br>
  Shall seem but small things&mdash;<br>
  Poet or painter, a singer of songs,<br>
  Thine art is all things.</p>
<p>For the wine of life is a woman&rsquo;s love<br>
  To keep beside thee;<br>
  But the love of Art is a thing above&mdash;<br>
  A star to guide thee.</p>
<p>As the years go by with thy love of Art<br>
  All undiminished,<br>
  Thou shalt end thy days with a quiet heart&mdash;<br>
  Thy work is finished.</p>
<p>So the painter fashions a picture strong<br>
  That fadeth never,<br>
  And the singer singeth a wond&rsquo;rous song<br>
  That lives for ever.</p>

<p>The daylight&nbsp;is dying<br>
  Away in the west,<br>
  The wild birds are flying<br>
  In silence to rest;<br>
  In leafage and frondage<br>
  Where shadows are deep,<br>
  They pass to its bondage&mdash;<br>
  The kingdom of sleep.<br>
  And watched in their sleeping<br>
  By stars in the height,<br>
  They rest in your keeping,<br>
  Oh, wonderful night.</p>
<p>When night doth her glories<br>
  Of starshine unfold,<br>
  &rsquo;Tis then that the stories<br>
  Of bush-land are told.<br>
  Unnumbered I hold them<br>
  In memories bright,<br>
  But who could unfold them,<br>
  Or read them aright?<br>
  Beyond all denials<br>
  The stars in their glories<br>
  The breeze in the myalls<br>
  Are part of these stories.<br>
  The waving of grasses,<br>
  The song of the river<br>
  That sings as it passes<br>
  For ever and ever,<br>
  The hobble-chains&rsquo; rattle,<br>
  The calling of birds,<br>
  The lowing of cattle<br>
  Must blend with the words.<br>
  Without these, indeed, you<br>
  Would find it ere long,<br>
  As though I should read you<br>
  The words of a song<br>
  That lamely would linger<br>
  When lacking the rune,<br>
  The voice of the singer,<br>
  The lilt of the tune.</p>
<p>But, as one half-hearing<br>
  An old-time refrain,<br>
  With memory clearing,<br>
  Recalls it again,<br>
  These tales, roughly wrought of<br>
  The bush and its ways,<br>
  May call back a thought of<br>
  The wandering days,<br>
  And, blending with each<br>
  In the memories that throng,<br>
  There haply shall reach<br>
  You some echo of song.</p>

<p>So&nbsp;you&rsquo;re back from  up the country, Mister Townsman, where you went,<br>
  And you&rsquo;re cursing all the business in a  bitter discontent;<br>
  Well, we grieve to disappoint you, and it  makes us sad to hear<br>
  That it wasn&rsquo;t cool and shady&mdash;and there wasn&rsquo;t  plenty beer,<br>
  And the loony bullock snorted when you first  came into view;<br>
  Well, you know it&rsquo;s not so often that he sees  a swell like you;<br>
  And the roads were hot and dusty, and the  plains were burnt and brown,<br>
  And no doubt you&rsquo;re better suited drinking  lemon-squash in town.<br>
  Yet, perchance, if you should journey down the  very track you went<br>
  In a month or two at furthest you would wonder  what it meant,<br>
  Where the sunbaked earth was gasping like a  creature in its pain<br>
  You would find the grasses waving like a field  of summer grain,<br>
  And the miles of thirsty gutters blocked with  sand and choked with mud,<br>
  You would find them mighty rivers with a  turbid, sweeping flood;<br>
  For the rain and drought and sunshine make no  changes in the street,<br>
  In the sullen line of buildings and the  ceaseless tramp of feet;<br>
  But the bush hath moods and changes, as the  seasons rise and fall,<br>
  And the men who know the bush-land&mdash;they are  loyal through it all. </p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>But you found the bush was dismal and a  land of no delight,<br>
  Did you chance to hear a chorus in the shearers&rsquo; huts at night?<br>
  Did they &ldquo;rise up, William Riley&rdquo; by the camp-fire&rsquo;s cheery blaze?<br>
  Did they rise him as we rose him in the good old droving days?<br>
  And the women of the homesteads and the men you chanced to meet&mdash;<br>
  Were their faces sour and saddened like the &ldquo;faces in the street&rdquo;,<br>
  And the &ldquo;shy selector children&rdquo;&mdash;were they better now or worse<br>
  Than the little city urchins who would greet you with a curse?<br>
  Is not such a life much better than the squalid street and square<br>
  Where the fallen women flaunt it in the fierce electric glare,<br>
  Where the sempstress plies her sewing till her eyes are sore and red<br>
  In a filthy, dirty attic toiling on for daily bread?<br>
  Did you hear no sweeter voices in the music of the bush<br>
  Than the roar of trams and &rsquo;buses, and the war-whoop of &ldquo;the push?&rdquo;<br>
  Did the magpies rouse your slumbers with their carol sweet and strange?<br>
  Did you hear the silver chiming of the bell-birds on the range?<br>
  But, perchance, the wild birds&rsquo; music by your senses was despised,<br>
  For you say you&rsquo;ll stay in townships till the bush is civilised.<br>
  Would you make it a tea-garden and on Sundays have a band<br>
  Where the &ldquo;blokes&rdquo; might take their &ldquo;donahs&rdquo;, with a &ldquo;public&rdquo; close at hand?<br>
  You had better stick to Sydney  and make merry with the &ldquo;push,&rdquo;<br>
  For the bush will never suit you, and you&rsquo;ll never suit the bush.</p>

<p>Oh, the new-chum went to  the back block run,<br>
  But he should have gone there last week.<br>
  He tramped ten miles with a loaded gun,<br>
  But of turkey or duck he saw never a one,<br>
  For he should have been there last week,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said,<br>
  There were flocks of &rsquo;em there last week. </p>
<p>He wended his way to a waterfall,<br>
  And he should have gone there last week.<br>
  He carried a camera, legs and all,<br>
  But the day was hot, and the stream was small,<br>
  For he should have gone there last week,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said.<br>
  They drowned a man there last week.</p>
<p>He went for a drive, and he made a start,<br>
  Which should have been made last week,<br>
  For the old horse died of a broken heart;<br>
  So he footed it home and he dragged the cart&mdash;<br>
  But the horse was all right last week,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said.<br>
  He trotted a match last week.</p>
<p>So he asked the bushies who came from far<br>
  To visit the town last week,<br>
  If they&rsquo;d dine with him, and they said &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;<br>
  But there wasn&rsquo;t a drop in the whisky jar&mdash;<br>
  You should have been here last week,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said,<br>
  I drank it all up last week!</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="ThoseNames"></a>Those Names</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;shearers  sat in the firelight, hearty and hale and strong,<br>
  After the hard day&rsquo;s shearing, passing the  joke along:<br>
  The &ldquo;ringer&rdquo; that shore a hundred, as they  never were shorn before,<br>
  And the novice who, toiling bravely, had  tommy-hawked half a score,<br>
  The tarboy, the cook, and the slushy, the  sweeper that swept the board,<br>
  The picker-up, and the penner, with the rest  of the shearing horde.<br>
  There were men from the inland stations where  the skies like a furnace glow,<br>
  And men from the Snowy  River, the land of the frozen snow;<br>
  There were swarthy Queensland  drovers who reckoned all land by miles,<br>
  And farmers&rsquo; sons from the Murray, where many a vineyard smiles.<br>
  They started at telling stories when they  wearied of cards and games,<br>
  And to give these stories a flavour they threw  in some local names,<br>
  And a man from the bleak Monaro, away on the  tableland,<br>
  He fixed his eyes on the ceiling, and he  started to play his hand.<br>
  He told them of Adjintoothbong, where the  pine-clad mountains freeze,<br>
  And the weight of the snow in summer breaks  branches off the trees,<br>
  And, as he warmed to the business, he let them  have it strong&mdash;<br>
  Nimitybelle, Conargo, Wheeo, Bongongolong;<br>
  He lingered over them fondly, because they  recalled to mind<br>
  A thought of the old bush homestead, and the  girl that he left behind.<br>
  Then the shearers all sat silent till a man in  the corner rose;<br>
  Said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve travelled a-plenty but never  heard names like those.<br>
  Out in the western districts, out on the  Castlereagh<br>
  Most of the names are easy&mdash;short for a man to  say.</p>
<p><br>
  You&rsquo;ve heard of Mungrybambone and the  Gundabluey pine,<br>
  Quobbotha, Girilambone, and Terramungamine,<br>
  Quambone, Eunonyhareenyha, Wee Waa, and  Buntijo&mdash;&rdquo;<br>
  But the rest of the shearers stopped him: &ldquo;For  the sake of your jaw, go slow,<br>
  If you reckon those names are short ones out  where such names prevail,<br>
  Just try and remember some long ones before  you begin the tale.&rdquo;<br>
  And the man from the western district, though  never a word he said,<br>
  Just winked with his dexter eyelid, and then  he retired to bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ABushChristening"></a>A Bush Christening</h2>
<p>On&nbsp;the outer Barcoo  where the churches are few,<br>
  And men of religion are scanty,<br>
  On a road never cross&rsquo;d &rsquo;cept by folk that are  lost,<br>
  One Michael Magee had a shanty. </p>
<p>Now this Mike was the dad of a ten year  old lad,<br>
  Plump, healthy, and stoutly conditioned;<br>
  He was strong as the best, but poor Mike had no rest<br>
  For the youngster had never been christened.</p>
<p>And his wife used to cry, &ldquo;If the darlin&rsquo;  should die<br>
  Saint Peter would not recognise him.&rdquo;<br>
  But by luck he survived till a preacher arrived,<br>
  Who agreed straightaway to baptise him.</p>
<p>Now the artful young rogue, while they  held their collogue,<br>
  With his ear to the keyhole was listenin&rsquo;,<br>
  And he muttered in fright, while his features turned white,<br>
  &nbsp;&ldquo;What the divil and all is this christenin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was none of your dolts, he had seen  them brand colts,<br>
  And it seemed to his small understanding,<br>
  If the man in the frock made him one of the flock,<br>
  It must mean something very like branding.</p>
<p>So away with a rush he set off for the  bush,<br>
  While the tears in his eyelids they glistened&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis outrageous,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to brand youngsters like me,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll be dashed if I&rsquo;ll stop to be christened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a young native dog he ran into a log,<br>
  And his father with language uncivil,<br>
  Never heeding the &ldquo;praste&rdquo; cried aloud in his haste,<br>
  &ldquo;Come out and be christened, you divil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he lay there as snug as a bug in a  rug,<br>
  And his parents in vain might reprove him,<br>
  Till his reverence spoke (he was fond of a joke)<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a notion,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll move him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poke a stick up the log, give the  spalpeen a prog;<br>
  Poke him aisy&mdash;don&rsquo;t hurt him or maim him,<br>
  &rsquo;Tis not long that he&rsquo;ll stand, I&rsquo;ve the water at hand,<br>
  As he rushes out this end I&rsquo;ll name him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes, and for shame! ye&rsquo;ve  forgotten the name&mdash;<br>
  Is it Patsy or Michael or Dinnis?&rdquo;<br>
  Here the youngster ran out, and the priest gave a shout&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Take your chance, anyhow, wid &lsquo;Maginnis&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the howling young cub ran away to the  scrub<br>
  Where he knew that pursuit would be risky,<br>
  The priest, as he fled, flung a flask at his head<br>
  That was labelled &ldquo;Maginnis&rsquo;s Whisky&rdquo;!</p>
<p>And Maginnis Magee has been made a J.P.,<br>
  And the one thing he hates more than sin is<br>
  To be asked by the folk, who have heard of the joke,<br>
  How he came to be christened Maginnis!</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="HowtheFavouriteBeatUs"></a>How the Favourite Beat Us</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo;&nbsp;said the boozer,  &ldquo;I tell you it&rsquo;s true, sir,<br>
  I once was a punter with plenty of pelf,<br>
  But gone is my glory, I&rsquo;ll tell you the story<br>
  How I stiffened my horse and got stiffened  myself. </p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a mare called the Cracker, I came  down to back her,<br>
  But found she was favourite all of a rush,<br>
  The folk just did pour on to lay six to four on,<br>
  And several bookies were killed in the crush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems old Tomato was stiff, though a  starter;<br>
  They reckoned him fit for the Caulfield to keep.<br>
  The Bloke and the Donah were scratched by their owner,&mdash;<br>
  He only was offered three-fourths of the sweep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knew Salamander was slow as a gander,<br>
  The mare could have beat him the length of the straight,<br>
  And old Manumission was out of condition,<br>
  And most of the others were running off weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt someone &lsquo;blew it&rsquo;, for everyone  knew it,<br>
  The bets were all gone, and I muttered in spite<br>
  &lsquo;If I can&rsquo;t get a copper, by Jingo, I&rsquo;ll stop her,<br>
  Let the public fall in, it will serve the brutes right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said to the jockey, &lsquo;Now, listen, my  cocky,<br>
  You watch as you&rsquo;re cantering down by the stand,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll wait where that toff is and give you the office,<br>
  You&rsquo;re only to win if I lift up my hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I then tried to back her&mdash;&lsquo;What price is  the Cracker?&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;Our books are all full, sir,&rsquo; each bookie did swear;<br>
  My mind, then, I made up, my fortune I played up<br>
  I bet every shilling against my own mare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I strolled to the gateway, the mare in  the straightway<br>
  Was shifting and dancing, and pawing the ground,<br>
  The boy saw me enter and wheeled for his canter,<br>
  When a darned great mosquito came buzzing around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They breed &rsquo;em at Hexham, it&rsquo;s risky to  vex &rsquo;em,<br>
  They suck a man dry at a sitting, no doubt,<br>
  But just as the mare passed, he fluttered my hair past,<br>
  I lifted my hand, and I flattened him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was stunned when they started, the mare  simply darted<br>
  Away to the front when the flag was let fall,<br>
  For none there could match her, and none tried to catch her&mdash;<br>
  She finished a furlong in front of them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet that I went for the boy, whom I  sent for<br>
  The moment he weighed and came out of the stand&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Who paid you to win it? Come, own up this minute.&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;Lord love yer,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;why you lifted your hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas true, by St. Peter, that cursed  &lsquo;muskeeter&rsquo;<br>
  Had broke me so broke that I hadn&rsquo;t a brown,<br>
  And you&rsquo;ll find the best course is when dealing with horses<br>
  To win when you&rsquo;re able, and&nbsp;<i>keep your hands down</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  Gude Faith! They made the whisky fly,<br>

<p>&ldquo;Has sair misfortune cursed your life<br>

  Is harm upon your bonny wife,<br>

  McThirst upraised his head:<br>
  &ldquo;My bairns hae done the deed of shame&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twere better they were dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think my bonny infant son<br>

<p>As I pondered very weary  o&rsquo;er a volume long and dreary&mdash;<br>
  For the plot was void of interest&mdash;&rsquo;twas the  Postal Guide, in fact,&mdash;<br>
  There I learnt the true location, distance,  size, and population<br>
  Of each township, town, and village in the  radius of the Act. </p>
<p>And I learnt that Puckawidgee stands  beside the Murrumbidgee,<br>
  And that Booleroi and Bumble get their letters twice a year,<br>
  Also that the post inspector, when he visited Collector,<br>
  Closed the office up instanter, and re-opened Dungalear.</p>
<p>But my languid mood forsook me, when I  found a name that took me,<br>
  Quite by chance I came across it&mdash;&ldquo;Come-by-Chance&rdquo; was what I read;<br>
  No location was assigned it, not a thing to help one find it,<br>
  Just an N which stood for northward, and the rest was all unsaid.</p>
<p>I shall leave my home, and forthward  wander stoutly to the northward<br>
  Till I come by chance across it, and I&rsquo;ll straightway settle down,<br>
  For there can&rsquo;t be any hurry, nor the slightest cause for worry<br>
  Where the telegraph don&rsquo;t reach you nor the railways run to town.</p>
<p>And one&rsquo;s letters and exchanges come by  chance across the ranges,<br>
  Where a wiry young Australian leads a pack-horse once a week,<br>
  And the good news grows by keeping, and you&rsquo;re spared the pain of weeping<br>
  Over bad news when the mailman drops the letters in the creek.</p>
<p>But I fear, and more&rsquo;s the pity, that  there&rsquo;s really no such city,<br>
  For there&rsquo;s not a man can find it of the shrewdest folk I know,<br>
  &ldquo;Come-by-chance&rdquo;, be sure it never means a land of fierce endeavour,&mdash;<br>
  It is just the careless country where the dreamers only go.</p>

  All that makes our life worth living comes unstriven for and free;<br>

  Deals him out his pain or pleasure, careless what his worth may be.</p>
<p>All the happy times entrancing, days of  sport and nights of dancing,<br>
  Moonlit rides and stolen kisses, pouting lips and loving glance:<br>
  When you think of these be certain you have looked behind the curtain,<br>

  Ship him away to the bush of course,<br>
  Ne&rsquo;er-do-well fellows are easily spared;<br>
  Only of women a tolerable few<br>
  Sorrowed at parting with Jim Carew.</p>
<p>Gentleman Jim on the cattle camp,<br>
  Sitting his horse with an easy grace;<br>
  But the reckless living has left its stamp<br>
  In the deep drawn lines of that handsome face,<br>
  And a harder look in those eyes of blue:<br>
  Prompt at a quarrel is Jim Carew.</p>
<p>Billy the Lasher was out for gore&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;Twelve-stone navvy with chest of hair,<br>
  When he opened out with a hungry roar<br>
  On a ten-stone man it was hardly fair;<br>
  But his wife was wise if his face she knew<br>
  By the time you were done with him, Jim Carew.</p>
<p>Gentleman Jim in the stockmen&rsquo;s hut<br>
  Works with them, toils with them, side by side;<br>
  As to his past&mdash;well, his lips are shut.<br>
  &ldquo;Gentleman once,&rdquo; say his mates with pride;<br>
  And the wildest Cornstalk can ne&rsquo;er outdo<br>
  In feats of recklessness, Jim Carew.</p>
<p>What should he live for? A dull despair!<br>
  Drink is his master and drags him down,<br>
  Water of Lethe that drowns all care.<br>
  Gentleman Jim has a lot to drown,<br>
  And he reigns as king with a drunken crew,<br>
  Sinking to misery, Jim Carew.</p>
<p>Such is the end of the ne&rsquo;er-do-well&mdash;<br>
  Jimmy the Boozer, all down at heel;<br>
  But he straightens up when he&rsquo;s asked to tell<br>
  His name and race, and a flash of steel<br>
  Still lightens up in those eyes of blue&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;I am, or&mdash;no, I&nbsp;<i>was</i>&mdash;Jim Carew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheSwagmansRest"></a>The Swagman&rsquo;s Rest</h2>
<p>We buried old Bob where  the bloodwoods wave<br>
  At the foot of the Eaglehawk;<br>
  We fashioned a cross on the old man&rsquo;s grave,<br>
  For fear that his ghost might walk;<br>
  We carved his name on a bloodwood tree,<br>
  With the date of his sad decease,<br>
  And in place of &ldquo;Died from effects of spree,&rdquo;<br>
  We wrote &ldquo;May he rest in peace.&rdquo; </p>
<p>For Bob was known on the Overland,<br>
  A regular old bush wag,<br>
  Tramping along in the dust and sand,<br>
  Humping his well-worn swag.<br>
  He would camp for days in the river-bed,<br>
  And loiter and &ldquo;fish for whales&rdquo;.<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m into the swagman&rsquo;s yard,&rdquo; he said,<br>
  &nbsp;&ldquo;And I never shall find the rails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he found the rails on that summer  night<br>
  For a better place&mdash;or worse,<br>
  As we watched by turns in the flickering light<br>
  With an old black gin for nurse.<br>
  The breeze came in with the scent of pine,<br>
  The river sounded clear,<br>
  When a change came on, and we saw the sign<br>
  That told us the end was near.</p>
<p>But he spoke in a cultured voice and low&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;I fancy they&rsquo;ve &lsquo;sent the route&rsquo;;<br>
  I once was an army man, you know,<br>
  Though now I&rsquo;m a drunken brute;<br>
  But bury me out where the bloodwoods wave,<br>
  And if ever you&rsquo;re fairly stuck,<br>
  Just take and shovel me out of the grave<br>
  And, maybe, I&rsquo;ll bring you luck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I&rsquo;ve always heard&mdash;&rdquo; here his voice  fell weak,<br>
  His strength was well-nigh sped,<br>
  He gasped and struggled and tried to speak,<br>
  Then fell in a moment&mdash;dead.<br>
  Thus ended a wasted life and hard,<br>
  Of energies misapplied&mdash;<br>
  Old Bob was out of the &ldquo;swagman&rsquo;s yard&rdquo;<br>
  And over the Great Divide.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>The drought came down on the field and  flock,<br>
  And never a raindrop fell,<br>
  Though the tortured moans of the starving stock<br>
  Might soften a fiend from hell.<br>
  And we thought of the hint that the swagman gave<br>
  When he went to the Great Unseen&mdash;<br>
  We shovelled the skeleton out of the grave<br>
  To see what his hint might mean.</p>
<p>We dug where the cross and the grave posts  were,<br>
  We shovelled away the mould,<br>
  When sudden a vein of quartz lay bare<br>
  All gleaming with yellow gold.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a reef with never a fault nor baulk<br>
  That ran from the range&rsquo;s crest,<br>
  And the richest mine on the Eaglehawk<br>
Is known as &ldquo;The Swagman&rsquo;s Rest.&rdquo;</p>
