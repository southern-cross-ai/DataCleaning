  <h2 align="center"><a name="RioGrandesLastRace"></a>Rio Grande's Last Race </h2>
  <p>Now&nbsp;this was what Macpherson told<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While waiting in the  stand;<br>
    A reckless rider, over-bold,<br>
    The only man with hands to hold<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rushing Rio Grande. </p>
  <p>He said, &ldquo;This  day I bid good-bye<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bit and bridle rein,<br>
    To ditches deep and fences high,<br>
    For I have dreamed a dream, and I<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall never ride again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dreamt last  night I rode this race<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I today must ride,<br>
    And cantering down to take my place<br>
    I saw full many an old friend&rsquo;s face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come stealing to my side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead men on  horses long since dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They clustered on the track;<br>
    The champions of the days long fled,<br>
    They moved around with noiseless tread&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bay, chestnut, brown, and black.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And one man on  a big grey steed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode up and waved his hand;<br>
    Said he, &lsquo;We help a friend in need,<br>
    And we have come to give a lead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To you and Rio    Grande.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For you must  give the field the slip;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So never draw the rein,<br>
    But keep him moving with the whip,<br>
    And, if he falter, set your lip<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rouse him up again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But when you  reach the big stone wall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down your bridle-hand<br>
    And let him sail&mdash;he cannot fall&mdash;<br>
    But don&rsquo;t you interfere at all;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You trust old Rio    Grande.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We started, and  in front we showed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big horse running free:<br>
    Right fearlessly and game he strode,<br>
    And by my side those dead men rode<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom no one else could see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As silently as  flies a bird,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rode on either hand;<br>
    At every fence I plainly heard<br>
    The phantom leader give the word,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Make room for Rio    Grande!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I spurred him  on to get the lead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chanced full  many a fall;<br>
    But swifter still each phantom steed<br>
    Kept with me, and at racing speed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reached the big stone wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And there the  phantoms on each side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew in and blocked his leap;<br>
  &lsquo;Make room! make room!&rsquo; I loudly cried,<br>
    But right in front they seemed to ride&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cursed them in my sleep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He never flinched,  he faced it game,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struck it with his chest,<br>
    And every stone burst out in flame&mdash;<br>
    And Rio Grande and I became<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phantoms among the rest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then I  woke, and for a space<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All nerveless did I seem;<br>
    For I have ridden many a race<br>
    But never one at such a pace<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in that fearful dream.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I am sure  as man can be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That out upon the track<br>
    Those phantoms that men cannot see<br>
    Are waiting now to ride with me;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall not come back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For I must ride  the dead men&rsquo;s race,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And follow their command;<br>
  &rsquo;Twere worse than death, the foul disgrace<br>
    If I should fear to take my place<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today on Rio    Grande.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He mounted, and  a jest he threw,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With never sign of gloom;<br>
    But all who heard the story knew<br>
    That Jack Macpherson, brave and true,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was going to his doom.</p>
  <p>They started,  and the big black steed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came flashing past the stand;<br>
    All single-handed in the lead<br>
    He strode along at racing speed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty Rio    Grande.</p>
  <p>But on his ribs  the whalebone stung,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A madness, sure, it seemed!<br>
    And soon it rose on every tongue<br>
    That Jack Macpherson rode among<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creatures he had dreamed.</p>
  <p>He looked to  left, and looked to right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though men rode beside;<br>
    And Rio Grande, with foam-flecks white,<br>
    Raced at his jumps in headlong flight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cleared them in his stride.</p>
  <p>But when they  reached the big stone wall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down went the bridle-hand,<br>
    And loud we heard Macpherson call<br>
  &ldquo;Make room, or half the field will fall!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make room for Rio    Grande!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s down! he&rsquo;s  down!&rdquo; And horse and man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay quiet side by side!<br>
    No need the pallid face to scan,<br>
    We knew with Rio Grande  he ran<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The race the dead men ride.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="BytheGreyGulfWater"></a>By the Grey Gulf-Water</h2>
  <p>Far&nbsp;to the Northward  there lies a land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wonderful land that  the winds blow over,<br>
    And none may fathom or understand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charm it holds for  the restless rover;<br>
    A great grey chaos&mdash;a land half made,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where endless space is  and no life stirreth;<br>
    There the soul of a man will recoil afraid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sphinx-like  visage that Nature weareth.<br>
    But old Dame Nature, though scornful, craves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dole of death and  her share of slaughter;<br>
    Many indeed are the nameless graves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where her victims  sleep by the Grey Gulf-water. </p>
  <p>Slowly and slowly those grey streams  glide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting along with a languid motion,<br>
    Lapping the reed-beds on either side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wending their way to the North Ocean.<br>
    Grey are the plains where the emus pass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent and slow, with their staid demeanour;<br>
    Over the dead men&rsquo;s graves the grass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe is waving a trifle greener.<br>
    Down in the world where men toil and spin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dame Nature smiles as man&rsquo;s hand has taught her;<br>
    Only the dead men her smiles can win<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great lone land by the Grey Gulf-water.</p>
  <p>For the strength of man is an insect&rsquo;s  strength<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of that mighty plain and river,<br>
    And the life of a man is a moment&rsquo;s length<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the life of the stream that will run for ever.<br>
    And so it cometh that they take no part<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In small world worries; each hardy rover<br>
    Rides abroad and is light of heart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the plains around and the blue sky over.<br>
    And up in the heavens the brown lark sings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The songs that the strange wild land has taught her;<br>
    Full of thanksgiving her sweet song rings&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I wish I were back by the Grey Gulf-water.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="WiththeCattle"></a>With the Cattle</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;drought  is down on field and flock,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river-bed is dry;<br>
  And we must shift the starving stock<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the cattle die.<br>
  We muster up with weary hearts<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At breaking of the day,<br>
  And turn our heads to foreign parts,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the stock away.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&rsquo;s hunt &rsquo;em up and dog  &rsquo;em,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&rsquo;s get the whip and flog  &rsquo;em,<br>
  For it&rsquo;s weary work, is droving, when they&rsquo;re dying every day;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By stock routes bare and eaten,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On dusty roads and beaten,<br>
  With half a chance to save their lives we take the stock away.</p>
<p>We  cannot use the whip for shame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On beasts that crawl along;<br>
  We have to drop the weak and lame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And try to save the strong;<br>
  The wrath of God is on the track,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drought fiend holds his sway;<br>
  With blows and cries and stockwhip crack<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take the stock away.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they fall we leave them  lying,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the crows to watch them  dying,<br>
  Grim sextons of the Overland that fasten on their prey;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the fiery dust-storm  drifting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mocking mirage  shifting,<br>
  In heat and drought and hopeless pain we take the stock away.</p>
<p>In  dull despair the days go by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With never hope of change,<br>
  But every stage we feel more nigh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant mountain range;<br>
  And some may live to climb the pass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And reach the great plateau,<br>
  And revel in the mountain grass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By streamlets fed with snow.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the mountain wind is blowing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It starts the cattle lowing<br>
  And calling to each other down the dusty long array;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there speaks a grizzled  drover:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, thank God, the worst is  over,<br>
  The creatures smell the mountain grass that&rsquo;s twenty miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They  press towards the mountain grass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look with eager eyes<br>
  Along the rugged stony pass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That slopes towards the skies;<br>
  Their feet may bleed from rocks and stones,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, though the blood-drop starts,<br>
  They struggle on with stifled groans,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hope is in their hearts.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cattle that are  leading,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though their feet are worn and  bleeding,<br>
  Are breaking to a kind of run&mdash;pull up, and let them go!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the mountain wind is  blowing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mountain grass is  growing,<br>
  They&rsquo;ll settle down by running streams ice-cold with melted snow.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>The  days are gone of heat and drought<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the stricken plain;<br>
  The wind has shifted right about,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brought the welcome rain;<br>
  The river runs with sullen roar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All flecked with yellow foam,<br>
  And we must take the road once more<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring the cattle home.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lads! we&rsquo;ll raise a  chorus,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a pleasant trip before  us.&rdquo;<br>
  And the horses bound beneath us as we start them down the track;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the drovers canter,  singing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the sweet green grasses  springing,<br>
  Towards the far-off mountain-land, to bring the cattle back.</p>
<p>Are  these the beasts we brought away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That move so lively now?<br>
  They scatter off like flying spray<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the mountain&rsquo;s brow;<br>
  And dashing down the rugged range<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear the stockwhip crack&mdash;<br>
  Good faith, it is a welcome change<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring such cattle back.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Steady down the lead  there!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em stop and feed  there!&rdquo;<br>
  For they&rsquo;re wild as mountain eagles, and their sides are all afoam;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they&rsquo;re settling down  already,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they&rsquo;ll travel nice and  steady;<br>
  With cheery call and jest and song we fetch the cattle home.</p>
<p>We  have to watch them close at night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear they&rsquo;ll make a rush,<br>
  And break away in headlong flight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the open bush;<br>
  And by the camp-fire&rsquo;s cheery blaze,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With mellow voice and strong,<br>
  We hear the lonely watchman raise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Overlander&rsquo;s song:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;re done with  roving,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the camping and the  droving,<br>
  It&rsquo;s homeward down the Bland we&rsquo;ll go, and never more we&rsquo;ll roam;&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the stars shine out above  us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the eyes of those who love  us&mdash;<br>
  The eyes of those who watch and wait to greet the cattle home.</p>
<p>The  plains are all awave with grass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skies are deepest blue;<br>
  And leisurely the cattle pass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feed the long day through;<br>
  But when we sight the station gate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We make the stockwhips crack,<br>
  A welcome sound to those who wait<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To greet the cattle back:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the twilight  falling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear their voices calling,<br>
  As the cattle splash across the ford and churn it into foam;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the children run to meet  us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our wives and sweethearts  greet us,<br>
  Their heroes from the Overland who brought the cattle home.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheFirstSurveyor"></a>The First Surveyor</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The&nbsp;opening of the  railway line!&mdash;the Governor and all!<br>
  With flags and banners down the street, a  banquet and a ball.<br>
  Hark to &rsquo;em at the station now! They&rsquo;re  raising cheer on cheer!<br>
  &lsquo;The man who brought the railway through&mdash;our  friend the engineer.&rsquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;They cheer&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;pluck and  enterprise and engineering skill!<br>
  &rsquo;Twas my old husband found the pass behind that big red hill.<br>
  Before the engineer was grown we&rsquo;d settled with our stock<br>
  Behind that great big mountain chain, a line of range and rock&mdash;<br>
  A line that kept us starving there in weary weeks of drought,<br>
  With ne&rsquo;er a track across the range to let the cattle out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas then, with horses starved and weak  and scarcely fit to crawl,<br>
  My husband went to find a way across the rocky wall.<br>
  He vanished in the wilderness&mdash;God knows where he was gone<br>
  He hunted till his food gave out, but still he battled on.<br>
  His horses strayed (&rsquo;twas well they did), they made towards the grass,<br>
  And down behind that big red hill they found an easy pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He followed up and blazed the trees, to  show the safest track,<br>
  Then drew his belt another hole and turned and started back.<br>
  His horses died&mdash;just one pulled through with nothing much to spare;<br>
  God bless the beast that brought him home, the old white Arab mare!<br>
  We drove the cattle through the hills, along the new-found way,<br>
  And this was our first camping-ground&mdash;just where I live today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then others came across the range and  built the township here,<br>
  And then there came the railway line and this young engineer;<br>
  He drove about with tents and traps, a cook to cook his meals,<br>
  A bath to wash himself at night, a chain-man at his heels.<br>
  And that was all the pluck and skill for which he&rsquo;s cheered and praised,<br>
  For after all he took the track, the same my husband blazed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor old husband, dead and gone with  never feast nor cheer;<br>
  He&rsquo;s buried by the railway line!&mdash;I wonder can he hear<br>
  When down the very track he marked, and close to where he&rsquo;s laid,<br>
  The cattle trains go roaring down the one-in-thirty grade.<br>
  I wonder does he hear them pass, and can he see the sight<br>
  When through the dark the fast express goes flaming by at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think &rsquo;twould comfort him to know  there&rsquo;s someone left to care;<br>
  I&rsquo;ll take some things this very night and hold a banquet there&mdash;<br>
  The hard old fare we&rsquo;ve often shared together, him and me,<br>
  Some damper and a bite of beef, a pannikin of tea:<br>
  We&rsquo;ll do without the bands and flags, the speeches and the fuss,<br>
  We know who&nbsp;<i>ought</i>&nbsp;to get the cheers&mdash;and that&rsquo;s enough for us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? They wish that I&rsquo;d come  down&mdash;the oldest settler here!<br>
  Present me to the Governor and that young engineer!<br>
  Well, just you tell his Excellence, and put the thing polite,<br>
  I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t come down&mdash;I&rsquo;m dining out tonight!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="MulgaBillsBicycle"></a>Mulga Bill&rsquo;s Bicycle</h2>
<p>&rsquo;Twas&nbsp;Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk, that caught the cycling craze;<br>
  He turned away the good old horse that served him many days;<br>
  He dressed himself in cycling clothes, resplendent to be seen;<br>
  He hurried off to town and bought a shining new machine;<br>
  And as he wheeled it through the door, with air of lordly pride,<br>
  The grinning shop assistant said, &ldquo;Excuse me, can you ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, young man,&rdquo; said Mulga Bill, &ldquo;from Walgett to the sea,<br>
  From Conroy&rsquo;s Gap to Castlereagh, there&rsquo;s none can ride like me.<br>
  I&rsquo;m good all round at everything, as everybody knows,<br>
  Although I&rsquo;m not the one to talk&mdash;I <i>hate</i> a man that blows.<br>
  &ldquo;But riding is my special gift, my chiefest, sole delight;<br>
  Just ask a wild duck can it swim, a wild cat can it fight.<br>
  There&rsquo;s nothing clothed in hair or hide, or built of flesh or steel,<br>
  There&rsquo;s nothing walks or jumps, or runs, on axle, hoof, or wheel,<br>
  But what I&rsquo;ll sit, while hide will hold and girths and straps are tight;<br>
  I&rsquo;ll ride this here two-wheeled concern right straight away at sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk, that sought his own abode,<br>
  That perched above the Dead Man&rsquo;s Creek, beside the mountain road.<br>
  He turned the cycle down the hill and mounted for the fray,<br>
  But ere he&rsquo;d gone a dozen yards it bolted clean away.<br>
  It left the track, and through the trees, just like a silver streak,<br>
  It whistled down the awful slope towards the Dead Man&rsquo;s Creek.</p>
<p>It shaved a stump by half an inch, it dodged a big white-box:<br>
  The very wallaroos in fright went scrambling up the rocks,<br>
  The wombats hiding in their caves dug deeper underground,<br>
  But Mulga Bill, as white as chalk, sat tight to every bound.<br>
  It struck a stone and gave a spring that cleared a fallen tree,<br>
  It raced beside a precipice as close as close could be;<br>
  And then, as Mulga Bill let out one last despairing shriek,<br>
  It made a leap of twenty feet into the Dead Man&rsquo;s Creek.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk, that slowly swam ashore:<br>
  He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some narrer shaves and lively rides before;<br>
  I&rsquo;ve rode a wild bull round a yard to win a five-pound bet,<br>
  But this was sure the derndest ride that I&rsquo;ve encountered yet.<br>
  I&rsquo;ll give that two-wheeled outlaw best; it&rsquo;s shaken all my nerve<br>
  To feel it whistle through the air and plunge and buck and swerve<br>
  It&rsquo;s safe at rest in Dead Man&rsquo;s Creek&mdash;we&rsquo;ll leave it lying still;<br>
  A horse&rsquo;s back is good enough henceforth for Mulga Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="ThePearlDiver"></a>The Pearl Diver</h2>
<p>Kanzo Makame, the diver, sturdy and small Japanee,<br>
  Seeker of pearls and of pearl-shell down in the depths of the sea,<br>
  Trudged o&rsquo;er the bed of the ocean, searching industriously.</p>
<p>Over the pearl-grounds the lugger drifted&mdash;a little white speck:<br>
  Joe Nagasaki, the &ldquo;tender&rdquo;, holding the life-line on deck,<br>
  Talked through the rope to the diver, knew when to drift or to check.</p>
<p>Kanzo was king of his lugger, master and diver in one,<br>
  Diving wherever it pleased him, taking instructions from none;<br>
  Hither and thither he wandered, steering by stars and by sun.</p>
<p>Fearless he was beyond credence, looking at death eye to eye:<br>
  This was his formula always, &ldquo;All man go dead by and by&mdash;<br>
  S&rsquo;posing time come no can help it&mdash;s&rsquo;pose time no come, then no die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dived in the depths of the Darnleys, down twenty fathom and five;<br>
  Down where by law, and by reason, men are forbidden to dive;<br>
  Down in a pressure so awful that only the strongest survive:</p>
<p>Sweated four men at the air pumps, fast as the handles could go,<br>
  Forcing the air down that reached him heated and tainted, and slow&mdash;<br>
  Kanzo Makame the diver stayed seven minutes below;</p>
<p>Came up on deck like a dead man, paralysed body and brain;<br>
  Suffered, while blood was returning, infinite tortures of pain:<br>
  Sailed once again to the Darnleys&mdash;laughed and descended again!</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * *  * * *</b></p>
<p>Scarce grew the shell in the shallows, rarely a patch could they  touch;<br>
  Always the take was so little, always the labour so much;<br>
  Always they thought of the Islands held by the  lumbering Dutch&mdash;</p>
<p>Islands where shell was in plenty lying in passage and bay,<br>
  Islands where divers could gather hundreds of  shell in a day.<br>
  But the lumbering Dutch in their gunboats they hunted the divers away.</p>
<p>Joe Nagasaki, the &ldquo;tender&rdquo;, finding the profits grow small,<br>
  Said, &ldquo;Let us go to the Islands, try for a  number one haul!<br>
  If we get caught, go to prison&mdash;let them take lugger and all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kanzo Makame, the diver&mdash;knowing full well what it meant&mdash;<br>
  Fatalist, gambler, and stoic, smiled a broad smile of content,<br>
  Flattened in mainsail and foresail, and off to the Islands they went.</p>
<p>Close to the headlands they drifted, picking up shell by the ton,<br>
  Piled up on deck were the oysters, opening wide in the sun,<br>
  When, from the lee of the headland, boomed the report of a gun.</p>
<p>Then if the diver was sighted, pearl-shell and lugger must go&mdash;<br>
  Joe Nagasaki decided (quick was the word and the blow),<br>
  Cut both the pipe and the life-line, leaving the diver below!</p>
<p>Kanzo Makame, the diver, failing to quite understand,<br>
  Pulled the &ldquo;haul up&rdquo; on the life-line, found it was slack in his hand;<br>
  Then, like a little brown stoic, lay down and died on the sand.</p>
<p>Joe Nagasaki, the &ldquo;tender&rdquo;, smiling a sanctified smile,<br>
  Headed her straight for the gunboat&mdash;throwing out shells all the while&mdash;<br>
  Then went aboard and reported, &ldquo;No makee dive in three mile!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dress no have got and no helmet&mdash;diver go shore on the spree;<br>
  Plenty wind come and break rudder&mdash;lugger get blown out to sea:<br>
  Take me to Japanee Consul, he help a poor Japanee!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * *  * *</b></p>
<p>So the Dutch let him go; but they watched him, as off from the Islands he ran,<br>
  Doubting him much&mdash;but what would you? You have to be sure of your man<br>
  Ere you wake up that nest-ful of hornets&mdash;the little brown men of Japan.</p>
<p>Down in the ooze and the coral, down where earth&rsquo;s wonders are  spread,<br>
  Helmeted, ghastly, and swollen, Kanzo Makame lies dead.<br>
  Joe Nagasaki, his &ldquo;tender&rdquo;, is owner and diver instead.</p>
<p>Wearer of pearls in your necklace, comfort yourself if you can.<br>
  These are the risks of the pearling&mdash;these are the ways of Japan;<br>
  &ldquo;Plenty more Japanee diver, plenty more little brown man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheCityofDreadfulThirst"></a>The City of Dreadful Thirst</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;stranger came  from Narromine and made his little joke;<br>
  &ldquo;They say we folks in Narromine are  narrow-minded folk;<br>
  But all the smartest men down here are puzzled  to define<br>
  A kind of new phenomenon that came to  Narromine. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Last summer up in Narromine &rsquo;twas gettin&rsquo;  rather warm&mdash;<br>
  Two hundred in the water-bag, and lookin&rsquo; like a storm&mdash;<br>
  We all were in the private bar, the coolest place in town,<br>
  When out across the stretch of plain a cloud came rollin&rsquo; down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t respect the clouds up there,  they fill us with disgust,<br>
  They mostly bring a Bogan shower&mdash;three raindrops and some dust;<br>
  But each man, simultaneous&mdash;like, to each man said, &lsquo;I think<br>
  That cloud suggests it&rsquo;s up to us to have another drink!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s clouds of rain and clouds of dust&mdash;we&rsquo;d  heard of them before,<br>
  And sometimes in the daily press we read of &lsquo;clouds of war&rsquo;.<br>
  But&mdash;if this ain&rsquo;t the Gospel truth I hope that I may burst&mdash;<br>
  That cloud that came to Narromine was just a cloud of thirst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t like a common cloud, &rsquo;twas more  a sort of haze;<br>
  It settled down about the street, and stopped for days and days;<br>
  And not a drop of dew could fall, and not a sunbeam shine<br>
  To pierce that dismal sort of mist that hung on Narromine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord! we had a dreadful time beneath  that cloud of thirst!<br>
  We all chucked-up our daily work and went upon the burst.<br>
  The very blacks about the town, that used to cadge for grub,<br>
  They made an organized attack and tried to loot the pub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t leave the private bar no  matter how we tried;<br>
  Shearers and squatters, union-men and blacklegs side by side<br>
  Were drinkin&rsquo; there and dursn&rsquo;t move, for each was sure, he said,<br>
  Before he&rsquo;d get a half-a-mile the thirst would strike him dead!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We drank until the drink gave out; we  searched from room to room,<br>
  And round the pub, like drunken ghosts, went howling through the gloom.<br>
  The shearers found some kerosene and settled down again,<br>
  But all the squatter chaps and I, we staggered to the train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And once outside the cloud of thirst we  felt as right as pie,<br>
  But while we stopped about the town we had to drink or die.<br>
  I hear today it&rsquo;s safe enough; I&rsquo;m going back to work<br>
  Because they say the cloud of thirst has shifted on to Bourke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when you see those clouds about&mdash;like  this one over here&mdash;<br>
  All white and frothy at the top, just like a pint of beer,<br>
  It&rsquo;s time to go and have a drink, for if that cloud should burst<br>
  You&rsquo;d find the drink would all be gone, for that&rsquo;s a cloud of thirst!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>We stood the man from Narromine a pint of  half-and-half;<br>
  He drank it off without a gasp in one  tremendous quaff;<br>
  &ldquo;I joined some friends last night,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;in what&nbsp;<i>they</i>&nbsp;called a spree;<br>
  But after Narromine &rsquo;twas just a holiday to  me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And now beyond the Western Range, where  sunset skies are red,<br>
  And clouds of dust, and clouds of thirst, go drifting overhead,<br>
  The railway-train is taking back, along the Western Line,<br>
  That narrow-minded person on his road to Narromine.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="SaltbushBillsGamecock"></a>Saltbush Bill&rsquo;s Gamecock</h2>
<p>&rsquo;Twas&nbsp;Saltbush Bill,  with his travelling sheep, was making his way to town;<br>
  He crossed them over the Hard Times Run, and  he came to the Take &rsquo;Em Down;<br>
  He counted through at the boundary gate, and  camped at the drafting yard:<br>
  For Stingy Smith, of the Hard Times Run, had  hunted him rather hard.<br>
  He bore no malice to Stingy Smith&mdash;&rsquo;twas simply  the hand of Fate<br>
  That caused his waggon to swerve aside and  shatter old Stingy&rsquo;s gate;<br>
  And being only the hand of Fate, it follows,  without a doubt,<br>
  It wasn&rsquo;t the fault of Saltbush Bill that  Stingy&rsquo;s sheep got out.<br>
  So Saltbush Bill, with an easy heart, prepared  for what might befall,<br>
  Commenced his stages on Take &rsquo;Em Down, the  station of Rooster Hall. </p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis strange how often the men out back  will take to some curious craft,<br>
  Some ruling passion to keep their thoughts away from the overdraft;<br>
  And Rooster Hall, of the Take &rsquo;Em Down, was widely known to fame<br>
  As breeder of champion fighting cocks&mdash;his&nbsp;<i>forte</i>&nbsp;was the  British Game.<br>
  The passing stranger within his gates that camped with old Rooster Hall<br>
  Was forced to talk about fowls all night, or else not talk at all.<br>
  Though droughts should come, and though sheep should die, his fowls were his  sole delight:<br>
  He left his shed in the flood of work to watch two game-cocks fight<br>
  He held in scorn the Australian Game, that long-legged child of sin;<br>
  In a desperate fight, with the steel-tipped spurs, the British game must win!<br>
  The Australian bird was a mongrel bird, with a touch of the jungle cock;<br>
  The want of breeding must find him out, when facing the English stock;<br>
  For British breeding, and British pluck, must triumph it over all&mdash;<br>
  And that was the root of the simple creed that governed old Rooster Hall.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas Saltbush Bill to the station rode ahead  of his travelling sheep,<br>
  And sent a message to Rooster Hall that  wakened him out of his sleep&mdash;<br>
  A crafty message that fetched him out, and  hurried him as he came&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;A drover has an Australian bird to match with  your British Game.&rdquo;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas done, and done in half a trice; a  five-pound note aside;<br>
  Old Rooster Hall, with his champion bird, and  the drover&rsquo;s bird untried.<br>
  &ldquo;Steel spurs, of course?&rdquo; said old Rooster Hall; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need &rsquo;em,  without a doubt!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;You stick the spurs on your bird!&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;but mine fights best without.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Fights best without?&rdquo; said old Rooster Hall; &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t fight best unspurred!<br>
  You must be crazy!&rdquo; But Saltbush Bill said, &ldquo;Wait till you see my bird!&rdquo;<br>
  So Rooster Hall to his fowl-yard went, and quickly back he came,<br>
  Bearing a clipt and a shaven cock, the pride of his English Game;<br>
  With an eye as fierce as an eaglehawk, and a crow like a trumpet call,<br>
  He strutted about on the garden walk, and cackled at Rooster Hall.<br>
  Then Rooster Hall sent off a boy with a word to his cronies two,<br>
  McCrae (the boss of the Black Police) and Father Donahoo.<br>
  Full many a cockfight old McCrae had held in his empty Court,<br>
  With Father D. as the picker-up&mdash;a regular all-round Sport!<br>
  They got the message of Rooster Hall, and down to his run they came,<br>
  Prepared to scoff at the drover&rsquo;s bird, and to bet on the English Game;<br>
  They hied them off to the drover&rsquo;s camp, while Saltbush rode before&mdash;<br>
  Old Rooster Hall was a blithesome man, when he thought of the treat in store.<br>
  They reached the camp, where the drover&rsquo;s cook, with countenance all serene,<br>
  Was boiling beef in an iron pot, but never a fowl was seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off the beef from the fire,&rdquo; said  Bill, &ldquo;and wait till you see the fight;<br>
  There&rsquo;s something fresh for the bill-of-fare&mdash;there&rsquo;s game-fowl stew tonight!<br>
  For Mister Hall has a fighting cock, all feathered and clipped and spurred;<br>
  And he&rsquo;s fetched him here, for a bit of sport, to fight our Australian bird.<br>
  I&rsquo;ve made a match that our pet will win, though he&rsquo;s hardly a fighting cock,<br>
  But he&rsquo;s game enough, and it&rsquo;s many a mile that he&rsquo;s tramped with the  travelling stock.&rdquo;<br>
  The cook he banged on a saucepan lid; and, soon as the sound was heard,<br>
  Under the dray, in the shallow hid, a something moved and stirred:<br>
  A great tame emu strutted out. Said Saltbush, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our bird!&rdquo;<br>
  But Rooster Hall, and his cronies two, drove home without a word.</p>
<p>The passing stranger within his gates that  camps with old Rooster Hall<br>
  Must talk about something else than fowls, if he wishes to talk at all.<br>
  For the record lies in the local Court, and filed in its deepest vault,<br>
  That Peter Hall, of the Take &rsquo;Em Down, was tried for a fierce assault<br>
  On a stranger man, who, in all good faith, and prompted by what be heard,<br>
  Had asked old Hall if a British Game could beat an Australian bird;<br>
  And Old McCrae, who was on the Bench, as soon as the case was tried,<br>
  Remarked, &ldquo;Discharged with a clean discharge&mdash;the assault was justified!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&nbsp;come and see me,  boys,&rdquo; he said;<br>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find a welcome and a bed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whisky any time  you call;<br>
  Although our township hasn&rsquo;t got<br>
  The name of quite a lively spot&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, I live in  Booligal. </p>
<p>&ldquo;And people have an awful down<br>
  Upon the district and the town&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which worse than hell itself they call;<br>
  In fact, the saying far and wide<br>
  Along the Riverina side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is &lsquo;Hay and Hell and Booligal&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt it suits &rsquo;em very well<br>
  To say its worse than Hay or Hell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But don&rsquo;t you heed their talk at all;<br>
  Of course, there&rsquo;s heat&mdash;no one denies&mdash;<br>
  And sand and dust and stacks of flies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rabbits, too, at Booligal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But such a pleasant, quiet place&mdash;<br>
  You never see a stranger&rsquo;s face;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hardly ever care to call;<br>
  The drovers mostly pass it by&mdash;<br>
  They reckon that they&rsquo;d rather die<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than spend the night in Booligal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big mosquitoes frighten some&mdash;<br>
  You&rsquo;ll lie awake to hear &rsquo;em hum&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And snakes about the township crawl;<br>
  But shearers, when they get their cheque,<br>
  They never come along and wreck<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blessed town of Booligal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But down to Hay the shearers come<br>
  And fill themselves with fighting-rum,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And chase blue devils up the wall,<br>
  And fight the snaggers every day,<br>
  Until there is the deuce to pay&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s none of that in Booligal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, there isn&rsquo;t much to see&mdash;<br>
  The billiard-table used to be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great attraction for us all,<br>
  Until some careless, drunken curs<br>
  Got sleeping on it in their spurs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ruined it, in Booligal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now there is a howling drought<br>
  That pretty near has starved us out&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It never seems to rain at all;<br>
  But, if there&nbsp;<i>should</i>&nbsp;come any rain,<br>
  You couldn&rsquo;t cross the black-soil plain&mdash;<br>

<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;d have to stop!</i>&rdquo; With bated breath<br>
  We prayed that both in life and death<br>

<h2 align="center"><a name="AWalgettEpisode"></a>A Walgett Episode</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;sun strikes down  with a blinding glare;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skies are blue and  the plains are wide,<br>
  The saltbush plains that are burnt and bare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Walgett out on the  Barwon side&mdash;<br>
  The Barwon River that wanders down<br>
  In a leisurely manner by Walgett Town. </p>
<p>There came a stranger&mdash;a &ldquo;Cockatoo&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word means farmer, as all men know,<br>
  Who dwell in the land where the kangaroo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barks loud at dawn, and the white-eyed crow<br>
  Uplifts his song on the stock-yard fence<br>
  As he watches the lambkins passing hence.</p>
<p>The sunburnt stranger was gaunt and brown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it soon appeared that he meant to flout<br>
  The iron law of the country town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is&mdash;that the stranger has got to shout:<br>
  &ldquo;If he will not shout we must take him down,&rdquo;<br>
  Remarked the yokels of Walgett   Town.</p>
<p>They baited a trap with a crafty bait,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a crafty bait, for they held discourse<br>
  Concerning a new chum who there of late<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had bought such a thoroughly lazy horse;<br>
  They would wager that no one could ride him down<br>
  The length of the city of Walgett  Town.</p>
<p>The stranger was born on a horse&rsquo;s hide;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he took the wagers, and made them good<br>
  With his hard-earned cash&mdash;but his hopes they died,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the horse was a clothes-horse, made of wood!&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a well-known horse that had taken down<br>
  Full many a stranger in Walgett Town.</p>
<p>The stranger smiled with a sickly smile&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis a sickly smile that the loser grins&mdash;<br>
  And he said he had travelled for quite a while<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-trying to sell some marsupial skins.<br>
  &ldquo;And I thought that perhaps, as you&rsquo;ve took me down,<br>
  You would buy them from me, in Walgett   Town!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said that his home was at Wingadee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Wingadee, where he had for sale<br>
  Some fifty skins and would guarantee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were full-sized skins, with the ears and tail<br>
  Complete; and he sold them for money down<br>
  To a venturesome buyer in Walgett   Town.</p>
<p>Then he smiled a smile as he pouched the  pelf,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that I&rsquo;m quit of them, win or lose:<br>
  You can fetch them in when it suits yourself,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&rsquo;ll find the skins&mdash;on the kangaroos!&rdquo;<br>
  Then he left&mdash;and the silence settled down<br>
  Like a tangible thing upon Walgett   Town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="FatherRileysHorse"></a>Father Riley&rsquo;s Horse</h2>
<p>&rsquo;Twas&nbsp;the horse thief,  Andy Regan, that was hunted like a dog<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the troopers of the  Upper Murray side;<br>
  They had searched in every gully, they had  looked in every log<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never sight or  track of him they spied,<br>
  Till the priest at Kiley&rsquo;s Crossing heard a  knocking very late<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a whisper &ldquo;Father  Riley&mdash;come across!&rdquo;<br>
  So his Reverence, in pyjamas, trotted softly  to the gate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And admitted Andy  Regan&mdash;and a horse! </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s listen, Father Riley, to the  words I&rsquo;ve got to say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it&rsquo;s close upon my death I am tonight.<br>
  With the troopers hard behind me I&rsquo;ve been hiding all the day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gullies keeping close and out of sight.<br>
  But they&rsquo;re watching all the ranges till there&rsquo;s not a bird could fly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;m fairly worn to pieces with the strife,<br>
  So I&rsquo;m taking no more trouble, but I&rsquo;m going home to die,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis the only way I see to save my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m making home to mother&rsquo;s, and  I&rsquo;ll die o&rsquo; Tuesday next<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; buried on the Thursday&mdash;and, of course,<br>
  I&rsquo;m prepared to do my penance; but with one thing I&rsquo;m perplexed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&rsquo;s&mdash;Father, it&rsquo;s this jewel of a horse!<br>
  He was never bought nor paid for, and there&rsquo;s not a man can swear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his owner or his breeder, but I know<br>
  That his sire was by Pedantic from the Old Pretender mare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his dam was close related to The Roe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s nothing in the district that  can race him for a step&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could canter while they&rsquo;re going at their top:<br>
  He&rsquo;s the king of all the leppers that was ever seen to lep;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A five-foot fence&mdash;he&rsquo;d clear it in a hop!<br>
  So I&rsquo;ll leave him with you, Father, till the dead shall rise again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis yourself that knows a good un; and, of course,<br>
  You can say he&rsquo;s got by Moonlight out of Paddy Murphy&rsquo;s plain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re ever asked the breeding of the horse!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s getting on to daylight, and it&rsquo;s  time to say good-bye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the stars above the East are growing pale.<br>
  And I&rsquo;m making home to mother&mdash;and it&rsquo;s hard for me to die!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it&rsquo;s harder still, is keeping out of gaol!<br>
  You can ride the old horse over to my grave across the dip,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the wattle-bloom is waving overhead.<br>
  Sure he&rsquo;ll jump them fences easy&mdash;you must never raise the whip<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or he&rsquo;ll rush &rsquo;em!&mdash;now, good-bye!&rdquo; and he had fled!</p>
<p>So they buried Andy Regan, and they buried  him to rights,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the graveyard at the back of Kiley&rsquo;s Hill;<br>
  There were five-and-twenty mourners who had five-and-twenty fights<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the very boldest fighters had their fill.<br>
  There were fifty horses racing from the graveyard to the pub,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the riders flogged each other all the while&mdash;<br>
  And the lashins of the liquor! And the lavins of the grub!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, poor Andy went to rest in proper style.</p>
<p>Then the races came to Kiley&rsquo;s&mdash;with a  steeple chase and all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the folk were mostly Irish round about,<br>
  And it takes an Irish rider to be fearless of a fall;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were training morning in and morning out.<br>
  But they never started training till the sun was on the course,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a superstitious story kept &rsquo;em back.<br>
  That the ghost of Andy Regan on a slashing chestnut horse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been training by the starlight on the track.</p>
<p>And they read the nominations for the  races with surprise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And amusement at the Father&rsquo;s little joke,<br>
  For a novice had been entered for the steeplechasing prize,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they found that it was Father Riley&rsquo;s moke!<br>
  He was neat enough to gallop, he was strong enough to stay!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his owner&rsquo;s views of training were immense,<br>
  For the Reverend Father Riley used to ride him every day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he never saw a hurdle nor a fence.</p>
<p>And the priest would join the laughter;  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I put him in,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there&rsquo;s five-and-twenty sovereigns to be won;<br>
  And the poor would find it useful if the chestnut chanced to win,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he&rsquo;ll maybe do when all is said and done!&rdquo;<br>
  He had called him Faugh-a-ballagh, which is French for Clear the course,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his colours were a vivid shade of green:<br>
  All the Dooleys and O&rsquo;Donnells were on Father Riley&rsquo;s horse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Orangeman were backing Mandarin!</p>
<p>It was Hogan, the dog-poisoner&mdash;aged man  and very wise,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was camping in the racecourse with his swag,<br>
  And who ventured the opinion, to the township&rsquo;s great surprise,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the race would go to Father Riley&rsquo;s nag.<br>
  &ldquo;You can talk about your riders&mdash;and the horse has not been schooled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fences is terrific, and the rest!<br>
  When the field is fairly going, then ye&rsquo;ll see ye&rsquo;ve all been fooled.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the chestnut horse will battle with the best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For there&rsquo;s some has got condition, and  they think the race is sure,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the chestnut horse will fall beneath the weight;<br>
  But the hopes of all the helpless, and the prayers of all the poor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be running by his side to keep him straight.<br>
  And it&rsquo;s what the need of schoolin&rsquo; or of workin&rsquo; on the track,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whin the Saints are there to guide him round the  course!<br>
  I&rsquo;ve prayed him over every fence&mdash;I&rsquo;ve prayed him out and back!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;ll bet my cash on Father Riley&rsquo;s horse!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>Oh, the steeple was a caution! They went tearin&rsquo;  round and round,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fences rang  and rattled where they struck.<br>
  There was some that cleared the water&mdash;there  was more fell in and drowned&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some blamed the men  and others blamed the luck!<br>
  But the whips were flying freely when the  field came into view<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the finish down  the long green stretch of course,<br>
  And in front of all the flyers, jumpin&rsquo; like a  kangaroo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the rank  outsider&mdash;Father Riley&rsquo;s horse! </p>
<p>Oh, the shouting and the cheering as he  rattled past the post!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he left the others standing, in the straight;<br>
  And the rider&mdash;well, they reckoned it was Andy Regan&rsquo;s ghost,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it beat &rsquo;em how a ghost would draw the weight!<br>
  But he weighed in, nine stone seven; then he laughed and disappeared,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a Banshee (which is Spanish for an elf),<br>
  And old Hogan muttered sagely, &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for the beard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;d be thinking it was Andy Regan&rsquo;s self!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the poor at Kiley&rsquo;s Crossing drank the  health at Christmastide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the chestnut and his rider dressed in green.<br>
  There was never such a rider, not since Andy Regan died,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they wondered who on earth he could have been,<br>
  But they settled it among &rsquo;em, for the story got about,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Mongst the bushmen and the people on the course,<br>
  That the Devil had been ordered to let Andy Regan out<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the steeplechase on Father Riley&rsquo;s horse!</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheScotchEngineer"></a>The Scotch Engineer</h2>
<p>With&nbsp;eyes that  searched in the dark,<br>
  Peering along the line,<br>
  Stood the grim Scotchsman, Hector Clark,<br>
  Driver of &ldquo;Forty-nine&rdquo;.<br>
  And the veldt-fire flamed on the hills ahead,<br>
  Like a blood-red beacon sign. </p>
<p>There was word of a fight to the north,<br>
  And a column too hardly pressed,<br>
  So they started the Highlanders forth,<br>
  Heedless of food or rest.</p>
<p>But the pipers gaily played,<br>
  Chanting their fierce delight,<br>
  And the armoured carriages rocked and swayed,<br>
  Laden with men of the Scotch Brigade,<br>
  Hurrying up to the fight,<br>
  And the grim, grey Highland engineer<br>
  Driving them into the night.</p>
<p>Then a signal light glowed red,<br>
  And a picket came to the track.<br>
  &ldquo;Enemy holding the line ahead;<br>
  Three of our mates we have left for dead,<br>
  Only we two got back.&rdquo;<br>
  And far to the north through the still night air,<br>
  They heard the rifles crack.</p>
<p>And the boom of a gun rang out,<br>
  Like the sound of a deep appeal,<br>
  And the picket stood in doubt<br>
  By the side of the driving-wheel.</p>
<p>But the engineer looked down,<br>
  With his hand on the starting-bar,<br>
  &ldquo;Ride ye back to the town,<br>
  Ye know what my orders are,<br>
  Maybe they&rsquo;re wanting the Scotch Brigade<br>
  Up on those hills afar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no soldier at all,<br>
  Only an engineer;<br>
  But I could not bear that the folk should say<br>
  Over in Scotland&mdash;Glasgow way&mdash;<br>
  That Hector Clark stayed here<br>
  With the Scotch Brigade till the foe was gone,<br>
  With ever a rail to run her on.<br>
  Ready behind! Stand clear!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fireman, get you gone<br>
  Into the armoured train&mdash;<br>
  I will drive her alone;<br>
  One more trip&mdash;and perhaps the last&mdash;<br>
  With a well-raked fire and an open blast;<br>
  Hark to the rifles again!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>On through the choking dark,<br>
  Never a lamp nor a light,<br>
  Never an engine spark,<br>
  Showing her hurried flight.<br>
  Over the lonely plain<br>
  Rushed the great armoured train,<br>
  Hurrying up to the fight. </p>
<p>Then with her living freight<br>
  On to the foe she came,<br>
  And the rifles snapped their hate,<br>
  And the darkness spouted flame.</p>
<p>Over the roar of the fray<br>
  The hungry bullets whined,<br>
  As she dashed through the foe that lay<br>
  Loading and firing blind,<br>
  Till the glare of the furnace, burning clear,<br>
  Showed them the form of the engineer,<br>
  Sharply and well defined.</p>
<p>Through! They are safely through!<br>
  Hark to the column&rsquo;s cheer!<br>
  Surely the driver knew<br>
  He was to halt her here;<br>
  But he took no heed of the signals red,<br>
  And the fireman found, when he climbed ahead,<br>
  There on the floor of his engine&mdash;dead&mdash;<br>
  Lay the Scotch Engineer!</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="SongoftheFuture"></a>Song of the Future</h2>
<p>&rsquo;Tis&nbsp;strange that in a  land so strong<br>
  So strong and bold in mighty youth,<br>
  We have no poet&rsquo;s voice of truth<br>
  To sing for us a wondrous song. </p>
<p>Our chiefest singer yet has sung<br>
  In wild, sweet notes a passing strain,<br>
  All carelessly and sadly flung<br>
  To that dull world he thought so vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care for nothing, good nor bad,<br>
  My hopes are gone, my pleasures fled,<br>
  I am but sifting sand,&rdquo; he said:<br>
  What wonder Gordon&rsquo;s songs were sad!</p>
<p>And yet, not always sad and hard;<br>
  In cheerful mood and light of heart<br>
  He told the tale of Britomarte,<br>
  And wrote the Rhyme of Joyous Guard.</p>
<p>And some have said that Nature&rsquo;s face<br>
  To us is always sad; but these<br>
  Have never felt the smiling grace<br>
  Of waving grass and forest trees<br>
  On sunlit plains as wide as seas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A land where dull Despair is king<br>
  O&rsquo;er scentless flower and songless bird!&rdquo;<br>
  But we have heard the bell-birds ring<br>
  Their silver bells at eventide,<br>
  Like fairies on the mountain side,<br>
  The sweetest note man ever heard.</p>
<p>The wild thrush lifts a note of mirth;<br>
  The bronzewing pigeons call and coo<br>
  Beside their nests the long day through;<br>
  The magpie warbles clear and strong<br>
  A joyous, glad, thanksgiving song,<br>
  For all God&rsquo;s mercies upon earth.</p>
<p>And many voices such as these<br>
  Are joyful sounds for those to tell,<br>
  Who know the Bush and love it well,<br>
  With all its hidden mysteries.</p>
<p>We cannot love the restless sea,<br>
  That rolls and tosses to and fro<br>
  Like some fierce creature in its glee;<br>
  For human weal or human woe<br>
  It has no touch of sympathy.</p>
<p>For us the bush is never sad:<br>
  Its myriad voices whisper low,<br>
  In tones the bushmen only know,<br>
  Its sympathy and welcome glad.</p>
<p>For us the roving breezes bring<br>
  From many a blossom-tufted tree&mdash;<br>
  Where wild bees murmur dreamily&mdash;<br>
  The honey-laden breath of Spring.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>We have no tales of other days,<br>
  No bygone history to tell;<br>
  Our tales are told where camp-fires blaze,<br>
  At midnight, when the solemn hush<br>
  Of that vast wonderland, the Bush,<br>
  Hath laid on every heart its spell. </p>
<p>Although we have no songs of strife<br>
  Of bloodshed reddening the land,<br>
  We may yet find achievements grand<br>
  Within the bushman&rsquo;s quiet life.</p>
<p>Lift ye your faces to the sky<br>
  Ye far blue mountains of the West,<br>
  Who lie so peacefully at rest<br>
  Enshrouded in a haze of blue;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis hard to feel that years went by<br>
  Before the pioneers broke through<br>
  Your rocky heights and walls of stone,<br>
  And made your secrets all their own.</p>
<p>For years the fertile Western plains<br>
  Were hid behind your sullen walls,<br>
  Your cliffs and crags and waterfalls<br>
  All weatherworn with tropic rains.</p>
<p>Between the mountains and the sea,<br>
  Like Israelites with staff in hand,<br>
  The people waited restlessly:<br>
  They looked towards the mountains old<br>
  And saw the sunsets come and go<br>
  With gorgeous golden afterglow,<br>
  That made the West a fairyland,<br>
  And marvelled what that West might be<br>
  Of which such wondrous tales were told.</p>
<p>For tales were told of inland seas<br>
  Like sullen oceans, salt and dead,<br>
  And sandy deserts, white and wan,<br>
  Where never trod the foot of man,<br>
  Nor bird went winging overhead,<br>
  Nor ever stirred a gracious breeze<br>
  To wake the silence with its breath&mdash;<br>
  A land of loneliness and death.</p>
<p>At length the hardy pioneers<br>
  By rock and crag found out the way,<br>
  And woke with voices of today<br>
  A silence kept for years and years.</p>
<p>Upon the Western slope they stood<br>
  And saw&mdash;a wide expanse of plain<br>
  As far as eye could stretch or see<br>
  Go rolling westward endlessly.<br>
  The native grasses, tall as grain,<br>
  Were waved and rippled in the breeze;<br>
  From boughs of blossom-laden trees<br>
  The parrots answered back again.<br>
  They saw the land that it was good,<br>
  A land of fatness all untrod,<br>
  And gave their silent thanks to God.</p>
<p>The way is won! The way is won!<br>
  And straightway from the barren coast<br>
  There came a westward-marching host,<br>
  That aye and ever onward prest<br>
  With eager faces to the West,<br>
  Along the pathway of the sun.</p>
<p>The mountains saw them marching by:<br>
  They faced the all-consuming drought,<br>
  They would not rest in settled land:<br>
  But, taking each his life in hand,<br>
  Their faces ever westward bent<br>
  Beyond the farthest settlement,<br>
  Responding to the challenge cry<br>
  Of &ldquo;better country farther out&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And lo, a miracle! the land<br>
  But yesterday was all unknown,<br>
  The wild man&rsquo;s boomerang was thrown<br>
  Where now great busy cities stand.<br>
  It was not much, you say, that these<br>
  Should win their way where none withstood;<br>
  In sooth there was not much of blood<br>
  No war was fought between the seas.</p>
<p>It was not much! but we who know<br>
  The strange capricious land they trod&mdash;<br>
  At times a stricken, parching sod,<br>
  At times with raging floods beset&mdash;<br>
  Through which they found their lonely way,<br>
  Are quite content that you should say<br>
  It was not much, while we can feel<br>
  That nothing in the ages old,<br>
  In song or story written yet<br>
  On Grecian urn or Roman arch,<br>
  Though it should ring with clash of steel,<br>
  Could braver histories unfold<br>
  Than this bush story, yet untold&mdash;<br>
  The story of their westward march.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>But times are changed, and changes rung<br>
  From old to new&mdash;the olden days,<br>
  The old bush life and all its ways,<br>
  Are passing from us all unsung.<br>
  The freedom, and the hopeful sense<br>
  Of toil that brought due recompense,<br>
  Of room for all, has passed away,<br>
  And lies forgotten with the dead.<br>
  Within our streets men cry for bread<br>
  In cities built but yesterday.</p>
<p>About us stretches wealth of land,<br>
  A boundless wealth of virgin soil<br>
  As yet unfruitful and untilled!<br>
  Our willing workmen, strong and skilled,<br>
  Within our cities idle stand,<br>
  And cry aloud for leave to toil.</p>
<p>The stunted children come and go<br>
  In squalid lanes and alleys black;<br>
  We follow but the beaten track<br>
  Of other nations, and we grow<br>
  In wealth for some&mdash;for many, woe.</p>
<p>And it may be that we who live<br>
  In this new land apart, beyond<br>
  The hard old world grown fierce and fond<br>
  And bound by precedent and bond,<br>
  May read the riddle right, and give<br>
  New hope to those who dimly see<br>
  That all things yet shall be for good,<br>
  And teach the world at length to be<br>
  One vast united brotherhood.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>So may it be! and he who sings<br>
  In accents hopeful, clear, and strong,<br>
  The glories which that future brings<br>
  Shall sing, indeed, a wond&rsquo;rous song.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,  we&rsquo;re going deeper down:<br>
  If we fail to get the water, then it&rsquo;s ruin to the squatter,<br>
  For the drought is on the station and the weather&rsquo;s growing hotter;<br>
  But we&rsquo;re bound to get the water deeper down.</p>
<p>But the shaft has started caving and the  sinking&rsquo;s very slow,<br>
  And the yellow rods are bending in the water down below,<br>
  And the tubes are always jamming, and they can&rsquo;t be made to shift<br>
  Till we nearly burst the engine with a forty horse-power lift.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking  down, deeper down,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,  we&rsquo;re going deeper down<br>
  Though the shaft is always caving, and the tubes are always jamming,<br>
  Yet we&rsquo;ll fight our way to water while the stubborn drill is ramming&mdash;<br>
  While the stubborn drill is ramming deeper down.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no artesian water, though  we&rsquo;ve passed three thousand feet,<br>
  And the contract price is growing, and the boss is nearly beat.<br>
  But it must be down beneath us, and it&rsquo;s down we&rsquo;ve got to go,<br>
  Though she&rsquo;s bumping on the solid rock four thousand feet below.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinking  down, deeper down,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,  we&rsquo;re going deeper down:<br>
  And it&rsquo;s time they heard us knocking on the roof of Satan&rsquo;s dwellin&rsquo;;<br>
  But we&rsquo;ll get artesian water if we cave the roof of hell in&mdash;<br>
  Oh! we&rsquo;ll get artesian water deeper down.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hark! the whistle&rsquo;s blowing with  a wild, exultant blast,<br>
  And the boys are madly cheering, for they&rsquo;ve struck the flow at last;<br>
  And it&rsquo;s rushing up the tubing from four thousand feet below,<br>
  Till it spouts above the casing in a million-gallon flow.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  it&rsquo;s down, deeper down&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,  it comes from deeper down;<br>
  It is flowing, ever flowing, in a free, unstinted measure<br>
  From the silent hidden places where the old earth hides her treasure&mdash;<br>
  Where the old earth hides her treasures deeper down.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s clear away the timber, and it&rsquo;s  let the water run:<br>
  How it glimmers in the shadow, how it flashes in the sun!<br>
  By the silent belts of timber, by the miles of blazing plain<br>
  It is bringing hope and comfort to the thirsty land again.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowing  down, further down;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It  is flowing further down<br>
  To the tortured thirsty cattle, bringing gladness in its going;<br>
  Through the droughty days of summer it is flowing, ever flowing&mdash;<br>
  It is flowing, ever flowing, further down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ADisqualifiedJockeysStory"></a>A Disqualified Jockey&rsquo;s Story</h2>
<p>You&nbsp;see, the thing was this way&mdash;there was me,<br>
  That rode Panoppoly, the Splendor mare,<br>
  And Ikey Chambers on the Iron Dook,<br>
  And Smith, the half-caste rider on Regret,<br>
  And that long bloke from Wagga&mdash;him that rode<br>
  Veronikew, the Snowy River horse.<br>
  Well, none of them had chances&mdash;not a chance<br>
  Among the lot, unless the rest fell dead<br>
  Or wasn&rsquo;t trying&mdash;for a blind man&rsquo;s dog<br>
  Could see Enchantress was a certain cop,<br>
  And all the books was layin&rsquo; six to four.</p>
<p>They brought her out to show our lot the road,<br>
  Or so they said; but, then Cord&rsquo;s truth! you know,<br>
  You can&rsquo;t believe &rsquo;em, though they took an oath<br>
  On forty Bibles that they&rsquo;d tell the truth.<br>
  But anyhow, an amateur was up<br>
  On this Enchantress; and so Ike and me,<br>
  We thought that we might frighten him a bit<br>
  By asking if he minded riding rough&mdash;<br>
  &rdquo;Oh, not at all,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;oh, not at all!<br>
  I learnt at Robbo   Park, and if it comes<br>
  To bumping I&rsquo;m your Moses! Strike me blue!&rdquo;<br>
  Says he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bump you over either rail,<br>
  The inside rail or outside&mdash;which you choose<br>
  Is good enough for me&rdquo;&mdash;which settled Ike.<br>
  For he was shaky since he near got killed<br>
  From being sent a buster on the rail,<br>
  When some chap bumped his horse and fetched him down<br>
  At Stony Bridge; so Ikey thought it best<br>
  To leave this bloke alone, and I agreed.</p>
<p>So all the books was layin&rsquo; six to four<br>
  Against the favourite, and the amateur<br>
  Was walking this Enchantress up and down,<br>
  And me and Smithy backed him; for we thought<br>
  We might as well get something for ourselves,<br>
  Because we knew our horses couldn&rsquo;t win.<br>
  But Ikey wouldn&rsquo;t back him for a bob;<br>
  Because he said he reckoned he was stiff,<br>
  And all the books was layin&rsquo; six to four.</p>
<p>Well, anyhow, before the start the news<br>
  Got around that this here amateur was stiff,<br>
  And our good stuff was blued, and all the books<br>
  Was in it, and the prices lengthened out,<br>
  And every book was bustin&rsquo; of his throat,<br>
  And layin&rsquo; five to one the favourite.<br>
  So there was we that couldn&rsquo;t win ourselves,<br>
  And this here amateur that wouldn&rsquo;t try,<br>
  And all the books was layin&rsquo; five to one.</p>
<p>So Smithy says to me, &ldquo;You take a hold<br>
  Of that there moke of yours, and round the turn<br>
  Come up behind Enchantress with the whip<br>
  And let her have it; that long bloke and me<br>
  Will wait ahead, and when she comes to us<br>
  We&rsquo;ll pass her on and belt her down the straight,<br>
  And Ikey&rsquo;ll flog her home&mdash;because his boss<br>
  Is judge and steward and the Lord knows what,<br>
  And so he won&rsquo;t be touched; and, as for us,<br>
  We&rsquo;ll swear we only hit her by mistake!&rdquo;<br>
  And all the books was layin&rsquo; five to one.</p>
<p>Well, off we went, and comin&rsquo; to the turn<br>
  I saw the amateur was holding back<br>
  And poking into every hole he could<br>
  To get her blocked; and so I pulled behind<br>
  And drew the whip and dropped it on the mare.<br>
  I let her have it twice, and then she shot<br>
  Ahead of me, and Smithy opened out<br>
  And let her up beside him on the rails,<br>
  And kept her there a-beltin&rsquo; her like smoke<br>
  Until she struggled past him, pullin&rsquo; hard,<br>
  And came to Ike; but Ikey drew his whip<br>
  And hit her on the nose, and sent her back<br>
  And won the race himself&mdash;for, after all,<br>
  It seems he had a fiver on The Dook<br>
  And never told us&mdash;so our stuff was lost.<br>
  And then they had us up for ridin&rsquo; foul,<br>
  And warned us off the tracks for twelve months each<br>
  To get our livin&rsquo; any way we could;<br>
  But Ikey wasn&rsquo;t touched, because his boss<br>
  Was judge and steward and the Lord knows what.</p>
<p>But Mister&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll lend us half-a-crown,<br>
  I know three certain winners at the Park&mdash;<br>
  Three certain cops as no one knows but me;<br>
  And&mdash;thank you, Mister, come an&rsquo; have a beer<br>
  (I always like a beer about this time) . . .<br>
  Well, so long, Mister, till we meet again.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheRoadtoGundagai"></a>The Road to Gundagai</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;mountain road  goes up and down<br>
  From Gundagai to Tumut Town. </p>
<p>And, branching off, there runs a track<br>
  Across the foothills grim and black,</p>
<p>Across the plains and ranges grey<br>
  To Sydney city  far away.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>It came by chance one day that I<br>
  From Tumut rode to Gundagai, </p>
<p>And reached about the evening tide<br>
  The crossing where the roads divide;</p>
<p>And, waiting at the crossing place,<br>
  I saw a maiden fair of face,</p>
<p>With eyes of deepest violet blue,<br>
  And cheeks to match the rose in hue&mdash;</p>
<p>The fairest maids Australia knows<br>
  Are bred among the mountain snows.</p>
<p>Then, fearing I might go astray,<br>
  I asked if she could show the way.</p>
<p>Her voice might well a man bewitch&mdash;<br>
  Its tones so supple, deep, and rich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tracks are clear,&rdquo; she made reply,<br>
  &ldquo;And this goes down to Sydney  town,<br>
  And that one goes to Gundagai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then slowly, looking coyly back,<br>
  She went along the Sydney  track</p>
<p>And I for one was well content<br>
  To go the road the lady went;</p>
<p>But round the turn a swain she met&mdash;<br>
  The kiss she gave him haunts me yet!</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>I turned and travelled with a sigh<br>
  The lonely road to Gundagai.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="SaltbushBillsSecondFight"></a>Saltbush Bill&rsquo;s Second Fight</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;news came down on  the Castlereagh, and went to the world at large,<br>
  That twenty thousand travelling sheep, with  Saltbush Bill in charge.<br>
  Were drifting down from a dried-out run to  ravage the Castlereagh;<br>
  And the squatters swore when they heard the  news, and wished they were well away:<br>
  For the name and the fame of Saltbush Bill  were over the countryside<br>
  For the wonderful way that he fed his sheep,  and the dodges and tricks he tried.<br>
  He would lose his way on a Main Stock Route,  and stray to the squatters&rsquo; grass;<br>
  He would come to a run with the boss away, and  swear he had leave to pass;<br>
  And back of all and behind it all, as well the  squatters knew,<br>
  If he had to fight, he would fight all day, so  long as his sheep got through:<br>
  But this is the story of Stingy Smith, the  owner of Hard Times Hill,<br>
  And the way that he chanced on a fighting man  to reckon with Saltbush Bill. </p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas Stingy Smith on his stockyard sat, and  prayed for an early Spring,<br>
  When he started at sight of a clean-shaved  tramp, who walked with a jaunty swing;<br>
  For a clean-shaved tramp with a jaunty walk  a-swinging along the track<br>
  Is as rare a thing as a feathered frog on the  desolate roads out back.<br>
  So the tramp he made for the travellers&rsquo; hut,  to ask could he camp the night;<br>
  But Stingy Smith had a bright idea, and called  to him, &ldquo;Can you fight?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the game?&rdquo; said the clean-shaved  tramp, as he looked at him up and down;<br>
  &ldquo;If you want a battle, get off that fence, and  I&rsquo;ll kill you for half-a-crown!<br>
  But, Boss, you&rsquo;d better not fight with me&mdash;it  wouldn&rsquo;t be fair nor right;<br>
  I&rsquo;m Stiffener Joe, from the Rocks Brigade, and  I killed a man in a fight:<br>
  I served two years for it, fair and square,  and now I&rsquo;m a-trampin&rsquo; back,<br>
  To look for a peaceful quiet life away on the  outside track&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not myself, but a drover chap,&rdquo;  said Stingy Smith with glee<br>
  &ldquo;A bullying fellow called Saltbush Bill, and you are the man for me.<br>
  He&rsquo;s on the road with his hungry sheep, and he&rsquo;s certain to raise a row,<br>
  For he&rsquo;s bullied the whole of the Castlereagh till he&rsquo;s got them under cow&mdash;<br>
  Just pick a quarrel and raise a fight, and leather him good and hard,<br>
  And I&rsquo;ll take good care that his wretched sheep don&rsquo;t wander a half a yard.<br>
  It&rsquo;s a five-pound job if you belt him well&mdash;do anything short of kill,<br>
  For there isn&rsquo;t a beak on the Castlereagh will fine you for Saltbush Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the job,&rdquo; said the fighting  man; &ldquo;and, hot as this cove appears,<br>
  He&rsquo;ll stand no chance with a bloke like me, what&rsquo;s lived on the game for years;<br>
  For he&rsquo;s maybe learnt in a boxing school, and sparred for a round or so,<br>
  But I&rsquo;ve fought all hands in a ten-foot ring each night in a travelling show;<br>
  They earned a pound if they stayed three rounds, and they tried for it every  night<br>
  In a ten-foot ring! Oh, that&rsquo;s the game that teaches a bloke to fight,<br>
  For they&rsquo;d rush and clinch&mdash;it was Dublin Rules, and we drew no colour line;<br>
  And they all tried hard for to earn the pound, but they got no pound of mine.<br>
  If I saw no chance in the opening round I&rsquo;d slog at their wind, and wait<br>
  Till an opening came&mdash;and it <i>always</i> came&mdash;and I settled &rsquo;em, sure as fate;<br>
  Left on the ribs and right on the jaw&mdash;and, when the chance comes, <i>make sure!</i><br>
  And it&rsquo;s there a professional bloke like me gets home on an amateur:<br>
  For it&rsquo;s my experience every day, and I make no doubt it&rsquo;s yours,<br>
  That a third-class pro is an over-match for the best of the amateurs&mdash;&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, take your swag to the travellers&rsquo; hut,&rdquo; said Smith, &ldquo;for you waste your  breath;<br>
  You&rsquo;ve a first-class chance, if you lose the fight, of talking your man to  death.<br>
  I&rsquo;ll tell the cook you&rsquo;re to have your grub, and see that you eat your fill,<br>
  And come to the scratch all fit and well to leather this Saltbush Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas Saltbush Bill, and his travelling sheep  were wending their weary way<br>
  On the Main Stock Route, through the Hard  Times Run, on their six-mile stage a day;<br>
  And he strayed a mile from the Main Stock  Route, and started to feed along,<br>
  And when Stingy Smith came up Bill said that  the Route was surveyed wrong;<br>
  And he tried to prove that the sheep had  rushed and strayed from their camp at night,<br>
  But the fighting man he kicked Bill&rsquo;s dog, and  of course that meant a fight.<br>
  So they sparred and fought, and they shifted ground, and never a sound  was heard<br>
  But the thudding fists on their brawny ribs, and the seconds&rsquo; muttered word,<br>
  Till the fighting man shot home his left on the ribs with a mighty clout,<br>
  And his right flashed up with a half-arm blow&mdash;and Saltbush Bill &ldquo;went out&rdquo;.<br>
  He fell face down, and towards the blow; and their hearts with fear were  filled,<br>
  For he lay as still as a fallen tree, and they thought that he must be killed.</p>
<p>So Stingy Smith and the fighting man, they  lifted him from the ground,<br>
  And sent back home for a brandy-flask, and they slowly fetched him round;<br>
  But his head was bad, and his jaw was hurt&mdash;in fact, he could scarcely speak&mdash;<br>
  So they let him spell till he got his wits; and he camped on the run a week,<br>
  While the travelling sheep went here and there, wherever they liked to stray,<br>
  Till Saltbush Bill was fit once more for the track to the Castlereagh.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>Then Stingy Smith he wrote a note, and gave to  the fighting man:<br>
  &rsquo;Twas writ to the boss of the neighbouring  run, and thus the missive ran:<br>
  &ldquo;The man with this is a fighting man, one  Stiffener Joe by name;<br>
  He came near murdering Saltbush Bill, and I  found it a costly game:<br>
  But it&rsquo;s worth your while to employ the chap,  for there isn&rsquo;t the slightest doubt<br>
  You&rsquo;ll have no trouble from Saltbush Bill  while this man hangs about.&rdquo;<br>
  But an answer came by the next week&rsquo;s mail,  with news that might well appal:<br>
  &ldquo;The man you sent with a note is not a  fighting man at all!<br>
  He has shaved his beard, and has cut his hair,  but I spotted him at a look;<br>
  He is Tom Devine, who has worked for years for  Saltbush Bill as cook.<br>
  Bill coached him up in the fighting yard, and  taught him the tale by rote,<br>
  And they shammed to fight, and they got your  grass, and divided your five-pound note.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a clean take-in; and you&rsquo;ll find it  wise&mdash;&rsquo;twill save you a lot of pelf&mdash;<br>
  When next you&rsquo;re hiring a fighting man, just  fight him a round yourself.&rdquo; </p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>And the teamsters out on the Castlereagh, when  they meet with a week of rain,<br>
  And the waggon sinks to its axle-tree, deep  down in the black-soil plain,<br>
  When the bullocks wade in a sea of mud, and  strain at the load of wool,<br>
  And the cattle-dogs at the bullocks&rsquo; heels are  biting to make them pull,<br>
  When the off-side driver flays the team, and  curses them while he flogs,<br>
  And the air is thick with the language used,  and the clamour of men and dogs&mdash;<br>
  The teamsters say, as they pause to rest and  moisten each hairy throat,<br>
  They wish they could swear like Stingy Smith  when he read that neighbour&rsquo;s note.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="HardLuck"></a>Hard Luck</h2>
<p>I&nbsp;left&nbsp;the course, and by my side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There walked a ruined tout&mdash;<br>
  A hungry creature, evil-eyed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who poured this story out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there came a swell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Kensington today,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crown at least he&rsquo;d pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I picked three winners straight, I did;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I filled his purse with pelf,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To back one for myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A half-a-quid to me he cast&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted it indeed;<br>
  So help me Bob, for two days past<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t had a feed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But still I thought my luck was in,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t go astray&mdash;<br>
  I put it all on Little Min,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lost it straightaway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a bite or bed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m absolutely stuck;<br>
  So keep this lesson in your head:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t over-trust your luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The folks went homeward, near and far,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tout, oh! where was he?<br>
  Ask where the empty boilers are<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Circular Quay.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="SongoftheFederation"></a>Song of the Federation</h2>
<p>As&nbsp;the  nations sat together, grimly waiting&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce and ancient nations battle-scarred&mdash;<br>
  Grown grey in their lusting and their hating,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever armed and ever ready keeping guard,<br>
  Through the tumult of their warlike preparation<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the half-stilled clamour of the drums<br>
  Came a voice crying, &ldquo;Lo, a new-made Nation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her place in the sisterhood she comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  she came&mdash;she was beautiful as morning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bloom of the roses on her mouth,<br>
  Like a young queen lavishly adorning<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her charms with the splendours of the South.<br>
  And the fierce old nations, looking on her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, &ldquo;Nay, surely she were quickly overthrown;<br>
  Hath she strength for the burden laid upon her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath she power to protect and guard her own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  she spoke, and her voice was clear and ringing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ears of the nations old and grey,<br>
  Saying, &ldquo;Hark, and ye shall hear my children singing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their war-song in countries far away.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And always farther out.</p>
<p>The wind is in the barley-grass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wattles are in bloom;<br>
  The breezes greet us as they pass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With honey-sweet perfume;<br>
  The parakeets go screaming by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flash of golden wing,<br>
  And from the swamp the wild-ducks cry<br>
  Their long-drawn note of revelry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejoicing at the Spring.</p>
<p>So throw the weary pen aside<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the papers rest,<br>
  For we must saddle up and ride<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the blue hill&rsquo;s breast:<br>
  And we must travel far and fast<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across their rugged maze,<br>
  To find the Spring of Youth at last,<br>
  And call back from the buried past<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Australian ways.</p>
<p>When Clancy took the drover&rsquo;s track<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In years of long ago,<br>
  He drifted to the outer back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the Overflow;<br>
  By rolling plain and rocky shelf,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With stockwhip in his hand,<br>
  He reached at last (oh, lucky elf!)<br>
  The Town of Come-and-Help-Yourself<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Rough-and-Ready Land.</p>
<p>And if it be that you would know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tracks he used to ride,<br>
  Then you must saddle up and go<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the Queensland side&mdash;<br>
  Beyond the reach of rule or law,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ride the long day through,<br>
  In Nature&rsquo;s homestead&mdash;filled with awe:<br>
  You then might see what Clancy saw<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know what Clancy knew.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheBalladoftheCalliope"></a>The Ballad of the&nbsp;<i>Calliope</i></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By&nbsp;the far Samoan shore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where  the league-long rollers pour<br>
  All the wash of the Pacific on the coral-guarded bay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding  lightly at their ease,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  the calm of tropic seas,<br>
  The three great nations&rsquo; warships at their anchors proudly lay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding  lightly, head to wind,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With  the coral reefs behind,<br>
  Three German and three Yankee ships were mirrored in the blue;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  on one ship unfurled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was  the flag that rules the world&mdash;<br>
  For on the old&nbsp;<i>Calliope</i>&nbsp;the flag of England flew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  the gentle off-shore breeze,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  had scarcely stirred the trees,<br>
  Dropped down to utter stillness, and the glass began to fall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away  across the main<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowered  the coming hurricane,<br>
  And far away to seaward hung the cloud-wrack like a pall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If  the word had passed around,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let  us move to safer ground;<br>
  Let us steam away to seaward&rdquo;&mdash;then this tale were not to tell!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  each Captain seemed to say<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If  the others stay, I stay!&rdquo;<br>
  And they lingered at their moorings till the shades of evening fell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then  the cloud-wrack neared them fast,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  there came a sudden blast,<br>
  And the hurricane came leaping down a thousand miles of main!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like  a lion on its prey,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leapt  the storm fiend on the bay,<br>
  And the vessels shook and shivered as their cables felt the strain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As  the surging seas came by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  were running mountains high,<br>
  The vessels started dragging, drifting slowly to the lee;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  the darkness of the night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hid  the coral reefs from sight,<br>
  And the Captains dared not risk the chance to grope their way to sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  the dark they dared not shift!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They  were forced to wait and drift;<br>
  All hands stood by uncertain would the anchors hold or no.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  the men on deck could see,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If  a chance for them might be,<br>
  There was little chance of safety for the men who were below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through  that long, long night of dread,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While  the storm raged overhead,<br>
  They were waiting by their engines, with the furnace fires aroar;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  they waited, staunch and true,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though  they knew, and well they knew,<br>
  They must drown like rats imprisoned if the vessel touched the shore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  the grey dawn broke at last,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  the long, long night was past,<br>
  While the hurricane redoubled, lest its prey should steal away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On  the rocks, all smashed and strown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were  the German vessels thrown,<br>
  While the Yankees, swamped and helpless, drifted shorewards down the bay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then  at last spoke Captain Kane,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All  our anchors are in vain,<br>
  And the Germans and the Yankees they have drifted to the lee!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut  the cables at the bow!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  must trust the engines now!<br>
  Give her steam, and let her have it, lads! we&rsquo;ll fight her out to sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  the answer came with cheers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From  the stalwart engineers,<br>
  From the grim and grimy firemen at the furnaces below;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  above the sullen roar<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of  the breakers on the shore<br>
  Came the throbbing of the engines as they laboured to and fro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If  the strain should find a flaw,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should  a bolt or rivet draw,<br>
  Then&mdash;God help them! for the vessel were a plaything in the tide!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With  a face of honest cheer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth  an English engineer,<br>
  &ldquo;I will answer for the engines that were built on old Thames-side!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For  the stays and stanchions taut,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For  the rivets truly wrought,<br>
  For the valves that fit their faces as a glove should fit the hand.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give  her every ounce of power;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If  we make a knot an hour<br>
  Then it&rsquo;s way enough to steer her, and we&rsquo;ll drive her from the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like  a foam-flake tossed and thrown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She  could barely hold her own,<br>
  While the other ships all helplessly were drifting to the lee.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through  the smother and the rout<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;<i>Calliope</i>&nbsp;steamed  out&rsquo;<br>
  And they cheered her from the&nbsp;<i>Trenton</i>&nbsp;that  was foundering in the sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay!  drifting shoreward there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All  helpless as they were,<br>
  Their vessel hurled upon the reefs as weed ashore is hurled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without  a thought of fear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Yankees raised a cheer&mdash;<br>
  A cheer that English-speaking folk should echo round the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is telling its tale;<br>
  As some grim old stayer hard-pressed<br>

  Though the spurs have left marks of the fray,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the sweat on the ears<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they roll up the track,<br>
  They know just as well their success<br>

<h2 align="center"><a name="PassingofGundagai"></a>Passing of Gundagai</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;introdooce a friend!&rdquo; he said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And if you&rsquo;ve got a vacant pen<br>
  You&rsquo;d better take him in the shed<br>
  And start him shearing straight ahead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s one of these here quiet men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never strikes&mdash;that ain&rsquo;t his game;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the others try<br>
  <i>He</i>&nbsp;goes on shearing just the same.<br>
  I never rightly knew his name&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We always call him &lsquo;Gundagai&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our flashest shearer then had gone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To train a racehorse for a race,<br>
  And while his sporting fit was on<br>
  He couldn&rsquo;t be relied upon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So &lsquo;Gundagai&rsquo; shore in his place.</p>
<p>Alas for man&rsquo;s veracity!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For reputations false and true!<br>
  This &lsquo;Gundagai&rsquo; turned out to be,<br>
  For strife and all-round villainy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very worst I ever knew!</p>
<p>He started racing Jack Devine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grumbled when I made him stop.<br>
  The pace he showed was extra fine,<br>
  But all those pure-bred ewes of mine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were bleeding like a butcher&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>He cursed the sheep, he cursed the shed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From roof to rafter, floor to shelf;<br>
  As for my mongrel ewes, he said,<br>
  I ought to get a razor blade<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shave the blooming things myself.</p>
<p>On Sundays he controlled a &ldquo;school&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And played &ldquo;two-up&rdquo; the livelong day;<br>
  And many a young confiding fool<br>
  He shore of his financial wool;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he lost he would not pay.</p>
<p>He organised a shearers&rsquo; race,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &ldquo;touched&rdquo; me to provide the prize.<br>
  His packhorse showed surprising pace<br>
  And won hands down&mdash;he was The Ace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A well-known racehorse in disguise.</p>
<p>Next day the bruiser of the shed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Displayed an opal-tinted eye,<br>
  With large contusions on his head.<br>
  He smiled a sickly smile, and said<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d &ldquo;had a cut at Gundagai!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just as we were getting full<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of &lsquo;Gundagai&rsquo; and all his ways,<br>
  A telegram for &ldquo;Henry Bull&rdquo;<br>
  Arrived. Said he, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me&mdash;all wool!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s see what this here message says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened it, his face grew white,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dropped the shears and turned away.<br>
  It ran, &ldquo;Your wife took bad last night;<br>
  Come home at once&mdash;no time to write,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fear she may not last the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got his cheque&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t care<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dock him for my mangled ewes;<br>
  His store account&mdash;we &lsquo;called it square&rsquo;.<br>
  Poor wretch! he had enough to bear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confronted by such dreadful news.</p>
<p>The shearers raised a little purse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help a mate, as shearers will,<br>
  &ldquo;To pay the doctor and the nurse,<br>
  And if there should be something worse &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pay the undertaker&rsquo;s bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They wrung his hand in sympathy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rode away without a word,<br>
  His head hung down in misery.<br>
  A wandering hawker passing by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was told of what had just occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! that&rsquo;s a curious thing,&rdquo; he said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known that feller all his life&mdash;<br>
  He&rsquo;s had the loan of this here shed!<br>
  I know his wife ain&rsquo;t nearly dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he&nbsp;<i>hasn&rsquo;t got a wife</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * *  * * *</b></p>
<p>You should have heard the whipcord crack<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As angry shearers galloped by,<br>
  In vain they tried to fetch him back.<br>
  A little dust along the track<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was all they saw of &lsquo;Gundagai&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheWargeilahHandicap"></a>The Wargeilah Handicap</h2>
<p>Wargeilah&nbsp;town is very  small,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s no cathedral  nor a club,<br>
  In fact the township, all in all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is just one  unpretentious pub;<br>
  And there, from all the stations round,<br>
  The local sportsmen can be found. </p>
<p>The sportsmen of Wargeilah side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are very few but very fit:<br>
  There&rsquo;s scarcely any sport been tried<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what they held their own at it<br>
  In fact, to search their records o&rsquo;er,<br>
  They held their own and something more.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas round about Wargeilah town<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An English new-chum did infest:<br>
  He used to wander up and down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In baggy English breeches drest &mdash;<br>
  His mental aspect seemed to be<br>
  Just stolid self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>The local sportsmen vainly sought<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tranquil calm to counteract,<br>
  By urging that he should be brought<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the Noxious Creatures Act.<br>
  &ldquo;Nay, harm him not,&rdquo; said one more wise,<br>
  &ldquo;He is a blessing in disguise!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, he wants to buy a horse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ride, and hunt, and steeplechase,<br>
  And carry ladies, too, of course,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pull a cart and win a race.<br>
  Good gracious! he must be a flat<br>
  To think he&rsquo;ll get a horse like that!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But since he has so little sense<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such a lot of cash to burn,<br>
  We&rsquo;ll sell him some experience<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By which alone a fool can learn.<br>
  Suppose we let him have The Trap<br>
  To win Wargeilah Handicap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here, I must explain to you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, round about Wargeilah run,<br>
  There lived a very aged screw<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose days of brilliancy were done:<br>
  A grand old warrior in his prime&mdash;<br>
  But age will beat us all in time.</p>
<p>A trooper&rsquo;s horse in seasons past<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did his share to keep the peace,<br>
  But took to falling, and at last<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was cast for age from the Police.<br>
  A publican at Conroy&rsquo;s Gap<br>
  Then bought and christened him The Trap.</p>
<p>When grass was good, and horses dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He changed his owner now and then<br>
  At prices ranging somewhere near<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbourhood of two pound ten:<br>
  And manfully he earned his keep<br>
  By yarding cows and ration sheep.</p>
<p>They brought him in from off the grass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fed and groomed the old horse up;<br>
  His coat began to shine like glass &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;d win the Melbourne Cup.<br>
  And when they&rsquo;d got him fat and flash<br>
  They asked the new-chum&mdash;fifty&mdash;cash!</p>
<p>And when he said the price was high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their indignation knew no bounds.<br>
  They said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s seldom you can buy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A horse like that for fifty pounds!<br>
  We&rsquo;ll refund twenty if The Trap<br>
  Should fail to win the handicap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deed was done, the price was paid,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new-chum put the horse in train:<br>
  The local sports were much afraid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he would sad experience gain,<br>
  By racing with some shearer&rsquo;s hack,<br>
  Who&rsquo;d beat him half-way round the track.</p>
<p>So, on this guileless English spark<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did most fervently impress<br>
  That he must keep the matter dark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not let any person guess<br>
  That he was purchasing The Trap<br>
  To win Wargeilah Handicap.</p>
<p>They spoke of &ldquo;spielers from the Bland&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &ldquo;champions from the Castlereagh&rdquo;,<br>
  And gave the youth to understand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all of these would stop away,<br>
  And spoil the race, if they should hear<br>
  That they had got The Trap to fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep dark! They&rsquo;ll muster thick as flies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When once the news gets sent around<br>
  We&rsquo;re giving such a splendid prize&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Snowdon horse worth fifty pound!<br>
  They&rsquo;ll come right in from Dandaloo,<br>
  And find&mdash;that it&rsquo;s a gift to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>The race came on&mdash;with no display,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor any calling of the  card,<br>
  But round about the pub all day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crowd of shearers,  drinking hard,<br>
  And using language in a strain<br>
  &rsquo;Twere flattery to call profane. </p>
<p>Our hero, dressed in silk attire&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue jacket and a scarlet cap&mdash;<br>
  With boots that shone like flames of fire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now did his canter on The Trap,<br>
  And walked him up and round about,<br>
  Until the other steeds came out.</p>
<p>He eyed them with a haughty look,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But saw a sight that caught his breath!<br>
  It was! Ah John! The Chinee cook!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In boots and breeches! Pale as death!<br>
  Tied with a rope, like any sack,<br>
  Upon a piebald pony&rsquo;s back!</p>
<p>The next, a colt &mdash; all mud and burrs!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-broken, with a black boy up,<br>
  Who said, &ldquo;You gim&rsquo;me pair o&rsquo; spurs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;win  the bloomin&rsquo; Melbourne Cup!&rdquo;&rsquo;<br>
  These two were to oppose The Trap<br>
  For the Wargeilah Handicap!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re off! The colt whipped down his  head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And humped his back and gave a squeal,<br>
  And bucked into the drinking shed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolving like a Cath&rsquo;rine wheel!<br>
  Men ran like rats! The atmosphere<br>
  Was filled with oaths and pints of beer!</p>
<p>But up the course the bold Ah John<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside The Trap raced neck and neck:<br>
  The boys had tied him firmly on,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which ultimately proved his wreck,<br>
  The saddle turned, and, like a clown,<br>
  He rode some distance upside down.</p>
<p>His legs around the horse were tied,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His feet towards the heavens were spread,<br>
  He swung and bumped at every stride<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ploughed the ground up with his head!<br>
  And when they rescued him, The Trap<br>
  Had won Wargeilah Handicap!</p>
<p>And no enquiries we could make<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could tell by what false statements swayed<br>
  Ah John was led to undertake<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A task so foreign to his trade!<br>
  He only smiled and said, &ldquo;Hoo Ki!<br>
  I stop topside, I win all li&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But never, in Wargeilah Town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was heard so eloquent a cheer<br>
  As when the President came down,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And toasted, in Colonial Beer,<br>
  &ldquo;The finest rider on the course!<br>
  The winner of the Snowdon Horse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go and get your prize,&rdquo; he said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s with a wild mob, somewhere round<br>
  The mountains near The Watershed;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s honestly worth fifty pound,&mdash;<br>
  A noble horse, indeed, to win,<br>
  But none of&nbsp;<i>us</i>&nbsp;can run him in!</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve chased him poor, we&rsquo;ve chased him  fat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve run him till our horses dropped,<br>
  But by such obstacles as that<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man like you will not be stopped,<br>

<p>They&nbsp;held a polo meeting at a little country town,<br>
  And all the local sportsmen came to win themselves renown.<br>
  There came two strangers with a horse, and I am much afraid<br>
  They both belonged to what is called &ldquo;the take-you-down brigade&rdquo;.</p>
<p>They said their horse could jump like fun, and asked an amateur<br>
  To ride him in the steeplechase, and told him they were sure,<br>
  The last time round, he&rsquo;d sail away with such a swallow&rsquo;s flight<br>
  The rest would never see him go&mdash;he&rsquo;d finish out of sight.</p>
<p>So out he went; and, when folk saw the amateur was up,<br>
  Some local genius called the race &ldquo;the Dude-in-Danger Cup&rdquo;.<br>
  The horse was known as &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Afraid&rdquo;, by &ldquo;Panic&rdquo; from &ldquo;The Fright&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  But still his owners told the jock he&rsquo;d finish out of sight.</p>
<p>And so he did; for Who&rsquo;s Afraid, without the least pretence,<br>
  Disposed of him by rushing through the very second fence;<br>
  And when they ran the last time round the prophecy was right&mdash;<br>
  For he was in the ambulance, and safely &ldquo;out of sight&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;sheep were shorn  and the wool went down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of our  local racing:<br>
  And I&rsquo;d earned a spell&mdash;I was burnt and brown&mdash;<br>
  So I rolled my swag for a trip to town<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a look at the  steeplechasing. </p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas rough and ready&mdash;an uncleared course<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As rough as the blacks had found it;<br>
  With barbed-wire fences, topped with gorse,<br>
  And a water-jump that would drown a horse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the steeple three times round it.</p>
<p>There was never a fence the tracks to  guard,&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some straggling posts defined &rsquo;em:<br>
  And the day was hot, and the drinking hard,<br>
  Till none of the stewards could see a yard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before nor yet behind &rsquo;em!</p>
<p>But the bell was rung and the nags were  out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excepting an old outsider<br>
  Whose trainer started an awful rout,<br>
  For his boy had gone on a drinking bout<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left him without a rider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there not one man in the crowd,&rdquo; he  cried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In the whole of the crowd so clever,<br>
  Is there not one man that will take a ride<br>
  On the old white horse from the Northern side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was bred on the Mooki River?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twas an old white horse that they called  The Cow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a cow would look well beside him;<br>
  But I was pluckier then than now<br>
  (And I wanted excitement anyhow),<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at last I agreed to ride him.</p>
<p>And the trainer said, &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s dreadful  slow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he hasn&rsquo;t a chance whatever;<br>
  But I&rsquo;m stony broke, so it&rsquo;s time to show<br>
  A trick or two that the trainers know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who train by the Mooki River.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first time round at the further side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the trees and the scrub about you,<br>
  Just pull behind them and run out wide<br>
  And then dodge into the scrub and hide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let them go round without you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the third time round, for the final  spin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the pace, and the dust to blind &rsquo;em,<br>
  They&rsquo;ll never notice if you chip in<br>
  For the last half-mile&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be sure to win,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they&rsquo;ll think you raced behind &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the water-jump you may have to swim&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn&rsquo;t a hope to clear it&mdash;<br>
  Unless he skims like the swallows skim<br>
  At full speed over, but not for him!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll never go next or near it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you worry&mdash;just plunge across,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he swims like a well-trained setter.<br>
  Then hide away in the scrub and gorse<br>
  The rest will be far ahead of course&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The further ahead the better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must rush the jumps in the last  half-round<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear that he might refuse &rsquo;em;<br>
  He&rsquo;ll try to baulk with you, I&rsquo;ll be bound,<br>
  Take whip and spurs on the mean old hound,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And don&rsquo;t be afraid to use &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the final round, when the field are  slow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you are quite fresh to meet &rsquo;em,<br>
  Sit down, and hustle him all you know<br>
  With the whip and spurs, and he&rsquo;ll have to go&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, you&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<i>got</i>&nbsp;to beat &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flag went down and we seemed to fly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we made the  timbers shiver<br>
  Of the first big fence, as the stand flashed  by,<br>
  And I caught the ring of the trainer&rsquo;s cry:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Go on! For the Mooki River!&rdquo; </p>
<p>I jammed him in with a well-packed crush,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And recklessly&mdash;out for slaughter&mdash;<br>
  Like a living wave over fence and brush<br>
  We swept and swung with a flying rush,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till we came to the dreaded water.</p>
<p>Ha, ha! I laugh at it now to think<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the way I contrived to work it.<br>
  Shut in amongst them, before you&rsquo;d wink,<br>
  He found himself on the water&rsquo;s brink,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With never a chance to shirk it!</p>
<p>The thought of the horror he felt,  beguiles<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of this grizzled rover!<br>
  He gave a snort you could hear for miles,<br>
  And a spring would have cleared the Channel Isles<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And carried me safely over!</p>
<p>Then we neared the scrub, and I pulled him  back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shade where the gum-leaves quiver:<br>
  And I waited there in the shadows black<br>
  While the rest of the horses, round the track,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went on like a rushing river!</p>
<p>At the second round, as the field swept  by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw that the pace was telling;<br>
  But on they thundered, and by-and-bye<br>
  As they passed the stand I could hear the cry<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the folk in the distance, yelling!</p>
<p>Then the last time round! And the  hoofbeats rang!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I said, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s now or never!&rdquo;<br>
  And out on the heels of the throng I sprang,<br>
  And the spurs bit deep and the whipcord sang<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I rode! For the Mooki River!</p>
<p>We raced for home in a cloud of dust<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the curses rose in chorus.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas flog, and hustle, and jump you must!<br>
  And The Cow ran well&mdash;but to my disgust<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one got home before us.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas a big black horse, that I had not  seen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the part of the race I&rsquo;d ridden;<br>
  And his coat was cool and his rider clean,<br>
  And I thought that perhaps I had not been<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one that had hidden.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>And the trainer came with a visage blue<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rage, when the race  concluded:<br>
  Said he, &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d have pulled us  through,<br>
  But the man on the black horse planted too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>And nearer to home  than you did!</i>&rdquo; </p>
<p>Alas to think that those times so gay<br>

  Made themselves kings of the district&mdash;ruled it  in old-fashioned ways&mdash;<br>
  Robbing the coach and the escort, stealing our  horses at night,<br>
  Calling sometimes at the homesteads and giving  the women a fright:<br>
  Came to the station one morning&mdash;and why they  did this no one knows&mdash;<br>
  Took a brood mare from the paddock&mdash;wanting  some fun, I suppose&mdash;<br>
  Fastened a bucket beneath her, hung by a strap  round her flank,<br>
  Then turned her loose in the timber back of  the seven-mile tank. </p>
<p>Go! She went mad! She went tearing and  screaming with fear through the trees,<br>
  While the curst bucket beneath her was banging her flanks and her knees.<br>
  Bucking and racing and screaming she ran to the back of the run,<br>
  Killed herself there in a gully; by God, but they paid for their fun!<br>
  Paid for it dear, for the black-boys found tracks, and the bucket, and all,<br>
  And I swore that I&rsquo;d live to get even with Gilbert, O&rsquo;Malley and Hall.</p>
<p>Day after day then I chased them&mdash;&rsquo;course  they had friends on the sly,<br>
  Friends who were willing to sell them to those who were willing to buy.<br>
  Early one morning we found them in camp at the Cockatoo Farm<br>
  One of us shot at O&rsquo;Mally and wounded him under the arm:<br>
  Ran them for miles in the ranges, till Hall, with his horse fairly beat,<br>
  Took to the rocks and we lost him&mdash;the others made good their retreat.<br>
  It was war to the knife then, I tell you, and once, on the door of my shed,<br>
  They nailed up a notice that offered a hundred reward for my head!</p>
<p>Then we heard they were gone from the  district; they stuck up a coach in the West,<br>
  And I rode by myself in the paddocks, taking a bit of a rest,<br>
  Riding this colt as a youngster&mdash;awkward, half-broken and shy,<br>
  He wheeled round one day on a sudden; I looked, but I couldn&rsquo;t see why,&mdash;<br>
  But I soon found out why, for before me, the hillside rose up like a wall,<br>
  And there on the top with their rifles were Gilbert, O&rsquo;Malley and Hall!</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas a good three-mile run to the  homestead&mdash;bad going, with plenty of trees&mdash;<br>
  So I gathered the youngster together, and gripped at his ribs with my knees.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a mighty poor chance to escape them! It puts a man&rsquo;s nerve to the test<br>
  On a half-broken colt to be hunted by the best mounted men in the West.<br>
  But the half-broken colt was a racehorse! He lay down to work with a will,<br>
  Flashed through the scrub like a clean-skin&mdash;by heavens we&nbsp;<i>flew</i>&nbsp;down  the hill!<br>
  Over a twenty-foot gully he swept with the spring of a deer<br>
  And they fired as we jumped, but they missed me&mdash;a bullet sang close to my ear&mdash;<br>
  And the jump gained us ground, for they shirked it: but I saw as we raced  through the gap<br>
  That the rails at the homestead were fastened&mdash;I was caught like a rat in a  trap.<br>
  Fenced with barbed wire was the paddock&mdash;barbed wire that would cut like a  knife&mdash;<br>
  How was a youngster to clear it that never had jumped in his life?</p>
<p>Bang went a rifle behind me&mdash;the colt gave  a spring, he was hit;<br>
  Straight at the sliprails I rode him&mdash;I felt him take hold of the bit;<br>
  Never a foot to the right or the left did he swerve in his stride,<br>
  Awkward and frightened, but honest, the sort it&rsquo;s a pleasure to ride!<br>
  Straight at the rails, where they&rsquo;d fastened barbed wire on the top of the  post,<br>
  Rose like a stag and went over, with hardly a scratch at the most;<br>
  Into the homestead I darted, and snatched down my gun from the wall,<br>
  And I tell you I made them step lively, Gilbert, O&rsquo;Malley and Hall!</p>
<p>Yes! There&rsquo;s the mark of the bullet&mdash;he&rsquo;s  got it inside of him yet<br>
  Mixed up somehow with his victuals, but bless you, he don&rsquo;t seem to fret!<br>
  Gluttonous, ugly, and lazy&mdash;eats any thing he can bite;<br>
  Now, let us shut up the stable, and bid the old fellow good night:<br>
  Ah! We can&rsquo;t breed &rsquo;em, the sort that were bred when we old &rsquo;uns were young.<br>
  Yes, I was saying, these bushrangers, none of &rsquo;em lived to be hung,<br>
  Gilbert was shot by the troopers, Hall was betrayed by his friend,<br>
  Campbell  disposed of O&rsquo;Mally, bringing the lot to an end.<br>
  But you can talk about riding&mdash;I&rsquo;ve ridden a lot in the past&mdash;<br>
  Wait till there&rsquo;s rifles behind you, you&rsquo;ll know what it means to go fast!<br>
  I&rsquo;ve steeplechased, raced, and &ldquo;run horses&rdquo;, but I think the most dashing of  all<br>
  Was the ride when the old fellow saved me from Gilbert, O&rsquo;Malley and Hall!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="HeGivethHisBelovedSleep"></a>&ldquo;He Giveth His Beloved Sleep&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;long day passes with its load of sorrow:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In slumber deep<br>
  I lay me down to rest until to-morrow&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God for sleep.</p>
<p>Thank God for all respite from weary toiling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From cares that creep<br>
  Across our lives like evil shadows, spoiling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God&rsquo;s kindly sleep.</p>
<p>We plough and sow, and, as the hours grow later,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We strive to reap,<br>
  And build our barns, and hope to build them greater<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we sleep.</p>
<p>We toil and strain and strive with one another<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hopes to heap<br>
  Some greater share of profit than our brother<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we sleep.</p>
<p>What will it profit that with tears or laughter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our watch we keep?<br>
  Beyond it all there lies the Great Hereafter!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God for sleep!</p>
<p>For, at the last, beseeching Christ to save us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We turn with deep<br>
  Heart-felt thanksgiving unto God, who gave us<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gift of Sleep.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="DriverSmith"></a>Driver Smith</h2>
<p>&rsquo;Twas&nbsp;Driver Smith of Battery A was anxious to see a fight;<br>
  He thought of the Transvaal all the day, he thought of it all the night&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Well, if the battery&rsquo;s left behind, I&rsquo;ll go to the war,&rdquo; says he,<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go a-driving an ambulance in the ranks of the A.M.C.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fairly sick of these here parades,&mdash;it&rsquo;s want of a change that  kills&mdash;<br>
  A-charging the Randwick  Rifle Range and aiming at Surry Hills.<br>
  And I think if I go with the ambulance I&rsquo;m certain to find a show,<br>
  For they have to send the Medical men wherever the troops can go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever the rifle bullets flash and the Maxims raise a din,<br>
  It&rsquo;s there you&rsquo;ll find the Medical men a-raking the wounded in&mdash;<br>
  A-raking &rsquo;em in like human flies&mdash;and a driver smart like me<br>
  Will find some scope for his extra skill in the ranks of the A.M.C.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Driver Smith he went to the war a-cracking his driver&rsquo;s whip,<br>
  From ambulance to collecting base they showed him his regular trip.<br>
  And he said to the boys that were marching past, as he gave his whip a crack,<br>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll walk yourselves to the fight,&rdquo; says he&mdash;&ldquo;Lord spare me, I&rsquo;ll drive you  back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, the fight went on in the Transvaal  hills for the half of a day or more,<br>
  And Driver Smith he worked his trip&mdash;all aboard for the seat of war!<br>
  He took his load from the stretcher men and hurried &rsquo;em homeward fast<br>
  Till he heard a sound that he knew full well&mdash;a battery rolling past.</p>
<p>He heard the clink of the leading chains and the roll of the guns  behind&mdash;<br>
  He heard the crack of the drivers&rsquo; whips, and he says to &rsquo;em, &ldquo;Strike me blind,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll miss me trip with this ambulance, although I don&rsquo;t care to shirk,<br>
  But I&rsquo;ll take the car off the line to-day and follow the guns at work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up the Battery Colonel came a-cursing &rsquo;em black in the face.<br>
  &ldquo;Sit down and shift &rsquo;em, you drivers there, and gallop &rsquo;em into place.&rdquo;<br>
  So off the Battery rolled and swung, a-going a  merry dance,<br>
  And holding his own with the leading gun goes Smith with his ambulance.</p>
<p>They opened fire on the mountain side, a-peppering by and large,<br>
  When over the hill above their flank the Boers came down at the charge;<br>
  They rushed the guns with a daring rush, a-volleying left and right,<br>
  And Driver Smith with his ambulance moved up to the edge of the fight.</p>
<p>The gunners stuck to their guns like men, and fought like the wild  cats fight,<br>
  For a Battery man don&rsquo;t leave his gun with ever a hope in sight;<br>
  But the bullets sang and the Mausers cracked and the Battery men gave way,<br>
  Till Driver Smith with his ambulance drove into the thick of the fray.</p>
<p>He saw the head of the Transvaal troop a-thundering to and fro,<br>
  A hard old face with a monkey beard&mdash;a face that he seemed to know;<br>
  &ldquo;Now, who&rsquo;s that leader,&rdquo; said Driver Smith, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him before to-day.<br>
  Why, bless my heart, but it&rsquo;s Kruger&rsquo;s self,&rdquo; and he jumped for him straight  away.</p>
<p>He collared old Kruger round the waist and hustled him into the  van.<br>
  It wasn&rsquo;t according to stretcher drill for raising a wounded man;<br>
  But he forced him in and said, &ldquo;All aboard, we&rsquo;re off for a little ride,<br>
  And you&rsquo;ll have the car to yourself,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;re full inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wheeled his team on the mountain side and set &rsquo;em a merry pace,<br>
  A-galloping over the rocks and stones, and a lot of the Boers gave chase;<br>
  But Driver Smith had a fairish start, and he said to the Boers, &ldquo;Good-day,<br>
  You have Buckley&rsquo;s chance for to catch a man that was trained in Battery A.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drove his team to the hospital and said to the P.M.O.,<br>
  &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir, but I missed a trip, mistaking the way to go;<br>
  And Kruger came to the ambulance and asked could we spare a bed,<br>
  So I fetched him here, and we&rsquo;ll take him home to show for a bob a head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the word went round to the English troops to say they need  fight no more,<br>
  For Driver Smith with his ambulance had ended the blooming war:<br>
  And in London  now at the music halls he&rsquo;s starring it every night,<br>
And drawing a hundred pounds a week to tell how he won the fight.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheresAnotherBlessedHorseFellDown"></a>There&rsquo;s Another Blessed Horse Fell Down</h2>
<p>When&nbsp;you&rsquo;re lying in  your hammock, sleeping soft and sleeping sound,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a care or  trouble on your mind,<br>
  And there&rsquo;s nothing to disturb you but the  engines going round,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&rsquo;re dreaming of  the girl you left behind;<br>
  In the middle of your joys you&rsquo;ll be wakened  by a noise,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a clatter on the  deck above your crown,<br>
  And you&rsquo;ll hear the corporal shout as he turns  the picket out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another  blessed horse fell down.&rdquo; </p>
<p>You can see &rsquo;em in the morning, when  you&rsquo;re cleaning out the stall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-leaning on the railings nearly dead,<br>
  And you reckon by the evening they&rsquo;ll be pretty sure to fall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you curse them as you tumble into bed.<br>
  Oh, you&rsquo;ll hear it pretty soon, &ldquo;Pass the word for Denny Moon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a horse here throwing handsprings like a  clown;&rdquo;<br>
  And it&rsquo;s shove the others back or he&rsquo;ll cripple half the pack,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another blessed horse fell down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when the war is over and the fighting  all is done,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&rsquo;re all at home with medals on your chest,<br>
  And you&rsquo;ve learnt to sleep so soundly that the firing of a gun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At your bedside wouldn&rsquo;t rob you of your rest;<br>
  As you lie in slumber deep, if your wife walks in her sleep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tumbles down the stairs and breaks her crown,<br>
  Oh, it won&rsquo;t awaken you, for you&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing new,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s another blessed horse fell down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="OntheTrek"></a>On the Trek</b></h2>
<p>Oh, the weary, weary journey on the trek, day after day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sun above and silent veldt below;<br>
  And our hearts keep turning homeward to the youngsters far away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the homestead where the climbing roses grow.<br>
  Shall we see the flats grow golden with the ripening of the grain?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we hear the parrots calling on the bough?<br>
  Ah! the weary months of marching ere we hear them call again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we&rsquo;re going on a long job now.</p>
<p>In the drowsy days on escort, riding slowly half asleep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the endless line of waggons stretching back,<br>
  While the khaki soldiers travel like a mob of travelling sheep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plodding silent on the never-ending track,<br>
  While the constant snap and sniping of the foe you never see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes you wonder will your turn come&mdash;when and how?<br>
  As the Mauser ball hums past you like a vicious kind of bee&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! we&rsquo;re going on a long job now.</p>
<p>When the dash and the excitement and the novelty are dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&rsquo;ve seen a load of wounded once or twice,<br>
  Or you&rsquo;ve watched your old mate dying, with the vultures overhead,&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you wonder if the war is worth the price.<br>
  And down along Monaro now they&rsquo;re starting out to shear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can picture the excitement and the row;<br>
  But they&rsquo;ll miss me on the Lachlan when they  call the roll this year,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we&rsquo;re going on a long job now.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheLastParade"></a>The Last Parade</h2>
<p>With&nbsp;never  a sound of trumpet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With never a flag displayed,<br>
  The last of the old campaigners<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lined up for the last parade.</p>
<p>Weary  they were and battered,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoeless, and knocked about;<br>
  From under their ragged forelocks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hungry eyes looked out.</p>
<p>And  they watched as the old commander<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read out, to the cheering men,<br>
  The Nation&rsquo;s thanks and the orders<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry them home again.</p>
<p>And  the last of the old campaigners,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinewy, lean, and spare&mdash;<br>
  He spoke for his hungry comrades:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Have we not done our share?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starving  and tired and thirsty<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We limped on the blazing plain;<br>
  And after a long night&rsquo;s picket<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You saddled us up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  froze on the wind-swept kopjes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the frost lay snowy-white.<br>
  Never a halt in the daytime,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never a rest at night!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  knew when the rifles rattled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the hillside bare and brown,<br>
  And over our weary shoulders<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We felt warm blood run down,</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  we turned for the stretching gallop,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crushed to the earth with weight;<br>
  But we carried our riders through it&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carried them perhaps too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steel!  We were steel to stand it&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We that have lasted through,<br>
  We that are old campaigners<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitiful, poor, and few.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over  the sea you brought us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the leagues of foam:<br>
  Now we have served you fairly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you not take us home?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home  to the Hunter River,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the flats where the lucerne grows;<br>
  Home where the Murrumbidgee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Runs white with the melted snows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  is a small thing surely!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will not you give command<br>
  That the last of the old campaigners<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go back to their native land?&rsquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>They looked at the grim commander,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never a sign he made.<br>
  &ldquo;Dismiss!&rdquo; and the old campaigners<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moved off from their last parade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="WithFrenchtoKimberley"></a>With French to Kimberley</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;Boers were down  on Kimberley with siege and Maxim gun;<br>
  The Boers were down on Kimberley, their numbers ten to one!<br>
  Faint were the hopes the British had to make  the struggle good&mdash;<br>
  Defenceless in an open plain the Diamond City stood.<br>
  They built them forts with bags of sand, they  fought from roof and wall,<br>
  They flashed a message to the south, &ldquo;Help! or  the town must fall!&rdquo;<br>
  Then down our ranks the order ran to march at  dawn of day,<br>
  And French was off to Kimberley to drive the Boers away. </p>
<p>He made no march along the line; he made  no front attack<br>
  Upon those Magersfontein heights that held the Scotchmen back;<br>
  But eastward over pathless plains, by open veldt and vley.<br>
  Across the front of Cronje&rsquo;s force his troopers held their way.<br>
  The springbuck, feeding on the flats where Modder River  runs,<br>
  Were startled by his horses&rsquo; hoofs, the rumble of his guns.<br>
  The Dutchman&rsquo;s spies that watched his march from every rocky wall<br>
  Rode back in haste: &ldquo;He marches East! He threatens Jacobsdal!&rdquo;<br>
  Then north he wheeled as wheels the hawk, and showed to their dismay<br>
  That French was off to Kimberley  to drive the Boers away.</p>
<p>His column was five thousand strong&mdash;all  mounted men&mdash;and guns:<br>
  There met, beneath the world-wide flag, the world-wide Empire&rsquo;s sons;<br>
  They came to prove to all the earth that kinship conquers space,<br>
  And those who fight the British Isles must  fight the British race!<br>
  From far New Zealand&rsquo;s flax and fern, from cold Canadian snows,<br>
  From Queensland plains, where hot as fire the summer sunshine glows&mdash;<br>
  And in the front the Lancers rode that New South Wales had sent:<br>
  With easy stride across the plain their long, lean Walers went.<br>
  Unknown, untried, those squadrons were, but proudly out they drew<br>
  Beside the English regiments that fought at Waterloo.<br>
  From every coast, from every clime, they met in proud array<br>
  To go with French to Kimberley  to drive the Boers away.</p>
<p>He crossed the Reit and fought his way  towards the Modder bank.<br>
  The foemen closed behind his march, and hung upon the flank.<br>
  The long, dry grass was all ablaze and fierce the veldt fire runs;<br>
  He fought them through a wall of flame that blazed around the guns!<br>
  Then limbered up and drove at speed, though horses fell and died;<br>
  We might not halt for man nor beast on that wild, daring ride.<br>
  Black with the smoke and parched with thirst, we pressed the livelong day<br>
  Our headlong march to Kimberley  to drive the Boers away.</p>
<p>We reached the drift at fall of night, and  camped across the ford.<br>
  Next day from all the hills around the Dutchman&rsquo;s cannon roared.<br>
  A narrow pass ran through the hills, with guns on either side;<br>
  The boldest man might well turn pale before that pass he tried,<br>
  For, if the first attack should fail, then every hope was gone:<br>
  But French looked once, and only once, and then he said, &ldquo;Push on!&rdquo;<br>
  The gunners plied their guns amain; the hail of shrapnel flew;<br>
  With rifle fire and lancer charge their squadrons back we threw;<br>
  And through the pass between the hills we swept in furious fray,<br>
  And French was through to Kimberley  to drive the Boers away.</p>
<p>Ay, French was through to Kimberley! And ere the day was done<br>
  We saw the Diamond City stand, lit by the evening sun:<br>
  Above the town the heliograph hung like an eye of flame:<br>
  Around the town the foemen camped&mdash;they knew not that we came;<br>
  But soon they saw us, rank on rank; they heard our squadrons&rsquo; tread;<br>
  In panic fear they left their tents, in hopeless rout they fled&mdash;<br>
  And French rode into Kimberley; the people cheered amain,<br>
  The women came with tear-stained eyes to touch his bridle rein,<br>
  The starving children lined the streets to raise a feeble cheer,<br>
  The bells rang out a joyous peal to say &ldquo;Relief is here!&rdquo;<br>
  Ay! we that saw that stirring march are proud that we can say<br>
  We went with French to Kimberley  to drive the Boers away.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="JohnnyBoer"></a>Johnny Boer</h2>
<p>Men&nbsp;fight all shapes  and sizes as the racing horses run,<br>
  And no man knows his courage till he stands  before a gun.<br>
  At mixed-up fighting, hand to hand, and  clawing men about<br>
  They reckon Fuzzy-wuzzy is the hottest fighter  out.<br>
  But Fuzzy gives himself away&mdash;his style is out  of date,<br>
  He charges like a driven grouse that rushes on  its fate;<br>
  You&rsquo;ve nothing in the world to do but pump him  full of lead:<br>
  But when you&rsquo;re fighting Johnny Boer you have  to use your head;<br>
  He don&rsquo;t believe in front attacks or charging  at the run,<br>
  He fights you from a kopje with his little  Maxim gun. </p>
<p>For when the Lord He made the earth, it  seems uncommon clear,<br>
  He gave the job of Africa to some good  engineer,<br>
  Who started building fortresses on fashions of his own&mdash;<br>
  Lunettes, redoubts, and counterscarps all made of rock and stone.<br>
  The Boer needs only bring a gun, for ready to his hand<br>
  He finds these heaven-built fortresses all scattered through the land;<br>
  And there he sits and winks his eye and wheels his gun about,<br>
  And we must charge across the plain to hunt the beggar out.<br>
  It ain&rsquo;t a game that grows on us,&mdash;there&rsquo;s lots of better fun<br>
  Than charging at old Johnny with his little Maxim gun.</p>
<p>On rocks a goat could scarcely climb,  steep as the walls of Troy,<br>
  He wheels a four-point-seven about as easy as a toy;<br>
  With bullocks yoked and drag-ropes manned, he lifts her up the rocks<br>
  And shifts her every now and then, as cunning as a fox.<br>
  At night you mark her right ahead, you see her clean and clear,<br>
  Next day at dawn&mdash;&ldquo;What, ho! she bumps&rdquo;&mdash;from somewhere in the rear.<br>
  Or else the keenest-eyed patrol will miss him with the glass&mdash;<br>
  He&rsquo;s lying hidden in the rocks to let the leaders pass;<br>
  But when the main guard comes along he opens up the fun,<br>
  There&rsquo;s lots of ammunition for the little Maxim gun.</p>
<p>But after all the job is sure, although  the job is slow,<br>
  We have to see the business through, the Boer has got to go.<br>
  With Nordenfeldt and lyddite shell it&rsquo;s certain, soon or late,<br>
  We&rsquo;ll hunt him from his kopjes and across the Orange State;<br>
  And then across those open flats you&rsquo;ll see the beggar run,<br>
  And we&rsquo;ll be running after with&nbsp;<i>our</i>&nbsp;little Maxim gun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="WhatHavetheCavalryDone"></a>What Have the Cavalry Done</h2>
<p>What&nbsp;have the cavalry  done?<br>
  Cantered and trotted about,<br>
  Routin&rsquo; the enemy out,<br>
  Causin&rsquo; the beggars to run!<br>
  And we tramped along in the blazin&rsquo; heat,<br>
  Over the veldt on our weary feet.<br>
  Tramp, tramp, tramp<br>
  Under the blazin&rsquo; sun,<br>
  With never the sight of a bloomin&rsquo; Boer,<br>
  &rsquo;Cause they&rsquo;d hunted &rsquo;em long before&mdash;<br>
  That&rsquo;s what the cavalry done! </p>
<p>What have the gunners done<br>
  Battlin&rsquo; every day,<br>
  Battlin&rsquo; any way.<br>
  Boers outranged &rsquo;em, but what cared they?<br>
  &ldquo;Shoot and be damned,&rdquo; said the R.H.A.!<br>
  See! when the fight grows hot,<br>
  Under the rifles or not,<br>
  Always the order runs,<br>
  &ldquo;Fetch up the bloomin&rsquo; guns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d see them great gun-horses spring<br>
  To the &ldquo;action front&rdquo;&mdash;and around they&rsquo;d swing.<br>
  Find the range with some queer machine<br>
  &ldquo;At four thousand with fuse fourteen.<br>
  Ready! Fire number one!&rdquo;<br>
  Handled the battery neat and quick!<br>
  Stick to it, too! How&nbsp;<i>did</i>&nbsp;they stick!<br>
  Never a gunner was seen to run!<br>
  Never a gunner would leave his gun!<br>
  Not though his mates dropped all around!<br>
  Always a gunner would stand his ground.<br>
  Take the army&mdash;the infantry,<br>
  Mounted rifles, and cavalry,<br>
  Twice the numbers I&rsquo;d give away,<br>
  And I&rsquo;d fight the lot with the R.H.A.,<br>
  For they showed us how a corps&nbsp;<i>should</i>&nbsp;be run,<br>
  That&rsquo;s what the gunners done!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="RightintheFrontoftheArmy"></a>Right in the Front of the Army</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where&nbsp;&rsquo;ave you been this week or more,<br>
  &rsquo;Aven&rsquo;t seen you about the war?<br>
  Thought perhaps you was at the rear<br>
  Guarding the waggons.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What, us? No fear!<br>
  Where have we been? Why, bless my heart,<br>
  Where have we been since the bloomin&rsquo; start?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right in the front of the army,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battling  day and night!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right in the front of the army,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching  &rsquo;em how to fight!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every separate man you see,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapper, gunner, and C.I.V.,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every one of &rsquo;em seems to be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right in the front of the army!</p>
<p>Most of the troops to the camp had gone,<br>
  When we met with a cow-gun toiling on;<br>
  And we said to the boys, as they walked her past,<br>
  &ldquo;Well, thank goodness, you&rsquo;re here at last!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Here at last! Why, what d&rsquo;yer mean?<br>
  Ain&rsquo;t we just where we&rsquo;ve always been?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right in the front of the army,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battling  day and night!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right in the front of the army,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching  &rsquo;em how to fight!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correspondents and Vets in  force,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mounted foot and dismounted  horse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them were, as a matter  of course,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right in the front of the army.</p>
<p>Old Lord Roberts will have to mind<br>
  If ever the enemy get behind;<br>
  For they&rsquo;ll smash him up with a rear attack,<br>
  Because his army has got no back!<br>
  Think of the horrors that might befall<br>
  An army without any rear at all!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right in the front of the army,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battling  day and night!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right in the front of the army,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching  &rsquo;em how to fight!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swede attaches and German  counts,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeomen (known as De Wet&rsquo;s  remounts),<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them were by their own  accounts<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right in the front of the army!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ThatVC"></a>That V.C.</h2>
<p>&rsquo;Twas&nbsp;in the days of front attack,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This glorious truth we&rsquo;d yet to learn it&mdash;<br>
  That every &ldquo;front&rdquo; had got a back,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And French was just the man to turn it.</p>
<p>A wounded soldier on the ground<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was lying hid behind a hummock;<br>
  He proved the good old proverb sound&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An army travels on its stomach.</p>
<p>He lay as flat as any fish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His nose had worn a little furrow;<br>
  He only had one frantic wish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That like an ant-bear he could burrow.</p>
<p>The bullets whistled into space,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pom-pom gun kept up its braying,<br>
  The four-point-seven supplied the bass&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;d think the devil&rsquo;s band was playing.</p>
<p>A valiant comrade crawling near<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observed his most supine behaviour,<br>
  And crept towards him, &ldquo;Hey! what cheer?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck up,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to save yer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get up on my shoulders, mate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if we live beyond the firing,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll get the V.C. sure as fate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because our blokes is all retiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fifty pounds a year,&rdquo; says he,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand you lots of beer and whisky.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; says the wounded man, &ldquo;not me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll not be saved&mdash;it&rsquo;s far too risky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fairly safe behind this mound,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve worn a hole that seems to fit me;<br>
  But if you lift me off the ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s fifty pounds to one they&rsquo;ll hit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So back towards the firing line<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our friend crept slowly to the rear oh!<br>
  Remarking &ldquo;What a selfish swine!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might have let me be a hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="FedUp"></a>Fed Up</h2>
<p>I&nbsp;ain&rsquo;t&nbsp;a timid man at  all, I&rsquo;m just as brave as most,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll take my chance in open fight and die  beside my post;<br>
  But riding round the &rsquo;ole day long as target  for a Krupp,<br>
  A-drawing fire from Koppies&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m fair fed  up. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful how few get hit, it&rsquo;s luck  that pulls us through;<br>
  Their rifle fire&rsquo;s no class at all, it misses me and you;<br>
  But when they sprinkle shells around like water from a cup<br>
  From that there blooming pom-pom gun&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m fed up.</p>
<p>We never get a chance to charge, to do a  thrust and cut,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll have to chuck the Cavalry and join the Mounted Fut.<br>
  But after all&mdash;What&rsquo;s Mounted Fut? I saw them t&rsquo;other day,<br>
  They occupied a Koppie when the Boers had run away.<br>
  The Cavalry went riding on and seen a score of fights,<br>
  But there they kept them Mounted Fut three solid days and nights&mdash;<br>
  Three solid starving days and nights with scarce a bite or sup,<br>
  Well! after that on Mounted Fut I&rsquo;m fair fed up.</p>
<p>And tramping with the Footies ain&rsquo;t as  easy as it looks,<br>
  They scarcely ever see a Boer except in picture books.<br>
  They do a march of twenty mile that leaves &rsquo;em nearly dead,<br>
  And then they find the bloomin&rsquo; Boers is twenty miles ahead.<br>
  Each Footy is as full of fight as any bulldog pup,<br>
  But walking forty miles to fight&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m fed up!</p>
<p>So after all I think that when I leave the  Cavalry<br>
  I&rsquo;ll either join the ambulance or else the A.S.C.;<br>
  They&rsquo;ve always tucker in the plate and coffee in the cup,<br>
  But Bully Beef and Biscuits&mdash;well! I&rsquo;m fair fed up!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Jock"></a>Jock!</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s&nbsp;a soldier that&rsquo;s been doing of his share<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fighting up and down and round about.<br>
  He&rsquo;s continually marching here and there<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he&rsquo;s fighting, morning in and morning out.</p>
<p>The Boer, you see, he generally runs;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes when he hides behind a rock,<br>
  And we can&rsquo;t make no impression with the guns,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, then you&rsquo;ll hear the order, &ldquo;Send for Jock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s Jock&mdash;Scotch Jock.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s the fellow that can give or take a knock.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he&rsquo;s hairy and he&rsquo;s hard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his feet are by the yard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his face is like the face what&rsquo;s on a clock.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the bullets fly you will mostly hear the cry&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Send for Jock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cavalry have gun and sword and lance,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they choose their weapon, why, they&rsquo;re dead.<br>
  The Mounted Fut are hampered in advance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By holding of their helmets on their head.<br>
  And when the Boer has dug himself a trench<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And placed his Maxim gun behind a rock,<br>
  These mounted heroes&mdash;pets of Johnny French&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have to sit and wait and send for Jock!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the Jocks&mdash;Scotch Jocks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their music that&rsquo;d terrify an ox!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bullets kick the sand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can hear the sharp command&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Forty-Second! At the double! Charge the rocks!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the charge is like a flood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they&rsquo;ve warmed the Highland  blood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Jocks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="SantaClaus"></a>Santa Claus</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&nbsp;Who goes there?&rdquo; The sentry&rsquo;s call<br>
  Rose on the midnight air<br>
  Above the noises of the camp,<br>
  The roll of wheels, the horses&rsquo; tramp.<br>
  The challenge echoed over all&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Halt! Who goes there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quaint old figure clothed in white,<br>
  He bore a staff of pine,<br>
  An ivy-wreath was on his head.<br>
  &ldquo;Advance, oh friend,&rdquo; the sentry said,<br>
  &ldquo;Advance, for this is Christmas night,<br>
  And give the countersign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sign nor countersign have I,<br>
  Through many lands I roam<br>
  The whole world over far and wide,<br>
  To exiles all at Christmastide,<br>
  From those who love them tenderly<br>
  I bring a thought of home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From English brook and Scottish burn,<br>
  From cold Canadian snows,<br>
  From those far lands ye hold most dear<br>
  I bring you all a greeting here,<br>
  A frond of a New Zealand fern,<br>
  A bloom of English rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From faithful wife and loving lass<br>
  I bring a wish divine,<br>
  For Christmas blessings on your head.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;I wish you well,&rdquo; the sentry said,<br>
  &ldquo;But here, alas! you may not pass<br>
  Without the countersign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He vanished&mdash;and the sentry&rsquo;s tramp<br>
  Re-echoed down the line.<br>
  It was not till the morning light<br>
  The soldiers knew that in the night<br>
  Old Santa Claus had come to camp<br>
Without the countersign.</p>
