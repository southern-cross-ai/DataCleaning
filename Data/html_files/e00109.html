  In the Club</b></h2>
<p>It was a summer&rsquo;s evening in Sydney, and the north-east wind that  comes down from New Guinea and the tropical islands over leagues of warm sea,  brought on its wings a heavy depressing moisture. In the streets people walked  listlessly, perspired, mopped themselves, and abused their much-vaunted  climate. Everyone who could manage it was out of town, either on the heights of  Moss Vale or the Blue Mountains, escaping from  the Inferno of Sydney.</p>
<p>In the Cassowary Club, weary, pallid waiters brought iced drinks  to such of the members as were condemned to spend the summer in town. The gong  had sounded, and in ones and twos members shuffled out of the smoking-room, and  went in to dinner. At last only three were left talking at the far end of the  big, empty smoking-room, like three small stage conspirators at the end of a  very large robbers&rsquo; cavern.</p>
<p>One was a short, fat, red-faced man, who looked like a combination  of sea-captain and merchant, and who was the local representative of a big  English steamship company. His connection with the mercantile marine had earned  him his nickname of &ldquo;The Bo&rsquo;sun&rdquo;. By his side sat Pinnock, a lean and  bilious-looking solicitor; the third man was an English globe-trotter, a  colourless sort of person, of whom no one took any particular notice until they  learnt that he was the eldest son of a big Scotch whisky manufacturer, and had  &pound;10,000 a year of his own. Then they suddenly discovered that he was a much smarter  fellow than he looked. The three were evidently waiting for somebody. The  Bo&rsquo;sun had a grievance, and was relieving his mind by speech. He walked up and  down between the smokingroom chairs, brandishing a telegram as he talked, while  the attorney and the globe-trotter lay back on the lounge and admired his  energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call it a shame,&rdquo; he said, facing round on them suddenly; &ldquo;I  could have got up to Moss Vale for a day or two, and now old Grant of Kuryong  wires me to meet and entertain a new chum. Just listen to this: &lsquo;Young Carew,  friend of mine, on&nbsp;<i>Carthaginia</i>. Will you meet him and show him  round; oblige me&mdash;W. G. Grant.&rsquo; I met the old fellow once or twice at dinner,  when he was in town for the sheep sales, and on the strength of that he foists  an unknown callow new chum on to me. People are always doing that kind of  thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave his friend alone, then,&rdquo; said Pinnock; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t have anything  to do with him. I know his sort&mdash;Government House young man the first week,  Coffee Palace at two shillings a night the second week, boiler on the wharf the  third week, Central Police Court the fourth week, and then exit so far as all  decent people are concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bo&rsquo;sun stuffed the telegram into his pocket and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;ll be so bad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked him  here tonight to see what he&rsquo;s like, and if he&rsquo;s no good I&rsquo;ll drop him. It&rsquo;s the  principle I object to. Country people are always at this sort of thing. They&rsquo;d  ask me to meet an Alderney bull and entertain  him till they send for him. What am I to do with an unknown new chum? I&rsquo;d  sooner have an Alderney bull&mdash;he&rsquo;d be easier to  arrange for. He&rsquo;d stop where he was put, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Gillespie, the globe-trotter, cut into the conversation. &ldquo;I  knew a Jim Carew in England,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;and if this is the same man you will have no trouble taking care of  him. He was a great man at his &rsquo;Varsity&mdash;triple blue, or something of the sort.  He can row and run and fight and play football, and all that kind of thing.  Very quiet-spoken sort of chap&mdash;rather pretends to be a simple sort of Johnny,  don&rsquo;t you know, but he&rsquo;s a regular demon, I believe. Got into a row at a  music-hall one night, and threw the chucker-out in among a lot of valuable pot  plants, and irretrievably ruined him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice sort of man&rdquo;, said the Bo&rsquo;sun. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of his  sort, worse luck; he&rsquo;ll be borrowing fivers after the first week. I&rsquo;ll put him  on to you fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The globe-trotter smiled a sickly smile, and changed the subject.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s old Grant like&mdash; the man he&rsquo;s going to? Squatter man, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and one of the real old sort, too,&rdquo; interposed Pinnock,  &ldquo;perfect gentleman, you know, but apt to make himself deuced unpleasant if  everything doesn&rsquo;t go exactly to suit him; sort of chap who thinks that  everyone who doesn&rsquo;t agree with him ought to be put to death at once. He had a  row with his shearers one year, and offered Jack Delaney a new Purdey gun if  he&rsquo;d fire the first two charges into the shearers&rsquo; camp at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Gillespie. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his sort, eh? Well, if this Carew is  the Carew I mean, he and the old fellow will be well met. They&rsquo;ll about do for  each other in the first week or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No great loss, either,&rdquo; said the Bo&rsquo;sun. &ldquo;Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve asked this  new chum to dinner to-night, and Charlie Gordon&rsquo;s coming too. He was in my  office to-day, but hadn&rsquo;t heard of the new chum. Gordon&rsquo;s a member now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo; said Gillespie. &ldquo;Anything like the gentleman  that wanted the shearers killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; a good fellow,&rdquo; said the Bo&rsquo;sun, taking a sip of sherry.  &ldquo;He manages stations for Grant, and the old man has kept him out on the  back-stations nearly all his life. He was out in the Gulf country in the early  days&mdash;got starved out in droughts, swept away in floods, lost in the bush,  speared by blacks, and all that sort of thing, in the days when men camped  under bushes and didn&rsquo;t wear shirts. Gone a bit queer in the head, I think, but  a good chap for all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did this Grant make all his money?&rdquo; asked Gillespie. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s  awfully well off, isn&rsquo;t he? Stations everywhere? Is he any relation to Gordon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; old Gordon&mdash;Charlie&rsquo;s father&mdash;used to have the money. He had a  lot of stations in the old days, and employed Grant as a manager. Grant was a  new chum Scotchman with no money, but a demon for hard work, and the most  headstrong, bad-tempered man that ever lived&mdash;hard to hold at any time. After  he&rsquo;d worked for Gordon for awhile he went to the diggings and made a huge pile;  and when old Gordon got a bit short of cash he took Grant into partnership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been funny for a man to have his old manager as a  partner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t at all funny for Gordon,&rdquo; said the lawyer, grimly.  &ldquo;Anything but funny. They each had stations of their own outside the  partnership, and all Gordon&rsquo;s stations went wrong, and Grant&rsquo;s went right. It  never seemed to rain on Gordon&rsquo;s stations, while Grant&rsquo;s had floods. So Gordon  got short of money again and borrowed from Grant, and when he was really in a  fix Grant closed on him and sold him out for good and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an old screw! What did he do that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just pure obstinacy&mdash;Gordon had contradicted him or something, so  he sold him up just to show which was right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did Gordon do after he was sold up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Died, and didn&rsquo;t leave a penny. So then Bully Grant wheeled round  and gave Gordon&rsquo;s widow a station to live on, and fixed the two sons up  managing his stations. Goodness knows how much he&rsquo;s worth now. Doesn&rsquo;t even  know it himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has he no children? Was he ever married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer lit a cigarette and puffed at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went to England  and got married; there&rsquo;s a daughter. The wife&rsquo;s dead; the daughter is in England  still&mdash;never been out here. There&rsquo;s a story that before he made his money he  married a bush girl up on the station, but no one believes that. The daughter  in England  will get everything when he dies. A chance for you Gillespie. Go home and marry  her&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be worth nearly a million of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it,&rdquo; said the globe-trotter.</p>
<p>As he spoke a buttony boy came up to the Bo&rsquo;sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentleman to see you, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mr Carew, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bo&rsquo;sun hurried off to bring in his guest, while Pinnock called  after him&mdash;&ldquo;Mind your eye, Bo&rsquo;sun. Be civil to him. See that he doesn&rsquo;t kill a  waiter or two on the way up. Not but what he&rsquo;d be welcome to do it, for all the  good they are here&rdquo;, he added, gloomily, taking another sip of his sherry and  bitters; and before he had finished it the Bo&rsquo;sun and his guest entered the  room.</p>
<p>They had expected to see a Hercules, a fiery-faced, fierce-eyed  man. This was merely a broad-shouldered, well-built, well-groomed youth, about  twenty-three years of age; his face was square and rather stolid, clean-shaven,  brown-complexioned, with honest eyes and a firm-set mouth. As he stood at the  door he adopted the wooden expression that a University man always wears in the  presence of strangers. He said nothing on being introduced to Pinnock; and when  the globe-trotter came up and claimed acquaintance, defining himself as  &ldquo;Gillespie of Balliol&rdquo;, the stranger said he didn&rsquo;t remember him, and regarded  him with an aspect of armed neutrality. After a sherry and bitters he thawed a  little, and the Bo&rsquo;sun started to cross-examine him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Grant of Kuryong wired to me about you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose  you came in the&nbsp;<i>Carthaginia</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the stranger, speaking in the regulation English University voice, a little deeper than  usual. &ldquo;I left her at Adelaide.  I&rsquo;m out for some bush experience, don&rsquo;t you know. I&rsquo;ll get you to tell me some  place to stop at till I leave, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner was distinctly apologetic, and he seemed anxious to  give as little trouble as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you stop here,&rdquo; said the Bo&rsquo;sun. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you made an  honorary member. They&rsquo;ll do you all right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awfully good of you. Thanks very much indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! not at all. You&rsquo;ll find the club not so bad, and a lot better  than where you&rsquo;re going with old Grant. He&rsquo;s a regular demon to make fellows  work. It&rsquo;s pretty rough on the stations sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! yes; awf&rsquo;lly rough, I believe. Quite frightened me, what I  heard of it, don&rsquo;t you know. Still, I suppose one must expect to rough it a  bit. Eh, what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie Gordon will be here in a minute,&rdquo; said the Bo&rsquo;sun. &ldquo;He  can tell you all about it. Here he is now,&rdquo; he added, as the door swung open  and the long-waited-for guest entered the room.</p>
<p>The newcomer was unmistakably a man from Far Out; tall,  wiry-framed, and very dark, and so spare and lean of figure that he did not  seem to have an ounce of superfluous flesh anywhere. His face was as hard and  impassive as a Red Indian&rsquo;s, and looked almost black by contrast with his white  shirt-front. So did his hands. He had thin straight hair, high cheek-bones, and  a drooping black moustache. But the eyes were the most remarkable feature. Very  keen and piercing they were, deep-set in the head; even when he was looking  straight at anyone he seemed to be peering into endless space through the man  in front of him. Such eyes men get from many years of staring over vast  stretches of sunlit plain where no colour relieves the blinding glare&mdash;nothing  but dull grey clumps of saltbush and the dull green Mitchell grass.</p>
<p>His whole bearing spoke of infinite determination and  self-reliance&mdash;the square chin, the steadfast eyes, telling their tale as  plainly as print. In India he might have passed for an officer of native  cavalry in mufti; but when he spoke he used the curious nasal drawl of the Far  Out bushman, the&nbsp;<i>slow</i>&nbsp;deliberate speech that comes to men who  are used to passing months with the same companions in the unhurried Australian  bush. Occasionally he lapsed into reveries, out of which he would come with a  start and break in on other people&rsquo;s conversation, talking them down with a  serene indifference to their feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out to old man Grant, have you?&rdquo; he drawled to Carew, when  the ceremonies of introduction were over. &ldquo;Well, I can do something better for  you than that. I want a mate for my next trip, and a rough lonely hot trip  it&rsquo;ll be. But don&rsquo;t you make any mistake. The roughest and hottest I can show  you will be child&rsquo;s play to having anything to do with Grant. You come with  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better see Mr Grant first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t care. The old man doesn&rsquo;t take much notice of new  chums&mdash;he gets them out by the bushel. He might meet a man at dinner in England  and the man might say, &lsquo;Grant, you&rsquo;ve got some stations. I&rsquo;ve got a young  fellow that&rsquo;s no use at home&mdash;or anywhere else for that matter&mdash;can&rsquo;t you oblige  me, and take him and keep him out of mischief for a while?&rsquo; And if the old man  had had about a bottle of champagne, he&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll take him&mdash;for a  premium,&rsquo; or if he&rsquo;d had two bottles, he&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Send along your new chum&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  make a man of him or break his neck.&rsquo; And perhaps in the next steamer out the  fellow comes, and Grant just passes him on to me. Never looks at him, as likely  as not. Don&rsquo;t you bother your head about Grant&mdash;you come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he drawled out his last sentence, a move was made to dinner; so  the Englishman was spared the pain of making any comments on his own  unimportance in Mr Grant&rsquo;s eyes, and they trooped into the dining-room in  silence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  A Dinner for Five</b></h2>
<p>A club dining-room in Australia is  much like one in any other part of the world. Even at the Antipodes&mdash;though the  seasons are reversed, and the foxes have wings&mdash;we still shun the club bore, and  let him have a table to himself; the head waiter usually looks a more important  personage than any of the members or guests; and men may be seen giving each  other dinners from much the same ignoble motives as those which actuate their  fellows elsewhere. In the Cassowary Club, on the night of which we tell, the  Bo&rsquo;sun was giving his dinner of necessity to honour the draft of hospitality  drawn on him by Grant. At the next table a young solicitor was entertaining his  one wealthy client; nearby a band of haggard University professors were dining a  wandering scientist, all hair and spectacles&mdash;both guest and hosts drinking  mineral waters and such horrors; while beyond them a lot of racing men were  swilling champagne and eating and talking as heartily as so many navvies. A few  squatters, down from their stations had foregathered at the centre table, where  each was trying to make out that he had had less rain than the others. The  Bo&rsquo;sun and his guests were taken in hand by the head waiter, who formerly had  been at a London Club, and was laying himself out to do his best; he had seen  that Gillespie had &ldquo;Wanderers&rsquo; Club&rdquo; on his cards, and he knew, and thanked his  stars that he did know, what &ldquo;Wanderers&rsquo; Club&rdquo; on a man&rsquo;s card meant. His  fellow-waiters, to whom he usually referred as &ldquo;a lot of savages&rdquo;, were  unfortunately in ignorance of the social distinction implied by membership of  such a club. </p>
<p>For a time there was nothing but the usual commonplace talk while  the soup and fish were disposed of; when they reached the champagne and the  entr&eacute;es, things became more home-like and conversation flowed. A bushman,  especially when primed with champagne, is always ready to give his tongue a  run&mdash;and when he has two open-mouthed new chums for audience, as Gordon had, the  only difficulty is to stop him before bed-time; for long silent rides on the  plain, and lonely camps at night, give him a lot of enforced silence that he  has to make up for later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you from last, Gordon?&rdquo; said the Bo&rsquo;sun. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen  you in town for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hunting wild geese,&rdquo; drawled the man from far back,  screwing up one eye and inspecting a glass of champagne, which he drank off at  a gulp. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I do most of my time now. The old man&mdash;Grant, you know&mdash;my  boss&mdash;he&rsquo;s always hearing of mobs of cattle for sale, and if I&rsquo;m down in the  south-west the mob is sure to be up in the far north-east, but it&rsquo;s all one to  him. He wires to me to go and inspect them quick and lively before someone else  gets them, and I ride and drive and coach hundreds of miles to get at some  flat-sided pike-horned mob of brutes without enough fat on them to oil a man&rsquo;s  hair with. I&rsquo;ve to go right away out back now and take over a place that the  old man advanced some money on. He was fool enough, or someone was fool enough  for him, to advance five thousand pounds on a block of new country with five  thousand cattle on it&mdash;book-muster, you know, and half the cattle haven&rsquo;t been  seen for years, and the other half are dead, I expect. Anyhow, the man that  borrowed the money is ruined, and I have to go up and take over the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call a book-muster?&rdquo; said the globe-trotter, who was  spending a month in the country, and would naturally write a book on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Book-muster, book-muster? Why, a book-muster is something like  dead-reckoning on a ship. You know what dead-reckoning is, don&rsquo;t you? If a  captain can&rsquo;t see the sun he allows for how fast the ship is going, and for the  time run and the currents, and all that, and then reckons up where he is. I  travelled with a captain once, and so long as he stuck to dead-reckoning he was  all right. He made out we were off Cairns, and that&rsquo;s just where we were;  because we struck the Great Barrier Reef, and became a total wreck ten minutes  after. With the cattle it&rsquo;s just the same. You&rsquo;ll reckon the cattle that you started  with, add on each year&rsquo;s calves, subtract all that you sell,&mdash;that is, if you  ever do sell any&mdash;and allow for deaths, and what the blacks spear and the  thieves steal. Then you work out the total, and you say, &lsquo;There ought to be  five thousand cattle on the place,&rsquo; but you never get &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ve got to go and  find five thousand cattle in the worst bit of brigalow scrub in the north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you say this place is?&rdquo; said Pinnock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called No Man&rsquo;s Land, and it&rsquo;s away out back near where the  buffalo shooters are. It&rsquo;ll take about a month to get there. The old man&rsquo;s in a  rare state of mind at being let in. He&rsquo;s up at Kuryong now, driving my brother  Hugh out of his mind. Hugh would as soon have an attack of faceache as see old  Bully looming up the track. Every time he goes up he shifts every blessed sheep  out of every paddock, and knocks seven years&rsquo; growth out of them putting them  through the yards; then he overhauls the store, and if there&rsquo;s a box of matches  short he&rsquo;ll keep Hugh up half the night to account for it. He sacks all the  good men and raises the wages of the loafers, and then comes back to Sydney quite pleased;  it&rsquo;s a little holiday to him. You come along with me, Carew, and let old Bully  alone. What did you come out for? Colonial experience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An Englishman hates talking about himself, and Carew rather  hesitated. Then he came out with it awkwardly, like a man repeating a lesson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever meet a man named Considine out here?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of them,&rdquo; said Gordon promptly, &ldquo;lots of them. Why, I had a  man named Considine working for me, and he thought he got bitten by a snake, so  his mates ran him twenty miles into Bourke between two horses to keep him from  going to sleep, giving him a nip of whisky every twenty minutes; and when he  got to Bourke he wasn&rsquo;t bitten at all, but he died of alcoholic poisoning. What  about this Considine, anyhow? What do you want him for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Englishman felt like dropping the subject altogether, not  feeling quite sure that he was not being laughed at. However, he decided to go  through with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a long story, but it boils down to this,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a Patrick Henry Considine, but I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s like. I  don&rsquo;t know whether there is such a chap, in fact, but if there is, I&rsquo;ve got to  find him. A great-uncle of mine died out here a long while ago, and we believe  he left a son; and if there is such a son, it turns out that he would be  entitled to a heap of money. It has been heaping up for years in Chancery, and  all that sort of thing, you know,&rdquo; he added, vaguely. &ldquo;My people thought I  might meet him out here, don&rsquo;t you know, and he could go home and get all the  cash, you see. They&rsquo;ve been advertising for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what good will it do you,&rdquo; drawled Gordon, &ldquo;supposing you do  find him? Where do you come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t do me much good, except that if there is such a  Johnny, and he dies without making a will, then the money would all come to my  people. But if there isn&rsquo;t, it all goes to another branch of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gordon thought the matter over for a while. &ldquo;What you want,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;is to find this man, and to find him dead. If we come across him away in  the back country, we&rsquo;ll soon arrange his death for you, if you make it worth  while. Nasty gun accident, or something like that, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like anyone to shoot him,&rdquo; said the Englishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you come with me, and we&rsquo;ll find him,&rdquo; said Gordon.</p>
<p>By this time dinner was over. The waiters began to turn out the  lights on the vacant tables; and, as the party rose it was arranged&nbsp;<i>nem.  con.</i>, and with much enthusiasm, that Carew should accompany Gordon on this  trip to No Man&rsquo;s Land, and that Gordon should, by all means in his power, aid  and abet Carew in his search for Considine.</p>
<p>Then, all talking together, and somewhat loudly, they strutted  into the smoking-room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  In Push Society</b></h2>
<p>The passing of the evening  afterwards is the only true test of a dinner&rsquo;s success. Many a good dinner,  enlivened with wine and made brilliant with repartee, has died out in gloom.  The guests have all said their best things during the meal, and nothing is left  but to smoke moodily and look at the clock. Our heroes were not of that mettle.  They meant to have some sort of fun, and the various amusements of Sydney were canvassed. It  was unanimously voted too hot for the theatres, ditto for billiards. There were  no supporters for a proposal to stop in the smoking-room and drink, and  gambling in the cardrooms had no attractions on such a night. At last Cordon  hit off a scent. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;if we go and have a look at a  dancing saloon&mdash;one of these larrikin dancing saloons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it awfully,&rdquo; said one Englishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most interesting,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard such a lot about  the Australian larrikin. What they call a basher in England, isn&rsquo;t it? Eh, what? Sort  of rough that lays for you with a pal and robs you, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bo&rsquo;sun rang for cigars and liqueurs, and then answered the  question. &ldquo;Pretty much the same as a basher,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but with a lot more  science and dog-cunning about him. They go in gangs, and if you hit one of the  gang, all the rest will &lsquo;deal with you&rsquo;, as they call it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they have to wait a year to get you, they&rsquo;ll wait, and get you  alone some night or other and set on to you. They jump on a man if they get him  down, too. Oh, they&rsquo;re regular beauties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather roughish sort of Johnnies, eh?&rdquo; said the Englishman. &ldquo;But  we might go and see the dancing&mdash;no harm in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pinnock said he had to go back to his office; the globe-trotter  didn&rsquo;t care about going out at night: and the Bo&rsquo;sun tried to laugh the thing  off. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t catch me going,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be seen&mdash;just a  lot of flash young rowdies dancing. You&rsquo;ll gape at them, and they&rsquo;ll gape at  you, and you&rsquo;ll feel rather a pair of fools, and you&rsquo;ll come away. Better stop  and have a rubber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you dance with any of their women, you get her particular  fancy-man on to you, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Gordon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s years since I was at that  sort of place myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bo&rsquo;sun, who knew nothing about it, assumed the Sir Oracle at  once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose their women would dance with you if you paid &rsquo;em  five shillings a step,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;d certainly be a fight if they did. Are you fond of  fighting, Carew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; replied that worthy. &ldquo;Never fight if you can help it.  No chap with any sense ever does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s like me,&rdquo; said Gordon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner run a mile than fight,  any time. I&rsquo;m like a rat if I&rsquo;m cornered, but it takes a man with a stockwhip  to corner me. I never start fighting till I&rsquo;m done running. But we needn&rsquo;t get  into a row. I vote we go. Will you come, Carew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; said the Englishman. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose we  need get into a fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, after many jeers from the Bo&rsquo;sun, and promises to come back  and and tell them all about it, Carew and Gordon sallied forth, a pair of men  as capable of looking after themselves as one would meet in a day&rsquo;s march.  Stepping into the street they called a cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to, sir?&rdquo; asked the cabman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearest dancing saloon,&rdquo; said Gordon, briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearest darncin&rsquo; saloon,&rdquo; said the cabman. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no  parties tonight, sir; it&rsquo;s too &rsquo;ot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not expecting to drop into a ballroom without being asked,  thank you,&rdquo; said Gordon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to go to one of those saloons where you pay a shilling to  go in. Some place where the larrikins go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! is that it, sir?&rdquo; said the cabman, with a grin. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll  take you to a noo place, most selectest place I know. Git up, &rsquo;orse.&rdquo; And off  they rattled through the quiet streets, turning corners and crossing tramlines  every fifty yards, apparently, and bumping against each other in the most  fraternal manner.</p>
<p>Soon the cab pulled up in a narrow, ill-lit street, at the open  door of a dingy house. Instructing the cabman to wait, they hustled upstairs,  to be confronted at the top by a man who took a shilling from each, and then  was not sure whether he would admit them. He didn&rsquo;t seem to like their form  exactly, and muttered something to a by-stander as they went in. They saw a  long, low room, brilliantly lighted by flaring gas jets. Down one side, on  wooden forms, was seated a row of flashily dressed girls&mdash;larrikinesses on their  native heath, barmaids from cheap, disreputable hotels, shop girls, factory  girls&mdash;all sharp-faced and pert, young in years, but old in knowledge of evil.  The demon of mischief peeped out of their quick-moving restless eyes. They had  elaborate fringes, and their short dresses exhibited well-turned ankles and  legs.</p>
<p>A large notice on the wall stated that &ldquo;Gentlemen must not dance  with nails in their boots. Gentlemen must not dance together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That blocks us,&rdquo; said Gordon, pointing to the notice. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  dance together, no matter how much we want to. Look at these fellows here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opposite the women sat or lounged a score or two of youths&mdash;wiry,  hard-faced little fellows, for the most part, with scarcely a sizeable man  amongst them. They were all clothed in &ldquo;push&rdquo; evening dress&mdash;black bell-bottomed  pants, no waistcoat, very short black paget coat, white shirt with no collar,  and a gaudy neckerchief round the bare throat. Their boots were marvels, very  high in the heel and picked out with all sorts of colours down the sides. They  looked &ldquo;varminty&rdquo; enough for anything; but the shifty eyes, low foreheads, and  evil faces gave our two heroes a sense of disgust. The Englishman thought that  all the stories he had heard of the Australian larrikin must be exaggerated,  and that any man who was at all athletic could easily hold his own among such a  poor-looking lot. The whole spectacle was disappointing. The most elaborately  decorous order prevailed; no excitement or rough play was noticeable, and their  expedition seemed likely to be a failure.</p>
<p>The bushman stared down the room with far-seeing eyes, apparently  looking at nothing, and contemplated the whole show with bored indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing very dazzling about this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t  show you anything very exciting here. Better go back to the club, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the band (piano and violin) struck up a slow, laboured  waltz, &ldquo;Bid me goodbye and go,&rdquo; and each black-coated male, with languid  self-possession, strolled across the room, seized a lady by the arm, jerked her  to her feet without saying a syllable, and commenced to dance in slow,  convulsive movements, making a great many revolutions for very little progress.  Two or three girls were left sitting, as their partners were talking in a  little knot at the far end of the room; one among them was conspicuously  pretty, and she began to ogle Carew in a very pronounced way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one hasn&rsquo;t got a partner,&rdquo; said Gordon. &ldquo;Good-looking  Tottie, too. Go and ask her to dance. See what she says.&rdquo; The Englishman  hesitated for a second. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like asking a perfect stranger to dance,&rdquo; he  said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Gordon, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all right. She&rsquo;ll like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carew drew down his cuffs, squared his shoulders, assumed his most  absolutely stolid drawing-room manner, and walked across the room, a gleaming  vision of splendour in his immaculate evening dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I&mdash;er&mdash;have the pleasure of this dance?&rdquo; he said, with  elaborate politeness.</p>
<p>The girl giggled a little, but said nothing, then rose and took  his arm. As she did so, a youth among the talkers at the other end of the room  looked round, and stared for a second. Then he moistened his fingers with his  tongue, smoothed the hair on his temples, and with elbows held out from his  sides, shoulders hunched up and under-jaw stuck well out, bore down on Carew  and the girl, who were getting under way when he came up. Taking not the  slightest notice of Carew, he touched the girl on the shoulder with a sharp  peremptory tap, and brought their dance to a stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere,&rdquo; he said, in commanding tones. &ldquo;&rsquo;Oo are you darncin&rsquo; with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m darncin&rsquo; with &rsquo;im,&rdquo; answered the girl, pertly, indicating the  Englishman with a jerk of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, you&rsquo;re darncin&rsquo; with &rsquo;im, are you? &rsquo;E brought you &rsquo;ere,  p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You know well enough &rsquo;e didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this conversation was going on, the Englishman maintained an  attitude of dignified reserve, leaving it to the lady to decide who was to be  the favoured man. At last he felt it was hardly right for an Oxford man, and a triple blue at that, to be  discussed in this contemptuous way by a larrikin and his &ldquo;donah&rdquo;, so he broke  into the discussion, perhaps a little abruptly, but using his most polished  style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;ah&mdash;asked this lady to dance, and if she&mdash;er&mdash;would be kind enough  to do me the honour,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you arst &rsquo;er to darnce? And what right &rsquo;ad you to arst &rsquo;er to  darnce, you lop-eared rabbit?&rdquo; interrupted the larrikin, raising his voice as  he warmed to his subject. &ldquo;I brought &rsquo;er &rsquo;ere. I paid the shillin&rsquo;. Now then,  you take your &rsquo;ook,&rdquo; he went on, pointing sternly to the door, and talking as  he would to a disobedient dog. &ldquo;Go on, now. Take your &rsquo;ook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Englishman said nothing, but his jaw set ominously. The girl  giggled, delighted at being the centre of so much observation. The band stopped  playing, and the dancers crowded round. Word was passed down that it was a  &ldquo;toff darncin&rsquo; with Nugget&rsquo;s donah&rdquo;, and from various parts of the room  blackcoated duplicates of Nugget hurried swiftly to the scene.</p>
<p>The doorkeeper turned to Gordon. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d best get your mate out o&rsquo;  this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These are the Rocks Push, and they&rsquo;ll deal with him all  right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deal with him, will they?&rdquo; said Gordon, looking at the gesticulating  Nugget. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll bite off more than they can chew if they interfere with him.  This is just his form, a row like this. He&rsquo;s a bit of a champion in a  rough-and-tumble, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he?&rdquo; said the doorkeeper, sardonically. &ldquo;Well, look &rsquo;ere, now,  you take it from me, if there&rsquo;s a row Nugget will spread him out as flat as a  newspaper. They&rsquo;ve all been in the ring in their time, these coves. There&rsquo;s  Nugget, and Ginger, and Brummy&mdash;all red &rsquo;ot. You get him away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Englishman&rsquo;s ire was gradually rising. He was past  the stage of considering whether it was worth while to have a fight over a  factory girl in a shilling dancing saloon, and the desire for battle blazed up  in his eyes. He turned and confronted Nugget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go about your business,&rdquo; he said, dropping all the laboured  politeness out of his tones. &ldquo;If she likes to dance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got no further. A shrill whistle rang through the room; a voice  shouted, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;it &rsquo;im; &rsquo;ook &rsquo;im!&rdquo; His arms were seized from behind and  pinioned to his sides. The lights were turned out. Somebody in front hit him a  terrific crack in the eye at the same moment that someone else administered a  violent kick from the rear. He was propelled by an invisible force to the head  of the stairs, and then&mdash;whizz! down he went in one prodigious leap, clear from  the top to the first landing.</p>
<p>Here, in pitch-darkness, he grappled one of his assailants. For a  few seconds they swayed and struggled, and then rolled down the rest of the  stairs, over and over each other, grappling and clawing, each trying to tear  the other&rsquo;s shirt off. When they rolled into the street, Carew discovered that  he had hold of Charlie Gordon.</p>
<p>They sat up and looked at each other. Then they made a  simultaneous rush for the stairs, but the street door was slammed in their  faces. They kicked it violently, but without result, except that a mob of faces  looked out of the first-floor window and hooted, and a bucket of water was  emptied over them. A crowd collected as if by magic, and the spectacle of two  gentlemen in evening dress trying to kick in the door of a shilling dancing  saloon afforded it unmitigated delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s two toffs got done in all right,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What O! Won&rsquo;t she darnce with you?&rdquo; said another; and somebody  from the back threw banana peel at them.</p>
<p>Charlie recovered his wits first. The Englishman was fairly  berserk with rage, and glared round on the bystanders as if he contemplated a  rush among them. The cabman put an end to the performance. He was tranquil and  unemotional, and he soothed them down and coaxed them into the cab. The band in  the room above resumed the dreamy waltz music of &ldquo;Bid me goodbye and go!&rdquo; and  they went.</p>
<p>Carew subsided into the corner, breathing hard and feeling his  eye. Charlie leant forward and peered out into the darkness. They were nearly  at the club before they spoke. Then he said, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blessed! We made a nice  mess of that, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have got one fair crack at some of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the  Englishman, with heartfelt earnestness. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we go back now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, what&rsquo;s the good? We&rsquo;d never get in. Let the thing alone. We  needn&rsquo;t say anything about it. If once it gets known that we were chucked out,  we&rsquo;ll never hear the last of it. Are you marked at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got an awful swipe in the eye,&rdquo; replied the other briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a cut lip, and my head nearly screwed off. You did that.  I&rsquo;ll know the place again. Some day we&rsquo;ll get a few of the right sort to come  with us, and we&rsquo;ll just go there quietly, as if we didn&rsquo;t mean anything, and  then, all of a sudden, we&rsquo;ll turn in and break the whole place up! Come and  have a drink now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had a silent drink in the deserted club. The mind of each was  filled with a sickening sense of defeat, and without much conversation they  retired to bed. They thanked heaven that the Bo&rsquo;sun, Pinnock, and Gillespie had  disappeared.</p>
<p>Even then Fate hadn&rsquo;t quite finished with the bushman. A newly  joined member of the club, he had lived a life in which he had to shift for  himself, and the ways of luxury were new to him. Consequently, when he awoke  next morning and saw a man moving with cat-like tread about his room,  absolutely taking the money out of his clothes before his very eyes, he sprang  out of bed with a bound and halfthrottled the robber. Then, of course, it  turned out that it was only the bedroom waiter, who was taking his clothes away  to brush them. This&nbsp;<i>contretemps</i>, on top of the overnight mishap,  made him determined to get away from town with all speed. When he looked in the  glass, he found his lip so much swelled that his moustache stuck out in front  like the bowsprit of a ship. At breakfast he joined the Englishman, who had an  eye with as many colours as an opal, not to mention a tired look and dusty  boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you only just up?&rdquo; asked Charlie, as they contemplated each  other.</p>
<p>Carew had resumed his mantle of stolidity, but he coloured a  little at the question. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been out for a bit of a walk round town,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;Fact is,&rdquo; he added in a sudden burst of confidence, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been all over  town lookin&rsquo; for that place where we were last night. Couldn&rsquo;t find anything  like it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie laughed at his earnestness. &ldquo;Oh, bother the place,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;If you had found it, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any of them there. Now,  about ourselves&mdash;we can&rsquo;t show out like this. We&rsquo;d better be off today, and no  one need know anything about it. Besides, I half-killed a waiter this morning.  I thought he was some chap stealing my money, when he only wanted to take my  clothes away to brush &rsquo;em. Sooner we&rsquo;re out of town the better. I&rsquo;ll wire to  the old man that I&rsquo;ve taken you with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, they settled down to breakfast, and by tacit agreement  avoided the club for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Charlie had to call and interview Pinnock, and  left Carew waiting outside while he went in. He didn&rsquo;t want to parade their  injuries, and knew that Carew&rsquo;s eye would excite remark; but by keeping his  upper lip well drawn over his teeth, he hoped his own trouble would escape  notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems a harmless sort of chap, that new chum,&rdquo; said Pinnock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do all right,&rdquo; said Charlie casually. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met his sort  before. He&rsquo;s not such a fool as he lets on to be. Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he killed  somebody before he gets&nbsp;back here, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get on at the dancing saloon?&rdquo; asked Pinnock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, slow enough. Nothing worth seeing. Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sneaked on board the steamer without meeting the Bo&rsquo;sun or  anybody, and before evening were well on their way to No Man&rsquo;s Land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  The Old Station</b></h2>
<p>There are few countries in  the world with such varieties of climate as Australia, and though some stations  are out in the great, red-hot, frying wastes of the Never-Never, others are up  in the hills where a hot night is a thing unknown, where snow falls  occasionally, and where it is no uncommon thing to spend a summer&rsquo;s evening by  the side of a roaring fire. In the matter of improvements, too, stations vary  greatly. Some are in a wilderness with fittings to match; others have  telephones between homestead and out-stations, the jackeroos dress for dinner,  and the station hands are cowed into touching their hats and saying &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;. Also  stations are of all sizes, and the man who is considered quite a big squatter  in the settled districts is thought small potatoes by the magnate &ldquo;out back&rdquo;,  who shears a hundred and fifty thousand sheep, and has an overdraft like the  National Debt. </p>
<p>Kuryong was a hill-country station of about sixty thousand acres  all told; but they were good acres, as no one knew better than old Bully Grant,  the owner, of whose history and disposition we heard something from Pinnock at  the club. It was a highly improved place, with a fine homestead&mdash;thanks to Bully  Grant&rsquo;s money, for in the old days it had been a very different sort of  place&mdash;and its history is typical of the history of hundreds of others.</p>
<p>When Andrew Gordon first bought it, it was held under lease from  the Crown, and there were no improvements to speak of. The station homestead,  so lovingly descanted upon in the advertisement consisted of a two-roomed slab  hut; the woolshed, where the sheep were shorn, was made of gumtree trunks  roofed with bark. The wool went down to Sydney, and station supplies came back,  in huge waggons drawn by eighteen or twenty bullocks, that travelled nine miles  a day on a journey of three hundred miles. There were no neighbours except at  the township of Kiley&rsquo;s Crossing, which consisted of two  public-houses and a store. It was a rough life for the young squatter, and  evidently he found it lonely; for on a visit to Sydney he fell in love with and married a  dainty girl of French descent. Refined, well-educated, and fragile-looking, she  seemed about the last person in the world to take out to a slab-hut homestead  as a squatter&rsquo;s wife. But there is an old saying that blood will tell; and with  all the courage of her Huguenot ancestry she faced the roughness and  discomforts of bush life. On her arrival at the station the old two-roomed hut  was plastered and whitewashed, additional rooms were built, and quite a neat  little home was the result. Seasons were good, and the young squatter might have  gone on shearing sheep and selling fat stock till the end of his life but for  the advent of free selection in 1861.</p>
<p>In that year the Legislature threw open all leasehold lands to the  public for purchase on easy terms and conditions. The idea was to settle an  industrious peasantry on lands hitherto leased in large blocks to the  squatters. This brought down a flood of settlement on Kuryong. At the top end  of the station there was a chain of mountains, and the country was rugged and  patchy&mdash;rich valleys alternating with ragged hills. Here and there about the run  were little patches of specially good land, which were soon snapped up. The  pioneers of these small settlers were old Morgan Donohoe and his wife, who had  built the hotel at Kiley&rsquo;s Crossing; and, on their reports, all their friends  and relatives, as they came out of the &ldquo;ould country&rdquo;, worked their way to  Kuryong, and built little bits of slab and bark homesteads in among the  mountains. The rougher the country, the better they liked it. They were a horse-thieving,  sheep-stealing breed, and the talents which had made them poachers in the old  country soon made them champion bushmen in their new surroundings. The leader  of these mountain settlers was one Doyle, a gigantic Irishman, who had got a  grant of a few hundred acres in the mountains, and had taken to himself a  Scotch wife from among the free immigrants. The story ran that he was too busy  to go to town, but asked a friend to go and pick a wife for him &ldquo;a fine  shtrappin&rsquo; woman, wid a good brisket on her&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Doyles were large, slow, heavy men, with an instinct for the  management of cattle; they were easily distinguished from the Donohoes, who  were little red-whiskered men, enterprising and quick-witted, and ready to do  anything in the world for a good horse. Other strangers and outlanders came to  settle in the district, but from the original settlement up to the date of our  story the two great families of the Doyles and the Donohoes governed the  neighbourhood, and the headquarters of the clans was at Donohoe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shamrock  Hotel&rdquo;, at Kiley&rsquo;s Crossing. Here they used to rendezvous when they went away  down to the plains country each year for the shearing; for they added to their  resources by travelling about the country shearing, droving, fencing, tanksinking,  or doing any other job that offered itself, but always returned to their  mountain fastnesses ready for any bit of work &ldquo;on the cross&rdquo; (i.e., unlawful)  that might turn up. When times got hard they had a handy knack of finding  horses that nobody had lost, shearing sheep they did not own, and branding and  selling other people&rsquo;s calves.</p>
<p>When they stole stock, they moved them on through the mountains as  quickly as possible, always having a brother or uncle, or a cousin&mdash;Terry or  Timothy or Martin or Patsy&mdash;who had a holding &ldquo;beyant&rdquo;. By these means they  could shift stolen stock across the great range, and dispose of them among the  peaceable folk who dwelt in the good country on the other side, whose stock  they stole in return. Many a good horse and fat beast had made the stealthy  mountain journey, lying hidden in gaps and gullies when pursuit grew hot, and  being moved on as things quieted down.</p>
<p>Another striking feature was the way in which they got themselves  mixed up with each other. Their names were so tangled up that no one could keep  tally of them. There was a Red Mick Donohoe (son of the old publican), and his  cousin Black Mick Donohoe, and Red Mick&rsquo;s son Mick, and Black Mick&rsquo;s son Mick,  and Red Mick&rsquo;s son Pat, and Black Mick&rsquo;s son Pat; and there was Gammy Doyle  (meaning Doyle with the lame leg), and Scrammy Doyle (meaning Doyle with the  injured arm), and Bosthoon Doyle and Omadhaun Doyle&mdash;a Bosthoon being a man who  never had any great amount of sense to speak of, while an Omadhaun is a man who  began life with some sense, but lost most of it on his journey. It was a common  saying in the country-side that if you met a man on the mountains you should  say, &ldquo;Good day, Doyle,&rdquo; and if he replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my name,&rdquo; you should at  once say, &ldquo;Well, meant no offence, Mr Donohoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One could generally pick which was which of the original stock,  but when they came to intermarry there was no telling t&rsquo;other from which.  Startling likenesses cropped up among the relatives, and it was widely rumoured  that one Doyle who was known to be in gaol, and who was vaguely spoken of by  the clan as being &ldquo;away&rdquo;, was in fact serving an accumulation of sentences for  himself and other members of the family, whose sins he had for a consideration  taken on himself.</p>
<p>With such neighbours as these fighting him for every block of  land, Andrew Gordon soon came to the end of his resources, and it was then that  he had to take in his old manager as a partner. Before Bully Grant had been in  the firm long, he had secured nearly all the good land, and the industrious  yeomanry that the Land Act was supposed to create were hiding away up the  gullies on miserable little patches of bad land, stealing sheep for a living.  Bully fought them stoutly, impounded their sheep and cattle, and prosecuted  trespassers and thieves; and, his luck being wonderful, he soon added to the  enormous fortune he had made in mining, while Andrew Gordon died impoverished.  When he died, old Bully gave the management of the stations to his sons, and  contented himself with finding fault. But one dimly remembered episode in his  career was talked of by the old hands around Kiley&rsquo;s Hotel, long after Grant  had become a wealthy man, and had gone for long trips to England.</p>
<p>Grant, in spite of the judgment and sagacity on which he prided  himself, had at various times in his career made mistakes&mdash;mistakes in station  management, mistakes about stock, mistakes about men, and last, but not least,  mistakes about women; and it was to one of these mistakes that the gossips  referred.</p>
<p>When he was a young man working as Mr Gordon&rsquo;s manager, and living  with the horse-breaker and the ration-carrier on the out-station at Kuryong (in  those days a wild, half-civilised place), he had for neighbours Red Mick&rsquo;s  father and mother, the original Mr and Mrs Donohoe, and their family. Their  eldest daughter, Peggy&mdash;&ldquo;Carrotty Peg&rdquo;, her relations called her&mdash;was at that  time a fine, strapping, bush girl, and the only unmarried white woman anywhere  near the station. She was as fair-complexioned as Red Mick himself, with a magnificent  head of red hair, and the bust and limbs of a young Amazon.</p>
<p>This young woman, as she grew up, attracted the attention of Billy  the Bully, and they used to meet a good deal out in the bush. On such  occasions, he would possibly be occupied in the inspiriting task of dragging a  dead sheep after his horse, to make a trail to lead the wild dogs up to some  poisoned meat; while the lady, clad in light and airy garments, with a huge  white sunbonnet for head-gear, would be riding straddle-legged in search of strayed  cows. When Grant left the station, and went away to make his fortune in mining,  it was, perhaps, just a coincidence that this magnificent young creature grew  tired of the old place and &ldquo;cleared out&rdquo;, too. She certainly went away and  disappeared so utterly that even her own people did not know what had become of  her; to the younger generation her very existence was only a vague tradition.  But it was whispered here and muttered there among the Doyles and the Donohoes  and their friends and relations, that old Billy the Bully, on one of his visits  to the interior, had been married to this undesirable lady by a duly accredited  parson, in the presence of responsible witnesses; and that, when everyone had  their own, Carrotty Peg, if alive, would be the lady of Kuryong. However, she  had never come back to prove it, and no one cared about asking her alleged  husband any unpleasant questions.</p>
<p>So much for the history of its owners; now to describe the  homestead itself. It had originally consisted of the two-roomed slab hut, which  had been added to from time to time. Kitchen, outhouses, bachelors&rsquo; quarters,  saddle-rooms, and store-rooms had been built on in a kind of straggling  quadrangle, with many corners and unexpected doorways and passages; and it is  reported that a swagman once got his dole of rations at the kitchen, went away,  and after turning two or three corners, got so tangled up that when Fate led  him back to the kitchen he didn&rsquo;t recognise it, and asked for the rations over  again, in the firm belief that he was at a different part of the house.</p>
<p>The original building was still the principal living-room, but the  house had grown till it contained about twenty rooms. The slab walls had been  plastered and whitewashed, and a wide verandah ran all along the front. Round  the house were acres of garden, with great clumps of willows and acacias, where  the magpies sat in the heat of the day and sang to one another in their sweet,  low warble.</p>
<p>The house stood on a spur running from the hills. Looking down the  river from it, one saw level flats waving with long grasses, in which the  solemn cattle waded knee-deep. Here and there clumps of willows and stately  poplars waved in the breeze. In the clear, dry air all colours were startlingly  vivid, and round the nearer foothills wonderful lights and shadows played and  shifted, while sometimes a white fleece of mist would drift slowly across a  distant hill, like a film of snowy lace on the face of a beautiful woman. Away  behind the foothills were the grand old mountains, with their snow-clad tops  gleaming in the sun.</p>
<p>The garden was almost as lacking in design as the house. There  were acres of fruit trees, with prairie grass growing at their roots, trees  whereon grew luscious peaches and juicy egg-plums; long vistas of grapevines,  with little turnings and alleys, regular lovers&rsquo; walks, where the scent of  honeysuckle intoxicated the senses. At the foot of the garden was the river, a  beautiful stream, fed by the mountain-snow, and rushing joyously over clear  gravel beds, whose million-tinted pebbles flashed in the sunlight like so many  opals.</p>
<p>In some parts of Australia  it is difficult to tell summer from winter; but up in this mountain-country  each season had its own attractions. In the spring the flats were green with  lush grass, speckled with buttercups and bachelors&rsquo; buttons, and the willows  put out their new leaves, and all manner of shy dry-scented bush flowers  bloomed on the ranges; and the air was full of the song of birds and the  calling of animals. Then came summer, when never a cloud decked the arch of  blue sky, and all animated nature drew into the shade of big trees until the  evening breeze sprang up, bringing sweet scents of the dry grass and ripening  grain. In autumn, the leaves of the English trees turned all tints of yellow  and crimson, and the grass in the paddocks went brown; and the big bullock  teams worked from dawn till dark, hauling in their loads of hay from the  cultivation paddocks.</p>
<p>But most beautiful of all was winter, when logs blazed in the huge  fireplaces, and frosts made the ground crisp, and the stock, long-haired and  shaggy, came snuffling round the stables, picking up odds and ends of straw;  when the grey, snow-clad mountains looked but a stone&rsquo;s throw away in the  intensely clear air, and the wind brought a colour to the cheeks and a tingling  to the blood that made life worth living.</p>
<p>Such was Kuryong homestead, where lived Charlie Gordon&rsquo;s mother  and his brother Hugh, with a lot of children left by another brother who, like  many others, had gone up to Queensland to make his fortune, and had left his  bones there instead; and to look after these young folk there was a governess,  Miss Harriott.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Coming of the Heiress</b></h2>
<p>The spring&mdash;the glorious hill-country spring&mdash;was down on Kuryong. All  the flats along Kiley&rsquo;s River were knee-deep in green grass. The wattle-trees  were out in golden bloom, and the snow-water from the mountains set the river  running white with foam, fighting its way over bars of granite into big pools  where the platypus dived, and the wild ducks&mdash;busy with the cares of  nesting&mdash;just settled occasionally to snatch a hasty meal and then hurried off,  with a whistle of strong wings, back to their little ones. The breeze brought  down from the hills a scent of grass and bush flowers. There was life and  movement everywhere. The little foals raced and played all day in the sunshine  round their big sleepy mothers; the cattle bellowed to each other from hill to  hill; even those miserable brutes, the sheep, frisked in an ungainly way when  anything startled them. At all the little mountain-farms and holdings young  Doyles and Donohoes were catching their horses, lean after the winter&rsquo;s  starvation, and loading the pack-saddles for their five-months&rsquo; trip out to the  borders of Queensland, from shearing-shed to shearing-shed. A couple of months  before they started, they would write to the squatters for whom they had worked  on previous shearings&mdash;such quaint, ill-spelled letters&mdash;asking that a pen might  be kept for them. Great shearers they were, too, for the mountain air bred  hardy men, and while they were at it they worked feverishly, bending themselves  nearly double over the sheep, and making the shears fly till the sweat ran down  their foreheads and dripped on the ground; and they peeled the yellow wool off sheep  after sheep as an expert cook peels an apple. In the settled districts such as  Kuryong, where the flocks were small, they were made to shear carefully; but  away out on the Queensland  side, on a station with two hundred thousand sheep to get through, they rushed  the wool off savagely. He was a poor specimen of the clan who couldn&rsquo;t shear  his hundred and twenty sheep between bell and bell; and the price was a pound a  hundred, with plenty of stations wanting shearers, so they made good cheques in  those days.</p>
<p>One glorious spring morning, Hugh Gordon was sitting in his  office&mdash;every squatter and stationmanager has an office&mdash;waiting with  considerable impatience the coming of the weekly mail. The office looked like a  blend of stationer&rsquo;s shop, tobacconist&rsquo;s store, and saddlery warehouse. A row  of pigeon-holes along the walls was filled with letters and papers; the rafters  were hung with saddles and harness; a tobacco-cutter and a jar of tobacco stood  on the table, side by side with some formidable-looking knives, used for  cutting the sheep&rsquo;s feet when they became diseased; whips and guns stood in  every corner; nails and saws filled up a lot of boxes on the table, and a few  samples of wool hung from a rope that was stretched across the room. The  mantelpiece was occupied by bottles of horse-medicine and boxes of cartridges;  an elderly white cockatoo, chained by the leg to a galvanised-iron perch,  sunned himself by the door, and at intervals gave an exhibition of his latest  accomplishment, in which he imitated the yowl of a trodden-on cat much better  than the cat could have done it himself.</p>
<p>The air was heavy with scent. All round the great quadrangle of  the house acacia trees were in bloom, and the bees were working busily among  the mignonette and roses in front of the office door.</p>
<p>Hugh Gordon was a lithe, wiry young Australian with intensely  sunburnt face and hands, and a drooping black moustache; a man with a healthy,  breezy outdoor appearance, but the face of an artist, a dreamer, and a thinker,  rather than that of a practical man. His brother Charlie and he, though very  much alike in face, were quite different types of manhood. Charlie, from his  earliest school-days, had never read a book except under compulsion, had never  stayed indoors when he could possibly get out, had never obeyed an unwelcome  order when by force or fraud he could avoid doing so, and had never written a  letter in his life when a telegram would do. He took the world as it came,  having no particular amount of imagination, and never worried himself. Hugh, on  the other hand, was inclined to meet trouble half-way, and to make troubles  where none existed, which is the worst misfortune that a man can be afflicted  with.</p>
<p>Hugh walked to the door and gazed out over the garden and  homestead, down the long stretch of green paddocks where fat cattle were  standing under the trees, too well fed to bother themselves with looking for  grass. He looked beyond all this to the long drab-coloured stretch of road that  led to Kiley&rsquo;s, watching for the mailboy&rsquo;s arrival. The mail was late, for the  melting snow had flooded the mountain creeks, and Hugh knew it was quite likely  that little Patsy Donohoe, the mailboy, had been blocked at Donohoe&rsquo;s Hotel for  two days, unable to cross Kiley&rsquo;s River. This had happened often, and on  various occasions when Patsy had crossed, he, pony and all, had been swept down  quite a quarter of a mile in the ice-cold water before they could reach land.  But that was an ordinary matter in the spring, and it was a point of honour  with Patsy and all his breed not to let the elements beat them in carrying out  the mail contract, which they tendered for every year, and in which no outsider  would have dared to compete.</p>
<p>At last Hugh&rsquo;s vigil was rewarded by the appearance of a small and  wild-looking boy, mounted on a large and wild-looking horse. The boy was about  twelve years of age, and had just ridden a half-broken horse a forty-mile  journey&mdash;for of such is the youth of Australia. Patsy was wet and dirty,  and the big leather mail-bag that he handed over had evidently been under  water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to swim, Mr Hugh,&rdquo; the boy said triumphantly, &ldquo;and this  great, clumsy cow &rdquo; (the child referred to his horse) &ldquo;he reared over on me in  the water, twyst, but I stuck to him. My oath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh laughed. &ldquo;I expect Kiley&rsquo;s River will get you yet, Patsy,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;Go in now to the kitchen and get dry by the fire. I&rsquo;ll lend you a horse  to get back on tomorrow. You can camp here till then, there&rsquo;s no hurry back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy let his horse go loose, dismissing it with a parting whack  on the rump with the bridle, and swaggered inside, carrying his saddle, to show  his wet clothes and recount his deeds to the admiring cook. Patsy was not one  to hide his light under a bushel.</p>
<p>Hugh carried the bag into the office, and shook out the letters  and papers on the table. Everything was permeated with a smell of wet leather,  and some of the newspapers were rather pulpy. After sending out everybody  else&rsquo;s mail he turned to examine his own. Out of the mass of letters, agents&rsquo;  circulars, notices of sheep for sale, catalogues of city firms, and circulars  from pastoral societies, he picked a letter addressed to himself in the  scrawling fist of William Grant. He opened it, expecting to find in it the  usual Commination Service on things in general, but as he read on, a vivid  surprise spread over his face. Leaving the other letters and papers unopened,  he walked to the door and looked out into the courtyard, where Stuffer, the  youngest of his nephews, who was too small to be allowed to join in the field  sports of the others, was playing at being a railway train. He had travelled in  a train once, and now passed Hugh&rsquo;s door under easy steam, working his arms and  legs like piston-rods, and giving piercing imitations of a steam-whistle at  intervals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuffer,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;do you know where your grandmother is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Stuffer laconically. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. Choo, choo, choo,  Whee-aw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look here,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;you just railway-train yourself  round the house till you find her, and let me know where she is. I want to see  her. Off you go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Stuffer steamed himself out with the action of an engine  drawing a long train of cars, and disappeared round the corner of the house.</p>
<p>Before long he was back, drew himself up alongside an imaginary  platform, intimated that his grandmother was on the verandah, and then  proceeded to let the steam hiss out of his safety-valve.</p>
<p>Hugh walked across the quadrangle, under the acacia tree, heavy  with blossoms, in which a myriad bees were droning at their work, and through  the house on to the front verandah, which looked over the wide sweep of  river-flat. Here he found his mother and Miss Harriott, the governess, peeling  apples for dumplings&mdash;great rosy-cheeked, solid-fleshed apples, that the  hill-country turns out in perfection. The old lady was slight in figure, with a  refined face, and a carriage erect in spite of her years. Miss Harriott was of  a languid Spanish type, with black eyes and strongly marked eyebrows. She had  a&nbsp;<i>petite</i>, but well-rounded figure, with curiously small hands and  feet. Though only about twenty-four years of age she had the sedate and  unemotional look that one sees in doctors and nurses&mdash;people who have looked on  death and birth, and sorrow and affliction. For Ellen Harriott had done her  three years&rsquo; course as a nurse; she had a natural faculty for the business, and  was in great request among the wild folk of the mountains, who looked upon her  (and perhaps rightly) as quite equal to the Tarrong doctor in any emergency.  She knew them all, for she had lived nearly all her life at Kuryong. When the  family moved there from the back country a tutor was needed for the boys, and  an old broken-down gentleman accepted the billet at low pay, on condition that  he was allowed to bring his little daughter with him. When he died, the  daughter still stayed on, and was made governess to the new generation of young  folk. She was a queer, self-contained girl, saying little; and as Hugh walked  in, she looked up at him, and wondered what new trouble was bringing him to his  mother with the open letter in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;I have had a most extraordinary letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Mr Grant?&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw by her son&rsquo;s face that there was something more than usual  in the wind, but one who had lived her life, from fortune to poverty, through  strife and trial, was prepared to take things much more easily than Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it anything very serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His daughter&rsquo;s coming out to live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here&rsquo;s the letter. It only came this morning. Patsy was late,  the river is up. I&rsquo;ll read it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seating himself at the table, Hugh spread out the letter, and read  it:&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dear    Gordon,</p>
          <p class="note">&ldquo;The    last lot of wethers, though they topped the market, only realised 10/-. I    think you would show better judgment in keeping these sheep back a little.    Don&rsquo;t rely upon Sutton&rsquo;s advice. He is generally wrong, and is always most    wrong when he is most sure he is right.</p>
        <p class="note">&ldquo;My    daughter has arrived from England,    and will at once go up to the station. I have written to your mother on the    subject. My daughter will represent me in everything, so I wish her to learn    a little about stations. Send to meet her at the train on Wednesday next.</p>
        <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yours    truly,</p>
        <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;W.    G. GRANT&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wednesday next!&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;that letter is three days delayed.  Patsy couldn&rsquo;t cross the river. She&rsquo;ll be there before we can possibly get  down. If no one meets her I wonder if she&rsquo;ll have pluck enough to get into the  coach and come on to Donohoe&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t envy her the trip, if she does,&rdquo; said Miss Harriott. &ldquo;The  coach-drive over those roads will seem awful to an English girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go down at once, anyhow,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;and meet her  on the road somewhere. If she is at the railway, I can get there in two days.  Have you a letter, Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t show it to you now. You  shall see it some other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll set about making a start,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;What trap had I  better take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take the big waggonette,&rdquo; said the old lady, in her  soft voice. &ldquo;A young girl just out from England is sure to have a great  deal of luggage, you know. I wonder if she is anything like Mr Grant. I hope  her temper is a little bit better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come down with me, Miss Harriott, to meet her,&rdquo; said  Hugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose your luggage would be a load there and back, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about crossing the river?&rdquo; said the old lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll get across somehow,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; said the young lady meditatively. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be  tired from travelling and looking after her luggage, and she had better meet  the family one at a time. You go and meet her, and your mother and I will get  her room ready. Does the letter say any more about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll send the boy to run in  the horses. I&rsquo;ll take four horses in the big waggonette; I expect she&rsquo;ll be  waiting at Donohoe&rsquo;s&mdash;that is, if she left the railway station in the coach&mdash;if  she is at Donohoe&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll be back before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this he went back to the office, and his mother and Miss  Harriott went their separate ways to prepare for the comfort of the heiress. To  Ellen Harriott the arrival was a new excitement, a change in the monotony of  bush life; but to the old lady and Hugh it meant a great deal more. It meant  that they would be no longer master and mistress of the big station on which  they had lived so long, and which was now so much under their control that it  seemed almost like their own.</p>
<p>Everything depended on what the girl was like. They had never even  seen a photograph of her, and awaited her coming in a state of nervous  expectancy. All over the district they had been practically considered owners  of the big station; Hugh had taken on and dismissed employees at his will, had  controlled the buying and selling of thousands of sheep and cattle, and now  this strange girl was to come in with absolute power over them. They would be  servants and dependants on the station, which had once belonged to them.</p>
<p>After Hugh had gone, the old lady sat back in her armchair and  read over again her letter from Mr Grant; and, lest it should be thought that  that gentleman had only one side to his character, it is as well for the reader  to know what was in the letter. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dear  Mrs Gordon,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  am writing to you about a most important matter. Colonel Selwyn is dead, and my  daughter has come out from England.  I don&rsquo;t know anyone to take charge of her except yourself. I am an old man now,  and set in my ways, and this girl is really all I have to live for. Looking  back on my life, I see where I have been a fool; and perhaps the good fortune  that has followed me has been more luck than anything else. Your husband was a  smarter man than I am, and he came to grief, though I will say that I always  warned him against that western place.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Do  you remember the old days when we had the two little homesteads, and I used to  ride down from the out-station of a Saturday and spend Sunday with you and  Andrew, and talk over the fortunes we were going to make? If I had met a woman  like you in those days I might have been a better man. As it was, I made a fool  of myself. But that&rsquo;s all past praying for.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Now  about my girl. If you will take her, and make her as good a woman as yourself,  or as near it as you can, you will earn my undying thanks. As to money matters,  when I die she will of course have a great deal of money, so that it is well  she should begin now to learn how to use it; I have, therefore, given her full  power to draw all money that may be required. I may tell you that I intend to  leave your boys enough to start them in life, and they will have a first-class  chance to get on. I am sending Charlie out to the west, to take over a block  which those fools, Sutton and Co, got me to advance money on, and on which the  man cannot pay his interest. He will be away for some time.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Meanwhile,  dear Mrs Gordon, for the sake of old times, do what you can for the girl. I  expect she has been brought up with English ideas. I can&rsquo;t get her to say much  to me, which I daresay is my own fault. After she has been with you for a bit,  I will come up and stay for a time at the station.</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yours  very truly,</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;W.  G. GRANT&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reading this letter called back the whole panorama of the past&mdash;the  old days when she and her husband were struggling in the rough, hard,  pioneering life, and the blacks were thick round the station; the birth of her  children, and the ups and downs of her husband&rsquo;s fortunes; then the burial of  her husband out on the sandhills, and her flight to this haven of rest at Kuryong.  Though she had lost interest in things for herself, she felt keenly for her  children, and was sick at heart when she thought what this girl, who was to  wield such power over them, might turn out to be. But she hoped that Grant&rsquo;s  daughter, whatever else she might be, would at any rate be a genuine,  straight-forward girl; and filled with this hope, she sat down to answer him:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dear  Mr Grant,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;I have received your letter. Hugh has gone down to meet  your daughter, but the mails were delayed owing to the river being up, and he  may not get to the railway station as soon as she arrives. I will do what I can  for her, and I thank you for what you say you will do for my boys. I will let  you know the moment she arrives. I wish you would come up and live on the  station for a time. It would be better for you than life in the club, without a  friend to care for you. If ever you feel inclined to stay here for a time, I  hope you will at once let me know. With thanks and best wishes,</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yours  truly,</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;ANNETTE&nbsp;GORDON&rdquo;</p>

  A Coach Accident</b></h2>
<p>The coach from Tarrong railway  station to Emu Flat, and then on to Donohoe&rsquo;s Hotel, ran twice a week. Pat  Donohoe was mailman, contractor and driver, and his admirers said that Pat could  hit his five horses in more places at once than any other man on the face of  the earth. His coach was horsed by the neighbouring squatters, through whose  stations the road ran; and any horse that developed homicidal tendencies, or  exhibited a disinclination to work, was at once handed over to the mailman to  be licked into shape. The result was that, as a rule, Pat was driving teams  composed of animals that would do anything but go straight, but under his  handling they were generally persuaded, after a day or two, to settle down to  their work. </p>
<p>On the day when Hugh and Mrs Gordon read Mr Grant&rsquo;s letter at  Kuryong, the train deposited at Tarrong, a self-reliant young lady of about  twenty, accompanied by nearly a truck-full of luggage&mdash;solid leather portmanteaux,  canvas-covered bags, iron boxes, and so on&mdash;which produced a great sensation  among the rustics. She was handsome enough to be called a beauty, and  everything about her spoke of exuberant health and vitality. Her figure was  supple, and she had the clear pink and white complexion which belongs to cold  climates.</p>
<p>She seemed accustomed to being waited on, and watched without  emotion the guard and the solitary railway official&mdash;porter, station-master,  telegraph-operator and lantern-man, all rolled into one&mdash;haul her hundredweights  of luggage out of the train. Then she told the perspiring station-master, etc.,  to please have the luggage sent to the hotel, and marched over to that building  in quite an assured way, carrying a small handbag. Three commercial travellers,  who had come up by the same train, followed her off the platform, and the most  gallant of the three winked at his friends, and then stepped up and offered to  carry her bag. The young lady gave him a pleasant smile, and handed him the  bag; together they crossed the street, while the other commercials marched  disconsolately behind. At the door of the hotel she took the bag from her  cavalier, and there and then, in broad Australian daylight, rewarded him with  twopence&mdash;a disaster which caused him to apply to his firm for transfer to some  foreign country at once. She marched into the bar, where Dan, the landlord&rsquo;s  son, was sweeping, while Mrs Connellan, the landlady, was wiping glasses in the  midst of a stale fragrance of overnight beer and tobacco smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to Kuryong,&rdquo; said the young lady, &ldquo;and I expected to  meet Mr Gordon here. Is he here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Connellan looked at her open-eyed. Such an apparition was not  often seen in Tarrong. Mr and Mrs Connellan had only just &ldquo;taken the pub&rdquo;, and  what with trying to keep Connellan sober and refusing drinks to tramps, loafers  and blackfellows, Mrs Connellan was pretty well worn out. As for making the  hotel pay, that idea had been given up long ago. It was against Mrs Connellan&rsquo;s  instincts of hospitality to charge anyone for a meal or a bed, and when any  great rush of bar trade took place it generally turned out to be &ldquo;Connellan&rsquo;s  shout&rdquo;, so the hotel was not exactly a gold-mine. In fact, Mrs Connellan had  decided that the less business she did, the more money she would make; and she  rather preferred that people should not stop at her hotel. This girl looked as  if she would give trouble; might even expect clean beds and clean sheets when  there were none within the hotel, and might object to fleas, of which there were  plenty. So the landlady pulled herself together, and decided to speed the  parting guest as speedily as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Gordon couldn&rsquo;t git in,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The cricks (creeks) is all  up. The coach is going down to Kiley&rsquo;s Crossing today. You had better go with  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon does the coach start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an hour or two. As soon as Pat Donohoe, the mailman, has got a  horse shod. Come in and have a wash, and fix yourself up till breakfast is  ready. Where&rsquo;s your bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My luggage is at the railway station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send Dan over for it. Dan, Dan, Dan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello,&rdquo; said Dan&rsquo;s voice, from the passage, where, with the  wild-eyed servant-girl, he had been taking stock of the new arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go over to the station and git this lady&rsquo;s bag. Is there much to  carry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only four portmanteaux and three bags, and two boxes  and a hat-box, and a roll of rugs; and please be careful of the hat-box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better git the barrer, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better git the bloomin&rsquo; bullock dray,&rdquo; growled Dan, quite keen to  see this aggregation of luggage; and foreseeing something to talk about for the  next three months. &ldquo;She must ha&rsquo; come up to start a store, I reckon,&rdquo; said Dan;  and off he went to struggle with boxes for the next half-hour or so.</p>
<p>Over Mary Grant&rsquo;s experiences at the Tarrong Hotel we will not  linger. The dirty water, peopled by wriggling animalcul&aelig;, that she poured out  of the bedroom jug; the damp, cloudy, unhealthy-smelling towel on which she  dried her face; the broken window through which she could hear herself being  discussed by loafers in the yard; all these things are matters of course in  bush townships, for the Australian, having a soul above details, does not shine  at hotel-keeping. The breakfast was enlivened by snatches of song from the big,  good-natured bush girl who waited at table, and who &ldquo;fancied&rdquo; her voice  somewhat, and marched into the breakfast-room singing in an ear-splitting  soprano:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a vilet from me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>spoken</i>.) &ldquo;What you&rsquo;ll have, there&rsquo;s chops, steaks, and  bacon and eggs&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Chops, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>singer continues</i>.) &ldquo;Sainted mother&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>spoken</i>.) &ldquo;Tea or coffee&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Tea, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(<i>singer finishes</i>.)&mdash;&ldquo;grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she ate, Miss Grant had an uneasy feeling that she was being  stared at; all the female staff and hangers-on of the place having gathered  round the door to peer in at her and to appraise to the last farthing her hat,  her tailor-made gown, and her solid English walking-shoes, and to indulge in  wild speculation as to who or what she could be. A Kickapoo Indian in full  war-paint, arriving suddenly in a little English village, could not have  created more excitement than she did at Tarrong. After breakfast she walked out  on the verandah that ran round the little one-storey weatherboard hotel, and  looked down the mile and a-half of road, with little galvanised-iron-roofed cottages  at intervals of a quarter of a mile or so, that constituted the township. She  watched Conroy, the policeman, resplendent in breeches and polished boots,  swagger out from the court-house yard, leading his horse to water. The town was  waking to its daily routine; Carry, the butcher, took down the clumsy board  that passed for a window-shutter, and McDermott, the carter, passed the hotel,  riding a huge rough-coated draught horse, bare-backed. Everyone gave him a  &ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Billy!&rdquo; as he passed, and he returned the greeting as he did every  morning of his life. A few children loitered past to the little school-house,  staring at her as though she were some animal.</p>
<p>She was in a hurry to get away&mdash;English people always are&mdash;but in  the bright lexicon of the bush there is no such word as hurry. Tracey, the  blacksmith, had not by any means finished shoeing the coach horse yet. So Mrs  Connellan made an attempt to find out who she was, and why she was going to  Kuryong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a nice trip in the coach,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Lier (lawyer)  Blake&rsquo;s going down. He&rsquo;s a nice feller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Miss Grant politely responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Kelly, too. He&rsquo;s good company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you staying long at Kuryong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time, I expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to teach the children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to live there. My father owns Kuryong. My father is  Mr Grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Connellan was simply staggered at this colossal  treasure-trove, this majestic piece of gossip that had fallen on her like rain  from Heaven. Mr Grant&rsquo;s daughter! Going out to Kuryong! What a piece of news!  Hardly knowing what she did, she shuffled out of the room, and interrupted the  singing waitress who was wiping plates, and had just got back to &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a vilet&rdquo;  when Mrs Connellan burst in on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maggie! Maggie! Do you know who that is? Grant&rsquo;s daughter! The  one that used to be in England.  She must be going to Kuryong to live, with all that luggage. What&rsquo;ll the  Gordons say? The old lady won&rsquo;t like it, will she? This&rsquo;ll be a bit of news,  won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; And she went off to tell the cook, while Maggie darted to the door  to meet Dan, and tell him.</p>
<p>Dan told the station-master when he went back for the next load,  and when he had finished carting the luggage he got on a horse and went round  telling everybody in the little town. The station-master told the ganger of the  four navvies who went by on their trolly down the line to work. At the end of  their four-mile length they told the ration-carrier of Eubindal station, who  happened to call in at their camp for a drink of tea. He hurried off to the  head-station with the news, and on his way told three teamsters, an inspector  of selections, and a black boy belonging to Mylong station, whom he happened to  meet on the road. Each of them told everybody that they met, pulling up and  standing in their stirrups to discuss the matter in all its bearings, in the  leisurely style of the bush; and wondering what she had come out for, whether  the Gordons would get the sack from Kuryong, whether she would marry Hugh  Gordon, whether she was engaged already, whether she was good-looking, how much  money she had, and how much old Grant would leave her. In fact, before  twenty-four hours were over, all the district knew of her arrival; which  possibly explains how news travels in Africa among the Kaffirs, who are  supposed to have a signalling system that no one has yet fathomed; but the way  it gets round in Australia is just as wonderful as among the Kaffirs, in fact,  for speed and thoroughness of information we should be inclined to think that  our coloured brethren run a bad second.</p>
<p>At last, however, Tracey had finished shoeing the coach horse, and  Miss Grant, with part of her luggage, took a seat on the coach behind five of  Donohoe&rsquo;s worst horses, next to a well-dressed, powerfully built man of about  five-and-twenty. He looked and talked like a gentleman, and she heard the  coachman address him as &ldquo;Mr Blake&rdquo;. She and he shared the box-seat with the  driver, and just at the last moment the local priest hurried up and climbed on  the coach. In some unaccountable way he had missed hearing who the young lady  was, and for a time he could only look at her back hair and wonder.</p>
<p>It was not long before, in the free and easy Australian style, the  passengers began to talk to each other as the coach bumped along its monotonous  road&mdash;up one hill, through an avenue of dusty, tired-looking gumtrees, down the  other side through a similar avenue, up another hill precisely the same as the  last, and so on.</p>
<p>Blake was the first to make advances. &ldquo;Not much to be seen on this  sort of journey, Miss Grant,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The young lady looked at him with serious eyes. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said,  &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve only seen two houses since we left the town. All the rest of the country  seems to be a wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the priest broke in. He was a broth of a boy from Maynooth,  just the man to handle the Doyle and Donohoe congregation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the big stations is the roon of the country,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How  is the country to go ahead wid all the good land locked up? There&rsquo;s Kuryong on  ahead here would support two hundred fam&rsquo;lies, and what does it employ now?  Half a dozen shepherds, widout a rag to their back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to Kuryong,&rdquo; said the girl, and the priest was silent.</p>
<p>By four in the afternoon they reached Kiley&rsquo;s River, running  yellow and froth-covered with melting snow. The coachman pulled his horses up  on the bank, and took a good, long look at the bearings. As they waited, the  Kuryong vehicle came down on the other side of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mr Gordon,&rdquo; said the coachman. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll try  it. I reckon it&rsquo;s a trifle deep for me. Do you want to get across particular,  Mr Blake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very particularly, Pat. I&rsquo;ve told Martin Donohoe to meet me  down here with some witnesses in a cattle-stealing case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you, Father Kelly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m go&rsquo;n on to Tim Murphy&rsquo;s dyin&rsquo; bed. Put &rsquo;em into the wather,  they&rsquo;ll take it aisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver turned to the third passenger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit  dangerous-like, Miss. If you like to get out, it&rsquo;s up to you to say so. The  coach might wash over. There&rsquo;s a settler&rsquo;s place up the river a mile. You can  go and stay there till the river goes down, and Mr Gordon&rsquo;ll come and meet  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;ll go on,&rdquo; said the lady.</p>
<p>Preparations for crossing the river were soon made. Anything that  would spoil by getting wet, or that would float out of the coach, was lifted up  and packed on the roof. The passengers stood up on the seats. Then Pat Donohoe  put the whip on his leaders, and calling to his two wheelers, old-seasoned  veterans, he put them at it.</p>
<p>Snorting and trembling, the leaders picked their way into the  yellow water, the coach bumping over the rubble of the crossing-place. Hugh  Gordon, watching from the far-side of the river, saw the coach dip and rock and  plunge over the boulders. On it came till the water was actually lapping into  the body of the coach, roaring and swirling round the horses&rsquo; legs, up to their  flanks and bellies, while the driver called out to them and kept them straight  with voice and reins. Every spring he had a similar crossing, and he knew  almost to an inch at what height it was safe to go into the river. But this  time, as ill-luck would have it, the off-side leader was a young, vicious,  thoroughbred colt, who had been handed over to him to be cured of a propensity  for striking people with his fore-feet. As the horses worked their way into the  river, the colt, with the courage of his breeding, pulled manfully, and  breasted the current fearlessly. But suddenly a floating log drifted down, and  struck him on the front legs. In an instant he reared up, and threw himself  heavily sideways against his mate, bringing him to his knees; then the two of  them, floundering and scrambling, were borne away with the current, dragging  the coach after them. In a few yards they were off the causeway; the coach,  striking deep water, settled like a boat, and turned over on its side, with the  leaders swimming for their lives. As for the wheelers, they were pulled down  with the vehicle, and were almost drowning in their harness.</p>
<p>Cool as a cucumber, Blake had turned to the girl. &ldquo;Can you swim?&rdquo;  he said. And she answered him as coolly, &ldquo;Yes, a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, put your hands on my shoulders, and leave everything to  me.&rdquo; Just then the coach settled over with one final surge, and they were in  the water.</p>
<p>Away they went with the roaring current, the girl clinging fast to  his shoulders, while he gave his whole attention to dodging the stumps and  snags that were showing their formidable teeth above water. For a while she was  able to hold on. Then, with a sickening sense of helplessness, she felt herself  torn from him, and whirled away like a leaf. The rank smell of the muddy water  was in her nostrils, the fear of death in her heart. She struggled to keep  afloat. Suddenly a blood-streaked face appeared, and Blake, bleeding from a cut  on the forehead, caught her with a strong grip and drew her to him. A few more  seconds of whirling chaos, and she felt land under her feet, and Blake  half-carrying her to the bank. They had been swept on to one of the many  sand-banks which ran out into the stream, and were safe.</p>
<p>Half-hysterical, she sat down on a huge log, and waited while  Blake ran upstream to give help to the coachman. While the two had been  battling in the water, the priest had stayed with the coachman to cut the  horses free, till at last all four got clear of the wreck, and swam ashore.  Then the men followed them, drifting down tne current and fighting their way to  shore at about the same place.</p>
<p>Hugh Gordon drove the waggonette down to pick up the party when  they landed. The scene on the bank would have made a good picture. The horses,  dripping with water and shaking with cold, were snorting and staring, while the  coachman was trying to fix up some gear out of the wreck, so that he could ride  one of them. The priest, his broad Irish face ornamented by a black clay pipe,  was tramping up and down in his wet clothes. Blake was helping Miss Grant to  wring the water out of her clothes, and she was somewhat incoherently trying to  thank him. As Hugh drove up, Blake looked up and caught his eye, and there  flashed between the two men an unmistakable look of hostility. Then Hugh jumped  from the waggonette, and walked up to Miss Grant, holding out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Hugh Gordon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We only got your father&rsquo;s letter  today, or I would have been down to meet you. I hope you are not hurt. Jump  into the trap, and I&rsquo;ll run down to the Donohoes&rsquo;, and get you some dry  things.&rdquo; Then, turning to Blake, he said somewhat stiffly, &ldquo;Will you get in, Mr  Blake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Blake, equally stiffly, &ldquo;I can ride one of the mail  horses. It&rsquo;s no distance. won&rsquo;t trouble you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl turned and put her hand into Blake&rsquo;s, and spoke with  the air of a queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you&mdash;more than I can tell you. You have  saved my life. If ever I can do anything to repay you I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; said Blake, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s nothing. It was only a matter  of dodging the stumps. You&rsquo;d better get on now to Donohoe&rsquo;s Hotel, and get Mrs  Donohoe to find some dry things for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mere fact of his refusing a lift showed that there was some  hostility between himself and Hugh Gordon; but the priest, who had climbed into  the Kuryong vehicle as a matter of course, settled the matter off-hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in the trap,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Get in the trap, man. What&rsquo;s the use  for two of ye to ride the mail horses, and get your death o&rsquo; cold? Get in the  trap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll give you a lift,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Jump in, and let us  get away before you all get colds. What will you do about the coach and the  luggage, Pat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll borry them two old draught horses from Martin Donohoe, and  they&rsquo;ll haul it out. Bedad, some o&rsquo; that luggage&rsquo;ll be washed down to the Murrumbidgee before night; but the most of it is strapped  on. Push along, Mr Gordon, and tell Martin I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With some reluctance Blake got into the waggonette; before long  they were at Donohoe&rsquo;s Hotel, and Mary Grant was soon rigged out in an outfit  from Mrs Donohoe&rsquo;s best clothes&mdash;a pale-green linsey bodice and purple  skirt&mdash;everything, including Mrs Donohoe&rsquo;s boots, being about four sizes too  big. But she looked by no means an unattractive little figure, with her brown  eyes and healthy colour showing above the shapeless garments.</p>
<p>She came into the little sitting-room laughing at the figure she  cut, sat down, and drank scalding tea, and ate Mrs Donohoe&rsquo;s cakes, while  talking with Father Kelly and Blake over the great adventure. When she was  ready to start she got into the waggonette alongside Hugh, and waved good-bye  to the priest and Blake and Mrs Donohoe, as though they were old friends. She  had had her first touch of colonial experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
</b><b>Mr. Blake&rsquo;s Relations</b></h2>
<p>As soon as Hugh got his team swinging along at a steady ten miles  an hour on the mountain road, Mary Grant opened the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Gordon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who is Mr Blake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the lawyer from Tarrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. Mrs Connellan called him the &lsquo;lier&rsquo;. But I thought  you didn&rsquo;t seem to like him. Isn&rsquo;t he nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. His father was a gentleman&mdash;the police magistrate up  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, why don&rsquo;t you like him? Is there anything wrong about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh straightened his leaders and steadied the vehicle over a  little gully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong about him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;only&mdash;his mother was  one of the Donohoes&mdash;not a lady, you know&mdash;and he always goes with those people;  and, of course, that means he doesn&rsquo;t go much with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, they&rsquo;re selectors, and they look on the station  people as&mdash;well, rather against them, you know&mdash;sort of enemies&mdash;and he has never  come to the station. But there is no reason why he shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saved my life,&rdquo; said Mary Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly he did,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say that for Blake, he fears  nothing. One of the pluckiest men alive. And how did you feel? Were you much  frightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, horribly. I have often wondered whether I should be brave,  you know, and now I don&rsquo;t think I am. Not the least bit. But Mr Blake seemed so  strong&mdash;directly he caught hold of me I felt quite safe, somehow. If you don&rsquo;t  mind, I would like to ask him out to the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Miss Grant. My mother will only be too glad. She was  sorry that we did not get down to meet you. The letter was delayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Grant laughed as she looked down at Mrs Donohoe&rsquo;s clothes.  &ldquo;What a sight I am!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But, after all, it&rsquo;s Australia, isn&rsquo;t it? And I have had  such adventures already! You know you will have to show me all about the  station and the sheep and cattle. Will you do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh thought there was nothing in the world he would like better,  but contented himself with a formal offer to teach her the noble art of  squatting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must begin at once and tell me things. What estate are we on  now?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your father&rsquo;s station. All you can see around belongs to  him; but after the next gate we come on some land held by selectors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hugh, a little awkwardly, &ldquo;they are relations of Mr  Blake&rsquo;s. You&rsquo;ll see what an Australian farmer&rsquo;s homestead is like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove through a rickety wire-and-sapling gate and across  about a mile of bush, and suddenly came on a little slab house nestling under  the side of a hill. At the back were the stockyards and the killing-pen, where  a contrivance for raising dead cattle&mdash;called a gallows&mdash;waved its arms to the  sky. In front of the house there was rather a nice little garden. At the back  were a lot of dilapidated sheds, leaning in all directions. A mob of sheep was  penned in a yard outside one of the sheds; and in the garden an old woman,  white-haired and wrinkled, with a very short dress showing a lot of dirty  stocking and slipshod elastic-sided boot, was bending over a spade, digging  potatoes.</p>
<p>The old woman straightened herself as they drove up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good daah to you, Misther Cordon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Good daah to you,  Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs Doyle,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Hard work that, this weather.  How&rsquo;s all the family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mag&mdash;Marg&rsquo;rut, I mane&mdash;she&rsquo;s inside. That&rsquo;s her playin&rsquo; the pianny.  She just got it up from Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s shearin&rsquo; the sheep. He&rsquo;s in that shed there beyant. He&rsquo;s  the only shearer we have, so we tell him he&rsquo;s the ringer of the shed. He works  terr&rsquo;ble hard, does Peter. He&rsquo;s not&mdash;&rdquo; and the old woman dropped her voice&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s  not all there in the head, is Peter, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s Mick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mick, bad scran to him! He&rsquo;s bought a jumpin&rsquo; haarse (horse), and  he&rsquo;s gone to hell leppin! Down at one of the shows he is, some place. He has  too much sense to work, has Mick. Won&rsquo;t you come in and have a cup of tay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we must get on, thank you,&rdquo; and Hugh and Mary drove off,  watched by the old lady and the lankylegged, shock-headed youth&mdash;Peter  himself&mdash;who came to the door of the big shed to stare at them.</p>
<p>As they drove off Hugh was silent, wondering what effect the sight  of the selectors might have had on Miss Grant.</p>
<p>She seemed to read his thoughts, and after a little while she  spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So those are Mr Blake&rsquo;s poor relations, are they? Well, that is  not his fault. My father was poor once, just as poor as those people are. And  Mr Blake saved my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh felt that she was half-consciously putting him in the wrong  for having more or less disapproved of Mr Blake; so he kept silence.</p>
<p>As the team bore them along at a flying trot, they climbed higher  and higher up the range; at last, as they rounded a shoulder of the hillside,  the whole valley   of Kiley&rsquo;s River lay  beneath them, stretching away to the far blue foothills. Beyond again was a  great mountain, its top streaked with snow. At their feet was a gorgeous scheme  of colour, greens and greys of the grass, bright tints of willow and poplar,  and the speckled forms of the cattle, so far down that they looked like pigmy  stock feeding in fairy paddocks. Across the valley there came now and again,  softened by distance, the song of the river; and up in the river-bend, on a  spur of the hills, were white walls rising from clustered greenery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; said the girl, half standing up in the  waggonette, &ldquo;and is that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Kuryong, Miss Grant. Your home station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  At the Homestead</b></h2>
<p>Miss Grant&rsquo;s arrival at Kuryong  homestead caused great excitement among the inhabitants. Mrs Gordon received  her in a motherly way, trying hard not to feel that a new mistress had come into  the house; she was anxious to see whether the girl exhibited any signs of her  father&rsquo;s fiery temper and imperious disposition. The two servant-girls at the  homestead&mdash;great herculean, good-natured bush girls, daughters of a  boundary-rider, whose highest ideal of style and refinement was Kuryong  drawing-room&mdash;breathed hard and stared round-eyed, like wild fillies, at the  unconscious intruder. The station-hands&mdash;Joe the wood-and-water boy, old Alfred  the groom, Bill the horse-team driver, and Harry Warden the married man, who  helped with sheep, mended fences, and did station-work in general&mdash;all watched  for a sight of her. They exchanged opinions about her over their smoke at night  by the huge open fireplace in the men&rsquo;s hut, where they sat in a semicircle, toasting  their shins at the blaze till their trousers smoked again, each man with a pipe  of black tobacco going full swing from tea till bed-time. But the person who  felt the most intense excitement over the arrival of the heiress was Miss  Harriott. </p>
<p>For all her nurse&rsquo;s experience, Ellen Harriott was not a woman of  the world. Except for the period of her hospital training, she had passed all  her life shut up among the mountains. Her dream-world was mostly constructed  out of high-class novels, and she united a shrewd wit and a clever brain to a  dense ignorance of the real world, that left her like a ship without a rudder.  She was, like most bush-reared girls, a great visionary&mdash;many a  castle-in-the-air had she built while taking her daily walk by the river under the  drooping willows. The visions, curiously enough, always took the direction of  magnificence. She pictured herself as a leader of society, covered with  diamonds, standing at the head of a broad marble staircase and receiving Counts  by the dozen (<i>vide</i>&nbsp;Ouida&rsquo;s novels, read by stealth); or else as a  rich man&rsquo;s wife who dispensed hospitality regally, and was presented at Court,  and set the fashion in dress and jewels. At the back of all her dreams there  was always a man&mdash;a girl&rsquo;s picture is never complete without a man&mdash;a strong,  masterful man, whose will should crush down opposition, and whose abilities  should make his name&mdash;and incidentally her name&mdash;famous all over the world. She  herself, of course, was always the foremost figure, the handsomest woman, the  best-dressed, the most admired; for Ellen Harriott, though only a girl, and a  friendless governess at Kuryong, was not inclined to put herself second to  anyone. Having learnt from her father&rsquo;s papers that he was of an old family,  she considered herself anybody&rsquo;s equal. Her brain held a crazy enough jumble of  ideas, no doubt; but given a strong imagination, no experience, and omnivorous  reading, a young girl&rsquo;s mind is exactly the place where fantastic ideas will  breed and multiply. She went about with Mrs Gordon to the small festivities of  the district, and was welcomed everywhere, and deferred to by the local  settlers; she had yet to know what a snub meant; so the world to her seemed a  very easy sort of place to get along in. The coming of the heiress was as light  over a trackless ocean. Here was someone who had seen, known, and done all the  things which she herself wished to see, know, and do; someone who had travelled  on the Continent, tobogganed in Switzerland, ridden in Rotten Row, voyaged in  private yachts, hunted in the shires; here was the world at last come to her  door&mdash;the world of which she had read so much and knew so little.</p>
<p>On the second morning after Miss Grant&rsquo;s arrival, that young lady  turned up at breakfast in a tailormade suit with short skirt and heavy boots,  and announced her intention of &ldquo;walking round the estate&rdquo;; but as  Kuryong&mdash;though only a small station, as stations go&mdash;was, roughly, ten miles  square, this project had to be abandoned. Then she asked Hugh if he would have  the servants mustered. He told her that the two servants were in the kitchen,  but it turned out that she wanted to interview all the station-hands, and it  had to be explained that the horse-driver was six miles out on the run with his  team, drawing in a load of bark to roof the hay shed, and that Harry Warden was  down at the drafting yards, putting in a new trough to hold an arsenical  solution, through which the sheep had to tramp to cure their feet; and that  everybody else was away out on some business or other. But the young lady stuck  to her point, and had the groom and the wood-and-water boy paraded, they being  the only two available. The groom was an English importation, and earned her  approval by standing in a rigid and deferential attitude, and saying &ldquo;Yes,  Miss,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No, Miss,&rdquo; when spoken to; but the wood-and-water boy stood with  his arms akimbo and his mouth open, and when she asked him how he liked being  on the station he said, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not too bad,&rdquo; accompanying his remark with a  sickly grin that nearly earned him summary dismissal.</p>
<p>The young lady returned to the house in rather a sharp temper, and  found Hugh standing by a cart, which had just got back with her shipwrecked  luggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Grant,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the things are pretty right. The  water went down in an hour or so, and the luggage on the top only got a little  wetting&mdash;just a wave now and again. How have you been getting on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all well,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand the people  here. I will get you to take me round before I do another thing. It is so  different from England.  Are you sure my clothes are all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be sure, of course, but you can unpack them as soon as  you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long before the various boxes were opened. Ellen  Harriott was called in to assist, and the two girls had a real good afternoon,  looking at and talking over clothes and jewellery. The things had come fairly  well out of the coach disaster. When an English firm makes a water-tight cover  for a bag or box, it is water-tight; even the waters of Kiley&rsquo;s River had swept  over the canvas of Miss Grant&rsquo;s luggage in vain. And when the sacred boxes were  opened, what a treasure-trove was unveiled!</p>
<p>The noblest study of mankind is man, but the most fascinating  study of womankind is another woman&rsquo;s wardrobe, and the Australian girl found  something to marvel at in the quality of the visitor&rsquo;s apparel. Dainty shoes,  tailor-made jackets, fashionable short riding-habits, mannish-looking  riding-boots, silk undergarments, beautiful jewellery; all were taken out of  their packages and duly admired. As each successive treasure was produced,  Ellen Harriott&rsquo;s eyes grew rounder with astonishment; and when, out of a  travelling bag, there appeared a complete dressing-table outfit of  silverware&mdash;silver-backed hair-brushes, silver manicure set, silver handglass,  and so forth&mdash;she drew a long breath of wonder and admiration.</p>
<p>It was her first sight of the vanities of the world, the things  that she had only dreamed of. The outfit was not anything extraordinary from an  English point of view, but to the bush-bred girl it was a revelation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What beautiful things!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now, when you go visiting to a  country-house in England,  do you always take things like these, all these riding-boots and things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. You wouldn&rsquo;t ride without them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you take a maid to look after them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you must have a maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you travel on the Continent, do you always take a maid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always took one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Paris  like? Isn&rsquo;t it just a dream? Did you go to the opera?&mdash;Have you been on the Riviera?&mdash; Oh, do tell me about those places&mdash;is it like  you read about in books?&mdash;all beautiful, well-dressed women and men with nothing  to do&mdash;and did you go to Monte Carlo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all poured out in a rush of words; but in Mary&rsquo;s  experience the Continent was merely a place where the Continentals got the  better of the English, and she said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travelling is so mixed up with discomfort, that it loses half its  plumage,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all I can about Paris some other time. Now you tell me,&rdquo; she  went on, folding carefully a silk blouse and putting it in a drawer, &ldquo;are there  any neighbours here? Will anyone come to call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll find it very dull here,&rdquo; said Ellen. &ldquo;There are  no neighbours at all except Poss and Binjie, two young fellows on the next station.  The people in town are just the publicans and the storekeeper, and all the  selectors around us are a very wild lot. Very few strangers come that we can  have in the house. They are nearly all cattle and sheep buyers, and they are  either too nervous to say a word, or they talk horses. They always come just  after mealtime, too, and we have to get everything laid on the table  again&mdash;sometimes we have ten meals a day in this house. And the swagmen come all  day long, and Mrs Gordon or I have to go and give them something to eat;  there&rsquo;s plenty to do, always. So you see, there are plenty of strangers, but no  neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Mr Blake?&rdquo; said Miss Grant. &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t he a neighbour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would have needed a much quicker eye than Mary&rsquo;s to catch the  half-involuntary movement Ellen Harriott made when Blake&rsquo;s name was mentioned.  She flashed a look of inquiry at the heiress that seemed to say, &ldquo;What interest  do you take in Mr Blake? What is he to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the long eyelashes shut down over the dark eyes again, and  with an air of indifference she said, &ldquo;Oh, Mr Blake? Of course I know him. I  dance with him sometimes at the show balls, and all that. I have been out for a  ride with him, too. I think he&rsquo;s nice, but Hugh and Mrs Gordon won&rsquo;t ask him  here because he belongs to the selectors, and his mother was a Miss Donohoe. He  takes up their cases&mdash;and wins them, too. But he never comes here. He always  stays down at the hotel when he comes out this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to ask him here,&rdquo; said Miss Grant. &ldquo;He saved my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the long eyelashes dropped to hide the sparkle of the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, if you like to ask him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;d come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure he would. If you like to write and ask him, Peter  could ride down to Donohoe&rsquo;s today with a note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From which it would seem that one, at any rate, of the Kuryong  household was not wholly indifferent to Mr Blake.</p>

  Some Visitors</b></h2>
<p>After breakfast next morning  Mary decided to spend the day in the company of the children, who were having  holidays. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well for you to learn the house first,&rdquo; said Hugh,  &ldquo;before you tackle the property. The youngsters know where everything is&mdash;within  four miles, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two little girls were impressed, and were told to take Miss Grant  round and show her the way about the place; and they set off together in the  bright morning sunlight, on a trip of exploration. Now, no true Australian,  young or old, ever takes any trouble or undergoes any exertion or goes anywhere  without an object in view. So the children considered it the height of  stupidity to walk simply for the sake of walking, and kept asking where they  were to walk to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we see if we go along this road?&rdquo; asked Miss Grant,  pointing with her dainty parasol along the wheel-track that meandered across  the open flat and lost itself in the timber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said both children together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, what is there up that way?&rdquo; she asked, waving her hand up  towards the foothills and the blue mountains. &ldquo;There must be some pretty  flowers to look at up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let us go into the woods and see if we can&rsquo;t find  something,&rdquo; she said determinedly; and with her reluctant guides she set off,  trudging across the open forest through an interminable vista of gumtrees.</p>
<p>After a while one of the girls said, &ldquo;Hello, there&rsquo;s Poss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grant looked up, and saw through the trees a large and very  frightened bay horse, with a white face. On further inspection, a youth of  about eighteen or twenty was noticed on the horse&rsquo;s back, but he seemed so much  a part of the animal that one might easily overlook him at a first glance. The  horse had stopped at the sight of them, and was visibly affected with terror.</p>
<p>They advanced slowly, and the animal began snorting and sidling  away among the timber, its rider meanwhile urging it forward. Then Emily cried,  &ldquo;Hello, Poss!&rdquo; and the horse gave a snort, wheeled round, jumped a huge fallen  tree, and fled through the timber like a wild thing, with its rider still  apparently glued to its back. In half a second they were out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it? and why does he go away?&rdquo; asked Miss Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Poss,&rdquo; said Emily carelessly. &ldquo;He and Binjie live over at  Dunderalligo. He often comes here. They and their father live over there.  That&rsquo;s a colt he&rsquo;s breaking in. He&rsquo;s very nice. So is Binjie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here he comes again,&rdquo; said Miss Grant, as the horseman  reappeared, riding slowly round them in ever-lessening circles; the colt  meanwhile eyeing them with every aspect of intense dislike and hatred, and  snorting between whiles like a locomotive.</p>
<p>Emily waited till the rider came fairly close, and said, &ldquo;Poss,  this is Miss Grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rider blushed, and lifted his hand to his hat. Fatal error!  For the hundredth-part of a second the horse seemed to cower under him as if  about to sink to the ground, then tucked his head in between his front legs,  and his tail in between the hind ones, forming himself into a kind of circle,  and began a series of gigantic bounds at the rate of about a hundred to the  minute; while in the air above him his rider described a catherine wheel before  he came to earth, landing on his head at Miss Grant&rsquo;s feet. The horse was soon  out of sight, making bounds that would have cleared a house if one had been in  the way. The rider got up, pulled his hat from over his eyes, brushed some mud  off his clothes, and came up to shake hands as if nothing had happened, his  motto apparently being&nbsp;<i>toujours la politesse</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word, can&rsquo;t he buck, Poss!&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;He chucked you  all right, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got a mean advantage,&rdquo; said the young fellow, in a slow drawl.  &ldquo;Makes me look a fair chump, doesn&rsquo;t it, getting chucked before a lady? I&rsquo;ll  take it out of him when I get on him again. How d&rsquo; you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very well, thank you,&rdquo; said Miss Grant. &ldquo;I hope you are not  hurt. What a nasty beast! I wonder you aren&rsquo;t afraid to ride him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t afraid of him, the cow! He can&rsquo;t sling me fair work, not  the best day ever he saw. He can&rsquo;t buck,&rdquo; he added, in tones of the deepest  contempt, &ldquo;and he won&rsquo;t try when I&rsquo;ve got a fair hold of him; only goes at it  underhanded. It&rsquo;s up to me to give him a hidin&rsquo; next time I ride him, I promise  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will he go to?&rdquo; said Miss Grant, looking for the vanished  steed. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t get out of the paddick,&rdquo; drawled the youth. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up  to the house, and get one of the boys to run him in. He had a go-in this  morning with me&mdash;the bit came out of his mouth somehow, and he did get to work  proper. He went round and round the paddick at home, with me on him, buckin&rsquo;  like a brumby. Binjie had to come out with another horse and run me back into  the yard. He&rsquo;s a pretty clever colt, too. The timber is tremendous thick in  that paddick, and he never hit me against anything. Binjie reckons any other  colt&rsquo;d have killed me. Come on up to the house, or he&rsquo;ll have my saddle smashed  before I get him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they hurried home, Miss Grant had a good look at the stranger&mdash;a  pleasant, brown-skinned brown-handed youth, with the down of a black moustache  growing on his upper lip. His frank and open face was easy to read. He looked  with boyish admiration at Miss Grant, who immediately stooped to conquer, and  began an animated conversation about nothing in particular&mdash;a conversation which  was broken in upon by one of the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Binjie?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he coming over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said the youth, with an air of great certainty. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re  busy over at our place, I tell you. The water is all gone in the nine-mile  paddick. Binj an&rsquo; me and Andy Kelly had to muster all the sheep and shift &rsquo;em  across to the home paddick. Binj is musterin&rsquo; away there now. I just rode over  to see Hugh about some of your sheep that&rsquo;s in the river paddick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Binjie be over, then?&rdquo; persisted Emily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course he won&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t I tell you he&rsquo;s got three days&rsquo;  work musterin&rsquo; there? I must be off at daylight tomorrow, home again, or the  old man&rsquo;ll know the reason why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time they had reached the homestead, and Poss went off  with the children to the stables. Here he secured the &ldquo;knockabout&rdquo; horse,  always kept saddled and bridled about the station for generally useful work,  and set off at a swinging canter up the paddock after his own steed. Miss Grant  went in and found Mrs Gordon at her jam-making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and have you found anything to amuse you?&rdquo; asked the old  lady in her soft, even voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve had quite a lot of experiences; and I went for a walk  and met Poss. Who is Poss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady laughed as she gave the jam a stir. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a young  Hunter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Was Binjie there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; and he isn&rsquo;t coming either; he has work to do. I learnt that  much. But who is Poss? And who is Binjie? I&rsquo;m greatly taken with Poss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice-looking young fellow, isn&rsquo;t he? His father has a  small station away among the hills, and Poss and Binjie help him on it. Those  are only nicknames, of course. Poss&rsquo;s name is Arthur, and Binjie&rsquo;s is George, I  think. They&rsquo;re nice young fellows, but very bushified; they have lived here all  their lives. Their father&mdash;well, he isn&rsquo;t very steady; and they like to get over  here when they can, and each tries to come without the other knowing it. Binjie  will be here before long, I expect. They&rsquo;re great admirers of Miss Harriott,  both of them, and they come over on all sorts of ridiculous pretexts. Poor  fellows, it must be very dull for them over there. Fancy, week after week  without seeing anyone but their father, the station-hands, and the sheep! Now  that you&rsquo;re here, I expect they&rsquo;ll come more than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, the tramp of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs was heard in the yard  and, looking out, Miss Grant saw a duplicate of Poss dismounting from a  duplicate of Poss&rsquo;s horse. And Mrs Gordon, looking over her shoulder, said,  &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Binjie. I thought he&rsquo;d be here before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do they call him Binjie?&rdquo; asked Miss Grant, watching the new  arrival tying up his horse. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a blackfellow&rsquo;s word, meaning stomach,&rdquo; said the old lady.  &ldquo;He used to be very fat, and the name stuck to him. Good day, Binjie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, Mrs Cordon. Hugh at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t be back till dark,&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you  let your horse go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know if I can,&rdquo; replied the new arrival  thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left Poss at home clearing the sheep out of that big  paddock at the Crossing. There&rsquo;s five thousand sheep, and no water there; I&rsquo;ll  have to go back and help him. I only came over to tell Hugh there were some of  his weaners in the river paddock. I must go straight back, or Poss&rsquo;ll make a  row. We&rsquo;ve a lot of work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Poss is here,&rdquo; said Mrs Gordon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poss is here, is he? Well, if that don&rsquo;t beat everything! And when  we started to muster that paddock I went to the top, and he went the other way,  and he reckoned to be at it all day. He&rsquo;s a nice fellow, he is! I wonder what  the old man&rsquo;ll say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I expect he won&rsquo;t mind very much. This is Mr George Hunter,  Miss Grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Binjie extended much the same greeting as Poss had done; and by  dinner-time that evening&mdash;or, as it is always called in the bush, tea-time&mdash;they  had all made each other&rsquo;s acquaintance, and both the youths were worshipping at  the new shrine.</p>
<p>At tea the talk flowed freely, and the two bush boys, shy at  first, began to expand as Mary Grant talked to them. Put a pretty girl and a  young and impressionable bushman together, and in the twinkling of an eye you  have a Sir Galahad ready to do anything for the service of his lady.</p>
<p>Light-heartedly they consented to stay the night, in the hope of  seeing Hugh, to deliver their message about the weaners&mdash;they seemed to have  satisfactorily arranged the question of mustering.</p>
<p>And when Miss Grant said, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t your sheep be dying of thirst in  that paddock, where there is no water?&rdquo; both brothers replied, &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be  off at crack of dawn in the morning and fix &rsquo;em up all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They always say that,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;and generally stay  three days. I expect they&rsquo;ll make it four, now that you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  A Lawyer in the Bush</b></h2>
<p>Gavan Blake, attorney and  solicitor, sat in his office at Tarrong, opening his morning&rsquo;s letters. The  office was in a small weatherboard cottage in the &ldquo;main street&rdquo; of Tarrong (at  any rate it might fairly claim to be the main street, as it was the only street  that had any houses in it). The front room, where he sat, was fitted up with a  table and a set of pigeon-holes full of dusty papers, a leather couch, a small  fire-proof safe, and a book-case containing about equal proportions of law  books and novels. A few maps of Tarrong township and neighbouring stations hung  on the walls. The wooden partition of the house only ran up to the rafters, and  over it could plainly be heard his housekeeper scrubbing his bedroom. Across  the little passage was his sitting-room, furnished in the style of most  bachelors&rsquo; rooms, an important item of furniture being a cupboard where whisky  was always to be found. At the back of the main cottage were servants&rsquo; quarters  and kitchen. Behind the house, on a spare allotment, were two or three  loose-boxes for racehorses, a saddle-room and a groom&rsquo;s room. This was the  whole establishment. A woman came in every day to do up his rooms from the  hotel, where he had his meals. It was an inexpensive mode of life, but one that  conduced to the drinking of a good many whiskies-and-sodas at the hotel with  clients and casual callers, and to a good deal of card playing and late hours.  The racehorses, too, like most racehorses, ate up more money than they earned.  So that Mr Gavan Blake, though a clever man, with a good practice, always  seemed to find himself hard up. </p>
<p>It was so on this particular morning. Every letter he opened  seemed to have some reference to money. One, from the local storekeeper, was a  pretentious account embracing all sorts of items&mdash;ammunition, stationery,  saddlery and station supplies (the latter being on account of a small station  that Blake had taken over for a bad debt, which seemed likely to turn out an  equally bad asset). Station supplies, even for bad stations, run into a lot of  money, and the store account was approaching a hundred pounds. Then there was a  letter from a horse-trainer in Sydney to whom he had sent a racehorse, and  though this animal had done such brilliant gallops that the trainer had three  times telegraphed him that a race was a certainty&mdash;once he went so far as to say  that the horse could stop to throw a somersault and still win the race&mdash;on each  occasion it had always come in among the ruck; and every time forty or fifty  pounds of Blake&rsquo;s money had been lost in betting. For Blake was a confirmed  gambler, a heavy card player and backer of horses, and he had the contempt for  other people&rsquo;s skill and opinions which seems an inevitable ingredient in the  character of brilliant men of a certain type.</p>
<p>He was a man of splendid presence, with strong features and clear  blue-grey eyes&mdash;the type of face that is seen on the Bench and among the Queen&rsquo;s  Counsel in the English Courts. He was quick-witted, eloquent, and logical of  mind. Among the Doyles and Donohoes he was little short of a king. Wild,  uneducated, and suspicious, they believed in him implicitly. They swore exactly  the things that he told them to swear, spoke or were silent according as he  ordered, and trusted him with secrets which they would not entrust to their own  brothers. In that district he wielded a power greater than the law.</p>
<p>On this particular day, after opening the trainer&rsquo;s letter asking  for cheque to pay training expenses (&pound;50), and one from a client, saying &ldquo;I got  your note, and will pay you when I get the wool money,&rdquo; he came upon a letter  that startled him. It was written in an old-fashioned, lady&rsquo;s hand, angular and  spidery. It ran&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Kuryong  Station,</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Monday.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dear Mr Blake,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Miss Grant tells me that she owes her life to your bravery in  saving her from the coach accident. It would give me great pleasure if you  would come and stay here next Saturday, as I suppose you will be passing down  this way to the Court at Ballarook. With best wishes,</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours  truly,</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANNETTE&nbsp;GORDON&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake put the letter down and walked about his office for a while  in thought. &ldquo;Invited to the old station?&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;I must go, of course. Too  good a chance to miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have written herself!&rdquo; he muttered, as he turned the letter  over to see if by chance Miss Grant had written a line anywhere; then, laying  it on one side, he took up carelessly a square business-like envelope,  addressed to him in a scrawly, illiterate fist. The letter that he took out of  it was a strange jewel to repose in so rude a casket. It also was from  Kuryong&mdash;from Ellen Harriott, who had taken the precaution of addressing it in a  feigned hand so that the postmaster and postmistress at Kiley&rsquo;s Crossing, who  handled all station letters, would not know that she was corresponding with  Blake. The letter was a great contrast to Mrs Gordon&rsquo;s. It was a girl&rsquo;s love  letter, a gushing, impulsive thing, full of vows and endearments; but the only  part of it with which we are concerned ran in this way:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;And so the heiress has arrived at last&mdash;and you saved her life!  When you swam with her, didn&rsquo;t you feel that you had the weight of a hundred  thousand sovereigns on your back? For oh, Gavan dear, she is nice, but she is  very stolid! And so you saved her&mdash;what luck for you! But you always have luck,  don&rsquo;t you? And don&rsquo;t you think that my love is the best bit of luck you have  ever had! Everyone says you are making a fortune&mdash;hurry up and make it, for I am  so anxious to get away out of this place, and we can have our trip round the  world together.</p>
<p class="note">And now I am waiting for next Saturday. Fancy having you in the  house all day long and in the evening! We must slip away somewhere for just a  little while, so that we can have each other all to ourselves. Hugh is still  worrying about some sheep that he thinks are stolen. He is always worrying  about something or other, and now that she has come I suppose he will be worse  then ever. Now goodnight, dearest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Blake read the letter, and threw it down carelessly on the table;  then, leaning back in his chair, cut up a pipeful of tobacco. He thought over  his position with Ellen Harriott. There was a secret understanding between  them, a sort of informal affair born of moonlight rides and country dances. He  had never actually asked her to marry him, but he had kissed her as he had  kissed scores of others, and the girl had at once taken it for granted that  they were to be engaged. It had not seemed such a bad thing for him at the  time. He was fond of her in a ball-room-and-moonlight-ride kind of way, but  there it stopped. Still, it was not a bad match for him. The girl was a lady,  with friends all over the district. He was rather near the borderline of  respectability, and to marry her would have procured him a position that he had  little chance of reaching otherwise. He had let things drift on, and the girl,  with her fanciful ideas, was, of course, only too ready to fall in with the  suggestion of secrecy; it seemed such a precious secret to her. So now he was  engaged while still up to his neck in debt; but worse remained behind. In his  business he had sums of money for investments and for settlements of cases  passing through his hands; and from time to time he had, when hard pushed,  used his clients&rsquo; money to pay his own debts. Beginning with small sums, he had  muddled along, meaning to make all straight out of the first big case he had;  and each time he had a big case the money seemed to be all spent before he  earned it. He was not exactly bankrupt, for he was owed a great deal of money,  enough perhaps to put him straight if he could get it in; but the mountain folk  expected long credit and large reductions, and it was pretty certain that he  would never get even half of what he was owed. Therefore, he went about his  business with a sort of sword of Damocles hanging over his head&mdash;and now the  heiress had come, and he had saved her life!</p>
<p>His musings were cut short by a tap at the door; a long, gawky  youth, with a budding moustache, entered and slouched over to a chair. He was  young Isaacstein, son of the Tarrong storekeeper, a would-be sportsman,  would-be gambler, would-be lady-killer, would-be everything, who only succeeded  in making himself a cheap bar-room loafer; but he was quite satisfied that he  was the right thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing, Gav?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the letter from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, business&mdash;business,&rdquo; said Cavan Blake. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing with  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing! By Gad, I&rsquo;m broke. The old man won&rsquo;t give me a copper.  What about Saturday? Are you going to the Court at Ballarook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve got a couple of cases there. And I&rsquo;ve just got a letter  from Mrs Gordon, asking me to stay the night at Kuryong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! My oath! Stop at Kuryong, eh? That&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause you saved the  heiress? Well, go in and win. You won&rsquo;t know us when you marry the owner of  Kuryong. What&rsquo;s she like, Gav? Pretty girl, ain&rsquo;t she? Has she any sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much as you have,&rdquo; growled Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t get nasty. Only I thought you were a bit shook on the  governess there&mdash;what about that darnce at the Show ball, eh? I say, you  couldn&rsquo;t lend us a tenner till Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I could not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And this was the literal truth, for Cavan  Blake had run himself right out of money, and was living on credit&mdash;not an  enviable position at any time, and one doubly insupportable to a man of his  temperament. And again his thoughts went back to the girl he had saved, and he  pondered how different things might have been&mdash;might, perhaps, still be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  A Walk in the Moonlight</b></h2>
<p>The court at Ballarook was over,  and Gavan Blake turned his horses&rsquo; heads in a direction he had never taken  before&mdash;along the road to Kuryong. As he drove along, his thoughts were anything  but pleasant. Behind him always stalked the grim spectre of detection and  arrest; and, even should a lucky windfall help to pay his debts, he could not  save the money either to buy a practice in Sydney or to maintain himself while  he was building one up. He thought of the pitiful smallness of his chances at  Tarrong, and then of Ellen Harriott. What should he do about her? Well,  sufficient unto the day was the evil thereof. He would play for his own hand  throughout. With which reflection he drove into the Kuryong yard. </p>
<p>When he drove up, the family had gathered round the fire in the  quaint, old-fashioned, low-ceilinged sitting-room; for the evenings were still  chilly. The children were gravely and quietly sharpening terrific-looking  knives on small stones; the old lady had some needlework, while Mary and Ellen  and Poss and Binjie talked about horses, that being practically the only  subject open to the two boys.</p>
<p>After a time Mrs Gordon said, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sing something?&rdquo; and Mary  sat down to the piano and sang to them. Such singing no one there had ever  heard before. Her deep contralto voice was powerful, flexible, and obviously  well-trained; besides which she had the great natural gift of putting &ldquo;feeling&rdquo;  into her singing. The children sat spellbound. The station-hands and  house-servants, who had been playing the concertina and yarning on the  wood-heap at the back of the kitchen, stole down to the corner of the house to  listen; in the stillness that wonderful voice floated out into the night. So it  chanced that Gavan Blake, arriving, heard the singing, stole softly to the  door, and looked in, listening for a while, before anyone saw him.</p>
<p>The picture he saw was for ever photographed on his mind. He saw  the quiet comfort and luxury&mdash;for after Tarrong it was luxury to him&mdash;of the  station drawing-room; caught the scent of the flowers and the glorious tones of  that beautiful voice; and, as he watched the sweet face of the singer, and  listened to the words of the song, a sudden fierce determination rose in his  mind. He would devote all his energies to winning Mary Grant for his wife;  combative and self-confident as he was by nature, he felt no dismay at the  difficulties in his way. He had been on a borderline long enough. Here was his  chance to rise at a bound, and he determined to succeed if success were humanly  possible.</p>
<p>As the song came to an end, he walked into the drawing-room and  shook hands all round, Mary being particularly warm in her welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very late,&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;Was there much of a Court  at Ballarook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the usual troubles. You know what those courts are. By the  way, Miss Grant, I came over the famous crossing place where we got turned out,  and nearly had another swim for it. Martin Donohoe and his wife haven&rsquo;t yet  finished talking about how wet you looked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I haven&rsquo;t finished thinking about it. I don&rsquo;t suppose  you had to swim with anyone on your back this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck, I&rsquo;m sorry to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very lucky, indeed&mdash;that you were there,&rdquo; put in Miss  Harriott. &ldquo;You are really quite the district hero, Mr Blake. You will have to  save somebody next, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word,&rdquo; said Poss, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen Hugh swim in to fetch a sheep,  let alone a lady. You remember, Hugh, the time those old ewes got swept down  and one of &rsquo;em was caught on the head of a tree, and you went in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind about that,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Did Pat Donohoe lose  anything out of the coach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a side of bacon and a bottle of whisky. The whisky was for  old Ned the possum trapper, and they say that Ned walked fourteen miles down  the river in hopes that it might have come ashore. Ned reckons he has never  done any tracking, but if he could track anything it would be whisky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about going out after possums down the garden?&rdquo; said Binjie.  &ldquo;Now, you youngsters, where are your possum dogs? I think they ought to get  some in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone seemed to welcome the idea. There had been a sort of  stiffness in the talk, and Gavan Blake felt that a walk in the moonlight might  give him a chance to make himself a little more at home with Mary Grant, while  Ellen Harriott had her own reasons for wanting to get him outside. With laughter  and haste they all put on hats and coats, for it had turned bitterly cold; then  with ear-piercing whistles the children summoned their possuming dogs, who were  dreaming happy hours away in all sorts of odd nooks, in chimney-corners, under  the table in the kitchen, under the bunks in the men&rsquo;s huts, anywhere warm and  undisturbed. But at the whistles each dog dashed out from his nook, tearing  over everything in front of him in his haste not to be left behind; and in  three seconds half a dozen of them were whining and jumping round the children,  waiting for orders which way to go.</p>
<p>A majestic wave of the hand, and the order &ldquo;Go and find him!&rdquo; from  the eldest of the children, sent a hurricane of dogs yapping with excitement  off to the creek, and the hunters followed at a brisk run. Gavan Blake and Mary  Grant trotted along together in the bright moonlight. Just in front were Ellen  and Hugh, he laughing at the excitement of the dogs and children, she looking  over her shoulder and hoping to hear what Blake was saying to the heiress. As a  matter of fact, he was making the most of his chances, and before long they  were getting on capitally. Mary found herself laying aside her slow English  way, and laughing and joking with the rest. There is something intoxicating in  moonlight at any time; and what with the moon and the climate, and the breeze  whistling through the gum-bough, it was no wonder that even the staidly-reared  English girl felt a thrill of excitement, a stirring of the primeval instincts  that civilisation and cultivation had not quite been able to choke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you go back to England, Miss Grant,&rdquo; said Blake,  &ldquo;you will be able to tell them that you have hunted possums, anyhow. That will  sound like the real bush, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I can say I have been upset in a river and nearly  drowned, too. I&rsquo;m becoming quite an experienced person. But what makes you  think I shall go back to England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would be sure to go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. We have no friends in England at all. My mother&rsquo;s people  are nearly all living in India,  and father wouldn&rsquo;t live in England.  He hates it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you like Australia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only seen about a week of it. Do you know, it seems to me a  more serious life than in England.  Look at Mrs Gordon, what a lot of people she has dependent on her. The  station-hands and their wives, all come to her. In England she might visit them and  give them tracts and blankets, but here what they want is advice and help in  all sorts of things. You know what I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She is a fine old lady, isn&rsquo;t she? A real character. You  will be sure to like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I think I shall be very happy here. Father is anxious I  should like this place, as he may come up here to live, and I&rsquo;m sure I shall  like it. You see, there is work to do here. Miss Harriott and Mrs Gordon are at  work from daylight till dark; what with the children, the house, the store and  visitors, there really isn&rsquo;t time to feel lonely. Don&rsquo;t you think people are  much happier when they have a lot to do? Do you live&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live in two rooms and get my meals at an hotel, Miss Grant. I  have never had any home life. I never knew what it meant till now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come out again when you are down this way. The &mdash; what&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dog barked furiously in the distance, and the others rushed to  join him from all directions, yelping and squealing with excitement. The whole  party set off at a run, amid cheers and laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, what is it?&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the dogs has found a possum up a tree, and the children  will try to get him down. Come on! Mind where you go. The black shadows are  very hard to judge, and sometimes a log or a bush is hidden in them. There goes  Poss over a log,&rdquo; he added, in explanation of a terrific crash and a shout of  laughter from the others. &ldquo;What is it, Emily?&rdquo; he asked as one of the children  ran past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Thomas Carlyle has found one,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and he never barks  when the possums are up big trees. He knows we can&rsquo;t get them then, so he only  looks in the saplings. The other dogs find them in the big trees, but that&rsquo;s no  good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp run brought the party to the foot of a small tree,  surrounded by a circle of dogs, all sitting on their tails and staring with  whimpers of anxiety up to the topmost branches, where a small furry animal was  perched. Mary Grant, under Blake&rsquo;s directions, got the animal silhouetted  against the moon, and saw clearly enough the sharp nose, round ears, plump  body, and prehensile tail of the unfortunate creature who, as Poss said, looked  as if he were wishing for a pair of wings.</p>
<p>Blake turned to Mary. &ldquo;Do you want to stop and see it killed?&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a murderous business. The possum has no chance. One of the  boys will go up the tree and shake the branch till the possum falls off, and  when it falls the dogs will kill it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I would like to see it. I have seen so many  things killed since I came here. Let us walk back towards the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Gordon. Gordon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Miss Grant doesn&rsquo;t care to  see the massacre. We will walk back towards the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen Harriott made a sudden step forward. &ldquo;I will go back too,&rdquo;  she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Miss Harriott!&rdquo; said Poss in astonishment, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen lots  of &rsquo;em killed. Native cats, too. Watch me knock him out of that with a stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;ll go back, too. I don&rsquo;t feel like killing anything  tonight. You come back too, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the four walked back together, and as Blake had monopolised  Mary on the way out, she now put herself beside Hugh, and the others walked  behind. Hugh and Mary soon began to talk, but the other pair walked in silence  for a while. Then Ellen Harriott said in a low voice, &ldquo;Go a little slower,  Gavan. Let them get away.&rdquo; As they passed under the dense shadows of a huge  wild-apple tree, Ellen stopped and, turning to Blake, held up her face to be  kissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gavan, Gavan!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was wondering when I would ever get a  chance to speak to you. To think of you being here in the same house with me!  It&rsquo;s too wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gavan Blake kissed her. It was almost an effort to him at first,  as his mind and heart were on fire with the thoughts of the other girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, my darling!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All the while you were  walking with that girl, I knew you were dying to come and kiss me!&rdquo; For such is  the faith of women.</p>
<p>They stopped for a little while, and then moved on after the  others, pausing now and again in the shadows. The girl poured out all her  artless tale&mdash;how she had been awake night after night, waiting for the day he  should come. Then she told him how the heiress had praised his pluck and  strength. &ldquo;And oh! Gavan, I was so proud, I could have hugged her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus she rattled on, while he, because it was his nature, found it  no trouble to reply in kind, with a good imitation of sincerity. On such a  night, with such a girl clinging to him, it would have been a very poor  specimen of a man who could not have trumped up a sort of enthusiasm. But in  his heart he was cursing his luck that just as chance had thrown the heiress in  his way, and put her under an obligation to him, he was held to his old  bargain&mdash;the bargain that he had made for position&rsquo;s sake, and which he would  now have liked to break for the same reason.</p>
<p>It would be wearisome to record their talk, all the way up to the  house. The girl&mdash;impetuous, hotblooded, excitable&mdash;poured out her love-talk like  a bird singing. Happiness complete was hers for the time; but Gavan&rsquo;s heart was  not in the wooing, and he listened and was silent.</p>
<p>Hugh and Mary, walking on ahead, knew nothing of the love scenes  just behind them. They talked of many things, of the moonlight and the river  and the scent of the flowers, but all the time Hugh felt diffident and  tongue-tied. He had not the glib tongue of Gavan Blake, and he felt little at  ease talking common-places. Mary Grant thought he must be worried over  something, and, with her usual directness, went to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are worrying over something,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not because I asked Mr Blake here, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no! Goodness, no! Why he is fifty times better than most of  the people that come here. It just happens we had never asked him before. I  think he is a very nice fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that. I have asked him to come out again. He seems to  know Miss Harriott quite well, though he doesn&rsquo;t know your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he met Miss Harriott at some of the race-balls, I think. She  is a queer girl, full of fancies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems a very quiet sort of girl to me,&rdquo; said Miss Grant. But  if she could have known what was going on about two hundred yards behind her,  she might have altered her opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Mr. Blake Breaks His Engagement</b></h2>
<p>On Monday, Hugh, Poss, and  Binjie had to go out to an outlying paddock to draft a lot of station-sheep  from a mob of travelling-sheep, As this meant a long, hard job, the three  breakfasted by candlelight&mdash;a good old fashion, this, but rather forgotten  lately&mdash;and Blake also turned out for early breakfast, as he wanted to get his  drive to Tarrong over while the weather was cool. Of the women-folk, Ellen  alone was up, boiling eggs, and making tea on a spirit-lamp; laughing and  chattering meanwhile, and keeping them all amused; while outside in the frosty  dawn, the stable boy shivered as he tightened the girths round the ribs of  three very touchy horses. Poss and Binjie were each riding a station horse to  &ldquo;take the flashness out of him&rdquo;, and Binjie&rsquo;s horse tried to buck him off, but  might as well have tried to shed his own skin; so he bolted instead, and  disappeared with a snort and a rattle of hoofs over the hill. The others  followed, with their horses very much inclined to go through the same  performance. </p>
<p>After they had gone, Ellen Harriott and Blake were left alone in  the breakfast-room. Outside, the heedless horse-boy was harnessing Blake&rsquo;s  ponies; but inside no one but themselves was awake, and as he finished his  breakfast, Ellen stepped up to the table and blew out the two candles, leaving  the room in semi-darkness. She caught his hand, and he drew her to him. It was  what she had been waiting for all night. She had pictured a parting, which was  to be such sweet sorrow. Blake had also pictured it, but in quite a different  way.</p>
<p>He was determined to make an end of his engagement (or  entanglement, whichever it could be called), and yet when the chance came he  almost put it off; but the thought of what exposure and disgrace would mean, if  his affairs were investigated, drove him on.</p>
<p>He stroked her hair for a while in silence, and then, with a  laugh, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to give up this sort of thing, you know; it&rsquo;ll be  getting you talked about, and that&rsquo;ll never do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hardly knew what he meant. Having lived so long in a fool&rsquo;s  paradise, she could not realise that her world was coming down about her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be proper in future,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the most  fiendish run of bad luck lately, and it&rsquo;s just as well there never was any engagement  between us. It would have had to come to nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew back, and looked at him with frightened eyes. He had  great power over her&mdash;this big, masterful man, whom she had looked upon as her  lover; and she could not believe that a little trouble about money could really  make any difference to him. She believed him able to overcome any such  difficulty as that of earning a living for her and himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Gavan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done, little girl? You&rsquo;ve done nothing. It&rsquo;s all my fault. I&rsquo;ve  lost heart over things lately, and it will only harm you if we keep up this  pretence of being engaged. Nothing can come of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Why can&rsquo;t we wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! To be stuck in Tarrong all my life among these people, and  up to my neck in debt! No, little woman, as soon as ever I can get things  squared up, I&rsquo;m off out of this, and I dare say we&rsquo;ll never see each other  again. I&rsquo;ve made a mess of things here, and I&rsquo;m off somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed almost incredible to her that a man could so throw up  the fight; and then a thought flashed into her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not because Miss Grant has come that you do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed with a well-simulated indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Grant!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have only seen her twice&mdash;that day on the  coach and last night.&rdquo; She seemed to study the question, still holding his  hands, and looking up into his face. The light in the room was stronger, and  there were sounds as if some of the household were stirring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we must say &lsquo;goodbye!&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just because you are short  of money. Gavan, I would have thought more of you had you told me you were  tired of me and were going in for the other girl. I think I could have  respected you at any rate; but to sneak out on the story of not being able to  afford it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face darkened, and he began to speak, but she stopped him, and  went on in a passionless sort of voice. &ldquo;Someone is coming,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and we  must say goodbye; and since you wish it, it is &lsquo;goodbye&rsquo;. But I&rsquo;m not a child,  to change my fancies in a day, so I won&rsquo;t promise to forget. And I think you  have treated me very badly, so neither will I promise to forgive. I had set my  heart on you, Gavan. You seemed to me&mdash;but there, it&rsquo;s no use talking. I suppose  I should be meek and mild, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Ellen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t interrupt me. It is the last talk together we shall  have. I suppose I can go governessing, or nursing, to the end of the chapter.  It seems a dreary outlook, doesn&rsquo;t it? Now go, and remember that I do not  forgive easily. I had built such castles, Gavan, and now&mdash;&rdquo; She slipped quietly  from the room, and was gone.</p>
<p>Gavan Blake drove home, feeling a trifle uneasy. He had expected  some sort of outburst, but the curious way in which she had taken it rather  nonplussed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t stick a knife in herself, I suppose,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Just  like her to do something unusual. Anyway, she has too much pride to talk about  it&mdash;and the affair had to come to an end sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And feeling that if not &ldquo;on with the new love&rdquo;, he was, at any  rate, satisfactorily &ldquo;off with the old&rdquo;. Blake drove his spanking ponies off to  Tarrong, while Ellen Harriott went about her household work with a face as  inscrutable and calm as though no stone had ruffled the millpond of her  existence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  The Rivals</b></h2>
<p>For the next couple of weeks,  affairs at Kuryong flowed on in usual station style. A saddle-horse was brought  in for Miss Grant, and out of her numerous boxes that young lady produced a Bond Street outfit  that fairly silenced criticism. She rode well too, having been taught in  England, and she, Poss, Binjie and Hugh had some great scampers after  kangaroos, half-wild horses, or anything else that would get up and run in  front of them. She was always so fresh, cheerful, and ready for any excitement  that the two boys became infatuated in four days, and had to be hunted home on  the fifth, or they would have both proposed. Some days she spent at the  homestead housekeeping, cooking, and giving out rations to swagmen&mdash;the wild,  half-crazed travellers who came in at sundown for the dole of flour, tea and  sugar, which was theirs by bush custom. Some days she spent with the children,  and with them learnt a lot of bush life. It being holiday-time, they  practically ran wild all over the place, spending whole days in long tramps to  remote parts in pursuit of game. They had no &ldquo;play&rdquo;, as that term is known to  English children. They didn&rsquo;t play at being hunters. They were hunters in real  earnest, and their habits and customs had come to resemble very closely those  of savage tribes that live by the chase. </p>
<p>With them Mary had numberless new experiences. She got accustomed  to seeing the boys climb big trees by cutting steps in the bark with a  tomahawk, going out on the most giddy heights after birds&rsquo; nests, or dragging  the possum from his sleeping-place in a hollow limb. She learned to hold a  frenzied fox terrier at the mouth of a hollow log, ready to pounce on the  kangaroo rat which had taken refuge there, and which flashed out as if shot  from a catapult on being poked from the other end with a long stick. She  learned to mark the hiding-place of the young wild ducks that scuttled and  dived, and hid themselves with such super-natural cunning in the reedy pools.  She saw the native companions, those great, solemn, grey birds, go through  their fantastic and intricate dances, forming squares, pirouetting, advancing,  and retreating with the solemnity of professional dancing-masters. She lay on  the riverbank with the children, gun in hand, breathless with excitement,  waiting for the rising of the duck-billed platypus&mdash;that quaint combination of  fish, flesh and fowl&mdash;as he dived in the quiet waters, a train of small bubbles  marking his track. She fished in deep pools for the great, sleepy,  hundred-pound cod-fish that sucked down bait and hook,&nbsp;<i>holus-bolus</i>,  and then were hauled in with hardly any resistance, and lived for days  contentedly, tethered to the bank by a line through their gills.</p>
<p>In these amusements time passed pleasantly enough, and by the time  school-work was resumed Mary Grant had become one of the family.</p>
<p>Of Hugh she at first saw little. His work took him out on the run  all day long, looking after sheep in the paddocks, or perhaps toiling day after  day in the great, dusty drafting-yards. In the cool of the afternoon the two  girls would often canter over the four miles or so of timbered country to the  yards, and wait till Hugh had finished his day&rsquo;s work. As a rule, Poss or  Binjie, perhaps both, were in attendance to escort Miss Harriott, with the  result that Hugh and Mary found themselves paired off to ride home together.  Before long he found himself looking forward to these rides with more anxiety  than he cared to acknowledge, and in a very short time he was head over ears in  love with her.</p>
<p>Any man, being much alone with any woman in a country house, will  fall in love with her; but a man such as Hugh Cordon, ardent, imaginative, and  very young, meeting every day a woman as beautiful as Mary Grant, was bound to  fall a victim. He soon became her absolute worshipper. All day long, in the  lonely rides through the bush, in the hot and dusty hours at the sheep-yards,  through the pleasant, lazy canter home in the cool of the evening, his fancies  were full of her&mdash;her beauty and her charm. It was happiness enough for him to  be near her, to feel the soft touch of her hand, to catch the faint scent that  seemed to linger in her hair. After the day&rsquo;s work they would stroll together  about the wonderful old garden, and watch the sunlight die away on the western  hills, and the long strings of wild fowl hurrying down the river to their  nightly haunts. Sometimes he would manage to get home for lunch, and  afterwards, on the pretext of showing her the run, would saddle a horse for  her, and off they would go for a long ride through the mountains. Or there were  sheep to inspect, or fences to look at&mdash;an excuse for an excursion was never  lacking.</p>
<p>For the present he made no sign; he was quite contented to act as  confidant and adviser, and many a long talk they had together over the various  troubles that beset the manager of a station.</p>
<p>It would hardly be supposed that a girl could give much advice on  such matters, and at first her total ignorance of the various difficulties  amused him; but when she came to understand them better, her cool common-sense  compelled his admiration. His temperament was nervous and excitable, and he let  things fret him. She took everything in a cheery spirit, and laughed him out of  his worries. One would not expect to find many troubles in rearing sheep and  selling their wool; but the management of any big station is a heavy task, and Kuryong  would have driven Job mad.</p>
<p>The sheep themselves, to begin with, seem always in league against  their owners. Merinos, though apparently estimable animals, are in reality  dangerous monomaniacs, whose sole desire is to ruin the man that owns them.  Their object is to die, and to do so with as much trouble to their owners as  they possibly can. They die in the droughts when the grass, roasted to a dull  white by the sun, comes out by the roots and blows about the bare paddocks;  they die in the wet, when the long grass in the sodden gullies breeds &ldquo;fluke&rdquo;  and &ldquo;bottle&rdquo; and all sorts of hideous complaints. They get burnt in bush fires  from sheer malice, refusing to run in any given direction, but charging round  and round in a ring till they are calcined. They get drowned by refusing to  leave flooded country, though hunted with frenzied earnestness. It was not the  sheep so much as the neighbours whose depredations were drawing lines on Hugh  Gordon&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he confided to Miss Grant, &ldquo;if they only took  a beast or two. But the sheep are going by hundreds. We mustered five hundred  short in one paddock this month. And there isn&rsquo;t a Doyle or a Donohoe cow but  has three calves at least, and two of each three belong to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dared not prosecute them. No local jury would convict in face  of the hostility that would be aroused. They had made &ldquo;alibis&rdquo; a special study;  the very judges were staggered by the calmness and plausibility with which they  got themselves out of difficulties.</p>
<p>A big station with a lot of hostile neighbours is like a whale  with the killers round it; it is open to attack on all sides, and cannot  retaliate. A match dropped carelessly in a patch of grass sets miles of country  in a blaze. Hugh, as he missed the stock, and saw fences cut and grass burnt,  could only grind his teeth and hope that a lucky chance would put some of the  enemy in his power. To Mary it seemed incredible that in the nineteenth century  people should be able to steal sheep without suffering for it; and Hugh soon  saw that she was a true daughter of William Grant, as far as fighting was  concerned. She listened with set teeth to all stories of depredation and  trespass, and they talked over many a plan together. But though they became  quite friendly their intimacy seemed to make no progress. To her he was rather  the employee than the friend. In fact he did not get on half so far as did  Gavan Blake, who came up to Kuryong occasionally, and made himself so agreeable  that already his name was being coupled with that of the heiress. Ellen  Harriott always spoke to Blake when he came to the station, and gave no sign of  jealousy at his attentions to Mary Grant; but she was waiting and watching, as  one who has been a nurse learns to do. And things were in this state when an  unexpected event put an altogether different complexion on affairs.</p>

  Red Mick and His Sheep Dogs</b></h2>
<p>When Hugh came home one day with his face, as usual, full of trouble,  Mary began to laugh him out of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr Hugh, which is it today&mdash;the Doyles or the Donohoes? Have  they been stealing sheep or breaking gates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all very well for you to laugh,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t  understand. Some of that gang up the river went into the stud paddock yesterday  to cut down a tree for a bee&rsquo;s nest, and left the tree burning; might have set  the whole run&mdash;forty thousand acres of dry grass&mdash;in a blaze. Then they drove  their dray against the gate, knocking it sideways, and a lot of the stud sheep  got out into the other paddock, and I&rsquo;ll have to be off at daybreak tomorrow to  get &rsquo;em back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you summon the wretches, and have them put in gaol, or  go and break their gates, and cut down their trees?&rdquo; she said, with a cheerful  ignorance of details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t&mdash;simply daren&rsquo;t. If I summoned one of them, I&rsquo;d never  have dry grass but there&rsquo;d be fires. I&rsquo;d never have fat sheep but there&rsquo;d be  dogs among &rsquo;em. They ride all over the run; but if a bird belonging to the  station flew over one of their selections they&rsquo;d summon me for trespass.  There&rsquo;s no end to the injury a spiteful neighbour can do you in this sort of  country. And your father would blame me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s part of the management of a station to get on with your  neighbours. Never quarrel if you can help it. But since shearing troubles  started we have no friends at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I should like to have a look at those desperate  neighbours I hear so much about. Red Mick Donohoe rode past the other day on  such a beautiful horse, and he opened the gate for us, and asked if he might  come down to hear me sing. Think of that, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go for a ride up that way tomorrow  afternoon. We might find Red Mick killing some of our sheep, and you can go  into the box as the lady detective. If you&rsquo;ll only sing him into gaol, the  station will pay you at the same rate at Patti gets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next afternoon they cantered away up the river towards the  mountains. Poss and Binjie had long ago laid their dearest possessions at her  feet, begging her to ride them&mdash;horses so precious that it had hitherto been  deemed sacrilege to put a side-saddle on them. She had the divine gift of  &ldquo;hands&rdquo;, and all manner of excitable, pulling horses went quietly and smoothly  under her management. Her English training had taught her to ride over jumps,  and she was very anxious to have a try at post-and-rail fences.</p>
<p>After much pressing, Hugh had this day allowed her to try Obadiah,  Binjie&rsquo;s celebrated show jumper, an animal that could be trusted to jump  anything he could see over; so during their ride to the habitat of the Donohoes  they left the regular track, and followed one of the fences for a mile or two,  looking for a suitable place to try the horse. No good place offered itself, as  the timber was thick, and the country so rugged that she would have had to ride  at a post-and-rail&nbsp;either up or down a steep slope. Loitering along, far  off the track, they crossed a little ridge where stringybark trees, with an  undergrowth of bushes and saplings, formed a regular thicket.</p>
<p>Suddenly Hugh gave a whistle of surprise, and jumped from his  horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold this horse a minute, please,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There has been a mob  of sheep driven here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereabouts?&rdquo; said she, staring round her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All about here,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the ground. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see  the tracks? Hundreds of &rsquo;em. But I can&rsquo;t see what they were up to. There&rsquo;s no  place they could get &rsquo;em out without cutting the wires, and the fence is sound  enough. Good heavens, see it now! Well, that&rsquo;s smart,&rdquo; he continued, leaning  against a post and giving it a shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have they done? I don&rsquo;t understand. How have they got the  sheep through without breaking the fence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve dug up four or five posts,&rdquo; he said, kicking over some  red earth with his foot, &ldquo;laid that piece of fence flat on the ground, driven  the sheep over it, and then put the fence up again. No wonder we are missing  sheep! Two or three hundred have gone out here! Here&rsquo;s a chance at last&mdash;the  chance I&rsquo;ve been waiting for all these years! What a lucky thing we came here!  And now, Miss Grant,&rdquo; he said, remounting, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t have any jumping today.  I&rsquo;ll have to follow these tracks till I come on the sheep somewhere, if it&rsquo;s in  Red Mick Donohoe&rsquo;s own yard. Do you think you can find your way back to the  homestead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell them to send Poss and Binjie after me. I don&rsquo;t expect  they&rsquo;ve gone home yet. I want a witness with me when I catch Red Mick with  these sheep, or else fifty of his clan will swear that he has been in bed for  six weeks, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said firmly, gathering up the reins in her daintily  gloved hands as she spoke, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with you. I&rsquo;m just as good a witness as  Poss or Binjie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;that won&rsquo;t do. There may be a row. It&rsquo;s  a rough sort of place, and a rough lot of people. Now look here, Miss Grant,  oblige me and go home. The horse will take you straight back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes glowed with excitement. &ldquo;Please let me come,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how much I want to come. I&rsquo;ll do whatever you tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He argued and expostulated and entreated. He knew well enough  there was a good deal of risk in the matter, and he tried hard to make her go  back. But she was determined to go with him, and the argument ended in the only  possible manner&mdash;she went. She promised to do exactly what she was told, to keep  out of the way if so ordered, and, above all, not to speak except when spoken  to.</p>
<p>So off they went through the scrub on the track of the sheep,  plain as print to the young bushman, although invisible to his companion. They  rode at a walk for the most part, for fear of being heard. Now and again, when  they could see for a good distance ahead, they let the horses canter; Hugh  riding in front, she, like a damosel of old, in assumed submission a few  lengths behind, and thoroughly enjoying the adventure.</p>
<p>Of course she could not keep silence long, and after a while she  drew alongside, and whispered, &ldquo;Do you think we shall catch them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so. But it&rsquo;s a very curious thing; there has been a dog  after these sheep&mdash;see, there&rsquo;s his track,&rdquo; pointing to footprints plainly  marked in wet sand&mdash;&ldquo;but no track of man or horse to be seen. By Jove, look  there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had come to the crest of a small hill, and were looking down  a long valley. To right and left of them towered the blue, rugged peaks;  straight in front the valley opened out, and they got a fairly clear view for a  mile or more. About half a mile ahead, travelling in a compact mass down the  valley, was a mob of some two or three hundred sheep. At their heels trotted  two sheepdogs of the small wiry breed common in the mountains. Hugh looked  about to see who was in charge of them; but no one was visible. The dogs were  taking the sheep along without word or sign from anyone, hurrying them at a  good sharp pace, each keeping on his own flank of the mob, or occasionally  dropping behind to hurry up the laggards.</p>
<p>It was a marvellous exhibition of sagacity. They came to a place  where it was necessary to turn sharply to the right to cross a small creek; one  of the dogs shot forward, and sent the leading sheep scurrying down the bank,  while the other fell back a few yards and prevented the mob turning back. After  a moment&rsquo;s hesitation the sheep plunged into the shallow water, splashed across  the creek, and set off again in their compact march down the valley, urged and  directed by their silent custodians&mdash;who paused to lap a few mouthfuls of water,  and then hurried on with an air of importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; said Hugh, in open admiration. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that  wonderful? Those are Red Mick&rsquo;s dogs. I knew they were good dogs, but this is  simply marvellous, isn&rsquo;t it? What are we to do now? If I take the sheep from  them they&rsquo;ll run home, and I can&rsquo;t prosecute Red Mick because they picked up a  mob of sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but he must be near them somewhere,&rdquo; said Mary, to whom the  whole affair appeared uncanny. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t drive sheep by themselves,  surely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, he started them. Once he got the sheep out of the  paddock, he started the dogs for home, and rode off. You see his plan. If  anyone finds the dogs with them, of course he had nothing to do with it.  Sheepdogs will often go into a paddock, and bring a mob of sheep up to the yard  on their own account. It&rsquo;s an instinct with them. Look at those two now,  forcing the sheep over that bad crossing. Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, triumphantly, &ldquo;what about the fence? They couldn&rsquo;t  dig up that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Red Mick did; but who&rsquo;s to prove it? He&rsquo;ll swear he never was  near the fence, and that his dogs picked up these sheep and brought them home  on their own account. The jury would find that I dug up my own fence, and  they&rsquo;d acquit Red Mick, and give him a testimonial. No, I&rsquo;ll tell you what  we&rsquo;ll do. We&rsquo;ll cut across the range, and sneak up as near Red Mick&rsquo;s as we  can. Then we&rsquo;ll hide and watch his house; and when the dogs come up, if he  takes the sheep from them, or starts to drive them anywhere, we&rsquo;ve got him.  Once he takes charge of those sheep he&rsquo;s done. Of course there may be a bit of  trouble when we spring up and accuse him. Are you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid&mdash;with you. I like it. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner said than done. They set their horses in motion, and  went at a steady trot for a mile or so, crossing the valley at right angles,  over a sharp rise and down a small hill, till Hugh again pulled up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Red Mick&rsquo;s homestead,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a speck far  away down a gully. &ldquo;The sheep will come up the creek, because it is the  smoothest track. Now, we must tie our horses up here, sneak down the creek bed,  and get as near the house as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They tied their horses up in a clump of trees, and made the rest  of the journey on foot, hurrying silently for half a mile down the bed of the  creek, hidden by its steep banks. Here and there, to escape observation, they  had to walk in the water, and Hugh, looking round, saw his companion wading  after him, with face firm-set and eyes ablaze. It was a man-hunt, the most  exciting of all hunting.</p>
<p>He laughed silently at the girl&rsquo;s flushed and excited face. As he  reached out to help her over some fallen timber, she took his hand with a firm  grip that set his nerves tingling. They pushed on until almost abreast of Red  Mick&rsquo;s dwelling; then Hugh, standing on a projecting stump, peered over the  high bank to see how the land lay, while his companion sat down and watched his  movements with wide open eyes.</p>
<p>He saw the cottage drowsing in the bright afternoon sunlight. It  was a picturesque little building, made of heavy red-gum slabs, with a bark  roof; the windows were merely square holes cut in the slabs, fitted with heavy  wooden covers that now hung open, giving a view of the interior. In one room  could be seen a rough dresser covered with plates and dishes, and a saddle hung  from a tie-beam; in the other there was a rough plank bed with blue blankets.  The door was shut, and there was no sign of life about the place. There was no  garden in front of the house, merely the bare earth and a dust-heap where ashes  were thrown out, on which a few hens were enjoying the afternoon sun and  fluffing the dust over themselves.</p>
<p>At the back was a fair-sized garden, with fine, healthy-looking  trees; and about a quarter of a mile away was the straggling collection of  bark-roofed sheds and corkscrew-looking fences that served Red Mick as  shearing-sheds for his sheep, and drafting and branding yards for his cattle  and horses. After a hurried survey Hugh dropped lightly down into shelter, and  whispered, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one moving at all. There&rsquo;s a newly fallen tree about a  hundred yards down the creek; we&rsquo;ll get among its branches and watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crept along the creek until opposite the fallen tree; there  Hugh scaled the bank and pulled Mary up after him. Silent as shadows, they  stole through a little patch of young timber, and ensconced themselves among  the fragrant branches. The grass was long where the tree had fallen, and this,  with the green boughs, made a splendid couch and hiding-place.</p>
<p>They settled close together and peered out like squirrels, first  up at the house, then down the valley for the arrival of the sheep. Both were  shaking with excitement&mdash;she at the unwonted sensation of attacking a criminal  in his lair, and he with anxiety lest some unlucky chance should bring his plan  to nought, and make him a failure in the eyes of the woman he loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one about,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I expect Red Mick has told  the family to keep indoors, so that they can swear they saw nothing. You aren&rsquo;t  afraid, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pressed his arm in answer, gave a low laugh, and pointed down  the flat. There, far away among the trees, they saw the white phalanx of the  approaching sheep, and the little lean dogs hunting them straight towards the  house.</p>
<p>Still no sign from Red Mick. No one stirred about the place; the  fowls still fluttered in the dust, and a dissipated-looking pet cockatoo,  perched on the wood-heap repeated several times in a drowsy tone, &ldquo;Goodbye,  Cockie! Goodbye Cockie!&rdquo; Then the door opened, and Red Mick stepped out.</p>
<p>He was the acknowledged leader of the Doyle-Donohoe faction in all  matters of cunning, and in all raids on other folks&rsquo; stock; and not only did he  plan the raids, but took a leading part in executing them. He was the finest  and most fearless bush rider in the district, and could track like a  blackfellow. If he left a strange camp at sundown, and rode about the bush all  night, he could at any time go back straight across country to his starting  point, or to any place he had visited during his wanderings. Such bushmanship  is a gift, and not to be learnt. If once he saw a horse, he would know it again  for the rest of his life&mdash;fat or lean, sick or well. Which is also a gift.</p>
<p>In appearance he was a tall, lanky, large-handed, slab-sided  cornstalk, about thirty-five years of age, with a huge red beard that nearly  covered his face, and a brick-dust complexion variegated with large freckles.  His legs were long and straight; he wore tight-fitting white moleskin trousers,  a coloured Crimean shirt, and a battered felt hat.</p>
<p>Miss Grant felt almost sorry for this big, simple-looking bushman,  who came strolling past their hiding-place, his eyes fixed on the sheep, and  his hands mechanically occupied in cutting up tobacco. Behind him gambolled a  half-grown collie pup, evidently a relative of the dogs in charge of the sheep.</p>
<p>They brought the sheep up to a little corner of land formed by a  sharp bend of the creek, then stopped, squatting on their haunches as  sentinels, and the sheep, fatigued with their long, fast run, settled in under  the trees to get out of the sun. Behind the sheep, Hugh caught a glimpse of two  horsemen coming slowly up the road towards the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Here&rsquo;s Mick&rsquo;s nephews,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;come to take the  sheep away. By George, we&rsquo;ll bag the whole lot! Sit quiet: don&rsquo;t make a sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crisis approached. Miss Grant, with strained attention, saw  Red Mick strike a match, and light his pipe. Strolling on towards the sheep, he  passed about thirty yards from where they lay hidden. Already she was thinking  how exciting it would be when they rose out of the bushes, and faced him in  quite the best &ldquo;We are Hawkshaw, the detective&rdquo; style.</p>
<p>But they had to reckon with one thing they had overlooked, and  that was the collie pup. That budding genius, blundering along after his  master, suddenly stopped, turned towards the fallen tree, and sniffed the air.  Then he ran a few steps towards them, and stopped, his ears pricked and his  eyes fixed on the tree; barked sharply, drew back a pace or two, bristled up  the hair on his neck, and growled.</p>
<p>Red Mick turned around. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, pup,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The puppy came forward again, quite close to the tree this time,  and barked sharply. &ldquo;Good pup,&rdquo; said Mick, &ldquo;fitch him out, pup!&mdash;What is  it&mdash;native cat? Goo for &rsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, the puppy darted forward barking, and Red Mick  stopped leisurely, picked up a large stone, and sent it crashing among the  branches. It passed between Hugh and Miss Grant, and came near enough to  stunning one or other of them. They jumped to their feet hurriedly, and without  dignity climbed out of the branches, and advanced on Red Mick, while the puppy  ran yelping behind his master.</p>
<p>It is only reasonable to suppose that Mick was somewhat astonished  at the apparition. He could scarcely have expected his shot to disturb two such  fine birds from such an extraordinary nest; but before they had extricated  themselves from the branches his face had assumed the stolid, cow-like,  unintelligent look which had so often baffled judges and Crown Prosecutors. He  was bland and child-like as&nbsp;Bret  Harte&rsquo;s Chinee.</p>
<p>He spoke as if he were quite accustomed to unearthing young couples  out of trees. His voice had a sort of &ldquo;I quite understand how it is,&rdquo; tone, and  he spoke cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, Misther Hugh! Where&rsquo;s your horses? Have you had a  fall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fall! No!&rdquo; snapped Hugh, whose temper was gradually rising as the  absurdity of the situation dawned on him. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had a fall. We ran the  tracks of a lot of our sheep from the big paddock, and here they are now. I&rsquo;d  like to know what this means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is thim your sheep?&rdquo; said the bland Mick, surprised. &ldquo;I wuz  wondherin&rsquo; whose sheep they wuz, comin&rsquo; up the flat. I knew they wuzn&rsquo;t  travellin&rsquo; sheep, &rsquo;cause of gettin&rsquo; no notice, an me bein&rsquo; laid up in the house  this two days&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all very fine, Mick Donohoe?&rdquo; said the young man  angrily. &ldquo;Your own dogs have brought them here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red Mick laughed gaily. &ldquo;Ah, thim dogs is always yardin&rsquo; up  things. They never see a mob of sheep, but they&rsquo;ll start to dhrive &rsquo;em some  place. When I was travellin&rsquo; down the Darlin&rsquo;, goin&rsquo; through Dunloe station, in  one paddock I missed th&rsquo; old slut, and when I see her again, she had gethered  fifteen thousand sheep, and was bringin&rsquo; &rsquo;em after me. But, Lord bless your  heart, Mr Hugh,&rdquo; he added with a comforting smile, &ldquo;she wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a hair of  a sheep&rsquo;s head, nor the young dog ayther. Them sheep&rsquo;ll be all right. Sorra  sheep ever she bit in her life. I wonder where they gethered them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you where they gathered them,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;The fence of  our paddock was dug up, and the sheep were run out, and then the fence was put  up again. That&rsquo;s how they gathered them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fence wuz dug up! Ah, look at that now. Terrible, ain&rsquo;t it.  An&rsquo; who done it, do ye think? Some of them carriers, I expect, puttin&rsquo; their  horses in unbeknownst to you. I&rsquo;ll bet &rsquo;twas them done it. Or, perhaps,&rdquo; he  added, with an evident desire to assist in solving the difficulty, &ldquo;perhaps the  wind blew it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Hugh scornfully. &ldquo;Wind blow down a fence! What next!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well it does blow terrible hard sometimes in these parts,&rdquo; said  Red Mick, shaking his head dolefully; &ldquo;look at me crop of onions I planted&mdash;the  wind blew &rsquo;em out of the ground, and hung &rsquo;em on the fence. But wait now, till  we have a look at these sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; said Hugh angrily. &ldquo;We will be off home now,  and send a man for them. And I advise you to be very careful, Mick Donohoe, for  I have my own idea who dug up that fence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t suppose that I done it, do you?&rdquo; said Red Mick.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the house this three days. Besides, I wouldn&rsquo;t steal my  brother-in-law&rsquo;s sheep, anyhow. Won&rsquo;t ye come up, and have a dhrink of tea now,  you and the lady? It&rsquo;s terrible hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Hugh stiffly. &ldquo;Come along, Miss Grant.&rdquo; And  they marched off towards the horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It beats all who could have took them posts down, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;  said Mick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d offer a reward, if I was you. Them fellows about here would  steal the eyes out of your head. Good day to ye, Mr Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the cockatoo added, &ldquo;Goodbye, Cockie,&rdquo; in a sepulchral voice,  as they trudged off, smitten hip and thigh.</p>
<p>Hugh was suffering intensely at his defeat, and when Mary Grant  said, &ldquo;I suppose you will have him put in gaol at once?&rdquo; he muttered that he  would have to think it over. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do to prosecute him and fail, and we  have no proof that he dug up the fence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did he say that the sheep belonged to his  brother-in-law?&rdquo; Hugh started. &ldquo;Did he say that? Well, he&mdash;he must have wanted  to make out that he did not know whose sheep they were&rdquo;: but he thought to  himself, &ldquo;Is Red Mick going to bring up that old scandal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mick, as he watched them go, winked twice to himself, and then  stooped and patted the head of the collie pup. The other dogs, in answer to a  silent wave of his hand, had slunk off quietly. The riders had disappeared. It  had been a narrow escape, and Red Mick knew it; and even as things had turned  out, there was still ample chance of a conviction.</p>
<p>On the way back to the homestead Hugh began to talk of the chance  of a conviction, and the delight it would be to give Mick seven years, but his  ideas were disturbed by thoughts of Mick&rsquo;s face as he said, &ldquo;Why should I steal  my brother-in-law&rsquo;s sheep?&rdquo; He looked at the girl alongside him, and prayed  that the old story might never be resurrected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  A Proposal and Its Results</b></h2>
<p>The question whether Mick Donohoe should be prosecuted  was not likely to be prejudiced by his claim of kinship. Billy the Bully would  as soon prosecute his own brother-in-law as anybody else&mdash;sooner, in fact. So  Hugh, having reached home very crestfallen and angry, wrote a full account of  the affair in his report of the station work, and asked whether he should lay  an information.</p>
<p>Grant&rsquo;s reply was brief and to the point; he seldom wrote letters,  always telegraphing when possible. On this occasion the telegram said,  &ldquo;Prosecute at once; offer reward informers&rdquo; which, leaking out (as telegrams  frequently did at the local office) put Red Mick considerably on the&nbsp;<i>qui  vive</i>. The old man actually paid him the compliment of writing a letter  about him later on, saying that it would be a good thing to prosecute&mdash;it would give  Red Mick a good scare, even if it didn&rsquo;t get him into gaol. Circumstances, no  doubt, justified a prosecution, and it was hard to see how Mick could make a  counter-move.</p>
<p>But that gentleman was not without resource; an anonymous letter  arrived for Hugh by the mailboy, a dirty, scrawled epistle, unsigned and  undated, running as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Mr    Gordon i herd you was gone to summons Michael Donohoe for sheep stealing. You    better bewar there is some seen you and that girl in the bush you will get a    grate shown up and her two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This precious epistle was signed &ldquo;A Friend&rdquo;, and on first reading  it Hugh laughed heartily; but the more he thought it over the less he liked it.  It was all very well to put Red Mick in the dock, but it was evident that part  of the defence would be, &ldquo;How came you to be under the boughs of a fallen tree  with an attractive young woman when Red Mick&rsquo;s dogs came up with the sheep?&rdquo; At  the very least they would look ridiculous; and the unknown correspondent who  promised them a &ldquo;grate shown up&rdquo; would probably take care that the story was as  highly coloured as possible. He shuddered to think what the Donohoes would say,  and heartily wished he had let Red Mick alone.</p>
<p>He fretted for some hours, and then decided to talk it over with  the girl herself. He did not care to let Red Mick think that the anonymous  letter had stopped the prosecution; at the same time, he was determined to do  nothing that would cause Miss Grant the least annoyance. He opened the  discussion that evening while strolling about the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About this business of Red Mick&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am rather  worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the trouble is this: I&rsquo;ve got an anonymous letter from Red  Mick or some of his people, saying that they are going to give you and me a  great showing-up about being hidden in the tree together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can they say?&rdquo; she asked uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, they will talk about our being in the tree  together&mdash;and&mdash;all that kind of thing, you know. They will make things as  unpleasant for us as they can. They may want you to give evidence, and all that  sort of thing&mdash;and I thought, perhaps you mightn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She froze into dignity at once. &ldquo;I certainly shouldn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;About being in the tree, that does not matter, of course, but I hope  you will keep my name out of the affair altogether. I must ask you to do that  for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he rushed on his fate. Many a time he had pictured how he  would wait till they were alone together in the garden on some glorious moonlit  night, and he would take her hand, and tell her how much he loved her; and now,  seeing the girl standing before him flushed with insulted dignity, he suddenly  found himself gasping out, in what seemed somebody&rsquo;s else&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t  we&mdash;look here, Miss Grant, won&rsquo;t you be engaged to me? Then it won&rsquo;t matter what  they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to take her hand, but she drew back, white to the lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; let me go; let me go,&rdquo; she said. Then the colour came  back to her face, and she drew herself up, and spoke slowly and cuttingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you very much for what you have just said. But I really  think that I shall be able to put up with anything these people may choose to  say about me. It won&rsquo;t hurt me, and I shouldn&rsquo;t like you to sacrifice yourself  to save me from the talk of such people. Let us go back to the house, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared helplessly at her, and could not find his voice for a  moment. At last he blurted out: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because of that. I don&rsquo;t care about  them any more than you do. Don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that, Miss Grant. Why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go back to the house, please,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;and  don&rsquo;t say anything more about it. And whatever happens, I must ask you to keep  my name out of the affair altogether. You&rsquo;ll do that, won&rsquo;t you? Let us go back  now, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked back in silence. He looked at her once or twice, but  her face was stern and rigid, and she would not give him even one glance. At  the door she gave him her hand, with a matter-of-fact &ldquo;I will say good-night  now,&rdquo; and disappeared into her room, where she threw herself on the bed and  sobbed bitterly; for the truth was that she was very, very fond of him. She,  too, had built her little castles in the air as to what she would say and do  when he put the momentous question. Girls do foresee these things, somehow;  although they do pretend to be astonished when the time arrives.</p>
<p>She had pictured him saying all sorts of endearing things, and  making all sorts of loving protestations; and now it had come to this&mdash;she had  been asked as if it were merely a matter of avoiding scandal. It was too great  a shock. She lay silently crying, while Hugh, his castles in the air having  crumbled around him, was trying in a dazed way to frame a letter to Mr Grant.</p>
<p>His thoughts were anything but pleasant. What a fool he had been,  talking to her like that! Making it look as if he had only proposed to her  because he ought to protect her good name! Why hadn&rsquo;t he spoken to her  before&mdash;in the tree, on the ride home, any other time? Why hadn&rsquo;t he spoken  differently? To him the refusal seemed the end of all things. He thought of  asking Mr Grant to give him the management of the most out-back place he had,  so that he could go away and bury himself. He even thought or resigning his  position altogether and going to the goldfields. Red Mick and his delinquencies  seemed but small matters now; and, after what had passed, he must, of course,  see that Miss Grant was not dragged into the business. So he sat down and began  to write.</p>
<p>The letter took a great deal of thinking over. It had got about  the station that Red Mick had at last been caught in&nbsp;<i>flagrante delicto</i>;  the house-cook has told the cook at the men&rsquo;s hut, and he had told the mailman,  who stopped on the road to tell the teamsters ploughing along with their huge  waggons to Kiley&rsquo;s Crossing; they told the publican at Kiley&rsquo;s, and he told  everybody he saw. The children made a sort of play out of it, the eldest boy  personating Red Mick, while two of the younger ones hid in a fallen tree, and  were routed out by Thomas Carlyle. The station-hands were all excitement; the prospect  of a big law-case was a real godsend to them. To drop the matter would be  equivalent to a confession of defeat, but, after what had passed, Hugh had no  option. So he told Mr Grant that, on thinking it over, he did not consider it  advisable to go on with the case against Red Mick; Miss Grant would have to go  into the box to give evidence, which would be very unpleasant for her.</p>
<p>Poor Hugh! He was too honourable to give any false reason, and too  shy to tell the whole truth. If he had said that there was no hope of a  conviction, it would have been all right. But consideration for the feelings of  anyone, even his own daughter, was to Billy the Bully quite incomprehensible,  and he wrote back, on a letter-card, &ldquo;Go on with the prosecution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This put Hugh in a frightful dilemma. He had no trouble whatever  in making up his mind to disobey the order, as he was bound to stand by his  promise to Miss Grant. But what answer should he send to her father? He was in  a reckless mood, but he knew well enough that Grant would order him off the  place, neck and crop, if he dared to disobey; and he owed it to his mother and  sister to avoid such a thing. The more he looked at the position of affairs,  the less he liked it. He wrote a dozen letters, and tore them up again.</p>
<p>He thought of making Red Mick a sporting offer of, say, a couple  of hundred pounds, to disappear altogether&mdash;Mick could have arranged that easily  enough. Then he thought of going down to see Mr Grant to explain; but the more  he thought of that the less he liked it. He worried and worried over it, and  when he went to bed he lay awake thinking about it. He fell into dozes, and  dreamt that Mr Grant had turned him off the place, and had made Red Mick  manager, and that Miss Grant was going to marry Red Mick; then he woke with a  start, and heard through the darkness the rapid hoof-beats of a horse ridden at  speed up the road from Kiley&rsquo;s, and the barking of dogs that announced the  arrival of a stranger.</p>
<p>He went out and found in the yard one of the telegraph operators  from Kiley&rsquo;s, on a smoking horse. &ldquo;Very important telegram, Mr Gordon,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;I borrowed the horse, and brought it over as fast as I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh opened the envelope hurriedly. The operator struck a match  and held it up while he read. The message was from the secretary of Grant&rsquo;s  club, and ran as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;William  Grant died suddenly this morning. Pinnock taking charge of affairs; am making  arrangements funeral. Better come down at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father dead! The question of Red Mick and his prosecution  became at once a matter of no moment. How absurd his worry and vexation now  seemed. On the other hand, what new complications might arise? All these years  the Gordons had lived on the assumption that Mr Grant would provide for them,  without having any promise or agreement from him; and, owing to the old man&rsquo;s  violent temper, they had been in daily risk of being ordered off the place.  They had got used to this as people get used to living on the side of a  volcano. But now&mdash;?</p>
<p>Her father dead! He could not bear to see her grief, and the  thought of it made him determined to get away as quickly as possible. Quietly  he awoke his mother, and told her what had happened, and by dawn was well on  his way to Tarrong to catch the train to Sydney.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  The Road to No Man&rsquo;s Land</b></h2>
<p>Now we must follow for a  time the adventures of Charlie Gordon and the new chum, whom we left just  starting out for &ldquo;far back&rdquo;, Charlie to take over a cattle station for Old Man  Grant, and Carew to search for Patrick Henry Considine. After a short sea  journey they took train to a dusty backblocks township, where Gordon picked up  one of the many outfits which he had scattered over the country, and which in  this case consisted of a vehicle, a dozen or so of horses, and a black boy  named Frying Pan. </p>
<p>They drove four horses in a low, American-made buggy, and  travelled about fifty miles a day. Frying Pan was invaluable. He seemed to have  a natural affinity for horses. He could catch them anywhere and track them if  they got lost. Carew tried to talk to him, but could get little out of him, for  he knew only the pidgin English, which is in use in those parts, and said &ldquo;No  more&rdquo; to nearly every question. He rode along behind the loose horses,  apparently quite satisfied with his own company. Every now and then he came  alongside the vehicle, and said &ldquo;Terbacker&rdquo;. Charlie threw him a stick of the  blackest, rankest tobacco known to the trade, and off he went again.</p>
<p>Once they saw him get off his horse near a lagoon, plunge his arm  into a hole, and pull out a mud-turtle, an evil-smelling beast; this he carried  for several miles over his shoulder, holding its head, and letting the body  swing at the end of the long neck&mdash;a proceeding which must have caused the  turtle intense suffering. After a while his horse shied, and he dropped the  turtle on the ground with a dull thud. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to pick him up again?&rdquo;  cried Carew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more,&rdquo; replied Frying Pan, carelessly. Then he grinned, and  volunteered a remark. &ldquo;Make that feller plenty tired walk home again,&rdquo; he said.  And this was his only conversation during a two-hundred-mile journey.</p>
<p>At night they usually managed to reach a station, where the man in  charge would greet them effusively, and beg them to turn their horses out and  stay a week&mdash;or a year&mdash;or two, just as long as they liked. They met all sorts at  these stations, from English swells to bushmen of the roughest. Sometimes they  camped out, putting hobbles on the horses, and spreading their blankets under  the buggy on a bed of long grass gathered by Frying Pan.</p>
<p>As they got further out, the road became less and less defined,  stations fewer, and everything rougher. They left the sheep-country behind them  and got out into cattle land, where &ldquo;runs&rdquo; are measured by the hundred square  miles, and every man is a law unto himself. They left their buggy after a time,  and pushed on with packhorses; and after travelling about two hundred miles,  came to the outer edge of the settled district, where they stayed with two  young Englishmen, who were living under a dray, and building their cattle-yards  themselves&mdash;the yards being a necessity, and the house, which was to come  afterwards, a luxury. The diet was monotonous&mdash;meat &ldquo;<i>ad libitum</i>&rdquo;, damper  and tea. They had neighbours within sixty miles, and got letters once in two  months by riding that distance. &ldquo;Stay here a while,&rdquo; they said to the  travellers, &ldquo;and take up some of the country near by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re to take over the country Redman took up,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;It  joins you doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. See those far blue ranges? Well, we run to them on this side,  and Redman&rsquo;s block runs to them on the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t your cattle make out that way?&rdquo; asked Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; replied he, laughing. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve some good boundary riders  out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wild blacks,&rdquo; answered the Englishman. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re bad out on  those hills. You&rsquo;ll find yourselves in a nice shop when you take that block  over. There&rsquo;s a pretty fair humpy to live in, that&rsquo;s one thing. What do you  call the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Man&rsquo;s Land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good name, too,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not fit for any man. I  wish you&rsquo;d stop with us a while, but I suppose we&rsquo;ll see you coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be there longer than we  can help. Who&rsquo;s on the block now? Redman sold his rights in it after he&rsquo;d  mortgaged it to my uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s old Paddy Keogh there now&mdash;greatest old character in the  north. Lives there with his blacks and a Chinaman. Regular oldest-inhabitant  sort of chap. Would have gone with Noah in the Ark, but he swore so badly they wouldn&rsquo;t  have him on board. You&rsquo;ll find him great fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;ll give us possession all right. We don&rsquo;t want any  trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d fire at you just as soon as look at you, I think,&rdquo; said the  other. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t fancy he wants to stay there much. It&rsquo;s not the first time  he&rsquo;s been broke, so I don&rsquo;t expect he&rsquo;ll take it very hard. Well, if you won&rsquo;t  stay, goodbye and good luck! Give my best wishes to old Paddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They resumed the weary journey, and after another two days&rsquo; riding  sighted away over the plain a small iron house, gleaming in the setting sun.  &ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s No Man&rsquo;s Land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arrival was not inspiring. They rode their tired horses up to  the low-roofed galvanised-iron house that looked like a huge kerosene-tin laid  on its side, with a hole cut for a door and two holes for windows. There was no  garden and no fenced yard. It was stuck down in the middle of the wilderness,  glaring forlornly out of its windows at a wide expanse of dry grass and  dull-green bushes. Behind it was a small duplicate, which served as kitchen and  store. A huge buffalo-head was nailed to a tree near by. In front was a rail on  which were spread riding-saddles, pack saddles, hobbles, surcingles, pannikins,  bridles, empty bags, and all manner of horse-gear; and roundabout were a litter  of chips, an assortment of empty tins, bits of bullock-hide, empty  cartridge-cases, and the bare skulls of three or four bullocks, with neat  bullet-holes between the eyes.</p>
<p>Amidst this congenial&nbsp;<i>debris</i>&nbsp;roamed a herd of  gaunt pigs, fierce-eyed, quarrelsome pigs, that prowled restlessly about, and  ever and again returned disconsolately to the stinking carcasses of some large  birds of prey that had been thrown out in the sun. They were flat-sided,  long-legged, long-nosed, and had large bristling manes&mdash;showed, in fact, every sign  of reverting to the type of the original pig that yachted with Noah. Living  with them, in a state of armed neutrality, were three or four savage-looking  cattle dogs, who honoured the strangers with deep growls, not condescending to  bark.</p>
<p>Charlie pulled up in front of the house, and cooeed. A Chinaman  put his head out of the kitchen door, smiled blandly, said &ldquo;&rsquo;Ello!&rdquo; and  retired. Gordon and Carew unsaddled the horses, put the hobbles on, and carried  all the gear into the house. By this time the Chinee had donned a dirty calico  jacket, and began in silence to put some knives, forks and pannikins on the  table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the old man?&rdquo; roared Charlie, as if he thought the Chinee  were deaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t understand any English, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Just then a tramping of hoofs was heard; and looking out of the  back door they saw, about two hundred yards away, a large horse-yard, over  which hung a cloud of dust. Under the dust were signs of a struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the yard,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cloud of dust shifted from place to place, and out of it came  a medley of weird oaths, the dull thudding of a waddy, and the heavy breathing  of men and animals in combat. Suddenly a lithe, sinewy black boy, dressed in a  short blue shirt, bounded like a squirrel to the top of the fence and perched  there; and through the mist they saw a very tall old man, holding on like grim  death to the end of a long rope, and being hauled about the yard in great jumps  by a half-grown steer. Behind the steer another black boy dodged in and out,  welting and prodding it from time to time with a bamboo pole. Maddened by the  blows, the steer would dash forward and narrowly miss impaling the man on his  horns; then, taking advantage of his impetus, the old man would try to haul him  into a smaller yard. Every time he got to the gate the steer yanked him out  again by a series of backward springs that would have hauled along a dromedary,  and the struggle began all over again. The black boy on the fence dropped down  with the agility of a panther, took up the rope behind the old man, and pulled  for all he was worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit him there, Billy! Whack him! Come on, you son of a cow! I&rsquo;ll  pull you in if I have to pull your head off. Come on now!&rdquo; And once more the  struggle raged furiously.</p>
<p>Charlie clambered up on the fence and sat there for a moment. The  old man saw him, but evinced no surprise. He just said, &ldquo;Here, Mister  Whoever-you-are, kitch hold of that rope.&rdquo; Their united forces were too much  for the steer, and he was hauled in by main strength under a fusillade of  bamboo on his stern. Once in the small yard, he abandoned the struggle, and  charged wildly at his captors. The old man slipped nimbly to one side, Gordon  darted up the nearest fence, while Carew and the black boy got tangled up with  the rope.</p>
<p>In the&nbsp;<i>sauve qui peut</i>&nbsp;which ensued, Carew pushed  the black down on the ground right in front of the steer, which immediately  fell over him, and tangled him up more than ever. Then it turned on him with a  roar of rage, butted him violently, rolled him over and over in the dirt, knelt  on him, bellowed in his ear, and slobbered on him. It looked as if the boy must  be killed. His mate dashed in with a bamboo, and welted and whacked away  without making any impression, till the animal of its own accord withdrew  gloomily to a corner of the yard, dragging the rope after it. Carew watched the  prostrate boy in agonised suspense, hardly daring to hope that he was alive.  With a gasp of satisfaction he saw him rise to his feet, rub some of the dirt  off his face, and look round at the steer. Then he gave his shirt a shake and  began to brush himself with his hands, saying in an indignant tone, &ldquo;Flamin&rsquo;  bullock! Spoil my new chirt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now all hands seized the rope again; in a trice the bullock was hauled  up against the fence, thrown to the ground, and held there while the old man  sawed off the point of one horn, which was growing into the animal&rsquo;s eye. When  the job was done he straightened himself up, and through the covering grime and  dust they had a good look at him.</p>
<p>He had a long, red nose, a pair of bright hazel eyes, and a bushy,  grizzled beard and moustache hiding all the lower part of his face. On his head  was a shapeless felt hat, from which a string passed under his nose. His arms  were hairy and baboon-like; his long thin legs seemed intended by Nature to fit  the sides of a horse. He wore tweed pants, green with age, and strapped on the  inside with a lighter-coloured and newer material; also a very dirty coloured  cotton shirt, open in front, and showing a large expanse of hairy chest. His  voice was husky from much swearing at profligate cattle, and there was a  curious nasal twang in his tone, an affectation of Americanism that was a  departure from the ordinary bush drawl.</p>
<p>Charlie introduced himself. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Gordon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and this  is a friend of mine. We&rsquo;ve come to take this block over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to it, Mister,&rdquo; said the old man promptly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  about broke me, and if you don&rsquo;t look out it&rsquo;ll break you. Any man that gits  this place will hump his swag from it in five years, mark me! Come on down to  the house,&rdquo; he continued, picking up the rope and other gear lying about the  fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you boys, let that steer out, and then go and help the gins  bring the cattle in. Look lively now, you tallow-faced crawlers. Come on,  Mister. Did you bring any square-face with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We brought a drop o&rsquo; rum,&rdquo; replied Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! That&rsquo;ll do. That&rsquo;s the real Mackay,&rdquo; said the veteran,  slouching along at a perceptibly quicker gait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, look, see here now, Mister!&rdquo; he continued, anxiously, &ldquo;you  didn&rsquo;t let Ah Loy get hold of it, did you? He&rsquo;s a real terror, that Chow of  mine. Did you see him when you came in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we saw him. He couldn&rsquo;t speak any English, seemingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him! He don&rsquo;t savvy much  English. He knows all he wants, though. He can lower the rum with any Christian  ever I see. It don&rsquo;t do to let him get his hands on a bottle of anythink in the  spirit line. It&rsquo;ll come back half-empty. Now then, cook,&rdquo; he roared, seating  himself at the rough slab table, and drumming on it with a knife, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have  some grub, quick, and you&rsquo;ll get a nip of rum. This new boss b&rsquo;long you, you  savvy. All about station b&rsquo;long him. I go buffalo shooting. Me stony broke.  Poor fellow me! Been fifteen years in this God-forgotten country, too,&rdquo; he said  reminiscently, placing his elbows on the table, and gazing at the wall in front  of him. &ldquo;Fifteen years livin&rsquo; mostly with the blacks and the Chineymen, and  livin&rsquo; like a black or a Chineyman, too. And what have I got to show for it?  I&rsquo;ve got to hump my bluey out of this, and take to the road like any other  broken-down old swagman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit rough,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;How did you come to grief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I came out here with a big mob of cattle,&rdquo; said the old man,  filling his pipe, as Ah Loy placed some tin plates, a tin dish, and a bottle of  Worcester sauce on the table, and withdrew to the kitchen for the provender. &ldquo;I  lived here, and I spent nothing, and I let &rsquo;em breed. I just looked on, and let  &rsquo;em breed. Oh, there was no waste about my management. I hadn&rsquo;t an overseer at  two pounds ten a week, to boss a lot of flash stockmen at two pounds. I jest  got my own two gins and three good black boys, and I watched them cattle like a  blessed father. I never saw a stranger&rsquo;s face from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end. I  rode all over the face of the earth, keepin&rsquo; track of &rsquo;em. I kep&rsquo; the wild  blacks from scarin&rsquo; &rsquo;em to death, and spearin&rsquo; of &rsquo;em, as is their nature to,  and I got speared myself in one or two little shootin&rsquo; excursions I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shooting the blacks?&rdquo; interpolated Gordon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; like that, Mister. I did let off a rifle a few times,  and I dessay one or two poor ignorant blackfeller-countrymen that had been  fillin&rsquo; my cattle as full of spears as so many hedgehogs&mdash;I dessay they got in  the road of a bullet or two. They&rsquo;re always gettin&rsquo; in the road of things. But  we don&rsquo;t talk of shootin&rsquo; blacks nowadays! These parts is too civilised&mdash;it&rsquo;s  risky. Anyhow, I made them blacks let my cattle alone. And I slaved like a  driven nigger, day in and day out, brandin&rsquo; calves all day long in the dust,  with the sun that hot, the brandin&rsquo; iron &rsquo;ud mark without puttin&rsquo; it in the  fire at all. And then down comes the tick, and kills my cattle by the hundred,  dyin&rsquo; and perishin&rsquo; all over the place. And what lived through it I couldn&rsquo;t  sell anywhere, because they won&rsquo;t let tick-infested cattle go south, and the  Dutch won&rsquo;t let us ship &rsquo;em north to Java, the wretches! And then Mr Grant&rsquo;s  debt was over everything; and at last I had to chuck it up. That&rsquo;s how I got  broke, Mister. I hope you&rsquo;ll have better luck.&rdquo; While he was delivering this  harangue, Carew had been taking notes of the establishment. There was just a  rough table, three boxes to sit on, a meat safe, a few buckets, and a rough set  of shelves, supporting a dipper, and a few tin plates, and tins of jam, while  in the corner stood some rifles and a double-barrelled gun. Saddlery of all  sorts was scattered about the floor promiscuously.</p>
<p>Certainly the owner of No Man&rsquo;s Land had not lived luxuriously. A  low galvanised-iron partition divided the house into two rooms, and through the  doorway could be seen a rough bunk made of bags stretched on saplings.</p>
<p>As the old man finished speaking, Ah Loy brought in the evening  meal&mdash;about a dozen beautifully tender roast ducks in a large tin dish, a tin  plate full of light, delicately-browned cakes of the sort known as  &ldquo;puftalooners&rdquo;, and a huge billy of tea. There were no vegetables; pepper and  salt were in plenty, and Worcester sauce. They ate silently, as hungry men do,  while the pigs and cattle dogs marched in at the open door, and hustled each  other for the scraps that were thrown to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it the pigs have no tails?&rdquo; asked Carew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bit off, Mister. The dogs bit them off. They&rsquo;ve got the ears  pretty well chawed off &rsquo;em too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a pig and a dog made a simultaneous rush for a bone, and  the pig secured it. The dog, by way of revenge, fastened on to the pig, and  made him squeal like a locomotive engine whistling. The old man kicked at large  under the table, and restored order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t eatin&rsquo;, Mister,&rdquo; he said, forking a duck on to Carew&rsquo;s  plate with his own fork. &ldquo;These ducks is all right. They&rsquo;re thick on the  lagoon. The Chow only had two cartridges, but he got about a dozen. He lays  down and fires along the water, and they&rsquo;re floatin&rsquo; very near solid on it. But  here s the cattle comin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking out of the door, they saw about two hundred cattle coming  in a long, stringing mob up the plain, driven by four black figures on  horseback. As they drew near the yards, several cattle seemed inclined to bolt  away; but the sharp fusillade of terrific whips kept them up to the mark, and,  after a sudden halt for a few minutes, the mob streamed in through the gates. A  number of rails were put in the posts, and made fast with pegs. The riders then  remounted, and came cantering and laughing down to the homestead. All four were  Aboriginals, two were the boys that had been seen at the yard. The two new boys  were dressed in moleskins, cotton shirts, and soft felt hats, and each had a  gaudy handkerchief tied round his throat.</p>
<p>One was light, wiry, and graceful as a gazelle&mdash;a very handsome  boy, the embodiment of lightness and activity. The other was short and squat,  with a broad face. Both grinned light-heartedly as they rode up, let their  horses go, and carried their saddles on to the verandah, without bothering  about the strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are nice-looking boys,&rdquo; said Carew. &ldquo;I mean the two new  boys just coming in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New boys!&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Them! They&rsquo;re my two gins. And see  here, Mister, you&rsquo;ll have to keep off hangin&rsquo; round them while you&rsquo;re camped  here. I can&rsquo;t stand anyone interferin&rsquo; with them. If you kick my dorg, or go  after my gin, then you rouse all the monkey in me. Those two do all my cattle  work. Come here, Maggie,&rdquo; he called, and the slight &ldquo;boy&rdquo; walked over with a  graceful, easy swing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is new feller?&rdquo; he said, introducing Carew, who bowed  gracefully. &ldquo;He b&rsquo;long Sydney.  You think him plenty nice feller, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yowi,&rdquo; said the girl laughing. &ldquo;He nice feller. You got &rsquo;em  matches?&rdquo; she said, beaming on Carew, and pulling a black pipe out of her  trousers&rsquo; pocket. &ldquo;Big fool that Lucy, drop &rsquo;em matches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carew handed over his match-box in speechless amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been out all day with the cattle,&rdquo; said the old man.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lot of wild cattle in that there mob. I go out with a few quiet  ones in the moonlight, and when the wild cattle come out of the scrubs to look  at &rsquo;em we rush the whole lot out into the plain. Great hands these gins  are&mdash;just as good as the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said Carew, looking at the two little figures, who  had now a couple of ducks each, a puftalooner or two, and a big pannikin of  tea, and were sitting on the edge of the verandah eating away with great  enjoyment; &ldquo;What have they been doing with the cattle today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minding them lest the wild ones should clear out. They dropped  their matches somehow; that&rsquo;s what fetched &rsquo;em home early. They&rsquo;ll have to  sleep on the verandah tonight. We&rsquo;ll make that their boodore, as they say in France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark was now falling; the sunlight had left long, faint,  crimson streaks in the sky. The air was perceptibly cooler, and flights of  water fowl hurried overhead, making their way to the river. The Chinaman  lighted a slush-lamp, by whose flickering light Charlie produced from his swag  a small bundle of papers, and threw them on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well get our business over, Keogh,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got the paper here for you to sign, taking over your interest in the block and  the cattle, and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pored over the document, muttering as he read it. &ldquo;Your name&rsquo;ll  have to be filled in, and there&rsquo;s a blank for the name of the person it&rsquo;s  transferred to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be Mr Grant&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; suggested Carew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know so much about that,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,  if a man has a mortgage over a place, that he can take it in his own name. That  fool Pinnock didn&rsquo;t tell me. He was too anxious to know how we got on with the  larrikins to give me any useful information. Anyhow, I&rsquo;ll fill in my own  name&mdash;for all the block is worth I ain&rsquo;t likely to steal it. I can transfer it  to Mr Grant afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said the old man indifferently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll transfer my  interest to anyone you like. I&rsquo;m done with it. I&rsquo;m signing away fifteen of the  best years of my life. But my name ain&rsquo;t Keogh, you know, though I always went  by that. My father died when I was a kiddy, and my mother married again, so I  got called by my stepfather&rsquo;s name all my life. This is my right name, and it&rsquo;s  a poor man&rsquo;s name today.&rdquo; And as the two men bent over him in the light of the  flickering slush-lamp, he wrote, with stiff, uncertain fingers, &ldquo;Patrick Henry  Considine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  Considine</b></h2>
<p>For a few seconds no one  spoke. Carew and Gordon stared at the signature, and then looked at each other.  The newly-found Considine looked at his autograph in a critical way, as if not  quite sure he had spelled it right, and then stood up, handing the deed to  Gordon. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There y&rsquo;are,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my right, title and intrust in  all this here block of land, and all the stock what&rsquo;s on it; and if you&rsquo;re ever  short of a man to look after the place in the wet season I&rsquo;ll take the job. I  might be glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s quite likely you won&rsquo;t want any job from me,&rdquo; said Charlie.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be asking you for a job yet. Are you sure that&rsquo;s your right name? What  was your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name? O&rsquo; course it&rsquo;s my name. My father was billiard-marker at  Casey&rsquo;s Hotel, Dandaioo,&rdquo; said the old man with conscious pride. &ldquo;A swell he  had been, but the booze done him up, like many a better man. He used to write  to people over in England  for money, but they never giv&rsquo; him any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he write to?&rdquo; asked Carew, looking at the uncouth  figure with intense interest. &ldquo;Do you know what people he wrote to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs. He wrote to William Considine. That was his father&rsquo;s name.  His father never sent any money, though. Told him to go to hell, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was your father&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Patrick Considine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carew dashed out to his saddle, hurriedly unstrapped a valise, and  brought in a small packet of papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; he said, opening one, and showing it to Gordon.  &ldquo;Those are the names, Patrick Henry Considine, son of William Patrick  Considine. Entitled under his grandfather&rsquo;s will&mdash;by Jove, do you know there&rsquo;s a  lot of money waiting for you in England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of money left you. In England. Any amount of it. If you  are the right man, you&rsquo;re rich, don&rsquo;t you know. Quite a wealthy man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much money d&rsquo;you say, Mister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a great deal. Thousands and thousands. Your grandfather left  it. No one knew for certain where you were, or if you were alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alive all right, I believe,&rdquo; said Considine, staring hard at  them. &ldquo;But look, Mister&mdash;you aren&rsquo;t trying to take the loan of me? Is this  straight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s straight,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go to England to make  your claim good, I expect. It&rsquo;s straight enough. That&rsquo;s what brought Mr Carew  out here, to try and find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time the bushman smoked in silence, looking at each man  in turn, perhaps expecting them to laugh. He muttered once or twice to himself  under his breath. Then he turned on Gordon again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Mr Gordon, is this square? Because, if it ain&rsquo;t,  it&rsquo;ll be a poor joke for some of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man alive, why should we want to fool you? What good could it do  us? It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s all right, we&rsquo;ll all have a drink on it. Here,  Maggie, Lucy, Billy, come here. Get it pannikin. You won&rsquo;t mind me treatin&rsquo; &rsquo;em  with your rum, I suppose, Mister?&rdquo; he said, turning to Gordon. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t come in  for a fortune every day, you know, and there ain&rsquo;t a drop of lush in the place,  only yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away,&rdquo; said Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Lucy. Come on, Maggie. Where&rsquo;s Ah Loy? Watch their  faces, Mister, it&rsquo;s as good as a play. Now then, ladies, I bin poor fella longa  teatime, now rich feller longa bedtime. You savvy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gins grinned uncomprehendingly, but held out their pannikins,  and into each he poured a threefinger nip of raw overproof rum that would have  burnt the palate of Satan himself. They swallowed it neat, in two or three  quick gulps. The tears sprang to their eyes, and they contorted their faces  into all sorts of shapes; but they disdained to take water after it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word, that strong feller, eh?&rdquo; said Considine. &ldquo;Burn your  mouth, I think it. Now then, Ah Loy, how much you wantee? That plenty eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah Loy peered into the tin pannikin with a dejected air, and  turned it on one side to show that there wasn&rsquo;t much in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here y&rsquo;are then,&rdquo; said his boss. &ldquo;Have a bit more. We don&rsquo;t come  in for a fortune every day. Watch him take it, Mister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah Loy put the fiery spirit to his lips, and began to drink in  slow sips, as a connoisseur sips port wine. &ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; said Carew, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll  burn the teeth out of his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chinee sipped away, pausing to let the delicate fluid roll  well into the tender part of his mouth and throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welly stlong!&rdquo; he said at last; but he finished the lot. The two  black boys had their share, and retired again to their camp. Then the three  white men sat out in front of the house on some logs, smoking, and looking at  the blazing stars.</p>
<p>Considine had fifty questions to ask, and the more Carew tried,  the more helpless it was to explain things to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you say there&rsquo;s a house left me with this here money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Carew. &ldquo;Beautiful old place. Old oaks, and all that  sort of thing. You&rsquo;ll like it, I&rsquo;m sure. Used to be a pack of hounds there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Considine with contempt. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of this  huntin&rsquo; they have in England.  Why, I knew a chap that couldn&rsquo;t ride in timber a little, and he went to England and  hunted, and d&rsquo;you know what he said? He said he could have rode in front of the  dogs all the way, if he&rsquo;d have liked. But the owner of the dogs asked him not  to, so he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose could take Maggie and Lucy there,&rdquo; he went on, looking  doubtfully at his hearers. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t mind a chap havin&rsquo; a couple of black  lady friends, would they? Yer see, they&rsquo;ve stuck with me well, those two gins,  and wouldn&rsquo;t like to leave &rsquo;em behind. They&rsquo;d get into bad hands. They&rsquo;re two  as good handy gins as there is in the world. That little fat one&mdash;you start her  out with a bridle and enough tobacker after lost horses, and she&rsquo;ll foller &rsquo;em  till she gets &rsquo;em, if it takes a week. Camps out at night anywhere she can get  water, and gets her own grub&mdash;lizards and young birds, and things like that.  There ain&rsquo;t her equal as a horse-hunter in Australia. Maggie ain&rsquo;t a bad gin  after horses, but if she don&rsquo;t find &rsquo;em on the first day, she won&rsquo;t camp out &rsquo;cause  she gets real frightened. I&rsquo;d like to take &rsquo;em with me, yer know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the two moleskin-trousered, cotton-shirted little  figures passed in front of the hut. &ldquo;There they go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Two real good  gins. Now, as man to man, you wouldn&rsquo;t arst me to turn them loose, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carew looked rather embarrassed, and smoked some time before  answering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;they&rsquo;d put up with a good  deal from you, bein&rsquo; an Australian, don&rsquo;t you know. Fashion just now to make a  lot of fuss over Australian chappies, whatever they do. But two black  women&mdash;rather a large order. You might get married over there, and then these  two black ladies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a startled exclamation from Considine.  &ldquo;Married!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Married! forgot all about my wife. I am married!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;Are you married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs. Married. Yairs! Should just think I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to a lubra, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lubra, no! A hot-tempered faggot of a woman I met at Pike&rsquo;s pub.  I lived with her three weeks and left her there. I haven&rsquo;t seen her this six  years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you and she have some er&mdash;differences, then?&rdquo; said Carew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Differences? No! We had fights&mdash;plenty fights. You see, it was  this way. I hadn&rsquo;t long got these two gins; and just before the rains the wild  geese come down in thousands to breed, and the blacks all clear out and camp by  the lagoons, and kill geese and eat eggs and young ones all day long, till they  near bust. It&rsquo;s the same every year&mdash;when the wild geese come the blacks have  got to go, and it&rsquo;s no use talkin&rsquo;. So I was slavin&rsquo; away here&mdash;out all day on  the run with the cattle&mdash;and one night I comes home after being out three days,  and there at the foot of the bunk was the two gins&rsquo; trousers and shirts, folded  up; they&rsquo;d run away with the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I goes after &rsquo;em down the river to the lagoons, and there was  hundreds of blacks; but these two beauties had heard me coming, and was planted  in the reeds, and the other blacks, of course, they says, &lsquo;No more&rsquo; when I arst  them. So there I was, lonely. Only me and the Chinaman here for two months,  cause his gin had gone too. So one day I ketches the horses, and off I goes,  and travels for days, till I makes Pike&rsquo;s pub, and there was this woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems from what I heard afterwards that she&rsquo;d just cleared out  from some fellow she&rsquo;d been livin&rsquo; with for years&mdash;had a quarrel with him.  Anyhow, I hadn&rsquo;t seen a white woman for years, and she was a fine lump of a  woman, and I got on a bit of a spree for a week or so, you know&mdash;half-tight all  the time; and it seems some sort of a parson&mdash;a mish&rsquo;nary to the blacks&mdash;chanced  along and married us. She had her lines and everything all right, but I don&rsquo;t  remember much about it. So then I&rsquo;m living with her for a bit; but I don&rsquo;t like  her goin&rsquo;s on, and I takes the whip to her once, and she gets snake-headed to  me, and takes up an axe; and then one day comes a black from this place and he  says to me, he says, &lsquo;Old man,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;Maggie and Lucy come back.&rsquo; So then I  says to my wife, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m off back to the run,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s sorry I am that  ever I married you.&rsquo; And she says, &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; out to yer old run, to  get eat up with musketeers.&rsquo; So says I, &lsquo;Please yourself about that, you  faggot,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m off.&rsquo; So off I cleared, and I never seen her from  that day till this. I married her under the name of Keogh, though. Will that  make any difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This legal problem kept them occupied for some time; and, after  much discussion, it was decided that a marriage under a false name could hardly  be valid.</p>
<p>Then weariness, the weariness of open-air, travelling, and hard  work, settled down on them, and they made for the house. On the verandah the  two gins lay sleeping, their figures dimly outlined under mosquito nets; the  dogs crouched about in all sorts of attitudes. Considine turned in all standing  in the big rough bunk, while Carew and Gordon stretched their blankets on the  hard earth floor, made a pillow of their clothes, and lay down to sleep, after  fixing mosquito nets. Gordon slept as soon as he touched the blankets, but  Carew tumbled and tossed. The ground was deadly hard. During the journey Frying  Pan had got grass for their beds; here he had not been told to get it, and it  would have looked effeminate to ask for grass when no one else seemed to want  it. The old man heard him stirring and rolling, and sat up in his bunk. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s  up, Mister?&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you find it a hard camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too easy,&rdquo; said the Englishman. &ldquo;Always seems to be a deuced  hard place just under your hip, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put you right in a brace of shakes,&rdquo; said Considine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got the very thing to make a soft bed. Half a minute now, and I&rsquo;ll get it for  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went out to the back of the house and returned with a dry white  bullock-hide, as rigid as a sheet of iron. This he threw down at Carew&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here y&rsquo;are, Mister; put that under you for a hipper, and you&rsquo;ll  be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carew found the hide nearly as hard as the bare floor, but he  uttered profuse thanks, and said it was quite comfortable; to which the old man  replied that he was sure it must be, and then threw himself back on his bunk  and began snoring at once. But Carew lay long awake.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  The Wild Cattle</b></h2>
<p>Carew awoke next morning to  find that it was broad daylight, and the horses had been run in, caught, and  saddled, all ready for a start to the run. Breakfast was soon disposed of, and  the cavalcade set out. Naturally, the old man had heaps of questions to ask  about his inheritance, and made the Englishman ride alongside while he  questioned him. </p>
<p>&ldquo;If I go to England  after this money, Mister, I suppose they won&rsquo;t be handin&rsquo; me out ten years for  perjury, same as they done for Roger Tichborne? I won&rsquo;t have no law case, will  I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t think so. You&rsquo;ve been advertised for all over the  place, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Well, now they&rsquo;ve got me they mightn&rsquo;t like me, don&rsquo;t you  see? I never took no stock in them unclaimed-money fakes. I never see any money  goin&rsquo; beggin&rsquo; yet, long as I&rsquo;ve lived, but what some chap had his hands on it  quick enough. But I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me wife I&rsquo;m troublin&rsquo; about. I&rsquo;m no dandy, Goodness knows,  but if people&rsquo;ll let me alone I&rsquo;ll let them alone, and I don&rsquo;t interfere with  anyone. But if old Peg turns up, she&rsquo;ll want to be right in front of the  percession. If she follows me, I&rsquo;ll realise everything by public auction,  unreserved sale, for spot cash, and I&rsquo;ll sneak back here to a place I knows of,  where there&rsquo;s no trooper can find me. I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; halves with that woman, I  tell you. She wouldn&rsquo;t stick to me if I was poor, and I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to take her  up again now. You&rsquo;d better come back with me, Mister, and show me the way round  a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a mob of cattle, Gordon,&rdquo; he went on, changing the  subject quickly; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s ride up here, while the boys bring &rsquo;em into camp.&rdquo; And  off they went at a canter, leaving the question of his social prospects in  abeyance for the time being.</p>
<p>The ceremony of taking delivery lasted some days, Considine&rsquo;s  signature to the deed of transfer being only the first step. This long  document, prepared in Sydney,  kept them going in literature for about a week; and they were delighted to find  that, through the carelessness of a clerk, in one part of the deed there  figured &ldquo;one bull of mixed sexes and various ages&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rode out, day after day, through interminable stretches of  dull timbered country, or over blazing plains waving with long grass. Here they  came on mobs of half-wild cattle, all bearing the same brand, a huge RL5. These  were not mustered into a yard or counted, except roughly. Gordon was not  completing a purchase, but simply taking over what were there&mdash;many or few, good  or bad, he could only take what he found.</p>
<p>Miles and miles they rode, always in the blazing heat, camping for  a couple of hours in the middle of the day. To the Englishman it seemed always  the merest chance that they found the cattle, and accident that they got home  again. At rare intervals they came upon substantial mustering-yards, where the  calves were brought for branding; near these a rough hut had been constructed,  so that they could camp there at night, instead of returning to the head  station.</p>
<p>They always slept out of doors. In the intense heat it was no  hardship, and the huts, as a rule, fairly jumped with fleas. Once they camped  alongside a big lagoon, on whose surface were huge pink and blue water-lilies  and rushes, and vast flocks of wild fowl. After the stretches of blazing plain  and dull timber this glimpse of water was inexpressibly refreshing. On their  way back they struck new country, great stretches of almost impenetrable scrub,  tropical jungle, and belts of bamboo. In this cover wild cattle evidently  abounded, for they frequently heard the bellow of the bulls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be a terrible lot of wild cattle here,&rdquo; said  Charlie. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever get any out of the scrubs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we moonlight for &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Considine. &ldquo;We take coachers  out. We have a very fair coaching mob. Some of our coachers are as quick as  racehorses, and they&rsquo;ll hustle wild cattle away from the scrub just as if they  understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by coachers?&rdquo; asked Carew. &ldquo;Not cattle that go  in carts, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carts, no. The way we get wild cattle hereabouts is to take out a  mob of quiet cattle, what we call coachers, and let &rsquo;em feed in the moonlight  alongside the scrub, while we wait back out o&rsquo; the road and watch &rsquo;em. When the  wild cattle come out, they run over to see the coachers, and we dash up and cut  &rsquo;em off from the scrub, and hustle &rsquo;em together into the open. It&rsquo;s good sport,  Mister. We might try a dash at it, if you like, before we go back; it&rsquo;s moonlight  now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a try tonight,&rdquo; said Cordon. &ldquo;Are your coachers  handy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs. They feed near the house. I&rsquo;ll send &rsquo;em on with the gins  tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they got back that evening, Carew was so dead-tired that he  wished the wild cattle expedition at Jericho.  But Considine and Charlie were in great form, directing, arguing, and planning  the expedition. One of the black boys rode out, and returned driving a big mob  of horses that dashed into the yard at full gallop. The gins and the black boys  caught fresh mounts out of these and started away, driving some fifty head of  cattle selected from a mob that made their headquarters within a few miles of  the house. Most of them were old stagers, and strung away in the evening quite  tranquilly, while the blacks, always smoking, rode listlessly after. Considine  produced two stockwhips, and gave one to Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good givin&rsquo; you one, Mister,&rdquo; he said to Carew. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d hang  yourself with it most likely. I&rsquo;ve got a rare good horse for you&mdash;old Smoked  Beef. He&rsquo;d moonlight cattle by himself, believe. You&rsquo;d better have a pistol,  though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Carew, as Considine produced three very heavy  navy revolvers and a bag of cartridges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To shoot any beast that won&rsquo;t stay with the mob. Some of &rsquo;em  won&rsquo;t be stopped. They have to go. Well, if one goes, the rest keep trying to  follow, and no forty men will hold &rsquo;em back. You just keep your eyes open, and  if a beast breaks out in spite of the whips, you shoot him if the blacks tell  you. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I to shoot him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot him any place. In the earhole, or the shoulder, or the  ribs, or the flank. Any place at all. Shoot him all over if you like. One or  two bullets don&rsquo;t hurt a beast. It takes a lead-mine to kill some of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the blacks shoot?&rdquo; asked Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t never trust no blacks with firearms. One boy knifes  well, though. Races alongside and knifes &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed a fairly difficult performance; while the Englishman  was wondering how it would be carried out, they made a start. They rode mile  after mile in the yellow moonlight, until they discerned a mob of cattle  feeding placidly near some big scrub. They whistled to the blacks, and all rode  away down wind to a spot on the edge of the plain, a considerable distance from  the cattle.</p>
<p>Here they dismounted and waited, Considine and Charlie talking  occasionally in low tones, while the blacks sat silent, holding their horses.  Carew lay down on the long dry grass and gazed away over the plain. His horse  stood over him with head down, apparently sleeping. Far away under the moon, in  vague patches of light and shade, the cattle were feeding. Hours seemed to  pass, and Carew almost fell asleep.</p>
<p>Suddenly a long-drawn bellow, the angry challenge of a bull, broke  the silence. A mob of wild cattle were evidently coming along the edge of the  scrub, and had caught scent of the strangers. Again the bull roared; there is  no animal on earth with so emphatically warlike a note as the wild bull when  advancing to meet a strange mob. The quiet cattle answered with plaintive,  long-drawn lowings, and the din became general as the two lots met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em get well mixed up,&rdquo; said Considine quietly, tightening  his girths, and swinging into the saddle. Everyone followed his example. Carew  was shaking with excitement. Angry bellowing now arose from the cattle, which  were apparently horning one another&mdash;such being their manner of greeting.</p>
<p>Considine said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big lot there. Hope to blazes we can  hold &rsquo;em. Are you ready, Mister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; replied Carew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then. We&rsquo;ll sneak up slowly at first, but once I start  galloping let your horse go as fast as he likes, and trust him altogether.  Don&rsquo;t pull him at all, or he&rsquo;ll break your neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started slowly in Indian file, keeping well in the shadow of  the scrub. The horses picked their way through the outlying saplings and  bushes, until suddenly Considine bent forward on his horse&rsquo;s neck, and said,  &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a ride that was! The inexperienced reader is apt to imagine  that because a plain is level, it is smooth, but no greater fallacy exists. The  surface of a plain is always bad galloping.</p>
<p>The rain washes away the soil from between the tussocks, which  stand up like miniature mountains; the heat cracks the ground till it opens in  crevices, sometimes a foot wide and a yard or two deep; fallen saplings lie  hidden in the shadows to trip the horse, while the stumps stand up to cripple  him, and over all is the long grass hiding all perils, and making the horse  risk his own neck and his master&rsquo;s at every stride.</p>
<p>They flew along in the moonlight, Considine leading, Charlie next,  then the two black boys, and then Carew, with a black gin on each side of him,  racing in grim silence. The horses blundered and &ldquo;pecked&rdquo;, stumbled, picked  themselves up again, always seeming to have a leg to spare. Now and again a  stump or a gaping crack in the ground would flash into view under their very  nose, but they cleared everything&mdash;stumps, tussocks, gaps, and saplings.</p>
<p>In less time than it takes to write, they were between the mob and  the scrub; at once a fusillade of whips rang out, and the men started to ride  round the cattle in Indian file. The wild ones were well mixed up with the  tame, and hardly knew which way to turn. Carew, cantering round, caught  glimpses of them rushing hither and thither&mdash;small, wiry cattle for the most  part, with big ears and sharp, spear-pointed horns. Of these there were fifty  or sixty, as near as Considine could judge&mdash;three or four bulls, a crowd of cows  and calves and half-grown animals, and a few old bullocks that had left the  station mobs and thrown in their lot with the wild ones.</p>
<p>By degrees, as the horses went round them, the cattle began to  &ldquo;ring&rdquo;, forming themselves into a compact mass, those on the outside running  round and round. All the time the whips were going, and the shrill cries of the  blacks rang out, &ldquo;Whoa back! Whoa back, there! Whoa!&rdquo; as an animal attempted to  break from the mob. They were gradually forcing the beasts away from the scrub,  when suddenly, in spite of the gins&rsquo; shrill cries, some of the leaders broke  out and set off up the plain; with the rush of a cavalry charge the rest were  after them, racing at full speed parallel with the edge of the scrub, and  always trying to make over towards it.</p>
<p>Old Considine met this new development with Napoleonic quickness.  He and the others formed a line parallel with the course of the cattle, and  raced along between them and the timber, keeping up an incessant fusillade with  their whips, while the old man&rsquo;s voice rang out loudly in directions to the  blacks behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep the coachers with &rsquo;em! Flog &rsquo;em along! Cut the hides off  &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first rush the quiet cattle had dropped to the rear, but  the blacks set about them with their whips; and, as they were experienced  coachers, and had been flogged and hustled along in similar rushes so often  that they knew at once what was wanted, they settled down to race just as fast  as the wild ones. As the swaying, bellowing mass swept along in the moonlight,  crashing and trampling through the light outlying timber, some of the coachers  were seen working their way to the lead, and the wild cattle having no settled  plan, followed them blindly. Considine, on his black horse, was close up by the  wing of the mob, and the others rode in line behind him, always keeping between  the cattle and the scrub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crack your whips!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Crack your whips! Keep &rsquo;em off the  scrub! Go on, Billy, drive that horse along and get to the lead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a flash one of the black boys darted out of the line,  galloped to the head of the cattle, and rode there, pursued by the flying mob,  the cracks of his heavy stockwhip sounding above the roar of hoofs and the  bellowing of the cattle. Soon they steadied a little, and gradually sobered  down till they stopped and began to &ldquo;ring&rdquo; again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was pretty pure, eh, Mister?&rdquo; roared Considine to Carew.  &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it a caution the way the coachers race with &rsquo;em? That old bald-face  coacher is worth two men and a boy in a dash like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly an old bull, the patriarch of the wild herd, made towards  one of the gins, whose shrill yells and whip-cracking failed to turn him.  Considine dashed to her assistance, swinging his whip round his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa back, there! Whoa back, will you!&rdquo; he shouted. The bull  paused irresolute for a second, and half-turned back to the mob, but the sight  or scent of his native scrub decided him. Dropping his head, he charged  straight at Considine. So sudden was the attack that the stockhorse had barely  time to spring aside; but, quick as it was, Considine&rsquo;s revolver was quicker.  The bull passed&mdash;bang! went the revolver, and bang! bang! bang! again, as the  horse raced alongside, Considine leaning over and firing into the bull&rsquo;s ribs  at very short range.</p>
<p>The other cattle, dazed by the firing, did not attempt to follow,  and at the fourth shot the bull wheeled to charge. He stood a moment in the  moonlight, bold and defiant, then staggered a little and looked round as though  to say, &ldquo;What have you done to me?&rdquo; Bang! went the revolver again; the animal  lurched, plunged forward, sank on his knees, and fell over on his side, dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you swab,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll larn you to break  another time.&rdquo; Then he took once more his place in the patrol round the mob.  They circled and eddied and pushed, always staring angrily at the riders.  Suddenly a big, red bullock gave a snort of defiance, and came out straight  towards Carew. He stopped once, shook his head ominously, and came on again.  One of the gins dashed up with the whip; but the bullock had evidently decided  to take all chances, and advanced on his foes at a trot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choot him, that feller!&rdquo; screamed the gin to Carew. &ldquo;You choot  him! He bin yan away! No more stop! Choot him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carew lugged out his revolver, and tried to pull his horse to a  standstill, but the wary old veteran knew better than to be caught standing by  a charging bullock; just as Carew fired, he plunged forward, with the result  that the bullet went over the mob altogether, and very nearly winged Charlie,  who was riding on the far side. Then the bullock charged in earnest; and  Carew&rsquo;s horse, seeing that if he wished to save human life he must take matters  into his own hands, made a bolt for it. Carew half-turned in the saddle, and  fired twice, only making the black boys on the far side cower down on their  horses&rsquo; necks. Then the horse took complete charge, and made off for the scrub  with the bullock after him, and every animal in the mob after the bullock.</p>
<p>Nothing in the world could have stopped them. Considine and  Charlie raced in front, alongside Carew, cracking their whips and shouting; the  blacks flogged the coachers up with the wild cattle; but they held on their  way, plunged with a mighty crash into the thick timber, and were lost. No  horseman could ride a hundred yards in that timber at night. Coachers and all  were gone together, and the dispirited hunters gathered at the edge of the  scrub and looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mister, you couldn&rsquo;t stop him,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I made&mdash;rather a mess of things, don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; said  the Englishman. &ldquo;I thought I hit him the second time, too. Seemed to be  straight at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you done very well to miss us! I heard one bullet whiz  past me like a scorpyun. Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped. Those old coachers will all  battle their way home again before long. Gordon, I vote we go home. They&rsquo;re  your cattle now, and you&rsquo;ll have to come out again after &rsquo;em some day, and do a  little more shootin&rsquo;. Get a suit of armour on you first, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they jogged home through the bright moonlight, they heard loud  laughter from the blacks, and Carew, looking back, found the fat gin giving a  dramatic rehearsal of his exploits. She dashed her horse along at a great pace,  fell on his neck, clutched wildly at the reins, then suddenly turned in her  saddle, and pretended to fire point-blank at the other blacks, who all dodged  the bullet. Then she fell on the horse&rsquo;s neck again, and so on&nbsp;<i>ad lib</i>.</p>
<p>This made the Englishman very morose. He was quite glad when  Charlie said he had seen enough of the cattle, and they would all start next  day for civilisation&mdash;Charlie to resume the management of Mr Grant&rsquo;s stations,  Carew to go with him as &ldquo;colonial experiencer&rdquo;, and Considine to start for  England to look after his inheritance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  A Chance Encounter</b></h2>
<p>The black boys went in with them to  Pike&rsquo;s store to take back supplies on the packhorse. They travelled over the  same country that they had seen coming up; the men at the stations greeted them  with the same hospitality. Nothing was said about Considine&rsquo;s good fortune. It  was thought wise to be silent, as he didn&rsquo;t know how soon his wife might hear  of it. </p>
<p>They left the gins at the blacks&rsquo; camp, which they chanced on by a  riverside. The camp was a primitive affair, a few rude shelters made by bending  bamboo sticks together and covering them with strips of paper bark. Here the  sable warriors sat and smoked all day long, tobacco being their only civilised  possession. Carew was very anxious to look at them, a development of curiosity  that Considine could not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most uninteresting devils, I call &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re stark  naked, and they have nothing. What is there to look at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having parted with Maggie and Lucy, they pushed onwards, the old  man beguiling the time with disquisitions on the horse-hunting capabilities of  his gins, whom he seemed really sorry to leave. As they got near Pike&rsquo;s, he  became more restless than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Mister,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;my wife&rsquo;s here, I expect,  and if she gets wind of this, I&rsquo;ll never get rid of her. The only thing to do  is to slip away without her knowing, and she might never hear of it. I won&rsquo;t go  into the place at all. I&rsquo;ll go on and camp down the creek, and get the coach  there after it leaves the town, and she&rsquo;ll never know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The town of &ldquo;Pike&rsquo;s&rdquo; consisted of a hotel, a store, a post-office,  a private residence, and coachstables; these were all combined in one  establishment, so the town couldn&rsquo;t be said to be scattered.</p>
<p>Pike himself was landlord of the &ldquo;pub&rdquo;, keeper of the store,  officer in charge of the post-office, owner of the private residence, holder of  the mail contract, and proprietor of the coach-stables. Behind him was only  wilderness and &ldquo;new&rdquo; country.</p>
<p>Nobody ever saw him at home. Either he was on the road with a  bullock-team, bringing up supplies for the hotel and store, or he was droving  cattle down on a six months&rsquo; journey to market; or he was away looking at new  country, or taking supplies out to men on the half-provisioned stations of the  &ldquo;outerback&rdquo;; or else he was off to some new mining camp or opal-field, to sell  a dray-load of goods at famine prices.</p>
<p>When Charlie and Carew rode up to the store they did not see Pike,  nor did they expect to see him. By some mysterious Providence they had arrived  the very day the coach started on its monthly trip down to Barcoo; and in front  of the hotel were congregated quite a number of people&mdash;Pike&rsquo;s wife and his  half-wild children, a handful of bushmen, station-hands, opal miners, and  what-not, and last, but not least, a fat lady of about forty summers, with  flaring red hair.</p>
<p>She was a fine &ldquo;lump&rdquo; of a woman, with broad shoulders, and nearly  the same breadth all the way down to her feet. She wore a rusty black dress,  which fitted perilously tight to her arms and bust; on her head was a lopsided,  dismantled black bonnet with a feather&mdash;a bonnet that had evidently been put away  in a drawer and forgotten for years. Any want of colour or style in her dress  was amply made up for by the fact that she positively glowed with opals. Her  huge, thick fingers twinkled with opal rings; from each of her ears there  dangled an opal earring the size of a florin; her old dress was secured round  her thick, muscular neck by a brooch that looked like an opal quarry, and  whenever she turned to the sun she flashed out rays like a lighthouse.</p>
<p>Her face was fat and red, full of a sort of good-humoured ferocity;  she moved like a queen among the by-standers, and shook hands gravely with each  and all of them. She was hot, but very dignified.</p>
<p>Evidently she was preparing to start in the coach, for she packed  into the vehicle with jealous care a large carpet-bag of garish colouring that  seemed to harmonise well with the opals. While she was packing this away,  Charlie and Carew went into the store, and bought such supplies as were needed  for the establishment at No Man&rsquo;s Land. Gordon took the opportunity to ask the  shock-headed old storekeeper, Pike&rsquo;s deputy, some questions about the lady, who  was still scintillating between the coach and the house, carrying various small  articles each trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yer know &rsquo;er?&rdquo; said the man, in much the same tone  that&nbsp;Bret  Harte&rsquo;s hero&nbsp;must have used when he was so taken aback to find that a  stranger&mdash;</p>
<p align="center">Didn&rsquo;t know Flynn&mdash;<br>
  Flynn of Virginia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yer know &rsquo;er?&rdquo; he repeated, pausing in his task of scooping  some black cockroachy sugar from the bottom of a bin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Hopal Queen!  She&rsquo;s hoff South, she is. Yer&rsquo;ll be going in the coach, will yer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going in the coach. There&rsquo;s no extra  fare for travelling with such a swell, is there? Where on earth did she get all  those opals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, blokes gives &rsquo;em to &rsquo;er, passin&rsquo; back from the hopal fields.  In the rough, yer know! Hopal in the rough, well, it&rsquo;s &rsquo;ard to tell what it&rsquo;ll  turn out, and they&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;er a &rsquo;unk as sometimes turns out a fair dazzler.  She&rsquo;s a hay-one judge of it in the rough, too. If she buys a bit of hopal, yer  bet yer life it ain&rsquo;t a bad bit when it&rsquo;s cut. What about these &rsquo;ere stores?  Goin&rsquo; to take &rsquo;em with yer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;The black boy is here for them. He&rsquo;s going to  take them back with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Keogh&rsquo;s black boy! Well, I don&rsquo;t know as Pike&rsquo;ll stand old  Paddy Keogh any longer. Paddy&rsquo;s &rsquo;ad a dorg tied hup &rsquo;ere&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, an  account outstanding) &ldquo;this two years, and last time Pike was &rsquo;ome &rsquo;e was reck&rsquo;nin&rsquo;  it was about hup to Keogh to pay something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not for Keogh,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re for me. I&rsquo;ve taken  Keogh&rsquo;s block over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at him dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but y&rsquo;aint goin&rsquo; to tie hup no dorg on us for &rsquo;em, are yer?  s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s all right, though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, yes,&rdquo; said Gordon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Mr Grant, Old Man  Grant&mdash;you&rsquo;ve heard of Grant of Kuryong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never &rsquo;eard of him,&rdquo; said the aged man, &ldquo;but it makes no hodds.  Pay when yer like. Yer&rsquo;d better git on the coach, for I see the Hopal Queen&rsquo;s  ready for a start. Yer&rsquo;ll know her all right before long, I bet. Some of the  fellers from round about &rsquo;as come in to give her a send-off like. There&rsquo;s the  coach ready; yer&rsquo;d better git aboard, and yer&rsquo;ll hear the&mdash;the send-off like.  Young Stacy out there reckons &rsquo;e&rsquo;s going to make a speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie and Carew climbed upon the coach. The fat lady kissed  Pike&rsquo;s wife and children with great solemnity. &ldquo;Goodbye, Alice! Goodbye, Nora darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said. Then  she marched in a stately way towards the vehicle, with the children forming a  bodyguard round her. A group of men hung about uneasily, looked sheepish, and  waved large, helpless red hands, till a young fellow about seven feet high&mdash;who  looked more uneasy and had even larger hands than the rest&mdash;was hustled forward,  and began to mutter something that nobody could hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak up, George,&rdquo; said a friend. The young man raised his voice  to a shout, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I propose three cheers and long life to the Hopal Queen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he ran two or three paces forward towards a stump,  meaning, no doubt, to get on it and lead the cheering; but, just as he was  going to jump, a wretched little mongrel that had been in and out among the  people&rsquo;s feet made a dash at him, fixed its teeth in the calf of his leg, and  ran away howling at its own temerity. The young giant rushed after it, but the  Opal Queen interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ye dare go for to kick my dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did he bite me for, then?&rdquo; said the giant, speaking  out now in a voice that could be heard half a mile off. &ldquo;What did he bite me  for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, George! Don&rsquo;t ye go for to kick him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Opal Queen, snorting like a grampus, climbed into the coach;  the driver cracked his whip, and off they went, leaving the audience  spellbound, and the gigantic young man rubbing his leg. Soon Pike&rsquo;s faded away  in the distance. As the coach jolted along, Carew and Charlie on the box seat  occasionally peered in at the large swaying figure who was half-hidden in the  dust.</p>
<p>About two miles out of town, Considine, with all his earthly  belongings in a small valise, stopped the coach and got on board, sitting in  front with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a look inside,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman in there  looks rather like&mdash;the lady you were talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considine looked in. Then he sank back in his seat, with a white  face. &ldquo;By Heavens!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is funny,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;Wonder what she&rsquo;s after. She must  have heard, somehow. She&rsquo;ll never lose sight of you, now, Considine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the driver struck into the conversation. &ldquo;See her inside?&rdquo; he  said, indicating the inside passenger with a nod of his head. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s off to Sydney, full rip. She  reckons her husband&rsquo;s dead, and she&rsquo;s came in for a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she reckons he&rsquo;s dead, does she?&rdquo; said Charlie carelessly.  &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know she had a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, yes,&rdquo; said the driver. &ldquo;She came up here passin&rsquo; by the name  of Keogh, but it seems that ain&rsquo;t her husband&rsquo;s name at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed! Do you happen to have heard what her husband&rsquo;s name  is? And when did he die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard the noo husband&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; replied the driver. &ldquo;Keogh  was her name. I dessay if I arst her she&rsquo;d tell me. Shall I arst her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Considine firmly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t annoy her at all. Leave well  alone, young feller. What odds is it to you how many husbands the poor woman  has had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the driver dispassionately. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no odds to me, nor  yet to you, I don&rsquo;t suppose. She&rsquo;s in for a real big thing, I believe. A  telegram came to the telegraph station after I left last trip, and young Jack Sheehan,  he brought it on after me&mdash;rode a hundred miles pretty well, to ketch me up. He  reckoned she was coming in for a hundred thousand pounds. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind  marryin&rsquo; her meself, if it&rsquo;s true; plenty worse-looking sorts than her about.  What do you think, eh, Mister?&rdquo; addressing Considine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry her, and be blowed,&rdquo; said that worthy, sociably; and the  driver stiffened and refused to talk further on the subject.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the three discussed the matter in low tones. It was  practically impossible that anyone could have heard of the identity of Keogh  with the missing Considine. How then had the story got about that her husband  was dead, and that she had come into money? She must have seen Considine get on  the coach, but she had made no sign. Their astonishment was deeper than ever  when the coach stopped for a midday halt. It was quite impossible for Considine  to conceal himself. The house, where the coach changed horses, was a  galvanised-iron, one-roomed edifice in the middle of a glaring expanse of  treeless plain, in which a quail could scarcely have hidden successfully. It  was clear that Considine and his wife would have to come face to face.</p>
<p>Carew and Charlie looked expectantly at each other, and clambered  down quickly when the coach stopped. Considine descended more slowly;  straightening his figure and looking fixedly before him, he marched up to the  door of the change-house.</p>
<p>His wife got leisurely out of the coach, put on her bonnet, and  walked straight over to him; then she looked him full in the face for at least  three seconds, and passed by without a sign of recognition.</p>
<p>The three men looked at each other. &ldquo;Well, this bangs all,&rdquo; said  Considine. &ldquo;She knew me all right. Why didn&rsquo;t she speak? She&rsquo;s afraid I&rsquo;ll  clear out, and she&rsquo;s shammin&rsquo; not to know me, so&rsquo;s she&rsquo;ll have me arrested as  soon as she sights a bobby. I know her. Perhaps I&rsquo;d better offer her something  to go back and leave me alone, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was vetoed by a majority of two to one, and once more the  coach started. They plodded away on the weary, dusty journey, until the iron  roofs and walls of Barcoo gleamed like a mirage in the distance, and the coach  rolled up to the hotel. A telegraph official came lounging forward. &ldquo;Anyone  here the name of Charles Gordon?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telegram for you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been all over the country after  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gordon tore it open, read it, and stood spellbound. Then he  silently handed it to Carew. It was several weeks old, and was from Pinnock,  the solicitor. It read as follows&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;William Grant died suddenly yesterday. Will  made years ago leaves everything to his wife. Reported that he married Margaret  Donohoe, and that she is still alive. Am making all inquiries. Wire me anything  you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie&rsquo;s face never changed a muscle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s lively!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He never married that woman; and, if he  did, she died long ago.&rdquo; As he spoke, the lady passenger, having had some talk  with the hotel people, came over to him with a beaming smile. &ldquo;And ye&rsquo;re  Charlie Gordon,&rdquo; she said with a mellifluous mixture of brogue and bush drawl.  &ldquo;An&rsquo; ye don&rsquo;t know me now, a little bit? Ye were a little felly when we last  met. I&rsquo;m Peggy Donohoe that was&mdash;Peggy Grant now, since I married poor dear  Grant that&rsquo;s dead. And, sure, rest his sowl!&rdquo;&mdash;here she sniffed a little&mdash;&ldquo;though  he treated me cruel bad, so he did! Ye&rsquo;ll remember me brother Mick&mdash;Mick with  the red hair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Charlie, slowly and deliberately, &ldquo;I remember him  well; and you too. And look here, Peggy Donohoe&mdash;or Peggy Keogh, whichever you  call yourself&mdash;you and Red Mick will have the most uphill fight you ever fought  before you get one sixpence of William Grant&rsquo;s money. Why, your real husband is  here on the coach with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and pulled Considine forward, and once more husband and  wife stood face to face.</p>
<p>Considine, alias Keogh, smiled in a sickly way, tried to meet his  wife&rsquo;s eyes, and failed altogether. She regarded him with a bold, unwinking  stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Him me husban&rsquo;! This old crockerdile? I never  seen him before in me life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of hopeless perplexity settled on Considine&rsquo;s features for  a moment, and then a ray of intelligence seemed to break in on him. She  repeated her statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never seen this man before in me life. Did I? Speak up, now,  and say, did I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considine hesitated for a moment in visible distress. Then,  pulling himself together, and looking boldly from one to the other, he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that you mention it, ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t think as ever you did. I  must ha&rsquo; made some mistake.&rdquo; He walked rapidly away, leaving Gordon and Peggy  face to face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There y&rsquo;are,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what did I tell ye? Husban&rsquo;? He&rsquo;s no  husban&rsquo; o&rsquo; mine. Ye&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; a mistake, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie looked after the retreating bushman, and back at the good  lady who was beaming at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Charlie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That old man has come in for a  whole lot of money in England.  His name is Considine, and he pretends he isn&rsquo;t your husband so that he can get  the money and leave you out of it. Don&rsquo;t you be a fool. It&rsquo;s a lot better for  you to stick to him than to try for William Grant&rsquo;s money. Mr Carew and I can  prove he said you were his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och, look at that now! Said I was his wife! And his name was  Considine, the lyin&rsquo; old vaggybond. His name&rsquo;s not Considine, and I&rsquo;m not his  wife, nor never was. Grant was my husban&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;ll prove it in a coort of law,  so I will!&rdquo; Her voice began to rise like a south-easterly gale, and Charlie  beat a retreat. He went to look for the old man, but could not find him  anywhere.</p>
<p>Talking the matter over with Carew he got no satisfaction from the  wisdom of that Solon. &ldquo;Deuced awkward thing, don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; was his only  comment.</p>
<p>Things were even more awkward when the coach drew up to start, and  no sign of the old man could be found. He had strolled off to the back of the  hotel, and vanished as absolutely as if the earth had swallowed him.</p>
<p>The Chinese cook was well and truly cross-questioned, but relapsed  into idiotic smiles and plentiful &ldquo;No savvees&rdquo;. A blackfellow, leafing about  the back of the hotel, was asked if he had seen a tall, thin old man with a  beard going down the street. He said, &ldquo;Yowi, he bin go longa other pub&rdquo;; but  as, on further questioning, he modified his statement by asserting that the man  he saw was young, short and very fat, no heed was paid to his evidence&mdash;it being  the habit of blacks to give any answer that they think will please the  questioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll play us some dog&rsquo;s trick, that old fellow,&rdquo; said Charlie.  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait here looking for him, though. I&rsquo;ll find him when I want him if  he&rsquo;s above ground. Now let&rsquo;s go on. Can&rsquo;t keep the coach waiting for ever while  we unearth him. Let&rsquo;s get aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as the coach was about to start a drover came out of the bar  of the hotel, wiping his lips with the back of his hand. He stared vacantly  about him, first up the street and then down, looked hard at a post in front of  the hotel, then stared up and down the street again. At last he walked over,  and, addressing the passengers in a body, said, &ldquo;Did any of you&rsquo;s see e&rsquo;er a  horse anywheres? I left my prad here, and he&rsquo;s gorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A by-stander, languidly cutting up a pipeful of tobacco, jerked  his elbow down the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old bloke took &rsquo;im,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Old bloke that come in the  coach. While yous was all talking in the pub, he sneaks out here and nabs that  &rsquo;orse, and away like a rabbit. See that dust on the plain? That&rsquo;s &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The drover looked helplessly out over the stretch of plain. He  seemed quite incapable of grappling with the problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took my horse, did he? Well, I&rsquo;m blowed! By Cripes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had another good stare over the plain, and back at the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Then the natural stoicism of the bushman came to his aid, and he  said, in a resigned tone, &ldquo;Oh, well, anyways, I s&rsquo;pose&mdash;s&rsquo;pose he must have been  in a hurry to go somewheres. I s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;ll fetch him back some time or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gordon leant down from the box of the coach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when he does fetch him back, that if I&rsquo;d  had a rifle, and had seen him sneaking off like that he&rsquo;d have wanted an  ambulance before he got much farther. Tell him I&rsquo;ll find him if I have to hunt  him to death. Tell him that, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mister!&rdquo; said the drover, obligingly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horses plunged into their collars; off went the coach into  long stretches of dusty road, with the fat red lady inside, and our two friends  outside. And in course of time they found themselves once more in Sydney, where they took  the earliest opportunity to call on Pinnock, and hold a council of war against  Peggy.</p>

  A Consultation at Kiley&rsquo;s</b></h2>
<p>Within twenty-four hours  after Peggy got back to her old home, it was known all over the mountains that  she meant business, and would make a claim on William Grant&rsquo;s estate. Rumour,  of course, supplied all the needful details. It was said, and even sworn to,  that Peggy had her marriage lines put by in a big iron box, ready to be  produced at the proper time. Other authorities knew for a fact that she had no  proofs, but that the family at Kuryong were going to give her any sum from a  thousand pounds to a million, to cancel her claim and save exposure. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, none of those who talked knew anything  whatever. Peggy confided in no one but Red Mick, and that worthy had had enough  legal experience of a rough and ready sort to know that things must be kept  quiet till the proper time. But by way of getting ready for action Red Mick and  his sister one fine morning rode up to Cavan Blake&rsquo;s office to consult him as  to what they should do.</p>
<p>Blake was not at all surprised to see them. He, of course, had  heard all the rumours that were afloat, and knew that if Peggy brought forward  any claim he would be asked to act for her professionally. He had not quite  decided whether he would act or not. In his hard commonsense mind he saw next  to no possibility of Peggy having a&nbsp;<i>bon&acirc; fide</i>&nbsp;case. He did not  suppose for a moment that William Grant would have run his neck into a bigamy  noose; and it would put the young lawyer in a very awkward position with Mary  Grant if, after saving her life and posing as her friend, he carried on a  blackmailing suit against her. At the same time, he felt that it could do no  harm to either side to investigate Peggy&rsquo;s case; there might be awkward things  that he could help to suppress. So with expectancy and not a little amusement  he saw his clients ride up and tie their horses to the fence outside his  office, and watched Peggy straighten her ruffled plumage before entering.</p>
<p>They came in at the door with a seriousness worthy of the  occasion. Peggy heaved a subdued sigh and settled in a chair. Red Mick opened  the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; to you, Gavan,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>By virtue of his relationship Mick was privileged to call his  brilliant nephew by his Christian name. To the rest of the clans Gavan was Mr  Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mick. Good morning, Peggy. Have you had any rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the bush no one would think of introducing discussion without a  remark about the weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jist a few drops,&rdquo; said Red Mick gloomily. &ldquo;Do us no good at all.  Things is looking terrible bad, so they are. But we want to see ye&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and here  he dropped his voice, rose, and cautiously closed the door&mdash;&ldquo;Peggy here, Mrs  Grant, d&rsquo;ye see,&rdquo;&mdash;Mick got the name out without an effort&mdash;&ldquo;she wants to see ye  about making a claim on the estate. &rsquo;Tis time she done somethin&rsquo;. All these  years left to shift for herself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Blake broke in on him. He meant to probe Peggy&rsquo;s case  thoroughly, and knew that it would be no easy matter to get at the truth while  she had Red Mick alongside to prompt her. He had not dealt with the mountain  folk for nothing, and handled his clients in a way that would astonish a more  conservative practitioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you go over to Isaacstein&rsquo;s store and wait till  I send for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want Mick to be wid me,&rdquo; began Peggy.</p>
<p>Blake blazed up. He knew that he must keep his ascendancy over  these wild people by force of determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard what I said,&rdquo; he thundered, turning fiercely on Peggy.  &ldquo;You want this and you want that! It&rsquo;s not what you want, it&rsquo;s what I want! You  do what you&rsquo;re told. If you don&rsquo;t&mdash;I won&rsquo;t help you. Mick, you go over to the  store, and wait till I send for you.&rdquo; And Mick shambled off.</p>
<p>Peggy, still inclined to be defiant, settled herself in her chair.  She had battled in north Queensland  so long that she neither feared nor respected anybody; but her native  shrewdness told her she had all to gain and nothing to lose by doing what her  lawyer advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Peggy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you want to make a claim against  William Grant&rsquo;s estate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the ground that you&rsquo;re his widow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis. I&rsquo;ll tell yer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t tell me anything. I&rsquo;ll tell you. If you are to have  any hope of succeeding in this case, you must furnish me with the name of the  priest or parson who married you, the place where you were married, and the  date. It must be a real priest or parson, a real place, and a real date. It&rsquo;s  no use coming along with a story of a marriage by a parson and you&rsquo;ve forgotten  his name, at a place you can&rsquo;t remember where it was, and a date that&rsquo;s slipped  your memory. You must have a story to tell, and it must hold water. Now, can you  tell such a story? Have you got any proofs at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy shifted about uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I see Mick?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can not. You must out with it here and now. Listen to me,  Peggy,&rdquo; he went on, sinking his voice suddenly and looking hard at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got to know all about this. It&rsquo;s no use keeping anything back. Were you ever  married to William Grant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy dropped her voice too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis. I was married twenty-five years ago at a place called Pike&rsquo;s  pub, out in the Never-Never country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who read the service, parson or priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither. A mish&rsquo;nary. Mish&rsquo;nary to the blacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he died out there. He was sick then, wid the Queensland fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Nettleship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the marriage ever registered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorra one of me knows. He give us each a bit of paper&mdash;our  marriage lines. &rsquo;Twas written in pencil. He had no ink in the place, and he had  no books wid him. He tore the sheet of paper and give us each half, wid the  writing on it; his horses got stole and he had to camp there. He stayed round  wid Pike and the blacks till he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is the certificate? Have you lost it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sint mine down to Mick to keep for me&mdash;jist a bit of paper  written in pencil it was&mdash;and it got lost some ways; but I have a copy of it I  med at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the copy now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Mick&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell Mick to bring it in. Now where is this place,  Pike&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out this side of the opal-fields. It&rsquo;s wild and rough now, but  what it was then&mdash;well &rsquo;twas more like a black&rsquo;s camp nor a white man&rsquo;s place at  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake thought the story had gone far enough. He did not believe a  word of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Peggy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have given the place, the date,  the name of the parson, and everything. Now you know that if you are telling a  lie it will be easily found out. They will soon find out if there was such a  missionary, and if he was up there at the time, and if Mr Grant was up there;  and if you are caught out in a lie it may go hard with you. Have you any  witnesses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin Doyle was there, Black Martin&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Martin Doyle that&rsquo;s out at the nine-mile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis. He was up driving the buggy and horses for Grant. He can  swear to the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake sat back in his chair and looked at her. &ldquo;Do you mean to  tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you can show me a certificate and a witness to your  marriage with William Grant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy looked doggedly down at the floor and said, in the tones of  one who is repeating the burial service or some other solemn function, &ldquo;I can  prove the marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake was puzzled. He had known the mountain folk all his life,  and knew that for uneducated people&mdash;or perhaps because they were uneducated  people&mdash;they were surprisingly clever liars. But he never dreamt that any of  them could hoodwink him; so he put Peggy once more through the whole story,  made her describe all her actions on the day of the wedding, where she stood,  where the witness stood, what the parson said, what her husband said. He went  through the whole thing, and could see no flaw in it. He knew that Peggy would  not scruple to lie to him; but, with the contempt of a clever man, he felt  satisfied that he could soon upset any concocted story. This story seemed to  hold water, and the more he cross-examined her the more sure he was that there  was something genuine about it; at the same time, he was sure that it was not  all genuine. Then a thought occurred to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you settle this case if they offered you something?&rdquo; he  said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do whatever you say,&rdquo; said Peggy, rising. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for you to  say what I ought to do.&rsquo;Tis not for the like of me, that is no scholar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; said Blake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what is best for you. Send  Martin Doyle in to see me, Martin that was the witness. And about this copy of  the certificate, tell Mick to bring it in here. Now you go home, and don&rsquo;t you  say to one living soul one word of what has passed in here. Tell them you are  going on with the case, but don&rsquo;t say any more, or you may land yourself in  gaol. Do you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the cowed and flustered Peggy hurried away to join her brother,  who was far too wise to ask questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Least said soonest mended,&rdquo; he said, when told that Blake  required silence.</p>
<p>After his clients had gone, Gavan Blake sat for half an hour  almost dazed. If Peggy&rsquo;s story was true, then Mary Grant was an outcast instead  of a great heiress. And while he had become genuinely fond of her (which he  never was of Ellen Harriott), he had no idea of asking her to share his debts  with him. He puzzled over the affair for a long time, and at last his clear  brain saw a way out of all difficulties. He would go over to the old station,  put the whole case before Mary Grant, and induce her for peace&rsquo;s sake to give  Peggy money to withdraw her claim. Out of this money he himself would keep  enough to pay all his pressing debts. He would be that much to the good  whatever happened, and afterwards would have an added claim on Mary Grant&rsquo;s  sympathies for having relieved her of a vast lawsuit in which her fortune, and  even her very name, were involved.</p>
<p>This plan seemed to him the best for all parties&mdash;for himself  especially, which was the most important thing. If he could get a large sum to  settle the case, he could make Peggy give him a big share for his trouble, and  then at last be free from the haunting fear of exposure and ruin. He felt sure  that he was doing quite right in advising Mary Grant to pay.</p>
<p>Again and again he ran over Peggy&rsquo;s case in his mind, and could  see no flaw in it. In the old days haphazard marriages were rather the rule  than the exception, and such things as registers were never heard of in far-out  places. His trained mind, going through the various questions that a  cross-examiner would ask, and supplying the requisite answers, decided that,  though it might seem a trifle improbable, there was nothing contradictory about  Peggy&rsquo;s story. A jury would sympathise with her, and the decisions of the  Courts all leaned towards presuming marriage where certain circumstances  existed. By settling the case he would do Mary Grant a real kindness. And  afterwards&mdash;well, she would probably be as grateful as when he had saved her  life. He saw himself the hero of the hour: ever prompt to decide, he saddled a  horse, and at once rode off to Kuryong to put the matter before her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
  No Compromise</b></h2>
<p>While Gavan Blake was  conferring with his clients, a very different sort of conference was being held  at Kuryong. The return of Charlie Gordon, accompanied by Carew, had been voted  by common consent an occasion for holiday; and although, according to theory, a  bush holiday is invariably spent in kangaroo-hunting, yet the fact is that men  who are in the saddle from daylight to dark, from week-end to week-end,  generally spend a holiday resting legs that are cramped from the saddle, and  arms that ache from lifting sheep over hurdles or swinging the gates of  drafting-yards. </p>
<p>Thus it was that, on the holiday at Kuryong, the Bachelors&rsquo;  Quarters&mdash;two large dormitory-like rooms that opened into one another&mdash;were full  of athletic male figures sprawling on the beds, smoking black pipes all day,  and yarning interminably. The main topic of conversation was Peggy&rsquo;s claim  against the estate. They had all heard the rumours that were going round; each  had quietly been trying to find out what Peggy had to go on, and this pow-wow  was utilised for the purpose of comparing notes. They had one advantage over  Gavan Blake&mdash;they knew all about Considine, which Blake did not.</p>
<p>On one bed lay Pinnock, who had come up to make arrangements for  carrying on the station till the will was proved. On another bed sprawled  Carew, who, by virtue of his trip out back, was looked upon as a bit of an  oracle by Poss and Binjie, who had never been further than the mountains. Poss  and Binjie had dragged an old couch out of the next room and were stretched on  that, listening to the talk, and occasionally throwing in a word of such wisdom  as they had. Hugh sat in an armchair by the window, smoking and dreaming.</p>
<p>Poss&rsquo;s voice cut knife-like through a cloud of tobacco smoke. He  spoke as one on the defensive. &ldquo;Well, I believe there&rsquo;s something in it, anyhow.  Briney Donohoe told me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie Gordon&rsquo;s cold drawl interrupted the youth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all rot,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;Briney Donohoe told you&mdash;what does he know about it? You two boys and  Hugh have been stuck at home here so long, you believe anything. I tell you,  they&rsquo;ll do nothing. It&rsquo;s all talk, just to make themselves big people. They  have nothing to do just now, so it comes in handy as an excuse to ride from one  selection to another all day long and leave our gates open. We have Peggy&rsquo;s  measure, haven&rsquo;t we, Carew? That long-lost relation of yours, old Considine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you did have him,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;He might come in very  handy. With a big property like this to go for, they are nearly sure to have a  try at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poss took heart at finding himself supported by this new champion.  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Red Mick and Peggy are down at Gavan Blake&rsquo;s today. I saw  their horses hanging up outside as I came through. And Briney Donohoe told  me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Carew?&rdquo; said Charlie, cutting Briney Donohoe  off again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that old fellow was telling the truth when he said  he married Peggy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he was,&rdquo; said the Englishman. &ldquo;Never saw a fellow in such a  funk in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Peggy?&rdquo; said Pinnock. &ldquo;How did she take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bold as brass! I thought she was going to kiss Charlie there,  when she found out who he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pinnock laughed. &ldquo;Funny thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a woman like Peggy  having the chance to choose between two fortunes. Pity we couldn&rsquo;t induce her  to take the old bushman and be done with it. How much money has he come into,  Carew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, plenty of money. But of course there&rsquo;s an old place to keep  up, and the death duties are very heavy. Very expensive thing having money left  you in England,  you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie Grdon turned to Pinnock. &ldquo;What you ought to do,&rdquo; he said  (the far-out man who has to shift for himself is always quite sure he can  settle all difficulties better than those whose profession it is), &ldquo;what you  ought to do,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;is to send someone to Peggy and tell her not to be  such a fool. Tell her to stick to old Considine. That&rsquo;s what you ought to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose you go and do it. You know the lady better than  anyone here, seemingly. But if she has been to see Blake, I expect the fat&rsquo;s in  the fire by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of Blake takin&rsquo; up the case,&rdquo; said Binjie,  &ldquo;after the old lady asked him here. It&rsquo;s doing the black-snake act, I call it.  I don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;ll come here any more after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh still sat looking out of the window, smoking silently. &ldquo;Here  comes Blake now, anyhow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just coming up the flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wants to see me, I expect,&rdquo; said Pinnock. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know all about  it now. Must have heard I was here, and is come to declare war or sue for  peace. Someone had better go and meet him, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dashed if I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Poss. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about a chap that  doesn&rsquo;t act white. I saw Red Mick&rsquo;s and Peggy&rsquo;s horses at his office today, and  now he comes up here as bold as brass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go round to the front,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;and then he can ask  the servants for whoever he wants. If we go out and meet him, we&rsquo;ll have to ask  him to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The approach to houses in the bush is generally by way of the yard  where the horses arrive, and it is very unusual for anyone, except a stranger  making a formal visit, to be allowed to find their way round to the front.</p>
<p>Blake rode up and gave his horse to the horse-boy. &ldquo;Put him in the  stable for a while,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I may want him again.&rdquo; Then he went round to the  front door and asked for Mrs Gordon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come to see Miss Grant on very important business,&rdquo; he  said when the old lady came in. &ldquo;Would you ask her if she would see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady was in a quandary. She had heard all the rumours that  were going about, but she knew that they had been kept from Mary Grant, and she  thought that if Blake meant to talk business he might shock or startle the girl  terribly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Pinnock the lawyer is here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps you had better  see him. Miss Grant does not know &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am come as a friend of Miss Grant&rsquo;s, Mrs Gordon,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;But, if Mr Pinnock is here, perhaps it would be better for me to see him  first. Shall I wait for him here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will go into the office I will send him in there,&rdquo; and the  old lady withdrew to talk of commonplace matters with Mary, all the time  feeling that a great crisis was at hand.</p>
<p>Soon the two lawyers faced one another over the office table, and  Blake got to business at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Pinnock,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am asked to act for Margaret Donohoe, or  Margaret Grant as she claims to be; and I want you to believe that I am  seriously telling you what I believe to be the truth, when I say that Miss  Grant had better settle this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should she pay one penny? What proofs have you? It looks to  me, with all respect to you, Mr Blake, like an ordinary case of blackmail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were blackmail,&rdquo; said Blake quietly, &ldquo;do you think that I  would be here, giving you particulars of the case? I tell you, man, I am ready  now to give you all particulars, and you can soon see whether to advise a  settlement or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away, then,&rdquo; said Pinnock. &ldquo;it will take a lot to convince  me, though, and so I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake gave him the particulars gleaned from Peggy. &ldquo;I have  examined and cross-examined and recross-examined her, and I can&rsquo;t shake her  story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pinnock listened with an immovable face, but his mind was working  like lightning. As the name of the missionary and Pike&rsquo;s Hotel were mentioned,  he remembered that he had seen these very names on the butts of Grant&rsquo;s cheque  books. Getting Blake to excuse him for a moment, he hurried to his room and  pulled out a bundle of cheque butts. The best diary of many a man is found in  his cheque butts. There he saw on the very date mentioned by Blake, cheques  drawn to &ldquo;Self and P.&rdquo;, also one drawn to &ldquo;Pike accommodation&rdquo;, and one simply  to the name of Nettleship for five pounds. Of course it was quite possible that  the latter was only a donation to charity, such as old Bully was occasionally  very free with; but, taken together, the whole lot made Blake&rsquo;s story look  unpleasantly probable. Pinnock whistled to himself as he tied the bundle up  again. &ldquo;Case of settle or be sorry,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I wonder how much  will settle it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he faced Blake again, he had pulled the mask of professional  stolidity over his features; also he lied boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see nothing to corroborate this story,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but it  may be that Miss Grant would rather pay a few pounds than have the  unpleasantness of a trial. I will get her in and ask her if you like, but I  don&rsquo;t think it will lead to anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were holding their conference in the office. Outside, the  station was dozing in the sun. The house dog slept in the yard, and a stray  wild pigeon had come down into the quadrangle, and was picking at some grain  that was spilt there. From the garden came the shouts of the children and the  happy laughter of Mary Grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is now,&rdquo; said Pinnock. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better get her to come  in and get the thing over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went out, and came back very soon. &ldquo;Mrs Gordon and Miss Grant  are coming,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She said she would like Mrs Gordon to be with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before long they came in and sat down. Mary Grant had no idea what  she was wanted for. She greeted Blake with a glad smile, and waited to hear  what Pinnock had to say. It did not take the lawyer long to put the story  before her: but it was some time before she could understand it. Nothing so  tragic had ever entered her life before, and she seemed almost stunned.</p>
<p>Mrs Gordon moved to her side and took her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very terrible for you&mdash;for us all, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must  listen to what Mr Pinnock says, and make up your mind. He can advise you best  what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Pinnock went through the case. As a full understanding broke  in on her, she drew herself up; the look of distress and perplexity left her  face, and her eyes were full of scorn and anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s coming now?&rdquo; thought Pinnock. &ldquo;I hope she says  nothing rash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to speak once or twice, but the words seemed to choke  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you advise me to do, Mr Pinnock?&rdquo; she said, turning to  him suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I advise you to give me power to act for you in the matter as I  think best,&rdquo; said Pinnock, who saw that matters were likely to slip beyond his  control. &ldquo;From what Mr Blake tells me, I daresay this woman can give you a lot  of trouble and annoyance. Whatever you pay her, you won&rsquo;t miss the money. You  will save the family here from being turned out; you will avoid scandal; and if  there should be any foundation for Mr Blake&rsquo;s story, it may mean that if you  don&rsquo;t settle you lose everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From him Mary Grant turned to the old lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Gordon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you advise me to pay this money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I don&rsquo;t advise at all. Don&rsquo;t consider us in the matter  at all. It is for you to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will pay nothing. It is a cruel, infamous, wicked slander.  These poor, ignorant people don&rsquo;t know what they are doing. Sooner than pay one  penny in compromise, I will walk off this station a pauper. God will not let  such villainy win. Mrs Gordon, surely you don&rsquo;t think that I ought to blacken  my father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s name by paying money to keep this claim quiet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Pinnock broke in on her speech. &ldquo;But if they should manage to  produce evidence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them produce it, and let the judge believe it if he likes.  You and I and everybody know that it is a lie; even if they win the case, it is  still a lie. I will pay nothing&mdash;not one halfpenny. My mother&rsquo;s name is more  than all the money in the world, and I will not blacken it by compromises. Mr  Pinnock, the case is to be fought out, and if we lose we shall still know that  justice is on our side; but if we pay money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gordon took her hand, and lifted it to her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are quite right, my dear. You put us all to shame for  even thinking of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, Mr Blake,&rdquo; the girl went on, &ldquo;very sorry indeed  that you should have come here on such an errand. You saved my life, and if I  could pay you for that I would; but this offer is an insult, and I hope that  you will never come here again. Whether I am turned out of the old station or  not, I hope that you will never come here again.&rdquo; And with that the two ladies  walked out, leaving the lawyers looking at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, Mr Blake,&rdquo; said Pinnock at last, &ldquo;that we have lost  any hope we might ever have had of settling this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Blake, as he rode homewards, felt that he had lost for ever a  much higher hope. He had played for a high stake on two chances. One of them  had failed him. There remained only the chance of pulling Peggy&rsquo;s case through;  and he swore that if hard work, skill, and utter unscrupulousness could win  that case, it should be won.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  A Nurse and Her Assistant</b></h2>
<p>While they were waiting for  the great case to come on a sort of depression seemed to spread itself over the  station. The owner was mostly shut up in her room with her thoughts; the old  lady was trying to comfort her, and Ellen Harriott, with sorrow always at her  heart, went about the household work like an automaton. No wonder that as soon  as breakfast was over all the men cleared out to work on the run. But one day  it so happened that Carew did not go out with the others. The young Englishman  was a poor correspondent, and had promised himself a whole quiet day to be  spent in explaining by letter to his people at home the mysterious  circumstances under which he had found and lost Patrick Henry Considine. Ellen  Harriott found him in the office manfully wrestling with some extra long words,  and stopped for a few minutes&rsquo; talk. She had a liking for the young Englishman,  and any talk was better than to be left alone with her thoughts. </p>
<p>&ldquo;These are bad times for the old station, Mr Carew,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t know what is going to happen next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carew was not going to haul down the flag just yet. &ldquo;I believe  everything&rsquo;ll come all right in the long run, don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Never  give up first hit, you know; see it out&mdash;eh, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get away out of this for a while,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am run  down. I think the bush monotony tells on women. I don&rsquo;t want anyone to fall  sick, but I do wish I could get a little nursing to do again&mdash;just for a change.  I would nurse Red Mick himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is there anything in telepathy? Do coming events sometimes send  warnings on ahead? Certain it is that, even as she spoke, a rider on a sweating  horse was seen coming at full speed up the flat; he put his horse over the  sliprails that led into the house paddock without any hesitation, and came on  at a swinging gallop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; said Ellen Harriott, &ldquo;more trouble? It is only  trouble that comes so fast. Why, it is one of Red Mick&rsquo;s nephews!&rdquo; By this time  the rider was up to them; without dismounting he called out &ldquo;Miss! Please,  Miss! There&rsquo;s been an accident. My uncle got run agin a tree and he&rsquo;s all  smashed in the head. I&rsquo;m off to the Doctor now; I&rsquo;ll get the Doctor here by  tomorrow night, and would you go out and do aught you can for Mick? There&rsquo;s no  one out there but old Granny, and she&rsquo;s helpless like. Will you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he much hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s killed, Miss. I found him. He&rsquo;d been out all  night and the side of his head all busted. After a dingo he was&mdash;I seen the  tracks. Coming back from Gavan Blake&rsquo;s he must&rsquo;a&rsquo; seen the dorg off the track,  and the colt he was on was orkard like and must have hit him agen a tree. The  colt kem home with the saddle under his belly, and I run the tracks back till I  found him. Will you go out, Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;I will go. And you hurry on now, and get the  Doctor. Tell the Doctor I&rsquo;ve gone out there.&rdquo; Like an arrow from the bow the  young fellow sent his big thoroughbred horse across the paddocks, making a bee  line over fences and everything for Tarrong, while Ellen Harriott hurried in to  pack up a few things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I help you at all?&rdquo; said Carew, following her into the house.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be some use, don&rsquo;t you know; but in this country I seem to be so  dashed useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be a lot of use if you will come out with me. I shall  want someone to drive the trap out, and I may want help with the patient. You  are big and strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s about the first time my strength has even been of  any use to anybody. I will go and get the trap ready while you dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurriedly they packed food and blankets into the light buggy, and  set off. Miss Harriott knew the tracks well, and the buggy fairly flew along  till they came up the flat to Red Mick&rsquo;s. As they drew near the hut a noise of  talking and crying came through the open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; said Carew. &ldquo;Crowd of people there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;&mdash;Ellen Harriott listened for a second. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he is  delirious. That is the old woman crying. Hurry up, Mr Carew&mdash;take the horse out  of the buggy and put him in the stable, and then come in as quickly as you can.  I may want help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Carew to unharness the horse, she went inside. In the  inner room, on a bunk, lay Red Mick. Eye, nose, forehead, and mouth were all  one unrecognisable lump, while fragments of bark and splinters still stuck to  the skin. In the corner sat the old mother, crying feebly. Disregarding the old  woman, Ellen made a swift examination of Mick&rsquo;s injuries, but as soon as he  felt her touch on his face he sprang to his feet and struck at her.</p>
<p>Just as he did so, Carew rushed in and threw his arms round the  madman. In that grip even Red Mick had no power to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just hold him quiet,&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;till I have a look&rdquo;&mdash;and she  rapidly ran her fingers over the wound. &ldquo;Very bad. I think there must be a bit  of the skull pressing on the brain. We can&rsquo;t do much till the Doctor comes. I  think he will be quiet now. Will you make a fire and boil some water, so that I  can clean and dress the wound? That will ease him a little. And get the  blankets in; we can make up some sort of place on the floor to sleep. One of us  will have to watch all night. Granny, you must go to bed, do you hear? Come and  sit by Mick till I put Granny to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By degrees they got things shipshape&mdash;put the old woman to bed, and  cleaned and dressed Mick&rsquo;s wounds. Then they settled down for the long night in  the sick-room. A strange sick-room it was; but many a hospital is less healthy.  Through wide cracks between the slabs there came in the cool, fresh air that in  itself is worth more than all the medicines in the pharmacop&oelig;ia. The patient  had sunk into an uneasy slumber when Ellen made her dispositions for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go and lie down now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in the other room, on the  sofa. I will call you if I want you. Get all the sleep you can, and in a couple  of hours you can take my place. He may talk, but don&rsquo;t let that disturb you. I  will call out loud enough if I want you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you do,&rdquo; said the Englishman. &ldquo;I sleep like a blessed top,  you know. Sleep anywhere. Well, goodnight for the present. He looks a little  better since you washed him, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw himself on the couch in the inner room, and before long a  titanic snore showed that he had not over-rated his sleeping powers.</p>
<p>Ellen Harriott sat by Red Mick&rsquo;s bedside and thought over the  events of the last few weeks. As she thought she half-dozed, but woke with a  start to find her patient broad awake again and trying to get at something that  was under his bunk. Quietly she drew him back, for his struggles with Carew had  left him weak as a child.</p>
<p>He looked at her with crazed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paper,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for the love of God, the paper. I have to  take it to Gavan. &rsquo;Twill win the case. The paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to pacify him, but nothing would do but that she should  get the mysterious paper. At last, to humour him, she dived under the bunk and  found an iron camp-oven, and in it a single envelope. Just to see what was  exciting him she opened the envelope, and found a crumpled piece of paper which  she read over to herself. It was the original certificate of the marriage  between Patrick Henry Keogh and Margaret Donohoe; if Ellen had only known it,  she held in her hand the evidence to sweep away all her friend&rsquo;s troubles. It  so happened, however, that it conveyed nothing to her mind. She had heard much  about Considine, but not a word about Keogh, and the name &ldquo;Margaret Donohoe&rdquo;  did not strike her half-asleep mind as referring to Peggy. She put the paper  away again in the camp-oven; then, feeling weary, she awoke Carew and lay down  on the couch while he watched the patient.</p>
<p>Next morning the Doctor arrived with a trail of Red Mick&rsquo;s  relations after him; among them they arranged to take him into Tarrong to be  operated on, and Ellen Harriott and Carew drove back to Kuryong feeling as if  they had known each other all their lives.</p>
<p>As they drove along she wondered idly which of Red Mick&rsquo;s  innumerable relatives the paper referred to, and why Mick was so anxious about  it; but by the time they arrived home the matter passed from her mind, except  that she remembered well enough what was written on the odd-looking little  scrap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you a certificate as a competent wardsman if ever you  want one,&rdquo; she said to Carew as he helped her out of the buggy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know  what I&rsquo;d have done without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have managed somehow, I&rsquo;ll bet,&rdquo; he said, looking at the  confident face before him. &ldquo;Quite a bit of fun, wasn&rsquo;t it? I hope we have a few  more excursions together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she felt that she rather hoped so, too.</p>

  Hugh Goes in Search</b></h2>
<p>Who does not remember the  first exciting news of the great Grant v. Grant will case? The leading Q.Cs  watched eagerly for briefs; juniors who held even the smallest briefs in  connection with it patronised their fellows, and explained to them intricate  legal dodges which they themselves had thought out and &ldquo;pumped into&rdquo; their  learned leaders. &ldquo;Took me a doose of a time to get him to see it, but I think  he has got it at last,&rdquo; they used to say. The case looked like lasting for  years, for there would be appeals and counter-appeals, references, inquiries  and what not; and in getting ready for the first fight the lawyers on each side  worked like beavers. </p>
<p>Blake let it be known among the clans that he was going to fight  the case for Peggy, and that there was going to be a lawsuit such as the most  veteran campaigners of them all had never even dimly imagined&mdash;a lawsuit with  the happiness of a beautiful woman and the disposal of a vast fortune at stake.  Word was carried from selection to selection, across trackless mountain passes,  and over dangerous river crossings, until even Larry, the outermost Donohoe,  heard the news in his rocky fastness, miscalled a grazing lease, away in the  gullies under the shadows of Black Andrew mountain. By some mysterious means it  even reached Briney Doyle, who was camped out near the foothills of Kosciusko,  running wild horses into trapyards. This occupation had taken such hold on him  that he had become as wild as the horses he pursued, and it was popularly  supposed that the other Doyles had to go out with horses to run him in whenever  they wanted him.</p>
<p>Peggy brought in the copy of her marriage certificate, an old and  faded piece of paper which ran, &ldquo;This is to certify that I, Thomas Nettleship,  duly ordained clergyman of the Church of England, have this day solemnised a  marriage between William Grant, Bachelor, and Margaret Donohoe, Spinster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name of Pike&rsquo;s Hotel and the date were nearly illegible, but  there the document was; and though it was not the original certificate, it was  pretty clear that Peggy could never have invented it. Its production made a  great impression. It certainly went far to convince Blake.</p>
<p>He had cross-examined all the witnesses, had checked their  accounts by each other, had followed William Grant&rsquo;s career at that time, had  got on to the history of the bush missionary; and everything fitted in. Martin  Doyle&mdash;Black Martin&rsquo;s son Martin&mdash;was letter-perfect in his part. Peggy could  give the details of the ceremony with unfaltering accuracy fifty times a day if  need be, and never contradict herself. So at last he gave up trying to find  holes in the case, and determined to go in and win.</p>
<p>On the other side there was trouble in the camp&mdash;no witnesses could  be found, except Martin Doyle, and he was ready to swear to the wedding. At  last it became evident that the only chance of overthrowing Peggy&rsquo;s case was to  find Considine; but the earth seemed to have swallowed him up.</p>
<p>The influence of the Chief of Police was brought to bear, and many  a weary mile did the troopers of the Outer Back ride in search of the missing  man. One of them followed a Considine about two hundred miles across country,  and embodied the story of his wanderings in a villainously written report;  brief and uncouth as the narrative was, it was in itself an outline picture of  bush life. From shearers&rsquo; hut to artesian borers&rsquo; camp, from artesian well to  the opal-fields, from the opal-fields to a gold-rush, from the gold-rush to a  mail-coach stable, he pursued this Considine, only to find that, &ldquo;The individual  was not the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Things looked hopeless for Mary Grant, when help came from an  unexpected quarter. A letter written in a rugged, forcible fist, arrived for  Charlie Gordon from a young fellow named Redshaw, once a station-hand on  Kuryong, who had gone out to the back-country and was rather a celebrity in his  way. His father was a pensioner at the old station, and Redshaw junior, who was  known as Flash Jack, evidently kept in touch with things at Kuryong. He wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dear Sir,</p>
          <p class="note">&ldquo;I hear from Cannon the trooper that you want to find Keogh.    When he left the coach that time, he went back to the station and got his    horses, and cleared out, and he is now hiding in Peeves&rsquo;s buffalo camp at the    back of Port Faraway. If I hear any more will let you know.</p>
        <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;J.    REDSHAW, alas &lsquo;Flash Jack&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; said Pinnock, when Charlie and Carew brought  him the letter. &ldquo;Who is J. Redshaw, and why does he sign &lsquo;alas Flash Jack&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means&nbsp;<i>alias</i>, don&rsquo;t you see? Alias Flash Jack. He  is a man we used to have on the station, and his father used to work for us&mdash;I  expect he wants to do us a good turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a good turn in earnest, if he puts you in the way of  finding Considine,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;You will have to send Hugh up. The old  man knows you and Carew, and if he saw you coming he would take to the woods,  as the Yankees say. Even when you do get him the case isn&rsquo;t over, because the  jury will side with Peggy. They&rsquo;ll sympathise with her efforts to prove herself  an honest woman. It isn&rsquo;t marrying too much that will get her into trouble&mdash;it&rsquo;s  the other thing. But we have the date and place of her alleged marriage with  William Grant; and if this old Considine can prove, by documents, mind you, not  by his own simple word&mdash;because it&rsquo;s a hundred to one the jury wouldn&rsquo;t believe  him&mdash;I say, if he can prove that she married him on that very day and at that  very place, then she&rsquo;s beaten. No one on earth could swallow the story of her  marrying two different people on the same day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh can go,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to do his best this time.  It all depends on getting hold of this Considine, eh? Well, Hugh&rsquo;ll have to get  him. If he fails he needn&rsquo;t show his face amongst us any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Grant was called in and told the great news, and then Pinnock  started out to find Hugh. But before the lawyer could see him, Mary met him in  the garden.</p>
<p>Hugh did not see that he could be of any use in the case, and  wanted to be quit of Kuryong for good. Seeing Mary day after day, he had become  more and more miserable as the days went by. He determined at last to go away  altogether, and, when once he had made up his mind, only waited for a chance to  tell her that he was going. The chance came as she left the office after  consulting with Pinnock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Grant,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t mind, I think I will resign  my management of this station. I will make a start for myself or get a job  somewhere else. You will easily get someone to take my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him keenly for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect this of you,&rdquo; she said bitterly. &ldquo;The rats leave  the sinking ship. Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face flushed a dull red. &ldquo;You know better than that,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I would stop if I could be of any use, but what is there I can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get away from here&mdash;I want to get out of the hills for  awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary knew, as well as if he had told her, that what he wanted was  to go where he could forget her and see whether absence would break the chain;  and triumph lit up her eyes, for it was pleasant even in the midst of her troubles  to know that he still cared. Then she came to a swift decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you do something for me away from the hills, then?&rdquo; she  said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up north. I want someone to find that man Considine that your  brother and Mr Carew met. You know how important it is to me. Will you do it  for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh would have jumped at the chance to risk his life for her  slightest wish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go anywhere and do my best to find anyone you want,&rdquo; he  said; &ldquo;When do you want me to start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See Mr Pinnock and your brother about that. They will tell you  all about it; and if you do manage to find this man, why, you can talk about  leaving after that if you want to. Will you go for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I will go, Miss Grant; and I will never come back till I  find this man&mdash;if he is alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laid her hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will do all you can,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but in any case,  whether you find him or not&mdash;come back again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
  The Second Search for Condidine</b></h2>
<p>Before leaving Hugh was fully  instructed what to do if he compassed the second finding of Considine. He was  to travel under another name, for fear that his own would get about, and cause  the fugitive to make another hurried disappearance. </p>
<p>He took a subpoena to serve on the old man as a last resource.</p>
<p>Charlie was emphatic. &ldquo;Go up and get hold of the old vagrant, and  find out all about it. Don&rsquo;t make a mess of it, whatever you do. Remember the  old lady, and Miss Grant, and the youngsters, and all of us depend on you in  this business. Don&rsquo;t come back beaten. Don&rsquo;t let anything stop you. Get him  drunk or get him sober&mdash;friendly or fighting&mdash;but get the truth, and get the  proofs of it. Choke it out of the old hound somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh said that he would, and departed, weighed down by  responsibility, to execute his difficult mission. He had to go into an  untravelled country to get the truth out of a man who did not want to tell it;  and the time allowed was short, as the case could not be postponed much longer.</p>
<p>He travelled by sea to Port Faraway, a tropical sweltering  township by the northern seas of Australia, and when he reached it felt like  one of the heroes in Tennyson&rsquo;s&nbsp;Lotus  Eaters&mdash;he had come &ldquo;into a land wherein it seemed always afternoon&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Reeves, the buffalo shooter, was a well-known man, but to find his  camp was another matter. No one seemed to have energy enough to take much  interest in the quest.</p>
<p>Hugh interviewed a leading citizen at the hotel, and got very  little satisfaction. He said, &ldquo;I want to get out to Reeves&rsquo;s camp. Do you know  where it is, and how one gets there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the leading citizen, putting his feet up on the arms  of his long chair and gasping for air, &ldquo;Le&rsquo;s see! Reeves&rsquo;s camp&mdash;ah! Where is he  camped now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I wish I did. That&rsquo;s what I want to  find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hopkins&rsquo;d  know. Hopkins, the storekeeper. He sends out the supplies. Did you ask him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll go and ask him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too hot to bustle round now,&rdquo; said the leading citizen lighting  his pipe. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you have to drink? Have some square; it&rsquo;s the best drink  here.</p>
<p>Hugh thought it well to fall in with the customs of the  inhabitants, so he had a stiff gin-and-water at nine in the morning, a thing he  had never done, or even seen done, in his life before. Then he went over in the  blazing sunlight to the storekeeper, and asked whether he knew where Reeves&rsquo;s  camp was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the storekeeper. &ldquo;I sind out what they want  by a Malay who sails a one-masted craft round the coast, and goes up the river  to their camp, and brings the hides back. They send a blackfellow to let me  know when they want any stuff, and where to send it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I could go out with the next lot of stuff,&rdquo; said Hugh.  &ldquo;When will they want it, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they mightn&rsquo;t want any more. They might go on now till the  wet season, and then they&rsquo;ll come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is the wet season, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a couple of months, likely. Perhaps three months. Perhaps  there won&rsquo;t be none at all to speak of. What&rsquo;ll you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have just had a drink, thanks. Fact is, I&rsquo;m a bit anxious  to get out to this camp. It&rsquo;s a bit important. You don&rsquo;t know where they are  for certain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord knows! Anywhere! Might be on one river, might be on another.  They&rsquo;ll come in in the wet season. Better have a drink, anyhow. You must have  something. What&rsquo;ll it be, square? Beer? Can&rsquo;t stand beer in this climate,  myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Hugh desperately, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have another square. Make  it a light one. Do you think I can get anyone who knows where they are camped  to go out with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy Prince&rsquo;d know, I expect. He was out in that country before.  But he&rsquo;s gone with a bullock-team, drawing quartz to the new battery at the  Oriental. At least I saw him start out three weeks ago. Said he was in a hurry,  too, as the battery couldn&rsquo;t start until he got the quartz hauled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t start,&rdquo; said Hugh; &ldquo;perhaps he put it off till  after the wet season?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the storekeeper, meditatively, &ldquo;he might, but I don&rsquo;t  think he would. There&rsquo;s no one else, that I know of, can find them for you.  Lord knows where they are. They camp in one place till the buffalo are all  shot, and then they shift to new ground. Perhaps ten miles, perhaps thirty.  Have another drink? What&rsquo;ll you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not any more, thanks. About this Tommy Prince, now; if I can  find him he might tell me where to go. Where can I find him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down at the Margaret is where he camps, but I think he&rsquo;s gone to  the Oriental by this time&mdash;sure to be. That&rsquo;s about forty miles down past the  Margaret. There was a fellow came in from the Margaret for supplies, and he&rsquo;ll  be going back tomorrow&mdash;if he can find his pack-horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And supposing he can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, he&rsquo;ll go out next week, I expect, unless he gets on  the drink. He&rsquo;s a terrible chap to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he starts to drink, when will he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord knows. They&rsquo;ll have to send in after him. His mates&rsquo;ll be  pretty starved by now, anyhow. He&rsquo;s been in town, foolin&rsquo; round that girl at  the Royal this three weeks. He&rsquo;ll give you a lift out to the Margaret&mdash;that&rsquo;s  forty miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there out at the Margaret when I get there? Is it a town,  or a station, or a mine? What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not so bad. There&rsquo;s a store there, and a few mines  scattered about. Mostly Chinese mines. The storekeeper there&rsquo;s a great soaker,  nearly always on the drink. Name&rsquo;s Sampson. He&rsquo;ll tell you where to find Tommy  Prince. Prince and his mates have a claim twelve miles out from there, and if  Tommy ain&rsquo;t gone to the Oriental, he might go down with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing Tommy&rsquo;s at his claim, twelve miles out,&rdquo; said Hugh,  &ldquo;how do I get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said the storekeeper, who was getting tired of talking  so long without a drink. &ldquo;I dunno how you&rsquo;ll get there. Better have a  drink&mdash;what&rsquo;ll you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh walked out of the store in despair. He found himself engaged  in what appeared to be an endless chase after a phantom Considine, and the  difficulties in his way seemed insuperable. Yet how could he go back and tell  them all at home that he had failed? What would they think of him? The thought  made him miserable; and he determined, if he failed, never to go back to the  old station at all.</p>
<p>So he returned to his hotel, packed his valise, and set out to  look for the packhorse man. He found him fairly sober; soon bargained to be  allowed to ride one of the horses, and in due course was deposited at the  Margaret&mdash;a city consisting of one galvanised-iron building, apparently  unoccupied. His friend dismounted and had a drink with him out of his flask.  They kicked at the door unavailingly; then his mate went on into the  indefinite, leaving him face to face with general desolation.</p>
<p>The Margaret store was the only feature in the landscape&mdash;a small  building with a heap of empty bottles in the immediate foreground, and all  round it the grim bush, a vista of weird twisted trees and dull grey earth with  scanty grass. At the back were a well, a windlass, and a trough for water,  round which about a hundred goats were encamped. Hugh sat and smoked, and  looked at the prospect. By-and-by out of the bush came two men, a Chinaman and  a white man. The Chinaman was like all Chinamen; the white man was a fiery,  red-faced, red-bearded, red-nosed little fellow. The Chinee was dragging a goat  along by the horns, the goat hanging back and protesting loudly in semi-human  screams; every now and again a black mongrel dog would make sudden fiendish  dashes at the captive, and fasten its teeth in its neck. This made it bellow  louder; but the Chinaman, with the impassibility of his race, dragged goat, dog,  and all along, without the slightest show of interest.</p>
<p>The white man trudged ahead, staring fixedly in front; when they  reached the store he stared at Hugh as if he were the Bunyip, but said no word.  Then he unlocked the door, went in, and came out with a large knife, with which  he proceeded to murder the goat scientifically. The Chinee meanwhile bailed up  the rest of the animals, and caught and milked a couple of &ldquo;nannies&rdquo;, while a  patriarchal old &ldquo;billy&rdquo; walked fragrantly round the yard, uttering hoarse &ldquo;buukhs&rdquo;  of defiance.</p>
<p>It was a truly pastoral scene, but Hugh took little interest in  it. He was engrossed with the task of getting out to the buffalo camp, finding  Considine, and making him come forward and save the family. He approached the  white, or rather red man, who cocked a suspicious eye at him, and went on  tearing the hide off the goat. Hugh noticed that his hand trembled a good deal,  and that a sort of foam gathered on his lips as he worked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<p>The man glared at him, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Lambton,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I want to go out to the buffalo  camp. I want to find Tommy Prince, to see if he can go out with me. Do you know  where he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man put the blade of the butcher&rsquo;s knife between his teeth,  and stared again at Hugh, apparently having some difficulty in focussing him.  Then his lips moved, and he was evidently trying to frame speech. He said,  &ldquo;Boo, Boo, Boo,&rdquo; for a few seconds; then he pulled himself together, and said,  &ldquo;Wha&rsquo; you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get to the buffalo camp,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;You know Reeves&rsquo;s  camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here a twig fell to the ground just behind the man; he gave one  blood-curdling yell, dropped the knife, and rushed past Hugh, screaming out,  &ldquo;Save me! Save me! They&rsquo;re after me! Look at &rsquo;em; look at &rsquo;em!&rdquo; His hair stood  perfectly erect with fright, and, as he ran, he glanced over his shoulder with  frightened eyes. He didn&rsquo;t get far. In his panic he ran straight towards the  well, banged his head against the windlass, and went thundering down the twenty  or thirty feet of shaft souse into the water at the bottom, where he splashed  and shrieked like a fiend, the noise reverberating up the long shaft.</p>
<p>Hugh and the Chinaman ran to the well-top, Hugh cursing under his  breath. Every possible obstacle that could arise had arisen to block his  journey; every man that could have helped him was away, or dead, or otherwise  missing; and now, to crown all, after getting thus far, he had apparently  struck a prize lunatic, and would have to stay in that awful desolation,  perhaps for a week, with him and a Chinaman. Perhaps he would have to give  evidence on the lunatic&rsquo;s dead body, and even be accused of causing his death.  All these thoughts flashed through his mind as he ran to the well-head. From  the noise he made the man was evidently not dead yet, and, looking down, he saw  his eyes glaring up as he splashed in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with him?&rdquo; roared Hugh to the Chinaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him, dlink, dlink&mdash;all-a-time dlink, him catchee hollows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had started to lower the bucket, when suddenly the yells  ceased, a loud bubbling was heard, and looking down they saw only a dim, round  object above the water. Without an instant&rsquo;s delay Hugh put his foot in the  bucket and signed to the Chinee to lower him. Swiftly and silently he descended  the well, jumped out of the bucket, and grabbed the floating body of the  drunkard with one hand, holding on to the rope with the other. The man had  collapsed, and was as limp as a rag. Hugh made the rope fast under his armpits,  and gave the old mining cry, &ldquo;On top there, haul away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heavily the windlass creaked. Mightily the Chinee strained. The  unconscious figure was drawn out of the water and up the shaft, inch by inch.  The weight of a man in wet clothes is considerably more than that of a bucket  of water, and it seemed a certainty that either the old windlass would break or  the Chinaman&rsquo;s arms give out. Slowly, slowly, the limp figure ascended the  shaft, while Hugh supported himself in the water, by gripping the logs at the  side of the well, praying that the tackle would hold. The creaking of the  windlass ceased, and the ascending body stopped&mdash;evidently the Chinee was  pausing to get his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; screamed Hugh. &ldquo;Keep at it, John! Don&rsquo;t let it beat you!  Wind away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faintly came the gasped reply, &ldquo;No can! No can do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lowered himself in the water as far as he could, to deaden the  blow in case of the fellow falling back on him, and screamed encouragement,  threats, and promises up the well. Suddenly from above came a new voice  altogether, a white man&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right oh, boss! We&rsquo;ve got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The windlass recommenced its creaking, and the figure at the end  of the rope continued its slow, upward journey. Hugh saw the body hauled slowly  to the top and grabbed by a strong hand; then it disappeared, and the sunlight  once more streamed, uninterrupted, down the shaft. The bucket came down again,  and Hugh clutched it and yelled out, &ldquo;Haul away!&rdquo; He could hear the men  grunting above as they turned the handle.</p>
<p>When he had been hauled about fifteen feet there was a crack; the  old windlass had collapsed, and he went souse, feet first, into the water. He  sank till he touched the bottom, then rose gasping to the surface. A head  appeared, framed in the circle of the well, and a slow, drawling colonial voice  said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gord! boss, are you hurt? The windlass is broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not hurt. Can&rsquo;t you fix that windlass?&rdquo; roared Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; came the answer sepulchrally down the well. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s cooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hold on,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I believe I can get up.&rdquo; He braced  his feet against one side of the well, and his shoulders against the other, and  so, working them alternately, he raised himself inch by inch. It is a feat that  requires a good man to perform, and the strain was very great. Grimly he kept  at it, and drew nearer and nearer to the top. Then, at last, a hand seized him;  half-sick with over-exertion, he struggled out and fell gasping to the ground.  For a minute or two the universe was turning round with him. The Chinee and the  strange white man moved in a kind of flicker, unreal as the figures in a  cinematograph. Then all was blank for a while.</p>
<p>When he came to, he was lying by the well with a bag under his  head, and the strange white man was trying to pour some spirits down his  throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;all right&mdash;thanks!&rdquo; gasped Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Gord, Mister, it&rsquo;s lucky I happened to come along,&rdquo; said the  stranger. &ldquo;You an&rsquo; Sampson&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; both been drownded. That Chow couldn&rsquo;t haul  him up. Dead beat the Chow was when I came. I jis&rsquo; come ridin&rsquo; up, thinkin&rsquo; to  get a few pounds of onions to take out to the camp, and I see the Chow  a-haulin&rsquo; and a-haulin&rsquo; at that windlass like as if he was tryin&rsquo; to pull the  bottom out of the well. I rides up and sings out &ldquo;What ho! Chaney, what yer  got?&rdquo; And he says, &ldquo;Ketch hold,&rdquo; he says, and that was all he could say; he was  fair beat. And then I heard you singing out, and I says to meself, &ldquo;Is the  whole popperlation of the Northern    Territory down this here well? How many more is  there, Chaney?&rdquo; I says. And then bung goes the old windlass, and lucky it  ketched in the top of the well; if it had fell down on the top of you, it&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;  stiffened you all right. And how you got up that well beats me. By Cripes, it  does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the&mdash;man that&mdash;was down with me?&rdquo; said Hugh slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Sampson? &lsquo;E&rsquo;s all right. Couldn&rsquo;t kill&rsquo;m with a meat-axe.  He must ha&rsquo; swallowed very near all the water in that well. Me an&rsquo; the Chow  emptied very near two buckets out of him. He&rsquo;s dead to the world jes&rsquo; now. How  do you feel, boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right in a minute,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tommy Prince,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;I jist kem in from my camp  today for them onions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh drew a long breath. The luck had turned at last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
  In the Buffalo  Camp</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the man I was  looking for,&rdquo; said Hugh, taking in the stranger with his eyes. &ldquo;I want to get  out to Peeves&rsquo;s buffalo camp, and I hear you&rsquo;re the only man who knows that  country at all. Can you get time to come down with me? I&rsquo;ll make it worth your  while.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He waited for the reply with a beating heart. If this man failed  him he saw nothing for it but to go back. The stranger lit his pipe with the  leisurely movements of a man who had never been in a real hurry in his life.</p>
<p>Then he spoke slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this way, boss, you see. I&rsquo;m just startin&rsquo; off in no  end of a hurry to go and take a team of bullocks to the Oriental to draw  quartz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you put it off for a while?&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting near  the wet season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to go with you, boss, but I couldn&rsquo;t chuck &rsquo;em  over&mdash;not rightly I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He stroked his beard and relapsed into thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in and get a drink,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I suppose there is some  square-face inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The square-face settled it. They had one drink, and the stranger  began to think less of the needs of the Oriental. They had another, and he said  he didn&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;d matter much if the Oriental had to wait a bit for their  stone, and the bullocks were all over the bush and very poor, and by the time  he got them together the wet season would be on. They had a third, and he said  that the Oriental had been hanging on for six months, and it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt it  to hang on for seven, and he wouldn&rsquo;t see a man like Hugh stuck.</p>
<p>So the shareholders in that valuable concern, the Oriental Mine,  were kept in pleasing suspense for some months longer, while the mine-manager (whose  salary was going on all the time) did nothing but smoke, and write reports to  the effect that &ldquo;A very valuable body of stone was at grass, awaiting cartage  to the battery, when a splendid crushing was a certainty.&rdquo; Meanwhile Tommy  Prince was gaily journeying down with Hugh to the buffalo camp.</p>
<p>Prince, a typical moleskin-trousered, cotton-shirted,  cabbage-tree-hatted bushman, soon fixed up all details. He annexed the horses  belonging to the store, sagely remarking that, as Hugh had saved their owner&rsquo;s  life, he could afford to let him have a few horses. He also helped himself to  pack-saddles, camping gear, supplies, and all sorts of odds and ends&mdash;not  forgetting a couple of gallons of rum, mosquito-nets made of cheese cloth,  blankets, and a rifle and cartridges. They fitted out the expedition in fine  style, while unconscious Sampson slept the sleep of the half-drowned. The  placid Chinese cook fried great lumps of goat for them to eat, heedless of all  things except his opium-pipe, to which he had recourse in the evening, the  curious dreamy odour of the opium blending strangely with the aromatic scent of  the bush.</p>
<p>At daylight they started, and for three days rode through the  wilderness, camping out at night, while the horses with bells and hobbles  grazed round the camp. Tommy Prince steered a course by instinct, guided as  unerringly as the Israelites by their pillar of fire.</p>
<p>By miles of trackless, worthless wilderness, by rolling open  plains, by rocky ranges and stony passes, they pushed out and ever further out,  till at last, one day, Tommy said, &ldquo;They ought to be hereabouts, some place.&rdquo;  So saying, he dropped a lighted match into a big patch of grass, and in a few  seconds a line of fire half a mile wide was roaring across the plain; above it  rose smoke as of a burning city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll see that,&rdquo; said Tommy, &ldquo;without the buff&rsquo;loes have got  &rsquo;em.&rdquo; So they camped for the day under a huge banyan-fig tree and awaited  developments. About evening, away on the horizon, there arose an answering  cloud of smoke, connecting earth and sky, like a waterspout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s them,&rdquo; said Tommy. They climbed once more into their  saddles, and set out. Just as the sun was setting, they saw a singular  procession coming towards them. In front rode two small, wiry, hard-featured,  inexpressibly dirty men on big well-formed horses. They wore dungaree trousers,  which had once been blue, but were now begrimed and bloodstained to a dull  neutral colour. Their shirts&mdash;once coloured, but now nearly black&mdash;were worn  outside the trousers, like a countryman&rsquo;s smock frock, and were drawn in at the  waist by broad leathern belts full of cartridges. Their faces were half-hidden  by stubbly beards, and their bright alert eyes looked out from under the brims  of two as dilapidated felt hats as ever graced head of man. Each carried a  carbine between thigh and saddle. These were the buffalo shooters.</p>
<p>Behind them rode an elderly, grizzled man, whom Hugh had no  difficulty in recognising as Keogh, or Considine. Following him were some seven  or eight packhorses, all heavily laden with hides. And behind the packhorses  rode three or four naked blacks and a Chinaman.</p>
<p>Hugh&rsquo;s guide at once made himself welcome in his happy-go-lucky  style. He introduced Hugh as Mr Lambton, from New South Wales. The buffalo shooters made  him welcome after the fashion of their kind; but Considine was obviously  uneasy, and avoided him, riding with Tommy Prince for a while, and evidently  trying to find out what Hugh had come for.</p>
<p>That night, when they got to the buffalo shooters&rsquo; camp, Hugh  opened fire on Considine. The veteran was in a cheerful mood after his meal,  and Hugh wanted to start diplomatically, thinking he might persuade him. If  that failed he would give him the summons; but he would start&nbsp;<i>suaviter  in modo</i>. When it came to the point, however, he forgot his diplomacy, and  plunged straight into trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve come up here for, Considine,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Hugh Gordon, and I want to find out something about your marriage  with Peggy Donohoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s what you come for, Mister,&rdquo; said the veteran,  pulling a firestick out of the fire, and slowly lighting his pipe, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s  what you come for&rdquo;&mdash;puff, puff, puff&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve come on a wild goose chase. I never  knew no Peggy Donohoe in my life. My wife&rdquo;&mdash;puff&mdash;&ldquo;was a small, dark woman, named  Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you told my brother that you married Peggy Donohoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I might have told him,&rdquo; assented the veteran. &ldquo;Quite likely I  did, but I must ha&rsquo; made a mistake. A man might easy make a mistake over a  thing like that. What odds is it to you who I married, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What odds? Why look here, Considine, it means that my old mother  will be turned out of her home. That&rsquo;s some odds to me, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs, that&rsquo;s right enough, Mister,&rdquo; said the courteous  Considine; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s lots of odds to you, but what I ask you is&mdash;what odds is it to  me? Why should I go and saddle myself with a she-devil just when I&rsquo;m coming  into a bit of money? I&rsquo;d walk miles to do her a bad turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you want to do her a bad turn, come down and block her  getting Mr Grant&rsquo;s estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, an&rsquo; put her on to meself! What next? I tell you, Mister,  straight, I wouldn&rsquo;t have that woman tied to me for all the money in China. That  English bloke said there was a big fortune for me in England. Well, if I have to take  Peggy Donohoe with it, it can stay. I&rsquo;ll live here with the blacks and the  buffalo shooters, and I&rsquo;ll get my livin&rsquo; for meself, same as I got it all my  life; but take on Peggy again I will not. Now, that&rsquo;s Domino&mdash;that&rsquo;s the dead  finish. I won&rsquo;t go with you, and I won&rsquo;t give you no information. And I&rsquo;m sorry  too, &rsquo;cause you seem a good sort of a young feller&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t do anything  that&rsquo;ll mix me up with Peggy any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh ground his teeth with mortification. Then he played his next  card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man they call Flash Jack&mdash;do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do, and perhaps I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the sage in a surly  tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he told me to ask you to help us. He said to tell you that  he particularly wanted you to give evidence if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want&rsquo;ll be his master, then,&rdquo; snarled the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he would put the police on to a job about some cattle at  Cross-roads,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<p>The rage fairly flashed out of Considine&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said that, did he?&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;The rotten informer! Well, you  tell Flash Jack from me that where he can put me away for one thing I can put  him away for half-a-dozen; and if I go into gaol for a five-stretch he goes in  for ten. I ain&rsquo;t afraid of Flash Jack, nor you either. See that, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh felt that his mission had failed. He pulled out the summons  as a last resource, and passed it to the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Summons to give evidence,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Victoria  by the Grace of God,&rdquo; read the old man, by the flickering firelight. &ldquo;Victoria by the Grace of  God, eh? Well, see here,&rdquo; he continued, solemnly putting the summons in the  fire and watching it blaze, &ldquo;if Victoria by the Grace of God wants me, she can  send for me&mdash;send a coach and six for Patrick Henry Considine, late Patrick  Henry Keogh! And then I mightn&rsquo;t go! There&rsquo;ll be only one thing make me go  where I don&rsquo;t want to go, and that&rsquo;s a policemen at each elbow and another  shovin&rsquo; behind. I&rsquo;d sooner do a five-stretch than take Peggy back again. And  that&rsquo;s the beginning and the end and the middle of it. And now I&rsquo;ll wish you  goodnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
  The Saving of Considine</b></h2>
<p>At grey dawn all the camp was  astir. Hugh looked from under his mosquito net, and saw old Considine over the  fire, earnestly frying a large hunk of buffalo meat. He was without a trouble  in the world as he turned the hissing steak in the pan. Two black gins in brief  garments&mdash;a loin cloth and a villainously dirty pyjama-jacket each&mdash;were sitting  near him, languidly killing the mosquitoes which settled on their bare legs.  These were Maggie and Lucy, but they had degenerated with their surroundings.  Tommy Prince was oiling a carbine, and one of the shooters was washing his face  at a basin formed by scratching a small hole in the ground and pressing a  square of canvas into the depression. </p>
<p>The Chinese skinner was sitting on a log, rubbing a huge butcher&rsquo;s  knife on a sharpening stone. Away up the plain the horses, about thirty or  forty in number, were slowly trooping into camp, hunted by a couple of  blackfellows, naked except for little grass armlets worn above the elbow, and  sticks stuck through their noses. When the horses reached the camp they formed  a squadron under the shade of some trees, and pushed and shoved and circled  about, trying to keep the flies off themselves and each other.</p>
<p>Hugh walked over to Tommy Prince at his rifle-oiling, and watched  him for a while. That worthy, who was evidently a true sportsman at heart, was  liberally baptising with Rangoon  oil an old and much rusted Martini carbine, whose ejector refused to work.  Every now and then, when he thought he had got it ship-shape, Tommy would put  in a fresh cartridge, hold the carbine tightly to his shoulder, shut his eyes,  and fire it into space. The rusty old weapon kicked frightfully, after each  discharge the ejector jammed, and Tommy ruefully poked the exploded cartridge  out with a rod and poured on more oil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blast the carbine!&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;It kicks upwards like; it&rsquo;s  kicking my nose all skewwhiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put it to your shoulder, you fool,&rdquo; said one of the  shooters; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll kick your head off. Hold it out in one hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;ll kick my arm off,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t; you won&rsquo;t feel it at all,&rdquo; said the shooter. &ldquo;Your  arm will give to the recoil. Blaze away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you up to with the carbine?&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a blaze at some of these &rsquo;ere buff&rsquo;loes,&rdquo; said  Tommy gaily. &ldquo;Bill&rsquo;s lent me a horse. They&rsquo;s got a rifle for you, and one for  the old man. We&rsquo;ll give them buff&rsquo;loes hell today. Five rifles&mdash;they&rsquo;ll think  the French is after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but I want to get back,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t waste any  time. What about the storekeeper&rsquo;s horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! it&rsquo;d never do to take them straight back again,&rdquo; said Tommy.  &ldquo;Never do. They must have a spell. Besides, what&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Hugh, recognising that for all the good he could do he might  just as well not hurry back again, resigned himself to the inevitable, picked  up his bridle, went into the shuffling herd of horses, and caught the one  pointed out to him. It was a big, raw-boned, ragged-hipped bay, a horse that  would have been a gentleman under any other conditions, but from long buffalo  hunting had become a careless-going, loose-jointed ruffian, taking his life in  his hands every day. He bit savagely at Hugh as he saddled him, and altogether  proclaimed himself devoid of self-respect and the finer instincts.</p>
<p>Breakfast was despatched almost in silence. The shooters knew  vaguely that Hugh&rsquo;s visit was in some way connected with Considine, and that  Considine had refused to do what Hugh wanted. But the hospitality of the  buffalo camp is as the hospitality of the Arabs of old&mdash;the stranger is made  welcome whatever his business, and may come and go unquestioned.</p>
<p>Hugh had little desire to talk on the subject of his visit, and  Considine maintained a dogged silence. Tommy Prince alone chatted away affably  between large mouthfuls of buffalo beef, damper, and tea, airing his views on  all subjects, but principally on the fair sex. Meanwhile the blacks were  catching the packhorses, and sharpening their skinning knives. The two horses  used by the shooters were brought over to the camp fire and given a small feed  each of much-prized maize and oats and bran, that had been brought round in the  lugger from Port Faraway with the camp supplies, landed on the river-bank  twelve miles off, and fetched in on packhorses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little more beef, Mister? No? Well, all aboard for the Buffalo  Brigade! That&rsquo;s your rifle by the tree. Put this cartridge-belt on and buckle  it real tight; if you leave it loose, when you start to gallop it will shake up  and down, and shake the soul out of you. Come, Paddy, what are you riding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&nbsp;going to ride the boco (one-eyed horse).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I was you. He&rsquo;s all right to race up to a buffalo,  but that blind eye of his&rsquo;ll fetch him to grief some day. Ride the old grey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; said the old man obstinately, &ldquo;the boco&rsquo;s one eye&rsquo;s  worth any horse&rsquo;s two. Me an&rsquo; the boco will be near the lead when the whips are  crackin&rsquo;, take it from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh clambered on to his raw-boned steed, known as &ldquo;Close Up&rdquo;,  because he would go so close to the buffaloes, and the procession started. The  five white men rode ahead, all smoking with great enjoyment. Hugh was beside  one of the shooters, and opened conference with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about this business,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;but never  hoped to see it. What are these Australian buffaloes? I thought they were just  humped cattle like those little Brahmin cattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People reckon they&rsquo;re the Indian buffalo,&rdquo; said the bushman.  &ldquo;They were fetched here about fifty years ago from Java&mdash;just a few pair, and  they were let go and went wild, and now they&rsquo;re all over the face of the earth  about here. We&rsquo;ve shot six hundred of &rsquo;em&mdash;just the two rifles&mdash;in six months.  It&rsquo;s not play, I tell you, to shoot and skin six hundred and cure their hides  in that time. We&rsquo;ll get a thousand this season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they be shot out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not they. There&rsquo;s about eight thousand of &rsquo;em shot every year for  their hides, and it&rsquo;s just like the ordinary increase of a big cattle station.  They&rsquo;re all over these plains, and for miles and miles away down the coast, and  in the jungles there&rsquo;s thousands of &rsquo;em. There&rsquo;s jungles here that are a  hundred miles round, and no animal but a buffalo will go into &rsquo;em. The blacks  say that inside them there&rsquo;s big patches of clear plain, with grass and water,  where there&rsquo;s buffaloes as thick as bees; but you can&rsquo;t get at &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you shoot &rsquo;em?&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Race right up alongside &rsquo;em, and put the carbine out with one  hand, and shoot downwards into the loin. That&rsquo;s the only way to drop &rsquo;em. You  can shoot bullets into &rsquo;em by the hatful everywhere else, and they just turn  and charge; and while you are dodging round, first you huntin&rsquo; the buffalo, and  then the buffalo huntin&rsquo; you, the rest of the mob are out of sight. You must go  right up alongside, close enough to touch &rsquo;em with the barrel, and fire  down&mdash;so.&rdquo; He illustrated with the carbine as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whatever you do, don&rsquo;t pull your horse about; he knows the  game, if you don&rsquo;t. Never stop your horse near a wounded buffalo, either. They  make a rush as sudden as lightnin&rsquo;. They look clumsy and big; but, my oath, a  wounded one can hop along something wonderful! They&rsquo;ll surprise you for pace  any time; but most of all when they&rsquo;re wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they always come at you when they&rsquo;re wounded?&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; said the shooter, &ldquo;and very often when they&rsquo;re not  wounded they&rsquo;ll turn and charge if you&rsquo;ve run &rsquo;em a long way. You want to look  out, I tell you. They&rsquo;ll wheel very sudden, and if they ketch your horse  they&rsquo;ll grind him into pulp. Pen, my mate here, had a horse killed under him  last week&mdash;horse we gave five and twenty quid for, and that&rsquo;s a long shot for a  buffalo horse. I believe in Injia they shoot &rsquo;em off elephants, but that&rsquo;s  &rsquo;cause they won&rsquo;t come out in the open like they do here. There&rsquo;s hundreds of  toffs in England  and Injia&rsquo;d give their ears for a day after these, you know. Hello! Look! See  there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far away out on the plain Hugh saw fifteen or twenty bluish-grey  mounds in a line rising above the grass; it was a herd of buffalo feeding. The  animals never lifted their heads, and were curiously like a lot of railway  trucks covered with grey tarpaulin. It was impossible to tell which was head  and which was tail. A short halt was made while girths were tightened,  cartridges slipped into place, and hats jammed on; they all mounted and rode  slowly towards the herd, which was at least half a mile off, and still feeding  steadily. Everyone kept his horse in hand, ready for a dash the moment the mob  lifted their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fast will they go?&rdquo; whispered Hugh to the nearest shooter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fast as blazes. You&rsquo;ve no idea how fast they are. They&rsquo;re the  biggest take-in there is. When they lift their heads they&rsquo;ll stare for half a  minute, and then they&rsquo;ll run. The moment they start, off you go. Watch &rsquo;em!  There&rsquo;s one sees us! Keep steady yet&mdash;don&rsquo;t rush till they start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the blue mounds lifted a huge black-muzzled head, decorated  with an enormous pair of sickleshaped horns that stretched right back to the  shoulders. He stared with great sullen eyes and trotted a few paces towards  them; one after another, the rest lifted their heads and stared too. Closer  drew the horsemen at their steady, silent jog, the horses pricking their ears  and getting on their toes as racehorses do at the start of a race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be ready,&rdquo; said the shooter. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mob, with one impulse, wheeled, and set off at a heavy  lumbering gallop, and the horses dashed in full gallop after them. It was a  ride worth a year of a man&rsquo;s life. Every man sat down to his work like a jockey  finishing a race, and the big stock horses went through the long grass like  hawks swooping down on a flock of pigeons. The men carried their carbines loaded,  holding them straight up over the shoulder so as to lessen the jerking of the  wrist caused by the gallop.</p>
<p>The surface of the plain was level enough, but frightfully bad  going; the sun had baked the black soil till great gaping cracks, a couple of feet  wide and ten feet deep, were opened in the ground. The buffaloes had wallowed  in the wet season and made round well-like holes that were now hard, dry  pitfalls. Here and there a treacherous, slimy watercourse wound its slinking  way along, making a bog in which a horse would sink to his shoulders; and over  all these traps and pitfalls the long waving junglegrass drew a veil. Every now  and then belts of small bamboo were crossed, into which the horses dashed  blindly, forcing their way through by their weight. When they started the  buffaloes had a lead of a quarter of a mile, and judging by their slogging,  laboured gallop, it looked as though the horses would run into them in half a  mile; but on that ground the buffaloes could go nearly as fast as the horses,  and it was only after a mile and a quarter of hard riding that they closed in  on the mob, which at once split into several detachments. A magnificent old  bull, whose horns measured ten feet from tip to tip, dashed away to the right  with six or seven cows lumbering after him. Hugh and one of the shooters  followed this lot. Another mob went away to the left, pursued by the other  shooter and Considine; while one old cow, having had enough running, suddenly  wheeled in her tracks, and charged straight at Tommy Prince, whose horse at  once whipped round and carried his rider, with the old cow at his tail, into a  clump of bamboos. Hugh followed his mate as hard as he could, both horses  feeling the pace, and pecking and blundering every now and again in the broken  ground. Once Hugh saw a buffalo-wallow suddenly appear right under his horse&rsquo;s  nose, and half-flinched, expecting a certain fall; but old &ldquo;Close Up&rdquo; strode  over it, apparently having a leg to spare for emergencies of the sort.</p>
<p>Just ahead of him the shooter, sitting down in his saddle, lifted  his horse with a drive of the spurs, and came right alongside the hindmost  animal, a fat blue cow, which at once swerved at right angles; but the horse  followed her every movement, and drew up till horse and buffalo were racing  side by side. Then without fuss or hurry, up went the elbow of the rider and  bang! the buffalo fell as if paralysed, shot through the loins. The horse swung  away from the falling animal as it crashed to the ground; and the shooter,  still going at full gallop, methodically ejected the used cartridge and put in  another without losing his place at the tail of the flying mob. The noise of  the carbine made the mob divide, and Hugh found himself going full speed after  three that came his way. Wild with excitement, he drove Close Up after the  nearest, and made ready to fire at the right moment. The long gallop had winded  him; his arm was almost numbed with the strain of carrying the carbine, which  now seemed to weigh a ton.</p>
<p>Close Up, true to his name, made a dash at the nearest buffalo,  and got close enough in all conscience; but what with the jerking to and fro of  the gallop, and the rolling gait and sudden swerves of the buffalo, and the  occasional blunderings of the horse in broken ground, Hugh never seemed to have  the carbine pointed right. Close Up, finding it did not go off when he  expected, began to slacken pace and gallop in an undecided way. It sounds easy  enough to gallop up to an animal which you can beat for pace, but anyone who  has ever tried to lay a whip on the back of a bullock knows it is not so easy  as it looks to get more than one or two clips home. Hugh found the buffalo  holding its own for pace, and every time he drew up it dodged before he could  make sure of hitting the loin. Cover seemed to be getting very near. At last he  leaned out as far as he could, held the rifle in one hand, and took a  &ldquo;speculator&rdquo; at the flying buffalo. He hit it somewhere, but hadn&rsquo;t time to see  where; for, with a snort like a grampus, the beast wheeled in its tracks and  charged so suddenly that old Close Up only just dodged it by a yard or two. It  rushed past him for a couple of hundred yards, and then stopped. Hugh managed  to eject the cartridge and load, and then cantered after the animal, which had  started again at a sullen trot, with the blood pouring from its flank. As he  galloped up to administer the &ldquo;<i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>&rdquo;, meaning to make no  mistake about hitting the loin this time, the buffalo suddenly wheeled and  charged him again, and &ldquo;Close Up&rdquo; executed another hurried retreat. For a while  they took it up and down&mdash;first buffalo hunting man, then man hunting  buffalo&mdash;while Hugh fired whenever he had the chance, without seeming to  discompose the brute at all. At last a lucky shot struck some vital spot  inside; the beast stopped, staggered, and fell dead without a sound. Hugh  looked round. He was alone; his mate was just visible far away over the plain,  still following at full speed a blue mound that struggled doggedly on towards  the timber. The grey horse drew up to his quarry, the man leant forward, there  was a sudden spurt of white smoke, and the animal fell as if struck by  lightning. It was very pretty to watch, and looked as simple as shelling peas.  The shooter rode over to Hugh, and congratulated him on his first kill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got all that mob that came our way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;seven of &rsquo;em.  Yours makes eight. There&rsquo;s Ben after some still, and there&rsquo;s Tommy Prince back  at the bamboos firing at something. Firing this way, too, damn him! Look at  Ben!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far away on the plain, like puppets in the distance, went the  swiftly gliding figures of man and horse. In front of them dimly seen objects  tore through the grass; every now and again out went an arm, there was a spurt  of smoke, and another buffalo fell. The blacks and the Chinaman were away  behind, gathered in a cluster, skinning the first beast killed, while the  packhorses cropped the grass and bit at the flies. Considine was nowhere to be  seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back and see what Tommy is up to,&rdquo; said the shooter.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a hard case, is Tommy. If there&rsquo;s any trouble about he&rsquo;ll get into it, or  get somebody else into it. He&rsquo;ll wing one of us in a minute, the way he&rsquo;s  blazing. What&rsquo;s he firing at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the festive Tommy was seen to dash hurriedly out of the  patch of bamboo, with the old original buffalo cow so close to his horse&rsquo;s tail  that, if the horse stumbled, the cow had him at her mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;im!&rdquo; yelled the shooter. &ldquo;Good cow! Can&rsquo;t she steam?  Come on, and let&rsquo;s see the fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while it looked any odds on the cow; then she slackened  pace, wheeled round, and bolted back to the bamboos. They found Tommy very  excited. He had used about eighteen cartridges, and had nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most underhand cow ever I seen!&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;She runs  into them there bamboos and pretends she&rsquo;s going to run right clean through to Queensland, and when I  go in after her, she wheels round and hunts me for my life. Near had me twice,  she did. Every time I fire the old carbine, it jams, and I have to get the rod  to it. Gimme your rifle, Waiter, and I&rsquo;ll go in and finish her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have a lead-mine in her already,&rdquo; said the shooter.  &ldquo;Mind she don&rsquo;t ketch you, Tommy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy went in, but couldn&rsquo;t find a sign of the cow. While they  were talking she had slipped along the belt of bamboos, and was then, no doubt,  waiting for a chance to rush somebody. As no one cared to chance riding on to  her in that jungle, she escaped with the honours of war. The other shooter came  up, having shot nine, and reported that Considine had had a fall, his horse,  not being used to the country, had plunged up to his shoulders in a concealed  buffalo-wallow, and turned right over on him. Luckily, the buffalo he was after  was well ahead, and did not turn to charge him, but he was very much shaken; when  he came up, however, he insisted on going on. They set to work to find the rest  of the dead buffaloes&mdash;no easy matter in that long grass&mdash;and all hands commenced  skinning. This job kept them till noonday, when they camped under some trees  for their midday meal, hobbling the horses. Then they rested for an hour or  two, packed the hides on the packhorses (and heavily loaded they were, each  hide weighing about a hundredweight), and went back to the hunt, scanning the  plain carefully.</p>
<p>They were all riding together through a belt of timber, the blacks  and the Chinaman being well up with the packhorses, when suddenly the blacks  burst out with great excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buff&rsquo;lo! Buff&rsquo;lo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, a huge blue bull&mdash;a regular old patriarch, that had  evidently been hunted out of a herd, and was camping by himself in the  timber&mdash;made a rush out of some thick trees, and set off towards a dense jungle,  that could be seen half a mile or so away. Hugh and Considine were nearest him,  each with his rifle ready, and started after him together, full gallop through  the timber. The old man was evidently anxious to make up for his morning&rsquo;s  failure, and to take Hugh down a peg, for he set a fearful pace through the  trees, grazing one and gliding under the boughs of another as only a trained  bush-rider can. Hugh, coming from the mountains, was no duffer in timbered  country either, and the two of them went at a merry pace for a while. The bull  was puzzled by having two pursuers, and often in swerving from one or the other  would hit a tree with his huge horns, and fairly bounce off it. He never  attempted to turn, but kept straight on, and they drew on to him in silence,  almost side by side, riding jealously for the first shot. Considine was on the  wrong side, and had to use the carbine on the near side of his horse; but he  was undeniably a good rider, and laughed grimly as he got first alongside, and,  leaning over, prepared to fire. Then a strange thing happened. Before he could  fire, the buffalo bull tripped on a stump and fell on his knees, causing  Considine&rsquo;s horse to shoot almost past him. As the bull rose again, he sprang  savagely sideways, bringing his huge head up from beneath, and fairly impaled  the horse on his horn. It gave a terrible scream, and reared over.</p>
<p>The old man never lost his nerve. Almost as he fell he fired down  into the buffalo&rsquo;s shoulder, but the bullet had no effect. Man and horse were  fetched smashing to the ground, the man pinned under the horse&rsquo;s body. The bull  hesitated a second before hurling himself upon the two; and in that second Hugh  jumped from his horse, ran up, stood over the fallen man, holding out the rifle  like a pistol with the muzzle an inch off the bull&rsquo;s head and fired. A  buffalo&rsquo;s skull is an inch and a half thick, solid bone, as hard as granite; but  a Martini carbine, sighted for a thousand yards, will pierce it like paper at  short range. The smoke had not cleared away when the huge beast fell to the  ground within two feet of his intended victims. Hugh pulled Considine from  under the horse. The unfortunate beast struggled to his feet, with blood  gushing from a terrible wound in the belly, ran fifty yards, and fell dead.</p>
<p>The old man looked round him in silence. &ldquo;Serve me damn well  right,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I ought to have got the other side of the buffalo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not another word did he say, as he transferred his saddle to one  of the blacks&rsquo; horses. But in the camp, that night, the old man came over to  Hugh holding a paper in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something for you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the certificate of  my weddin&rsquo; with Peggy Donohoe. The parson gev us each one. That ought to do  you, oughtn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll come down with you, as soon as you like, and give all  the evidence you want. I&rsquo;ll chance how I get on with Peg. I&rsquo;ll divorce her, or  poison her, or get shut of her somehow. But after what you done to-day I&rsquo;m on  Grant&rsquo;s side, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And off he stalked to bed, while Hugh talked long with Tommy  Prince and the buffalo shooters of the best way to get down to the wire and  send the news of his success. He went to bed the happiest man south of the  line; and next day, saying goodbye to his hospitable friends, he started off  with Considine and Tommy on the road to the telegraph, and thence to  civilisation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Real Certificate</b></h2>
<p>As the day of the great case approached Blake got more restless  and irritable. He had heard of Hugh&rsquo;s going away to look for a witness; but  Peggy and Red Mick, in their ignorance, had thought it best to keep all  knowledge of the Considine flaw from their lawyer&mdash;a mistake that wiser people  than they sometimes make. Blake suspected nothing. He had more than once seen  Mary Grant and Ellen Harriott in Tarrong, but he was again an outcast,  relegated to the society of such as Isaacstein.</p>
<p>Well, he would see it out, and would yet make these people glad to  crawl to him. Ellen Harriott he never spoke to. However the case went and  whoever won, she could be of no use to him, so he decided to include her among  his enemies; and though she went deathly white when she saw him she made no  sign of recognition. There was one thing, however, which he had to do before  taking the case into Court, and that was to secure a fair share of the spoil  for himself. He had no intention of slaving at the case, perhaps for years, for  what he would get as costs. So, a week or two before the case was due to come  on, he sent for Peggy and Red Mick.</p>
<p>It was a hot summer day when Peggy came in. Out of doors there was  a blinding glare, and the heat had drawn the scent out of the unseasoned pine  with which Tarrong was mostly built, till the air was filled with a sort of  incense. Peggy came in hot and short-tempered. The strain was beginning to tell  on her nerves, and, from a remark or two she let fall, Blake saw that she might  be inclined to give trouble if not promptly brought into subjection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent for you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis, and the fust thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He interrupted her sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing is, how much am I going to get out of this case  if I win it? That is the first thing. You don&rsquo;t suppose I am going to spend  time and money and fight this case through all the Courts in the land, and get  nothing out of it, do you? How much am I to get? We&rsquo;ll settle that before we go  any further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll ask Mick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll ask nobody. Mick isn&rsquo;t Grant&rsquo;s widow, and you are of age,  goodness knows. How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much d&rsquo;ye want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want one-third of what you get. That&rsquo;ll leave you nearly a  million of money. There will be well over a million to divide. There will be a  big lawsuit, and lots of appeals, and if I am to see it through it will cost a  great lot of money; so if I win I mean to make it pay me. That&rsquo;s my figure.  One-third. Take it or leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy wriggled about, but knew that she would have to give in. It  was a reasonable proposal, as things stood; but she did not like the way in  which she had been bullied. She looked at Blake queerly. &ldquo;If we have to give ye  a third, ye may as well know all about it. Ye&rsquo;ll be a partner like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake stared at her. He could not guess what she was driving at.  Peggy slowly drew out of a handbag a faded piece of paper and handed it to him  without a word. It was the original marriage certificate, the same that Ellen  Harriott had seen at Red Mick&rsquo;s. He unfolded it and spread it out on the table.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certify that I, Thomas Nettleship,&rdquo; he mumbled through the  formula, then, sharply: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this name doing here? Who is Patrick Henry  Keogh? Is there such a person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis,&rdquo; said Peggy, boiling up. &ldquo;A long slab-sided useless feller.  He&rsquo;s gone to live wid the blacks. He&rsquo;ll never come back. Most like he&rsquo;s dead by  this time, speared or the like of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few seconds Blake, the cool, audacious gambler, was dazed,  in spite of his natural selfconfidence. He saw how he had been duped. Peggy had  married this other man, whoever he was, and had used the facts of the real  marriage to give her the details for her imaginary one, while in copying the  certificate she had, with considerable foresight, filled in Grant&rsquo;s name  instead of that of Keogh.</p>
<p>All Blake&rsquo;s castles in the air, his schemes for revenge, his hopes  of wealth, had vanished at one fell swoop. &ldquo;Patrick Henry Keogh&rdquo; seemed to grin  up at him out of the paper. His case had crumbled about his ears; his defeat  would be known all over the district, and nothing could much longer stave off  the inevitable exposure of his misappropriations. But he was a fighter all  over, and he still saw a chance to pull things through.</p>
<p>He wasted no words on Peggy. &ldquo;Go and get Mick to come here,&rdquo; he  said, and Mick, still somewhat lopsided about the face from his accident, was  soon in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mick,&rdquo; said Blake, &ldquo;your sister has told me something very  important that ought to have been told me before. It&rsquo;s no good crying over  spilt milk. There&rsquo;s still a chance. If Peggy and Martin tell the same story  they told me at first, they will win the case. This Keogh must be dead, or too  frightened to show up. If you stick to your story you will win. It&rsquo;s a million  of money. Will you chance it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the sertiffykit?&rdquo; said Mick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me,&rdquo; said Blake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to that. I suppose no  one knows the rights of this but you and Peggy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a million of money. Will you chance it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mick and his sister rose. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go on wid the case,&rdquo; said Mick.  &ldquo;But supposin&rsquo; Keogh turns up&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to take chances in this life,&rdquo; said Blake, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re  after a million that doesn&rsquo;t belong to you. Will you chance it? Share and share  alike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A million,&rdquo; said Mick. &ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll go on wid the case. I  daresay William Grant took the name of Keogh that day he was married,&rdquo; and with  this ingenious suggestion Mick took his sister home, leaving Blake alone in the  office.</p>
<p>After his clients were gone Blake looked at the certificate for a  long time, asking himself, &ldquo;Shall I take the risk or not?&rdquo; He was about to do a  criminal act, and though it was not his first, he flinched every time he  crossed the border-line. He lifted his hand, and hesitated; then he remembered  his dismissal from Kuryong, and caught sight of a dunning letter lying on his  table. That decided him. The risk was worth taking. The danger was great, but  the stake was worth it. He took an eraser, made a few swift light strokes on  the paper over the almost illegible writing, and &ldquo;Patrick Henry Keogh&rdquo;  disappeared; on the space that it had occupied he wrote &ldquo;William Grant,&rdquo; in  faint strokes of a pencil. He had crossed the border-line of crime once more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter  28<br>
</b><b>A  Legal Battle</b></h2>
<p>And now, after hauling the  reader pretty well all over Australia&mdash;from mountain station to outback holding,  from cattle camp to buffalo run&mdash;we must ask him to take a seat in the Supreme  Court at Sydney, to hear the trial of the &ldquo;great Grant Will Case&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Gavan Blake had made no effort towards compromise. He knew the  risk he was running, but he had determined to see it through. The love, the  ambition, the hope that had once possessed him had turned to a grim desperate  hatred, and he would risk everything rather than withdraw the case. He kept Red  Mick and Peggy up to the mark with assurances that she was certain to win.  Neither he nor they knew that Considine had been found. Even the most  respectable solicitors sometimes display acuteness, and the old man&rsquo;s return  had been kept secret by Pinnock, so that public opinion anticipated Peggy&rsquo;s  victory.</p>
<p>At last came the day of trial. Every seat in the Court was filled,  and a mass of the unwashed hung over the gallery rail, gazing at the show  provided for their entertainment. Mary Grant and Mrs. Gordon went into Court at  the suggestion of their leading Counsel, Bouncer, Q.C., who was nothing if not  theatrical. He wanted them there to see the overthrow of the enemy, and to lend  point to his invective against the intruders who were trying to take away their  birthright. A small army of Doyles and Donohoes, who had come down for the  case, were hanging about dressed in outlandish garments, trying to look as if  they would not tell a lie for untold gold. The managing clerks were in and out  like little dogs at a fair, hunting up witnesses, scanning the jury list,  arranging papers for production, and keeping a wary eye on the enemy.  Punctually as the clock struck ten, the Judge strutted into Court with as much  pomp as a man-of-war sailing into a small port; depositing himself on the  Bench, he glared round for a few seconds, and said to the associate, &ldquo;Call the  first case,&rdquo; in a matter-of-fact tone, just as if he did not know what the  first case was going to be. A little rustle went round the Court as people  settled themselves down for the battle.</p>
<p>The case for Peggy was set forth by the great Jewish barrister,  Manasseh, Q.C. He was famous for his skill in enlisting the sympathies of the  jury from the outset. He drew a moving picture of the sorrows of Peggy,  disowned by her husband&rsquo;s relatives, and the case proceeded so far that he had  put the marriage certificate in evidence when Blake, who had been away for a  few minutes rushed into Court and touched Manasseh on the shoulder, bringing  him to an abrupt stop.</p>
<p>Manasseh asked the Judge to excuse him for a moment while he  conferred with his juniors and Blake. After a short but excited conference he  rose again and&mdash;but first we must hear what had happened outside.</p>
<p>While all concerned were in Court listening to Manasseh, Considine  had been smuggled into the witnesses&rsquo; room and, being bored and worried, had  strayed into the verandah of the Court buildings. He had been hauled into  consultations with barristers, and examined and badgered and worried to death.  The hard Sydney  pavements had made his feet sore. The city ways were not his ways, and the mere  mental effort of catching trains and omnibuses, and keeping appointments, and  having fixed mealtimes, was inexpressibly wearing to a man who had never been  tied to time in his life.</p>
<p>And what a dismal prospect he had before him! To go over to England and  take up a position for which he was wholly unfitted, without a friend who would  understand his ideas, and in whom he could confide. Then his thoughts turned to  Peggy&mdash;Peggy, square-built, determined, masterful, capable; just the very person  to grapple with difficulties; a woman whose nerve a regiment of duchesses would  fail to shake. He thought of her many abilities, and admitted to himself that  after all was said and done, if he had only been able to gratify her wishes  (and they did not seem so extravagant now) she would have been a perfect  helpmate for him. His mind went back to the weird honeymoon at Pike&rsquo;s pub, to  the little earthen-floored dining-room, with walls of sacking and a slab table,  over which Peggy presided with such force of character. He thought of the two  bushmen whom Peggy had nursed through the fever with rough tenderness; and  then, turning suddenly, he found Peggy standing at his elbow.</p>
<p>For a second neither spoke. Then Considine said, with an air of  forced jauntiness, &ldquo;Well, Peggy, you won&rsquo;t be comin&rsquo; to England with  me, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t been asked,&rdquo; said Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you was goin&rsquo; to settle at Kiley&rsquo;s Crossin&rsquo;, lending  money to the cockatoos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy looked at him with a meaning glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye should know me better nor that, Paddy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>This cleared the way tremendously. The gaunt bushman hitched  himself a little nearer, and spoke in an insinuating way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty tired of  this case meself, I dunno how you feel about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired!&rdquo; said Peggy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wore out. Fair wore out,&rdquo; and she heaved  a sigh like an elephant. That sigh did for old Considine. Hurriedly he  unburdened his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look-ee here, Peggy&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got whips of stuff now, and I&rsquo;ve  got to go to England  for it. You come along o&rsquo; me again, and we&rsquo;ll knock all this business on the  head. Let the Gordons alone&mdash;they&rsquo;re decent young fellows, the both of &rsquo;em&mdash;and  come along o&rsquo; me to England.  That young English feller reckons we&rsquo;d be as good as the Prince of Wales, very  near. Will you come, Peggy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is the characteristic of great minds to think quickly, and act  promptly. Peggy did both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mick!&rdquo; she said, calling to her brother in a sharp, authoritative  voice: &ldquo;Mick! I&rsquo;ve been talking to Paddy here, and we&rsquo;ve reckoned we&rsquo;ve had  enough of this fooling, and we&rsquo;re off to England. You go in and tell old  Fuzzy-Head&rdquo; (she meant the Judge) &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m tired of this case, and I ain&rsquo;t  goin&rsquo; on wid it. Come on, Paddy, will we go and get some tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there&rsquo;s some tremenjus fine opals in a shop down this  way I&rsquo;ll buy you!&rdquo; said Considine, as they started to walk away from the Court.</p>
<p>At that moment Blake came out of Court, saw them, and stepped in  front of Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this man?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Peggy had never quite forgiven his domineering at Tarrong, and  turned on him with a snap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my &rsquo;usband,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mr Patrick Henery Considine. Him  whose name is put down as Keogh on the marriage stiffykit I give you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Blake knew that he had played and lost&mdash;lost hopelessly,  irretrievably. But there was yet something to do to secure his own safety. He  rushed back into Court, and whispered a few words to Manasseh; and Manasseh,  after the short conference we mentioned some pages back, rose and informed the  Court that his client withdrew her claim. Now, while Blake was out of Court, Mr  Bouncer, Mary&rsquo;s counsel, had got from the Judge&rsquo;s Associate the certificate  that had been put in evidence. Ellen Harriott, sitting with Mary and Mrs Gordon  behind him, gave a little cry of surprise when she saw the paper. She touched  Mr Bouncer on the shoulder, and for a few seconds they held an excited dialogue  in whispers.</p>
<p>So Mr Bouncer rose as Manasseh sat down, with a smile of  satisfaction on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must object to any withdrawal, your Honour,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My  client&rsquo;s vast interests are still liable to be assailed by any claimant. I wish  your Honour to insist that the case be heard. A claim has been made here of a  most dastardly nature, and I submit that your Honour will not allow the  claimants to withdraw without some investigation. I will ask your Honour to put  Gavan Blake in the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Manasseh objected. He said that there was no longer any case  before the Court; and Gavan Blake, white to the lips, waited for the Judge&rsquo;s  decision. As he waited, he looked round and caught the eye of Ellen Harriott.  Cool, untroubled, the heavy-lidded eyes met his, and he saw no hope there. She  had neither forgiven nor forgotten.</p>
<p>Now, it so happened that the Judge felt rather baulked at the  sudden collapse of the big case, in which he intended to play a star part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to put plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney in the box, Mr  Bouncer?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to examine him as to how and when the name of William  Grant got on that certificate. I have evidence to prove that the name on it,  only a few months ago, was that of Patrick Keogh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, hum!&rdquo; said the little Judge. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;eh&mdash;um&mdash;that I can  decide anything&mdash;ah&mdash;whatever. Case is withdrawn. Ha, hum. But in the interests  of justice, and seeing&mdash;seeing, I say,&rdquo; he went on, warming to his work as the  question laid itself open before him, &ldquo;that there is serious suspicion of fraud  and forgery, it would be wrong on my part to allow the case to close without  some investigation in the interests of justice. As to Mr Manasseh&rsquo;s objection,  that the Court is&nbsp;<i>functus officio</i>&nbsp;so far as this case is  concerned, I uphold that contention; but, in exercise of the power that the  Court holds over its officers, I consider that I have the power&mdash;and that I  should exercise the power&mdash;of putting the solicitor in the box to explain how  this document came into its present state. Let Mr Blake go into the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But while the little Judge was delivering his well-rounded  sentences, Blake had slipped out of Court and made off to his lodgings. He had  failed in everything. He might perhaps keep out of gaol; but the blow to his  reputation was fatal. He had played for a big stake and lost, and he saw before  him only drudgery and lifelong shame.</p>
<p>He had reached his lodgings, half-turned at the door, and saw  behind him the Court tipstaff, who had been sent after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Judge wants you back at the Court, Mr Blake,&rdquo; said the  tipstaff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Wait till I run up to my room for some papers. I&rsquo;ll be  down in a minute,&rdquo; and he ran upstairs.</p>
<p>The tipstaff waited cheerfully enough, until he heard the crack of  a revolver-shot echo through the passages of the big boarding-house. Then he  rushed upstairs&mdash;to find that Gavan Blake had gone before another Court than the  one that was waiting for him so anxiously.</p>

  Races and a Win</b></h2>
<p>After the great case was  over life at Kuryong went on its old round. Mary Grant, now undisputed owner,  took up the reins of government, and Hugh was kept there always on one pretext  or another. </p>
<p>Considine and his wife stayed a while in the district before  starting for England,  and were on the best of terms with the folk at the homestead, Peggy&rsquo;s daring  attempt to seize the estate having been forgiven for her husband&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Mary seemed to take a delicious pleasure in making Hugh come to  her for orders and consultations. She signed without question anything that  Charlie put before her, but Hugh was constantly called in to explain all sorts  of things. The position was difficult in the extreme, although Peggy tried to  give Hugh good advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, the girl&rsquo;s fond of you, Mr Hugh!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you  ask her to marry you? See what a good thing it&rsquo;d be? She&rsquo;s only waitin&rsquo; to be  asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage my own affairs, thank you,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t  likely I&rsquo;m going to ask her now, when I haven&rsquo;t got a penny.&rdquo; He was as  miserable as a man could well be, and was on the point of leaving the station  and going back to the buffalo camp in search of solitude, when an unexpected  incident suddenly brought matters to a climax. A year had slipped by since  William Grant&rsquo;s death, and the glorious spring came round again; the river was  bank-high with the melting of the mountain-snows, the English fruit-trees were  all blossoming, and the willows a-bud. One day the mailman left a large  handbill, announcing the spring race-meeting at Kiley&rsquo;s, a festival sacred, as  a rule, to the Doyles and the Donohoes, at which no outsider had any earthly  chance of winning a race.</p>
<p>In William Grant&rsquo;s time the handbill would have soon reached the  fire-place; he did not countenance running station horses at the local  meetings. Under the new owner things were different. Charlie Gordon was  spoiling for a chance to run Revoke, a backblock purchase, against the locals,  and suggested it in an off-hand sort of way while reading the circular. Hugh  opposed the notion altogether. His opposition apparently made Miss Grant  determined to go on with the scheme, and she gave Charlie&nbsp;<i>carte blanche</i>&nbsp;in  the matter.</p>
<p>When the race-day arrived, there was quite a merry party at the  homestead. Carew was making himself very attentive to Ellen Harriott, Mary was  flirting very openly with Charlie Gordon, to Hugh&rsquo;s intense misery; and it was  whispered about the station that the younger brother would be deposed in favour  of the elder.</p>
<p>Hugh did not want to go to the races, but Mary asked him so  directly that he had no option.</p>
<p>It was a typical Australian spring day. The sky was blue, the air  was fresh, the breeze made great, long, rippling waves in the grass, and every  soul in the place&mdash;Mary in particular&mdash;seemed determined to enjoy it to the  utmost.</p>
<p>Revoke, the station champion, came in first in his race, and was  promptly disqualified for short weight, but Mary didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use of worrying over it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t  really matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been done,&rdquo; said the bushman. &ldquo;Red Mick lent me the  lead-cloth, and helped me saddle up, and I believe he took some lead out while  we were saddling. It never dropped out. That I&rsquo;m sure of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind, Mr Gordon! Forget it! There&rsquo;s your brother, Hugh,  thinks we ought not to have come, and now you are turning sulky. Why do all you  Australian people amuse yourselves so sadly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by sadly,&rdquo; said Charlie, huffed. &ldquo;I  think you ladies had better go home soon. Things are likely to be a bit lively  later on. They have got a door off its hinges and laid on the ground, and a  fiddler playing jigs, and the men and women are dancing each other down; it  won&rsquo;t be long till there&rsquo;ll be a fight, and somebody will get stretched out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, they could see an excited crowd of people gathered  round a fiddler, who was playing away for dear life, and the yells and whoops  told them that partisanship was running high. All the young &ldquo;bloods&rdquo; of the  ranges were there in their very best finery&mdash;cabbage-tree hat (well-tilted back,  and secured by a string under the nose), gaudy cotton shirt, and tweed trousers  of loud pattern, secured round the waist by flaring red or green sashes. In  this garb such as fancied themselves as dancers were taking their turns on the  door. They began by ambling with a sort of strutting walk once or twice round  the circumscribed platform; then, with head well back and eyes closed, dashed  into the steps of the dance, each introducing varied steps and innovations of  his own, which, if intricate and neatly executed, were greeted with great  applause. So it happened that after Jerry the Swell, the recognised champion of  the Doyles, had gone off with an extremely self-satisfied air, some adherents  of young Red Mick, the opposition champion, took occasion to criticise Jerry&rsquo;s  performance. &ldquo;Darnce!&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Jerry the Swell, darnce! Why, we&rsquo;ve got an  old poley cow would darnce him blind! Haven&rsquo;t we, Mick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yairs,&rdquo; said young Mick, with withering emphasis. &ldquo;Darnce! He  can&rsquo;t darnce. I&rsquo;ll run, darnce, jump, or fight any man in the district for two  quid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the challenge could be accepted there was an unexpected  interruption. Hugh had put the big trotting mare in the light trap for Miss  Harriott and Mary to drive home. &ldquo;Gentle Annie&rdquo; was used to racing, and Hugh  warned the girls to be careful in starting her, as she would probably be  excited by the crowd, and then turned back to pack up the racing gear and start  the four-in-hand with the children. As they were putting the racing saddle,  bridles, and other gear into the vehicle, Charlie, who had been fuming ever  since his defeat, caught sight of the missing lead-bag. He picked it up without  a word, and with a fierce gleam in his eye, started over to the group of  dancers, followed hurriedly by Carew. Just as young Mick was repeating his  challenge to run, jump, dance, or fight anybody in the district, Gordon threw  the lead-bag, weighing about six pounds, full in Red Mick&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your lead, you thief!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dance on that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red Mick staggered back a pace or two, picked up an empty bottle  from the ground, and made a dash at Gordon. The latter let out a vicious drive  with his left that caught Mick under the ear and sent him down like a bullock.  In a second the whole crowd surged together in one confused&nbsp;<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>,  everybody hitting at everybody amid a Babel  of shouts and curses. The combat swayed out on to the racecourse, where half a  dozen men fell over the ropes and pulled as many more down with them, and those  that were down fought on the ground, while the others walked on them and fought  over their heads. Carew, who was quite in his element, hit every head he saw,  and knocked his knuckles to pieces on Black Andy Kelly&rsquo;s teeth. The fight he  put up, and the terrific force of his hitting, are traditions among the  mountain men to this day. Charlie Gordon was simply mad with the lust of  fighting, and was locked in a death-grip with Red Mick; they swayed and  struggled on the ground, while the crowd punched at them indiscriminately. In  the middle of all this business, the two ladies and Alick, the eldest of the  children, had started Gentle Annie for home, straight down the centre of the  course. The big mare, hearing the yelling, and recognising that she was once  more on a racetrack, suddenly caught hold of the bit, and came sweeping up the  straight full-stretch, her great legs flying to and fro like pistons. Alick,  who was sitting bodkin between the ladies, simply remarked, &ldquo;Let her head go!&rdquo;  as she went thundering into the crowd, hurling Doyles and Donohoes into the  air, trampling Kellys under foot&mdash;and so out the other side, and away at a 2.30  gait for at least half a mile before the terrified girls could pull her up, and  come back to see what damage had been done.</p>
<p>That ended the fight. The course was covered with wounded and  disabled men. Some had been struck by the mare&rsquo;s hoofs; others had been run  over by the wheels; and a great demand for whisky set in, under cover of which  Gordon and Carew retired to the four-in-hand.</p>
<p>No one was seriously hurt, except &ldquo;Omadhaun&rdquo; Doyle, who had been  struck on the head by the big mare&rsquo;s hoof. He lay very still, breathing  stertorously, and Jerry the Swell took the trouble to come over to the  four-in-hand,and inform them that he thought &ldquo;Omadhaun&rdquo; had got percussion of  the brain, and that things looked very &ldquo;omnibus&rdquo; for him. However, as soon as  he could swallow whisky he was pronounced out of danger, and the Kuryong party  was allowed to depart in peace for home, glad enough to get away. But the two  girls were afraid to drive the big mare, as she was thoroughly roused after her  dash in among the Doyles and Donohoes, and was inclined to show a lot of  temper. A hurried consultation was held, with the result that Ellen Harriott  and Alick were received into the four-in-hand, while Hugh was entrusted with  the task of driving his employer home in the sulky.</p>
<p>Now, a sulky is a vehicle built to accommodate two people only,  and those two people have to sit fairly close together. For a few miles they  spun along in silence, Hugh being well occupied with steadying the mare. From  time to time he looked out of the corner of his eye at his companion; she  looked steadily, almost stolidly, in front of her. Then she began to tap on the  floor of the sulky with her foot. At last she turned on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we didn&rsquo;t win,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I suppose you are glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I be glad, Miss Grant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you said we oughn&rsquo;t to go and race among those people. And  you were right. It served them just right that the mare ran over them. I hope  that none of them are going to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t be much missed,&rdquo; said Hugh wearily. &ldquo;They have  started stealing the sheep again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you catch them?&rdquo; she said, with pretended asperity. &ldquo;If you  went out and hid in a fallen tree, don&rsquo;t you think you could catch them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh looked at her to see if she were in earnest, but she looked  straight in front again and said nothing, still keeping up the slight tapping  of her foot. He flushed a little, and spoke very quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have to resign from your employment, Miss Grant. I  don&rsquo;t care about stopping any longer; and I will go out back and take up one of  those twenty-thousand-acre leases in Queensland.  You might put Poss or Binjie on in my place. They would be glad of a billet,  and they might catch Red Mick for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really want to go?&rdquo; she said, looking straight at him for  the first time. &ldquo;Why do you want to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t bear being with you and near  you all day long, when I care for you, and you don&rsquo;t care for me. I can&rsquo;t eat,  or sleep, or rest here now, and it&rsquo;s time I was away. You might give me a good  character as a station-manager,&rdquo; he went on grimly, &ldquo;even though I can&rsquo;t catch  Red Mick for you. I&rsquo;ll get you to make out my cheque, and then I&rsquo;ll be off up  north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was looking down now. The sun had gone, and the stars were  peeping out, and in the dusk he could catch no glimpse of her face. There was  silence for a few moments, then he went on talking, half to himself. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s best  for me, anyhow. It&rsquo;s time I made a start for myself. I couldn&rsquo;t stay on here as  manager all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she spoke, very low and quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t care to stay on&mdash;for anything else, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean for anything else, Miss Grant? You don&rsquo;t want me  for anything except as manager, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t asked me yet whether I do or not!&rdquo;</p>
