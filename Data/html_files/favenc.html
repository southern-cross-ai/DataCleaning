Favenc</a></p>

<div align="left">
<p>Ernest Favenc was born in London in 1845 and educated at Berlin
&amp; Oxford.</p>

<p>He arrived in New South Wales in1863 and, after being in colony
for 1 year, in a commercial position, he afterwards worked in the
pastoral industry in the frontier squatting districts of
Queensland.</p>

<p>Favenc wrote under the pseudonym of &quot;Dramingo&quot; and was
an accomplished pencil sketcher. In 1878 he was selected to explore
the country along western border of Queensland to Darwin to see if
a railway could be constructed and in the early 1880s also
undertook expeditions in the country to the south of the Gulf of
Carpentaria and north-west of Western Australia.</p>

<p>He is chiefly remembered for his exploration but he also
published romances, children's stories and verse as well as several
books on exploration, the most extensive being The History of
Australian Exploration.</p>

<p>On the original launch of this book in 1888 the Daily Telegrapph
reported...</p>

<p>&quot;The History of Australian Exploration is an important one
and however diverse may have been the aims, ideas and successes of
those by whom the work was done,...Ernest Favenc's rather
formidable volume...gathers together all those scattered memorials
merging it into a unity of a great labour. Favenc was himself an
explorer and treats his subject not in a perfunctory way, but as
one who feels the wild charm and the magical attraction of the
unknown...&quot;</p>

<p>Favenc died in Sydney in 1908.</p>
