  <h2><a name="Caspak1-1"
     id="Caspak1-1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first"><i>IT must have been a little after three o'clock in the
  afternoon that it happened&mdash;the afternoon of June 3rd, 1916. It seems
  incredible that all that I have passed through&mdash;all those weird and
  terrifying experiences&mdash;should have been encompassed within so short a
  span as three brief months. Rather might I have experienced a cosmic cycle,
  with all its changes and evolutions for that which I have seen with my own
  eyes in this brief interval of time&mdash;things that no other mortal eye had
  seen before, glimpses of a world past, a world dead, a world so long dead
  that even in the lowest Cambrian stratum no trace of it remains. Fused with
  the melting inner crust, it has passed forever beyond the ken of man other
  than in that lost pocket of the earth whither fate has borne me and where my
  doom is sealed. I am here and here must remain.</i></p>

  <p><br>
  AFTER reading this far, my interest, which already had been stimulated by the
  finding of the manuscript, was approaching the boiling-point. I had come to
  Greenland for the summer, on the advice of my physician, and was slowly being
  bored to extinction, as I had thoughtlessly neglected to bring sufficient
  reading-matter. Being an indifferent fisherman, my enthusiasm for this form
  of sport soon waned; yet in the absence of other forms of recreation I was
  now risking my life in an entirely inadequate boat off Cape Farewell at the
  southernmost extremity of Greenland.</p>

  <p>Greenland! As a descriptive appellation, it is a sorry joke&mdash;but my
  story has nothing to do with Greenland, nothing to do with me; so I shall get
  through with the one and the other as rapidly as possible.</p>

  <p>The inadequate boat finally arrived at a precarious landing, the natives,
  waist-deep in the surf, assisting. I was carried ashore, and while the
  evening meal was being prepared, I wandered to and fro along the rocky,
  shattered shore. Bits of surf-harried beach clove the worn granite, or
  whatever the rocks of Cape Farewell may be composed of, and as I followed the
  ebbing tide down one of these soft stretches, I saw the thing. Were one to
  bump into a Bengal tiger in the ravine behind the Bimini Baths, one could be
  no more surprised than was I to see a perfectly good quart thermos bottle
  turning and twisting in the surf of Cape Farewell at the southern extremity
  of Greenland. I rescued it, but I was soaked above the knees doing it; and
  then I sat down in the sand and opened it, and in the long twilight read the
  manuscript, neatly written and tightly folded, which was its contents.</p>

  <p>You have read the opening paragraph, and if you are an imaginative idiot
  like myself, you will want to read the rest of it; so I shall give it to you
  here, omitting quotation marks&mdash;which are difficult of remembrance. In
  two minutes you will forget me.</p>

  <p><br>
  My home is in Santa Monica. I am, or was, junior member of my father's firm.
  We are ship-builders. Of recent years we have specialized on submarines,
  which we have built for Germany, England, France and the United States. I
  know a sub as a mother knows her baby's face, and have commanded a score of
  them on their trial runs. Yet my inclinations were all toward aviation. I
  graduated under Curtiss, and after a long siege with my father obtained his
  permission to try for the Lafayette Escadrille. As a stepping-stone I
  obtained an appointment in the American ambulance service and was on my way
  to France when three shrill whistles altered, in as many seconds, my entire
  scheme of life.</p>

  <p>I was sitting on deck with some of the fellows who were going into the
  American ambulance service with me, my Airedale, Crown Prince Nobbler, asleep
  at my feet, when the first blast of the whistle shattered the peace and
  security of the ship. Ever since entering the U-boat zone we had been on the
  lookout for periscopes, and children that we were, bemoaning the unkind fate
  that was to see us safely into France on the morrow without a glimpse of the
  dread marauders. We were young; we craved thrills, and God knows we got them
  that day; yet by comparison with that through which I have since passed they
  were as tame as a Punch-and-Judy show.</p>

  <p>I shall never forget the ashy faces of the passengers as they stampeded
  for their life-belts, though there was no panic. Nobs rose with a low growl.
  I rose, also, and over the ship's side, I saw not two hundred yards distant
  the periscope of a submarine, while racing toward the liner the wake of a
  torpedo was distinctly visible. We were aboard an American ship&mdash;which,
  of course, was not armed. We were entirely defenseless; yet without warning,
  we were being torpedoed.</p>

  <p>I stood rigid, spellbound, watching the white wake of the torpedo. It
  struck us on the starboard side almost amidships. The vessel rocked as though
  the sea beneath it had been uptorn by a mighty volcano. We were thrown to the
  decks, bruised and stunned, and then above the ship, carrying with it
  fragments of steel and wood and dismembered human bodies, rose a column of
  water hundreds of feet into the air.</p>

  <p>The silence which followed the detonation of the exploding torpedo was
  almost equally horrifying. It lasted for perhaps two seconds, to be followed
  by the screams and moans of the wounded, the cursing of the men and the
  hoarse commands of the ship's officers. They were splendid&mdash;they and
  their crew. Never before had I been so proud of my nationality as I was that
  moment. In all the chaos which followed the torpedoing of the liner no
  officer or member of the crew lost his head or showed in the slightest any
  degree of panic or fear.</p>

  <p>While we were attempting to lower boats, the submarine emerged and trained
  guns on us. The officer in command ordered us to lower our flag, but this the
  captain of the liner refused to do. The ship was listing frightfully to
  starboard, rendering the port boats useless, while half the starboard boats
  had been demolished by the explosion. Even while the passengers were crowding
  the starboard rail and scrambling into the few boats left to us, the
  submarine commenced shelling the ship. I saw one shell burst in a group of
  women and children, and then I turned my head and covered my eyes.</p>

  <p>When I looked again to horror was added chagrin, for with the emerging of
  the U-boat I had recognized her as a product of our own shipyard. I knew her
  to a rivet. I had superintended her construction. I had sat in that very
  conning-tower and directed the efforts of the sweating crew below when first
  her prow clove the sunny summer waters of the Pacific; and now this creature
  of my brain and hand had turned <i>Frankenstein</i>, bent upon pursuing me to
  my death.</p>

  <p>A second shell exploded upon the deck. One of the lifeboats, frightfully
  overcrowded, swung at a dangerous angle from its davits. A fragment of the
  shell shattered the bow tackle, and I saw the women and children and the men
  vomited into the sea beneath, while the boat dangled stern up for a moment
  from its single davit, and at last with increasing momentum dived into the
  midst of the struggling victims screaming upon the face of the waters.</p>

  <p>Now I saw men spring to the rail and leap into the ocean. The deck was
  tilting to an impossible angle. Nobs braced himself with all four feet to
  keep from slipping into the scuppers and looked up into my face with a
  questioning whine. I stooped and stroked his head.</p>

  <p>"Come on, boy!" I cried, and running to the side of the ship, dived
  headforemost over the rail. When I came up, the first thing I saw was Nobs
  swimming about in a bewildered sort of way a few yards from me. At sight of
  me his ears went flat, and his lips parted in a characteristic grin.</p>

  <p>The submarine was withdrawing toward the north, but all the time it was
  shelling the open boats, three of them, loaded to the gunwales with
  survivors. Fortunately the small boats presented a rather poor target, which,
  combined with the bad marksmanship of the Germans preserved their occupants
  from harm; and after a few minutes a blotch of smoke appeared upon the
  eastern horizon and the U-boat submerged and disappeared.</p>

  <p>All the time the lifeboats had been pulling away from the danger of the
  sinking liner, and now, though I yelled at the top of my lungs, they either
  did not hear my appeals for help or else did not dare return to succor me.
  Nobs and I had gained some little distance from the ship when it rolled
  completely over and sank. We were caught in the suction only enough to be
  drawn backward a few yards, neither of us being carried beneath the surface.
  I glanced hurriedly about for something to which to cling. My eyes were
  directed toward the point at which the liner had disappeared when there came
  from the depths of the ocean the muffled reverberation of an explosion, and
  almost simultaneously a geyser of water in which were shattered lifeboats,
  human bodies, steam, coal, oil, and the flotsam of a liner's deck leaped high
  above the surface of the sea&mdash;a watery column momentarily marking the
  grave of another ship in this greatest cemetery of the seas.</p>

  <p>When the turbulent waters had somewhat subsided and the sea had ceased to
  spew up wreckage, I ventured to swim back in search of something substantial
  enough to support my weight and that of Nobs as well. I had gotten well over
  the area of the wreck when not a half-dozen yards ahead of me a lifeboat shot
  bow foremost out of the ocean almost its entire length to flop down upon its
  keel with a mighty splash. It must have been carried far below, held to its
  mother ship by a single rope which finally parted to the enormous strain put
  upon it. In no other way can I account for its having leaped so far out of
  the water&mdash;a beneficent circumstance to which I doubtless owe my life,
  and that of another far dearer to me than my own. I say beneficent
  circumstance even in the face of the fact that a fate far more hideous
  confronts us than that which we escaped that day; for because of that
  circumstance I have met her whom otherwise I never should have known; I have
  met and loved her. At least I have had that great happiness in life; nor can
  Caspak, with all her horrors, expunge that which has been.</p>

  <p>So for the thousandth time I thank the strange fate which sent that
  lifeboat hurtling upward from the green pit of destruction to which it had
  been dragged&mdash;sent it far up above the surface, emptying its water as it
  rose above the waves, and dropping it upon the surface of the sea, buoyant
  and safe.</p>

  <p>It did not take me long to clamber over its side and drag Nobs in to
  comparative safety, and then I glanced around upon the scene of death and
  desolation which surrounded us. The sea was littered with wreckage among
  which floated the pitiful forms of women and children, buoyed up by their
  useless lifebelts. Some were torn and mangled; others lay rolling quietly to
  the motion of the sea, their countenances composed and peaceful; others were
  set in hideous lines of agony or horror. Close to the boat's side floated the
  figure of a girl. Her face was turned upward, held above the surface by her
  life-belt, and was framed in a floating mass of dark and waving hair. She was
  very beautiful. I had never looked upon such perfect features, such a divine
  molding which was at the same time human&mdash;intensely human. It was a face
  filled with character and strength and femininity&mdash;the face of one who
  was created to love and to be loved. The cheeks were flushed to the hue of
  life and health and vitality, and yet she lay there upon the bosom of the
  sea, dead. I felt something rise in my throat as I looked down upon that
  radiant vision, and I swore that I should live to avenge her murder.</p>

  <p>And then I let my eyes drop once more to the face upon the water, and what
  I saw nearly tumbled me backward into the sea, for the eyes in the dead face
  had opened; the lips had parted; and one hand was raised toward me in a mute
  appeal for succor. She lived! She was not dead! I leaned over the boat's side
  and drew her quickly in to the comparative safety which God had given me. I
  removed her life-belt and my soggy coat and made a pillow for her head. I
  chafed her hands and arms and feet. I worked over her for an hour, and at
  last I was rewarded by a deep sigh, and again those great eyes opened and
  looked into mine.</p>

  <p>At that I was all embarrassment. I have never been a ladies' man; at
  Leland-Stanford I was the butt of the class because of my hopeless imbecility
  in the presence of a pretty girl; but the men liked me, nevertheless. I was
  rubbing one of her hands when she opened her eyes, and I dropped it as though
  it were a red-hot rivet. Those eyes took me in slowly from head to foot; then
  they wandered slowly around the horizon marked by the rising and falling
  gunwales of the lifeboat. They looked at Nobs and softened, and then came
  back to me filled with questioning.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;" I stammered, moving away and stumbling over the next
  thwart. The vision smiled wanly.</p>

  <p>"Aye-aye, sir!" she replied faintly, and again her lids drooped, and her
  long lashes swept the firm, fair texture of her skin.</p>

  <p>"I hope that you are feeling better," I finally managed to say.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," she said after a moment of silence, "I have been awake for
  a long time! But I did not dare open my eyes. I thought I must be dead, and I
  was afraid to look, for fear that I should see nothing but blackness about
  me. I am afraid to die! Tell me what happened after the ship went down. I
  remember all that happened before&mdash;oh, but I wish that I might forget
  it!" A sob broke her voice. "The beasts!" she went on after a moment. "And to
  think that I was to have married one of them&mdash;a lieutenant in the German
  navy."</p>

  <p>Presently she resumed as though she had not ceased speaking. "I went down
  and down and down. I thought I should never cease to sink. I felt no
  particular distress until I suddenly started upward at ever-increasing
  velocity; then my lungs seemed about to burst, and I must have lost
  consciousness, for I remember nothing more until I opened my eyes after
  listening to a torrent of invective against Germany and Germans. Tell me,
  please, all that happened after the ship sank."</p>

  <p>I told her, then, as well as I could, all that I had seen&mdash;the
  submarine shelling the open boats and all the rest of it. She thought it
  marvelous that we should have been spared in so providential a manner, and I
  had a pretty speech upon my tongue's end, but lacked the nerve to deliver it.
  Nobs had come over and nosed his muzzle into her lap, and she stroked his
  ugly face, and at last she leaned over and put her cheek against his
  forehead. I have always admired Nobs; but this was the first time that it had
  ever occurred to me that I might wish to be Nobs. I wondered how he would
  take it, for he is as unused to women as I. But he took to it as a duck takes
  to water. What I lack of being a ladies' man, Nobs certainly makes up for as
  a ladies' dog. The old scalawag just closed his eyes and put on one of the
  softest "sugar-wouldn't-melt-in-my-mouth" expressions you ever saw and stood
  there taking it and asking for more. It made me jealous.</p>

  <p>"You seem fond of dogs," I said.</p>

  <p>"I am fond of this dog," she replied.</p>

  <p>Whether she meant anything personal in that reply I did not know; but I
  took it as personal and it made me feel mighty good.</p>

  <p>As we drifted about upon that vast expanse of loneliness it is not strange
  that we should quickly become well acquainted. Constantly we scanned the
  horizon for signs of smoke, venturing guesses as to our chances of rescue;
  but darkness settled, and the black night enveloped us without ever the sight
  of a speck upon the waters.</p>

  <p>We were thirsty, hungry, uncomfortable, and cold. Our wet garments had
  dried but little and I knew that the girl must be in grave danger from the
  exposure to a night of cold and wet upon the water in an open boat, without
  sufficient clothing and no food. I had managed to bail all the water out of
  the boat with cupped hands, ending by mopping the balance up with my
  handkerchief&mdash;a slow and back-breaking procedure; thus I had made a
  comparatively dry place for the girl to lie down low in the bottom of the
  boat, where the sides would protect her from the night wind, and when at last
  she did so, almost overcome as she was by weakness and fatigue, I threw my
  wet coat over her further to thwart the chill. But it was of no avail; as I
  sat watching her, the moonlight marking out the graceful curves of her
  slender young body, I saw her shiver.</p>

  <p>"Isn't there something I can do?" I asked. "You can't lie there chilled
  through all night. Can't you suggest something?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "We must grin and bear it," she replied after a
  moment.</p>

  <p>Nobbler came and lay down on the thwart beside me, his back against my
  leg, and I sat staring in dumb misery at the girl, knowing in my heart of
  hearts that she might die before morning came, for what with the shock and
  exposure, she had already gone through enough to kill almost any woman. And
  as I gazed down at her, so small and delicate and helpless, there was born
  slowly within my breast a new emotion. It had never been there before; now it
  will never cease to be there. It made me almost frantic in my desire to find
  some way to keep warm the cooling lifeblood in her veins. I was cold myself,
  though I had almost forgotten it until Nobbler moved and I felt a new
  sensation of cold along my leg against which he had lain, and suddenly
  realized that in that one spot I had been warm. Like a great light came the
  understanding of a means to warm the girl. Immediately I knelt beside her to
  put my scheme into practice when suddenly I was overwhelmed with
  embarrassment. Would she permit it, even if I could muster the courage to
  suggest it? Then I saw her frame convulse, shudderingly, her muscles reacting
  to her rapidly lowering temperature, and casting prudery to the winds, I
  threw myself down beside her and took her in my arms, pressing her body close
  to mine.</p>

  <p>She drew away suddenly, voicing a little cry of fright, and tried to push
  me from her.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," I managed to stammer. "It is the only way. You will die of
  exposure if you are not warmed, and Nobs and I are the only means we can
  command for furnishing warmth." And I held her tightly while I called Nobs
  and bade him lie down at her back. The girl didn't struggle any more when she
  learned my purpose; but she gave two or three little gasps, and then began to
  cry softly, burying her face on my arm, and thus she fell asleep.</p>

  <h2><a name="Caspak1-2"
     id="Caspak1-2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TOWARD morning, I must have dozed, though it seemed to me at
  the time that I had lain awake for days, instead of hours. When I finally
  opened my eyes, it was daylight, and the girl's hair was in my face, and she
  was breathing normally. I thanked God for that. She had turned her head
  during the night so that as I opened my eyes I saw her face not an inch from
  mine, my lips almost touching hers.</p>

  <p>It was Nobs who finally awoke her. He got up, stretched, turned around a
  few times and lay down again, and the girl opened her eyes and looked into
  mine. Hers went very wide at first, and then slowly comprehension came to
  her, and she smiled.</p>

  <p>"You have been very good to me," she said, as I helped her to rise, though
  if the truth were known I was more in need of assistance than she; the
  circulation all along my left side seeming to be paralyzed entirely. "You
  have been very good to me." And that was the only mention she ever made of
  it; yet I know that she was thankful and that only reserve prevented her from
  referring to what, to say the least, was an embarrassing situation, however
  unavoidable.</p>

  <p>Shortly after daylight we saw smoke apparently coming straight toward us,
  and after a time we made out the squat lines of a tug&mdash;one of those
  fearless exponents of England's supremacy of the sea that tows sailing ships
  into French and English ports. I stood up on a thwart and waved my soggy coat
  above my head. Nobs stood upon another and barked. The girl sat at my feet
  straining her eyes toward the deck of the oncoming boat. "They see us," she
  said at last. "There is a man answering your signal." She was right. A lump
  came into my throat&mdash;for her sake rather than for mine. She was saved,
  and none too soon. She could not have lived through another night upon the
  Channel; she might not have lived through the coming day.</p>

  <p>The tug came close beside us, and a man on deck threw us a rope. Willing
  hands dragged us to the deck, Nobs scrambling nimbly aboard without
  assistance. The rough men were gentle as mothers with the girl. Plying us
  both with questions they hustled her to the captain's cabin and me to the
  boiler-room. They told the girl to take off her wet clothes and throw them
  outside the door that they might be dried, and then to slip into the
  captain's bunk and get warm. They didn't have to tell me to strip after I
  once got into the warmth of the boiler-room. In a jiffy, my clothes hung
  about where they might dry most quickly, and I myself was absorbing, through
  every pore, the welcome heat of the stifling compartment. They brought us hot
  soup and coffee, and then those who were not on duty sat around and helped me
  damn the Kaiser and his brood.</p>

  <p>As soon as our clothes were dry, they bade us don them, as the chances
  were always more than fair in those waters that we should run into trouble
  with the enemy, as I was only too well aware. What with the warmth and the
  feeling of safety for the girl, and the knowledge that a little rest and food
  would quickly overcome the effects of her experiences of the past dismal
  hours, I was feeling more content than I had experienced since those three
  whistle-blasts had shattered the peace of my world the previous
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>But peace upon the Channel has been but a transitory thing since August,
  1914. It proved itself such that morning, for I had scarce gotten into my dry
  clothes and taken the girl's apparel to the captain's cabin when an order was
  shouted down into the engine-room for full speed ahead, and an instant later
  I heard the dull boom of a gun. In a moment I was up on deck to see an enemy
  submarine about two hundred yards off our port bow. She had signaled us to
  stop, and our skipper had ignored the order; but now she had her gun trained
  on us, and the second shot grazed the cabin, warning the belligerent
  tug-captain that it was time to obey. Once again an order went down to the
  engine-room, and the tug reduced speed. The U-boat ceased firing and ordered
  the tug to come about and approach. Our momentum had carried us a little
  beyond the enemy craft, but we were turning now on the arc of a circle that
  would bring us alongside her. As I stood watching the maneuver and wondering
  what was to become of us, I felt something touch my elbow and turned to see
  the girl standing at my side. She looked up into my face with a rueful
  expression. "They seem bent on our destruction," she said, "and it looks like
  the same boat that sunk us yesterday."</p>

  <p>"It is," I replied. "I know her well. I helped design her and took her out
  on her first run."</p>

  <p>The girl drew back from me with a little exclamation of surprise and
  disappointment. "I thought you were an American," she said. "I had no idea
  you were a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nor am I," I replied. "Americans have been building submarines for all
  nations for many years. I wish, though, that we had gone bankrupt, my father
  and I, before ever we turned out that <i>Frankenstein</i> of a thing."</p>

  <p>We were approaching the U-boat at half speed now, and I could almost
  distinguish the features of the men upon her deck. A sailor stepped to my
  side and slipped something hard and cold into my hand. I did not have to look
  at it to know that it was a heavy pistol. "Tyke 'er an' use 'er," was all he
  said.</p>

  <p>Our bow was pointed straight toward the U-boat now as I heard word passed
  to the engine for full speed ahead. I instantly grasped the brazen effrontery
  of the plucky English skipper&mdash;he was going to ram five hundreds tons of
  U-boat in the face of her trained gun. I could scarce repress a cheer. At
  first the Boches didn't seem to grasp his intention. Evidently they thought
  they were witnessing an exhibition of poor seamanship, and they yelled their
  warnings to the tug to reduce speed and throw the helm hard to port.</p>

  <p>We were within fifty feet of them when they awakened to the intentional
  menace of our maneuver. Their gun crew was off its guard; but they sprang to
  their piece now and sent a futile shell above our heads. Nobs leaped about
  and barked furiously. "Let 'em have it!" commanded the tug-captain, and
  instantly revolvers and rifles poured bullets upon the deck of the
  submersible. Two of the gun-crew went down; the other trained their piece at
  the water-line of the oncoming tug. The balance of those on deck replied to
  our small-arms fire, directing their efforts toward the man at our wheel.</p>

  <p>I hastily pushed the girl down the companionway leading to the
  engine-room, and then I raised my pistol and fired my first shot at a Boche.
  What happened in the next few seconds happened so quickly that details are
  rather blurred in my memory. I saw the helmsman lunge forward upon the wheel,
  pulling the helm around so that the tug sheered off quickly from her course,
  and I recall realizing that all our efforts were to be in vain, because of
  all the men aboard, Fate had decreed that this one should fall first to an
  enemy bullet. I saw the depleted gun-crew on the submarine fire their piece
  and I felt the shock of impact and heard the loud explosion as the shell
  struck and exploded in our bows.</p>

  <p>I saw and realized these things even as I was leaping into the pilot-house
  and grasping the wheel, standing astride the dead body of the helmsman. With
  all my strength I threw the helm to starboard; but it was too late to effect
  the purpose of our skipper. The best I did was to scrape alongside the sub. I
  heard someone shriek an order into the engine-room; the boat shuddered and
  trembled to the sudden reversing of the engines, and our speed quickly
  lessened. Then I saw what that madman of a skipper planned since his first
  scheme had gone wrong.</p>

  <p>With a loud-yelled command, he leaped to the slippery deck of the
  submersible, and at his heels came his hardy crew. I sprang from the
  pilot-house and followed, not to be left out in the cold when it came to
  strafing the Boches. From the engine room companionway came the engineer and
  stockers, and together we leaped after the balance of the crew and into the
  hand-to-hand fight that was covering the wet deck with red blood. Beside me
  came Nobs, silent now, and grim. Germans were emerging from the open hatch to
  take part in the battle on deck. At first the pistols cracked amidst the
  cursing of the men and the loud commands of the commander and his junior; but
  presently we were too indiscriminately mixed to make it safe to use our
  firearms, and the battle resolved itself into a hand-to-hand struggle for
  possession of the deck.</p>

  <p>The sole aim of each of us was to hurl one of the opposing force into the
  sea. I shall never forget the hideous expression upon the face of the great
  Prussian with whom chance confronted me. He lowered his head and rushed at
  me, bellowing like a bull. With a quick side-step and ducking low beneath his
  outstretched arms, I eluded him; and as he turned to come back at me, I
  landed a blow upon his chin which sent him spinning toward the edge of the
  deck. I saw his wild endeavors to regain his equilibrium; I saw him reel
  drunkenly for an instant upon the brink of eternity and then, with a loud
  scream, slip into the sea. At the same instant a pair of giant arms encircled
  me from behind and lifted me entirely off my feet. Kick and squirm as I
  would, I could neither turn toward my antagonist nor free myself from his
  maniacal grasp. Relentlessly he was rushing me toward the side of the vessel
  and death. There was none to stay him, for each of my companions was more
  than occupied by from one to three of the enemy. For an instant I was fearful
  for myself, and then I saw that which filled me with a far greater terror for
  another.</p>

  <p>My Boche was bearing me toward the side of the submarine against which the
  tug was still pounding. That I should be ground to death between the two was
  lost upon me as I saw the girl standing alone upon the tug's deck, as I saw
  the stern high in air and the bow rapidly settling for the final dive, as I
  saw death from which I could not save her clutching at the skirts of the
  woman I now knew all too well that I loved.</p>

  <p>I had perhaps the fraction of a second longer to live when I heard an
  angry growl behind us mingle with a cry of pain and rage from the giant who
  carried me. Instantly he went backward to the deck, and as he did so he threw
  his arms outwards to save himself, freeing me. I fell heavily upon him, but
  was upon my feet in the instant. As I arose, I cast a single glance at my
  opponent. Never again would he menace me or another, for Nob's great jaws had
  closed upon his throat. Then I sprang toward the edge of the deck closest to
  the girl upon the sinking tug.</p>

  <p>"Jump!" I cried. "Jump!" And I held out my arms to her. Instantly as
  though with implicit confidence in my ability to save her, she leaped over
  the side of the tug onto the sloping, slippery side of the U-boat. I reached
  far over to seize her hand. At the same instant the tug pointed its stern
  straight toward the sky and plunged out of sight. My hand missed the girl's
  by a fraction of an inch, and I saw her slip into the sea; but scarce had she
  touched the water when I was in after her.</p>

  <p>The sinking tug drew us far below the surface; but I had seized her the
  moment I struck the water, and so we went down together, and together we came
  up&mdash;a few yards from the U-boat. The first thing I heard was Nobs
  barking furiously; evidently he had missed me and was searching. A single
  glance at the vessel's deck assured me that the battle was over and that we
  had been victorious, for I saw our survivors holding a handful of the enemy
  at pistol points while one by one the rest of the crew was coming out of the
  craft's interior and lining up on deck with the other prisoners.</p>

  <p>As I swam toward the submarine with the girl, Nobs' persistent barking
  attracted the attention of some of the tug's crew, so that as soon as we
  reached the side there were hands to help us aboard. I asked the girl if she
  was hurt, but she assured me that she was none the worse for this second
  wetting; nor did she seem to suffer any from shock. I was to learn for myself
  that this slender and seemingly delicate creature possessed the heart and
  courage of a warrior.</p>

  <p>As we joined our own party, I found the tug's mate checking up our
  survivors. There were ten of us left, not including the girl. Our brave
  skipper was missing, as were eight others. There had been nineteen of us in
  the attacking party and we had accounted in one way and another during the
  battle for sixteen Germans and had taken nine prisoners, including the
  commander. His lieutenant had been killed.</p>

  <p>"Not a bad day's work," said Bradley, the mate, when he had completed his
  roll. "Only losing the skipper," he added, "was the worst. He was a fine man,
  a fine man."</p>

  <p>Olson&mdash;who in spite of his name was Irish, and in spite of his not
  being Scotch had been the tug's engineer&mdash;was standing with Bradley and
  me. "Yis," he agreed, "it's a day's wor-rk we're after doin', but what are we
  goin' to be doin' wid it now we got it?"</p>

  <p>"We'll run her into the nearest English port," said Bradley, "and then
  we'll all go ashore and get our V. C.'s," he concluded, laughing.</p>

  <p>"How you goin' to run her?" queried Olson. "You can't trust these
  Dutchmen."</p>

  <p>Bradley scratched his head. "I guess you're right," he admitted. "And I
  don't know the first thing about a sub."</p>

  <p>"I do," I assured him. "I know more about this particular sub than the
  officer who commanded her."</p>

  <p>Both men looked at me in astonishment, and then I had to explain all over
  again as I had explained to the girl. Bradley and Olson were delighted.
  Immediately I was put in command, and the first thing I did was to go below
  with Olson and inspect the craft thoroughly for hidden Boches and damaged
  machinery. There were no Germans below, and everything was intact and in
  ship-shape working order. I then ordered all hands below except one man who
  was to act as lookout. Questioning the Germans, I found that all except the
  commander were willing to resume their posts and aid in bringing the vessel
  into an English port. I believe that they were relieved at the prospect of
  being detained at a comfortable English prison-camp for the duration of the
  war after the perils and privations through which they had passed. The
  officer, however, assured me that he would never be a party to the capture of
  his vessel.</p>

  <p>There was, therefore, nothing to do but put the man in irons. As we were
  preparing to put this decision into force, the girl descended from the deck.
  It was the first time that she or the German officer had seen each other's
  faces since we had boarded the U-boat. I was assisting the girl down the
  ladder and still retained a hold upon her arm&mdash;possibly after such
  support was no longer necessary&mdash;when she turned and looked squarely
  into the face of the German. Each voiced a sudden exclamation of surprise and
  dismay.</p>

  <p>"Lys!" he cried, and took a step toward her.</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes went wide, and slowly filled with a great horror, as she
  shrank back. Then her slender figure stiffened to the erectness of a soldier,
  and with chin in air and without a word she turned her back upon the
  officer.</p>

  <p>"Take him away," I directed the two men who guarded him, "and put him in
  irons."</p>

  <p>When he had gone, the girl raised her eyes to mine. "He is the German of
  whom I spoke," she said. "He is Baron von Schoenvorts."</p>

  <p>I merely inclined my head. She had loved him! I wondered if in her heart
  of hearts she did not love him yet. Immediately I became insanely jealous. I
  hated Baron Friedrich von Schoenvorts with such utter intensity that the
  emotion thrilled me with a species of exaltation.</p>

  <p>But I didn't have much chance to enjoy my hatred then, for almost
  immediately the lookout poked his face over the hatchway and bawled down that
  there was smoke on the horizon, dead ahead. Immediately I went on deck to
  investigate, and Bradley came with me.</p>

  <p>"If she's friendly," he said, "we'll speak her. If she's not, we'll sink
  her&mdash;eh, captain?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, lieutenant," I replied, and it was his turn to smile.</p>

  <p>We hoisted the Union Jack and remained on deck, asking Bradley to go below
  and assign to each member of the crew his duty, placing one Englishman with a
  pistol beside each German.</p>

  <p>"Half speed ahead," I commanded.</p>

  <p>More rapidly now we closed the distance between ourselves and the
  stranger, until I could plainly see the red ensign of the British merchant
  marine. My heart swelled with pride at the thought that presently admiring
  British tars would be congratulating us upon our notable capture; and just
  about then the merchant steamer must have sighted us, for she veered suddenly
  toward the north, and a moment later dense volumes of smoke issued from her
  funnels. Then, steering a zigzag course, she fled from us as though we had
  been the bubonic plague. I altered the course of the submarine and set off in
  chase; but the steamer was faster than we, and soon left us hopelessly
  astern.</p>

  <p>With a rueful smile, I directed that our original course be resumed, and
  once again we set off toward merry England. That was three months ago, and we
  haven't arrived yet; nor is there any likelihood that we ever shall. The
  steamer we had just sighted must have wirelessed a warning, for it wasn't
  half an hour before we saw more smoke on the horizon, and this time the
  vessel flew the white ensign of the Royal Navy and carried guns. She didn't
  veer to the north or anywhere else, but bore down on us rapidly. I was just
  preparing to signal her, when a flame flashed from her bows, and an instant
  later the water in front of us was thrown high by the explosion of a
  shell.</p>

  <p>Bradley had come on deck and was standing beside me. "About one more of
  those, and she'll have our range," he said. "She doesn't seem to take much
  stock in our Union Jack."</p>

  <p>A second shell passed over us, and then I gave the command to change our
  direction, at the same time directing Bradley to go below and give the order
  to submerge. I passed Nobs down to him, and following, saw to the closing and
  fastening of the hatch.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that the diving-tanks never had filled so slowly. We heard
  a loud explosion apparently directly above us; the craft trembled to the
  shock which threw us all to the deck. I expected momentarily to feel the
  deluge of inrushing water, but none came. Instead we continued to submerge
  until the manometer registered forty feet and then I knew that we were safe.
  Safe! I almost smiled. I had relieved Olson, who had remained in the tower at
  my direction, having been a member of one of the early British submarine
  crews, and therefore having some knowledge of the business. Bradley was at my
  side. He looked at me quizzically.</p>

  <p>"What the devil are we to do?" he asked. "The merchantman will flee us;
  the war-vessel will destroy us; neither will believe our colors or give us a
  chance to explain. We will meet even a worse reception if we go nosing around
  a British port&mdash;mines, nets and all of it. We can't do it."</p>

  <p>"Let's try it again when this fellow has lost the scent," I urged. "There
  must come a ship that will believe us."</p>

  <p>And try it again we did, only to be almost rammed by a huge freighter.
  Later we were fired upon by a destroyer, and two merchantmen turned and fled
  at our approach. For two days we cruised up and down the Channel trying to
  tell some one, who would listen, that we were friends; but no one would
  listen. After our encounter with the first warship I had given instructions
  that a wireless message be sent out explaining our predicament; but to my
  chagrin I discovered that both sending and receiving instruments had
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"There is only one place you can go," von Schoenvorts sent word to me,
  "and that is Kiel. You can't land anywhere else in these waters. If you wish,
  I will take you there, and I can promise that you will be treated well."</p>

  <p>"There is another place we can go," I sent back my reply, "and we will
  before we'll go to Germany. That place is hell."</p>

  <h2><a name="Caspak1-3"
     id="Caspak1-3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THOSE were anxious days, during which I had but little
  opportunity to associate with Lys. I had given her the commander's room,
  Bradley and I taking that of the deck-officer, while Olson and two of our
  best men occupied the room ordinarily allotted to petty officers. I made
  Nobs' bed down in Lys' room, for I knew she would feel less alone.</p>

  <p>Nothing of much moment occurred for a while after we left British waters
  behind us. We ran steadily along upon the surface, making good time. The
  first two boats we sighted made off as fast as they could go; and the third,
  a huge freighter, fired on us, forcing us to submerge. It was after this that
  our troubles commenced. One of the Diesel engines broke down in the morning,
  and while we were working on it, the forward port diving-tank commenced to
  fill. I was on deck at the time and noted the gradual list. Guessing at once
  what was happening, I leaped for the hatch and slamming it closed above my
  head, dropped to the centrale. By this time the craft was going down by the
  head with a most unpleasant list to port, and I didn't wait to transmit
  orders to some one else but ran as fast as I could for the valve that let the
  sea into the forward port diving-tank. It was wide open. To close it and to
  have the pump started that would empty it were the work of but a minute; but
  we had had a close call.</p>

  <p>I knew that the valve had never opened itself. Some one had opened
  it&mdash;some one who was willing to die himself if he might at the same time
  encompass the death of all of us.</p>

  <p>After that I kept a guard pacing the length of the narrow craft. We worked
  upon the engine all that day and night and half the following day. Most of
  the time we drifted idly upon the surface, but toward noon we sighted smoke
  due west, and having found that only enemies inhabited the world for us, I
  ordered that the other engine be started so that we could move out of the
  path of the oncoming steamer. The moment the engine started to turn, however,
  there was a grinding sound of tortured steel, and when it had been stopped,
  we found that some one had placed a cold-chisel in one of the gears.</p>

  <p>It was another two days before we were ready to limp along, half repaired.
  The night before the repairs were completed, the sentry came to my room and
  awoke me. He was rather an intelligent fellow of the English middle class, in
  whom I had much confidence.</p>

  <p>"Well, Wilson," I asked. "What's the matter now?"</p>

  <p>He raised his finger to his lips and came closer to me. "I think I've
  found out who's doin' the mischief," he whispered, and nodded his head toward
  the girl's room. "I seen her sneakin' from the crew's room just now," he went
  on. "She'd been in gassin' wit' the Boche commander. Benson seen her in there
  las' night, too, but he never said nothin' till I goes on watch tonight.
  Benson's sorter slow in the head, an' he never puts two an' two together till
  some one else has made four out of it."</p>

  <p>If the man had come in and struck me suddenly in the face, I could have
  been no more surprised.</p>

  <p>"Say nothing of this to anyone," I ordered. "Keep your eyes and ears open
  and report every suspicious thing you see or hear."</p>

  <p>The man saluted and left me; but for an hour or more I tossed, restless,
  upon my hard bunk in an agony of jealousy and fear. Finally I fell into a
  troubled sleep. It was daylight when I awoke. We were steaming along slowly
  upon the surface, my orders having been to proceed at half speed until we
  could take an observation and determine our position. The sky had been
  overcast all the previous day and all night; but as I stepped into the
  centrale that morning I was delighted to see that the sun was again shining.
  The spirits of the men seemed improved; everything seemed propitious. I
  forgot at once the cruel misgivings of the past night as I set to work to
  take my observations.</p>

  <p>What a blow awaited me! The sextant and chronometer had both been broken
  beyond repair, and they had been broken just this very night. They had been
  broken upon the night that Lys had been seen talking with von Schoenvorts. I
  think that it was this last thought which hurt me the worst. I could look the
  other disaster in the face with equanimity; but the bald fact that Lys might
  be a traitor appalled me.</p>

  <p>I called Bradley and Olson on deck and told them what had happened, but
  for the life of me I couldn't bring myself to repeat what Wilson had reported
  to me the previous night. In fact, as I had given the matter thought, it
  seemed incredible that the girl could have passed through my room, in which
  Bradley and I slept, and then carried on a conversation in the crew's room,
  in which Von Schoenvorts was kept, without having been seen by more than a
  single man.</p>

  <p>Bradley shook his head. "I can't make it out," he said. "One of those
  Boches must be pretty clever to come it over us all like this; but they
  haven't harmed us as much as they think; there are still the extra
  instruments."</p>

  <p>It was my turn now to shake a doleful head. "There are no extra
  instruments," I told them. "They too have disappeared as did the wireless
  apparatus."</p>

  <p>Both men looked at me in amazement. "We still have the compass and the
  sun," said Olson. "They may be after getting the compass some night; but
  they's too many of us around in the daytime fer 'em to get the sun."</p>

  <p>It was then that one of the men stuck his head up through the hatchway and
  seeing me, asked permission to come on deck and get a breath of fresh air. I
  recognized him as Benson, the man who, Wilson had said, reported having seen
  Lys with von Schoenvorts two nights before. I motioned him on deck and then
  called him to one side, asking if he had seen anything out of the way or
  unusual during his trick on watch the night before. The fellow scratched his
  head a moment and said, "No," and then as though it was an afterthought, he
  told me that he had seen the girl in the crew's room about midnight talking
  with the German commander, but as there hadn't seemed to him to be any harm
  in that, he hadn't said anything about it. Telling him never to fail to
  report to me anything in the slightest out of the ordinary routine of the
  ship, I dismissed him.</p>

  <p>Several of the other men now asked permission to come on deck, and soon
  all but those actually engaged in some necessary duty were standing around
  smoking and talking, all in the best of spirits. I took advantage of the
  absence of the men upon the deck to go below for my breakfast, which the cook
  was already preparing upon the electric stove. Lys, followed by Nobs,
  appeared as I entered the centrale. She met me with a pleasant "Good
  morning!" which I am afraid I replied to in a tone that was rather
  constrained and surly.</p>

  <p>"Will you breakfast with me?" I suddenly asked the girl, determined to
  commence a probe of my own along the lines which duty demanded.</p>

  <p>She nodded a sweet acceptance of my invitation, and together we sat down
  at the little table of the officers' mess. "You slept well last night?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"All night," she replied. "I am a splendid sleeper."</p>

  <p>Her manner was so straightforward and honest that I could not bring myself
  to believe in her duplicity; yet&mdash;Thinking to surprise her into a
  betrayal of her guilt, I blurted out: "The chronometer and sextant were both
  destroyed last night; there is a traitor among us." But she never turned a
  hair by way of evidencing guilty knowledge of the catastrophe.</p>

  <p>"Who could it have been?" she cried. "The Germans would be crazy to do it,
  for their lives are as much at stake as ours."</p>

  <p>"Men are often glad to die for an ideal&mdash;an ideal of patriotism,
  perhaps," I replied; "and a willingness to martyr themselves includes a
  willingness to sacrifice others, even those who love them. Women are much the
  same, except that they will go even further than most men&mdash;they will
  sacrifice everything, even honor, for love."</p>

  <p>I watched her face carefully as I spoke, and I thought that I detected a
  very faint flush mounting her cheek. Seeing an opening and an advantage, I
  sought to follow it up.</p>

  <p>"Take von Schoenvorts, for instance," I continued: "he would doubtless be
  glad to die and take us all with him, could he prevent in no other way the
  falling of his vessel into enemy hands. He would sacrifice anyone, even you;
  and if you still love him, you might be his ready tool. Do you understand
  me?"</p>

  <p>She looked at me in wide-eyed consternation for a moment, and then she
  went very white and rose from her seat. "I do," she replied, and turning her
  back upon me, she walked quickly toward her room. I started to follow, for
  even believing what I did, I was sorry that I had hurt her. I reached the
  door to the crew's room just behind her and in time to see von Schoenvorts
  lean forward and whisper something to her as she passed; but she must have
  guessed that she might be watched, for she passed on.</p>

  <p>That afternoon it clouded over; the wind mounted to a gale, and the sea
  rose until the craft was wallowing and rolling frightfully. Nearly everyone
  aboard was sick; the air became foul and oppressive. For twenty-four hours I
  did not leave my post in the conning tower, as both Olson and Bradley were
  sick. Finally I found that I must get a little rest, and so I looked about
  for some one to relieve me. Benson volunteered. He had not been sick, and
  assured me that he was a former R.N. man and had been detailed for submarine
  duty for over two years. I was glad that it was he, for I had considerable
  confidence in his loyalty, and so it was with a feeling of security that I
  went below and lay down.</p>

  <p>I slept twelve hours straight, and when I awoke and discovered what I had
  done, I lost no time in getting to the conning tower. There sat Benson as
  wide awake as could be, and the compass showed that we were heading straight
  into the west. The storm was still raging; nor did it abate its fury until
  the fourth day. We were all pretty well done up and looked forward to the
  time when we could go on deck and fill our lungs with fresh air. During the
  whole four days I had not seen the girl, as she evidently kept closely to her
  room; and during this time no untoward incident had occurred aboard the boat
  &mdash;a fact which seemed to strengthen the web of circumstantial evidence
  about her.</p>

  <p>For six more days after the storm lessened we still had fairly rough
  weather; nor did the sun once show himself during all that time. For the
  season&mdash;it was now the middle of June&mdash;the storm was unusual; but
  being from southern California, I was accustomed to unusual weather. In fact,
  I have discovered that the world over, unusual weather prevails at all times
  of the year.</p>

  <p>We kept steadily to our westward course, and as the <i>U-33</i> was one of
  the fastest submersibles we had ever turned out, I knew that we must be
  pretty close to the North American coast. What puzzled me most was the fact
  that for six days we had not sighted a single ship. It seemed remarkable that
  we could cross the Atlantic almost to the coast of the American continent
  without glimpsing smoke or sail, and at last I came to the conclusion that we
  were way off our course, but whether to the north or to the south of it I
  could not determine.</p>

  <p>On the seventh day the sea lay comparatively calm at early dawn. There was
  a slight haze upon the ocean which had cut off our view of the stars; but
  conditions all pointed toward a clear morrow, and I was on deck anxiously
  awaiting the rising of the sun. My eyes were glued upon the impenetrable mist
  astern, for there in the east I should see the first glow of the rising sun
  that would assure me we were still upon the right course. Gradually the
  heavens lightened; but astern I could see no intenser glow that would
  indicate the rising sun behind the mist. Bradley was standing at my side.
  Presently he touched my arm.</p>

  <p>"Look, captain," he said, and pointed south.</p>

  <p>I looked and gasped, for there directly to port I saw outlined through the
  haze the red top of the rising sun. Hurrying to the tower, I looked at the
  compass. It showed that we were holding steadily upon our westward course.
  Either the sun was rising in the south, or the compass had been tampered
  with. The conclusion was obvious.</p>

  <p>I went back to Bradley and told him what I had discovered. "And," I
  concluded, "we can't make another five hundred knots without oil; our
  provisions are running low and so is our water. God only knows how far south
  we have run."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to do," he replied, "other than to alter our course once
  more toward the west; we must raise land soon or we shall all be lost."</p>

  <p>I told him to do so; and then I set to work improvising a crude sextant
  with which we finally took our bearings in a rough and most unsatisfactory
  manner; for when the work was done, we did not know how far from the truth
  the result might be. It showed us to be about 20' north and 30' west&mdash;
  nearly twenty-five hundred miles off our course. In short, if our reading was
  anywhere near correct, we must have been traveling due south for six days.
  Bradley now relieved Benson, for we had arranged our shifts so that the
  latter and Olson now divided the nights, while Bradley and I alternated with
  one another during the days.</p>

  <p>I questioned both Olson and Benson closely in the matter of the compass;
  but each stoutly maintained that no one had tampered with it during his tour
  of duty. Benson gave me a knowing smile, as much as to say: "Well, you and I
  know who did this." Yet I could not believe that it was the girl.</p>

  <p>We kept to our westerly course for several hours when the lookout's cry
  announced a sail. I ordered the <i>U-33</i>'s course altered, and we bore
  down upon the stranger, for I had come to a decision which was the result of
  necessity. We could not lie there in the middle of the Atlantic and starve to
  death if there was any way out of it. The sailing ship saw us while we were
  still a long way off, as was evidenced by her efforts to escape. There was
  scarcely any wind, however, and her case was hopeless; so when we drew near
  and signaled her to stop, she came into the wind and lay there with her sails
  flapping idly. We moved in quite close to her. She was the <i>Balmen</i> of
  Halmstad, Sweden, with a general cargo from Brazil for Spain.</p>

  <p>I explained our circumstances to her skipper and asked for food, water and
  oil; but when he found that we were not German, he became very angry and
  abusive and started to draw away from us; but I was in no mood for any such
  business. Turning toward Bradley, who was in the conning-tower, I snapped
  out: "Gun-service on deck! To the diving stations!" We had no opportunity for
  drill; but every man had been posted as to his duties, and the German members
  of the crew understood that it was obedience or death for them, as each was
  accompanied by a man with a pistol. Most of them, though, were only too glad
  to obey me.</p>

  <p>Bradley passed the order down into the ship and a moment later the
  gun-crew clambered up the narrow ladder and at my direction trained their
  piece upon the slow-moving Swede. "Fire a shot across her bow," I instructed
  the gun-captain.</p>

  <p>Accept it from me, it didn't take that Swede long to see the error of his
  way and get the red and white pennant signifying "I understand" to the
  masthead. Once again the sails flapped idly, and then I ordered him to lower
  a boat and come after me. With Olson and a couple of the Englishmen I boarded
  the ship, and from her cargo selected what we needed&mdash;oil, provisions
  and water. I gave the master of the <i>Balmen</i> a receipt for what we took,
  together with an affidavit signed by Bradley, Olson, and myself, stating
  briefly how we had come into possession of the <i>U-33</i> and the urgency of
  our need for what we took. We addressed both to any British agent with the
  request that the owners of the <i>Balmen</i> be reimbursed; but whether or
  not they were, I do not know. [1]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[1] Late in July, 1916, an item in the shipping news
  mentioned a Swedish sailing vessel, <i>Balmen</i>, Rio de Janiero to
  Barcelona, sunk by a German raider sometime in June. A single survivor in an
  open boat was picked up off the Cape Verde Islands, in a dying condition. He
  expired without giving any details.</p>

  <p><br>
  With water, food, and oil aboard, we felt that we had obtained a new lease of
  life. Now, too, we knew definitely where we were, and I determined to make
  for Georgetown, British Guiana&mdash;but I was destined to again suffer
  bitter disappointment.</p>

  <p>Six of us of the loyal crew had come on deck either to serve the gun or
  board the Swede during our set-to with her; and now, one by one, we descended
  the ladder into the centrale. I was the last to come, and when I reached the
  bottom, I found myself looking into the muzzle of a pistol in the hands of
  Baron Friedrich von Schoenvorts&mdash;I saw all my men lined up at one side
  with the remaining eight Germans standing guard over them.</p>

  <p>I couldn't imagine how it had happened; but it had. Later I learned that
  they had first overpowered Benson, who was asleep in his bunk, and taken his
  pistol from him, and then had found it an easy matter to disarm the cook and
  the remaining two Englishmen below. After that it had been comparatively
  simple to stand at the foot of the ladder and arrest each individual as he
  descended.</p>

  <p>The first thing von Schoenvorts did was to send for me and announce that
  as a pirate I was to be shot early the next morning. Then he explained that
  the <i>U-33</i> would cruise in these waters for a time, sinking neutral and
  enemy shipping indiscriminately, and looking for one of the German raiders
  that was supposed to be in these parts.</p>

  <p>He didn't shoot me the next morning as he had promised, and it has never
  been clear to me why he postponed the execution of my sentence. Instead he
  kept me ironed just as he had been; then he kicked Bradley out of my room and
  took it all to himself.</p>

  <p>We cruised for a long time, sinking many vessels, all but one by gunfire,
  but we did not come across a German raider. I was surprised to note that von
  Schoenvorts often permitted Benson to take command; but I reconciled this by
  the fact that Benson appeared to know more of the duties of a submarine
  commander than did any of the Stupid Germans.</p>

  <p>Once or twice Lys passed me; but for the most part she kept to her room.
  The first time she hesitated as though she wished to speak to me; but I did
  not raise my head, and finally she passed on. Then one day came the word that
  we were about to round the Horn and that von Schoenvorts had taken it into
  his fool head to cruise up along the Pacific coast of North America and prey
  upon all sorts and conditions of merchantmen.</p>

  <p>"I'll put the fear of God and the Kaiser into them," he said.</p>

  <p>The very first day we entered the South Pacific we had an adventure. It
  turned out to be quite the most exciting adventure I had ever encountered. It
  fell about this way. About eight bells of the forenoon watch I heard a hail
  from the deck, and presently the footsteps of the entire ship's company, from
  the amount of noise I heard at the ladder. Some one yelled back to those who
  had not yet reached the level of the deck: "It's the raider, the German
  raider <i>Geier</i>!"</p>

  <p>I saw that we had reached the end of our rope. Below all was quiet&mdash;
  not a man remained. A door opened at the end of the narrow hull, and
  presently Nobs came trotting up to me. He licked my face and rolled over on
  his back, reaching for me with his big, awkward paws. Then other footsteps
  sounded, approaching me. I knew whose they were, and I looked straight down
  at the flooring. The girl was coming almost at a run&mdash;she was at my side
  immediately. "Here!" she cried. "Quick!" And she slipped something into my
  hand. It was a key&mdash;the key to my irons. At my side she also laid a
  pistol, and then she went on into the centrale. As she passed me, I saw that
  she carried another pistol for herself. It did not take me long to liberate
  myself, and then I was at her side. "How can I thank you?" I started; but she
  shut me up with a word.</p>

  <p>"Do not thank me," she said coldly. "I do not care to hear your thanks or
  any other expression from you. Do not stand there looking at me. I have given
  you a chance to do something&mdash;now do it!" The last was a peremptory
  command that made me jump.</p>

  <p>Glancing up, I saw that the tower was empty, and I lost no time in
  clambering up, looking about me. About a hundred yards off lay a small, swift
  cruiser-raider, and above her floated the German man-of-war's flag. A boat
  had just been lowered, and I could see it moving toward us filled with
  officers and men. The cruiser lay dead ahead. "My," I thought, "what a
  wonderful targ&mdash;&mdash;" I stopped even thinking, so surprised and
  shocked was I by the boldness of my imagery. The girl was just below me. I
  looked down on her wistfully. Could I trust her? Why had she released me at
  this moment? I must! I must! There was no other way. I dropped back below.
  "Ask Olson to step down here, please," I requested; "and don't let anyone see
  you ask him."</p>

  <p>She looked at me with a puzzled expression on her face for the barest
  fraction of a second, and then she turned and went up the ladder. A moment
  later Olson returned, and the girl followed him. "Quick!" I whispered to the
  big Irishman, and made for the bow compartment where the torpedo-tubes are
  built into the boat; here, too, were the torpedoes. The girl accompanied us,
  and when she saw the thing I had in mind, she stepped forward and lent a hand
  to the swinging of the great cylinder of death and destruction into the mouth
  of its tube. With oil and main strength we shoved the torpedo home and shut
  the tube; then I ran back to the conning-tower, praying in my heart of hearts
  that the <i>U-33</i> had not swung her bow away from the prey. No, thank
  God!</p>

  <p>Never could aim have been truer. I signaled back to Olson: "Let 'er go!"
  The <i>U-33</i> trembled from stem to stern as the torpedo shot from its
  tube. I saw the white wake leap from her bow straight toward the enemy
  cruiser. A chorus of hoarse yells arose from the deck of our own craft: I saw
  the officers stand suddenly erect in the boat that was approaching us, and I
  heard loud cries and curses from the raider. Then I turned my attention to my
  own business. Most of the men on the submarine's deck were standing in
  paralyzed fascination, staring at the torpedo. Bradley happened to be looking
  toward the conning-tower and saw me. I sprang on deck and ran toward him.
  "Quick!" I whispered. "While they are stunned, we must overcome them."</p>

  <p>A German was standing near Bradley&mdash;just in front of him. The
  Englishman struck the fellow a frantic blow upon the neck and at the same
  time snatched his pistol from its holster. Von Schoenvorts had recovered from
  his first surprise quickly and had turned toward the main hatch to
  investigate. I covered him with my revolver, and at the same instant the
  torpedo struck the raider, the terrific explosion drowning the German's
  command to his men.</p>

  <p>Bradley was now running from one to another of our men, and though some of
  the Germans saw and heard him, they seemed too stunned for action.</p>

  <p>Olson was below, so that there were only nine of us against eight Germans,
  for the man Bradley had struck still lay upon the deck. Only two of us were
  armed; but the heart seemed to have gone out of the Boches, and they put up
  but half-hearted resistance. Von Schoenvorts was the worst&mdash;he was
  fairly frenzied with rage and chagrin, and he came charging for me like a mad
  bull, and as he came he discharged his pistol. If he'd stopped long enough to
  take aim, he might have gotten me; but his pace made him wild, so that not a
  shot touched me, and then we clinched and went to the deck. This left two
  pistols, which two of my own men were quick to appropriate. The Baron was no
  match for me in a hand-to-hand encounter, and I soon had him pinned to the
  deck and the life almost choked out of him.</p>

  <p>A half-hour later things had quieted down, and all was much the same as
  before the prisoners had revolted&mdash;only we kept a much closer watch on
  von Schoenvorts. The <i>Geier</i> had sunk while we were still battling upon
  our deck, and afterward we had drawn away toward the north, leaving the
  survivors to the attention of the single boat which had been making its way
  toward us when Olson launched the torpedo. I suppose the poor devils never
  reached land, and if they did, they most probably perished on that cold and
  unhospitable shore; but I couldn't permit them aboard the <i>U-33</i>. We had
  all the Germans we could take care of.</p>

  <p>That evening the girl asked permission to go on deck. She said that she
  felt the effects of long confinement below, and I readily granted her
  request. I could not understand her, and I craved an opportunity to talk with
  her again in an effort to fathom her and her intentions, and so I made it a
  point to follow her up the ladder. It was a clear, cold, beautiful night. The
  sea was calm except for the white water at our bows and the two long
  radiating swells running far off into the distance upon either hand astern,
  forming a great V which our propellers filled with choppy waves. Benson was
  in the tower, we were bound for San Diego and all looked well.</p>

  <p>Lys stood with a heavy blanket wrapped around her slender figure, and as I
  approached her, she half turned toward me to see who it was. When she
  recognized me, she immediately turned away.</p>

  <p>"I want to thank you," I said, "for your bravery and loyalty&mdash;you
  were magnificent. I am sorry that you had reason before to think that I
  doubted you."</p>

  <p>"You did doubt me," she replied in a level voice. "You practically accused
  me of aiding Baron von Schoenvorts. I can never forgive you."</p>

  <p>There was a great deal of finality in both her words and tone.</p>

  <p>"I could not believe it," I said; "and yet two of my men reported having
  seen you in conversation with von Schoenvorts late at night upon two separate
  occasions&mdash;after each of which some great damage was found done to us in
  the morning. I didn't want to doubt you; but I carried all the responsibility
  of the lives of these men, of the safety of the ship, of your life and mine.
  I had to watch you, and I had to put you on your guard against a repetition
  of your madness."</p>

  <p>She was looking at me now with those great eyes of hers, very wide and
  round.</p>

  <p>"Who told you that I spoke with Baron von Schoenvorts at night, or any
  other time?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you, Lys," I replied, "but it came to me from two different
  sources."</p>

  <p>"Then two men have lied," she asserted without heat. "I have not spoken to
  Baron von Schoenvorts other than in your presence when first we came aboard
  the <i>U-33</i>. And please, when you address me, remember that to others
  than my intimates I am Miss La Rue."</p>

  <p>Did you ever get slapped in the face when you least expected it? No? Well,
  then you do not know how I felt at that moment. I could feel the hot, red
  flush surging up my neck, across my cheeks, over my ears, clear to my scalp.
  And it made me love her all the more; it made me swear inwardly a thousand
  solemn oaths that I would win her.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="Caspak1-4"
     id="Caspak1-4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR several days things went along in about the same course.
  I took our position every morning with my crude sextant; but the results were
  always most unsatisfactory. They always showed a considerable westing when I
  knew that we had been sailing due north. I blamed my crude instrument, and
  kept on. Then one afternoon the girl came to me.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," she said, "but were I you, I should watch this man
  Benson&mdash;especially when he is in charge." I asked her what she meant,
  thinking I could see the influence of von Schoenvorts raising a suspicion
  against one of my most trusted men.</p>

  <p>"If you will note the boat's course a half-hour after Benson goes on
  duty," she said, "you will know what I mean, and you will understand why he
  prefers a night watch. Possibly, too, you will understand some other things
  that have taken place aboard."</p>

  <p>Then she went back to her room, thus ending the conversation. I waited
  until half an hour after Benson had gone on duty, and then I went on deck,
  passing through the conning-tower where Benson sat, and looking at the
  compass. It showed that our course was north by west&mdash;that is, one point
  west of north, which was, for our assumed position, about right. I was
  greatly relieved to find that nothing was wrong, for the girl's words had
  caused me considerable apprehension. I was about to return to my room when a
  thought occurred to me that again caused me to change my mind&mdash;and,
  incidentally, came near proving my death-warrant.</p>

  <p>When I had left the conning-tower little more than a half-hour since, the
  sea had been breaking over the port bow, and it seemed to me quite improbable
  that in so short a time an equally heavy sea could be deluging us from the
  opposite side of the ship&mdash;winds may change quickly, but not a long,
  heavy sea. There was only one other solution&mdash;since I left the tower,
  our course had been altered some eight points. Turning quickly, I climbed out
  upon the conning-tower. A single glance at the heavens confirmed my
  suspicions; the constellations which should have been dead ahead were
  directly starboard. We were sailing due west.</p>

  <p>Just for an instant longer I stood there to check up my calculations
  &mdash;I wanted to be quite sure before I accused Benson of perfidy, and
  about the only thing I came near making quite sure of was death. I cannot see
  even now how I escaped it. I was standing on the edge of the conning-tower,
  when a heavy palm suddenly struck me between the shoulders and hurled me
  forward into space. The drop to the triangular deck forward of the
  conning-tower might easily have broken a leg for me, or I might have slipped
  off onto the deck and rolled overboard; but fate was upon my side, as I was
  only slightly bruised. As I came to my feet, I heard the conning-tower cover
  slam. There is a ladder which leads from the deck to the top of the tower. Up
  this I scrambled, as fast as I could go; but Benson had the cover tight
  before I reached it.</p>

  <p>I stood there a moment in dumb consternation. What did the fellow intend?
  What was going on below? If Benson was a traitor, how could I know that there
  were not other traitors among us? I cursed myself for my folly in going out
  upon the deck, and then this thought suggested another&mdash;a hideous one:
  who was it that had really been responsible for my being here?</p>

  <p>Thinking to attract attention from inside the craft, I again ran down the
  ladder and onto the small deck only to find that the steel covers of the
  conning-tower windows were shut, and then I leaned with my back against the
  tower and cursed myself for a gullible idiot.</p>

  <p>I glanced at the bow. The sea seemed to be getting heavier, for every wave
  now washed completely over the lower deck. I watched them for a moment, and
  then a sudden chill pervaded my entire being. It was not the chill of wet
  clothing, or the dashing spray which drenched my face; no, it was the chill
  of the hand of death upon my heart. In an instant I had turned the last
  corner of life's highway and was looking God Almighty in the face&mdash;the
  <i>U-33</i> was being slowly submerged!</p>

  <p>It would be difficult, even impossible, to set down in writing my
  sensations at that moment. All I can particularly recall is that I laughed,
  though neither from a spirit of bravado nor from hysteria. And I wanted to
  smoke. Lord! how I did want to smoke; but that was out of the question.</p>

  <p>I watched the water rise until the little deck I stood on was awash, and
  then I clambered once more to the top of the conning-tower. From the very
  slow submergence of the boat I knew that Benson was doing the entire trick
  alone&mdash;that he was merely permitting the diving-tanks to fill and that
  the diving-rudders were not in use. The throbbing of the engines ceased, and
  in its stead came the steady vibration of the electric motors. The water was
  halfway up the conning-tower! I had perhaps five minutes longer on the deck.
  I tried to decide what I should do after I was washed away. Should I swim
  until exhaustion claimed me, or should I give up and end the agony at the
  first plunge?</p>

  <p>From below came two muffled reports. They sounded not unlike shots. Was
  Benson meeting with resistance? Personally it could mean little to me, for
  even though my men might overcome the enemy, none would know of my
  predicament until long after it was too late to succor me. The top of the
  conning-tower was now awash. I clung to the wireless mast, while the great
  waves surged sometimes completely over me.</p>

  <p>I knew the end was near and, almost involuntarily, I did that which I had
  not done since childhood&mdash;I prayed. After that I felt better.</p>

  <p>I clung and waited, but the water rose no higher.</p>

  <p>Instead it receded. Now the top of the conning-tower received only the
  crests of the higher waves; now the little triangular deck below became
  visible! What had occurred within? Did Benson believe me already gone, and
  was he emerging because of that belief, or had he and his forces been
  vanquished? The suspense was more wearing than that which I had endured while
  waiting for dissolution. Presently the main deck came into view, and then the
  conning-tower opened behind me, and I turned to look into the anxious face of
  Bradley. An expression of relief overspread his features.</p>

  <p>"Thank God, man!" was all he said as he reached forth and dragged me into
  the tower. I was cold and numb and rather all in. Another few minutes would
  have done for me, I am sure, but the warmth of the interior helped to revive
  me, aided and abetted by some brandy which Bradley poured down my throat,
  from which it nearly removed the membrane. That brandy would have revived a
  corpse.</p>

  <p>When I got down into the centrale, I saw the Germans lined up on one side
  with a couple of my men with pistols standing over them. Von Schoenvorts was
  among them. On the floor lay Benson, moaning, and beyond him stood the girl,
  a revolver in one hand. I looked about, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"What has happened down here?" I asked. "Tell me!"</p>

  <p>Bradley replied. "You see the result, sir," he said. "It might have been a
  very different result but for Miss La Rue. We were all asleep. Benson had
  relieved the guard early in the evening; there was no one to watch him
  &mdash;no one but Miss La Rue. She felt the submergence of the boat and came
  out of her room to investigate. She was just in time to see Benson at the
  diving rudders. When he saw her, he raised his pistol and fired point-blank
  at her, but he missed and she fired&mdash;and didn't miss. The two shots
  awakened everyone, and as our men were armed, the result was inevitable as
  you see it; but it would have been very different had it not been for Miss La
  Rue. It was she who closed the diving-tank sea-cocks and roused Olson and me,
  and had the pumps started to empty them."</p>

  <p>And there I had been thinking that through her machinations I had been
  lured to the deck and to my death! I could have gone on my knees to her and
  begged her forgiveness&mdash;or at least I could have, had I not been
  Anglo-Saxon. As it was, I could only remove my soggy cap and bow and mumble
  my appreciation. She made no reply&mdash;only turned and walked very rapidly
  toward her room. Could I have heard aright? Was it really a sob that came
  floating back to me through the narrow aisle of the <i>U-33</i>?</p>

  <p>Benson died that night. He remained defiant almost to the last; but just
  before he went out, he motioned to me, and I leaned over to catch the faintly
  whispered words.</p>

  <p>"I did it alone," he said. "I did it because I hate you&mdash;I hate all
  your kind. I was kicked out of your shipyard at Santa Monica. I was locked
  out of California. I am an I. W. W. I became a German agent&mdash;not because
  I love them, for I hate them too&mdash;but because I wanted to injure
  Americans, whom I hated more. I threw the wireless apparatus overboard. I
  destroyed the chronometer and the sextant. I devised a scheme for varying the
  compass to suit my wishes. I told Wilson that I had seen the girl talking
  with von Schoenvorts, and I made the poor egg think he had seen her doing the
  same thing. I am sorry&mdash;sorry that my plans failed. I hate you."</p>

  <p>He didn't die for a half-hour after that; nor did he speak again&mdash;
  aloud; but just a few seconds before he went to meet his Maker, his lips
  moved in a faint whisper; and as I leaned closer to catch his words, what do
  you suppose I heard? "Now&mdash;I&mdash;lay me&mdash;down&mdash;to
  &mdash;sleep" That was all; Benson was dead. We threw his body overboard.</p>

  <p>The wind of that night brought on some pretty rough weather with a lot of
  black clouds which persisted for several days. We didn't know what course we
  had been holding, and there was no way of finding out, as we could no longer
  trust the compass, not knowing what Benson had done to it. The long and the
  short of it was that we cruised about aimlessly until the sun came out again.
  I'll never forget that day or its surprises. We reckoned, or rather guessed,
  that we were somewhere off the coast of Peru. The wind, which had been
  blowing fitfully from the east, suddenly veered around into the south, and
  presently we felt a sudden chill.</p>

  <p>"Peru!" snorted Olson. "When were yez after smellin' iceber-rgs off
  Peru?"</p>

  <p>Icebergs! "Icebergs, nothin'!" exclaimed one of the Englishmen. "Why, man,
  they don't come north of fourteen here in these waters."</p>

  <p>"Then," replied Olson, "ye're sout' of fourteen, me b'y."</p>

  <p>We thought he was crazy; but he wasn't, for that afternoon we sighted a
  great berg south of us, and we'd been running north, we thought, for days. I
  can tell you we were a discouraged lot; but we got a faint thrill of hope
  early the next morning when the lookout bawled down the open hatch: "Land!
  Land northwest by west!"</p>

  <p>I think we were all sick for the sight of land. I know that I was; but my
  interest was quickly dissipated by the sudden illness of three of the
  Germans. Almost simultaneously they commenced vomiting. They couldn't suggest
  any explanation for it. I asked them what they had eaten, and found they had
  eaten nothing other than the food cooked for all of us. "Have you drunk
  anything?" I asked, for I knew that there was liquor aboard, and medicines in
  the same locker.</p>

  <p>"Only water," moaned one of them. "We all drank water together this
  morning. We opened a new tank. Maybe it was the water."</p>

  <p>I started an investigation which revealed a terrifying condition&mdash;
  some one, probably Benson, had poisoned all the running water on the ship. It
  would have been worse, though, had land not been in sight. The sight of land
  filled us with renewed hope.</p>

  <p>Our course had been altered, and we were rapidly approaching what appeared
  to be a precipitous headland. Cliffs, seemingly rising perpendicularly out of
  the sea, faded away into the mist upon either hand as we approached. The land
  before us might have been a continent, so mighty appeared the shoreline; yet
  we knew that we must be thousands of miles from the nearest western
  land-mass&mdash;New Zealand or Australia.</p>

  <p>We took our bearings with our crude and inaccurate instruments; we
  searched the chart; we cudgeled our brains; and at last it was Bradley who
  suggested a solution. He was in the tower and watching the compass, to which
  he called my attention. The needle was pointing straight toward the land.
  Bradley swung the helm hard to starboard. I could feel the <i>U-33</i>
  respond, and yet the arrow still clung straight and sure toward the distant
  cliffs.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear of Caproni?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"An early Italian navigator?" I returned.</p>

  <p>"Yes; he followed Cook about 1721. He is scarcely mentioned even by
  contemporaneous historians&mdash;probably because he got into political
  difficulties on his return to Italy. It was the fashion to scoff at his
  claims, but I recall reading one of his works&mdash;his only one, I believe
  -in which he described a new continent in the south seas, a continent made up
  of `some strange metal' which attracted the compass; a rockbound,
  inhospitable coast, without beach or harbor, which extended for hundreds of
  miles. He could make no landing; nor in the several days he cruised about it
  did he see sign of life. He called it Caprona and sailed away. I believe,
  sir, that we are looking upon the coast of Caprona, uncharted and forgotten
  for two hundred years."</p>

  <p>"If you are right, it might account for much of the deviation of the
  compass during the past two days," I suggested. "Caprona has been luring us
  upon her deadly rocks. Well, we'll accept her challenge. We'll land upon
  Caprona. Along that long front there must be a vulnerable spot. We will find
  it, Bradley, for we must find it. We must find water on Caprona, or we must
  die."</p>

  <p>And so we approached the coast upon which no living eyes had ever rested.
  Straight from the ocean's depths rose towering cliffs, shot with brown and
  blues and greens&mdash;withered moss and lichen and the verdigris of copper,
  and everywhere the rusty ocher of iron pyrites. The cliff-tops, though
  ragged, were of such uniform height as to suggest the boundaries of a great
  plateau, and now and again we caught glimpses of verdure topping the rocky
  escarpment, as though bush or jungle-land had pushed outward from a lush
  vegetation farther inland to signal to an unseeing world that Caprona lived
  and joyed in life beyond her austere and repellent coast.</p>

  <p>But metaphor, however poetic, never slaked a dry throat. To enjoy
  Caprona's romantic suggestions we must have water, and so we came in close,
  always sounding, and skirted the shore. As close in as we dared cruise, we
  found fathomless depths, and always the same indented coastline of bald
  cliffs. As darkness threatened, we drew away and lay well off the coast all
  night. We had not as yet really commenced to suffer for lack of water; but I
  knew that it would not be long before we did, and so at the first streak of
  dawn I moved in again and once more took up the hopeless survey of the
  forbidding coast.</p>

  <p>Toward noon we discovered a beach, the first we had seen. It was a narrow
  strip of sand at the base of a part of the cliff that seemed lower than any
  we had before scanned. At its foot, half buried in the sand, lay great
  boulders, mute evidence that in a bygone age some mighty natural force had
  crumpled Caprona's barrier at this point. It was Bradley who first called our
  attention to a strange object lying among the boulders above the surf.</p>

  <p>"Looks like a man," he said, and passed his glasses to me.</p>

  <p>I looked long and carefully and could have sworn that the thing I saw was
  the sprawled figure of a human being. Miss La Rue was on deck with us. I
  turned and asked her to go below. Without a word she did as I bade. Then I
  stripped, and as I did so, Nobs looked questioningly at me. He had been wont
  at home to enter the surf with me, and evidently he had not forgotten it.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do, sir?" asked Olson.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to see what that thing is on shore," I replied. "If it's a man,
  it may mean that Caprona is inhabited, or it may merely mean that some poor
  devils were shipwrecked here. I ought to be able to tell from the clothing
  which is more near the truth."</p>

  <p>"How about sharks?" queried Olson. "Sure, you ought to carry a
  knoife."</p>

  <p>"Here you are, sir," cried one of the men.</p>

  <p>It was a long slim blade he offered&mdash;one that I could carry between
  my teeth&mdash;and so I accepted it gladly.</p>

  <p>"Keep close in," I directed Bradley, and then I dived over the side and
  struck out for the narrow beach. There was another splash directly behind me,
  and turning my head, I saw faithful old Nobs swimming valiantly in my
  wake.</p>

  <p>The surf was not heavy, and there was no undertow, so we made shore
  easily, effecting an equally easy landing. The beach was composed largely of
  small stones worn smooth by the action of water. There was little sand,
  though from the deck of the <i>U-33</i> the beach had appeared to be all
  sand, and I saw no evidences of mollusca or crustacea such as are common to
  all beaches I have previously seen. I attribute this to the fact of the
  smallness of the beach, the enormous depth of surrounding water and the great
  distance at which Caprona lies from her nearest neighbor.</p>

  <p>As Nobs and I approached the recumbent figure farther up the beach, I was
  appraised by my nose that whether or not, the thing had once been organic and
  alive, but that for some time it had been dead. Nobs halted, sniffed and
  growled. A little later he sat down upon his haunches, raised his muzzle to
  the heavens and bayed forth a most dismal howl. I shied a small stone at him
  and bade him shut up&mdash;his uncanny noise made me nervous. When I had come
  quite close to the thing, I still could not say whether it had been man or
  beast. The carcass was badly swollen and partly decomposed. There was no sign
  of clothing upon or about it. A fine, brownish hair covered the chest and
  abdomen, and the face, the palms of the hands, the feet, the shoulders and
  back were practically hairless. The creature must have been about the height
  of a fair sized man; its features were similar to those of a man; yet had it
  been a man?</p>

  <p>I could not say, for it resembled an ape no more than it did a man. Its
  large toes protruded laterally as do those of the semiarboreal peoples of
  Borneo, the Philippines and other remote regions where low types still
  persist. The countenance might have been that of a cross between
  <i>Pithecanthropus</i>, the Java ape-man, and a daughter of the Piltdown race
  of prehistoric Sussex. A wooden cudgel lay beside the corpse.</p>

  <p>Now this fact set me thinking. There was no wood of any description in
  sight. There was nothing about the beach to suggest a wrecked mariner. There
  was absolutely nothing about the body to suggest that it might possibly in
  life have known a maritime experience. It was the body of a low type of man
  or a high type of beast. In neither instance would it have been of a
  seafaring race. Therefore I deduced that it was native to Caprona&mdash; that
  it lived inland, and that it had fallen or been hurled from the cliffs above.
  Such being the case, Caprona was inhabitable, if not inhabited, by man; but
  how to reach the inhabitable interior! That was the question. A closer view
  of the cliffs than had been afforded me from the deck of the <i>U-33</i> only
  confirmed my conviction that no mortal man could scale those perpendicular
  heights; there was not a finger-hold, not a toe-hold, upon them. I turned
  away baffled.</p>

  <p>Nobs and I met with no sharks upon our return journey to the submarine. My
  report filled everyone with theories and speculations, and with renewed hope
  and determination. They all reasoned along the same lines that I had reasoned
  &mdash;the conclusions were obvious, but not the water. We were now thirstier
  than ever.</p>

  <p>The balance of that day we spent in continuing a minute and fruitless
  exploration of the monotonous coast. There was not another break in the
  frowning cliffs&mdash;not even another minute patch of pebbly beach. As the
  sun fell, so did our spirits. I had tried to make advances to the girl again;
  but she would have none of me, and so I was not only thirsty but otherwise
  sad and downhearted. I was glad when the new day broke the hideous spell of a
  sleepless night.</p>

  <p>The morning's search brought us no shred of hope. Caprona was impregnable
  &mdash;that was the decision of all; yet we kept on. It must have been about
  two bells of the afternoon watch that Bradley called my attention to the
  branch of a tree, with leaves upon it, floating on the sea. "It may have been
  carried down to the ocean by a river," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied, "it may have; it may have tumbled or been thrown off the
  top of one of these cliffs."</p>

  <p>Bradley's face fell. "I thought of that, too," he replied, "but I wanted
  to believe the other."</p>

  <p>"Right you are!" I cried. "We must believe the other until we prove it
  false. We can't afford to give up heart now, when we need heart most. The
  branch was carried down by a river, and we are going to find that river." I
  smote my open palm with a clenched fist, to emphasize a determination
  unsupported by hope. "There!" I cried suddenly. "See that, Bradley?" And I
  pointed at a spot closer to shore. "See that, man!" Some flowers and grasses
  and another leafy branch floated toward us. We both scanned the water and the
  coastline. Bradley evidently discovered something, or at least thought that
  he had. He called down for a bucket and a rope, and when they were passed up
  to him, he lowered the former into the sea and drew it in filled with water.
  Of this he took a taste, and straightening up, looked into my eyes with an
  expression of elation&mdash;as much as to say "I told you so!"</p>

  <p>"This water is warm," he announced, "and fresh!"</p>

  <p>I grabbed the bucket and tasted its contents. The water was very warm, and
  it was fresh, but there was a most unpleasant taste to it.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever taste water from a stagnant pool full of tadpoles?" Bradley
  asked.</p>

  <p>"That's it," I exclaimed, "&mdash;that's just the taste exactly, though I
  haven't experienced it since boyhood; but how can water from a flowing
  stream, taste thus, and what the dickens makes it so warm? It must be at
  least 70 or 80 Fahrenheit, possibly higher."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Bradley, "I should say higher; but where does it come
  from?"</p>

  <p>"That is easily discovered now that we have found it," I answered. "It
  can't come from the ocean; so it must come from the land. All that we have to
  do is follow it, and sooner or later we shall come upon its source."</p>

  <p>We were already rather close in; but I ordered the <i>U-33</i>'s prow
  turned inshore and we crept slowly along, constantly dipping up the water and
  tasting it to assure ourselves that we didn't get outside the fresh-water
  current. There was a very light off-shore wind and scarcely any breakers, so
  that the approach to the shore was continued without finding bottom; yet
  though we were already quite close, we saw no indication of any indention in
  the coast from which even a tiny brooklet might issue, and certainly no mouth
  of a large river such as this must necessarily be to freshen the ocean even
  two hundred yards from shore. The tide was running out, and this, together
  with the strong flow of the freshwater current, would have prevented our
  going against the cliffs even had we not been under power; as it was we had
  to buck the combined forces in order to hold our position at all. We came up
  to within twenty-five feet of the sheer wall, which loomed high above us.
  There was no break in its forbidding face. As we watched the face of the
  waters and searched the cliff's high face, Olson suggested that the fresh
  water might come from a submarine geyser. This, he said, would account for
  its heat; but even as he spoke a bush, covered thickly with leaves and
  flowers, bubbled to the surface and floated off astern.</p>

  <p>"Flowering shrubs don't thrive in the subterranean caverns from which
  geysers spring," suggested Bradley.</p>

  <p>Olson shook his head. "It beats me," he said.</p>

  <p>"I've got it!" I exclaimed suddenly. "Look there!" And I pointed at the
  base of the cliff ahead of us, which the receding tide was gradually exposing
  to our view. They all looked, and all saw what I had seen&mdash;the top of a
  dark opening in the rock, through which water was pouring out into the sea.
  "It's the subterranean channel of an inland river," I cried. "It flows
  through a land covered with vegetation&mdash;and therefore a land upon which
  the sun shines. No subterranean caverns produce any order of plant life even
  remotely resembling what we have seen disgorged by this river. Beyond those
  cliffs lie fertile lands and fresh water&mdash;perhaps, game!"</p>

  <p>"Yis, sir," said Olson, "behoind the cliffs! Ye spoke a true word,
  sir&mdash;behoind!"</p>

  <p>Bradley laughed&mdash;a rather sorry laugh, though. "You might as well
  call our attention to the fact, sir," he said, "that science has indicated
  that there is fresh water and vegetation on Mars."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," I rejoined. "A U-boat isn't constructed to navigate space,
  but it is designed to travel below the surface of the water."</p>

  <p>"You'd be after sailin' into that blank pocket?" asked Olson.</p>

  <p>"I would, Olson," I replied. "We haven't one chance for life in a hundred
  thousand if we don't find food and water upon Caprona. This water coming out
  of the cliff is not salt; but neither is it fit to drink, though each of us
  has drunk. It is fair to assume that inland the river is fed by pure streams,
  that there are fruits and herbs and game. Shall we lie out here and die of
  thirst and starvation with a land of plenty possibly only a few hundred yards
  away? We have the means for navigating a subterranean river. Are we too
  cowardly to utilize this means?"</p>

  <p>"Be afther goin' to it," said Olson.</p>

  <p>"I'm willing to see it through," agreed Bradley.</p>

  <p>"Then under the bottom, wi' the best o' luck an' give 'em hell!" cried a
  young fellow who had been in the trenches.</p>

  <p>"To the diving-stations!" I commanded, and in less than a minute the deck
  was deserted, the conning-tower covers had slammed to and the <i>U-33</i> was
  submerging&mdash;possibly for the last time. I know that I had this feeling,
  and I think that most of the others did.</p>

  <p>As we went down, I sat in the tower with the searchlight projecting its
  seemingly feeble rays ahead. We submerged very slowly and without headway
  more than sufficient to keep her nose in the right direction, and as we went
  down, I saw outlined ahead of us the black opening in the great cliff. It was
  an opening that would have admitted a half-dozen U-boats at one and the same
  time, roughly cylindrical in contour&mdash;and dark as the pit of
  perdition.</p>

  <p>As I gave the command which sent the <i>U-33</i> slowly ahead, I could not
  but feel a certain uncanny presentiment of evil. Where were we going? What
  lay at the end of this great sewer? Had we bidden farewell forever to the
  sunlight and life, or were there before us dangers even greater than those
  which we now faced? I tried to keep my mind from vain imagining by calling
  everything which I observed to the eager ears below. I was the eyes of the
  whole company, and I did my best not to fail them. We had advanced a hundred
  yards, perhaps, when our first danger confronted us. Just ahead was a sharp
  right-angle turn in the tunnel. I could see the river's flotsam hurtling
  against the rocky wall upon the left as it was driven on by the mighty
  current, and I feared for the safety of the <i>U-33</i> in making so sharp a
  turn under such adverse conditions; but there was nothing for it but to try.
  I didn't warn my fellows of the danger&mdash;it could have but caused them
  useless apprehension, for if we were to be smashed against the rocky wall, no
  power on earth could avert the quick end that would come to us. I gave the
  command full speed ahead and went charging toward the menace. I was forced to
  approach the dangerous left-hand wall in order to make the turn, and I
  depended upon the power of the motors to carry us through the surging waters
  in safety. Well, we made it; but it was a narrow squeak. As we swung around,
  the full force of the current caught us and drove the stern against the
  rocks; there was a thud which sent a tremor through the whole craft, and then
  a moment of nasty grinding as the steel hull scraped the rock wall. I
  expected momentarily the inrush of waters that would seal our doom; but
  presently from below came the welcome word that all was well.</p>

  <p>In another fifty yards there was a second turn, this time toward the left!
  but it was more of a gentle curve, and we took it without trouble. After that
  it was plain sailing, though as far as I could know, there might be most
  anything ahead of us, and my nerves strained to the snapping-point every
  instant. After the second turn the channel ran comparatively straight for
  between one hundred and fifty and two hundred yards. The waters grew suddenly
  lighter, and my spirits rose accordingly. I shouted down to those below that
  I saw daylight ahead, and a great shout of thanksgiving reverberated through
  the ship. A moment later we emerged into sunlit water, and immediately I
  raised the periscope and looked about me upon the strangest landscape I had
  ever seen.</p>

  <p>We were in the middle of a broad and now sluggish river the banks of which
  were lined by giant, arboraceous ferns, raising their mighty fronds fifty,
  one hundred, two hundred feet into the quiet air. Close by us something rose
  to the surface of the river and dashed at the periscope. I had a vision of
  wide, distended jaws, and then all was blotted out. A shiver ran down into
  the tower as the thing closed upon the periscope. A moment later it was gone,
  and I could see again. Above the trees there soared into my vision a huge
  thing on batlike wings&mdash;a creature large as a large whale, but fashioned
  more after the order of a lizard. Then again something charged the periscope
  and blotted out the mirror. I will confess that I was almost gasping for
  breath as I gave the commands to emerge. Into what sort of strange land had
  fate guided us?</p>

  <p>The instant the deck was awash, I opened the conning-tower hatch and
  stepped out. In another minute the deck-hatch lifted, and those who were not
  on duty below streamed up the ladder, Olson bringing Nobs under one arm. For
  several minutes no one spoke; I think they must each have been as overcome by
  awe as was I. All about us was a flora and fauna as strange and wonderful to
  us as might have been those upon a distant planet had we suddenly been
  miraculously transported through ether to an unknown world. Even the grass
  upon the nearer bank was unearthly&mdash;lush and high it grew, and each
  blade bore upon its tip a brilliant flower&mdash;violet or yellow or carmine
  or blue&mdash;making as gorgeous a sward as human imagination might conceive.
  But the life! It teemed. The tall, fernlike trees were alive with monkeys,
  snakes, and lizards. Huge insects hummed and buzzed hither and thither.
  Mighty forms could be seen moving upon the ground in the thick forest, while
  the bosom of the river wriggled with living things, and above flapped the
  wings of gigantic creatures such as we are taught have been extinct
  throughout countless ages.</p>

  <p>"Look!" cried Olson. "Would you look at the giraffe comin' up out o' the
  bottom of the say?" We looked in the direction he pointed and saw a long,
  glossy neck surmounted by a small head rising above the surface of the river.
  Presently the back of the creature was exposed, brown and glossy as the water
  dripped from it. It turned its eyes upon us, opened its lizard-like mouth,
  emitted a shrill hiss and came for us. The thing must have been sixteen or
  eighteen feet in length and closely resembled pictures I had seen of restored
  plesiosaurs of the lower Jurassic. It charged us as savagely as a mad bull,
  and one would have thought it intended to destroy and devour the mighty
  U-boat, as I verily believe it did intend.</p>

  <p>We were moving slowly up the river as the creature bore down upon us with
  distended jaws. The long neck was far outstretched, and the four flippers
  with which it swam were working with powerful strokes, carrying it forward at
  a rapid pace. When it reached the craft's side, the jaws closed upon one of
  the stanchions of the deck rail and tore it from its socket as though it had
  been a toothpick stuck in putty. At this exhibition of titanic strength I
  think we all simultaneously stepped backward, and Bradley drew his revolver
  and fired. The bullet struck the thing in the neck, just above its body; but
  instead of disabling it, merely increased its rage. Its hissing rose to a
  shrill scream as it raised half its body out of water onto the sloping sides
  of the hull of the <i>U-33</i> and endeavored to scramble upon the deck to
  devour us. A dozen shots rang out as we who were armed drew our pistols and
  fired at the thing; but though struck several times, it showed no signs of
  succumbing and only floundered farther aboard the submarine.</p>

  <p>I had noticed that the girl had come on deck and was standing not far
  behind me, and when I saw the danger to which we were all exposed, I turned
  and forced her toward the hatch. We had not spoken for some days, and we did
  not speak now; but she gave me a disdainful look, which was quite as eloquent
  as words, and broke loose from my grasp. I saw I could do nothing with her
  unless I exerted force, and so I turned with my back toward her that I might
  be in a position to shield her from the strange reptile should it really
  succeed in reaching the deck; and as I did so I saw the thing raise one
  flipper over the rail, dart its head forward and with the quickness of
  lightning seize upon one of the Boches. I ran forward, discharging my pistol
  into the creature's body in an effort to force it to relinquish its prey; but
  I might as profitably have shot at the sun.</p>

  <p>Shrieking and screaming, the German was dragged from the deck, and the
  moment the reptile was clear of the boat, it dived beneath the surface of the
  water with its terrified prey. I think we were all more or less shaken by the
  frightfulness of the tragedy&mdash;until Olson remarked that the balance of
  power now rested where it belonged. Following the death of Benson we had been
  nine and nine&mdash;nine Germans and nine "Allies," as we called ourselves,
  now there were but eight Germans. We never counted the girl on either side, I
  suppose because she was a girl, though we knew well enough now that she was
  ours.</p>

  <p>And so Olson's remark helped to clear the atmosphere for the Allies at
  least, and then our attention was once more directed toward the river, for
  around us there had sprung up a perfect bedlam of screams and hisses and a
  seething caldron of hideous reptiles, devoid of fear and filled only with
  hunger and with rage. They clambered, squirmed and wriggled to the deck,
  forcing us steadily backward, though we emptied our pistols into them. There
  were all sorts and conditions of horrible things&mdash;huge, hideous,
  grotesque, monstrous&mdash;a veritable Mesozoic nightmare. I saw that the
  girl was gotten below as quickly as possible, and she took Nobs with her
  &mdash;poor Nobs had nearly barked his head off; and I think, too, that for
  the first time since his littlest puppyhood he had known fear; nor can I
  blame him. After the girl I sent Bradley and most of the Allies and then the
  Germans who were on deck&mdash;von Schoenvorts being still in irons
  below.</p><a id="pic1"

    <p class="caption">There were all sorts and conditions of horrible
    things&mdash;huge, hideous, grotesque, monsters.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The creatures were approaching perilously close before I dropped through
  the hatchway and slammed down the cover. Then I went into the tower and
  ordered full speed ahead, hoping to distance the fearsome things; but it was
  useless. Not only could any of them easily outdistance the <i>U-33</i>, but
  the further upstream we progressed the greater the number of our besiegers,
  until fearful of navigating a strange river at high speed, I gave orders to
  reduce and moved slowly and majestically through the plunging, hissing mass.
  I was mighty glad that our entrance into the interior of Caprona had been
  inside a submarine rather than in any other form of vessel. I could readily
  understand how it might have been that Caprona had been invaded in the past
  by venturesome navigators without word of it ever reaching the outside world,
  for I can assure you that only by submarine could man pass up that great
  sluggish river, alive.</p>

  <p>We proceeded up the river for some forty miles before darkness overtook
  us. I was afraid to submerge and lie on the bottom overnight for fear that
  the mud might be deep enough to hold us, and as we could not hold with the
  anchor, I ran in close to shore, and in a brief interim of attack from the
  reptiles we made fast to a large tree. We also dipped up some of the river
  water and found it, though quite warm, a little sweeter than before. We had
  food enough, and with the water we were all quite refreshed; but we missed
  fresh meat. It had been weeks, now, since we had tasted it, and the sight of
  the reptiles gave me an idea&mdash;that a steak or two from one of them might
  not be bad eating. So I went on deck with a rifle, twenty of which were
  aboard the <i>U-33</i>. At sight of me a huge thing charged and climbed to
  the deck. I retreated to the top of the conning-tower, and when it had raised
  its mighty bulk to the level of the little deck on which I stood, I let it
  have a bullet right between the eyes.</p><a id="pic2"
        name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">A huge thing charged and climbed to the deck.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The thing stopped then and looked at me a moment as much as to say: "Why
  this thing has a stinger! I must be careful." And then it reached out its
  long neck and opened its mighty jaws and grabbed for me; but I wasn't there.
  I had tumbled backward into the tower, and I mighty near killed myself doing
  it. When I glanced up, that little head on the end of its long neck was
  coming straight down on top of me, and once more I tumbled into greater
  safety, sprawling upon the floor of the centrale.</p>

  <p>Olson was looking up, and seeing what was poking about in the tower, ran
  for an ax; nor did he hesitate a moment when he returned with one, but sprang
  up the ladder and commenced chopping away at that hideous face. The thing
  didn't have sufficient brainpan to entertain more than a single idea at once.
  Though chopped and hacked, and with a bullethole between its eyes, it still
  persisted madly in its attempt to get inside the tower and devour Olson,
  though its body was many times the diameter of the hatch; nor did it cease
  its efforts until after Olson had succeeded in decapitating it. Then two men
  went on deck through the main hatch, and while one kept watch, the other cut
  a hind quarter off <i>Plesiosaurus Olsoni</i>, as Bradley dubbed the thing.
  Meantime Olson cut off the long neck, saying that it would make fine soup. By
  the time we had cleared away the blood and refuse in the tower, the cook had
  juicy steaks and a steaming broth upon the electric stove, and the aroma
  arising from <i>P. Olsoni</i> filled us all with a hitherto unfelt admiration
  for him and all his kind.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="Caspak1-5"
     id="Caspak1-5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE steaks we had that night, and they were fine; and the
  following morning we tasted the broth. It seemed odd to be eating a creature
  that should, by all the laws of paleontology, have been extinct for several
  million years. It gave one a feeling of newness that was almost embarrassing,
  although it didn't seem to embarrass our appetites. Olson ate until I thought
  he would burst.</p>

  <p>The girl ate with us that night at the little officers' mess just back of
  the torpedo compartment. The narrow table was unfolded; the four stools were
  set out; and for the first time in days we sat down to eat, and for the first
  time in weeks we had something to eat other than the monotony of the short
  rations of an impoverished U-boat. Nobs sat between the girl and me and was
  fed with morsels of the Plesiosaurus steak, at the risk of forever
  contaminating his manners. He looked at me sheepishly all the time, for he
  knew that no well-bred dog should eat at table; but the poor fellow was so
  wasted from improper food that I couldn't enjoy my own meal had he been
  denied an immediate share in it; and anyway Lys wanted to feed him. So there
  you are.</p>

  <p>Lys was coldly polite to me and sweetly gracious to Bradley and Olson. She
  wasn't of the gushing type, I knew; so I didn't expect much from her and was
  duly grateful for the few morsels of attention she threw upon the floor to
  me. We had a pleasant meal, with only one unfortunate occurrence&mdash;when
  Olson suggested that possibly the creature we were eating was the same one
  that ate the German. It was some time before we could persuade the girl to
  continue her meal, but at last Bradley prevailed upon her, pointing out that
  we had come upstream nearly forty miles since the Boche had been seized, and
  that during that time we had seen literally thousands of these denizens of
  the river, indicating that the chances were very remote that this was the
  same Plesiosaur. "And anyway," he concluded, "it was only a scheme of Mr.
  Olson's to get all the steaks for himself."</p>

  <p>We discussed the future and ventured opinions as to what lay before us;
  but we could only theorize at best, for none of us knew. If the whole land
  was infested by these and similar horrid monsters, life would be impossible
  upon it, and we decided that we would only search long enough to find and
  take aboard fresh water and such meat and fruits as might be safely
  procurable and then retrace our way beneath the cliffs to the open sea.</p>

  <p>And so at last we turned into our narrow bunks, hopeful, happy and at
  peace with ourselves, our lives and our God, to awaken the following morning
  refreshed and still optimistic. We had an easy time getting away&mdash;as we
  learned later, because the saurians do not commence to feed until late in the
  morning. From noon to midnight their curve of activity is at its height,
  while from dawn to about nine o'clock it is lowest. As a matter of fact, we
  didn't see one of them all the time we were getting under way, though I had
  the cannon raised to the deck and manned against an assault. I hoped, but I
  was none too sure, that shells might discourage them. The trees were full of
  monkeys of all sizes and shades, and once we thought we saw a manlike
  creature watching us from the depth of the forest.</p>

  <p>Shortly after we resumed our course upstream, we saw the mouth of another
  and smaller river emptying into the main channel from the south&mdash;that
  is, upon our right; and almost immediately after we came upon a large island
  five or six miles in length; and at fifty miles there was a still larger
  river than the last coming in from the northwest, the course of the main
  stream having now changed to northeast by southwest. The water was quite free
  from reptiles, and the vegetation upon the banks of the river had altered to
  more open and parklike forest, with eucalyptus and acacia mingled with a
  scattering of tree ferns, as though two distinct periods of geologic time had
  overlapped and merged. The grass, too, was less flowering, though there were
  still gorgeous patches mottling the greensward; and lastly, the fauna was
  less multitudinous.</p>

  <p>Six or seven miles farther, and the river widened considerably; before us
  opened an expanse of water to the farther horizon, and then we sailed out
  upon an inland sea so large that only a shore-line upon our side was visible
  to us. The waters all about us were alive with life. There were still a few
  reptiles; but there were fish by the thousands, by the millions.</p>

  <p>The water of the inland sea was very warm, almost hot, and the atmosphere
  was hot and heavy above it. It seemed strange that beyond the buttressed
  walls of Caprona icebergs floated and the south wind was biting, for only a
  gentle breeze moved across the face of these living waters, and that was damp
  and warm. Gradually, we commenced to divest ourselves of our clothing,
  retaining only sufficient for modesty; but the sun was not hot. It was more
  the heat of a steam-room than of an oven.</p>

  <p>We coasted up the shore of the lake in a north-westerly direction,
  sounding all the time. We found the lake deep and the bottom rocky and
  steeply shelving toward the center, and once when I moved straight out from
  shore to take other soundings we could find no bottom whatsoever. In open
  spaces along the shore we caught occasional glimpses of the distant cliffs,
  and here they appeared only a trifle less precipitous than those which bound
  Caprona on the seaward side. My theory is that in a far distant era Caprona
  was a mighty mountain&mdash;perhaps the world's mightiest volcanic action
  blew off the entire crest, blew thousands of feet of the mountain upward and
  outward and onto the surrounding continent, leaving a great crater; and then,
  possibly, the continent sank as ancient continents have been known to do,
  leaving only the summit of Caprona above the sea. The encircling walls, the
  central lake, the hot springs which feed the lake, all point to a conclusion,
  and the fauna and the flora bear indisputable evidence that Caprona was once
  part of some great land-mass.</p>

  <p>As we cruised up along the coast, the landscape continued a more or less
  open forest, with here and there a small plain where we saw animals grazing.
  With my glass I could make out a species of large red deer, some antelope and
  what appeared to be a species of horse; and once I saw the shaggy form of
  what might have been a monstrous bison. Here was game a plenty! There seemed
  little danger of starving upon Caprona. The game, however, seemed wary; for
  the instant the animals discovered us, they threw up their heads and tails
  and went cavorting off, those farther inland following the example of the
  others until all were lost in the mazes of the distant forest. Only the
  great, shaggy ox stood his ground. With lowered head he watched us until we
  had passed, and then continued feeding.</p>

  <p>About twenty miles up the coast from the mouth of the river we encountered
  low cliffs of sandstone, broken and tortured evidence of the great upheaval
  which had torn Caprona asunder in the past, intermingling upon a common level
  the rock formations of widely separated eras, fusing some and leaving others
  untouched.</p>

  <p>We ran along beside them for a matter of ten miles, arriving off a broad
  cleft which led into what appeared to be another lake. As we were in search
  of pure water, we did not wish to overlook any portion of the coast, and so
  after sounding and finding that we had ample depth, I ran the <i>U-33</i>
  between head-lands into as pretty a landlocked harbor as sailormen could care
  to see, with good water right up to within a few yards of the shore. As we
  cruised slowly along, two of the Boches again saw what they believed to be a
  man, or manlike creature, watching us from a fringe of trees a hundred yards
  inland, and shortly after we discovered the mouth of a small stream emptying
  into the bay. It was the first stream we had found since leaving the river,
  and I at once made preparations to test its water. To land, it would be
  necessary to run the <i>U-33</i> close in to the shore, at least as close as
  we could, for even these waters were infested, though, not so thickly, by
  savage reptiles. I ordered sufficient water let into the diving-tanks to
  lower us about a foot, and then I ran the bow slowly toward the shore,
  confident that should we run aground, we still had sufficient lifting force
  to free us when the water should be pumped out of the tanks; but the bow
  nosed its way gently into the reeds and touched the shore with the keel still
  clear.</p>

  <p>My men were all armed now with both rifles and pistols, each having plenty
  of ammunition. I ordered one of the Germans ashore with a line, and sent two
  of my own men to guard him, for from what little we had seen of Caprona, or
  Caspak as we learned later to call the interior, we realized that any instant
  some new and terrible danger might confront us. The line was made fast to a
  small tree, and at the same time I had the stern anchor dropped.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Boche and his guard were aboard again, I called all hands
  on deck, including von Schoenvorts, and there I explained to them that the
  time had come for us to enter into some sort of an agreement among ourselves
  that would relieve us of the annoyance and embarrassment of being divided
  into two antagonistic parts&mdash;prisoners and captors. I told them that it
  was obvious our very existence depended upon our unity of action, that we
  were to all intent and purpose entering a new world as far from the seat and
  causes of our own world-war as if millions of miles of space and aeons of
  time separated us from our past lives and habitations.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why we should carry our racial and political hatreds
  into Caprona," I insisted. "The Germans among us might kill all the English,
  or the English might kill the last German, without affecting in the slightest
  degree either the outcome of even the smallest skirmish upon the western
  front or the opinion of a single individual in any belligerent or neutral
  country. I therefore put the issue squarely to you all; shall we bury our
  animosities and work together with and for one another while we remain upon
  Caprona, or must we continue thus divided and but half armed, possibly until
  death has claimed the last of us? And let me tell you, if you have not
  already realized it, the chances are a thousand to one that not one of us
  ever will see the outside world again. We are safe now in the matter of food
  and water; we could provision the <i>U-33</i> for a long cruise; but we are
  practically out of fuel, and without fuel we cannot hope to reach the ocean,
  as only a submarine can pass through the barrier cliffs. What is your
  answer?" I turned toward von Schoenvorts.</p>

  <p>He eyed me in that disagreeable way of his and demanded to know, in case
  they accepted my suggestion, what their status would be in event of our
  finding a way to escape with the <i>U-33</i>. I replied that I felt that if
  we had all worked loyally together we should leave Caprona upon a common
  footing, and to that end I suggested that should the remote possibility of
  our escape in the submarine develop into reality, we should then immediately
  make for the nearest neutral port and give ourselves into the hands of the
  authorities, when we should all probably be interned for the duration of the
  war. To my surprise he agreed that this was fair and told me that they would
  accept my conditions and that I could depend upon their loyalty to the common
  cause.</p>

  <p>I thanked him and then addressed each one of his men individually, and
  each gave me his word that he would abide by all that I had outlined. It was
  further understood that we were to act as a military organization under
  military rules and discipline&mdash;I as commander, with Bradley as my first
  lieutenant and Olson as my second, in command of the Englishmen; while von
  Schoenvorts was to act as an additional second lieutenant and have charge of
  his own men. The four of us were to constitute a military court under which
  men might be tried and sentenced to punishment for infraction of military
  rules and discipline, even to the passing of the death-sentence.</p>

  <p>I then had arms and ammunition issued to the Germans, and leaving Bradley
  and five men to guard the <i>U-33</i>, the balance of us went ashore. The
  first thing we did was to taste the water of the little stream&mdash;which,
  to our delight, we found sweet, pure and cold. This stream was entirely free
  from dangerous reptiles, because, as I later discovered, they became
  immediately dormant when subjected to a much lower temperature than 70
  degrees Fahrenheit. They dislike cold water and keep as far away from it as
  possible. There were countless brook-trout here, and deep holes that invited
  us to bathe, and along the bank of the stream were trees bearing a close
  resemblance to ash and beech and oak, their characteristics evidently induced
  by the lower temperature of the air above the cold water and by the fact that
  their roots were watered by the water from the stream rather than from the
  warm springs which we afterward found in such abundance elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Our first concern was to fill the water tanks of the <i>U-33</i> with
  fresh water, and that having been accomplished, we set out to hunt for game
  and explore inland for a short distance. Olson, von Schoenvorts, two
  Englishmen and two Germans accompanied me, leaving ten to guard the ship and
  the girl. I had intended leaving Nobs behind, but he got away and joined me
  and was so happy over it that I hadn't the heart to send him back. We
  followed the stream upward through a beautiful country for about five miles,
  and then came upon its source in a little boulder-strewn clearing. From among
  the rocks bubbled fully twenty ice-cold springs. North of the clearing rose
  sandstone cliffs to a height of some fifty to seventy-five feet, with tall
  trees growing at their base and almost concealing them from our view. To the
  west the country was flat and sparsely wooded, and here it was that we saw
  our first game&mdash;a large red deer. It was grazing away from us and had
  not seen us when one of my men called my attention to it. Motioning for
  silence and having the rest of the party lie down, I crept toward the quarry,
  accompanied only by Whitely. We got within a hundred yards of the deer when
  he suddenly raised his antlered head and pricked up his great ears. We both
  fired at once and had the satisfaction of seeing the buck drop; then we ran
  forward to finish him with our knives. The deer lay in a small open space
  close to a clump of acacias, and we had advanced to within several yards of
  our kill when we both halted suddenly and simultaneously. Whitely looked at
  me, and I looked at Whitely, and then we both looked back in the direction of
  the deer. "Blimey!' he said. "Wot is hit, sir?"</p>

  <p>"It looks to me, Whitely, like an error," I said; "some assistant god who
  had been creating elephants must have been temporarily transferred to the
  lizard-department."</p>

  <p>"Hi wouldn't s'y that, sir," said Whitely; "it sounds blasphemous."</p>

  <p>"It is more blasphemous than that thing which is swiping our meat," I
  replied, for whatever the thing was, it had leaped upon our deer and was
  devouring it in great mouthfuls which it swallowed without mastication. The
  creature appeared to be a great lizard at least ten feet high, with a huge,
  powerful tail as long as its torso, mighty hind legs and short forelegs. When
  it had advanced from the wood, it hopped much after the fashion of a
  kangaroo, using its hind feet and tail to propel it, and when it stood erect,
  it sat upon its tail. Its head was long and thick, with a blunt muzzle, and
  the opening of the jaws ran back to a point behind the eyes, and the jaws
  were armed with long sharp teeth. The scaly body was covered with black and
  yellow spots about a foot in diameter and irregular in contour. These spots
  were outlined in red with edgings about an inch wide. The underside of the
  chest, body and tail were a greenish white.</p>

  <p>"Wot s'y we pot the bloomin' bird, sir?" suggested Whitely.</p>

  <p>I told him to wait until I gave the word; then we would fire
  simultaneously, he at the heart and I at the spine.</p>

  <p>"Hat the 'eart, sir&mdash;yes, sir," he replied, and raised his piece to
  his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Our shots rang out together. The thing raised its head and looked about
  until its eyes rested upon us; then it gave vent to a most appalling hiss
  that rose to the crescendo of a terrific shriek and came for us.</p>

  <p>"Beat it, Whitely!" I cried as I turned to run.</p>

  <p>We were about a quarter of a mile from the rest of our party, and in full
  sight of them as they lay in the tall grass watching us. That they saw all
  that had happened was evidenced by the fact that they now rose and ran toward
  us, and at their head leaped Nobs. The creature in our rear was gaining on us
  rapidly when Nobs flew past me like a meteor and rushed straight for the
  frightful reptile. I tried to recall him, but he would pay no attention to
  me, and as I couldn't see him sacrificed, I, too, stopped and faced the
  monster. The creature appeared to be more impressed with Nobs than by us and
  our firearms, for it stopped as the Airedale dashed at it growling, and
  struck at him viciously with its powerful jaws.</p>

  <p>Nobs, though, was lightning by comparison with the slow thinking beast and
  dodged his opponent's thrust with ease. Then he raced to the rear of the
  tremendous thing and seized it by the tail. There Nobs made the error of his
  life. Within that mottled organ were the muscles of a Titan, the force of a
  dozen mighty catapults, and the owner of the tail was fully aware of the
  possibilities which it contained. With a single flip of the tip it sent poor
  Nobs sailing through the air a hundred feet above the ground, straight back
  into the clump of acacias from which the beast had leaped upon our kill -and
  then the grotesque thing sank lifeless to the ground.</p>

  <p>Olson and von Schoenvorts came up a minute later with their men; then we
  all cautiously approached the still form upon the ground. The creature was
  quite dead, and an examination resulted in disclosing the fact that Whitely's
  bullet had pierced its heart, and mine had severed the spinal cord.</p>

  <p>"But why didn't it die instantly?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Because," said von Schoenvorts in his disagreeable way, "the beast is so
  large, and its nervous organization of so low a caliber, that it took all
  this time for the intelligence of death to reach and be impressed upon the
  minute brain. The thing was dead when your bullets struck it; but it did not
  know it for several seconds&mdash;possibly a minute. If I am not mistaken, it
  is an Allosaurus of the Upper Jurassic, remains of which have been found in
  Central Wyoming, in the suburbs of New York."</p>

  <p>An Irishman by the name of Brady grinned. I afterward learned that he had
  served three years on the traffic-squad of the Chicago police force.</p>

  <p>I had been calling Nobs in the meantime and was about to set out in search
  of him, fearing, to tell the truth, to do so lest I find him mangled and dead
  among the trees of the acacia grove, when he suddenly emerged from among the
  boles, his ears flattened, his tail between his legs and his body screwed
  into a suppliant S. He was unharmed except for minor bruises; but he was the
  most chastened dog I have ever seen.</p>

  <p>We gathered up what was left of the red deer after skinning and cleaning
  it, and set out upon our return journey toward the U-boat. On the way Olson,
  von Schoenvorts and I discussed the needs of our immediate future, and we
  were unanimous in placing foremost the necessity of a permanent camp on
  shore. The interior of a U-boat is about as impossible and uncomfortable an
  abiding-place as one can well imagine, and in this warm climate, and in warm
  water, it was almost unendurable. So we decided to construct a palisaded
  camp.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="Caspak1-6"
     id="Caspak1-6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS we strolled slowly back toward the boat, planning and
  discussing this, we were suddenly startled by a loud and unmistakable
  detonation.</p>

  <p>"A shell from the <i>U-33</i>!" exclaimed von Schoenvorts.</p>

  <p>"What can be after signifyin'?" queried Olson.</p>

  <p>"They are in trouble," I answered for all, "and it's up to us to get back
  to them. Drop that carcass," I directed the men carrying the meat, "and
  follow me!" I set off at a rapid run in the direction of the harbor.</p>

  <p>We ran for the better part of a mile without hearing anything more from
  the direction of the harbor, and then I reduced the speed to a walk, for the
  exercise was telling on us who had been cooped up for so long in the confined
  interior of the <i>U-33</i>. Puffing and panting, we plodded on until within
  about a mile of the harbor we came upon a sight that brought us all up
  standing. We had been passing through a little heavier timber than was usual
  to this part of the country, when we suddenly emerged into an open space in
  the center of which was such a band as might have caused the most courageous
  to pause. It consisted of upward of five hundred individuals representing
  several species closely allied to man. There were anthropoid apes and
  gorillas&mdash;these I had no difficulty in recognizing; but there were other
  forms which I had never before seen, and I was hard put to it to say whether
  they were ape or man. Some of them resembled the corpse we had found upon the
  narrow beach against Caprona's sea-wall, while others were of a still lower
  type, more nearly resembling the apes, and yet others were uncannily manlike,
  standing there erect, being less hairy and possessing better shaped
  heads.</p>

  <p>There was one among the lot, evidently the leader of them, who bore a
  close resemblance to the so-called Neanderthal man of La Chapelle-aux-Saints.
  There was the same short, stocky trunk upon which rested an enormous head
  habitually bent forward into the same curvature as the back, the arms shorter
  than the legs, and the lower leg considerably shorter than that of modern
  man, the knees bent forward and never straightened. This creature and one or
  two others who appeared to be of a lower order than he, yet higher than that
  of the apes, carried heavy clubs; the others were armed only with giant
  muscles and fighting fangs&mdash;nature's weapons. All were males, and all
  were entirely naked; nor was there upon even the highest among them a sign of
  ornamentation.</p>

  <p>At sight of us they turned with bared fangs and low growls to confront us.
  I did not wish to fire among them unless it became absolutely necessary, and
  so I started to lead my party around them; but the instant that the
  Neanderthal man guessed my intention, he evidently attributed it to cowardice
  upon our part, and with a wild cry he leaped toward us, waving his cudgel
  above his head. The others followed him, and in a minute we should have been
  overwhelmed. I gave the order to fire, and at the first volley six of them
  went down, including the Neanderthal man. The others hesitated a moment and
  then broke for the trees, some running nimbly among the branches, while
  others lost themselves to us between the boles. Both von Schoenvorts and I
  noticed that at least two of the higher, manlike types took to the trees
  quite as nimbly as the apes, while others that more nearly approached man in
  carriage and appearance sought safety upon the ground with the gorillas.</p>

  <p>An examination disclosed that five of our erstwhile opponents were dead
  and the sixth, the Neanderthal man, was but slightly wounded, a bullet having
  glanced from his thick skull, stunning him. We decided to take him with us to
  camp, and by means of belts we managed to secure his hands behind his back
  and place a leash around his neck before he regained consciousness. We then
  retraced our steps for our meat being convinced by our own experience that
  those aboard the <i>U-33</i> had been able to frighten off this party with a
  single shell&mdash;but when we came to where we had left the deer it had
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>On the return journey Whitely and I preceded the rest of the party by
  about a hundred yards in the hope of getting another shot at something
  edible, for we were all greatly disgusted and disappointed by the loss of our
  venison. Whitely and I advanced very cautiously, and not having the whole
  party with us, we fared better than on the journey out, bagging two large
  antelope not a half-mile from the harbor; so with our game and our prisoner
  we made a cheerful return to the boat, where we found that all were safe. On
  the shore a little north of where we lay there were the corpses of twenty of
  the wild creatures who had attacked Bradley and his party in our absence, and
  the rest of whom we had met and scattered a few minutes later.</p>

  <p>We felt that we had taught these wild ape-men a lesson and that because of
  it we would be safer in the future&mdash;at least safer from them; but we
  decided not to abate our carefulness one whit; feeling that this new world
  was filled with terrors still unknown to us; nor were we wrong.</p>

  <p>The following morning we commenced work upon our camp, Bradley, Olson, von
  Schoenvorts, Miss La Rue, and I having sat up half the night discussing the
  matter and drawing plans. We set the men at work felling trees, selecting for
  the purpose jarrah, a hard, weather-resisting timber which grew in profusion
  near by. Half the men labored while the other half stood guard, alternating
  each hour with an hour off at noon. Olson directed this work. Bradley, von
  Schoenvorts and I, with Miss La Rue's help, staked out the various buildings
  and the outer wall. When the day was done, we had quite an array of logs
  nicely notched and ready for our building operations on the morrow, and we
  were all tired, for after the buildings had been staked out we all fell in
  and helped with the logging&mdash;all but von Schoenvorts. He, being a
  Prussian and a gentleman, couldn't stoop to such menial labor in the presence
  of his men, and I didn't see fit to ask it of him, as the work was purely
  voluntary upon our part. He spent the afternoon shaping a swagger-stick from
  the branch of jarrah and talking with Miss La Rue, who had sufficiently
  unbent toward him to notice his existence.</p>

  <p>We saw nothing of the wild men of the previous day, and only once were we
  menaced by any of the strange denizens of Caprona, when some frightful
  nightmare of the sky swooped down upon us, only to be driven off by a
  fusillade of bullets. The thing appeared to be some variety of pterodactyl,
  and what with its enormous size and ferocious aspect was most awe-inspiring.
  There was another incident, too, which to me at least was far more unpleasant
  than the sudden onslaught of the prehistoric reptile. Two of the men, both
  Germans, were stripping a felled tree of its branches. Von Schoenvorts had
  completed his swagger-stick, and he and I were passing close to where the two
  worked.</p>

  <p>One of them threw to his rear a small branch that he had just chopped off,
  and as misfortune would have it, it struck von Schoenvorts across the face.
  It couldn't have hurt him, for it didn't leave a mark; but he flew into a
  terrific rage, shouting: "Attention!" in a loud voice. The sailor immediately
  straightened up, faced his officer, clicked his heels together and saluted.
  "Pig!" roared the Baron, and struck the fellow across the face, breaking his
  nose. I grabbed von Schoenvorts' arm and jerked him away before he could
  strike again, if such had been his intention, and then he raised his little
  stick to strike me; but before it descended the muzzle of my pistol was
  against his belly and he must have seen in my eyes that nothing would suit me
  better than an excuse to pull the trigger. Like all his kind and all other
  bullies, von Schoenvorts was a coward at heart, and so he dropped his hand to
  his side and started to turn away; but I pulled him back, and there before
  his men I told him that such a thing must never again occur&mdash;that no man
  was to be struck or otherwise punished other than in due process of the laws
  that we had made and the court that we had established. All the time the
  sailor stood rigidly at attention, nor could I tell from his expression
  whether he most resented the blow his officer had struck him or my
  interference in the gospel of the Kaiser-breed. Nor did he move until I said
  to him: "Plesser, you may return to your quarters and dress your wound." Then
  he saluted and marched stiffly off toward the <i>U-33</i>.</p>

  <p>Just before dusk we moved out into the bay a hundred yards from shore and
  dropped anchor, for I felt that we should be safer there than elsewhere. I
  also detailed men to stand watch during the night and appointed Olson officer
  of the watch for the entire night, telling him to bring his blankets on deck
  and get what rest he could. At dinner we tasted our first roast Caprona
  antelope, and we had a mess of greens that the cook had found growing along
  the stream. All during the meal von Schoenvorts was silent and surly.</p>

  <p>After dinner we all went on deck and watched the unfamiliar scenes of a
  Capronian night&mdash;that is, all but von Schoenvorts. There was less to see
  than to hear. From the great inland lake behind us came the hissing and the
  screaming of countless saurians. Above us we heard the flap of giant wings,
  while from the shore rose the multitudinous voices of a tropical
  jungle&mdash;of a warm, damp atmosphere such as must have enveloped the
  entire earth during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. But here were
  intermingled the voices of later eras&mdash;the scream of the panther, the
  roar of the lion, the baying of wolves and a thunderous growling which we
  could attribute to nothing earthly but which one day we were to connect with
  the most fearsome of ancient creatures.</p>

  <p>One by one the others went to their rooms, until the girl and I were left
  alone together, for I had permitted the watch to go below for a few minutes,
  knowing that I would be on deck. Miss La Rue was very quiet, though she
  replied graciously enough to whatever I had to say that required reply. I
  asked her if she did not feel well.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "but I am depressed by the awfulness of it all. I feel of
  so little consequence&mdash;so small and helpless in the face of all these
  myriad manifestations of life stripped to the bone of its savagery and
  brutality. I realize as never before how cheap and valueless a thing is life.
  Life seems a joke, a cruel, grim joke. You are a laughable incident or a
  terrifying one as you happen to be less powerful or more powerful than some
  other form of life which crosses your path; but as a rule you are of no
  moment whatsoever to anything but yourself. You are a comic little figure,
  hopping from the cradle to the grave. Yes, that is our trouble&mdash;we take
  ourselves too seriously; but Caprona should be a sure cure for that." She
  paused and laughed.</p>

  <p>"You have evolved a beautiful philosophy," I said. "It fills such a
  longing in the human breast. It is full, it is satisfying, it is ennobling.
  What wondrous strides toward perfection the human race might have made if the
  first man had evolved it and it had persisted until now as the creed of
  humanity."</p>

  <p>"I don't like irony," she said; "it indicates a small soul."</p>

  <p>"What other sort of soul, then, would you expect from `a comic little
  figure hopping from the cradle to the grave'?" I inquired. "And what
  difference does it make, anyway, what you like and what you don't like? You
  are here for but an instant, and you mustn't take yourself too
  seriously."</p>

  <p>She looked up at me with a smile. "I imagine that I am frightened and
  blue," she said, "and I know that I am very, very homesick and lonely." There
  was almost a sob in her voice as she concluded. It was the first time that
  she had spoken thus to me. Involuntarily, I laid my hand upon hers where it
  rested on the rail.</p>

  <p>"I know how difficult your position is," I said; "but don't feel that you
  are alone. There is&mdash;is one here who&mdash;who would do anything in the
  world for you," I ended lamely. She did not withdraw her hand, and she looked
  up into my face with tears on her cheeks and I read in her eyes the thanks
  her lips could not voice. Then she looked away across the weird moonlit
  landscape and sighed. Evidently her new-found philosophy had tumbled about
  her ears, for she was seemingly taking herself seriously. I wanted to take
  her in my arms and tell her how I loved her, and had taken her hand from the
  rail and started to draw her toward me when Olson came blundering up on deck
  with his bedding.</p>

  <p>The following morning we started building operations in earnest, and
  things progressed finely. The Neanderthal man was something of a care, for we
  had to keep him in irons all the time, and he was mighty savage when
  approached; but after a time he became more docile, and then we tried to
  discover if he had a language. Lys spent a great deal of time talking to him
  and trying to draw him out; but for a long while she was unsuccessful. It
  took us three weeks to build all the houses, which we constructed close by a
  cold spring some two miles from the harbor.</p>

  <p>We changed our plans a trifle when it came to building the palisade, for
  we found a rotted cliff near by where we could get all the flat
  building-stone we needed, and so we constructed a stone wall entirely around
  the buildings. It was in the form of a square, with bastions and towers at
  each corner which would permit an enfilading fire along any side of the fort,
  and was about one hundred and thirty-five feet square on the outside, with
  walls three feet thick at the bottom and about a foot and a half wide at the
  top, and fifteen feet high. It took a long time to build that wall, and we
  all turned in and helped except von Schoenvorts, who, by the way, had not
  spoken to me except in the line of official business since our encounter
  &mdash;a condition of armed neutrality which suited me to a T. We have just
  finished it, the last touches being put on today. I quit about a week ago and
  commenced working on this chronicle for our strange adventures, which will
  account for any minor errors in chronology which may have crept in; there was
  so much material that I may have made some mistakes, but I think they are but
  minor and few.</p>

  <p>I see in reading over the last few pages that I neglected to state that
  Lys finally discovered that the Neanderthal man possessed a language. She had
  learned to speak it, and so have I, to some extent. It was he&mdash;his name
  he says is Am, or Ahm&mdash;who told us that this country is called Caspak.
  When we asked him how far it extended, he waved both arms about his head in
  an all-including gesture which took in, apparently, the entire universe. He
  is more tractable now, and we are going to release him, for he has assured us
  that he will not permit his fellows to harm us. He calls us Galus and says
  that in a short time he will be a Galu. It is not quite clear to us what he
  means. He says that there are many Galus north of us, and that as soon as he
  becomes one he will go and live with them.</p>

  <p>Ahm went out to hunt with us yesterday and was much impressed by the ease
  with which our rifles brought down antelopes and deer. We have been living
  upon the fat of the land, Ahm, having shown us the edible fruits, tubers and
  herbs, and twice a week we go out after fresh meat. A certain proportion of
  this we dry and store away, for we do not know what may come. Our drying
  process is really smoking. We have also dried a large quantity of two
  varieties of cereal which grow wild a few miles south of us. One of these is
  a giant Indian maize&mdash;a lofty perennial often fifty and sixty feet in
  height, with ears the size off a man's body and kernels as large as your
  fist. We have had to construct a second store house for the great quantity of
  this that we have gathered.</p>

  <p><br>
  <span class="smcap">September 3, 1916</span>: Three months ago today the
  torpedo from the <i>U-33</i> started me from the peaceful deck of the
  American liner upon the strange voyage which has ended here in Caspak. We
  have settled down to an acceptance of our fate, for all are convinced that
  none of us will ever see the outer world again. Ahm's repeated assertions
  that there are human beings like ourselves in Caspak have roused the men to a
  keen desire for exploration. I sent out one party last week under Bradley.
  Ahm, who is now free to go and come as he wishes, accompanied them. They
  marched about twenty-five miles due west, encountering many terrible beasts
  and reptiles and not a few manlike creatures whom Ahm sent away. Here is
  Bradley's report of the expedition:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Marched fifteen miles the first day, camping on the bank of
  a large stream which runs southward. Game was plentiful and we saw several
  varieties which we had not before encountered in Caspak. Just before making
  camp we were charged by an enormous woolly rhinoceros, which Plesser dropped
  with a perfect shot. We had rhinoceros-steaks for supper. Ahm called the
  thing "Atis." It was almost a continuous battle from the time we left the
  fort until we arrived at camp. The mind of man can scarce conceive the
  plethora of carnivorous life in this lost world; and their prey, of course,
  is even more abundant.</p>

  <p class="quote">The second day we marched about ten miles to the foot of the
  cliffs. Passed through dense forests close to the base of the cliffs. Saw
  manlike creatures and a low order of ape in one band, and some of the men
  swore that there was a white man among them. They were inclined to attack us
  at first; but a volley from our rifles caused them to change their minds. We
  scaled the cliffs as far as we could; but near the top they are absolutely
  perpendicular without any sufficient cleft or protuberance to give hand or
  foot-hold. All were disappointed, for we hungered for a view of the ocean and
  the outside world. We even had a hope that we might see and attract the
  attention of a passing ship. Our exploration has determined one thing which
  will probably be of little value to us and never heard of beyond Caprona's
  walls&mdash;this crater was once entirely filled with water. Indisputable
  evidence of this is on the face of the cliffs.</p>

  <p class="quote">Our return journey occupied two days and was as filled with
  adventure as usual. We are all becoming accustomed to adventure. It is
  beginning to pall on us. We suffered no casualties and there was no
  illness.</p>

  <p><br>
  I had to smile as I read Bradley's report. In those four days he had
  doubtless passed through more adventures than an African big-game hunter
  experiences in a lifetime, and yet he covered it all in a few lines. Yes, we
  are becoming accustomed to adventure. Not a day passes that one or more of us
  does not face death at least once. Ahm taught us a few things that have
  proved profitable and saved us much ammunition, which it is useless to expend
  except for food or in the last recourse of self-preservation. Now when we are
  attacked by large flying reptiles we run beneath spreading trees; when land
  carnivora threaten us, we climb into trees, and we have learned not to fire
  at any of the dinosaurs unless we can keep out of their reach for at least
  two minutes after hitting them in the brain or spine, or five minutes after
  puncturing their hearts&mdash;it takes them so long to die. To hit them
  elsewhere is worse than useless, for they do not seem to notice it, and we
  had discovered that such shots do not kill or even disable them.</p>

  <p><br>
  <span class="smcap">September 7, 1916</span>: Much has happened since I last
  wrote. Bradley is away again on another exploration expedition to the cliffs.
  He expects to be gone several weeks and to follow along their base in search
  of a point where they may be scaled. He took Sinclair, Brady, James, and
  Tippet with him. Ahm has disappeared. He has been gone about three days; but
  the most startling thing I have on record is that von Schoenvorts and Olson
  while out hunting the other day discovered oil about fifteen miles north of
  us beyond the sandstone cliffs. Olson says there is a geyser of oil there,
  and von Schoenvorts is making preparations to refine it. If he succeeds, we
  shall have the means for leaving Caspak and returning to our own world. I can
  scarce believe the truth of it. We are all elated to the seventh heaven of
  bliss. Pray God we shall not be disappointed.</p>

  <p>I have tried on several occasions to broach the subject of my love to Lys;
  but she will not listen.</p>

  <h2><a name="Caspak1-7"
     id="Caspak1-7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first"><span class="smcap">October 8, 1916</span>: This is the last
  entry I shall make upon my manuscript. When this is done, I shall be through.
  Though I may pray that it reaches the haunts of civilized man, my better
  judgment tells me that it will never be perused by other eyes than mine, and
  that even though it should, it would be too late to avail me. I am alone upon
  the summit of the great cliff overlooking the broad Pacific. A chill south
  wind bites at my marrow, while far below me I can see the tropic foliage of
  Caspak on the one hand and huge icebergs from the near Antarctic upon the
  other. Presently I shall stuff my folded manuscript into the thermos bottle I
  have carried with me for the purpose since I left the fort&mdash;Fort
  Dinosaur we named it&mdash;and hurl it far outward over the cliff-top into
  the Pacific. What current washes the shore of Caprona I know not; whither my
  bottle will be borne I cannot even guess; but I have done all that mortal man
  may do to notify the world of my whereabouts and the dangers that threaten
  those of us who remain alive in Caspak&mdash;if there be any other than
  myself.</p>

  <p>About the 8th of September I accompanied Olson and von Schoenvorts to the
  oil-geyser. Lys came with us, and we took a number of things which von
  Schoenvorts wanted for the purpose of erecting a crude refinery. We went up
  the coast some ten or twelve miles in the <i>U-33</i>, tying up to shore near
  the mouth of a small stream which emptied great volumes of crude oil into the
  sea &mdash;I find it difficult to call this great lake by any other name.
  Then we disembarked and went inland about five miles, where we came upon a
  small lake entirely filled with oil, from the center of which a geyser of oil
  spouted.</p>

  <p>On the edge of the lake we helped von Schoenvorts build his primitive
  refinery. We worked with him for two days until he got things fairly well
  started, and then we returned to Fort Dinosaur, as I feared that Bradley
  might return and be worried by our absence. The <i>U-33</i> merely landed
  those of us that were to return to the fort and then retraced its course
  toward the oil-well. Olson, Whitely, Wilson, Miss La Rue, and myself
  disembarked, while von Schoenvorts and his German crew returned to refine the
  oil. The next day Plesser and two other Germans came down overland for
  ammunition. Plesser said they had been attacked by wild men and had exhausted
  a great deal of ammunition. He also asked permission to get some dried meat
  and maize, saying that they were so busy with the work of refining that they
  had no time to hunt. I let him have everything he asked for, and never once
  did a suspicion of their intentions enter my mind. They returned to the
  oil-well the same day, while we continued with the multitudinous duties of
  camp life.</p>

  <p>For three days nothing of moment occurred. Bradley did not return; nor did
  we have any word from von Schoenvorts. In the evening Lys and I went up into
  one of the bastion towers and listened to the grim and terrible nightlife of
  the frightful ages of the past. Once a saber-tooth screamed almost beneath
  us, and the girl shrank close against me. As I felt her body against mine,
  all the pent love of these three long months shattered the bonds of timidity
  and conviction, and I swept her up into my arms and covered her face and lips
  with kisses. She did not struggle to free herself; but instead her dear arms
  crept up about my neck and drew my own face even closer to hers.</p>

  <p>"You love me, Lys?" I cried.</p>

  <p>I felt her head nod an affirmative against my breast. "Tell me, Lys," I
  begged, "tell me in words how much you love me."</p>

  <p>Low and sweet and tender came the answer: "I love you beyond all
  conception."</p>

  <p>My heart filled with rapture then, and it fills now as it has each of the
  countless times I have recalled those dear words, as it shall fill always
  until death has claimed me. I may never see her again; she may not know how I
  love her&mdash;she may question, she may doubt; but always true and steady,
  and warm with the fires of love my heart beats for the girl who said that
  night: "I love you beyond all conception."</p>

  <p>For a long time we sat there upon the little bench constructed for the
  sentry that we had not as yet thought it necessary to post in more than one
  of the four towers. We learned to know one another better in those two brief
  hours than we had in all the months that had intervened since we had been
  thrown together. She told me that she had loved me from the first, and that
  she never had loved von Schoenvorts, their engagement having been arranged by
  her aunt for social reasons.</p>

  <p>That was the happiest evening of my life; nor ever do I expect to
  experience its like; but at last, as is the way of happiness, it terminated.
  We descended to the compound, and I walked with Lys to the door of her
  quarters. There again she kissed me and bade me good night, and then she went
  in and closed the door.</p>

  <p>I went to my own room, and there I sat by the light of one of the crude
  candles we had made from the tallow of the beasts we had killed, and lived
  over the events of the evening. At last I turned in and fell asleep, dreaming
  happy dreams and planning for the future, for even in savage Caspak I was
  bound to make my girl safe and happy. It was daylight when I awoke. Wilson,
  who was acting as cook, was up and astir at his duties in the cook-house. The
  others slept; but I arose and followed by Nobs went down to the stream for a
  plunge. As was our custom, I went armed with both rifle and revolver; but I
  stripped and had my swim without further disturbance than the approach of a
  large hyena, a number of which occupied caves in the sand-stone cliffs north
  of the camp. These brutes are enormous and exceedingly ferocious. I imagine
  they correspond with the cave-hyena of prehistoric times. This fellow charged
  Nobs, whose Capronian experiences had taught him that discretion is the
  better part of valor&mdash;with the result that he dived head foremost into
  the stream beside me after giving vent to a series of ferocious growls which
  had no more effect upon <i>Hyaena spelaeus</i> than might a sweet smile upon
  an enraged tusker. Afterward I shot the beast, and Nobs had a feast while I
  dressed, for he had become quite a raw-meat eater during our numerous hunting
  expeditions, upon which we always gave him a portion of the kill.</p>

  <p>Whitely and Olson were up and dressed when we returned, and we all sat
  down to a good breakfast. I could not but wonder at Lys' absence from the
  table, for she had always been one of the earliest risers in camp; so about
  nine o'clock, becoming apprehensive lest she might be indisposed, I went to
  the door of her room and knocked. I received no response, though I finally
  pounded with all my strength; then I turned the knob and entered, only to
  find that she was not there. Her bed had been occupied, and her clothing lay
  where she had placed it the previous night upon retiring; but Lys was gone.
  To say that I was distracted with terror would be to put it mildly. Though I
  knew she could not be in camp, I searched every square inch of the compound
  and all the buildings, yet without avail.</p>

  <p>It was Whitely who discovered the first clue&mdash;a huge human-like
  footprint in the soft earth beside the spring, and indications of a struggle
  in the mud.</p>

  <p>Then I found a tiny handkerchief close to the outer wall. Lys had been
  stolen! It was all too plain. Some hideous member of the ape-man tribe had
  entered the fort and carried her off. While I stood stunned and horrified at
  the frightful evidence before me, there came from the direction of the great
  lake an increasing sound that rose to the volume of a shriek. We all looked
  up as the noise approached apparently just above us, and a moment later there
  followed a terrific explosion which hurled us to the ground. When we
  clambered to our feet, we saw a large section of the west wall torn and
  shattered. It was Olson who first recovered from his daze sufficiently to
  guess the explanation of the phenomenon.</p>

  <p>"A shell!" he cried. "And there ain't no shells in Caspak besides what's
  on the <i>U-33</i>. The dirty Boches are shellin' the fort. Come on!" And he
  grasped his rifle and started on a run toward the lake. It was over two
  miles, but we did not pause until the harbor was in view, and still we could
  not see the lake because of the sandstone cliffs which intervened. We ran as
  fast as we could around the lower end of the harbor, scrambled up the cliffs
  and at last stood upon their summit in full view of the lake. Far away down
  the coast, toward the river through which we had come to reach the lake, we
  saw upon the surface the outline of the <i>U-33</i>, black smoke vomiting
  from her funnel.</p>

  <p>Von Schoenvorts had succeeded in refining the oil! The cur had broken his
  every pledge and was leaving us there to our fates. He had even shelled the
  fort as a parting compliment; nor could anything have been more truly
  Prussian than this leave-taking of the Baron Friedrich von Schoenvorts.</p>

  <p>Olson, Whitely, Wilson, and I stood for a moment looking at one another.
  It seemed incredible that man could be so perfidious&mdash;that we had really
  seen with our own eyes the thing that we had seen; but when we returned to
  the fort, the shattered wall gave us ample evidence that there was no
  mistake.</p>

  <p>Then we began to speculate as to whether it had been an ape-man or a
  Prussian that had abducted Lys. From what we knew of von Schoenvorts, we
  would not have been surprised at anything from him; but the footprints by the
  spring seemed indisputable evidence that one of Caprona's undeveloped men had
  borne off the girl I loved.</p>

  <p>As soon as I had assured myself that such was the case, I made my
  preparations to follow and rescue her. Olson, Whitely, and Wilson each wished
  to accompany me; but I told them that they were needed here, since with
  Bradley's party still absent and the Germans gone it was necessary that we
  conserve our force as far as might be possible.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="Caspak1-8"
     id="Caspak1-8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a sad leave-taking as in silence I shook hands with
  each of the three remaining men. Even poor Nobs appeared dejected as we quit
  the compound and set out upon the well-marked spoor of the abductor. Not once
  did I turn my eyes backward toward Fort Dinosaur. I have not looked upon it
  since &mdash;nor in all likelihood shall I ever look upon it again. The trail
  led northwest until it reached the western end of the sandstone cliffs to the
  north of the fort; there it ran into a well-defined path which wound
  northward into a country we had not as yet explored. It was a beautiful,
  gently rolling country, broken by occasional outcroppings of sandstone and by
  patches of dense forest relieved by open, park-like stretches and broad
  meadows whereon grazed countless herbivorous animals&mdash;red deer, aurochs,
  and infinite variety of antelope and at least three distinct species of
  horse, the latter ranging in size from a creature about as large as Nobs to a
  magnificent animal fourteen to sixteen hands high. These creatures fed
  together in perfect amity; nor did they show any great indications of terror
  when Nobs and I approached. They moved out of our way and kept their eyes
  upon us until we had passed; then they resumed their feeding.</p>

  <p>The path led straight across the clearing into another forest, lying upon
  the verge of which I saw a bit of white. It appeared to stand out in marked
  contrast and incongruity to all its surroundings, and when I stopped to
  examine it, I found that it was a small strip of muslin&mdash;part of the hem
  of a garment. At once I was all excitement, for I knew that it was a sign
  left by Lys that she had been carried this way; it was a tiny bit torn from
  the hem of the undergarment that she wore in lieu of the night-robes she had
  lost with the sinking of the liner. Crushing the bit of fabric to my lips, I
  pressed on even more rapidly than before, because I now knew that I was upon
  the right trail and that up to this, point at least, Lys still had lived.</p>

  <p>I made over twenty miles that day, for I was now hardened to fatigue and
  accustomed to long hikes, having spent considerable time hunting and
  exploring in the immediate vicinity of camp. A dozen times that day was my
  life threatened by fearsome creatures of the earth or sky, though I could not
  but note that the farther north I traveled, the fewer were the great
  dinosaurs, though they still persisted in lesser numbers. On the other hand
  the quantity of ruminants and the variety and frequency of carnivorous
  animals increased. Each square mile of Caspak harbored its terrors.</p>

  <p>At intervals along the way I found bits of muslin, and often they
  reassured me when otherwise I should have been doubtful of the trail to take
  where two crossed or where there were forks, as occurred at several points.
  And so, as night was drawing on, I came to the southern end of a line of
  cliffs loftier than any I had seen before, and as I approached them, there
  was wafted to my nostrils the pungent aroma of woodsmoke. What could it mean?
  There could, to my mind, be but a single solution: man abided close by, a
  higher order of man than we had as yet seen, other than Ahm, the Neanderthal
  man. I wondered again as I had so many times that day if it had not been Ahm
  who stole Lys.</p>

  <p>Cautiously I approached the flank of the cliffs, where they terminated in
  an abrupt escarpment as though some all powerful hand had broken off a great
  section of rock and set it upon the surface of the earth. It was now quite
  dark, and as I crept around the edge of the cliff, I saw at a little distance
  a great fire around which were many figures&mdash;apparently human figures.
  Cautioning Nobs to silence, and he had learned many lessons in the value of
  obedience since we had entered Caspak, I slunk forward, taking advantage of
  whatever cover I could find, until from behind a bush I could distinctly see
  the creatures assembled by the fire. They were human and yet not human. I
  should say that they were a little higher in the scale of evolution than Ahm,
  possibly occupying a place of evolution between that of the Neanderthal man
  and what is known as the Grimaldi race. Their features were distinctly
  negroid, though their skins were white. A considerable portion of both torso
  and limbs were covered with short hair, and their physical proportions were
  in many aspects apelike, though not so much so as were Ahm's. They carried
  themselves in a more erect position, although their arms were considerably
  longer than those of the Neanderthal man. As I watched them, I saw that they
  possessed a language, that they had knowledge of fire and that they carried
  besides the wooden club of Ahm, a thing which resembled a crude stone
  hatchet. Evidently they were very low in the scale of humanity, but they were
  a step upward from those I had previously seen in Caspak.</p>

  <p>But what interested me most was the slender figure of a dainty girl, clad
  only in a thin bit of muslin which scarce covered her knees&mdash;a bit of
  muslin torn and ragged about the lower hem. It was Lys, and she was alive and
  so far as I could see, unharmed. A huge brute with thick lips and prognathous
  jaw stood at her shoulder. He was talking loudly and gesticulating wildly. I
  was close enough to hear his words, which were similar to the language of
  Ahm, though much fuller, for there were many words I could not understand.
  However I caught the gist of what he was saying -which in effect was that he
  had found and captured this Galu, that she was his and that he defied anyone
  to question his right of possession. It appeared to me, as I afterward
  learned was the fact, that I was witnessing the most primitive of marriage
  ceremonies. The assembled members of the tribe looked on and listened in a
  sort of dull and perfunctory apathy, for the speaker was by far the mightiest
  of the clan.</p>

  <p>There seemed no one to dispute his claims when he said, or rather shouted,
  in stentorian tones: "I am Tsa. This is my she. Who wishes her more than
  Tsa?"</p>

  <p>"I do," I said in the language of Ahm, and I stepped out into the
  firelight before them. Lys gave a little cry of joy and started toward me,
  but Tsa grasped her arm and dragged her back.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" shrieked Tsa. "I kill! I kill! I kill!"</p>

  <p>"The she is mine," I replied, "and I have come to claim her. I kill if you
  do not let her come to me." And I raised my pistol to a level with his heart.
  Of course the creature had no conception of the purpose of the strange little
  implement which I was poking toward him. With a sound that was half human and
  half the growl of a wild beast, he sprang toward me. I aimed at his heart and
  fired, and as he sprawled headlong to the ground, the others of his tribe,
  overcome by fright at the report of the pistol, scattered toward the
  cliffs&mdash;while Lys, with outstretched arms, ran toward me.</p>

  <p>As I crushed her to me, there rose from the black night behind us and then
  to our right and to our left a series of frightful screams and shrieks,
  bellowings, roars and growls. It was the night-life of this jungle world
  coming into its own&mdash;the huge, carnivorous nocturnal beasts which make
  the nights of Caspak hideous. A shuddering sob ran through Lys' figure. "O
  God," she cried, "give me the strength to endure, for his sake!" I saw that
  she was upon the verge of a breakdown, after all that she must have passed
  through of fear and horror that day, and I tried to quiet and reassure her as
  best I might; but even to me the future looked most unpromising, for what
  chance of life had we against the frightful hunters of the night who even now
  were prowling closer to us?</p>

  <p>Now I turned to see what had become of the tribe, and in the fitful glare
  of the fire I perceived that the face of the cliff was pitted with large
  holes into which the man-things were clambering. "Come," I said to Lys, "we
  must follow them. We cannot last a half-hour out here. We must find a cave."
  Already we could see the blazing green eyes of the hungry carnivora. I seized
  a brand from the fire and hurled it out into the night, and there came back
  an answering chorus of savage and rageful protest; but the eyes vanished for
  a short time. Selecting a burning branch for each of us, we advanced toward
  the cliffs, where we were met by angry threats.</p>

  <p>"They will kill us," said Lys. "We may as well keep on in search of
  another refuge."</p>

  <p>"They will not kill us so surely as will those others out there," I
  replied. "I am going to seek shelter in one of these caves; nor will the
  man-things prevent." And I kept on in the direction of the cliff's base. A
  huge creature stood upon a ledge and brandished his stone hatchet. "Come and
  I will kill you and take the she," he boasted.</p>

  <p>"You saw how Tsa fared when he would have kept my she," I replied in his
  own tongue. "Thus will you fare and all your fellows if you do not permit us
  to come in peace among you out of the dangers of the night."</p>

  <p>"Go north," he screamed. "Go north among the Galus, and we will not harm
  you. Some day will we be Galus; but now we are not. You do not belong among
  us. Go away or we will kill you. The she may remain if she is afraid, and we
  will keep her; but the he must depart."</p>

  <p>"The he won't depart," I replied, and approached still nearer. Rough and
  narrow ledges formed by nature gave access to the upper caves. A man might
  scale them if unhampered and unhindered, but to clamber upward in the face of
  a belligerent tribe of half-men and with a girl to assist was beyond my
  capability.</p>

  <p>"I do not fear you," screamed the creature. "You were close to Tsa; but I
  am far above you. You cannot harm me as you harmed Tsa. Go away!"</p>

  <p>I placed a foot upon the lowest ledge and clambered upward, reaching down
  and pulling Lys to my side. Already I felt safer. Soon we would be out of
  danger of the beasts again closing in upon us. The man above us raised his
  stone hatchet above his head and leaped lightly down to meet us. His position
  above me gave him a great advantage, or at least so he probably thought, for
  he came with every show of confidence. I hated to do it, but there seemed no
  other way, and so I shot him down as I had shot down Tsa.</p>

  <p>"You see," I cried to his fellows, "that I can kill you wherever you may
  be. A long way off I can kill you as well as I can kill you near by. Let us
  come among you in peace. I will not harm you if you do not harm us. We will
  take a cave high up. Speak!"</p>

  <p>"Come, then," said one. "If you will not harm us, you may come. Take Tsa's
  hole, which lies above you."</p>

  <p>The creature showed us the mouth of a black cave, but he kept at a
  distance while he did it, and Lys followed me as I crawled in to explore. I
  had matches with me, and in the light of one I found a small cavern with a
  flat roof and floor which followed the cleavage of the strata. Pieces of the
  roof had fallen at some long-distant date, as was evidenced by the depth of
  the filth and rubble in which they were embedded. Even a superficial
  examination revealed the fact that nothing had ever been attempted that might
  have improved the livability of the cavern; nor, should I judge, had it ever
  been cleaned out. With considerable difficulty I loosened some of the larger
  pieces of broken rock which littered the floor and placed them as a barrier
  before the doorway. It was too dark to do more than this. I then gave Lys a
  piece of dried meat, and sitting inside the entrance, we dined as must have
  some of our ancient forbears at the dawning of the age of man, while far
  below the open diapason of the savage night rose weird and horrifying to our
  ears. In the light of the great fire still burning we could see huge,
  skulking forms, and in the blacker background countless flaming eyes.</p>

  <p>Lys shuddered, and I put my arm around her and drew her to me; and thus we
  sat throughout the hot night. She told me of her abduction and of the fright
  she had undergone, and together we thanked God that she had come through
  unharmed, because the great brute had dared not pause along the
  danger-infested way. She said that they had but just reached the cliffs when
  I arrived, for on several occasions her captor had been forced to take to the
  trees with her to escape the clutches of some hungry cave-lion or
  saber-toothed tiger, and that twice they had been obliged to remain for
  considerable periods before the beasts had retired.</p>

  <p>Nobs, by dint of much scrambling and one or two narrow escapes from death,
  had managed to follow us up the cliff and was now curled between me and the
  doorway, having devoured a piece of the dried meat, which he seemed to relish
  immensely. He was the first to fall asleep; but I imagine we must have
  followed suit soon, for we were both tired. I had laid aside my
  ammunition-belt and rifle, though both were close beside me; but my pistol I
  kept in my lap beneath my hand. However, we were not disturbed during the
  night, and when I awoke, the sun was shining on the tree-tops in the
  distance. Lys' head had drooped to my breast, and my arm was still about
  her.</p>

  <p>Shortly afterward Lys awoke, and for a moment she could not seem to
  comprehend her situation. She looked at me and then turned and glanced at my
  arm about her, and then she seemed quite suddenly to realize the scantiness
  of her apparel and drew away, covering her face with her palms and blushing
  furiously. I drew her back toward me and kissed her, and then she threw her
  arms about my neck and wept softly in mute surrender to the inevitable.</p>

  <p>It was an hour later before the tribe began to stir about. We watched them
  from our "apartment," as Lys called it. Neither men nor women wore any sort
  of clothing or ornaments, and they all seemed to be about of an age; nor were
  there any babies or children among them. This was, to us, the strangest and
  most inexplicable of facts, but it recalled to us that though we had seen
  many of the lesser developed wild people of Caspak, we had never yet seen a
  child or an old man or woman.</p>

  <p>After a while they became less suspicious of us and then quite friendly in
  their brutish way. They picked at the fabric of our clothing, which seemed to
  interest them, and examined my rifle and pistol and the ammunition in the
  belt around my waist. I showed them the thermos-bottle, and when I poured a
  little water from it, they were delighted, thinking that it was a spring
  which I carried about with me&mdash;a never-failing source of water
  supply.</p>

  <p>One thing we both noticed among their other characteristics: they never
  laughed nor smiled; and then we remembered that Ahm had never done so,
  either. I asked them if they knew Ahm; but they said they did not.</p>

  <p>One of them said: "Back there we may have known him." And he jerked his
  head to the south.</p>

  <p>"You came from back there?" I asked. He looked at me in surprise.</p>

  <p>"We all come from there," he said. "After a while we go there." And this
  time he jerked his head toward the north. "Be Galus," he concluded.</p>

  <p>Many times now had we heard this reference to becoming Galus. Ahm had
  spoken of it many times. Lys and I decided that it was a sort of original
  religious conviction, as much a part of them as their instinct for
  self-preservation&mdash;a primal acceptance of a hereafter and a holier
  state. It was a brilliant theory, but it was all wrong. I know it now, and
  how far we were from guessing the wonderful, the miraculous, the gigantic
  truth which even yet I may only guess at&mdash;the thing that sets Caspak
  apart from all the rest of the world far more definitely than her isolated
  geographical position or her impregnable barrier of giant cliffs. If I could
  live to return to civilization, I should have meat for the clergy and the
  layman to chew upon for years&mdash;and for the evolutionists, too.</p>

  <p>After breakfast the men set out to hunt, while the women went to a large
  pool of warm water covered with a green scum and filled with billions of
  tadpoles. They waded in to where the water was about a foot deep and lay down
  in the mud. They remained there from one to two hours and then returned to
  the cliff. While we were with them, we saw this same thing repeated every
  morning; but though we asked them why they did it we could get no reply which
  was intelligible to us. All they vouchsafed in way of explanation was the
  single word Ata. They tried to get Lys to go in with them and could not
  understand why she refused. After the first day I went hunting with the men,
  leaving my pistol and Nobs with Lys, but she never had to use them, for no
  reptile or beast ever approached the pool while the women were there&mdash;
  nor, so far as we know, at other times. There was no spoor of wild beast in
  the soft mud along the banks, and the water certainly didn't look fit to
  drink.</p>

  <p>This tribe lived largely upon the smaller animals which they bowled over
  with their stone hatchets after making a wide circle about their quarry and
  driving it so that it had to pass close to one of their number. The little
  horses and the smaller antelope they secured in sufficient numbers to support
  life, and they also ate numerous varieties of fruits and vegetables. They
  never brought in more than sufficient food for their immediate needs; but why
  bother? The food problem of Caspak is not one to cause worry to her
  inhabitants.</p>

  <p>The fourth day Lys told me that she thought she felt equal to attempting
  the return journey on the morrow, and so I set out for the hunt in high
  spirits, for I was anxious to return to the fort and learn if Bradley and his
  party had returned and what had been the result of his expedition. I also
  wanted to relieve their minds as to Lys and myself, as I knew that they must
  have already given us up for dead. It was a cloudy day, though warm, as it
  always is in Caspak. It seemed odd to realize that just a few miles away
  winter lay upon the storm-tossed ocean, and that snow might be falling all
  about Caprona; but no snow could ever penetrate the damp, hot atmosphere of
  the great crater.</p>

  <p>We had to go quite a bit farther than usual before we could surround a
  little bunch of antelope, and as I was helping drive them, I saw a fine red
  deer a couple of hundred yards behind me. He must have been asleep in the
  long grass, for I saw him rise and look about him in a bewildered way, and
  then I raised my gun and let him have it. He dropped, and I ran forward to
  finish him with the long thin knife, which one of the men had given me; but
  just as I reached him, he staggered to his feet and ran on for another two
  hundred yards&mdash;when I dropped him again. Once more was this repeated
  before I was able to reach him and cut his throat; then I looked around for
  my companions, as I wanted them to come and carry the meat home; but I could
  see nothing of them. I called a few times and waited, but there was no
  response and no one came. At last I became disgusted, and cutting off all the
  meat that I could conveniently carry, I set off in the direction of the
  cliffs. I must have gone about a mile before the truth dawn upon me&mdash;I
  was lost, hopelessly lost.</p>

  <p>The entire sky was still completely blotted out by dense clouds; nor was
  there any landmark visible by which I might have taken my bearings. I went on
  in the direction I thought was south but which I now imagine must have been
  about due north, without detecting a single familiar object. In a dense wood
  I suddenly stumbled upon a thing which at first filled me with hope and later
  with the most utter despair and dejection. It was a little mound of
  new-turned earth sprinkled with flowers long since withered, and at one end
  was a flat slab of sandstone stuck in the ground. It was a grave, and it
  meant for me that I had at last stumbled into a country inhabited by human
  beings. I would find them; they would direct me to the cliffs; perhaps they
  would accompany me and take us back with them to their abodes&mdash;to the
  abodes of men and women like ourselves. My hopes and my imagination ran riot
  in the few yards I had to cover to reach that lonely grave and stoop that I
  might read the rude characters scratched upon the simple headstone. This is
  what I read:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">HERE LIES JOHN TIPPET<br>
  ENGLISHMAN<br>
  KILLED BY TYRANNOSAURUS<br>
  10 SEPT., A.D. 1916 &mdash; R. I. P.</p><br>

  <p>Tippet! It seemed incredible. Tippet lying here in this gloomy wood!
  Tippet dead! He had been a good man, but the personal loss was not what
  affected me. It was the fact that this silent grave gave evidence that
  Bradley had come this far upon his expedition and that he too probably was
  lost, for it was not our intention that he should be long gone. If I had
  stumbled upon the grave of one of the party, was it not within reason to
  believe that the bones of the others lay scattered somewhere near?</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="Caspak1-9"
     id="Caspak1-9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS I stood looking down upon that sad and lonely mound,
  wrapped in the most dismal of reflections and premonitions, I was suddenly
  seized from behind and thrown to earth. As I fell, a warm body fell on top of
  me, and hands grasped my arms and legs. When I could look up, I saw a number
  of giant figures pinioning me down, while others stood about surveying me.
  Here again was a new type of man&mdash;a higher type than the primitive tribe
  I had just quitted. They were a taller people, too, with better-shaped skulls
  and more intelligent faces. There were less of the ape characteristics about
  their features, and less of the negroid, too. They carried weapons,
  stone-shod spears, stone knives, and hatchets&mdash;and they wore ornaments
  and breech-cloths&mdash;the former of feathers worn in their hair and the
  latter made of a single snake-skin cured with the head on, the head depending
  to their knees.</p>

  <p>Of course I did not take in all these details upon the instant of my
  capture, for I was busy with other matters. Three of the warriors were
  sitting upon me, trying to hold me down by main strength and awkwardness, and
  they were having their hands full in the doing, I can tell you. I don't like
  to appear conceited, but I may as well admit that I am proud of my strength
  and the science that I have acquired and developed in the directing of
  it&mdash;that and my horsemanship I always have been proud of. And now, that
  day, all the long hours that I had put into careful study, practice and
  training brought me in two or three minutes a full return upon my investment.
  Californians, as a rule, are familiar with jujitsu, and I especially had made
  a study of it for several years, both at school and in the gym of the Los
  Angeles Athletic Club, while recently I had had, in my employ, a Jap who was
  a wonder at the art.</p>

  <p>It took me just about thirty seconds to break the elbow of one of my
  assailants, trip another and send him stumbling backward among his fellows,
  and throw the third completely over my head in such a way that when he fell
  his neck was broken. In the instant that the others of the party stood in
  mute and inactive surprise, I unslung my rifle&mdash;which, carelessly, I had
  been carrying across my back; and when they charged, as I felt they would, I
  put a bullet in the forehead of one of them. This stopped them all
  temporarily&mdash;not the death of their fellow, but the report of the rifle,
  the first they had ever heard. Before they were ready to attack me again, one
  of them spoke in a commanding tone to his fellows, and in a language similar
  but still more comprehensive than that of the tribe to the south, as theirs
  was more complete than Ahm's. He commanded them to stand back and then he
  advanced and addressed me.</p>

  <p>He asked me who I was, from whence I came and what my intentions were. I
  replied that I was a stranger in Caspak, that I was lost and that my only
  desire was to find my way back to my companions. He asked where they were and
  I told him toward the south somewhere, using the Caspakian phrase which,
  literally translated, means "toward the beginning." His surprise showed upon
  his face before he voiced it in words. "There are no Galus there," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"I tell you," I said angrily, "that I am from another country, far from
  Caspak, far beyond the high cliffs. I do not know who the Galus may be; I
  have never seen them. This is the farthest north I have been. Look at
  me&mdash;look at my clothing and my weapons. Have you ever seen a Galu or any
  other creature in Caspak who possessed such things?"</p>

  <p>He had to admit that he had not, and also that he was much interested in
  me, my rifle and the way I had handled his three warriors. Finally he became
  half convinced that I was telling him the truth and offered to aid me if I
  would show him how I had thrown the man over my head and also make him a
  present of the "bang-spear," as he called it. I refused to give him my rifle,
  but promised to show him the trick he wished to learn if he would guide me in
  the right direction. He told me that he would do so tomorrow, that it was too
  late today and that I might come to their village and spend the night with
  them. I was loath to lose so much time; but the fellow was obdurate, and so I
  accompanied them. The two dead men they left where they had fallen, nor gave
  them a second glance&mdash;thus cheap is life upon Caspak.</p>

  <p>These people also were cave-dwellers, but their caves showed the result of
  a higher intelligence that brought them a step nearer to civilized man than
  the tribe next "toward the beginning." The interiors of their caverns were
  cleared of rubbish, though still far from clean, and they had pallets of
  dried grasses covered with the skins of leopard, lynx, and bear, while before
  the entrances were barriers of stone and small, rudely circular stone ovens.
  The walls of the cavern to which I was conducted were covered with drawings
  scratched upon the sandstone. There were the outlines of the giant red deer,
  of mammoths, of tigers and other beasts. Here, as in the last tribe, there
  were no children or any old people. The men of this tribe had two names, or
  rather names of two syllables, and their language contained words of two
  syllables; whereas in the tribe of Tsa the words were all of a single
  syllable, with the exception of a very few like <i>Atis</i> and <i>Galus</i>.
  The chief's name was To-jo, and his household consisted of seven females and
  himself. These women were much more comely, or rather less hideous than those
  of Tsa's people; one of them, even, was almost pretty, being less hairy and
  having a rather nice skin, with high coloring.</p>

  <p>They were all much interested in me and examined my clothing and equipment
  carefully, handling and feeling and smelling of each article. I learned from
  them that their people were known as Band-lu, or spear-men; Tsa's race was
  called Sto-lu&mdash;hatchet-men. Below these in the scale of evolution came
  the Bo-lu, or club-men, and then the Alus, who had no weapons and no
  language. In that word I recognized what to me seemed the most remarkable
  discovery I had made upon Caprona, for unless it were mere coincidence, I had
  come upon a word that had been handed down from the beginning of spoken
  language upon earth, been handed down for millions of years, perhaps, with
  little change. It was the sole remaining thread of the ancient woof of a
  dawning culture which had been woven when Caprona was a fiery mount upon a
  great land-mass teeming with life. It linked the unfathomable then to the
  eternal now. And yet it may have been pure coincidence; my better judgment
  tells me that it is coincidence that in Caspak the term for speechless man is
  <i>Alus</i>, and in the outer world of our own day it is <i>Alalus</i>.</p>

  <p>The comely woman of whom I spoke was called So-ta, and she took such a
  lively interest in me that To-jo finally objected to her attentions,
  emphasizing his displeasure by knocking her down and kicking her into a
  corner of the cavern. I leaped between them while he was still kicking her,
  and obtaining a quick hold upon him, dragged him screaming with pain from the
  cave. Then I made him promise not to hurt the she again, upon pain of worse
  punishment. So-ta gave me a grateful look; but To-jo and the balance of his
  women were sullen and ominous.</p>

  <p>Later in the evening So-ta confided to me that she was soon to leave the
  tribe.</p>

  <p>"So-ta soon to be Kro-lu," she confided in a low whisper. I asked her what
  a Kro-lu might be, and she tried to explain, but I do not yet know if I
  understood her. From her gestures I deduced that the Kro-lus were a people
  who were armed with bows and arrows, had vessels in which to cook their food
  and huts of some sort in which they lived, and were accompanied by animals.
  It was all very fragmentary and vague, but the idea seemed to be that the
  Kro-lus were a more advanced people than the Band-lus. I pondered a long time
  upon all that I had heard, before sleep came to me. I tried to find some
  connection between these various races that would explain the universal hope
  which each of them harbored that some day they would become Galus. So-ta had
  given me a suggestion; but the resulting idea was so weird that I could
  scarce even entertain it; yet it coincided with Ahm's expressed hope, with
  the various steps in evolution I had noted in the several tribes I had
  encountered and with the range of type represented in each tribe. For
  example, among the Band-lu were such types as So-ta, who seemed to me to be
  the highest in the scale of evolution, and To-jo, who was just a shade nearer
  the ape, while there were others who had flatter noses, more prognathous
  faces and hairier bodies. The question puzzled me. Possibly in the outer
  world the answer to it is locked in the bosom of the Sphinx. Who knows? I do
  not.</p>

  <p>Thinking the thoughts of a lunatic or a dope-fiend, I fell asleep; and
  when I awoke, my hands and feet were securely tied and my weapons had been
  taken from me. How they did it without awakening me I cannot tell you. It was
  humiliating, but it was true. To-jo stood above me. The early light of
  morning was dimly filtering into the cave.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," he demanded, "how to throw a man over my head and break his
  neck, for I am going to kill you, and I wish to know this thing before you
  die."</p>

  <p>Of all the ingenuous declarations I have ever heard, this one copped the
  proverbial bun. It struck me as so funny that, even in the face of death, I
  laughed. Death, I may remark here, had, however, lost much of his terror for
  me. I had become a disciple of Lys' fleeting philosophy of the valuelessness
  of human life. I realized that she was quite right&mdash;that we were but
  comic figures hopping from the cradle to the grave, of interest to
  practically no other created thing than ourselves and our few intimates.</p>

  <p>Behind To-jo stood So-ta. She raised one hand with the palm toward
  me&mdash;the Caspakian equivalent of a negative shake of the head.</p>

  <p>"Let me think about it," I parried, and To-jo said that he would wait
  until night. He would give me a day to think it over; then he left, and the
  women left&mdash;the men for the hunt, and the women, as I later learned from
  So-ta, for the warm pool where they immersed their bodies as did the shes of
  the Sto-lu. "Ata," explained So-ta, when I questioned her as to the purpose
  of this matutinal rite; but that was later.</p>

  <p>I must have lain there bound and uncomfortable for two or three hours when
  at last So-ta entered the cave. She carried a sharp knife&mdash;mine, in
  fact, and with it she cut my bonds.</p>

  <p>"Come!" she said. "So-ta will go with you back to the Galus. It is time
  that So-ta left the Band-lu. Together we will go to the Kro-lu, and after
  that the Galus. To-jo will kill you tonight. He will kill So-ta if he knows
  that So-ta aided you. We will go together."</p>

  <p>"I will go with you to the Kro-lu," I replied, "but then I must return to
  my own people `toward the beginning.'"</p>

  <p>"You cannot go back," she said. "It is forbidden. They would kill you.
  Thus far have you come&mdash;there is no returning."</p>

  <p>"But I must return," I insisted. "My people are there. I must return and
  lead them in this direction."</p>

  <p>She insisted, and I insisted; but at last we compromised. I was to escort
  her as far as the country of the Kro-lu and then I was to go back after my
  own people and lead them north into a land where the dangers were fewer and
  the people less murderous. She brought me all my belongings that had been
  filched from me&mdash;rifle, ammunition, knife, and thermos bottle, and then
  hand in hand we descended the cliff and set off toward the north.</p>

  <p>For three days we continued upon our way, until we arrived outside a
  village of thatched huts just at dusk. So-ta said that she would enter alone;
  I must not be seen if I did not intend to remain, as it was forbidden that
  one should return and live after having advanced this far. So she left me.
  She was a dear girl and a stanch and true comrade&mdash;more like a man than
  a woman. In her simple barbaric way she was both refined and chaste. She had
  been the wife of To-jo. Among the Kro-lu she would find another mate after
  the manner of the strange Caspakian world; but she told me very frankly that
  whenever I returned, she would leave her mate and come to me, as she
  preferred me above all others. I was becoming a ladies' man after a lifetime
  of bashfulness!</p>

  <p>At the outskirts of the village I left her without even seeing the sort of
  people who inhabited it, and set off through the growing darkness toward the
  south. On the third day I made a detour westward to avoid the country of the
  Band-lu, as I did not care to be detained by a meeting with To-jo. On the
  sixth day I came to the cliffs of the Sto-lu, and my heart beat fast as I
  approached them, for here was Lys. Soon I would hold her tight in my arms
  again; soon her warm lips would merge with mine. I felt sure that she was
  still safe among the hatchet people, and I was already picturing the joy and
  the love-light in her eyes when she should see me once more as I emerged from
  the last clump of trees and almost ran toward the cliffs.</p>

  <p>It was late in the morning. The women must have returned from the pool;
  yet as I drew near, I saw no sign of life whatever. "They have remained
  longer," I thought; but when I was quite close to the base of the cliffs, I
  saw that which dashed my hopes and my happiness to earth. Strewn along the
  ground were a score of mute and horrible suggestions of what had taken place
  during my absence&mdash;bones picked clean of flesh, the bones of manlike
  creatures, the bones of many of the tribe of Sto-lu; nor in any cave was
  there sign of life.</p>

  <p>Closely I examined the ghastly remains fearful each instant that I should
  find the dainty skull that would shatter my happiness for life; but though I
  searched diligently, picking up every one of the twenty-odd skulls, I found
  none that was the skull of a creature but slightly removed from the ape.
  Hope, then, still lived. For another three days I searched north and south,
  east and west for the hatchet-men of Caspak; but never a trace of them did I
  find. It was raining most of the time now, and the weather was as near cold
  as it ever seems to get on Caprona.</p>

  <p>At last I gave up the search and set off toward Fort Dinosaur. For a week
  &mdash;a week filled with the terrors and dangers of a primeval world
  &mdash;I pushed on in the direction I thought was south. The sun never shone;
  the rain scarcely ever ceased falling. The beasts I met with were fewer in
  number but infinitely more terrible in temper; yet I lived on until there
  came to me the realization that I was hopelessly lost, that a year of
  sunshine would not again give me my bearings; and while I was cast down by
  this terrifying knowledge, the knowledge that I never again could find Lys, I
  stumbled upon another grave&mdash;the grave of William James, with its little
  crude headstone and its scrawled characters recording that he had died upon
  the 13th of September&mdash;killed by a saber-tooth tiger.</p>

  <p>I think that I almost gave up then. Never in my life have I felt more
  hopeless or helpless or alone. I was lost. I could not find my friends. I did
  not even know that they still lived; in fact, I could not bring myself to
  believe that they did. I was sure that Lys was dead. I wanted myself to die,
  and yet I clung to life&mdash;useless and hopeless and harrowing a thing as
  it had become. I clung to life because some ancient, reptilian forbear had
  clung to life and transmitted to me through the ages the most powerful motive
  that guided his minute brain&mdash;the motive of self-preservation.</p>

  <p>At last I came to the great barrier-cliffs; and after three days of mad
  effort&mdash;of maniacal effort&mdash;I scaled them. I built crude ladders; I
  wedged sticks in narrow fissures; I chopped toe-holds and finger-holds with
  my long knife; but at last I scaled them. Near the summit I came upon a huge
  cavern. It is the abode of some mighty winged creature of the
  Triassic&mdash;or rather it was. Now it is mine. I slew the thing and took
  its abode. I reached the summit and looked out upon the broad gray terrible
  Pacific of the far-southern winter. It was cold up there. It is cold here
  today; yet here I sit watching, watching, watching for the thing I know will
  never come&mdash;for a sail.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a name="Caspak1-10"
     id="Caspak1-10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ONCE a day I descend to the base of the cliff and hunt, and
  fill my stomach with water from a clear cold spring. I have three gourds
  which I fill with water and take back to my cave against the long nights. I
  have fashioned a spear and a bow and arrow, that I may conserve my
  ammunition, which is running low. My clothes are worn to shreds. Tomorrow I
  shall discard them for leopard-skins which I have tanned and sewn into a
  garment strong and warm. It is cold up here. I have a fire burning and I sit
  bent over it while I write; but I am safe here. No other living creature
  ventures to the chill summit of the barrier cliffs. I am safe, and I am alone
  with my sorrows and my remembered joys&mdash;but without hope. It is said
  that hope springs eternal in the human breast; but there is none in mine.</p>

  <p>I am about done. Presently I shall fold these pages and push them into my
  thermos bottle. I shall cork it and screw the cap tight, and then I shall
  hurl it as far out into the sea as my strength will permit. The wind is
  off-shore; the tide is running out; perhaps it will be carried into one of
  those numerous ocean-currents which sweep perpetually from pole to pole and
  from continent to continent, to be deposited at last upon some inhabited
  shore. If fate is kind and this does happen, then, <i>for God's sake, come
  and get me!</i></p>

  <p>It was a week ago that I wrote the preceding paragraph, which I thought
  would end the written record of my life upon Caprona. I had paused to put a
  new point on my quill and stir the crude ink (which I made by crushing a
  black variety of berry and mixing it with water) before attaching my
  signature, when faintly from the valley far below came an unmistakable sound
  which brought me to my feet, trembling with excitement, to peer eagerly
  downward from my dizzy ledge. How full of meaning that sound was to me you
  may guess when I tell you that it was the report of a firearm! For a moment
  my gaze traversed the landscape beneath until it was caught and held by four
  figures near the base of the cliff&mdash;a human figure held at bay by three
  hyaenodons, those ferocious and blood-thirsty wild dogs of the Eocene. A
  fourth beast lay dead or dying near by.</p>

  <p>I couldn't be sure, looking down from above as I was; but yet I trembled
  like a leaf in the intuitive belief that it was Lys, and my judgment served
  to confirm my wild desire, for whoever it was carried only a pistol, and thus
  had Lys been armed. The first wave of sudden joy which surged through me was
  short-lived in the face of the swift-following conviction that the one who
  fought below was already doomed. Luck and only luck it must have been which
  had permitted that first shot to lay low one of the savage creatures, for
  even such a heavy weapon as my pistol is entirely inadequate against even the
  lesser carnivora of Caspak. In a moment the three would charge! A futile shot
  would but tend more greatly to enrage the one it chanced to hit; and then the
  three would drag down the little human figure and tear it to pieces.</p>

  <p>And maybe it was Lys! My heart stood still at the thought, but mind and
  muscle responded to the quick decision I was forced to make. There was but a
  single hope&mdash;a single chance&mdash;and I took it. I raised my rifle to
  my shoulder and took careful aim. It was a long shot, a dangerous shot, for
  unless one is accustomed to it, shooting from a considerable altitude is most
  deceptive work. There is, though, something about marksmanship which is quite
  beyond all scientific laws.</p>

  <p>Upon no other theory can I explain my marksmanship of that moment. Three
  times my rifle spoke&mdash;three quick, short syllables of death. I did not
  take conscious aim; and yet at each report a beast crumpled in its
  tracks!</p>

  <p>From my ledge to the base of the cliff is a matter of several thousand
  feet of dangerous climbing; yet I venture to say that the first ape from
  whose loins my line has descended never could have equaled the speed with
  which I literally dropped down the face of that rugged escarpment. The last
  two hundred feet is over a steep incline of loose rubble to the valley
  bottom, and I had just reached the top of this when there arose to my ears an
  agonized cry&mdash;"Bowen! Bowen! Quick, my love, quick!"</p>

  <p>I had been too much occupied with the dangers of the descent to glance
  down toward the valley; but that cry which told me that it was indeed Lys,
  and that she was again in danger, brought my eyes quickly upon her in time to
  see a hairy, burly brute seize her and start off at a run toward the near-by
  wood. From rock to rock, chamoislike, I leaped downward toward the valley, in
  pursuit of Lys and her hideous abductor.</p>

  <p>He was heavier than I by many pounds, and so weighted by the burden he
  carried that I easily overtook him; and at last he turned, snarling, to face
  me. It was Kho of the tribe of Tsa, the hatchet-men. He recognized me, and
  with a low growl he threw Lys aside and came for me. "The she is mine," he
  cried. "I kill! I kill!"</p>

  <p>I had had to discard my rifle before I commenced the rapid descent of the
  cliff, so that now I was armed only with a hunting knife, and this I whipped
  from its scabbard as Kho leaped toward me. He was a mighty beast, mightily
  muscled, and the urge that has made males fight since the dawn of life on
  earth filled him with the blood-lust and the thirst to slay; but not one whit
  less did it fill me with the same primal passions. Two abysmal beasts sprang
  at each other's throats that day beneath the shadow of earth's oldest cliffs
  &mdash;the man of now and the man-thing of the earliest, forgotten then,
  imbued by the same deathless passion that has come down unchanged through all
  the epochs, periods and eras of time from the beginning, and which shall
  continue to the incalculable end&mdash;woman, the imperishable Alpha and
  Omega of life.</p>

  <p>Kho closed and sought my jugular with his teeth. He seemed to forget the
  hatchet dangling by its aurochs-hide thong at his hip, as I forgot, for the
  moment, the dagger in my hand. And I doubt not but that Kho would easily have
  bested me in an encounter of that sort had not Lys' voice awakened within my
  momentarily reverted brain the skill and cunning of reasoning man. "Bowen!"
  she cried. "Your knife! Your knife!" It was enough. It recalled me from the
  forgotten eon to which my brain had flown and left me once again a modern man
  battling with a clumsy, unskilled brute. No longer did my jaws snap at the
  hairy throat before me; but instead my knife sought and found a space between
  two ribs over the savage heart. Kho voiced a single horrid scream, stiffened
  spasmodically and sank to the earth. And Lys threw herself into my arms. All
  the fears and sorrows of the past were wiped away, and once again I was the
  happiest of men.</p>

  <p>With some misgivings I shortly afterward cast my eyes upward toward the
  precarious ledge which ran before my cave, for it seemed to me quite beyond
  all reason to expect a dainty modern belle to essay the perils of that
  frightful climb. I asked her if she thought she could brave the ascent, and
  she laughed gayly in my face.</p>

  <p>"Watch!" she cried, and ran eagerly toward the base of the cliff. Like a
  squirrel she clambered swiftly aloft, so that I was forced to exert myself to
  keep pace with her. At first she frightened me; but presently I was aware
  that she was quite as safe here as was I. When we finally came to my ledge
  and I again held her in my arms, she recalled to my mind that for several
  weeks she had been living the life of a cave-girl with the tribe of
  hatchet-men. They had been driven from their former caves by another tribe
  which had slain many and carried off quite half the females, and the new
  cliffs to which they had flown had proven far higher and more precipitous, so
  that she had become, through necessity, a most practiced climber.</p>

  <p>She told me of Kho's desire for her, since all his females had been stolen
  and of how her life had been a constant nightmare of terror as she sought by
  night and by day to elude the great brute. For a time Nobs had been all the
  protection she required; but one day he disappeared&mdash;nor has she seen
  him since. She believes that he was deliberately made away with; and so do I,
  for we both are sure that he never would have deserted her. With her means of
  protection gone, Lys was now at the mercy of the hatchet-man; nor was it many
  hours before he had caught her at the base of the cliff and seized her; but
  as he bore her triumphantly aloft toward his cave, she had managed to break
  loose and escape him.</p>

  <p>"For three days he has pursued me," she said, "through this horrible
  world. How I have passed through in safety I cannot guess, nor how I have
  always managed to outdistance him; yet I have done it, until just as you
  discovered me. Fate was kind to us, Bowen."</p>

  <p>I nodded my head in assent and crushed her to me. And then we talked and
  planned as I cooked antelope-steaks over my fire, and we came to the
  conclusion that there was no hope of rescue, that she and I were doomed to
  live and die upon Caprona. Well, it might be worse! I would rather live here
  always with Lys than to live elsewhere without her; and she, dear girl, says
  the same of me; but I am afraid of this life for her. It is a hard, fierce,
  dangerous life, and I shall pray always that we shall be rescued from
  it&mdash;for her sake.</p>

  <p>That night the clouds broke, and the moon shone down upon our little
  ledge; and there, hand in hand, we turned our faces toward heaven and
  plighted our troth beneath the eyes of God. No human agency could have
  married us more sacredly than we are wed. We are man and wife, and we are
  content. If God wills it, we shall live out our lives here. If He wills
  otherwise, then this manuscript which I shall now consign to the inscrutable
  forces of the sea shall fall into friendly hands. However, we are each
  without hope. And so we say good-bye in this, our last message to the world
  beyond the barrier cliffs.</p>
