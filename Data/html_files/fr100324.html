  <p class="note">&ldquo;Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion....&rdquo;&mdash;Psalm
    48. 2.</p>
  <p>And it came to pass in Rome after the kalends of September, and when Caius
    Julius C&aelig;sar Caligula ruled over Imperial Rome.</p>
  <p>Arminius Quirinius, the censor, was dead. He had died by his own hand, and
    thus was a life of extortion and of fraud brought to an ignominious end through
    the force of public opinion, and by the decree of that same C&aelig;sar who
    himself had largely benefited by the mal-practices of his minion.</p>
  <p>Arminius Quirinius had committed every crime, sunk to every kind of degradation
    which an inordinate love of luxury and the insatiable desires of jaded senses
    had suggested as a means to satisfaction, until the treachery of his own
    accomplices had thrown the glaring light of publicity on a career of turpitude
    such as even these decadent times had seldom witnessed ere this.</p>
  <p>Enough that the end had come at last. A denunciation from the rostrum, a
    discontented accomplice thirsting for revenge, an angry crowd eager to listen,
    and within an hour the mighty, much-feared censor was forced to flee from
    Rome to escape the fury of a populace which would have torn him to pieces,
    and was ready even to massacre his family and his womenfolk, his clients
    and his slaves.</p>
  <p>He escaped to his villa at Ostia. But the Emperor Caligula, having duly
    enjoyed the profits derived from his favourite&rsquo;s extortions, hurled
    anathema and the full weight of his displeasure on the man who had been not
    only fool enough to be found out, but who had compromised the popularity
    of the C&aelig;sar in the eyes of the people and of the army. Twenty-four
    hours later the imperial decree went forth that the disgraced censor must
    end his days in any manner which he thought best&mdash;seeing that a patrician
    and member of the Senate could not be handed over to common justice&mdash;and
    also that the goods of Arminius Quirinius should be publicly sold for the
    benefit of the State and the profit of those whom the extortioner had wronged.</p>
  <p>The latter phrase, though somewhat vague, pleased the people and soothed
    public irritation, and the ephemeral popularity of a half-crazy tyrant was
    momentarily restored. Be it said however, that less than a month later the
    C&aelig;sar decided that he himself had been the person most wronged by Arminius,
    and that the bulk of the profits derived from the sale of the late censor&rsquo;s
    goods must therefore find its way into the imperial coffers.</p>
  <p>The furniture of Arminius&rsquo; house within the city and that of his villa
    at Ostia had fetched vast sums at a public auction which had lasted three
    days. Everything had been sold, from the bed with the gilt legs on which
    the body of the censor had been laid after his death, to the last vase of
    murra that adorned his walls and the cups of crystal from which his guests
    had drunk. His pet monkeys were sold and his tame magpies, the pots of flowers
    out of the hothouses and the bunches of melons and winter grapes ripening
    under glass.</p>
  <p>After that it was the turn of the slaves. There were, so I understand, over
    seven thousand of these: scribes and carpenters, litter-bearers and sculptors,
    cooks and musicians; there were a quantity of young children, and some half-witted
    dolts and misshapen dwarfs, kept for the amusement of guests during the intervals
    of supper.</p>
  <p>The bulk of them had been sent to the markets of Delos and Phaselis, but
    the imperator had had the most valuable items amongst the human goods set
    aside for himself, and not a few choice pieces had found their way into the
    households of the aediles in charge of the sales: the State too had appropriated
    some hundreds of useful scribes, sculptors and mechanics, but there were
    still a thousand or so who&mdash;in compliance with the original imperial
    edict&mdash;would have to be sold by public auction in Rome for the benefit
    of the late censor&rsquo;s defrauded victims.</p>
  <p>And thus, on this ninth day of September, a human load panting under the
    heat of this late summer&rsquo;s sun, huddled one against the other, pushed
    and jostled by the crowd, was exposed to the public gaze in the Forum over
    against the rostrum Augustini, so that all who had a mind, and a purse withal,
    might suit their fancy and buy.</p>
  <p>A bundle of humanity&mdash;not over-wretched, for the condition of the slaves
    in the household of Arminius Quirinius had not been an unhappy one&mdash;they
    all seemed astonished, some even highly pleased, at thus finding themselves
    the centre of attraction in the Forum, they who had spent their lives in
    getting humbly out of other people&rsquo;s way.</p>
  <p>Fair and dark, ivory skin and ebony, male and female, or almost sexless
    in the excess of deformity, there were some to suit all tastes. Each wore
    a tablet hung round the neck by a green cord: on this were writ the chief
    merits of the wearer, and also a list of his or her defects, so that intending
    purchasers might know what to expect.</p>
  <p>There were the Phrygians with fair curly hair and delicate hands skilled
    in the limner&rsquo;s art; the Numidians with skins of ebony and keen black
    eyes that shone like dusky rubies; they were agile at the chase, could capture
    a lion or trap the wild beasts that are so useful in gladiatorial games.
    There were Greeks here, pale of face and gentle of manner who could strike
    the chords of a lyre and sing to its accompaniment, and there were swarthy
    Spaniards who fashioned breast-plates of steel and fine chain mail to resist
    the assassin&rsquo;s dagger: there were Gauls with long lithe limbs and brown
    hair tied in a knot high above the forehead, and Allemanni from the Rhine
    with two-coloured hair heavy and crisp like a lion&rsquo;s mane. There was
    a musician from Memphis whose touch upon the sistrum would call a dying spirit
    back to the land of the living, and a cook from Jud&aelig;a who could stew
    a peacock&rsquo;s tongue so that it melted like nectar in the mouth: there
    was a white-skinned Iceni from Britain, versed in the art of healing, and
    a negress from Numidia who had killed a raging lion by one hit on the jaw
    from her powerful fist.</p>
  <p>Then there were those freshly brought to Rome from overseas, whose merits
    or demerits had not yet been appraised&mdash;they wore no tablet round the
    neck, but their feet were whitened all over with chalk; and there were those
    whose heads were surmounted by an ugly felt hat in token that the State treasury
    tendered no guarantee for them. Their period of servitude had been so short
    that nothing was known about them, about their health, their skill, or their
    condition.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Above them towered the gigantic rostrum with tier upon tier of massive blocks
    of marble, and in the centre, up aloft, the bronze figure of the wolf&mdash;the
    foster-mother of the great city&mdash;with metal jaws distended and polished
    teeth that gleamed like emeralds in the sun.</p>
  <p>And all around the stately temples of the Forum, with their rich carvings
    and colonnades and walls in tones of delicate creamy white, scarce less brilliant
    than the clouds which a gentle morning breeze was chasing westwards to the
    sea. And under the arcades of the temples cool shadows, dense and blue, trenchant
    against the white marble like an irregular mosaic of lapis lazuli, with figures
    gliding along between the tall columns, priests in white robes, furtive of
    gait, slaves of the pontificate, shoeless and silent and as if detached from
    the noise and bustle of the Forum, like ghosts that haunt the precincts of
    graves.</p>
  <p>Throughout all this the gorgeous colouring that a summer&rsquo;s mid-morning
    throws over imperial Rome. Above, that canopy of translucent blue, iridescent
    and scintillating with a thousand colours, flicks of emerald and crimson,
    of rose and of mauve that merge and dance together, divide and reunite before
    the retina, until the gaze loses consciousness of all colour save one all-pervading
    sense of gold.</p>
  <p>In the distance the Capitol, temple-crowned, rearing its deified summit
    upwards to the dome of heaven above, holding on its triple shoulders a throng
    of metal gods, with Jupiter Victor right in the centre, a thunderbolt in
    his hand which throws back ten thousand reflections of dazzling light&mdash;another
    sun engendered by the sun. And to the west the Aventine wrapped in its mantle
    of dull brown, its smooth incline barren and scorched, and with tiny mud-huts
    dotted about like sleepy eyes that close beneath the glare.</p>
  <p>And far away beyond the Aventine, beyond the temples and palaces, the blue
    ribbon of the Tiber flowing lazily to the sea: there where a rose-coloured
    haze hung in mid-air, hiding with filmy, transparent veil the vast Campania
    beyond, its fever-haunted marshes and its reed-covered fastnesses.</p>
  <p>The whole, a magnificent medley of cream and gold and azure, and deep impenetrable
    shadows trenchant as a thunder cloud upon an horizon of gold, and the moving
    crowd below, ivory and bronze and black, with here and there the brilliant
    note of a snow-white robe or of crimson head-band gleaming through dark locks.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Up and around the rostrum, noise that was almost deafening had prevailed
    from an early hour. On one of the gradients some ten or a dozen scribes were
    squatting on mats of twisted straw, making notes of the sales and entries
    of the proceeds on rolls of parchment which they had for the purpose, whilst
    a swarthy slave, belonging to the treasury, acted as auctioneer under direct
    orders from the praefect of Rome. He was perched high up aloft, immediately
    beneath the shadow of the yawning bronze wolf; he stood bare-headed under
    the glare of the sun, but a linen tunic covered his shoulders, and his black
    hair was held close to his head by a vivid crimson band.</p>
  <p>He shouted almost incessantly in fluent Latin, but with the lisp peculiar
    to the African races.</p>
  <p>A sun-tanned giant whose massive frame and fair hair, that gleamed ruddy
    in the sun, proclaimed some foreign ancestry was the praefectus in command
    of this tangled bundle of humanity.</p>
  <p>He had arrived quite early in the day and his litter stood not far from
    the rostrum; its curtains of crimson silk, like vivid stains of blood upon
    the walls of cream and gold, fluttered restlessly in the breeze. Around the
    litter a crowd of his own slaves and attendants remained congregated, but
    he himself stood isolated on the lowest gradient of the central rostrum,
    leaning his powerful frame against the marble, with arms folded across his
    mighty chest; his deep-set eyes were overshadowed by heavy brows and his
    square forehead cut across by the furrow of a perpetual frown which gave
    the whole face a strange expression of untamed will and of savage pride,
    in no way softened by the firm lines of the tightly closed lips or the contour
    of the massive jaws.</p>
  <p>His lictors, at some little distance from him, kept his person well guarded,
    but it was he who, with word or nod, directed the progress of the sale, giving
    occasional directions to the lictors who&mdash;wielding heavy flails&mdash;had
    much ado to keep the herd of human cattle within the bounds of its pens.
    His voice was harsh and peremptory and he pronounced the Latin words with
    but the faintest semblance of foreign intonation.</p>
  <p>Now and then at a word from a likely purchaser he would with a sign order
    a lictor to pick out one of his wares, to drag him forward out of a compact
    group and set him up on the catasta. A small crowd would then collect round
    the slave thus exposed, the tablet on his neck would be carefully perused
    and the chattel made to turn round and round, to walk backwards and forwards,
    to show his teeth and his muscle, whilst the African up on the rostrum would
    with loud voice and profuse gesture point out every line of beauty on a lithe
    body and expatiate on the full play of every powerful muscle.</p>
  <p>The slave thus singled out for show seemed neither resentful nor distressed,
    ready enough most times to exhibit his merits, anxious only for the chance
    of a good master and the momentary avoidance of the lictor&rsquo;s flail.
    At the praefect&rsquo;s bidding he cracked his knuckles or showed his teeth,
    strained the muscles of his arm to make them stand up like cords, turned
    a somersault, jumped, danced or stood on his head if ordered so to do.</p>
  <p>The women were more timid and very frightened of blows, especially the older
    ones; the younger shoulders escaped a chastisement which would have marred
    their beauty, and the pretty maids from Corinth or Carthage, conscious of
    their own charms, displayed them with good-natured <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>,
    deeming obedience the surest way to comfort.</p>
  <p>Nor did the praefect perform his duty with any show of inhumanity or conscious
    cruelty. Himself a wealthy member of the patriciate, second only to the C&aelig;sar,
    with a seat in the Senate and a household full of slaves, he had neither
    horror nor contempt for the state of slavery&mdash;a necessary one in the
    administration of the mightiest Empire in the world.</p>
  <p>Many there were who averred that the praefect of Rome was himself the descendant
    of a freedman&mdash;a prisoner of war brought over by C&aelig;sar from the
    North&mdash;who had amassed wealth and purchased his own freedom. Indeed
    his name proclaimed his foreign origin, for he was called Taurus Antinor
    Anglicanus, and surnamed Niger because of his dark eyes and sun-tanned skin.
    Certain it is that when the sale of Arminius&rsquo; goods was ordered by
    imperial edict for the benefit of the State, no one complained that the praefect
    decided to preside over the sale himself.</p>
  <p>He had discharged such duties before and none had occasion to complain of
    the manner in which he did it. In these days of unbridled excesses and merciless
    outbursts of rage, he remained throughout&mdash;on these occasions&mdash;temperate
    and even impassive.</p>
  <p>He only ordered his lictor to use the flail when necessary, when the bundle
    of human goods was so huddled up that it ceased to look attractive, and likely
    purchasers seemed to fall away. Then, at his command, the heavy thongs would
    descend indiscriminately on the bronze shoulder of an Ethiopian or the fair
    skin of a barbarian from the North; but he gave the order without any show
    of cruelty or passion, just as he heard the responsive cry of pain without
    any outward sign of pity.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;To be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.&rdquo;&mdash;Psalm
    62. 9.</p>
  <p>As the day wore on, trade became more brisk and the work of the lictors
    more arduous, for the crowd was dense and the bargain-hunters eager to push
    to the front.</p>
  <p>Now a bronze-skinned artisan with slender limbs and narrow tapering hands
    was attracting attention. He was standing on the platform, passive and indifferent,
    apparently unconscious alike of the scorching sun which bit into his bare
    flesh, as of the murmurs of the dealers round him and the eloquence of the
    African up on the rostrum, who was shouting himself hoarse in praise of his
    wares.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A leather worker from Hispania,&rdquo; he thundered with persuasive
    rhetoric,  &ldquo;his age but two dozen years, his skill unequalled on either
    bank of the Tiber ... A tunic worked by him is softer than the fleeciest
    wool, and the sheath of a dagger becomes in his hands as hard as steel....
    Good health and strength, two thousand sesterces were a poor price to pay
    for the use of these skilled hands.... Two thousand sesterces.... His lordship&rsquo;s
    grace, the censor Arminius Quirinius paid four thousand for him....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused a moment whilst a couple of Jews from Galilee, in long dark robes
    and black caps covering their shaggy hair, turned critically round this paragon
    from Hispania, lifted his hands and gazed on each finger-tip as if trying
    to find traces on these of that much-vaunted skill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two thousand sesterces, kind sirs, and you will have at your disposal
    the talent of a master in the noble art of leather working; pouches and coverings
    for your chairs, caskets and sword-hilts, nothing comes amiss to him....
    Come! shall we say two thousand sesterces?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Jews were hesitating. With a rapid glance of their keen, deep-set eyes
    they consulted one with the other, whilst their long bony fingers wandered
    hesitatingly to the wallets at their belts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two thousand sesterces!&rdquo; urged the auctioneer, as he looked
    with marked severity on the waverers.</p>
  <p>He himself received a percentage on the proceeds of the sale, a few sesterces
    mayhap that would go to swell the little hoard which ultimately would purchase
    freedom. The scribes stilet in hand waited in patient silence. The praefect,
    indifferent to the whole transaction, was staring straight in front of him,
    like one whose thoughts are strangers to his will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One thousand we&rsquo;ll give,&rdquo; said one of the Jews timidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! an you&rsquo;ll not give more, kind sirs,&rdquo; quoth the auctioneer
    airily,  &ldquo;this paragon among leather workers will bring fortune to
    your rival dealers....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One thousand,&rdquo; repeated one of the intending purchasers, &ldquo;and
    no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The African tried persuasion, contempt, even lofty scorn; he threatened
    to withdraw the paragon from the sale altogether, for he knew of a dealer
    in leather goods over in Corinth who would give two fingers of his own hand
    for the exclusive use of those belonging to this Hispanian treasure.</p>
  <p>But the Jews were obstinate. With the timid obstinacy peculiar to their
    race, they stuck to their point and refused to be enticed into purposeless
    extravagance.</p>
  <p>In the end the wonderful worker in leather was sold to the Jew traders from
    Galilee for the sum of one thousand sesterces; his dark face had expressed
    nothing but stolid indifference whilst the colloquy between the purchasers
    and the auctioneer had been going on.</p>
  <p>The next piece of goods however was in more pressing demand; a solid German,
    with massive thorax half-hidden beneath a shaggy goatskin held in at the
    waist by a belt; his hairy arms bare to the shoulder, his gigantic fists
    clenched as if ready to fell an ox.</p>
  <p>A useful man with plough or harrow, he was said to be skilled in smith&rsquo;s
    work too. After a preliminary and minute examination of the man&rsquo;s muscles,
    of his teeth, of the calves of his legs, bidding became very brisk between
    an agriculturist from Sicilia and a freedman from the Campania, until the
    praefect himself intervened, desiring the slave for his own use on a farm
    which he had near Ostia.</p>
  <p>Some waiting-maids from Jud&aelig;a fetched goodly money; an innkeeper of
    Etruria bought them, for they were well-looking and knew how to handle and
    carry wine jars without shaking up the costly liquor; and the negroes were
    sought after by the lanistae for training to gladiatorial combats.</p>
  <p>Scribes were also in great demand for copying purposes. The disseminators
    of the news of the day were willing to pay high prices for quick shorthand
    writers who had learned their business in the house of Arminius the censor.</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile the throng in the Forum had become more and more dense.
    Already one or two gorgeously draped litters had been seen winding their
    way in from the Sacra Via or the precincts of the temples, their silken draperies
    making positive notes of brilliant colour against the iridescent whiteness
    of Phrygian marble walls.</p>
  <p>The lictors now had at times to use their flails against the crowd. Room
    had to be made for the masters of Rome, the wealthy and the idle, who threw
    sesterces about for the gratification of their smallest whim, as a common
    man would shake the dust from his shoes.</p>
  <p>Young Hortensius Martius, the rich patrician owner of five thousand slaves,
    had stepped out of his litter, and a way being made for him in the crowd
    by his men, he had strolled up to the rostrum, and mounting its first gradient
    he leaned with studied grace against the block of white marble, giving to
    the common herd below the pleasing spectacle of a young exquisite, rich and
    well-favoured&mdash;his handsome person carefully perfumed and bedecked after
    the morning bath, his crisp fair hair daintily curled, his body clad in a
    tunic of soft white wool splendidly worked in purple stripes, the insignia
    of his high patrician state.</p>
  <p>He passed a languid eye over the bundle of humanity spread out for sale
    at his feet and gave courteous greeting to the praefect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art early abroad, Hortensius Martius,&rdquo; quoth Taurus Antinor
    in response; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not often thou dost grace the Forum with thy
    presence at this hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They told me it would be amusing,&rdquo; replied young Hortensius
    lazily,  &ldquo;but methinks that they lied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He yawned, and with a tiny golden tool he began picking his teeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did they tell thee?&rdquo; queried the other, &ldquo;and who
    were they that told?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was Caius Nepos and young Escanes, and several others at the
    bath. They were all talking about the sale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are they coming hither?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They will be here anon; but some declared that much rubbish would
    have to be sold ere the choice bargains be put up. Escanes wants a cook who
    can fry a capon in a special way they wot of in Gaul. Stuffed with ortolans
    and covered with the juice of three melons&mdash;Escanes says it is mightily
    pleasing to the palate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no cook from Gaul on the list,&rdquo; interposed the praefect
    curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Caius Nepos wants some well-favoured girls to wait on his guests
    at supper to-morrow. He gives a banquet, as thou knowest. Wilt be there,
    Taurus Antinor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had spoken these last words in a curious manner which suggested that
    some significance other than mere conviviality would be attached to the banquet
    given by Caius Nepos on the morrow. And now he drew nearer to the praefect
    and cast a quick glance around him as if to assure himself that the business
    of the sale was engrossing everyone&rsquo;s attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caius Nepos,&rdquo; he said, trying to speak with outward indifference,  &ldquo;asked
    me to tell thee that if thou wilt come to his banquet to-morrow thou wilt
    find it to thine advantage. Many of us are of one mind with regard to certain
    matters and could talk these over undisturbed. Wilt join us, Taurus Antinor?&rdquo; he
    added eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Join you,&rdquo; retorted the other with a grim smile, &ldquo;join
    you in what? in this senseless folly of talking in whispers in public places?
    The Forum this day is swarming with spies, Hortensius Martius. Hast a wish
    to make a spectacle for the plebs on the morrow by being thrown to a pack
    of tigers for their midday meal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with a nod of his head he pointed up to the rostrum where the dusky
    auctioneer had momentarily left off shouting and had thrown himself flat
    down upon the matting, ostensibly in order to speak with one of the scribes
    on the tier below, but who was in reality casting furtive glances in the
    direction where Hortensius Martius stood talking with the praefectus.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These slaves,&rdquo; said Taurus Antinor curtly, &ldquo;all belong
    to the imperial treasury; their peculium is entirely made up of money gained
    through giving information&mdash;both false and true. Have a care, O Hortensius
    Martius!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the other shrugged his shoulders with well-studied indifference. It
    was not the mode at this epoch to seem anything but bored at all the circumstances
    of public and private life in Rome, at the simple occurrences of daily routine
    or at the dangers which threatened every man through the crazy whims of a
    demented despot.</p>
  <p>It had even become the fashion to accept outwardly and without the slightest
    show of interest the wild extravagances and insane debaucheries of the ferocious
    tyrant who for the nonce wielded the sceptre of the C&aelig;sars. The young
    patricians of the day looked on with apparent detachment at his excesses
    and the savage displays of unbridled power of which he was so inordinately
    fond, and they affected a lofty disregard for the horrible acts of injustice
    and of cruelty which this half-crazy Emperor had rendered familiar to the
    citizens of Rome.</p>
  <p>Nothing in the daily routine of life amused these votaries of fashion&mdash;nothing
    roused them from their attitude of somnolent placidity, except perhaps some
    peculiarly bloody combat in the arena&mdash;one of those unfettered orgies
    of lust of blood which they loved to witness and which have for ever disgraced
    the glorious pages of Roman history.</p>
  <p>Then horror would rouse them for a brief moment from their apathy, for they
    were not cruel, only satiated with every sight, every excitement and luxury
    which their voluptuous city and the insane caprice of the imperator perpetually
    offered them; and they thirsted for horrors as a sane man thirsts for beauty,
    that it might cause a diversion in the even tenor of their lives, and mayhap
    raise a thrill in their dormant brains.</p>
  <p>Therefore even now, when apparently he was toying with his life, Hortensius
    Martius did not depart outwardly from the attitude of supercilious indifference
    which fashion demanded. They were all actors, these men, always before an
    audience, and even among themselves they never really left off acting the
    part which they had made so completely their own.</p>
  <p>But that the indifference was only on the surface was evidenced in this
    instance by the young exquisite&rsquo;s scarce perceptible change of position.
    He drew away slightly from the praefect and anon said in a loud tone of voice
    so that all around him might hear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! as thou sayest, Taurus Antinor, I might find a dwarf or some
    kind of fool to suit me. Mine are getting old and dull. Ye gods, how they
    bore me at times!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And it was in a whisper that he added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caius Nepos specially desired thy presence at supper to-morrow, O
    Taurus Antinor! He feared that he might not get speech with thee anon, so
    hath asked me to make sure of thy presence. Thou&rsquo;lt not fail us? There
    are over forty of us now, all prepared to give our lives for the good of
    the Empire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The praefect made no reply this time; his attention was evidently engrossed
    by some close bidding over a useful slave, but as Hortensius now finally
    turned away from him, his dark eyes under the shadow of that perpetual frown
    swept over the figure of the young exquisite, from the crown of the curled
    and perfumed head to the soles of the daintily shod feet, and a smile of
    contempt not altogether unkind played round the corners of his firm lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the good of the Empire?&rdquo; he murmured under his breath as
    he shrugged his broad shoulders and once more turned his attention to his
    duties.</p>
  <p>Hortensius in the meanwhile had spied some of his friends. Gorgeously embroidered
    tunics could now be seen all the time pushing their way through the more
    common crowd, and soon a compact group of rich patricians had congregated
    around the rostra.</p>
  <p>They had come one by one&mdash;from the baths mostly&mdash;refreshed and
    perfumed, ready to gaze with fashionable lack of interest on the spectacle
    of this public auction. They had exchanged greetings with the praefect and
    with Hortensius Martius. They all knew one another, were all members of the
    same caste, the ruling caste of Rome. Young Escanes was now there, he who
    wanted a cook, and Caius Nepos&mdash;the praetorian praefect who was in search
    of pretty waiting-maids.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hast had speech with Anglicanus?&rdquo; asked the latter in a whisper
    to Hortensius.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! a few words,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;but he warned
    me of spies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will he join us, thinkest thou?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that he will sup with thee, O Caius Nepos, but as to joining
    us in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; admonished the praetorian praefect, &ldquo;Taurus Antinor
    is right. There are spies all around here to-day. But if he comes to supper
    we&rsquo;ll persuade him, never fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with a final significant nod the two men parted and once more mixed
    with the crowd.</p>
  <p>More than one high-born lady now had ordered her bearers to set her litter
    down close to the rostrum whence she could watch the sale, and mayhap make
    a bid for a purchase on her own account; the rich Roman matrons with large
    private fortunes and households of their own, imperious and independent,
    were the object of grave deference and of obsequious courtesy&mdash;not altogether
    unmixed with irony, on the part of the young men around them.</p>
  <p>They did not mix with the crowd but remained in their litters, reclining
    on silken cushions, their dark tunics and richly coloured stoles standing
    out in sombre notes against the more gaily-decked-out gilded youth of Rome,
    whilst their serious and oft-times stern manner, their measured and sober
    speech, seemed almost set in studied opposition to the idle chattering, the
    flippant tone, the bored affectation of the outwardly more robust sex.</p>
  <p>And among them all Taurus Antinor, praefect of Rome, with his ruddy hair
    and bronzed skin, his massive frame clad in gorgeously embroidered tunic,
    his whole appearance heavy and almost rough, in strange contrast alike to
    the young decadents of the day as to the rigid primness of the patrician
    matrons, just as his harsh, even voice seemed to dominate the lazy and mellow
    trebles of the votaries of fashion.</p>

  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>The auctioneer had in the meanwhile cast a quick comprehensive glance over
    his wares, throwing an admonition here, a command there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That yellow hair&mdash;let it hang, woman! do not touch it I say....
    Slip that goatskin off thy loins, man ... By Jupiter &rsquo;tis the best
    of thee thou hidest.... Hold thy chin up girl, we&rsquo;ll have no doleful
    faces to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sometimes his admonition required more vigorous argument. The praefect was
    appealed to against the recalcitrant. Then the harsh unimpassioned voice
    with its curious intonation in the pronouncing of the Latin words, would
    give a brief order and the lictor&rsquo;s flail would whizz in the air and
    descend with a short sharp whistling sound on obstinately bowed shoulder
    or unwilling hand, and the auctioneer would continue his perorations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What will it please my lord&rsquo;s grace to buy this day? A skilled
    horseman from Dacia?... I have one.... A pearl.... He can mount an untamed
    steed and drive a chariot in treble harness through the narrowest streets
    of Rome.... He can ... What&mdash;no?&mdash;not a horseman to-day?... then
    mayhap a hunchback acrobat from Pannonia, bronzed as the tanned hide of an
    ox, with arms so long that his finger-nails will scrape the ground as he
    runs; he can turn a back somersault, walk the tight-rope, or ... Here, Pipus
    the hunchback, show thine ugly face to my lord&rsquo;s grace, maybe thou&rsquo;lt
    help to dissipate the frown between my Lord&rsquo;s eyes, maybe my lord&rsquo;s
    grace will e&rsquo;en smile at thine antics.... Turn then, show thy hump, &rsquo;tis
    worth five hundred sesterces, my lord ... turn again ... see my lord, is
    he not like an ape?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My lord was smiling, so the auctioneer prattled on, and the deformed creature
    upon the catasta wound his ill-shapen body into every kind of contortion,
    grinning from ear to ear, displaying the malformation of his spine, and the
    hideousness of his long hairy arms, whilst he uttered weird cries that were
    supposed to imitate those of wild animals in the forest.</p>
  <p>These antics caused my lord to smile outright. He was willing to expend
    two thousand sesterces in order to have such a creature about his house,
    to have him ready to call when his guests seemed dull between the courses
    of a sumptuous meal. The deal was soon concluded and the hunchback transferred
    from the platform to the keeping of my lord&rsquo;s slaves, and thence to
    my lord&rsquo;s household.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Fairer than the children of men.&rdquo;&mdash;Psalm 45. 2.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hun Rhavas, dost mind thy promise made to Menecreta?&rdquo; whispered
    a timid voice in the African&rsquo;s ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, aye!&rdquo; he replied curtly, &ldquo;I had not forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a lull in the trade whilst the scribes were making entries on
    their tablets.</p>
  <p>The auctioneer had descended from the rostrum. Panting after his exertions,
    perspiring profusely under the heat of the noonday sun, he was wiping the
    moisture from his dripping forehead and incidentally refreshing his parched
    throat with copious drafts from out a leather bottle.</p>
  <p>His swarthy skin streaming with perspiration shone in the glare of the noonday
    sun like the bronze statue of mother-wolf up aloft.</p>
  <p>An elderly woman in rough linen tunic, her hair hidden beneath a simple
    cloth, had succeeded in engaging his attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It had been better to put the child up for sale an hour ago, whilst
    these rich folk were still at the bath,&rdquo; she said with a tone of reproach
    in her gentle voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was not my fault,&rdquo; rejoined the African curtly, &ldquo;she
    comes one of the last on the list. The praefect made out the lists. Thou
    shouldst have spoken to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh I should never dare,&rdquo; she replied, her voice trembling at
    the mere suggestion of such boldness, &ldquo;but I did promise thee five
    aurei if I succeeded in purchasing the child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; quoth the African with a nod of satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My own child, Hun Rhavas,&rdquo; continued the pleading voice; &ldquo;think
    on it, for thou too hast children of thine own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I purchased my son&rsquo;s freedom only last year,&rdquo; acquiesced
    the slave with a touch of pride. &ldquo;Next year, an the gods will, it shall
    be my daughter&rsquo;s and after that mine own. In three years from now we
    shall all be free.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art a man; &rsquo;tis more easy for thee to make money. It took
    me six years to save up twenty-five aurei which should purchase my child:
    twenty for her price, five for thy reward, for thou alone canst help me,
    an thou wilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve done all I could for thee, Menecreta,&rdquo; retorted
    Hun Rhavas somewhat impatiently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken the titulus from
    off her neck and set the hat over her head, and that was difficult enough
    for the praefect&rsquo;s eyes are very sharp. Ten aurei should be the highest
    bid for a maid without guarantees as to skill, health or condition. And as
    she is not over well-favoured&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But this the mother would not admit. In weary and querulous tones she began
    expatiating on the merits of her daughter: her fair hair, her graceful neck&mdash;until
    the African, bored and impatient, turned on her roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! an thy daughter hath so many perfections, thou&rsquo;lt not
    purchase her for twenty aurei. Fifty and sixty will be bid for her, and what
    can I do then to help thee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hun Rhavas,&rdquo; said Menecreta in a sudden spirit of conciliation, &ldquo;thou
    must not heed a mother&rsquo;s fancies. To me the child is beautiful beyond
    compare. Are not thine own in thy sight beautiful as a midsummer&rsquo;s
    day?&rdquo; she added with subtle hypocrisy, thinking of the ugly little
    Africans of whom Hun Rhavas was so proud.</p>
  <p>Her motherly heart was prepared for every sacrifice, every humiliation,
    so long as she obtained what she wanted&mdash;possession of her child. Arminius
    Quirinius had given her her freedom some three years ago, but this seeming
    act of grace had been a cruel one since it had parted the mother from her
    child. The late censor had deemed Menecreta old, feeble, and therefore useless:
    she was but a worthless mouth to feed; but he kept the girl not because she
    was well-favoured or very useful in his house, but because he knew that Menecreta
    would work her fingers to the bone until she saved enough money to purchase
    her daughter&rsquo;s freedom.</p>
  <p>Arminius Quirinius, ever grasping for money, ever ready for any act of cupidity
    or oppression, knew that from the mother he could extract a far higher sum
    than the girl could possibly fetch in the open market. He had fixed her price
    as fifty aurei, and Menecreta had saved just one half that amount when fate
    and the vengeance of the populace overtook the extortioner. All his slaves&mdash;save
    the most valuable&mdash;were thrown on the market, and the patient, hard-working
    mother saw the fulfilment of her hopes well within sight.</p>
  <p>It was but a question of gaining Hun Rhavas&rsquo; ear and of tempting his
    greed. The girl, publicly offered under unfavourable conditions, and unbacked
    by the auctioneer&rsquo;s laudatory harangues, could easily be knocked down
    for twenty aurei or even less.</p>
  <p>But Menecreta&rsquo;s heart was torn with anxiety the while she watched
    the progress of the sale. Every one of these indifferent spectators might
    become an enemy through taking a passing fancy to her child. These young
    patricians, these stern matrons, they had neither remorse nor pity where
    the gratification of a whim was at stake.</p>
  <p>And was not the timid, fair-haired girl more beautiful in the mother&rsquo;s
    eyes than any other woman put up on the platform for the purpose of rousing
    a momentary caprice.</p>
  <p>She gazed with jealous eyes on the young idlers and the high-born ladies,
    the possible foes who yet might part her from the child. And there was the
    praefect too, all-powerful in the matter.</p>
  <p>If he saw through the machinations of Hun Rhavas nothing would save the
    girl from being put up like all the others as the law directed, with the
    proper tablet attached to her neck, describing her many charms. Taurus Antinor
    was not cruel but he was pitiless. The slaves of his household knew that,
    as did the criminals brought to his tribunal. He never inflicted unnecessary
    punishment but when it was deserved he was relentless in its execution.</p>
  <p>What hope could a poor mother have against the weight of his authority.</p>
  <p>Fortunately the morning was rapidly wearing on. The hour for the midday
    rest was close at hand. Menecreta could watch, with a glad thrill in her
    heart, one likely purchaser after another being borne in gorgeously draped
    litter away from this scene of a mother&rsquo;s cruel anxiety. Already the
    ladies had withdrawn. Now there was only a group of men left around the rostrum;
    Hortensius Martius still lounging aimlessly, young Escanes who had not yet
    found the paragon amongst cooks, and a few others who eyed the final proceedings
    with the fashionable expression of boredom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder we have not seen Dea Flavia this day,&rdquo; remarked Escanes
    to the praefect. &ldquo;Dost think she&rsquo;ll come, Taurus Antinor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I know not,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;truly she cannot be in
    need of slaves. She has more than she can know what to do with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; rejoined the other, &ldquo;of a truth she has slaves enough.
    But &rsquo;tis this new craze of hers! She seems to be in need of innumerable
    models for the works of art she hath on hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, &rsquo;tis no new craze,&rdquo; interposed Hortensius Martius,
    whose fresh young face had flushed very suddenly as if in anger. &ldquo;Dea
    Flavia, as thou knowest full well, Escanes, hath fashioned exquisite figures
    both in marble and in clay even whilst thou didst waste thy boyhood in drunken
    revelries. She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A truce on thine ill-temper,&rdquo; broke in Escanes with a good-humoured
    laugh. &ldquo;I had no thought of disparagement for Dea Flavia&rsquo;s genius.
    The gods forbid!&rdquo;  he added with mock fervour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then dost deserve that I force thee down to thy knees,&rdquo; retorted
    Hortensius, not yet mollified, &ldquo;to make public acknowledgment of Dea
    Flavia&rsquo;s beauty, her talents and her virtues, and public confession
    of thine own unworthiness in allowing her hallowed name to pass thy wine-sodden
    lips.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Escanes uttered a cry of rage; in a moment these two&mdash;friends and boon
    companions&mdash;appeared as bitter enemies. Hortensius Martius, the perfumed
    exquisite, was now like an angry cockbird on the defence, whilst Escanes,
    taller and stronger than he, was clenching his fists, trying to keep up that
    outward semblance of patrician decorum which the dignity of his caste demanded
    in the presence of the plebs.</p>
  <p>Who knows how long this same semblance would have been kept up on this occasion?
    for Hortensius Martius, obviously a slave to Dea Flavia&rsquo;s beauty, was
    ready to do battle for the glorification of his idol, whilst Escanes, smarting
    under the clumsy insult, had much ado to keep his rage within bounds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you cut one another&rsquo;s throats now,&rdquo; interposed the
    praefect curtly,  &ldquo;&rsquo;twill be in the presence of Dea Flavia herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even whilst he spoke a litter gorgeously carved and gilded, draped in rose
    pink and gold, was seen slowly winding its way from the rear of the basilica
    and along the Vicus Tuscus, towards the Forum. In a moment all eyes were
    turned in its direction; the two young men either forgot their quarrel or
    were ashamed to prolong it in the presence of its cause.</p>
  <p>Now the litter turned into the open. It was borne by eight gigantic Ethiopians
    whose mighty shoulders were bare to the sun, and all round and behind it
    a crowd of slaves, of clients, of sycophants followed in its trail, men running
    beside the litter, women shouting, children waving sprays of flowers and
    fans of feathers and palm leaves, whilst the air was filled with cries from
    innumerable throats:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Augusta! Augusta! Room for Dea Flavia Augusta.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The retinue of Dea Flavia of the imperial house of the C&aelig;sars was
    the most numerous in Rome.</p>
  <p>At word of command no doubt the bearers put the litter down quite close
    to the rostrum even whilst four young girls stepped forward and drew the
    silken curtains aside.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia was resting against the cushions; her tiny feet in shoes of gilded
    leather were stretched out on a coverlet of purple silk richly wrought with
    gold and silver threads. Her elbow was buried in the fleecy down of the cushions;
    her head rested against her hand.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia, imperial daughter of Rome, what tongue of poet could describe
    thy beauty? what hand of artist paint its elusiveness?</p>
  <p>Have not the writers of the time told us all there was to tell? and exhausted
    language in their panegyrics: the fair hair like rippling gold, the eyes
    now blue, now green, always grey and mysterious, the delicate hands, the
    voluptuous throat, those tiny ears ever filled with flattery?</p>
  <p>But methinks that the carping critic was right when he deemed that the beauty
    of her face was marred by the scornful glance of the eyes and the ever rigid
    lines of the mouth. There was those who had dared aver that Dea Flavia&rsquo;s
    snow-white neck had been more beautiful if it had known how to bend, and
    that the glory of her eyes would be enhanced a thousandfold when once they
    learned how to weep.</p>
  <p>This, however, was only the opinion of very few, of those in fact who never
    had received the slightest favour from Dea Flavia; those on whom she smiled&mdash;with
    that proud, cold smile of hers&mdash;fell an over-ready victim to her charm.
    And she had smiled more than once on Hortensius Martius, and he, poor fool!
    had quickly lost his head.</p>
  <p>Now that she was present he soon forgot his quarrel; neither Escanes nor
    the rest of the world existed since Dea Flavia was nigh. He pushed his way
    through her crowd of courtiers and was the first to reach her litter even
    as she put her dainty feet to the ground.</p>
  <p>Escanes too and Caius Nepos, and Philippus Decius and the other young men
    there, forgot the excitement of the aborted quarrel and pressed forward to
    pay their respects to Dea Flavia.</p>
  <p>The aspect of her court was changed in a moment. Her lictors chased the
    importunate crowd away, making room for the masters of Rome who desired speech
    with their mistress. The rough and sombre garments of the slaves showed in
    the background now, and all round the litter tunics and mantles of fleecy
    wool gorgeously embroidered in crimson and gold, or stripes of purple, crowded
    in eager medley.</p>
  <p>All at once too the immediate neighbourhood of the rostrum was deserted,
    the human chattels forgotten in the anxious desire to catch sight of the
    great lady whom the C&aelig;sar himself had styled Augusta&mdash;thus exalting
    her above all women in Rome. Her boundless wealth and lavish expenditure,
    as well as her beauty and acknowledged virtue, had been the talk of the city
    ever since the death of her father, Octavius Claudius of the House of Augusta
    C&aelig;sar, had placed her under the immediate tutelage of the C&aelig;sar
    and left her&mdash;young and beautiful as she was&mdash;in possession of
    one of the largest fortunes in the Empire. No wonder then that whenever her
    rose-draped litter was perceived in the streets of Rome a crowd of idlers
    and of sycophants pressed around it, curious to see the queen of society
    and anxious to catch her ear.</p>
  <p>This same instant of momentary excitement became that of renewed hope for
    an anxious mother&rsquo;s heart. Menecreta, with the keenness of her ardent
    desire, had at once grasped her opportunity. Hun Rhavas fortunately glanced
    down in her direction. He too no doubt saw the possibilities of this moment
    of general confusion. The five aurei promised him by Menecreta sharpened
    his resourceful wits. He signalled to one of the lictors below&mdash;an accomplice
    too, I imagine, in this transaction&mdash;and whilst a chorus of obsequious
    greetings round Dea Flavia&rsquo;s litter filled the noonday air like the
    hum of bees, a pale-faced, delicate-looking girl was quickly pushed up on
    to the platform.</p>
  <p>Hun Rhavas very perfunctorily declaimed her age and status.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of no known skill,&rdquo; he said, mumbling his words and talking
    very rapidly,  &ldquo;since my lord&rsquo;s grace the late censor had made
    no use of her. Shall we say ten aurei for the girl? she might be made to
    learn a trade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the auctioneer started on his peroration those among the crowd who were
    here for business, and not for idle gaping, turned back towards the catasta.
    But the little maid who stood there so still, her hair entirely hidden by
    the ungainly hat, her head bent and her eyes downcast, did not seem very
    attractive; the lack of guarantee as to her skill and merits represented
    by the hat and the absence of the tablet round her neck caused the buyers
    to stand aloof.</p>
  <p>As if conscious of this, a deep blush suffused the girl&rsquo;s cheeks.
    Not that she was ashamed of her position or of her exposure before the public
    gaze, for to this ordeal her whole upbringing had tended. Born in slavery,
    she had always envisaged this possibility, and her present position caused
    her in itself neither pain nor humiliation.</p>
  <p>She knew that her mother was there in the crowd, ready for this opportunity;
    that the present state of discomfort, the past life of wretchedness would
    now inevitably be followed by a brighter future: reunion with her mother,
    a life of freedom, mayhap of happiness, marriage right out of the state of
    bondage, children born free!</p>
  <p>No! it was not the gaping crowd that mattered, the exposure on the public
    platform, the many pairs of indifferent eyes fixed none too kindly upon her:
    it was that hat upon her head which brought forth in her such a sense of
    shame that the hot blood rushed to her cheeks; that, and the absence of the
    tablet round her neck, and Hun Rhavas&rsquo; disparaging words about her
    person.</p>
  <p>Others there had been earlier in the day&mdash;her former companions in
    Arminius&rsquo;  household&mdash;on whom the auctioneer had lavished torrents
    of eloquent praise, whom for the first bidding he had appraised at forty
    or even fifty aurei, the public being over willing to pay higher sums than
    those.</p>
  <p>Whilst here she stood shamed before them all, with no guarantee as to her
    skill and talents, though she knew something about the art of healing by
    rubbing unguents into the skin, could ply her needle and dress a lady&rsquo;s
    hair. Nor was a word said about her beauty, though her eyes were blue and
    her neck slender and white; and her hair, which was of a pretty shade of
    gold, could not even be seen under that hideous, unbecoming hat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten aurei shall we say?&rdquo; said Hun Rhavas with remarkable want
    of enthusiasm;  &ldquo;kind sirs, is there no one ready to say fifteen? The
    girl might be taught to sew or to trim a lady&rsquo;s nails. She may be unskilled
    now but she might learn&mdash;providing that her health be good,&rdquo; he
    added with studied indifference.</p>
  <p>The latter phrase proved a cunning one. The few likely buyers who had been
    attracted to the catasta by the youthful appearance of the girl&mdash;hoping
    to find willingness, even if skill were wanting&mdash;now quickly drew away.</p>
  <p>Of a truth there was no guarantee as to her health and a sick slave was
    a burden and a nuisance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten aurei then,&rdquo; said Hun Rhavas raising the hammer, whilst
    with hungry eyes the mother watched his every movement.</p>
  <p>A few more seconds of this agonising suspense! Oh! ye gods, how this waiting
    hurts! She pressed her hands against her side where a terrible pain turned
    her nearly giddy.</p>
  <p>Only a second or two whilst the hammer was poised in mid air and Hun Rhavas&rsquo; furtive
    glance darted on the praefect to see if he were still indifferent! Menecreta
    prayed with all her humble might to the proud gods enthroned upon the hill!
    she prayed that this cycle of agony might end at last for she could not endure
    it longer. She prayed that that cruel hammer might descend and her child
    be delivered over to her at last.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.&rdquo;&mdash;Proverbs 13. 12.</p>
  <p>Alas, the Roman gods are the gods of the patricians! They take so little
    heed of the sorrows and the trials of poor freedmen and slaves!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who ordered the hat to be put on this girl&rsquo;s head?&rdquo; suddenly
    interposed the harsh voice of the praefect.</p>
  <p>He had not moved away from the rostrum all the while that the throng of
    obsequious sycophants and idle lovesick youths had crowded round Dea Flavia.
    Now he spoke over his shoulder at Hun Rhavas, who had no thought, whilst
    his comfortable little plot was succeeding so well, that the praefect was
    paying heed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She hath no guarantee, as my lord&rsquo;s grace himself hath knowledge,&rdquo;  said
    the African with anxious humility.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! thou liest as to my knowledge of it,&rdquo; said Taurus Antinor. &ldquo;Where
    is the list of goods compiled by the censor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Three pairs of willing hands were ready with the parchment rolls which the
    praefect had commanded; one was lucky enough to place them in his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the girl&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; he asked as his deep-set eyes,
    under their perpetual frown, ran down the minute writing on the parchment
    roll.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nola, the daughter of Menecreta, my lord,&rdquo; said one of the
    scribes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not see the name of Nola, daughter of Menecreta, amongst those
    whom the State doth not guarantee for skill, health or condition,&rdquo; rejoined
    the praefect quietly, and his rough voice, scarcely raised above its ordinary
    pitch, seemed to ring a death-knell in poor Menecreta&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nola, the daughter of Menecreta,&rdquo; he continued, once more referring
    to the parchment in his hand, &ldquo;is here described as sixteen years of
    age, of sound health and robust constitution, despite the spareness of her
    body. The censor who compiled this list states that she has a fair knowledge
    of the use of unguents and of herbs, that she can use a needle and plait
    a lady&rsquo;s hair. Thou didst know all this, Hun Rhavas, for the duplicate
    list is before thee even now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord&rsquo;s grace,&rdquo; murmured Hun Rhavas, his voice quivering
    now, his limbs shaking with the fear in him, &ldquo;I did not know&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou didst endeavour to defraud the State for purposes of thine own,&rdquo;  interposed
    the praefect calmly. &ldquo;Here! thou!&rdquo; he added, beckoning to one
    of his lictors, &ldquo;take this man to the Regia and hand him over to the
    chief warder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord&rsquo;s grace&mdash;&rdquo; cried Hun Rhavas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence! To-morrow thou&rsquo;lt appear before me in the basilica.
    Bring thy witnesses then if thou hast any to speak in thy defence. To-morrow
    thou canst plead before me any circumstance which might mitigate thy fault
    and stay my lips from condemning thee to that severe chastisement which crimes
    against the State deserve. In the meanwhile hold thy peace. I&rsquo;ll not
    hear another word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But it was not in the negro&rsquo;s blood to submit to immediate punishment
    now and certain chastisement in the future without vigorous protestations
    and the generous use of his powerful lungs. The praefect&rsquo;s sentences
    in the tribunal where he administered justice were not characterised by leniency;
    the galleys, the stone-quarries, aye! even the cross were all within the
    bounds of possibility, whilst the scourge was an absolute certainty.</p>
  <p>Hun Rhavas set up a succession of howls which echoed from temple to temple,
    from one end of the Forum to the other.</p>
  <p>The frown on the praefect&rsquo;s forehead became even more marked than
    before. He had seen the young idlers&mdash;who, but a moment ago, were fawning
    round Dea Flavia&rsquo;s litter&mdash;turning eagerly back towards the rostrum,
    where Hun Rhavas&rsquo; cries and moans had suggested the likelihood of one
    of those spectacles of wanton and purposeless cruelty in which their perverted
    senses found such constant delight.</p>
  <p>But this spectacle Taurus Antinor was not like to give them. All he wanted
    was the quick restoration of peace and order. The fraudulent auctioneer was
    naught in his sight but a breaker of the law. As such he was deserving of
    such punishment as the law decreed and no more. But his howls just now were
    the means of rousing in the hearts of the crowd that most despicable of all
    passions to which the Roman&mdash;the master of civilisation&mdash;was a
    prey&mdash;the love of seeing some creature, man or beast, in pain, a passion
    which brought the Roman citizen down to the level of the brute: therefore
    Taurus Antinor wished above all to silence Hun Rhavas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One more sound from thy throat and I&rsquo;ll have thee scourged
    now and branded ere thy trial,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>The threat was sufficient. The negro, feeling that in submission lay his
    chief hope of mercy on the morrow, allowed himself to be led away quietly
    whilst the young patricians&mdash;cheated of an anticipated pleasure&mdash;protested
    audibly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And thou, Cheiron,&rdquo; continued the praefect, addressing a fair-skinned
    slave up on the rostrum who had been assistant hitherto in the auction, &ldquo;do
    thou take the place vacated by Hun Rhavas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave a few quick words of command to the lictors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take the hat from off that girl&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
    put the inscribed tablet round her neck. Then she can be set up for sale
    as the State hath decreed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As if moved by clockwork one of the lictors approached the girl and removed
    the unbecoming hat from her head, releasing a living stream of gold which,
    as it rippled over the girl&rsquo;s shoulders, roused a quick cry of admiration
    in the crowd.</p>
  <p>In a moment Menecreta realised that her last hope must yield to the inevitable
    now. Even whilst her accomplice, Hun Rhavas, received the full brunt of the
    praefect&rsquo;s wrath she had scarcely dared to breathe, scarcely felt that
    she lived in this agony of fear. Her child still stood there on the platform,
    disfigured by the ugly headgear, obviously most unattractive to the crowd;
    nor did the awful possibility at first present itself to her mind that all
    her schemes for obtaining possession of her daughter could come to naught.
    It was so awful, so impossible of conception that the child should here,
    to-day, pass out of the mother&rsquo;s life for ever and without hope of
    redemption; that she should become the property of a total stranger who might
    for ever refuse to part from her again&mdash;an agriculturist, mayhap, who
    lived far off in Ethuria or Macedon&mdash;and that she, the mother, could
    never, never, hope to see her daughter again&mdash;that was a thought which
    was so horrible that its very horror seemed to render its realisation impossible.</p>
  <p>But now the praefect, with that harsh, pitiless voice of his, was actually
    ordering the girl to be sold in the usual way, with all her merits exhibited
    to the likely purchaser: her golden hair&mdash;a perfect glory&mdash;to tempt
    the artistic eye, her skill recounted in fulsomeness, her cleverness with
    the needle, her knowledge of healing herbs.</p>
  <p>The mother suddenly felt that every one in that cruel gaping crowd must
    be pining to possess such a treasure, that the combined wealth of every citizen
    of Rome would be lavished in this endeavour to obtain the great prize. The
    praefect himself, mayhap, would bid for her, or the imperator&rsquo;s agents!&mdash;alas!
    everything seemed possible to the anxious, the ridiculous, the sublime heart
    of the doting mother, and when that living mass of golden ripples glimmered
    in the noonday sun, Menecreta&mdash;forgetting her timidity, her fears, her
    weakness&mdash;pushed her way through the crowd with all the strength of
    her despair, and with a cry of agonised entreaty, threw herself at the feet
    of the praefect of Rome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord&rsquo;s grace, have mercy! have pity! I entreat thee! In
    the name of the gods, of thy mother, of thy child if thou hast one, have
    pity on me! have pity! have pity!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lictors had sprung forward in a moment and tried to seize the woman
    who had dared to push her way to the praefect&rsquo;s closely guarded presence,
    and was crouching there, her arms encircling his thighs, her face pressed
    close against his knees. One of the men raised his flail and brought it down
    with cruel strength on her thinly covered shoulders, but she did not heed
    the blow, mayhap she never felt it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who ordered thee to strike?&rdquo; said Taurus Antinor sternly to
    the lictor who already had the flail raised for the second time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The woman doth molest my lord&rsquo;s grace,&rdquo; protested the
    man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have I said so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, my lord&mdash;but I thought to do my duty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That thought will cost thee ten such lashes with the rods as thou
    didst deal this woman. By Jupiter!&rdquo; he added roughly, whilst for the
    first time a look of ferocity as that of an angry beast lit up the impassiveness
    of his deep-set eyes, &rdquo;if this turmoil continues I&rsquo;ll have every
    slave here flogged till he bleed. Is the business of the State to be hindered
    by the howlings of this miserable rabble? Get thee gone, woman,&rdquo; he
    cried finally, looking down on prostrate Menecreta, &ldquo;get thee gone
    ere my lictors do thee further harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she, with the obstinacy of a great sorrow, clung to his knees and would
    not move.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord&rsquo;s grace, have pity&mdash;&rsquo;tis my child; an thou
    takest her from me thou&rsquo;lt part those whom the gods themselves have
    united&mdash;&rsquo;tis my child, my lord! hast no children of thine own?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What dost prate about?&rdquo; he asked, still speaking roughly for
    he was wroth with her and hated to see the gaping crowd of young, empty-headed
    fools congregating round him and this persistent suppliant hanging round
    his shins. &ldquo;Thy child? who&rsquo;s thy child? And what hath thy child
    to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is but a babe, my lord,&rdquo; said Menecreta with timid, tender
    voice;  &ldquo;her age only sixteen. A hand-maiden she was to Arminius Quirinius,
    who gave the miserable mother her freedom but kept the daughter so that he
    might win good money by and by through the selling of the child. My lord&rsquo;s
    grace, I have toiled for six years that in the end I might buy my daughter&rsquo;s
    freedom. Fifty aurei did Arminius Quirinius demand as her price and I worked
    my fingers to the bone so that in time I might save that money. But Arminius
    Quirinius is dead and I have only twenty aurei. With the hat of disgrace
    on her head the child could have been knocked down to me&mdash;but now! now!
    look at her, my lord, how beautiful she is! and I have only twenty aurei!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor had listened quite patiently to Menecreta&rsquo;s tale. His
    sun-tanned face clearly showed how hard he was trying to gather up the tangled
    threads of her scrappy narrative. Nor did the lictors this time try to interfere
    with the woman. The praefect apparently was in no easy temper to-day, and
    when ill-humour seized him rods and flails were kept busy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And why didst not petition me before?&rdquo; he asked, after a while,
    when Menecreta paused in order to draw breath.</p>
  <p>And his face looked so fierce, his voice sounded so rough, no wonder the
    poor woman trembled as she whispered through her tears:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not dare, my lord&mdash;I did not dare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet thou didst dare openly to outrage the law!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wanted my child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how many aurei didst promise to Hun Rhavas for helping thee to
    defraud the State?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only five, my lord,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;not only didst thou conspire
    to cheat the State for whose benefit the sale of the late censor&rsquo;s
    goods was ordered by imperial decree, but thou didst bribe another&mdash;a
    slave of the treasury&mdash;to aid and abet thee in this fraud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Menecreta&rsquo;s grasp round the praefect&rsquo;s knees did not relax and
    he made no movement to free himself, but her head fell sideways against her
    shoulder whilst her lips murmured in tones of utter despair:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wanted my child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For thy delinquencies,&rdquo; resumed the praefect, seemingly not
    heeding the pathetic appeal, &ldquo;thou shalt appear before my tribunal
    on the morrow like unto Hun Rhavas thine accomplice, and thou shalt then
    be punished no less than thou deservest. But this is no place for the delivery
    of my judgment upon thee, and the sale must proceed as the law directs; thy
    daughter must stand upon the catasta, thou canst renew thy bid of twenty
    aurei for her, and,&rdquo; he added with unmistakable significance, as throwing
    his head back his imperious glance swept over the assembled crowd,  &ldquo;as
    there will be no higher bid for Nola, daughter of Menecreta, she will become
    thy property as by law decreed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The true meaning of this last sentence was quite unmistakable. The crowd
    who had gathered round the rostrum to watch, gaping, the moving incident,
    looked on the praefect and understood no one was to bid for Nola, the daughter
    of Menecreta. Taurus Antinor, surnamed Anglicanus, had spoken and it would
    not be to anyone&rsquo;s advantage to quarrel with his arbitrary pronouncement
    for the sake of any slave girl, however desirable she might be. It was not
    pleasant to encounter the wrath of the praefect of Rome nor safe to rouse
    his enmity.</p>
  <p>So the crowd acquiesced silently, not only because it feared the praefect,
    but also because Menecreta&rsquo;s sorrow, the call of the despairing mother,
    the sad tragedy of this little domestic episode had not left untouched the
    hearts of these Roman citizens. In matters of sentiment they were not cruel
    and they held family ties in great esteem; both these factors went far towards
    causing any would-be purchaser to obey Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s commands and
    to retire at once from the bidding.</p>
  <p>As for Menecreta, it seemed to her as if the heavens had opened before her
    delighted gaze. From the depths of despair she had suddenly been dragged
    forth into the blinding daylight of hope. She could scarcely believe that
    her ears had heard rightly the words of the praefect.</p>
  <p>Still clinging to his knees she raised her head to him; her eyes still dimmed
    with tears looked strangely wondering up at his face whilst her lips murmured
    faintly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Art thou a god, that thou shouldst act like this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But obviously the small stock of patience possessed by the praefect was
    now exhausted, for he pushed the woman roughly away from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A truce on thy ravings now, woman. The midday hour is almost on us.
    I have no further time to waste on thine affairs. Put the girl up on the
    catasta,&rdquo;  he added, speaking in his usual harsh, curt way, &ldquo;and
    take this woman&rsquo;s arms from round my shins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And it was characteristic of him that this time he did not interfere with
    his lictors when they handled the woman with their accustomed roughness.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many
    days.&rdquo;&mdash;Ecclesiastes 11. 1.</p>
  <p>The fair-skinned Cheiron up on the rostrum now took over the duties of the
    disgraced Hun Rhavas.</p>
  <p>The interlude had caused the crowd to linger on despite the approach of
    noonday, an hour always devoted, almost sacred, to rest. But now that decorum
    was once more restored and the work of the sale could be proceeded with in
    the methodical manner approved by the praefect, interest began to flag.</p>
  <p>The crowd seemed inclined to wait just a brief while longer in order to
    see Nola put up on the catasta and to hear the bid of twenty aurei made for
    her by her mother&mdash;a bid which, at the praefect&rsquo;s commands, was
    to be final and undisputed. Just to see the hammer come clashing down as
    an epilogue to the palpitating drama was perhaps worth waiting for. The human
    goods still left for sale after that would have to be held over for a more
    favourable opportunity.</p>
  <p>The praefect was preparing to leave.</p>
  <p>Up on the platform Nola, the daughter of Menecreta, smiled at the world
    through a few lingering tears. She was very happy now that her golden hair
    was allowed to stream down her shoulders, and that it was only because the
    praefect had so ordered it that the low price of twenty aurei would be accepted
    for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nola, daughter of Menecreta,&rdquo; shouted Cheiron, the new auctioneer,  &ldquo;aged
    sixteen years, skilled in the art of healing, and the knowledge of unguents
    and herbs. Her health is good, her teeth perfect, and her eyes keen for threading
    the finest needle. Shall we say fifteen aurei for the girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He recited his peroration quickly and perfunctorily, like one repeating
    a lesson, learned from the praefect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give twenty,&rdquo; rang out Menecreta&rsquo;s voice,
    clearly and loudly. She, too, had learned her lesson, and learned it well,
    whilst gratitude and an infinity of joy gave her strength to overcome her
    natural timidity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty aurei! twenty aurei! will no one bid more for Nola, the daughter
    of Menecreta,&rdquo; shouted the auctioneer, hammer in hand, ready to bring
    it down since no more bidding would be allowed for this piece of goods. &ldquo;Twenty
    aurei! no one bids more&mdash;no one&mdash;no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give thirty aurei!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a pure, young voice that spoke, the voice of a young girl, mellow
    and soft-toned as those of a pigeon when it cooes to its mate; but firm withal,
    direct and clear, the voice of one accustomed to command and even more accustomed
    to be obeyed.</p>
  <p>The sound rang from temple to temple right across the Forum, and was followed
    by silence&mdash;the dead silence which falls upon a multitude when every
    heart stops beating and every breath is indrawn.</p>
  <p>Cheiron paused, hammer in hand, his lips parted for the very words which
    he was about to utter, his round open eyes wandering irresolutely from the
    praefect&rsquo;s face to that of the speaker with the melodious voice.</p>
  <p>And on the hot noonday air there trembled a long sigh of pain, like the
    breaking of a human heart.</p>
  <p>But the same voice, soft and low, was heard again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The girl pleases me! What say you, my lord Escanes, is not that hair
    worthy to be immortalised by a painter&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And preceded by her lictors, who made a way for her through the crowd, Dea
    Flavia advanced even to the foot of the catasta. And as she advanced, those
    who were near retreated to a respectful distance, making a circle round her
    and leaving her isolated, with her tall Ethiopian slaves behind her holding
    broad leaves of palm above her head to shield her from the sun. Thus was
    the gold of her hair left in shadow, and the white skin of her face appeared
    soft and cool, but the sun played with the shimmering folds of her white
    silk tunic and glinted against the gems on her fingers.</p>
  <p>Tall, imperious and majestic, Dea Flavia&mdash;unconscious alike of the
    deference of the crowd and the timorous astonishment of the slaves&mdash;looked
    up at Cheiron, the auctioneer, and resumed with a touch of impatience in
    her rich young voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said that I would bid thirty aurei for this girl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Less than a minute had elapsed since Dea Flavia&rsquo;s sudden appearance
    on the scene. Taurus Antinor had as yet made no movement or given any sign
    to Cheiron as to what he should do; but those who watched him with anxious
    interest could see the dark frown on his brow grow darker still and darker,
    until his whole face seemed almost distorted with an expression of passionate
    wrath.</p>
  <p>Menecreta, paralysed by this sudden and final shattering of her every hope,
    uttered moan after moan of pain, and as the pitiful sounds reached the praefect&rsquo;s
    ears, a smothered oath escaped his tightly clenched teeth. Like some gigantic
    beast roused from noonday sleep, he straightened his massive frame and seemed
    suddenly to shake himself free from that state of torpor into which Dea Flavia&rsquo;s
    unexpected appearance had at first thrown him. He too, advanced to the foot
    of the catasta and there faced the imperious beauty, whom the whole city
    had, for the past two years, tacitly agreed to obey in all things.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The State,&rdquo; he said, speaking at least as haughtily as Dea
    Flavia herself, &ldquo;hath agreed to accept the sum of twenty aurei for
    this slave. &rsquo;Tis too late now to make further bids for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But a pair of large blue eyes, cold as the waters of the Tiber and like
    unto them mysterious and elusive, were turned fully on the speaker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too late didst thou say, oh Taurus Antinor?&rdquo; said Dea Flavia
    raising her pencilled eyebrows with a slight expression of scorn, &ldquo;nay!
    I had not seen the hammer descend! The girl until then is not sold, and open
    to the highest bidder. Or am I wrong, O praefect, in thus interpreting the
    laws of Rome?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is an exceptional case, Augusta,&rdquo; he retorted curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then wilt thou expound to me that law which deals with such exceptional
    cases?&rdquo; she rejoined with the same ill-concealed tone of gentle irony. &ldquo;I
    had never heard of it; so I pray thee enlighten mine ignorance. Of a truth
    thou must know the law, since thou didst swear before the altar of the gods
    to uphold it with all thy might.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not a case of law, Augusta, but one of pity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The praefect, feeling no doubt the weakness of any argument which aimed
    at coercing this daughter of the C&aelig;sars, prompted too by his innate
    respect of the law which he administered, thought it best to retreat from
    his position of haughty arrogance and to make an appeal, since obviously
    he could not command. Dea Flavia was quick to note this change of attitude,
    and her delicate lips parted in a contemptuous smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost administer pity as well as law, O Taurus Antinor?&rdquo; she
    asked coldly.</p>
  <p>Then, as if further argument from him were of no interest to her, she once
    more turned to the auctioneer, and said with marked impatience:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have bid thirty aurei for this girl; art set there slave, to gape
    at the praefect, or to do thy duty to the State that employs thee? Is there
    a higher bid for the maid? She pleaseth me, and I&rsquo;ll give sixty or
    an hundred for her. This is a public auction as by law directed. I appeal
    to thee, oh Taurus Antinor, to give orders to thy slaves, ere I appeal to
    my kinsman, the Emperor, for the restoration of a due administration of the
    law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Those who had cause to know and to fear the praefect&rsquo;s varying moods,
    were ready to shrink away now from the threatening darkness of his glance.
    He seemed indeed like some tawny wild beast, chained and scorned, whom a
    child was teasing from a point of vantage just beyond the reach of his powerful
    jaws.</p>
  <p>She was so well within her rights and he so absolutely in the wrong as far
    as the law was concerned, that he knew at once that he must inevitably give
    way. If Dea Flavia chose to desire a slave she could satisfy the caprice,
    since no man&rsquo;s fortune could hold out against her own. This too did
    the praefect know. He himself was passing rich and would gladly have paid
    a large sum now, that he might prove the victor in this unequal contest but
    Dea Flavia had the law and boundless wealth on her side. Taurus Antinor had
    only his personal authority which had coerced the crowd, but was of no avail
    against this beautiful woman who defied him openly before the plebs and before
    his slaves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have no fear, O Dea Flavia,&rdquo; he said, trying to speak calmly,
    but his voice trembling with the mighty effort at control, &ldquo;justice
    hath never yet suffered at my hands. I told thee that &rsquo;tis not a case
    of law here but one of mercy. This girl&rsquo;s mother has toiled for years
    to save enough money with which to buy the freedom of her child. She hath
    twenty aurei to command, and the girl is not worth much more than that. The
    State would have been satisfied, for my own purse would have made up the
    deficiency. I had bought the girl myself and given her to the mother, but
    the poor wretch was so proud and happy to buy her child&rsquo;s freedom herself,
    that I allowed her to make the bid. That is this slave-girl&rsquo;s story,
    Augusta! Thou seest that the law will not suffer, neither shall the State
    be defrauded. What thou art prepared to give for the girl that will I make
    good in the coffers of the State. Art satisfied, I hope! Thou art a woman,
    and canst mayhap better understand than I did at first when Menecreta threw
    herself at my knees.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His rugged voice softened considerably whilst he spoke, and those who were
    watching him so anxiously saw the ugly dark frown gradually lighten on his
    brow. No wonder! since he was just a man face to face with an exceptionally
    beautiful woman, to whose pity he was endeavouring to make appeal. At all
    times an easy and a pleasant task, it must have been doubly so now when the
    object of mercy was so deserving. Taurus Antinor looked straight into the
    lovely face before him, marvelling when those exquisite blue eyes would soften
    with their first look of pity. But they remained serene and mysterious, neither
    avoiding his gaze nor responding to its appeal. The delicately chiselled
    lips retained their slight curve of scorn.</p>
  <p>He gave a sign to Menecreta, and she approached, tottering like one who
    is drunken with wine, or who has received a heavy blow on the head. She stood
    before Dea Flavia, with head trembling like poplar leaves and great hollow
    eyes fixed in meaningless vacancy upon the great patrician lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is Menecreta, O Dea Flavia,&rdquo; concluded the praefect; &ldquo;wilt
    allow her to plead her own cause?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without replying directly to him, Dea Flavia turned for the first time to
    the slave-girl on the platform.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this thy mother?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; murmured the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hast a wish that she should buy thy freedom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That thou shouldst go with her to the hovel which is her home, the
    only home that thou wouldst ever know? Hast a wish to become the slave of
    that old woman, whose mind hath already gone wandering among the shadows,
    and whose body will very shortly go in search of her mind? Hast a wish to
    spend the rest of thy days scrubbing floors and stewing onions in an iron
    pot? Or is thy wish to dwell in the marble halls of Dea Flavia&rsquo;s house,
    where the air is filled with the perfume of roses and violets and tame songbirds
    make their nests in the oleander bushes? Wouldst like to recline on soft
    downy cushions, allowing thy golden hair to fall over thy shoulders the while
    I, mallet or chisel in hand, would make thy face immortal by carving it in
    marble? The praefect saith thine is a case for pity, then do I have pity
    upon thee, and give thee the choice of what thy life shall be. Squalor and
    misery as thy mother&rsquo;s slave, or joy, music, and flowers as mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice, ever low and musical, had taken on notes of tenderness and of
    languor. The tears of pity which the praefect had vainly tried to conjure
    up gathered now in her eyes as her whole mood seemed to melt in the fire
    of her own eloquence.</p>
  <p>Nola hung her head, overwhelmed with shame. She was very young and the great
    lady very kind and gentle. Her own simple heart, still filled with the selfish
    desires of extreme youth, cried out for that same life of ease and luxury
    which the beautiful lady depicted in such tempting colours before her, whilst
    it shrank instinctively from the poverty, the hard floors, the stewing-pots
    which awaited her in that squalid hut on the Aventine where her mother dwelt.</p>
  <p>She hung her head and made no reply, whilst from the group of the young
    and idle sycophants who had hung on Dea Flavia&rsquo;s honeyed words just
    as they had done round her litter a while ago, came murmurs of extravagant
    adulation and well-chosen words in praise of her exquisite diction, her marvellous
    pity, her every talent and virtue thus freely displayed.</p>
  <p>Even the crowd stared open-mouthed and agape at this wonderful spectacle
    of so great a lady stooping to parley with a slave.</p>
  <p>The praefect alone remained seemingly unmoved; but the expression of hidden
    wrath had once more crept into his eyes, making them look dark and fierce
    and glowing with savage impotence; and his gaze had remained fixed on the
    radiantly beautiful woman who stood there before him in all the glory of
    her high descent, her patrician bearing, the exquisite charm of her personality,
    seductive in its haughty aloofness, voluptuous even in its disdainful calm.</p>
  <p>Neither did Menecreta fall a victim to Dea Flavia&rsquo;s melodious voice.
    She had listened from a respectful distance, and with the humble deference
    born of years of bondage, to the honeyed words with which the great lady
    deigned to cajole a girl-slave: but when Dea Flavia had finished speaking
    and the chorus of admiration had died down around her, the freedwoman, with
    steps which she vainly tried to render firm, approached to the foot of the
    catasta and stood between the great lady and her own child.</p>
  <p>She placed one trembling, toil-worn hand on Nola&rsquo;s shoulder and said
    gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nola, thou hast heard what my lady&rsquo;s grace hath deigned to
    speak. A humble life but yet a free one awaits thee in thy mother&rsquo;s
    home on the Aventine; a life of luxurious slavery doth my lady&rsquo;s grace
    offer thee. She deigns to say that thou alone shalt choose thy way in life.
    Thou wast born a slave, Nola, and shouldst know how to obey. Obey my lady
    then. Choose thy future, Nola. The humble and free one which I, thy mother,
    have earned for thee, or the golden cage in which this proud lady would deign
    to keep her latest whim in bondage!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice, which at first had been almost steady, died down at the end in
    a pitiful quiver. It was the last agony of her hopes, the real parting from
    her child, for even whilst Menecreta&rsquo;s throat was choked with sobs,
    Nola hung her head and great heavy tears dropped from her eyes upon her clasped
    hands. The child was crying and the mother understood.</p>
  <p>She no longer moaned with pain now. The pain was gone; only dull despair
    remained. Her heart had hungered for the one glad cry of joy: &ldquo;Mother,
    I&rsquo;ll come to thee!&rdquo; It was left starving even through her daughter&rsquo;s
    tears.</p>
  <p>But those who watched this unwonted scene could not guess what Dea Flavia
    felt, for her eyes were veiled by her long lashes, and the mouth expressed
    neither triumph nor pity. Menecreta now once more tried to steady her quivering
    voice; she straightened her weary back and said quite calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lady&rsquo;s grace has spoken, and the great lords here assembled
    have uttered words of praise for an exquisite act of pity. My lady&rsquo;s
    grace hath spoken and hath told the poor slave, Nola, to choose her own life.
    But I, the humble freedwoman, will speak in my turn to thee, O Dea Flavia
    of the imperial house of immortal C&aelig;sar, and looking into thine eyes
    I tell thee that thy pity is but falsehood and thine eloquence naught but
    cruelty. By thy words thou didst take my child from me as effectually as
    if thou already hadst bought and paid for her. Look at the child now! She
    hangs her head and dares not look on me, her mother. Oh! thou didst well
    choose thy words, oh daughter of imperial C&aelig;sar, for thy honeyed words
    were like the nectar which hid the poison that hath filtrated into my daughter&rsquo;s
    heart. Thou hast said it right&mdash;her life with me had been one of toil
    and mayhap of misery, but she would have been content, for she had never
    dreamed of another life. But now she has heard thee speak of marble halls,
    of music and of flowers, of a life of ease and of vanity, and never again
    would that child be happy in her mother&rsquo;s arms. Be content, O Augusta!
    the girl is thine since thy caprice hath willed it so. Even though she chose
    her mother now, I would not have her, for I know that she would be unhappy
    in that lonely hut on the Aventine; and though I have seen much sorrow and
    endured much misery, there is none greater to bear than the sight of a child&rsquo;s
    sorrow. Take her, Dea Flavia! thine eloquence has triumphed over a mother&rsquo;s
    broken heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Strangely enough, and to the astonishment of all those present, Dea Flavia
    had listened patiently and silently whilst the woman spoke, and now she said
    quite gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! thou dost wrong thine own child, Menecreta; see how lovingly
    she turns to thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only because in her shallow little heart there has come the first
    twinge of remorse,&rdquo; replied the woman sadly. &ldquo;Soon, in the lap
    of that luxury which thou dost offer her, she will have forgotten the mother&rsquo;s
    arms in which she weeps to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; suddenly interposed the praefect harshly. &ldquo;Menecreta,
    take thy child; take her, I say. Dea Flavia hath relinquished her to thee.
    Be not a fool and take the child away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But with a gesture of savage pride the freedwoman tore herself away from
    Nola.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not take her. That
    proud lady here hath stolen the soul of my child; her body, inert and sad,
    I&rsquo;ll not have the while her heart longs to be away from me. I&rsquo;ll
    not have her, I say! let the daughter of C&aelig;sar account to the gods
    above for her tempting words, her honeyed speech and her lies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, woman!&rdquo; ordered Dea Flavia sternly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lies, I tell thee, lies,&rdquo; continued the woman who had lost
    all sense of fear in the depth of her misery; &ldquo;the life of luxury thou
    dost promise this child&mdash;how long will it last? thy caprice for her&mdash;when
    will it tire? Silence? nay! I&rsquo;ll not be silent,&rdquo; she continued
    wildly in defiant answer to angry murmurs from the crowd.  &ldquo;Thou daughter
    of a house of tyrants, tyrant thyself! a slave to thy paltry whims, crushing
    beneath thy sandalled feet the hearts of the poor and the cries of the oppressed!
    Shame on thee! shame on thee, I say!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the great Mother,&rdquo; said Dea Flavia coldly, &ldquo;will no
    one here rid me of this screaming vixen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But even before she had spoken, the angry murmurs around had swollen to
    loud protestations. Before the praefect&rsquo;s lictors could intervene the
    crowd had pushed forward; the men rushed and surrounded the impious creature
    who had dared to raise her voice against one of the divinities of Rome: Augusta
    the goddess.</p>
  <p>One of Dea Flavia&rsquo;s gigantic Ethiopians had seized Menecreta by the
    shoulder, another pulled her head back by the hair and struck her roughly
    on the mouth, but she, with the strength of the vanquished, brought down
    to her knees, frenzied with despair, continued her agonised cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A curse upon thee, Dea Flavia, a curse spoken by the dying lips of
    the mother whom thou hast scorned!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How she contrived momentarily to free herself from the angry crowd of lictors
    and of slaves it were impossible to say; perhaps at this moment something
    in Menecreta&rsquo;s wild ravings had awed their spirit and paralysed their
    hands. Certain it is that for one moment the freedwoman managed to struggle
    to her feet and to drag herself along on her knees until her hands clutched
    convulsively the embroidered tunic of Dea Flavia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And this is the curse which I pronounce on thee,&rdquo; she murmured
    in a hoarse whisper, which, rising and rising to higher tones, finally ended
    in shrieks which reached to the outermost precincts of the Forum. &ldquo;Dea
    Flavia, daughter of Octavius Claudius thou art accursed. May thine every
    deed of mercy be turned to sorrow and to humiliation, thine every act of
    pity prove a curse to him who receives it, until thou on thy knees, art left
    to sue for pity to a heart that knoweth it not and findest a deaf ear turned
    to thy cry. Hear me, ye gods&mdash;hear me!... Magna Mater, hear me!... Mother
    of the stars&mdash;hear me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Superstition, deeply rooted in every Roman heart, held the crowd enthralled
    even whilst Menecreta&rsquo;s trembling voice echoed against the marble walls
    of the temples of the gods whom she invoked. No one attempted to stop her.
    Dea Flavia&rsquo;s slaves dared not lay a hand on her. It seemed as if Magna
    Mater herself, the great Mother, had thrown an invisible mantle over the
    humble freedwoman, shielding her with god-like power.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Menecreta, raise thyself and come away,&rdquo; said a harsh voice
    in tones of command. The praefect had at last with the vigorous help of his
    lictors managed to push his way through the crowd. It was he now who attempted
    to raise the woman from her knees. He sharply bade his own men to silence
    the woman and to take her away.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia had remained silent and still. She had not attempted to interrupt
    the frenzied woman who called this awful curse upon her; only once, when
    Menecreta invoked the gods, did a shudder pass through the delicate body,
    and her heavy lids fell over her blue eyes, as if they were trying to shut
    out some awful vision which the woman&rsquo;s ravings had conjured up.</p>
  <p>Then in a sudden her mood seemed to change, her serenity returned, and when
    the praefect interposed she put out a restraining hand, warning the lictors
    not to approach.</p>
  <p>She bent to Menecreta and called her by name, her mellow voice vibrating
    with tender tones like the chords of the harp that are touched by a master
    hand, and her blue eyes, veiled with tears, looked down with infinite tenderness
    on the prostrate figure at her feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Menecreta,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;thy sorrow hath made thee
    harsh. The gods, believe me, still hold much happiness in store for thee
    and for thy daughter. See how they refuse to register thy curse which had
    been impious were it not the dictate of thy poor frenzied mind. See, Menecreta,
    how thou didst misjudge me; what I did, I did because I wished to test thy
    love for thy child. I wished to test its true selflessness. But now I am
    satisfied and Nola need no longer choose, for she shall have the luxury for
    which her young heart doth pine, but she shall never by me be deprived of
    her mother&rsquo;s love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even while she spoke, Menecreta struggled to her knees. Her wide-open eyes,
    over which a mysterious veil seemed to be slowly descending, were fixed on
    the radiant vision above her. But comprehension had not yet reached her mind.
    Her spirit had not yet been dragged from the hell of despair to this glorious
    sight of heaven.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Menecreta,&rdquo; continued the gentle voice, &ldquo;thou shalt come
    to my house. A free woman, thou shalt be my friend and thy daughter shall
    be thy happy bondswoman. I&rsquo;ll give thee a little home in which thou
    shalt dwell with her and draw thy last breath in her arms; there shall be
    a garden there which she will plant with roses. Thy days and hers will be
    one continuous joy. Come to me now, Menecreta! Take thy daughter by the hand
    and come and dwell with her in the little house which my slaves shall prepare
    for thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her face now was almost on a level with that of Menecreta, whose hollow
    eyes gazed upwards with a look of ecstatic wonder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; murmured the freedwoman; &ldquo;there is a film
    over my eyes&mdash;I cannot see&mdash;art thou a goddess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; replied Dea Flavia gently, &ldquo;only a lonely maiden
    who has no friends e&rsquo;en in the midst of all her riches. A lonely maid
    whom thou didst try to curse, asking the gods that her every act of mercy
    be turned to bitter sorrow. See, she takes thee to her heart and gives thee
    back thy daughter, a home and happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My daughter?&rdquo; murmured Menecreta.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She shall dwell with thee in the house which shall be thine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A home?&rdquo; and the trembling voice grew weaker, the hollow eyes
    more dim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! in the midst of a garden, with roses and violets all around.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And happiness?&rdquo; sighed Menecreta.</p>
  <p>And her head fell back against Dea Flavia&rsquo;s arm; her eyes, now veiled
    by the film of death gazed, sightless, up at the dome of blue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Menecreta!&rdquo; cried Dea Flavia, horror-stricken as she felt the
    feeble body stiffening against her with the approaching rigidity of death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; echoed Nola, striving to smother her terror as she
    threw herself on her knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The woman is dead,&rdquo; said the praefect quietly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the
    last.&rdquo;&mdash;Revelations 22. 13.</p>
  <p>And after that silence and peace.</p>
  <p>Silence save for the moanings of the child Nola, who in a passionate outburst
    of grief had thrown herself on the body of her mother.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia stood there still and calm, her young face scarce less white
    than the clinging folds of her tunic, her unfathomable eyes fixed upon the
    pathetic group at her feet: the weeping girl and the dead woman.</p>
  <p>She seemed almost dazed&mdash;like one who does not understand and a quaint
    puzzled frown appeared upon the whiteness of her brow.</p>
  <p>Once she raised her eyes to the praefect and encountered his gaze&mdash;strangely
    contemptuous and wrathful&mdash;fixed upon her own, and anon she shuddered
    when a pitiable moan from Nola echoed from end to end along the marble walls
    around.</p>
  <p>And the crowd of idlers began slowly to disperse. In groups of twos and
    threes they went, their sandalled feet making a soft rustling noise against
    the flagstones of the Forum, and their cloaks of thin woollen stuff floating
    out behind them as they walked.</p>
  <p>The young patricians were the first to go. The scene had ceased to be amusing
    and Dea Flavia was not like to bestow another smile. They thought it best
    to retire to their luxurious homes, for they vaguely resented the majesty
    of death which clung round the dead freedwoman and the young living slave.
    They hoped to forget in the course of the noonday sleep, and the subsequent
    delights of the table, the painful events which had so unpleasantly stirred
    their shallow hearts.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia paid no heed to them as they murmured words of leave-taking in
    her ear. &rsquo;Tis doubtful if she saw one of them or cared if they went
    or stayed.</p>
  <p>At an order from the praefect the auction sale was abruptly suspended. The
    lictors drove the herds of human cattle together preparatory to taking them
    to their quarters on the slopes of the Aventine where they would remain until
    the morrow; whilst the scribes and auctioneers made haste to scramble down
    from the heights of the rostrum, the heat of the day having rendered that
    elevated position well-nigh unbearable. Only Dea Flavia&rsquo;s retinue lingered
    in the Forum. Standing at a respectful distance they surrounded the gorgeously
    draped litter, waiting, silently and timorous, the further pleasure of their
    mistress; and behind Dea Flavia her two Ethiopian slaves, stolidly holding
    the palm leaves to shield her head against the blazing sun which so mercilessly
    seared their own naked shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grant me leave to escort thee to thy litter, Augusta!&rdquo; murmured
    a timid voice.</p>
  <p>It was young Hortensius Martius who spoke. He had approached the catasta
    and now stood timid, and a suppliant, beside Dea Flavia, with his curly head
    bare to the scorching sun and his back bent in slave-like deference. But
    the young girl seemed not to hear him and even after he had twice repeated
    his request she turned to him with uncomprehending eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would not leave thee, Dea,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;until I saw thee
    safely among thy slaves and thy clients.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then at last did she speak. But her voice sounded toneless and dull, as
    of one who speaks in a dream.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank thee, good Hortensius,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but my slaves
    are close at hand and I would prefer to be left alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To insist further would have been churlish. Hortensius Martius, well versed
    in every phase of decorum, bowed his head in obedience and retired to his
    litter. But he told his slaves not to bear him away from the Forum altogether
    but to place the litter down under the arcades of the tabernae, and then
    to stand round it so that it could not be seen, whilst he himself could still
    keep watch over the movements of Dea Flavia.</p>
  <p>But she in the meanwhile remained in the same inert position, standing listlessly
    beside the body of Menecreta, her face expressing puzzlement rather than
    horror, as if within her soul she was trying to reconcile the events of the
    last few moments with her previous conceptions of what the tenor of her life
    should be.</p>
  <p>The curse of Menecreta had found sudden and awful fulfilment, and Dea Flavia
    remained vaguely wondering whether the gods had been asleep on this hot late
    summer&rsquo;s day and forgotten to shield their favoured daughter against
    the buffetings of fate. A freedwoman had roused superstitious fear in the
    heart of a daughter of the C&aelig;sars! Surely there must be something very
    wrong in the administration of the affairs of this world. Nay, more! for
    the freedwoman, unconscious of her own impiety, had triumphed in the end;
    her death&mdash;majestic and sublime in its suddenness&mdash;had set the
    seal upon her malediction.</p>
  <p>And Dea Flavia marvelled that the dead woman remained so calm, her eyes
    so still, when&mdash;if indeed Jupiter had been aroused by the monstrous
    sacrilege&mdash;she must now be facing the terrors of his judgments.</p>
  <p>And Taurus Antinor watched her in silence whilst she stood thus, unconscious
    of his gaze, a perfect picture of exquisite womanhood set in a frame of marble
    temples and colonnades, a dome of turquoise above her head, the palm leaves
    above her throwing a dense blue shadow on her golden hair and the white tunic
    on her shoulders.</p>
  <p>He had heard much of Dea Flavia&mdash;the daughter of Claudius Octavius
    and now the ward of the Emperor Caligula&mdash;since his return from Syria
    a year ago, and he had oft seen her gilded and rose-draped litter gliding
    along the Sacra Via or the Via Appia, surrounded with its numberless retinue:
    but he had never seen her so close as this, nor had he heard her speak.</p>
  <p>She was a mere child and still under the tutelage of her despotic father
    when he&mdash;Taurus Antinor&mdash;tired of the enervating influences of
    decadent Rome, had obtained leave from the Emperor Tiberius to go to Syria
    as its governor. The imperator was glad enough to let him go. Taurus Antinor,
    named Anglicanus, was more popular with the army and the plebs than any autocratic
    ruler could wish.</p>
  <p>He went to Syria and remained there half a dozen years. The jealousy of
    one emperor had sent him thither and &lsquo;twas the jealousy of another
    that called him back to Rome. Syria had liked its governor over well, and
    Caius Julius C&aelig;sar Caligula would not brook rivalry in the allegiance
    owed to himself alone by his subjects&mdash;even by those who dwelt in the
    remotest provinces of the Empire.</p>
  <p>But on his return to Rome the powerful personality of Taurus Antinor soon
    imposed itself upon the fierce and maniacal despot. Caligula&mdash;though
    he must in reality have hated the Anglicanus as much and more than he hated
    all men&mdash;gave grudging admiration to his independence of spirit and
    to his fearless tongue. In the midst of an entourage composed of lying sycophants
    and of treacherous minions, the C&aelig;sar seemed to feel in the presence
    of the stranger a sense of security and of trust. Some writers have averred
    that Caligula looked on Taurus Antinor as a kind of personal fetish who kept
    the wrath of the gods averted from his imperial head. Be that as it may,
    there is no doubt that tyrant exerted his utmost power to keep Taurus near
    his person, showering upon him those honours and titles of which he would
    have been equally ready to deprive him had the stranger at any time run counter
    to his will. Anon, when the C&aelig;sar thought it incumbent upon his dignity
    to start on a military expedition, he forced Antinor to accept the praefecture
    of the city in order to keep him permanently settled in Rome.</p>
  <p>The Anglicanus accepted the power&mdash;which was almost supreme in the
    absence of the C&aelig;sar. He even gave the oath demanded of him by the
    Emperor that he would remain at his post until the termination of the proposed
    military expedition, but it was easy to see that the dignities for which
    others would have fought and striven to their uttermost were not really to
    the liking of Taurus Antinor.</p>
  <p>Avowedly wilful of temper, he had since his return from Syria become even
    more silent, more self-centred than before. Many called him morose and voted
    him either treacherous or secretly ambitious; others averred that he was
    either very arrogant or frankly dull. Certain it is that he held himself
    very much aloof from the society of his kind and persistently refused to
    mix with the young elegants of the day either in their circles or their baths,
    their private parties or public entertainments.</p>
  <p>Thus it was that the praefect found himself to-day for the first time in
    the near presence of Dea Flavia, the acknowledged queen of that same society
    which he declined to frequent, and as he grudgingly admitted to himself that
    she was beautiful beyond what men had said of her, he remembered all the
    tales which he had heard of her callous pride, her cold dignity, and of that
    cruel disdain with which she rejected all homage and broke the hearts of
    those whom her beauty had brought to her feet.</p>
  <p>For the moment, however, she struck him as more pathetic than fearsome;
    she looked lonely just now like a stately lily blooming alone in a deserted
    garden. He was wroth with her for what she had done to Menecreta and for
    her childish caprice and opposition to his will, but at the same time he
    who so seldom felt pity for those whom a just punishment had overtaken, was
    sorry for this young girl, for in her case retribution had been severe and
    out of all proportion to her fault.</p>
  <p>Therefore he approached her almost with deference and forced his rough voice
    to gentleness, as he said to her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The hour is late, O Dea Flavia. I myself must leave the Forum now.
    I would wish to see thee safe amongst thy women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She turned her blue eyes upon him. His voice had roused her from her meditations
    and recalled her to that sense of proud dignity with which she loved to surround
    herself as with invisible walls. She must have seen the pity in his eyes
    for he did not try to hide it, but it seemed to anger her as coming from
    this man who&mdash;to her mind&mdash;was the primary cause of her present
    trouble. She looked for a moment or two on him as if trying to recollect
    his very existence, and no importunate slave could ever encounter such complete
    disdain as fell on the praefect at this moment from Dea Flavia&rsquo;s glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will return to my palace at the hour which pleaseth me most, O
    praefectus,&rdquo;  she said coldly, &ldquo;and when the child Nola, being
    more composed, is ready to accompany me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; he rejoined in his accustomed rough way, &ldquo;the slave
    Nola is naught to thee now. She will be looked after as the State directs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The slave is mine,&rdquo; she retorted curtly. &ldquo;She shall come
    with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And even as she spoke she drew herself up to her full height, more like,
    he thought, than ever to a stately lily now. The crown of gold upon her head
    caught a glint from the noonday sun, and the folds of her white tunic fell
    straight and rigid from her shoulders down to her feet.</p>
  <p>It seemed strange to him that one so young, so exquisitely pure, should
    thus be left all alone to face the hard moments of life; her very disdain
    for him, her wilfulness, seemed to him pathetic, for they showed her simple
    ignorance of the many cruelties which life must of necessity have in store
    for her.</p>
  <p>As for yielding to her present mood, he had no thought of it. It was caprice
    originally which had caused her to defy his will and to break old Menecreta&rsquo;s
    heart. She had invoked strict adherence to the law for the sole purpose of
    indulging this caprice. Now he was tempted also to stand upon the law and
    to defy her tyrannical will, even at the cost of his own inclinations in
    the matter.</p>
  <p>He would not trust her with the child Nola now. He had other plans for the
    orphan girl, rendered lonely and desolate through a great lady&rsquo;s whim,
    and he would have felt degradation in the thought that Dea Flavia should
    impose her will on him in this.</p>
  <p>He knew her power of course. She was a near kinswoman of the Emperor, and
    the child of his adoption; she was all-powerful with the C&aelig;sar as with
    all men through the might of his personality as much as through that of her
    wealth.</p>
  <p>But he had no thought of yielding nor any thought of fear. It seemed as
    if in the heat-laden atmosphere two mighty wills had suddenly clashed one
    against the other, brandishing ghostly steels. His will against hers! The
    might of manhood and of strength against the word of a beautiful woman. Nor
    was the contest unequal. If he could crush her with a touch of his hand,
    she could destroy him with one word in the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s ear. She had
    as her ally the full unbridled might of the House of C&aelig;sar, while against
    her there was only this stranger, a descendant of a freedwoman from a strange
    land. For the nonce his influence was great over the mind of the quasi-madman
    who sat on the Empire&rsquo;s throne, but any moment, any event, the whisper
    of an enemy, the word of a woman, might put an end to his power.</p>
  <p>All this Dea Flavia knew, and knowing it found pleasure in toying with his
    wrath. Armed with the triple weapon of her beauty, her purity and her power,
    she taunted him with his impotence and smiled with scornful pity upon the
    weakness of his manhood.</p>
  <p>Even now she turned to Nola and said with gentle firmness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get up, girl, and come with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But at her words the last vestige of deference fled from the praefect&rsquo;s
    manner; pity now would have been weak folly. Had he yielded he would have
    despised himself even as this proud girl now affected to scorn him.</p>
  <p>He interposed his massive figure between Dea Flavia and the slave and said
    loudly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By thy leave, Nola, the daughter of Menecreta, is the property of
    the State and &rsquo;tis I will decide whither she goeth now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until to-morrow only, Taurus Antinor,&rdquo; she rejoined coldly, &ldquo;for
    to-morrow she must be in the slave market again, when my agents will bid
    for and buy her according to my will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! she shall not be put up for sale to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By whose authority, O praefectus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By mine. The State hath given me leave to purchase privately a number
    of slaves from the late censor&rsquo;s household. &rsquo;Tis my intention
    to purchase Nola thus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast no right,&rdquo; she said, still speaking with outward
    calm, though her whole soul rebelled against the arrogance of this man who
    dared to thwart her will, to gainsay her word, and set up his dictates against
    hers, &ldquo;thou hast no right thus to take the law in thine own hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! as to that,&rdquo; he replied with equal calm, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    answer for mine own actions. But the slave Nola shall not pass into thy hands,
    Augusta! Thou hast wrought quite enough mischief as it is; be content and
    go thy way. Leave the child in peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In these days of unbridled passions and unfettered tyranny, a man who spoke
    thus to a daughter of the C&aelig;sars spoke at peril of his life. Both Dea
    Flavia and Taurus Antinor knew this when they faced one another eye to eye,
    their very souls in rebellion one against the other&mdash;his own turbulent
    and fierce, with the hot blood from a remote land coursing in his veins,
    blinding him to his own advantage, to his own future, to everything save
    to his feeling of independence at all cost from the oppression of this family
    of tyrants; her own almost serene in its consciousness of limitless power.</p>
  <p>For the moment her sense of dignity prevailed. Whatever she might do in
    the future, she was comparatively helpless now. The praefect in the discharge
    of his functions&mdash;second only to the C&aelig;sar&mdash;was all-powerful
    where he stood.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor was still the praefect of Rome, still a member of the Senate
    and favourite of Caligula. He had her at a disadvantage now, just as she
    had held him a while ago when she forced on the public sale of the girl Nola.
    Therefore, though with a look she would have crushed the insolent, and her
    delicate hands were clenched into fists that would have chastised him then
    and there if they had the strength, she returned his look of fierce defiance
    with her usual one of calm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast spoken, Taurus Antinor,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;and
    in deference to the law which thou dost represent I bow to thy commands.
    Art thou content?&rdquo; she added, seeing that he made no reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Content?&rdquo; he asked, puzzled at her meaning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I asked thee if thou wert content. Thou
    hast humiliated a daughter of C&aelig;sar, a humiliation which she is not
    like to forget.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I crave thy pardon if I have transgressed beyond the limits of my
    duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy duty? Nay, Taurus Antinor, a man&rsquo;s duties are as varied
    as a woman&rsquo;s moods, and he is wisest who knows how to adapt the one
    to the other. &rsquo;Tis not good, remember, to run counter to Dea Flavia&rsquo;s
    will. &rsquo;Tis much that thou must have forgotten, O praefect, ere thou
    didst set thy so-called duty above the fulfilment of my wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, gracious lady,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;I had forgotten
    nothing. Not even that Archelaus Menas, the sculptor, died for having angered
    thee; nor that Julius Campanius perished in exile and young Decretas in fetters,
    because of thine enmity. Thou seest that&mdash;though somewhat of a stranger
    in Rome&mdash;I know much of its secret history, and though mine eyes had
    until now never beheld thy loveliness, yet had mine ears heard much of thy
    power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet at its first encounter thou didst defy it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no mother to mourn o&rsquo;er my death like young Decretas,&rdquo; he
    said curtly, &ldquo;nor yet a wife to make into a sorrowing widow like the
    sculptor Menas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If it was his desire to break through the barrier of well-nigh insolent
    calm which she seemed to have set round her dainty person, then he succeeded
    over well, for she winced at his words like one who has received a blow and
    her eyes, dark with anger, narrowed until they became mere slits fringed
    by her golden lashes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But thou hast a life, Taurus Antinor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
    life is a precious possession.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shrugged his massive shoulders, and a curious smile played round his
    lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And thou canst order that precious possession to be taken from me,&rdquo;  he
    said lightly. &ldquo;Is that what thou wouldst say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That and more, for thou hast other precious treasures more precious,
    mayhap, than life; so guard them well, O Taurus Antinor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, gracious lady,&rdquo; he rejoined, still smiling, &ldquo;I have
    but one soul as I have one life, and that too is in the hands of God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of which god?&rdquo; she asked quaintly.</p>
  <p>He did not reply but pointed upwards at the vivid dome of blue against which
    the white of Phrygian marbles glittered in the sun.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of Him Whose Empire is mightier than that of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked on him in astonishment. Apparently she did not understand him,
    nor did he try to explain, but it seemed to her as if his whole appearance
    had changed suddenly, and her thoughts flew back to that which she had witnessed
    a year ago when she was in Ostia and she had seen a raging tempest become
    suddenly stilled. &ldquo;There is no mightier empire than that of Rome,&rdquo; she
    said proudly, &ldquo;and methinks thou art a traitor, oh Taurus Antinor,
    else thou wouldst not speak of any emperor save of C&aelig;sar, my kinsman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I spoke not of an emperor, gracious lady,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But thy thoughts were of one whose empire was mightier than that
    of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My thoughts,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;were of a Man Whom I saw whilst
    travelling through Jud&aelig;a a few years ago. He was poor and dwelt among
    the fishermen of Galilee. They stood around Him and listened whilst He talked;
    when He walked they followed Him, for a halo of glory was upon Him and the
    words which He spoke were such that once heard they could never be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didst thou too hear those marvellous words, O Taurus Antinor?&rdquo; she
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only twice,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;did I hear the words which
    He spoke. I mingled with the crowd, and once when His eyes fell upon me,
    it seemed to me as if all the secrets of life and death were suddenly revealed
    to me. His eyes fell upon me.... I was one of a multitude ... but from that
    moment I knew that life on this earth would never be precious to me again&mdash;since
    the most precious gift man hath is his immortality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou speakest of strange matters, O praefect,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;and
    meseems there&rsquo;s treason in what thou sayest. Who is this man, whose
    very look hath made a slave of thee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A slave to His will thou sayest truly, O daughter of C&aelig;sar!
    Could I hear His command I would follow Him through life and to death. At
    times even now meseems that I can hear His voice and see His eyes ... thou
    hast never seen such eyes, Augusta&mdash;fixed upon my very soul. I saw them
    just now, right across the Forum, when the wretched freedwoman clung shrieking
    round my shins. They looked at me and <i>asked</i> me to be merciful; they
    did not command, they begged ... <i>asking</i> for the pity that lay dormant
    in my soul. And now I know that if those same eyes looked at me again and
    asked for every drop of my blood, if they asked me to bear death, torture,
    or even shame, I would become as thou truly sayest&mdash;a slave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once or twice whilst he spoke she had tried to interrupt him, but every
    time the words she would have spoken had died upon her lips. He looked so
    strange&mdash;this praefect of Rome&mdash;whose judgments everyone feared,
    whose strict adherence to duty the young elegants of the day were ever fond
    of deriding. He looked very strange now and spoke such strange words&mdash;words
    that she resented bitterly, for they sounded like treason to the House of
    C&aelig;sar of which she was so coldly proud.</p>
  <p>To her C&aelig;sar was as a god, and she as his kinswoman had been brought
    up to worship in him not the man&mdash;that might be vile&mdash;but the supreme
    power in the Empire which he represented. She did not pause to think if he
    were base, tyrannical, a half-crazy despot without mind or heart or sensibilities.
    She knew what was said about him, she had even seen at times things from
    which she recoiled in unspeakable horror; but her soul, still pure and still
    proud, was able to dissociate the abstract idea of the holy and mighty C&aelig;sar
    from its present hideous embodiment. And this same holy reverence for C&aelig;sar
    she looked for in all those who she deemed were worthy to stand&mdash;not
    as his equals, for only the gods were that&mdash;but nigh to his holy person&mdash;his
    own kinsmen first, then his Senate, his magistrates, and his patricians,
    and above all this man&mdash;almost a stranger&mdash;whom the C&aelig;sar
    had deigned to honour with his confidence.</p>
  <p>And yet this same stranger spoke calmly of another, of a man whom he would
    obey as a slave in all things, whom he would follow even to death; a man
    whose might he proclaimed above that of C&aelig;sar himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But who is this man?&rdquo; she exclaimed at last, almost involuntarily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A poor Man from Galilee,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is he called?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out there they called Him Jesus of Nazareth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He died upon the cross, in Jerusalem, seven years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon the cross?&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;what had he done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He had dwelt among the poor and brought them contentment and peace;
    He had lived amongst men and taught them love and charity. So the Roman proconsul
    ordered Him to be crucified, and those whom He had rendered happy rejoiced
    over His death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Methinks that I did hear something of this. I was a child then but
    already I took much interest in the affairs of State, and my father spoke
    oft freely in my presence. I remember his talking of a demagogue over in
    Jud&aelig;a who claimed to be the King of the Jews and who was punished for
    treason and sedition. But I also heard that he did but little mischief, since
    only a troop of ignorant fisher-folk followed and listened to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ignorant fisher-folk thou saidst it truly, O Dea Flavia, yet I have
    it in my mind that anon the knee of every patrician&mdash;aye! of every C&aelig;sar&mdash;shall
    bend before the mighty throne of that Man from Galilee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And thus didst learn thy lesson of treason, O praefect,&rdquo; she
    retorted;  &ldquo;demagogues and traitors from Jud&aelig;a have sown the
    seeds of treachery in thy mind, and whilst thou dost receive with both hands
    the gifts of the C&aelig;sar my kinsman, thou dost set up another above him
    and dost homage to him in thy heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! in my heart, gracious lady; for I am even more ignorant than
    those fishermen from Galilee who heard every word spoken by Jesus of Nazareth.
    I heard Him but twice in my life and once only did His eyes rest upon me,
    and they enchained my heart to His service, though I know but little yet
    of what He would have me do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt he would have thee turn traitor to thine Emperor and to
    acclaim him&mdash;the demagogue&mdash;as imperator before the Senate and
    the army. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told thee that He was dead,&rdquo; he interposed simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that his words had made thee rebellious to C&aelig;sar and insolent
    to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thine humble servant, O Augusta,&rdquo; he rejoined, smiling in spite
    of himself, for now she was just like an angry child. &ldquo;Wilt but command
    and see how I will obey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The girl Nola!&rdquo; she said haughtily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In that alone I must deny thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then tie my shoe, it hath come undone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The tone with which she said this was so arrogant and so harsh that even
    her slaves behind her turned frightened eyes on the praefect who was known
    to be so proud, and on whom the curt command must have had the effect of
    a sudden whip-lash on the face.</p>
  <p>She had spoken as if to the humblest of her menials, finding pleasure in
    putting this insult on the man who had dared to thwart and irritate her;
    but she had not spoken deliberately; it had been an impulse, an irresistible
    desire to see him down on his knees, in a position only fit for slaves.</p>
  <p>Directly the words had left her mouth, she already regretted them, for his
    refusal now would have been doubly humiliating for herself, and her good
    sense had told her already that no patrician&mdash;least of all Taurus Antinor&mdash;would
    submit quietly to public insult and ridicule even from her.</p>
  <p>The quick, more gentle word was already on her lips, the look of mute apology
    was struggling to her eyes, when to her astonishment the praefect, without
    a word, was down on his knees before her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I did but jest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The honour,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;is too great, O daughter
    of C&aelig;sar, that I should forego it now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His powerful shoulders were bent almost to the level of the ground, and
    she looked down on him, more puzzled than ever at this stranger whose every
    action seemed different from those of his fellow-men. She put her little
    foot slightly forward, and as he tied the string of her shoe she saw how
    slender was his hand, firm yet tapering down to the elegant finger-tips;
    the hand of a patrician even though he hailed from the barbaric North.</p>
  <p>Suddenly she smiled. But this he did not see for he was still intent upon
    the shoe, but she felt that those slender hands of his were singularly clumsy.
    And she smiled because she had recollected how like his fellowmen he really
    was, how he evidently forgot his wrath and sank his pride for the pleasure
    of kneeling at her feet.</p>
  <p>To this homage she was well accustomed. Many there were in Rome who at this
    moment would gladly have changed places with the praefect. More than one
    great patrician had craved the honour of tying her shoe, more than one patrician
    hand had trembled whilst performing this service.</p>
  <p>And Dea Flavia smiled because already she guessed&mdash;or thought that
    she guessed&mdash;what would follow the tying of her shoe&mdash;a humble
    kiss upon her foot, the natural homage of a man to her beauty and to her
    power.</p>
  <p>The daughter of C&aelig;sar smiled because the spirit of child-like waywardness
    was in her, and she thought that she would like the slave-like homage from
    this man whom her wrath and threats had left impassive but whom her beauty
    had at last brought down to his knees; and thus smiling she waited patiently,
    content that he should be clumsy, glad that in the distance, under the arcade
    of the tabernae, she had spied Hortensius Martius watching with wrathful
    eyes every movement of the praefect. She wondered if the young exquisite
    had heard the wordy warfare between herself and the proud man who now knelt
    quite awkwardly at her feet, and she guessed that what Hortensius had seen
    and heard, that he would retail at full length to his friends in the course
    of the banquet given by Caius Nepos to-morrow night.</p>
  <p>For the moment she felt almost sorry for the giant brought down to his knees;
    the kiss which she so confidently anticipated would of a truth complete his
    surrender, since she had resolved to make him kiss the dust by suddenly withdrawing
    her foot from under his lips, and then to laugh at him, and to allow her
    slaves to laugh and jeer at him as he lay sprawling in the dust, his huge
    arms lying crosswise on the flagstones before her.</p>
  <p>The spirit of mischief was in her, the love to tease a helpless giant; so
    for the nonce anger almost died out within her and her eyes looked clear
    and blue as triumph and joy danced within their depths.</p>
  <p>But now Taurus Antinor had finished tying her shoe. He did not stoop further
    nor did he embrace the dust; but he straightened his broad shoulders and
    raised himself from his knees without rendering that homage which was expected
    of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hast further commands for thy servant, O daughter of C&aelig;sar?&rdquo; he
    asked calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; she replied curtly.</p>
  <p>And calling her slaves to her she entered her litter, and drew its curtains
    closely round her so that she should no longer be offended by his sight.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.&rdquo;&mdash;Psalm
    14. 1.</p>
  <p>And late that day when Dea Flavia was preparing for rest she dismissed her
    tire-women, keeping only her young slaves around her, and then ordered Licinia
    to attend on her this night.</p>
  <p>Licinia was highly privileged in the house of Dea Flavia. She had nursed
    the daughter of proud Claudius Octavius at her breast, and between the wizened
    old woman and the fresh young girl there existed perfect friendship and the
    confidence born of years. Dea&rsquo;s first tooth was in Licinia&rsquo;s
    keeping and so was the first lock of hair cut from Dea&rsquo;s head. Licinia
    had been the confidante of Dea&rsquo;s first childish sorrow and was the
    first to hear the tales of the young girl&rsquo;s social triumphs.</p>
  <p>No one but Licinia was allowed to handle Dea&rsquo;s hair. It was her shrivelled
    fingers that plaited every night the living stream of gold into innumerable
    little plaits, so that the ripple in it might continue to live again on the
    morrow. It was Licinia who rubbed Dea&rsquo;s exquisite limbs with unguents
    after the bath, and she who trimmed the rose-tinted nails into their perfect,
    pointed shape.</p>
  <p>To-night Dea Flavia was lying on a couch covered with crimson silk. Her
    elbows were buried in a cushion stuffed with eiderdown, her chin rested in
    her two hands and her eyes were fixed on a mirror of polished bronze held
    up by one of her younger slaves.</p>
  <p>Licinia, stooping over the reclining body of her mistress, was gently rubbing
    the white shoulders and spine with sweet-scented oil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And didst see it all, Licinia?&rdquo; asked Dea Flavia, as with a
    lazy stretch of her graceful arms she suddenly swung herself round on to
    her back and looked straight up at the wrinkled old face bending tenderly
    over her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, my precious,&rdquo; replied Licinia eagerly, &ldquo;everything
    did I see; for thou didst draw the curtains of thy litter together so quickly,
    I had no time to take my place by thy side. I meant to follow immediately,
    and was only waiting there for a moment or two until the crowd of thy retinue
    had dispersed along the various streets. Then it was that I spied my lord
    Hortensius, and something in the expression of his face made me pause then
    and there to see if there was aught amiss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And was aught amiss with my lord Hortensius?&rdquo; asked Dea Flavia
    with studied indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He looked wrathful as a tiger in the arena when the guards come and
    snatch his prey from him. There was a frown on his face darker than that
    which usually sits on Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s brow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was angered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! at the praefect,&rdquo; rejoined Licinia. &ldquo;He strode forward
    from under the arcades directly after the crowd of thy slaves had disappeared,
    and the Forum was all deserted save for Taurus Antinor standing there as
    if he had been carved in marble and in bronze and rooted there to the spot.
    My lord Hortensius came close up to the praefect and greeted him curtly.
    I dared no longer move away lest I should be seen, so I hid in the deep shadow
    behind the rostrum, and I heard Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s response to my lord
    Hortensius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; said Dea Flavia impatiently, &ldquo;of course they
    greeted one another ere they came to blows. But &rsquo;tis of the blows I
    would like to hear, and what my lord Hortensius said to the praefect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He spoke to him of thee, my child, and taunted him with having angered
    thee,&rdquo; said Licinia. &ldquo;The praefect is so proud and so impatient,
    I marvelled then he did not hit my lord Hortensius in the face at once. He
    looked so huge, I bethought me of a giant, and his head looked dark like
    the bronze head of Jupiter, for his face had flushed a deep and angry crimson,
    whilst his mighty fists were clenched as if ready to strike.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What caused him to strike, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord Hortensius called him a stranger, and this the praefect did
    not seem to resent. &lsquo;There are other lands than Rome,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and
    one of these gave my ancestors birth. Proud am I of my distant land, and
    proud now to be a patrician of Rome.&rsquo; Then did my lord Hortensius break
    into loud laughter, which to mine ears sounded mirthless and forced. He raised
    his hand and pointed a finger at the praefect and shouted, still laughing: &lsquo;Thou
    a patrician of Rome? thou a tyrant&rsquo;s minion! slave and son of slave!
    Nay! if the patriciate of Rome had its will with thee, it would have thee
    publicly whipped and branded like the arrogant menial that thou art!&rsquo; This
    and more did my lord Hortensius say,&rdquo; continued Licinia, whose voice
    now had sunk to an awed whisper at the recollection of the sacrilege; &ldquo;I
    hardly dared to breathe for I could see the praefect&rsquo;s face, and could
    think of naught save the wrath of Jupiter, when on a sultry evening the thunder
    clouds are gathering in the wake of the setting sun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Dea Flavia&rsquo;s interest in the narrative seemed suddenly to have
    flagged. She stretched her arms, yawned ostentatiously, and with the movement
    of a fretful child she threw herself once more flat upon the couch, with
    her elbows in the cushions and her face buried in her hands.</p>
  <p>With some impatience she snatched the mirror from the young slave&rsquo;s
    hand, and then she put it on the pillow and looked straight down into it,
    whilst her hair fell like golden curtains down each side of her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Licinia,&rdquo; she said with curt indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is but little more to tell,&rdquo; said the old woman, who
    with stolid placidness had resumed her former occupation, and once more rubbed
    the white shoulders with the sweet-smelling unguent; &ldquo;nor could I tell
    thee how it all happened. A sort of tempestuous whirlwind seemed to sweep
    before my eyes, and the next thing that I saw clearly was an enormous figure
    clad in a gorgeous tunic, and standing high, high above me on the very top
    of the marble rostrum beside the bronze figure of the god. It was the praefect.
    From where I stood, palsied with fear, I could see his face, dark now as
    the very thunders of Jupiter, his hair around his head gleamed like copper
    in the sun; but what caused my very blood to freeze and the marrow to stiffen
    in my bones, was to see his two mighty arms high above his head holding the
    body of my lord Hortensius. He looked up there like some god-like giant about
    to hurl an enemy down from the mountains of Olympus. The rostrum stands a
    terrific height above the pavement of the Forum; the marble balustrades,
    the outstanding gradients, the carvings along its sides, all stood between
    that inert body held up aloft by those gigantic arms and the flagstones below
    where Death, hideous and yawning, seemed to be waiting for its prey. And
    still the praefect did not move, and I could see the muscles of his arms
    swollen like cords and the sinews of his hands almost cracking beneath the
    weight of my lord Hortensius&rsquo; body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Licinia paused and passed a wrinkled hand over her moist forehead. She was
    trembling even now at the recollection of what she had seen. The beautiful
    figure lying stretched out upon the couch had not moved in a single one of
    its graceful lines. The tiny head beneath its crown of gold was bent down
    upon the mirror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldst see my lord Hortensius&rsquo; face?&rdquo; came in the same
    cold tones of indifference from behind the veil of wavy hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Licinia. &ldquo;I thank the gods that I could not.
    One cry for mercy did he utter, one cry of horror when first he felt himself
    uplifted and looked down into the awful face of Death which awaited him below.
    Then mayhap he lost consciousness for I heard not a sound, and the whole
    city lay still in the hush of the noonday sleep. Less than one minute had
    intervened since first I saw that avenging figure outlined against the blue
    curtain of the sky: less than one minute even whilst my heart had ceased
    to beat. And then did a cry of horror escape my lips, and the praefect looked
    down into my face. Nor did he move as yet, but slowly meseemed as if the
    ruddy glow died from out his cheeks and brow, and after a while the tension
    on the mighty arms relaxed, and slowly were they lowered from above his head.
    He no longer was looking at me now, for his eyes were fixed upon the distant
    sky, as if they saw there something that called with irresistible power.
    And upon the heat-laden air there trembled a long sigh as of infinite longing.
    Then the praefect gathered my lord Hortensius&rsquo; inanimate body in his
    arms as a mother would her own child, and with slow and steady steps he descended
    the gradients of the rostrum. At its foot he caught sight of me, and called
    me to him: &lsquo;My lord hath only fainted,&rsquo; he said to me; &lsquo;do
    thou chafe his hands and soothe his forehead, whilst I send his slaves to
    him.&rsquo; He laid the precious burden down in the cool shadow, taking off
    his own cloak and making of it a pillow for my lord Hortensius&rsquo; head.
    Then he went from me, and as he went I could hear him murmur: &lsquo;In Thy
    service, oh Man of Galilee.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>Even as these last words still trembled on Licinia&rsquo;s lips there came
    a sharp cry of rage, followed by one of terror, as with quick and almost
    savage movement Dea Flavia picked up the heavy mirror of bronze and hurled
    it across the chamber. It fell with a loud crash against the delicate mosaic
    of the floor, but as it swung through the air its sharp metal edge hit a
    young slave girl on the shoulder; a few drops of blood trickled down her
    breast and she began to whimper in her fright.</p>
  <p>It had all happened so suddenly that no one&mdash;least of all Licinia&mdash;could
    guess what it was that had so angered my lady. Dea Flavia had raised herself
    to a sitting posture, and thrown her hair back, away from her face which
    looked flushed and wrathful, whilst two sharp furrows appeared between her
    brows.</p>
  <p>The women were silent, feeling awed and not a little frightened; the girl,
    whose shoulder was now bleeding profusely, continued her whimpering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get up, girl,&rdquo; said Licinia roughly, &ldquo;and staunch thy
    scratch elsewhere, away from my lady&rsquo;s sight. Hark at the baggage!
    One would think she is really hurt. Get thee gone, I say, ere I give thee
    better cause for whining.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But in a moment Dea Flavia was on her feet. With a quick cry of pity she
    ran to her slave, kneeled beside her and with a fine white cloth herself
    tried to staunch the wound.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Art hurt?&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;art hurt, child? I did not
    wish to hurt thee. Stop thy weeping&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll give thee that amber
    locket which thou dost covet so. Stop thy weeping, I say! Is it my white
    rabbit thou dost hanker after&mdash;thou shalt have it for thine own&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;the
    woollen tunic with the embroidered bands&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;Stop whining,
    girl,&rdquo; she added impatiently, seeing that the girl, more frightened
    than hurt, was sobbing louder than before. &ldquo;Licinia, make her stop&mdash;she
    angers me with all this whining&mdash;stop, I tell thee. Oh, Licinia, where
    is thy whip? I vow I&rsquo;ll have the girl whipped if she do not stop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Licinia, accustomed to her mistress&rsquo;s quick changing moods, had
    in her turn knelt beside the girl and was busy now with deft hands in staunching
    the blood and tying up the wound. This done she dragged the child up roughly,
    though not unkindly, from the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get thee gone and lie down on thy bed,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;shame
    on thee for making such a to-do. My lady had no wish to hurt thee, and thou
    hast upset her with all this senseless weeping. Get thee gone now ere I do
    give thee that whipping which thou dost well deserve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She contrived to push the girl out of the chamber and ordered two others
    to follow and look after her; then once more she turned to her mistress,
    ready to tender fond apologies since what she had said had so angered her
    beloved.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia had thrown herself on the couch on her back; her arms were folded
    behind her head, her fair hair lay in heavy masses on the embroidered coverlet.
    She was staring straight up at the ceiling, her blue eyes wide open, and
    a puzzled frown across her brow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My precious one,&rdquo; murmured Licinia.</p>
  <p>But Dea Flavia apparently did not hear. It seemed as if she were grappling
    in her mind with some worrying puzzle, the solution of which lay hidden up
    there behind that brilliant bit of blue sky which glimmered through the square
    opening in the roof.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My precious one,&rdquo; reiterated the old woman appealingly, &ldquo;tell
    me, Dea&mdash;was it aught that I said which angered thee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia turned large wondering eyes to her old nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Licinia,&rdquo; she said slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my goddess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If a man saith that there is one greater, mightier than C&aelig;sar
    ... he is a traitor, is he not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A black and villainous traitor, Augusta,&rdquo; said Licinia, whose
    voice at the mere suggestion had become hoarse with awe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what in Rome is the punishment for such traitors, Licinia?&rdquo; asked
    the young girl, still speaking slowly and measuredly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death, my child,&rdquo; replied the old woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only death?&rdquo; insisted Dea, whilst the puzzled look in her eyes
    became more marked, and the frown between her brows more deep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not understand thee, my precious one,&rdquo; said Licinia whose
    turn it was now to be deeply puzzled; &ldquo;what greater punishment could
    there be for a traitor than that of death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They torture slaves for lesser offences than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! and for sedition there is always the cross.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cross!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! Dost remember seven years ago in Jud&aelig;a? There was a man
    who raised sedition among the Jews, and called himself their king&mdash;setting
    himself above C&aelig;sar and above the might of C&aelig;sar.... They crucified
    him. Dost remember?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have heard of him,&rdquo; she said curtly. &ldquo;What was his
    name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I have forgot. Methinks that he came from Galilee. They did
    crucify him because of sedition, and because he set himself to be above C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And above the House of C&aelig;sar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! above the House of C&aelig;sar too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And they crucified him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! like a common thief. &lsquo;Twas right and just since he rebelled
    against C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet, Licinia, there are those in Rome who do him service even
    now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The gods forbid!&rdquo; exclaimed Licinia in horror. &ldquo;And how
    could that be?&rdquo; she added with a shrug of the shoulders, &ldquo;seeing
    that he died such a shameful death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I marvel on that also,&rdquo; said the young girl, whose wide-open
    blue eyes once more assumed their strangely puzzled expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I&rsquo;ll not believe it,&rdquo; rejoined the old woman hotly. &ldquo;Do
    that man service? A common traitor who died upon the cross. Who did stuff
    thine ears, my goddess, with such foolish tales?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one told me foolish tales, Licinia. But this I do know, that there
    are some in Rome who set that Galilean above the majesty of C&aelig;sar,
    and in his name do defy C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s might.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are madmen then,&rdquo; said the slave curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or traitors,&rdquo; added Dea Flavia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou sayest it; they are traitors and rebels, and never fear, they&rsquo;ll
    be punished ... sooner or later, they will be punished.... Defy the might
    of C&aelig;sar?... Great gods above! the impious wretches! thou wert right,
    my princess! Death alone were too merciful for them.... The scourge first
    ... and then the cross ... that will teach them the might of thy house, oh
    daughter of C&aelig;sar.... I would have no mercy with them.... Throw them
    to the beasts, say I!... brand them ... scourge them ... wring their heart&rsquo;s
    blood until they cry for death...!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old pagan looked evil and cruel in her fury of loyalty to that house
    which begat her beloved Dea. Her eyes glistened as those of a cat waiting
    to fall upon its prey; her wrinkled hands looked like claws that were ready
    to tear the very flesh and sinew from the traitor&rsquo;s breast. Her voice,
    always hoarse and trembling, had risen to a savage shriek which died away
    as in a passionate outburst of love she threw herself down on the floor beside
    the couch, and taking Dea&rsquo;s tiny feet between her hands, she covered
    them with kisses and with tears.</p>
  <p>But Dea Flavia once more lay back on the coverlet of crimson silk and her
    blue eyes once more were fixed upwards to the sky. Above her the glint of
    blue was now suffused with tones of pink merging into mauve; somewhere out
    west the sun was slowly sinking into rest. Tiny golden clouds flitted swiftly
    across that patch of sky on which Dea Flavia gazed so intently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come kiss me, Licinia,&rdquo; she said slowly after a while. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    to rest now. To-morrow I shall see my kinsman the C&aelig;sar again, after
    a year&rsquo;s absence from him. I desire to be very beautiful to-morrow,
    Licinia, for mayhap I&rsquo;ll to the games with him. That new tunic worked
    with purple and gold. I&rsquo;ll wear that and my new shoes of antelope skin.
    In my hair the circlet of turquoise and pearls ... dost think it&rsquo;ll
    become me, Licinia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou wilt be more beautiful, my precious one, than man&rsquo;s eyes
    can conveniently endure,&rdquo; said Licinia, whose whole face became radiant
    with the joy of her perfect love for the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! thou hast soothed my heart and mind, Licinia. I feel that I shall
    sleep well to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She allowed the old woman to lead her gently to her bedchamber, where within
    the narrow alcove she lay all that night tossing upon the silken mattress
    that was stuffed with eiderdown. Sleep would not come to her, and hour after
    hour she lay there, her eyes fixed into the darkness on which, at times,
    her fevered fancy traced a glowing cross.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is
    of the Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;Proverbs 16. 33.</p>
  <p>And even thus did the mighty Empire hurry headlong to its fall; with shouts
    of joy and cries of exultation, with triumphal processions, with music, with
    games and with flowers.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar had returned from Germany and Gaul having played his part
    of mountebank upon the arena of the world. Eaten up with senseless and cynical
    vanity, Caius Julius C&aelig;sar Caligula desired to be the C&aelig;sar of
    his army as he was princeps and imperator, high pontiff and supreme dictator
    of the Empire. But as there was no war to conduct, no rebellion to subdue,
    he had invented a war and harassed some barbarians who had no thought save
    that of peace.</p>
  <p>He stage-managed conspiracies and midnight attacks, drilling his own soldiers
    into acting the parts of malcontents, of escaped prisoners, of bloodthirsty
    barbarians, the while he himself&mdash;as chief actor in the play&mdash;vanquished
    the mock foes and took from them mock spoils of war.</p>
  <p>Then he upbraided Rome for her inertia whilst he, the Emperor, confronted
    dangers and endured hardships for her sake. His letters, full of glowing
    accounts of his supposed prowess, of the ferocity of the enemy, of the fruits
    of victory snatched at the cost of innumerable sacrifices were solemnly read
    to the assembled senators in the temple of Mars, and to a vast concourse
    of people gathered in the Forum.</p>
  <p>They listened to these letters with awe and reverence proud of the valour
    of their C&aelig;sar, rejoicing in the continued glory of the mightiest Empire
    of the world&mdash;their own Empire which they, the masters of the earth
    and of the sea, had made under the guidance of rulers such as he who even
    now was returning laurel-laden and victory-crowned from Germany.</p>
  <p>And the triumphal procession was begun. First came the galley in which Caligula
    was said to have crossed the ocean for the purpose of subduing some rebel
    British princes, but in which he in verity had spent some pleasant days fishing
    in the bay. It was brought back to Rome in solemn state by land, right across
    the country of the Allemanni and carried the whole of the way by sixteen
    stalwart barbarians&mdash;supposed prisoners of war.</p>
  <p>The galley was received with imperial honours as if it had been a human
    creature&mdash;the very person of the C&aelig;sar. In the presence of a huge
    and enthusiastic crowd it was taken to the temple of Mars, where the pontiffs,
    attired in their festal robes, dedicated it with solemn ritual to the god
    of war and finally deposited it in a specially constructed cradle fashioned
    of citrus wood with elaborate carvings and touches of gilding thereon; the
    whole resting upon a pedestal of African marble.</p>
  <p>Upon the next day a procession of Gauls entered the city carrying helmets
    which were filled with sea-shells. The men wore their hair long and unkempt,
    they were naked save for a goatskin tied across the torso with a hempen rope
    and their shins were encircled with leather bands. The helmets were said
    to have belonged to those of C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s soldiers who had lost their
    lives in the expedition against the Germans, and the sea-shells were a special
    tribute from the ocean to the gods of the Capitol. By the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    orders the helmets were to be the objects of semi-divine honours in memory
    of the illustrious dead.</p>
  <p>Thus the tragi-comedy went on day after day. The plebs enjoying the pageants
    because they did not know that they were being fooled, and the patricians
    looking on because they did not care.</p>

  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>And now the imperial mountebank was coming home himself, having ordered
    his triumph as he had stage-managed his deeds of valour. Triumphal arches
    and street decorations, flowers and processions, he had ordained everything
    just as he wished it to be. From the statue of every god in the temples of
    the Capitol and of the Forum the bronze head had been knocked off by his
    orders, and a likeness of his own head placed in substitution. His intention
    was to receive divine homage, and this the plebs&mdash;who had been promised
    a succession of holidays, with races, games, and combats&mdash;was over-ready
    to grant him.</p>
  <p>The vestibule connecting his palace with the temple of Castor had been completed
    in his absence, and he wished to pass surreptitiously from his own apartments
    to the very niche of the idol which was in full view of the Forum and there
    to show himself to the people, even whilst a sacrifice was offered to him
    as to a god.</p>
  <p>To all this senseless display of egregious vanity the obsequiousness of
    the senators and the careless frivolity of the plebs easily lent itself;
    nor did anyone demur at the decree which came from the absent hero, that
    he should in future be styled: &ldquo;The Father of the Armies! the Greatest
    and best of C&aelig;sars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All thought of dignity was dead in these descendants of the great people
    who had made the Empire; they had long ago sold their birthright of valour
    and of honour for the pottage of luxury and the favours of a tyrannical madman.
    What cared they if after they had feasted and shouted themselves hoarse in
    praise of a deified brute, the ruins of Rome came crashing down over their
    graves? What cared they if in far-off barbaric lands the Goths and Huns were
    already whetting their steel.</p>
  <p>Only a few among the more dignified senators, a few among the more sober
    praetorian tribunes, revolted in their heart at this insane exhibition of
    egoism, these perpetual outrages on common sense and dignity; but they were
    few and their influence small, and they were really too indolent, too comfortable
    in their luxurious homes to do aught but accept what they deemed inevitable.</p>
  <p>The only men in Rome who cared were the ambitious and the self-seekers,
    and they cared not because of Rome, not because of the glory of the Empire,
    or the welfare of the land, but because they saw in the very excess of the
    tyrant&rsquo;s misrule the best chance for their own supremacy and power.</p>
  <p>Foremost amongst these was Caius Nepos, the praetorian praefect, all-powerful
    in the absence of the C&aelig;sar, well liked by the army, so &lsquo;twas
    said. Some influential friends clung around him and also some malcontents,
    those who are ever on the spot when destruction is to be accomplished, ever
    ready to overthrow any government which does not happen to further their
    ambitions.</p>
  <p>Most of these men were assembled this night beneath the gilded roof of Caius
    Nepos&rsquo; house. He had gathered all his friends round him, had feasted
    them with good viands and costly wines, with roasted peacocks from Gaul and
    mullets come straight from the sea; he had amused them with oriental dancers
    and Egyptian acrobats, and when they had eaten and drunk their fill he bade
    them good night and sent them home, laden with gifts. But his intimates remained
    behind; pretending to leave with the others, they lingered on in the atrium,
    chatting of indifferent topics amongst themselves, until all had gone whose
    presence would not be wanted in the conclave that was to take place.</p>
  <p>There were now some forty of them in number, rich patricians all of them,
    their ages ranging from that of young Escanes who was just twenty years old
    to that of Marcus Ancyrus, the elder, who had turned sixty. Their combined
    wealth mayhap would have purchased every inhabited house in the entire civilised
    world or every slave who was ever put up in the market. Marcus Ancyrus, they
    say, could have pulled down every temple in the Forum and rebuilt it at his
    own cost, and Philippus Decius who was there had recently spent the sum of
    fifty million sesterces upon the building and equipment of his new villa
    at Herculaneum.</p>
  <p>Young Hortensius Martius was there, too, he who was said to own more slaves
    than anyone else in Rome, and Augustus Philario of the household of C&aelig;sar,
    who had once declared that he would give one hundred thousand aurei for a
    secret poison that would defy detection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why is not Taurus Antinor here this evening?&rdquo; asked Marcus
    Ancyrus when this little group of privileged guests once more turned back
    toward the triclinium.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that he will be here anon,&rdquo; replied the host. &ldquo;I
    have sent him word that I desired speech with him on business of the State
    and that I craved the honour of his company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They all assembled at the head of the now deserted tables. The few slaves
    who had remained at the bidding of their master had re-draped the couches
    and re-set the crystal goblets of wine and the gold dishes with fresh fruit.
    The long narrow hall looked strangely mournful now that the noisy guests
    had departed, and the sweet-scented oil in the lamps had begun to burn low.</p>
  <p>The table, laden with empty jars, with broken goblets, and remnants of fruits
    and cakes, looked uninviting and even weird in its aspect of departed cheer.
    The couches beneath their tumbled draperies of richly dyed silk looked bedraggled
    and forlorn, whilst the stains of wine upon the fine white cloths looked
    like widening streams of blood. Under the shadows of elaborate carvings in
    the marble of the walls ghost-like shadows flickered and danced as the smoke
    from the oil lamp wound its spiral curves upwards to the gilded ceiling above.
    And in the great vases of priceless murra roses and lilies and white tuberoses,
    the spoils of costly glasshouses, were slowly drooping in the heavy atmosphere.
    The whole room, despite its rich hangings and gilded pillars, wore a curious
    air of desolation and of gloom; mayhap Caius Nepos himself was conscious
    of this, for as he followed his guests from out the atrium he gave three
    loud claps with his hands, and a troupe of young girls came in carrying bunches
    of fresh flowers and some newly filled lamps.</p>
  <p>These they placed at the head of the table, there, where the couches surrounding
    it were draped with crimson silk, and soft downy cushions, well shaken up,
    once more called to rest and good cheer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you all take your places,&rdquo; said the host pleasantly, &ldquo;and
    let us resume our supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave a sign to a swarthy-looking slave, who, clad all in white, was presiding
    at a gorgeous buffet carved of solid citrus-wood which&mdash;despite the
    fact that supper had just been served to two hundred guests&mdash;was once
    more groaning under the weight of mammoth dishes filled with the most complicated
    products of culinary art.</p>
  <p>The slave, at his master&rsquo;s sign, touched a silver gong, and half a
    dozen henchmen in linen tunics brought in the steaming dishes fresh from
    the kitchens. The carver set to and attacked with long sharp knife the gigantic
    capons which one of the bearers had placed before him. He carved with quickness
    and dexterity, placing well-chosen morsels on the plates of massive gold
    which young waiting-maids then carried to the guests.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wilt dismiss thy slaves before we talk?&rdquo; asked Marcus Ancyrus,
    the veteran in this small crowd. He himself had been silent for the past
    ten minutes, doing full justice to this second relay of Caius Nepos&rsquo; hospitality.</p>
  <p>The waiting-maids were going the round now with gilt basins and cloths of
    fine white linen for the cleansing and drying of fingers between the courses;
    others, in the meanwhile, filled the crystal goblets with red or white wine
    as the guests desired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can talk now,&rdquo; said the host; &ldquo;these slaves will not
    heed us. They,&rdquo;  he added, nodding in the direction of the carver and
    his half-dozen henchmen, &ldquo;are all deaf as well as mute, so we need
    have no fear of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What treasures,&rdquo; ejaculated young Escanes with wondering eyes
    fixed upon his lucky host; &ldquo;where didst get them, Caius Nepos? By the
    gods, I would I could get an army of deaf-mute slaves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are not easy to get,&rdquo; rejoined the other, &ldquo;but I
    was mightily lucky in my find. I was at Cirta in Numidia at a time when the
    dusky chief there&mdash;one named Hazim Rhan&mdash;had made a haul of six
    malcontents who I understood had conspired against his authority. It seems
    that these rebels had a leader who had succeeded in escaping to his desert
    fastness, and whom Hazim Rhan greatly desired to capture. To gain this object
    he commanded the six prisoners to betray their leader; this they refused
    to do, whereupon the dusky prince ordered their ears to be cut off and threatened
    them that unless they spoke on the morrow, their tongues would be cut off
    the next day. And if after that they still remained obdurate, their heads
    would go the way of their tongues and ears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Exclamations of horror greeted this gruesome tale, the relevancy of which
    no one had as yet perceived. But Caius Nepos, having pledged his friends
    in a draught of Sicilian wine, resumed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, as an idle traveller from Rome had been received by the dusky
    chieftain with marked deference, and I was greatly interested in the fate
    of the six men who proved so loyal to their leader. So I waited three days,
    and when their tongues and ears had been cut off and their heads were finally
    threatened, I offered to buy them for a sum sufficiently large to tempt the
    cupidity of Hazim Rhan. And thus I had in my possession six men whose sense
    of loyalty had been splendidly proved and whose discretion henceforth would
    necessarily be absolute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This time a chorus of praise greeted the conclusion of the tale. The cynical
    calm with which it had been told and the ferocious selfishness which it revealed
    seemed in no way repellent to Caius Nepos&rsquo; guests. A few pairs of indifferent
    eyes were levelled at the slaves and that was all. And then Philippus Decius
    remarked coolly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So much for thy carvers and henchmen, O Caius Nepos, but thy waiting-maids?&mdash;are
    they deaf and dumb too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the host, &ldquo;but they come from foreign lands
    and do not understand our tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you all think that the next few days will be propitious for
    our schemes?&rdquo; here broke in young Escanes who seemed the most eager
    amongst them all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; said Caius Nepos, &ldquo;with a little good luck even
    to-morrow might prove the best day. The C&aelig;sar is half frenzied now,
    gorged with his triumph, the mockery of which he does not seem to understand.
    He is more like a raving madman than ever, much more feeble in mind and body
    than before this insensate expedition to Germany.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose that there is no doubt as to the truth of the tales which
    are current about the expedition,&rdquo; quoth Marcus Ancyrus, whose years
    rendered him more cautious than the others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt whatever,&rdquo; rejoined the host, &ldquo;and some of the
    tales fall far short of the truth. There never was a real blow struck during
    the whole time that madman was away. He travelled from place to place in
    his litter borne by eight men, and sent his soldiers ahead of him with sprays
    and buckets of water that they should lay the dust along the road on which
    he would travel. At Trevirorum on the banks of the Rhine, he caused two hundred
    of his picked guard to dress up as barbarians and to make feint to attack
    the camp at midnight. This they did with necessary shoutings and clashings
    of steel against steel. Then did the greatest and best of C&aelig;sars sally
    forth in full battle array followed by a few of his most trusted men, and
    in the darkness there was heard more shouting and more clashings of steel
    until Caligula returned in triumph at sunrise to his camp. He had passed
    hempen ropes round the necks of the mock barbarians, and ever after had them
    dragged in the wake of his litter, even as if they were prisoners of war.
    No doubt he had paid them well for acting such a farce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But was the army blind to all this folly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar only kept some five hundred picked men round him
    in his camp. These he bribed into acquiescence of all his mad pranks. The
    rest of the legions were some distance away all the time. They believed all
    that they were told; mayhap they thought it wisest to believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that in Belgica, on the shores of the ocean&mdash;&rdquo; began
    Augustus Philario after a while.</p>
  <p>But he was not allowed to proceed. Shouts of derision broke in upon the
    tale, followed by expressions of rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the good of retailing further follies,&rdquo; said Caius
    Nepos at last; &ldquo;we all know that a madman, a vain, besotted fool wields
    now the sceptre of Julius C&aelig;sar and of great Augustus. The numbers
    of his misdeeds are like the grains of sand on the seashore, his orgies have
    shamed our generation, his debauches are a disgrace upon the fame of Rome.
    Patricians awake! The day hath come, the hour is close at hand. To-morrow,
    mayhap, at the public games ... a tumult amongst the people ... it should
    be easy to rouse that ... then a well-edged dagger ... and the Empire is
    rid of the most hideous and loathsome tyrant that ever brutalised a nation
    and shamed an empire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even as he spoke, and despite the deaf-mute slaves and the foreign girls,
    he lowered his voice until it sank to the merest whisper. Reclining upon
    the couches with elbows buried in silken cushions the others all stretched
    forward now, until two score of heads met in one continued circle, forehead
    to forehead and ear to ear, whilst in the midst of them an oil lamp flickered
    low and lit up at fitful intervals the sober, callous faces with the hard
    mouths and cruel, steely eyes.</p>
  <p>The slaves&mdash;those who had lost ears and tongue and those who spoke
    no language save their own foreign one&mdash;had retreated to the far corners
    of the room, up against the columns of Phrygian marble or the hangings of
    Tyrian tapestries; their great uncomprehending eyes were fixed on that compact
    group at the head of the table, where round the bowls of roses and of lilies
    and the goblets of wine, the future of the Empire of Rome was even now being
    discussed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The tumult can be easily provoked,&rdquo; said one of the guests
    presently&mdash;a young man whose black hair and dark eyes bespoke his Oriental
    blood. &ldquo;The C&aelig;sar is certain to provoke it himself by some insane
    act of tyrannical folly. Ye must all remember how, two years ago, during
    the Megalesian games he ordered the women of his retinue to descend into
    the arena and to engage the gladiators in combat. At this outrage the discontent
    among the people nearly broke out into open revolt. It was thou, Caius Nepos,
    who checked the tumult then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The hour was not ripe,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;and we were
    not allied. It will be different to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How will it be to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When the tumult is at its highest, he who has the surest hand shall
    strike the C&aelig;sar down. I, in the meanwhile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then thou, Caius Nepos, art not certain of the sureness of thy hand?&rdquo;  interposed
    Hortensius Martius who hitherto had taken no active part in the discussion.</p>
  <p>He lay on a couch at some distance from his host and had declined every
    morsel offered to him by the waiting-maids; but he had drunk over freely,
    and his good-looking young face looked flushed and dark beneath its wealth
    of curls. Unlike his usual self he was ill-humoured and almost morose to-night,
    and there was a dark, glowering look in his eyes as from time to time he
    cast furtive glances towards the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, good Hortensius,&rdquo; said the host loftily, &ldquo;mine will
    be the greater part. The praetorian guard know and trust me. It will be my
    duty when the C&aelig;sar is attacked to keep them from rushing to his aid.
    The army is apt to forget a tyrant&rsquo;s crime, and to think of him only
    as a leader to be obeyed. But when the guard hear my voice, they will understand
    and will be true to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis I will strike,&rdquo; now broke in young Escanes, with
    all the enthusiasm of his years. The ardour of leadership glowed upon his
    face, and he seemed to challenge this small assembly to dispute his right
    to the foremost place in the great event of the morrow.</p>
  <p>But his challenge was not taken up; no one else seemed eager to dispute
    his wish. Somewhat sobered, he resumed more calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar hath much affection for me. I oft sat beside him
    in the Circus or at the games last year. The Augustas too like to have me
    beside them, to talk pleasing gossip in their ears. &rsquo;Twill be easiest
    for me, at a signal given, to strike with my dagger in the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    throat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thine shall be that glory, O Escanes, since thou dost will it so,&rdquo;  said
    Caius Nepos, not without a touch of irony. &ldquo;Directly the deed is done,
    the praetorian guard shall raise the cry: &lsquo;The C&aelig;sar is dead!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it should at once be followed by another,&rdquo; said Marcus
    Ancyrus, the elder, &ldquo;by &lsquo;Hail to thee, O mighty C&aelig;sar!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis thou shouldst raise that cry, O Caius Nepos,&rdquo; said
    Hortensius with a sarcastic curl of his lip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! as to that&mdash;&rdquo; began the other with some hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! as to that,&rdquo; said Escanes hotly, &ldquo;if I slay the
    tyrant to-morrow with mine own hand, then must I know at least for whom I
    do the deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence after that. Everyone seemed absorbed in his own thoughts.
    Dreamy eyes gazed abstractedly in crystal goblets, as if vainly trying to
    trace in its crimson depths the outline of an imperial sceptre. At last Caius
    Nepos spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us be rid of the tyrant first. The army then will soon elect
    its new chief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And is it on the support of the army, O praefect! that thou dost
    base thine own hopes of supreme power?&rdquo; asked Hortensius, whose ill-humour
    seemed to grow on him more and more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; retorted Caius Nepos, &ldquo;I did not know that by so
    doing I was dashing thine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; admonished Marcus Ancyrus, the elder. &ldquo;Are
    we children or slaves that we should wrangle thus? Have we met here in order
    to rid the Empire of an abominable and bloodthirsty tyrant, or are we mere
    vulgar conspirators pursuing our own ends? There was no thought in our host&rsquo;s
    mind of supreme power, O Hortensius! nor in thine, I&rsquo;ll vow. As for
    me, I care nought for the imperium,&rdquo; he added na&iuml;vely,  &ldquo;it
    is difficult to content everyone, and a permanent consulship under our chosen
    C&aelig;sar were more to my liking. Bring forth thy tablets, O Caius Nepos,
    and we&rsquo;ll put the matter to the vote. There are not many of the House
    of C&aelig;sar fit to succeed the present madman, and our choice there will
    be limited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is but Claudius, the brother of Germanicus,&rdquo; interposed
    the host curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Germanicus&rsquo; brother to succeed Germanicus&rsquo; son,&rdquo; said
    another with a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And he is as crazy as his nephew,&rdquo; added Caius Nepos.</p>
  <p>He had not assembled his friends here to-night, he had not feasted them
    and loaded them with gifts with a view to passing the imperium merely from
    one head to another. He was fairly sure of the support of the praetorian
    guard, whose praefect he was, and had counted on the adherence of these malcontents,
    who he hoped would look to him for future favours whilst raising him to supreme
    dignity.</p>
  <p>He liked not this talk of the family of C&aelig;sar which took the attention
    of his closest adherents away from his own claim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The entire House of C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is rotten
    to the core. There is not one member of it fit to rule.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But of a truth,&rdquo; said prudent Ancyrus, &ldquo;they have the
    foremost claim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then if that be the case,&rdquo; broke in young Hortensius Martius
    suddenly,  &ldquo;let us turn to the one member of the House of C&aelig;sar
    who is noble and pure, exalted above all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is none such,&rdquo; said Caius Nepos hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! there is one,&rdquo; retorted the younger man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His name?&rdquo; came loudly from every side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I spoke of a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A woman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And shouts of derisive laughter broke from every lip. Only Marcus Ancyrus
    remained grave and thoughtful, and now he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost perchance speak of Dea Flavia Augusta?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even of her,&rdquo; replied Hortensius.</p>
  <p>Involuntarily at the name, the voice of the older man had assumed a respectful
    tone, and all around the vulgar sneers and bitter mockery had died away as
    if by magic contact with something hallowed and pure.</p>
  <p>Even Caius Nepos thought it wise to subdue his tone of contempt, and merely
    said curtly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A goddess of a truth, but a woman cannot lead an army or rule an
    empire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined Hortensius Martius, &ldquo;but a wise and virtuous
    woman can rule wisely and virtuously over the man whom she will choose for
    mate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence for a moment or two, whilst young Hortensius&rsquo; glowing
    eyes swept questioningly over the assembly. Everyone there knew of his passion
    for the Augusta, a passion, in truth, shared by many of those who had the
    privilege of knowing her intimately, and strangely enough though the proposal
    had so much daring in it, it met with but little opposition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldst thou then suggest, O Hortensius Martius,&rdquo; quoth Marcus
    Ancyrus, the elder, after a slight pause, &ldquo;that the Augusta&rsquo;s
    husband be made Emperor of Rome?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; retorted the other simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not a bad notion,&rdquo; mused young Escanes, who thought himself
    high in the favour of Dea Flavia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An admirable one,&rdquo; assented Ancyrus, &ldquo;for we must remember
    that Dea Flavia Augusta is of the true blood of the C&aelig;sars&mdash;the
    blood of the great Augustus&mdash;and there is none better. Since she, as
    a woman, cannot rule men or lead an army, what more fitting than that her
    lord, whoever he might be, should receive the imperium through her hands?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He might prove to be a more miserable creature than the Caligula
    himself,&rdquo;  suggested Philario, who was too ill-favoured to have hopes
    of winning the proud and imperious beauty for himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! that were impossible,&rdquo; asserted Hortensius hotly; &ldquo;the
    man whom Dea Flavia will favour will be a brave man else he would not dare
    to woo her; he will be honourable and noble else he could never win her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Methinks that thou art right, O Hortensius,&rdquo; added Ancyrus,
    who had taken upon himself the r&ocirc;le of a wise and prudent counsellor, &ldquo;and
    moreover he will be rich by virtue of the wealth which the Augusta will have
    as her marriage portion; her money, merged with the State funds, would be
    of vast benefit to the land.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And on his death his son and hers&mdash;a direct descendant of great
    Augustus&mdash;would be the only fitting heir,&rdquo; concluded another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meseems,&rdquo; now said Ancyrus decisively, &ldquo;that we would
    solve a grave difficulty by accepting the suggestion made by Hortensius Martius.
    The imperium&mdash;as is only just&mdash;would remain in the family of the
    great Augustus. We should have a brave, noble and rich C&aelig;sar whose
    virtuous and beautiful wife would wield beneficial influence over him, and
    for the present we should all be working for unselfish ends; not one of us
    here present can say for a certainty whom the Augusta will choose for mate.
    Directly the tyrant is swept out of the way, we, who have brought about the
    great end, will ask her to make her choice. Thus our aims will have been
    pure and selfless; each one of us here will have risked all for the sake
    of an unknown. What say you friends? Shall we pledge our loyalty to the man
    whom not one of us here can name this day&mdash;a man mayhap still unknown
    to us: the future lord of Dea Flavia Augusta of the House of C&aelig;sar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The peroration seemed greatly to the liking of the assembled company: the
    thought that they would all be working with pure and selfless motives flattered
    these men&rsquo;s egregious vanity; vaguely every one of them hoped that
    all the others would believe in his unselfish aims, even whilst everyone
    meant to work solely for his own ends. Hortensius Martius&rsquo; proposal
    pleased because it opened out such magnificent possibilities: the imperium
    itself, which had seemed infinitely remote from so many, now appeared within
    reach of all.</p>
  <p>Anyone who was young, well-favoured, and of patrician birth might aspire
    to the hand of the Augusta, and not one of those who possessed at least two
    of those qualifications doubted his own ability to win.</p>
  <p>Raising himself to a more upright position, Marcus Ancyrus the elder, goblet
    in hand, looked round for approval on all the guests.</p>
  <p>The murmur of acquiescence was well-nigh general, and many there were who
    held their goblets to the waiting-maids in order to have them filled and
    then drained them to the last dregs. But there were a few dissentient voices,
    chiefly among the less-favoured who, like Philario, could hardly dare approach
    a beautiful woman with thoughts of wooing her.</p>
  <p>Caius Nepos had not taken up the pledge, nor had he taken any part in the
    discussion since Dea Flavia&rsquo;s name first passed the lips of young Hortensius.
    Indeed, as the latter seemed to lose his ill-humour and become flushed and
    excited with the approval of his friends, so did the host gradually become
    more and more morose and silent.</p>
  <p>Clearly the proposal to leave the matter of the choice of a C&aelig;sar
    in the hands of a woman was not to his liking. Though good-looking and still
    in the prime of life he had never found favour with women, and Dea Flavia
    had often shown open contempt for him, and for the selfish ambition which
    moved his every action, and which he was at no pains to conceal.</p>
  <p>It was easy to see, by the glowering look on his face, that the meeting
    this night had not turned out as he had wished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We cannot decide this matter otherwise than by vote,&rdquo; said
    one of the guests when the murmurs of approval and those of dissent had equally
    died down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art right, O friend,&rdquo; assented Ancyrus, &ldquo;and I pray
    thee, Caius Nepos, order thy slaves to bring us the tablets, and let each
    man record his vote according to his will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Caius Nepos could find no objection to this, even though the question of
    voting was in no way to his liking. He had a vague hope, mayhap, that by
    gaining time he might succeed in sowing seeds of discord amongst those who
    had been so ready to accede to the new proposal; any moment even now&mdash;a
    chance word spoken, a trifling incident, an incipient quarrel might sway
    these men and bring them back to their allegiance to himself. He had been
    so sure of their support; the banquet this night had been destined to set
    the seal to their fealty and to cement their friendship: it was more than
    exasperating that the suggestion of a young fool should have caused them
    to swerve from their promised adherence.</p>
  <p>For the moment however, he could not help but acquiesce outwardly in the
    wish of the majority. After an imperceptible moment of hesitation, he called
    to one of his deaf-mute slaves and made him understand by signs that he wanted
    forty wax tablets prepared and brought hither with forty stylets wherewith
    to write. Then he cheerily bade his guests once more to eat and drink and
    to make merry.</p>
  <p>And it was characteristic of these strange products of a decadent age, that
    in the midst of grave discussions wherein their own lives and their future
    aggrandisement were at stake, these men were quite ready to respond to their
    host&rsquo;s invitation and momentarily to forget their own ambitious schemes
    in the enjoyment of epicurean delights.</p>
  <p>Wine and fruit were once more handed round; both were excellent, and during
    a brief interval mighty issues were set aside and conversation became more
    general and more free. The pageant of games and combats which was to last
    for over thirty days in honour of the deification of Caligula and his safe
    return from Germany became the subject of eager talk. There had been rumours
    of a remarkable load of African lions arrived in the Tiber a day or two ago,
    which were to make a gorgeous spectacle in the arena pitted against some
    tigers from Numidia. There was also talk of a novelty in the shape of crocodiles
    who were said to fight with great cunning and power against a pack of hyenas
    from the desert.</p>
  <p>Then there would be the chariot races and gladiatorial combats; heavy betting
    on these events had been in progress for some time all over the city among
    the wealthy patricians as well as among the impoverished plebs; the respective
    merits of the blues, the greens, the reds, and the yellows were the subject
    of heated discussions, and Caius Nepos was glad to note that more than a
    suspicion of antagonism was aroused between his guests in the defence of
    their respective choice.</p>
  <p>He only took a very cursory part in the discussion, putting in a word here
    and there where contradiction or approval might further inflame overheated
    tempers.</p>
  <p>And he ordered his slaves to pour the wine with a free hand, and himself
    was ready to pledge every one of his guests over and over again for as long
    as they were ready to drink.</p>
  <p>Inside the room the heat had become excessive, the evening air only entered
    through narrow windows, and the gentle breeze did no more than fan the flames
    of the oil lamps or make the petals of dying roses tremble and fall. The
    noise grew louder and louder as the fumes of heady wines obscured the brains
    of these makers of future empires. Slaves were called for loudly to undo
    the tunics and to help cast off all but the necessary garments.</p>
  <p>Every face round the table now was flushed and moist; every forehead streaming
    with perspiration. Escanes, goblet in hand, was singing a ribald song, the
    chorus of which was taken up by the group of young men nearest to him. The
    older ones were making insane bets and driving preposterous bargains over
    horses and slaves.</p>
  <p>By the time that the slaves had returned with the tablets the praetorian
    praefect had cause to be satisfied with the temper of his guests. Coarse
    jests and drunken oaths were heard more often than whispered serious talk,
    the names of popular gladiators seemed of more account than those of future
    C&aelig;sars. Arguments were loud and violent; every mouth slobbered, every
    lip trembled and every eye glowed with unnatural brightness: curls were dishevelled
    and laurel crowns awry; the silken draperies on the couches had become tattered
    rags and the cushions were scattered all about the floor; debris of crystal
    vases littered the table and bunches of dying flowers were tossed about by
    unsteady hands.</p>
  <p>Given a little more time, a few more draughts of Sicilian wine, and all
    thoughts of voting for a future C&aelig;sar would be beyond the mental power
    of these degenerates, and drunken quarrels would turn to violent enmity.
    This Caius Nepos had in mind when he took the tablets from the slaves, and
    threw them down with affected carelessness on the table before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We cannot vote,&rdquo; he said loudly, &ldquo;whilst Taurus Antinor
    is not here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His words were even more potent than he had hoped; all that he had wanted
    was further delay, and most of his guests nodded approval with drunken solemnity
    and then called for more wine. But Hortensius Martius who, though he had
    drunk as heavily as the others, had not joined in the ribald songs or the
    senseless orgy of shouts and of laughter, now jumped up with a violent oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What hath Taurus Antinor to do with us?&rdquo; he shouted at the
    top of his voice, &ldquo;or we with Taurus Antinor? Ye do not intend, I trust,
    to raise a freedman to the imperium and place the sceptre of C&aelig;sar
    in the hands of a descendant of slaves!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was trembling with such unbridled fury, his eyes glowed with the lust
    of such deadly hate that instinctively the ribald songs and immoderate laughter
    were hushed, and eyes, veiled with the film of intoxication were turned wonderingly
    upon him.</p>
  <p>But Caius Nepos was smiling blandly: the ire of Hortensius pleased him even
    though he did not understand its cause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, as to that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are we not all descended
    from slaves? Taurus Antinor hath the ear of the plebs. Doth suggest, O Hortensius,
    that he also hath the ear of Dea Flavia Augusta?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had shot this arrow into the air, little guessing how hard and truly
    it would hit.</p>
  <p>Hortensius was making vigorous efforts to curb his temper, biting his lips
    until tiny drops of blood slowly trickled down his chin. But he felt that
    the mocking eyes of his host were upon him, and had just a sufficiency of
    reason left in him to see through the machinations of Caius Nepos. He would
    not hold himself up to ridicule now before those who should prove his strong
    supporters in the future; his proposal had not yet been put to the vote,
    and he did not mean to alienate his adherents by an insane show of maniacal
    rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of that,&rdquo; he said in response to his host&rsquo;s taunt, and
    in a voice quivering with the mighty effort of control, &ldquo;of that there
    is but little fear. The Augusta is too proud to look with favour on a stranger;
    as for me, I would sooner ask Escanes to plunge his dagger in my throat than
    I would serve the Empire under the C&aelig;sarship of Taurus Antinor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou canst record thy vote as thou thinkest best,&rdquo; said Caius
    Nepos with calm urbanity. And those who were sufficiently sober nodded approval
    with solemn gravity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; here interposed Marcus Ancyrus with stern reproof, &ldquo;before
    we begin to vote let us be agreed on one point: let us be prepared to swear
    by the gods that we will adhere truly and loyally to the choice of the majority&mdash;and
    if, as meseems is likely, we agree that the unknown future husband of Dea
    Flavia Augusta become the ruler of us all, then must we swear to proclaim
    him the C&aelig;sar with one accord, else doth our voting become a mere farce.
    Friends, before ye vote, are you ready to take this oath?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! aye!&rdquo; came from almost every mouth round the table. But
    they nodded like automatons, with heavy heads that rolled on bowed shoulders
    and blurred eyes half-hidden behind closing lids.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not swear allegiance to Taurus Antinor,&rdquo; persisted
    Hortensius obstinately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost think it likely that the Augusta favours him?&rdquo; asked the
    host ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what hast thou to fear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; interposed young Escanes in a thick voice broken
    by hiccoughs,  &ldquo;I am ready to swear as Marcus Ancyrus directs. If we
    are not satisfied with the new C&aelig;sar, whoever he may be, my dagger
    will not rust in the meanwhile; I can easily whet it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even as these last cynical words left the young man&rsquo;s lips there came
    from outside the noise of much shouting and shuffling of naked feet, and
    anon the sound of a voice, loud and harsh, asking for leave to speak with
    the praetorian praefect. Caius Nepos paused, tablets in hand. Strangely enough
    the voice, though well-known, seemed to have a sobering effect on all these
    ebullient tempers. Marcus Ancyrus, who was the most calm among them all,
    threw a quick glance of inquiry on his host, one or two furtive glances were
    exchanged, a look that was half-ashamed crept into some of the faces, and
    there were hurried, whispered calls to the slaves to bring the bags of ice.</p>
  <p>Quickly the tunics were re-adjusted and an attempt made at re-establishing
    some semblance of decorum round the table. Caius Nepos was giving hastily
    whispered directions to the waiting-maids.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pull that coverlet straight, quick!&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and
    those cushions, pick them off the ground ... that broken vase, set it aside....
    There! try and hide that wine stain with a fresh cloth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And all the while rapid, eager questions flew from mouth to mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wilt tell him at once, O Caius Nepos?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or wilt ply him with wine first?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twere safer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! nay!&rdquo; said Escanes, whose wrists and ankles were being
    bathed,  &ldquo;that would take too long. Taurus Antinor hath a strong head,
    and I, for one, could not keep sober another half-hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost know if he is at one with us?&rdquo; was the query that came
    from every side.</p>
  <p>Hortensius Martius alone had remained silent. He did not call either for
    water or for ice. It was his hatred that had sobered him, making the lines
    of his face set and hard, causing the flush to die from his cheeks and leaving
    them ashy pale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost know if he is at one with us?&rdquo; reiterated Augustus Philario
    impatiently.</p>
  <p>He had ordered a slave to hold lumps of ice to his forehead, whilst Philippus
    Decius&mdash;lying next to him&mdash;was having perfume rubbed into the back
    of his neck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must look stern and deliberate,&rdquo; said Ancyrus. &ldquo;Dost
    know, O Caius Nepos, if he is at one with us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must enlist him,&rdquo; rejoined the latter hurriedly; &ldquo;he
    holds the plebs, and without his help our position might become difficult.
    A word from him to the crowd and the new C&aelig;sar is assured of peace
    within the city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then do thou tell him what has been decided,&rdquo; said one of the
    others who was busy smoothing his tangled hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; whispered cautious Ancyrus, the elder, &ldquo;have
    a care ... thou, Caius Nepos, must probe him ere thou speakest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell him naught of Escanes&rsquo; dagger,&rdquo; added another hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak of abdication,&rdquo; said the older man, &ldquo;of anything
    that comes in thy mind. Some men there are who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But he had no time to explain his meaning further, for the next moment Taurus
    Antinor stepped into the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.&rdquo;&mdash;Proverbs
    26. 13.</p>
  <p>He had exchanged his embroidered tunic for a gorgeous synthesis of crimson
    embroidered with gold, which set off to perfection the somewhat barbaric
    splendour of his personality, and as he stood there massive and erect, beneath
    the gilded beams of Caius Nepos&rsquo; dining-hall, with the slaves at his
    feet undoing the strings of his shoes, he looked every inch the ruler for
    whom all these men here were blindly and senselessly seeking.</p>
  <p>His deep-set eyes beneath that stern frown had swept quickly over the assembly
    as he entered, and though now comparative order had been restored and a semblance
    of calm reigned around the table, Taurus Antinor did not fail to note the
    flushed faces and glowing eyes, the broken goblets, and stained and tattered
    cloths which gave ugly evidence of the riotous orgy that had gone before.</p>
  <p>But though forty pairs of eyes were fixed upon his face, none could boast
    that they had perceived any change in its somewhat severe impassiveness as
    he now advanced towards his host.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Greeting to thee, O Caius Nepos!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I crave thy
    pardon for my late coming, but I had other duties to which to attend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Duties?&rdquo; said Caius Nepos lightly; &ldquo;nay, Taurus Antinor,
    there are just now duties so high and sacred that others must of necessity
    stand aside for these! But of this more anon. Wilt rest now and partake of
    wine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank thee, good Caius,&rdquo; replied the praefect, &ldquo;but
    I have supped, and only came at thy bidding, because thou didst say that
    affairs of State would claim our attention this night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To all those present he gave courteous if not very hearty greeting. Then
    did his glance encounter that of Hortensius Martius who alone had said no
    word or made a movement to welcome him.</p>
  <p>There was a vacant place beside young Hortensius, and Taurus Antinor took
    it, but he did not lie along the cushions as the others did but half sat,
    half leaned on the couch, and turning to the young man said simply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I give thee greeting, O Hortensius! I had no thought of meeting thee
    here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told thee yesterday that I would be present,&rdquo; said the other
    curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember now and am proud and honoured to sit by thy side; wilt
    pledge me in a goblet of wine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had forced his rough voice to tones of gentleness. Hortensius Martius
    raised his glowering eyes with some curiosity on his face.</p>
  <p>But a day and a night had elapsed since his life had lain wholly at the
    mercy of this powerful giant whom he had insulted, and who had been on the
    point of punishing that insult with death.</p>
  <p>Young Hortensius, held aloft in the mighty grip of the praefect twenty feet
    above the flagstones of the Forum, seeing a hideous death waiting for him
    below, did not even now realise how it came to pass that&mdash;when he recovered
    from the swoon into which horror and fear had thrown him&mdash;he found himself
    being tended by an old woman, and anon delivered safe and sound into the
    keeping of his slaves; he had entered his litter and been borne to his home
    still marvelling, but of the praefect of Rome he had not since then seen
    a trace.</p>
  <p>He had questioned his slaves who swore that from the arcades of the tabernae,
    where they had been waiting, they had seen nothing of what went on around
    the rostra. Hortensius knew that they lied, they must have seen something
    of the quarrel; they must have seen him being carried like a recalcitrant
    child up to the top of the highest rostrum, and threatened with awful punishment
    by the very man whom he had affected to despise. They must also have seen
    the praefect relenting, carrying him down again, content apparently with
    the fright which he had given him.</p>
  <p>His slaves must have been witnesses to his humiliation, and now were afraid
    to tell him what they had seen; and for the first time in his life Hortensius
    Martius felt a wave of cruelty pass over him, in an insensate desire to make
    the slaves speak under pressure of torture.</p>
  <p>At the time he was ashamed to seem too eager and had forborne to question
    further. But he allowed his humiliation to breed the quick-growing weed of
    hate. When first the name of Taurus Antinor was mentioned he realised how
    that weed had grown apace, and now that he sat beside him, and felt the inquisitive
    eyes of his host fixed with ill-concealed mockery upon him, he knew in his
    innermost heart that after this day there would no longer be room in the
    city of Rome for himself as well as for this man who had vanquished and humiliated
    him.</p>
  <p>For the moment, however, he did not care to proclaim before all these men
    the hatred which he felt for Taurus Antinor. Thoughts of supreme grandeur
    were coursing through his brain. He knew that no one stood so high in Dea
    Flavia&rsquo;s graces as he himself had done this year past, and that no
    one was so like to win her for wife, since she had in her own proud and aloof
    way already accepted his respectful wooing.</p>
  <p>Therefore, putting a rein upon his jealousy and upon his unruly tongue,
    he took up a goblet and responded to the pledge of the man whom he hated.
    But whilst Antinor drained the crystal cup to the dregs young Hortensius
    scarcely wetted his lips, and pretending to drink deeply, he kept his eyes
    fixed upon the praefect of Rome.</p>
  <p>It seemed to him as if he had never really seen him before, so sharp are
    the eyes of hate that they see much that is usually hidden to those of indifference.
    Young Hortensius, over the edge of his goblet, embraced with a steady glance
    the whole person of his enemy&mdash;the massive frame, the strong limbs,
    the hands and feet slender and strong. He looked straight into those deep-set
    eyes over which a perpetual frown always cast a shadow, and saw that they
    were of an intense shade of blue and with a strange look in them of kindliness
    and of peace, which belied the stern fierceness of the face and the wilful
    obstinacy of the massive jaw.</p>
  <p>But now Caius Nepos began to speak. Taking the advice of Marcus Ancyrus
    the elder, he spoke vaguely, trying to probe the thoughts that lay hidden
    behind the Anglicanus&rsquo; furrowed brow. He had received advice, he said
    that the C&aelig;sar was tired of government and wished to spend some quiet
    days in the Palace of Tiberius, on the island of Capraea; all this cleverly
    interwoven with sighs of hope as to what a happier future might bring if
    the Empire were rid&mdash;quite peaceably, of course&mdash;of the tyranny
    of a semi-brutish despot.</p>
  <p>Then, as Taurus Antinor made no comment on his peroration, he recalled in
    impassioned language all that Rome had witnessed in the past three years
    of depravity, of turpitude, of senseless and maniacal orgies and of bestial
    cruelty, all perpetrated by the one man to whom blind Fate had given supreme
    power.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And to whom, alas!&rdquo; said Taurus Antinor in calm response to
    the glowing speech, &ldquo;we have all of us here sworn loyalty and obedience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence after this. Despite the lingering fumes of wine that obscured
    the brain, everyone felt that with these few words the praefect of Rome had
    already given an answer, and that nothing that could be said after this would
    have the power of making him alter his decision. But Marcus Ancyrus, conscious
    of his own powers of diplomacy, took up the thread of his host&rsquo;s peroration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! but we should be obeying him,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;if
    we accept his abdication.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no disloyalty,&rdquo; asserted Escanes, &ldquo;in rejoicing
    at such an issue, if the C&aelig;sar himself doth will it so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; admitted the praefect; &ldquo;but there would be grave
    difficulty in choosing a successor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To this,&rdquo; said the host, &ldquo;we have given grave consideration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And have come to a decision which we all think would best serve the
    welfare of the State.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I hear this decision?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It means just this, O praefect! that since the sceptre of C&aelig;sar
    must, if possible, remain in the House of C&aelig;sar, and since no man of
    that House is worthy to wield it, we would ask the Augusta Dea Flavia to
    take to herself a lord and husband, on whom, by virtue of his marriage, the
    imperium would rest for his life, and after his death fall on the direct
    descendant of great Augustus himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor had not made a sign whilst Caius Nepos thus briefly put before
    him the main outline of the daring project, and Hortensius Martius, who was
    watching him closely, could not detect the slightest change in the earnest
    face even when Dea Flavia&rsquo;s name was spoken. Now, when Nepos paused
    as if waiting for comment, Antinor said gravely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye must pardon me, but I am a stranger to the social life in Rome.
    Will you tell me who this man is whom the Augusta will so highly favour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, as to that,&rdquo; said Caius Nepos, &ldquo;we none of us know
    it as yet! Dea Flavia has smiled on many, but up to now hath made no choice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then &rsquo;tis to an unknown man ye would all pledge your loyalty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unknown, yet vaguely guessed at, O praefect,&rdquo; here broke in
    Escanes, with his usual breezy cheerfulness; &ldquo;we all feel that Dea
    Flavia&rsquo;s choice can but fall on an honourable man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou speakest truly,&rdquo; rejoined Taurus Antinor earnestly; &ldquo;but
    I fear me that for the present your schemes are too vague. The Augusta hath
    made no choice of a husband as yet, and the C&aelig;sar is still your chosen
    lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A brutish madman, who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You chose him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since then he hath become a besotted despot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still your Emperor&mdash;to whom you owe your dignities, your power,
    your rank&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou dost defend him warmly, O praefect of Rome,&rdquo; suddenly
    interposed Hortensius Martius who had followed every phase of the discussion
    with heated brow and eyes alert and glowing. &ldquo;Thou art ready to continue
    this life of submission to a maniacal tyrant, to a semi-bestial mountebank&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The life which I lead is of mine own making,&rdquo; rejoined Taurus
    Antinor proudly; &ldquo;the life ye lead is the one ye have chosen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with significant glance his dark eyes took in every detail of the disordered
    room&mdash;the littered table, the luxurious couches, the numberless empty
    dishes and broken goblets as well as the flushed faces and the trembling
    hands, and involuntarily, perhaps, a look of harsh contempt spread over his
    face.</p>
  <p>Hortensius caught the look and winced under it; the words that had accompanied
    it had struck him as with a lash, and further whipped up his already violent
    rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he retorted with an evil sneer, &ldquo;to the C&aelig;sar
    thou wilt render homage even in his most degraded orgies, and wilt lick the
    dust from off his shoes when he hath kicked thee in the mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slowly Taurus Antinor turned to him, and Hortensius Martius appeared just
    then so like a naughty child, that the look of harshness died out of the
    praefect&rsquo;s eyes, and a smile almost of amusement, certainly of indulgence,
    lit up for a moment the habitual sternness of his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Loyalty to C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;doth not mean
    obsequiousness, as all Roman patricians should know, oh Hortensius!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! but meseems,&rdquo; rejoined the young man, whose voice had
    become harsher and more loud as that of Taurus Antinor became more subdued
    and low, &ldquo;meseems that at the cost of thy manhood thou at least art
    prepared to render unto C&aelig;sar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But even as these words escaped his lips the praefect, with a quick peremptory
    gesture, placed one slim, strong hand on Hortensius&rsquo; wrist.</p>
  <p>It seemed as if in a moment&mdash;and because of those words&mdash;a strange
    power had gone forth from the soul within right down to the tips of the slender
    fingers that closed on those of the younger man with a grip of steel.</p>
  <p>He had raised himself wholly upright on the couch, his massive figure, in
    the gorgeous crimson tunic, standing out clear and trenchant against the
    shadowy whiteness of the marble walls behind him. His head, with the ruddy
    mass of hair on which the flickering lamps threw brilliant, golden lights,
    was thrown back, and the eyes, deep, intent, and glowing with unrevealed
    ardour, looked straight out before him into the shadows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Render unto C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;the things
    which are C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s, and unto God the things that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His voice was low and unmodulated, as of one who repeats something that
    he has heard before, whilst the eyes suddenly shone as if with a fleeting
    memory of an exquisite vision.</p>
  <p>The action, the words, were but momentary, but for that brief moment the
    angry retort was checked on Hortensius&rsquo; lips, even as were the sneers
    and the bibulous scowls on the faces of those around. Taurus Antinor, towering
    above them all, and imbued with a strange dignity, seemed to be gazing into
    a space beyond the walls of the gorgeous dining-hall; into a space hidden
    from their understanding but peopled with the sweet memory of a sacred past.
    And even as he gazed a strange spell fell over these voluptuaries; a spell
    which they were unable to withstand. Whilst it lasted every ribald word was
    stilled and every drunken oath lulled to silence. The very air seemed hushed
    and only from a bunch of dying roses the withered petals were heard to fall
    one by one.</p>
  <p>Then the grasp on Hortensius&rsquo; wrist relaxed, the dark head was lowered,
    the falling lids once more hid the mysterious radiance of the eyes. The spell
    was broken as Taurus Antinor resumed quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;hath not yet abdicated; he
    is still our chosen ruler and Emperor. To speak of his successor now savours
    of treachery and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what thou sayest stinks of treachery,&rdquo; broke in Hortensius
    Martius with redoubled wrath, and shaking himself free from the brief spell
    of superstitious awe which Antinor&rsquo;s words and Antinor&rsquo;s grip
    on his arm had momentarily cast over him. &ldquo;Hast come here, O praefect,
    but to spy on us, to probe our souls and use them for thine own selfish ends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, Hortensius!&rdquo; admonished Ancyrus, the elder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I&rsquo;ll not be silent!&rdquo; retorted the young man, who
    seemed at last to have lost all control over his jealous passion. His eyes,
    in which gleamed the fire of intense hate, swept from the face of his enemy
    to that of his friends whom they challenged. His voice had become raucous
    and hoarse and his tongue refused him service, making his words sound inarticulate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do ye not see,&rdquo; he shouted, turning his flushed face toward
    the others,  &ldquo;do you not see how you are being fooled? The praefect
    stands high in the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s favour, he has the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    ear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; broke in in peremptory accents the voice of Caius
    Nepos, the host.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried some of the younger men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! No! I&rsquo;ll shout! I&rsquo;ll shout!&rdquo; persisted Hortensius
    with the crazy obstinacy of one whose mind is obscured with liquor and with
    passion, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shout until you understand. Fools, I tell ye!
    Fools are ye all! You tell this man of your schemes, of your plans! He listens
    blandly to you!... You fools! you fools! Not to have suspected ere this that
    his so-called loyalty to C&aelig;sar masks his treachery to us!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was kneeling now upon his couch, and with clenched hands was pounding
    against the cushions like an angry child. The tumult became general; everyone
    was shouting. Those who were nearest to this raving young maniac were trying
    to seize him, but he waved his arms about like the wings of a night bird,
    and anon he seized a goblet of heavy solid metal and struck out with it to
    the right and left of him, so that none dared come nigh.</p>
  <p>But the praefect stood quietly beside him, with arms held very tightly across
    his mighty chest, his dark eyes fixed upon the raving figure on the couch.
    No one had ventured to approach him, for the feeling of superstitious awe
    which he had aroused in them a while ago had not wholly died down, and now
    there was such a look of contempt and of wrath in his face that instinctively
    the most sober drew away from him, and those whose minds were obscured with
    wine looked upon him in ever growing terror.</p>
  <p>Suddenly Hortensius, brandishing the heavy goblet, raised it high above
    his head, and with a drunken and desperate gesture he flung it in the direction
    of the praefect, but his hand had trembled and his arm was unsteady. The
    goblet missed the head of Taurus Antinor and fell crashing along the marble-topped
    table, bringing a quantity of crystal down with it in its fall.</p>
  <p>A few drops of the wine from the goblet had fallen on Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s
    tunic, and from the parched throat of young Hortensius there rose a hoarse
    and immoderate laugh and a string of violent oaths. But even before these
    had fully escaped his lips he saw the praefect&rsquo;s dark face quite close
    to his own, and felt a grip as of a double vice of steel fastening on both
    his shoulders.</p>
  <p>He knew the grip and had felt it before; no claw of desert beast was firmer
    or more unrelenting. Young Hortensius felt his whole body give way, his very
    bones crack beneath that mighty grip. His head, overheated with wine, fell
    back against the cushions of his couch, and he felt as if the last breath
    in him was leaving his enfeebled body.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art a fool indeed, Hortensius,&rdquo; murmured a harsh voice
    close to his ear; &ldquo;a fool to provoke a man beyond the power of his
    control.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as at a word from the host, the other men&mdash;those who were steady
    on their feet&mdash;tried to interpose, Taurus Antinor turned his face to
    them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; he said quite calmly, &ldquo;for this man. He
    shall come to no harm. Twice hath he insulted me and twice have I held his
    life in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as Hortensius uttered an involuntary cry of rage or of pain, Taurus
    Antinor spoke once more to him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy life is in my hands yet will I not kill thee, even though I could
    do it with just the tightening of my fingers round thy throat. But provoke
    me not a third time, O Hortensius, for I have in my possession a heavy-thonged
    whip, and this would I use on thee even as I order it to be used on the miscreant
    thieves that are brought to my tribunal. So cross not my path again, dost
    understand? I am but a man and have not an inexhaustible stock of patience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whilst he spoke he still held young Hortensius down pinioned amongst the
    cushions. No one interfered, for it had dawned on every blurred mind there
    that here lay a deeper cause for quarrel than mere political conflict. Hortensius,
    though vanquished now, had been like a madman; his unprovoked insults had
    come from a heart overburdened with jealousy and with hate. Now when the
    praefect relaxed his grip upon him, he lay for a while quite still, and anon
    Caius Nepos beckoned to his slaves, and they it was who ministered to him,
    bathing his forehead with water and holding lumps of ice to the palms of
    his hands.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor had straightened out his tall figure. For a moment he looked
    down with bitter scorn on the prostrate figure of his vanquished foe. The
    awed silence which his strange words of a while ago had imposed upon the
    others, still hung upon them all. They stood about in groups, whispering
    below their breath, and the slaves were huddled up one against the other
    in the distant corners of the room. An air of mystery still hung over the
    magnificent triclinium, its convivial board, its abandoned couches, over
    the vases of murra and crystal and the fast dying roses. It seemed as if
    some personality&mdash;great, majestic, divine&mdash;had passed through the
    marble hall and that the sound of sacred feet still echoed softly along its
    walls.</p>
  <p>It almost seemed as if there clung a radiance in that shadowy corner where
    the eyes of an enthusiast had sought and found the memory of the Divine Teacher;
    and that in the fume-laden air there lingered the odour of the sacrifice
    offered by a rough, untutored heart to the Man Who had spoken unforgettable
    words seven years ago in Galilee.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;That the world through Him might be saved.&rdquo;&mdash;St. John
    3. 17.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor had bidden farewell to his host, and to the other guests
    and then departed.</p>
  <p>Not another word had been spoken on the subject of the C&aelig;sar or of
    his probable successor. The conspirators, somewhat sobered, had allowed the
    praefect to go without attempting further effort to gain him to their cause.
    They had had their answer. Though many of them did not quite understand the
    full depth of its meaning, yet were they satisfied that it was final. They
    bade him farewell quietly and without enmity; somehow the thought of their
    murderous plan had momentarily fled from their mind, and the quarrel between
    Hortensius Martius and the praefect of Rome seemed to have been the most
    important event of the day.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor emerged alone from the peristyle of Caius Nepos&rsquo; house.
    An army of slaves belonging to the various guests were hanging about the
    vestibule, talking and laughing amongst themselves and feasting on the debris
    from the patricians&rsquo;  table, brought out to them by servitors from
    within; some forty litters encumbered the floor, but Antinor, paying no heed
    to these, passed through the crowd of jabbering men and women and made his
    way across to the steps which led upwards to the street.</p>
  <p>The day was done, had been done long ago; already the canopy of the stars
    was stretched over the sleeping city, and far away to the east, beyond the
    gilded roof of Augustus&rsquo; palace, the waning moon, radiant and serene,
    outlined the carvings on every temple with a thin band of gold and put patches
    of luminous sapphires and emeralds on the bronze figures that crowned the
    Capitol.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor paused awhile, enjoying the restfulness of the night; from
    his broad chest came a long-drawn breath of voluptuous delight at the exquisite
    sweetness of the air. How far away now seemed that long, luxurious room,
    with its stained cloths and crumpled cushions, with the low tables groaning
    under the debris of past repasts and the rows of couches luring to sensuous
    repose. For the moment even the wranglings of Caius Nepos&rsquo; guests seemed
    remote, their selfish aims and their lying tongues. Here, beneath the stars,
    there was stillness and peace.</p>
  <p>A gentle breeze from over the distant hills blew on the dreamer&rsquo;s
    forehead and eased the wild throbbings of his temples; from somewhere near
    tiny petals of heliotrope, chased by the breeze, brought sweet-scented powder
    to his nostrils.</p>
  <p>He looked around him, gazing with wondering eyes on the mighty city sleeping
    upon her seven hills, on the gorgeous palaces of Tiberius and Caligula and
    the squalid huts far away on the Aventine Hill, on the mighty temples with
    their roofs of gold and the yawning arena down below, desolate and silent
    now, but where on the morrow men and beasts would tear one another to pieces
    to make holiday for the masters of the world.</p>
  <p>And even as his restless eyes swept over the surrounding landscape, they
    turned to where, in the shadow of the stately palaces of Tiberius and of
    Augustus, lay the house of Dea Flavia. Its gilded portals threw back with
    brilliant intensity the weird and elusive light of the waning moon, and high
    above, upon the balustrade of the roof, gigantic bronze groups of quaint
    and misshapen beasts looked ghoul-like against the canopy of the sky.</p>
  <p>All within the massive walls was dark and still; near to the vestibule a
    couple of ancient cypresses made a natural arch overhead, and in the tender
    branches of a group of acacias close by, the evening breeze sighed with gentle,
    melancholy murmurings amongst the leaves.</p>
  <p>Instinctively Taurus Antinor turned to walk a few steps toward the house,
    and soon reached a spot from whence his gaze could command the colonnaded
    vestibule, with its mosaic pavement sunk a few steps below the level of the
    street. Somewhere near him, though he could not see it, a bosquet of heliotrope
    and white lilies sent an intoxicating fragrance into the air.</p>
  <p>From far away&mdash;where the marshes stretched their limitless expanse
    toward the sea&mdash;came the melancholy cry of a bittern, calling to his
    absent mate.</p>
  <p>A vague longing surged in the strong man&rsquo;s heart; he stretched out
    his arms up to the dark, starlit canopy above, and a sigh, half impatient,
    wholly melancholy, escaped his half-closed lips.</p>
  <p>His eyes tried to pierce the marble walls behind which there bloomed&mdash;stately
    and proud&mdash;a beautiful white lily.</p>
  <p>Wholly against his will, the man&rsquo;s thoughts flew back to that midday
    hour in the Forum, when Dea Flavia had stood before him in all the exquisite
    glory of her youth and her loveliness, with that wilful curl round her chiselled
    lips and the delicate brows drawn together in a frown of child-like obstinacy.
    How beautiful she was and how strangely pathetic had been her isolation in
    the midst of so much grandeur.</p>
  <p>Even now he thought of her&mdash;asleep possibly somewhere in this gorgeous
    palace&mdash;all alone, despite the thousands of slaves around her; friendless,
    despite the might of the House of C&aelig;sar of which she was so proud.</p>
  <p>Through one of the tiny windows there peeped a flickering light. Taurus
    Antinor marvelled if that were her sleeping-room and, closing his eyes, pictured
    her there, resting on embroidered coverlets and cushions, her fair hair falling
    in waves around her face at rest; and he wondered whether in sleep a dewy
    tear had perchance put a priceless diamond on her golden lashes.</p>
  <p>Bitter thoughts of the men whom he had just quitted surged back in his heart;
    they wished to make of this young girl a tool for the fashioning of their
    own ambitious schemes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Augusta shall choose one of us for mate, and him we shall ask
    to hold the sceptre of C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One of them for mate! One of those sensuous self-seekers who would use her
    as a stepping-stone, and, having obtained supreme power through her dainty
    hands, would cast her aside as a useless tool and break her heart ere she
    realised even that she had one.</p>
  <p>And from the thoughts of the beautiful girl his mind flew back as if instinctively
    to that strange phase of his life&mdash;those unforgettable days in Jud&aelig;a
    which had seemed like unto the turning point of his whole existence. He recalled
    every moment of that memorable day when he had stood among a multitude on
    the barren wastes of Galilee and, wrapped in a dark cloak, had listened in
    solitary silence to words and teachings such as he had never dreamed of before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If only I could have understood Thee better then,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;if
    more of Thy precious words had fallen on mine ear.... I might have told her
    then something of what Thou didst say ... I could have found the words to
    make her understand.... But now I am ignorant and forlorn.... Oh, Man of
    Galilee! Thou didst die so soon ... and left so many of us groping in the
    darkness.... Thou Son of God, come back to me, if only in a dream ... show
    me the way, the truth, the light; show me the star which they say guided
    the shepherds to Thy cradle ... give me Thy cross, and let me walk once more
    on Golgotha to Thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And even as these words of passionate longing escaped half audibly from
    his lips his eyes wandered round the seven hills of Rome, and suddenly the
    highest peak beyond the Forum appeared to him transfigured in the night.
    Memory with a swift hand drew aside the veil of the present and in a vision
    showed him a picture of the past. The marble temples of pagan gods disappeared,
    the hill became bleak and precipitous and dark; great stillness reigned around,
    save where from afar there came at times the distant roll of thunder. The
    sky was overcast, great banks of cloud, the colour of lead, with blood-red
    lights within their massive bosoms, swept storm-tossed across the firmament.</p>
  <p>Then from the valley below there came, vaguely remote at first, then rising
    louder and louder, a sound as when a mighty torrent rushes onwards in its
    course; and as Taurus Antinor gazed now on that dream-hill, memory showed
    him, surging like a tempestuous sea, thousands upon thousands of human heads,
    all tending upwards to the summit of the hill.</p>
  <p>They came&mdash;the great multitude&mdash;they came, and still they came;
    and like gigantic breakers on a smooth shore, waves of human beings scattered
    themselves and dispersed upon that hill.</p>
  <p>And amongst them all, isolated, walking with bent back and thorn-crowned
    head well-nigh bowed to the dust, came a Man bearing a Cross.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor saw Him even now as he had seen Him then, with blood and
    sweat dripping from His brow, the pale, patient face serene and set, the
    eyes half closed in agony still glowing with unutterable love and with the
    perfect peace of complete sacrifice.</p>
  <p>And among the sea of faces that gazed on that solitary figure Taurus Antinor
    had recognised himself.</p>
  <p>He saw himself as he was then, a rough voluptuary, a thoughtless, sentient
    beast who up to that time had lived a life of emptiness and of mockery, eating
    and drinking and sleeping and waking again day after day, year after year.
    And he saw himself as he was on that day, he one of thousands and thousands
    of lookers-on gazing on the three hours&rsquo; agony of a just Man upon the
    Cross.</p>
  <p>He remembered every minute of those three hours, which the hill of imperial
    Rome now pictured back to him as in a dream. He had stood there a mere unit
    amongst the crowd, wrapped in a dark cloak, unrecognised and unknown, but
    with every nerve strained to catch the words that fell from those dying lips.
    He had heard the cry of bitterness: &ldquo;Lord! Lord! why hast Thou forsaken
    Me?&rdquo; and that of infinite love and of supreme pardon: &ldquo;Oh God,
    forgive them, for they know not what they do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And above and around the sky grew darker and the air more still, and round
    that dying figure alone there shone a radiance unseen by most; for had they
    seen it as Taurus Antinor saw it then, then surely would they have known,
    would they have understood.</p>
  <p>And at the foot of that Cross women and men stood weeping, and thoughtless
    soldiers hurled insults on their dying Lord. The lips that had only uttered
    words of perfect charity thirsted for a drop of water, and a sponge filled
    with gall was pressed mockingly to them.</p>
  <p>But the arms were still extended wider and wider, so it seemed, as if in
    their almighty love they would embrace all that surging humanity; all those
    that suffered, those that hoped as well as those that doubted, those who
    mocked Him and those who adored.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s very manhood had cried out to him then to fight the
    multitude single-handed, to shake the power of Rome and defy the will of
    the people, and to rush up to that one Cross, towering above the others,
    to pick out with firm fingers every cruel nail, to wrap the sacred body in
    soft, soothing cloths, and to kiss every wound until it closed in health.</p>
  <p>Even now, after all these years, the rough soldier&rsquo;s cheeks were burning
    with the shame of impotence.</p>
  <p>To look on that sacrifice and be unable to stop it. To look on such a death
    and to continue to live on, still blind, still ununderstanding, even though
    the Teacher Who had come to explain had sighed ere he died: &ldquo;It is
    finished!&rdquo; And yet Taurus Antinor, now looking back upon his own past
    self, knew that at the time, despite the horror, the pity and the sorrow,
    there was also in his heart a sense of happiness and even a vague feeling
    of triumph.</p>
  <p>What he saw there&mdash;with eyes that comprehended not&mdash;<i>that</i> he
    knew <i>was</i> because <i>it must be</i>; because it had been preordained
    and done by One Whose will was mightier than death. Though with aching heart
    and seared eyes he had watched every minute of the supreme agony, yet something
    within him, even then, had told him that every minute of that agony was a
    sacrifice that would not be in vain. And whilst in weakness he groaned with
    the pathos of it all, yet did his heart thrill with strange exultation, and
    from that Cross&mdash;even when all was silent&mdash;there rang in his ear
    the last words of perfect fulfilment of a perfect sacrifice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And even as the words rang once again in Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s ears, the
    awful darkness of that momentous hour fell upon the dream-hill far away.
    Golgotha, with its three towering crosses vanished from before the visionary&rsquo;s
    gaze. Once more there rose before him the marble temples of pagan Rome that
    crowned the Capitol&mdash;the gorgeous idols covered in gold, these gods
    of mockery before whom the mightiest Empire in the world was satisfied to
    bow the knee.</p>
  <p>And that same sweet, sad longing rose in the dreamer&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could I but have heard Thee speak more often!... Could I but have
    touched Thy hands, methinks that I would have understood.... But now ...
    now all is still dark before me ... and the way is so difficult.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And even as the sigh died upon his lips there came from behind him the sound
    of prolonged and hoarse laughter, followed by snatches of a drinking song
    and loud calls for slaves and litters.</p>
  <p>Caius Nepos&rsquo; guests were leaving the hospitable house at last. Drunk
    with wine, smothered in flowers, replete with every epicurean delight they
    were going home now, having, mayhap, forgotten that they had plotted to murder
    C&aelig;sar and to raise themselves to power at all costs, even if that cost
    was to be a sea of blood or the ruins of Rome.</p>
  <p>The song and laughter soon died away in the distance. Taurus Antinor had
    distinguished the voice of Hortensius Martius and that of Ancyrus, the elder.
    The sigh of sadness turned to one of bitterness, his arms dropped by his
    side, and a cry of harsh contempt escaped his parched? throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Man of Galilee,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;didst die for such
    as these?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
    give you rest.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Matthew 11. 28.</p>
  <p>A timid voice roused Taurus Antinor from his dream:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My gracious lord, thy litter is here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He started as a man suddenly wakened from sleep, and once or twice his eyes
    closed and opened again ere they rested finally on the broad back bent in
    a curve before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Methought my gracious lord was waiting,&rdquo; continued the speaker
    in the same timid voice, &ldquo;and mayhap did not see the litter among the
    shadows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear me I was dreaming, my good Folces,&rdquo; said the praefect
    with a sigh, &ldquo;for truly I did know that thou wast here. Is the girl
    Nola with thee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, gracious lord. She waits on thy pleasure, and thy bearers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, did I not tell thee that I would have no bearers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The way is long, gracious lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told thee that I would walk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But my lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence now,&rdquo; he said with some of his habitual impatience; &ldquo;send
    my litter and bearers home; bring me the mantle I required, and do thou and
    Nola follow me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Reluctantly the old man obeyed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My gracious lord will be footsore&mdash;the way is long and ill-paved&mdash;&rdquo;  he
    muttered, half audibly, even as he made his way to the rear of the bosquet
    of lilies where a group of slaves stood waiting desultorily.</p>
  <p>Anon he returned carrying a mantle of dark woollen stuff, and Taurus Antinor,
    having wrapped himself in this, slowly turned to walk down the hill.</p>
  <p>Leaving the imperial palaces behind him, he went rapidly along the silent
    and deserted street. It wound its tortuous way at first on the crest of the
    hill, skirting the majestic temple of Magna Mater with its elevated portico
    and noble steps that lost themselves in the shadows of labyrinthine colonnades.</p>
  <p>The street itself&mdash;narrow and unpaved&mdash;was in places rendered
    almost impassable by the piles of constructor&rsquo;s materials and rubbish
    that encumbered it at every step&mdash;debris or future requisites of the
    gigantic and numberless building operations which the mad Emperor pursued
    with that feverish energy and maniacal restlessness that characterised his
    every action. Palaces here and temples there, a bridge over the Forum, a
    new circus, new baths, the constant pulling down of one edifice to make room
    for the construction of another: all this work&mdash;commenced and still
    unfinished&mdash;had changed the whole aspect of the great city, turning
    it into a wilderness of enormous beams and huge blocks of uncut marble and
    stone that littered its every way.</p>
  <p>But Taurus Antinor paid no heed to the roughness and inaccessibility of
    the road. Unlike the rich patricians of the time he hated the drowsy indolence
    of progress in a litter, and after the fatigues of a nerve-racking day, the
    difficulties of ill-paved roads were in harmony with his present mood.</p>
  <p>Assuring himself that old Folces and the girl Nola were close at his heels,
    he stepped briskly along the now precipitous incline of the hill. The rapid
    movement did him good. The air came to him from across the gardens of the
    palaces, sweetly scented by late lilies and clumps of dying roses.</p>
  <p>Soon he had left the great circus behind him too, and now he started climbing
    again, for his way led him upwards on the slope of the Aventine Hill. The
    silence here seemed more absolute than among the dwellings of the rich, for
    there, at times, a night watchman would emerge from a cross-road and give
    challenge to the belated passer-by, whilst a certain bustle of suspended
    animation always reigned around the palace of the Emperor even during the
    hours of sleep; some of his slaves and guard were always kept awake, ready
    to minister to any fancy or caprice that might seize the mad C&aelig;sar
    in the middle of the night.</p>
  <p>But here where there were no palaces to guard, no insane ruler to protect,
    no one came to question the purpose of the benighted wanderers, nor did sudden
    outbursts of laughter or good cheer pierce the mud walls of the humble abodes
    that lay scattered on the slope of the hill.</p>
  <p>The waning moon had hidden her light behind a heavy bank of clouds, a dull
    greyness pervaded the whole landscape, causing it to look weird and forlorn
    in the gloom. The few trees dotted about here and there looked starved and
    gaunt on the barren hillside, with great skeleton-like arms that waved mournfully
    in the breeze; the ground uneven and parched&mdash;after the summer&rsquo;s
    drought&mdash;rose and sank in fantastic mounds and shapes like tiny fortresses
    of ghosts or ghouls; the street itself soon became merged in the general
    surroundings, only a tiny footway, scarcely discernible in the gathering
    darkness, wound upwards to the summit of the hill.</p>
  <p>From time to time a solid block of what appeared only as impenetrable blackness
    loomed up from out the shadows, with all the grandeur of exaggerated size
    which the darkness of the night so generously lends. Soon it would reveal
    itself as a small mud-covered box, with four bare walls and a narrow doorway
    facing toward the south. Herein lived and suffered a family of human beings&mdash;freedmen
    and women without the stigma of slavery, but with all the misery of destitution
    and often of complete starvation.</p>
  <p>Here and there the little house would be surrounded by a vestibule&mdash;a
    mere projection from the roof supported on a few rough beams&mdash;but never
    a garden, scarcely a tree to cast a cooling shade on hot summer afternoons,
    or clump of lilies or mimosa to sweeten the air that came dank and fetid
    from over the marshes beyond the hill.</p>
  <p>Not a sound now disturbed the stillness of the night save when a bat fluttered
    overhead, or when furtive footsteps&mdash;on unavowable errand bent&mdash;glided
    softly off the beaten track and quickly died away among the shadows.</p>
  <p>The praefect walked on, heedless of his surroundings. The mood that had
    been on him ever since he left Caius Nepos&rsquo; house still caused his
    mind to wander restlessly in the illimitable regions of perplexity and doubt.
    He scarcely looked where he was going, for he kept his eyes fixed upon the
    starlit canopy above him and upon the crest of the hill which lost itself
    in the darkness overhead.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, out of the gloom, two pairs of hands emerged, and without warning
    fastened themselves on the praefect&rsquo;s throat: thin, claw-like hands
    they were, and above them gaunt arms, mere bones covered with wrinkled flesh
    that proclaimed starvation and misery.</p>
  <p>The old slave from the rear uttered a cry of terror; Nola clung to him paralysed
    with fear. The slopes of the Aventine were noted for the gangs of malefactors
    that infested them, and defying the power of the aediles, rendered them unsafe
    for wayfarers even in the light of day.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor, instantly brought back from the land of dreams, had no great
    difficulty in freeing himself from the claw-like grasp. With a quick gesture
    of his own powerful hands, he had in a moment succeeded in dragging the gaunt
    fingers from off his throat, and, holding the thin wrists with a firm grip,
    he gave them a sudden sharp twist, which elicited two cries of pain and brought
    two pairs of knees in hard contact with the ground.</p>
  <p>It had all occurred in the space of a few seconds, and now a bundle of soiled
    rags seemed to be lying huddled up under the praefect&rsquo;s foot, and he
    looked like some powerful desert beast that has placed a massive paw on a
    pair of puny rats.</p>
  <p>The thin arms wriggled like worms in his mighty grasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pity, my lord! Pity!&rdquo; came in hoarse murmurs from the bundle
    of rags under his foot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pity? Of that have I in plenty,&rdquo; he replied gruffly. &ldquo;But
    methinks  &lsquo;twas not pity ye sought by trying to strangle me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pity, my lord, my children are starving....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pity, my lord, I have not tasted food to-day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pity, my lord!&rdquo; retorted the praefect with a grim laugh, and
    mimicking the wretched man&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;I would have murdered you
    had I had the power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he relaxed his grip, and with his foot pushed the bundle of dirt further
    away from him. He groped in his wallet and drew out some silver coins. These
    he threw, one by one, into the midst of the shapeless rags, and he stooped
    forward, striving in the darkness to see something of the faces that were
    wilfully hidden from him, something of the mouths that had uttered the pitiable
    groans.</p>
  <p>Vaguely he discerned the outline of cadaverous cheeks, of sunken temples,
    of furtive eyes veiled by thin lids; he saw the glances half of fear, wholly
    of doubt, that were thrown on the silver coins, heard the muttered oaths,
    the incipient quarrel over the distribution of the unexpected hoard.</p>
  <p>Then did the strange perplexities which had assailed him throughout this
    night find expression in bitter words. He threw down a few more coins and
    said slowly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These are for pity&rsquo;s sake, and in the name of One Whom mayhap
    ye will know one day. He died that ye should live! Bear that in mind and
    ponder on it. Mayhap ye will find the solution to that riddle. That such
    as you should live in eternity, therefore did He die.... When ye have understood
    this and can explain the value of your lives as compared with His, come and
    tell it to the praefect of Rome and he will shower on you wealth beyond your
    dreams.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, without waiting to hear protestations, or heeding the ironical laughter
    that came from the bewildered night-prowlers, he turned on his heels and
    resumed his interrupted walk along the slope of the hill.</p>

  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>The footpath&mdash;scarce more than a beaten track&mdash;soon disappeared
    altogether. Presently Taurus Antinor paused and called to Folces to come
    up to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Methinks we must be near the house,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, gracious lord,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;just on thy right,
    some two hundred steps from here. The way is very dark, wilt permit me to
    walk by thy side?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walk by my side an thou wilt. Thou canst direct me more easily; but
    as to the darkness I can see through it well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But my gracious lord did not see those evil malefactors that set
    upon him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Folces, I was dreaming as I walked. They came upon me unawares.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And my gracious lord allowed them to go. They were notorious miscreants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They were the embodiment of a strange riddle, good Folces. They helped
    to puzzle me&mdash;and Heaven knows that I was puzzled enough ere I saw those
    miserable wretches. Mayhap some day I&rsquo;ll understand the riddle which
    their abject persons did represent. But now tell me, is this the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The wanderers had struck to their right and walked on some two hundred paces.
    Now they paused beside one of those square mud-walled boxes, of which they
    could only discern the narrow door made of unplaned wood, and through the
    chinks of which a faint light glimmered weirdly. Two or three steps fashioned
    in the earth itself led down toward the threshold. Taurus Antinor descended
    these and knocked boldly on the door.</p>
  <p>It was opened from within, and under the rough lintel there appeared the
    figure of a man of short stature, clad in a long grey tunic. His head, which
    he held forward in an attempt to peer through the darkness, looked almost
    unnaturally large, owing to the mass of loose greyish hair that fell away
    from his forehead like a mane, and the long beard that straggled down upon
    his breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May we enter, friend?&rdquo; asked Taurus Antinor.</p>
  <p>At the sound of the voice the man drew aside, and through the narrow doorway
    was now revealed the interior of the house&mdash;a straight, square room,
    with a few wooden seats disposed about, and at the top end an oblong table
    covered with a snow-white cloth. An aperture in the wall appeared to lead
    to an inner chamber, which must indeed have been of diminutive size, for
    the central room seemed to occupy almost the whole of the interior of the
    house. Suspended by an iron chain from the ceiling above there hung a small
    lamp in which flickered a tiny flame fed by some sweet-smelling oil. It threw
    but little light around and left deep and curious shadows in the angles of
    the room.</p>
  <p>From out these, as the praefect entered, there emerged the figure of an
    old woman, with smooth grey hair half-hidden beneath a kerchief of strange
    oriental design, and straight dark robe, foreign in cut and appearance to
    those usually seen in the streets of Rome.</p>
  <p>The massive figure of Taurus Antinor seemed almost to fill the entire room,
    but he stood to one side now disclosing the old slave and the girl Nola.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, addressing the woman, &ldquo;is the child of
    whom I spoke to thee. She is friendless and motherless, but she is free,
    and I have brought her so that thou mayest teach her all thou knowest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile the man with the leonine head had closed the door on the
    little party. He came forward eagerly, and raising himself on the tips of
    his toes, he put his hands on Antinor&rsquo;s shoulder, and with gentle pressure
    forced him to stoop. Then he kissed him on either cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Greeting to thee, dear friend,&rdquo; he said cheerily. &ldquo;Thou
    hast done well to bring the girl. My mother and I will take great care of
    her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And ye will teach her your religion,&rdquo; said Taurus Antinor earnestly;  &ldquo;because
    of that did I bring her. She is young and will be teachable. She&rsquo;ll
    understand as a child will, that which hardened hearts are unable to grasp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, friend,&rdquo; said the man simply, &ldquo;there is not a great
    deal to teach, nor a great deal to understand. Love and faith, that is sufficient
    ... and, as our dear Lord did tell us, love is the greatest of all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For the moment the praefect made no reply. The man had helped him to cast
    off his heavy mantle, and he stood now in all the splendour of barbaric pomp,
    a strangely incongruous figure in this tiny bare room, both to his surroundings
    and to his gentle host and hostess with their humble garb and simple, timid
    ways.</p>
  <p>She&mdash;the woman&mdash;had drawn Nola with kindly gesture to her. The
    child was crying softly, for she was half-frightened at the strangeness of
    the place, and also she was tired after her long walk up and down the rough
    road. The woman, with subtle feminine comprehension, soon realised this,
    and also understood that the girl, reared in slavery, felt awed in the presence
    of so great a lord. So, putting a kindly arm round the slender form of the
    child, she led her gently out of the main room to the tiny cubicle beyond,
    where she could rest.</p>
  <p>The three men were now left alone. Folces, squatting in a dark corner, kept
    his eyes fixed upon his master. He took no interest in what went on around
    him; he cared nothing about the strangeness of the surroundings, his master
    was lord and praefect of Rome, and could visit those whom he list. But Folces,
    like a true watch-dog, remained on the alert, silent and ever suspicious,
    keeping an eye on his master, remaining obedient and silent until told to
    speak.</p>
  <p>The man, in the meanwhile, had asked the praefect to sit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wilt rest a while, O friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whilst I make
    ready for supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Antinor would not sit down. In his habitual way he leaned against the
    wall, watching with those earnest eyes of his every movement of his host,
    as the latter first passed a loving hand over the white cloth on the table
    and then smoothed out every crease on its satiny surface. Anon he disappeared
    for a moment in the dark angle of the room, where a rough wooden chest stood
    propped against the wall. From this he now took out a loaf of fine wheaten
    bread, also a jar containing wine and some plain earthenware goblets. These
    things he set upon the table, his big leonine head bent to his simple task,
    his small grey eyes wandering across from time to time in kindliness on his
    friend.</p>
  <p>Intuition&mdash;born of intense sympathy&mdash;had already told him that
    something was amiss with the praefect. He knew every line of the rugged face
    which many deemed so fierce and callous, but in which he had so often seen
    the light of an all-embracing charity.</p>
  <p>When Taurus Antinor used to visit his friend in the olden days he was wont
    to shed from him that mantle of rebellious pride with which, during the exercise
    of his duties in Rome, he always hid his real personality. People said of
    the praefect that he was sullen and morose, merciless in his judgments in
    the tribunal where he presided. They said that he was ambitious and intriguing,
    and that he had gained and held the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s ear for purposes
    of his own advancement. But the man and woman who had come recently on the
    Aventine and who called the praefect of Rome their friend, knew that his
    rough exterior hid a heart brimming over with pity, and that his aloofness
    came from a mind absorbed in thoughts of God.</p>
  <p>But to-day the praefect seemed different. The look of joy with which he
    had greeted his friends had quickly faded away, leaving the face darkened
    with some hidden care; and as the man watched him across the narrow room,
    he seemed to see in the strong face something that almost looked like remorse.</p>
  <p>Therefore, whilst accomplishing the task which he loved so well, he quietly
    watched his friend and resolved that he should not recross the threshold
    of this house without having unburdened his soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; he now said abruptly, &ldquo;I have a curious whim
    to-night. Wilt indulge it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If it be in my power,&rdquo; responded the praefect, rousing himself
    from his reverie.</p>
  <p>A look of deep affection softened for the moment the hard look on his face,
    as his deep-set eyes rested on the quaint figure of the man with the leonine
    head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is thy whim?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Over in Jud&aelig;a we were so little alone,&rdquo; rejoined the
    latter, &ldquo;and then we had such earnest things to talk about, that I
    have never heard from thy lips how it came to pass that thou didst hear our
    dear Lord preach in Galilee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet I did tell thee,&rdquo; said the praefect, &ldquo;when first
    thou didst ask my confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then &rsquo;tis my whim to hear thee tell me again,&rdquo; rejoined
    the man simply.  &ldquo;All that pertains to our dear Lord doth lie so close
    to my heart, and &rsquo;tis long now since I have spoken of Him to one who
    hath seen and heard Him. &rsquo;Tis great joy to me to hear of every impression
    which He made on the heart of those whose life was gladdened by a sight of
    His face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose life was gladdened by a sight of His face!&rdquo; repeated
    Taurus Antinor gently. &ldquo;Aye! there dost speak the truth, O friend!
    for my life too was gladdened by a sight of His face. I was travelling through
    Jud&aelig;a, on my way to Syria, and the C&aelig;sar had desired me to visit
    the proconsul. Thus did I halt in Jerusalem one day. Having done the Emperor&rsquo;s
    bidding, I had time to kill ere I started further on my journey. So I bethought
    me that I would like to see something of the Man from Nazareth of Whom I
    had heard speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And God prompted thee, friend, to go and hear Him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God, sayest thou?&rdquo; rejoined the praefect slowly. &ldquo;Aye!
    mayhap thou&rsquo;rt right. &lsquo;Twas God then that sent me. Disguised
    in humble raiment I went forth one day and made my way to the desert lands
    of Galilee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And didst see Him there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw Him sitting on a low mound of earth with the canopy of blue
    above His head, and all around Him a multitude that hung entranced upon His
    lips. He spoke to them of the Kingdom of Heaven&mdash;a Kingdom of whose
    existence, alas! I had never dreamed. But His words did wring my heart, and
    the majesty of His presence has ever since been before mine eyes. To-day
    it all came back to me, the gentle face, the perfect mouth framing exquisite
    words. Above Him a curtain of azure, and far away, the illimitable stretch
    of horizon merging into the water beyond. The very air was still and listening
    to His words; from under jagged boulders tiny lizards peeped out, and on
    the branches of starved, gaunt trees the birds had stopped to rest. Then
    it was that panther-like, sleek sleuth-hounds hovered round Him, trying to
    entangle Him in His talk. They made their way close to Him, and with honeyed
    words and deft insinuations, spoke of allegiance and of the tribute due to
    C&aelig;sar. I stood not far off and could hear what they said. My very heart
    seemed to still its beating, for did not their questions embrace the whole
    riddle of mine own life. God and C&aelig;sar! I, the servant of C&aelig;sar&mdash;the
    recipient of rich gifts from his hands&mdash;should I forswear the C&aelig;sar
    and follow Jesus of Nazareth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And didst hear what He answered, friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! I heard it. And to-day when traitors spoke, it seemed as if
    the Divine Presence stood close to me amongst the shadows. Once more I saw
    the bleak and arid land, the skeleton arms of the trees, the blue firmament
    above my head, I saw the multitude of simple folk around Him and the leer
    in the eyes of the tempters. And above the din of drunken revelries to-night
    I heard again the voice that bade me then to render unto C&aelig;sar the
    things which are C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s, and unto God the things that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The other sighed, a sigh of glad content.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank thee, friend, for telling me this. &rsquo;Tis a joy to hear
    thee speak of Him. It is so long since we talked of this matter. And&mdash;tell
    me yet again&mdash;thou wast in Jerusalem when He died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I stood on Golgotha,&rdquo; said the praefect slowly, &ldquo;on that
    day before the Jewish Passover, seven years ago. Once again wrapped in a
    dark cloak, one among a multitude, I gazed with eyes that I felt could never
    look on anything else again. I saw the patient face smeared with blood, the
    God-like head crowned with thorns, the eyes&mdash;still brimming over with
    love&mdash;slowly closing in agony. Overhead the heavens murmured, vivid
    flashes of lightning rent the canopy of the sky, and men around me mocked
    and jeered, whilst the Divine Soul fled upwards back to God. At that moment,
    O friend! I seemed to lose mine own identity. I&mdash;even I alone&mdash;became
    the whole multitude. I was no longer just mine own self, but I was all of
    us who looked, who heard and saw and did not yet understand.... A multitude
    was looking through my eyes ... a multitude heard through mine ears ... I
    was the crowd of poor, of helpless slaves, and I was the whole of the patriciate
    of Rome. I was barbarian and Italian, I was British and Roman, all in one
    ... and my voice was the voice of the entire world, as suddenly I cried out
    to Him: &lsquo;Do not die now and leave us desolate!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>His harsh voice broke down in a great sob that came from out the depths
    of an overburdened heart. He took a few steps forward and slowly dropped
    on his knees right against the table, his clasped hands resting on the cloth,
    his forehead buried in his hands.</p>
  <p>The man had listened to him silently and patiently with, in his heart, that
    subtle understanding for another&rsquo;s sorrow, which his own mission had
    instilled into him. And thus understanding he went up to that end of the
    table where knelt the rich and mighty praefect of Rome, the friend of C&aelig;sar,
    all-powerful in the land, with burning head buried in his hands, and eyes
    from which despite his will hot tears gushed up that would not be suppressed.</p>
  <p>He placed a kindly hand on the bowed shoulder of his friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wilt tell me what troubles thee?&rdquo; he said gently.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor passed his hand across his forehead as if to chase away the
    brain-searing thoughts. He raised himself from his knees and gratefully pressed
    the hand that had recalled him to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not do that. Thy friendship
    is too precious a guerdon that I should jeopardise it by showing thee the
    blackness of my soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost talk at random,&rdquo; said the other firmly; &ldquo;my friendship
    doth not come and go like fleeting sunshine on a winter&rsquo;s day. I gave
    it thee on that self-same unforgettable day when I saw thee standing alone
    upon the hill after the crowd had departed and we who loved Him were lifting
    Him down from His Cross.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou didst take pity then on my loneliness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw in thee one who had faith,&rdquo; said the man simply. &ldquo;I
    grasped thy hand in friendship then, not knowing who thou wast. When I knew,
    then did I follow thee to Rome, for I needed thy help. My Master sent me
    here. I do His work that He did enjoin on all His disciples. Thy protection
    and friendship, O mighty praefect of Rome, hath been an infinite help to
    me. Thy kindness and charity hath saved from want the many humble followers
    of Christ who have been forced to give up all for His sake. Therefore whatever
    doth burden thy soul now, I pray thee share it with me, so that I might bear
    it with thee and mayhap ease thy load.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May God bless thee for these words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And thy burden, friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask not to share it&mdash;&rsquo;tis one of treachery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of treachery?... Whose treachery?...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thine?... I&rsquo;ll not believe it.... Thou a traitor ... against
    C&aelig;sar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Against whom, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Against Him Whose death I witnessed seven years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll not believe it. And &rsquo;tis sacrilege thus to
    jest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jest?&rdquo; said Taurus Antinor, with a laugh that rang unnatural
    and hoarse.  &ldquo;Jest! when for a day and a night my soul hath been on
    the rack and mocking demons have jeered at my torments? Jest! When&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He broke off abruptly and looked down with an earnest gaze on the upturned
    face of his friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If thou wouldst tell me more it would ease thy heart,&rdquo; said
    the man simply.</p>
  <p>For a moment or two the praefect was silent. His hand rested on his friend&rsquo;s
    shoulder, and his eyes, with their deep furrow between the brows, were fixed
    on the kind face that invited confidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For seven years,&rdquo; he said abruptly, but speaking very slowly, &ldquo;whilst
    I served the C&aelig;sar, every one of my waking thoughts and many of my
    dreams tended to that day in Jerusalem and the three hours&rsquo; agony which
    I had witnessed on Golgotha. Yesterday did a woman cross my path&mdash;and
    now I have thoughts only of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is this woman?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is of the House of C&aelig;sar, pure and chaste as the lilies
    in my garden at Ostia, proud and unapproachable as the stars ... her heart
    is a closed book wherein man hath never read ... but since her eyes have
    mocked me with their smile, my heart is enchained to her service and I see
    naught but her loveliness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look upwards, man; a glowing Cross will blind thine eyes to all save
    to itself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have I not looked,&rdquo; said the praefect, with a sharp, quick
    sigh,  &ldquo;until mine eyes have ached with trying to see that which once
    was so clear. But now, between me and that sacred memory that methought had
    been branded into my very soul, there always rises the vision of a girl,
    tall and slender as the lilies, clad all in white as they. She stands between
    me and memory, and mine eyes grow weary and dim trying to see beyond that
    vision, recalling to my mind the picture of that Cross, the thorn-crowned
    head, the pierced hands and feet. She stands between me and memory, and with
    laughing eyes defies me not to see her, and I look and look, and the vision
    of the Cross grows more faint, and she stands there serene and white and
    silent, with blue eyes smiling on my treachery and scornful voice upraised,
    denying God and Christ. She is of the House of C&aelig;sar and she is ignorant,
    and she laughs at my belief and scorns all thought of God, and I do find
    it in my treacherous heart to pity her and pitying her to kneel at her feet.
    And all the while a thousand demons shout mockingly unto mine ear: &lsquo;Thou
    art a traitor&mdash;a traitor to thy God&mdash;for were she to beckon, &rsquo;tis
    to her that thou wouldst go, forgetting all&mdash;thine immortal soul, thy
    crucified God...?&rsquo; And thus do devils mock me, and my soul grows darker
    and darker and greater and greater grows the mystery, for my heart, broken,
    miserably doubting and weak, cries out not with resignation, not in patience,
    but in a spirit of angry rebellion: &lsquo;God, my God! why hast thou forsaken
    me?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>He raised his arms up to heaven as if in a last desperate appeal; but now
    he did not kneel&mdash;he stood beside his friend shamed and yet proud, and
    the look in his eyes was that of one who sees a vision that is exquisitely
    beautiful and dear. The other saw the look, and with the kind indulgence
    taught by a sublime teacher, he found it in his heart to pity and to love.
    Once more he placed his thin, wrinkled hand on the praefect&rsquo;s shoulder,
    and his small eyes beamed with perfect faith and trust as he said gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not try and probe any mystery just now, O friend, the day has
    been long and thou art weary and sad. Come and sit beside me here at table;
    my mother will join us and the girl Nola too, and the man who is thy slave,
    if thou wilt so allow it. Together we&rsquo;ll think of that day in Jud&aelig;a
    seven years ago, and we&rsquo;ll break bread and drink wine, and&mdash;without
    trying to understand anything&mdash;we&rsquo;ll do it all together in memory
    of Him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment Taurus Antinor was silent. In the strong face every line told
    of the great storm within the innermost heart.</p>
  <p>And slowly the man beside him repeated the most exquisite words that have
    ever been spoken to a troubled soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come unto Me all ye that travail and are heavy laden and I will refresh
    you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s head fell upon his breast. He closed his eyes, for
    not even his friend should see that they were wet with tears. But even whilst
    the heartstrings were torn by the ruthless hand of passion, it seemed as
    if&mdash;when the man had finished speaking&mdash;the magic words had already
    left upon the soul their impress of infinite peace.</p>
  <p>And without another word, he went slowly forward and took his place at the
    table.</p>
  <p>At a call from the man, the old woman entered softly, her woollen shoes
    making no sound upon the wooden floor. She had Nola by the hand who seemed
    comforted and rested. The praefect beckoned to Folces, who silently obeyed
    and came forward to the table.</p>
  <p>Then the five of them sat down and quietly partook of supper, sitting side
    by side, the disciple from Jud&aelig;a and his mother, the two slaves and
    the praefect of Rome. The Christians sat beside the pagans, the mighty lord
    beside his slave, and they broke bread and drank wine, all in memory of Him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming.&rdquo;&mdash;Isaiah
    14. 9.</p>
  <p>I pray you follow me now to an inner chamber in the palace of the mighty
    C&aelig;sar. A square room with walls of marble inlaid with precious stones,
    and with hangings of crimson silk to exclude the searching light of day.
    The air heavy with the fumes of burning incense that wound in spiral curves
    upwards to the domed roof, and escaped&mdash;ethereal and elusive&mdash;through
    the tiny openings practised therein, the seats of gilded wood with downy
    cushions that seemed to melt at a touch, and in a recess a monumental bed
    of solid and priceless citrus, carved by the hand of a Greek sculptor, with
    curtains of purple silk wrought all over with stars.</p>
  <p>In vases of delicate murra huge bunches of blood-red roses hung their drooping
    heads, and beneath the feet carpets of heavy silk hid the exquisite beauty
    of mosaics of lapis-lazuli and chrysoprase.</p>
  <p>And in the midst of all this stately gorgeousness a creature&mdash;hardly
    human&mdash;raging round like a thwarted beast.</p>
  <p>Caius Julius C&aelig;sar Caligula was in one of his maddest moods; his hollow
    eyes glowed with unnatural fire, his scanty, light-coloured hair stood up
    around his head like the bristly mane of a hyena. Up and down the room he
    stamped with heavy feet; his robe, weighted with precious stones, striking
    out around him as he trod the smooth surface of silken carpets or the slippery
    mosaic of the floor. His thin arms and ankles were covered with numerous
    bracelets and on his feet were shoes studded with diamonds.</p>
  <p>At first sight it would indeed have been difficult to say if it was a man
    or a woman who was thus pacing this magnificent cage, with wild gestures
    of the arms and hoarse cries that seemed to proceed from no human throat.
    The face, white and puffy, might have been of either sex, and the flowing
    garment and wealth of jewellery suggested a woman rather than a man.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar was crazy with rage, and all round the room slaves and attendants
    cowered, terrified. In his hand he had a short whip with five thongs of solid,
    knotted leather, at the end of each of which was an iron hook. From these
    five hooks a few drops of blood were trickling down his white silk tunic.
    At intervals, at the slightest noise or sound from the cowering slaves, he
    struck out savagely with the whip, and the thongs with their sharp hooks
    would descend whizzing on some naked shoulder and tear out a piece of flesh
    and start the flow of a fresh stream of blood.</p>
  <p>Then the madman would break out into a diabolical fit of laughter, and strike
    out with his whip again and again all around him, wildly and indiscriminately,
    until his garments and his face were spattered all over with blood, and to
    right and left of him shrieking figures fell fainting to the ground.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar was crazy with rage, and he who had thus angered him reclined
    on a couch, out of the reach of the shrieking demon, and his thin lips were
    curled in a smile of satisfaction. It was Caius Nepos who was here that he
    might betray those of his accomplices who had swerved from their allegiance
    to himself, and behind him&mdash;well hidden by the draperies of the couch&mdash;cowered
    Hun Rhavas, the dusky slave of the treasury, he who yesterday had appeared
    before the tribunal of the praefect of Rome for conspiracy to defraud the
    State in connection with the sale of the slave-girl Nola.</p>
  <p>The law in such matters was severe. It demanded that a delinquent against
    the State&mdash;if he be a slave&mdash;shall lose his right hand, or his
    tongue, or his ears; that he should moreover forfeit his entire hard-saved
    belongings to the treasury and lose all chance of ever obtaining his freedom.
    But the praefect had been lenient, and though he could not dismiss the offender,
    he mitigated his punishment.</p>
  <p>Hun Rhavas was publicly scourged and branded, but he lost neither ears,
    tongue, nor hand, nor was he deprived of the peculium with which ultimately
    he hoped to purchase his own freedom and that of his children. Yet such was
    the African&rsquo;s nature, such the result of the training which slavery
    in the imperial entourage had drilled into him, that Hun Rhavas forgot the
    clemency and only remembered the punishment.</p>
  <p>With bleeding back and mind saturated with hate, he sought audience of the
    Emperor, and obtained it half an hour after Caius Nepos, the praetorian praefect,
    had himself been introduced in the presence of Caligula. The story which
    Hun Rhavas&mdash;the paid spy&mdash;brought to the ear of C&aelig;sar, was
    but a confirmation of what Caius Nepos had to tell.</p>
  <p>A conspiracy was on foot to murder the father of the armies, the greatest
    and best of C&aelig;sars. The flower of the Roman patriciate was wallowing
    in this monstrous treachery. Hortensius Martius was in it up to the neck,
    so was Marcus Ancyrus, the elder, and Philippus Decius and Philario, of the
    imperial household.</p>
  <p>Hun Rhavas had seen them consorting together and whispering among themselves
    the day of the sale of the late censor&rsquo;s slaves. He was able to state
    positively that the praefect of Rome was at one with the band of traitors.</p>
  <p>This last fact had brought the frenzied C&aelig;sar to the verge of death.
    He nearly choked with the violence of his rage. He had believed in the honesty
    of Taurus Antinor: had even looked on him as a lucky fetish. This man&rsquo;s
    treachery was more infuriating than that of a thousand others. In the madness
    of his wrath he would have killed Hun Rhavas with his own hands had not the
    latter succeeded in hiding himself out of the raving maniac&rsquo;s reach.</p>
  <p>Had he dared, Caligula would have tortured Caius Nepos until he too gave
    him evidence against Taurus Antinor; but on this point the praetorian praefect
    was guarded. He had not yet made up his mind whether friendship or enmity
    with the praefect of Rome would be to his own advantage. All that he wanted
    at this moment was to be rid of those who had opposed him last night for
    the sake of their own schemes. Therefore in measured words he only spoke
    of the whisperings which he had overheard in the vestibule of his own house,
    between a certain band headed by Hortensius Martius and Marcus Ancyrus, the
    elder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;During the Circensian games, O C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;they
    hope to raise a tumult amongst the people ... and whilst the attention of
    thy faithful guard is drawn away from thy sacred person, one of the miscreants
    is to plunge a dagger in thy throat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here he was forced to silence by a cry like that of a slaughtered ox, which
    shook the marble pillars of the hall. Caligula had thrown himself upon the
    bed and was writhing there like a mad beast, biting the coverlets, beating
    with clenched fists against the woodwork, while foam dripped from the corners
    of his mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me more&mdash;tell me&mdash;&rdquo; he bellowed at last,
    during an interval between two of these maniacal spasms.</p>
  <p>The slaves all round the room were trembling with fear; Hun Rhavas, huddled
    under the couch, was shaking like a leaf.</p>
  <p>But Caius Nepos, calm and dignified, waited in silence until the paroxysm
    had abated, then he quietly went on with his tale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is but little else to tell, O C&aelig;sar. I came to warn thee
    ... for &rsquo;tis easy for thee to wear a shirt of mail to cover thy throat
    and breast against the dagger of assassins. But the conspirators hushed their
    talk in my presence. I tried to hear more and played the spy in thy service,
    but my heart was burdened with loyalty for thee, so I came thus early to
    put thee on thy guard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar had once more resumed his restless walk up and down the
    room. He was biting his fists, trying to restrain himself from striking the
    noble informer as brutally as he did his slaves, for he loathed the bearer
    of evil tidings almost as much as the secret traitors. He suffered from an
    overwhelming fury of hatred and from an unquenchable thirst for blood.</p>
  <p>But three years ago the people and patricians had acclaimed him with shouts
    and rejoicings; they had feasted in his honour, proclaimed his godhead and
    his power, and now they were plotting to murder him! The madman threw out
    his arms in a passionate longing for revenge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They would kill me,&rdquo; he cried hoarsely, &ldquo;kill me!&rdquo; ...
    And a demoniacal laugh broke from his swollen throat. He tore the garments
    from off his chest and buried his nails in his own flesh, whilst roar upon
    roar of his mad laughter woke the echoes of his stately palace.</p>
  <p>Then suddenly the paroxysm died completely down. An unnatural calm succeeded
    the violent outbursts of rage. Caligula, with a corner of his silken robe,
    wiped the perspiration from his streaming face. He threw himself on a seat,
    and resting both elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands, he stared
    contemplatively before him.</p>
  <p>Of a truth this calm seemed even more awe-inspiring than the snarls and
    cries of a while ago. Caius Nepos&rsquo; sallow cheeks became still more
    ashen in colour as he cast a quick glance round the room, feeling perhaps
    for the first time to-day how completely he was at the mercy of a raving
    lunatic if the latter should turn against him. But the C&aelig;sar sat there
    for some time, ruminating, with great hollow eyes fixed on one spot on the
    ground and gusts of stertorous breathing escaped from his chest.</p>
  <p>After a while he spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou didst not tell me yet, O kind friend!&rdquo; he said dully, &ldquo;what
    the traitors mean to do once they have murdered their C&aelig;sar. Whom would
    they set up as his successor? They cannot all be emperors of Rome. For whose
    sake then do they intend to commit this damnable treachery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, great C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; replied Caius Nepos drily, &ldquo;methinks
    they all have a desire to become Emperor of Rome, and this being impossible,
    there was a vast deal of wrangling in my vestibule last night. I caught the
    purport of several words, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And of several names?&rdquo; asked Caligula in the same even voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard one name spoken in particular, O C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That of the Augusta, thy kinswoman,&rdquo; said Caius Nepos, after
    a slight moment of hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of Dea Flavia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even hers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But she is a woman, and cannot lead an army,&rdquo; said the Emperor,
    whose voice sounded hollow and distant, as if it came from out the depths
    of a grave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor was that suggested, O C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The conspirators, methinks, have agreed amongst themselves that the
    future husband of Dea Flavia Augusta&mdash;whoever he might be&mdash;should
    be the successor of the murdered C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whoever he might be,&rdquo; repeated the Emperor, mechanically echoing
    the other&rsquo;s words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! The Augusta, I understand, favours no one as yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She hath made no choice ... to thy knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no ... her choice was to be made after ... afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her choice to be made by her&mdash;or by them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I know not, great C&aelig;sar. The Augusta, I feel sure, was
    not a consenting party to the treachery. The traitors would use her for their
    own ends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After this there was silence for a while. Caligula still sat staring with
    wide-open eyes before him, whilst the slaves held their breath, staring fascinated
    on that terrible whip, lying momentarily forgotten.</p>
  <p>Caius Nepos, pale as a withered maple leaf, was from time to time moistening
    his dry lips with his tongue.</p>
  <p>The minutes sped on. Who shall say what fiendish thoughts were coursing
    through the mad tyrant&rsquo;s brain?</p>
  <p>At last he rose, and resumed his walk up and down the room. But no longer
    did he rave now, no longer did he strike about him like one bereft of reason.
    His face, though flushed and streaming with perspiration, was set and calm;
    his footsteps across the carpets were measured and firm. He had cast his
    whip aside and his hands were clenched behind his back, and on his brow there
    had appeared a deep furrow, the sign of concentrated thought.</p>
  <p>Then at last he paused in his walk and stood in the centre of the room facing
    the informer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank thee, good Caius Nepos,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for thy loyalty
    to me. To-morrow, mayhap, I shall think of a reward in accordance with thy
    service, but for the nonce I would wish to be alone. I have much to think
    of. The present crisis demands of me those qualities of courage and of statesmanship
    for which the citizens of Rome already know me. To-morrow I go to the opening
    of the games in the Circus. Mayhap there will be a tumult amongst the people,
    and mayhap a damnable traitor will make an attempt against the sacred life
    of one who is god and C&aelig;sar and emperor all in one. If all this occurs,
    and I find that thou didst not lie, then will I give thee such reward as
    even thou dost not at present dream of. But if between now and to-morrow
    I find that thou didst lie, that thou didst try to gain my favour and didst
    rouse my wrath only for the gaining of thine own ends, that thou didst slander
    Roman patricians with a view to removing thine own personal enemies, then
    will I devise for thee such punishment that on thy knees wilt beg of death
    to release thee from torment. And thou didst know, O Caius Nepos, that in
    the inventing of torture thy C&aelig;sar has the genius of a god.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His voice had become perfectly steady and natural in its tones; all his
    restless, jerky movements had ceased. Outwardly he seemed to be completely
    master of himself. But of a truth the aspect of the madman now was more terrible
    than before. His sallow cheeks were the colour of lead, his pale eyes had
    narrowed down till they were mere slits through which gleams of deadly hate
    shot mercilessly on the informer.</p>
  <p>Caius Nepos had great difficulty in keeping up an appearance of dignity.
    It was obviously in his interest to show neither confusion nor fear just
    now. Nothing but calm demeanour and a proud show of loyalty would ensure
    his personal safety at this moment. The praetorian praefect knew enough of
    the imperial despot to appreciate the danger of this outwardly quiet mood,
    which hid the utter callousness of demoniacal cruelty.</p>
  <p>Therefore, in response to the horrible threat, Caius Nepos merely bent his
    head as if in humble submission to the will of one who was as a god. He felt
    his teeth chattering against one another, his limbs trembling, his blood
    frozen within him, and with it all he had the additional horror of knowing
    that the brutish tyrant was looking him through and through, that he saw
    the fear in him and was gloating on it with delight.</p>
  <p>It was with a feeling of inexpressible relief that he at last understood
    that he was being dismissed. Steadying his limbs as best he could, he rose
    from his couch and made obeisance before the C&aelig;sar. Then almost mechanically
    and like one in a dream, but holding himself erect and composed, he walked
    backwards out of the room.</p>
  <p>The silken curtains weighted with gold fell together with a swishing sound
    behind him. And even as they did so a loud and prolonged roar of laughter,
    like that of a hundred demons let loose, echoed throughout the length and
    breadth of marble halls. Caius Nepos took to his heels and fled like one
    possessed, with hands pressed to his ears, trying to shut out the awful sounds
    that pursued him all down the corridors: the shrieks of pain, the whizzing
    of whipcord through the air, and, rising above all these, that awful laugh
    which must have found its origin in hell.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?&rdquo;&mdash;St. John
    1. 46.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia was standing beside a tall stool, on the top of which&mdash;on
    a level with her hands&mdash;was a shapeless mass of clay. Her fingers buried
    themselves in the soft substance or ran along the surface, as the exigencies
    of her task demanded.</p>
  <p>Now and then she paused in her work, drew back a step or two from the stool,
    and with head bent on one side surveyed her work with an anxious frown.</p>
  <p>Some few paces from her, at the further end of the room, a young girl sat
    on an elevated platform, with shoulders bare and head straight and rigid,
    the model for the proposed statue. Dea Flavia, in a simple garment of soft
    white stuff falling straight from her shoulders, looked peculiarly young
    and girlish at this moment, when she was free from all the pomp and paraphernalia
    of attendants that usually surrounded her wherever she went.</p>
  <p>The room in which she indulged her artistic fancy was large and bare, with
    stuccoed walls on which she herself had thrown quaint and fantastic pictures
    of goddesses and of beasts, and groups of charioteers and gladiators, drawn
    with a skilful hand. The room derived its light solely from above, where,
    through a wide opening in the ceiling, came a peep of cloud-covered sky.
    There was little or no furniture about, and the floor of iridescent mosaic
    was innocent of carpet. Only in the corners against the wall stood tall pots
    of earthenware filled with flowers, with a profusion of late summer lilies
    and roses and with great branches of leaves on which the coming autumn had
    already planted its first kiss that turns green to gold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold thy head up, girl, a little higher,&rdquo; said Dea Flavia impatiently;  &ldquo;thou
    sittest there like a hideous misshapen bunch of nothing-at-all. Dost think
    I&rsquo;ve paid a high price for thee that thou shouldst go to sleep all
    day upon that trestle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the girl, roused from semi-somnolence, would pull herself together with
    a little jerk, would straighten her shoulders and lift her chin, whilst a
    quickly smothered sigh of weariness would escape her lips.</p>
  <p>The air was heavy both within and without, with the presage of a coming
    storm. It had been terribly hot the last few days. The weather-wise&mdash;for
    there were many such at this time in Rome&mdash;had prophesied that Jupiter
    would send his thunders roaring before very long, and the feeling of thunder
    in the air caused the model to feel very sleepy, and on the forehead of Dea
    Flavia beads of perspiration would appear at the roots of tiny fair curls.</p>
  <p>She was working with a will but with strange, fretful movements, like one
    whose mind seems absent from the present task. Short sighs of impatience
    escaped her parted lips at intervals and a frown appeared and disappeared
    fitfully between her brows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chin up, girl ... shoulders straight!&rdquo; came in curt admonitions
    once or twice to the drowsy model.</p>
  <p>Whereupon from the furthest corner of the room Licinia would emerge, rod
    in hand, to emphasise the necessity of keeping awake when a beloved mistress
    so desired it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let her be, Licinia,&rdquo; said Dea Flavia with angry impatience
    when for the fifth time now the model fell in a huddled heap, with nose almost
    touching her knees, and heavy lids falling over sleepy eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    no use ... there is something in the air to-day. I cannot work.... Phew!...
    methinks I feel the approach of thunder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She threw down her modelling tools with a fretful gesture and then nervily
    began to destroy her morning&rsquo;s work, patting the clay aimlessly here
    and there until once more it became a shapeless mass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That lazy baggage hath spoilt thy pleasure,&rdquo; said Licinia gruffly;  &ldquo;but
    I&rsquo;ll teach her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, good Licinia!&rdquo; interposed the young girl with a weary
    smile.  &ldquo;Teach her nothing to-day.... The air is too heavy for serious
    lessons. Send her away and bring me water for my hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Licinia&mdash;muttering various dark threats&mdash;drove the frightened
    girl before her, Dea Flavia breathed a sigh of relief. Her hands were covered
    with clay, so she stood quite still waiting for the reappearance of Licinia
    with the water; and all the while the frown on her face grew darker and the
    look of trouble in her eyes more pronounced.</p>
  <p>Soon the old woman returned with a basin full of water in her hands and
    a white cloth over her arm. With her wonted loving care she washed Dea&rsquo;s
    hands between her own and dried them on the towel. Dea allowed her to perform
    this kindly office for her, standing quite still and gazing absently out
    into vacancy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What can I do now for thee, my precious?&rdquo; asked Licinia anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, Licinia, nothing,&rdquo; replied Dea with a sigh. &ldquo;Just
    leave me in peace.... I have a desire for solitude and silence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was the old woman&rsquo;s turn to sigh now, for she did not like this
    unwonted mood of her beloved. Dea Flavia, when in the privacy of her own
    house, was always gay and cheerful as a bird, prattling of all sorts of things,
    telling amusing anecdotes to her old nurse and playing light-heartedly with
    her young slaves, whenever she was not occupied with her artistic work. This
    frown upon the smooth, white brow was very unusual, and the fretful, impatient
    gestures were as unwonted as was that dreamy, absent gaze which spoke of
    anxious, troubled thoughts.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia herself could not understand her own mood. She could not have
    confided in the faithful old woman, even had she been so minded, for truly
    she would not have known what to confide.</p>
  <p>Her thoughts worried her. They were so insistent, dwelling obstinately on
    one moment which had flitted by yesterday&mdash;the moment when she stood
    facing the praefect of Rome, and looking into his deep, dark eyes, which
    then and there had reminded her of a stormy sea suddenly lulled to rest.
    It seemed as if nothing now or ever hereafter would chase from her mind the
    memory of his look and of his rugged voice, softened to infinite gentleness
    as he said: &ldquo;I told thee that He died upon the Cross.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She could hear that voice now, even as at this moment from afar a muffled
    sound of thunder went echoing over the hills, and, strive as she might, wherever
    she looked her eyes were haunted by the vision which he had conjured up of
    a man with arms outstretched upon a cross, whose might was yet greater than
    that of Rome.</p>
  <p>At the time she had been greatly angered. The praefect had spoken traitorous
    words, and she had hated him&mdash;she hated him still&mdash;for that allegiance
    which he seemed to have given to another. Then, with a quick, elusive trick,
    memory showed her the massive shoulders bent humbly at her feet, tying the
    strings of her shoe&mdash;a simple homage due to the daughter of C&aelig;sar&mdash;and
    the sharp pang of wrath once more shot through her heart with the remembrance
    that he had not deigned to press his lips against her foot.</p>
  <p>The man&rsquo;s face and figure haunted her for it was the face and the
    figure of one whom she had learnt to hate. Yes! She hated him for his treason
    to C&aelig;sar, for his allegiance to that rebel from Galilee; she hated
    every word which he had spoken in that arrogant, masterful way of his, when
    he smiled upon her threats and calmly spoke of immortality. She hated the
    voice which perpetually rang in her ear, the voice with which he spoke of
    his own soul being in the keeping of God&mdash;of One Whose Empire is mightier
    than that of Rome.</p>
  <p>Yet vaguely still&mdash;for she was but a girl&mdash;the woman in her was
    stirred; the power and desire which exists in every woman&rsquo;s soul to
    conquer that which seems furthest from her reach. She hated the man, and
    yet within her inmost heart there had sprung the desire to curb and possess
    his; to disturb the perfect serenity that dwelt in his deep-set eyes, to
    kindle in them a passion which would make of that proud spirit a mere slave
    to her will.</p>
  <p>There was in her just now nothing but the pagan desire to rule, and to break
    a heart if need be, if she could not otherwise subdue it.</p>
  <p>Memory had fanned her wrath. She saw him now as she had seen him yesterday,
    arrogantly thwarting her will, his bitter tongue lashing her with irony;
    and now, as yesterday, the blush of humiliation burned her cheeks, and her
    pride and dignity rose up in passionate revolt against the one man who had
    ever defied her and who had proudly proclaimed his allegiance to a man who
    was not the C&aelig;sar.</p>
  <p>That allegiance belonged to C&aelig;sar and to his might alone; beyond that
    there was the House of C&aelig;sar, and failing that, nothing but rebellious
    treachery. And the troubled look grew deeper in Dea Flavia&rsquo;s face,
    and now she buried her hot cheeks in her hands, for the humiliation which
    she had endured yesterday from one man seemed to shame her even now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break thy will,&rdquo; she murmured, whilst angry tears
    rose, burning, to her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shame thy manhood and never
    rest until I see thee crawling&mdash;an abject slave&mdash;at the feet of
    C&aelig;sar, who shall kick thee in the face. C&aelig;sar and the House of
    C&aelig;sar brook no rivalry in the heart of a Roman patrician.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her hands dropped from before her face. She threw back her head, and looked
    straight before her into the darkest corner of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth, he called thee!&rdquo; she said slowly and as
    if speaking to an invisible presence. &ldquo;And he said at thy call he would
    give up the world, and suffer death and torture and shame for thee!... Then
    so be it! And I do defy thee, O man of Galilee! even I, Dea Flavia Augusta,
    of the imperial House of C&aelig;sar! For that man whom I hate and despise,
    for that man who has defied and shamed me, for that man whose heart and allegiance
    thou hast filched from C&aelig;sar, for him will I do thee battle ... and
    that heart will I conquer; and it shall be C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s and mine&mdash;mine&mdash;for
    I will break it and crush it first and then wrest it from thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And even as she spoke, from far away over the hills and beyond the Campania
    the thunder rolled dully in response.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like
    him.&rdquo;&mdash;Job 40. 9.</p>
  <p>A few moments later Licinia came running back into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Augusta!&rdquo; she exclaimed excitedly even before she had crossed
    the threshold. &ldquo;Augusta! quick! the C&aelig;sar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia started, for she had indeed been suddenly awakened from a dream.
    Slowly, and with eyes still vague and thoughtful, she turned to her slave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar?&rdquo; she repeated, whilst a puzzled frown appeared
    between her brows and the young blood faded from her cheeks. &ldquo;The C&aelig;sar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said the old woman hurriedly. &ldquo;He is in the atrium
    even now, having just arrived, and his slaves fill the vestibule. He desires
    speech with thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He does not often come at this hour,&rdquo; said Dea Flavia, whose
    face had become very white and set at mention of a name which indeed had
    the power of rousing terror in every heart just now. &ldquo;Doth he seem
    angered?&rdquo; she asked under her breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Licinia reassuringly, &ldquo;how could he be
    angered against thee, my pet lamb? But come quickly, dear, to thy robing
    room; what dress wilt put on to greet the C&aelig;sar in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; she said with a tremulous little laugh, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
    not keep my kinsman waiting. That indeed might anger him. He has been in
    this room before and hath liked to watch me at my work. Let him come now,
    an he wills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Licinia would have protested for she loved to deck her darling out in all
    the finery that, to her mind, rendered the Augusta more beautiful than a
    goddess, but there was no time to say anything for even now the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    voice was heard at the further end of the atrium.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not disturb your mistress. I&rsquo;ll to her myself. Nay! I&rsquo;ll
    not be announced. &rsquo;Tis an informal cousinly visit I am paying her this
    morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He seemeth in good humour,&rdquo; whispered Dea Flavia, whose little
    hands were trembling as they made pretence once more of taking up the modelling
    tools. Licinia hurriedly tried to smooth down the golden hair which had become
    unruly during the course of the morning, but in her haste only succeeded
    in completely disarranging it and it fell in wavy masses down the young girl&rsquo;s
    shoulders, all but one plait which remained fixed over her brow like a wide
    band of gold.</p>
  <p>Dea uttered an exclamation of horror and made a quick gesture, trying to
    capture the recalcitrant curls, even at the very moment that the Emperor
    Caligula entered the room.</p>
  <p>He paused on the threshold and her arms dropped down to her side. Her golden
    hair fell all round her as she bent her knees making obeisance to the C&aelig;sar.
    There was nothing regal about her now, nothing imperious or proud; she looked
    just like a child caught unawares at play.</p>
  <p>Blushing with confusion she advanced toward her kinsman, and with head bent
    received his kiss upon her pure forehead. Nor did she shrink at this loathsome
    contact which would have filled almost any other woman&rsquo;s heart with
    horror. To her this man was not really human&mdash;he was the C&aelig;sar&mdash;a
    supernatural being blessed by the gods, and endowed by them with supreme
    majesty and power.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dismiss thy slaves,&rdquo; he said curtly, &ldquo;I would have speech
    with thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had well schooled his turbulent temper to calmness. After Caius Nepos&rsquo; departure
    and a final outburst of unbridled violence, he had plunged into a cold bath
    and given himself over for half an hour to the ministrations of his slaves.
    Then, cool and refreshed&mdash;at any rate outwardly&mdash;he had dressed
    himself in simple robes, and passing right through the halls of the Palace
    of Tiberius which adjoined his own, he had reached the precincts of Dea Flavia&rsquo;s
    house, which in its turn abutted on that built by Germanicus.</p>
  <p>At any other time but the present one&mdash;when his frenzied mind was wholly
    given over to thoughts of the terrible treachery against his own person&mdash;he
    would have been conscious of Dea Flavia&rsquo;s exquisite beauty, as she
    stood before him, humble with the proud humility of one who has everything
    to give and nothing to receive; chaste with that pure ignorance which refuses
    to know what it cannot condone, and withal a perfect woman, imbued with a
    fascination which no man had ever been able to resist, for it was the fascination
    of youthful loveliness combined with the stately aloofness of conscious power.</p>
  <p>At any other time but this, the unscrupulous voluptuary would have gazed
    on his beautiful kinswoman with eyes that would have shamed her with their
    undisguised admiration, and mayhap his look and actions would have placed
    a severe test on her loyalty and on her respect for him.</p>
  <p>But to-day Caligula only saw in her the tool whom conspirators meant to
    use for their treacherous ends, her loveliness paled in his eyes before the
    awful suspicion which he had of her guilt, and whilst she stood quietly awaiting
    his pleasure, he marvelled how much she knew of the traitors&rsquo; plans
    and whether her white fingers would effectually thrust the dagger into an
    assassin&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>She had dismissed her slaves at his bidding&mdash;all unconscious as she
    was of any danger that might threaten her through him. He waited for a while
    in silence, then he said abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dea Flavia, what is thine age?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked up at him, smiling and puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some twenty years, great C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but
    of a truth I had not kept count.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty years?&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;then &rsquo;tis high time
    that I chose a husband for thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This time she looked up at him boldly, and although in her glance there
    was all the respect due to the immortal C&aelig;sar, yet was there no show
    of humility in her attitude as she threw back the heavy masses of her hair
    and drew up her slender figure to its full stately height.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was it to tell me this,&rdquo; she asked simply, &ldquo;that the
    greatest of C&aelig;sars sought his servant&rsquo;s house to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In part,&rdquo; he rejoined curtly, &ldquo;and I would hear thine
    answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord has not deigned to ask a question?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Art prepared to accept the husband whom I, thine Emperor will choose
    for thee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In all things do I give thee honour and reverence, O C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; she
    replied,  &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I had no thought of marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No thought of marriage!&rdquo; he retorted roughly as, unable to
    sit still, harassed by rage and doubt, he once more started on that restless
    walk of his up and down the room.</p>
  <p>She watched him with great wondering eyes. That something serious lay behind
    his questionings was of course obvious. He had not paid her this matutinal
    visit for the sole purpose of passing the time of day; and she did not like
    this strange mood of his nor his reference to a topic over which he had not
    worried her hitherto.</p>
  <p>In truth the thought of marriage had never entered her head, even though
    Licinia&mdash;with constant garrulousness&mdash;had oft made covert allusions
    to that coming time. She knew&mdash;for it had been instilled into her from
    every side ever since her father had left her under the tutelage of the C&aelig;sar&mdash;that
    she must eventually obey him, if one day he desired that she should marry.</p>
  <p>A young patrician girl would never dream of rebellion against the power
    of a father or a guardian, and when that guardian was the C&aelig;sar himself
    and the girl was of the imperial house, the very thought of disobedience
    savoured of sacrilege.</p>
  <p>But hitherto that question had loomed ahead in Dea Flavia&rsquo;s dreams
    of the future only as very shadowy and vague. She had never given a single
    thought to any of the young men who paid her homage, and their efforts at
    winning her favours had only caused her to smile.</p>
  <p>She had felt herself to be unconquerable, even unattainable, and Caligula,
    before this mad frenzy had fully seized hold of him, had&mdash;in his own
    brutish way&mdash;indulged her in this, allowing her to lead her own life
    and secretly laughing at the machinations that went on around him to obtain
    the most coveted matrimonial prize in Rome.</p>
  <p>Now suddenly this happy state of things was to come to an end; her freedom,
    on which she looked as her most precious possession, was to be taken roughly
    from her. One of the men whom she had despised, one of that set of libertines,
    of idle voluptuaries who had dangled round her skirts whilst casting covetous
    eyes upon her fortune, was to become her master, her supreme lord, and she&mdash;a
    slave to his desires and to his passions.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough the thought of it just now was peculiarly horrible to her&mdash;the
    thought of what the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s wish might mean&mdash;the inevitableness
    of it all nauseated her until she felt sick and faint, and the walls of the
    room began to swing round her so that she had to steady herself on her feet
    with a mighty effort of will, lest she should fall.</p>
  <p>She knew the C&aelig;sar well enough to realise that if he had absolutely
    set his mind on her marriage nothing would make him swerve from the thought.
    If he once desired a thing he would never rest night or day until his wish
    had been fulfilled.</p>
  <p>Men and women of Rome knew that. Patricians and plebs, senators and slaves,
    had died horrible deaths because the C&aelig;sar had demanded and they had
    merely thought to disobey.</p>
  <p>Therefore it was with wide-open, terror-filled eyes that she watched that
    tyrannical master in his restless walk up and down the room.</p>
  <p>Outside greater darkness had gathered, heavy clouds obscured the light,
    and the gorgeous figure of the C&aelig;sar now and then vanished into the
    dark angles of the room, reappearing a moment later like some threatening
    ghoul that comes and goes, blown by the wind which foretells the coming storm.</p>
  <p>After a while Caligula paused in his walk and stood close beside her, looking
    as straight as he could into her pale face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No thought of marriage?&rdquo; he repeated, with one of his mirthless
    laughs,  &ldquo;no thought, mayhap, of the husband whom I would choose for
    thee? No doubt there is even now lurking somewhere in this palace a young
    gallant who alone has the right to aspire to Dea Flavia&rsquo;s grace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord is pleased to jest,&rdquo; she said coolly, &ldquo;and knows
    as well as I do that no patrician can boast of a single favour obtained from
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then &rsquo;tis on a slave thou hast chosen to smile,&rdquo; he said
    roughly.</p>
  <p>Then as she did not deign to make reply to this insult, he continued:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come! Art mute that thou dost not speak when C&aelig;sar commands?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does my lord wish me to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hast a lover, girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou liest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did I deceive my lord in this, then had I not the courage to look
    boldly in the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he said with a snarl, &ldquo;I mistrust that maidenly
    reserve which men call pride, and I, clever coquetry. The women of Rome have
    realised, fortunately by now, that they are the slaves of their masters,
    to be bought and sold as he directs. The wife must learn that she is the
    slave of her husband, the daughter that she belongs to the father; the women
    of the House of C&aelig;sar that they belong to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a hard lesson my lord would teach to one half of his subjects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he said with brutal cynicism, &ldquo;but I like teaching
    it. I hope to live long enough&mdash;nay! I mean to live long enough&mdash;to
    establish a marriage market in Rome, where the lords of the earth can buy
    what women they want openly, for so many sesterces, as they can their cattle
    and their pigs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She recoiled from the man a little at these words and a blush of shame slowly
    rose to her cheek. But she retorted calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The gods do speak through C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s mouth and he frames
    the laws even as they wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her words flattered his egregious vanity which had even as great, if not
    a greater, hold upon him than his tyrannical temper. He knew that to this
    proud girl he was as a god, and that her respect for his C&aelig;sarship
    made her blind to every one of his faults, but this additional simple testimony
    from her pure lips caused him to relent towards her, and quite instinctively
    made him curb the violent grossness of his tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou speakest truly, O Dea Flavia,&rdquo; he said complacently. &ldquo;The
    gods will, when the time comes, speak through my mouth and make known their
    will through my dictates even as they have done hitherto&mdash;even as they
    do at this moment when I tell thee that I desire to see thee married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord hath spoken,&rdquo; she said calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not think, O Dea Flavia,&rdquo; he continued, carried away by
    his own eloquence, &ldquo;that I desire aught but thy happiness. If I decide
    to give thee for wife to a man, it shall only be to one who is worthy of
    thee in every respect. Thou shalt help me to choose him ... for I have not
    yet made my choice ... he shall testify before thee as to his nobility and
    his bravery.... An thou dost assure me that thou hast not yet bestowed thy
    regard on any man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused midway in his phrase with indrawn breath, waiting for her reply.
    She gave it firmly and without hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have cast my eyes on no man, my lord, and have no desire to marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldst consecrate thy virginity to Vesta then?&rdquo; he asked with
    a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather that,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;if my lord would so deign
    to command.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; he broke in impatiently. &ldquo;Herein thou dost offend
    the gods and me! &rsquo;Tis impious to waste thy beauty in barren singleness;
    the gods hate the solitary maid unless she be ill-favoured and unpleasing
    to every man. Thou of the House of C&aelig;sar hast a mission to fulfil and
    canst not fulfil it thus in isolation, fashioning clay figures that have
    no life which they can consecrate to C&aelig;sar. But have no fear, for I,
    thy lord, do watch over thy future&mdash;the man whom I will choose for thee
    will be worthy of thy smiles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drew up his misshapen figure to its full height and beamed at the young
    girl with an expression of paternal benignness. He was delighted with himself,
    delighted with his own oratory. He was such a born mountebank that he could
    even act the part of kindness and benevolence, and he acted it at this moment
    so realistically that the ignorant, confiding girl was taken in by his tricks.</p>
  <p>She saw the gracious smile and was too inexperienced, too devoted, to see
    the hideous leer that he was at pains to conceal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The choice will be difficult, gracious lord,&rdquo; she said, feeling
    somewhat reassured, &ldquo;and will take some time to make.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Therefore will I trust to inspiration,&rdquo; he rejoined blandly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The gods no doubt will speak when the time comes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! They will thunder forth their decree at midday to-morrow,&rdquo; said
    Caligula, with well-assumed majesty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow, O my lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast said it. I have a fancy to make known my decree in this
    matter during the games at the Circus to-morrow. So put on thy richest gown,
    O Dea Flavia Augusta,&rdquo; he added with a sneer, &ldquo;so as to appear
    pleasing in thy future husband&rsquo;s sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My gracious lord is pleased to jest,&rdquo; she said, all her fears
    returning to her in a moment with an overwhelming rush that made her sick
    with horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jest!&rdquo; he retorted with a snarl, showing his yellow teeth like
    a hyena on the prowl, &ldquo;nay! I never was so earnest in my life. Is not
    the future of my beloved ward of supreme importance to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, then, good my lord,&rdquo; she pleaded earnestly, her young
    voice trembling, her blue eyes fixed appealingly on the callous wretch, &ldquo;I
    do beg of thy mightiness to give me time ... to think ... to ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have done all the thinking,&rdquo; he broke in roughly, &ldquo;thou
    hast but to obey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, indeed,&rdquo; she entreated, &ldquo;I have no wish to disobey
    ... but my gracious lord ... do I pray thee deign to consider ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, wench!&rdquo; he shouted, with a violent oath, for what
    he deemed her resistance was exasperating his fury and reawakened all his
    former suspicions of her guilt. &ldquo;Cease thy senseless whining.... I,
    thine Emperor, have spoken. Let that suffice. Who art thou that I should
    parley with thee? To-morrow thou&rsquo;lt go to the Circus. Dost hear? And
    until then remain on thy knees praying to the gods to pardon thy rebellion
    against C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with an air which he strove to render majestic he turned on his heel
    and prepared to go. But in a moment she was down on her knees, her hands
    clutching his robe. She would not let him go, not now, not yet, whilst she
    had not exhausted every prayer, every argument, that would soften his heart
    towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My gracious lord,&rdquo; she pleaded, whilst her trembling voice
    was almost choked with sobs, &ldquo;for pity&rsquo;s sake do hear me! I am
    not rebellious, nor disobedient to thy will! I am only a humble maid who
    holds all her happiness from thee! My gracious lord thou art great, and thou
    art mighty, thou art kind and just. Have mercy on me, for my whole heart
    is brimming over with loyalty for thee! I am free, and am happy in my freedom;
    the men who fawn round me, coveting my fortune, fill me with disgust. I could
    not honour one of them, my lord! I could not give one of them my love. Thou
    who art so great, must know how I feel. I implore thee leave me my freedom,
    the most precious boon which I possess, and my lips will sing a p&aelig;an
    of praise to thee for as long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Caligula was not the man whom a woman&rsquo;s entreaties would turn
    from his purpose, more especially when that purpose was his own self-interest.
    This wretch had no heart within him, no sensibility, not one single feeling
    of pity or of loyalty.</p>
  <p>His instinct must have told him that Dea Flavia was loyal to the core, loyal
    to the C&aelig;sar and to his House, but so blinded was he by rage and humiliation
    and by the terror of assassination, that he saw in the earnest, simple pleadings
    of a young girl and devoted partisan nothing but the obstinate resistance
    of a would-be traitor.</p>
  <p>The more did Dea plead, the more did he become convinced that already her
    choice of a husband was made, and that that husband was destined to wrench
    the sceptre of C&aelig;sar from him and to mount C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s throne
    over his murdered body. With a brutal gesture he pushed the young girl from
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; he shouted, as soon as choking rage enabled him to
    speak.  &ldquo;Silence, I say! ere I strike thee into eternal dumbness. What
    I have said, I&rsquo;ve said. Dost hear me? To-morrow, at the Circus, I will
    name thy husband, and then and there thou shalt accept him, whoever he may
    be. I have a reason for wishing this&mdash;a reason of State far beyond the
    comprehension of a mere fool. To-morrow thou shalt accept the man of my choice
    as thy future lord. That is my will. Look to it, O daughter of C&aelig;sar,
    that thou dost obey. C&aelig;sar hath spoken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;C&aelig;sar hath spoken,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;but my gracious
    lord will relent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost know me, girl?&rdquo; he retorted, as, bending down to her,
    he seized her wrists in his and brought his flushed face all distorted by
    fury, close to her own. &ldquo;Dost know me? For if so hast ever seen me
    relent once I have set my will? Look into my eyes now! Look, I say!&rdquo; he
    shouted hoarsely, giving her wrists and arms a brutal wrench. &ldquo;Do they
    look as if they meant to relent? Is there anything in my face to lead thee
    to hope that thou wouldst have thy treacherous way with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held her wrists so cruelly that she could have screamed with the pain,
    but she bit her lip to still the cry.</p>
  <p>Daylight now was yielding to the oncoming storm. Dense shadows hung all
    round the room, making the objects in it seem weird and ghost-like in the
    gloom. Sudden gusts of wind swept angrily round, causing the withered leaves
    and dying flowers in the vases to murmur with unearthly sounds, as of the
    sighing of disembodied souls. Only through the aperture above a streak of
    greyish light struck full upon the C&aelig;sar, as, with glowing eyes and
    cruel grasp, he compelled her to look on him.</p>
  <p>For a moment she closed her eyes after she had looked, for never before
    had she seen anything so hideous and so evil. His misshapen head looked unnaturally
    large as it seemed to loom out at her from out the gathering darkness, his
    hair stood up sparse and harsh all round his forehead. His eyes were protruding
    and shot through with blood; his lips were dry and cracked, his cheeks of
    a dull crimson and heavy sweat was pouring down his face.</p>
  <p>When she turned away from him in horror, he broke into that wild laugh of
    his which had in it the very sounds of hell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said with a leer, &ldquo;hast seen my face? Art still
    prepared to disobey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; she said slowly, and fixing her eyes fully upon
    his now, &ldquo;but I am prepared to die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To die? What senseless talk is this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not senseless, my good lord. Even the gods do allow us poor mortals
    to find refuge from sorrow in death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he said slowly, still gripping her wrists and peering
    into her face till his scorching breath made her feel sick and faint. &ldquo;That
    is the way thou wouldst defy the will of C&aelig;sar? Death, sayest thou?...
    Death and disobedience&mdash;rather than submission to the wish of him who
    has god-like power on earth. Death!&rdquo; and he laughed loudly even whilst
    from afar there came, faint and threatening, the nearer presage of the coming
    storm. &ldquo;What death? A pleasing, dreamless sleep brought on by drugs?
    A soothing draught that lulls even as it kills&mdash;or hadst perchance thought
    of the arena?... of the tiger that roars?... or the lictor&rsquo;s flail
    that drives?... hadst thought ... hadst thought ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was foaming at the mouth, his rage was choking him; he had only just
    enough strength left in him to tear at the neck of his tunic, for the next
    moment he would have fallen, felled like an ox by the power of his own fury.
    But as soon as he had released Dea Flavia&rsquo;s wrists and she felt herself
    free to move, she rose from her knees, and with quick, almost mechanical
    gesture, she rearranged her disordered robe and shook back the heavy masses
    of her hair. Then she stood quite still, with arms hanging by her side, her
    head quite erect and her eyes fixed upon that raving monster. When she saw
    that he had at last regained some semblance of reason she said quite calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My gracious lord will work his way with his slave, and deal her what
    death he desires.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he murmured incoherently, &ldquo;what didst thou say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis death I choose, my lord,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;rather
    than a husband who was not of mine own seeking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment then she did look death straight and calmly in the face, for
    it was death that looked on her through those blood-shot eyes. He had thrust
    his lower jaw forward, his teeth, large and yellow, looked like the fangs
    of a wolf; stertorous breathing escaped his nostrils, and his distorted fingers
    were working convulsively, like the claws of a beast when it sees its prey.</p>
  <p>Caligula would have strangled her then and there without compunction and
    without remorse. She had defied him and thwarted him even more completely
    than she knew herself; and there was no death so cruel that he would not
    gladly have inflicted upon her then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost dare to defy me...!&rdquo; he murmured hoarsely, &ldquo;hast
    heard what I threatened ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She put out her hand, quietly interrupting him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard the threat, my lord ... and have no fear,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No fear of death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None, gracious lord. There is no yoke so heavy as a bond unhallowed.
    No death so cruel as the breaking of a heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was dead silence in the room now; only from a far distant rolls of
    ceaseless thunder sent their angry echo through the oppressive air. Caligula
    was staring at the girl as he would on some unearthly shape. Gasping he had
    fallen back a few steps, the convulsive twitching of his fingers ceased,
    his mouth closed with a snap, and great yellow patches appeared upon his
    purple cheeks.</p>
  <p>Then he slowly passed his hand across his streaming forehead, his breathing
    became slower and more quiet, the heavy lids fell over the protruding eyes.</p>
  <p>Caius Julius C&aelig;sar Caligula was no fool. His perceptions, in fact,
    became remarkably acute where his own interests were at stake, and he had
    the power of curbing that demoniacal temper of his, even in its maddest moment,
    if self-advantage suddenly demanded it.</p>
  <p>He had formed a plan in his head for the trapping of the unknown man who
    was to mount the throne of C&aelig;sar over the murdered body of his Emperor.
    Before dealing with the whole band of traitors he wished to know who it was
    that meant to reap the greatest benefit by the dastardly conspiracy. There
    was one man alive in Rome at the present moment who thought to become the
    successor of Caligula; that one man would be bold enough to woo and win Dea
    Flavia for wife.</p>
  <p>Caligula&rsquo;s one coherent thought ever since Caius Nepos had betrayed
    the conspiracy to him, was the desire to know who that man was likely to
    be. That was the man he most hated&mdash;the unknown man. Him he desired
    to punish in a manner that would make all the others endure agonies of horror
    ere they in turn met their doom. But his identity was still a mystery. To
    discover it, the C&aelig;sar had need of the help of this girl who stood
    there so calmly before him, defying his power and his threats. He looked
    on her and understanding slowly came to him ... understanding of the woman
    with whom he had to deal. It dawned upon him in the midst of his tumultuous
    frenzy that here he had encountered a will that he could never bend to his
    own&mdash;an irresistible force had come in contact with an unbending one.
    One of the two must yield, and Caligula, staring at the young girl who seemed
    so fragile that a touch of the hand must break her, knew that it was not
    she who would ever give in.</p>
  <p>His well-matured plan he would not give up. He had thought it all out whilst
    he refreshed himself in his bath after Caius Nepos&rsquo; visit, and it was
    not likely that any woman could, by her obstinate action, move Caligula from
    his resolve. But obviously he must alter his tactics if he desired Dea Flavia&rsquo;s
    help. He could gain nothing by her death save momentary satisfaction, and
    the matter was too important to allow momentary satisfaction to interfere
    with the delights of future complete revenge.</p>
  <p>Therefore he forced himself to some semblance of calm. He was a perfect
    mountebank, a consummate actor, and now he called to his aid his full powers
    of deception. Cunning should win the day since rage and coercion had failed.</p>
  <p>Slowly his face lost every vestige of anger and sorrowful serenity crept
    into his eyes. Tottering like one who feels unmanned, he sought the support
    of a chair and fell sitting into it, with his elbows on his knees and his
    head buried in his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Woe is me!&rdquo; he moaned, &ldquo;woe to the House of C&aelig;sar
    when its fairest daughter turns traitor against her kin!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I! a traitor, good my lord!&rdquo; she rejoined quietly. &rdquo;There
    is no treachery in my desire to serve C&aelig;sar in single maidenhood, or
    to offer thee my life rather than my freedom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is black treachery,&rdquo; he said with tremulous voice like
    one in deep sorrow, &ldquo;in refusing to obey the C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In this alone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But it was his turn now to interrupt her with a quick raising of the hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! That is what the waverer says: &lsquo;Good my lord, I&rsquo;ll
    obey in all save in what doth not please me!&rsquo; Dea Flavia Augusta, I
    had thought thee above such monstrous selfishness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Selfishness, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! Art thou not of the House of C&aelig;sar? Art thou not my kinswoman?
    Dost thou not receive at my hands honour, position, everything that places
    thee above the common herd of humanity? Were I not the C&aelig;sar, where
    wouldst thou be? Not in this palace surely, not the virtual queen of Rome,
    but, mayhap, a handmaid to another C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s wife, an attendant
    on his daughter.... Thou dost seem to have forgot all this, Augusta.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, gracious lord, I have forgot nothing! Your goodness to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet wouldst deliver me over into the hands of mine enemies,&rdquo; he
    said with increased dolefulness, &ldquo;and not raise a finger to save me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would give my life for the C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; she interposed firmly, &ldquo;and
    this the C&aelig;sar knows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldst not even take a husband, when by so doing thou wouldst save
    the C&aelig;sar from death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My gracious lord speaks in riddles ... I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didst not understand, girl, that I but wished to test thy loyalty
    to me? Thou&mdash;like so many alas!&mdash;dost so oft prate of unbounded
    attachment to C&aelig;sar. To-day, for the first time, did I put that attachment
    to the test, and lo! it hath failed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try me, my lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll not fail
    thee. But give me thy trust as well as thy commands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She advanced close to where he sat, apparently a broken-down, sorrowful
    man, stricken with grief. The mighty C&aelig;sar now was far more powerful
    than he had been a while ago when he raged and stormed and threatened, for
    he had appealed to the strongest feeling within her&mdash;he had appealed
    to her loyalty.</p>
  <p>Slowly she sank once more on her knees, not in entreaty now, not with thoughts
    of self, but in the humble subjection of herself to the needs of him whom
    the gods had anointed. She sank upon her knees, and with that simple action
    she offered her happiness on the altar of her loyalty to him and to her house.</p>
  <p>Gone was the look of defiance from her eyes, the pride had vanished and
    all the joy of life; no thought was left in the young mind now save an overwhelming
    sense of loyalty, no feeling lingered in the heart save the desire for self-sacrifice.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar had commanded and since she could not disobey she was ready
    to die; memory had in a swift flash called up before her the vision of a
    man who, rather than yield to her caprice, had smiled at the thought of death.
    And she, too, had almost smiled, for suddenly she had understood how small
    a thing was life when slavery became its price.</p>
  <p>But now all that had changed. The C&aelig;sar pleaded and made appeal to
    her loyalty. Her refusal to obey him was no longer pride, it was disloyalty&mdash;almost
    sacrilege. The C&aelig;sar called to her! It was as if the gods had spoken,
    and she fell on her knees, ready to obey.</p>
  <p>The consummate actor was clever enough to hide the triumph that lit up his
    eyes when he saw her thus kneeling, and understood that she was prepared
    to yield.</p>
  <p>He stretched out a paternal hand, and with weary sadness stroked her golden
    hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trust me, gracious lord,&rdquo; she reiterated, &ldquo;my life is
    thine, do with it what thou wilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Traitors are at work, Dea Flavia, to murder the C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; he
    said gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye gods!&rdquo; she murmured, horrified.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! wouldst think mayhap that the gods will interfere? They will?
    I tell thee that they will! but they have need of thee, Augusta! I, thy C&aelig;sar,
    thy god do have need of thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With both hands now he took her own in his, not roughly, but with infinite
    tenderness, and cunningly contrived that two hot tears should fall upon her
    fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My gracious lord!&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;my life is at thy
    service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Accept the husband whom I propose for thee ... and my life will be
    safe.... Refuse to obey me in this and to-morrow the blood of C&aelig;sar
    will be upon thy head....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wilt obey me, Augusta?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My gracious lord ... I do not understand,&rdquo; she pleaded; &ldquo;have
    pity on my ignorance ... trust me but a little further....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot tell thee more,&rdquo; he said with a sigh of patient weariness,  &ldquo;but
    this I do tell thee, that my life and with it the future of our House&mdash;of
    the Empire&mdash;now lie in thy hands. The abominable traitors would make
    a tool even of thee.  &lsquo;The husband of Dea Flavia Augusta,&rsquo; they
    say, &lsquo;shall succeed the murdered C&aelig;sar!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>She uttered a cry of horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Their names,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;tell me their names.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know but a few.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They speak of Hortensius Martius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And of young Escanes ... also of Philario, my servant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye gods,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;let your judgments fall upon
    them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And of Taurus Antinor&mdash;the praefect of Rome,&rdquo; added the
    C&aelig;sar, and a savage snarl escaped his lips even when he spoke the name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Taurus Antinor!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>Then half-audibly she murmured to herself, repeating the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They would make a tool of thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had fallen back, squatting on her heels, her hands clasped before her
    and her head sunk upon her bosom, bowed with shame and with horror. Her name
    had been bandied about by traitors, her person been bought and sold as the
    price of the blackest sacrilege that had ever disgraced the patriciate of
    Rome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And thou, Taurus Antinor,&rdquo; she whispered inaudibly, &ldquo;art
    the blackest traitor amongst them all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no need now for the C&aelig;sar to make further appeal to her
    loyalty. She was loyal to him&mdash;body and soul&mdash;loyal to him and
    to her House, ready to sacrifice her pride, her freedom if need be at a word
    from the C&aelig;sar, since he had said that by her action on the morrow
    she could help him fight the treacherous infamy.</p>
  <p>Caligula could well be satisfied with his success; nor did he try to press
    his advantage further. All that he had wanted was the assurance that she
    would not thwart him when he put into execution the plan which he had conceived.
    The man-trap which he had set would not now fail through Dea&rsquo;s obstinacy.</p>
  <p>He thought that the time had come for ending the interview. He desired that
    her receptive mind should retain a solemn impression of his majesty and of
    his power. A charlatan to the last, he now rose to his feet and with outstretched
    arm pointed upwards to the small glimpse of leaden-covered sky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jove&rsquo;s thunders still speak from afar,&rdquo; he said with
    slow emphasis,  &ldquo;but to-morrow they will crash over Rome and over the
    traitors within her walls. The air will be filled with moanings and with
    gnashing of teeth; the Tiber will run red with blood, for the murdered C&aelig;sar
    will mayhap be crying vengeance upon the assassins. Wilt save the C&aelig;sar,
    O Dea Flavia? Wilt save Rome and the Empire from a deadly crime and the devastating
    vengeance of the outraged gods?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He towered above her like some inspired prophet, with arms stretched out
    towards the fast approaching storm, and eyes uplifted to the thunderbolts
    of Jove.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I await thine answer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;O daughter of the C&aelig;sars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My answer has been given, gracious lord,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;have
    I not said that my life was at thy service?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;lt obey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Command, O C&aelig;sar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow at the Circus ... dost understand?... I have a plan ...
    and thou must obey ... blindly ... dost understand?&rdquo; he reiterated
    hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll name thy future husband to the public ... to the plebs
    ... to all ... and thou&rsquo;lt accept him&mdash;before them all&mdash;without
    demur....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As my lord commands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This thou dost swear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This do I swear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the mountebank with mock reverence as he placed
    his hand&mdash;blood-stained with the blood of countless innocent victims
    of his tyranny&mdash;upon the bowed head of the loyal girl, &ldquo;receive
    the blessing of Jupiter the victorious, of Juno the holy goddess, and of
    Magna Mater the great Mother, for thou art worthy to be of the House of C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But even as the last of these impious words had left his lips, the long
    awaited storm broke out in sudden fury; a vivid flash of lightning rent the
    sky from end to end and lit up momentarily every corner of the room, the
    kneeling figure of Dea Flavia, the misshapen figure of the imperial monster,
    the fading flowers in the vases. Then a mighty clap of thunder shook the
    very foundations of Dea Flavia&rsquo;s palace.</p>
  <p>Caligula uttered a wild shriek of terror, and, calling loudly for his slaves,
    he fled incontinently from the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour
    to a fool.&rdquo;&mdash;Proverbs 26. 8.</p>
  <p>From the hour of midnight the streets and ways leading to the great Amphitheatre
    were alive with people, all tending toward the same goal: men and women in
    holiday clothes and little children running beside them. The men were heavily
    loaded with baskets of rush or bags of rough linen containing provisions,
    for many hours would be spent up there waiting for amusement, whilst the
    body would grow faint if food were not forthcoming.</p>
  <p>So the men carried the provisions which the women had prepared the day before&mdash;eggs
    and cooked fish and such fruit as was cheap this season. And everybody was
    running, for though the Amphitheatre was vast and could hold&mdash;so &lsquo;twas
    said&mdash;over two hundred thousand people, yet considerably more than two
    hundred thousand people desired to be present at the opening of the games.</p>
  <p>They were to last thirty-one days and spectacles would be varied and exciting.
    But the great day would be the opening day, the one on which everybody desired
    to be inside the Amphitheatre if possible and not outside.</p>
  <p>Therefore an early start had to be made. But this nobody minded, as what
    is the want of a little sleep compared with the likelihood of missing the
    finest sight that had been witnessed in the city for years?</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar, of course, would be present. He would solemnly declare
    the games to be open. There were free gifts from him to the people: a thank-offering
    to the gods for his safe return from that arduous expedition in Germany;
    and he would show himself to his people, receive their acclamations and give
    them as much show and gaiety, music and combats, as they cared to see.</p>
  <p>So they went in their thousands and their tens of thousands, starting in
    the middle of the night so as to be there when the great gates were opened,
    and they would be allowed to pour into the vast enclosure, and find as good
    seats for themselves and their families as they could.</p>
  <p>And when at dawn, the great copper gates did slowly swing open, creaking
    upon their massive hinges, it was as if the flood-gates of a mighty sea had
    been suddenly let loose. In they poured, thousands upon thousands of them,
    scrambling, pushing and jumping, scurrying and hurrying, falling and tumbling,
    as they pressed onwards through the wide doors and then dispersed in the
    vastness of the gigantic arena, like ants that scamper away to their heaps.</p>
  <p>Like so many pygmies they looked now, fussy and excited, perspiring profusely
    despite the cool breeze of this early dawn.</p>
  <p>Give them half an hour and they&rsquo;ll all settle down, sitting row upon
    row, tier upon tier of panting, expectant humanity. After much bousculading
    the strong ones have got to the front rows, the weaker ones up aloft in the
    rear. But all can see well into the arena, and there are those who think
    that you get a better view if you sit more aloft; certain it is that you
    get purer air and something of the shadow of the encircling walls.</p>
  <p>There is no sign of cloud or storm to-day. Jove&rsquo;s thunders spent themselves
    during the morning hours of yesterday when clap upon clap, awe-inspiring
    and deafening, made every superstitious heart quake with terror at this possible
    augury of some coming disaster. To-day the sky is clear and&mdash;soon after
    dawn&mdash;of that iridescent crystalline blue that lures the eye into myriads
    and myriads of atoms, the creations of the heat-laden ether that stretches
    away&mdash;far away to the infinite distance beyond.</p>
  <p>The beauty of the late summer&rsquo;s day was accepted as a matter of course:
    as part and parcel of the holidays and festivals ordered by the C&aelig;sar.
    These too were the people&rsquo;s just dues: emperors had to justify their
    existence by entertaining their people. Grumblings at their luxury and extravagances
    were only withheld because of other luxuries and extravagances perpetrated
    for the amusement of the people.</p>
  <p>And from early dawn there was plenty to see. Even though you did not watch
    the citron-coloured sky overhead as it slowly changed its diaphanous draperies
    for others that were rose, then crimson, and then gold, finally casting off
    these two, and showing its blue magnificence unadorned. There were the soldiers
    on guard at the doors, their yellow helmets shining in the sun, their naked
    legs bronzed below their tunics. There were the late-comers to watch, those
    who had not cared for a midnight vigil and were arriving late, like lazy
    ants creeping to their heaps, finding all places occupied, running hither
    and thither in search of an empty place.</p>
  <p>Then, on the north side there were the tribunals of the senators, the patricians,
    and the knights, with&mdash;in the centre&mdash;gorgeous with purple draperies
    and standards&mdash;that which the C&aelig;sar would occupy. Rich stuffs
    covered with gold embroideries fell over the edge of these tribunes and fluttered
    lazily in the morning breeze; chairs and cushions were disposed there, and
    it was interesting to make vague guesses as to who would occupy them.</p>
  <p>The Emperor&rsquo;s tribune was decorated with flowers: huge bunches of
    lilies in pots of earthenware and crimson roses trailed in festoons overhead.
    There was no doubt that the Augusta Dea Flavia would be present then, lilies
    were her favourite flowers, they were always to be seen wherever she appeared.</p>
  <p>The tribunes of the rich were so disposed that the sun would never shed
    an unpleasant glare into them, and over that part of the Amphitheatre an
    awning of white and purple striped stuff threw a pleasing and restful shadow.</p>
  <p>Soon after the second hour the spectacle began. Processions of men and beasts
    who would take part in the combats and the shows. The Numidian lions&mdash;in
    heavy iron cages, drawn by eight pack horses&mdash;were snarling as they
    were dragged along, lean and hungry-looking, with bloodshot eyes that threatened,
    and dribbling jaws waiting to devour. The pack of hyenas from the desert,
    a novelty not yet witnessed at the games, the crocodiles from the Nile and
    the wolves from the Thracian forests.</p>
  <p>It was amusing to hear the snarl of the lions and to think of them as they
    would appear anon pitted one against the other, or engaged in deadly combat
    against the crocodiles. But still more exciting would it be when the prisoners
    of war, lately captured in Germany, would have to try their heavy fists against
    the masters of the desert.</p>
  <p>The procession of the beasts had lasted close upon an hour. The public waxed
    impatient. Beasts were well enough, but their prey was what the people desired
    to see. Women clamoured as loudly as the men. Children stood up upon the
    benches to catch sight of the prisoners, the malefactors, the rebellious
    slaves who would furnish the sport later on.</p>
  <p>Presently they began to arrive and were greeted with loud acclamations&mdash;trembling,
    miserable bundles of humanity with hideous death staring at them all round,
    the pungent odour of wild beasts stinking of death, the glowering eyes of
    an excited populace testifying that no mercy would be shown.</p>
  <p>The slaves mostly looked the prey of abject terror, backboneless, and with
    the cold sweat already pouring from their huddled-up bodies; they were men
    caught in the act of murder or of theft, confirmed malefactors most of them,
    now condemned to the arena to expiate their crimes and afford a holiday for
    the people.</p>
  <p>Some of the most hardened criminals had been dressed up to look like the
    German rebels whom the Emperor was supposed lately to have vanquished, with
    tow-coloured wigs and coverings of goatskin around their torso: they were
    marched round the gigantic arena, with clanging chains on their wrists and
    ankles.</p>
  <p>The public was delighted at their appearance. It confirmed the prowess of
    the C&aelig;sar, for the men had been selected for this special exhibition
    because of their height or the breadth of their shoulders. Everyone was curious
    to see them, and howls of execration greeted them as they passed. It was
    felt that they deserved far more severe punishment than was meted to ordinary
    criminals. They had rebelled against the might of C&aelig;sar, and in a manner
    had made attempt against his sacred life.</p>
  <p>But the most interesting part of this early morning show was undoubtedly
    the black panther whom the native prince of Numidia had sent as a tribute
    to the imperator. Wild rumours as to its cunning and its ferocity had been
    in circulation for some time, but no one had ever seen it; it had been kept
    closely guarded and heavily chained in the gardens of the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    palace, and since its arrival from the desert was said to have grown to fabulous
    size and strength.</p>
  <p>Its inclusion in the spectacle of to-day had come as an exciting surprise,
    for it was known that the C&aelig;sar thought a great deal of the beast,
    going out daily to watch it through its iron bars, and delighting in its
    ferocity and cruel rapaciousness. He had caused a special house to be built
    for it in a secluded portion of his garden, with a swimming-bath carved out
    of a solid block of African marble. Its feeding trough was made of gold,
    and capons and pea-hens were specially fattened for its delectation.</p>
  <p>Many were the tales current about the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s fondness for the
    creature and his pleasure in seeing it fed with live animals, which he would
    himself throw into the cage. It was even said he had fed the brute with human
    flesh, the flesh of slaves who had disobeyed or merely offended him: one
    of his chief amusements being to force one of these unfortunate wretches
    to thrust an arm into the cage, and then to watch the panther as it scrunched
    the human bones, and licked the human blood whilst cries of unspeakable horror
    and agony rent the air with their hideous sounds.</p>
  <p>And now&mdash;in order to delight his people&mdash;the greatest and best
    of C&aelig;sars would grant them the spectacle of his most precious pet.
    Loud clapping of hands and thunderous shouts of applause greeted the entrance
    of the magnificent cage which was drawn out into the arena by sixteen negro
    slaves. The bars of the cage were gilded, and it was surmounted by the imperial
    standard and the insignia of imperial rank. Its pedestal was of carved wood
    and mounted on massive wheels of steel. In the front were four heavy chains
    of steel, and to these the sixteen negroes were harnessed. They were naked
    save for a loin-cloth of scarlet cloth, and on their heads were fillets of
    shining metal, each adorned with five long ostrich feathers which had been
    dipped in brilliant scarlet dye.</p>
  <p>The weight of the cage, with its solid pedestal and heavy iron bars, must
    have been terrific, for the sixteen powerful Africans strained on the chains
    as they walked, burying their feet in the sand of the arena, their backs
    bent, the muscles of their shoulders and arms standing out like living cords.
    In a corner of the cage cowered the powerful creature, its broad, snake-like
    head thrust forward, its tiny golden eyes fixed before it, a curious snarl&mdash;like
    a grin&mdash;now and then contorted the immobility of its powerful jaws.
    The sinewy tail beat a restless tattoo on the floor of the cage.</p>
  <p>Now and then when a jerk on the uneven ground disturbed it from its ominous
    quietude, the brute would jump up suddenly&mdash;quick as the lightning flash&mdash;and
    bound right across the cage, striking out with its huge black paw to where
    one of the rearmost negro&rsquo;s back appeared temptingly near.</p>
  <p>The cunning precision with which that paw hit out exactly between two iron
    bars highly pleased the public, and once when the mighty claws did reach
    a back and tore it open from the shoulder to the waist, a wild shout of delight,
    echoed and re-echoed by thousands upon thousands of throats, shook the very
    walls of the gigantic Amphitheatre. Children screamed with pleasure, the
    women applauded rapturously, the men shouted &ldquo;Habet! habet!&rdquo; He
    has it! The unfortunate slave, who, giddy with the loss of blood, rolled
    inanimate beneath the wheels of the cage.</p>
  <p>It was at this moment, when the excited populace went nearly wild with delight,
    that a loud fanfare of brass trumpets announced the approach of the C&aelig;sar.</p>
  <p>He entered his tribune preceded by an escort of his praetorian guard with
    flying standards. At sight of him the huge audience rose to its feet like
    one man and cheered him to the echoes, cheered him with just the same shouts
    as those with which, a few moments ago, it had acclaimed the ferocious prowess
    of the panther, cheered him with the same shouts with which it would have
    hailed his death, his assassination, the proclamation of his successor.</p>
  <p>He was clad in a tunic of purple silk, wrought with the sun, moon and stars
    in threads of gold and silver, and on his chest was the breastplate of Augustus,
    which he had had dug up out of the vault where the great Emperor lay buried.
    On his head was a diadem of jewels in shape like the rays of the sun standing
    out all round his misshapen head, and in his hands he carried a gold thunderbolt,
    emblem of Jove, and a trident emblem of Neptune.</p>
  <p>He was surrounded by his own guard, by a company of knights and a group
    of senators and patricians, and immediately behind him walked his wife, C&aelig;sonia,
    and his uncle, Claudius, the brother of Germanicus.</p>
  <p>He came to the front of the tribune, allowing the populace a full view of
    his grotesque person, and listening with obvious satisfaction to the applause
    and the cheers that still rose in ceaseless echoes upwards to the sky.</p>
  <p>He did not hear the ironical laughter, nor yet the mocking comments on his
    appearance, which was more that of a caricature than of a sentient man. He
    was satisfied that all eyes were turned on himself and on the majestic pomp
    which surrounded him. The standard-bearers were ordered to wave the flags
    so that a cloud of purple and gold seemed to be wafted all round his head,
    and he ordered the Augustas to group themselves around him.</p>
  <p>The people watched this pageant as they had done the earlier spectacles.
    It was all a part of the show stage-managed for their amusement. They were
    interested to see the Augustas, and those who knew mentioned the various
    names to their less fortunate neighbours.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;C&aelig;sonia standeth next her lord. She gave him a love potion
    once, so  &rsquo;tis said, because his passion for her was quickly on the
    wane. And &rsquo;tis that love potion which hath made him crazy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And there are the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s sisters, Drusilla and Livilla.
    Drusilla is very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And there is Julia, the daughter of Drusus. She had been willing
    to step into C&aelig;sonia&rsquo;s shoes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Dea Flavia, daughter of Claudius Octavius, is the most beautiful
    amongst them all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hail to Dea Flavia Augusta!&rdquo; came from more than one enthusiastic
    throat.</p>
  <p>She was clad all in white, with strings of pearls round her neck and a fillet
    of diamonds in her golden hair. Her face was very pale and her lips never
    smiled. In her hands she held three tall sprays of lilies scarce whiter than
    the smooth surface of her brow.</p>
  <p>Everyone noticed that the C&aelig;sar specially commanded her to sit on
    his left, C&aelig;sonia being on his right, and that the Augustas all frowned
    with dissatisfaction at this signal honour paid to Dea Flavia.</p>
  <p>Anon Caius Nepos, the praetorian praefect, came to the front of the tribune,
    and in stentorian voice commanded everyone to kneel. All those in the tribune
    did kneel immediately, the guard holding the standards, the senators and
    the knights. The Augustas all knelt too, and the patricians in the tribunes
    to right and left. Some of the people knelt, but not by any means all, and
    Caius Nepos had to repeat his command three or four times, and to threaten
    the immediate dispersal of the audience and the clearing of the Amphitheatre
    before everyone at last obeyed.</p>
  <p>Caligula alone remained standing, and not far from him the praefect of Rome
    leaning against the partition wall.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar then blessed his people, and at the word of Caius Nepos&mdash;the
    praetorian praefect&mdash;cries of &ldquo;Hail C&aelig;sar! Hail, O God!
    Hail the Father of the Armies! the greatest and best of C&aelig;sars!&rdquo; broke
    out on every side.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of
    the beast that goeth downward to the earth.&rdquo;&mdash;Ecclesiastes 3.
    21.</p>
  <p>Caius Julius C&aelig;sar Caligula was in excellent spirits, smiling and
    nodding to those around him and to his people all the time. His face certainly
    looked sallow and his eyes were bloodshot, but this may have been due to
    ill-health, for without doubt his temper was of the best. Only once had he
    frowned, when, looking behind him, he saw that the praefect of Rome had remained
    standing when everyone knelt to acclaim the C&aelig;sar.</p>
  <p>But even then the frown was quickly dissipated and he spoke quite pleasantly
    to the praefect later on. The Augustas grouped around him were continually
    laughing as he turned to them from time to time with a witty sally, or probably
    with what was more in keeping with his character&mdash;a coarse jest. And
    he watched the spectacle attentively from end to end. Firstly the play in
    verse on the subject of the judgment of Paris, a perversion of the legend
    favoured by the Greeks&mdash;a travesty wherein Paris&mdash;renamed Parisia&mdash;was
    a woman, and three gods were in rivalry for the golden apple, the emblem
    of her favours. Then the naval spectacle over the flooded arena, with ships
    and galleys executing complex man&oelig;uvres on waters rendered turbulent
    by cleverly contrived artificial means; then the wrestling and scenes of
    hunting with wolves and boars specially brought from the Thracian forests
    for the occasion.</p>
  <p>He watched the Numidian lions tearing one another to pieces, he exulted
    with the audience over the fight between a pack of hyenas and some crocodiles
    from the Nile. He encouraged the gladiators in their fights, and joined in
    the excitement that grew and grew with every item of a programme which had
    been skilfully arranged so that it began with simple and peaceful shows,
    and gradually became more bloodthirsty and more fierce.</p>
  <p>It seemed as if a cunning mind, alert to the temper of the people, had contrived
    the entertainment so that with every stage of the proceedings something of
    the lustful love of cruelty, inherent in every Roman citizen, would be gradually
    aroused. The hunting scenes were a prelude to the combat between the lions,
    and these again were the forerunners of a more bloody bout between the hyenas
    and the crocodiles.</p>
  <p>At last blood had begun to flow. The audience sniffed its sickening odour
    with a thrill of nostril and brain, and tongues and lips became parched with
    the fever of desire for more.</p>
  <p>The other items&mdash;the play, the naval pageant, the scenes of hunting
    and combat of beasts amongst themselves&mdash;these were only the prologue.
    The real spectacle was at last to commence. For this the Romans thirsted&mdash;patricians
    and plebs alike, rich and poor, man, woman and child. These shows were their
    very life; they constituted the essence of their entire being; for these
    they rose at midnight and stood waiting, hour upon hour, that they might
    be near enough to smell the blood when it reddened the sand of the arena,
    and to see the last throe of agony on the face of those who fell in combat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Habet! Habet! Habet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cry became more insistent and more hoarse. See the men and women leaning
    over the edge of the tribunes, their eyes wide open, their hands outstretched
    with thumb pointing relentlessly the way of death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Habet! Habet!&rdquo; shrieked the women when a prostrate figure lay
    writhing on the ground, and the victor with head erect demanded the final
    verdict.</p>
  <p>And up in the imperial tribune the C&aelig;sar jested and laughed, the standards
    waved above his head, the striped awning threw a cool blue shadow over his
    gorgeous robes and the jewel-crowned heads of the Augustas.</p>
  <p>The rest of the gigantic arena was a blaze of riotous colour now, with the
    mid-morning&rsquo;s sun darting its rays almost perpendicularly on the south
    side of the huge oval place. A sea of heads gold and brown, ruddy and black
    oscillating in unison to right or left like waters driven by the tide, as
    the combatants down below shifted their ground across the floor of the arena&mdash;fans
    of coloured feathers swinging, mantles caught by a passing breeze, every
    grain of sand on the floor of the arena a minute mirror radiating the light,
    everything glowed with an intensity of colour rendered all the more vivid
    by contrast with the dense shadows thrown against the marble walls.</p>
  <p>On the south side every shade of russet and brown and green showed in the
    mantles and the tunics of the plebs, and seemed flecked with vivid gold under
    the light of the sun, whilst in the tribunes of the rich on the opposite
    side cool tones of amethyst and chrysoprase were veiled in tender azure by
    the shadow from the awning above. And at either end, to east and west the
    massive copper portals, like gigantic ruddy mirrors threw back these tones
    of gold and blue as if through a veil of sunset-kissed clouds.</p>
  <p>Above, the sky of a vivid blue, translucent and iridescent with a myriad
    flecks of turquoise and rose and emerald that found their reflections in
    the marble walls of the arena or the shining helmets of the legionaries guarding
    the imperial tribune; and over the whole scene an impalpable veil of gold,
    made of tiny, unseen atoms that danced in the heat, and merged into an exquisite
    glowing harmony the russets and the purples, the emeralds and rubies and
    the trenchant notes of sardonyx and indigo that cut across the orgy of colour
    like a deep, gaping wound.</p>
  <p>And through it all that sense of thrilling expectancy, so keen that it almost
    seemed palpable.</p>
  <p>It vibrated in the air making every cheek glow with a crimson fire and kindling
    a light in every eye. It seemed to set every golden atom dancing, it was
    felt through every breath drawn by two hundred thousand throats.</p>
  <p>Over the Emperor&rsquo;s head the striped awning flapped weirdly in the
    breeze, with strange insistent sound like the knocking of a ghostly hand
    upon the doors of hell.</p>
  <p>Not a few miserable wretches whom the summary justice of the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    own tribunal had condemned to death were exposed to a band of swordsmen&mdash;executioners
    really, since the fight was quite unequal. Huge African giants with short
    naked swords pursuing a few emaciated wretches who ran howling round the
    arena, jumping improvised hurdles, rounding obstacles or crawling under cover,
    running, running with that unreasoning instinct of self-preservation which
    drives even before the certainty of death.</p>
  <p>A hunting scene this, of novel diversion.</p>
  <p>No one cared whether the victims were really guilty of crime, no one cared
    if they had been equitably tried and been justly condemned, all that the
    public cared about was that the spectacle was new and amusing. The African
    giants were well-trained for their part, playing with the miserable victims
    like a feline doth with its prey, allowing them to escape, now and then,
    to see safety close at hand, to make a wild dash for what looked like freedom,
    and then suddenly bounding on them with that short wide sword that cried
    death as it descended.</p>
  <p>Rapturous applause greeted this show, and loud immoderate laughter hailed
    the fruitless efforts of the hunted, their falls over the obstacles, their
    look of horror, and the contortions of their meagre bodies when they were
    caught at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Habet! Habet! Habet!&rdquo; everyone shouted when one of the unfortunate
    wretches brought to bay tried to turn on his pursuer, and to pit two feeble
    arms against the relentless grip of well-trained giants, and against the
    death-dealing sword.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Habet! Habet! Habet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has it!&rdquo; they screamed. He has the hideous death, the gaping
    wound in the still panting chest. He has the final agony which helps to make
    a holiday for the great citizens of the world.</p>
  <p>Now at last the sand of the arena has turned red with blood, the sickly
    odour mounts to every nostril; shrieks become more wild, like those of thousands
    of demons let loose. Anticipation and desire has been brought to its wildest
    pitch, and Caligula has every cause to be satisfied.</p>
  <p>Cries of &ldquo;The lions! the lions! Slaves to the lions!&rdquo; resounded
    from every side. Thousands of feet beat a tattoo on the floor, and from behind
    the great copper gates a mighty roar filled the heat-laden air with its awesome
    echo.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>In his gilded cage supported by carved pillars and drawn by eight Ethiopian
    slaves, the favourite of Caligula was slowly wheeled into the arena.</p>
  <p>A huge sigh rose from every breast. The tumult was hushed; dead silence
    fell upon the vast concourse of people suddenly turned to stone, alive only
    by two hundred thousand pairs of eyes fixed upon the cage and its occupant.</p>
  <p>The black panther&mdash;with its sleek black coat on which the midday sun
    threw tiny blotches of tawny lights&mdash;was cowering in a corner of its
    cage; its snake-like head, with the broad flat brow and wide curved jaws,
    was drawn back between its shoulders, its small golden eyes, gleaming like
    yellow topaz, were half closed in wary somnolence.</p>
  <p>Slowly the cage was wheeled round by the panting negro slaves, and then
    it was brought to a standstill against the copper gates at the eastern end
    of the arena.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Be thou faithful unto death.&rdquo;&mdash;Revelations 2. 10.</p>
  <p>Up in the gorgeously draped tribune, beneath the striped awning, the Emperor
    Caligula watched the arrival of his pet panther with a grin of delight upon
    his face. He rubbed his hands together in obvious glee, and anon pointed
    out the beauty of the ferocious creature to the Augusta Dea Flavia, who coldly
    nodded in response.</p>
  <p>She had sat beside the C&aelig;sar all through the long, weary morning,
    giving but few signs of life. Many there were who thought that, overcome
    with drowsiness owing to the heat, she had fallen asleep with her head buried
    in the fragrant depths of the lilies which she held.</p>
  <p>Certain it is that throughout the spectacle she had kept her eyes closed,
    and when death-cries filled the air with their terrible echo, she had once
    or twice put her small hands to her ears.</p>
  <p>Whenever she had done that the C&aelig;sar had laughed, and apparently made
    jest of her with the other Augustas who, in their turn, appeared greatly
    amused.</p>
  <p>The spectacle indeed had been somewhat tame, and but for the human chase
    of a while ago, would have been intolerably dull. There was surely nothing
    in the death of a few miserable slaves to upset the nerves of a Roman princess.
    As for the gladiators! well! they were trained and well paid to die.</p>
  <p>Not far from the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s person, and leaning against the wall
    of the tribune in his wonted attitude, the praefect of Rome had also stood
    silently by. The Emperor had ordered his presence, nor could the praefect
    of the city be absent when the sacred person of the C&aelig;sar was abroad
    amongst his people.</p>
  <p>But no one could say whether the Anglicanus had seen or heard anything of
    what went on around him. His eyes of a truth were wide open, but they did
    not gaze down upon the arena; they were hidden by that dark frown upon his
    brow, and no one could guess whereon was his ardent gaze so resolutely fixed,
    no one could guess that from where he stood Taurus Antinor could perceive
    the outline of a delicate profile, with the softly rounded cheek, and a tiny
    shell-like ear half hidden by the filmy veil of curls.</p>
  <p>He could see the lids with their fringe of golden lashes fall wearily over
    the eyes, he could trace the shudder of horror which shook the slender figure
    from time to time.</p>
  <p>Once the lilies dropped from Dea Flavia&rsquo;s hand, and the soft swishing
    sound which they made in falling caused her to wake as from a reverie. She
    looked all round her with wide-open eyes, and her glance suddenly encountered
    those of the praefect of Rome. It seemed to him that her very soul was in
    her eyes then, a soul which at that moment appeared full of horror at all
    that she had seen.</p>
  <p>But as quickly as she had thus involuntarily revealed her soul, so did she
    conceal it again beneath her favoured veil of unbendable pride. She frowned
    on him as if angered that he should have surprised a secret, and almost it
    seemed then that she flashed on him a look of hatred and contempt.</p>
  <p>After that she turned away, and with her foot kicked away the fallen lilies.
    She sat now leaning forward, motionless and still, with her elbows buried
    in an embroidered cushion before her and her chin resting on her hands.</p>
  <p>Oh! if he only could, how gladly would he have seized her even now and carried
    her away from this nauseating scene of bloodshed and cruelty. He crossed
    his arms over his powerful chest till every muscle seemed to crack with the
    effort of self-control. His very soul longed to take her away, his sinews
    ached with the desire to seize her and to bear her in his arms away, away
    beyond the cruel encircling walls of Rome, away from her marble palaces and
    temple-crowned hills, away over the marshes of the Campania and the belt
    of the blue sea beyond to that far-off land of Galilee where he himself had
    found happiness and peace.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar had commanded his presence here to-day, and he had come
    because the C&aelig;sar had commanded. To the last he would render unto C&aelig;sar
    that which was C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s. But he had stood by with eyes that only
    saw a golden head crowned with diamonds, a delicate oval cheek coloured like
    a peach and tiny fleecy curls that fluttered softly in the breeze.</p>
  <p>There was no longer any sorrow in his heart, no longer any remorse or thought
    of treachery. The man in the little hut on the Aventine had shown him the
    way how to lay down his burden of weakness and of sin.</p>
  <p>He knew that he loved Dea Flavia with all the ardour of an untamed heart
    that has never before tasted the sweetness of love. He knew that he loved
    her with all the passion of a soul that at last hath found a mate. But now
    he knew also that in this love there was no thought of treachery to Him in
    Whose service he was prepared to lay down his life. He knew that never again
    would the exquisite vision of this fair young pagan stand between him and
    the Cross, but rather that she would point to him&mdash;ignorantly and unconsciously&mdash;the
    way up to Golgotha.</p>
  <p>For renunciation awaited him&mdash;that also did he know. A few more days
    in the service of the C&aelig;sar, and his promise to remain in Rome would
    no longer bind him, since Caligula had returned from abroad.</p>
  <p>The rest of his life was at the bidding of Him Who mutely from the Cross
    had demanded his allegiance: a lonely hut somewhere on the Campania, or further
    if God demanded it, a life of strenuous effort to win souls for Christ, and
    the renunciation of all that had made life easy and pleasant hitherto. God
    alone knew how easy that would have been to him forty-eight hours ago. Taurus
    Antinor hated and despised the life of Rome, the tyranny of a demented C&aelig;sar,
    the indolence of the daily routine, the ever-recurrent spectacles of hideous,
    inhuman cruelty. Until that midday hour in the Forum four days ago, he had
    viewed his new prospective life with a sense of infinite relief.</p>
  <p>But now renunciation meant something more. Detachment from Rome and all
    its pomps, its glories, and its cruelties meant also detachment from the
    presence of Dea Flavia. It meant the tearing out of his very heartstrings
    which had found root at a woman&rsquo;s feet. It meant the drawing of an
    impenetrable veil between life itself and all that henceforth could alone
    make life dear.</p>
  <p>He had dreamed a dream, the exquisite beauty of which had wrought havoc
    in his innermost soul, but the awakening had come before the glorious dream
    had found its complete birth. Jesus of Nazareth had called to him from the
    Cross, but even as He called, the pierced, sacred hand had pointed to the
    broad path strewn with gold and roses, filled with the fragrance of lilies
    and thrilled with the song of mating birds: and the dying voice had gently
    murmured: &ldquo;Choose!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The soldier had chosen and was ready to go. But renunciation was not to
    be the easy turning away from a road that was none too dear&mdash;it was
    to be a sacrifice!&mdash;the taking up of the cross and the slow, weary mounting
    up, up to Calvary, with aching back and sweating brow and the dreary tragedy
    of utter loneliness.</p>
  <p>It meant the giving up of every delight of manhood, of happiness in a woman&rsquo;s
    smile, of rapture in a woman&rsquo;s kiss. It meant the giving up of every
    joy in seeing her pass before him, of hearing the swish of her skirts on
    the pavement of the city; it meant the giving up of all hope ever to win
    her, of all thought of a future home, the patter of children&rsquo;s feet,
    the rocking of a tiny cradle. It meant the sacrifice of every thought of
    happiness and of every desire of body and of soul.</p>
  <p>It meant the nailing of a heart to the foot of a cross.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;So I gave them up unto their own heart&rsquo;s lust: and they walked
    in their own counsels.&rdquo;&mdash;Psalms 81. 12.</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile the stage-hands, the smiths and carpenters had been busily
    at work, setting the scene for the coming drama.</p>
  <p>Huge gnarled tree-trunks were dragged into the arena, and so disposed as
    to afford shelter either for man or beast. By a mechanical device a stream
    of water some six foot wide was made to wind its course along the sands,
    and groups of tall reeds and other aquatic plants were skilfully arranged
    beside the banks of this improvised stream.</p>
  <p>Soon the whole aspect of the arena was thus transformed into an open piece
    of country with trees here and there, and tufts of grass, mounds and monticules,
    with a stream and a reed-covered shore. The whole beautifully arranged and
    with due regard for realism.</p>
  <p>The people watched, highly pleased; now that the Emperor&rsquo;s pet panther
    had appeared they were satisfied that a spectacle such as they loved was
    about to be unfolded before them.</p>
  <p>But soon the workmen were engaged on other work, the purport of which could
    not at first be guessed. To understand it at all a vivid picture of the huge
    arena must appear before the mind.</p>
  <p>Down below there was the artificial landscape, the trees, the stream, the
    sand and grass, and all around the massive marble walls rose to a height
    of some twelve feet to the lowest tier of the tribunes, beyond which sat
    row upon row in precipitous gradients two hundred thousand spectators.</p>
  <p>At about four feet from the ground a narrow ledge&mdash;formed by the elaborate
    carving in the solid marble&mdash;ran right along the walls, and between
    this ledge and the top of the wall there was a low colonnaded arcade with
    deep niches set between the fluted columns.</p>
  <p>From these niches the workmen now suspended short ladders of twisted crimson
    silk, of sufficient strength to bear the weight of a man. They affixed these
    to heavy steel rings imbedded in the bases of the columns, and when the ladders
    were in position, they hung down low enough, that a man&mdash;standing on
    the ledge below&mdash;could just contrive to seize the ends and to swing
    himself aloft, up into the niche.</p>
  <p>The public watched these preparations with breathless interest, for soon
    their objects became evident. It was clear that those who were to be exposed
    to an encounter with the panther would be given a fair chance of escape.
    It was to be an even fight between man and beast.</p>
  <p>A man hotly pursued by the brute could&mdash;if he were sufficiently agile&mdash;leap
    upon the narrow ledge, seize the rope-ladder and climb up it until he reached
    the safe haven of the niche, and could draw the ladder in after him. And
    fear of death doth lend a man wondrous agility.</p>
  <p>It looked in fact as if the coming struggle were all to be in favour of
    the man and not of the beast, for the smooth surface of the walls and the
    narrow ledge above the carvings could not afford foothold to an enraged four-footed
    creature with sharp claws that would glance off the polished marble.</p>
  <p>The public&mdash;realising this&mdash;waxed impatient. The novel spectacle
    did not, after all, promise to be to its liking. The panther would make but
    a sorry show if it was not given a helpless victim or two to devour.</p>
  <p>Murmurs of dissatisfaction rose from every side as the work proceeded, and
    anon when all round the walls of the arena, the twelve ladders of safety
    were firmly fixed, seeming mutely to deride the excitement of the people,
    the murmur broke into angry cries.</p>
  <p>But Caligula did not seem to heed either the murmur or those loud expressions
    of discontent which, at other times, would probably have maddened him with
    rage. He had watched the preparations with eager interest and had himself
    once or twice shouted directions to the workmen.</p>
  <p>Now, when everything appeared complete, he turned to the tribune which was
    next to his own, and his small bloodshot eyes wandered over the assembly
    of patricians, of knights and of senators who were seated there.</p>
  <p>He called my lord Hortensius Martius to him and appeared to be pointing
    out to him the advantages of the rope-ladders with obvious pride in the ingenuity
    of the device. Young Escanes too was bidden to admire the contrivance, which&mdash;it
    soon became evident&mdash;was the invention of the C&aelig;sar himself.</p>
  <p>The public&mdash;still feeling dissatisfied&mdash;watched desultorily for
    a while the doings in the imperial tribune. Then general interest was once
    more aroused, when the workmen&mdash;slaves and legionaries&mdash;having
    finished their preparations, hurried helter-skelter out of the arena.</p>
  <p>The sliding doors of the panther&rsquo;s cage were being slowly drawn away.</p>
  <p>For a few seconds the powerful brute remained wary, silent and cowering,
    then with one mighty, savage snarl it bounded into the arena.</p>
  <p>Supple, graceful and splendid it walked round in solemn majesty, its flat
    head kept low to the ground, its sinuous body curving and winding as it walked,
    like that of a snake.</p>
  <p>The public watched it, fascinated by the perfect grace of its movements
    and by the cruel ferocity of its tiny eyes.</p>
  <p>Now at the eastern end of the Amphitheatre a small iron gate slowly swung
    upon its hinges, and in the dark recess beyond it a couple of men appeared.
    For a moment they stood there immovable, a closely huddled mass, shoulder
    to shoulder, with round open eyes dilated with fear and a cry of nameless
    terror still hovering unuttered on their lips.</p>
  <p>They were hugely built men, with massive torso and legs bare, and tow-coloured
    hair brought straight up to the crown of the head and knotted there with
    a black band.</p>
  <p>There was much shouting from the recess whence they had emerged, and anon
    some vigorous prodding and pushing from behind. But they dug their bare feet
    into the sand, refusing to move; arm against arm they made of themselves
    a wall which fear of death kept rigid and horror made unbreakable.</p>
  <p>The public greeted them with mock applause. In them they had quickly recognised
    the German barbarians whom the C&aelig;sar had brought back from his last
    expedition as prisoners of war; in truth they were hardened malefactors who
    had been offered a chance of life in exchange for the pitiable masquerade.
    But this the public did not know. To the two hundred thousand holiday-makers,
    craning their necks to see the miserable wretches, they were but the living
    proofs of the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s prowess in the field. With ironical cheers
    they were bidden to advance, even whilst at no great distance from them the
    black panther sitting on its haunches was surveying them with lazy curiosity,
    licking its mighty jaws.</p>
  <p>Then the public grew impatient, and from the recess behind the two men persuasion
    became more vigorous. Through the darkness behind the gates there appeared
    the red glow of a brazier, there was a quick hissing sound, an awful double
    howl of pain and the smell of burnt flesh filled the air. The next moment
    the two men fell scrambling forward into the arena, and the iron gate closed
    behind them with a thud.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Thou art become guilty in the blood that thou hast shed.&rdquo;&mdash;Ezekiel
    22. 4.</p>
  <p>The hunter and the hunted! the lithe supple sinewy creature crawling with
    belly almost touching the ground and stealthy steps that made no sound on
    the sand of the arena.</p>
  <p>Wary and silent the black beast crawled, now hiding amidst the scrubby grass,
    now bounding over trees and stream as if playing with herself, with her own
    desire for a taste of human blood.</p>
  <p>At first terror had kept the two men rooted to the spot, paralysed, and
    with feet deeply imbedded in the sand. Only their eyes seemed alive, roaming
    along the wall, all round to where on either side the silken ladders made
    vivid crimson streaks on the white smoothness of the marble.</p>
  <p>The panther waiting, watched them till they moved. The public, entranced,
    scarcely dared to draw breath.</p>
  <p>Then came a sudden cry from thousands of throats; the two men, as if driven
    by a sudden sense of approaching death, had made a quick desperate rush,
    one to the right the other to the left, towards the crimson silk which meant
    safety to them.</p>
  <p>But the panther was on guard and quicker twice than they. It seemed as if
    the brute had divined exactly where lay escape for its prey. It was guarding
    both sides of the arena at once, bounding from left to right, and back from
    right to left with giant leaps, soundless and swift.</p>
  <p>The men paused again, because it seemed that when they were still, the panther
    too lay still and watched.</p>
  <p>There was another lull, and from the imperial tribune above Dea Flavia watched
    the horrible spectacle, and Taurus Antinor drank into his soul the beauty
    of her eyes as they watched&mdash;fascinated&mdash;every movement of the
    sleek black panther, and of those fair-skinned giants trying to escape from
    death; she watched the stealthy approach of the beast toward its prey; she
    watched, motionless and still, the while great beads of perspiration matted
    the fair curls on her brow.</p>
  <p>And to the man who loved her, and who saw her thus watching the horrible
    spectacle which must have made her feel sick and faint, to him it seemed
    as if in her mind the hideous sight meant something more than just the brutal
    display of cruelty which was a familiar one enough in Rome.</p>
  <p>It seemed as if to her some hidden meaning lay in this teasing of a ferocious
    brute, and in this apparent clemency in allowing the victims a chance of
    escape, for every now and then she turned as if involuntarily toward the
    C&aelig;sar, and a quick glance of understanding seemed to pass between her
    and that inhuman monster.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor, with his gaze fixed upon her every movement, wondered what
    all that could mean.</p>
  <p>After a quarter of an hour of tense excitement, of alternate cries of horror
    and screams of delight, the two men had, by dint of cunning and agility,
    succeeded in evading the panther. They were safe within the protecting niches;
    the panther down below was roaring with baffled rage, and the public clapped
    and cheered vociferously.</p>
  <p>Two more men were thrust into the arena, dressed in the same way as the
    others, pushed forward like the others to the accompaniment of a brazier&rsquo;s
    glow and the smell of burnt flesh.</p>
  <p>The panther, more wary this time, did not allow both men to escape. Yet
    they had made a clever dash for safety; one of them was already swinging
    himself aloft, but the other had missed his footing once, when he jumped
    upon the ledge; he regained it and seized the swinging end of the ladder,
    but the panther, with a bound, had reached him and caught his foot in its
    jaws.</p>
  <p>That hideous noise&mdash;the scrunching of a human bone&mdash;was drowned
    in tumultuous applause as the miserable wretch with the maimed and bleeding
    leg, but with that almighty instinct for life at any cost, toiled mangled
    and bleeding up that ladder less crimson than the trail which he left in
    his wake.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia&rsquo;s head fell forward on the cushion. But she fought against
    the swoon. The ironical laughter of the Augustas round her quickly brought
    her to herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The heat is overpowering,&rdquo; she said calmly in reply to a coarse
    comment from the C&aelig;sar.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;His blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.&rdquo;&mdash;Joshua
    2. 19.</p>
  <p>The heat was intense! The glare from the tribunes opposite seemed to sear
    the eyes, and from below there rose to the nostrils that awful sickening
    stench of human blood.</p>
  <p>The public, frantic with excitement, was clapping and cheering; thousands
    of necks were craned to get a better view into the floor of the arena, thousands
    of fans were fluttering, children were laughing and women chattered incessantly,
    like a pack of monkeys.</p>
  <p>And down below the baffled panther sent roar upon roar of rage into the
    seething cauldron of a thousand sounds.</p>
  <p>The creature had been cheated to the last; a score of victims had been pushed
    into his lair to tempt him. He had stalked them in play at first, then more
    earnestly, finally with a mad desire for blood. But always his prey escaped
    him, invisible hands showed the means of escape; the crimson ladders seemed
    to multiply their numbers until all round the walls they showed innumerable
    paths to safety.</p>
  <p>The panther seemed to know that those streaks of crimson were his mute enemies.
    He made several ineffectual dashes for them, but always his claws slid against
    the marble, and he fell back into the sand, snarling with rage.</p>
  <p>Once or twice his prey was more attainable. He caught a foot, a leg, a hand;
    thrice he brought a huge, panting body to the ground, but even then he was
    cheated of his victory. Long iron grapnels, wielded by unseen hands, dragged
    the mangled limbs and torn bodies roughly from his clutch, leaving behind
    them trails of torn flesh and streams of blood, which only helped to exasperate
    the beast by their insufficiency.</p>
  <p>And now the panther was like a black, snake-like fury, blind with rage and
    unsatisfied lust, with tail lashing like a whipcord and yellow eyes that
    gleamed like tiny suns. His jaws were red and dripping, his claws had been
    torn by the same grapnels that had snatched his prey from him.</p>
  <p>He had ceased to roar, but snarl upon snarl escaped his panting throat.
    The public delighted in him. They loved to see the ferocious brute maddened
    by these tortures, beside which the agony of Tantalus was but the misery
    of a child.</p>
  <p>Then Caligula rose to his feet and his heralds blew loud blasts upon their
    trumpets. In a moment silence fell on the entire arena; the pandemonium of
    shouts and laughter and shrieks of agony was hushed as if by the magic of
    an almighty power.</p>
  <p>The Emperor was standing and desired speech, and all at once silence descended
    upon this vast concourse of people. Everyone rose, since the C&aelig;sar
    was standing; all heads were turned towards the tribune, all eyes fixed upon
    the misshapen figure with its halo of gold round the grotesque head, and
    the metal thunderbolts held aloft in the hand.</p>
  <p>The only sound that was not stilled at the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s bidding was&mdash;down
    below&mdash;the snarl of the angry panther.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Citizens of Rome,&rdquo; began Caligula, as soon as he could make
    himself heard, &ldquo;patricians of Rome! soldiers! senators! all my people!
    I&mdash;even I&mdash;your C&aelig;sar, your Emperor, your god, do give you
    greeting! I have sought to please you and to make you happy on this my first
    day amongst you all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here he was interrupted by vociferous cheering. Next to shows and spectacles,
    to games and theatres, there was nothing that the people of Rome loved better
    than to hear impassioned speeches thundered at them either from the rostra
    in the Forum, or from any convenient spot whence the voice of a good speaker
    would rouse a sense of excitement or elation in their hearts. Demagogues
    and agitators, rhetoricians and poets were all sure of a hearing, if only
    they were sufficiently inspired and sufficiently eloquent. But it was not
    often that the C&aelig;sar himself would pour forth imperial oratory into
    the delighted ears of his people, and a fervent speech from the Emperor at
    this moment, when excitement and exhilaration were at fever-pitch, was a
    pleasure which no one had foreseen but which filled everyone with delight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Glad am I,&rdquo; continued Caligula, when the excitement had calmed
    down momentarily, &ldquo;that my efforts to please you have met with success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They have! They have!&rdquo; yelled the enthusiastic crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The gods have indeed rewarded me&mdash;not beyond my deserts, for
    that were impossible&mdash;but in a just measure, by giving me the love of
    my people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hail C&aelig;sar! Hail the greatest and best of C&aelig;sars!&rdquo; came
    in deafening echoes from every side of the immense Amphitheatre.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you all! Your loyalty to-day has greatly cheered me. I&mdash;as
    your supreme lord and god&mdash;will shower my blessings upon you. As a god
    I am immortal; always I will watch over you, sitting at the right hand of
    Jupiter Victor, my father, from all times. But in my earthly shape I may
    not be with you always. There may come a time when god-like duties call me
    to Olympus. Then must a wise and just ruler take my place at the head of
    this great Empire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! Hail to thee C&aelig;sar! Immortal C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; cried
    the people, and Caligula, stricken with vanity as if with plague, was deaf
    to the ironical cheers that accompanied these cries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Immortal am I,&rdquo; he said, whilst his bloodshot eyes travelled
    restlessly over the sea of faces spread out before him. &ldquo;Immortal,
    yet destined to leave you one day. When that day comes, there will be weeping
    in the city and moanings throughout the Empire, but the wise and just ruler
    who will follow in my wake will&mdash;while not able to console you for my
    loss&mdash;continue the good works which I have commenced. Citizens of Rome,
    patricians, soldiers, all listen to what I say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His face now looked purple with excitement, his hoarse voice shook as it
    escaped his throat, and his hair, thin and lanky, seemed to stand upon end
    all round his large, bulging forehead.</p>
  <p>A gentle breeze had caught the folds of his purple tunic, and it fluttered
    all round him with a curious swishing noise, like the sighing of creatures
    in pain.</p>
  <p>The hand that held Jove&rsquo;s thunderbolt trembled visibly, and the perspiration
    was streaming down his face. There was not a man or woman present there at
    this moment who did not look upon him as an abject and hideous monster, there
    was no one there who did not loathe and despise him! And yet everyone listened,
    and not one voice was raised in derision at his senseless oratory.</p>
  <p>Only the panther snarled, and its tail beat against the ground with a dull,
    monotonous sound.</p>
  <p>And Dea Flavia, standing beside the monster, white as the lilies which now
    lay withered at her feet, listened to every word that he said, whilst Taurus
    Antinor gazed on her and saw again in her eyes that look of anticipation
    and of understanding, as of one who knows what is to come.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Citizens of Rome,&rdquo; resumed the imperial mountebank after an
    impressive pause, &ldquo;I have spent days and nights in communion with the
    gods, thinking of your welfare&mdash;of your welfare when I no longer will
    be amongst you all. And this is what I and the gods have decided. Listen
    to me, for the gods speak to you through my mouth&mdash;I, even I, your C&aelig;sar
    and your god, do speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There dwells amongst us all one whose divinity is almost equal to
    mine own&mdash;one who by her beauty and her grace hath found favour with
    the gods and with me. She is of the House of C&aelig;sar, and hath name Dea
    Flavia; and I, the C&aelig;sar, have called her Augusta, and set her up above
    all other women in Rome. She comes from the House of great Augustus himself,
    and it is a descendant of the great Augustus who alone will be worthy to
    wield the sceptre of C&aelig;sar when it hath fallen from my grasp. Therefore
    this have I decided. The son of Dea Flavia shall in time to come follow in
    my footsteps, and make you happy and prosperous even as I have done; and
    because of this my decision must I give Dea Flavia as wife unto a man who
    is worthy of her. Many there are who have aspired to her hand, but all of
    them have I hitherto rejected, because not one of them had given proof of
    his courage or of his strength. Citizens of Rome, patricians, and soldiers
    all! What we must look for in your future ruler is valour in the face of
    death, coolness and intrepidity in the sight of danger. These qualities,
    which grace your present C&aelig;sar, must be transmitted to his successor
    through Dea Flavia, the divine, and by a father who has given signal proof
    of his virtues. I have enjoined the Augusta Dea Flavia to bestow her hand
    on him who above all is worthy to be her lord. To this has she consented
    and to-day will she make her choice, and herewith do I call on you patricians
    who aspire to her hand to enter the lists in her honour. Give a proof of
    your valour, of your intrepidity, of your courage! Show that you are as valiant
    as the lion, as wary as the snake. Descend into the arena now, unarmed save
    for the hands which the gods have given you, and thus engage that unconquered
    monster in single combat! An even chance of life is given you! And I&mdash;even
    I your C&aelig;sar&mdash;will give unto the victor the hand of the Augusta
    Dea Flavia in marriage!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even before his last words had echoed along the marble walls, deafening
    cries and cheers rent the air. Men shouted, women screamed and waved their
    fans, mantles were torn from every shoulder and swung overhead like flags.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hail to C&aelig;sar! Hail to the best and greatest of C&aelig;sars!
    Hail to the Augusta! Dea Flavia, hail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The shouts were incessant, even whilst Caligula, delighted with his oratory,
    exultant over the success of his plan, stood there trembling in every limb,
    with moist, purple face turned from right to left to receive the acclamations
    of his people. His tiny eyes blinked with the glare that struck fully at
    them from opposite, his throat was parched with screaming, his tongue seemed
    to cleave to the roof of his mouth.</p>
  <p>Excitement was overmastering him; the effort to appear outwardly sane and
    calm was too severe a tax upon his raging temper. The heat, too, no doubt
    turned him giddy, for suddenly, even whilst the cries of &ldquo;Hail!&rdquo; buzzed
    in his ears, he threw up his arms and tottered backwards, rigid as a log,
    whilst drops of foam gathered at the corners of his mouth.</p>
  <p>It was Taurus Antinor who received the swooning C&aelig;sar in his strong
    arms. Everyone else around was too excited to move. The Augustas, inwardly
    consumed with jealousy, were striving to keep up an appearance of dignity
    in the face of the insult which they deemed had been put upon them by this
    semi-deification of their kinswoman.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia, pale and silent, stood facing the people, with eyes that seemed
    to look on something unearthly far away. Her white robes, shimmering with
    precious stones, fell round her like a shroud, her lips were parted as with
    a cry that had died even before it had found birth in her throat. The public
    thought that she looked proud, and acclaimed her because of this strange
    aloofness which seemed to envelop her whole person. She did not look of this
    world at all. Even the eyes appeared sightless and dead.</p>
  <p>When the C&aelig;sar fell back, half fainting, she seemed to wake from her
    dream, a shudder went right through her as her eyes slowly turned from their
    vacant gaze to the prostrate figure of this inhuman monster, lying stricken
    like a felled brute, in the arms of the praefect of Rome.</p>
  <p>Once again, and for the third time to-day, her eyes met those of Taurus
    Antinor, but this time it seemed to him that within their still mysterious
    depths he read something akin to an appeal.</p>
  <p>As on that day in the Forum, intense pity&mdash;which had given birth to
    love&mdash;filled his heart for this beautiful young girl who seemed so lonely
    in the midst of all this pomp.</p>
  <p>The purity of her soul appeared to him undimmed, even though he knew now
    that she had expected this awful thing all along, and that she was no stranger
    to this monstrous barter of her person for the attainment of a crazy Emperor&rsquo;s
    whim, or to make holiday for the rabble of Rome. In his sight her pride remained
    unshaken; only her loyalty and allegiance had been given to the C&aelig;sar
    in the same way as his own had been. She, in her simple, womanly way, was
    rendering unto C&aelig;sar that which was C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s, and Taurus
    Antinor, whilst tenderly pitying her, felt that he had never loved her as
    fondly as he did now.</p>
  <p>The curse of the dying freedwoman was indeed bearing fruit. Dea&rsquo;s
    favours, her loyalty, were turning to bitter malediction for the recipients.
    More than one man to-day, mayhap, would die an horrible death in the hope
    of winning her grace. And Taurus Antinor, in the silent depths of his soul,
    prayed unto God that the woman he loved should never&mdash;as Menecreta had
    foretold&mdash;be driven to beg for mercy from a heart that knew it not and
    find a pitiless ear turned to her prayers.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Caligula had quickly shaken himself free from the arms that held him. The
    fainting fit which had threatened him passed away as swiftly as it had come.
    His lust of hate and revenge was so keen at this moment that it conquered
    all his physical weakness. When he realised that it was Taurus Antinor who
    was supporting him, he contrived to smile benignly and placidly upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am well! I am well!&rdquo; he reiterated cheerfully. &ldquo;Did
    my voice carry all over the Amphitheatre? Did everyone hear what I said?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everyone heard thy voice, O C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; said Taurus Antinor
    slowly, &ldquo;and see the aspirant for the Augusta&rsquo;s hand has prepared
    to do battle for her sake!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;But truly as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but
    a step between me and death.&rdquo;&mdash;I Samuel 20. 3.</p>
  <p>When the C&aelig;sar had finished speaking, and he fell swooning back in
    the arms of the praefect of Rome, the conspirators remained quite still,
    staring at one another, dumbfounded.</p>
  <p>Could any man at that moment have divined the secrets of the heart and looked
    into the thoughts of all these men, what a medley of terror and of lust,
    of rage and of jealousy, would have been unfolded before his eyes.</p>
  <p>The plotters were like men who, falling to with axe and pick to demolish
    a building, had seen that same building collapse beneath their feet. They
    had sat quietly by all the day watching the events, content that these would
    shape themselves in accordance with their will. Young Escanes from time to
    time fingered the poniard which he had hidden under his tunic, Hortensius
    Martius gave free rein to his ardent admiration of Dea Flavia, Ancyrus, the
    elder, kept watch over every phase of the temper of the audience&mdash;its
    apathy, its excitement, its murmurs of dissatisfaction and cries of enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>Only Caius Nepos, white to the lips, sat in terror lest the courage of the
    conspirators whom he had betrayed should fail them at the eleventh hour,
    and he&mdash;branded as a false informer&mdash;be left to encounter the fury
    of an almighty C&aelig;sar, who had never been known to relent.</p>
  <p>The speech of Caligula had of a truth struck strangely upon his hearers.
    The men who had been willing to wait upon chance for the success of their
    plot, now found that Chance had waited upon them. The thought of treachery
    did not at first enter their minds. The freaks of the crazy Emperor were
    as numerous and as varied as the grains of sand in the arena. That he should
    offer the hand of his kinswoman as a prize to a victor in the arena, was
    not inconsistent with his perpetual desire for new sensations, his lust of
    tyrannical power and his open contempt for all his fellow-men.</p>
  <p>His allusions to his probable successor had seemed futile and of no account,
    and they all felt that they had wallowed so deeply in the mire of conspiracy
    together, that it could not have served the purpose of any one of them to
    betray the others.</p>
  <p>The first moment of stupefaction had quickly passed away, and even before
    the C&aelig;sar had recovered consciousness Hortensius Martius had risen
    to his feet. There had been no hesitation in him from the first. Whilst the
    others pondered&mdash;vaguely frightened at this turn given by Chance to
    her wheel&mdash;he was ready to stake his life for the possession of Dea
    Flavia and of the imperium. His passion for the beautiful woman would have
    led him into far wilder extravagances and into far graver dangers than an
    encounter in a public arena with a wild beast, and the momentary degradation
    of offering his patrician person as a spectacle for the plebs.</p>
  <p>And because of this sudden decision, taken boldly whilst others wavered,
    he became tacitly the leader of the gang of plotters. When he jumped to his
    feet, ready to descend into the arena, he seemed to challenge them to keep
    their oath of allegiance to him, who would succeed in winning Dea Flavia
    for wife.</p>
  <p>Hortensius Martius had proved himself to be a true opportunist, for he had
    seized his opportunity just at the right moment when the others hesitated.
    Thus are leaders made&mdash;one bold movement whilst others sit still, one
    step forward whilst the others wait.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy chance, O Hortensius Martius,&rdquo; whispered Marcus Ancyrus,
    the elder, close to the young man&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Escanes and the rest
    of us will be ready when the time comes, mayhap before thou dost return to
    us from below.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Escanes&rsquo; hand beneath his tunic closed upon the dagger. Stronger and
    taller than Hortensius, he had not the sudden initiative of the brain. He
    was one of those men who would always be second to a bolder, a more resourceful
    leader.</p>
  <p>Forty pairs of eyes encouraged Hortensius Martius as he rose. In their minds
    they had already crowned him with laurels. For the moment they had accepted
    him as their future Emperor and were prepared to acclaim him as C&aelig;sar
    when Escanes had done his work.</p>
  <p>It was at this moment that Caligula recovered from his swoon. His lust of
    revenge and of hate brought him back to reality. He had planned to make the
    arch-traitor betray himself, and now, when he caught sight of Hortensius
    Martius preparing to descend into the arena, a cry as of some prowling, savage
    beast rose and died in his throat.</p>
  <p>He was sufficiently cunning to control himself, sufficiently of an actor
    to play his part without betraying his thoughts. Though he would gladly have
    strangled Hortensius then and there with his own hands, he called the young
    man to him with kindly benevolence and placed a fatherly hand upon his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou, O Hortensius Martius?&rdquo; he said, in well-feigned astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even I, O C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; replied Hortensius calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For love of the Augusta thou wouldst risk thy life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To prove my valour, gracious lord, since thou didst desire it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On thy knees then, O my son!&rdquo; rejoined the mountebank solemnly, &ldquo;and
    receive the blessing of the gods.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The public watched this little scene with palpitating interest. The C&aelig;sar
    looked magnificent in his fantastic robes, and beside him Dea Flavia&mdash;like
    a goddess in her white tunic&mdash;was beautiful to behold.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar laid three fingers on the young man&rsquo;s head, and turned
    his bloodshot eyes up to the vault of heaven. Then Hortensius Martius rose
    from his knees and went up to the Augusta Dea Flavia, and knelt down before
    her. She took no heed of him whatever. She did not look upon his bowed head
    as he stooped very low and kissed the hem of her gown; some who watched the
    scene very closely declared afterwards that she snatched her robe away from
    his hands.</p>
  <p>And from the arena down below was heard again the snarl of the thwarted
    beast.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>From the Emperor&rsquo;s tribune, to right and left, wide marble steps led
    down to the floor of the arena. At the bottom of these steps huge iron gates,
    wrought with gold and studded with nails, guarded them against access from
    below. Two legionaries were stationed at these gates.</p>
  <p>When Hortensius Martius appeared at the top of the steps the audience screamed
    with delight and cheered him to the echoes.</p>
  <p>He was indeed a figure like to please the most hardened spectator. Not over
    tall, and slight of build, he looked elegant and graceful in his short white
    tunic, with the deep purple bands that proclaimed his patrician rank.</p>
  <p>A young exquisite, with well-groomed hands and hair delicately perfumed
    and curled, the tense expression of his face gave him nevertheless an air
    of determination and of strength. He had taken off his cloak and was winding
    it round his left arm, otherwise, of course, he was unarmed as the Emperor
    had directed.</p>
  <p>The women blew him kisses across the width of the arena, and some of the
    more enthusiastic&mdash;or the younger&mdash;ones pelted him with roses as
    he came down the steps.</p>
  <p>And down below the panther, as if scenting this new prey, sent a roar of
    expectation into the vibrating air.</p>
  <p>Caligula smiled with hideous complacency as he looked down on the descending
    figure of the young man, and when the people cheered, and the shower of roses
    fell in a blood-red mass at Hortensius&rsquo; feet, the C&aelig;sar snarled
    even as the panther had done, showing a row of yellow teeth, like fangs.</p>
  <p>At last Hortensius Martius had reached the foot of the steps. The massive
    iron gates stood alone between him and the black panther, which cowered some
    twenty feet away behind a low monticule covered with tufts of grass, its
    tiny eyes of topaz fixed upon the oncoming prey.</p>
  <p>Hortensius gave the order for the opening of the gates. They swung upon
    their hinges and he passed out through them. And they fell to behind him
    with a mighty clang.</p>
  <p>Thunderous applause greeted him when he set his foot upon the sands of the
    arena. The panther did not move. It had even ceased to snarl, but its sinewy
    tail beat a dull tattoo upon the ground.</p>
  <p>Then over the whole arena there rose a curious sound, like the sighing of
    two hundred thousand souls, an indrawing of the breath in two hundred thousand
    throats. Hortensius Martius looked up, for the sigh had sounded very strangely
    in his ear, and it had been followed by a still stranger silence, as if two
    hundred thousand hearts had momentarily ceased to beat.</p>
  <p>And as he looked he understood the sigh, and also the death-like silence
    that followed.</p>
  <p>He saw that from the niches all round the arena the safety ladders of crimson
    silk had all been taken away.</p>
  <p>And up in the imperial tribune the mighty C&aelig;sar laughed loudly and
    long.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
    for his friends.&rdquo;&mdash;St. John 15. 13.</p>
  <p>No doubt that for that first tense moment all thought of treachery, of the
    conspiracy, of the imperium and even of Dea Flavia, was absent from the young
    man&rsquo;s mind.</p>
  <p>It must have come upon him suddenly then and there that his life was now
    in almost hopeless jeopardy. He was unarmed, and all around him the smooth
    marble walls of the arena rose, polished and straight, to a height of at
    least twelve feet, to the row of niches which alone might afford him shelter.
    From the bases of the fluted columns the iron rings to which the silken ladders
    had previously been attached, now hung at an unattainable height: the narrow
    ledge&mdash;four feet from the ground&mdash;had ceased to be a stepping-stone
    to safety.</p>
  <p>All this, of course, came to him in a flash, as does to a dying man, they
    say, the varied pictures of his life. Hortensius Martius, in that one flash,
    realised that he was a doomed man, that he had been trapped into this death-trap,
    and that nothing now but a miracle stood between him and a hideous death.</p>
  <p>Men up above in the tribunes held their breath; some women began to whimper
    with excitement. But the man and the panther stood for a moment eye to eye.
    No longer the hunted and the hunter, but the hungry beast of the desert and
    his certain prey. The baffled creature, tantalised with the blood of his
    other victims, was ready to satiate its lust at last.</p>
  <p>There was a moment of absolute silence, while two tiny golden eyes, measured
    the distance for a leap.</p>
  <p>The young man now, with the cunning born of a mad instinct for life, was
    waiting with bent knees, body slightly leaning forward and eyes fixed upon
    the brute. He had unwound the cloak from round his arm and held it in front
    of him like a shield. The man and the beast watched one another thus for
    a few seconds, and to many those few seconds seemed like an eternity.</p>
  <p>Then with a snarl the panther bounded forward. The man held his ground for
    the space of one second, and as the brute landed within an arm&rsquo;s length
    of him, quick as lightning he threw his cloak right in its face. Then he
    began to run. The panther, entangled in the folds of the cloak, savage and
    snarling, was tearing it to pieces, but Hortensius ran and ran, driven by
    the blind sense of self-preservation. He ran and ran the whole length of
    the arena, skirted the oval at the eastern end, and still continued to run,
    with elbows firmly held to his hips and with swift winged steps that made
    no sound in the sand.</p>
  <p>But already the creature, realising that again it was being cheated, started
    in pursuit. With leaps and bounds that seemed erratic and purposeless, it
    gradually diminished the distance between itself and the running man. Once
    it alighted on the outstanding branch of a gnarled tree, then from thence
    it took shelter in a clump of shrubs, then across the stream, swimming to
    the opposite shore; for the running man had rounded the oval and was now
    swiftly coming this way. Here in the tall grass it paused&mdash;cowering&mdash;once
    more on the watch.</p>
  <p>And Hortensius, while he ran so blindly along, had failed to notice where
    his enemy lay hiding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the grass!&rdquo; shouted a dozen voices.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On ahead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Further on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! Not there! Not there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was little exquisiteness left in the young man now. It was but a few
    moments since he had stepped smiling into the arena, kicking aside the rose-leaves
    which enthusiastic hands had thrown in his path. It was but some minutes
    since he had begun to run, and now the perspiration was pouring from his
    body, his face was as grey as the sand of the arena, the fear of death had
    raised the death-sweat on his brow.</p>
  <p>His breath came and went hot and panting through his nostrils, his eyes,
    dilated with terror, were vainly searching for the cowering enemy.</p>
  <p>Once more he turned to run. The panther seemed to be playing with him. A
    dozen times it could have reached him, a dozen times it bounded to one side,
    giving his prey another chance to run, another short respite for the agony
    of despair.</p>
  <p>Men, women and children screamed with excitement. No longer did they cheer
    the handsome young patrician, no longer did they throw roses at his feet.
    They shouted to him to run because they knew that running was no use. They
    urged the panther to leap because they fanned its rage with their screams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Habet! Habet!&rdquo; they shouted with every bound of the ferocious
    creature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Habet! Habet!&rdquo; now that Hortensius at last paused in his run.</p>
  <p>He stood quite still for a veil had descended over his eyes. The whole arena
    began to spin and to dance before him, the marble columns were twisted awry,
    thousands upon thousands of distorted faces grinned hideously upon him. Over
    the trees and the grass and the stream there was a film of red, the colour
    of blood, and through this film&mdash;which grew thicker and thicker as he
    gazed&mdash;he saw nothing but just opposite to him, across the width of
    the arena, towering high above everything around, the tall figure of Dea
    Flavia with her white dress falling straight from the shoulders, her fair
    hair crowned with diamonds, her face white as her gown and her lips parted
    as if uttering a cry of horror.</p>
  <p>The next moment that cry&mdash;it was a woman&rsquo;s cry&mdash;did rend
    the air from, end to end of the gigantic enclosure, and the cry was echoed
    and re-echoed by thousands and thousands of throats, as the panther, taking
    steady aim, leaped straight for the man.</p>
  <p>The noise became deafening: men, women, children, everyone screamed, and
    right through this whirling orgy of sound a voice was shouting, strong and
    mighty as that of Jupiter when he sends his decrees thundering forth into
    the air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By his throat, Hortensius! By his throat, and I&rsquo;ll at him whilst
    he pants!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hortensius put out his hands with a last instinctive sense of self-preservation.
    The mighty voice rang in his ear, it reverberated through the hot noonday
    air, and clanged against the copper gates as if a powerful arm had smitten
    them with the axe of Jove.</p>
  <p>The man saw the beast&rsquo;s leap, felt the hot breath in his face, felt
    the two yellow eyes gleaming on him like burning suns, and his ears buzzed
    with the din of thousands of shrieks; then he suddenly felt himself uplifted,
    whilst an agonised roar from the throat of a wounded beast overfilled the
    seething cauldron of sound.</p>
  <p>The praefect of Rome was standing in the arena now, and in his strong arms
    lifted high above his head he held the swooning man, whilst some few paces
    away the panther was lying prone, with blood streaming from its quivering
    jaws.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>It had all happened so suddenly that no one afterwards could say how it
    occurred. But there were those who retained a vision of the whole thing and
    afterwards shared their impressions with others.</p>
  <p>Everyone recollected when my lord Hortensius first entered the arena and
    the iron gates closed in behind him, that a general feeling of horror fell
    upon the entire public when it realised that all means of safety, all chance
    of escape had been removed with those silken ladders, and that the young
    patrician had in truth been left at the mercy of a powerful brute, goaded
    to madness through baffled desire for blood.</p>
  <p>At that same moment the praefect of Rome disappeared from the imperial tribune,
    and the terrible scene between the hunting beast and the hunted man had begun.</p>
  <p>Time for the man to run round the arena! Time for the brute to stalk and
    play with its prey! Time, it seems, for the praefect of Rome to make his
    way from the imperial tribune to the east end of the arena, where was stationed
    the city guard of which he had full control!</p>
  <p>A few precious seconds in making the soldiers understand what he wanted,
    a few more seconds to command them to obey for they stood as a phalanx against
    the gate, thinking the praefect mad in desiring to enter the arena&mdash;a
    few more seconds and Taurus Antinor was at last in the arena, shouting to
    the hunted man to have at the brute with his hands.</p>
  <p>But Hortensius was weak from exhaustion brought on by a life of luxury and
    idleness and by the excitement of the last two days. He put out two feeble
    hands, and the panther was already on the leap.</p>
  <p>And by that time Taurus Antinor was between him and the brute. With a blow
    of his hard fists&mdash;fashioned in far off Northern lands&mdash;and with
    the strength that is given to the barbarians of that sea-washed shore, he
    had drawn blood from the creature&rsquo;s jaw and sent it rolling back on
    its haunches, momentarily dazed.</p>
  <p>Only momentarily, however, whilst two hundred thousand throats yelled in
    unison:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Habet! Habet! Habet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A precious moment that! With a maddened beast, a swooning man and no arms
    save a pair of fists, hard as iron, made with a hand slender and supple like
    the finest tempered steel.</p>
  <p>And while the panther fell back roaring, and before it could prepare for
    a new spring, Taurus Antinor had seized the swooning man. It was his turn
    to run now, for he had but a few seconds in which to save the life of his
    bitterest foe.</p>
  <p>Straight to the walls of the arena did he run, and his voice was heard speaking
    loudly and commandingly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The arcade, man! Rouse thyself! The arcade! The rings in the columns!
    Quick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It needed the strength of a bullock to accomplish the deed: that, or the
    strength which comes from unbendable human will. The man, only half-conscious,
    returned to his senses by the force of that same will. The instinct of life
    was strongest in the end, and when Taurus Antinor leapt upon the ledge and
    hoisted Hortensius&rsquo;  body high up above his head, the young man, with
    the final effort borne of hope and built upon despair, reached up and caught
    one of the massive rings imbedded in the bases of the fluted columns.</p>
  <p>For a few seconds he remained suspended, his body swinging against the marble
    wall, whilst the public cheered with an enthusiasm that knew no bounds. From
    below the praefect helped to push the feeble body up, then another jerk,
    a pull upwards, a push, and Hortensius Martius had found safety in one of
    the niches of the arcade.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hail to the praefect of Rome! Hail!&rdquo; came in a continuous,
    thunderous roar from every corner of the arena, even as with a sudden bound
    the black panther had sprung upon Taurus Antinor, and, catching him unawares,
    had felled him to the ground.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Well done, thou good and faithful servant.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Matthew
    25. 21.</p>
  <p>A tumult amongst the people?</p>
  <p>Aye! it was here now fully aroused. The praefect of Rome was popular with
    the plebs. His action in the arena had called forth unbounded enthusiasm.
    When he fell rolling into the sand, with the black panther snarling above
    him, his steel-like grip warding for the moment the brute&rsquo;s jaws from
    off his throat, the people broke out into regular frenzy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The praefect! the praefect!&rdquo; they shouted.</p>
  <p>Men climbed down along the gradients leaping over other men, determined
    to jump down twelve feet into the arena in order to rescue the praefect from
    the jaws of the ferocious beast.</p>
  <p>But above in the imperial tribune the C&aelig;sar sat snarling like the
    panther and rubbing his hands with glee. His trap had been over-successful,
    one by one the arch-traitors fell headlong into it. First Hortensius Martius,
    that young fool! What mattered if he had escaped from a ravenous panther?
    The claws of a vengeful C&aelig;sar were sharper far than those of any beast
    of the desert.</p>
  <p>And now Taurus Antinor! the praefect of Rome! the man of silence and of
    integrity! the idol of the people, the scorner of C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s godhead.
    Vague rumour had reached Caligula of the praefect&rsquo;s strange sayings,
    his refusal to enter the temples and to sacrifice to the gods. People said
    that the Anglicanus worshipped one who claimed to be greater than C&aelig;sar
    and all the deities of Rome.</p>
  <p>Well, so be it! There he lay now in the dust, a huddled mass of man and
    beast, the sand of the arena reddened with his blood. Caligula screamed like
    the rest of his people, but his cry was:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Habet! Habet! Habet!&rdquo; And in a frenzy of rage and hate his
    thumb pointed downwards, downwards, as if it were a dagger which he could
    plunge into the Anglicanus&rsquo;  throat.</p>
  <p>But the city guard were the first to break their bounds. Even whilst the
    imperial madman exulted and shrieked forth his murderous &ldquo;Habet!&rdquo; they
    had rushed to the rescue of their praefect.</p>
  <p>The powerful grasp on the panther&rsquo;s throat was on the point of relaxing;
    the brute was digging its claws in the shoulders of the fallen man, and he,
    feeling faint with loss of blood, looked upon death as it stared down at
    him from the beast&rsquo;s golden eyes, and all that he was conscious of
    was the feeling that death was good.</p>
  <p>When the city guard rushed to his rescue, and by dint of numbers and strength
    of steel tore the ferocious creature from the body of its prey, Taurus Antinor
    lay a while half conscious. He heard the cry of the people round him, he
    felt a shower of sweet-scented petals fall upon him from above, he heard
    the last dying roar of the panther and a scream of rage from the imperial
    tribune.</p>
  <p>Then the din became deafening: the trampling of feet, the rushing hither
    and thither, the cries, the imprecations, and from beneath the tribunes in
    their distant prisons, the roar of caged beasts like the far-off rumbling
    of thunder.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor raised himself on his knees. Both his shoulders had been
    lacerated by the panther; he was bleeding from several wounds about the legs
    and arms, and his whole body felt bruised and stiff.</p>
  <p>But he struggled to his feet, and now, leaning against a large tree trunk
    which had formed part of the setting of the scene, he tried to take in every
    detail of what was going on around him. There was, of course, a great deal
    of shouting and a general stampede in the tribunes of the plebs. In the midst
    of this shouting, which buzzed incessantly like the war of a great cataract,
    two cries resounded very distinctly above all the others.</p>
  <p>Thousands of people were shouting:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hail to the praefect! Hail to the god of valour and of strength!
    Hail! Taurus Antinor, hail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whilst others cried more dully, yet equally distinctly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death to the tyrant! Death to the madman! Death to C&aelig;sar! Death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That he himself was for the moment the object of enthusiasm of this irresponsible
    crowd, he could not doubt for an instant. That this same irresponsible enthusiasm
    was leading the crowd to treachery and rebellion was equally certain.</p>
  <p>The city guard egged on by the people had forced open the heavy iron gates
    through which Hortensius Martius had passed a while ago, and which led up
    the marble steps straight to the imperial tribune.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor looking up now saw the C&aelig;sar standing pale and trembling,
    surrounded by his standard bearers, whose attitude seemed strangely irresolute.
    The Augustas were clinging together in obvious terror, their heads were pressed
    close to one another, and the jewels in their hair formed a curious shimmering
    mass of diamonds and rubies which caught the rays of the sun and threw back
    blinding sparks of prismatic colours. Dea Flavia was not near them. She was
    standing alone up against the dividing wall of the tribune, and leaning back
    against it, with eyes closed, and hand pressed against her heart.</p>
  <p>All this did Taurus Antinor see, and also that Hortensius Martius, still
    deathly pale and trembling in every limb, had succeeded in making his way
    from the arcade where he had found safety, back to the patricians&rsquo; tribune
    amongst his friends.</p>
  <p>He was standing now in the midst of a compact group composed of those men
    who had been present two days ago at the banquet in Caius Nepos&rsquo; house.
    They stood close to one another whispering eagerly amongst themselves. Hortensius
    Martius was obviously their chief centre of interest, and young Escanes held
    his hand concealed within the folds of his tunic.</p>
  <p>And Taurus Antinor no longer paused to think. He had forgotten his lacerated
    shoulder and his bleeding limbs; even the horrors of the past quarter of
    an hour had faded from his mind. All that he saw was that murder and treachery
    were walking hand in hand, and that the murder of the insane C&aelig;sar
    now would mean the death of thousands of innocent victims later on, that
    it would mean civil strife, and uncountable misery. And all that he heard
    was the voice of Him Who had bidden him to render unto C&aelig;sar that which
    was C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s, namely his allegiance, his fealty, his life.</p>
  <p>The city guard loved him and knew his voice. He had no trouble in inducing
    the men to let him pass through their ranks and to mount the steps before
    them which led to the imperial tribune. They let him pass perhaps because
    they thought that their praefect would wish to take his revenge with his
    own hands. The gods themselves would have placed a poisoned dagger in the
    hand of him who had been so ruthlessly exposed to a most horrible death.</p>
  <p>And as Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s massive figure was seen to mount the steps,
    the audience broke into cheers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hail Taurus Antinor! the god of valour and of strength!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whilst more ominous than before came that other cry: &ldquo;Death to the
    tyrant! Death to the C&aelig;sar! Death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And whilst the city guard followed closely on the footsteps of their praefect,
    and men among the crowd prepared for the inevitable fight which they foresaw,
    the women and those who were feeble and pacific waved fans and cloaks about
    and threw dead roses across the arena, till the whole place seemed like a
    great pageant of many-coloured flags, over which the midday sun had thrown
    its veil of gold.</p>
  <p>When Taurus Antinor reached the topmost step Caligula caught sight of him,
    and the intensity of his rage was such that his cheeks turned livid and blotchy
    and hoarse inarticulate sounds escaped his panting throat.</p>
  <p>Even at this same moment the group composed of Escanes and the others seemed
    to sway in a mass toward the tribune of the C&aelig;sar. They appeared to
    be consulting Hortensius Martius who had nodded encouragingly. Young Escanes
    was in the very centre of the group now, his hand was still hidden in the
    folds of his tunic and the look in his face told Taurus Antinor all that
    there was to fear.</p>
  <p>At his feet as he stepped into the tribune lay his own cloak which he had
    discarded when first his instinct had prompted him to run to Hortensius&rsquo;  aid.
    Now he picked it up. It was of dark-coloured stuff, unadorned with the usual
    insignia of dignity and rank. With it in his hand he ran quickly toward the
    C&aelig;sar.</p>
  <p>Caligula saw him coming towards him, his yellow teeth were chattering in
    his mouth, he stood there palsied with fear, a prey to a deadly feeling of
    hate and to one of abject terror.</p>
  <p>Even as Taurus Antinor, with a quick gesture, threw his own cloak round
    the shoulders of the C&aelig;sar and whispered hurriedly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let your praetorian guard escort you quickly to your palace, gracious
    lord&mdash;your life is in danger from the people, and....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In danger at thy hands, thou infamous traitor,&rdquo; broke in Caligula
    with a maniacal yell of rage; &ldquo;take this then, in remembrance of the
    C&aelig;sar whom thou hast betrayed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And quick as lightning the madman drew a short poniard from beneath his
    robe, and, uttering a final snarl of satisfied hate and revenge, he plunged
    the dagger in Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s breast.</p>
  <p>Then he snatched the cloak from him, and, wrapping it quickly over his head
    and shoulders, he called wildly to his guard and fled incontinently from
    the spot.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;The sorrows of death compassed me.&rdquo;&mdash;Psalm 18. 4.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia lay upon her bed, with wide-open eyes fixed into vacancy above
    her.</p>
  <p>Afternoon and evening had gone by since that awful moment when the whole
    fell purpose of the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s plan was revealed to her, and she
    saw Hortensius Martius standing unarmed and doomed in the arena, face to
    face with a raging, wild beast. Afternoon and evening had vanished into the
    past since she saw Taurus Antinor, with Hortensius&rsquo; body held high
    over his head, saving one life whilst offering up his own, since she heard
    that deafening cry of horror uttered by two hundred thousand throats when
    the panther sprung upon him unawares and felled him to the ground, whilst
    his blood reddened the sand of the arena.</p>
  <p>Afternoon and evening had swooned in the arms of eternity since she saw
    the terror-stricken C&aelig;sar treacherously stab the man who had rushed
    forward to save him.</p>
  <p>After that last agonising moment she remembered nothing more until she found
    herself in her own house, lying on her bed, with Licinia&rsquo;s anxious,
    wrinkled face bending over her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What hath happened, Licinia?&rdquo; she had asked feebly as soon
    as consciousness had returned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We brought thee home safely, my precious treasure,&rdquo; replied
    the old woman fervently, &ldquo;all praise be unto the gods who watched over
    their beloved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how did it happen?&rdquo; queried Dea with some impatience. &ldquo;Tell
    me all that happened, Licinia,&rdquo; she reiterated with earnest insistence,
    as she raised herself on her elbow and fixed her large blue eyes, in which
    burned a feverish light, upon the face of her slave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! I&rsquo;ll tell thee all I know,&rdquo; rejoined the woman
    soothingly.  &ldquo;Thy slaves were close at hand in the vestibule of the
    imperial tribune, and thy litter was down below with the bearers, in case
    thou shouldst require it. But I had stood on the threshold of the tribune
    for some time watching thee, for thy sweet face had been pale as death all
    the morning, and I feared that the heat would be too much for thee. Thus
    I saw much of what went on. I saw the traitor advance toward the C&aelig;sar,
    trying to smother him with a cloak. I saw the C&aelig;sar&mdash;whom may
    the gods protect&mdash;stab the traitor in the breast, and then leave the
    Amphitheatre hurriedly, followed by a few among his faithful guard. But my
    thoughts then were only of thee. I could see thy lovely face white as the
    maple leaf, and thou wast leaning against the wall as if ready to swoon.
    The traitor whom the C&aelig;sar had justly punished lay bleeding from many
    wounds close to thy foot. The next moment I had thee in my arms, having caught
    thee when thy dear body swayed forward and would have fallen even upon the
    breast of the dead traitor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The traitor?&rdquo; murmured Dea Flavia then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! the praefect of Rome,&rdquo; said Licinia, with a vicious oath. &ldquo;He
    had incited the rabble against the C&aelig;sar, and&mdash;may his dead body
    be defiled for the sacrilege!&mdash;he was causing the populace to acclaim
    him as their Emperor, even whilst he raised his murderous hand against him
    who is the equal of the gods!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was striving to save C&aelig;sar, Licinia, and not to murder him,&rdquo; said
    Dea Flavia earnestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To save the C&aelig;sar? Nay! nay! my precious, the praefect of Rome
    tried to murder C&aelig;sar by smothering him with a cloak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false I tell thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;False? Nay, dear heart, I saw it all, and thou wast beside thyself
    and knew not rightly what happened. Even a minute later thou laidst in my
    arms like a dead white swan, and I pushed my way through the soldiers, and
    past the other Augustas who cowered in the tribune, screaming and wringing
    their hands. Two of thy slaves were luckily close at hand. Together we carried
    thee down to thy litter and bore thee safely home for which to-morrow I will
    offer special sacrifice to Minerva who protected thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what happened after we were gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas! I know not. They say that the populace became more and more
    unruly: there were shouts for the praefect of Rome, who fortunately lay dead
    on the floor of the tribune, and there were even some sacrilegious miscreants
    who called for death upon the C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do they say,&rdquo; queried Dea Flavia, speaking slowly and low, &ldquo;that
    the praefect of Rome is dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he be not dead now,&rdquo; retorted Licinia viciously, for her
    loyalty to the C&aelig;sar was bound up with her love for Dea Flavia, and
    treachery to C&aelig;sar meant treachery to her beloved, &ldquo;If he be
    not dead now, he shall still suffer for his treason: and if he be dead his
    body shall be defiled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! a traitor must suffer even in death. His body shall be given
    to the dogs, his blood to the carrion....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, Licinia!&rdquo; broke in Dea Flavia sternly, &ldquo;fill
    not mine ears with thy hideous talk. Every word thou dost utter is impiety
    and sacrilege, and I would smite thee for them had I but the strength.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I am so tired,&rdquo; she added after a slight pause, with a
    weary little sigh, even whilst Licinia, subdued and frightened, stood silently
    by: &ldquo;I would like to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then sleep, my goddess,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    watch over thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! I could not sleep if I were watched,&rdquo; rejoined Dea
    Flavia with the fretfulness of a tired child. &ldquo;I would rather be alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But thou&rsquo;lt have bad dreams.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Order Blanca to lie across the threshold. I can then send her to
    fetch thee, if I have need of thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would rather lie across thy threshold myself,&rdquo; muttered the
    old woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good Licinia, do as I tell thee,&rdquo; said Dea, now with marked
    impatience.  &ldquo;And&mdash;stay&mdash;&rdquo; she added as Licinia still
    grumbling prepared reluctantly to obey&mdash;&rdquo;I pray thee find out
    for me all that is going on in the city. Mayhap Tertius will know what has
    happened&mdash;or Piso.... Go seek them, Licinia, and find out all that there
    is to know, so that thou canst tell me everything anon, when I wake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She lay back on her bed with closed eyes whilst Licinia kissed her hands
    and feet, re-arranged the embroidered coverlet and the downy cushions, and
    after a while shuffled out of the room.</p>
  <p>There was nothing that the old woman loved better than a gossip with Tertius,
    who was the comptroller of the Augusta&rsquo;s household, or with Piso, who
    was the overseer of her slaves: and even her fond desire to watch beside
    her mistress yielded to the delight of holding long and interesting parley
    with these worthies.</p>
  <p>So it was with considerable alacrity that&mdash;having deputed the young
    girl, Blanca, to watch over her mistress&mdash;she made her way through the
    atrium, and thence across the vast peristyle to the quarters of the slaves.</p>
  <p>Tertius&mdash;the comptroller&mdash;had, it appears, sallied forth into
    the streets, despite the lateness of the hour, in the hope of gleaning some
    information as to what was going on in the city. Even in this secluded portion
    of the Palatine, where stood the house of Dea Flavia under the shelter of
    the surrounding palaces, weird sounds of human cries and of the clashing
    of steel was penetrating with ominous persistency.</p>
  <p>Piso&mdash;the overseer&mdash;who had remained at home, as he did not feel
    sufficiently valiant to face once again the disturbance outside, told Licinia
    all that he had witnessed before he finally found safe haven at home.</p>
  <p>It seemed that the tumult in the Amphitheatre had not ceased with the flight
    of the Emperor, rather that it had grown in intensity when the populace saw
    the praefect of Rome fall backwards, stabbed by the C&aelig;sar, and the
    latter disappear hurriedly, followed by a few from among the praetorian guard.</p>
  <p>There was no doubt that the temper of the populace had been over-excited
    by the cruel scenes of a while ago; lust of blood and of tyranny had been
    fanned to fever-pitch through those very spectacles which the C&aelig;sar
    himself had provided for the people, with a view to satisfying his own ferocious
    desires of hate and of revenge.</p>
  <p>Now that same fever-heated temper was turning against him, who had fanned
    it for his own ends.</p>
  <p>Caligula had made good his escape, satisfied that his dagger had done its
    work upon the arch-traitor. He had fled through the private entrance of his
    tribune, and his guard had rallied round him. But a company of legionaries&mdash;some
    five or six hundred strong&mdash;was still in the place, as well as his knights
    and all his friends, and against these did the wrath of the rabble turn.</p>
  <p>The lawless and the rough soon had it all their own way, and the peaceable
    citizen who would have liked to get wife and children safely out of the crowd
    found it well-nigh impossible to make his way through the throng.</p>
  <p>After a few moments the disturbance became general; there was a great deal
    of shouting and presently missiles began to fly about. The rabble attacked
    the legionaries and a sanguinary conflict ensued. The former was in overwhelming
    number and succeeded in breaking the rank of the soldiers, and in putting
    them momentarily to rout.</p>
  <p>After this there was a general stampede down and along the gradients of
    the Amphitheatre, during which hundreds of persons&mdash;including women
    and children&mdash;were crushed to death. The scene of confusion seems to
    have baffled description. Piso, who had succeeded in making his way home
    in the midst of it all, had even now to wipe his brow, which was streaming
    with perspiration at the recollection of the horrors which he had witnessed.</p>
  <p>Whilst he proceeded with his narrative, Tertius had returned with further
    news. And these, of a truth, were very alarming. The lower slopes of the
    Palatine, as well as the Forum and the surrounding streets, were now in the
    hands of the mob. The few legions who were in the city had been cut off from
    the Palatine, and though they were making vigorous efforts to break through
    the close ranks of the crowd, they had, up to this hour, been wholly unsuccessful,
    owing no doubt to the paucity of their numbers, since the bulk of the army
    was not yet home from that insensate and mock expedition into Germany.</p>
  <p>The whole of the troops in and around the city, including the town and praetorian
    guard, was on this day computed at less than one thousand, and the mob&mdash;so
    Tertius averred&mdash;was over one hundred thousand strong.</p>
  <p>The law-abiding citizens had locked themselves up in the fastnesses of their
    homes, and the C&aelig;sar&mdash;so it was believed&mdash;was inside his
    palace with a small detachment of his guard around him, one hundred strong,
    who already had had to repel numerous attacks delivered by the more forward
    amongst the rabble.</p>
  <p>Tertius had not been able to get far beyond the precincts of the house,
    for fear had driven him back. The shouts which came from the streets below
    and from the Forum were ominous and threatening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death to the C&aelig;sar! Death to the tyrant!&rdquo; could be distinctly
    heard above the din of stampeding feet, and a low and constant murmur that
    sounded like distant thunder.</p>
  <p>There was no doubt that the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s life was in grave danger,
    seeing that only a handful of men stood between him and the fury of an excited
    populace; and these men were without a leader, for the praetorian praefect
    had been cut off from them, even as he tried to push his way through the
    crowd earlier in the day.</p>
  <p>Thus, therefore, did this harbinger of evil news resume the situation. Caligula
    was in his palace, surrounded by the slaves of his household and guarded
    by a few soldiers against a raging mob&mdash;an hundred thousand or more
    strong&mdash;who had formed a ring around the Palatine, and was clamouring
    for the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s death. The legionaries, under the command of
    faithful Centurions, were cut off from the Palatine and from their C&aelig;sar
    by the mob whose solid ranks they had hitherto been unable to break. The
    Augustas and their slaves were also safe within their palaces.</p>
  <p>But what Tertius did not know, and was therefore unable to impart to his
    eager listeners was that the party of conspirators, with Hortensius Martius
    as their acknowledged leader, were taking advantage of the disturbance to
    place themselves at the head of the mob, hoping that the cry of &ldquo;Death
    to Caligula!&rdquo; would soon be followed by one of &ldquo;Hail to the C&aelig;sar!
    the new C&aelig;sar, Hortensius Martius! Hail!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Watchman, what of the night?&rdquo;&mdash;Isaiah 21. 11.</p>
  <p>And far away beyond the noise and tumult which ranged around the foot of
    the Palatine, the honey-coloured moon illumined with her weird and ghostly
    light the vast arena of the gigantic Amphitheatre, where a company of the
    town guard, under the command of an aedile, were busy collecting the dead.</p>
  <p>A narrow streak of those same ghostly rays found its way through the folds
    of the curtains which spanned the window of Dea Flavia&rsquo;s room. It peeped
    in boldly, stirring up myriads of impalpable atoms and whipping them into
    a living line of silver. It wandered further, and finding a golden head that
    tossed restlessly upon a silk-covered pillow, it alighted on it, making the
    white face appear ghostlier still, and the wide eyes to shine like stars.</p>
  <p>A timid step shuffled across the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blanca, is it thou?&rdquo; whispered Dea Flavia, as quickly she raised
    herself up, squatting now upon the bed, with one hand pressed against the
    pillow and the other to her breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, mistress, it is I!&rdquo; came in whispered response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well? Have they returned?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! gracious lady. Half an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did they find him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is he...?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a pause, whilst from afar came that strange low sound of thousands
    of men murmuring, which is so akin to the booming of the waves upon a rocky
    shore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The praefect of Rome was in a swoon when they found him in the imperial
    tribune,&rdquo; said the young slave-girl, still speaking under her breath. &ldquo;Nolus
    and Dion carried him to the litter, and once or twice he groaned whilst they
    carried him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A gentle breeze wafted the curtains into the room; the rays of the waning
    moon fell full upon the huddled figure on the bed, with the stream of gold
    falling each side of the set, pale face, and the large blue eyes now strangely
    veiled with tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is ... where is the praefect now?&rdquo; asked Dea Flavia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the room out of thy studio, gracious mistress, as thou didst direct.
    Dion did prepare a couch for him there, and hath laid him down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the physician?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The physician hath seen him. He saith that the praefect is weak with
    loss of blood. His shoulders, arms and legs have been torn by the panther&rsquo;s
    claws, but these wounds are not deep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And ... and the dagger thrust?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The physician saith that the dagger must have glanced off the bone.
    I did not quite understand what he said, and Dion explained it badly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He did not say that there was poison in the dagger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think not, gracious lady; for the physician said that the praefect
    would soon be well if he were carefully tended. He is very weak with loss
    of blood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did Nolus and Dion find it difficult to approach the praefect&rsquo;s
    body?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They had to parley with the aedile who was in command, and to give
    him all the money which my gracious mistress did entrust to them for that
    purpose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After which the aedile made no demur ... and asked no questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The aedile took the money, gracious lady, and Dion said that he asked
    no further questions, but allowed the praefect to be borne away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said Dea Flavia, after a brief moment of silence,
    whilst the girl stood awaiting her further pleasure. &ldquo;Thou, Blanca,
    hath served me faithfully, so have Nolus and Dion, my slaves. Ye have earned
    your reward, and though I am grieved to part from good servants like you,
    yet will I fulfil my promise, even as I have given it to you. From this hour,
    thou, Blanca, art a freewoman, and Nolus thy brother, and Dion, thy future
    husband, are freemen, and the sum of six hundred aurei shall be given unto
    you to-morrow&mdash;two hundred unto each&mdash;and may you live long and
    prosper and be happy, for you have served me well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Blanca fell upon her knees and kissed the coverlet on which reposed her
    mistress; but Dea Flavia did not seem to see her. She was squatting on her
    heels, with body and head erect, and slowly now, like the rosy kiss of dawn
    upon the snow-clad hills of Etruria, a faint crimson glow spread over her
    pale cheeks.</p>
  <p>Blanca waited irresolute, not liking to leave her mistress before she could
    be assured that sleep had descended at last on those weary lids. The hour
    was very late, close upon midnight, and yet the city was not asleep. That
    constant murmur&mdash;like unto the breaking of angry waves&mdash;still sent
    its sinister echo through the still night air, and even in the house of Dea
    Flavia it seemed that hundreds of eyes were still open, fear having chased
    sleep away. There was a sound&mdash;like the buzzing of bees&mdash;that came
    from the slaves&rsquo; quarters beyond the peristyle, and from the studio,
    which lay the other side of the atrium, came the sound of muffled footsteps
    gliding over the mosaic of the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go to bed now, child,&rdquo; said Dea Flavia at last, &ldquo;thou
    hast earned thy rest ... and ... stay! Tell Dion and Nolus to remain in the
    studio, and there to spend the night. They must be ready to go to the praefect
    if he calls.... Go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as the girl made ready to obey, the Augusta put out her hand to detain
    her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait! Hast seen Licinia?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, gracious lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is not hovering somewhere near my room?... or in the atrium?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, gracious lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the night-watchers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are in the vestibule, gracious lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And all my women?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are all in bed and asleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is well. Thou canst go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Blanca&rsquo;s naked little feet made no sound as she crossed the room,
    and went out by the door which led to the sleeping-chamber of the Augusta&rsquo;s
    women.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia waited for a while, straining her ears to catch every sound which
    came from this portion of her palace.</p>
  <p>Her sleeping-chamber, together with all those on this floor gave directly
    on the atrium, which formed a large irregular square in the centre of this
    portion of the house. The north side of it was taken up with the Augusta&rsquo;s
    apartments and those of her women, the south side with the reception rooms
    and with the studio and its attendant vestibules, whilst the main vestibule
    of the house and the first peristyle gave on either end.</p>
  <p>From the main vestibule came the subdued hum of voices, and throughout the
    house there was that feeling of wakefulness so different to the usual placid
    hush of night.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia held her breath whilst she listened attentively. In the vestibule
    it was the night watchmen who were talking, discussing, no doubt, the many
    events of the day: and that sound&mdash;like the buzzing of bees&mdash;showed
    that the women were awake and gossiping, and that up in the slaves&rsquo; quarters
    tongues were still wagging, despite Blanca&rsquo;s assurance and the overseer&rsquo;s
    sharp discipline. But on the other side of the atrium, where were the reception
    halls and the studio, everything was still.</p>
  <p>The young girl threw herself back upon her bed. Sleep refused to visit her
    this night; the thin streak of silvery moon, which persistently peeped in
    through the curtain, flicked the tiny atoms in the air until they assumed
    quaint, minute shapes of their own, like unto crawling panthers and grotesque
    creatures crowned with a golden halo, and brandishing a mock thunderbolt
    in one hand and a dagger in the other. Then suddenly all these shapes would
    vanish, smothered beneath a cloak, and Dea Flavia, still wide awake, would
    feel drops of moisture at the roots of her hair, and her whole body, as if
    sinking into a black abyss, where monsters yelled and wild beasts roared
    and huge, black, snake-like creatures tore the flesh off human bones.</p>
  <p>The hours of the night sped on, borne on the weighted feet of anguish and
    of horror. Gradually, one by one, the sounds in and about the house died
    away; the slaves in their quarters must have turned over on their rough pallets
    and gone to sleep, the women close by had done gossiping, only from the vestibule
    came the slow measured tread of the watchmen guarding the Augusta&rsquo;s
    house, and from far away that ceaseless, rumbling noise which meant that
    discontent was awake and astir.</p>
  <p>Once more Dea Flavia sat up, unable to lie still. Her golden hair was matted
    against her temples and in her breast her heart was beating furiously. The
    waning moon had long since now sunk behind the western clouds, a gentle breeze
    stirred the curtains with a soft, sighing noise as of some human creature
    in pain. In the far corner of the room, in a tiny lamp of gold, a tiny wick
    threw a feeble light around.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia put her feet to the ground. The heat in the room was oppressive;
    no doubt it was that which had caused her restlessness, and the dampness
    of her brow. She shuddered now when her bare feet touched the smooth coldness
    of the mosaic floor, but she stood up resolutely, and anon crossed over to
    the door which gave on the atrium.</p>
  <p>For a few seconds she listened. Everything was still. Then very gently she
    pushed open the door.</p>
  <p>On the marble table, in the centre of the atrium, another light glimmered
    in a jewelled lamp; but the atrium was vast and the diminutive light did
    not reach its far corners. The gentle trickle of water along the gutters
    in the floor made queer, ghost-like sounds, and in the great pots of lilies
    all round currents of air sent weird moanings in the night.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia, like an ethereal figure clad all in white, and with waves of
    golden hair shimmering over the whiteness of her gown, glided softly across
    the atrium.</p>
  <p>A tiny vestibule led into the studio, she crossed it, guided by her knowledge
    of the place, for the light in the atrium did not penetrate to this recess.
    Her bare feet made no noise as she glided along the floor, her hand pushed
    the door open without raising a sound.</p>
  <p>Now she was in the studio. The place in which she did the work that she
    loved, the place in which day after day she loved to sit and to idle away
    the hours. In an angle of the room, stretched out upon the bare floor, Dion
    and Nolus were lying, their even breathing showing that they slept. On the
    right was another door, which led to an inner chamber, where she oft used
    to retire for rest from her work. It was a private sanctum which none dared
    enter save with special permission from herself. Blanca kept it swept and
    free from dust, and Licinia tidied it only when she was so allowed.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia went across the studio and pushed open the door. It was masked
    by a curtain, and this too she pulled aside, slowly and nervously like some
    small animal that is timid and yet venturesome. She knew every corner of
    the place of course, and the very creaking of the hinges and gentle swish
    of the curtain was a familiar sound to her ear.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless she was almost frightened to advance, for the big dark shadow
    right across the stuccoed wall awed her by its mysterious blackness. It was
    caused by a large object in the centre of the room, a couch covered with
    coverlets of soft, white woollen stuffs, on which the night-light burning
    fitfully threw patches of ruddy lights.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia had paused on the threshold, with one hand behind her still clinging
    to the curtain, the other pressed hard on her bosom, trying to still the
    wild beatings which went on hammering inside her just below her breasts.
    She thought that she either must be dreaming now, or being awake, must have
    been dreaming before.</p>
  <p>Once or twice she closed and then reopened her eyes, thinking that perhaps
    the flickering night-light was playing her drowsy senses some elusive trick.
    For surely Blanca had told her that Dion and Nolus had laid the praefect
    of Rome on an improvised couch in the chamber beside the studio, and that
    the praefect was helpless and weak with pain and loss of blood.</p>
  <p>The improvised couch was certainly in its place, the light of the lamp danced
    upon pillow and coverlet, but no one was lying there, even though the pillow
    still bore the impress of the head which had rested on it.</p>
  <p>The silence was oppressive, for through the thick walls and heavy curtains
    of the Augusta&rsquo;s favourite room there penetrated no sound from without,
    and she herself stood so still, so still by the door, that she was sure the
    beatings of her heart must be heard through that awful stillness.</p>
  <p>Suddenly she started, and her fingers closed more convulsively than before
    on the curtain behind her. Imperceptible as the sound of a swallow on the
    wing, there came a long-drawn sigh to her ear. Her brow contracted, her eyes
    narrowed in a great effort to peer past the light into the darkness.</p>
  <p>On the further side of the couch now and masked by its shadow, she saw something
    that was immovable and yet seemed pulsating with life. Gradually as she peered,
    that something detached itself from the surrounding gloom. She saw a bowed
    head with wealth of tawny hair which gleamed like copper against the white
    coverlet, two hands white as the pillow beside which they rested, whiter
    still by contrast with the copper of the hair against them; she saw a pair
    of broad shoulders, and a powerful body and limbs that lost themselves in
    the darkness beyond the couch.</p>
  <p>The face was hidden and the body was quite still. It would have seemed like
    that of the dead but for that long sigh, which, intangible though it was,
    had broken the silence of the night.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia could not now have moved, even if she would. Her small bare feet
    seemed glued to the cold mosaic of the floor, her hand seemed fastened with
    clamps of steel to the curtain which it clutched.</p>
  <p>She had never seen a man thus kneeling alone in the stillness and in the
    gloom. Why should a man kneel thus? and to whom?</p>
  <p>Yet she would not have disturbed him, not for all the world. She never dreamed
    that he would be awake; she had thought of him lying&mdash;as Blanca said&mdash;exhausted
    from loss of blood.</p>
  <p>She had only meant to look on him for a moment, to look into his face as
    he slept, to try and read in its wonted harsh lines the secrets of his soul.</p>
  <p>He had rushed to the C&aelig;sar trying to protect him, when thousands on
    thousands of throats were acclaiming his name as future lord of Rome. Why?</p>
  <p>He had rushed into the arena and risked his life to save a man who two days
    ago had insulted him, who&mdash;at best&mdash;was nothing to him. Why?</p>
  <p>These questions she had meant to ask him when he was sleeping: now she could
    not ask them from that bowed head, nor yet from those clasped hands. And
    yet, somehow, it seemed that something of the man&rsquo;s soul was revealed
    to her at this moment, though she could not as yet fathom the meaning of
    this strange answer to her questions.</p>
  <p>Her eyes had become quite accustomed to the darkness beyond the light. She
    could see clearly the powerful figure on bended knees, the wide shoulders
    with the bandages disposed over them by the physician for the healing of
    those horrible wounds, and the fingers linked together in a manner which
    she had never seen before. And now the hands stirred ever so slightly, the
    light caught the fingers more directly, and Dea Flavia saw that&mdash;clasped
    between them&mdash;there was a small wooden cross.</p>
  <p>And she knew now&mdash;all in a moment&mdash;that the answer to her questions
    lay there before her, not in the man&rsquo;s face, for that she could not
    see, but in his clasped hands and in the cross which they held. She knew
    that it was because of it&mdash;or rather because of that which had gone
    before, and of which that little cross was the tangible memory&mdash;that
    he had been ready to give his life for an enemy, and to give up all ambition
    and all pride for the sake of his allegiance to C&aelig;sar!</p>
  <p>A sigh must have escaped her lips, or merely just the indrawing of her breath;
    certain it is that something caused the kneeling man to stir. He raised his
    head very slowly, and then looked up straight across the light&mdash;to her.</p>
  <p>For one second he remained quite still, on his knees and with that white
    vision before him, ghost-like and silent, against the crimson background
    of the curtain. Then softly, as a sigh, one word escaped his lips:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dea!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rose to his feet but already she had fled, noiselessly as she had come,
    but swiftly across the studio and the atrium and back to her room, but even
    while she fled it seemed to her that on the silent night air there still
    trembled the sound of a voice, vibrating with longing and with passion, mournful
    as a sigh, appealing as the call of a bird to its mate:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dea!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.&rdquo;&mdash;Isaiah
    48. 22.</p>
  <p>When after a few hours of light and troubled sleep Dea Flavia woke to partial
    consciousness, it seemed to her as if Phoebus Apollo had been driving his
    chariot through a sea of blood; for through the folds of the curtains over
    the windows she caught a glimpse of the sky, and it was of vivid crimson.</p>
  <p>The heat was oppressive, and as the young girl tossed with ever increasing
    restlessness on the pillows, beads of moisture rose on her forehead and matted
    the fair curls against her temples.</p>
  <p>She felt too tired to get up, even though she vaguely marvelled how wonderful
    must be the dawn, since its reflection was of such lurid colour. She lay
    back drowsy and with nerves tingling; she closed her eyes for they ached
    and burned intolerably.</p>
  <p>Gradually to her half-aroused consciousness sounds too began to penetrate.
    It seemed to her that the usual stately quietude of her house was gravely
    disturbed this morning, shuffling footsteps could be heard moving across
    the atrium, voices&mdash;scarce subdued&mdash;were whispering audibly, and
    the shouts of the overseers echoed from across the peristyle, and through
    it all a dull, monotonous sound, distant as yet and faint, came at long intervals,
    the sound of Jove&rsquo;s thunder over the Campania far away.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia listened more intently, and one by one through the veil which
    kindly sleep had drawn over her memory, the events of the past day and night
    knocked at the portals of her brain.</p>
  <p>She remembered everything now, and with this sudden onrush of memory of
    the past, came fuller consciousness of the present.</p>
  <p>Through the hum of varied noises which filled her own house, she distinguished
    presently more strange, more ominous sounds that came from afar, like the
    thunders of Jove, and like them sounded weird and threatening in her ear;
    hoarse cries and shouts which seemed like peremptory commands, and groans
    that rose above the muffled din with calls of terror and of pain.</p>
  <p>In a moment Dea Flavia had put her feet to the ground. She ran to the window,
    drew back the curtains and peered into the narrow street which, at this point,
    separated her house from the rear of the Palace of Tiberius.</p>
  <p>A dull grey light enveloped the city in its mantle of gloom, and it was
    not the torch of Phoebus which had spread the rosy gleam of dawn over the
    sky! As Dea Flavia looked, she saw a canopy of dull crimson over her head,
    and from beyond the Palace of Tiberius there rose at intervals heavy banks
    of purple smoke.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia stood there for one moment at the window, paralysed with the
    dread of what she saw and of what she guessed, and even as a cry of horror
    died within her throat, Licinia, with grey hair flying loosely round her
    pale face, and hands held out before her with an agonised gesture of fear,
    came running into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The miscreants! the miscreants!&rdquo; she shouted as she threw herself
    down on to the floor before her young mistress and squatted there on her
    heels, wringing her hands and uttering moans of terror. &ldquo;They have
    set fire to the palace! They are on us, my beloved! Save thyself! Save thy
    house! Oh ye gods! protect us all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The awesome news which Licinia thus blurted out was but a confirmation of
    what Dea had already feared. Every drop of blood within her seemed to turn
    to ice, horror gripped her heart, the oncoming catastrophe appeared suddenly
    before her, vivid, swift and inevitable. But she contrived to steady her
    voice and to appear outwardly calm as she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not understand thee, Licinia, speak more clearly. What is it
    that hath happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The rabble are invading the Palatine,&rdquo; said Licinia, to the
    accompaniment of many groans. &ldquo;They are on us I tell thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On us!&rdquo; retorted Dea Flavia scornfully. &ldquo;Tush, woman!
    they&rsquo;ll not heed us.... But the C&aelig;sar ... Hast news of the C&aelig;sar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! my beloved, I have no news. I only know what the watchmen
    say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That the rabble is invading the hill. The miscreants have forced
    their way into the Forum. They have surrounded the palace of the C&aelig;sar
    and set fire within its precincts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye gods!...&rdquo; exclaimed Dea Flavia.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost hear their shouts? the villains! the villains! Dost hear Jove&rsquo;s
    thunder, my beloved? His vengeance is nigh! May his curse descend on the
    villains and on their children.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, woman!&rdquo; commanded the Augusta peremptorily. &ldquo;Get
    me a robe&mdash;quickly&mdash;no, no! not that one,&rdquo; she added, as
    Licinia, with trembling hands had snatched up the gorgeous jewel-studded
    gown which Dea Flavia had worn the day before, &ldquo;a dark robe&mdash;haste,
    I tell thee! go thou fetch it and send Blanca quickly to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Moaning and trembling, the woman endeavoured to obey and to make as much
    speed as her limbs, paralysed with terror, would allow her. She called to
    Blanca, who together with the Augusta&rsquo;s tire-women had her quarters
    close at hand, and the young girl hastened to her mistress&rsquo;s room whilst
    Licinia went in search of a dark-coloured robe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The praefect?&rdquo; whispered Dea Flavia quickly, as soon as she
    felt assured that she was quite alone with her slave. &ldquo;Hast seen Dion
    or Nolus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My brother spoke to me in the atrium just now, gracious mistress,&rdquo;  replied
    Blanca, who seemed scarce less excited than her mistress, &ldquo;he and Dion
    heard a thud in the night, which roused them from a brief sleep which they
    had snatched, for they were very tired ... their long hunt in the Amphitheatre....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! go on! I know that they slept ... and they heard a thud
    ... what was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They ran to the resting-chamber, gracious lady, and found the praefect
    of Rome lying senseless on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great Mother!... and what did they do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They lifted him as best they could; for the praefect is over tall
    and mightily powerful. But they succeeded in laying him back on to the couch,
    and Dion ran to rouse the physician.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The physician hath given the praefect a drug to make him sleep, for
    it seems that fever was upon him with the pain of his wounds and he talked
    incoherently like one bereft of reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!...&rdquo; interrupted Dea Flavia hurriedly, &ldquo;not before
    Licinia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even as she spoke the old woman returned, carrying a robe of dove grey cloth,
    the darkest one that she could find. She had collected the tire-women round
    her, and they flocked in her wake like frightened sheep that have been driven
    into a pen. Licinia herself was evidently the prey of abject terror, for
    her teeth were chattering, and all the while that she helped her mistress
    to make a hasty toilet, she uttered low moans as if she were in pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The traitors! the miscreants!&rdquo; she murmured at intervals.</p>
  <p>But Dea Flavia paid no heed to her. Her women had brought her fresh water,
    perfumes and fine cloths, and she was hastily bathing her face and hands.
    Then, she slipped on the dull-coloured robe and Licinia&rsquo;s trembling
    fingers fastened a girdle round her waist.</p>
  <p>And all the while, from far away, came the dull sound of Jove&rsquo;s thunders
    hurled by his wrath, and above it as a constant din, like the roaring of
    a tempestuous sea, the hoarse cries which&mdash;borne upon the wings of the
    oncoming storm&mdash;seemed to gain distinctness as their echo reached this
    distant house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost hear the cries, Blanca?&rdquo; asked Dea Flavia, as the young
    slave, leaning out of the narrow window tried to peer out into the street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hear them, gracious lady,&rdquo; replied the girl in an awed whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And canst distinguish any words?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, one word, gracious lady ... Hark!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And that word sent its dismal echo even to Dea Flavia&rsquo;s ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Blanca uttered a terrified scream and quickly drew away from the window;
    from beyond the Palace of Tiberius, there where the new Palace of Caligula
    reared its gigantic marble pillars above the temples below, a huge column
    of flames had shot upwards to the sky. And a cry, louder than before and
    more distinct, came clearly from afar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death to the C&aelig;sar! Death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye gods protect him,&rdquo; murmured Dea Flavia fervently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll murder him! they&rsquo;ll murder him!&rdquo; shouted
    Licinia at the top of her trembling voice.</p>
  <p>She had fallen on her knees and the other women squatted round her like
    a huddled-up mass of terror-stricken humanity, with hair undone and pale,
    quivering lips and staring eyes dilated with fear.</p>
  <p>But Dea Flavia, now that she was dressed, took no further notice of them;
    she left them there on the floor, moaning and whimpering, and hurried out
    into the atrium. Here too the sense of terror filled the air. Beyond the
    colonnaded arcade in the corridors and the peristyle could be seen groups
    of slaves&mdash;men and women&mdash;squatting together with head meeting
    head in eager gossip, or clinging to one another in a state of abject cowardice.</p>
  <p>Here too, through the open vestibule, the sounds from the streets came louder
    and more clear. That awful cry of &ldquo;Death&rdquo; echoed with appalling
    distinctness, and to Dea Flavia&rsquo;s strained senses it seemed as if they
    were mingled with others, more awesome mayhap, but equally ominous of &ldquo;The
    praefect of Rome! Where is the praefect of Rome! Hail! Taurus Antinor! Hail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The noise grew louder and louder, and from where she stood now&mdash;it
    seemed to her that she could trace in her mind the progress of the rebels,
    as they spread themselves from the foot of the Palatine and from the Forum,
    upwards to the heights until they had the palace of the C&aelig;sar completely
    surrounded.</p>
  <p>It was from there that weird cries of terror came incessantly, and in imagination
    Dea saw an army of cowardly, panic-stricken slaves, huddled together as her
    own women had been, with palsied limbs and chattering teeth, whilst a handful
    of faithful men of the praetorian guard were alone left to protect the sacred
    person of the C&aelig;sar.</p>
  <p>Above her, through the apertures in the tiled roof, she could see the sky
    aglow with lurid crimson, and the smell of burning wood and of charred stuffs
    filled her nostrils with their pungent odour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death to the C&aelig;sar! Death!&rdquo; The cry seemed almost at
    her door. Only the Palace of Tiberius, with its great empty halls and basilicas
    stood between her and the rallying-point of the rebels.</p>
  <p>She called loudly for Tertius&mdash;her comptroller&mdash;and he came running
    along from the slaves&rsquo; quarters with an army of howling men and women
    at his heels.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What news, Tertius?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Hast heard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They have surrounded the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s palace,&rdquo; said
    Tertius excitedly,  &ldquo;and demand his presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! the sacrilege!...&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;and what doth
    the C&aelig;sar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He will not appear, and his guards charge the mob as they advance
    upwards from the Forum. They have invaded the temple of Castor, and already
    some are swarming in the vestibules of the palace. The guard are behind the
    colonnades and were holding the crowd at bay with fair success until....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until some of the rebels skirting the palace, set fire to the slaves&rsquo;  quarters
    in the rear. The flames are spreading. The C&aelig;sar will be forced to
    face the people, an he doth not mean to be buried beneath the crumbling walls
    of his palace!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The miscreants have set fire to the palace of the C&aelig;sars?&rdquo; she
    exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;they will force the C&aelig;sar
    to show himself to them. And they loudly demand the praefect of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The praefect of Rome?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, gracious lady. The people had thought that the C&aelig;sar killed
    him; some strove, it seems, to recover his body in the imperial tribune,
    where he was seen to fall. But the body had disappeared, and the rumour hath
    gained ground that the C&aelig;sar had it thrown to his dogs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; she cried out involuntarily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, gracious lady. Men of sense do know that it is not true. But
    an infuriated mob hath no sense. It is like an overgrown child, with thousands
    of irresponsible limbs. It is tossed hither and thither, swayed by the wind
    of a chance word. But it were as well, mayhap, if it were true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, Tertius, how canst say such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think of the C&aelig;sar, gracious lady,&rdquo; rejoined the man
    simply, &ldquo;and of thee. If the mob found the praefect of Rome now alive
    or dead, then surely would they murder the C&aelig;sar and make of the praefect
    their Emperor if he lived, their god if he were dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And as if to confirm the man&rsquo;s words, the morning breeze wafted through
    the air the prolonged and insistent cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Taurus Antinor! Hail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a curt word, Dea dismissed her comptroller, and he went, followed by
    his train of shrieking men and women.</p>
  <p>She remained a while silent and alone in the atrium, while the moanings
    of the slaves and Tertius&rsquo; rough admonitions to them died away in the
    distance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If the mob found the praefect of Rome now alive or dead,&rdquo; she
    murmured,  &ldquo;then surely would they murder the C&aelig;sar and make
    of the praefect their Emperor if he lived, their god if he were dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia cast a quick glance all round her. The atrium itself was deserted,
    even though from every side beyond its colonnaded arcade came the sound of
    many voices and those persistent, cowardly groanings which set the young
    girl&rsquo;s nerves tingling and caused her heart to sink within her, with
    the presage of impending doom.</p>
  <p>Only in the vestibule the watchmen sat alert and prepared to guard the Augusta&rsquo;s
    house; they were gossiping among themselves and seemed the only men in the
    place who were not wholly panic-stricken.</p>
  <p>The hum of their voices sounded quite reassuring in the midst of the senseless
    groans of terror which came from the women&rsquo;s quarters near the Augusta&rsquo;s
    rooms, as well as from the men in the more remote parts of the house.</p>
  <p>After that brief moment of hesitation Dea went resolutely toward the studio.
    She crossed its small vestibule and pushed open the door.</p>
  <p>Dion was sitting there on guard as the Augusta had commanded. He rose when
    she entered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The praefect?&rdquo; she asked hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He sleeps,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Art sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I peeped in but a few moments ago. His eyes are closed. I think that
    he sleeps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would wish to make sure,&rdquo; she said curtly.</p>
  <p>Too well-trained, or mayhap too indifferent to show surprise at so strange
    a desire on the part of the great and gracious Augusta, Dion stood aside
    respectfully to allow her to pass, then he followed her to the door of the
    inner room and held aside the heavy curtain, whilst she put her hand upon
    the latch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dion,&rdquo; she said, turning back to him, &ldquo;yesterday I gave
    thee thy freedom, since thou didst serve me well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, gracious lady,&rdquo; replied the man as he bent the knee in
    submissive respect, &ldquo;and I would kiss thy feet for this, thy graciousness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When the city is once more at peace, we&rsquo;ll before the quaestor,
    and thou and Nolus and Blanca shall all be declared free. But to-day thou
    art still my slave and must obey me in all things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As thou dost command, gracious lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, &rsquo;tis silence that I do enjoin on thee, Dion,&rdquo; she
    said earnestly,  &ldquo;silence as to the praefect&rsquo;s presence in my
    house, until I bid thee speak: on pain of death, Dion, for thou art still
    my slave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand, gracious lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then wait for me now and on peril of thy life allow no one to enter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But scarce had these words crossed her lips than there rose from the atrium
    behind her a series of weird sounds, cries, and imprecations, calls for the
    Augusta and curses on her slaves, as from one who is bereft of reason and
    screams in his madness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; she murmured, as white to the lips now, she
    stood rigid by the door whilst her hand fell from the latch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Augusta! Augusta!&rdquo; came the hoarse cries from the atrium, and
    the hideous, familiar sound of leather thongs whistling through the air reached
    her straining senses.</p>
  <p>She put a finger to her lips, with a quick peremptory gesture to Dion, then
    she recrossed the studio with a firm step and the curtains of the inner door
    fell back behind her with a swish.</p>
  <p>The next moment she was standing in the atrium facing Caligula, the C&aelig;sar.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!&rdquo;&mdash;Isaiah
    14. 12.</p>
  <p>He had a score or so of his guard with him and they remained at some little
    distance, in a compact group, with their short, bronze-hilted swords naked
    in their hands.</p>
  <p>Caligula was livid. He had donned a dark woollen robe and his head was uncovered.
    His knees, arms and hands were shaking and his mouth opened and closed as
    if he were gasping for breath. His eyes were bloodshot and staring out of
    his head like those of a man who is being strangled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gracious C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; exclaimed Dea Flavia as soon as she
    was before him, and with the instinct born of long usage, she bent the knee
    before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They have trapped me,&rdquo; he murmured inarticulately whilst weird
    choking sounds escaped his throat. &ldquo;They have trapped me, hast heard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The miscreants! the sacrilegious miscreants! the hideous monsters!
    the villainous reptiles! Aye! punishment will overtake them; they shall rue
    this day! All Rome shall rue this day: her streets shall flow with blood
    and I&rsquo;ll invent such tortures for every man as will turn the firmament
    red with horror ... I&rsquo;ll....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His mouth was twitching convulsively and his hands clutched spasmodically
    at his throat. Dea Flavia had risen to her feet, she stood before this raging
    madman erect and calm, with eyes downcast, for the sight of him filled her
    with loathing.</p>
  <p>Suddenly he ceased in his ravings; a loud crash as of crumbling walls had
    rent the air, followed by shrieks and loud hissing sounds and that perpetual
    cry, awesome in its weird monotony:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death to the C&aelig;sar! Death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Caligula&rsquo;s face was contorted with terror, his cheeks were grey like
    those of the dead. He made a quick movement forward and suddenly clutched
    Dea&rsquo;s wrist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost hear them?&rdquo; he said in a hoarse whisper.</p>
  <p>And she nodded in response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They want to kill me ... they have set fire to my house ... I escaped
    through the crypta.... But they were hard on my heels....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And as if to confirm his words, the cries of &ldquo;Death!&rdquo; again
    rose in the air; the tramping of feet, the angry murmurs became more loud
    and appeared to be filling the street close by and tending toward the very
    door of Dea Flavia&rsquo;s house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, monsters! miserable monsters!&rdquo; shouted the C&aelig;sar,
    crazy with fear,  &ldquo;to-morrow will come the awful reprisals ... to-morrow
    ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; broke in Dea Flavia coldly, &ldquo;the C&aelig;sar
    is in danger of his life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll kill me,&rdquo; he cried, whilst once more trembling&mdash;akin
    to palsy&mdash;seized his limbs. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll kill me, Augusta ...
    hide me, hide me ere they come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he fell on his knees, grovelling on the floor like a fawning beast,
    with quivering hands clutching the young girl&rsquo;s robe, his forehead
    beating the ground at her feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hide me, Augusta,&rdquo; he murmured through his groans, &ldquo;hide
    me!... Do not let them kill me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew back in horror and disgust, closing her eyes lest she should see
    this degradation of the C&aelig;sarship, this breaking down of her highest
    ideals.</p>
  <p>But two days ago this same abject creature had stood beside her, demanding
    from her obedience and loyalty which she was fully prepared to accord to
    him. He had called on her fealty in the very name of that C&aelig;sarship
    which she worshipped and which he was now degrading and lowering to the dust.</p>
  <p>Then as now Jove&rsquo;s thunders from afar had proclaimed the wrath of
    the gods. Then as now Jove thundered his warnings to that man not to defile
    the majesty of the C&aelig;sars. But two days ago she had still believed
    in and acknowledged that majesty, she had bent her will, curbed her inclinations,
    smothered her every girlish inspiration, her every womanly instinct to the
    dictates of that power which came straight from the hands of the gods; now
    she felt actual physical nausea at the sight of this pitiable coward, who&mdash;wallowing
    in his own cruelty&mdash;had not even the unreasoning pluck of a brute defending
    its life.</p>
  <p>Involuntarily her thoughts flew back to the man who was lying helpless in
    her house. She saw him in her mind as she had seen him yesterday, bounding
    into the arena to save another&rsquo;s life: strong and determined&mdash;measuring
    and accepting every risk, looking neither to right nor left whilst he carried
    his self-imposed burden to safety, and then falling without a groan, felled
    to the ground by the claws of the panther.</p>
  <p>And outside the cries had become quite distinct.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death to the C&aelig;sar! Hail Taurus Antinor! Hail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The people, in their fury and their exultation, had condemned one man and
    exalted another. Truly the gods themselves had guided them in their choice.
    And now it seemed as if the final choice rested with her: as if in some distant
    shrine, mysterious oracles had spoken and told her that the future of Rome
    lay in her hands.</p>
  <p>And involuntarily she looked down on her hands and saw that they were tiny
    and weak, and yet one of them would within the next few seconds point the
    way to Destiny, show her whither she should go, carrying on her giant shoulders
    the whole empire of the world.</p>
  <p>At her feet a cowardly and inhuman creature grovelled, abjectly praying
    for a life which by its continuance could only bring more sorrow, more horrors
    and more misery to thousands upon thousands of human beings dependent on
    this half-crazy monster.</p>
  <p>Behind her, beyond two walls there lay a man amongst men, for whom the people
    clamoured, whose very presence betokened strength and whose every glance
    diffused peace. A man born to rule a people and to guide the destinies of
    an empire, and whose life of simple integrity had yesterday been crowned
    by an act of sublime sacrifice.</p>
  <p>And the choice rested with her.</p>
  <p>Her ears were buzzing with the hoarse cries from without: the cry of  &ldquo;Death!&rdquo; mingling
    with that of &ldquo;Hail!&rdquo;&mdash;the name of C&aelig;sar blended with
    that of the praefect of Rome; and through it all, drowning them by their
    hideous sound, the groans and shrieks of a bloodthirsty tyrant, brought down
    to the dust by his own cruelties, and even now thirsting for more.</p>
  <p>The choice did rest with her.</p>
  <p>She had but to run a few steps to the vestibule and there to call loudly
    to the populace that even now was invading the slope of the hill toward her
    house. She had but to rush to her door and to shout boldly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar is here, and the praefect of Rome is nigh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the twenty men who were waiting with naked swords would be as naught
    before the onslaught of the people.</p>
  <p>She looked round her helpless and dazed whilst the fawning creature on the
    ground embraced her ankles and kissed her feet, and repeated with frantic
    persistence:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Save me, Augusta ... save me ... do not let them kill me.... I have
    been good to thee.... I am thy guardian&mdash;thy C&aelig;sar ... save me....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Save thee?&rdquo; she repeated mechanically, &ldquo;how can I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hide me somewhere&mdash;where they cannot find me&rdquo;&mdash;he
    murmured, half raising himself from the ground. &ldquo;Thou wouldst not give
    up thy C&aelig;sar to the fury of the populace ... thou wouldst not soil
    thy hands with the blood of thy kinsman...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now he was embracing her knees and his hideous, distorted face was looking
    up appealingly at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou wouldst not soil thy hands with the blood of thy kinsman....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even as these words escaped his flaccid lips a roll of thunder louder than
    any previous one came echoing from behind the Aventine Hill. Dea Flavia shuddered.
    Was it Jove&rsquo;s warning, or already Jove&rsquo;s curse, the curse of
    the gods on her for the treachery of her thoughts?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou wouldst not soil thy hands with the blood of thy kinsman....&rdquo;  he
    repeated pitiably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;Not that.... I&rsquo;ll
    help thee!... What can I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me hide in thy house....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He pointed to the studio.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and instinctively her arms were held
    out, as if she would protect a sacred shrine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy workroom is private,&rdquo; he urged in tones of abject entreaty; &ldquo;no
    one would venture there ... only thy women slaves ever cross its threshold....
    I should be quite safe in the inner room ... thy women would not betray me
    ... thou hast some that are mute ... they could attend on me there, and no
    one would know of my presence until this outrage hath subsided.... In a few
    hours mayhap the praetorian guard will succeed in forcing a passage through
    the raging mob ... my legions too are on their way from Germany ... they
    will be here soon ... they were only four days&rsquo; march behind me and
    my convoy ... they are but a couple of days&rsquo; march now from the city
    gates ... I could stay in there ... in thy private room ... with a few men
    to protect me ... and thy women to attend on me ... no one else would know....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He talked volubly, at times incoherently, with hoarse voice and quaking
    lips. She tried with all her might to free herself from his convulsive clutch&mdash;but
    he clung to her like a dying man would cling to the last breath of life&mdash;like
    a drowning man would cling to the raft on which he might find safety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In there&mdash;&rdquo; he entreated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should be safe and nobody would know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And now he raised himself to his feet, and swaying like a drunken man he
    turned toward the studio, calling to his guard to follow him. But she was
    still between him and that door, between this raving, bloodthirsty maniac
    and a helpless man who was lying wounded and in a drugged sleep on a bed
    of sickness.</p>
  <p>The oracle had not yet finished speaking. The last word still hung in the
    air. Her choice had not yet been made: but at this moment when Caligula and
    his guard turned toward the studio door, she knew that it would not be long
    in the making. Never should that demented tyrant cross the threshold of her
    studio and wreak his hatred and revenge upon the fallen hero. Rather than
    that should happen she would call to the people, and hand over the C&aelig;sar&mdash;her
    kinsman&mdash;to an infuriated mob. Better that than to deliver a wounded
    man into the claws of a raging brute.</p>
  <p>Then mayhap the blood of her kinsman would stain her hands for ever; then,
    too, no doubt would come horror, remorse and the malediction of the gods.
    Then so be it. That would she take upon herself. What must be suffered, that
    she would suffer: the torments of remorse would be infinitesimal compared
    with the awful sacrilege which the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s hand would perpetrate,
    were he allowed access to the praefect of Rome.</p>
  <p>And even as the resolve became firmly implanted in her heart, she found
    herself murmuring softly words which she had heard in the Forum a very few
    days ago.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have but one soul and that is in the hand of God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Something of the serenity which had then shone from the man&rsquo;s face
    now entered into her heart. Horror and excitement fell away from her like
    a useless mantle. She felt herself absolutely calm and unswerving in her
    determination.</p>
  <p>Therefore she did not make a rush for the studio door, she did not with
    dramatic gesture interpose her body between it and the C&aelig;sar: she merely
    put her hand out and let it rest upon his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should be safe in there&mdash;and nobody would know....&rdquo; he
    murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My slaves would know,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;and would betray
    thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only fear the men and they need not know,&rdquo; he said eagerly,
    even though at her words he had paused and turned back towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Many of them have seen and heard thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell them I have escaped to the Palace of Augustus, through the crypta.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They would not believe it&mdash;they would know it was not true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Canst thou not trust thy slaves?&rdquo; he snarled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldst thou trust thine?&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can change robes with one of my guard,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;and
    he could then pretend to be the C&aelig;sar escaping through the crypta to
    the House of Augustus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twere safest not to make pretence,&rdquo; she rejoined coolly; &ldquo;rather
    let the C&aelig;sar do what he suggests.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Palace of Augustus would be the safest stronghold for the C&aelig;sar
    until the arrival of the legions. It would be safer than the house of his
    servant, for prying eyes may have seen him enter it, and ears&mdash;sharpened
    by hate&mdash;may have heard his cries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then am I lost!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not if my gracious lord will take counsel of his servant. The underground
    way is clear and safe. The Palace of Augustus would afford ample shelter.
    Twenty men well armed will watch over the C&aelig;sar and the house of Dea
    Flavia will furnish the necessary food.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Caligula hesitated a moment, his shifty eyes wandered restlessly over the
    face of the young girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;lt not betray me?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could betray thee now an I would,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;The
    mob is at my gate. One call from me and the C&aelig;sar is in the hands of
    those who desire his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; he said, once more clutching her wrist and gazing
    fearfully around him, &ldquo;speak not of this, Dea! The very words might
    call down the decree of the gods.... I&rsquo;ll trust thee,&rdquo; he added,
    bringing his livid face close to her own and speaking with a fever of maddened
    fury, &ldquo;but if thou shouldst fail me....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No need of threats, great C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; she said, calmly disengaging
    her wrist from his grasp and stepping back from him, &ldquo;if I failed thee
    to-day neither I nor thou would be alive on the morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The truth of what she said must have struck his dulled mind, for the look
    of savage ferocity quickly died from his face, leaving it once more pale
    with abject fear. He must have realised that his own unreasoning cowardice
    had placed him entirely in this girl&rsquo;s hands, and that having feared
    to meet his people a few hours ago, he had cut off from beneath his own feet
    the bulwark of dignity and of unapproachable sanctity on which he should
    have stood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll to the House of Augustus,&rdquo; he said more quietly, &ldquo;while
    the rabble vent their rage upon my palace and search for their C&aelig;sar
    that they might murder him, I&rsquo;ll remain there in peace. Do thou send
    thy most trusted slave into the streets, and let him endeavour to reach the
    praetorian guard who are holding their ground behind the crowd of rebels.
    They might effect a flank movement, which, if unexpected, might put the miscreants
    to rout sooner than we anticipate. Hast a slave whom thou canst trust thus
    far?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have two freedmen,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;free since yesternight,
    who would give their life for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let them do it then,&rdquo; he retorted cynically. &ldquo;And do
    thou lead the way to the triclinium. I am anhungered, and a halt at thy table
    will throw dust in the eyes of thy slaves. I can reach the crypta from there
    without being seen again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As the C&aelig;sar commands,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;but there
    is little time to be lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Nothing is secret, which shall not be made manifest.&rdquo;&mdash;St.
    Luke 8. 17.</p>
  <p>Caligula himself led the way to the triclinium and Dea Flavia followed him.</p>
  <p>He threw himself upon a couch and she, with her own hands, served him with
    wine and fruit. He refused to eat but drank freely of the wine, whilst she
    stood beside him calmly waiting until he should be ready to go.</p>
  <p>Seeing Blanca cross the atrium, she had called to her and ordered her to
    serve the soldiers. The men were grateful for they were exhausted. They had
    not tasted food since the day before, and had been on the watch round the
    C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s person all night.</p>
  <p>The underground passage which runs beneath the declivity between the two
    points of the Palatine, and by tortuous ways under the temple of Jupiter
    Victor on its highest summit, did connect the house which Dea Flavia now
    occupied with the Palace of Augusta. The latter, since the death of the great
    imperator, had been used entirely as a hall of justice: a few scribes alone
    inhabited the rearmost portion of the huge edifice.</p>
  <p>The passage itself abutted in Dea Flavia&rsquo;s house on one of the small
    rooms that lay round the triclinium. There were several such passages connecting
    the various palaces on the Palatine, but their existence was not revealed
    to the army of slaves, only a few responsible ones knew that they were there.
    In this instance the C&aelig;sar could, from the triclinium, reach this road
    to safety without again crossing the atrium and encountering the prying eyes
    of hundreds of cowardly slaves.</p>
  <p>He had no thought of thanking Dea Flavia for what she did for him, but having
    drunk his fill, he rose from the couch and made ready to go.</p>
  <p>She escorted him to the door of the passage and gave brief instructions
    to the men how to proceed. She had lighted a small lamp which would guide
    the C&aelig;sar and his escort on their way. From the door, a flight of precipitous
    steps led down into the darkness. Caligula was the first to descend and his
    soldiers followed him; the one who held the lamp keeping close to the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    person.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia stood at the door until the footsteps of the men ceased to send
    their echo back to her along the vaulted passage. Then, with a sigh of relief,
    she closed the door on them and hastily fled from the room.</p>
  <p>Her one desire now was to shut out, as completely as possible from her mental
    vision the picture of her shattered ideal, the degradation of that majesty
    which she had honoured all her life. So imbued was she with that sense of
    honour and of reverence for the C&aelig;sarship, that she would not dwell
    in thought on that awful sight of the C&aelig;sar grovelling in abject terror
    at her feet. She wished to forget it&mdash;to forget him&mdash;the man who,
    in her eyes, was already no longer the C&aelig;sar, for the C&aelig;sar was
    a god, and like unto a god in glory and in dignity&mdash;whilst Caligula,
    her kinsman, had sunk lower than the beasts.</p>
  <p>Almost involuntarily she had turned back toward the studio. A while ago
    she had wished to look on the praefect of Rome as he lay in a drugged sleep,
    desiring to assure herself that all was well with him; then the advent of
    the C&aelig;sar had interrupted her. Over an hour had gone by since then
    and the whole aspect of the world had changed.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar was a fugitive and a coward, and the people who had the
    upper hand were prepared to acclaim the hero of their choice.</p>
  <p>The atrium now was gloomy and deserted. The slaves&mdash;gathered together
    in their remote quarters&mdash;shunned the vastness and the enforced silence
    of the reception halls; they preferred to huddle together in close groups
    in corners, distant from the noise of the street.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia stood quietly listening. Still from afar came the insistent cries
    of &ldquo;Death!&rdquo; and of &ldquo;Vengeance!&rdquo; Still overhead that
    lurid light and smoke-laden atmosphere. But now those same cries seemed almost
    drowned by a sound more persistent if less ominous: the sound of heavy pattering
    rain on leaden roofs and into the marble basin of the impluvium, whilst the
    roll of Jove&rsquo;s thunders appeared to be more nigh.</p>
  <p>It was obvious that the storm which had been threatening all the morning
    from over the Campania, had burst over the great city at last. It was Jove&rsquo;s
    turn now to make a noise with his thunder, to utter cries and howls of vengeance
    and of death through the medium of his storm, and to drown the fury of men
    in the whirl of his own.</p>
  <p>Now a vivid flash of lightning rent the leaden sky overhead and searched
    the dark corners of the atrium. Dea Flavia uttered an involuntary little
    cry of terror, and hid her face in her hands.</p>
  <p>A high wind howled among the trees outside the house; Dea could hear the
    tiny branches cracking under the whip-lash of the blast, breaking away from
    the parent stem and sending an eddy of dry dead leaves whirling wildly along
    the narrow streets and into the open portals of the vestibule. She could
    hear the fall of the torrential rain, and the flames, which sacrilegious
    hands had kindled, dying away with long-drawn-out hissing moans of pain.
    She could hear the wind in its rage lashing those flames back into life again,
    and could see through the opening overhead the huge volumes of black smoke
    chased across the sky.</p>
  <p>Smoke and flames were fighting an uneven battle against the persistent,
    heavy rain. The wind was their ally, but he was gusty and fitful: now and
    then helping them with all his might, fanning their activity and renewing
    their strength, but after a violent outburst he would lie down and rest,
    gathering strength mayhap, but giving the falling rain its opportunity.</p>
  <p>The rain had no need of rest; it fell, and fell, and fell, steadily and
    torrentially, searching the weaker flames, killing them out one by one.</p>
  <p>To Dea Flavia&rsquo;s straining senses it seemed clear that in this storm
    the number of rebels had greatly diminished; none, no doubt, but the most
    enthusiastic remained to face the discomforts of drenched skin and bone chilled
    to the marrow. No doubt too the gale blowing the flames and smoke hither
    and thither on the exposed slopes of the Palatine, had rendered a stand in
    the open unmaintainable.</p>
  <p>All this of course was mere conjecture, but the young girl, worn out mentally
    and physically with the nerve strain of the past four-and-twenty hours was
    grateful for the momentary sense of peace. The steady fall of the rain acted
    soothingly upon her senses; her wearied thoughts flew aimlessly hither and
    thither on the wings of her imagination.</p>
  <p>Only the storm frightened her because she was not sure if it were an expression
    of Jove&rsquo;s wrath, or whether his mighty hand had only scattered the
    infuriated populace so that she&mdash;Dea Flavia&mdash;could weigh the destinies
    of Rome in peace.</p>
  <p>She thought of going quietly back to her room, to think a while in the solitude;
    the danger being less imminent gave her leisure to ponder and to weigh in
    the balance her allegiance to C&aelig;sar, and that other nameless sense
    within her which she did not yet understand, but which invariably drew her
    wandering thoughts back, and then back again to the man who lay in a drugged
    sleep under her roof.</p>
  <p>He slept, and throughout the great city the people called on him:  &ldquo;Hail
    Taurus Antinor! Hail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She sighed and involuntary tears gathered in her eyes: but the sigh was
    not one of sadness, rather was it one of longing for something intangible
    and exquisite, and this longing was so sweet and withal so mysterious, that
    instinctively she turned away from the magnificent reception hall toward
    her own room, with a wild desire to be alone and nurse that longing into
    an all-compelling desire.</p>
  <p>It was at this moment that five or six men&mdash;all wrapped in dark woollen
    cloaks&mdash;entered the atrium from the vestibule, and catching sight of
    the Augusta, called to her loudly with greetings of respectful homage.</p>
  <p>She paused, angered at the intrusion; peace and solitude seemed indeed denied
    to her to-day; but recognising the praetorian praefect as the foremost of
    her visitors, she could not&mdash;owing to his high rank&mdash;dismiss him
    from her presence.</p>
  <p>Caius Nepos had already bent the knee before her. He looked flushed and
    agitated as did most of the others, only my lord Hortensius Martius who was
    in the background, looked pale and wan from the terrible exposure of yesterday.</p>
  <p>She did not think to wonder how these men had entered her house, how they
    had found their way to her presence, past her janitors, and without the usual
    formalities and ceremonies of introduction which her high rank demanded.
    She knew that her slaves were demoralised, that men who had been friends
    of the C&aelig;sar were now fugitives, and vaguely thought that the praetorian
    praefect and his friends had found their way into her house as into a likely
    haven of refuge, and would, the next moment, be kneeling at her feet begging
    for protection and shelter, just as their lord and C&aelig;sar had done on
    this selfsame spot half an hour ago.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your pleasure, my lords?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To speak with thee privately, O Augusta!&rdquo; said Caius Nepos,
    sinking his voice to a whisper. &ldquo;My friends and I have tried all the
    morning to forge our way through the mob and to reach thine ear. But the
    praetorian guard, faithful to me, was unable to make headway. Then did we
    think of covering ourselves with dark cloaks and of following the crowd,
    as if we were one with it, until it led us to the precincts of thy house.
    The storm as it broke overhead was our faithful ally; the crowd has sought
    refuge against it under the arcades of the Forum, and the slopes of the Palatine
    are comparatively free.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet, do ye want shelter and protection from me?&rdquo; asked Dea
    Flavia.</p>
  <p>She had no liking for these men, all of whom she knew. Caius Nepos, selfish
    and callous; Ancyrus, the elder, avaricious and self-seeking; young Escanes
    whom she knew to be unscrupulous; Philippus Decius whose ostentation and
    lavishness she despised. She vaguely wondered why my lord Hortensius Martius
    was among them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, gracious lady!&rdquo; said Caius Nepos suavely, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    not thy protection which we crave, save for a few moments whilst we lay at
    thy feet our desires for the welfare of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The welfare of Rome?&rdquo; she queried vaguely. &ldquo;I do not
    understand ye! What hath your coming hither to do with the welfare of Rome?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Allow us to make the meaning clear to thee, O Augusta. But not here,
    where prying eyes might be on the watch or unwelcome ears be prepared to
    listen. Grant us but a brief audience in strict privacy ... the destinies
    of Rome are in thy hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She made no immediate reply, but, as was habitual with her, she tried to
    read with searching eyes all that went on behind the obsequious masks wherewith
    these men sought to hide their innermost thoughts from her.</p>
  <p>And as she peered into their smooth, humble faces, all at once she knew
    why they had come. She knew it even before they put their proposals into
    words; she knew why the praetorian praefect was so servile, and why my lord
    Hortensius Martius, despite his obvious weakness, wore an air of triumph.</p>
  <p>They had come to betray the C&aelig;sar and to place the destinies of Rome
    in her hands. It was strange indeed that this mealy-mouthed sycophant should
    be using those very words which had stood before her eyes like letters of
    fire, searing her brain ever since she had stood here&mdash;half an hour
    ago&mdash;with the grovelling C&aelig;sar at her feet.</p>
  <p>The whirl of thoughts which rushed to her brain now made her giddy. Instinctively
    now, as she had done then, she looked down on her hands&mdash;those hands
    which were to guide the destinies of Rome&mdash;and her heart had a curious
    twinge of pain, almost of fear, for she realised more fully than before how
    small and delicate they were.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Time walks closely on the heels of destiny, O Augusta!&rdquo; urged
    Marcus Ancyrus, the elder, in his gently insinuating voice; &ldquo;for the
    nonce Jove has damped the wrath of the people of Rome, but that wrath is
    only dormant, it will break out afresh. The storm in the heavens will pass
    by, but the tempest caused by a raging mob will reawaken with double fury.
    In thy hands, Augusta, in thy hands!...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She knew that all these men wanted was to use her as a tool&mdash;a puppet
    to dance to their piping. She knew that anon they would be as ready to betray
    her as they were betraying their C&aelig;sar now. Yesternight had they come
    to her with their proposals she would have rejected them with unqualified
    scorn; but since yesternight she had seen the C&aelig;sar abject, cowardly,
    degraded, dragging his bespattered majesty across the floor of this house;
    she had measured him&mdash;not by what he represented, but by what he was,
    and she had taken his measure ... and that of another ... and the C&aelig;sar
    was lower than the brutes&mdash;and that other was greater than men.</p>
  <p>A silent voice, a whisper which mayhap was an inspiration, caused her to
    look toward the studio.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In there, my lords,&rdquo; she said, pointing to the door, &ldquo;we
    shall be safe from watchful eyes and ears, and I will listen to what you
    have to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She chose not to see the look of triumph which flashed from six pairs of
    eyes, but calmly led the way toward the studio.</p>
  <p>Caius Nepos and the others followed her without a word. Dion and Nolus rose
    as she entered, and she dismissed them, whilst ordering them to wait her
    pleasure outside the door. The two men&mdash;brought up in the school of
    slavery, were too well drilled to marvel at the gracious lady&rsquo;s many
    moods; they did not even cast one look in the direction of the inner room
    where they knew that the praefect of Rome still lay in a drugged sleep.</p>
  <p>As soon as they were gone Dea Flavia turned again to Caius Nepos and to
    his friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you sit,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
  <p>She herself sat on a high chair with circular back carved of citrus wood,
    but Caius Nepos and the others preferred to stand.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than
    the children of light.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Luke 7. 8.</p>
  <p>Caius Nepos was the spokesman of the party. His high rank and great influence
    with the guard under his command gave him certain privileges which his friends
    were always willing to give him. They did not know of his treachery to them;
    nothing, indeed, had occurred to make them guess that the man who, in a sense,
    had been the leader and organiser of their party, had betrayed them all to
    the C&aelig;sar in the hopes of greater gains, once he knew that his adherents
    had no thought of offering him the imperium.</p>
  <p>The events of yesterday had changed the whole trend of Caius Nepos&rsquo;  ambitions.
    The people in its present temper was not like to accept him as the C&aelig;sar,
    even if he could persuade the praetorian guard to acclaim him as such.</p>
  <p>His one desire being his own advancement and his own interests, he had already
    realised that these were best served by adherence to Dea Flavia&rsquo;s fortunes,
    since the C&aelig;sar himself, whilst still in the fulness of his power had
    named her and her descendants as his successors for all times. Caius Nepos,
    quick to seize his chance, and seeing the party of patrician malcontents
    aimless without a leader, had grasped his opportunity and constituted himself
    once more their organiser.</p>
  <p>Now whilst the others grouped themselves at a respectful distance round
    the Augusta, he stood quite close to her, with back bent and his face in
    shadow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Augusta,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;meseems that in thy heart thou hast
    already guessed the purpose of our coming. The hour is rife and we do but
    wait thy command. We are at one in this: the praetorian guard will follow
    my dictates, the patriciate of Rome will bow the knee to thee. Augusta, the
    hour is rife! a raging madman, a cruel mountebank and abject coward has this
    day forfeited all rights to sit on the throne of Augustus, thine immortal
    kinsman. Augusta, art prepared to deliver Rome finally from under the heel
    of a tyrant, and thyself to place the sceptre of Augustus in the hands of
    one who were worthy of the prize?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, my lord?&rdquo; she asked coldly, for Caius Nepos had paused in
    his oratory,  &ldquo;I? How can I&mdash;a woman&mdash;decide on this great
    point? &rsquo;Tis for the legions to proclaim their C&aelig;sar....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The legions,&rdquo; he broke in quietly, &ldquo;will follow in the
    wake of the praetorian guard, and the praetorian guard will listen to my
    voice. They believe that the C&aelig;sar is dead; they will soon believe
    that the will of Rome lies in this, that the final choice of his successor
    shall rest with thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as she made no reply but sat quite still and thoughtful, her small
    hand shielding her face so that it was in shadow, her elbow resting on the
    delicately carved wood of the chair, Caius Nepos drew a step or two nearer:
    he bent his long back nearly double and sank his voice to an insinuating
    whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was the C&aelig;sar himself, O Augusta,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;who
    yesterday, before all the people, made an oath and declared that thy future
    lord and master should succeed to the imperium, so that the descendants of
    immortal Augustus should in time become the rulers of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the C&aelig;sar is not dead,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is dead to the people, dead to his guard, dead to Rome!&rdquo; asserted
    the praefect solemnly. &ldquo;Yesterday the dagger of Escanes was ready to
    do the supreme act of retributory justice, and to rid the world of a maniacal
    tyrant and Rome of a cruel oppressor; to-day the act was virtually done by
    the madman himself when he fled in abject terror from before the face of
    his people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And&mdash;as if in direct confirmation of Caius Nepos&rsquo; solemn words,
    there came from far away, rising momentarily above the roar of the tempest,
    that ever-persistent monotonous cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death to the C&aelig;sar! Death!&rdquo; even whilst Jove&rsquo;s
    thunder overhead gave forth its majestic echo.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia no longer hid her face in her hand. She sat serene and dignified,
    upright and pure as a lily, allowing her thoughts to be expressed in her
    blue eyes, letting these ambitious self-seekers see that she was not deceived
    by their pretence at loyalty and patriotism. They gathered closer round her,
    and she looked now truly a queen, dignified and serene, her head crowned
    by the glory of her golden hair&mdash;towering above their stooping forms.</p>
  <p>There was a look of contempt in her eyes which they did not choose to see.
    They were having their will with her; they had fired her ambition and roused
    her enthusiasm, and that was all that these intriguers asked of this girl,
    of whom they but desired to make a tool for the carving of their own selfish
    ends.</p>
  <p>Vaguely the older men wondered on whom the Augusta&rsquo;s choice had fallen,
    whilst my lord Hortensius Martius felt the hot blood rush to his cheeks at
    the hopes that had once more risen in his heart.</p>
  <p>But now Ancyrus, the elder, began to speak and his voice was mellow and
    gentle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The people have spoken plainly, O Augusta,&rdquo; he said; &rdquo;wilt
    set thy will against the might of the people of Rome? Hath not Jove spoken
    clearly too? Think on the events of the past two days! The C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    pronouncement in the Circus, the tumult amongst the people when my lord Hortensius
    Martius courted certain death in order to win thy favours, the rage of the
    populace against the C&aelig;sar!... think on it all! Did not Jove direct
    all this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! but meseems that he did!&rdquo; she murmured, as her eyes fastened
    themselves on the heavy door that led to the inner room, &ldquo;but since
    then hath he not directed the people to acclaim the C&aelig;sar of their
    choice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Caius Nepos shrugged his shoulders and Hortensius Martius broke in hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The rabble clamours for the praefect of Rome! but the praefect is
    dead....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! I remember, my lord,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;there is
    a rumour that he died soon after he had saved thy life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Hortensius Martius, feeling the sting of the rebuke, bit his under
    lip to check an angry retort, Ancyrus, the elder, rejoined suavely, trying
    to pour the oil of his honeyed words on the troubled water of the younger
    man&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The praefect is dead, O Augusta, and the people will soon forget
    him. Rome deifies thee because of thy great kinsman. Having forgotten the
    hero of their choice they will readily turn to thee whom they love. They
    will accept from thy hands the C&aelig;sar whom thou wilt choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My lord Hortensius after that first feeling of anger had soon recovered
    his serenity. He tried to put an expression of sad reproach into the glance
    which he fixed on the Augusta. Perhaps she had not meant to rebuke him and
    was already sorry that she had wounded him. He would have liked to put into
    his glance all that he felt in his heart for her; deep down within him, below
    the overlaying crust of his ambition, there was real love for the beautiful
    girl who had it in her power to bestow on him all the gifts for which he
    craved.</p>
  <p>He firmly believed that the Augusta reciprocated his love. She had always
    received his admiration more patiently than that of others, she had more
    than once listened quietly to the protestations of his love. Yesterday he
    had risked his life to win her hand: she, a proud Roman lady, was not like
    to forget his valour. When from the arena he had caught sight of her face,
    it was terror-stricken and deathly pale; she had feared for him then, of
    that he was quite sure.</p>
  <p>The horrible death which he had faced had given him the first claim to her
    favours in the sight of his friends. They had rallied willingly round him
    and had tacitly recognised him as their leader. Now it seemed as if Jove
    himself, with the help of his thunders, had ranged himself on his side.</p>
  <p>He saw the glow of enthusiasm rise to Dea Flavia&rsquo;s face, suffusing
    her eyes, her lips, her throat. He believed that that glow had been partly
    kindled by his glance, and was too much blinded by his own ambition and his
    own desires to note that the young girl&rsquo;s averted gaze was persistently
    fixed upon the door of the inner room.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia, of a truth, had little thought of my lord Hortensius Martius,
    of his ambition or of his love; she could not tear her eyes away from the
    spot beyond the stuccoed walls where lay a man&mdash;helpless now&mdash;but
    a man whose every deed proclaimed him the born ruler of men.</p>
  <p>Then, as those around her were silent, hanging expectant upon her lips,
    she forced her thoughts back to them and to all that they had said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What would ye have me do, my lords?&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make thy choice, O Augusta!&rdquo; urged Caius Nepos eagerly. &ldquo;Choose
    thy lord and master from among those who are ready to acclaim thy choice
    as final. The praetorian guard is prepared I tell thee. The mad C&aelig;sar
    yesterday paved the way for our success. Choose thy husband, Augusta, and
    the praetorian guard will forthwith proclaim him as the greatest and best
    of C&aelig;sars, princeps, imperator, the father of his armies. The people
    will go wild with joy and will deify thee and thy lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the C&aelig;sar ... my kinsman...?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He will end his days in contentment and in peace,&rdquo; said Ancyrus,
    the elder, dryly, &ldquo;in a villa on the island of Capr&aelig;a. No harm
    shall come to him. We here present do pledge thee our oath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I must have time to think,&rdquo; she said earnestly; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    no small matter ye ask of me, my lords. I am but a woman and still young
    in years, and ye ask me to weigh the destinies of this mighty Empire in the
    balance of mine own desires.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We would not ask it of thee, O Augusta! were thou an ordinary mortal,&rdquo;  said
    Hortensius Martius, speaking with passionate warmth, &ldquo;but thou art
    a goddess; the blood of great Augustus doth deify thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A goddess? I?&rdquo; she retorted coldly; &ldquo;nay! I am but a
    lonely woman who hath need of counsel to guide her in this supreme moment
    of her life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are we not here to guide thee?&rdquo; came in dulcet tones from Ancyrus,
    the elder; &ldquo;we, thy faithful servants, thy obedient slaves? Have we
    not spoken and counselled thee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! you have spoken, my lords, and I have read the thoughts that
    lie behind your words. &rsquo;Tis not loyalty to dead Augustus that alone
    led your footsteps to my door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our love for thee,&rdquo; interposed Hortensius Martius softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And your own aims that you would follow, your own ambitions that
    you would feed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as hot words of protest rose to the lips of most, she put up her hand
    and added with quiet dignity:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my lords, &rsquo;tis but human to be ambitious, and Rome herself
    is great because she is ambitious. But I, for myself alone, have no ambition.
    The proud title which ye would offer me holds no allurement to my tastes.
    But if the gods will so guide my choice that a just and brave man shall bear
    the sceptre of imperial Augustus, then will I thank them on my knees that
    I was made a medium for their will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hortensius Martius, convinced that her eyes had rested on him while she
    spoke, made an effort to disguise the look of triumph that shone from out
    his glance. But young Escanes, in whom all hope had not yet died, was under
    the same impression, as also was my lord Philippus Decius; for, in truth,
    Dea Flavia had looked round on them all marvelling how any of them could
    compare with the man who already, in her heart, was the chosen lord of Rome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now, my lords,&rdquo; she said, paying no further heed to the
    sighs of restless desires that rose up round her as she spoke, &ldquo;I pray
    you ask no more of me. I must think and I must pray. I entreat you not to
    urge a decision on me until I have thought and prayed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Time is precious, Augusta,&rdquo; urged Caius Nepos feebly, &ldquo;and
    the people will not wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The people have fled from before the storm,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;and
    their will, remember, my lords, may not be in accordance with yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They call for the praefect of Rome and the praefect is dead. We must
    be ready to acclaim a C&aelig;sar who will be equally to their choice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when to-morrow the third hour of the
    day is called, I pray you, my lords, come back to me for mine answer. But
    I must have until to-morrow to ponder and to pray. An you must press me now,&rdquo; she
    added decisively, seeing that protestations were again hanging on their lips, &ldquo;then
    must my answer be &lsquo;No!&rsquo; to all your demands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Though in her heart she had already weighed all that she meant to do, yet
    she would not give her decision without speaking first to the man who already
    was the elect of her choice. He was sick now, lying in the arms of sleep.
    In a few hours probably he would be refreshed, and it would indeed be a mighty
    C&aelig;sar whom she would proclaim on the morrow before the people of Rome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The people will not wait till to-morrow, Augusta,&rdquo; urged Ancyrus,
    the elder, &ldquo;canst tell a raging tempest to pause or a thunderstorm
    to bide thy time? They are quiet for the nonce but in an hour they will again
    invade the imperial hill. Thy house will not be safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then must ye put a check upon the people as best ye can, my lords;
    I cannot make my choice at this hour,&rdquo; she said determinedly, &ldquo;if
    ye cannot wait and if ye fear the people, then must you make your plans without
    my help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They consulted with one another in whispers. The Augusta was obdurate and
    without her they did not care to act. Her personality was alone powerful
    enough at this crisis to satisfy the people, and she alone could stand for
    the success of their intrigues against the people&rsquo;s loud demands for
    the praefect of Rome.</p>
  <p>Betwixt two dangers the plotters chose the lesser one. If the populace got
    once more out of hand they would, whilst invading the palaces, find the C&aelig;sar
    and no doubt murder him. That act of vengeance once accomplished they would
    probably calm down for a while. They would expend their strength in clamouring
    for the praefect of Rome, but the praefect of Rome was certainly dead, else
    he would have appeared ere this. The darkness of the night would perforce
    put a stop to all street-rioting; under its cover the praetorian praefect
    could easily rejoin the guard, and by the third hour of to-morrow, everything
    would be prepared for the proclamation of the newly chosen C&aelig;sar.</p>
  <p>Not one of these conspirators had any doubt as to who that C&aelig;sar would
    be. Chosen from among their ranks, he would be compelled to reward richly
    those who had placed him on the throne.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia waited quietly while these hurried consultations were going on.
    Now that she saw that her wishes had prevailed, she once more became gracious
    and kind.</p>
  <p>With a sign of the head and a smile that contained a promise she intimated
    to them that they were dismissed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I beg of you, my lords,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to look upon my house
    as your own until the morrow. My slaves will offer you food and drink, and
    prepare you baths to refresh you, and sleeping-chambers for the night. To-morrow
    you will have mine answer. May the gods protect ye until then, my lords.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She touched a small gong summoning Dion and Nolus back into her presence.
    To them she entrusted the task of seeing to the needs of these great lords
    and of watching over their comforts.</p>
  <p>It would have been churlish and inexpedient after this to insist on further
    conversation. Moreover the presence of the slaves put a check on privacy.
    It was better on the whole to obey. These sybarites too were not averse to
    the thought of a rich table and of merry-making in the Augusta&rsquo;s house
    until the morrow. Her cooks were noted for their skill and hers were the
    richest cellars in Rome.</p>
  <p>Caius Nepos, Ancyrus, the elder, and the others all walked out of Dea Flavia&rsquo;s
    presence backwards and with spine bent at an obsequious angle.</p>
  <p>Hortensius Martius was the last to leave. He knelt on the floor, and taking
    the edge of her tunic between his fingers he touched it reverently with his
    lips. She looked down on him, not unkindly. Had he but known that his greatest
    claim on her graciousness was that his life had been saved by another, he
    would not have worn that look of triumph as he finally followed the others
    out of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She hath made her choice, my lord,&rdquo; said Caius Nepos amiably,
    taking the younger man by the arm, &ldquo;a woman was not like to reject
    such brilliant proposals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will ask for the praefecture of Rome,&rdquo; murmured Ancyrus,
    the elder, complacently.</p>
  <p>My lord Hortensius Martius said nothing, but he disengaged his arm from
    his too familiar friend and walked ahead of all the others, squaring his
    shoulders and holding his head erect, as one already marked out to rule over
    the rest of mankind.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way....&rdquo;&mdash;St. Matthew
    7. 14.</p>
  <p>In the studio, upon the throne-like chair of carved citrus wood and heavy
    crimson silk, Dea Flavia sat silent and alone.</p>
  <p>The footsteps of the men quickly died away on the marble floors of the atrium,
    their harsh voices and loud laughter only reached this secluded spot as a
    faint, intangible echo.</p>
  <p>The patter of the rain from above into the impluvium was soothing in its
    insistent monotony, only from time to time Jove, still angered, sent his
    thunders rolling through the heavy clouds and his lightnings rending the
    lurid sky.</p>
  <p>The people of Rome, wrathful against the C&aelig;sar, vaguely demanding
    vengeance for wrongs unstated, had not gone to rest. Like the gale a while
    ago they had merely drawn back in their fury, quiescent for a while, but
    losing neither strength nor temerity. Dull cries still resounded from afar. &ldquo;Death
    to the C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; was still the rallying cry, though it came now
    subdued by distance, and the majestic screens of stately temples interposed
    between it and the towering heights of imperial Palatine.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia at first&mdash;her musings one wild tangle of hopes, fears and
    joys&mdash;did only vaguely listen for each recurrent cry as it came; and
    thus, listening and watching, her ears became doubly sensitive and acute,
    and caught the words more distinctly as they rolled on the currents of the
    wind that blew them upwards from the arcades of the Forum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death to the C&aelig;sar!&rdquo; That cry was always clear, and with
    it came, like a complement or a corollary, the name of the praefect of Rome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hail Taurus Antinor C&aelig;sar! Hail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cry filled Dea Flavia&rsquo;s veins as with living fire. She longed
    to run out into the streets now, at this moment, with the rain beating about
    her and the storm raging overhead, and to call to the people to come into
    her house, in their thousands and tens of thousands, and here to fall down
    and worship the mighty hero who would rule over them all.</p>
  <p>The people clamoured for him, and because of these clamours an almighty
    love for the people of Rome filled the heart of the Augusta. She saw now
    just what the imperium should be, just how supreme power should sit upon
    a man. And she loved the people because the people saw it too. They clamoured
    for the one man who would fulfil every ideal of C&aelig;sarship and of might.</p>
  <p>Valour yesterday, the sublimity of self-sacrifice, had appealed to them
    with irresistible force, even though they did not understand the force that
    had set these great virtues in motion. The hero of yesterday should be the
    chosen of to-day, the god of to-morrow; let the brutish C&aelig;sar be swept
    from before his path.</p>
  <p>The people clamoured, and did they see the praefect of Rome standing virile
    and powerful before them, they would fall on their knees and acclaim him
    princeps, imperator, greater than great Augustus himself.</p>
  <p>And in this very house, but a few steps from where Dea sat musing, were
    the men, the patricians who were ready to accept the decision of the people,
    who were all-powerful to make the legions acknowledge the new C&aelig;sar,
    and ready to set the seal of official acceptance to the wild desires of the
    plebs.</p>
  <p>The patriciate of Rome had combined with the people to place its destinies
    in Dea Flavia&rsquo;s hands. The C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s insane pronouncement
    in the Circus yesterday had confirmed the wishes of the conspirators. All
    envies and jealousies would best be set at rest if the kinswoman of great
    Augustus chose the future C&aelig;sar, and secured the inheritance of the
    great Emperor for his descendants later on.</p>
  <p>And now there was but her choice to be made, and the imperium would descend
    on the noblest head that had ever worn a crown. Dea Flavia felt the hot blood
    rush to her cheeks at thought that the choice did rest with her, that the
    man who was so proud, so self-absorbed, so self-willed but a few days ago
    in the Forum, would receive supreme gifts through her; that he would be the
    recipient and she, like the goddess holding riches, power, honour in her
    hands; that she would shower them on him while he knelt&mdash;a suppliant
    first, then a grateful worshipper&mdash;at her feet.</p>
  <p>Ambitious? He must be ambitious! Ambition was the supreme virtue of the
    Roman patrician! And she had it in her power to satisfy the wildest cravings
    of ambition in the one man above all men whom she felt was worthy of the
    gifts.</p>
  <p>Those were the first thoughts that merged themselves into a coherent whole
    in Dea Flavia&rsquo;s head after Caius Nepos and the others had bowed themselves
    from out her presence, and there was her sense of the power of giving, that
    sense so dear to a woman&rsquo;s heart. As to the thought of love&mdash;of
    the marriage which this same choice of hers would entail&mdash;of that greatest
    gift of all&mdash;herself&mdash;which by her choice she would promise him&mdash;that
    thought did not even begin to enter her head. She was so much a girl still&mdash;hardly
    yet a woman&mdash;she had thought so little hitherto, felt so little, lived
    so little; a semi-deified Augusta, surrounded by obsequious slaves and sycophantic
    hangers-on, she had existed in her proud way, aloof from the bent backs that
    surrounded her&mdash;loyal to the C&aelig;sar, loyal to herself and to her
    House&mdash;but she had not lived.</p>
  <p>There had never been a desire within her that had not been gratified or
    that had grown delicious and intense through being thwarted; she had never
    suffered, never hoped, never feared. The world was there as a plaything;
    she had seen masks but never faces, she had never looked into a human heart
    or witnessed human sorrow or joy.</p>
  <p>Looking back upon her life, Dea Flavia saw how senseless, how soulless it
    had been. Her soul awakened that day in the Forum when first a real, living
    man was revealed to her; not a puppet, not a mealy-mouthed sycophant, not
    a tortuous self-seeker, just a man with a heart, a will, a temperament and
    strange memories of things seen of which he had told her, though he saw that
    he angered her.</p>
  <p>Since then she had begun to live, to realise that men lived, thought and
    felt, that they had other desires but those of pleasing the C&aelig;sar or
    winning his good graces. She had seen a man offering his life to save another&rsquo;s,
    she had seen him clinging to a strange symbol which seemed to bring peace
    to his heart.</p>
  <p>That man she honoured and on him would rest her choice, and he would be
    exalted above everyone on earth because she believed him to be loyal and
    just, and knew him to be brave. Her own heart&mdash;still in its infancy&mdash;had
    not realised that her choice would rest on that man, not because of his virtues,
    not because of his courage and his power, but for the simple, sublime, womanly
    reason that he was the man whom she loved.</p>
  <p>And as she sat there, musing and still, with her eyes almost involuntarily
    drawn toward the oaken door of the inner room, she saw it slowly swinging
    out upon its hinges, she heard the swishing of the heavy curtain behind it,
    and the next moment she saw the praefect of Rome standing on the threshold.</p>
  <p>He looked sick and wan, but strangely tall and splendid in the barbaric
    pomp of the gorgeous robe which he had worn yesterday. Dion had cleaned it
    of blood and dust, and it still looked crumpled and stained, but as he came
    forward the purple and gold gleamed against the stuccoed walls of the studio,
    and his tawny hair and sun-tanned face looked dark in the subdued light.</p>
  <p>She could see plainly through the robe the line of bandages which bound
    his lacerated shoulders, and her heart was filled with pity for all that
    he had suffered, and with pride at thought of all the joys that would come
    to him through her.</p>
  <p>As he came nearer to her, he bent the knee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I crave leave to kiss thy feet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for thy graciousness
    to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art well, O Taurus Antinor?&rdquo; she asked timidly; &ldquo;thy
    wounds....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are healed, O gracious lady,&rdquo; he broke in gently, whilst a
    smile lit up his dark face, &ldquo;since thy lips did deign to ask after
    them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was presumptuous of me to bring thee here,&rdquo; she said after
    a while.  &ldquo;I feared that thou wast dead, and the C&aelig;sar....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would have defiled my body. Then would I kiss the ground where the
    hem of thy gown did touch it, for thy graciousness hath made it sacred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray thee rise,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thou art weak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I not kneel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not to thee, but before thee, Augusta; before thy beauty and thy
    purity, the exquisite creations of God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of thy God, O Taurus Antinor,&rdquo; she said with a little sigh. &ldquo;He
    hath naught to do with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He made thee for man&rsquo;s delight, to gladden the heart of those
    on whom thy glance doth rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had ordered him to sit on a pile of cushions which lay not far from
    her chair. Thus was he almost at her feet, and she could look down upon his
    massive shoulders and on his head bent slightly forward as he spoke.</p>
  <p>She thought then how like unto a ruler of men he was, how much strength
    and power did his whole person express. She wondered, with a happy little
    feeling of anticipation, how he would take the news which she would impart
    to him, what he would say, how he would look when he knew that she was prepared
    to crown him with the diadem of Augustus, and to bestow on him the full gifts
    of her love.</p>
  <p>Time was precious, and the next few moments would satisfy her wonderment.
    She longed to see the fire of ambition light up his earnest face: the glow
    of love smouldering in his eyes would render their glance exquisitely sweet.</p>
  <p>But for the moment she would have liked to put the more serious issues off
    for a while, she would have liked to sit here for many hours to come, with
    him close by at her feet, her ears pleasantly tickled by his gentle words
    of bold admiration yet profound respect. Had he not said that she was made
    to gladden the heart of those on whom her glance did rest? And a sense of
    sadness had crept into her heart as he thus spoke, for memory had conjured
    up before her mind the miseries which had followed in her wake these few
    days past.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have brought naught but misery,&rdquo; she said with a sigh, &ldquo;to
    those whom I would bless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joy to me, Augusta,&rdquo; he rejoined earnestly, &ldquo;since the
    day I first beheld thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Menecreta is dead,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;dost remember?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused a while, then said abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the C&aelig;sar is a fugitive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavens above!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and the whole expression of his
    face changed suddenly; &ldquo;a fugitive?... when?... where...?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The people are wrathful against him,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;they
    surrounded his palace, and even....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The words died on her lips. The shout of &ldquo;Death to the C&aelig;sar!
    Death!&rdquo;  had come distinctly from afar. He jumped to his feet, and
    she saw that his face now looked careworn and anxious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is the C&aelig;sar?&rdquo; he asked hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is a fugitive, I tell thee. The rabble fired his palace to force
    him to come out of it and face them. But he ran away through the secret passage
    which leads through the house of Germanicus to mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is here then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! He grovelled at my feet and begged me to hide him ... here ...
    in my private chamber where he thought he would be safe ... but I would not
    let him come for I thought thee helpless in thy bed, and feared that he would
    kill thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! why shouldst thou call to thy god on behalf of a tyrant and
    a coward,&rdquo; she said excitedly; &ldquo;thou shouldst have seen that
    man cowering at my feet like a beaten dog. I could have spurned him with
    my foot, as I would a cur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar, Augusta, the C&aelig;sar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; she rejoined firmly, &ldquo;the C&aelig;sar, my kinsman!
    Were he not that, I would have rushed to my door and called to the people,
    and would have handed over unto them that miserable bundle of rags which
    stood for the majesty of C&aelig;sar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I lay a helpless log,&rdquo; he rejoined bitterly, &ldquo;while
    the destinies of Rome lay in thy hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! The destinies of Rome,&rdquo; she said proudly, whilst a glow
    of intense excitement filled her whole personality, &ldquo;but not in my
    hands, O praefect, but in thine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In mine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rose and went up to him and placed her white fingers upon his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>She held up her other hand and thus stood beside him with slender neck stretched
    slightly forward, her lips parted, a look of intentness expressed in the
    whole of her exquisite face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost hear?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>Obedient to her will he listened too. The cry of &ldquo;Death to the C&aelig;sar!&rdquo;  monotonous
    and weird, seemed to strike him with horror, for his wan cheeks assumed a
    yet paler hue and his lips murmured words which, however, she could not understand.
    Then suddenly the cry was followed by another&mdash;indistinct at first,
    yet gaining in clearness as it rose on the waves of the storm from the Forum
    below.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The praefect of Rome! Where is the praefect of Rome? Hail Taurus
    Antinor C&aelig;sar! Hail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; she said triumphantly, &ldquo;dost hear? The people
    call to thee! They are ready to deify thee. They call for thee, dost hear
    them, O praefect?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But though she turned her eager, questioning gaze on him, though excitement
    and enthusiasm seemed to emanate from her from every pore, the look of horror
    only deepened on his face and the whispered prayer did not cease to tremble
    on his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost hear them?&rdquo; she reiterated once more.</p>
  <p>He was looking on her now, and gradually horror faded from his eyes and
    pallor from his cheeks. A wave of tenderness seemed to pass right over his
    face, making the harsh lines seem marvellously soft.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hear thy voice,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;soft as the breath of
    spring among the leaves of roses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The people call for thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And thy hand is on my arm and I feel the magic of thy touch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stood there quite close to him, tall and slender like those lilies which&mdash;ever
    since he first beheld her&mdash;had so sweetly reminded him of her. Her simple
    grey tunic fell in straight folds from her shoulders, not a single jewel
    adorned her hands or neck, only her hair, in heavy plaits, made a crown of
    gold above her brow.</p>
  <p>Never had she seemed to him so beautiful as now, for never had she seemed
    so womanly and yet so young. Her soul&mdash;rising triumphant from its trammels
    of high rank and artificial living&mdash;emerged god-like, opening out to
    the advent of love, welcoming it as it came, enfolding it in its own ardour
    and in its purity. With this man&rsquo;s presence near her, with her hand
    upon his arm, she had suddenly understood. Ambition, power, dominion of the
    world had vanished from her thoughts.</p>
  <p>She had found love, knew love, felt its empire and its yoke, and the vista
    which that knowledge opened up before her was more wonderful than she could
    ever have dreamed of before.</p>
  <p>Her cheeks were glowing with enthusiasm, her lips were parted and her eyes
    were of a vivid, translucent blue, with the pupils like brilliant sardonyx,
    full of dark and mysterious lights. She was ready to meet love with a surfeit
    of the rich gifts which she had at her command.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The people call to thee, Taurus Antinor,&rdquo; she reiterated eagerly;  &ldquo;they
    want a man to lead them. They are tired of tyranny, of bloodshed and of idleness.
    They want to live! Therefore they call to thee. Two hundred thousand hearts
    were opened to thee yesterday in the Amphitheatre! Two hundred thousand tongues
    acclaimed thee even as in thine arms thou didst hold my lord Hortensius Martius
    and didst bear him into safety. The people have need of thee, and are ready
    to follow thee whithersoever thou wouldst lead them. They are miserable and
    oppressed, they want justice! They are starving and want bread. Their fate
    is in thy keeping for thou wouldst give them justice, and thou wouldst feed
    the poor and clothe the needy. All this morning did I hear the moans of the
    down-trodden, the wretched and the weak, and felt that Rome could only find
    happiness now through thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the C&aelig;sar?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where is the C&aelig;sar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hath fled like a coward. Let him be forgotten even whilst the
    people proclaim thee the C&aelig;sar and a new era of happiness doth rise
    over Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as he made no reply she continued more hurriedly, more insistently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are those here in my house now who would be the first to acclaim
    thee as the C&aelig;sar. The praetorian guard, fired by thy valour yesterday,
    sickened by the cowardice of Caligula, is ready to follow in their wake,
    whilst mine will be the joy of calling unto the whole city of Rome: &lsquo;Citizens,
    behold your C&aelig;sar! He is here!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>She would not tell him that the imperium should come to him only through
    her hands; a strange reticence seemed to choke these words in her throat.
    Anon he would know. Caius Nepos and the others would tell him, but it was
    so sweet to give so much and&mdash;as the giver&mdash;to remain unknown.</p>
  <p>She made a quick movement now, half withdrawing her hand from his arm, but
    his firm grasp closed swiftly over it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take not thy touch from off my soul
    lest I sink into an abyss of degradation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He kept her slender fingers rivetted against his arm, and she looked up
    at him a little frightened, for his words sounded strange and there was a
    wild look in his eyes. She remembered suddenly that he was sick and that
    a brief while ago fever had fired his brain. All her womanly tenderness surged
    up at sight of his drawn face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art ill!&rdquo; she said gently.</p>
  <p>He fell on his knees, and still holding her hand he rested his forehead
    against the cool white fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am dying,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;for love of thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence in the room now whilst she stood quite still, like a grey
    bird in its nest. She was looking down on him and his head was bowed upon
    her hands.</p>
  <p>A weird, ruddy light penetrated into the studio from above and the sound
    of the pattering rain awoke a soft, murmuring echo on the white walls. The
    noise of strife and rebellion, though distant, still filled the air around,
    but here, in this room, there was infinite quietude and peace.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia felt supremely happy. Love had come to her in its most exquisite
    plenitude; the man whom she honoured, loved her and she loved him. It seemed
    as if she had slept for thousands and thousands of years and had just woke
    up to see how beautiful was the world.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love is not death,&rdquo; she murmured gently. &ldquo;It is life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death to me,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;for I have seen thy beauty
    and felt thee near unto my soul. And when I no longer may look upon thee
    mine eyes will become blind with the infinity of their longing, and when
    I no longer can feel thy touch, my heart will become as a stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A quick blush rose to her cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That time shall never come, Taurus Antinor,&rdquo; she said so softly
    that her words hardly reached his ears. &ldquo;Have I not told thee that
    there are those in my house who are ready to acclaim thee as the C&aelig;sar?...
    acting upon my kinsman&rsquo;s own pronouncement yesterday ... they have
    come to me ... to beg me to make the choice which will place the imperium
    in the hands of the man most worthy to wield it.... My choice is made, O
    praefect!... Look into mine eyes, my dear lord, and read what they express.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked up just as she bade him, and as he did so there fell on him from
    her blue eyes such a look of love, that with a wild cry of passionate joy
    he stretched out his arms and closed them around her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love is not death, dear lord,&rdquo; she murmured, even as the tears
    gathered in her eyes and made them shine like stars.</p>
  <p>The moment was too supreme for words. Even the whisper, &ldquo;I love thee!&rdquo;  died
    upon their lips. He held her close to him, her dear head resting on his shoulder,
    his hand upon her cheek, the perfume of her loveliness mounting to his nostrils
    and making his senses reel with its exquisite fragrance.</p>
  <p>This one great moment was love&rsquo;s, and it was love&rsquo;s alone. Each
    had forgotten strife, rebellion, ambition, the fugitive C&aelig;sar and the
    murmuring people. Each only remembered the other and the perfect flavour
    of that first lingering kiss.</p>
  <p>Whatever life held for them hereafter, glory or shame, joy or regret, this
    moment remained unspoiled, perfect in its esctasy, the world but a dream,
    love the only reality.</p>
  <p>Overhead the thunder rolled at intervals, dull and distant now, with occasional
    flashes of vivid lightning which lit up Dea&rsquo;s golden hair and the round,
    bare shoulder which emerged above the tunic. Her face was in shadow; she
    lay against his heart like a young bird that has found its nest.</p>
  <p>Then he awoke from this ecstasy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar?&rdquo; he said wildly, &ldquo;where is the C&aelig;sar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Near me now, dear Lord,&rdquo; she murmured looking up at him with
    a smile;  &ldquo;my head is on his shoulder and I can hear the beating of
    his heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar, Augusta,&rdquo; he said more insistently, and now
    he held her away from him, her two hands still in his and held against his
    breast, but she at an arm&rsquo;s length from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Augusta,&rdquo; he reiterated, &ldquo;I implore thee! Where is the
    C&aelig;sar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hid in the Palace of Augustus, whining like a coward for his vanished
    power.... Forget him, my dear lord ... he is not worthy of thy thoughts....
    Whither art going?&rdquo; she added suddenly, for with gentle force he had
    disengaged his hands from hers and had turned toward the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the C&aelig;sar, dear heart,&rdquo; he said simply; &ldquo;an
    he is a fugitive he hath need of friends: an he is afraid, he hath need of
    courage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;lt not go to him, dear lord,&rdquo; she exclaimed indignantly,
    and her hands, strong and firm, fastened themselves on his arm. &ldquo;A
    coward, I tell thee ... a madman ... a tyrant ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar, Augusta,&rdquo; he retorted; &ldquo;deign to let
    me go to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;rt mad, Taurus Antinor! Fever is in thy veins and doth
    cloud the clearness of thy brain.... Hast not heard the people? They vow
    vengeance on him.... &rsquo;Tis on thee they call ... thou art their chosen,
    their anointed; the people call to thee. It is thou whom they acclaim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he said more gently, &ldquo;they will have forgotten
    their disloyalty. To-morrow they will have forgotten me ... they will think
    me dead ... dead will I be to them to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! but to-day,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;to-day is thine and mine....
    The praetorian praefect is here and the others ... the choice rests with
    me and my choice is made.... Rome even now rings from end to end with thy
    name: &lsquo;Hail Taurus Antinor C&aelig;sar! Hail!&rsquo;  ... Hast no ambition?&rdquo; she
    cried, for at her words he had remained cold and still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; he replied gently, &ldquo;but so to help the C&aelig;sar,
    that he may gain the love of his people by acts of grace and mercy, and to
    see the wings of peace once more spread over the seven hills of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a firm yet exquisitely tender touch he took her clinging hands in his,
    forcing her to release her grip on his arm. On her trembling fingers then
    he pressed a burning, lingering kiss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art not going!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the C&aelig;sar, O my soul! He hath need of me! He has mine oath;
    my loyalty is his.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A madman and a tyrant. If thou goest to him he will kill thee!...
    his guard is with him ... he will kill thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is as God wills...!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy god!&rdquo; she retorted vehemently, &ldquo;thy god! Doth he
    wish to part us? Is my love naught that he should wish thee to spurn it...?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The value of thy love is infinite,&rdquo; he said earnestly and tenderly
    as, in perfect humility, he bent the knee for one moment before her and stooping
    to the very ground he kissed the tip of her sandal. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis only
    on bended knees that such as I can render sufficient thanks to God and to
    thee for that holy, precious gift.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She bent down to him and said with earnest solemnity:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I entreat thee, good my lord, in the name of that love go not
    to the C&aelig;sar now.... An he doth not kill thee ... an thou dost help
    to bring him back to power, he will use that power to part thee from me....
    Do not go from me now, dear lord&mdash;for if thou goest I know that it will
    be for ever.... The C&aelig;sar hates thee now as much as he loved thee before
    ... his hatred is as insensate as his love.... He will kill thee or take
    thee from me.... In either case &rsquo;tis death, my good lord....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twere death to betray the C&aelig;sar, O my soul!&rdquo; he
    replied, still on his knees, his forehead bent low to the ground, &ldquo;Death,
    a thousand times worse than a dagger&rsquo;s thrust ... a thousand times
    worse than parting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His voice was low and vibrant, and as his solemn words died away, they struck
    the murmuring echo that slumbered on the studio walls. And Dea Flavia was
    silent now: silent as he rose to his feet and stood before her with head
    slightly bent, silent, because borne on the subtle wing of that same dying
    echo there came to her the awful sense of unavoidable fate. She shuddered
    as if with cold, that sense of fatality seemed ready to spread over her soul
    like a pall.</p>
  <p>It was only the Roman blood in her, the blood of victorious Augustus which
    would not allow her to yield to the spectre ... not just yet ... not until
    the last battle had been fought&mdash;the last unconquerable weapon drawn.</p>
  <p>She waited in silence for a while, nor did she detain him by the slightest
    gesture although he once more made a movement as if to go, only her eyes
    rooted him to the spot even as she said very softly, her voice sounding full
    and mellow like the cooing of a dove.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord, I entreat thee but to grant me one moment longer, for of
    a truth there is much that my mind cannot grasp. Of thy god we will not speak.
    Whoever he be, as thou dost worship him, I will be content to worship by
    thy side. But that will come in the fullness of time. Dost love me, my dear
    lord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With every aspiration of my soul, with every beating of my heart,
    with every fibre of my body do I love thee,&rdquo; he said, and there was
    such intensity of passion in his voice, such a glowing ardour in the glance
    which seemed to envelop and embrace her whole person, that even she&mdash;the
    proud Augusta, the woman&mdash;exacting through the very magnitude of her
    love&mdash;was satisfied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, dear lord, I entreat thee,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for one
    brief moment only think of naught but of our love. Let me rest in thine arms
    but that one moment longer, and remember the while that with my love, the
    world conquered will lie at thy feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew closer to him and once more lay against his breast. She was tender
    and clinging now, no longer the Augusta, the unapproachable princess but
    just a woman, loving and submissive, proud to give and proud to abdicate.</p>
  <p>To him this was the torturing moment. He knew what she desired and what
    weapons she could wield wherewith to subdue his will. The battle he fought
    with himself just then was but a precursor of the fiercer one which anon
    he would have to fight against her. The rending of his soul was expressed
    in every line of his face, which once more now looked haggard and harsh;
    Dea Flavia saw it all. She saw how he suffered, whilst with every passing
    second the inward struggle became more difficult and fierce; his breath came
    and went with feverish rapidity, the frown across his brow deepened visibly,
    and for a while his arms were rigid and his fists clenched, even though she
    clung to him, her frail body against his, her head upon his breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldst lose the world and lose me?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;The
    world is at thy feet, and I love thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A moan escaped him as that of a wounded creature in pain; the rigidity of
    his arms relaxed and wildly now he was pressing her closer to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love thee,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I love thee. The world is
    well lost to me now that I have held thee in mine arms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The world, dear lord,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;is not lost, rather
    is it won. My hand in thine, we&rsquo;ll make that world a happier and brighter
    one. Power is thine ... thou art the C&aelig;sar....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh, idol of my soul! Do not speak of that ...
    not now ... when my arms are round thee and the whole world has vanished
    from my ken. Let me live in my dream just a brief moment longer; let me forget
    all save my love for thee. It hath burned my soul for an eternity meseems,
    for I have only lived since that hour when first I heard thy voice ... in
    the Forum ... dost remember?... when I knelt at thy feet and tied the strings
    of thy shoe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I loved thee from that hour. I loved thee for thy purity and
    because thou art exquisitely beautiful and I am a man thirsting for happiness.
    But God, who hath need of my soul, hath willed to break my heart so that
    I might remain pure and true to His service. It was so filled with thine
    image that even the glorious vision of His Passion became faint and dim.
    But with infinite pity He hath given thee to me just for this one brief,
    glorious hour that it might feed on the memory of thee, even whilst my feet
    trod the way that leads to the foot of His Cross.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is but one way, dear lord,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;for
    thy footsteps to tread! &rsquo;Tis the way that leads to mine arms first and thence
    upwards to the temple of Jupiter Victor where stands the throne and rests
    the sceptre of Augustus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The way of which I speak, dear heart,&rdquo; he rejoined earnestly, &ldquo;also
    leads upwards, upwards to Calvary, on the uttermost summit of which stands
    a lonely, broken Cross. The wind and rains and snows of the past seven years
    have worked their will with it.... They tell me that one of its branches
    lies broken on the ground, that its stem is split from end to end. But it
    is there&mdash;there still, abandoned now and alone, but to eyes that can
    see, still bearing the imprint of the heavenly body that hung thereon for
    three hours in unspeakable agony so that men might know how to live&mdash;and
    might learn how to die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She said nothing for the moment. Her excitement had not left her, but her
    lips were mute because that which was in her heart was too great, too strange
    for words. She did not understand what he meant; she still thought that fever
    had clouded his brain; anon, she felt sure, sane reason would return and
    with it ambition, which became every man. But she did not understand that
    his love for her transcended all human love she ever wot of; it was great
    and noble and sublime as all that emanated from him, and, womanlike, she
    was content to let other matters shape themselves in accordance with the
    will of the gods.</p>
  <p>She looked into the face which in this brief period of time she had learnt
    to love, and tried to read that which to her was still hidden behind the
    earnest brow and the deep-set eyes. In them, indeed, did she read exultation,
    an ardour at least equal to her own, but an ardour for an object which she&mdash;the
    proud, exquisite pagan, the daughter of Augustus&mdash;wholly failed to comprehend.
    She had shown him the way to the imperium, to the diadem of Augustus, the
    sceptre of the C&aelig;sars, yet in his eyes, which were unfathomable and
    blue as the ocean that girt his own ancestral home of far away, there glowed
    neither the fire of ambition, nor the desire for supreme power. Only the
    fire of love for her and the serenity of infinite peace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when the sceptre of Augustus is
    in thine hands thou canst wield it at thy pleasure. I know not the way of
    which thou speakest; the mountain of Calvary is unknown to me and thou speakest
    of things that are strange to mine ear.... But the gods have placed it within
    my power to make thee great above all men, the ruler of the mightiest Empire
    in the world, and on my knees do I thank them that they have shown me the
    way whereby I can guide thy footsteps even to the throne of Augustus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And on my knees do I thank God, O my soul, that thou didst show me
    the way to the foot of His Cross. God himself, dear heart!&mdash;oh! thou&rsquo;lt
    understand some day for thy soul is beautiful and prepared to receive just
    that one breath from Heaven which will show it the way to eternal life&mdash;God
    Himself, dear heart, who lived amongst us all a lowly, humble life of patience
    and of toil! God&mdash;think on it!&mdash;who might have come down to us
    in the fullness of His Majesty, Who might, had He so chosen, have wielded
    the sceptre of the world and worn every crown of every empire throughout
    the ages, but Whom I saw&mdash;aye, I, dear heart&mdash;saw with mine own
    eyes as He toiled, weary, footsore, anhungered, and athirst, that He might
    comfort the poor and bring radiance into the dwellings of the humble. And
    I who saw Him thus, I who heard His voice of gentleness and of peace, I to
    desire a crown and sceptre, to betray the C&aelig;sar and to mount a throne!!!
    Dear heart! dear heart! dost not understand that the sceptre would weigh
    like lead in my hands and the crown bow my head down with shame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then would my whispered words lift the weight from thy brow and my
    kiss dissipate the blush of shame from thy cheeks. Day and night would go
    by in infinite happiness, thy head upon my breast, mine arms encircling thy
    neck. I am ignorant still, yet would I teach thee what love means and the
    sweet lesson learnt from me thou wouldst teach me in return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And in mine ear the still, small voice would murmur: &lsquo;Thou
    hast seen the living face of thy God, didst break thine oath to C&aelig;sar!
    thou didst betray him in his need, even as the Iscariot betrayed his Lord
    with a kiss.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The voice of thy god,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;is no louder than
    that of the people of Rome, and the people proclaim thee the C&aelig;sar
    and have released thee of thine oath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The voice of God,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;spoke to me across
    the sandy wastes of Galilee and said unto me: &lsquo;Render unto C&aelig;sar
    the things that are C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s, and unto God the things that are
    God&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>His softly murmured words died away in the vastness around him. Dea Flavia
    made no response; a terrible ache was in her heart as if a cold, dead hand
    gripped its every string, whilst mocking laughter sounded in her ear.</p>
  <p>That cruel monster Finality grinned at her from across the room. Love was
    lying bleeding and fettered at the feet of some intangible, superhuman spectre
    which Dea Flavia dreaded because it was the Unknown.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s eyes were fixed into vacancy, and she trembled because
    she could not see that which he saw. Was he looking on that very vision which
    he had conjured up, a cross, broken and tempest-tossed, a symbol of that
    power which to him was mightier than the Empire of Rome, mightier than the
    kingdom of her love?</p>
  <p>She remembered how, a few days ago, in this self-same room she had in thought
    accosted and defied that Galilean rebel who had died the ignominious death;
    she had defied him, even she, Dea Flavia Augusta of the imperial House of
    C&aelig;sar. She had offered him battle for this very man whose soul she
    now would fill with her own.</p>
  <p>She had defied the Galilean, vowed that she would conquer this heart and
    filch it from the allegiance it had sworn, vowed that she would make it C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    first and then her own, that she would break it and crush it first and then
    wrest it from its unknown God.</p>
  <p>And now it seemed as if that obscure Galilean rebel had conquered in the
    end. She had brought forth the whole armoury of her love, her beauty, her
    nearness, the ardour of youth and passion which emanated from her entire
    being, and the intangible Unknown had remained the victor, and she was left
    with that awful ache in her heart which was more bitter than death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have I thy leave to go, Augusta?&rdquo; he asked gently at last, &ldquo;the
    moments are precious. The C&aelig;sar hath need of me....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She woke as from a hideous dream. With a wild gesture of the arms she seemed
    to sweep away from before her those awful spectres that assailed her. Then
    she clung to him with the strength of oncoming despair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;do not go ... he will kill
    thee, I say ... do not go....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; he said firmly. &ldquo;Dear heart, I entreat thee
    let me go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no ... think but a moment ... think!... My love?... is it
    naught to thee?... Has my kiss left thee cold?... Do not leave me, dear lord
    ... do not leave me yet ... not just yet ... now that I know what happiness
    can mean. I have been so lonely all my life.... Love hath come to me at last
    ... love and happiness.... I am young&mdash;I want both.... Dear lord, if
    thou lovest me canst leave me desolate?...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>If</i> I love thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was so much longing in the one brief phrase, such passion and such
    tenderness, that all her hopes revived. One more effort and she felt sure
    that she would conquer. Fever was in her veins now, the walls of the studio
    swam before her eyes; she fell on her knees for she could no longer stand,
    but her arms encircled him, clinging to him with all her might. Her face,
    lifted up to his, was swimming in tears, her golden hair escaping from its
    trammels fell in a glowing mass down her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love thee,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;canst leave me now, dear
    lord.... If thou goest now &rsquo;tis for ever ... think, oh think! just
    for one moment ... the C&aelig;sar restored to power will part me from thee
    ... even if anon in his madness he doth not kill thee. If thou goest &rsquo;tis
    for ever.... Think on it ... think on it ere thou goest.... My love ... my
    love, go not from me, and leave me desolate.... Dear lord, but think on it&mdash;of
    the kisses thou wilt taste from my lips&mdash;the ecstasies thou wilt find
    in my arms!... Thine am I&mdash;thine my heart that loves thee&mdash;my body
    that worships thee&mdash;my every thought is thine.... Go not from me ...
    not just now till thou hast felt once more the full savour of my love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her arms round his knees, and she was exquisitely beautiful, exquisite in
    her whole-hearted love, her whole-hearted abnegation&mdash;she, a proud Roman
    lady kneeling at his feet, her full red lips asking for a kiss.</p>
  <p>He stood with his face buried in his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh God! my God!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;do not forsake me now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The thunder crashed overhead while a human soul fought its desperate fight
    for truth and eternal life. A vivid flash of lightning lit up the white-washed
    walls of the studio, and to the poor fighting soul, tortured with temptation,
    with longing and with passion, there came in that swift bright flash a vision
    of long ago.</p>
  <p>The sky lurid and dark, the soil trembling beneath the feet of thousands
    of men and women, and there, far away, outlined against that sky, a figure
    stretched out upon a Cross. The head was bent in agony, the eyes half-closed,
    the lips livid and parted, the body broken with torments had the rigidity
    of death. But the arms were stretched out, straight and wide, as if with
    one last gesture of appeal and of longing, and in this storm-laden air there
    floated tender words, intangible and soft as a memory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I will
    refresh you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was but a vision, swift as the lightning flash that conjured it and the
    words had already died on the stillness of the air.</p>
  <p>But the tortured soul had found its anchorage. Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s hands
    fell from before his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Thy service, O Jesus of Galilee!&rdquo; he said, and the mighty
    effort of subjection brought the perspiration to his brow and caused his
    limbs to tremble.  &ldquo;I saw Thine agony, Thy sacrifice; it should be
    so easy to do this for Thy sake. Give me the strength to render unto C&aelig;sar
    that which is C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s, and do Thou take from me all that is Thine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She heard his words, she saw the look and knew that she had failed.</p>
  <p>Back on the cruel wings of remembrance came the words of Menecreta the slave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May thine every deed of mercy be turned to sorrow and to humiliation,
    thine every act of pity prove a curse to him who receives it, until thou
    on thy knees art left to sue for pity to a heart that knoweth it not, and
    findest a deaf ear turned unto thy cry!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the curse of the broken-hearted mother seemed like the tangible response
    to the defiance which she, in her arrogance and her pride, had hurled against
    him who was called Jesus of Nazareth. She would have blessed Menecreta and
    Menecreta was dead; she would have given her life for the C&aelig;sar and
    the C&aelig;sar was a cowardly fugitive, and now on her knees she had sued
    for pity, and the heart which she had fought for to possess had turned from
    her as if it knew neither mercy nor love, and whilst her very soul had cried
    with longing she had found a deaf ear turned to her cry.</p>
  <p>That unknown Galilean who died upon the cross had been stronger than her
    love. It was he who was filching it from its allegiance, he who was brushing
    and crushing this heart ere he wrested it finally from her&mdash;Dea Flavia
    Augusta of the imperial House of C&aelig;sar!</p>
  <p>The Galilean had accepted her challenge and he had conquered, and she was
    naught in the heart of the one man she would have given her whole life to
    call her own.</p>
  <p>She gave a cry like a wounded bird, she jumped to her feet, and for one
    moment stood up, splendid, wrathful, pagan to the heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse thy god,&rdquo; she cried wildly, &ldquo;curse him, I say,
    for a jealous, cruel god.... Go thy ways, O follower of the Galilean! go
    thy ways! and when lonely and wretched thy footsteps lead thee along that
    way which thou hast deified, then call on him, I say&mdash;thou&rsquo;lt
    find him silent to thy prayer and deaf unto thy woe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her body swayed, an ashen pallor spread over her cheeks, she would have
    fallen backwards like a log had he not caught her in his arms.</p>
  <p>Reverently he carried her to the couch and there he laid her down, wrapping
    her grey shroud-like tunic closely round her feet.</p>
  <p>He bent over her and kissed her golden hair, each blue-veined lid closed
    in unconsciousness, the perfect lips pallid now and still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the name of Him Who died before mine eyes, take her in Thy keeping,
    O God!&rdquo; he murmured fervently.</p>
  <p>Then without another glance on her, he fled precipitately from the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able
    to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.&rdquo;&mdash;Ephesians

  <p>Without looking to right or left he strode across the atrium.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A cloak quickly,&rdquo; he commanded as Dion and Nolus, obedient
    and expectant of orders, rushed forward at his approach.</p>
  <p>From the triclinium on the right came the sound of loud laughter and the
    strains of a bibulous song, voices raised in gaiety and pleasure: Taurus
    Antinor recognised that of Caius Nepos, fluent and mellow, and that of my
    lord Hortensius Martius resonant and clear.</p>
  <p>To what their revelries meant he did not give a thought. Dea had told him
    why these men had come to her house. The intrigues hatched two days ago over
    a supper-table were finding their culmination now. The C&aelig;sar was a
    fugitive and the people rebellious: the golden opportunity lay ready to the
    hand of these treacherous self-seekers: and Dea Flavia was to be their tool,
    their puppet, until such time as they betrayed her in her turn into other
    hands that paid them higher wage.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor wrapped the dark cloak which Dion had brought him closely
    around his person. He gave the slaves a mute, peremptory sign of silence
    and then quickly walked past the janitors, through the vestibule and out
    into the open street.</p>
  <p>The midday light had yielded to early afternoon. It still was grey and lurid,
    with a leaden mist hanging over the distance and moisture rising up from
    the rain-sodden ground. The worst of the storm had passed from over the city,
    but the thunder still rolled dully at intervals above the Campania and great
    gusts of wind drove the heavy rain into Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>It seemed to him, as he walked rapidly down the narrow street in front of
    the Augusta&rsquo;s palace, that the noise from the Forum below had gained
    in volume and in strength. When the raging tempest of rebellion was at its
    height earlier in the day, he had lain in a drugged sleep, unconscious of
    the shouts, the threats, the groans which had resounded from palace to palace
    on the very summit of the Palatine. When he awoke these terrifying sounds
    were already more subdued. The people had been driven by the storm-fanned
    conflagration which they themselves had kindled, to seek shelter under the
    arcades of the tabernae in the Forum below. But now, after a couple of hours
    of enforced inactivity, they were ready once more for mischief: in compact
    groups of a dozen or so they were slowly emerging from beneath the shelters,
    and it only needed the amalgamation of these isolated groups for the fire
    of open insurrection to be ablaze again.</p>
  <p>Time, therefore, was obviously precious. At any moment now, if the rain
    ceased altogether, the populace&mdash;in no way cooled by the drenching&mdash;would
    once more storm the hill and would discover the fugitive C&aelig;sar in his
    retreat. Already from afar there came to the lonely pedestrian&rsquo;s ear
    the roar of a mighty wave composed of many sounds, which, gathering force
    and fury, was ready to dash itself anew upon the imperial hill.</p>
  <p>But up here on the summit there still reigned comparative quietude. True
    that as he walked rapidly along Taurus Antinor spied from time to time groups
    of excited, chattering men congregated at street corners or under the shelter
    of a jutting portico; whilst now and then from behind the huge piles of builders&rsquo; materials,
    which littered this portion of the Palatine, darkly swathed figures would
    emerge at sound of the praefect&rsquo;s footsteps on the flagstones, and
    as quickly vanish again. But to these Taurus Antinor paid no heed; they were
    but the remote echoes of the angry storm below.</p>
  <p>Soon the majestic pile of Augustus&rsquo; palace loomed before him on the
    left, with its unending vistas of marble and porphyry colonnades. On the
    right was the temple of Jupiter Victor on the very summit of the hill.</p>
  <p>An undefinable instinct led the man&rsquo;s footsteps to that lonely height.
    He skirted the temple and anon stood looking down on the panorama of Rome
    stretched out at his feet: the Palatine sloping downwards in a gentle gradient&mdash;covered
    with the dwellings of the rich patricians which formed here a network of
    intricate and narrow streets; below these the great Circus redolent of the
    memories of the past four-and-twenty hours; beyond it the Aventine and the
    winding ribbon of the Tiber now lost in a leaden-coloured haze.</p>
  <p>The streets from the valley upwards all round the hill were swarming with
    men, who from this distance looked like pygmies, fussy and irresponsible,
    spectral too in the rain-laden mist as they appeared to be running hither
    and thither in compact groups, but with seeming aimlessness, whilst shouting,
    always shouting, that perpetual call for vengeance and for death.</p>
  <p>The watcher looked down in silence, for that crowd of Pygmies was the people
    of Rome, who at a word from him would proclaim him C&aelig;sar and master
    of the world. The immensity of the sky was above him, the far horizon partly
    hidden in gloom, but down there were the people whose voice was raised to
    deify their chosen hero in the intervals of demanding the death of a tyrant.</p>
  <p>And the people were the lords of Rome just now. Entrenched in the narrow
    streets a crowd&mdash;one hundred thousand or more strong&mdash;held the
    imperial hill in a solid blockade. Down below, in and around the Circus,
    steel and bronze glittered in the distant vapours. One thousand men of the
    praetorian guard, cut off from the C&aelig;sar, had been unable to forge
    a way through the serried ranks of the populace.</p>
  <p>Dark masses&mdash;that lay immovable and stark in the open space around
    the Circus&mdash;spoke mutely of combats that had been fierce and bloody:
    but the people had remained victorious; the people held their ground. One
    hundred thousand fists and staves, a few agricultural and building implements
    had asserted their mastery over one thousand swords and shields.</p>
  <p>The people were the masters of Rome, and they had chosen their C&aelig;sar
    in the hero whom they had already deified.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s gaze swept over the vista that lay stretched out
    before him: it pictured the entire political situation of the world-city.
    With treachery lurking on the hill and a determined mob in the valley, the
    murder of the C&aelig;sar was but a question of hours.</p>
  <p>And after that?</p>
  <p>After that the Empire of Rome and the dominion of the world for this man
    who stood here on the watch. He had but to say the word and that Empire would
    be his. He had but to go back now, to find his way with softly treading footsteps
    to the couch where Dea Flavia&rsquo;s exquisite body lay stretched out in
    semi-unconsciousness. He had but to take her once more in his arms, to murmur
    the words of love that&mdash;unspoken&mdash;seared his lips even now; he
    had but to close his ears to the still small voice that was God&rsquo;s,
    and Rome, the mistress of the world, and Dea Flavia, the peerless woman,
    would be his at the word.</p>
  <p>Rome and Dea Flavia! the two priceless guerdons of the earth! They called
    to him now on the wings of the distant storm, from over the hills and from
    across the grey, dull mist that obscured the sky.</p>
  <p>The man stretched out his arms with a gesture of passionate longing. How
    easy it were to take all! How impossible it seemed to give up everything
    that made life glorious and sweet.</p>
  <p>A voice low and insinuating trembled in the air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take all!&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;it is thine for the taking. Thine
    by the will of thousands, thine by the call of one pair of perfect lips ...
    Rome, the unconquered queen ... Dea Flavia holding in her white hands a cup
    brimming over with happiness ... all are thine at the word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The silent watcher cried out in his loneliness and his agony; he held his
    hands to his ears, for the voice grew more insidious and more real:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Empire of the world and Dea Flavia ... and in the balance what?...
    an oath rendered to a tyrannical madman, the scourge and terror of mankind
    ... an oath which reason itself doth repudiate with scorn ... even thy God
    would not exact obedience from thee at such a price....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His head fell upon his breast and his knees bent to the earth. It was all
    so difficult ... it seemed well-nigh impossible now....</p>
  <p>No words escaped his lips; he knelt here silent and alone before the face
    of Rome that but waited to be conquered&mdash;before the face of God veiled
    to his gaze, and around him the distant roll of thunder and the confused
    shouts of the people from below.</p>
  <p>Christian! this is thine hour! In silence and in tears thou must make thy
    last stand against temptation greater mayhap than suffering manhood hath
    ever had to withstand alone.</p>
  <p>Everything in the man cried out to him to yield; his love for Dea and his
    love for Rome, and that pride of manhood in him that calls for power over
    other men. Born and bred in luxury-loving paganism, in the worship of might
    and the deification of the imperium, the Christian had to choose between
    the world and the Master. The battle was fierce and cruel. Gone now was the
    consciousness of strength, the dignity of the patrician! Here was but a lonely
    wretched human creature fighting the tempter for his own soul.</p>
  <p>He cowered on the ground, the while driving rain beat against the tawny
    masses of his hair, and lashed the proud stiff neck that found it so difficult
    to bend. The tearing wind searched the loosened folds of his mantle and the
    purple silk of his tunic, the emblem of patrician rank. His face was buried
    in his hands, heavy sobs shook his broad shoulders. The face of Dea Flavia,
    exquisitely fair, smiled at him through his closed lids, the warm, mellow
    masses of her hair entwined themselves around his tear-stained fingers, her
    cooing voice called to him with the ineffable sweetness of love.</p>
  <p>Christian, it is thine hour! and the battle must be fought out in anguish
    and in loneliness, with no one nigh thee to comfort and to succour, with
    no one to see the rending of thy soul or the slow breaking of thy love-filled
    heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When thou art lonely and wretched,&rdquo; Dea Flavia had cried in
    the agony of her wounded love, &ldquo;call on thy god then and thou wilt
    find him silent unto thy prayer and deaf unto thy woe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the cry was wrung out from the depths of the tortured heart: &ldquo;Oh,
    God, my God, if Thou be willing take this cup from me!&rdquo; whilst the
    man prayed to his God to take his soul into His keeping ere it became perjured
    and accursed.</p>
  <p>But God was silent, because the soul, though racked and tempted, was too
    great for the tasting of an easy victory. God was silent, but He saw the
    tears that fell heavy and hot upon the ground. He was silent, but He heard
    the cries of anguish, the bitter moans of pain.</p>
  <p>Christian, this is thine hour! for when thy soul and heart have suffered
    enough, when they have been weighed in the crucible of divine love and not
    been found wanting, then will the peace of God which passeth all understanding
    descend in exquisite comfort upon thee.</p>
  <p>Gradually the tears ceased to fall, the sobs to shake the massive frame
    of the kneeling man. His hands dropped from his face and his gaze went up
    to the storm-tossed firmament, there where land and sky merged in the grey
    mists of approaching evening.</p>
  <p>And on the horizon, as he gazed, beyond the valley, beyond the Aventine
    and the murmuring Tiber, already wrapped in gloom, a ray of golden light
    had rent the lowering clouds.</p>
  <p>It shone serene and bright, illumined from behind limitless depths by the
    slanting rays of a slowly sinking sun. Taurus Antinor rose to his feet; he
    looked and looked upon that light until it tore a wider and ever wider gap
    in the angry clouds, and its golden radiance spread right across the horizon
    far away.</p>
  <p>The very mist now seemed aglow; the waters of the Tiber, tossed by the gale,
    throw back brilliant sparks of reflected lights.</p>
  <p>From the low-lying marshes among the reeds two birds rose in rapid flight
    and disappeared in that golden haze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God, not mine but Thy will be done!&rdquo; murmured the lonely
    man; and anguish folded its sable wings and the tortured heart was at peace.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter32"></a>Chapter 32</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom
    He receiveth.&rdquo;&mdash;Hebrews 12. 6.</p>
  <p>The gorgeous palace of Augustus appeared quite deserted when the praefect
    of Rome finally made his way to the vestibule. He crossed the magnificent
    inner peristylium, the tall, uncut pillars of which, sharply defined against
    the sky, enhanced its majestic grandeur and its air of mysterious solemnity.</p>
  <p>As a rule these vast halls were peopled with scribes, and though shorn of
    its original imperial splendours the palace of the great Emperor presented
    at times a certain air of animation and of official bustle. But now these
    scribes, no doubt awed by the sound of terror and of strife which must have
    reached even this hallowed spot, had fled into the more remote portions of
    the palace, or mayhap had even joined the throngs in the Forum, on the principle
    that &rsquo;tis better to form an unit in an angry crowd, rather than to
    be its butt.</p>
  <p>The peristylium itself, despite its mute and lonely magnificence, bore traces
    of the turmoil that reigned throughout the city; there were obvious signs
    that men had lived and worked here but a very little while ago, that they
    had been afraid and then had run away.</p>
  <p>The marble floors were stained with mud. The sedate chairs that usually
    lined the walls were pushed aside and left to stand crooked and awry, the
    very mockery of their former dignity. Here and there a roll of parchment,
    an ink-stained pen, a cast-off cloak littered the hall and looked curiously
    provocative and out of place&mdash;an insult to the majesty of the dead and
    mighty C&aelig;sar, who had caused the stately columns to be reared, and
    the massive walls to raise their pure lines upwards to the sky.</p>
  <p>But on all this Taurus Antinor did not pause to think. On his right he heard
    sounds which proclaimed the presence of men, and thither did he immediately
    turn his footsteps.</p>
  <p>Peering through the long vista of numberless columns, the further ones of
    which were merged together in the dim light, he saw that the score or so
    of the praetorian guard who had escorted the C&aelig;sar in his flight were
    assembled at the end of the gigantic hall, some lolling against the marble
    pillars, others lying or squatting on the hard floor, as much at their ease
    as circumstances would allow.</p>
  <p>They had not discarded their accoutrements and each man had his sword by
    his side. Not realising that the fury of the mob had been momentarily damped
    by the storm, they remained prepared to defend the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s life
    at any moment with their own.</p>
  <p>More than one of them had apparently been wounded in one or other of the
    hand-to-hand combats which they had sustained against the mob earlier in
    the day, for more than one head was wrapped in a rough piece of bandage and
    more than one tunic was stained with blood. All the men looked fagged and
    dirty and for the most part worn out with sleeplessness and want of food.</p>
  <p>As the praefect&rsquo;s firm tread resounded from end to end of the colonnaded
    hall and woke the slumbering echoes of the deserted palace, weary, lack-lustre
    eyes were turned in his direction, and now when his tall figure appeared
    between two pillars the men recognised him, for his head was uncovered.</p>
  <p>One or two of them gave a cry of terror since all of them had thought that
    the praefect was dead, and this tall, dark presence, wrapped in a long cloak
    and with tawny hair still dripping from the rain, looked very like an apparition
    from another world.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar?&rdquo; queried the praefect curtly.</p>
  <p>Some of the men struggled to their feet. The voice they knew well; it was
    as of old, loud and peremptory and not like to be coming from a grave. All
    did their best to assume a respectful bearing, and one who was in command
    made ready to show the praefect into the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s presence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want no escort,&rdquo; said Taurus Antinor in that same commanding
    voice which no one in Rome had ever tried to resist. &ldquo;Tell me only
    where I can find the C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the lararium, O praefect,&rdquo; replied the soldier without hesitation.  &ldquo;He
    ordered us to remain here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without looking to right or left Taurus Antinor walked past the soldiers
    into the gorgeous tablinium beyond, where great Augustus had been wont to
    administer justice. This vast hall was deserted, but from an inner room on
    the left there came to the praefect&rsquo;s ear a curious sound like the
    snarl of an angry feline creature, a sound which he knew could only come
    from one human throat. Without hesitation he turned to whence that sound
    had come. On the right of the huge semi-circular apse, which contained the
    now vacant throne of Augustus, a narrow door led to the small temple-like
    room which had once contained the great Emperor&rsquo;s household gods.</p>
  <p>A heavy curtain of embroidered silk masked this entrance. Taurus Antinor
    pushed it back and walked in.</p>
  <p>The temple derived its light solely from a small opening in the vaulted
    ceiling; that light which came down in a narrow shaft was grey and dull and
    failed to penetrate the dark and mysterious corners of the room.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s eyes were narrowed beneath his frowning brows as
    he tried to pierce the gloom that lay beyond that shaft of light. He could
    hear heavy breathing proceeding from there and the muttering of curses, and
    anon he was able to spy a bundle of stained silken clothes that lay in a
    heap and which seemed to shrink and to shrivel, to tremble and to cower on
    the altar steps: a bundle of rags and a gleam of flaccid flesh which stood
    for the majesty of C&aelig;sar.</p>
  <p>All at once there was a raucous cry and a growl as of an animal enraged,
    and the next second something hot and heavy threw itself with violent force
    against the praefect, even whilst the sharp blade of a dagger caught a gleam
    of reflected light.</p>
  <p>But Taurus Antinor&mdash;well knowing the man whom he had come to help&mdash;was
    fully prepared for the treacherous attack. With a rapid movement he had made
    a shield of his mantle by winding it closely round his arm, and holding it
    before his face. The dagger glanced against the woollen material, rendered
    heavy and sodden with the rain, and Caligula, unnerved by the futile effort,
    staggered back against the altar steps while the dagger fell with a sharp
    sound upon the marble floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo; came in hoarse gasps from the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    throat. &ldquo;Hast come to murder me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ho! there! My guard! My guard!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was trying to shout, but terror was evidently choking him. He struggled
    to his feet, and still trembling from head to foot, made pitiable attempts
    to work his way round to a place of safety behind the altar, whilst keeping
    his bloodshot eyes fixed upon the praefect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hast come to murder me?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came to place my body at thy service, O C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; replied
    Taurus Antinor quietly. &ldquo;I have been sick for nigh on twenty-four hours,
    else I had come to thee before. They told me that thou wast cut off from
    those whose duty it is to guard thy person. An thou wilt grant me leave I&rsquo;ll
    conduct thee to them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! thou&rsquo;rt ready enough to conduct me to my death, thou treacherous
    son of slaves,&rdquo; snarled the C&aelig;sar from behind the safe bastion
    of the stone altar.  &ldquo;I have learnt thy treachery, I, even I, who trusted
    thee. Thou didst lie to me and plan my death even whilst I heaped uncounted
    favours upon thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On my soul, O C&aelig;sar, thou dost me infinite wrong,&rdquo; rejoined
    the praefect calmly. &ldquo;But, an it please thee, I am not here to justify
    myself before thee, though God knows I would wish thee to believe me true;
    rather am I here to serve thee, an thou wilt deign to accept my help in thy
    need.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To accept thy help. Nay! By Jupiter, I would as soon trust myself
    to the snakes that creep under the grasses of the Campania, as I would place
    my life in the keeping of a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had I thought to betray thee, O C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; said Taurus Antinor
    simply,  &ldquo;I had not come unarmed and alone. Even the dagger wherewith
    thou didst threaten my life lies at my foot now, ready to my hand for the
    mere picking up of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As he spoke he gave the dagger a slight kick with his foot, so that it slid
    clinking and rattling along the smooth floor, until its progress was stopped
    by the corner of the altar steps against which the C&aelig;sar cowered in
    abject fear.  &ldquo;My guard is in the next room,&rdquo; said Caligula with
    an evil sneer, &ldquo;an I call but once and they will kill thee at my word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is as thou commandest and as God wills,&rdquo; said Taurus Antinor,  &ldquo;but
    remember ere thou strikest, O C&aelig;sar, that with my death thou wilt lose
    the one man who can save thee now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He spoke quite calmly nor did the tone of deference ever depart from his
    speech. He stood in the dim light which came in a straight shaft down through
    the opening above, his splendid person in full view of the C&aelig;sar who
    still crouched in the shadow. The power of his individuality imposed itself
    upon the miserable coward who threatened him. Caligula&mdash;tyrant and half
    crazy though he was&mdash;had sufficient shrewdness in his tortuous brain
    to recognise the truth of what the praefect had told him. Had this man come
    with evil intent he would not have come alone and unarmed: had he wished
    to gain his own ends, he would have had but to say a word and the mob had
    been ready to wreak its desired vengeance upon the C&aelig;sar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The people of Rome,&rdquo; resumed Taurus Antinor after a while,
    seeing that Caligula was silent and more inclined to listen to him, &ldquo;are
    angered against thee. Thou knowest, O C&aelig;sar! what the anger of the
    people portends. For the moment a violent storm has driven the malcontents
    away from the vicinity of thy palace. They are congregated under the arcades
    of the Forum and nurse there their thoughts of rancour and of revenge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until such time as my wrath overtakes them,&rdquo; broke in Caligula
    with one of his most evil oaths. &ldquo;I am not dead yet, and whilst I live
    I&rsquo;ll not forget. Rome shall rue this day in blood and in tears. Vengeance
    and rancour, sayest thou?&rdquo;  and he drew in his breath with a moist,
    hissing sound like the snakes of the Campania of which he spoke just now. &ldquo;Vengeance
    and rancour will overtake the rebels! <i>My</i> vengeance and <i>my</i> rancour,
    beside which all others shall pale! Rome can wait, I say: the C&aelig;sar
    is not yet dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The words fell choked and thick from his quivering lips, nor did Taurus
    Antinor attempt to interrupt him; but as the C&aelig;sar finished speaking,
    exhausted and breathing heavily, there was a moment&rsquo;s silence in the
    room, and through that silence could be heard quite distinctly the call of
    the people from the distance below.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death to the C&aelig;sar! Death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Caligula uttered a loud cry of rage and of fear and struggled to his feet.
    He staggered forward out of the darkness and into the light, his trembling
    arms outstretched, his sparse hair plastered against his moist forehead,
    his eyes, protruding and bloodshot, fixed upon the praefect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll murder me,&rdquo; he cried, as he almost fell on his
    knees and only saved himself by clinging desperately with both hands to Taurus
    Antinor&rsquo;s outstretched arm. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll murder me! Save me,
    O praefect; save me! and I&rsquo;ll heap wealth upon thee&mdash;money, honours,
    power, all that thou dost desire! Save me! Do not let them murder me! I will
    not die.... I will not! I will not!... Cowards! cowards! I am a defenceless
    man!... I will not die ... I cannot die.... Cowards!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor had to brace himself up against the sickening sense of almost
    physical nausea that came over him at sight of this pitiful creature, more
    abject than any cur.</p>
  <p>Among the many moments of terrible doubt and still more terrible temptation
    through which he had fought to-day, this was perhaps the most intolerable
    because the worldly man in him cried out against the futility of his own
    sacrifice.</p>
  <p>To give up every hope of happiness, every aspiration for the welfare of
    an entire nation for the sake of this miserable coward, whose thoughts of
    self-preservation only alternated with those of maniacal tyranny, seemed
    indeed insensate mockery. Duty could not possibly lie in this. This base
    creature&rsquo;s worthless life surely could not be weighed in the balance
    against the countless others which&mdash;despite any promises that might
    be wrung from him now&mdash;he would inevitably sacrifice to his own lust
    for blood and for revenge.</p>
  <p>The worldly man, the thinking philosopher, the pagan in fact, faced these
    propositions and placed them before the Christian. But the time had gone
    by for mental conflict. The Christian had fought until his numbed soul had
    almost lost the power of suffering; all he knew now was that he must not
    reason, he must neither think nor philosophise. The Master whom he had seen
    with limbs stretched upon a Cross in unspeakable agony and humiliation, might
    also have overturned a C&aelig;sar and ruled the world from the heights of
    a throne. He chose to rule it from a place of infamy, and when His dying
    lips proclaimed to that same world the supreme finality of its salvation: &ldquo;It
    is accomplished!&rdquo; it was not to the sound of triumphal music, with
    banners flying and the spoils of conquest around, it was to the accompaniment
    of taunts and of derision and with body stripped naked before a jeering world.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have offered thee my service, O C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; said Taurus
    Antinor with a mighty effort at deference and calm. &ldquo;An thou wilt follow
    mine advice I can shield thee from the wrath of the people until such time
    as that which has occurred to-day, lies buried in the bosom of the past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What must I do?... What must I do?&rdquo; muttered Caligula between
    his chattering teeth. He was clinging to the praefect with both hands, for
    his knees were shaking under him and he would have fallen had he attempted
    to stand up alone.  &ldquo;Save me, praefect.... Save me.... Do not let them
    kill me.... I cannot die.... I will not ... and those cowards would murder
    me....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wilt trust thyself to me, O C&aelig;sar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, what must I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come forth with me into the streets. Wrapped in dark cloaks the people
    will not recognise us. They would never expect the C&aelig;sar to leave his
    palace while his life is in danger, and well disguised thou couldst come
    with me through devious ways to a house I know of on the Aventine where thou
    wouldst be safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But at this suggestion that he should leave the security of this lonely
    palace for the open dangers of the streets, Caligula&rsquo;s terrors increased
    tenfold. His teeth chattered more loudly in his head, and his hands on the
    praefect&rsquo;s arm became convulsive in their grasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dare not go, praefect,&rdquo; he stammered, and it had been pitiable
    were it not abject to see the look of insane terror which he cast around
    him. &ldquo;I dare not go.... They would kill me if they saw me ... and I
    don&rsquo;t want to die....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one would recognise thee,&rdquo; said Taurus Antinor with ill-restrained
    patience, &ldquo;dressed as scribes we can mingle with the fringe of the
    crowd. The shades of evening will be on us in an hour and our dark mantles
    will excite no attention. Have no fear, C&aelig;sar! no one would suspect
    thee of running in the teeth of danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The tone of bitter irony was lost on the dulled perceptions of this miserable
    coward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would not dare,&rdquo; he murmured intermittently, &ldquo;I would
    not dare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then do I take my leave of thee, O C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; retorted Taurus
    Antinor coldly. &ldquo;For here alone, with but twenty men to guard thee,
    I can do naught to save thy person from outrage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I were quite sure that I could trust thee....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is for thee to decide. I have offered thee my services ... an
    thou&rsquo;lt not accept them I crave thy leave to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, do not leave me, praefect,&rdquo; cried Caligula with despair,
    clinging now with all his might to this arm, which every instinct in him
    told him was staunch in his defence. &ldquo;Do not leave me ... I&rsquo;ll
    do as thou dost advise.... I&rsquo;ll don a slave&rsquo;s garb ... and slip
    out into the street in thy wake ... and ... after that...?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;lt find temporary shelter in an humble house on the Aventine.
    There thou canst rest for a few days even while thy legions, distant from
    here but three days&rsquo; march, I believe, do approach the city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! my legions,&rdquo; cried the C&aelig;sar in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;I
    had nigh forgotten them. They are not far ... if I could but reach them....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A sudden fire of malicious hatred once more lit up the dull misery of his
    face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the head of my legions I can soon show this miserable rabble who
    is the master of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the head of thy legions, O C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; retorted Taurus
    Antinor firmly,  &ldquo;and preceded by a proclamation of universal pardon
    for all the events of the past few days, thou wilt make thine entry into
    Rome amidst the rejoicings of thy people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; hissed Caligula through set teeth. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet is a proclamation of universal pardon necessary for thy safety,&rdquo;  said
    Taurus Antinor with solemn earnestness. &ldquo;As soon as I have placed thee
    under the protection of that sheltering roof on the Aventine, I would return
    to Rome with thy proclamation, and with the news that in three days&rsquo; time
    thou wouldst enter the city at the head of thy people. The people, frightened
    at first, would imagine that divine interference had led thee triumphantly
    out of danger, thy clemency would allay their fears and fire their enthusiasm;
    they would soon make ready to welcome thee with rejoicings. But without thy
    promise of pardon fear would gain the mastery over those who led this rebellion,
    and fear quickly would beget despair. In their terror of thy coming vengeance
    they might oppose thy coming, and such is the temper of the people just now
    that all the strength of thy legions&mdash;half-spent in this last expedition&mdash;might
    be powerless against it; thy chosen soldiers even might turn against thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar was silent, and even in this dim light it was easy to read
    on his ghastly face the inner workings of his tortuous mind&mdash;rage, malice,
    a raging thirst for revenge fought against his own cowardice and the steady
    influence which the praefect&rsquo;s calm and firm attitude was exercising
    over him, much against his will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Time is precious, O C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; continued Taurus Antinor
    earnestly; &ldquo;the people will not wait. The shadows of evening will soon
    be drawing in and the storm has not yet wholly passed away. The hour is propitious
    now, an thou wilt accept my service, we can slip away and mingle with the
    few straggling groups of malcontents before the crowd has again rushed the
    hill. An thou wilt not tarry and canst brace thyself up to indifferent demeanour
    in the streets, I swear to thee that thou wilt be under safe shelter in an
    hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I but dared to trust myself so entirely in thy keeping....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor shrugged his broad shoulders with marked contempt for his
    forbearance was threatening to give way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is there anyone else,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;whom thou wouldst rather
    trust? Name him then, O C&aelig;sar, and, alive or dead, I&rsquo;ll bring
    him to thy presence within the hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But to this the C&aelig;sar made no reply. He knew better than anyone could
    tell him that the man whom he had called a traitor, whom he had twice tried
    basely to kill, was the one man in the entire patriciate of Rome who would
    be true to him. Even madmen have such instincts at times. Caligula knew that
    he was doomed, the cries from below could leave no doubt in his mind that,
    isolated as he was, cut off not only from his legions but even from his guard,
    nothing could save him from the fury of vengeance which threatened him from
    his entire people.</p>
  <p>A wave of fatality swept over his maniacal sense of terror. He knew and
    felt that if this man was a traitor then indeed could nothing save him; and
    he knew and felt at the same time that while he was under this man&rsquo;s
    protection no great harm could come to him.</p>
  <p>Gradually this sense of fatality got the mastery over his cowardice, and
    as Taurus Antinor watched the twitchings of that distorted face, he could
    note that insensibly a resolution to follow his advice had found its way
    in this madman&rsquo;s brain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with thee,&rdquo; said Caligula at last, and now
    his voice sounded more firm, even whilst his hands released their grip on
    the praefect&rsquo;s arm and his short body straightened itself out upon
    his trembling limbs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with thee, but may thy flesh
    wither on thy bones, thy hands be palsied and thine eyes become sightless
    if thou hast a thought of betraying thy C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To this senseless speech Taurus Antinor vouchsafed no reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I pray thee,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;wait here a while
    till I find the necessary garments for thy disguise and mine, and also pen,
    ink and parchment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pen and ink? For what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy proclamation of pardon, C&aelig;sar, signed by thy hand....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I am in safety I will see to it,&rdquo; said Caligula with sudden
    blandness,  &ldquo;thou saidst it thyself there is no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is time to fulfil a promise and time to take what is the most
    important measure for thy safety,&rdquo; rejoined Taurus Antinor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou dost not trust thy C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; said Caligula with a
    vicious snarl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the praefect&rsquo;s curt reply.</p>
  <p>It was characteristic of this tyrannical despot that at the praefect&rsquo;s
    rough answer he laughed with obvious satisfaction. At the back of his shrewd
    sense of self-preservation there had come the thought that the man who had
    spoken that unequivocal &ldquo;No!&rdquo; had learnt to its fullest the lesson
    of truth. He said nothing for a while, and when his laughter died away in
    a kind of hysterical gasp, he made a gesture expressive of indifference and
    also of submission to the other&rsquo;s wish.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor turned away from the loathsome presence without another word
    and with a firm step. And Caligula, standing motionless in the middle of
    the room waited quietly for his return.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter33"></a>Chapter 33</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Come, take up the cross, and follow me.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Mark 10.
    21.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor had some difficulty in finding the clothes that he wanted,
    which would serve as a disguise for the C&aelig;sar and himself, and he had
    to explore the huge deserted palace from end to end before he came on the
    block of the slaves&rsquo;  quarters; here in one of the cubicles he ultimately
    discovered a few bundles of garments, which had apparently been hastily collected
    and then forgotten by one of the runaway scribes.</p>
  <p>These he found on inspection would suit his purpose admirably. Writing tools
    and desk he had already collected; there were plenty of these littering the
    building in every corner.</p>
  <p>Armed with all these necessaries, he made his way back to the lararium without
    again crossing the peristylium where the soldiers were assembled.</p>
  <p>Sitting on the altar steps, with the desk between his knees and the light
    from the narrow shaft above falling full upon the parchment, he wrote out
    carefully and laboriously the proclamation of pardon which was destined on
    the morrow to assure the people of Rome that all their delinquencies against
    the majesty and the person of their C&aelig;sar would by him be forgotten.</p>
  <p>It was necessary so to word it that not a single loophole should remain
    through which Caligula could ultimately slip and break his word. More than
    one beginning was made and whole lines erased and rewritten before the praefect
    of Rome was satisfied with his work.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar in the meanwhile was tramping up and down the tiny room
    like his own favourite black panther when it was in a rage. Throwing his
    thick, short body about in a kind of rolling gait, he only paused at times
    for a moment or two in order to hurl a vicious snarl at the praefect.</p>
  <p>His fingers were twitching convulsively the whole time, with longing no
    doubt to grasp the leather-thonged whip which they were so fond of wielding.
    At intervals he would gnaw his nails down to the quick while snorts of bridled
    fury escaped through his pallid lips.</p>
  <p>But Taurus Antinor went on with his work, absolutely heedless of the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    rage. When the wording of the proclamation satisfied him, he held out the
    pen for Caligula to sign. He knelt on the floor with one knee, holding up
    against his forehead, as custom demanded on a solemn occasion, the desk on
    which rested the imperial decree. He rendered this act of homage simply and
    loyally, as the outward sign of that sacrifice which the Divine Master had
    demanded of him.</p>
  <p>Faithful to his instincts of petty tyranny, the C&aelig;sar kept the praefect
    of Rome kneeling before him for close on half an hour; all this while volleys
    of vituperations poured from his mouth against all traitors in general, and
    more especially against the praefect whom he accused of selling his services
    only in order to gain his own ends.</p>
  <p>It was only when Taurus Antinor had reminded him for the third time that
    he was placing his life in grave jeopardy with all this delay that he ultimately
    snatched up the pen and put his name to the decree.</p>
  <p>After that both the men donned the dark garments of the fugitive scribe.
    With the proclamation of pardon rolled up tightly and hidden within the folds
    of his tunic, Taurus Antinor led the way out of the lararium.</p>
  <p>The afternoon light was slowly sinking into the embrace of evening. The
    vast deserted palace, with its rows of monumental columns and statues of
    stone gods looked spectral and mysterious in the fast gathering gloom.</p>
  <p>When exploring the building in search of disguises Taurus Antinor had taken
    note of the minor exits which gave on the more isolated portions of the imperial
    gardens; to one of these did he now conduct the C&aelig;sar and suddenly
    the outer air struck on the faces of the two men and they found themselves
    in the open, in the waning light of day.</p>
  <p>Unbroken now by the solid marble walls which had shut out most of the noise
    from the streets, the shouts that came from the slopes of the hill struck
    more clearly upon the ear. The sound travelling through the mist-laden air
    seemed to come more especially from the northwestern front of the palace
    of Augustus, which here faces that of the late Emperor Tiberius, with the
    new gigantic wing built recently thereunto by Caligula.</p>
  <p>Here a vast multitude appeared to have congregated. The cries of &ldquo;Death!&rdquo;  seemed
    ominously loud and near, and through them there was a dull murmur as of an
    angry mob foiled in its lust.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar uttered a cry of terror and his knees gave under him. He
    cowered on the ground, clutching at the praefect&rsquo;s robe and hiding
    his face in the folds of his mantle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They will kill me!&rdquo; he stammered thickly. &ldquo;I dare not
    go, praefect!... take me back ... I dare not go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor, none too patient a man at any time, had to clench his fists
    and drive his finger-nails into the palms of his hands, else he could have
    struck this abject, miserable coward. He wrenched his cloak out of the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
    grasp and with a firm grip pulled him roughly up from the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An thou canst not control thy cowardly fears,&rdquo; he said harshly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    leave thee to perish at their hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And holding the wretched man tightly by the wrist, he quickly sought shelter
    behind a pile of building material which lay some distance away. He hoped
    that this cringing dastard would not hear that other clamour of the people
    which invariably followed the call for vengeance: &ldquo;Hail Taurus Antinor!
    Hail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Did these words perchance reach Caligula&rsquo;s ears he would no doubt
    even at this eleventh hour have refused to trust himself to the praefect;
    he would rush back into the palace, like a tracked beast that seeks its burrow,
    and all the sorrow and the renunciation of the past twenty-four hours would
    turn to the bitter fruit of uselessness.</p>
  <p>Fortunately Caligula&rsquo;s senses were dulled by his own terrors. He heard
    the shouts and the ceaseless din of rebellious strife but the only word that
    he could distinguish was the ominous one of &ldquo;Death,&rdquo; and whenever
    this word struck upon his confused mind a violent fit of trembling would
    seize him and he would stumble and stagger along like a drunken man.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor, however, held him tightly by the wrist and thus he half
    led, half dragged him in his wake. The towering masses of building materials,
    huge blocks of stone and of marble, scaffoldings and ladders piled up on
    the open ground which encircled the rear of Caligula&rsquo;s palace, afforded
    him the protection which he had counted on and foreseen.</p>
  <p>Keeping well within the shadows, he thus gradually worked his way on from
    pile to pile until he reached the brow of the hill. The crowd which was swarming
    up the slopes was just beginning to appear in isolated detachments in the
    roads and streets that led upwards from the Forum. Apparently the mob had
    not forgotten its former purpose to entrap the fugitive C&aelig;sar and to
    force him to come out and to face his people.</p>
  <p>The dull evening light creeping up from below, the thin drizzle which had
    succeeded the heavy rain and which mingled with the rising vapours from the
    sodden ground, the aimlessness of the onrushing crowd as it spread itself
    in confused masses all round the foremost palaces on the hill, all favoured
    Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s plans. Emerging from behind a monumental block of
    granite, looking in their dark clothes for all the world like the scribes
    who had been seen running about here all the day, the two men attracted little
    or no attention.</p>
  <p>Their faces in the gloom could not easily be distinguished, nor did anyone
    in that excited throng imagine for a moment that the C&aelig;sar would leave
    the safe shelter of his palace and, dressed in slave&rsquo;s garb, affront
    the multitude who clamoured for his death.</p>
  <p>The audacity of this flight carried success along with it. Dragging the
    quaking C&aelig;sar after him, Taurus Antinor soon plunged into the very
    thick of the crowd.</p>
  <p>The tumult here and the confusion were intense. Men running and shouting,
    women shrieking and children crying, all in a tangled mass of noisy humanity.
    Some of the men brandished sticks, shovels or rakes, any instrument they
    had happened to possess; they shouted loudly for the C&aelig;sar, demanding
    his death, urging the more pusillanimous to rush the palace and drag the
    hiding princeps out into the open. Others carried tall poles on which they
    had improvised rude banners made of bits of purple-coloured rags: they were
    proclaiming the new C&aelig;sar of their choice in voices rendered hoarse
    with lustiness.</p>
  <p>The women clung to their men-folk, their shrill accents mingling with the
    rougher ones. Some of them clutched small children to their breasts, others
    dragged older ones at their skirts, and it was terrible to hear the cries
    of frightened children through the shouts of vengeance and of death.</p>
  <p>Now as the gloom gathered in a few lighted torches appeared here and there,
    held high above the sea of surrounding heads; they flickered feebly in the
    damp air, throwing fitful lurid lights on the faces close by: dark faces,
    flushed and excited, with sullen eyes and dishevelled hair, above which the
    black smoke from the sizzling resin formed weird and shifting haloes.</p>
  <p>The crowd carried the fugitives along with it, pressed shoulder to shoulder
    in a living, breathing, panting vice. Damp rising from thousands of rain-sodden
    garments mingled with the mist and with the rain and formed a grey, wet,
    clinging veil over this restless mass, kneading it all together into a dark,
    swaying entity from which rose the cries of the children and the hoarse shouts
    of the men.</p>
  <p>Drifting with the throng, Taurus Antinor, still holding his trembling companion
    by the wrist, soon found himself being carried down the long flight of steps
    which leads from the heights crowned by Caligula&rsquo;s palace to the Forum
    below. Without attempting to work against the crowd, he presently crossed
    the Nova Via, and turning sharply on his left he found himself behind the
    basilica whose every arcade and precinct was densely packed with men and
    women and whose marble walls echoed and re-echoed with a multitude of sounds.</p>
  <p>The crowd!&mdash;always the crowd! Always these shouting men, these screaming
    women, these puny crying children! It seemed as if their numbers were being
    fed by invisible masses that came from out the darkness which was closing
    in around. On ahead the height of the Aventine hid the horizon line from
    view, and on its slopes tiny lights began to appear that seemed to mock the
    weary fugitives by their distance and their elusiveness.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor had all along intended to reach the Aventine by a devious
    way. Now the crowd had brought him and his companion to the river bank, there
    where the Tiber winds its sudden curve at the foot of the three hills. That
    curve of the river would have to be followed its whole way along the bank,
    and the slope of the Aventine looked so immeasurably far.</p>
  <p>But progress had become more easy at last. Taurus Antinor pushed his way
    along now as quickly as he dared. More than one angry glance followed the
    tall, powerful figure as it forged a path for its burden, regardless of obstruction;
    more than one oath was uttered in the wake of those broad shoulders that
    towered above the rest of the crowd.</p>
  <p>With a man who was shivering as with ague dragging upon his arm, with his
    body racked with fever and his temples throbbing with pain, the man set out
    with renewed energy upon this final stage of his journey.</p>
  <p>In the constant pushing through the crowd the bandages on his shoulder had
    shifted, and he could again feel the claws of the panther tearing at his
    flesh, and the hot breath of the beast scorching his face. The sodden garments
    clung cold and dank to his skin, he felt chilled down to the marrow, and
    yet he felt as if the fire of his body would burn his skin on to his bones.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the physical misery which he endured numbed the more unendurable
    agony of the soul; certain it is that a kind of torpor gradually invaded
    his brain, leaving within it only the sensation of a terrible longing to
    drop down on the wet ground and to yield to the unconquerable desire to stretch
    out his aching limbs and to lay down his head in the last long sleep which
    would bring eternal rest.</p>
  <p>But now the ground had begun to rise, the Aventine stretched out its slopes
    into the arms of darkness and its summit was lost in the gloom above. The
    weary ascent had begun.</p>
  <p>Then it was that through the torpor of the man&rsquo;s brain a vision had
    suddenly found its way, searching those memory cells of the mind that contained
    the sacred picture of long ago. A mountain rugged and steep, a surging crowd,
    a Man, weary and with body tormented by ceaseless pain, toiling upwards with
    a heavy burden.</p>
  <p>His naked feet made no noise upon the earth, the burden which He bore was
    a heavy Cross.</p>
  <p>Above on the summit death awaited Him, ignominy and shame, but He walked
    up in silence and in patience, so that men in long after years, who had burdens
    of sorrow or of misery, should know how to bear them till they too reached
    the summit of their Golgotha, there to find ... not death, not humiliation
    or pain, but eternal life and the serenity of exquisite peace.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar hung like a dead weight on Antinor&rsquo;s left arm, and
    the right one, lacerated by the panther&rsquo;s claws, burned and ached well-nigh
    intolerably. But the glorious memory of long ago now preceded him, the Divine
    Martyr walking on ahead with sacred shoulders bent to the sacrifice, and
    he seemed to hear again the swishing of the tunic, stained with blood and
    the mud of the road; he seemed to hear the shouts of the jeering crowd, the
    rough words of the soldiery, the sobs of faithful disciples and women.</p>
  <p>And he too plodded on with his burden. The crowd, now far away, seemed to
    mock him for the uselessness of his sacrifice; Dea Flavia&rsquo;s sobs of
    sorely wounded love called to him to turn back.</p>
  <p>But memory now would be held back no longer. The picture which it conjured
    up became more distinct and more real, and its gold-lined wings, as they
    fluttered around his head, made a murmur gentle and intangible as the flitting
    of the clouds across the skies of Italia.</p>
  <p>The murmur was soft and low, and it reached the aching senses of the weary
    pilgrim like the cooling breath of multitudes of angels in the parched wilderness
    of his sorrow:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his
    cross and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it, and
    whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For Thy sake, oh Jesus of Galilee!&rdquo; said the man as he toiled
    up his endless Calvary and left behind him with every step, far away in the
    valley below, all that had made the world fair to him and all the promises
    of happiness.</p>
  <p>On ahead the Divine Leader had fallen on his knees: the burden of His Cross
    seemed greater than He could bear. Rough hands helped to drag him up from
    the ground and set Him once more on His tedious way. His cheeks were wan
    and pale, blood trickled from the thorn-crowned brow, but there was no wavering
    in the lines of the face though they were distorted with pain, no giving
    in, no drawing back, not though one word from those livid lips could have
    called even now unto God, and ten thousand legions of angels would have come
    down at that word to avenge the outrage and to proclaim His godhead.</p>
  <p>And in the wake of his Master the Christian plodded on, dragging his burden
    on his arm, the cross which he had to bear. Gradually behind him the noise
    became more and more subdued, then it died down altogether&mdash;all but
    a confused and far-away murmur which mingled with the sighing of the Tiber.</p>
  <p>And the Christian was alone once more&mdash;alone with memory.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s breath came in short, stertorous gasps, his throat
    was parched and his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth. The slope of the
    hill is precipitous here, and the house&mdash;nigh to the summit&mdash;seemed
    to recede farther and farther with devilish malignity.</p>
  <p>And the sense of silence and of solitude became more absolute, a fitting
    attendant on memory. On and on the two men walked, the Christian and his
    burden; their sandalled feet felt like lead as they sank ankle-deep in the
    mud of the unpaved road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, take up thy cross and follow me!&rdquo; and the Christian plodded
    on in the wake of the Divine Presence that beckoned to him upwards from above.</p>
  <p>From time to time Caligula&rsquo;s hoarse and querulous voice would break
    the death-like silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are we not there yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet. Very soon,&rdquo; the praefect would reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a fool to have trusted myself to thee, for of a truth thou leadest
    me to my death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Patience, C&aelig;sar, yet a little while longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May the gods fell thee to the earth. I would I had a poisoned dagger
    by me to kill thee ere thou dost work thy treacherous will with me. Thou
    son of slaves, may death overtake thee now ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God in heaven grant that it may, O C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; said the praefect
    fervently.</p>
  <p>Now at last the houses became more sparse. Only here and there up the side
    of the hill a tiny light glittered feebly. Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s senses
    were only just sufficiently alert to keep in the right direction. The house
    which he wished to reach was not more now than six hundred steps away.</p>
  <p>The darkness had become almost thick in its intensity, even the houses were
    undistinguishable in the gloom. The two men stumbled as they walked, loose
    stones detached themselves under their feet and their heelless sandals slid
    in the mud. Once the C&aelig;sar lost his foothold altogether; but for his
    convulsive hold on the praefect&rsquo;s arm he would have measured his length
    in the mud.</p>
  <p>Taurus Antinor felt after the wrench as if this must be the end, as if body
    and brain and soul could not endure a moment longer and live.</p>
  <p>A mist akin to the one that enveloped the hill seemed to fall over his brain.
    He no longer walked now, he just tumbled along, blindly stumbling at almost
    every step with that dead, dead weight upon his arm which an invisible force
    compelled him to carry up the precipitous height to the place of safety which
    was so far away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?&rdquo; asked that
    heavenly murmur on the wings of memory. &ldquo;For the Son of Man shall come
    in the glory of the Father with His angels; and then He shall reward every
    man according to his work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With his burden lying like an insentient log on his arm, Taurus Antinor
    fell up at last against the door of the house; his foot had stumbled against
    its corner-stone.</p>
  <p>A moment or two later the door was opened from within and the feeble light
    of a tiny lamp was held above him whilst a kindly voice murmured:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar is in danger, and a fugitive. He asks shelter and
    protection from thee,&rdquo; murmured Taurus Antinor feebly, &ldquo;and I
    would lay down my burden in thy house for I am weary and I would find rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enter friend,&rdquo; said the man simply.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar, trembling and nerveless, fell forward into the room.</p>
  <p>The praefect of Rome lay unconscious upon its threshold but the Christian
    had laid down his cross at the foot of the throne of God.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 34</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Finally my brethren be strong.&rdquo;&mdash;Ephesians 6. 10.</p>
  <p>The younger men were still inclined to rebel. They felt that they were in
    great numbers and that they were strong: they believed&mdash;with that optimism
    of excited youth&mdash;that their will must prevail in the end. In their
    opinion the C&aelig;sar had done nothing to atone for his crime against the
    praefect of Rome, or for his dastardly cringing before the power of his people.</p>
  <p>But the older men, those who had mayhap more than once witnessed street
    rioting and the bloody reprisals that invariably followed open rebellion&mdash;they
    counselled prudence, an acceptance of what had come about, since the imperial
    decree had been fixed to the rostrum of the great Augustus, promising pardon
    for all delinquencies.</p>
  <p>And&mdash;what would you?&mdash;but was not the praefect of Rome dead? The
    consul-major had stated it positively to all those who asked the question
    of him, and he had it on the positive authority of Folces, the praefect&rsquo;s
    most trusted slave. It was the consul-major who, preceded by his lictors,
    had caused the imperial decree to be read out aloud to the people of Rome
    from the topmost steps of the Temple of Mars, and it was he who had then
    ordered the decree to be affixed to the wall of the rostrum. The consul-major
    had received the precious parchment at the hands of the special messenger
    sent by the C&aelig;sar himself: that messenger was none other than Folces,
    and he had stated positively that the praefect of Rome was dead.</p>
  <p>It was useless to demand that a man be proclaimed to the principate if that
    man be dead. True that some of the malcontents&mdash;those young men who
    were hot-headed and whose raging tempers were not easily curbed&mdash;refused
    to accept the news and loudly demanded the body of the hero so that divine
    honours might be accorded to it, to the lifelong shame of the C&aelig;sar
    who had so basely murdered him.</p>
  <p>But the praetor urbanus had declared that the body of the praefect could
    not be found, and the rumour had gained ground that it had been defiled and
    thrown to the dogs. A sullen discontent reigned amongst the people for this,
    and it could not be allayed by all the promises of pardon and of rejoicings
    which the imperial proclamation decreed.</p>
  <p>There had been some calls too for Dea Flavia. The C&aelig;sar had nominated
    his successor to the imperium in the Circus the other day. If the Augusta
    would but make her choice, the people would perhaps be ready to accept her
    lord now as Consort Imperii, with the ultimate hope that a just and brave
    man would succeed to the principate in due course.</p>
  <p>But no sound had as yet come from the house of Dea Flavia, and the people
    hung about the Forum in desultory groups, discussing the situation. That
    the gods had intervened in the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s favour no one could reasonably
    doubt. Even whilst the anger of the populace was at its height and dense
    masses had surrounded his palace to which he had been known to flee, he had
    been spirited away out of the city. His proclamation had come from Etruria,
    showing that he was already far from his city and on his way to join his
    legions.</p>
  <p>How did he succeed in making a way for himself through the dense masses
    that had thronged the streets for nigh on forty-eight hours, since first
    the tumult broke out in the Circus when the praefect of Rome was stabbed?</p>
  <p>Had Jupiter sent down his thunders yesterday, his lowering clouds and heavy
    showers of rain, only in order to aid the C&aelig;sar in his progress? What
    hand had guided him down the declivities of the Palatine? What arm shielded
    him from the anger of the people?</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Dea Flavia had heard the news even as soon as the first hour of the day
    had been called. Yesterday, bruised in mind and heart and body, she had lain
    for close on an hour in a dreamless, semi-conscious state. It was only when
    she awoke from that that the knowledge of her misery returned to her in full.</p>
  <p>She had found love, happiness, pride, all that makes life exquisite and
    fair, only to lose all these treasures even before she had had time to grasp
    them.</p>
  <p>Love had been called to life by the look, the touch of one man, happiness
    had come when she saw the love-light in his eyes, born in response to hers:
    pride came with all the rich gifts which she could lavish upon him. Now everything
    was gone, he had taken everything from her, even as he gave it; and he took
    everything in order to offer it as a sacrifice to his God.</p>
  <p>Now her heart was numbed and her brain tried in vain to conjure up the images
    of yesterday: the happy moments when she had lain against the noblest heart
    in Rome. But the only vision that her dulled senses could perceive was that
    of dying Menecreta speaking that awful curse, or of herself&mdash;Dea Flavia&mdash;gazing
    with eyes of anger and of pride into vacancy wherein her imagination had
    traced a glowing cross, and uttering words of defiance that seemed so futile,
    so sacrilegious now.</p>
  <p>The storm then had obscured the sky, drove the rain in heavy patter overhead,
    the air was dismal and dark: now a brilliant sunshine flooded the imperial
    city with its radiance, the wet marble glistened in the dawn and a roseate
    hue tipped the seven hills of Rome with glory. But in Dea Flavia&rsquo;s
    heart there was sorrow darker than the blackest night, sleep forsook her
    eyelids, and all night long she tossed about restlessly on her couch listening
    to the sounds that came from the city in rebellion, counting them out as
    they died away one by one.</p>
  <p>She had gone to her room quite early in the day; her guests she knew were
    being well looked after, and she could not bear to remain in the studio whose
    every corner reminded her of that powerful personality which had lately filled
    it, and whose very walls still echoed with the sound of that rough voice,
    rendered at times so exquisitely tender.</p>
  <p>Blanca attended on her and put her to bed for she could not bear to have
    Licinia near her. The old woman&rsquo;s gossip jarred upon her nerves and
    she was physically afraid to hear indifferent lips utter the name of the
    praefect of Rome.</p>
  <p>Only the call, &ldquo;Hail Taurus Antinor C&aelig;sar! Hail!&rdquo; which
    still came half the night through from afar dulled her agony of mind for
    a few seconds when it struck upon her ear. It set her wondering, thus allowing
    her momentarily to forget her misery. Then she would lie, wide-eyed, looking
    upwards and pondering.</p>
  <p>Who was this god whom Taurus Antinor worshipped?</p>
  <p>Who was he and what had he done? All she knew was that he had died upon
    a cross, the most ignominious death mortal man could suffer, and the praefect
    of Rome, the proud Roman patrician, had been content to obey him as a slave.</p>
  <p>Who was he and what had he done? On this she pondered half the night through,
    while fever coursed through her veins and her brows were moist and aching,
    her heart palpitating with pain.</p>
  <p>The dawn found her wearied and sick. But she rose when Blanca came to her
    in the first hour. She summoned Licinia and all her women and ordered them
    to dress her in one of her richest robes. She looked very girlish and very
    pale when she stood decked out in the embroidered tunic which she had chosen;
    it was of a soft material, clinging to her graceful figure in long straight
    folds, there was some elaborate embroidery round the hem, below which her
    feet peeped out clothed in sandals of gilt leather.</p>
  <p>When she was dressed she went out into the atrium and then sent word to
    the praetorian praefect and his friends that she was ready to receive them.</p>
  <p>Some of the news from the busy world outside had already reached her ears.
    Licinia was not like to be chary in imparting to her mistress the scraps
    of gossip which she had collected.</p>
  <p>The C&aelig;sar was outside the city, he would in due time return to Rome
    at the head of his legions, and in the meanwhile he had by a comprehensive
    and gracious act of clemency pardoned all those who had offended against
    his majesty.</p>
  <p>The noble patricians who yesterday had already deposed him, and had called
    on her to name his successor, had been foiled in their ambitious schemes
    by the very man whom she&mdash;Dea Flavia&mdash;would have set upon the throne.</p>
  <p>And once more that one all-absorbing puzzle confronted her: who and what
    was this god who had exacted this all-embracing sacrifice?</p>
  <p>She wandered somewhat aimlessly through the halls, for the great lords were
    not yet ready to appear before her, and as she crossed the atrium and went
    into the peristylium, looking with somewhat wistful longing toward the open
    portals of the vestibule and the vista of open air and sky from whence a
    breath of pure fresh air struck pleasingly on her nostrils, she saw that
    in spite of the early hour a large number of the poorer clients, suppliants
    at the door of the great Augusta, had already assembled there.</p>
  <p>Foremost amongst them was an elderly man dressed in the plain garb of a
    slave, and wearing, embroidered on his tunic, the badge that proclaimed him
    in the service of the praefect of Rome.</p>
  <p>The man appeared to be very insistent, and to be receiving in consequence,
    somewhat rough treatment from the janitors. Dea Flavia turned to one of her
    own slaves and ordered the man to be brought to her presence in her studio
    where she would receive him.</p>
  <p>The man told the janitors that his name was Folces, that he belonged to
    the praefect of Rome and desired speech with the Augusta. He walked in very
    humbly, with back bent nearly double, and when he was shown into the studio
    where the Augusta sat alone he fell on both knees before her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy name is Folces, I am told,&rdquo; she began graciously, &ldquo;and
    thou art of the household of the praefect of Rome?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I attend upon his person, gracious lady,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And thou hast brought me a message from him?&rdquo; she asked, even
    as with this hope her heart began to beat violently in her breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not from him, gracious lady,&rdquo; said Folces humbly, &ldquo;for
    the praefect of Rome is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who told thee that he was dead?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Taurus Antinor named Anglicanus,&rdquo; replied the man simply; &ldquo;he
    sent me my freedom this night and a message to lay at the feet of Dea Flavia
    Augusta.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me the message,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Still on his knees, Folces fumbled in the folds of his mantle and from his
    breast he drew a roll of parchment which he offered to the Augusta.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rise, Folces, and go while I read,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;wait outside
    the door till I do summon thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She waited until the man had closed the heavy door behind him: she wanted
    to be alone with these last words which he had penned for her. Now she untied
    the string that held the roll together, then she unfolded the parchment and
    read:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Idol of my soul, beloved of my heart. Aroused from dreams of thee,
    my wakening soul takes its last flight to thy feet. This is farewell, my
    dear, dear heart, even as my hand pens the word the dawn around me turns
    to the likeness of the night, and it is peopled with all the sorrows that
    wear out the heartstrings slowly, one by one. The C&aelig;sar is safe. Even
    as I write he starts forth on his way to join his legions. Having left him
    in charge of those who do not know how to betray, I succeeded in the night
    in reaching the detachment of the praetorian guard encamped around the Circus:
    a small company of them returned with me to the lonely house on the Aventine,
    and from thence at break of day they started with the C&aelig;sar toward
    Etruria, where the legions home from the expedition against the Allemanni
    were still known to abide. In three or four days, or mayhap five, the C&aelig;sar
    will re-enter his city. His proclamation of pardon is so worded that his
    keeping of his word is closely bound up both with his honour and with his
    personal safety. The people therefore have naught to fear from his vengeance:
    those who have more actively conspired against him, and who would have drawn
    thee in their selfish schemes, have time before them to put themselves and
    their belongings out of the immediate reach of the C&aelig;sar. Tell them
    to live in retirement as far from Rome as they can until such time as the
    events of the past few days have been erased from the tablets of memory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar is safe, and I, dear heart, do bid thee a last farewell.
    When I parted from thee yesterday we both knew then that the parting would
    be for ever; even though thine exquisite hands clung to me and twined themselves
    round the very fibres of my soul, and thy voice called me back with the ineffable
    sweetness of thy love, I knew that it would be for ever. The C&aelig;sar
    will never forgive me that I witnessed his abject humiliation. Even at dawn,
    when he stood surrounded by his praetorian guard, as secure from danger as
    human agency could make him, a gleam of hatred shone in his eyes whenever
    he looked on me. He never would give thee to me, dear heart, and would vent
    his wrath also upon thy dear head. &rsquo;Tis better that he too should think
    me dead, for dead will I be to Rome and to the people among whom my name
    might yet give cause for strife and for discontent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The C&aelig;sar is safe, and I can go my ways in peace. He hath no
    longer need of me but my Lord hath called and I His servant must take up
    my cross and follow Him. The priceless gifts which thy pure hands did hold
    out to me are registered in His book of Heaven, and He never forgets. As
    for me I were less or more than a man were I to ask thee to forget. I would
    have thee remember, yet would I think of thee as happy and radiant as the
    stars wherewith He hath gladdened the darkness of our nights. But think not
    of me as unhappy. My Lord has called, and I the servant am bound to follow.
    He laid a burden on me and this burden must I bear even though I may bear
    with it all the pain that is greater than the pain of the earth, greater
    than the ceaseless travail of the sea, even though I may bear with it that
    bitterest of all bitter fruits the labour that is nothing worth. That I know
    not! Who knoweth, oh God? Truly not I. There was grief in the world, dear
    heart, even before the stars were made or the sky stretched its blue dome
    above; and as hour follows hour, day succeeds day and the cycles of years
    come and go, even so do fresh griefs and greener sorrows spring around us;
    like each recurrent season they too come and go. Only one thing abideth,
    dear heart, and that is the will of God, who made happiness and woe, love
    and pain, sleep and death. And &rsquo;tis the will of God that I should lose
    thee and yet continue to live, even though life to me henceforth will be
    one long dream of death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Idol of my soul, beloved of my heart, farewell. I go to find comfort
    from that bitter word on the summit of Golgotha, at the foot of an abandoned,
    broken Cross. When my soul hath found peace then will it be ready for the
    service of God.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, my beloved! May God have thee in His keeping, even as thy
    soul hath already been touched with His grace. Farewell! Mine eyes are dim,
    my hand trembles, hot tears blur the writing on this parchment. And as I
    look up through the open doorway to where the limitless horizon lies beyond
    Rome&rsquo;s seven hills, I see stretched out before me the long vista of
    years throughout which my heart will be for ever weaving with threads of
    longing and of sorrow the tether which binds undying memory to thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her hands, which held the roll of parchment, dropped down upon her lap.
    Her eyes too were dim and the hot tears fell from them one by one. A sadness
    that was in no way bitter and yet was immeasurable as death had filled her
    entire being as she read.</p>
  <p>Slowly she laid the parchment in the bosom of her tunic, then, like one
    who walks in sleep, she rose and crossed the studio, her hand&mdash;white
    and slightly quivering&mdash;pushed back the heavy door that masked the inner
    room. Silently it swung upon its hinges, disclosing the sanctum where yesterday
    the stricken hero had lain helpless and sick.</p>
  <p>The couch had not been touched since he had lain on it. It still bore the
    imprint of the massive figure as it lay inert in the embrace of drugged sleep.
    The pillow only had been smoothed out as if by a loving hand, and as Dea
    Flavia came nearer to it she saw that a small object had been laid there,
    as if reverently, right in the centre.</p>
  <p>The tears in her eyes obscured her vision momentarily, but when they fell
    one by one down her cheeks, she saw a little more clearly, and having approached
    the couch she took up the small object that lay there upon the pillow.</p>
  <p>It was the wooden cross which she had last seen held between the clasped
    hands of the man whom she loved.</p>
  <p>She gazed on the small symbol, and gazed, even though the tears gathered
    thick and fast in her eyes and the image that she saw was scarce discernible
    as it rested in her hand.</p>
  <p>How puzzled she had been two nights ago when she stole softly into this
    room and saw him kneeling here beside the couch, clasping this wooden symbol
    between his fingers&mdash;intertwined in a gesture of passionate prayer.
    She had been puzzled because his actions of the day before had seemed incomprehensible
    to her: his attitude to my lord Hortensius Martius, an enemy whose life he
    saved at risk of his own, his loyalty to the C&aelig;sar whom everyone abhorred!</p>
  <p>All this had puzzled her then, but how infinitely more profound was that
    puzzle now. A riddle more mysterious than any sage could propound lay hidden
    in the words of the letter which she had just read. The man who had penned
    that letter had poured out his heart in it, and it was not a heart that was
    void of pity or of love. It brimmed over with pity, it was bruised with the
    intensity of love: but, crushed and broken though it was, it did not murmur,
    it only endured.</p>
  <p>Dea Flavia looked down upon the small object which to Taurus Antinor had
    been an emblem of that god whom he worshipped and who had been man and had
    died a shameful death.</p>
  <p>Who was this god whom Taurus Antinor worshipped? for whose sake and at whose
    bidding he was content to give up all the superheights of ambition to which
    a Roman patrician could aspire? Who was this god? and what had he done that
    a man like Taurus Antinor&mdash;a man filled with all a man&rsquo;s strength
    and all a man&rsquo;s heroism, a man worshipped of the people and glorified
    by an entire nation&mdash;should thus give up the lordship of Rome in order
    to do him service? that he should give it up, too, without a murmur, content
    to offer this final and absolute sacrifice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think not of me as unhappy. My Lord has called me and I, His servant
    am bound to follow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus had the man written in loneliness and in peace after the sacrifice
    had been accomplished, even after she&mdash;the Augusta&mdash;had, with love-filled
    heart and generous hands, offered him everything that man could desire on
    this earth. He had written it in loneliness and in peace, having given up
    the world to follow his God.</p>
  <p>Who was this god? and what had he done that his power over Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s
    heart was greater than her own?</p>
  <p>Yesterday she had cursed him loudly and called him cruel and unjust, four
    days ago she had defied him and now he had conquered. Taurus Antinor had
    obeyed him and she who loved him and whom he loved was left desolate.</p>
  <p>For this she never doubted: he loved her, that she knew. She was no child
    now! The last four days had made a woman of her: in the past four days she
    had tasted of and witnessed every passion that rends a human heart, love,
    ambition, cruelty, hatred! She had seen them all! seen through passion men
    brought down to a level lower than the beasts, and through passion a man
    become equal to a god. No! she was no longer a child, she was a woman now,
    and there was much that if she did not understand she at least could not
    doubt. The man whom she loved, loved her with an intensity at least equal
    to that which even now made her heart throb at the memory of his kiss. He
    loved her, longed for her, would have laid down his life for her even at
    the moment when he tore himself away from her arms. He loved her and longed
    for her even whilst his trembling fingers penned this last impassioned farewell.</p>
  <p>He loved her and he loved Rome! But his god called to him and he, the proud
    Roman patrician, the accepted lord of the Augusta and of Rome, followed as
    would a slave.</p>
  <p>Slowly she dropped down on her knees just where he too had knelt two nights
    ago, and like unto him she clasped her hands together, scarce conscious that
    the tiny wooden cross still lay between her fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou hast conquered, oh Galilean!&rdquo; she murmured, whilst great
    sobs that would not be suppressed rose to her throat. &ldquo;At thy call
    he left everything that makes life beautiful and happy: at thy call he left
    me to mourn, he left the people of Rome who acclaimed him, he left the throne
    of Augustus and the Empire of the world! Everything he left at thy call!
    What hast thou in thy nail-pierced hands to give him in return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a while now she was able to give way to her immeasurable sorrow. Her
    head buried in the pillow whereon his head had rested, she sobbed out her
    loving, aching heart in a passionate fit of weeping.</p>
  <p>Just like the Christian yesterday up on the heights, so was she&mdash;the
    pagan&mdash;alone now with her grief. More lonely than he&mdash;she had no
    anchorage, and in her ear had never sounded those all-compelling words, sublime
    in their perfect gentleness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come unto Me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But who shall tell what divine hand soothed her burning forehead? what divine
    words of comfort were whispered in her ear?</p>
  <p>Gradually her tears ceased to flow, the heavy sobs were stilled, her aching
    and bruised body felt numb with the pain in her heart. But outwardly she
    was more calm. She rose from her knees, and hiding the small cross in the
    bosom of her gown, she drew forth the letter and read it through once more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If only I knew!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;If only I could understand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After a while she bethought her of the slave Folces, the one human link
    left now between herself and the man whom she loved and who was gone from
    her.</p>
  <p>With reverent hands she smoothed out the couch, the pillow which had supported
    his head, the coverlet which had lain over him. She was loth to go from this
    room whose every corner seemed still to hold something of his personality
    and whose every wall seemed to hold an echo of his voice.</p>
  <p>She would have stayed here for hours longer, talking to that absent personality,
    powerful and mysterious more than ever now, listening to the rugged voice
    which she would never hear again. But there was something that she must do
    ere she gave herself over finally to her dreams; there was a duty to accomplish
    which she knew he would ask of her.</p>
  <p>Therefore&mdash;after a last, long, all-embracing look on the place which
    would for ever be as a sanctuary in her sight&mdash;she went back to the
    studio at last, and herself going to the door she called Folces back to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The praefect of Rome, good Folces?&rdquo; she asked as soon as the
    man had entered, &ldquo;wilt see him again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Taurus Antinor named Anglicanus hath left Rome to-day on his way
    to Syria, O Augusta!&rdquo; said the man, humbly insisting on the name of
    his master.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost not go with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hath commanded me to stay here and to look after his household
    until such time as he doth direct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His household?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had not thought of that.
    What is to become of his house in Rome, his villa at Ostia and his slaves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The praefect of Rome,&rdquo; said Folces, &ldquo;made ere he died
    a testament wherein he did command the freedom of all his slaves, and ordered
    a certain sum of money to be set aside which will enable even the humblest
    amongst us all to live decently like freedmen. The house in Rome and the
    villa at Ostia are to be sold, whilst the remainder of Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s
    private fortune is to be administered by his general agents. He said that
    he would see to it later on. I am still his slave; he did not confide in
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet he asked thee to look after his household.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will take a little time until the manumissio testamento can take
    effect. In the meanwhile we all are Taurus Antinor&rsquo;s slaves and must
    look after his houses until they have been sold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wilt be happy as a freedman, Folces?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Augusta,&rdquo; replied the man simply, &ldquo;for then I shall
    be at liberty to follow Taurus Antinor as his servant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She sat quite silently after this, her tear-stained eyes fixed into vacancy.
    Folces was on his knees waiting to be dismissed. It was some little while
    before she remembered his presence, then in a gentle voice she bade him go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall I take a message back to my master?&rdquo; he asked humbly. &ldquo;I
    could find him, I think, if I had a message.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no message,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;go, good Folces.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter35"></a>Chapter 35</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty
    to do.&rdquo;&mdash;St. Luke 17. 10.</p>
  <p>Half an hour later Dea Flavia Augusta was in the tablinium. She had received
    Caius Nepos, the praetorian praefect, Marcus Ancyrus, the elder, my lords
    Hortensius Martius, Philippus Decius and the others, and they, who had heard
    so many conflicting rumours throughout the morning and were beginning to
    quake with fear, for none of the rumours were reassuring, were grouped trembling
    and expectant around her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lords,&rdquo; she began as soon as she had received their obsequious
    greetings, &ldquo;I know not if you have heard the news. The C&aelig;sar
    hath succeeded in quitting Rome; he is on his way to rejoin his legions and
    nothing can stand in the way of his progress. In a few days from now he will
    make his State re-entry into the city, and the city will resound from end
    to end with rejoicings in his honour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had all heard the news, Augusta,&rdquo; said Caius Nepos who was
    vainly trying to steady his voice and to appear calm and dignified, &ldquo;and
    also that a proclamation of pardon hath preceded the entry of the C&aelig;sar
    into Rome and hath been affixed to the rostrum of the great Augustus by the
    consul-major himself this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what do you make of all this, my lords?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That some gods of evil have been at work,&rdquo; muttered young Escanes
    between set teeth, &ldquo;and spirited the tyrannical madman out of the way
    for the further scourging of his people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The spirit, my lords,&rdquo; she interposed quietly, &ldquo;that
    led my kinsman to safety last night was one which actuated the noblest patrician
    in Rome to do his duty loyally by the C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then curse him for a traitor,&rdquo; muttered Caius Nepos, whose
    cheeks had become white with terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was no traitor to you, my lords,&rdquo; she retorted hotly, &ldquo;for
    he was not one of you. He was true to the oath which he had rendered to the
    C&aelig;sar; aye, even to the C&aelig;sar whom we, my lords, all of us here
    present had been ready to betray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as she saw nothing but sullen faces around her and not a word broke
    the silence that ensued, she continued more calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yesterday you came to me, my lords, with proposals of treachery to
    which I, alas, did listen because in my heart I had already chosen one man
    who I felt was worthy to rule over this great Empire. I had made my choice
    and myself offered him the imperium, the throne of Augustus and the sceptre
    of the C&aelig;sars.... But he refused it all, my lords, and went forth in
    the night to place himself body and heart at the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And his name, O Augusta?&rdquo; queried Ancyrus, the elder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hath name Taurus Antinor and was once praefect of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is dead!&rdquo; broke in Hortensius Martius hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He lived long enough, my lord,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;to show
    us all our duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence after that, for many a heart was beating spasmodically
    with fear or with hope. My lord Hortensius Martius sat on a low stool, with
    his elbow on his knee, his chin buried in his hand. His eyes, glowing with
    dull and sullen hatred, searched the face of Dea Flavia, trying to read what
    went on behind the pure, straight brow and those liquid blue eyes, deep as
    the fathomless sea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; said Ancyrus, the elder, with a pitiable
    look of perplexity directed at the Augusta.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To make our submission to the C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;those
    of us at least who are not afraid of his wrath. For the others there is still
    time to seek a safe retreat far away from Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But this is monstrous!&rdquo; cried Hortensius Martius, suddenly
    jumping to his feet and beginning to pace up and down the room in an outburst
    of impotent wrath. &ldquo;This is miserable, cowardly, abject! What? Would
    ye allow that stranger, that son of slaves, to thwart your plans by his treachery?
    Are we naughty children that can thus be sent, well-whipped and whining to
    bed? Up, my lords, this is not the end! C&aelig;sar is not yet in Rome! The
    people are still dissatisfied. Hark to the noise in the Forum below! Does
    it sound as if the populace was accepting the news with rejoicing? Up now,
    my lords! It is not too late! Acclaim your new C&aelig;sar; it is not too
    late, I say. When the legions return with that mountebank at their head let
    them find Dea Flavia Augusta and her lord the acknowledged masters of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked flushed, excited and proud, feeling that even at this eleventh
    hour he could carry these men along with him if Dea Flavia put the weight
    of her power on his side. Now he paused in his peroration, standing above
    his fellow-conspirators as if already he were their ruler, and looking from
    one face to the other with eager restless eyes that expressed all his enthusiasm
    and all his hopes.</p>
  <p>But the two older men had evidently no stomach for the situation as it now
    was. It had been easy matter enough to murder the C&aelig;sar treacherously
    and while his legions were three days&rsquo; march away. But now everything
    was very different, the issues very doubtful; no doubt that a safe retreat
    away from the city would be by far the wiser course.</p>
  <p>Caius Nepos, with vivid recollections of his last interview with the C&aelig;sar,
    shook his head with slow determination. Ancyrus, the elder, was silent and
    only the three younger men had followed Hortensius Martius in his heated
    argument.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What sayest thou, Augusta?&rdquo; asked Philippus Decius at last,
    looking doubtfully upon the young girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That ye must make your plans without me, my lords,&rdquo; she said
    coldly.  &ldquo;Since, as you say, the praefect of Rome is dead, I can make
    no choice worthy of him who is gone. I choose to return to mine allegiance,
    my loyalty to the C&aelig;sar and to my House.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If the C&aelig;sar returns,&rdquo; urged Hortensius Martius, &ldquo;he
    will vent some of his wrath on thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then will I suffer for my treachery, my lords,&rdquo; she rejoined
    proudly,  &ldquo;in accordance with my deserts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Augusta ...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you, my lord,&rdquo; she interposed haughtily, &ldquo;do not
    prolong your arguments. My mind is made up. An you value your own safety
    in the future, &rsquo;twere wiser to make preparations for a lengthy stay
    away from Rome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hadst thou listened to us yesterday ...&rdquo; sighed Ancyrus, the
    elder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A heavy crime had lain against us all,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Be
    thankful, my lords, that in the history of Rome when it comes to be written,
    your deed will not have sullied the page that marks to-day. And now, my lords,
    I bid you farewell! You are in no danger if you leave the city forthwith.
    The rejoicings at the entry of the C&aelig;sar and the homecoming of his
    legions will last many days, during that time your names will be erased from
    the tablets of my kinsman&rsquo;s memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The gods grant it!&rdquo; murmured Caius Nepos. &ldquo;But thou,
    Augusta, what of thee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, my lords,&rdquo; she said with a gentle smile, the irony of which
    was lost on their self-centred intellects, &ldquo;I pray you have no thoughts
    of me. I have been placed in the keeping of one who, I am told, is mightier
    than C&aelig;sar. There must I be safe; so farewell, my lords; we meet again,
    I hope, in happier and more peaceful times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stood up and one by one&mdash;for was she not still the Augusta and
    the favourite kinswoman of the C&aelig;sar?&mdash;they bent the knee before
    her and kissed the hem of her gown. After which act of homage they retired
    with backs bent and walking backwards out of the room.</p>
  <p>My lord Hortensius Martius was the last to take his leave. He went down
    on both knees and would have encircled the Augusta with his arms, only she
    drew back quickly a step or two.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dea ... in the name of my love for thee ...&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>But she interrupted him gently, yet firmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak not to me of love, my lord,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
    but love&rsquo;s ghost that moves to and fro when you speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as he would have protested, she put up her hand with a gesture of finality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is no use, my lord. What love there is in me, that you could never
    have aroused&mdash;not even in the past. I entreat you not to insist. Love
    cannot be compelled. It is or is not. Whence it comes we know not; mayhap
    the gods do know ... mayhap there is only one who knows ... and he seems
    to give much, but also to take all.... Therefore mayhap love comes from him,
    and when we are not prepared to give up all for love&rsquo;s sake, then doth
    he withhold the supreme gift and leave our hearts barren.... Mayhap! mayhap!&rdquo; she
    sighed, &ldquo;alas! I know not! and you, good my lord, do not look so puzzled
    and so scared. I bid you farewell now. I&rsquo;ll not forget you; to remember
    is so much easier than to love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had perforce to accept his dismissal. He felt rebellious against fate
    and would have liked to have forced her will. But as she stood there before
    him, clad all in white, so young and so chaste and yet a woman who knew what
    love was, an awed reverence for her crept into his heart and he felt that
    indeed he would never dare to speak again to her of love.</p>
  <p>He too kissed the hem of her tunic now, just as the others had done, and
    just as they had done he walked out of her presence backwards with back bent
    and an overwhelming disappointment in his heart.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter36"></a>Chapter 36</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding.&rdquo;&mdash;Philippians
    4. 7.</p>
  <p>Three months had gone by since then. Rome had acclaimed the C&aelig;sar
    and rejoiced over his homecoming. There were holidays and spectacles, chariot
    races and gladiatorial combats, and the people of Rome forgot that it had
    ever shouted:  &ldquo;Hail Taurus Antinor C&aelig;sar! Hail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now the calls were for Caius Julius C&aelig;sar Caligula, and those who
    had most loudly shouted for his death, cringed most obsequiously at his feet.
    The very name of the ex-praefect of Rome was already forgotten.</p>
  <p>His testament, made, it appears, just before his death, had been copiously
    commented on at first. All his slaves had received their freedom together
    with a sufficient sum to enable one and all to live in comfort in the new
    state of freedom. The rest of the vast property owned by the late praefect
    was being somewhat mysteriously administered, and up to this hour no one
    had been able to gain any definite information with regard to its ultimate
    destination. There were those who averred that a great deal of ready money&mdash;including
    the proceeds of the sale of the late praefect&rsquo;s house in Rome and of
    his villa at Ostia&mdash;had found its way to a section of very poor freedmen
    who lived on the Aventine and who formed a somewhat isolated little colony
    not viewed altogether kindly by the official magistracy of the city.</p>
  <p>But all that was mere gossip and did not withstand the test of time. After
    three months people had plenty of other matters to think of and to talk about.</p>
  <p>There were the festivals and games which had accompanied the re-entry of
    the C&aelig;sar into Rome. The city had been beflagged and adorned with banners
    and with garlands. For thirty days did the rejoicings last, and brilliant
    sunshine shone over the golden glories of autumn and kissed the foliage of
    oleanders until they blushed a brilliant crimson, and tinged the marble of
    palaces and temples every morning with rose.</p>
  <p>The games in the great Circus went on without intermission for thirty days;
    there were military and naval pageants, combats between the lions from Numidia
    and the new hyenas and crocodiles; there were gladiatorial contests and chariot
    races. Much human blood was shed for the delectation of the masters of the
    world, much skill displayed, much prowess vanquished by prowess greater,
    much valour laid to dust.</p>
  <p>But the C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s pet black panther did not appear again in the
    Circus. The mighty fist of the dead praefect had mayhap laid the creature
    low; in any case it were not safe to re-awaken dormant memories.</p>
  <p>And Caius Julius C&aelig;sar Caligula, the father of his armies, the best
    and greatest of C&aelig;sars, showed himself at all these pageants more crazed
    than ever; he hardly ever spoke now to the people. &lsquo;Twas averred that
    C&aelig;sonia, his wife, had given him a potion to cure him of his infatuation
    for Dea Flavia, his kinswoman, whom he had exalted above all the other Augustas,
    and whose absence from Rome and from all festivities had rendered him half
    distracted with wrath.</p>
  <p>He would have liked to vent that wrath on Dea, but he could not lay hands
    on her. She had left her palace even before his re-entry into Rome, taking
    none but two of her most trusted slaves with her; the others did not know
    whither she had gone. Some thought that she had gone on a journey to a villa
    which she possessed in Sicilia, others thought that she was living a life
    of retirement in a lonely dwelling on the Sabine Hills, preparatory to devoting
    her virginity to the glory of Vesta.</p>
  <p>Caius Julius C&aelig;sar Caligula prepared to have her sought for throughout
    the length and breadth of his Empire, and would no doubt have succeeded in
    time in this search had not a few months later Chaerea, the praetorian tribune,
    done the work with his hands which the dagger of young Escanes had failed
    to do.</p>
   <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
   <p>The winter had been slow in coming, but it had come at last. An icy wind
    blew from across the sea. Overhead the sky was the colour of lead and great
    banks of clouds chased one another wantonly above the hills that tower over
    Jerusalem.</p>
  <p>There was hardly a path up the rugged incline, the rains and winds and snows
    of the past seven years had obliterated the marks which a surging crowd had
    once made in the wake of the sacred feet.</p>
  <p>It was close on the ninth hour and the shadows of evening were already drawing
    in very fast. A tall figure dressed in sombre garments walked slowly up the
    hill which is called Calvary.</p>
  <p>His head was uncovered and he had no wand wherewith to ease his footsteps;
    the blustering gusts of wind blew the tawny hair over his brow.</p>
  <p>He held his head erect and his eyes did not watch the places where trod
    his feet. They were fixed on ahead, up toward the summit of the hill, there
    where a Cross stood broken and lonely with wooden arms outstretched and the
    birds of heaven circling all round it.</p>
  <p>Every day for seven days now had the pilgrim wandered up the steep desolate
    hill. Every day for seven days he had reached the summit ere the ninth hour
    was called from the city walls. He lived at a small inn just inside the third
    wall, and every day at noon he set out upon his pilgrimage and only came
    home when the darkness of the night lay dense upon the valley.</p>
  <p>To-day he was more weary than he had ever been before. His feet felt like
    leaden weights that seemed to be dragging him down and ever downwards, and
    the loneliness of the place had its image within his heart.</p>
  <p>On the summit he fell on his knees and knelt at the foot of the Cross, leaning
    his aching forehead against the cold, dank wood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long, oh my God, how long?&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;The misery
    is more than I can bear. I am ready to do Thy work, oh God, to speak Thy
    Word where Thou dost bid me go, but take her image, dear Lord, from before
    mine eyes, it stands for ever  &rsquo;twixt Thy Cross and me. Break my heart,
    oh God, since her image fills it and its every beat is not in Thy name. Take
    the cup from me, dear Lord! It is too bitter and I cannot drink!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The night drew in around him; the lights in the city below were extinguished
    one by one. The croaking birds on the lonely Cross had found a home far away
    in the gloom.</p>
  <p>The pilgrim knelt against the Cross, he could hardly see the objects nearest
    to him, the small prickly shrubs, the rough grass, the loose stones that
    looked so white and spectral in the waning light. He could hardly see, for
    his eyes ached with the dull misery of tears that would not fall; but suddenly
    a sound softer than that made by a night-bird in its flight struck upon his
    ear.</p>
  <p>It was like the drawing of a garment upon the rugged ground. One or two
    small stones detached themselves from their bed of wet earth and rolled away
    from under the tread of feet that walked upwards toward the summit.</p>
  <p>The pilgrim did not move, and yet he heard the sound. It came nearer to
    him, and nearer, and suddenly he was not alone; something living and warm
    knelt on the stony ground beside him, and gentle fingers that had the softness
    and the coolness of snow were laid upon his burning hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came as quickly as I could,&rdquo; said a tender voice close to
    his ear.  &ldquo;But it has taken me some time to find thee. Had it not been
    for Folces and his devotion I might mayhap never have found thee. We came
    to Jerusalem yesterday. To-day at noon I saw thee starting forth from out
    the city. I followed thee, but the way was rough.... I feared I should never
    reach the summit ... and yet &lsquo;twas here I wished to speak to thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All this while he had remained numb and silent. He knew even when first
    her hand touched his that God had ended his sorrow and taken his aching soul
    into His keeping at last. But for the moment he thought that sweet death
    had kissed his eyelids and that this was the first taste of paradise. Darkness
    was closing in around them both; he could scarcely distinguish her features,
    but it seemed to him as if glory shone out of her eyes, glory so radiant
    that it illumined the darkness and pierced the walls of the night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it thou?&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Oh God! have pity on me! Her
    image, her sweet image, allow it to fade from my mind ere my brain becomes
    a traitor to Thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not a vision, dear heart,&rdquo; she whispered softly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    not a dream. It is I, Dea Flavia, whom thou didst call the beloved of thy
    heart. I came because I loved thee and because here on this spot I would
    learn from thee the mysteries of thy God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it thou? And hast thou come to me from heaven?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, dear heart, only from far-off Rome. And I have come to thee,
    to be with thee and to follow thee wherever thou wilt lead me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet will my wanderings lead me far,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my Lord
    has called and I must go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then will I go with thee,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To far-off lands, dear heart, to speak the Word of God to those who
    heard it not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will go with thee,&rdquo; she reiterated simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To far-off lands whence I came, a sea-girt land which once was mine
    own. My fathers lived there. I would go back and tell my people of all that
    I saw here on Calvary seven years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then thither will I go with thee,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;thy
    home will be my home, thy people my people and thy God shall be my God, for
    thine am I now and always. I am ignorant yet but this I do know, that thy
    God must be the great, the true and only God. None other God but He could
    have put in thy heart the strength of sacrifice which hath brought thee&mdash;who
    had Rome at thy feet&mdash;a lonely wanderer to the foot of this Cross.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She knelt beside him and he no longer cowered, limitless joy was in his
    heart and immeasurable gratitude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the Son of Man shall come in the glory of the Father with His
    angels, and then He shall reward every man according to his works.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The wings of the wind brought the sacred words to his ears. He kissed the
    rough wooden Cross there where the Divine feet had rested, and Dea Flavia
    pressed her lips on it too, and the peace that passeth all understanding
    descended upon them both.</p>
  <p>Overhead the clouds had parted, their silver lining showed clearly against
    the dull blue sky, and in the midst of that rent in the firmament, far away
    in the limitless beyond, a star shone out bright and clear.</p>
  <p>Then they both rose, and hand in hand they walked slowly down the hill.</p>
