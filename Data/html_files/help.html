<h3><a name="homer" id="homer"></a>Reading, downloading and
converting ebooks</h3>

<p>The ebooks on this site are in the public domain in Australia
(that is, they are not subject to copyright in Australia) and may be read and
downloaded without charge. If you need help with some of the terms
used here, go to the <a href="#definitions">definitions</a> section
at the end of this page.</p>

<p>ebooks which are HELD ON THIS SITE can be available as a
TEXT (.txt) file, HTML (.html) file, EPUB (.epub) file, MOBI (.mobi) file
or PDF (.pdf) file or any combination of these file types. The file types are
shown on the listing for each ebook. Here is a listing of an available
ebook which is available in several file types:--</p>

<p><b>John BUCHAN (1875-1940)</b><br>

The Thirty-nine Steps (1915)--<a href="/ebooks/m00014.txt" target="_blank">Text</a>--<a href="/ebooks/m00014.html" target="_blank">HTML</a>--<a href="/epub-ebooks/The-Thirty-nine-Steps--John-Buchan.epub">EPUB</a>--<a href="/mobi-ebooks/The-Thirty-nine-Steps--John-Buchan.mobi">MOBI</a></p>

<p>To read one of our ebooks online, simply click your mouse on the
blue link for the file type of your choice.</p>

<p>If you wish to transfer the file to your own computer (so that
you can read it when not connected to the internet, using a word
processor, a text editor, an ebook reader (e-reader) or an interent
browser such as Microsoft Edge) you need to click the
<b>RIGHT</b> mouse button on the blue link for the required file type,
then save the file to the location of your choice. Once
downloaded, it is best to view <b>Text</b> files using a
non-proportional font, such as 'Courier New', so that any
formatting within the text file is displayed correctly.

<p>Specifically for <b>HTML</b> files, it is best op <i>left</i> click on "HTML'" then
<i>right</i> click anywhere on the page of the file you have
just opened, and then SAVE the file.

<p>Later in
this article we discuss in greater detail, <a href=
"#ways-to-read">ways to read</a> our ebooks.</p>

<p>Some of the ebooks listed on this site are not actually held on
this site. Instead a link is provided to transfer the user to
the location of the actual book. Once transferred to the internet
location of the actual ebook, the available formats of the ebook
will be displayed. The instructions outlined in the above
paragraphs will apply if you want to read and/or download the
ebook.</p>

<p><a name="ways-to-read" id="ways-to-read"></a><b>WAYS TO READ OUR
EBOOKS</b>
</p>

<p><b>Reading ebooks on your personal computer or laptop, e-reader,
phone or tablet</b>
</p>

<p><b>e-readers and tablets</b>
</p>

<p>Once downloaded to your computer, ebooks can be transferred to
an <b>e-reader</b> or <b>tablet</b>. We are not able to provide advice
about transferring files to e-readers or tablets as there are many
different devices and many different formats are supported. You
need to consult the user guide accompanying your e-reader or
tablet. However, it is safe to say that ebooks for the
<i>Kindle</i> are usually in MOBI or AZW format and that most other
e-readers and tablets support the EPUB format.</p>

<p><a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/"><i>Calibre</i></a> is
<b>free</b> software which will convert the TEXT and HTML files
which we provide, into the relevant format for your e-reader. The
software can be downloaded from the <a href=
"http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre web site</a>. If we provide a
HTML file for the ebook you are interested in, it is best to
convert that file, rather than the TEXT file, to MOBI or EPUB
format as required.</p>

<p><b>web browsers</b>
</p>

<p>A web browser, such as <i>Microsoft Edge</i> or  <i>Chrome</i>,
is usually supplied with desktop computers, laptops, mobile
phones and tablet computers. This browser will enable you to read
our ebooks although you will not be able to
bookmark where you are up to in reading the ebook. In the next
section we discuss another way of reading our files which is more
like reading on an e-reader, but without the need to convert our
files.</p>

<p><b>apps (applications) which &quot;mimic&quot; e-readers</b>
</p>

<p>Free, or low cost, apps (applications) are usually available
from the &quot;app store&quot; associated with each particular
phone or tablet computer, and from the internet for desktop and
laptop computers, which will enable you to read our TEXT files and
HTML files, while at the same time allowing you to bookmark pages,
change the font size of the words and perform other functions to
enhance the reading experience. This same software will also read
ebooks in the epub format, in which case you may wish to use
<i>Calibre</i>, mentioned in the previous paragraph to convert the
file which you have downloaded from Project Gutenberg Australia
into EPUB format.</p>

<p><b>More questions?</b>

<p>If you have other questions they may be answered at Project
Gutenberg's <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/help/"
