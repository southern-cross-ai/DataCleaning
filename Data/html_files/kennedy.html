<p>Edmund Kennedy was second in command of Sir T.L. Mitchell's
exploration party, which started in December 1845 to endeavour to
find a route to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Read about Mitchell's
expedition, <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#mitchell">"Journal of
an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia"</a>.</p>

<p>On their return at the end of 1846, Mitchell suggested that
Kennedy should be sent to explore the course of the Victoria River
(now the Barcoo River). Read about this expedition, which took
place in 1847, in <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#kennedye">Expedition to
ascertain the course of the River Victoria</a>.</p>

<p>It was also hoped that Kennedy might find a convenient route to
the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria. His fatal second expedition to
the tip of Cape York commenced in April 1848. It is described in
<a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#carron">Narrative of an
Expedition Undertaken Under the Direction of E. B. Kennedy</a> by
William Carron, a survivor of the expedition. Arriving at
Rockingham Bay (north of Townsville) in May, Kennedy's party, after
much privation and toil, reached Weymouth Bay, where they
established a depot. Kennedy, with four others, Costigan, Dunn,
Luff, and a native, Jacky Jacky, left this depot in an endeavour to
reach Cape York, where a relief ship was expected. Kennedy and
Jacky Jacky continued north, after leaving the others at Shelburne
Bay. Only the native reached Cape York, for in a skirmish with
blacks Kennedy was killed. Jacky Jacky guided the ship's relief
party to Shelburne Bay, but Costigan, Dunn, and Luff had perished.
At the Weymouth Bay depot, only two survivors were found.</p>
