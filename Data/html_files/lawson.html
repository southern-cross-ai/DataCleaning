<p>Henry Lawson became a literary legend in his own lifetime and was loved by the Australian public. He was the first Australian<br>
writer granted a state funeral. Lawson wrote short stories and poems with sympathy and humour. He depicted Australian men,<br>
women and children and Australian rural life in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>

<p>We believe that we have an ebook for every book published by Lawson during his lifetime. Go to
<a href="/plusfifty-a-m.html#lawson">Lawson's listing</a> to view the list<br>
and read the books.

<p>The complete works of Henry Lawson in two volumes, <i>A Camp-fire Yarn</i> (CFY) and <i>A Fantasy of Man</i> (FOM)<br>
were published in (1984).

<p>Below is a list of all of Lawson's <b>poems</b> showing the source of each. Those poems which were<br>
published in newspapers, but not in a published book are collected in our "Collected Poems of Henry Lawson."

<p>Below the list of poems is a list of a number of <a href="#books">Henry Lawson's published books</a>, showing the contents of each
