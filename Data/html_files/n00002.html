<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>The reasons for this book are as follow:&mdash;Whilst talking
over early days with Mr. Courtenay-Luck, the popular Secretary of
the Commercial Travellers' Club, that gentleman suggested that I
should write a paper, to be read at a meeting of the Historical
Society of Queensland.</p>
<p>In writing that paper, so many long-forgotten men, places and
incidents came back to memory that I thought my reminiscences
might prove interesting to others. I may be occasionally
incorrect in dates, or in the sequence of events, but I relate
facts and personal experiences. As they are, I leave them to the
kind consideration of readers.</p>

<h1>Reminiscences of Queensland</h1>
<h2>1862-1899.</h2>
<br>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>As it is in the blood of most Englishmen from the "West
Country" to seek adventure abroad, it is little wonder that the
visit of an uncle from Australia strengthened a desire I felt to
seek my fortune in that country. This uncle&mdash;H. C.
Corfield&mdash;was the owner of some pastoral country in the
Burnett district, and described in glowing terms life in the
Australian bush. I might say here this was not all it had been
painted, but that by the way.</p>
<p>And so it happened that on a cold, foggy morning in February,
1862, I found myself with an old schoolmate&mdash;George
Custard&mdash;on board of, as it was then customary to advertise,
"the good ship, 'City of Brisbane,' 1,100 tons burthen,
'Neville,' Master," which lay in Plymouth Sound, waiting her
final complement of passengers for Queensland.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry Jordan, who was representing the Colony, came on
board to address the passengers, who, he said, were going to a
land of promise, where in the evening of his life, a man&mdash;as
the reward of his labour&mdash;would sit in the shade of his own
fig tree and enjoy the rest he had earned.</p>
<p>Soon the capstan was manned, and the anchor lifted to the old
chantey:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>For tinkers, and tailors, and lawyers, and all,<br>
Way! Aye! Blow the men down!<br>
They ship for real sailors, aboard the Black Ball,<br>
Give me some time to blow the men down.<br>
Blow, boys, blow, to Californeo-o-!<br>
There's plenty of gold, so we've been told,<br>
On the banks of Sacremento!<br></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a> This we found was our
good-bye to England, and, towed out by a tug, we commenced our
long voyage to Australia. When well clear of the land, the tug
dropped us, and with a favourable breeze, we made quick passage
to the entrance of the channel.</p>
<p>By this time most of the passengers were suffering the usual
disabilities felt by landsmen for the first few days at sea. I
soon gained my sea legs, and was able to take a view of my
surroundings.</p>
<p>Here we were&mdash;365 human beings, who would be cooped up
for weeks in a sailing ship, and with as many different
characters, sympathies and antipathies, one wondered if it could
be possible to live long with harmony and unselfishness in such
daily crowded contact. I suppose we were representative of the
many, who, whether in the poop or steerage of similar ships, were
looking hopefully towards the far off, not-long-named southern
colony, which was becoming known to the people of Great
Britain.</p>
<p>I was just nineteen, and all things looked bright and
cheerful, but I was impatient for the time when, on a bounding
steed, I would be scouring the plains, following the sheep and
cattle on my uncle's property where, as an employee, I was to
begin my adventures.</p>
<p>After a passage of 137 days, spent either in glorious runs
before favouring winds, wearisome calms, or battling against
heavy gales, we arrived in Moreton Bay, and in due course at
Brisbane.</p>
<p>The city, as it was in 1862, has so often been described, that
it is unnecessary for me to say anything as to its appearance.
All I need say is that it did not enter my mind to anticipate its
growth and importance.</p>
<p>Our ship's surgeon was Dr. Margetts, who, for many years
afterwards, practised his profession at Warwick. It is to his
credit that we had no deaths on the voyage, but immediately after
landing, a little girl passenger died. I helped to dig her grave
on the ridges somewhere out towards Fortitude Valley.<a name=
"Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a> My destination was "Stanton
Harcourt," 55 miles north-west from Maryborough, which my uncle
held as a station. He was taking an active part in the great
developments which, at this time, were being carried out by the
squatters. I was directed by my uncle's agents, George Raff and
Co., to engage five or six of the immigrants as shepherds. These
accompanied me to Maryborough by the old steamer "Queensland." On
arrival at Maryborough the shepherds were taken charge of by the
local agents, and I was instructed to ride on to the station. I
left Maryborough alone the same afternoon, but had not gone far
when I found I was bushed. Riding back I struck the main road,
and followed it to the public house at the Six-mile, which was a
favourite camping place for carriers. My new-chum freshness
immediately attracted the attention of the bullock-drivers camped
there, who told me of the dangers I would meet from the blacks,
unless I propitiated them by generous gifts of tobacco.</p>
<p>These stories so much impressed me that I bought a large
quantity of tobacco from the publican. After that, when I saw any
blacks, even if off the road, I would ride over and give some
tobacco, which surprised and amused them considerably. I arrived
at the public house, at a place known as "Musket Hat," in time
for dinner. A gentleman who knew my uncle happened to be there,
and whilst waiting for dinner, said, "Come out, and I will show
you a good racehorse." Outside a horse was being groomed by a
man, who took some pains to describe his good points. I
appreciated the man's kindness, and on leaving handed him a
shilling to buy a drink. This he took with a smile, and thanked
me. I felt somewhat small when my friend told me that I had
tipped the owner of the horse himself, and that he would tell the
joke in such a way that it would be long before I forgot it, and
this proved to be so.</p>
<p>Towards sundown, my friend left me at the turn off of the main
road. My first ride through Australian bush was very lonely, and
I was very timid. I heard what sounded like revolver shots, loud
shouting, and much swearing. This I learned later was the
ordinary language used when driving bullocks, while what I took
to be revolver <a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a>shots, was
the cracking of bullock-whips. At the time I imagined a battle
was being fought with bushrangers, but it turned out that it was
merely the station bullock teams going to Maryborough for stores,
and to bring up the hands engaged by me, with their
belongings.</p>
<p>I found the station in charge of a manager, and that my uncle
had gone north in search of new country for the sheep. Grass seed
and foot rot were playing havoc with the sheep on "Stanton
Harcourt." Shortly after my arrival, 1,000 head of cattle
purchased from White, of Beaudesert, reached the station. In
those days pounds were unknown, and I now had my first experience
in drafting cattle <a name="openyard" id="openyard">in an open
yard.</a> An old cow, evidently knowing that I was raw, came at
me, and would have caught me, but that my hat fell off and
attracted her attention. She impaled the hat instead of me. My
next lesson was in bullock driving. I was sent with two loads of
wool to Maryborough, having a black boy to drive one team, and
another boy to muster the bullocks. These would not allow the
black boys to go near them to yoke up, so I had to do this for
both teams. After capsizing my dray three times on the road, and
pulling down a fence in the town, I delivered the wool. The
blacks had a short time before stuck up several drays, and
carried the loading in their canoes across the river.</p>
<p>On the far side there was a dense scrub through which it was
difficult to track them. My boys said I would be stuck up when
passing this spot, so I rode on the dray, carrying a loaded
revolver. However, I was not molested, probably due to the fact
that, unknown to me, Lieutenant Wheeler with his troopers were at
the moment busy among the blacks.</p>
<p>My uncle had returned before me, but had not been successful
in securing country. When lambing came on, Custard and I were
sent out without any special instructions to lamb a flock of
ewes. Following the strong mob back to the yards in the evening,
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a>the lambs tried my temper.
I provided myself with stones, and being a fairly good shot, I
reduced the percentage of lambs to some extent.</p>
<p>One night there was a great stampede in the yard, and thinking
it was a dingo among the sheep, I went out with a gun. Seeing an
object moving in the dark, I fired both barrels, and the supposed
dingo fell. I had shot one of the ration sheep which had been
dropped during the day. Being without any control or instructions
in regard to the sheep, we decided our working hours to
be&mdash;rise at 7 a.m., breakfast at 7.30, start work at 8. The
sheep remained in the yard until the last-mentioned hour. This
did not improve their condition. One morning my uncle arrived
before we had turned out, and expressed himself strongly upon the
laziness of new chums in general. Excusing ourselves by the fact
that it was not yet seven did not calm the atmosphere. My uncle
was one who insisted upon plenty of time for a long day's work. I
very quickly learned the value of early rising in the bush, and
in the interest of the sheep, when necessary, to go without
breakfast.</p>
<p>I remember my first night alone in the bush. I was sent to an
out-station with 300 sheep, and a black boy to assist in driving
them. At sundown I could see nothing of the hut. I had read that
fires would keep off native dogs or dingoes. I tied my horse to a
tree, and gathered wood, forming a ring of fires around the
sheep. The black boy said something to me in his own language.
Thinking he asked me if he should bring some more wood, I replied
with the only word I knew, "Yewi." After a little time I missed
the boy, and cooeed for him. He replied as from a distance. I
wondered why he had gone so far when there was plenty of wood
close by. He did not return, and it was not long before my horse
broke away. All night was spent walking around the sheep. What
weird sounds I heard, and what strange shapes I saw moving. When
one is alone in the bush at night, even after years of
experience, the imagination is apt to run riot. Especially is it
so at midnight and <a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a>towards
the small hours of the morning. At daylight the sheep commenced
to move. I followed them, carrying my saddle and bridle. About
mid-day one of the station boys found me, and inquired why I sent
the black boy home. It then dawned on me why I had been left
alone. The boy had asked to be allowed to go home, and I had said
"Yewi"&mdash;yes. I suppose I was only undergoing the usual bush
experience of the new chum, and had a good deal to learn, but I
was undoubtedly learning.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Following the cotton strike in England during 1863, a large
number of Lancashire operatives emigrated to Australia. As the
station needed shepherds, the agents in Brisbane were instructed
to engage two married couples and three single men. I was
despatched with a black boy, three horses and a dray, to bring
them from Maryborough. Their luggage filled the dray, but I
managed to find room for the two women and the children. The
others had to walk. The first day out we reached Mr. Helsham's
station at South Doongal. He allotted me an empty hut for the
party. At dinner that evening I told him and the overseer how
very frightened the emigrants were of the blacks. "Is that so,"
he said. "Well, we will try them to-night after the boys have had
their evening corroborree." A number of blacks were camped there
at the time, so he sent word to his station boys to come up. When
they did so, he told them to surround the hut, and yell out,
"Kill 'em white fella, kill 'em white Mary." We went down to see
what we thought was fun. I never had to run harder than I did to
reach the station before the new chums, who streamed out of the
hut in their night attire, and made for the house. I had the
greatest difficulty in pacifying them. They refused to return to
the hut, and camped on the verandah, the single men remaining on
watch.</p>
<p>After their flight from the hut, the pigs appropriated their
rations which confirmed their belief in a narrow escape from
wholesale slaughter. I felt sorry for the joke, more particularly
as for the remainder of the journey they would not leave the
dray, or go for water, unless the black boy or I went with them.
As shepherds these men were not a success. They were invariably
losing sheep, adding to my responsibility as overseer.</p>
<p>In September of that year, I had my first experience of
shearing&mdash;getting through 20 the first day. It was
back-aching and wrist-breaking work, and I longed for the day
when I went out with the ration pack-horse.</p>
<p>In those days the sheep were hand-washed in a water hole, in
which we worked up to our middle all day. The blacks had to be
watched very closely, as, if opportunity offered, they would
catch a sheep's hind leg with their toes, and drown the animal,
expecting they would get the meat. I detected them in the act, so
I burnt the carcase. This put an end to the practice. Mustering
and branding the cattle followed the shearing, and these were
much livelier occupations. We had a heavy wet season in that
year, and I had plenty of opportunities to gain experience in
flooded creeks. About April, 1863, Edward Palmer (years
afterwards M.L.A. for Carpentaria), who was in charge of his
uncle's station "Eureka," four miles from "Stanton Harcourt,"
started with the sheep depasturing there for the Gulf country. He
eventually settled at Canobie, on the Williams River, a tributary
of the Cloncurry.</p>
<p><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a>In September one of the
new shepherds absconded, leaving his sheep in the yard at an
out-station. I was instructed by my uncle to take out a summons,
and applied to Mr. W. H. Gaden, a neighbouring squatter, for it.
The summons was sent to Maryborough for service. In due time I
had to appear as prosecutor. The man had engaged a solicitor,
who, when the case was called on, applied for a discharge, as the
summons did not state it was sworn to, but only signed W. H.
Gaden, J.P. The man was discharged on these grounds. I was not
sorry. He was useless as a shepherd, but through him I had
obtained an enjoyable ride to Maryborough with all expenses
paid.</p>
<p>My uncle in the meantime had again started out to seek new
country for the sheep, and engaged Mr. Walter Carruthers, of
Carruthers and Wood, Rocky Springs station, Auburn River, to take
charge of the mob of 12,000, leaving instructions that they were
to start before the end of 1864.</p>
<p><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a>Great preparations were
required to equip the party. We were taking 30 saddle horses, two
bullock teams, and one horse team. In addition to the stores, we
had to provide all sorts of tools, etc., to build and form a new
station.</p>
<p>I preferred to drive one of the bullock teams. My duties on
arrival at camp were to erect a tent and two iron stretchers for
Carruthers and myself, take my watch every night from three to
daylight, and then to muster the bullocks. In the case of dry
stages I also had to take water to the men.</p>
<p>When passing through Gayndah I purchased tobacco from John
Connolly (who died lately at the very great age of 102 years),
and for which I had to pay &pound;1 per pound.</p>
<p>When we came to the Dawson River, near Mrs. McNabb's station,
it was in flood. We felled a big tree across the stream, and with
boughs and other timber, improvised a bridge. For three days we
were working in our shirts only, getting the sheep and&mdash;when
the water fell&mdash;the teams across. Mosquitoes, sandflies, and
a hot sun made us nearly raw. Along this road Carruthers had his
favorite horse "Tenby" stolen. He had hung the animal up to the
verandah post of a wayside public house, to see the sheep and
teams pass. After they had gone by, and while Carruthers was
having a drink, a man jumped on the horse and galloped away.
Carruthers walked on to the sheep, got a fresh horse, and with
our black boy followed the thief until they came to the spot
where, in a piece of scrub, he had pulled the mane and tail of
the horse to alter its appearance. Darkness coming on, they had
to abandon further pursuit. The horse was a very fine chestnut. A
new saddle and bridle, a pouch containing cheque book and
revolver, were taken with him, so the robber had a good haul.
There were no telegraph stations out back in those days.</p>
<p>When passing Apis Creek, near the Mackenzie River, I met a man
named Christie, whom I afterwards learnt was Gardiner, the
ex-bushranger. We passed through Taroom, Springsure, <a name=
"Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a>on to Peak Downs station, where we
essayed a short cut on to the Cotherstone road, but when we had
got half-way, the owner made us turn back. I had a very rough
time driving the leading dray through the loose, black soil, and
was glad to get back on the road, which was well beaten by the
teams carrying copper from Clermont to Broadsound.</p>
<p>We eventually reached Lord's Table Mountain, where we had
permission to remain, whilst I took the drays into Clermont to be
repaired, and to obtain an additional supply of rations. Whilst
staying at Winter's Hotel, I met Griffin, the
warden&mdash;afterwards hanged for shooting the troopers guarding
the gold escort, of which he was in charge.</p>
<p>I also met Fitzmaurice, destined in after years to become my
partner in the far west. He had brought in drays from Surbiton
station to be repaired.</p>
<p>Carruthers then rented some country from Rolfe, on Mistake
Creek, on which to shear the sheep. I shore 800. My salary was
now &pound;80 per year, for which I acted as overseer,
bookkeeper, and giving a hand as general utility at all kinds of
work. After shearing, the sheep were taken down to Chambers'
Camp, on the same creek, whilst I took the wool to Port Mackay.
When crossing the Expedition Range, before reaching Clermont, on
my way from Mistake Creek, I rode over to a small diggings to
purchase meat. The only butcher was a man named Jackson, whose
wife served me. She was a fine, comely woman, whom I afterwards
met on the Lower Palmer, where her husband was keeping a store.
He was burnt to death on Limestone Creek on that river.
Eventually, she married Thos. Lynett, a packer from Cooktown to
Edward's Town (as Maytown was popularly known), and who, with
Fitzmaurice and myself, was, in later years, one of the founders
of Winton, on the Western River. Mrs. Lynett lately died in
Winton at the ripe age of 84, her husband, Tom Lynett, having
pre-deceased her some years. Like most of the women who
pioneered, she had a grand heart, and I learnt how the diggers
appreciated her motherly kindness.</p>
<p><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a>The early wet season
caught me at Boundary Creek, ten miles beyond Nebo. I was stuck
in a bog for five weeks, rain pouring the whole time. I
eventually delivered the wool, loaded up rations from Brodziak
Bros., and started on my return journey. In those days the range
was in a primitive state, and coming down my mate capsized his
dray. While I was assisting him, I had a Colt's revolver stolen
off my dray, presumably by some of the road party who were
cutting down the steep parts.</p>
<p>After crossing the range, the pleuro broke out amongst my
bullocks, and I lost one whole team. I went into Retreat station
and purchased several steers. The hot weather and heavy pulling
soon killed these, leaving me stranded on the Isaacs River. One
day a squatter from North Creek station rode up, and hearing my
plight, said there was a team of bullocks running on his country
for several months. Who the owner was, or where they came from,
was unknown. Acting on his hint, I picked out what I considered
the best, and continued my journey to the sheep. Having met my
requirements, I turned the bullocks loose. In response to
enquiries, I denied that I was the owner of them; they had served
my purpose, and I was content to let well alone.</p>
<p>The blacks were very bad, and continually worrying the men we
had shepherding. One of these was rather daft. One night the rams
did not return. I got on their tracks the next day and brought
them to camp, but there was no sign of the shepherd. Two evenings
after we were surprised to see a couple of Myalls bringing in the
lost man. We gave the blacks some tucker, and they left, but not
before the shepherd, raising his hat, said to them, "I thank you,
gentlemen, most sincerely." His eccentric manner had doubtless
saved his life, as the coloured races generally appear to respect
a demented person.</p>
<p>I had a very bad attack of fever and ague, and managed to ride
into Clermont, where I was treated by a chemist named Mackintosh,
who kindly allowed me to stay at his house. I <a name="Page_18"
id="Page_18">[18]</a>shall never forget the kindness of him and
his wife in pulling me through. Carruthers in the meantime had
taken the sheep back to a creek which is still known as
"Corfield's Creek." There the lambing took place.</p>
<p>We next moved down to Balgourlie Station, still on Mistake
Creek, where we had an early shearing, and left the wool to be
taken by carriers to Bowen.</p>
<p>I now had my first experience of what was called in those
days, "Belyando Spew." Everything one ate came back again and no
one seemed to know of an antidote to what appeared to be a summer
sickness. The gidya around seemed to accentuate the complaint,
until I became a walking skeleton.</p>
<p>In the meantime we received word that my uncle had purchased
Clifton Station from Marsh and Webster, of Mackay.</p>
<p>This country was situated on a billabong 12 miles from
Canobie, where Edward Palmer, as I have previously mentioned, had
settled down.</p>
<p>The travelling away from the gidya scrubs down the Belyando
River soon dispelled all signs of the sickness.</p>
<p>Previous to leaving Balgourlie Station we had lost a mob of
horses, and on our arrival at Mount McConnell Station, the two
men who had been despatched to look for them, returned without
success. Carruthers then sent me back with an Indian named
"Balooche Knight" to make a search. We had a riding horse each,
and a pack horse to carry our blankets, tucker, etc. After
scouring all the scrubs on Mistake Creek, we arrived at Lanark
Downs Station, where a traveller informed me he had seen a number
of horses at Miclere Creek, 17 miles on the road to Copperfield.
My optimism suggested I should ask the owner of Lanark Downs to
lend me a fresh horse. He did so, and I rode away one morning,
returning the same evening with the whole of the 17 horses we had
lost. I had now to travel over one hundred miles to where I had
left the sheep, which were still continuing their journey. It was
a most enjoyable ride <a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a>with
only one drawback. The Indian's blankets and mine being together,
I had gathered a lively community in my head. Procuring a small
tooth-comb at a way-side place, I commenced operations, with the
result that soon I had quite a colony on a newspaper in front of
me. With the aid of tobacco water, I finally succeeded in driving
the pests away.</p>
<p>In following down the Belyando River, I proved my expertness
as a tracker by recognising the track of a bullock crossing the
road. I did not know the beast had been lost, but the peculiarity
of the track, caused by the hind feet touching the ground ahead
of the fore feet, led me to follow the tracks through a scrub,
and there I found him camped. We had over 60 miles to overtake
the sheep, and as he could not keep up with the horses, I had to
leave him.</p>
<p>We had passed St. Ann's and Mt. McConnell's Stations where
Lieutenant Fred Murray was stationed with his black trackers.
Proceeding up the Cape River, we overtook the sheep at Natal
Downs, then owned by Wm. Kellett. We left the Cape River here,
and followed Amelia Creek through a lot of spinifex country.</p>
<p>On the third camp, in my early morning watch, I noticed
several of the sheep jumping. At daylight we found about 60 lying
dead on the ground. We learnt that they had been eating the
poison bush which abounds throughout what is designated as the
"Desert Country."</p>
<p>The leaf of this bush is shaped like an inverted heart, and in
colour is a very bright green. The flower resembles a pea
blossom, and when in bloom the bush is most deadly to all stock.
This experience taught us to be more careful, and in one place we
cut a track through five miles of it for the sheep to pass.</p>
<p>When we reached Torren's Creek, we saw a water-hole containing
the bones of some 10,000 sheep which had perished from the same
cause. They were a portion of 20,000, which, <a name="Page_20"
id="Page_20">[20]</a>we were informed, were in charge of a Mr.
Halloran, who had preceded us for the Flinders, and owned by a
Mr. Alexander.</p>
<p>We afterwards passed a green flat, quite dry, but in the wet
season covered with water, called "Billy Webb's Lake."</p>
<p>I was suffering from a severe attack of sandy blight in both
eyes, so had to ride a horse which was tied to the bullock dray.
I was <i>hors-de-combat</i> for over a week. Not having any
eye-water, the only relief I could get was cold tea leaves at
night. Both eyes were so swollen that I was completely blind.
Fortunately, we met the McKinlay expedition returning from an
unsuccessful search after Leichhardt. The doctor gave me a bottle
of his eye-water, which he informed me contained some nitrate of
silver; this he instructed me how to use, and I soon regained my
eye-sight, but the eyes continued very weak.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards we met some travellers, and enquired how
far it was to the jump-up&mdash;meaning the descent from the
plateau to the level country at the head of the Flinders. They
replied, "in two miles you will be amongst the roly-poly."</p>
<p>These we found were not stones, as we thought, but dry stumps
of a weed which grows on the open downs in the shape of a ball.
The strong trade-winds blow the plant away from its roots, and
send it careering over the downs, jumping for yards, and high in
the air, frightening one's horse when it gets between his hind
legs, giving him the impression that he had slept, and dreamt he
was young again.</p>
<p>We passed Hughenden Station, which had just been taken over by
Mr. Robert Gray from Mr. Ernest Henry, and camped the sheep where
the town of Hughenden now stands.</p>
<p>We then had a long stage of fifteen miles to the bend of the
river without water. The remainder of our trip down the river was
uneventful. We passed Telemon (Stewart's), Marathon (then owned
by Carson), Richmond Downs (Bundock and Hayes), Lara (Donkin
Brothers), and Canobie (Edward Palmer).</p>
<p><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a>At Clifton, our
destination, there was a fine water-hole two and a-half miles
long, trees on the banks were crowded with cockatoos, corellas,
with galahs in flocks on the plains.</p>
<p>Work soon commenced in earnest, and progress made, in building
a small house, sheep yards, and the necessary improvements for a
sheep station. The country consisted of plains, with patches of
scrub between, in which there was abundance of salt-bush, all
carrying good feed for the sheep.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Carruthers' agreement to take charge of the sheep until
they arrived at their destination having expired, my uncle wrote
me to take over the station, and advised that if I remained in
charge, he would increase my salary to &pound;200 per year. As
Carruthers was anxious to return to his station, I accepted the
former, but replied that unless the pay for managing was
increased to &pound;300 per year, to send someone at once to take
my place.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the blacks had come into Canobie at night,
and attacked three men who were camped on the river, within sight
of the station. They killed two, and the third was left for dead.
He was found to be alive, and afterwards recovered from the
severe battering he received.</p>
<p>Palmer sent word asking me to send all the men I could spare
to come over to assist in hunting the murderers. I did so,
Carruthers taking charge of the armed party.</p>
<p>A few days previous to this occurrence I had visited an
out-station to count the sheep, taking a man with me to help in
repairing the yard.</p>
<p>On returning after dark we passed a billabong, from which a
very strong stench, as if from decomposed vegetable matter,
arose. The following morning we both felt unwell, and vomited a
good deal. The man with me was much older than I, and succumbed
to the sickness in nine days.</p>
<p>After the party had left for Canobie, I was completely
prostrated, and had no medicine on hand except Epsom salts.
During the night we (the cook, a new-chum Cockney, and myself)
heard voices down at the water-hole, which we took as from a
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a>party of travelling
Chinamen. In the morning we found that, some of the blacks who
were implicated in the murder had doubled back, and had taken
away every article of iron they could find, our camp oven
included, and my clothes, which had just been washed. This so
preyed on my mind that when the party returned, they found me
delirious.</p>
<p>Mr. Carruthers, seeing the helpless state I was in, and the
condition of affairs generally, engaged Mr. Reg. Uhr to take
charge on my behalf, whilst he took me down to Burketown, distant
155 miles, in a cart, with two horses. The road was almost
deserted, and the blacks were very bad. Carruthers would boil his
billy at water-holes in the afternoon, and go out to the centre
of the plains to camp, with no bells on the horses. As for
myself, I was sick and weak. Not being able to eat damper or
meat, I was almost starved, lost all vitality, and cared little
whether I survived the trip or not. We had to cross the "Plains
of Promise." These consisted of an uninterrupted run of about 30
miles of devil-devil country. It was a succession of small
gutters and mounds, which, to a sick man in a cart without
springs, was intolerable. We arrived at Burketown about November,
1866, and the public house was the only place in which I could
get accommodation. There I suffered all the nightly noises
incidental to a bush shanty.</p>
<p>Burketown at this time was an almost new settlement, with a
population of about 50 whites, but the number of graves of those
who died within its short life from fever was more than twice as
many, and increasing daily.</p>
<p>The Burketown fever was more virulent than any other I had
hitherto or since come in contact with, and was supposed to be a
kind of yellow jack fever, introduced by some vessel from Eastern
countries.</p>
<p>The danger of a second introduction of the same, or perhaps
worse, epidemic does not appear in these days to be realised in
Australia.</p>
<p><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a>There was no doctor in
the town, but a chemist named Peacock was practising as one. Just
as I arrived, Captain Cadell, in the old "Eagle," arrived to send
despatches of his explorations of the rivers on the west coast of
the Gulf of Carpentaria, where the party had seen numerous herds
of buffaloes.</p>
<p>Mr. Carruthers heard that there was a doctor with the
expedition, and on his interviewing him, the latter said he would
see me, provided I paid the fee to the resident doctor. This
professional etiquette was agreed to. The doctor took great pains
in diagnosing my case, which he called something between a
gastric and jungle fever, and prescribed five grains of calomel
every night. This I found later to have loosened my teeth, and 15
grains of quinine daily seriously affected my hearing. The local
chemist was then sent for. He felt my pulse, looked at my tongue,
and prescribed a box of Holloway's pills. I paid him his fee of
one guinea, but almost needless to say which advice I
followed.</p>
<p>I remained in Burketown about a fortnight, slowly recovering.
Before leaving I purchased a microscope which was for sale, and
presented it to the doctor of the expedition with sincere thanks
for saving my life. During the time I was in Burketown, Mr.
Sharkey, Lands Commissioner, came over from Sweers Island, and
offered to submit my name for the Commission of Peace, and said
Mr. Landsborough, the Police Magistrate, would swear me in. I
declined the honour.</p>
<p>When returning to Clifton Station we spent a week at
Floraville Station, on the Leichhardt River. Here I purchased
stores for the station from Mr. Borthwick, who was managing for
Mr. J. G. Macdonald. At this station there was a water-hole 25
miles long, and in bathing one would see crocodiles basking on
the rocks and bank, but they appeared to be harmless. At the
lower end of this hole there was a perpendicular drop of over 40
feet, with a very deep hole at the foot, infested by sharks and
alligators. The tides came to this point.</p>
<p><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a>We called at Donor's
Hill Station, where I first made the acquaintance of the Brodie
brothers, one of whom afterwards managed Nive Downs for a number
of years. The other&mdash;his twin brother&mdash;died in New
South Wales not long since, after a long and successful business
career. At this place I visited a cave containing many skulls of
blacks, who had been dispersed by the whites, after committing a
series of depredations in the district. I was told the cave was
so dark that matches were lighted to allow of aim being taken at
the blacks during the dispersal.</p>
<p>In later years, I have often thought what fortunes might have
been won, or lost, or the settlement of Western Queensland been
advanced by years, had the early seekers for pastoral country but
known what was west of the so-called desert country, and south of
the Flinders. This could only be learnt by forcing a way through
the desert to the west instead of skirting its edge and going
north. As it was, we, in following the Flinders down, were
traversing some of the finest sheep country in the world, and did
not realise there were millions of acres lying to the south,
unknown, unowned. Ultimately, settlement of the west was affected
more from Rockhampton than from northern ports; extending as it
did from Springsure towards Tambo, Blackall, and thence north and
north-west.</p>
<p>It seems, however, the irony of fate that Townsville, which
did little or nothing towards the exploration or development of
the country south from the Flinders, has obtained the trade of
that portion of Queensland. But this is anticipating.</p>
<p>Mr. J. F. Barry, who first took up the country on the head of
the Western River, was laughed at by residents of Blackall, when
he rode in to have his application registered, and described the
country. So that it might be recorded that his statements as to
its quality would prove correct, he called the country "Vindex,"
by which it is now known as one of the finest sheep properties in
Queensland.</p>
<p><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a>But let me quote from
"<i>The Polar and Tropical Worlds</i>," written by two
scientists, one apparently a German, the other designated
"Scientific Editor of the American Cyclopedia." The book was
published in 1877, eleven years or more after the north-western
country was becoming occupied.</p>
<p>In alluding to the great deserts of the world, these
authorities say:&mdash;"Perhaps the most absolute desert tract on
the face of the globe is that which occupies the interior of the
great island, or as it may not improperly be styled, 'Continent
of Australia.'</p>
<p>"The island has an area of something more than 3,000,000 of
square miles, nearly equal in extent to Europe.</p>
<p>"For the greater part of its circumference, it is bounded by a
continuous range of mountains or highlands, nowhere rising to a
great height, and for long distances, consisting of plateaus or
tablelands.</p>
<p>"There is, however, a continuous range of water-shed, which is
never broken through, and which never recedes any great distance
from the Coast.</p>
<p>"The habitable portions of Australia are limited to the slopes
of the mountains, and the narrow space between them and the sea.
The interior, as far as is known, or as can be inferred from
physical geography, is an immense depressed plain more hopelessly
barren and uninhabitable than the great desert of Sahara."</p>
<p>These authorities say more on this imaginary desert, but the
quotation is sufficient to show that even scientists do not know
everything, although one might believe that they did.</p>
<p>I have not learnt that either Messrs. Landsborough or
Phillips, who were on the Diamantina in 1866, and crossed from
that river over to the Flinders, commented on the quality of the
country through which they travelled, and I can only explain that
its naturally waterless state up to early in the eighties
prevented its value becoming known.</p>
<p><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a>During these years
immense sums of money were spent in water conservations by the
Government of the day and Victorian investors, and in a large
measure without meeting success.</p>
<p>When I went to Townsville in 1868, the principal, and also the
first carrier there, was a man named Courtney, who owned eight
bullock teams. He had been taking stores to the different
stations on the Flinders as that country was opened up. In
conversation one day, he informed me that some two or three years
previously his bullocks had strayed many miles across the downs
from Richmond Downs. Seeing the beautiful sheep country still
extending to the south, he determined to explore it to learn if
there were any good water courses. Taking a pack horse with
rations, he started on a S.W. course until he found a large river
running in a southerly direction. A few miles further north the
river runs from west to east. He marked a tree with his initial
C., and this was found long afterwards to be on a water-hole
between Kynuna and Dagworth. He expected to realise money on his
exploration, but the Diamantina country was, as I have previously
remarked, occupied by people coming from the Central district.
The route from Townsville through long stretches of dry country
was out of the running.</p>
<p>In after years Courtney took to drink. Finally, after one of
his bouts, on leaving Normanton in an intoxicated condition, he
camped at a water-hole 10 miles out. His clothes were found, but
not the body. It was supposed that he had gone in for a swim, and
that alligators, which swarm in these holes, had taken him. I
could not learn if he had given any information as to the
country, but I have no reason to doubt his statements.</p>
<p><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a>After my return to
Clifton, I was kept busy preparing for lambing. This did not turn
out very successful. The hot, scorching sun so scalded the backs
of the lambs, that the growth of wool was greatly retarded.</p>
<p>After a month's hard work, I found myself so weak and
depressed from the fever that I decided to return to England. In
the meantime, Carruthers had left for his station on the Auburn
River.</p>
<p>I was relieved in mind, by a letter from my uncle, who
informed me that my request for a salary of &pound;300 a year was
exorbitant, and that he was sending a Mr. Hawkes to take the
station over from me.</p>
<p>Soon after I was pleased to welcome this gentleman, and left
for inside with a young fellow named Carolan, who had been
working on Canobie. My uncle visited Clifton late in 1867, and
decided to have the sheep boiled down at the works owned by Mr.
Harry Edkins, on the Albert River.</p>
<p>During his stay at Burketown he became the guest of Mr.
Surveyor Sharkey on Sweers Island, and met Miss Huey, sister of
Mrs. Edkins, late of Mount Cornish Station, who became the second
Mrs. Corfield. His first wife was a Miss Murray, sister of the
highly-respected Police Magistrate, who died in Brisbane a few
years ago, and also of the late Inspector Fred Murray. Her death
on Teebar, in 1853, so affected my uncle that he sold the
property for a nominal sum to his head stockman, John Eaton. He
then took up and formed Gigoomgan, which he soon after sold to
Anderson and Leslie. He afterwards bought Stanton Harcourt from
W. H. Walsh, of Degilbo Station. There I joined him in 1862.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></p>
<p>After handing the station over to Mr. Hawkes, I went to
Canobie to muster my horses, which were running on the Williams
River, and thence travelled eastward in company with Carolan.</p>
<p>On arrival at the Punch Bowl, on the Flinders River, we heard
that there was a hundred mile dry stage ahead, so decided to
camp.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Mr. Roland Edkins, later so long manager of
Mount Cornish, and his wife, travelling on their honeymoon, drove
up and asked if we had any meat we could spare. I informed him we
had none, but that if he had a gun, and lent it to me, I would
get some. A mob of cattle had been to the water-hole earlier in
the day. Armed with his gun I followed the cattle and shot a
clean-skin, which we dressed, and jerked in the sun, not having
salt. The supply of meat was sufficient for all our needs. Mr.
Edkins informed us that thunderstorms had fallen up the river, so
we made a start. While camping in the bed of the river one night
the water came down on us rather suddenly. We managed to get our
belongings up the bank before they became wet.</p>
<p>In those days thunderstorms seemed to be more prevalent during
November than in later years. Before we reached Telemon, the
river was a banker, flooding the plains, and compelling us one
night to camp on an ant bed, which was the only dry spot we could
find. Fortunately, the ants were not of the bulldog breed.</p>
<p>We arrived at Telemon about noon of a sweltering hot day, and
found Mr. Stewart, the owner, lying on his bunk with a tallow
cask in close proximity, the grease oozing out on to his <a name=
"Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a>bed. He invited us to have some
dinner, and we gladly availed ourselves of the invitation.
Learning that we were bound for the coast, he advised us to take
the short cut up Bett's Gorge. Mr. Stewart had been adjutant of
the Cameron Highlanders during the Crimean War, and was then
considered to be the smartest officer in the regiment. When he
came to Australia, and took up the runs of Southwick and Telemon,
he altered so much that he became known as "Greasy Stewart." When
spoken to about it, he would say, "When you are amongst savages,
do as savages do." Otherwise he was in manners and conduct a
gentleman, and a delightful conversationalist. When visiting
Sydney he was considered to be a remarkably well-dressed man. He
afterwards became the possessor of a large estate in Scotland,
where he died.</p>
<p>We found the creek running through Bett's Gorge a banker, and
had to swim 23 crossings in one day. Being so often in the water,
we did not trouble to dress, consequently the sun played havoc
with our bodies.</p>
<p>All the country for miles around being of a basaltic nature,
our horses became very footsore, and when we reached Lolworth
Station we asked Mr. Frank Hann, the manager, if he would allow
us to spell them. He consented, and invited us to the house. We
stayed there about three weeks, assisting him at mustering, and
branding the cattle.</p>
<p>The Cape River diggings had just broken out, and as I was now
getting stronger&mdash;the fever was going off gradually&mdash;I
decided to remain in Australia, and try my hand at gold
digging.</p>
<p>Both Carolan and myself were novices at the game, especially
in putting down a shaft. We decided to go up on a spinifex ridge,
out of sight, to sink, what turned out to be a three-cornered
shaft, and so gain experience. This we bottomed at 100 feet,
obtaining good specimens of shotty gold. Mr. Robert Christison,
owner of Lammermoor Station, and Mr. Richard <a name="Page_31"
id="Page_31">[31]</a>Anning, from either Cargoon or Reedy Springs
Stations (I forget which), arrived with two horses and a dray.
They camped close to us, and like ourselves, intended trying
their luck at gold digging.</p>
<p>Whilst working at this, one Sunday evening, we overheard some
Chinamen speaking of a flat they were going to in the morning. We
decided to watch, and follow them. At daylight they made a rush
to peg out claims; we did likewise, and obtained one well placed
as to water. The difficulty then was how to work both claims, and
it was decided Carolan should get a mate and go on with the deep
sinking on which we were working. I was to work the shallow one
myself. Our first claim turned out to be on the edge of rich
gold-bearing country, which was good while it lasted, but soon
petered out. The surrounding claims turned out very rich, and got
the name of the "Deep Lead."</p>
<p>In the meantime I had bottomed my shaft at eleven feet. It
turned out to be a very wet one, so I had to work without my
shirt. When I took the first dish down to wash, I noticed a
number of men taking great interest in it, especially when the
panning-out showed two dwts. of shotty gold in the dish. The men
engaged me in conversation. When I returned to my claim, I found
my pegs thrown away and fresh ones surrounding the shaft in place
of them. I strongly demurred to this, but without avail, until a
party of men who were our camp neighbours came over and took my
part. Through them I recovered my claim without more than wordy
warfare. After doing well out of the claim I found I could not
continue it without a mate. Having to throw the wash-dirt eleven
feet, a lot of the pebbles in it would come back on and bruise my
naked body.</p>
<p>Carolan and his mate determined to sink another shaft in the
deep sinking to hit the lead again. We had a consultation, and
decided I should take in as partner an old miner known as "Greasy
Bill," who possessed a horse and cart, cradles, and all the plant
required for shallow sinking.</p>
<p><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a>For the first month we
were getting as much as an ounce and a-half to the load of sixty
buckets. As I puddled the wash-dirt he cradled it, and
consequently was in possession of the gold bag which held the
proceeds from the cradle. Although I could detect no difference
in the wash-dirt, the cradling results dwindled down by degrees
to a quarter ounce per load. As this did not pay our tucker bill,
my mate suggested we should sink another shaft, which we
bottomed, and it turned out with similar results. Carolan had now
sunk his second shaft with no payable results, and as I was
dissatisfied with the result of my new venture, we both decided
to go prospecting. This we did, dry-blowing in the ranges with no
payable results.</p>
<p>I afterwards met "Greasy Bill" at the Cape township, when he
informed me that after I had left he had struck it rich in both
claims. Others told me he had boasted he had got five hundred
pounds out of the claim by abstracting the gold from the bag when
I was not looking, and that the claim I pegged out was good
throughout.</p>
<p>Our experiences as diggers had completely disgusted Carolan
and me, so on hearing that carriage of loading to the gold field
was very high, we determined to start as carriers.</p>
<p>I heard that a Mr. Mytton, of Oak Park Station, had a team of
bullocks for sale, and having some money in the Savings Bank at
&mdash;&mdash;, we decided to travel to Oak Park to
investigate.</p>
<p>On reaching Craigie Station, on the Clarke River, to enquire
the way, Mr. Saunders, the owner, informed us that he had seven
bullocks and a dray for sale for &pound;120, but I wished to
purchase a full team of 12 or 16, such as Mr. Mytton had at Oak
Park, and decided to go there. Mr. Saunders kindly lent us a
Snider rifle for protection, as the blacks were bad through the
ranges, between his station and Mytton's.</p>

<div>Fitzmaurice, Corfield, And Tom Fox.<br></div>
<div>(Taken in 1880).</div>
<br>
<p>We camped the first night at the Broken River, a weird looking
place. This was about May, 1868, and the nights <a name="Page_33"
id="Page_33">[33]</a>being very cold we would place one blanket
under and have the other over us, with our heads on the saddle,
and the rifle between us. During the night I was awakened by my
saddle being pulled from my head. I immediately caught the rifle,
and turning around saw a native dog dragging my saddle by one of
the straps. Without waking my mate, who was a man six feet in
height, I fired&mdash;&mdash;. Carolan made one leap, taking the
blanket with him, saying he was shot. This frightened me also.
However, the howling of the dog who had apparently received the
bullet through his body, and full explanations restored calm and
a feeling of safety. In the morning we tracked the dog to the
water-hole, where we found him dead.</p>
<p>On arrival at Oak Park, without further adventures, I found
Mr. Mytton had leased his team of bullocks and waggon to a man
named Jack Howell, who contemplated carrying. The latter was
credited with being double-jointed, and I believe it. He was the
strongest man I ever met. He afterwards married the widow of
Jimmy Morrell, who had lived for seventeen years with the blacks
in the Cleveland Bay district.</p>
<p>It is related that when he saw a white man after this length
of time, Morrell jumped on a stock-yard fence, and called out,
"Don't shoot, I'm a British object." The Government gave him a
position in the Customs in Bowen, where he died a few years
afterwards.</p>
<p>I later on attended Jack Howell's wedding. It was held in a
house at the foot of Castle Hill, in Townsville. Some, uninvited,
came up to tin-kettle the newly-married couple, but on Jack
putting in an appearance they showed discretion and scampered
away, leaving one of their mates hung up on a clothes line.</p>
<p>During our stay of three days at Oak Park, we received great
kindness, which led to a life-long friendship with Edward Mytton.
Carolan and I returned to Craigie Station to give back the
borrowed rifle. I then decided to purchase <a name="Page_34" id=
"Page_34">[34]</a>the seven bullocks and dray, giving Saunders a
cheque for the price mentioned. I had to muster the bullocks
myself, finding four of them the second day. Mr. Saunders said he
would go out to find the remainder, as he knew where they were
running. We both started, but in different directions. I found
the tracks, and succeeded in bringing the bullocks to the yard,
but Mr. Saunders did not turn up until the next evening, having
been bushed on his own run. The bullocks were very fat, and had
no leaders amongst them, so Mr. Saunders gave me a hand by
leading my horse and driving the spare bullock. At every
water-hole we came near these brutes would rush in, and I had to
go, with my clothes on, after them. Carolan had left me at
Craigie, and gone on to a public house at Nulla-Nulla, on the
main Flinders road from Townsville. He bought in shares with a
teamster, who had two teams, and as there was good grass and
water, there he decided to camp. Here I met "Black Jack," who
said he was the first white man to cross the Burdekin. Carolan
having come out to give me a hand, Mr. Saunders returned to
Craigie.</p>
<p>There were several carriers camped at Nulla, amongst them
being a man named James Wilson, from whom I bought five bullocks.
One of these was a good near-side leader, for which I was
grateful. From that time Wilson and I became travelling mates. We
loaded in Townsville for the Cape River diggings at twenty pounds
per ton.</p>
<p>As my additional bullocks allowed me to put on three tons, the
sixty pounds for carriage enabled me to pay for the bullocks and
supplies for the trip. When I returned to Townsville I met Mr.
Saunders, who had sold me the bullocks. He informed me that my
cheque for payment had been dishonoured, marked "no account."
This news was a staggerer. I explained that I had an account in
the Government Savings Bank at &mdash;&mdash;, and that before I
left the Cloncurry, I had sent my pass book and a receipted order
to the Savings Bank officer, asking him to withdraw the money and
place it to my credit in the local <a name="Page_35" id=
"Page_35">[35]</a>branch of the A.J.S. Bank. Also that I had
advised the bank of the prospective remittance, and following my
request, had received a cheque book. Mr. Saunders was good enough
to accept my explanation, and agreed to remain in Townsville
while I proceeded to &mdash;&mdash;. I had very little money, so
took a steerage passage in the old "Tinonee," which was conveying
a large number of disappointed diggers returning to New <a name=
"eZaland" id="eZaland">Zealand.</a> It was a rough and
uncomfortable trip. One had to stand at the door and snap the
food as it was carried to the table, not to do so meant going
without. On arriving at &mdash;&mdash;, I put up at a boarding
house, which was far from being first class. I called on the
Postmaster, and told him my name. When he heard it he became very
pale, and agitated, and showed great uneasiness. He invited me
into his office, where I stated my business, and added that if my
money was not forthcoming at once I would report him. He then
told me that he was so long without hearing of me, that he was
confirmed in believing the rumour of my death on the way in, and
that he had invested the money in some land, which gave promise
of soon rising in value. I gave him until the next boat was
leaving for Townsville, which would be in four days, to repay the
money. I also insisted upon being refunded my expenses, and a
return saloon fare from Townsville to &mdash;&mdash; and back. He
gladly agreed to my terms, and I promised not to proceed further.
I had a splendid trip back per saloon. I met Mr. Saunders, who
was pleased that I had recovered the money, and remarked, "I
thought you had an honest face," etc. He added that he would give
me preference for loading to the station.</p>
<p>This affair was brought back forcibly to my memory owing to
the matter having been mentioned not long since by a friend of
later years, who, in his capacity as a Government officer,
happened to be stationed in this town some 30 years ago. He told
me of a property bought by the Postmaster of the place, upon
which there was a fine orchard. This was looked after by a German
of gigantic stature, who patrolled the orchard <a name="Page_36"
id="Page_36">[36]</a>with a loaded shot gun. He said that an old
resident of the place had told him that the property had been
bought with money drawn from the Government Savings Bank by a man
out in the Gulf country, who was reported to have died on the
road down, but who turned up some months afterwards, and claimed
his money. I did not at any time speak of the matter, and can
only conclude that the Postmaster raised the money in the town,
and gave the information to the lender. It was peculiar that my
friend, fifty years afterwards, should mention a matter in which
I was so concerned and without having any previous knowledge that
I was the reported dead man.</p>
<p>The late Hon. B. Fahey, M.L.C., was then second officer of
Customs in Townsville. He allowed me to see the ship's manifests
of cargo arriving. I was thus enabled to apply beforehand for
loading to these merchants who would be receiving consignments.
This was a great help to my mate&mdash;Wilson&mdash;and myself to
obtain loading quickly.</p>
<p>When carrying became slack, Mr. Marsh, of Webster and Marsh,
of Mackay, arrived in Townsville, and being an old school-fellow
of mine, said he would send up two loads from Mackay to keep me
going.</p>
<p>About this time (1869), I made the acquaintance of Messrs.
Watson Bros., of Townsville, who were very kind to me, inviting
me to their house to spend the evenings when in the Bay (as
Townsville was then generally spoken of). They had two sisters,
one of whom afterwards married my friend Edward Mytton, and the
other, Mr. Page, in after years of Wandovale Station. They were a
cultured family, and the time I spent with them reminded me of
home life more than anything I had then experienced since I left
England.</p>
<p>On my last trip to the Cape diggings, Wilson and I had
returned as far as Homestead, when Bob Watson rode up, and
enquired for what we would take loading to the Gilbert River. We
knew this place to be somewhere beyond Oak Park, and<a name=
"Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a> we asked for &pound;30 per ton.
This was agreed to, with the proviso that the teams were to be
loaded at night on the Lower Cape. At the time the township was
honeycombed with shafts, and we had many misadventures driving
our teams in the dark. Watson explained the reason for our
loading at night was that the Gilbert diggings had only just been
reported, and his firm wished to get supplies on the ground early
to obtain high prices. We were to travel <i>via</i> the Upper
Cape, Lolworth, Craigie, Wandovale, Junction Creek. Lyndhurst,
and Oak Park, etc.</p>
<p>Long before we reached the latter place droves of people of
both sexes, in all sorts of vehicles, on horse back, and afoot,
passed us. The news had quickly spread that good gold had been
found on the Gilbert.</p>
<p>This move of the Watson's was rather smart. They had a
quantity of damaged flour to get rid of. We had to purchase our
rations from them. The only way in which we could use the flour
was to make it into johnny cakes, and eat them hot. Flour was
selling at 3/- for half-a-pint, and the damaged flour soon found
ready customers at fancy prices.</p>
<p>The township consisted of tents, but as the storekeepers
required something more substantial than calico, I sold my
tarpaulin for a good price, and made contracts to supply bark at
5/- per sheet. We engaged men to strip the bark. This work kept
us both busy hauling with our teams, and lasted until the wants
of the township were fully supplied.</p>
<p>We then started on our 350-mile journey back to Townsville,
and reached there about the end of September. Mr. Mytton arranged
for me to load for him, and I obtained a load for my mate for
Lyndhurst, the station adjoining.</p>
<p>This station was managed by a Mr. Smith from the Clarence
River. For some reason, I could not learn how, he was known as
"Gentle J&mdash;&mdash;." He was a remarkably small man, but was
noted as being a very plucky one. His store was stuck-up<a name=
"Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a> by a man called "Waddy Mundoo-i,"
from his having a wooden leg. Smith fought and knocked him out,
afterwards giving him help to get along the road. We spent about
a fortnight in Townsville having repairs made to the drays, etc.,
and we started on our return journey to Oak Park on the 14th of
November, 1869, making as much haste as possible before the wet
season set in. This, however, caught us at the Broken River,
where we had to camp for over nine weeks. We were joined here by
many other teams loaded for the Gilbert.</p>
<p>With us we had an old ship's carpenter, who helped to make a
canoe from a currajong tree. On the stern he attached a board, on
which was painted "Cleopatra, Glasgow." This boat proved very
useful in ferrying over the large number of footmen arriving
daily, and saving our rations, as all travellers expected to be
fed without payment. One day we ferried Inspector Clohesy and his
troopers across the river, which at the time was running very
high. After a great deal of difficulty and some danger, we landed
them and 2,000 ounces of gold in safety. Before the river was
crossable for teams, I cut my name on a tree, bearing date 1870,
which I again saw many years later. On arrival, we were warmly
welcomed at the station.</p>
<p>When in Townsville I had asked Fitzmaurice, who had reached
there from Peak Downs and was going to Sydney for a spell, to get
a waggon made for me below. I now decided to turn out my bullocks
at Oak Park to spell, and take on stock riding and droving fat
bullocks into the diggings, where Mr. Mytton, having taken a
partner named John Childs to look after the station during his
absence, had opened a shop, and was butchering himself. Mr.
Childs was married and had one little girl, named Beatrice, now
married to one of our greatest sheep-owners.</p>
<p>Amongst those who camped a night at the Broken River was a
young new-chum Irishman, who asked if we knew a man in
"Australia" called Tom Ripley. We replied "Yes, he is <a name=
"Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a>now at the Gilbert with his
teams." He said, "I am his brother; he has bullock cars, hasn't
he?" This remark, simple as it was, a long standing joke among
the carriers.</p>
<p>In conversation we gleaned that he had left Ireland on the
same day that we had left Townsville, had crossed the ocean, and
was passing us bound for nearly the same destination as
ourselves.</p>
<p>As two hundred and fifty miles is to thirteen thousand, so was
the speed of bullock teams attempting travelling during the wet
season to that of a sailing ship from the foggy seas.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></p>
<p>My mate, Jim Wilson, returned to Townsville after delivering
his load at Lyndhurst. Mr. Mytton had purchased Junction Creek
Station (afterwards called Wandovale), from Mr. Cudmore, and had
left the Gilbert to take delivery, intending afterwards to go on
to Townsville to be married to Miss Watson. As the station was
short-handed, and Mr. Mytton wished to make some alterations to
prepare for his bride, he asked me if I would stay and use my
team to bring in the timber, and also to assist Childs with the
cattle. I consented to remain for a couple of months. During this
time the black boys on the station bolted, taking with them Mrs
Childs' gin, and my black boy. A carpenter named Jack Barker and
myself started with three horses in pursuit, eventually finding
the absconders where the Woolgar diggings now are. On our return
we ran out of rations, and lived on iguanas, snakes, opossums,
etc. Childs induced me to take charge of a mob of bullocks, and
drove them to Wandovale, where Mr. and Mrs. Mytton were now
living.</p>
<p>After delivering the bullocks at Wandovale, I returned to Oak
Park to muster my bullocks and horses, and found a bay mare
missing. Although assisted by the stockmen, we failed to find
her. I then determined to start for Townsville, and again take up
carrying. When I reached Wandovale on my way down, I camped at
the station. Returning from putting my bullocks on grass, I saw a
number of Chinamen with pack horses preparing to camp at the
creek. One of their horses attracted my attention, so I rode over
and recognised my mare. I rode on, and watched the direction in
which the Chinamen hobbled their horses. Mr. Mytton and I then
decided that <a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a>I should go
out before daybreak to bring the mare in. He was to be at the
slip rails to allow the animal to be driven into the paddock. In
the dark of the early morning I had a difficulty in locating the
animal amongst so many horses. Eventually, I found her, but I
could not catch her. At daybreak I saw she was long hobbled, and
getting near enough, struck her with the bridle, I turned her
towards the station. The Chinamen were just starting out for
their horses, and seeing me, tried to cut me off, and then ensued
a race for the slip rails. I had half-a-mile to go to reach the
paddock; however, putting on a spurt, I succeeded in reaching the
slip rails first, hunting the mare through them, but I was
completely winded. In response to the Chinamen's "Wha for," Mr.
Mytton said he was a Justice of the Peace, and dared them to
interfere with anything on his property. It ended by my giving my
name and address, after stating that the mare was my property,
and had been stolen from Oak Park Station.</p>
<p>Some time afterwards Inspector Clohesy, who was in charge of
the police on the Gilbert, informed me that the Chinamen had come
to him for redress, but he remembered how I had helped him and
his escort across the Broken River, and assured them that he knew
I would not have taken such action unless the mare was my
property. The matter ended, and I found out afterwards the mare
had been stolen and sold to the Chinamen.</p>
<p>Mention of Inspector Clohesy reminds me that he was a
remarkable personality, now-a-days not so common&mdash;tall,
slight and wiry, he could sit a horse as well as the best of
riders and hold his own with men of all sorts. Endowed with quick
insight into the character of men who were in many instances
indifferent to law, he exercised a restraining influence without
in any way neglecting his duty as a police officer. His presence
and word alone frequently calmed excited diggers in a way that
commanded their respect and admiration. When the diggers broke
into rioting at Charters Towers, the tact, patience and courage
of Clohesy was of more use and value than a posse<a name=
"Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a> of police. Many a time I have
heard a witty remark, or a pithy Irish phrase from him, turn a
likely disturbance into a pleasant laughing meeting. Wherever he
controlled, he kept things in order without his hand being felt.
When he died about 1879, Queensland lost a good officer, and many
a northern pioneer a true friend.</p>
<p>When I reached Townsville I procured a load for Ravenswood
diggings, which had just been opened. I went to load my new
waggon at Clifton and Aplin's store, accompanied by a man named
Tom Hobbs, who was also loading at the same place, and for the
same destination. When I drove my team and new waggon from Sydney
through the streets toward the German Gardens&mdash;since the
war, Belgium Gardens&mdash;where we were camped, I noticed every
one laughing as I went by. After crossing the ridge where the
Anglican Cathedral now stands, I went around to the off side, and
there saw that some wag, while I was loading, had obliterated a
letter on the name of my waggon, which Fitzmaurice had christened
the "Townsville Lass." Striking the "L" out gave it a different
name. I quickly procured a paint brush and renewed the name as it
should be.</p>
<p>At that time the road to Ravenswood was lined with vehicles
and pedestrians, making their way to the new field. Cobb and Co.
were running a coach for mails and passengers, driven by Mick
Brady, who afterwards was well and favourably known on the very
bad road from Cooktown to Maytown. After making a quick trip we
returned, and loaded again for the Gilbert diggings.</p>
<p>In going up Thornton's Gap, on the coast range, I had the
misfortune to lose the top of my third finger on my right hand.
We had 36 bullocks on the waggon, and a faulty chain breaking,
only six bullocks were left to hold the waggon. The near side
ones being lazy, allowed the waggon to drift down towards the
steep descent of 500 feet to the bottom. I ran with a piece of
heavy log to prevent a smash, but the wheels caught the
log<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a> before I could release
my hand, and completely crushed the top of my finger until the
bone protruded. That night I had to lay with my finger in hot
water to relieve the pain. The next day I started at daylight for
Townsville, had the finger dressed by the doctor, and returned to
the teams the same day, having ridden a distance of 60 miles. I
was unable to yoke my team, but this my mate, Tom Hobbs, kindly
did for me. I was, however, able to drive the team the 350 miles
to the Gilbert. On returning from there, I had a bad attack of
fever and ague, which compelled me to ride on to Townsville for
medical advice, having various difficulties on the way down. I
left my black boy to assist my mate to bring down the two teams,
by hitching my waggon behind his, and yoking up sufficient
bullocks drafted from each team to draw them.</p>
<p>My mate, Tom Hobbs, was a "white man," which means a lot, but
rather backward as regards education. In leisure moments I would
assist him in reading, writing, etc. Before he left the Bay on
this trip, he had become engaged to a young lady in the town, and
enlisted my services to write his letters for him. I remember the
last I wrote before leaving him contained the
following:&mdash;</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>But if all goes well on my return,<br>
We'll give the Parson some trouble,<br>
To write the license for friends to learn<br>
We're converted from single to double.<br></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In a few weeks after reaching Townsville, under the doctor's
care, I regained my usual good health, and found Tom's fiancee
and delivered the messages which he had entrusted me with. The
wet season of 1871 had set in, and Tom was stuck at the Burdekin
River with the teams, so I concocted the following rhyme to send
him as if they came from his lady-love:&mdash;</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>Oh! Tom Hobbs, dear Tom, why don't you come back<br>
To redeem the dear promise you gave unto me,<br>
When you started with loading on the Gilberton track<br>
To hail your return as my husband to be.<br></div>
</div>
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a>
<div>
<div>Oh! the days and the hours how slowly they pass,<br>
And for me, I fear, there are plenty in store,<br>
Since now there's abundance of water and grass,<br>
To tempt you to spell your poor bullocks the more.<br></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>But, dear Tom, do write me a line to say<br>
That your love is as fervent as ever it's been.<br>
If so, on your return we'll both name the day<br>
Which kind friends will finish with tins kerosene.<br></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>I pray my dear hopes are not born to be blighted,<br>
By the tide of misfortune in earth's dreary life,<br>
For you know, dear Tom, you have charms which delighted<br>
A young girl to be your dear loving wife.<br></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>And now, dearest Tom, with a squeeze and a kiss<br>
That would burst the staves of a six gallon barrel.<br>
I pray God to grant you health and heavenly bliss<br>
When united for ever to your loving E. Carrol.<br></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When I last visited Townsville in 1917, I called on Mrs.
Hobbs, who showed me the original of the above, still in good
preservation.</p>
<p>Tom was a very shy man, and asked me if I could arrange for
his marriage to be held by the Registrar at the Court House on a
Sunday evening. This I did, the wedding party arriving at the
Court House by different routes to avoid publicity. The Registrar
had only a candle, which did not give sufficient light, so he
asked if I could obtain a lamp. I went down the hill to Evans',
afterwards Enright's, Tattersall Hotel, and borrowed a lamp
ostensibly to look for lost jewellery for a lady. Several
loungers, doubting the reason given, followed me, with the result
that at midnight Tom's house was surrounded by uninvited guests,
and I had to hand out some bottles of brandy before they could be
induced to leave. We kept things up until daylight, when I rode
back to my camp at Mount Louisa, six miles away.</p>
<p>About this time the carriers were challenged by the Townsville
cricket club to a match, to be played on a ground prepared at the
German Gardens. A carrier named Billy Yates took his <a name=
"Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a>waggon, decorated with boughs and
bush flowers, drawn by bullocks, to bring out the town team. The
principal bowler for Townsville was L. F. Sachs, of the A.J.S.
Bank. Ours were Charlie and Fred Hannaford. After a hard-fought
game of two innings each, the carriers won, I having the honour
of being top scorer. The particulars did not go into print, so I
am unable to give the details, although I remember the happenings
connected with and after the match were interesting.</p>
<p>I was loaded at Mount Louisa on my way to Ravenswood, when,
during the night a man wakened me, and asked if I could give him
a drink. I gave him a nip of rum from the jar. Shortly afterwards
I noticed the smell of burning, and on looking round saw a dray
with a load of wool well alight. I immediately raised the alarm,
and the men from several other teams who were camped there ran
over, but all that we could save were the bullock yokes. We then
tipped the dray up, thinking the ropes had been burnt through,
and that the bales of wool would roll off, when we could deal
with them. This was not the case, and the wind getting underneath
so fanned the flame that soon the wool was burning as fiercely as
the wood. The police investigated the matter, and found that the
man I gave the drink to had travelled down with this team, and
had a grievance about the payment of his wages. The Police
Magistrate committed him to the Supreme Court for trial for
arson. I was subpoenaed as principal witness, and had to ride
back some 70 miles to give evidence. The jury found the man
guilty, and he was sentenced to two years' hard labour. As he was
leaving the Court, in passing me, he said, "You have only two
years to live," but in this he did not prove a true prophet.</p>
<p>About this time I first made the acquaintance of the gentleman
now known as Sir Robert Philp. He has a reputation throughout
this country, to which, if I attempted to add anything would be
simply gilding refined gold. But in 1870 the name of Bob Philp,
accountant for James Burns, was throughout North Queensland a
synonym for business ability, integrity<a name="Page_46" id=
"Page_46">[46]</a> of character, and kindness of heart. This
reputation has not been dimmed by the passing of years. It is
something of a pleasure to know Sir Robt. Philp, but it is a
matter of pride to have known Mr. Philp "Lang Syne," when men of
ability, character, and generosity were not rare or difficult to
find.</p>
<p>I have alluded several times to "partners," or "mates," which
was the more popular term. These partnerships were quite common
amongst carriers and diggers in bygone days. It was simply chums,
owning and sharing everything in common, and without any
agreement, written or otherwise. There were many such
partnerships involving large sums of money and valuable property
which existed only on a complete trust in mates.</p>
<p>Among others on the Gilbert and Etheridge, were the mateship
of Steel, Hunt and O'Brien. There were several such partnerships
on the Palmer, notably that of Duff, Edwards and Callaghan. Of
the high characters and generosity of all these men many
interesting stories could be told. I doubt if their prototypes
now exist. In my own case, in carrying and in business, I carried
on with partners for many years without any agreement. The
partnerships were based on mutual trust. When it was felt between
the partners for some reason or other&mdash;generally a mere
liking for a change&mdash;that the partnership might end, a
friendly squaring-up would take place; each would go his own way
and probably enter into partnership with some other party. With
the exception of the partner I had in a claim on the Cape
goldfield, I found all my mates or partners to be men in every
sense of the term.</p>
<p>I had a very good black boy, a little fellow of about 10 years
of age, a native of Cooper's Creek, whom I called Billy. On one
of my trips to the Gilbert, when passing Dalrymple, Billy Marks,
the store and hotel-keeper, presented me with a well-bred cattle
pup and a gin case to put him in. This I placed on top of the
load. We had six miles to go over very rough basalt country
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a>to our camp. That day I
had yoked a steer for the first time, and I intended to hobble
him at night. When we reached camp I told Billy to bring up a
quiet bullock called Darling, and this I coupled to the steer,
instructing the boy to hold the whip-stick in front of the steer
to attract his attention whilst I hobbled him. I had just put the
hobble on the off leg, and was preparing to put it on the other,
when the steer gave a tremendous jump, and the old bullock
knocked me on my back on the yokes lying on the ground. When I
rose I looked at the boy to see if he was laughing, but he was
quite demure. I then saw the pup on the ground. He had caused my
discomfiture by jumping on the steer's back, the box having
broken open coming over the stones. When I returned from putting
the bullocks on the grass, I saw my mate laughing, and to my
inquiry he replied: "When you left with the bullocks I inquired
from the boy what the trouble was?" The boy said, "Puppy been
jump down on the steer's back, and old Darling been throw 'em a
good way." My mate said, "You been laugh?" The boy answered,
"Baal! me only been laugh alonga inside." He thought I might have
beaten him if I had detected a smile on his face. While I was
camped just outside Dalrymple, I one day told the boy if anyone
wanted me, to say I was in the township. I had just finished a
game of billiards at the hotel, when a man entered laughing. He
called me on one side, and said he had asked my boy where I was.
He said "That fella along public house playing&mdash;he got 'em
spear in his hand, and knock about things all a same like it duck
egg." He added the boy had followed me and watched my
actions.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></p>
<p>I continued carrying to Ravenswood, Charters Towers, the
Gilbert and Etheridge goldfields until October, 1872, when I
loaded for the latter place, delivering my load towards the end
of the year, and just as the wet season set in. My travelling
mate at this time was Billy Wilson, and he, wishing to return to
port, left me in charge of his team. I camped on the Delaney
River, and as there was abundance of grass, the bullocks gave no
trouble. On Wilson's return, we decided to purchase two loads of
stores from Clifton and Aplin's branch store, to take to the
Palmer River rush which had just broken out, owing to William
Hann's report on his exploration through the Peninsula becoming
known.</p>
<p>William Hann was a first-class bushman, but it is quite
evident he was very much astray in one portion of the trip, which
led to the great gold discovery. On page 13 of his report,
referring to his following up the Normanby River, he stated he
crossed the divide between the Normanby and Endeavour Rivers, and
followed a gully for nine and a-half miles; ... when it became a
considerable creek which he called Oakey Creek, it being the
first place he saw the familiar oaks. Under date 21st September,
1872, he reports:&mdash;"Running this creek down in an easterly
direction, and being compelled to cross it several times until it
junctioned with a large river running north and south"; he adds
"this river was, of course, no other than the Endeavour, of which
so much has been said and heard from time to time." In this
assumption he was far out. Owing to the rough country, Oakey
Creek had to be crossed three times, and while being only one
creek its crossings were afterwards known as Big, Middle and
Little Oakey. The creek forms one<a name="Page_49" id=
"Page_49">[49]</a>of the heads of the Annan River, so named by
Dalrymple. This river coming from the south-east falls into the
sea some miles south of Mount Cook, which, with its spurs,
divides it from the estuary of the Endeavour. Although there was
a qualified surveyor in the party, it does not appear that he put
Hann right. I do not mention this with any other desire than to
show what difficulties our early explorers met with.</p>

<div>John Murtagh Macrossan</div>
<br>
<p>The manner in which Hann extricated his party from the
terrible rough country at the heads of the Bloomfield and
Daintree Rivers stamps him as a fine bushman, resourceful and
dauntless.</p>
<p>We had a very exciting trip passing Fossilbrook, Mount
Surprise, and Firth's Stations, crossing the Lynd, Tate, Walsh
and Mitchell Rivers. These were all running strong. When we
arrived at the Walsh, two horse teams had been camped there for a
fortnight, and the owners told us the river was uncrossable.
After putting the bullocks on grass, my mate (who was a splendid
bushman), rode into the river. The water being clear, he was able
to zig-zag a sand bank, avoiding deep water, and found we could
get the waggons across by putting the goods on the guard rails.
This we did that night unknown to the owners of the other teams
who were camped farther on, but out of sight. In the morning we
yoked up, and passed them, stating we were going to attempt
crossing. This they declared was impossible, but came down to see
us make the attempt. We only had our shirts on, and rode our
horses bare-back. We made the crossing successfully, and camped
on the northern bank. The river came down again that night, and
delayed the horse teams another week. When we reached the
Mitchell River, we found there were forty teams of all sorts and
sizes waiting to cross. The next day my mate said that the river
was fordable, and he would cross. We led the way, followed by the
others. Quite a little village of people of both sexes camped
that night on the north side of the Mitchell. Our troubles were
now over, and we had thirty miles of easy travelling, past Mount
Mulgrave to the Palmer River.</p>
<p><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a>There was such a
quantity of stores arriving at the one time that we could not
dispose of ours, so it was arranged that Wilson should take his
team to Cooktown, and purchase a load jointly for us, and that I
should remain, put up a tarpaulin store for the goods, and
dispose of them as opportunity offered. To do this I decided to
sell my bullock team and horses, as I did not know how long I
should remain.</p>
<p>In the meantime, another diggings called Purdie's Camp broke
out forty miles up the river, so I purchased some more stores and
engaged a horse team to carry all the goods there at &pound;40
per ton. The only grass on the road was that known as
"turpentine." This the horses would not eat, consequently we had
to feed them on flour and water. On arrival, I disposed of
everything at high prices. Thus flour, 200lb. bag for &pound;20,
and other things at like values.</p>
<p>When at Purdie's camp, a packer&mdash;that is, a carrier using
pack horses&mdash;came in with his horses, one of which had
thrown his shoe. This rendered the horse useless to travel over
the stony ridges. The packer wanted horse-shoe nails, so, as a
joke, a carrier named Billy Yates offered to let him have five
horse-shoe nails for their weight in gold. The offer was
accepted, and I saw the nails put in one scale and the gold in
the other. The packer was receiving one shilling per pound for
packing goods eleven miles, and on that day's trip the horse took
150lbs., thus giving him &pound;7/10/-, less the price for the
nails. I forget the value of the gold paid for the latter.</p>
<p>I was one day in a store kept by a man named T. Q. Jones,
locally known as "Three Two," when a digger came in to buy a
needle. He demurred at the price asked, one shilling, when the
storekeeper remarked, "Good God, man, look at the price of
carriage."</p>
<p>Query&mdash;at 1/- per needle, what would a ton cost?</p>
<p>I had only my gold bag&mdash;which was fairly bulky&mdash;and
my black boy, and having again met my old acquaintance <a name=
"Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a>Fitzmaurice, from Peak Downs, who
had also sold his loading and had sent his teams down to
Cooktown, we decided to walk the forty miles back to the Lower
Palmer, carrying the gold in our blankets, which we slung over
our shoulders. When we reached the township, which was then
unnamed, we heard that the cost of carriage from Cooktown had
risen to &pound;130 per ton of 2,000lbs. for 165 miles. I learnt
that there were some teams camped at the Mitchell River, and
having borrowed a horse from a friendly teamster, rode out to try
and make a deal for one or more teams. I succeeded in buying 24
bullocks and two old drays, with three horses, for &pound;400,
agreeing to take the carrier and his wife to Cooktown, and paid a
deposit. The owner had not heard of the high prices ruling for
loading. When we reached the township and he learnt this, he
offered me &pound;50 on my bargain to repurchase the teams, but I
refused the offer. I then bought a new waggon for &pound;60, and
sold the two old drays to the blacksmith for &pound;20. This
enabled me to have one very strong team.</p>
<p>I found out afterwards that this was necessary, as the road
was very heavy, notably fourteen miles of sand, known as the
"Welcome Water-hole Sand," in which the wheels were buried to the
axle.</p>
<p>Billy Wilson, my partner, arrived with our joint loading at
Palmerville just as I arrived with my newly-bought team, and not
liking the idea of remaining as a storekeeper, I preferred to
accompany him on his return to Cooktown. We decided to sell our
joint load at a price which netted us &pound;70 per ton for
carriage.</p>
<p>Before I reached Cooktown I met a storekeeper from that town
who engaged me to take four tons of goods to what is now called
Palmerville, at &pound;120 per ton. This price enabled me to
engage a Chinese cook, so that I could devote all my attention to
looking after the bullocks.</p>
<p>After delivering my &pound;120 loading, I made all haste on my
return and succeeded in obtaining another load of four and a-half
tons at &pound;100 per ton.</p>
<p><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a>Cooktown at this time
(towards the end of 1873), was composed wholly of tents. Diggers,
who had been more or less successful, were arriving on their way
to "the Bay" (Townsville), or farther south.</p>
<p>I think that the Palmer was the last real alluvial gold rush
in Australia, and the class of men who followed such rushes in
the search for gold is now extinct. Imagine to oneself the "lucky
digger" in cord pants, top boots, red shirt, and sash with
fringes hanging down, the whole topped by a wide-rimmed felt hat,
and we have a man who may be seen in present-day picture shows.
There were some doubtful characters among the diggers, but they
were as a general rule a fine stamp of men, slow to form
friendship, but this once made, was loyally given and maintained
when fortune smiled, and not withheld when she frowned, on one or
other. The digger of the past was not often known to desert or
turn down the man or woman to whom he once gave his friendship.
Some were highly connected in other countries, some had been
"'Varsity men." I once assisted to bury the remains of one whose
real name could never be learnt. From the clothes found in his
camp, it could be seen that they originally had been marked, but
the name had been cut out from each article. I found two volumes
from which the names had also been cut out; these were
"Sheridan's Works" and "Cicero's Works" in Latin. Many passages
in the books were well marked with marginal notes in pencil, and
both showed signs of being well studied.</p>
<p>Carriage was invariably paid in gold at the standard of
&pound;3/15/- per ounce. On sending the gold to the Sydney mint
through the banks it realised &pound;4/7/6 per ounce, which, at
the time, was considered to be a record price. The bank and
shipping charges, and insurance, etc., amounted to 7/6 per ounce,
so that we had a clear profit of 5/- per ounce on the gold by
sending the gold to Sydney instead of paying it into the
banks.</p>
<p><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a>At Palmerville I met,
for the first time, Dr. Jack Hamilton, afterwards M.L.A. and whip
for the National Party in the Parliament of 1888. Among the
Palmer diggers Hamilton was extremely popular because of his
prowess as an athlete, and his medical ability, which was given
gratuitously to all. He was said to have been concerned in some
of the many South American revolutions, but although we were
friendly from this time until his death, he never alluded to such
an occurrence. I realised, however, that he was very reticent as
to his early life, and the gossip may have had some
foundation.</p>
<p>I delivered my load just as the wet season set in, so made my
camp six miles down the river from Palmerville. My black boy
caught a cold, which, in spite of the medicines I gave him,
developed into pneumonia. He was very weak, and as he refused to
accept food from anyone but myself, I was a prisoner in camp. One
evening he called me over, and made a confession of what he said
were lies he had told me at different times. Once when I had sent
him to muster some of my horses on the Annan River, near
Cooktown, he had returned saying he could not find them. He now
told me that when he had reached the river, he saw a lot of
<a name="myall" id="myall">Myall</a> black fellows, which so
frightened him that he gave up looking for the horses, and camped
until sun-down, thus leading me to think he had been looking for
them all day. Several other little instances that I had quite
forgotten, he told me were lies. In the morning he was dead. I
buried him, and put a wooden cross over the grave. He was a
splendid little fellow, and I missed him greatly.</p>
<p>On returning to Cooktown in 1874, I offered to make an
agreement with a Chinese storekeeper to carry for him for twelve
months at the rate of &pound;50 per ton. After consulting Joss,
he agreed, and I thus had constant employment at a lucrative
price.</p>
<p>The Chinese storekeepers had sent to China to import a number
of coolies to pack their merchandise from Cooktown to the
Palmer.</p>
<p><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a>The Government had just
completed wharves and sheds at the landing, and rented these to
Mr. F. W. J. Beardmore, stock and station agent there.</p>
<p>This gentleman hearing that a steamer from the north was about
to arrive conveying 400 Chinamen, came out to the four-mile,
where a number of carriers were camped, to ask if we would assist
him at the wharf, as he intended to levy a poll tax of one
shilling per head on each Chinaman who landed, and to bring ropes
with us. After a consultation, we decided to help him, as these
coolies were competing with our trade. Before the ship arrived,
we had stretched our ropes across the exit, and marshalled our
forces to prevent any leaving the wharf without paying the tax. A
stormy scene then ensued, as the coolies strongly objected to the
imposition, ending by the swag of each man being confiscated and
placed in the shed until payment was made. In carrying this out,
we were ably assisted by the sailors and sympathetic civilians.
Several of the Chinese attempted to escape, but were caught by
their pig-tails and brought back. After a controversy between Mr.
Beardmore and the Chinese storekeepers, the latter paid
&pound;20, the sum demanded for the release of the swags. The
Chinese had no sympathisers to assist them in obtaining
redress.</p>
<p>The Chinese storekeepers generally packed their goods by their
own countrymen, who carried them in baskets hung on bamboo sticks
slung across their shoulders. The Chinese packers, through fear
of the blacks, invariably travelled in numbers and in single
file. Many a time they would draw down anathema of carriers by
parading on the off-side of the bullocks, which were being yoked
up, dangling their tins in an offensive manner to the animals,
which often resulted in the drivers hunting them away with their
bullock whips. As a further protection against the blacks, the
Chinese kept up a loud conversation, which, if not understood,
might be heard some time before they were met.</p>
<p><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a>On their return from
the diggings these packers were believed to carry back gold in
payment for goods. In a similar way it was thought that gold was
largely transferred to China.</p>
<p>The value of gold known to have been obtained from the Palmer,
is estimated at about six millions sterling. If there was such a
secret export by Chinese, the value would probably be very much
more.</p>
<p>Shortly after making my first trip from Cooktown, I met Dr. O.
Quinn, the then Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane, who was
visiting the Palmer, and who with much glee told me he had just
come safely through the "Gates of Hell." This was a short cut
from the original track from Cooktown, and was opened up by
Inspector Douglas to avoid the many crossings of the Palmer
during the wet seasons, but was abandoned owing to the hostility
of the blacks. Many a digger and several packers were murdered on
this route and their remains eaten by the blacks of this
locality. It is a sort of long passage, or cut through the rocks,
just about wide enough for a pack horse to pass through easily.
Overhead large boulders here and there are lying across the
passage.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></p>
<p>Owing to depredations and murders committed by the blacks
between Cooktown and the Palmer, it was found advisable for teams
and packers to travel in numbers for mutual protection. On the
trip to Palmerville, I travelled in company with nine other
teams, and after crossing the Normanby River we camped on the
bank. Our bullocks strayed some miles down the river, and on
mustering them in the morning we found the trend of the river was
towards the Deighton, one of its tributaries, and in the
direction of where the old road crossed it. A party was formed,
of which I was one, to ascertain if it was possible to reach the
Deighton without going through the "Welcome Water-hole Sand." We
found good, firm country which made it practicable. On returning,
we rode our horses single file, thus making a good pad for the
bullocks to follow. Our first night out we camped between two
lagoons. A mate and I went out to get some ducks or geese, which
swarmed on the lagoons. We had previously noticed that the
blacks' tracks had formed beaten pads, like sheeps' tracks, round
the lagoons.</p>
<p>We crossed a soakage running through sand; there were dense
patches of scrub near the lagoons, and I had an impression that
it was not safe to go farther on foot, and said I would go back.
My mate at first demurred, but eventually yielded. When we came
back to the wet sand we saw blacks' tracks over our boot prints.
It was evident we had been followed, and had we not returned
would most certainly have been speared in some convenient place.
That night dogs were barking incessantly. My waggon being on the
outside, I let the tarpaulin down and <a name="Page_57" id=
"Page_57">[57]</a>slept on the ground instead of on the bunk,
rigged up between the spokes of the hind wheels&mdash;there was
less likelihood of a spear catching me there.</p>
<p>After crossing the Deighton we met some empty teams coming
down, and told them of the new road we had opened up. The
carriers said they would go that way. We cautioned them to be
careful of the blacks, as there were numbers of them in the
vicinity. Some time after the carriers told us they found that
the blacks had covered the road with bushes, sticks and small
trees to screen their hunting grounds. They also said they had
met a German, his wife and little girl, at the turn-off on the
Normanby, and advised them not to go on the new track as the
blacks were bad, and they had no firearms. However, the German,
whose name was Johan Strau, persisted, saying he was not afraid
of blacks, as he had been used to them.</p>
<p>On arriving on the Palmer, we met two carriers who were riding
down with their gold. We told them also of the new road we had
opened up, and they decided to ride that way.</p>
<p>We also advised them to be careful as the blacks were numerous
near the lagoons, which they would pass. They said they had a
revolver, but only three cartridges, which they deemed sufficient
for protection, as they were riding.</p>
<p>Later these carriers had reported to the police, that on
reaching the open space around the lagoons I have mentioned, they
saw a large number of natives, and thinking mischief had been
done, they discharged the revolver amongst the blacks, who
decamped. When the carriers reached the abandoned spot they found
Strau's body beneath the dray. The dead body of his wife was a
little distance away. A spear had been driven through her mouth,
and had pinned her to the ground. Both bodies were warm. Three
horses were lying dead, but there was no sign of the little
girl.</p>
<p><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a>The carriers
immediately galloped on to the fifteen-mile bend of the Normanby
River, where a number of teams and packers were camped. In the
morning a well-armed search party was formed. On arrival at the
scene of the murders, scouts were posted to give notice if the
blacks were returning. A grave was dug, and the bodies lowered
into it. While this was being carried out noises were heard in
the scrub. The party proceeded in the direction of the sound and
found the little girl, a large gash across the forehead, her
stomach ripped up by the blacks' wooden knives, and her eyes
picked out by crows. The body was brought in, and buried with the
father and mother. Flour, sugar, tea, gunpowder, etc., etc., were
heaped up on the ground, but there was no sign of the dray.
Inspector Douglas, in charge of the native police, was informed.
His detachment followed the murderers across the Normanby River,
where they overtook and dispersed them. Portions of the dray,
stripped of all the iron work, were also found.</p>
<p>The police learnt, through the troopers from some blacks who
were captured, that Strau's party was camped for dinner when the
blacks attacked them. The man was speared while reading a book
beneath the dray, and the woman was sewing, sitting against the
wheel of the dray. Before being killed outright, the woman was
subjected to horrible outrage by the blacks. It was intended to
keep the little girl, but two old gins quarrelled over her
possession, and it was decided to kill the child, and so avoid
dissension among the tribe. From these murders the lagoons were
known as the "Murdering Lagoons."</p>
<p>On my way back to Cooktown I camped near the grave. That night
I laid down in the centre of the bullocks when they camped after
feeding, holding my loaded rifle and horse by the bridle.
Bullocks are very sensitive to the smell of wild blacks, and will
almost certainly stampede should any be about. Camping among the
bullocks is considered the safest place one can find.</p>
<p><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a>Some time later, while
at this camp, I was mustering my bullocks on the plain between
the scrubs, when they stampeded. I looked, I could see nothing,
but I knew that blacks must be the cause. On returning to the
waggons, I was informed that three troopers, who had run away
from Cape York, had been to the camp. They had no clothes, but
rusty rifles, and had fought their way through the wild tribes of
the Peninsula. My bullock bells were the first sign of
civilisation they had met for three months.</p>
<p>Mr. William Hann had just arrived at Palmerville with a mob of
fat bullocks from his Maryvale Station. I purchased 13 steers
from him at &pound;16 per head. The cattle were very quiet after
their long droving, and as I was returning to Cooktown with my
empty waggon, I was enabled to break them in. At that place I
bought another waggon, and with spare bullocks from my first
team, I was able to put two full teams on the road.</p>
<p>Sub-Inspector O'Connor's camp was at the Laura River. On one
occasion, when dispersing some blacks, the troopers, who were all
Fraser Island natives, saw the shiny, black skin of an aboriginal
hiding in the bush some distance away. They fired, and a little
fellow about six years of age got up and ran towards them. The
troopers picked him up, and he became a favourite with them. They
delighted in instructing him in drill and discipline, and he
proved an apt pupil. O'Connor and myself became great friends,
and many a happy hour I've spent at his barracks when passing to
and fro to the Palmer. Knowing I had no <a name="blackboy" id=
"blackboy">black boy,</a> he gave me the little fellow he had so
well drilled. I bought a pony for him to ride, and it was
laughable to see him, if we happened to meet the troopers on the
road, straighten himself up and salute the officer.</p>
<p>O'Connor told me an amusing incident which occurred at
Government House in Sydney, when his cousin, Sir Hercules
Robinson, was Governor. Invitations had been issued for a
reception, at which Captain St. John, the aide-de-camp,
called<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a> out the names of
the guests as they arrived. Presently, he called out "Mr. Smith!"
In response, one of those present walked towards the Governor,
saying, "I don't think your two-year-old filly will win the
Stakes this year," and went on talking racing matters. The
captain relieved the situation by informing him that there were
refreshments in the other room. When all the guests were
assembled, Sir Henry Parkes, the then Premier, asked Captain St.
John, how that man, pointing to Mr. Smith, came to be there, and
said, "Do you know that he is one of the greatest scamps in
Sydney," and added, "For God's sake get him out of here, or
there'll be a scene." Captain St. John said he only knew that his
name was Smith, but acting on Sir Henry's advice, he approached
him, stating that he had by mistake received the invitation
intended for another Mr. Smith. The man retaliated by saying in a
loud voice, "Oh, ah, very well; I've had two whiskeys and a soda,
which comes to eighteen-pence. Here is half-a-crown; you may keep
the change yourself."</p>
<p>In 1875, I loaded my two teams for a new diggings which had
broken out about 40 miles S.W. of Cooktown. The township had been
called Byerstown, after Johnny Byers, who had established a
business there. Mr. Byers, many years after was appointed
Government Land Agent at Hughenden, and subsequently Land
Commissioner there. He is now stock and station agent, doing good
business in that town.</p>
<p>Finding carrying paid well, I purchased another waggon, and by
breaking in more steers, established my third team. These I now
loaded for Edwardstown. This was the popular name for the main
township, about 40 miles up the Palmer River from Palmerville. It
was officially known as Maytown, but the diggers would not
recognise the latter name. To reach this place we had some very
rough country to negotiate by a new road opened from the Laura,
over what was called the Conglomerate. Although not as good as
the road <i>via</i> Palmerville, it was much shorter. On
returning to Cooktown<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a> I
loaded my three teams for Blacksoil, where there was a store kept
by Sam Burns, who, I understand, is still in that locality.</p>
<p>The wet season set in much earlier this year, and caught us in
the flooded country beyond the Normanby River, but by double
banking the teams, and working in the rain, we reached an anthill
flat which was so boggy that it was impossible to cross unless we
made a sound road. We had passed two teams camped, but as I was
within 15 miles of my destination, I determined to push on. My
drivers and I cut down saplings, and made a corduroy, across
which we sledged the twelve tons of loading. This was rather
risky, as we had a quantity of dynamite on, the explosive caps of
which were inserted in 50lb. bags of flour. During our work,
which took three days to complete, the other teamsters would
frequently ride past and say, "That's right, boys, make a good
road for us," but did not offer to help. This riled me and my
men.</p>
<p>Sub-Inspector O'Connor, knowing we were close, rode over with
his troopers to give us a hand. When we had got the last of the
waggons through, and put the loads on again, it was quite dark.
After supper I said it would serve the other fellows right if we
took up the saplings and burnt them. The idea caught on with the
men, and by the aid of the troopers, we took up every stick and,
with some trouble, made a huge bonfire of them. As they were
saturated with water it was difficult setting them alight, and
the rain continued the whole time. However, by about midnight we
completed our job, tired out, wet through, and no dry blankets to
sleep in. Next morning, we were yoking to move on when the owner
of the other teams came up and threatened us with revenge for
burning the timber. When he saw O'Connor and his troopers he
calmed down, and returned to his teams, regretting he had not
assisted us. He now had to do as we had done, but with all the
saplings which had been in close proximity cut down. The next day
we reached our destination, and formed a good camp at the
Blacksoil to enjoy our Christmas dinner and a well-earned
rest.</p>
<p><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a>I now began to feel a
tinge of rheumatism in my arms through wearing wet clothing
continuously. About the new year one of my saddle horses came
into the camp with a portion of a spear stuck in his rump. We
threw him and cut out the barbed head of the spear, but the wound
afterwards remained a running sore. I caught the camp horse,
which we always kept hobbled, and started in search of the
others. In following the tracks, I found where the blacks had
rounded them up&mdash;killing two, one my favourite
hack&mdash;and had taken away the meat for consumption.</p>
<p>After mustering the others, I reported the matter to O'Connor,
who had just received the information of the murder of two
packers, and was preparing for a long patrol. Six troopers,
O'Connor and myself, started&mdash;all being fully armed. I took
them to where the blacks had killed two horses; the boys then
followed the track by instinct, as I thought. The rain had washed
out all signs to me. When crossing a high ridge, so bare and hard
that our horses left no tracks, two of the trackers were riding
ahead, the others driving the pack horses behind. I said to
O'Connor, "I don't believe they are on the tracks." "Well," he
said, "I can't see any, I will call them back." He called out
"Sambo!" which was the name of the Corporal, "Where track?" Sambo
pointed to a blade of spinifex. I asked "Where?" He answered,
"There." So I got off my horse, and there was a tiny speck of
blood which had dropped on the root, and had not been washed off
by the rain. It turned out the Myalls had been carrying the flesh
of my horses, and the blood had dropped here and there.</p>
<p>We came to where the blacks had had a great feast on the bank
of the Kennedy River. At this spot it was rather wide, with a
sandy bed, the water running over it about two feet deep. I found
the shoes, tail, and mane of my favourite horse on the bank. We
held a consultation, and it was decided to send two of the boys
with the pack horses back some distance from the river, and then
to travel parallel with it, as the<a name="Page_63" id=
"Page_63">[63]</a> country close to this river was very broken.
The rest of the party were to follow the river down towards
Princess Charlotte's Bay. We had a boy out on each side to see if
the Myalls had left the river bed. They knew we could not track
them in the water. We followed the river down for two days, and I
shall not forget the torture of walking bare-footed on coarse
sand with water running over it. I tried walking in the water
with my boots on, but the sand came into my boots and made my
feet quite sore. O'Connor was in the same plight as myself.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the third day, the boys saw smoke rising
about a mile ahead. We immediately left the river and put up our
tents for a camp, short hobbling the horses with no bells on, but
could not boil the billy, as smoke from the fire would be seen.
The moon rose about midnight, and as the rain had ceased, we
decided to start about 2 a.m., leaving our horses and belongings
in camp.</p>
<p>It was a rather weird procession as we made our way along the
river. Five naked black troopers in single file in the lead,
their only dress a cartridge belt round the waist and cap on
head. They were most particular in wearing it when going into
action, otherwise there would be difficulty in recognising them
or each other. O'Connor, myself and the corporal brought up the
rear.</p>
<p>After travelling some distance through grass, which in places
was over our heads, we heard a peculiar chuckle on an island in
the bed of the river. It was decided to send the five boys round
to the other side, whilst we, O'Connor, Sambo, and myself
remained, and waited. Towards daylight we heard shots apparently
about a mile down the river, and ran in their direction. We had
not gone far when a big black fellow sprang up from the river,
disappearing in the long grass before I could bring my rifle to
the shoulder. I then heard a shot behind me. We afterwards found
the Myall dead, and eventually reached the place where the blacks
had camped. The boys had previously dispersed most of them. If at
any time I felt a<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a>
compunction in using my rifle I lost it when I thought of the
murders of Strau, his wife and daughter, and the outrages
committed upon them, and again of the murder, and eating, of two
packers a short time before.</p>
<p>We burnt all the blacks' weapons and several dilly bags
containing the dead bodies of infants which they carried about
with them. The stench of burning human flesh was sickening.</p>
<p>I went with one of the troopers down the river, where the soil
at the roots of a large gum tree had been hollowed out by the
water. Underneath it resembled a huge cave. Without saying
anything to me, the trooper fired two shots into the cave. I then
asked, "What are you firing at?" He replied, "Two fella sit down
there." After which he hauled out the dead bodies of two
blackfellows.</p>
<p>On our way back we met the troopers from the Palmer, who were
also out for the same tribe. The Palmer police went on down the
river, and we returned to the Laura Camp quite tired out. The
troopers told us the reason they did not stop at the island on
their way down was because it contained only a mob of old gins,
who had knocked up the previous evening, and could not make the
camp.</p>
<p>When preparing to return to Cooktown, O'Connor prevailed upon
me to wait at the police camp while he and the troopers patrolled
the road past Murdering Lagoon. On his return, he told me the
blacks had been there during the wet season, and had dug up Johan
Strau's grave, and carried off the bodies. When I arrived at the
place with the teams, I saw the stains made by the chest of tea
the blacks had pillaged off the dray on the day of the
murder.</p>
<p>Sub-Inspector O'Connor was a cultured Irish gentleman. Being
possessed of a private income, he would provide money prizes for
shooting amongst his troopers, and despite being only possessed
of the old Snider rifle, they quickly developed into good shots.
Probably this and their known capabilities in<a name="Page_65"
id="Page_65">[65]</a> tracking induced the Victorian authorities
to requisition their services to track the noted Kelly Gang
bushrangers in 1878. Mr. O'Connor and his boys, with Constable
King, from Maryborough, were at Glenrowan when Ned Kelly was
taken prisoner, and the remainder of the gang burnt in the public
house.</p>

<br>
<p>On reaching Cooktown I again loaded my three teams for
Maytown, returning to Palmerville empty, where I sold one of my
teams. On the trip my rheumatism became so bad that I determined
to take a trip to Sydney, leaving my teams to camp during the wet
season now commencing, in charge of one driver and the black
boy.</p>
<p>I left Cooktown in the E. and A. Company's s.s. "Singapore" in
December, 1875. On board I made the acquaintance of Captain
Pennefather, lately Comptroller of Prisons, who, at that time,
had a fleet of boats at Thursday Island, engaged in pearl
fishing. On arrival at Townsville, John Dean (late M.L.C.), came
aboard, and we renewed an acquaintance formed some years before
when he was butchering at Townsville, and where I had purchased
steers from him.</p>
<p>It was my first trip on the coast, and with fine weather, I
was delighted with the beautiful scenery. Owing to the early
rains the numerous islands were clad in their richest verdure,
especially did the Whitsunday Passage appeal to me. Most of the
islands in the passage were inhabited by aboriginals, who made a
practice of coming out in their canoes to the steamers, picking
up food, etc., thrown to them from the ship. One of our crew
threw out a loaf of bread, which was attached to a piece of rope.
A blackfellow and his gin in a canoe close by the ship caught the
loaf, but the moving of our boat tightened the line, which pulled
him out, his canoe being capsized, and he and his gin were
struggling in the water. However, as they were good swimmers,
they soon righted their canoe with the loss only of the loaf of
bread. During the <a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a>trip
lunch was spread daily under the awning on the top deck. This was
much more pleasant than down in the stuffy cabin. After leaving
Moreton Bay the sea became rough. A water spout formed not far
from the ship, and it appeared large enough to swamp us had we
been under it. The wind made it hard to light matches for a
smoke, so Captain Pennefather introduced his flint and steel, and
lit a stick composed of dry buffalo manure; this we found very
useful with which to light our pipes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></p>
<p>We arrived at Sydney on a Friday night early in January, 1876.
John Dean required a rig out, and being a man of 21 stone weight
could not buy a ready-made shirt, so had to be measured. We
stayed at the Occidental Hotel, in Wynyard Square, and hearing
that "Our Boys" was being played at the Theatre Royal, took seats
in the orchestra stalls, which consisted of wooden spring seats.
We arrived when all was quiet and the play in progress. As John
sat down every screw came out of the seat, and he plumped on the
floor to the amusement of the audience. The fun was greater when
he was seen slowly, but successfully, to lower himself into
another seat.</p>
<p>After the performance, thinking we had sufficient bump of
locality to find our hotel without inquiry, we walked, and
continued walking until we found ourselves down at the wharves,
which, we had been told, was an undesirable quarter at any time,
but especially late at night. From a passer-by, we learnt that
the hotel was a long distance off. After receiving instructions,
we reached our lodging just as the bar was being closed at
midnight. Dean suggested a drink, which we ordered at a side
window, and asked the barmaid to bring the liquor into an
adjoining room. A man calling himself Count Bismarck, and who was
greatly excited about something, was in the bar. He said to Dean,
"Aren't you going to shout for me." Dean replied, "No," at which
the Count remarked, "Oh, never mind, I have plenty of money."
Dean replied, "You must be a mean blooming beggar, then, to ask
me to shout." Dean and I sat at a small table discussing the
play, when a revolver shot rang out and something seemed to
strike us. We immediately rushed for a green baize door, but saw
no one. On returning <a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a>to
the room, the barmaid, who was quite pale, asked "Are you dead?"
I answered, "No." At the moment I did not realise the absurdity
of the question, or that the answer was unnecessary.</p>
<p>We failed to find the German, who had disappeared. Mr. Yeo,
the landlord, ran in to inquire what the trouble was. When we
returned to the room I found a bullet under the chair I was
sitting on. It had struck the ceiling, and brought down the
plaster. Later, in Melbourne, John Dean heard that Count Bismarck
had been sentenced to two years' imprisonment for shooting a
man.</p>
<p>After a very pleasant time in Sydney, I found the rheumatism
had left me, so I deemed it desirable to return north, and to
work. On my arrival in Townsville I found the wet season was not
yet over. Many friends prevailed upon me to stay back in
Townsville, where I put in a most enjoyable fortnight with some
of my old pals.</p>
<p>At the end of the fortnight, the s.s. "Banshee," a boat of
about 100 tons, was advertised to sail for Cooktown, <i>via</i>
the Hinchinbrook Channel. I booked my passage by her, and was
informed she would sail at 5 a.m. on a certain day.</p>
<p>I was staying at the Criterion Hotel, on the beach, where the
evening previous to my intended departure, I was given a
send-off, which lasted into well-advanced morning. Owing to this
I missed the boat.</p>
<p>A few hours afterwards it was blowing a cyclone. Spray came
over the hotel. It was thought the "Banshee" could not live
through the blow, and we were not surprised when we learnt very
quickly that she was wrecked about 3 p.m. the same afternoon. It
was ascertained later that, finding her engines were not powerful
enough to make headway against the wind, the captain tried to
weather a rocky point on Hinchinbrook Island, so that he might
beach her in a sandy<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a> bay
beyond. She failed to get around the point, and lifted by a wave
over the rocks, became fixed in a cleft, where she soon bumped a
hole in her hull. Such of her crew and passengers who were not
lucky enough to be thrown far inland were drowned, or crushed to
death. One passenger, named Burstall, crawled out on a boom, from
which the waves swept him high on to the rocks. A following wave
put him out of danger, but left him considerably bruised. Out of
thirty-seven on board, sixteen were saved, one a stowaway, who,
it was said, walked out of the hole made in the ship's hull by
the rocks.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards I returned to Cooktown by the s.s.
"Singapore," and saw what was left of the "Banshee" in the
distance. In February, 1877, the "Singapore" ran ashore on L.
Island, off Port Mackay, and became a total wreck.</p>
<p>I had left my riding horses in Cooktown, and a day or so after
my arrival, I went on to Palmerville to send my teams down to the
Port. Having done this, and started them two days ahead, Mrs.
Jackson, whom I have mentioned as having met some years
previously in the Peak Downs district, asked me to take 200
ounces of gold down to the bank. I agreed to do so, carrying it
in my valise on the saddle. I was very glad when I reached the
waggons to get rid of the gold, as it proved a very dead weight
on my legs.</p>
<p>During this wet season (1876), the Government had sent a boat
to the Laura River to carry travellers across. These were very
few. The boatman was very much alone, and I found that the blacks
had taken the opportunity of eating him. While driving the
leading team up the bank, I saw numbers of blacks' tracks all
around the boat. We drew up a short distance from the bank, and
after unyoking, I made my customary visit to water, with towel
and bucket, which latter was filled for the cook. The water in
the river was running in a channel on the opposite side, and when
I was close to it, I heard a chuckle such as the blacks make.
Looking towards the crossing I<a name="Page_70" id=
"Page_70">[70]</a> saw a mob of blacks bathing, and one running
towards the bank. Without a second look, I dropped the bucket,
and sprinting across the sand and up the bank to the waggons, I
called out, "Get the rifles ready! The blacks are at the
crossing." After waiting some little time we saw Sub-Inspector
Townsend and his black troopers riding towards us. He stayed for
dinner, and from mutual explanations I learnt it was his
troopers' tracks I had seen. They were returning from an
inspection down the river, and had camped at the crossing over
night. They decided to have a bogey before dinner, and the boy I
saw running, went to get his uniform cap to denote a trooper. Had
I taken a second look, I should have seen Mr. Townsend with them.
He laughingly described me racing, hidden with sand which my feet
were scooping up, in my haste to get the firearms.</p>
<p>Up to now, carrying had been so remunerative that one would
have seen one-time station managers, ex-inspectors of police, old
naval men, and all sorts and conditions of other men wielding the
bullock-whip and making good earnings, but as competition became
keener, carriage fell much lower and more difficult to obtain.
The goldfield was falling off, and more in the hands of the
Chinese. I had a very hard time to keep my three teams in
employment during the year.</p>
<p>In December, 1877, I again suffered severely from malaria, and
having previously sold one of my teams, I decided to make another
trip to Sydney, leaving the driver to bring down the two teams to
the Laura, and camp there until my return. The wet season was
setting in, consequently we could not procure any loading. I had
an uneventful trip down to Sydney, and again met with John Dean
at Mona House, in Wynyard Square.</p>
<p>I returned to Queensland about the beginning of March, 1878,
the malaria having left me.</p>
<p>Passing through Townsville, I met Fitzmaurice, who told me
that carrying had fallen away between Cooktown and the<a name=
"Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a> Palmer, and that he had left that
district. He suggested that I should join with him in carrying to
the western country, and added that he had been informed by a
squatter that there was a good opening for a store at the Conn
Waterhole, on the Diamantina River. This is about forty miles
down the Western River, from where Winton now is.</p>
<p>The suggestion appealed to me, and it was agreed that I should
go on to Cooktown, start my two teams overland to Townsville,
then return and drive one of his three teams on our western trip
without loss of time.</p>
<p>On my arrival in Cooktown, I went to the Laura, where the
teams were still camped. Everything was in order, and my bullocks
fat. I started them on their long trip overland to Townsville,
where Fitzmaurice and I had purchased sixteen tons of assorted
merchandise from Clifton and Aplin. Arriving in Townsville in a
few days by steamer, we loaded up for the far and, to most
Queenslanders, what was then unknown country.</p>
<p>Both Fitzmaurice and myself were well known to the firm
through our carrying for them from the Port to the several
diggings. They generously gave us the goods without our paying
any cash, and without giving even the scratch of a pen. When I
returned to Townsville at the end of 1879 to purchase more
supplies, I signed a promissory note for the cost of all the
goods at four months. Practically, Messrs. Clifton and Aplin
generously gave us the sixteen tons of goods on a credit which
extended over twelve months, and which were only paid for when
the note matured.</p>
<p>It was my fortune to have now met in Townsville a man who was
then bearing a high reputation in North Queensland, but who was
soon to become famous farther afield. By some reason I cannot
even now understand, the diggers very seldom put their confidence
or trust in the wrong man, and in John Murtagh Macrossan, they
found their idol. Mentally big, physically small, his eloquence,
ability and courage brought<a name="Page_72" id=
"Page_72">[72]</a> him, on their behalf, into conflict with
strong and powerful influences.</p>
<p>I met him later in the Parliament of 1888. In this were many
able men, but none, not even the great chiefs McIlwraith and
Griffith, could overshadow Macrossan.</p>
<p>In his private life, which was most exemplary, I found
Macrossan&mdash;although it was said he was otherwise&mdash;to be
most tolerant to all who might differ from him in social and
religious matters. Like most of his countrymen, he was, however,
in politics, a strong, bitter partisan. Once a question became
political, if one did not agree with Macrossan, he made an enemy.
Between him and McIlwraith a close, personal friendship existed
for years, but towards the end of Macrossan's life they became
estranged. This was due to the strong, independent stand
Macrossan took on a political matter which gave McIlwraith
offence.</p>
<p>In a conversation I had with McIlwraith just prior to his
leaving Queensland, as it turned out to be, for ever, he spoke
most feelingly of Macrossan's memory and their earlier
friendship.</p>
<p>Although Macrossan had many chances of enriching himself, he
died, in 1891, as he had lived, a man, poor in the world's goods,
but rich in the esteem and respect of all, not excepting those
who very widely, and strongly differed with him on political,
national, or religious matters.</p>
<p>Had he lived in latter years, I doubt if he would have become
a popular leader of what is generally designated as "The
People."</p>
<p>He was not an opportunist, and he could not submit his
independence of mind, character, or principles to any person or
junta.</p>
<p>His breach with Sir Thomas McIlwraith proved this.</p>
<p>If an impartial biography of John Macrossan should ever be
written, it will prove interesting and instructive reading.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></p>
<p>We started the teams from Townsville about the end of July,
1878, and passed a gang engaged on construction of the railway
line to Charters Towers at Double Barrel Creek, now known as
Toonpan, 17 miles from Townsville.</p>
<p>Our destination was Collingwood, more widely known as the Conn
Waterhole, where the Government Surveyor had laid out a township
situated about 40 miles west of Winton.</p>
<p>Having heard that the business men of Charters Towers were
offering a reward of &pound;50 to any carrier who would open a
more direct road to the western country, and that a road party
had left to mark the line, we decided to try and win it. On our
arrival at the Towers, we interviewed the merchants, who
disclaimed any knowledge of a reward having been offered for
opening the road. We decided to follow the road party, who had
marked a line to junction with the old Flinders road. On the
journey I found a tree on which I had cut my initials when
travelling to the Gulf with sheep, some twelve years before.
Owing to double banking the teams through the heavy sand
bordering "Billy Webb's Lake," we had to camp without water that
night. There was green picking on the water-less lake for the
bullocks, but they had to be watched. The road party had left an
empty cask where they had camped on the lake, and one of the
bullocks, a poly, smelling water in the bottom of the cask,
forced his head into it. On <a name="lfting" id=
"lfting">lifting</a> his head, the cask came with it. The
bullock, being unable to see, made for his mates with their bells
on, and then a general stampede of the bullocks took place in all
directions. Finally, a bell bullock made for the timber, the poly
followed him, and <a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a>running
against a tree, smashed the cask. Thus ended an amusing incident,
with no damage done except to the cask.</p>
<p>The road party left the old road and made a ploughed furrow
across the downs to Rockwood Creek, which we followed, and camped
the night there.</p>
<p>Fitzmaurice, whilst riding after the bullocks, met Mr. Bergin,
the man in charge of the party, who told Fitzmaurice that he was
instructed to mark a direct line to Collingwood, on the Western
River, and that he intended going up Thornhill Creek, cross the
divide between the Landsborough and Diamantina Rivers, and then
run down Jessamine and Mill's Creeks to the Western River, and
thence to Collingwood.</p>
<p>We took the road up Rockwood Creek to its head, and crossed
the same divide as the road party were going, only farther north,
striking the head of Manuka Creek, which we ran down to its
junction with Mill's Creek. This we followed to the present site
of Winton, which we reached at the end of October. The new road
opened by the road party had so many patches of heavy sand on it,
and long stages for water, that it was never used by carriers,
and some years later Ramsay Bros. obtained permission from the
Government to close that portion of it running down Jessamine
Creek, on the Oondooroo run.</p>
<p>A few years later the Government made tanks on the road
between Hughenden and Winton, after which all traffic from
Townsville to Winton and the west generally, came that way.</p>
<p>Mr. Tom Lynett, whom I had previously known on the Palmer, and
who was backed by Burns, Philp and Co. to start a store, had left
Townsville for the same destination as ourselves, if the locality
was found to be suitable.</p>
<p>He did not overtake his teams until they reached the
Twelve-mile Hole, on the Elderslie road, where he stopped them
while he rode on to Collingwood, the newly-surveyed township, to
inspect.</p>
<p><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a>He concluded the
country was subject to floods, so he turned his teams back, and
decided to build on the spot on which we found him camped when we
arrived with our teams.</p>
<p>We also met a man named Bob Allen, who had been located in the
neighbourhood for two years or more. Allen was an ex-sergeant of
police, who left Aramac about 1875 to start a store and public
house on what is known as the Pelican Hole, one mile west of the
site of Winton. Very heavy rains fell in 1876, and we were told
he was compelled by floods to remain two days on the wall-plate
of his building.</p>
<p>When the water allowed him, he shifted what was left of his
hotel and store, and re-erected them on the present site of the
Queensland National Bank, Winton.</p>
<p>Allen, Lynett, Fitzmaurice and I discussed the removal of the
building, and forming the town back on higher ground.</p>
<p>We offered to do the work without cost, but Allen and Lynett
decided to remain where they were. We had to accept the position,
and agreed to build in line with the others.</p>
<p>This formed the base upon which Mr. Surveyor Jopp laid out the
township afterwards.</p>
<p>After putting up a skeleton shed covered by tarpaulins, I
obtained from Ayrshire Downs two loads of wool for our teams,
returning to Townsville. In the meantime, Fitzmaurice had
disposed of &pound;600 worth of goods. I was occupied a whole day
pasting the pieces of the torn and damaged cheques. I then
started for the nearest bank, which was at Aramac, 250 miles
away.</p>
<p>A drought being on, I had many difficulties in getting
through.</p>
<p>There were only 5,000 sheep on Vindex, and these were camped
on a water-hole which had been filled by a stray thunderstorm.
The remainder of the sheep from the run were travelling for grass
and water on the coast near Townsville.<a name="Page_76" id=
"Page_76">[76]</a> As a compliment, I was allowed to replenish my
water-bag, and to obtain one drink for each of my two horses.</p>
<p>My next camp was off the road on East Darr Station, where a
mob of kanakas were cutting down scrub for fencing.</p>
<p>When I reached Muttaburra, I found the hotel to be a grass
hut. It proved to be a very rowdy place, so I decided to camp on
the ridge outside the town without food, and have my breakfast
when passing through in the morning.</p>
<p>I carried &pound;600 worth of cheques in my trousers pocket.
This I thought was the safest place.</p>
<p>I was very pleased when at last I reached Aramac, after bank
hours, and handed the money to Mr. Fulton, the manager of the
Queensland National Bank, and the next morning found only
&pound;30 of them dishonoured.</p>
<p>Immediately on my return to Winton, I started for Townsville
to load my two teams with timber and iron to build an hotel. I
travelled with Fitzmaurice's teams to assist them over a dry
stage to Rockwood.</p>
<p>We camped close to Oondooroo Station and when bringing the
bullocks in to be yoked in the morning, one of them jumped and
tossed his head in the air, and I then saw a tiger snake
disappear in a hole near by. The bullocks were yoked up, and
after going a short distance the off-side poler of one of the
teams dropped dead. On examination, we found two small punctures
in the nose. It was the bullock I had seen jump and throw up its
head.</p>
<p>When we reached Manuka Station there was only one water-hole
near the road. The owner of the station was preserving this for
his stock. The distance to the next water was 20 miles, so it was
absolutely necessary we should obtain a drink for the bullocks
before we tackled the long stage.</p>
<p><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a>I interviewed Mr.
Anderson, the owner, and having explained our position, asked to
be allowed a drink for the bullocks. He flatly declined to allow
this.</p>
<p>After about an hour's pleading, he gave his consent subject to
the proviso that the bullocks should be watered in batches of ten
at a time, and so preserve the hole from being puddled. We
watered the stock in the evening, and by travelling all night,
managed to reach Rockwood without mishap. Here I was told I would
get water for myself and horses 25 miles further on.</p>
<p>The next water after that would be 55 miles to Hughenden, on
the Flinders River.</p>
<p>I left the teams to make a long road round Tower Hill, which
was a good-watered route. When I reached the 25-mile, where I was
told I would get water, I found the ground just glassy, the water
having evaporated in the December sun.</p>
<p>Knowing the distance I would have to go without water, I
decided to hobble the horses out on dry grass, and dodged the sun
round a tree until the afternoon, when I saddled up. In about ten
miles I passed Cameron Downs Station, which was deserted. I
reached the water about eight the following morning, very
thankful to have come through the 80 miles safely. It had been a
glorious moonlight, by which I could see the tracks of numerous
snakes on the road. I felt that if my horses were bitten it would
mean a perish for me.</p>
<p>I remained at the water until about 5 p.m., when I rode into
Hughenden township, which was formed on the spot where I had
camped with the sheep some twelve years before. I put up at
Magnay's hotel, and was glad to have a square meal for
dinner.</p>
<p>In the morning I resumed my journey, and having previously
travelled the track frequently, went miles off it to obtain
better feed for the horses to camp.</p>
<p><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a>I overtook my own teams
between Dalrymple and Townsville, and drove one of them to the
camp outside the latter town.</p>
<p>After engaging another driver, the timber, iron, a billiard
table and some stores were duly loaded and despatched. I remained
to sign the four months' promissory notes for these and the goods
previously referred to, and to give the teams time to negotiate
the 30 miles to Thornton's Gap, as the crossing of the coast
range was called at this place. At the foot of the Gap I joined
them, and assisted in getting them to the top. I left the teams
here and rode on to Winton.</p>
<p>On my arrival, I found that Fitzmaurice had sold out of most
of the supplies except the grog, which he was keeping for the
hotel. He then started on horseback for Townsville to give
delivery of the wool, and load up his three teams with stores,
etc.; also more timber and iron to build the store. He would also
bring his wife and child with him.</p>
<p>At this time Winton was the rendezvous of some of the worst
characters of the west; fights were frequent on the then unformed
streets.</p>
<p>The rowdies threatened to take the grog in the store, and as
there were no police nearer than Aramac, I deemed it best to
dispose of all the liquor to Allen, the local publican, who
jumped at the chance to obtain a supply.</p>
<p>A few residents formed themselves into a vigilance
committee.</p>
<p>The late Mr. J. A. Macartney passed through to visit his
property, Bladensburg Station, and seeing how things were, wrote
to the Home Secretary asking for police protection.</p>
<p>My teams had now arrived with the building material, and
carpenters were put on to erect the hotel. This was not finished
until the end of 1879, when it was opened under the name of North
Gregory Hotel.</p>
<p><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a>Great difficulty was
experienced with the floors, there being no timber for them. We
puddled the mud and got the black gins to tramp it down, adding a
picaninny to their backs to increase their weight.</p>
<p>About July of this year, Fitzmaurice returned from Townsville
with three horses and a light dray on which he had brought his
wife and little girl.</p>
<p>Taking a plan of the hotel with me, I started for Aramac to
interview Mr. Sword, the P.M. (afterwards member of the Land
Court), to obtain a provisional license. This he refused to grant
until the building was erected.</p>
<p>When I returned Winton was entirely out of liquor, and Allen
did a great business in selling bottles of painkiller as a
substitute. It was laughable to see men take a bottle out of
their pocket, saying, "Have a nip, mate, it's only five shillings
a bottle?"</p>
<p>About March, 1880, the Western River was in high flood, and
ran miles wide.</p>
<p>Sub-Inspector Kaye, of the native police, and Mr. John Haines,
the manager of Elderslie Station, were in town, and wished to get
to the station 40 miles down the river.</p>
<p>We put our carpenter on to make a boat, which carried them and
the troopers safely to their destination.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards Sub-Inspector Fred Murray came out from
Blackall, bringing with him Sergeant Feltham, who formed the
police station in a small building which I rented to them.</p>
<p>There was only a log to which offenders were chained. One day
Feltham went down to the store, leaving a prisoner chained up.
Shortly afterwards he was surprised when he saw his prisoner (who
was a very powerful man) marching into the public house carrying
the log on his shoulder, and call for drinks. It took three men
to get him back to the lock-up.</p>
<p><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a>Fitzmaurice's teams
arriving, we were enabled to complete the store building, stock
it, and the hotel, and resume business, which had been suspended
owing to running out of goods, etc. My teams had gone down empty,
and were now on their way up with more loading.</p>
<p>The original name for the town&mdash;now known as
Winton&mdash;was Pelican Water-holes. Bob Allen, the first
resident, whom I have mentioned, acted as post-master. The mail
service was a fortnightly one, going west to Wokingham Creek,
thence <i>via</i> Sesbania to Hughenden. There was no date stamp
supplied to the office, but by writing "Pelican Water-holes" and
the date across the stamps, the post mark was made, and the
stamps cancelled. This was found to be very slow and
unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Allen was asked to propose a name, and he suggested that the
P.O. should be called "Winton." This is the name of a suburb of
Bournemouth, Hampshire, England, and Allen's native place.</p>
<p>We had kept one of Fitzmaurice's teams to haul in firewood,
and posts to fence a paddock on Vindex run, the lessees, Messrs.
Scott and Gordon, having given us permission to do so.</p>
<p>The manager of Elderslie also gave us permission to fence in a
piece of ground at the Pelican Waterhole for a vegetable
garden.</p>
<p>The team obtained employment at Bladensburg, where Mr.
Macartney was building a stockyard. As I felt clerical work to be
hard on me, I would take an occasional trip with the bullocks to
relieve the drudgery.</p>
<p>During this year the member for Gregory, Mr. Thomas
McWhannell, passed through Winton, and opportunity was taken to
bring under his notice the necessity for a water supply for the
town. The disabilities we suffered under were pointed out. We had
to procure water from a hole in Mistake Creek, two and a-half
miles away, the water of which was frequently <a name="Page_81"
id="Page_81">[81]</a>polluted by numbers of dead cattle. By his
efforts a sum was passed by Parliament for water
conservation.</p>

<br>
<p>The Oondooroo bullock team had come in for supplies, but the
driver started drinking, and was unable to take the team
home.</p>
<p>Not having forgotten my old avocation, I took his place, and
thereby began a close friendship with the Schollick Brothers, who
were completely out of rations when I arrived.</p>
<p>During this year the town and district were invaded by a
plague of rats, travelling from north-east to south-west in
hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>The vermin would eat the buttons off one's coat when camping
out. Cats and dogs were surfeited from killing them. I told the
Chinaman cook of the hotel that I would give him a pound of
tobacco if he caught a hundred rats. That night, as I was
sleeping on a stretcher at the back of the store, I was several
times awakened by what seemed to be a stamping of feet. In the
morning I found that the Chinaman had obtained an ironbark wooden
shutter, and rigged up a figure four trap with bait underneath,
and by this means had obtained a wheelbarrow full of dead
rats.</p>
<p>These rats had bushy tails, and apparently lived on the roots
of grass. These devastated the country through which they passed.
It was unknown whence they came from or whither they went.</p>
<p>The rats were followed by a plague of dead cats in the
water-holes. The rats had gone and the cats having had plenty,
did not follow, but died in the water-holes.</p>
<p>Our team driver was James Gordon, one of two brothers who
owned the selection which later became famous as Mount Morgan. We
sold this team to Warenda Station, and James Gordon went with
it.</p>
<p><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a>During this year
(1879), Vindex Station was purchased from Scott and Gordon by
Chirnside, Riley and Co., of Victoria, who, like other investors,
spent money lavishly to develop the country.</p>
<p>The manager was Mr. J. B. Riley. This gentleman died in 1889,
but is still affectionately remembered throughout the
district.</p>
<p>To those who knew him, his death was felt as that of a staunch
personal friend. By none was his death more regretted than by
those who worked for him, either as permanent or casual
employees, and by whom a monument to his memory has been erected
on Vindex.</p>
<p>Outside the property he controlled, J. B. had three personal
hobbies, a good horse, the Winton Divisional Board, and the local
Hospital. Of these three hobbies his principal one was the
hospital and its sick occupants. On his death it was felt that
the most appropriate monument to him would be a new ward for eye
complaints to be added to the hospital.</p>
<p>This was generously subscribed to by all classes, and the J.
B. Riley ward of the institution served to remind us of one who,
by his charity, goodness and generosity, was a good man, but
whose shyness did not allow of this being known. His brother, Mr.
F. W. Riley, and Mr. R. L. Chirnside, who were closely associated
with him, carried on his good work, and became as deservedly
popular.</p>
<p>Throughout this year (1880) the town and district had made
progress, and new people were coming in.</p>
<p>We were now doing a good business in both store and hotel,
consequently we had to depend on drivers for our teams without
supervision.</p>
<p>It was decided that I should follow the teams to Townsville to
in some way dispose of them, and also to bring up a man to assist
Fitzmaurice in the hotel.</p>
<p><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a>When I reached
Dalrymple I learnt that one of Fitzmaurice's teams had been swept
over the rocks while crossing the Burdekin River, and that eight
of the bullocks were drowned. It appeared that the river, though
not a-swim, was running strong at the crossing.</p>
<p>The first team crossed safely, but on the other reaching the
strong water, the driver of the team rode around to the off-side
to keep the bullocks up the stream. His efforts were unavailing.
With his horse he was carried into deep water, from which they
were rescued in an exhausted condition. Not so with the team.</p>
<p>The bullocks were all drowned, and the waggon wrecked on the
rocks. Fortunately, being empty, only eight bullocks were yoked
to the waggon, but they were the pick of the team. This accident
strengthened our desire to dispose of the teams.</p>
<p>I sold Fitzmaurice's remaining team at Townsville at a
satisfactory figure, and my own two teams were sold on their
arrival to one of the drivers on terms.</p>
<p>The agreement was that we should provide him with loading from
Townsville to Winton at the rate of &pound;30 per ton, until he
had paid the purchase money of it. This he did in a few
trips.</p>
<p>These teams could not carry the whole of the goods I had
purchased, so I left an order with Clifton and Aplin to forward
the remainder by carriers as soon as they could despatch them. I
engaged a suitable man to assist Fitzmaurice, and we left with
saddle and pack horses for Winton, taking the shorter road
<i>via</i> Charters Towers.</p>
<p>This we left at Rockwood, to make a still shorter route across
the Downs from Culloden Station, over which the road party had
ploughed a furrow across to cut the head of Jessamine Creek, at
the back of Oondooroo Station.</p>
<p><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a>In crossing the divide
between the Landsborough and Diamantina waters, we rode over
virgin country which was infested with bush rats, and numbers of
tiger snakes gorged after eating them.</p>
<p>In one place, which was 25 miles from water, the snakes were
so numerous that we had a difficulty in getting our pack horses
safely through them. Yet it is argued that snakes are never very
far from water.</p>
<p>In 1880, Cobb and Co. bought up a number of mail services
throughout Western Queensland, and the general regularity and
convenience of their coaches served to open up the country. Cobb
and Co. carried out its contracts under great difficulty in times
of flood, but more frequently of droughts, and their record is
one of which the company and its servants might well be proud.
Their coaches are now practically of the past, but the time was
when Cobb and Co.'s name was a synonym for efficiency and, when
humanly possible, for punctuality. There were many less enjoyable
ways of realising life than by, say, to be leaving Barcaldine for
Aramac in the dark of an early morning on the box seat of a coach
behind a spanking team of greys, driven by a master hand with the
whip and ribbons. And then if one stayed the night at a stage,
where two or more drivers met, and exchanged experiences of the
trip, their horses, but more than all of their passengers, what
an interesting time might be passed.</p>
<p>It was remarkable how observant of passengers the drivers
would be, while the passenger all the time laboured under the
impression that the driver's time was taken up with his
horses.</p>
<p>The idiosyncracies of passengers would be discussed by
drivers, and it more than once happened I have heard of the
peculiarities of certain passengers at places hundreds of miles
from where they came under observation.</p>
<p><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a>Nearing Charleville, on
a road I had not travelled before, I had a trip I had made from
Normanton towards Croydon related to me by a driver whom I had
never seen until then.</p>
<p>I learnt he was told the story by the driver of the Blackall
coach, who had heard it in Barcaldine from Tommy Thompson, who
was told it in Winton by Tommy Cahill, who received it at
Hughenden from Martin Warneminde.</p>
<p>I was quite satisfied and did not inquire further.</p>
<p>Judging by the way they fulfilled the requests at different
mail stages, these men must have been gifted with wonderful
memories. At one stage a driver might be asked to call at
Smith's, the storekeeper, and "tell him to give you a couple of
pounds of tea and some potatoes for me;" at another to get a pair
of boots, size three, for the missus; at Jones', to get a bottle
of eye lotion, and so on. These orders would be faithfully given
on arrival, and the goods obtained before the driver would attend
to his own comfort or pleasure.</p>
<p>From personal knowledge of Cobb and Co.'s men, in fact to
western mailmen generally, one might lift one's hat with respect
as a tribute to honesty and faithfulness for work well done and
duty honourably carried out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></p>
<p>In 1880, our young township was becoming heard of, and was
honoured with its first police magistrate in the person of Mr.
Robert Johnstone. This gentleman had been a Native Police
officer, and was associated with Dalrymple in his explorations on
the coast north of Cardwell. Dalrymple so much appreciated
Johnstone's work that he named the outlet of one of our great
sugar districts&mdash;and a most beautiful stream&mdash;after
him.</p>
<p>I believe there is only one copy of Dalrymple's narrative of
his expedition extant, and that is in our Parliamentary library.
This narrative should be re-published as a school paper so that
present-day Queenslanders might know something of the history of
discovery within their own country. I doubt if many children, or
even adults, know of the work done by Dalrymple, Hodgkinson,
Landsboro, the Jardines, and many other Queensland explorers.</p>
<p>At this time the Court House and lock-up were in the same
building, opposite our store, in the main street. It was built
originally for a boarding house.</p>
<p>All the Winton streets were named after the stations which lay
in the direction in which the streets were running. For instance,
east and west&mdash;Elderslie, Vindex, Cork and Dagworth. Those
facing the north were called Oondooroo, Manuka, Sesbania and
Werna.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnstone conducted the first Government land sale this
year, at which Lynett and ourselves secured the allotments facing
Elderslie Street on the north side, extending through to Vindex
Street at the back, comprising an area of about three <a name=
"Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a>acres each. We had put a high
figure on our improvements, and we purchased the land at the
upset price of &pound;6/10/- per half acre. Allen had only a
half-acre facing the same street, and this was purchased by the
Queensland National Bank. The bank immediately opened business in
a Coffee room, which Allen had erected at the back, pulling down
the public house to erect banking chambers in its place. Mr.
Doherty was the first manager, succeeded by Mr. Alexander, and by
Mr. Arthur Spencer a year or so later.</p>
<p>In 1879, Julius von Berger, a refugee from Schleswig Holstein,
to escape Prussian rule, commenced business as a chemist. He was
clever in his profession, unassuming in character, and behind his
retiring disposition was a fund of kindness and simplicity which
endeared him to all. He died, much regretted, a few years back at
a ripe old age.</p>
<p>The Government had now let contracts for building a court
house and police barracks in Vindex Street and post office in
Elderslie Street.</p>
<p>In 1881, a contract was also let by the Government to excavate
a tank of 15,000 yards, to a man named Collins. He quickly
commenced operations with his plant at Magpie Gully, about
half-a-mile from the town. When he had made a hole of about 12
feet deep, a very heavy thunderstorm filled the excavation with
water. Previously, he had to cart his water nearly three miles,
and he was now desirous of utilising the water in the excavation
for his camp and horses. With difficulty he obtained permission
from the Government Inspector supervising the work to make
another roadway on the opposite bank. When this was allowed, he
was able to continue the work until he had got to a depth of
19ft. 6in., or 18in. more than the specified depth of 18ft. He
then removed the earth from the opposite side to the required
depth of 18ft. When completed, he put in a voucher to be paid for
the extra 18 inches, which the Supervising Inspector refused to
certify, unless the whole<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a>
depth across was 18 feet in accordance with the specifications.
The earth was taken from one side of the bottom of the tank and
deposited on the other, to reduce the whole depth by 18 inches.
"Great is Red Tape."</p>
<p>There was a change of management on Elderslie by the
appointment of Mr. Alexander Gordon. He was a splendid specimen
of a man, 6ft. 7in. in height, built in proportion, and most
popular. I first met him between Evesham and East Darr Stations.
I inquired the distance to the latter station, which he was then
managing. He replied, "Oh! a couple of canters and a smoke." It
is told of him that when he was travelling on the coach between
Charters Towers and Hughenden, he stayed one night at a stage
which was a lignum hut, rather small in size. The driver informed
the other passengers that when he called Gordon at 4 a.m., he
found that he had stretched himself during the night, and that
his feet were through the lignum, and so far outside that fowls
were roosting on his legs.</p>
<p>About this time many of the properties were changing hands.
The Schollicks still retained Oondooroo; Elderslie was held by
Sir Samuel Wilson; Dagworth, by Fairbairns, who shortly
afterwards sold out to Macpherson and Co.; Bladensburg, by John
Arthur Macartney; Sesbania, by Manifold, Bostock and Co.; Manuka,
by Anderson and Nicol, who sold out to Baillie, Fraser and
Donald; Ayrshire Downs and Cork, by McIlwraith and Smyth. The
latter gentleman had camped with us when we were on the road to
Winton in 1878. He was taking out a blacksmith named Morgan for
Ayrshire Downs Station. Morgan afterwards started a blacksmith's
shop in Winton.</p>
<p>Mr. Smyth was afterwards elevated to the Upper House, and
although of a retiring nature, was of a friendly disposition.</p>
<p>All these investors were pouring money as if from a stream,
and developing their properties.</p>
<p><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a>The greater proportion
of the capital so spent was from Victoria, and to this State
Western Queensland must be grateful for its development.</p>
<p>Of all the then owners I have mentioned, and most of whom were
resident on their properties, only one remains&mdash;John
Bostock, of Sesbania. If those men did not win success they
deserved it, and no one was more worthy (and there were many
worthy men) than John Bostock. Schollick's spent over
&pound;100,000 on Oondooroo, and left it practically penniless.
Macpherson drove from Dagworth with all his belongings on a
buck-board, leaving unprofitable, and lost many thousands of
pounds. Fraser, of Manuka, who came a little later, died of a
broken heart. Western Queensland is greatly subject to mirages,
and it is of the nature of these which deluded many men with
bright hopes to spend great fortunes. These men battled on to the
end, but being of fighting races, when they went down they were
still fighting with never a word of despair or of defeat, and
John Bostock alone remains.</p>
<p>In this year Sir Thomas and Lady McIlwraith passed through
Winton on their way to Ayrshire Downs. The whole of the
inhabitants turned out to meet them at the police water-hole (six
miles from Winton) after dark. An address was read to Sir Thomas
by the aid of a lamp on the road. I had the pleasure of having
them as guests in my cottage.</p>
<p>This was my first meeting with McIlwraith, and I was greatly
struck with his personality. He was a man, big and broad, both
physically and mentally. Yet like most strong men, he was very
head-strong and impatient of obstruction to or criticism of his
proposals. Neither could he understand that it was not given to
every man to see quickly and to act promptly, attributes he
possessed in a remarkable degree.</p>
<p>At this time he had his Trans-continental Railway in mind, and
he patiently tried to get me to realise how closer
settlement<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a> of the western
country by smaller areas would obtain under it more than it
would, under the conditions by which it was then held, that is,
in very large areas. The then short experience of residents of
the western country were conditions of drought, and I must admit
that I thought his ideas were visionary. I have, however, lived
to see the success of the grazing farm system and the great
improvements effected by underground water supplies. In 1881,
these were practically undreamt of. It is likely that McIlwraith
could see farther into the future and dream dreams unthought of
by others.</p>
<p>The publication of McIlwraith's scheme without doubt gave the
hint to Dutton, whose Land Act of 1884 was the inception of our
present system of grazing farms. It was unfortunate that the most
bitter opponents of McIlwraith's scheme were of the squatting
class, who generally resented the cutting up of the vast areas
held by them. Had the squatters of the day not defeated his
proposals, the grazing-farm system would probably have come into
existence some years earlier than it did, and long ago the Gulf
country would have had an overland railway. That country would be
maintaining a large and prosperous population instead of being,
as it is now, almost deserted, and open to danger of occupation
by coloured races, and a menace to the safety of Australia.
McIlwraith was a far sighted statesman, having the interests of
Queensland at heart, and not a politician ready and willing to
secure votes.</p>
<p>In this year, Fitzmaurice's sight became affected, and he made
a trip to Sydney for expert advice. The whole business of the
store and hotel was now thrown on my hands. It was found on
Fitzmaurice's return, after an absence of six months, that he was
almost blind. By mutual arrangement, it was decided I should buy
him out, and he left Winton one of the best-liked men connected
with its foundation, and as I found him, a good friend and an
honest partner. The life of a hotel-keeper did not appeal to me,
so I found a purchaser for the<a name="Page_91" id=
"Page_91">[91]</a> hotel at a satisfactory figure, in Mr. W. B.
Steele, of Aramac, who took delivery in April, 1882.</p>
<p>William Brown Steele was a strange character. I believe he had
qualified as a chemist, but followed the different gold rushes
from California to Victoria, New Zealand, and Peak Downs, thence
to Aramac and Winton. His delight was to be accused of being an
unscrupulous gambler&mdash;of the type described by Bret Harte. I
know he was fairly successful at a game of cards, but this was
due more to superior playing than to good luck or manipulation.
Still, if one who thought he was Steele's equal, proposed a game,
the latter would ask:&mdash;"Shall we play the game, or all we
know?" If the former was agreed to, the game was strictly honest.
If the latter was decided on, well, there was some wonderful
playing on both sides. I never knew of Steele playing with one
inexperienced, or of transgressing the rules of the game unless
he was first challenged by his opponent. Then he did play all he
knew, and that was something. For many years Steele ran a
consultation on the Melbourne Cup which was well patronised,
until the anti-gambling legislation, which drove Adams from
Queensland, suppressed it, but did not stamp out gambling.</p>
<p>I arranged a partnership with Mr. W. M. Campbell, traveller
for Stewart and Hemmant, of Brisbane. He and his wife and family
were settled in Fitzmaurice's house by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The Bank of New South Wales had also opened a branch in a
small building on the south side of Elderslie Street. Mr. Barnier
was the first manager, succeeded afterwards by Mr. Alf.
Thompson.</p>
<p>Major Lewis, a veteran of the Indian Mutiny and Papal war, and
a fine old Irish gentleman, arrived to succeed Mr. Johnstone as
police magistrate. One of the first cases brought before him was
a claim for the return of money, under the<a name="Page_92" id=
"Page_92">[92]</a> following circumstances:&mdash;I had received
a letter from a man on Hamilton Downs Station, stating he was
coming in with the station dray for a load of rations, and was
anxious to get married. He asked me to look for an eligible
female who was willing to yoke up with him, and enclosed his
photograph. Treating the matter as a joke, I read the letter to
the girls employed at the hotel. The laundress, a big strapping
woman, said she was willing to negotiate with him. On the man's
arrival I took him round and introduced him. After a couple of
days' courtship a date was fixed for the marriage. As an earnest
of his good faith, the man gave the woman a cheque for &pound;26
to buy her wedding trousseau. When the day arrived she refused to
carry out the promise of marriage. The man came to me for advice,
stating that she would not have him, neither would she return any
of the money advanced.</p>
<p>I wrote Mr. Conran, the owner of Hamilton Downs Station,
explaining the cause of the man's delay, and as the station was
short of rations, Conran came in. He and I interviewed the woman,
pointing out her dishonesty, but we were told to mind our own
business. Mr. Conran then went to consult the P.M. The sergeant
of police told Conran the P.M. was engaged, and asked could he do
anything for him. Mr. Conran said he had come up about a girl
appropriating a sum of money given as a condition of marriage.
The sergeant said, "An' shure, an' won't she have yez now."
Conran enjoyed the joke of being taken as the rejected lover.</p>
<p>Major Lewis and the police eventually recovered a portion of
the money, and the man returned sadder but much wiser, and I
renounced for the future any desire to act as matrimonial
agent.</p>
<p>About October, 1882, we received a wire from Hughenden,
advising that some teams which were carrying our loading had been
caught in a flooded creek, and the goods damaged. I immediately
started for Wongalee Creek, about 25 miles the<a name="Page_93"
id="Page_93">[93]</a> other side of Hughenden, or 170 miles from
Winton. I found on my arrival the ground in the vicinity covered
with drapery, boots, ironmongery, besides nearly empty salt bags,
etc., etc., put out to dry. It appeared these teams had crossed
the creek and camped on the flat below the bank. A heavy
thunderstorm had fallen up the creek during the night and brought
the water down a banker, submerging the waggons, and destroying
about &pound;1,000 worth of goods. We had no redress against the
carrier, the accident, or incident, being considered an act of
Providence. The merchants assisted us by renewing our bills for
four months longer.</p>
<p>In the same year, we ordered a large consignment of goods from
Townsville. It was a dry year, and the teams carrying them were
stuck at Hughenden.</p>
<p>In those days the Government had not made the water tanks on
the road between Hughenden and Winton, and on the high, open
downs country permanent natural water was not obtainable only at
long distances. Hearing of the teams being stuck up, we
immediately wired a duplicate order to Rockhampton. The latter
goods were despatched by rail to Bogantungan (the then terminus
of the central line), and loaded on teams. The drought
conditions, although not so pronounced as in the Hughenden
district, also existed in the Central. These teams were also
blocked.</p>
<p>In about six months after the first order was given, the whole
14 teams with the Rockhampton and Townsville goods arrived on the
same day at Winton, and I was called upon to pay &pound;2,000
cash down for carriage alone; while our summer goods arrived in
the middle of winter.</p>
<p>Fortunately we were able to meet our liabilities.</p>
<p>In 1882, we had a visit&mdash;and the first&mdash;from a
clergyman of any denomination.</p>
<p><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a>He asked me if there
was a place in which he could hold service on Sunday. I told him
that the only place was the billiard-room at the hotel. I
prepared it for the ceremony by draping a blue blanket over the
table, and I put a red one opposite over the cue rack, thinking
it might help him to put a little fire into his discourse. When
all was ready, I obtained the bullock bell from the kitchen. The
Chinaman cook, who was a sporting character, said:&mdash;"Wha
for, nother raffle, all ri, put me down one pund." He refused,
however, to give the money when he learnt it was for a
church.</p>
<p>When the clergyman was leaving, we decided to present him with
a purse of sovereigns in Campbell's house, and I was deputed to
hand it to him.</p>
<p>In making a short cut to the house I had to pass the hotel
stables, into which a squatter in the orthodox breeches, boots
and spurs, was riding. He called out:&mdash;"I say, Corfield,
what are you wearing a coat for?" I replied, "There's a function
on; I'm going to present these sovereigns to a parson." He asked,
"Any champagne?" I replied, "Whips of it." He then said, "Hold
on, till I put my horse in the yard, and I'll come with you." On
reaching the house, I introduced him to the parson prior to the
presentation, and we had some champagne. With a few words I
presented the purse of sovereigns, when we naturally concluded we
would be thanked, but instead the parson said, "Let us pray." We
all then knelt to our chairs. Suddenly, as if from one in great
pain, I heard the word "Ker-ist." Thinking the parson had been
bitten by a snake or something, I looked round, but he appeared
quite at ease. I then saw over in the corner the young squatter
with blood oozing out of his pants. He had sat upon his
long-necked spurs. The parson went on with the prayer, but those
present were more occupied suppressing their laughter than in
listening to the parson's prayers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></p>
<p>In 1883, Judge Miller, with the present Mr. Justice Real as
Crown Prosecutor, opened the first District Court in Winton. Fred
Riley and myself had been put on the "Commission of the Peace,"
and appeared before the Judge to be sworn in. We then decided
that we should without delay show that we were magistrates, and
prepared to carry out our duties. We found a good, hard-drinking
man, and offered him ten shillings to spend in drink. He gladly
accepted the offer, and shortly afterwards we were asked by the
police to sit on a case of drunkenness and disorderly conduct.
Our man had kept to his agreement, and was brought before us. We
severely reprimanded him for his conduct and discharged him.
Judge Miller hearing of it, frequently recalled the joke to my
memory, and we had many a good laugh over it.</p>
<p>Early in this year, Mr. Griffith (afterwards Sir Samuel) and
Mr. Dickson (afterwards Sir James) made a tour of the north-west,
and travelled by coach from Hughenden to Winton. The party was
detained a night at Stack's public house, about midway between
the two towns, whilst the mailman rode over to Sesbania with the
mail. Mr. Griffith here made the acquaintance of Schofield, who
was managing a store near Stack's for Charlie Rowe. Stack's house
was not an inviting place, so the two Ministers spent the evening
in Schofield's quarters. The latter was shortly afterwards
appointed as Government agent on board the "Hopeful." The history
of this vessel is well-known in the Law Courts of Queensland.
Messrs. Griffith and Dickson were treated to a wine party in
Winton. There was but little enthusiasm shown at the meeting, the
majority of those present being strong McIlwraithians.</p>
<p><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a>Mr. Fraser, the
managing partner of Messrs. Baillie, Fraser and Donald, of Manuka
Station, had been in the army, and had served through the Indian
Mutiny. He was highly respected by all, but was not popular
excepting among those with whom he was intimate. They knew him to
be very hospitable and kind, and a thorough gentleman. He came of
a high Scottish family, and was proud that one of his ancestral
relations had his head cut off for loyalty to his King. I
remember being a silent listener to the relation of some
happenings which at one time or other occurred in Ireland. The
postmaster was a man who, rather young in years, appeared to have
had some experiences. He was telling Fraser of the ill-feeling
which was existent between two British regiments in a town
somewhere in Ireland, while he was there. One was the 65th, an
English, and the other the 89th, an Irish regiment. It seems that
the latter had been formed from the North Cork militia, which, I
understand, bore an unenviable reputation from their conduct
during the rebellion in 1798. The townspeople had a long memory
of this, and in the disturbance amongst the soldiers, supported
the English regiment against their own countrymen. Fraser
listened to it all, and then said, "By jove, wasn't it bitter; I
was captain of a company of the 89th, and some of my men were
badly knocked about." I thought it made the world very small to
hear such incidents being related in the far west of
Queensland.</p>
<p>Now that we had two banks, four hotels, a chemist, saddler,
besides other branches of industry, we felt that we were being
drawn perilously within the influences of civilisation and its
drawbacks.</p>
<br>

<div>Sir Thomas McIlwraith</div>
<br>
<p>The manager of one of the banks, who was deservedly popular
owing to his genial character, the kind way in which he could
refuse one an overdraft, and then suggest quite friendly and
cheerfully to the applicant: "What do you think; shall we put the
gloves on?" This gentleman had a very peculiar hobby, to attend
the sick and dying, and to bury the dead. <a name="Page_97" id=
"Page_97">[97]</a>Some incidents connected with his hobby, are as
follows:&mdash;A tank sinker from Ayrshire Downs died in the
hospital. That day a new warder and his wife, who came from
beyond Boulia, were put on. The doctor's instructions were that
any person dying of typhoid fever, as did the man in question,
was to be taken out of the ward and buried as quickly as
possible. Immediately the man died, the wardsman was taking the
body straight into the morgue, after sending word to the
blacksmith, who was also the undertaker, to come up, and remove
the body straight away for burial. Some of the patients, seeing
the body being carried out, verbally assisted the new wardsman
with their suggestions. Thus, the dead man was to be washed,
shaved, and have a clean shirt put on. It was late in the
afternoon; the wardsman did not like handling the corpse, so the
story goes, that he got a bucket of water and a mop, and mopped
the body down. This he left on the table in the morgue, and
forgot all about the clean shirt or the shaving. There was an
understanding between the police sergeant and the bank manager
that as there were no clergymen of any denomination in the town,
the sergeant would read the services for the Roman Catholics, and
the manager for all others. The undertaker-blacksmith would
notify the reader required, and funerals were carried out at any
hour, day or night. The tank sinker's funeral was timed to leave
the hospital about 12.30 a.m. For some reason the bank manager
attended this funeral. The body was then in the coffin, and a
start made for the cemetery. There were some of the dead man's
mates present, and the bank manager heard them complaining that
it was a d&mdash;&mdash;d shame to bury a man naked. When the
funeral reached the graveside, the idea struck the manager that,
as he was wearing a clean, white shirt, it would be the proper
thing to open the coffin, put his shirt on the corpse, and this
was done. The action gave great pleasure and satisfaction to the
men present, who, as a mark of gratitude, on return to town,
wished to knock up the public-house people and shout drinks for
all hands.</p>
<p><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a>One night there was a
funeral at which the manager was to read prayers. The undertaker
in this case had a small cart, used as a hearse, drawn by a mule
recently broken in, and not too quiet. As the funeral party was
walking to the cemetery in the dark, some one struck a match.
This was too much for the mule, which bolted across the plain at
the back of the cemetery. He reached the edge of a small gully
and propped. The weight behind, however, forced him over the
bank. The coffin fell out, and the top coming off, the body
rolled out on the ground. After extricating the mule, the body
was put into the coffin again, and the top put on, the nails
driven home with stones. As the mourners objected to the further
use of the mule, the party carried the body to the cemetery much
to the disgust of the undertaker.</p>
<p>Going home from Winton one night after a spree, a
boundary-rider from Ayrshire Downs got off his horse a few miles
out, and fell asleep. He woke up some time in the night, fairly
sober, and found his horse gone, so he started to walk, but
having got off the road, perished midway between the 20-mile and
the Cockatoo dam, well-known places on this road. The bank
manager was assisting in the search for the lost man, and
happened to be with the police when the body was found, which was
buried on the spot. The dead man's wife lived in Toowoomba, and
as the manager had been remitting money from her husband to her,
he informed her of the latter's death. She acknowledged the
letter, and expressed a wish that the body might be dug up and
brought into Winton for decent burial. She asked how long the
body would have to be buried before the flesh would be off the
bones and the remains could be brought in. The doctor advised it
would be fully six months. At the end of this time the widow
arrived in Winton to carry out her desires. Early one Sunday
morning the widow, accompanied by the bank manager and the
undertaker, left town to exhume the remains. The party had a
white table-cloth in a red gin case with the cover on to carry
the bones. It was an<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a>
extremely hot day as the party reached the grave, and hobbled the
horses out. The manager related "that he and the undertaker soon
had the bones upon the cloth in a nice little heap. The widow
examined each bone as it was laid down, and she missed one of the
knee-caps, so nothing would pacify her until it was found. This
we did eventually by rubbing the soil between our hands and
breaking the lumps. It was now near dark. We had arranged for the
priest to be at the cemetery by sun-down, and that the grave
would be ready. When we arrived about 10 o'clock at night the
priest and the grave-digger had gone. I then suggested that we
should take the bones in the box to Lynett's hotel, but the
landlady wouldn't hear of the remains being left at the hotel.
Eventually we left the box and the bones in the grave. The priest
came out the next morning, and having read the service, the
remains were buried decently, and the widow was happy."</p>
<p>The manager of one of the stations had died at the North
Gregory hotel. The body was immediately carried into the
manager's private quarters, at the rear of the business part of
the bank. The accountant was seen shortly afterwards protesting
against the room, which happened to be his, being used as a
morgue. He is to this day certain that from the spot where the
hand of the corpse struck the wall as it was being put down,
knocking may still be heard on the anniversary of the incident.
This bank manager was possessed of great energy and perseverance,
and a business capacity seldom met with. He was highly respected
and extremely popular with everybody high and low throughout the
western country, but he is now the head of one of our principal
industries. I often wonder if he still has the inclination to
bury people.</p>
<p>Our firm had been supplying goods and spirits to a storekeeper
at Boulia, whose P.N.'s for a considerable sum of money were not
met. Early in 1884. I decided to go out to look into matters. I
was accompanied by a Mr. Howard, who was on<a name="Page_100" id=
"Page_100">[100]</a> the look out for a hotel. On my arrival at
Boulia I found that the storekeeper had erected a building as an
hotel on a piece of land which he had made several promises to
purchase. I found the owner, bought the land, and claimed the
building erected upon it. This I considered as equal to the money
owing to us. Thos. Lynett, of Winton, had started a branch store
in Boulia, and had been supplying the same customer with goods on
credit, having the building as security. When he heard that I had
purchased the land and claimed the building, he wired to Brisbane
to stop the sale. However, nothing came of it. I sold the
property to Mr. Howard, and it was not long before he was able to
wipe out his indebtedness.</p>
<p>Mr. Eglinton, late P.M. in Brisbane, then held a similar
appointment at Boulia. A race meeting, which included a hurdle
race, was being held. In this race all the horses baulked at the
jumps and delayed the running. It was then decided to let the
races wait while the visitors had lunch, etc. The judge joined
our party. It was a hot day, even for Boulia; refreshments were
generous, and in demand. The judge, in common with the visitors,
was a thirsty soul. When we next turned our attention to the
course, a race was being run, so the judge decided to get into
the box. A grey and brown horse had negotiated the hurdles and
were coming up the straight neck and neck. When they passed the
post the Judge decided that the piebald horse had won. During my
stay at Boulia I camped, by the invitation of Mr. Coghlan, the
manager at Goodwood Station, just across the Burke River from the
township. Mr. Eglinton, P.M., and Mr. Shaw, manager of Diamantina
Lakes Station, were also guests, and we were glad to retire to
this retreat after the uproarious happenings incidental to
western towns during race time.</p>
<p>Before leaving, the P.M. asked Mr. Shaw and myself, who were
both magistrates, if we would take a "didemus potastatum" to
Monkira, about 100 miles down the river from Diamantina<a name=
"Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a> Lakes, and swear in Mr.
Debney, the manager, as a Justice of the Peace. We consented; it
was an excuse for seeing more of the country, and for a longer
outing.</p>
<p>After a few days spent at the Lakes, we started with my team
and buggy, accompanied by Mr. Shaw's little daughter. We reached
Davonport Downs, then managed by Mr. McGuigan. He told us there
were several very heavy sand hills to negotiate, and offered the
loan of a pair of staunch heavy buggy horses. He suggested
leaving my horses to spell. I accepted the offer. Shaw and myself
took it in turns to drive. At one of these sand hills the horses
stuck Shaw up, and refused, in spite of his persuasions, to
budge. After giving them a spell, Shaw suggested I should take
the reins. I had prepared my whip with a new cracker, but failed
to start the horses. I then addressed the horses in the language
of bullock-drivers, and stood up in the buggy to more effectually
use the whip. The horses started, and I kept them going. Just
then a small voice was heard from the back seat of the trap, "Mr.
Corfield, will you please remember there's a lady in the buggy."
Shaw and I immediately retired into our boots, but the horses
gave no further trouble.</p>
<p>At that time I think Monkira was the farthest station down the
river. Mr. Debney had come from Adelaide. He and Mrs. Debney gave
us a splendid reception. The governess to the family afterwards
became Mrs. R. K. Milson, of Springvale, and her eldest son
lately was married to Miss Morgan-Reade, of Winton. On our return
to Davonport Downs, we found Mr. McGuigan laid up with fever, so
I took him into Winton.</p>
<p>In November, 1884, Sir Thos. McIlwraith, who had been
inspecting his stations, passed through Winton, but while at
Ayrshire Downs he received news of his father's death, and
refused all demonstrations. I drove him to Vindex. On the road
out I told him I contemplated leaving for England the following
year. He gave me many hints for my guidance;<a name="Page_102"
id="Page_102">[102]</a> also a letter of introduction to his
brother, William McIlwraith, in London.</p>
<p>The western country was now suffering from a very severe and
prolonged drought which brought ruin to many men, and heavy loss
to those who pulled through. Taking advantage of the dry spell, I
had a small tank excavated in my paddock. A heavy thunderstorm,
averaging a little over two inches, fell over the town, and being
anxious to learn if it had any water, I asked two friends to walk
with me to the tank. We plodded about a mile in the heavy soil. I
was satisfied with the result of my inspection; not so my
companions, who lost their shoes in the boggy ground, and heaped
anathemas on me and my dam.</p>
<p>Altogether their language on the return journey was of a very
lurid nature.</p>
<p>This was the first rain for eleven months, and to celebrate
it, Winton held carnival for three weeks, during which time no
business of any sort was attempted. The time was devoted to
sports and jollifications. About two miles east and west of the
town ran wire fences, the road passing through gates. The
peculiarity of this storm was that no rain fell beyond the
fences. It was a strange sight to see green grass on one side of
the wires and outside perfectly bare.</p>
<p>I have somewhere in this narrative alluded to lignum, and it
may not be out of place at this juncture to describe what it is.
Lignum is a small shrub which grows in the dry-water courses. It
is much used as walls of houses&mdash;timber and iron being very
expensive&mdash;roofing sheds, and such like. It does not keep
out the rain, but is sun proof. With the thermometer running well
past the 100 deg. in the shade, a roasting hot wind such as
obtains in the western country, there are many worse pleasures to
be enjoyed in the west than a lignum shed and a canvas bag. of
cool rain water. Had old Omar known of the canvas water bag, he
would prefer to sing its praises rather than those of a jug of
wine. Blessings on the man who first thought of it</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></p>
<p>In April, 1885, I left Winton by coach on my way to England.
Mr. J. D. Wienholt, of Warenda Station, and Mr. J. B. Henderson,
late Hydraulic Engineer, were fellow passengers. About 10 miles
from Muttaburra we were met by a cavalcade of people on horse
back and in buggies to meet Mr. Henderson. The coach having
stopped, some bottles of champagne were opened, and Wienholt and
I were invited to join in. Mr. Henderson accompanied the
procession to town. Later in the day we were invited to the
dinner to him, to celebrate the completion of the town dam and
tank, which were still quite dry. Muttaburra had not had rain for
nearly a year. Mr. Henderson left us here to be conveyed by
private buggy to Aramac, where we again met. I travelled down the
coast from Rockhampton by the old "Keilawarra," afterwards sunk
in a collision.</p>
<p>The Russian war scare was on, and passing Lytton we had to
undergo a strict examination to prove that we were not spies. It
can be imagined with what prayers a number of sunburnt, outback
Queenslanders paraded to satisfy the defence authorities that
they were peaceful and law-abiding citizens. I remained three
days in Brisbane, the evenings of which I spent at the
Exhibition, which was frequented by ladies and gentlemen
indulging in the pleasure of roller-skating. I resumed my journey
to Sydney, and left this city by train a few days later for
Melbourne. This was my first visit to the latter city, and I
enjoyed perambulating through its streets. I joined the s.s. "Sir
John Elder" here, and sailed for England.</p>
<p>Passing through the Red Sea, we met the New South Wales
contingent returning from Suakim, where they had joined the
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a>Imperial troops, just
too late to take any active part in the Soudan campaign.</p>
<p>When we reached Lake Timsah, half-way through the Suez Canal,
we were detained because of a dredge having sunk in the Canal and
blocked the channel. A party from the ship, having its
headquarters at Shepheard's Hotel, was formed to visit Cairo and
the Pyramids.</p>
<p>The dinner at 9 p.m. was held in a quadrangle of the
hotel.</p>
<p>The after-dinner scene was very charming. Chinese lanterns
were hung in the trees, the ladies in evening dress, the officers
of the Imperial Army in mess dress of different colours.</p>
<p>Among those present were Lord Wolseley and General
Macpherson.</p>
<p>Coming down the Pyramid of Cheops, I had an Arab holding each
hand, and a boy with a gourd of water behind. The boy had unwound
his cummerbund to place under my arms by which to steady me in
jumping down from one ledge to the other. Half-way down I
suggested a halt, when one of the Arabs accosted me&mdash;"Which
fella country you come from?" "America?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"England?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Australia?"</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" he said, "very good kangaroo, you!"</p>
<p>We visited all the places of interest, including the
battlefield of Tel-eh-kebir.</p>
<p>We reached our ship, which was still blocked in the Lake. The
French people in Ismailia sent their launches out to the ships,
so we continued putting time in going ashore every day and riding
on donkeys. These animals were generally called after <a name=
"Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a>beautiful women celebrities.
Mine was called "Lillie Langtry." When we got clear, 40 steamers
were blocked. Our ship led the procession through the Canal.
There was only just room for us to pass where the accident had
happened, and when we leached Suez 200 ships, including several
men-of-war, were awaiting our arrival to pass south.</p>
<p>We spent a day at Naples, and in time I arrived in Plymouth
Sound in mid-summer, having left it 23 years before in
mid-winter. As I had accepted an invitation to visit my cousin,
Mr. S. P. Newbery, who resided at Plympton St. Mary, six miles
out from Plymouth, so I left the ship. This relative was land
steward to Lord Morley. He had been selected to judge the cattle
at the Royal Agricultural Show at Preston, Lancashire, and I
accompanied him. The warm, genial weather added to my enjoyment.
We took up our quarters at Blackpool, as there was no
accommodation to be had in Preston. The Prince of Wales (late
King Edward the VII.) attended the show, and Mr. Newbery was
appointed to show him round. I followed as if in the Prince's
retinue, and enjoyed the novelty of the situation. Returning to
Devonshire I spent a glorious time keeping my cousin's horse in
condition, and occasionally following the hounds. Whilst there I
made a trip to the Isle of Wight, and was present in Fotheringham
Church when Princess Beatrice was married to Prince Henry of
Battenburg. I need hardly say I was not present by
invitation.</p>
<p>During my stay at Plympton St. Mary, the 1886 elections were
held, and my relative being in politics a conservative, took an
active part in the return of Sir John Kennaway (who died a few
years ago, father of the House of Commons). Mr. Newbery was
chairman of many of his meetings at which I attended. A polling
booth was at the school house at Plympton, and on the day of the
poll, I was much amused to see gentlemen's carriages being driven
to the poll with the coachmen and footmen in livery, and men in
their working dress<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a>
stepping out to vote. Presently a Devonshire farmer drove up in
his donkey cart. I noticed the donkey was dressed in the Liberal
colours. The farmer recorded his vote, and came out on the porch,
when he was accosted by another farmer, thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Wull! Farmer Symes, you been an' voted?"</p>
<p>"Yus," he replied.</p>
<p>"Wull, but how's this, I allus thocht ye was a
Conservative?"</p>
<p>"So I be."</p>
<p>"But look at yer dunkey ther' all dress'd up in the Liberal
colours?"</p>
<p>"Ah!" he said, "I'm a man, but that's an ass."</p>
<p>On returning to London I delivered my letter of introduction
to Mr. William McIlwraith, by whose kindness I met many leading
business people, as well as Lord Randolph Churchill, who appeared
to be built up of fine live wires.</p>
<p>I left England in May, 1886, taking my passage through Cook
and Son, <i>via</i> America. From New York I made trips to
Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Washington. After a week or so I
joined the overland train for Albany, visiting Niagara Falls, and
other interesting places in that locality. Going on to Chicago, I
spent a few days visiting the meat works. Wonderful energy had
been shown in re-building the city after the destructive fire
which happened a short time previously. From Denver I travelled
by the narrow gauge "Denver and Rio Grande" line to Utah. Here I
spent a week amongst the Mormans, who are a remarkably
industrious and energetic, as well as peculiar people. One of the
elders introduced me to a daughter by his tenth wife. I had
frequent dips in the Salt Lake, in company with the Mormans,
their wives and families. The water of the lake is so buoyant
that one might throw up one's hands and remain upright. The body
would sink only to the chest.</p>
<p><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a>The trains were
crowded with men belonging to the grand army of the Republic who
were going to San Francisco, where the 20th anniversary of peace,
after the Civil War was to be held. The Americans were all very
friendly to me. I was invited to join them, and as I was much
sunburnt easily passed as one of the veterans.</p>
<p>I took up my quarters at the Palace Hotel, which occupied
about four acres of ground. I believe it was at that time the
largest hotel in the world. I managed to get a room at four and
a-half dollars a day. When I entered it I could see nothing but
"Corfield." There were mirrors all round excepting where the
furniture stood. In the quadrangle, just below my balcony, a band
played continuously.</p>
<p><a name="Frisco" id="Frisco">'Frisco</a> was <i>en-fete</i>.
Arches were erected in Market Street, and bunting was flying
everywhere. I spent a week in the city, having for a companion a
young doctor, for whom I had brought a parcel from his parents in
England. He obtained a <i>locum tenens</i>, and gave up the time
to pilot me round. We visited every point of interest, including
the Chinese gambling dens, in and around 'Frisco, which has a
very interesting history dating from the time of the Spanish
missions.</p>
<p>On the trip across the Pacific we had a nice complement of
passengers. A day at Honolulu was spent enjoying the beauty
spots. We tried to call on the "King," but as he was enjoying a
carousal, he could not receive us. We called at Apia, in the
Samoan Islands, and when crossing to New Zealand, we noticed that
the sea was covered by what appeared to be pumice stone. On our
arrival at Auckland we heard of the eruption of Mount Tarawera.
Mr. Rutherford, a gentleman well-known throughout N.S.W. and West
Queensland, the principal of Cobb and Co. in Australia, was a
passenger with his daughter from 'Frisco. I accompanied them
during the three days the boat remained in Auckland. Shortly
after our arrival at the Star Hotel, Mr. Rutherford, who had
picked up a "Queenslander," said to me,<a name="Page_108" id=
"Page_108">[108]</a> "Who is driving the coach from Muttaburra to
Winton?" I said, "Macpherson." "Well," he said, "he won't drive
it long when I get back." "Why?" I asked. "Well, here is a
paragraph in this paper, which says he capsized the coach in
Elderslie Street, opposite your office."</p>
<p>We duly reached Sydney in August, 1886, and after spending a
week there, I sailed for Rockhampton, and proceeded to Peak Downs
Station, which my brother-in-law, Edmund Casey, was then managing
for the Messrs. Fairbairn. I found he had broken in to harness
for me two Arab ponies which would trot their 12 miles an hour. I
trucked these and a buggy I had purchased in Sydney to Alpha, the
then terminus of the Central railway line, where my other
horses&mdash;brought from Winton&mdash;met me. Good rains had
fallen in July, thus breaking up the long drought which had
commenced three years before. I had plenty of grass and water all
the way to Winton. I camped a night at Mount Cornish, and met Mr.
and Mrs. Edkins for the first time for 20 years, having last met
them on the Flinders River when they were on their honeymoon
trip, as I have already related. They now had quite a large
family, and made me very welcome. I arrived at Winton driving
four grey horses, the two Arabs Mr. Casey broke in for me being
splendid leaders.</p>
<p>A few evenings after my arrival I was the guest at a smoke
concert given by the Dramatic Club in Steele's hall in my honour.
Mr. Dodd, postmaster, the president of the club, was in the
chair. There was some fine speeches, and a splendid display of
wit and repartee. On entering the room, my attention was
attracted by the drop-scene on the stage representing the
Catskill Mountains in America. The members had given a rendering
of "Rip Van Winkle," previous to my leaving for England. The
scene was a daub of colours with a hole cut in the sky, to which
a piece of calico had been affixed at the back to represent
either the sun or the moon, I forget which. On returning thanks
to the toast of my health, I related<a name="Page_109" id=
"Page_109">[109]</a> many of my experiences since I left them in
1885, but apparently I made a hit when I described my sailing up
the Hudson River from New York. Seeing a mountain in the
distance, with numerous houses here and there, the afternoon sun
shining and throwing different shades over mountain and river, I
inquired from a fellow passenger if he could tell me the name of
that beautiful mountain? He replied the "Catskill Mountains." I
said, "Are you sure?" "Sure enough," he said. "Why?" "Well,
because I have seen a painting of it in Steele's Hall at Winton,
and it's not a bit like that." The laughter that followed easily
made me feel at home with the company during the remainder of a
very pleasant evening. Dr. Hawthorne made a great hit in his
speech in explaining the anomaly of a bashful Irishman.</p>
<p>I found many changes had taken place during my seventeen
months' absence. The Schollicks' had left Oondooroo, which had
become the property of Messrs. Ramsay Brothers and Hodgson, with
Mr. M. F. Ramsay as manager.</p>
<p>Winton also had grown quickly. The <i>Winton Herald</i>
newspaper, with Mr. Maxwell as proprietor, was issued as a
weekly.</p>
<p>Roller skating was the rage. I remember one afternoon when
passing the Court House, I went over to see what was causing a
noise there. Looking through the window I saw all the benches
stacked on one side, and the police magistrate practising on
skates. He had a pillow strapped at the back of his neck, and
another on a lower portion of his body for buffers. He stumbled,
and I saw the use for the pillows.</p>
<p>The growth of grass in 1886 occasioned extensive bush fires in
the end of this and the beginning of the following year. A very
large fire occurred at Vindex. I called for volunteers to join in
putting it out. The call was readily responded to, and I headed a
large party composed of all classes of men to assist<a name=
"Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a> the station hands. By our
combined efforts we succeeded in putting the fire out, but not
until it had burnt many miles of country. In those days there was
no ill-feeling between labour and capital, or employers and
employee. All united to work for the common good. Subsequently
the same generous help was extended to Elderslie and Ayrshire
Downs Stations.</p>
<p>In 1887, I can say the residents of Winton were as if all were
of one family. They made their own pleasures, at which all
classes were welcome, and invitations were unnecessary. This
proved one of the happiest times of my life.</p>
<p>The new owners of Oondooroo were developing their property
regardless of cost. Amongst the many innovations introduced by
them, but which now have become necessaries, was the system of
private telephone lines over the run. In connection with this
system was an ingenious idea, something like a compass card, by
means of which bush fires were located, and which saved a great
deal of unnecessary work and riding. With the exception of
Norman, the youngest, who went "west" in France during the late
war, I believe the Ramsays are still in the land of the living.
It is a pity that Queensland is the loser by not having more men
of the same high character as the Ramsay's, of Oondooroo.</p>
<p>In November, 1887, John Bartholomew, who was travelling
manager for Cobb and Co., asked me&mdash;as their Winton
agent&mdash;to accompany him to Croydon, to which place he was
bound in connection with some coach accident which had occurred
in that district, and I accepted the invitation. We travelled by
coach to Hughenden 150 miles, thence down the Flinders to
Cloncurry, distant 265 miles, and on to Normanton, 240 miles.</p>
<p>This latter portion was completed under great difficulties,
the early wet season necessitating our working day and night to
keep contract time. On our way we saw where a bullock-dray loaded
with explosives had been blown up. How the<a name="Page_111" id=
"Page_111">[111]</a> explosion happened was never known, but
after it occurred nothing remained of the bullocks; some of the
iron work of the dray was picked up a mile away.</p>
<p>Before we reached Normanton we were reduced to three horses,
and the rains having been heavier, we were continually digging
the coach out of bogs. At dark one <a name="evining" id=
"evining">evening</a> I walked on to lessen the load, and on
crossing a plain I saw a log on the side of the road on which I
decided to have a rest. I sat on it in the dark, and feeling
something move, I put my hand down on the cold, clammy tail of a
snake. His lordship evidently had his head in a hole, or might
have bitten me. The shock gave me increased energy, and I reached
the groom's change at 10.30 p.m. The coach arrived an hour later.
We were all thoroughly done up, and had a supper of stewed
galahs. The stage-keeper was without flour.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Normanton we were in a sad plight from our
rough experiences. The next day Bartholomew and myself were the
only passengers on the coach for Croydon. Unusually heavy rain
had fallen during the night, and the road was bad. We reached
Creen Creek, half-way to Croydon, that evening. Here we met the
coach from that place on its way to Normanton. The driver of this
coach gave a bad account of the road ahead. It was decided that
Bartholomew and the driver should ride, and pack the mail on
horses to Croydon. Mr. Bartholomew arranged with the other driver
to take me back to Normanton. The coach was full, and I had to
sit on the splash board with my legs hanging over the two mules
which were in the pole. We had not gone far before we got into a
bog. The three horses in the lead were floundering so much that
we had to take them out, but the mules stood quietly up to their
bellies in the soft ground. The passengers were all males and
turned to. By levering the wheels on to the cushions, we got the
coach on hard ground again. This happened so often that I decided
to walk on. I came upon a bullock team loaded with<a name=
"Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a> timber, bogged. With it was
Fred Shaw, who at one time was connected with Cobb and Co., and
who was taking the timber to Croydon for building. I offered my
help to get the waggon out of the bog by assisting the driver on
the off-side with a whip. We succeeded after some time, but not
without the use of some language.</p>
<p>In soft ground bullocks will stand up to their middle chewing
their cud whilst a clear passage is being cut through for the
wheels, and if once got to pull together they will invariably get
through. Mules are practically the same, hence Cobb and Co. using
them. The moment a horse loses his footing he commences to plunge
about, and so turns the ground into liquid in which he has no
footing.</p>
<p>The coach camped at a wayside place that night. I walked on in
the morning; the coach overtook me eight miles from Normanton,
into which I rode, and was glad to reach the hotel and comfort
once more.</p>
<p>During the week spent in Normanton waiting the return of Mr.
Bartholomew, and also the arrival of a steamer, I made the
acquaintance of Mr. Forsyth, who was the resident manager for
Burns, Philp and Co., and later on sat in Parliament for many
years.</p>
<p>At Thursday Island there was no jetty, so our steamer anchored
out in the channel. Here Mr. (now Sir Robert) Philp joined us
from a tour of inspection of the company's branches. He had not
long before been returned at a bye-election for Musgrave. When
leaving, he and I boarded the steamer in a boat belonging to the
company, with a black crew dressed in white shirts, which gave
them quite a picturesque effect. On reaching Cairns, Mr. Philp
included me in his party to go by rail to Redlynch, the then
terminus of the line. The construction of the line up the range
towards the Barron Falls was then going on, but we were unable to
view the Falls.</p>
<p><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a>On our trip down,
Mr. Philp mentioned that the McIlwraith party would require a
representative for the Gregory in place of the late Mr. Thos.
McWhannell. He hinted to me that probably my name as successor
would be acceptable to Sir Thomas McIlwraith. I replied, "I know
nothing of politics, and have no desire to take them on."</p>
<p>I remained over Christmas in Townsville, and arrived in Winton
to celebrate the new year of 1888. Election news was the
absorbing topic.</p>
<p>I asked Sir Thomas McIlwraith by telegram who was the party's
accredited candidate, giving certain names which were spoken of.
He replied, "Know nothing about the gentlemen mentioned; why
don't you stand yourself?" Mr. J. B. Riley, of Vindex, happened
to be in town. I showed him the wire, which he took, and went
away.</p>
<p>In the beginning of March, Mr. Riley, accompanied by others,
presented me with a requisition to become the McIlwraith
candidate. This was signed by nearly all the inhabitants of
Winton and pastoralists of the district. When handing it to me,
Riley said, "Now, I give you two hours to consult your partner,
and give me your decision." After consultation with Mr. Campbell,
my partner, I assented to the request, and called a meeting of
the electors, which I addressed in the Court House in April,
1888. I then started in my buggy alone to hold meetings at the
different stations. At Elderslie one was held at the woolshed,
where I had a bale of wool as the platform. At Vindex, the
meeting was held in the blacksmith's shop, I standing on the
anvil block of wood, and so on.</p>
<p>Finally, when the nomination day came round, I was the only
candidate. So I was returned unopposed.</p>
<p>During the Easter holidays in April, 1888, a cricket match,
Country <i>v.</i> Town, was held at Vindex Station. At any rate,
this was the name under which invitations were given by the
Rileys,<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a> Chirnsides,
Ramsays and Bostocks to the townspeople of Winton, as an
expression of the goodwill and friendship which then existed
among all classes throughout the district.</p>
<p>Vindex was noted for its hospitality at all times, but it now
excelled itself.</p>
<p>A lot of school-boys could not have enjoyed themselves more
than did the many grey heads among the company. Woe betide any
one, host or guest, who shirked, or did not join in the fun. A
visitor from town tried to do so by fixing a nice quiet camp far
away from the hurly burly. His actions were observed by the
postmaster, who put his bull dog in the visitor's bed,
instructing the animal not to allow any one into it. When the
visitor who shirked, tried to retire for the night the bull dog
tackled him, tore his pyjamas off, and left him as a subject for
much raillery.</p>
<p>One visitor who had arrived from Rockhampton the previous day,
was found wandering in the vicinity of the big dam, where he said
he was enjoying the salt ozone.</p>
<p>The country won the match easily, but I think they took
advantage of the town.</p>
<p>This will be understood from the fact that a dozen bottles of
whisky, and a two-gallon jar of the same medicine were brought on
the ground for refreshments. The town went into bat first, and by
the time their innings was finished, so were the
refreshments.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></p>
<p>When returning from the Court House with my &pound;20 deposit
after the nomination, I was way-laid by Sergeant Murray, of the
police, who in oily sentences of congratulation suggested that I
should give half of the money towards the erection of a Roman
Catholic church, then about to be built. I succumbed to his
flattery, although my own clergyman was daily expected, and my
name was coupled with Father Plormel, the resident priest, on a
piece of paper, and inserted in a hole in one of the blocks
underneath the building. The church has been enlarged since, and
I heard that the paper with our names, and those of the members
of the committee, was found in a good state of preservation. This
Sergeant Murray was a man of great dry humour and shrewdness.</p>
<p>One day I was speaking to him, when one of two partners in a
racehorse came up, and told us he and his partner had a dispute;
the latter had the horse in his possession, in Lynett's stable,
the door of which was secured with a padlock and trace chain.
Murray asked him, "Why don't ye lock him up?"</p>
<p>"Hang it all, the horse is locked up already; what is the good
of my locking him up?"</p>
<p>"Well, as your partner has the horse locked up you can't get
him out, and if you lock the horse up, then your partner can't
get him out."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see," said the owner, and immediately bought the lock
and chain.</p>
<p>This advice was so novel to us that we all visited the stables
and were amused to see two locks and trace chains to prevent the
removal of the horse by either partner. It proved a common
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a>sense way of settling
the dispute in a few hours, and the partners became better
friends afterwards.</p>
<p>On reaching Brisbane to attend the House, I interviewed Sir
Thomas McIlwraith, who, after congratulating me on my return,
said:&mdash;"I intend to put down an artesian bore at Winton." I
asked if I might make use of this. He replied, "Well, it rests on
me and my party being returned to office."</p>
<p>I felt certain that this would follow, so I wired to Winton
that I had been promised an artesian bore. The town was painted
red on the news.</p>
<p>At the opening of Parliament, Sir Samuel Griffith, seeing 45
members to his 27, resigned the Premiership, and Sir Thomas
McIlwraith was sent for by Sir Anthony Musgrave. On the House
meeting again within a few days, Mr. Albert Norton was
unanimously elected speaker, and Sir Thomas McIlwraith asked for
two months to construct his ministry. This was granted.</p>
<p>I returned to Winton, and on arrival was accorded a typical
western reception for obtaining the promise of an artesian bore
for the town. At this stage it was only a promise, but the
residents had such faith in McIlwraith that they accepted it as a
fact. Parliament assembled in July with Sir Thomas McIlwraith as
Premier.</p>
<p>In the early part of the year a bush fire broke out on the
road to Ayrshire Downs, and parties were organised to extinguish
it. The police preceded us, and noticing fires springing up
further on, decided to push ahead to ascertain the cause. They
saw a man near the lighted grass with a box of matches in his
hand, and arrested him on suspicion. When brought before the
Police Magistrate, the man was charged under the English Act
against arson.</p>
<p>Through correspondence with the Attorney-General, it was
learnt that the English Act applied to artificial, and not
to<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a> natural, grasses.
The offender was discharged with a caution, as the evidence was
really only circumstantial.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards he was caught red-handed firing the grass
on Warenda Station, on his way to Boulia. He was brought before
the Boulia justices, who sentenced him to three months'
imprisonment under the "Careless Use of Fire Act." This was the
maximum penalty that could be inflicted. On completion of his
term the grass-burner was liberated, and vowed he would burn the
whole of the d&mdash;&mdash;d squatters out.</p>
<p>The pastoralists hearing of it, put men to watch him through
their respective runs.</p>
<p>I returned to Brisbane with the intention of defeating his
designs. On interviewing McIlwraith, he advised me to see Mr.
Thynne (who was then Solicitor-General), and explain matters to
him, adding:&mdash;"Thynne will draft a clause for you in the
'Injuries to Property Act.' You can bring in the Bill for the
Amendment yourself." I did so, and found I was saddled with an
amendment of an Act of Parliament without any previous knowledge
of procedure. However, through the kindness of Mr. Bernays (the
clerk of Parliament), I was instructed in this, and successfully
carried through the second reading of the amendment to the
Act.</p>
<p>Under this a man found burning natural grass may be prosecuted
under the "English Act against Arson," which meant a maximum of
14 years' imprisonment.</p>
<p>In committee, Sir Samuel Griffith suggested I should insert a
clause whereby it could be tried at a District Court, and so
prevent witnesses having to attend a Supreme Court, held on the
coast. The Bill, with this addition, went through committee. I
was informed by Mr. Archer, M.L.A. for Rockhampton, that this was
the first occasion in Queensland for a member to navigate a Bill
through the House in his first Parliamentary year.</p>
<p><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a>I thought I had
completed my work with the Bill, but was surprised when Mr.
Bernays asked me whom I had selected to take it through the
Council. I asked the Hon. William Aplin to pilot it through, and
the amendment to the "Injuries to Property Act" was assented to
on the 23rd of October, 1888.</p>
<p>On the second evening after my arrival I sauntered in the
Botanic Gardens to kill the time to dinner at 7 p.m. Being a
stranger, I was ignorant that the Gardens were closed at 6 p.m. I
noticed that the few people I had seen on entering had entirely
disappeared. As the dinner hour approached, I went to the gate
and found it locked, as were the other gates I tried to pass
through. Continuing my walk, I found an opening in the hawthorne
hedge, which separated the Gardens from the Domain, in which
Government House was then situated. I crawled through, and when I
reached the lodge gates, I was asked by a policeman stationed
there, if I had been to Government House?</p>
<p>I said, "No."</p>
<p>"Then where did you come from, my friend?"</p>
<p>"From the Gardens."</p>
<p>"And how did you get here?"</p>
<p>I then explained the circumstances.</p>
<p>"Where do you belong?"</p>
<p>"Winton."</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Corfield."</p>
<p>"Yes, is that so? What are you?"</p>
<p>"I am one of the new members of Parliament." Then the blarney
came out.</p>
<p>"Pass on, Mr. Corfield, your face would carry you anywhere,
sir."</p>
<p>And so ended the incident.</p>
<p><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a>In 1888,
&pound;50,000 was put on the Estimates for sinking artesian
wells, and a contract entered into with a Canadian company to
sink 7,500 feet at certain specified places. Wellshot Station was
selected as one, to encourage private enterprise, to try for
water at great depths.</p>
<p>When at Winton, early in 1889, I was handed a telegram from
Mr. Henderson, the Hydraulic Engineer, advising me that the
sinking of the well at Wellshot had to be abandoned, and as
carriers were not procurable at Barcaldine to take the plant to
Winton, it had been decided to send it to Kensington Downs.</p>
<p>I immediately called a public meeting, and laid the matter
before it. The meeting decided that I should go to Barcaldine the
following morning. Owing to accidents to the coach, and want of
sobriety at several of the coach stages, we were very much behind
time in arrival. I found that I could obtain carriers to take the
plant to Winton at a reasonable price, and wired the Engineer,
but, although I remained a week in Barcaldine, I did not get even
an unsatisfactory reply from that officer.</p>
<p>I now received a hint that there were influences at work to
prevent the plant going to Winton, and to send telegrams through
another place. I arranged a long explanatory wire to Sir Thomas
McIlwraith, to be sent from . . . . the operator at that place
cutting off Barcaldine while the message was being sent, and the
following day I was authorised by the engineer to arrange with
carriers for the transport of the plant to Winton.</p>
<p>It was very pleasant to witness the chagrin of the local
people when they learnt how their engineering was defeated.</p>
<p>I learnt now that some Brisbane ladies did not possess
politeness, as one of them sat on my hat when it was on my head,
and did not apologise. It happened in this way. In those days the
Brisbane trams were drawn by horses. I wished<a name="Page_120"
id="Page_120">[120]</a> to go to Ascot. When near the Custom
House I saw a two-decker car just leaving. A lady was mounting
the steps to gain a seat on the top. I ran and caught the car,
following the lady up the steps. At the turn of the road the
driver gave the horses the whip, they jumped forward, the sudden
jerk caused the lady to lose her balance and her grip of the
hand-rail. She sat on the hat on my head. The article, a hard
felt, was pressed down with her weight. The sides opened up, and
the rim fell down and became fast over my nose. I saw stars, but
not the lady's face. The conductor assisted to dislodge the hat
from my nose, and I left the car to purchase a new hat. Probably,
I saved the lady's life, but she continued her way to the top,
apparently treating the accident as an every-day occurrence. I
was unable to make a claim for damages to my hat or self
respect.</p>
<p>Mr. Tozer (the then Home Secretary), was a lover of deep-sea
fishing, and I frequently accompanied him in his excursions. One
Friday, when the House was not sitting, I accepted an invitation
to join him in a trip to a new fishing ground. I joined the
"Otter" at the Queen's Wharf at 2 p.m. Our party comprised
Captains Pennefather and Grier, John Watson, M.L.A., and Messrs.
W. H. Ryder, A. A. McDiarmid, Primrose and myself, besides the
officers and crew. We cruised along Moreton Island and caught
sufficient fish for our tea, after which we retired to our bunks,
and the steamer made for the Tweed Heads. About 3 a.m., we were
awakened by the cry of "Fish Oh!" On reaching the deck we found
the officers and crew hauling in schnapper as fast as they could
bait their hooks. We were all soon engaged in the same sport.
Each line had four hooks on, and the fish were so plentiful that
often when a line was pulled up with, as one thought, one big
fish on it, there would be three or four, some hooked through the
eye, others by the tail. We fished until 8 a.m., and found on
counting we had 1,100 fish aboard. Tozer had caught the highest
single catch of 155, whilst mine, the smallest number,<a name=
"Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a> was 79. The sailors cleaned as
many as they could on our return. When opposite the South Passage
we sent a boat to the Lighthouse to wire Brisbane for any person
wanting fish to meet the boat at the wharf, and to bring bags
with them. Many did so, but all could not be taken away, and a
quantity was dumped into the river. This was the record catch of
the season, and I have never heard of it being beaten.</p>
<p>At this time, and for a few years afterwards, I had as partner
in a small pastoral property, a Mr. Wm. Booth. He was said to
have been mixed up with some troubles connected with Irish
affairs, and that the name he went under was assumed. Whether
this was so or not, I found him to be a fine, straight-forward
man, and was greatly affected when in 1894 his charred remains
were found on the run. The mystery of his death remains
undiscovered. On his death I wound up the pastoral partnership,
and placed the value of Booth's interest in the hands of the
Curator of Intestate Estates. Every effort was made to discover
his relatives, but so far, I believe, his estate remains
unclaimed.</p>
<p>To those interested in constitutional law, the Kitt's case,
which occurred in 1888, may prove interesting. This incident
happened in connection with a pair of boots, but from it was
obtained the decision that the Governor should follow the advice
of his ministers on matters not affecting the authority of the
Crown. It was laid down that they were responsible for giving the
advice, not he for accepting it. The incident was a small matter
to define a very important point.</p>
<p>I think it was about this time that the police were called
upon to act in opposition to the Naval Forces of the State, under
the following circumstances. The Naval Commandant of the time had
a disagreement with the Minister administering the Navy, and
ordered the two war vessels, the "Paluma" and "Gayundah" to put
to sea, contending he was under the<a name="Page_122" id=
"Page_122">[122]</a> control of the Admiral in charge of the
station, and defied the Minister. Steam was up on the vessels,
when a rather large body of police, fully armed, was marched down
to the Botanic Gardens, and lined the river banks ready to fire
on the ships if they were moved. Meanwhile, the wires were at
work. The Admiral disclaimed control over the vessels, as it was
a time of peace, and the Commandant retreated from the stand he
had taken. The matter quietened down, but the Commandant shortly
afterwards retired from the service of the State.</p>
<p>Mr. W. Little, more popularly known on northern goldfields as
Billy Little, represented the electorate of Woothakata in the
Assembly. When speaking on the railway which it had been decided
should start from Cairns to Herberton, he argued, "S'help me
G&mdash;&mdash;, Mr. Speaker, they are building a railway at
Cairns over a mountain, down which a crow couldn't fly without
putting breeching on." The simile convulsed the House, but did
not affect its decision.</p>
<p>During this session I could not but admire the patience and
courtesy with which Sir Samuel Griffith treated all, even his
opponents, after he once expressed himself on a measure. Time and
again he would point out defects, which his legal mind detected
in the wording of Bills, but which were not perceptible to the
ordinary lay mind.</p>
<p>In 1889, when the Estimates were being formed, Sir Thomas
McIlwraith insisted that &pound;40,000 should be put on for
building a Central Railway Station in Ann Street, Brisbane. His
colleagues dissented, holding the view that the then existing
station would serve for a generation, or longer. McIlwraith
resigned the premiership, but retained the office of
Vice-President of the Executive Council.</p>
<p>Mr. B. D. Morehead succeeded him as Premier, but there were no
other changes in the personnel of the Cabinet.</p>
<p><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a>During the recess of
1890, I left Winton in March, after a good, wet season, to make a
tour of my electorate, visiting the townships and stations
throughout the district, and going close to Lake Nash, over the
border of the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>I held meetings at the places visited, covering a distance of
1,600 miles, yet I was unable to visit the whole district.</p>
<p>At Glenormiston, one of the stations visited, the blacks had
just returned from the Mulligan River, where they had procured
their season's supply of "Pituri." This is obtained from a small
bush, and when prepared for chewing, has an effect similar to
opium. The "pituri" is much prized by the blacks. It is prepared
for use by the seeds being pounded up and mixed with gidya ashes,
which the gins chew until it obtains the proper consistency. It
then resembles putty, and when not being used as chewing gum is
carried by the blacks round their ears. If the native offers one
a chew it is a sign of friendship and hospitality. This
friendship was offered me, but declined with thanks. I obtained a
small bagful of the seeds, intending to give them to Mr. Bailey,
Curator of the Brisbane Gardens, but I made other use of it. I
was compelled to make easy stages on account of the heavy
pulling. The season was bitterly cold; camping on the open downs
with no shelter was not pleasant.</p>
<p>The distance from Boulia to Springvale is 80 miles, the only
traffic along it being the pack horse of the mailman once a week.
One of the places I camped at was known as Elizabeth Springs.
This spring is a circular hole of about three feet in diameter,
in which warm water is continually bubbling up. The overflow runs
into Spring Creek, and runs for 15 miles, emptying into a large
hole opposite the head station. A peculiarity of this spring is,
if one jumps into it, the force of the water causes the body to
rebound like a rubber ball, and small particles of sand coming up
with the water causes a stinging sensation. The depth of the
spring is unknown.</p>
<p><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a>About 40 yards from
this spring there is another hole, the water of which is quite
cold, and of an inky colour. This hole has attributes opposite to
the other, that is&mdash;a body will sink quickly in its water.
The blacks have a tradition that a gin jumped into it, and was
never seen again. These springs are on Springvale run.</p>
<p>On arriving at the station, I found Mr. Milson was out
mustering, but Mrs. Milson, who remembered me at Monkira some six
years before, made me very comfortable. I left the following
morning to cover the 37 miles to Diamantina Lakes Station. When I
reached the Gum Holes, on the boundary of the two runs, I decided
to camp. Mr. Milson turned up here, and from him I learnt that
the Diamantina River, which was about seven miles ahead of me,
was uncrossable, and that it was running about four miles wide.
He instructed me that when I reach the river, I was to go to a
high ridge two miles back, and make a large bonfire at night. I
arrived at the river the following day, when my man and I
employed ourselves the whole afternoon in getting wood, which was
scarce and some distance away. The closer timber had been used by
the mailman to attract the attention of the station people in
flood time, as we were to do.</p>
<p>The station was about eight miles from the ridge, and we had
great trouble during the night to keep the fire burning. The next
afternoon Mr. Shaw, the manager, came across in a canvas boat,
and camped the night with us. It was arranged I should return
with him in the boat and leave the man with the horses, as it was
impossible to cross them. We were out of meat, so Mr. Shaw
promised to send some to the man the following day. We started on
our four-mile pull, Shaw with the sculls, and I in the stern to
steer the canoe. In the shallow water between the channels we had
to be very careful, as patches of lignum were showing above the
water, and our boat being only canvas, a slight prick of the
lignum would perforate<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a>
it. However, we made the crossing safely, and arrived at the
station at sun-down. I was very glad to get comfortable quarters
once more, and Mr. and Mrs. Shaw and their family treated me
right royally.</p>
<p>After a stay of five days we found the water had gone down and
left several islands visible between the channels. When the flood
allowed we started, taking a long, strong piece of rope, <a name=
"povisions" id="povisions">provisions</a>, and about ten black
fellows. Shaw and I paddled the boat containing the rope and
provisions. The black boys swam the channels, and carried the
boat across the islands, where we walked. We arrived at my camp
in the afternoon, and prepared for an early start on the morrow.
Whilst I was away a mob of travelling cattle had come to the
camp. The men had killed a beast, and were making a boat of the
hide to carry their saddles and provisions across. The mosquitoes
that night were something to be remembered, and my man looked as
if he had measles.</p>
<p>We had a good breakfast at daylight, and then commenced
crossing in the following manner:&mdash;Some of the boys would
wade into the water until it was up to their waist. I would then
drive the buggy and four horses up to them, unharness the latter,
putting the harness in the boat to be rowed to dry land. The boat
would then return for the provisions and every movable article in
the buggy. The horses were then swam over, after which the rope
was attached to the axle of the buggy and run along the pole, a
half-hitch being tied at the point. When all were across, and the
rope brought over by the boat, all hands would pull the buggy
across. It would, of course, soon disappear beneath the water,
and at each disappearance I wondered if I should see it again.
Had the pole caught in a stump, the probability was that it or
the rope would break. However, we got it safely across the
channels, which varied in depth up to 25 feet of water. It was
quite dark when we reached the station, all tired out. The black
boys behaved<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a>
splendidly, so I gave them the "pituri" intended for Mr. Bailey.
This gift they prized far more than money or tobacco. The next
evening I held a meeting at the station, and resumed my journey
up the river the day following. Travelling was now easy, the road
being good, with plenty of grass and water for my horses. Meeting
one's constituents in a western electorate is not a short,
pleasant picnic.</p>
<p>A rather serious crisis arose during the early part of this
session (1890). McIlwraith introduced a measure to levy a tax on
all wool exported over the border to New South Wales and South
Australia.</p>
<p>The intention of the bill was to divert the trade of southern
and south-western Queensland to the Queensland Railways. The
pastoralists of those districts obtained supplies, and sent their
wool from and to the southern Colonies, where the rates were
lower than those charged over the Queensland lines.</p>
<p>McIlwraith's argument was that Queensland was heavily taxed
for the construction and maintenance of these lines; that this
Colony was also incurring excessive expenditure for
administrative purposes, and if the pastoralists would not give
Queensland the necessary revenue towards these services, it
should be forced from them.</p>
<p>The bill provoked heated arguments from McIlwraith's
supporters. The Opposition looked on with some interest,
anticipating a Government defeat. The bill passed its second
reading by the casting vote of the Speaker. I voted with the
Government. McIlwraith promptly tendered his resignation, but was
induced by Sir Henry Norman, the then Governor, to reconsider
this. McIlwraith said he would reintroduce the bill in committee,
and make the recalcitrant members swallow it. He did reintroduce
it, those previously against it voted for it, and it was carried
by a majority. Those <a name="Page_127" id=
"Page_127">[127]</a>members who were compelled to stultify
themselves did not forgive the Premier, and showed their
resentment when the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>The money collected by the tax was utilised in improving the
main roads to the railway, and when I was in that district some
years afterwards I saw these cleared two chains wide through the
affected districts.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></p>
<p>In 1889, the Morehead Government had put on the Estimates
&pound;1,000,000 for unspecified railways. This the Opposition,
led by Sir Samuel Griffith, strongly opposed. The sitting
developed into a stonewall of 96 hours' duration. The Government
withdrew the item at 10 p.m. on a Saturday night. Previous to its
introduction, I had paired for the session with an Opposition
member, as I was anxious to return home to review my business
operations, and did not suspect any party measures.</p>
<p>At the opening of the 1890 session, I caught a very severe
cold in Brisbane, which developed into "La Grippe," and I was
confined to my room for seven weeks. During this time the
Morehead Government introduced a "Property Tax," which met with
strong opposition from McIlwraith&mdash;who was still in the
Cabinet&mdash;and his supporters, of which I was one. Morehead
carried his proposals by two. He felt that this majority did not
justify his continuing in office, so he retired. The coalition
between Griffith and McIlwraith followed. Both knights offered me
a position in the Cabinet as Honorary Minister, but as I was to
be considered as a Central member, I declined the honour. The
House adjourned for two months. I decided to visit my electorate
to inform my constituents of the position, and at a meeting in
Winton they endorsed my action. I returned to Brisbane overland
by coach, <i>via</i> Barcaldine, thence rail to Jericho, and by
coach to Blackall, Tambo, Augathella and Charleville, and on to
Brisbane by rail. This route was in consequence of the maritime
strike, through which all steamers were laid up.</p>

<br>
<p><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a>At the close of the
1890 session, I made a trip to Melbourne, and made the
acquaintance of a gentleman who persuaded me to join him in a
trip to New Zealand. We called at Hobart <i>en route</i>, and
landed at the Bluff, proceeding to Invercargill by rail. By this
trip I renewed the acquaintance of bygone years with many old
friends from North Queensland, who had become residents of New
Zealand.</p>
<p>Before leaving the Dominion there were rumours of an intended
strike of shearers in Queensland. When I reached Sydney I found
this had eventuated, and as the House was in recess, I proposed
visiting my electorate, but was prevented doing so because of the
heavy floods stopping all traffic.</p>
<p>During the Parliamentary session of 1891, there were many
stormy scenes and debates in connection with the shearers'
strike, which took place throughout the pastoral districts of
Queensland and New South Wales. The causes for the strike and
incidents are of public history. It is, therefore, not necessary
for me to do more than to mention it.</p>
<p>After the coalition was formed, Sir Thomas McIlwraith
announced his policy of a ten years' extension of the "Polynesian
Act."</p>
<p>Sir Samuel Griffith, as Premier, foreshadowed this would be
brought forward in the session of 1892. I was returned as an
opponent of black labour, and thought it necessary to justify my
support of the new policy. To do so I obtained a letter of
introduction to Mr. Neame, the owner of Macknade, on the Herbert
River. I had some practical experience of what it was to work
among cane, but did not give any hint of what action I was going
to take in the House. Eventually, I informed my constituents of
my change of views, and put myself in their hands. From them I
received a free hand to act on my own judgment. I voted for the
extension, and <a name="bill" id="bill">the House passed the
bill</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a>1893 was the year of
the great bank smash when so many institutions went under, and
eventually had to undergo reconstruction. In this difficult time,
Sir Hugh Nelson as Treasurer showed himself as an able and
capable financier. He received help and sympathy from the banks
which weathered the storm, but from none more than the General
Manager of the institution which held considerable Government
moneys.</p>
<p>Retrenchment was the order of the day. Members salaries were
reduced to &pound;150 per annum. Lively and acrimonious
discussions continued during the <a name="sesssion" id=
"sesssion">session,</a> but Sir Hugh Nelson was firm in his
resolutions to restore confidence, and backed up by the majority
of the members, he soon allayed the panic.</p>
<p>A general election took place in this year, and I was again a
candidate. On arriving at Boulia, where I addressed a meeting, I
learnt that Mr. Wallace Nelson had been nominated by the Labour
Party to oppose me, but when I reached Winton after completion of
the tour, I found that I had been returned unopposed, Mr.
Nelson's nomination paper being informal. At the opening of the
session I was twitted by Labour members of having obtained the
seat by an informality.</p>
<p>In those days I was not altogether a hardened politician, and
felt somewhat sensitive on the charge. I returned to Winton,
called a meeting to consider whether I should resign and contest
another election, or retain my position. The meeting, which was a
large one and representative, decided that I should retain the
seat. I must say that after taking this course, my opponents made
but little allusion to the way in which I had been elected, and
then only in a joking, friendly manner. The Government of which
Sir Hugh Nelson was now Acting Premier&mdash;McIlwraith having
gone on a health tour&mdash;submitted its railway proposals to a
private meeting of its supporters. Very much to my
dissatisfaction I found that the Hughenden-Winton line was not
included.</p>
<p><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a>I will explain here
that during the previous session I was invited by Sir Thomas
McIlwraith to call at his office. He then explained to me what
was in his mind in regard to railways in the west. This was an
extension north-westerly from Charleville towards Barcaldine;
from Longreach and Hughenden to Winton; from Hughenden to
Cloncurry; from Winton to Boulia <i>via</i> Llanrheidol; and from
Winton in a north-westerly direction towards Cloncurry and the
Gulf, keeping to the higher country, but as low down the rivers
flowing into the latter as would be safe. The mineral country
which caused the present line to run in a south-westerly
direction from Cloncurry was then unknown.</p>
<p>The terminus on the Gulf was to be on its western side, if
possible in Queensland territory, but if necessary he might
negotiate with South Australia for a port in the Northern
Territory, from which, if advisable, that Colony might join up
with Port Darwin. Such a scheme, Sir Thomas said, would bring the
three principal ports, Brisbane, Rockhampton and Townsville, in
touch with their western back country, which would also have its
choice of ports. Queensland would become connected through its
Gulf outlet with the Eastern countries; have a more direct route
to Europe, and be practically independent of Sydney and
Melbourne. He added that whether the scheme would eventuate or
not, it was his intention to have a line from Hughenden to
Winton, so as to bring the district within reach of its natural
port&mdash;Townsville, instead of being forced to Rockhampton. He
presumed he could count on my support, which I promised. I
submitted the information as being strictly confidential to
Fraser, of Manuka, who, as chairman of my supporting committee,
would at his discretion disclose the matter to such as he might
consider reliable. When I saw Nelson after the meeting, he
disclaimed all knowledge of McIlwraith's promise as regards the
Winton line, and looking at a map from Townsville out, said the
line would be nothing but a "dog-leg business." I explained to
him that, acting on the<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a>
information given by McIlwraith, and with his knowledge, I had
told my committee, who had built their hopes upon his promise,
and informed Nelson I felt so strongly on the point, that as I
could not personally oppose the Government policy on any other
matters, I would resign my seat. I explained the position to
Fraser, who consulted my supporting committee. It was decided
that as the promise given to me by McIlwraith, who was still
Premier, as regards the Hughenden-Winton line was not kept, and
as they could not ask me to sit opposed to the Government, they
considered there was nothing for me but to retire from the House
altogether. I submitted the letter to Nelson, who then laughed,
and said he had gone into the whole question, and found that
McIlwraith had pledged himself. It appeared that Byrnes was in
his confidence, and "looking at it again," Nelson said, "it is a
good policy in western interests, but what a howl there will be
in Rockhampton." Finally, when the railway policy was made
public, it was found that the first section of a line towards
Winton was proposed.</p>
<p>I do not think that any railway proposal received such a
searching criticism from its opponents. It was very amusing to
see an immense map of Queensland hung in the chamber, and one of
the Central members with a long pointer showing the boundaries of
the several districts, and how Rockhampton rights would be
encroached upon. However, in spite of all, the line eventually
reached Winton, but that was the only part of McIlwraith's scheme
which became finalised, which I think is a matter to be
regretted.</p>
<p>In later years a scheme was adopted which put Sydney as near
to the Gulf Territory of Queensland as Brisbane, and which, if
carried out, will make the first-mentioned the Port of Western
Queensland. The construction of the lines under Denham's and
Kidston's schemes, is, however, making such slow progress that
there is a hopeful probability that they will never be
completed.</p>
<p><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a>The Parliamentary
session of 1894 was, I think, the most exciting in happenings and
bitter in feelings than any I experienced during my time in the
House. This state of affairs arose out of the shearers' strike,
which existed in the Mitchell, Gregory and Flinders districts. So
serious was the position of affairs in those districts that the
Ministry felt it was absolutely necessary to introduce such
exceptional legislation as would give far-reaching powers to the
Government and its officers for the preservation of peace.
Considerable damage had happened to the property of pastoralists
in those districts by fire. In one or two places firearms were
used.</p>
<p>When Nelson asked for the formal leave to introduce the bill,
Mr. Glassey, who was leader of the Labour Party, bitterly opposed
the request. The time and circumstances were very serious, but it
was highly amusing to see the expression of surprise which came
over Nelson's face as he questioned the sincerity of any man who
opposed the introduction of a Bill for the Preservation of Peace.
The scope of the bill was generally known to members, and the
Opposition by Glassey at this stage, and the surprise by Nelson
were the usual Parliamentary camouflage.</p>
<p>During the passage of the bill through the Assembly, both in
the House and Committee, it was very difficult to control the
members on either side. There were many suspensions of members on
the Labour side, who were, of course, out to oppose the measure.
The stormy passage of this bill, which, when it became law, did
Preserve Peace, may be read in <i>Hansard</i> of the time.</p>
<p>The Government in 1895 organised a Parliamentary tour of North
Queensland to enable many members to see for the first time that
country for which they assumed they were competent to legislate.
The tour was very successfully carried out, and those who were
strangers to the North, realised that they knew only a small
corner of Queensland, which, compared with what<a name="Page_134"
id="Page_134">[134]</a> they were visiting, was of comparatively
less value. Amongst the 37 requests made to Mr. Tozer (who was
Home Secretary) at Cooktown, was one to erect a statue to Captain
Cook. It was pointed out a monument had been erected to him, but
owing to low finances the scheme was uncompleted. It was thought
Captain Cook deserved a monument at Cooktown; but Mr. Tozer, in
reply, stated that he realised that Cooktown deserved some
recognition of the historical fact that Captain Cook's only
lengthy stay in Australia was in the locality, but, he explained,
"The position is this: down in Brisbane we have deputations of
unemployed asking us for bread; now I have come up here, and you
have asked me for a stone." This reply settled the question.</p>
<p>Returning to Townsville and Bowen, the party visited Cid
Harbour, in Whitsunday Passage. At this place there was a camp of
timber-getters. There were two families of women and children who
had not tasted meat since Christmas. It was now April. Two sheep
were given from the ship, and in return we borrowed their fishing
net, with which we caught a beautiful lot of parrot fish.
Weighing anchor at mid-day, Captain South took us through the
Molle passage, where, sounding the whistle, one could hear the
echo reverberating amongst the islands for some minutes
afterwards. It is considered that although Cid Harbour has not
the extent of Sydney Harbour, it is quite its equal in
beauty.</p>
<p>During the session, the plans and specifications of a line of
railway from Hughenden towards Winton were laid on the table of
the House. This gave rise to a bitter discussion dealing with
interests of Rockhampton and Townsville, which were in conflict.
Those of the western country and residents were not considered.
Nelson consented to the request of Mr. Archer, member for
Rockhampton, for a select committee, to take evidence as to the
desirableness of constructing the line. The Central members on
the committee were Mr. Archer, chairman; Messrs. Murray and
Callan, MM.L.A. This committee was the<a name="Page_135" id=
"Page_135">[135]</a> first to take evidence on a railway proposed
in the Assembly, and formed a precedent afterwards availed of.
The committee sat for a week, and in the evidence adduced the
majority report to the House was in favour of the line.</p>
<p>The Central members, who sent in a minority report, stated
that the Winton district belonged to Rockhampton, and asserted
that the settled policy of the country was that the lines should
be extended due west from the coastal ports. They were apparently
oblivious to the fact that the coast line north from Brisbane
trended in a north-westerly direction, and owing to this trend
Winton was 185 miles nearer Townsville than Rockhampton. The
Minister for Railways accepted the majority report, proposed the
building of this section, and then followed an acrimonious
debate, which resulted in an all-night sitting. I acted as Whip
during the night, and allowed my supporters to camp in the
Legislative Council Chambers, whence as they were required for a
division, I brought them in, to the amazement of our opponents,
who thought they had left and gone home.</p>
<p>The proposal was carried at 7.30 the following morning.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></p>
<p>At the end of this year I returned to Winton to prepare for
the elections to be held in May, 1896. I addressed a meeting at
that town, and received a vote of confidence. I commenced a tour
of the district. The season was very dry, and I had to send feed
for my horses by Cobb's coach to Boulia. I went over some of the
same ground as in 1890, and when travelling between Boulia and
Springvale I saw the tracks made by my buggy in the wet of that
year. This shows the scarcity of travellers in that country. At
the election I was in a minority by three votes in Winton, but
the outside places returned me with a substantial majority.
Labour gained a few more seats at this election, and the
verbosity one had to listen to made an M.L.A.'s life, like a
policeman's, not a happy one.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the session the Minister for Railways laid
the plans and specifications of another section of the Hughenden
to Winton railway on the table of the House. Messrs. Kidston and
Curtis, MM.L.A., led the Central members in strong opposition to
the proposal, but after a short debate it was carried. This
section when completed brought the line from Watten to Manuka,
or, as the station is now called, "Corfield."</p>
<p>The second sections of the railway from Hughenden to Winton
were constructed by the late Mr. G. C. Willcocks, and in a record
time. He had to carry ballast and water along the whole
construction of 132 miles from the Flinders River at Hughenden.
His system was to plough and scoop the bed for the permanent way.
This being done, a temporary line was laid down alongside, upon
which trucks were run to carry on the advance work, leaving
permanent work to follow up. <a name="Page_137" id=
"Page_137">[137]</a>As a consequence he was two months ahead of
his time, and the line being available to carry traffic on the
unopened portion, the Government decided to give him a bonus to
hand the line over. Compared with present-day railway
construction, as regards expense in time and in money, the Winton
line is a monument to Mr. Willcock's ability and energy as a
contractor, and to the relative merits of contract and day
labour.</p>
<p>In 1896, Sir Hugh Nelson had been appointed President of the
Legislative Council, and appeared in his Windsor uniform at the
opening of Parliament this year. Mr. W. H. Brown, the leader of
the Labour Party, who was sitting next to me in the Council
Chamber, in a whisper loud enough to be heard around,
remarked:&mdash;"I am just thinking how many ounces to the dish
Sir Hugh Nelson would pan out if he were boiled down." Sir Hugh
gave dignity to his new position, which was the reward of years
of distinguished loyal and successful service to Queensland.</p>
<p>The Hon. T. J. Byrnes was now appointed to succeed Sir Hugh
Nelson as Premier, and shortly afterwards visited England. Mr.
Byrnes' career and successes were well known in that country, and
these, aided by a frank, charming manner, made his tour one of
triumph. It was a blow to Queensland that he did not long survive
his return to the State. Although Byrnes was not in Parliament
when Macrossan was alive, yet those who remembered the latter
could not help comparing the two men. I do not recollect having
seen Macrossan smile even after a successful speech. On the other
hand, beyond a passing frown scarcely perceptible, even in the
bitterness of debate, I have not seen Byrnes otherwise than
smiling, but when one sat close to either and saw their eyes
flashing fire, one could realise the strength and sincerity of
both.</p>
<p>It is possible that had Byrnes lived to take the field against
Federation, as it was thought he would, Queensland might
not<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a> have become one of
the States, except under certain saving conditions. I was present
at the funeral ceremony in St. Stephen's Cathedral, and saw many
hardened politicians brushing tears off. It was felt that a great
man and a good man had passed away.</p>
<p>Mr. W. H. Browne, more familiarly known as "Billy" Browne, was
a lovable character. Firm in his belief that his principles were
right and should be maintained, but without being bitter to those
who might differ from him. His death was no doubt a temporary
loss to the Labour Party, of which Queensland could easily spare
others more bigoted, but less sincere.</p>
<p>Sir Samuel Griffith, after giving the best years of his life
to Queensland, had now retired to the Supreme Court Bench, and
his absence was a loss to Parliament.</p>
<p>Most members judged Griffith as being cold and distant, but
personally, I have much to thank him for. I found him kind and
sociable when approached, and at no time did he assume a
patronising manner when doing a favour. Those who knew him
intimately told me they found him to be the same. Looking at him
from the opposite side, he seemed to be always on the alert to
find his opponent tripping. I have known him, when he did so, to
generously aid in putting them right, and apparently because he
felt it to be his duty to do so. He was different to his great
opponent McIlwraith, both in character and mental construction.
McIlwraith was by nature impatient and irritable. Griffith, on
the contrary, was very patient, and maintained a great control of
his temper. This enabled him to frequently have his views adopted
when they might not be, if too strongly forced. Had advantage
been taken of opportunities, Griffith might have been a wealthy
man. But to his honour, and to that of Queensland Parliaments,
from the first even to the present, this State has been
singularly free from what has been brought to light in other
States.</p>
<p><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a>The artesian bore at
Winton was now completed by the Intercolonial Deep Boring
Company. The bore has a depth of 4,010 feet, and a flow of
720,000 gallons of water per day, <a name="he" id="he">the</a>
temperature being 182 degs. Fahrenheit. It had many vicissitudes
during its eight years' sinking. Two other companies went into
liquidation in carrying out the work.</p>
<p>In 1898, I induced the Government to grant a loan of
&pound;2,500 to reticulate the town with water from the bore. As
far as I can remember this session was uneventful in a political
sense.</p>
<p>The bad health of my partner, Mr. Campbell, made it necessary
that I should return to active business. I informed my
constituents that at the end of this session, which would be the
last of that Parliament, I intended to retire from politics.</p>
<p>Following Mr. Campbell's death, Mr. T. J. O'Rourke became my
partner, and is so still.</p>
<p>I feel it would be out of place to express my personal opinion
of Mr. O'Rourke. It is enough to say that he who can stand up
against the criticisms, and hold the goodwill of western men of
all sorts and conditions, needs no expression of opinion or
feeling from me.</p>
<p>Although the Bush Brotherhood was founded by the Church of
England at a period later than that at which I decided should end
these reminiscences, it may not be out of place to allude to the
good work of the Brethren, and the success of their endeavours to
promote the spiritual and oftentimes the material welfare of the
west. The members lived a life of hardship and self-abnegation,
which was appreciated by people of all and of no religious
beliefs.</p>
<p>One of its most notable members was the Reverend
Hulton-Sams&mdash;known as the Fighting Parson&mdash;and who was
the winner of many friendly fights. He travelled the west
visiting<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a> stations and
shearing sheds with his Bible and prayer-book on one handle of
his bike, and a set of boxing gloves on the other, and after
preaching an impressive extempore sermon, concluding the service,
would invariably say, "Now, boys, we will have a little
recreation!" and invite his hearers to put on the gloves. He was
not always the winner, however. His manly virtues, the sincerity
of his life, and the beauty of his character, made him one of the
best loved amongst western men. On his return to England, after
the war broke out, he enlisted, and received a commission as a
Lieutenant in the "Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry." He went
with his regiment to France, and was instantaneously killed by a
shell when seeking water for his wounded comrades. He died, as he
lived, a Christian hero, and nothing better can be said of any
man.</p>
<p>The following account of his death, received by his sister,
Lady Wiseman, was published in the London <i>Evening
News</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p>The Adjutant of a battalion of the D.C.L.I., said:&mdash;"He
died a glorious death&mdash;that of a British officer and
gentleman, commanding a company in an important position, and
sticking it where many others might have failed. We were hanging
on to the edge of a wood, and the Germans were trying to shell us
out of it. That night the Germans attacked us again&mdash;bombs
and liquid fire. C. Company stuck to it, and through all the
terrific shelling they never flinched, although they lost
heavily.</p>
<p>"They were there at 10 a.m., and I crawled to and talked to
your brother several times. He was magnificent and very cheerful.
His last words to me were, 'Well, old boy, this is a bit thick,
but we'll see it through, never fear.' His company sergeant-major
told me that at about 10 a.m. your brother crawled away to see if
he could get any water for the men, many of whom were wounded and
very thirsty.</p>
<p>"He was hit by a piece of shell in the thigh and side, and
killed instantly. He died doing a thing which makes us
feel<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a> proud to have
known him. He was a fine officer, a fine friend, and was
worshipped by his men."</p>
<p>I was but one of a large number of members who, during 1888,
entered the House for the first time. To one who had not had the
inclination, even if one had the time, previous to this, for
politics, everything in and around the House was novel and
interesting, but it was difficult to understand why members
should in the Chamber be so bitterly hostile to each other and
yet as friendly outside. There were, of course, exceptions as
regards the latter, but I soon learned that a good deal of what
was being said and done was more or less theatrical. Sincerity
was to a great extent at a discount, and later years of
experience in politics confirmed my impressions that the whole
was a game to induce the people to think that their friend was
Codlin, and not Short. And the farce is continued to the present
time, only more so, and with the same success.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the end of my Parliamentary life might be
the end of my reminiscences. The opening of railway communication
with Winton brought new conditions into our lives. The days of
pioneering, bullock-driving, the trips by Cobb and Co., which
were not always trips of comfort or of pleasure, were things of
the past. In place of the crack of the whip and the rumble of the
coach were heard the whistle and snorting of the engine. We were
now within civilisation, so far as convenience might go, but
whether we were morally and socially better or worse is a very
open question. The great distances, the open plains, and the
loneliness and monotony which is generally characteristic of the
western country, even in these days of comparative closer
settlement, have formed the western character. It is a character
hard, shrewd, and impatient in good times, but strangely patient
and resourceful in times of floods, drought, or difficulty.
Invariably maintaining a certain reserve, yet hospitable and
generous towards strangers, and ready to give help without
question where needed,<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a>
the western-born man and woman carries a dignity and presence
easily recognised, and a friend who visited the west after many
years, remarks:&mdash;"I say, you have a grand stamp of man and
woman growing up in the west, but you are not giving them
encouragement to live in and develop their country as you should
do."</p>
<p>The man of the west deserves much praise, but what might be
said of its women. I have seen these following the waggon, or
living in domiciles which, even at best, would be a shame to
cities. Yet very rarely otherwise than patient, cheerful and
hospitable, loving help-mates and mothers. "God bless them," I
say.</p>
<p>I cannot help thinking that politics are the bane of the west.
It is singularly free from religious rancour or animosity. The
religious belief of the other man, or if he has any at all,
concerns no one. So long as a clergyman does not hold that
playing cricket or football on Sunday is wrong, even if he is not
popular, he is at all times respected.</p>
<p>I remember a Roman Catholic priest (Father Fagan) speaking at
a dinner of welcome, remark:&mdash;"A brother minister had asked
him what good these social gatherings did?" He
replied:&mdash;"They did a great deal of good, and he went so far
as to say that one such gathering was worth twenty sermons. They
were simply putting in practice the virtues preached from the
pulpit of hospitality, charity and gratitude."</p>
<p>It is my sincere hope that such kindliness and charity might
continue to the end of time.</p>
<br>
<p>"FAREWELL."</p>

<h1>WATER DIVINING:</h1>
<h2>A POSTSCRIPT.</h2>
<p><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></p>
<p>"There are more things in Heaven and earth than are dreamt of
in our philosophy." Thus wrote Shakespeare, and as the centuries
roll by, and the marvels of invention and scientific research are
unfolded, this truth of the immortal bard becomes the more and
more evident to thinking people of all nations.</p>
<p>The faculty or attributes of water divining&mdash;that is,
ability to locate water running in natural channels beneath the
surface&mdash;is one which of late years has received great
attention in Queensland.</p>
<p>In this material and matter-of-fact age it is difficult to
place belief in anything savouring of the occult&mdash;anything
which cannot be explained by recognised natural laws, or which is
not readily understood.</p>
<p>For this reason, and notwithstanding indisputable evidence of
the genuineness of the claims put forward by water diviners, many
people regard them all as a huge joke, and laugh outright at the
credulity of their patrons. Certainly it is true that the faculty
is claimed by many, but possessed by few. After all, however
mystifying it may be to the ordinary mind, hard facts cannot be
ignored, and proof positive has repeatedly been adduced of the
good work done by men possessing this marvellous faculty.</p>
<p><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a>In Queensland alone,
many western landholders&mdash;shrewd, hard-headed, business
men&mdash;have reason to be thankful that they secured the
services of a genuine and expert diviner, whose "magic wand"
quickly disclosed the whereabouts of sub-artesian water. Thus, it
has happened as a result of the diviner's visit that a bore is
driven, and presently by means of a wind-mill, or oil pump, a
sparkling stream is brought from the vast caverns which have held
it prisoner, turning the oft-times dreary waste into a smiling,
life-giving oasis.</p>
<p>In my opinion, what constitutes the faculty of divination is
an inherent quality that cannot be acquired. Some people describe
it as a sixth sense, while Dr. Grasset, a French authority,
believes that the ability to find underground streams proves the
existence of a faculty belonging to a class of psychological
feelings forming what he calls "psychisme inferieur," the study
of which is just beginning to attract the attention of the
scientific world.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should explain that, as a rule, a forked twig, the
extremities of which are held loosely in each hand, is used to
locate sub-artesian water, and in this connection its movements,
so far as is known, can only be affected by natural running
streams. The rod, or twig, does not work if carried over water
passing through drains, culverts, and such like. My explanation
of the movements of the rod is that they are caused by
electro-magnetism, the diviner being perhaps highly charged with
electricity. The water has absorbed the electricity of the
adjacent bodies in the earth, the currents coming to the surface
enters the air&mdash;ether&mdash;and the currents entering his
body, he being a non-conductor, agitates him. Most people are
conductors, consequently the current passes through them, and
they do not feel it. The electric twig in the hands of the
diviner forms a part of the connection between the body and the
water, and by a law of nature, these two bodies must either
attract or repel each other. If the experimenter is a person with
a <a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a>small amount of the
electric fluid in his nature, that is negatively charged, the
water being positive will draw down or attract the twig, hence
the downward movement. If on the other hand, he is surcharged
with electricity, or positive, the positive electricity of the
water will repel the other, and the twig will bend upwards. The
movements of the twig may thus be accounted for, but,
comparatively, so little is known or understood of the marvellous
influences and workings of electricity that it is impossible to
be dogmatic on the question.</p>

<br>
<p>The forks of the twig should be held lightly between the
second and third fingers of the hands, pressing the thumbs on the
side of the twig with just sufficient force to give the ends a
slightly-outward direction. If a person possesses the faculty,
and water flows anywhere beneath him, the twig will turn round on
its ends between his fingers. In my own case, should I hold the
twig tightly over a natural underground stream, it will bend
under and round in an endeavour to follow out the movement I have
just mentioned. It will, perhaps, be interesting to know that now
I only use the twig for the purpose of indicating the presence of
streams. The faculty is so sensitive in my hands that I can
detect water if I am 20 yards away. I have found by careful
observation and study that I can far more effectively decide upon
the actual bore site by the indications which my hands give.
Holding them downwards, open, and with the palms facing, I have
found that as I approach the strongest, and therefore the most
suitable, point in the stream for boring, they are thrust
forcibly apart and upwards by the same power, apparently, that
acts upon the twig. I found this out in a peculiar manner. After
marking a site with the twig, I happened to place my hands
together, and to my surprise they came up, and I could not keep
them together.</p>
<p>I must say it was only by accident that I discovered my
possession of this faculty. About 1906, a water diviner visited
the Winton district, and one day several friends and
myself<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a> went with him in
his quest for water. He explained his methods to the party, and
naturally we all provided ourselves with twigs.</p>
<p>After living so many years in the dry, western country, I was,
of course, very interested in the experiment, and closely
following directions was astonished after walking about for some
time to find my rod revolving slowly. Members of the party near
at hand were equally astonished, and called loudly to the others
to "come and look at Corfield's twig." They, thinking it was due
to the twig alone, soon ruined it, but I felt that I was
possessed of some power, which previously I did not know I
possessed, as I knew I was not turning the stick myself. For
about twelve months after that I closely studied every phase of
the phenomenon, and during that time I discovered good water for
many residents in the district.</p>
<p>In 1907, an opportunity came to me to employ my faculty for
the benefit of pastoralists and the State generally.</p>
<p>Mr. R. C. Ramsay, of Oondooroo Station, invited me to
ascertain if good water was obtainable in a dry belt of that
country, and in this I was entirely successful.</p>
<p>It is an interesting fact that I do not require to leave a
vehicle by which I may be travelling in order to carry out my
search for water. Whilst seated in a train, or motor car,
travelling at the rate of 30 or 40 miles an hour, I have by means
of the rod located streams. If it were not that the currents were
in the air, as I have previously referred to, I should be
insulated by the India-rubber tyres of the motor.</p>
<p>Reverting for the moment to the extent to which the faculty
may be exercised, a diviner is able to fix the breadth of these
streams, the position where their current is strongest, and to
give a fairly approximate estimate of what their supply may be.
Without doubt water can be found by an expert at great depths
from the surface (the greatest depth water was got in any of
my<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a> sites, that I know
of, is 950 feet at Sandy Creek, eight miles west of Birkhead,
where it flowed over the casing). If the water is stagnant the
divining rod is silent. I do not profess to be able to tell if it
is salt or fresh, although books on divining say this may be
ascertained by placing salt in the hands.</p>
<p>Before giving the particulars of my water sites, I would
explain that I was under the impression that I could not feel
water at a greater depth than 300 feet.</p>
<p>I was engaged by the Gregory Rabbit Board to mark a site on
very high country on Llanrheidol Station. I found a good stream
not far from one picked by another diviner, and I guaranteed that
water would be struck at 300 feet. A well was put down to that
depth, but no water obtained. On the strength of my guarantee the
sinking of the well was abandoned.</p>
<p>Later, I was engaged to mark sites on Vindex Station, and it
was mainly due to the perseverance of Mr. W. H. Keene, the
manager, that water was tapped over 300 feet. He sunk on one to
500 feet, the water rising to within 152 feet from the surface.
It was tested by being pumped for six hours, but the 20,000
gallons per day could not be reduced. Water was obtained at all
my sites on Vindex. These results proved that my 300 feet depth
was wrong.</p>
<p>I then contracted to test for water on the Nottingham blocks,
which are situated on very high downs country between Hughenden
and Winton, at the heads of the Landsborough, Flinders, and
Diamantina Rivers. My previous experience led me to believe that
about 600 feet was my limit, and bores were put down to over that
depth and abandoned without water. Eventually the owners selected
a site, and put down an artesian bore, striking a flow at about
2,000 feet. I felt sorry they did not sink on one of my sites to
prove exactly how deep I could feel underground water.</p>
<p><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a>Another failure was
at Vuna selection. The site was on a continuation of the high
downs adjoining the Nottingham blocks. The bore was put down over
500 feet at a spot which another diviner had endorsed as being a
good site. This and another one were also abandoned without
water.</p>
<p>At Glendower, near Prairie, on the Hughenden railway line, I
selected a site guaranteeing water if there would be at 300 feet,
near a site which had been put down 700 feet without water. The
latter had been marked haphazard, and I could not detect any
indication of a stream. My site at 300 feet was also a failure.
At this depth the bore was abandoned.</p>
<p>A controversy was started in Charters Towers over a paragraph
in the <i>Northern Miner</i>, as follows:&mdash;"The Dalrymple
Shire Council's well on Victoria Downs road, at the <i>head</i>
of the 10-mile creek, on the spot picked by Mr. George
O'Sullivan, was sunk to a depth of 38 feet, and at that depth
water became so heavy that sinking conditions had to be
discontinued. The water rises to within 18 feet of the surface.
This site was stated to be barren of water by Mr. Corfield." The
above requires an explanation from me, which I now give.</p>
<p>I was camped at Bletchington Park, where I had been marking
sites for Messrs. Symes Brothers, who had just completed one I
had previously marked within 100 yards of their homestead. They
struck a supply of 15,000 gallons per day, at a depth of 70 feet.
In the morning it was arranged that Mr. J. Symes should drive me
into Charters Towers, and when on the road, asked me if I would
mind looking at Sullivan's site at the 10-mile creek. He said he
did not know exactly where it was situated. When we reached the
creek we saw some trees stripped of bark close to the crossing
indicating the spot, as we thought, but I could find no sign of
water there. I did not go to the <i>head</i> of the creek, where
I afterwards learnt the site was. Hence the statement that I had
declared the site barren of water.</p>
<p><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a>I have previously
stated that water has been struck on my site in this country at a
depth of 950 feet, and I feel certain that in all these
instances, if boring had been continued, water would have been
struck at a payable depth.</p>
<p>I will now relate some of my experiences of the efficacy of
the divining rod.</p>
<p>It is my custom to use a compass to define the course of the
underground stream, which I leave on paper with the manager or
owner to show in which direction the stream is running.</p>
<p>I was engaged by Messrs. Philp, Forsyth and Munro to mark
sites for tube bores on their property at Thylungra Station.
After marking several sites on the station, when passing through
Brisbane later, on my way to Cowley Station on the same errand, I
interviewed Messrs. Philp and Forsyth, who told me there had been
a well sunk on my site and no water obtained, but that the
contractor had sunk a three-inch bore, where my peg was, and had
obtained good water for his camp use. I may state here that where
water is unobtainable close to the workings, this was a usual
occurrence. As the three partners were about to visit the
station, I asked them to discontinue working, and I would meet
them there at a certain date. This I did, and found in their
presence that the well had been put down two feet outside the
breadth of the stream in the opposite direction to which it was
running. I advocated a new well being sunk in the proper place,
but they preferred driving in the direction to which I had placed
the peg. Such action may prove a partial failure, as they might
not strike the strong stream. I have not heard the result of
their decision, but it is certain that my directions of the
course of the stream have not been followed. Either Sir Robert
Philp or Messrs. Forsyth or Munro could corroborate the above
statements.</p>
<p>The Dalrymple Shire Council obtained my services to inspect a
well which had been sunk at Oakey Creek, distant<a name=
"Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a> about 15 miles from Charters
Towers, which they told me would only water twelve horses and
then the supply gave out. I found the well was on the edge of a
strong stream, the outer edge of which ran through the centre of
the well, consequently the rod would not work at the outer edge
of the well. I marked the site for a new one about six yards
farther in. The members of the Council decided to put down a
circular cement well. They tapped the water under 40 feet and
obtained an inexhaustible supply. When I received the letter
enclosing my fee, it contained a vote of thanks from the
committee for the good work done. No better place could be chosen
for a demonstration of the efficacy of the divining rod.</p>
<p>Later, the Directors of the Carrington United Mine invited me
to visit their well at Lion's town, about 30 miles from Charters
Towers, which had become dry. I found this well was not on any
stream, but that a drive had been put in to drain the soakage
from a sandy creek, which was in close proximity, and the season
being a dry one, this had also failed to give any soakage. I
crossed this creek, and found a stream 13 yards wide, which I
marked. Being located on a flat, I had the idea that probably
there might be more water further over. My surmise was right, for
on investigation I found another stream 14 yards wide, but
running in the direction as if it would join the other. This
proved correct, the whole width of the two streams measuring 27
yards. I told the manager, who was present, I could get him a
good site at a spot most suitable to himself. The site was marked
in the centre of the 27 yards.</p>
<p>Miners were put on to work night and day, as about 100 men had
been thrown out of employment owing to the failure of the water
supply. Water was struck at 30 feet, which rose seven feet in the
shaft in ten minutes. The sinking was continued to 40 feet, the
water rising to within ten feet of the surface. When one
considers the well was six feet square, the supply can be
imagined.</p>
<p><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a>Unknown to the man
who was pumping the water to the mill, I later visited the site
and enquired if the water could be reduced in the shaft. He
replied:&mdash;"I have kept the pump going night and day, but
cannot lessen the supply." I then asked him if I might lift the
slabs which were covering the well. I did so with his permission,
and saw the water flowing in a steady stream across it. This
satisfied me as to the supply.</p>
<p>At Avon Downs Station, near Clermont, a large well had been
sunk near a creek, with a diminishing supply of water. On
investigation, I found the well had been sunk on the edge of an
underground stream. I advised a drive to be put in towards the
centre of the stream (which I marked). Mr. Sutherland (the
Inspector for the Australian Estates at that time) informed me
later that my advice had been carried out, and they had obtained
very satisfactory results.</p>
<p>At Gindie State Farm, I was accompanied by Mr. Hamlyn (the
Public Service Improvement Engineer) to mark sites for the
Department of Agriculture. Mr. Jarrott, the manager, took us to a
dry well sunk to a depth of 80 feet. I could not feel any
indication of water there, but a few hundred yards away, on
rising ground, I located two streams crossing each other, and by
the assistance of pegs, marked a site in the centre of the two
streams. Some months afterwards I met the manager in Emerald, who
said:&mdash;"Mr. Corfield, when you were marking that site at
Gindie State Farm, where the two streams crossed each other, the
engineer and myself were laughingly criticising your action, but
never more will I doubt your ability to find water." The
Secretary of Agriculture later informed me by letter that the top
stream only yielded a small supply, but the second stream, struck
at 165 feet, augmented the supply that it could not be lowered by
the pump more than 35 feet, and that the estimated yield of both
streams was 10,000 gallons per day.</p>
<p><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a>In 1907, I marked
several sites in the vicinity of Winton, and between then and
1911, I travelled by coach and train, but principally by buggy,
an approximate distance of 20,000 miles, marking sites at
different stations, ranging from Charleville in the south-west,
to Granada in the north-west, in the back blocks of this State,
besides locating water on several stations on and near the
eastern coast, and was successful in locating water to the
satisfaction of those interested.</p>
<p>On a site marked by me at Mayne Junction, the Railway
Department obtained water at a reasonable depth, but the water on
being analysed was found to be unfit for locomotives, or for
washing the carriages, consequently it was abandoned.</p>
<p>I also found a stream within two miles of Nundah railway
station, which, on a well being sunk, tapped the water at 30
feet. It rose 18 feet in the shaft. This water is supposed to be
of a highly medicinal character, beautifully soft and palatable
to drink.</p>
<p>I also marked a few sites in New South Wales, and some at
Birrallee Station, out from Bowen.</p>
<p>All this time I enjoyed perfect health, but in 1911 I began to
get very stiff in the legs, especially about the hips. Thinking
it was rheumatism, I went to the Innot hot springs, near
Herberton. These baths gave me no relief, so I went to Sydney to
consult Sir Alexander McCormack, who prescribed electrical
treatment and hot air. This I tried for four months without any
good results.</p>
<p>I then went to Rotorua, in New Zealand, consulting the doctor
there, who prescribed all the baths which are so efficacious in
removing rheumatism. The doctor, hearing of my having practised
water divining so long, diagnosed my case as neuritis, brought on
by constant use of my nerve energy in following that
profession.</p>
<p><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a>From this time I
desisted from my occupation, and only used my powers to give a
demonstration occasionally.</p>
<p>I have tried since the Muckadilla bore water on several
occasions, but could obtain no improvement.</p>
<p>An amusing incident occurred to me when marking sites on a
cattle station in the north-west of Queensland.</p>
<p>I was being driven in a buggy drawn by a spanking pair of
horses which the driver, who was the manager of the station,
could well handle.</p>
<p>The manager was a very smart young fellow, a splendid rider,
and in every way qualified to manage such a property, and bore a
high reputation for considering the interests of his employers
before anything else.</p>
<p>He was driving me through some ridgy country where the grass
in the gullies was very long and rank. I had located a good
stream of water, and was describing its direction by the aid of
the compass.</p>
<p>My companion asked if I could follow it, explaining there was
a flat half-a-mile farther on which would be a better place for
the site. I replied that I could do so, but asked him to drive
along the outer edge of the stream, so that I could detect if it
curved away on that side. We also zig-zagged inwards, so that I
might be certain it was still going in the right direction.</p>
<p>Presently we came to a gully, which was covered with grass,
and to all appearance very shallow. On reaching it the horses
jumped across it, pulling the front wheel of the buggy into a
deep hole. The back of the buggy, caused by the hind wheels
lifting, caught me between the shoulders. I turned a somersault,
and was thrown head first over the wheels, with my head on the
bank, and my legs hanging over the hole.<a name="Page_154" id=
"Page_154">[154]</a> Having the rod in both hands, I was unable
to break the fall. I yelled out, "For God's sake, keep the wheels
from going over my head." The sudden jerk had also sent the
driver over the splashboard, but like a good horseman, he
steadied himself with the reins and landed on his feet. I then
heard him say, "My God! I've killed him, and he hasn't marked the
site yet." Thinking of his employer's interest prevented him
giving me sympathy.</p>
<p>When I found I was not hurt, and that I could rise without his
assistance, I could not but enjoy the situation, although the
wheel went over the rim of my hat whilst it was on my head.</p>
<p>I eventually marked the site on the plain, but have not heard
the result of the boring.</p>
