<h2>The Project Gutenberg Library of Australiana</h2>

<h3>Australian writers, works about Australia and works which may
be of interest to Australians.</h3>

<p>This Australiana page boasts many ebooks by Australian writers,
or books about Australia. There is a diverse range; from the
journals of the land and sea explorers; to the early accounts of
white settlement in Australia; to the fiction of 'Banjo' Paterson,
Henry Lawson and many other Australian writers. The ebooks have been processed
into 'html' or 'text' format, which means that they can be read using an
internet browser, or converted to a format which can be read on an ebook reader
or mobile phone.</p>

<p>We also have a list of <a href="/links-to-Australiana-on-the-internet.html">books
about Australia on the internet, which have not been processed</a> and which we do not, therefore, include
on this page. These books are available from
the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and are in PDF format.</p>
<p>The following titles form part of the huge collection of ebooks
freely downloadable from Project Gutenberg Australia. Follow the
links to read more about the authors and titles and to read and/or
download the ebooks. Access other ebooks from our <a href=

successful crossing by Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth. Cox's
memoirs were not written by him and, in the Introduction to the
1979 edition, Edna Hickson, great-great grand daughter of William
Cox, states that it is likely that a granson of Cox was responsible
for the publication, if not the author. Hickson goes on to say
that:<br>
"The diary written in Chapter 9 has been transcribed from Cox's
original journal, now in the Mitchell Library (C708). This is the
most interesting section of the Memoir, and is the only part
written by William Cox himself. Some parts of the old road can
still be found, and it is possible to walk down the dreaded descent
from Mount York into the Hartley Valley."<br>

<p><i>Port Jackson, 14th November, 1788. I take the first
opportunity that has been given us to acquaint you with our
disconsolate situation in this solitary waste of the creation. Our
passage, you may have heard by the first ships, was tolerably
favourable; but the inconveniences since suffered for want of
shelter, bedding, &amp;c., are not to be imagined by any stranger.
However, we have now two streets, if four rows of the most
miserable huts you can possibly conceive of deserve that name.
Windows they have none, as from the Governor's house, &amp;c., now
nearly finished, no glass could be spared; so that lattices of
twigs are made by our people to supply their places. At the
extremity of the lines, where since our arrival the dead are
buried, there is a place called the church-yard; but we hear, as
soon as a sufficient quantity of bricks can be made, a church is to
be built, and named St. Philip, after the Governor. Notwithstanding
all our presents, the savages still continue to do us all the
injury they can, which makes the soldiers' duty very hard, and much
dissatisfaction among the officers.</i> [Extract from a letter from

traveller, drover or teamster lost his stock, Steve, after a long

"relative to the Government of His Majesty's settlements in Western
Australia on the western coast of New Holland." This was passed on
14 May [1829] (10 George IV c.22) and provided that the King, with
the advice of the Privy Council, might make, or might authorise any
person or persons resident in the colony to make, such laws and
ordinances as might be necessary for the peace, order, and good
government of His Majesty's subjects within the settlement; that
such laws, orders, etc., were to be laid before both Houses of
Parliament as soon as practicable thereafter; that no part of the
colonies of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land was to be
included in the new colony or settlements, and that the Act was to
continue in force until the end of 1834. This period of continuance
was extended by the various Acts from time to time until it was
formally repealed by the passage of 13-14 Victoria c.59, which
dealt with the government of the whole of the Australian
colonies.</td>

Australia, and after much discussion he and his elder brother
joined the stream of adventurers and sailed in 1852 for Victoria.
In this rough "school of mines" he acquired that insight into the
building-up of the earth's crust and that practical knowledge of
minerals which served him so well in after-life as a mining
engineer. But although the whole colony was in the grip of the
gold-fever, Belt retained the same quiet habits of observation
which had marked him at home--for there, as to whatever part of the
world his work subsequently called him, the engineer was always at
heart a naturalist. He proved an excellent observer, and a certain
speculative tendency led him to group his observations so as to
bring out their full theoretical bearing.</td>

only a cutlass in his hand, the others had muskets and bayonets. I
was hauled out of bed and forced on deck in my shirt, suffering
great pain from the tightness which with they had tied my hands. I
demanded the reason of such violence but received no other answer
than abuse for not holding my tongue. The master, the gunner, the

<p><span class="auto-style1">Ships</span> bound to the Australian

easy matter to ascertain the precise period fixed for their
departure; for such is the anxiety of the agents to secure
passengers, that they will not hesitate to state a positive time,
although well aware that the vessel may not sail for many weeks
afterwards. It is therefore advisable to withhold the passage money
until the vessel is in a state of forwardness for sea, which can
only be ascertained by a person going himself on board, and finding
out what portion of the cargo is shipped: if he cannot do so
personally, he should employ a friend to act for him. Without
taking this precaution, the emigrant may be detained in London, at
very great expense, and during a considerable time: indeed I know
of one instance in which a family were induced, through the
misrepresentations of an agent, to go from Aberdeen to London,
where, after having made their arrangements and paid their
passage-money, they were detained <i>three months</i>.</p>

over twenty-one when, between two voyages, he married Lily
Harrison, simply because she was a poor, pretty, homeless little
girl, who had to earn her living as a nondescript lady-help in hard
situations, and never had a holiday. He saw her in a Sandridge
boarding-house, slaving beyond her powers, and made up his mind
that she should rest. With sailor zeal and promptitude, he got the
consent of her father, who was glad to be rid of her out of the way
of a new wife; took the trembling, clinging child to the nearest

gallons. None could be spared for the horses now, none could be
spared for beef-boiling, only a little for bread, and a drop each
to drink. Every rock-hole we had seen--but one--was dry. Alexander
Spring would be dry. We should have to make for the Empress Spring,
fifty miles beyond. Every thing pointed to the probability of this
sequence of events, therefore the greatest care must be exercised.
The horses would die within a few miles, but the camels were still
staunch in spite of the weakening effect of the sand-ridges, so
there was no need for anxiety. Yet we could not help feeling
anxious; one's nerves get shaky from constant wear and tear, from
want of food and rest. We had been in infinitely worse positions
than this; in fact, with health and strength and fresh camels no
thought of danger would have been entertained, but it is a very
different matter after months of constant strain on body and mind.
Faith--that is the great thing, to possess--faith that all is for

conjecture, however, he was most agreeably disappointed, by finding
not only shelter for a boat, but a harbour capable of affording
security to a much larger fleet than would probably ever seek for
shelter or security in it. In one of the coves of this noble and
capacious harbour, equal if not superior to any yet known in the
world, it was determined to fix the settlement; and on the 23rd
[January, 1788], having examined it as fully as the time would
allow, the governor and his party left Port Jackson and its
friendly and peaceful inhabitants (for such he everywhere found
them), and returned to Botany Bay.</td>

and Yawl in order to attempt a landing, but the Pinnace took in the
Water so fast that she was obliged to be hoisted in again to stop
her leakes. At this time we saw several people a shore, 4 of whom
where carrying a small Boat or Canoe, which we imagin'd they were
going to put in to the Water in order to Come off to us; but in
this we were mistaken. Being now not above 2 Miles from the Shore
Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Tupia, and myself put off in the Yawl, and
pull'd in for the land to a place where we saw 4 or 5 of the
Natives, who took to the Woods as we approached the Shore; which
disappointed us in the expectation we had of getting a near View of
them, if not to speak to them. But our disappointment was
heightened when we found that we no where could effect a landing by
reason of the great Surf which beat everywhere upon the shore. We
saw haul'd up upon the beach 3 or 4 small Canoes, which to us
appeared not much unlike the Small ones of New Zeland. In the wood
were several Trees of the Palm kind, and no under wood; and this
was all we were able to observe from the boat, after which we
return'd to the Ship about 5 in the evening.* (* The place where
Cook attempted to land is near Bulli, a place where there is now
considerable export of coal. A large coal port, Wollongong, lies a
little to the southward.) At this time it fell Calm, and we were
not above a Mile and a half from the Shore, in 11 fathoms, and
within some breakers that lay to the Southward of us; but luckily a
light breeze came off from the Land, which carried us out of
danger, and with which we stood to the Northward. At daylight in
the morning we discover'd a Bay, ( Botany Bay.) which appeared to
be tollerably well shelter'd from all winds, into which I resolved
to go with the Ship, and with this View sent the Master in the
Pinnace to sound the Entrance, while we keept turning up with the
Ship, having the wind right out. At noon the Entrance bore
North-North-West, distance 1 Mile.</td>

obviously interesting story. Great things have happened, but they
have happened gradually, and without observation. There have been
no wars of conquest, for a handful of people were dowered with a
continent; no wars of defence, for the continent was protected by
the fleet of Nelson; no racial conflict, for the people were as
entirely British as the people of the British Isles. The great
battles of freedom had been already fought and won before Australia
came of age. The principles of Democracy and Liberty, of Colonial
Home Rule and Responsible Government, had been recognised as
essential principles of British civilisation. Australians had not
to fight; they had only to ask, and to argue. There were mistakes
and delays and friction; but in general, Australia got the full
privileges of British citizenship as soon as Australia was ready to
use them with advantage to herself. Our story has not been the
story of a people striving to be free. It has been the story of an
infant society gradually growing into the freedom that was
recognised to be its natural birthright.</td>

tree, out of which we dragged it: it is an animal as large as a
rabbit, but with the figure of a kangaroo. A few years since this
country abounded with wild animals; but now the emu is banished to
a long distance, and the kangaroo is become scarce; to both the
English greyhound has been highly destructive. It may be long

Manx had seen to that detail. Keene was a great traveller, and had
no relations, few friends, and a host of acquaintances. He
travelled widely. Acquaintances are rarely inquisitive. They ask
questions when met, some of their questions bordering on the
inquisitive; but with absence comes forgetfulness on their part.
Certainly, it was strange that, with Keene's re-appearance in
Melbourne social life, Oliver Manx made one of his frequent
absences from Sydney. Oliver Manx had found Thaddeus Keene useful.
Yet he was only one of quite a number of unattached Australians who
roamed their country, turning up at infrequent intervals in the
cities and towns they call &quot;home.&quot; None of them claimed
to have relations, friends, or intimates. They held only one
likeness. Whenever one of them appeared in public in any city, the
others, including Oliver Manx, were absent from their home towns,
on private and unobtrusive business. From: <i>&mdash;The Kahm

By-and-bye we both went back to the boat, and, on reaching Brood,
my companion told me that he had a beautiful long-sleeved plush
waistcoat that his mother had given him. He arranged that when we
got to Wolverhampton I was to take the waistcoat and try and sell
it so that with the money we might go to the play together at
Birmingham. I was told to say that the waistcoat was my own, and
was quite unaware that it had been stolen when I was waiting with
the horse at Pancridge. I went on my errand and, near the
courthouse, I saw a man whom I thought looked a likely purchaser. I
asked him if he would like to buy a waistcoat, assuring him that it
was my own property. He said, &quot;Oh yes, come in and let me have
a look at it.&quot; I went with him, when I found to my horror that
I was offering a stolen waistcoat to the constable of the place. He
told me that he was looking for someone of my sort as the coach
from Pancridge had brought notice of the robbery. Thus was I,
though innocent, again laid by the heels in Wolverhampton.</td>

St. Thomas's Hospital. I attempted at intervals to throw those
memories into a fictional form, and my friend Oliver Schreiner,
interested in my experiment, encouraged me to pursue it. This was
round about the year 1886, some eight years after leaving the real
Sparkes Creek, but while my memories of the life there were still
vivid and precise. The only critical judgment to which I submitted
the Idyll was that of my friend Arthur Symons who was pleased to
find it of the same class as Flaubert's _Contes_. But I put it
aside, making no attempt at publication. Apart from the fact that
it was far removed from the field of my choosen work in life, I
suspected that if the book ever wandered into the real Kanga Creek
it might give offence to people for whom I cherished only friendly
feelings.</td>

as yet the country itself was as desolate and inhospitable as ever.
. .In the course of our journey this morning, we met with many
holes in the sheets of limestone, which occasionally coated the
surface of the ground; in these holes the natives appeared to
procure an abundance of water after rains, but it was so long since
any had fallen, that all were dry and empty now. In one deep hole
only, did we find the least trace of moisture; this had at the
bottom of it, perhaps a couple of wine glasses full of mud and
water, and was most carefully blocked up from the birds with huge
stones: it had evidently been visited by natives, not an hour

fallen to the lot of Mr. Oxley, to indemnify him for his double

this adventure should have been reserved for him; for the master of
one of the vessels belonging to the colonial government had been to
Moreton Bay only a few months before Mr. Oxley, for the very
purpose of survey; and Captain Cook, as long ago as the year 1770,
suggested, that &quot;some on board having, in addition to a small
space where no land was visible, also observed that the sea looked
paler than usual, were of opinion that the bottom of Moreton Bay

body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more
southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain
descriptive of the geographical importance of this country, and of
its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and,
having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears
to be less objectionable than any other which could have been
selected. Had I permitted myself any innovation upon the original
term, it would have been to convert it into AUSTRALIA; as being
more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the
other great portions of the earth.

<p>After running near an hour in this critical manner, some high
breakers were distinguished ahead; and behind them there appeared
no shade of cliffs. It was necessary to determine, on the instant,
what was to be done, for our bark could not live ten minutes
longer. On coming to what appeared to be the extremity of the
breakers, the boat's head was brought to the wind in a favourable
moment, the mast and sail taken down, and the oars got out. Pulling
then towards the reef during the intervals of the heaviest seas, we
found it to terminate in a point; and in three minutes were in
smooth water under its lee. A white appearance, further back, kept
us a short time in suspense; but a nearer approach showed it to be
the beach of a well-sheltered cove, in which we anchored for the
rest of the night. So sudden a change, from extreme danger to
comparatively perfect safety, excited reflections which kept us
some time awake: we thought Providential Cove a well-adapted name
for this place; but by the natives, as we afterwards learned, it is
called Watta-Mowlee.</p></td>

high up upon the sides of Mount Lofty, watching with an annoyed and
frowning face four men who were climbing slowly up the slope

through his binoculars he could discern plainly the expressions
upon their faces. They looked alert and eager, as if they had some

thick-set men, and were all armed with stout sticks. They walked
spread out, fanwise, with about ten yards between them, and they
peered intently into all the bushes as they passed.</td>

pleasing and picturesque, as he advances up it to the town. A small
island with a house on it, named Garden Island, (which afterwards
became my residence) enriches the view. On the main is Walamoola,
so named by the natives, a rural situation, where Mr. Palmer, the
Commissary, has built a large and commodious house, and bestowed
much labour in cultivating the land round it. Such a house in so
young a Colony excites a degree of surprise in a new comer. The
town of Sydney is much larger and more respectable that can well be
imagined considering the time it has been built. The streets are by
order made broad and strait; each house is generally separated from
the adjoining ones, an excellent regulation in case of fire; few or
any are without gardens; and many of the houses are large and
commodious. When I landed I found that the heavy rain, which I had
experienced some days before, had been equally felt here. The
Hawkesbury River had been swelled almost instaneously to the great
annoyance of the Settlers on its banks. Various were the causes
assigned for the rapid increase of water; some supposed it owing to
the bursting of a cloud in the mountains, which hurried the water
down the level country; others to the overflowing of a lake or
morass, which augmented the currents of all the neighbouring
rivers, for that at Paramatta had also overflown its banks to a
very great height, as I afterwards was shewn by Dr. Thompson, now
the Resident Colonial Surgeon, as almost to be supposed
impossible.</td>

back, motored all around the bay, walked out upon the many wooded
capes that projected far out toward the sentinel Toll Gates,
patrolled the curved sandy beaches, and finally interviewed the
market fishermen. The result was that I broke camp at Bermagui and
chose a lovely site three miles out from Bateman Bay, where we
pitched camp anew. It turned out that the vision in my mind's eye
had been right. This camp was the most beautiful and satisfactory
of all the hundreds of camps I have had in different countries. How
it will turn out from a fishing standpoint remains to be seen. But

<p>Hamlet was an avid walker. In the early 20th Century he walked
twice from Bribane to Sydney and once from Sydney to Melbourne. He
wrote a number of newpaper articles about his trips and these are
gathered together in this ebook.</p>

<p>&quot;Don Dorrigo Carbonera makes a fine sonorous mouthful of a
name, which, if not exactly suggestive of &quot;Castles in
Spain,&quot; may nevertheless be here used in respect of the brave
toilers and workers up on the Dorrigo; for whatever their intended
careers may have been, they now at least appear to be, one and all,
veritable timber-cutters and charcoal-burners, every man wielding
his axe and firestick to some purpose. Nowhere else will you see
such a desolating display of blackened and half carbonised timber,
such gaunt hollow stumps, the more dead shells of the old-time
forest trees, their sombre ebony logs lying about all over the
newly fenced paddocks in obstructive confusion, all telling of the
settlers' dogged determination to clear the land at all
costs.&quot; (<i>Written on a walk from Brisbane to Sydney in

a strong belief in the existence of land beyond the southern ocean,
and this was greatly strengthened by the passage of that navigator
through the strait which bears his name, as it was naturally
imagined that the land to the south of the strait formed part of a
great continental mass. Whether or not the ancient and medieval
geographers had to any extent based their ideas on vague rumours of
Australia which may have reached the countries of southern Asia, is
a question which cannot be answered; but it has been held with some
show of reason that statements of Marco Polo, Varthema, and other
travellers, point to a knowledge that an extensive land did lie to
the south of the Malay Archipelago. It is an almost equally
difficult matter, and one which concerns our present subject more
nearly, to decide whether the indications of a continental land
immediately to the south of the Archipelago, to be found in maps of
the sixteenth century, were based at all on actual voyages of
European navigators.</td>

publication was "once more to throw the most decided and fullest

18th century, in a form that would appeal to foreigners no less
than to native readers. An act of homage to our ancestors,
therefore, a modest one certainly, but one inspired by the same
feeling which in 1892 led Italy and the Iberian Peninsula to
celebrate the memory of the discoverer of America, and in 1898
prompted the Portuguese to do homage to the navigator who first
showed the world the sea-route to India."</p>

very likely we should want to be dragged out soon. However, we
managed to get along, and only came to grief once. We went through
the bush to avoid the sea of mud in the main road, and one of the
leaders got frightened and turned off among the trees, dragging the
coach against some saplings and nearly upsetting it. The restive
horse was taken out of the harness, and the passengers got out
while the coach was backed out of the scrape.</td>

decided that Dick Shillito and the two Watsons should each ride, at
once, to neighbouring stations to bring aid. At one of the stations
two more policemen would be found, and as in the pursuit they
should probably pass near other stations, their numbers would swell
as they went. When this was settled, the party sat down to the

in establishing, should be written. To this end he collected a vast
number of documents from all available sources, and for many years
employed a secretary to set them in order, hoping some day to write
the History himself. But that day never came, and in 1879 Mr. Angas
passed away. Among his papers several were found that showed how
intensely keen his desire was that a full and comprehensive
History, giving the story of the rise and progress of the colony,
should be written. His son, the Hon. J.H. Angas, Member of the
Legislative Council of South Australia, determined that the wish
should be fulfilled, and kindly placed in my hands the whole of the
valuable and voluminous papers. Of this material I have availed
myself freely, and I have also drawn from Memoirs, Diaries,

<td width="63%">A few days after my arrival with the transports in
Port Jackson, I set off with a six oared boat and a small boat,
intending to make as good a survey of the harbour as circumstances
would admit: I took to my assistance Mr. Bradley, the first
lieutenant, Mr. Keltie, the master, and a young gentleman of the
quarter-deck. During the time we were employed on this service, we
had frequent meetings with different parties of the natives, whom
we found at this time very numerous; a circumstance which I confess
I was a little surprized to find, after what had been said of them
in the voyage of the Endeavour; for I think it is observed in the
account of that voyage, that at Botany-bay they had seen very few
of the natives, and that they appeared a very stupid race of
people, who were void of curiosity. We saw them in considerable
numbers, and they appeared to us to be a very lively and
inquisitive race; they are a straight, thin, but well made people,
rather small in their limbs, but very active; they examined with
the greatest attention, and expressed the utmost astonishment, at
the different covering we had on; for they certainly considered our
cloaths as so many different skins, and the hat as a part of the
head: they were pleased with such trifles as we had to give them,
and always appeared chearful and in good humour: they danced and
sung with us, and imitated our words and motions, as we did theirs.
They generally appeared armed with a lance, and a short stick which
assists in throwing it: this stick is about three feet long, is
flattened on one side, has a hook of wood at one end, and a flat
shell, let into a split in the stick at the other end, and fastened
with gum; upon the flat side of this stick the lance is laid, in
the upper end of which is a small hole, into which the point of the
hook of the throwing stick is fixed; this retains the lance on the
flat side of the stick; then poising the lance, thus fixed, in one
hand, with the fore-finger and thumb over it, to prevent its
falling off side-ways, at the same time holding fast the
throwing-stick, they discharge it with considerable force, and in a
very good direction, to the distance of about sixty or seventy
yards*. Their lances are in general about ten feet long: the shell
at one end of the throwing-stick is intended for sharpening the
point of the lance, and for various other uses. I have seen these
weapons frequently thrown, and think that a man upon his guard may
with much ease, either parry, or avoid them, although it must be
owned they fly with astonishing velocity.</td>

struggles in the dense scrub, Kennedy himself, who had pushed on

natives when almost in sight of Cape York; Jack barely managed to
make his way there through his enemies, and guided a party to the
rescue of the two starved and exhausted survivors of the
disease-stricken camp by the Sugarloaf Hill. It was barely time.
Another hour, and they too would have been killed by the crowd of

compression within the limits of an ordinary magazine contribution.
I was quite convinced of this when the central idea of the book
occurred to me--the possibility of a coloured invasion of
Australian territory, organized on such lines that the Australians
would be unable to persuade the heart of the Empire that there was
any invasion.</td>

the mast for about three years. In 1750 he was in the Baltic trade
on the Maria, owned by Mr. John Wilkinson of Whitby, and commanded
by Mr. Gaskin, a relative of the Walkers. The following year he was
in a Stockton ship, and in 1752 he was appointed mate of Messrs.
Walker's new vessel, the Friendship, on board of which he continued
for three years, and of which, on the authority of Mr. Samwell, the
surgeon of the Discovery on the third voyage, who paid a visit to
Whitby on his return and received his information from the Walkers,
he would have been given the command had he remained longer in the
mercantile marine. This was rapid promotion for a youth with
nothing to back him up but his own exertions and strict attention
to duty, and tends to prove that he had taken full advantage of the
opportunities that fell in his way, and had even then displayed a
power of acquiring knowledge of his profession beyond the

duty to be, in the words of Lord Stanley, to keep the Colonies
dependent upon the Mother Country; and occupied with this belief,
they have egislated for the Mother Country and not for the

Colonies down in the dust at the feet of the Parent State, and yet

one of the stock 'yarns' of the world, and reappears now and again
in magazines, books . . . and general conversation. As usually
told, the story runs thus: One Fisher, an Australian settler of
unknown date, dwelling not far from Sydney, disappeared. His
overseer, like himself an ex-convict, gave out that Fisher had
returned to England, leaving him as plenipotentiary. One evening a
neighbour (one Farley), returning from market, saw Fisher sitting
on the fence of his paddock, walked up to speak to him, and marked
him leave the fence and retreat into the field, where he was lost
to sight. The neighbour reported Fisher's return, and, as Fisher
could nowhere be found, made a deposition before magistrates. A
native tracker was taken to the fence where the pseudo Fisher sat,
discovered 'white man's blood' on it, detected 'white man's fat' on
the scum of a pool hard by, and, finally, found 'white man's body'
buried in a brake. The overseer was tried, condemned, and hanged
after confession.</td>

number of voyages that she made will perhaps never be accurately
known, but her logbooks in existence testify to the important
missions that she accomplished. The most notable are those which
record early discoveries in Victoria: the exploration of the
Queensland coast: the surveys of King Island and the Kent Group:
the visits to New Zealand and the founding of settlements at
Hobart, Port Dalrymple, and Melville Island. Seldom can the

fort is a huge gun, that covers the whole of the harbour. We were

enjoying life, and went to pass windward of the fort. The boat did
not seem inclined to lie up to it, and as it was of no consequence
whatever, we ran close under the lee. One of the boys, Watson by
name, lying on his back along one of the thwarts and looking up as
we passed close under the fort, noticed the projecting muzzle of
this huge gun. What a lark, he blurted out, to fire that gun some
night. Wouldn't it shake 'em up? I looked up, and as they say in
Yankeeland, fell for it. It was a proposition that appealed. So,
with each one sworn to secrecy, we set about what proved to be a
task that took over six weeks to accomplish, but it was worth it.
First, there was the powder to get, and, to avoid suspicion, it had
to be obtained in very small quantities. There was fuse to get
also, but before we committed ourselves very deeply, bearing in
mind our very limited exchequer, it behoved us to go off some night
and reconnoiter, and find out what sort of gun it was, and if it
could be fired. For this purpose we commandeered a scow from

The speaker is Mrs. Carrington, a dignified, elderly lady, who in
her youth must have been very beautiful, for even now, after the
ravages of time, her face bears strong traces of early loveliness.
Over her kind features one can easily discern the imprint of a deep

tall, beautiful girl, who is seated on a low stool by her side. The

fruit, the first (a Wallrothia) like a large yellow plum, mealy and
insipid; the second, the produce of a kind of mangrove (Candelia)

dispersed in search of shellfish on the mudflats and among the

previously been "Terra Australis incognita." The character of the
interior of that country still remained unknown, the largest
portion of earth as yet unexplored. For the mere exploration, the
colonists of New South Wales might not have been very anxious just
at that time, but when the object of acquiring geographical
knowledge could be combined with that of exploring a route towards
the nearest part of the Indian Ocean, westward of a dangerous
strait, it was easy to awaken the attention of the Australian
public to the importance of such an enterprise. A trade in horses
required to remount the Indian cavalry had commenced, and the
disadvantageous navigation of Torres Straits had been injurious to
it: that drawback was to be avoided by any overland route from
Sydney to the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria. <b>From Journal of

in the <i>Australian Dictionary of Biography</i> describes the book
as &quot;an attack on all whom he fancied had opposed him in the
colony. He also appeared before the select committee on
transportation; though much of his evidence was removed from the
report, enough remains to reveal his distorted mind. In 1840 Mudie
returned to Sydney [he had gone to London before publication of the
book], where he found himself no longer welcome, for his vindictive
comments had lost him old friends. John Kinchela, son of the judge
who had been maligned in the book, publicly horsewhipped Mudie in
Sydney, and, when Mudie sued him, the &pound;50 damages imposed on
Kinchela were promptly paid by a subscription in the court. In 1842
Mudie returned to London, where he lived until his death on 21 May
1852 at Tottenham.&quot;

as strange, eventful, and tragic a voyage as ever befell an English
ship. Her errand was to proceed to the island of Tahiti (or
Otaheite, as it was then called), in the Great South Sea, there to
collect a cargo of young breadfruit trees for transportation to the
West Indies, where, it was hoped, the trees would thrive and thus,
eventually, provide an abundance of cheap food for the negro slaves
of the English planters.<br>
The events of that voyage it is the purpose of this tale to unfold.
<i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i>, which opens the story, is concerned
with the voyage from England, the long Tahiti sojourn while the
cargo of young breadfruit trees was being assembled, the departure
of the homeward-bound ship, the mutiny, and the fate of those of
her company who later returned to Tahiti, where the greater part of
them were eventually seized by H. M. S. <i>Pandora</i> and taken
back to England, in irons, for trial.</td>

his efforts with those of his friend, and by the exertions of both,
was prepared the valuable zoological collection which we now
possess. More than one hundred thousand specimens of animals, large
and small, are contained in it; amongst which are several important
genera. There are also many more to be described, and the number of
new species, according to the report of the professors of the

to the amount of those discovered by COOK, in his second voyage; as

more new animals than all the naturalist voyagers of our

east-south-east at the distance of ten miles, which I called Van
Diemen's Land. The compass pointed right towards this land. The
weather being bad, I steered south and by east along the coast, to
the height of 44 degrees south, where the land runs away east, and
afterwards north-east and by north. In the latitude of 43 degrees

nevertheless, fresh, and before the heat of the day came on we
fortunately found an abundant supply of good water, in small pools
in the midst of thickets and scrub, where little expected. The rush
of the poor horses to it was so sudden and uncontrollable that they
were all in the midst of the pool in an instant; and two of them
carrying heavy loads were with difficulty unloaded and got out
again. By this time we had passed to the S. side of the range, and
found a continuation of the fresh pools in a water-course which
descended from its south-eastern slopes; there was, however, a
total absence of grass at this time, although there was reason to
believe some good grass had covered the hill-sides previous to the

standing only that close thicket and scrub we heartily wished had
shared the same fate.</td>

severe, over that portion of South Australia where Curriewildie
Station was situated; and what with the stock dying off in
thousands for want of food and water, and the damage done to fences
and such buildings as an outlying station boasts by bush fires, the
revenue returns sent in by the manager to the owner were not
exhilarating reading. She, poor old lady, was a resident in
England, and had been so during the ten years which had elapsed
since her husband, the original owner of the station, had died.
There had been some heavy amounts sent home before the drought set
in, and that, perhaps, was the reason why she took it into her head
that we who were employed on the property were robbing her. Any
way, that is what we thought, when one day, without a word of
warning, a young, fresh-faced Englishman arrived at the head
station with all the necessary documentary evidence to prove to
us--that is, Tom Smiles, the manager, and myself, the
overseer--that he had been sent out by Mrs. Halliday to take
immediate possession from us and send us about our business.<br>

<td width="63%">When I returned from the Nimrod Expedition on which
we had to turn back from our attempt to plant the British flag on
the South Pole, being beaten by stress of circumstances within
ninety-seven miles of our goal, my mind turned to the crossing of
the continent, for I was morally certain that either Amundsen or
Scott would reach the Pole on our own route or a parallel one.
After hearing of the Norwegian success I began to make preparations
to start a last great journey---so that the first crossing of the
last continent should be achieved by a British Expedition.<br>
We failed in this object, but the story of our attempt is the
subject for the following pages, and I think that though failure in
the actual accomplishment must be recorded, there are chapters in
this book of high adventure, strenuous days, lonely nights, unique
experiences, and, above all, records of unflinching determination,
supreme loyalty, and generous self-sacrifice on the part of my men
which...still will be of interest to readers who now turn
gladly...to read...the tale of the White Warfare of the South. The
struggles, the disappointments, and the endurance of this small
party of Britishers, hidden away for nearly two years in the

<td width="63%">The scene of the new beginning here studied was a
distant and at first despised part of the dowry of that fairest
mistress &quot;Trade&quot;, for whom Britain, Holland and France
long fought. It was peopled first by outcasts, rebels and
adventurers, stiffly governed for two generations by British
officials, and to this day is largely financed by the British
middle class. For a full century the little communities were
outworks of the industrial revolution in Britain. In clearing the
crowded gaols, in producing raw materials and food for the
city-dwellers of the old land, they played a role of increasing
importance in the grand speculation of industrialism--that
experiment on which the British people have staked their capital,
their mighty energy, their very life-blood. Australia emerged from
the degradation of convictism by taking the place for which Spain
had proved inadequate in the divided tasks of growing and
manufacturing wool, both formerly discharged by Britain herself.

of having gathered from the vast collection of State Papers
preserved in the Colonial and Admiralty offices in London most of
the missing records; and, for the first time, we read in his
volumes the true story of the first discovery and subsequent
exploration of this province, given in the exact words of the men
who did the work. But for some of these missing documents Mr.
Labilliere sought in vain; and the Journals of Grimes and Knopwood,
now published, are of that number. These fill up gaps in his

Geraldine took ship for the same destination. I can give no
biography of him, except to say that he had all the scoundrelly
qualities of the best type of Irishman. He set out with the notion
that Australia would provide none of the luxuries of life at all,
and equipped himself accordingly with a wife, a wooden house
numbered in parts, a great many hogsheads of claret, and several
tons of Irish earth, which served during the voyage as ballast, and
afterwards as a foundation for the wooden house and a protection
against snakes.<br>
He set up the wooden house facing Sydney Harbour on the pleasant
heights which overlook Rushcutter's Bay. Perhaps in that year
people still were cutting rushes there, or purses for a change when
any plutocrat was mad enough to take a stroll by its shores. It was
rustic, with the arid yet exotic charm of Australian scenes before
they become professional beauty-spots. The wooden house, too, was
rustic, and must have looked paltry among the stone palaces which
other pioneers had built with the help of convict labour, and which
were staffed with a nice assortment of forgers, poachers, and even
duellists who had been assigned as servants. From

There was, indeed, no need to hurry at the beginning. He was so

at the top of a big red gum tree, that from the ground he and his

rocked his big head and squawked all day, he had become a sprightly

and the Colo Rivers, by Governor A. Phillip and Captains Collins,
Johnston, Watkin, and Tench. These and others made several
successive visits to the Hawkesbury River, reaching as far as
Richmond Hill. In the year 1794 Lieut.-Governor Major Grose placed
the first twenty-two settlers along the banks of the Hawkesbury
River and South Creek, railed then Ruse's Creek, as James Ruse, the
man who first grew wheat at Parramatta, had a grant of land at the
junction of that stream with the Hawkesbury. The following year
many more families were settled, and as the natives were
troublesome, some troops from the N.S.W. Corps were sent up, and
the settlement of Windsor, then called Green Hills, was fairly
launched.</td>

least known, and became, towards the close of the year 1836, a

almost unanimous in believing that the deep bays known to indent a
large portion of this coast, received the waters of extensive
rivers, the discovery of which would not only open a route to the
interior, but afford facilities for colonizing a part of Australia,
so near our East Indian territories, as to render its occupation an
object of evident importance.<br>

conferred on it the name of Anthony Van Diemensland in honour of
the Honourable Governor-General, our illustrious master, who sent
us to make this discovery; the islands circumjacent, so far as

Well, Mr. Tompkins here sets before you some two or more scores of
interesting trips well within the reach of everybody. Here are
short and easily negotiable trips, occupying but a few hours, which
the author has verified from actual experience. The practice is
with him as well as myself, to construe the verb &quot;to go&quot;
into &quot;to go afoot. Given good health, a holiday, some few
modest coins of the realm, and a live companion, you will here find
entrance into Arcady, or the Cambewarra, which, I take it is
geographically the same; your midday meal is enjoyed in the open,
and a clean bed and plain fare at dusk in some quiet unpretentious
village inn; at break of day you start, and away you go with your
swag and your staff, &quot;While the winds up aloft whistle to a

Rugby, Association and Victorian--the first several hundred times,

most scientific, the most amusing both to players and onlookers,
and altogether the best; and I believe I may say that on this point
my opinion is worth having. Of course, men who are accustomed to
the English games, and have not played the Victorian, will hold it
ridiculous that the solution of the best game of football problem
should be found, as I believe it has been found, in Melbourne. But
I would ask them to remember that the Victorian game was founded by
rival public school men, who, finding that neither party was strong
enough to form a club of its own, devised it--of course not in its
present elaborate state--as a compromise between the two.</td>

Cunningham, as to the healthfulness and beauty of the climate, is
strictly true. There are scarcely any diseases but what result
immediately from intemperance. Dropsy, palsy, and the whole train
of nervous complaints, are common enough; but then, drunkenness is
the vice par excellence of the lower orders; and the better class
of settlers have not learned those habits of temperance which are
suited to the climate of Naples. The two classes often remind me of
English Squires and their grooms, as I used to see them at
Florence, just after the peace; the masters drinking at dinner,
because they were abroad, and after dinner because they were
Englishmen; the servants drinking always, because wine and brandy
were cheap. Perhaps a generation must pass away before the people
here will accommodate their habits to the climate, which is that of
Italy, without either malaria or the sirocco. From <i>A Letter from

and warm; in the summer very seldom overcast, or any haze

hoary with age, or torn with tempests.--In a word, the easy,

as governor of New South Wales, the government showed that English
opinion had changed regarding the qualifications required by the
man who was to administer and control the affairs of the distant
colony. Macquarie's predecessors had been naval officers. When
captain William Bligh had been appointed at a salary of
&pound;2,000 per annum, it had been recognised that the growth and
importance of the settlements made it necessary that an officer of
not less than flag rank should hold the position. The disastrous
result of placing a stern, outspoken naval post-captain in the
command of a colony where the military party was predominant had
been shown in the usurpation of Bligh's government. The appointment
of a military governor of equal rank was determined, and the final
selection was made of Macquarie. Instead of being accustomed to the
bluff manners of the quarter-deck, Macquarie was courteous and
politic. He had served on the staffs of the earls of Harrington and
Cavan, Sir Robert Abercromby, Sir David Baird, and General James
Stuart, and by experience had acquired the attributes necessary for
an executive officer to avoid friction and useless
controversies.</td>

audible, and looking up I saw in a corner of the high-arched roof a
horrible face watching me out of black narrow eyes. I confess that
I was very much startled at the apparition, but the next moment
realized what it was. The creature hung with its ugly fleshy wings
extended over a grotesque stone head that leered down upon me, its
evil-looking snout projecting into the room; it lay perfectly
still, returning me glance for glance, until moved by the repulsion
of its presence I clapped my hands, and cried loudly; then, slowly
flitting in a circle round the roof, it vanished with a flapping of
wings into some darker corner of the rafters. Mrs Batty was
astounded, and expressed surprise that it had managed to conceal
itself for so long.--From <i>The Stone Chamber</i></td>

<p>Both horse and rider were manifestly weary. The scrubby ridges
and broken gullies, characteristic of the Upper Dawson country of
Queensland, seemed interminable. Over the ridge, longer and more
forbidding than previous ones, the rays of a fast-disappearing sun
shed a lustre that made it almost beautiful. The young man on the
flea-bitten grey drew rein mechanically, and muttered an
imprecation. He was dressed bush fashion--slouch hat, Crimean
shirt, serviceable riding pants, and a belt out of which protruded
the handle of a murderous-looking revolver. His carriage and
demeanor denoted connection at some time or other with one of Her
Majesty's services. He had the confidence which comes of training
and discipline, and the reckless abandon which only youth and
excellent health can give. Turning in his saddle, he glanced around
him. &quot;By Jove,&quot; he muttered, &quot;this has been a most
trying day. It looks like camping out again, and sleeping with one
eye open in case of blacks.&quot;</p>

<td width="63%">At the era of discovery by Tasman, Van Diemen's
Land was inhabited. He heard, or thought he heard, the voices of
people and the sound of a trumpet: he noticed the recently cut
notches, five feet asunder, on the bark of the trees, and he saw
the smoke of fires. He inferred that they possessed some unusual
method of climbing, or that their stature was gigantic. In the
sound, the colonist recognises the vocal <i>cooey</i> of the
aborigines, and learns from the steps &quot;to the birds'
nests,&quot; that they then hunted the opossum, and employed that
method of ascent, which, for agility and daring has never been
surpassed. Thus, during more than 150 years, this country was
forgotten; and such were the limits of European knowledge, when the
expedition of Cook was dispatched by Great Britain to explore this
hemisphere. No navigator brought larger views, and a temper more
benevolent, to the task of discovery. To some nations he opened the
path of civilisation and religion: to this race he was the
harbinger of death. <b>Volume 2</b></td>

to us at the anchorage containing Mr. and Mrs. D.C. McArthur and

for some days there had been excessive heat and a hot wind, which
had now reacted in this southerly blast, to go on probably into

<td width="63%">The <i><b>early</b></i> history of bushranging in
Australia will never be written, for the facts have never been
recorded. Limited though the colony was in extent, its
literature--even its journalism--was still more limited. Moreover,
the first men who &quot;took the bush&quot; were neither important
nor interesting enough to obtain more than a passing mention in
those Governors' despatches which are our chief authorities for
early colonial history. Owing to the stringent military rule during
the first years of convict settlement, the unknown character of the
country, and the absence of prey in the shape of men with money or
other possessions (the aborigines being the only occupants of the
soil outside the properly formed settlements), those who were
called bushrangers then were simply men who had broken away from
their gangs in the hope of escaping from the torture of labour
under Government. The name has been made to carry a very different
meaning since then, being applied to men who, some from choice and
some from necessity, ranged the bush as freebooters,
&quot;sticking-up&quot; settlers and travellers and demanding in
orthodox style &quot;your money or your life.&quot;<br>

with all the ships, weighed, and in the evening anchored in Port
Jackson, with a few trifling damages done to some of them, who had
run foul of each other in working out of Botany Bay. Port Jackson I
believe to be, without exception, the finest and most extensive
harbour in the universe, and at the same time the most secure,
being safe from all the winds that blow. It is divided into a great
number of coves, to which his excellency has given different names.
That on which the town is to be built, is called Sydney Cove. It is
one of the smallest in the harbour, but the most convenient, as
ships of the greatest burden can with ease go into it, and heave
out close to the shore. Trincomal&eacute;, acknowledged to be one
of the best harbours in the world, is by no means to be compared to
it. In a word, Port Jackson would afford sufficient and safe
anchorage for all the navies of Europe. The Supply had arrived the
day before, and the governor, with every person that could be
spared from the ship, were on shore, clearing the ground for the
encampment. In the evening, when all the ships had anchored, the
English colours were displayed; and at the foot of the flag-staff
his Majesty's health, and success to the settlement, was drank by
the governor, many of the principal officers, and private men who
were present upon the occasion.</td>
