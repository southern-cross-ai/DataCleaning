<h1>Brown of Calaveras</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h1>Bret Harte</h1>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<p>A subdued tone of conversation, and the absence of cigar smoke and
boot heels at the windows of the Wingdam stagecoach, made it evident
that one of the inside passengers was a woman. A disposition on the
part of loungers at the stations to congregate before the window, and
some concern in regard to the appearance of coats, hats, and collars,
further indicated that she was lovely. All of which Mr. Jack Hamlin, on
the box seat, noted with the smile of cynical philosophy. Not that he
depreciated the sex, but that he recognized therein a deceitful
element, the pursuit of which sometimes drew mankind away from the
equally uncertain blandishments of poker&mdash;of which it may be
remarked that Mr. Hamlin was a professional exponent.</p>

<p>So that when he placed his narrow boot on the wheel and leaped down,
he did not even glance at the window from which a green veil was
fluttering, but lounged up and down with that listless and grave
indifference of his class, which was, perhaps, the next thing to good
breeding. With his closely buttoned figure and self- contained air he
was a marked contrast to the other passengers, with their feverish
restlessness and boisterous emotion; and even Bill Masters, a graduate
of Harvard, with his slovenly dress, his overflowing vitality, his
intense appreciation of lawlessness and barbarism, and his mouth filled
with crackers and cheese, I fear cut but an unromantic figure beside
this lonely calculator of chances, with his pale Greek face and Homeric
gravity.</p>

<p>The driver called "All aboard!" and Mr. Hamlin returned to the
coach. His foot was upon the wheel, and his face raised to the level of
the open window, when, at the same moment, what appeared to him to be
the finest eyes in the world suddenly met his. He quietly dropped down
again, addressed a few words to one of the inside passengers, effected
an exchange of seats, and as quietly took his place inside. Mr. Hamlin
never allowed his philosophy to interfere with decisive and prompt
action.</p>

<p>I fear that this irruption of Jack cast some restraint upon the
other passengers&mdash;particularly those who were making themselves
most agreeable to the lady. One of them leaned forward, and apparently
conveyed to her information regarding Mr. Hamlin's profession in a
single epithet. Whether Mr. Hamlin heard it, or whether he recognized
in the informant a distinguished jurist from whom, but a few evenings
before, he had won several thousand dollars, I cannot say. His
colorless face betrayed no sign; his black eyes, quietly observant,
glanced indifferently past the legal gentleman, and rested on the much
more pleasing features of his neighbor. An Indian stoicism&mdash;said
to be an inheritance from his maternal ancestor&mdash;stood him in good
service, until the rolling wheels rattled upon the river gravel at
Scott's Ferry, and the stage drew up at the International Hotel for
dinner. The legal gentleman and a member of Congress leaped out, and
stood ready to assist the descending goddess, while Colonel Starbottle,
of Siskiyou, took charge of her parasol and shawl. In this multiplicity
of attention there was a momentary confusion and delay. Jack Hamlin
quietly opened the OPPOSITE door of the coach, took the lady's
hand&mdash;with that decision and positiveness which a hesitating and
undecided sex know how to admire&mdash;and in an instant had
dexterously and gracefully swung her to the ground, and again lifted
her to the platform. An audible chuckle on the box, I fear, came from
that other cynic, "Yuba Bill," the driver. "Look keerfully arter that
baggage, Kernel," said the expressman, with affected concern, as he
looked after Colonel Starbottle, gloomily bringing up the rear of the
triumphant procession to the waiting- room.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin did not stay for dinner. His horse was already saddled,
and awaiting him. He dashed over the ford, up the gravelly hill, and
out into the dusty perspective of the Wingdam road, like one leaving
pleasant fancy behind him. The inmates of dusty cabins by the roadside
shaded their eyes with their hands and looked after him, recognizing
the man by his horse, and speculating what "was up with Comanche Jack."
Yet much of this interest centered in the horse, in a community where
the time made by "French Pete's" mare in his run from the Sheriff of
Calaveras eclipsed all concern in the ultimate fate of that worthy.</p>

<p>The sweating flanks of his gray at length recalled him to himself.
He checked his speed, and, turning into a by-road, sometimes used as a
cutoff, trotted leisurely along, the reins hanging listlessly from his
fingers. As he rode on, the character of the landscape changed and
became more pastoral. Openings in groves of pine and sycamore disclosed
some rude attempts at cultivation&mdash;a flowering vine trailed over
the porch of one cabin, and a woman rocked her cradled babe under the
roses of another. A little farther on Mr. Hamlin came upon some
barelegged children wading in the willowy creek, and so wrought upon
them with a badinage peculiar to himself that they were emboldened to
climb up his horse's legs and over his saddle, until he was fain to
develop an exaggerated ferocity of demeanor, and to escape, leaving
behind some kisses and coin. And then, advancing deeper into the woods,
where all signs of habitation failed, he began to sing&mdash;uplifting
a tenor so singularly sweet, and shaded by a pathos so subduing and
tender, that I wot the robins and linnets stopped to listen. Mr.
Hamlin's voice was not cultivated; the subject of his song was some
sentimental lunacy borrowed from the Negro minstrels; but there
thrilled through all some occult quality of tone and expression that
was unspeakably touching. Indeed, it was a wonderful sight to see this
sentimental blackleg, with a pack of cards in his pocket and a revolver
at his back, sending his voice before him through the dim woods with a
plaint about his "Nelly's grave" in a way that overflowed the eyes of
the listener. A sparrow hawk, fresh from his sixth victim, possibly
recognizing in Mr. Hamlin a kindred spirit, stared at him in surprise,
and was fain to confess the superiority of man. With a superior
predatory capacity, HE couldn't sing.</p>

<p>But Mr. Hamlin presently found himself again on the highroad, and at
his former pace. Ditches and banks of gravel, denuded hillsides,
stumps, and decayed trunks of trees, took the place of woodland and
ravine, and indicated his approach to civilization. Then a church
steeple came in sight, and he knew that he had reached home. In a few
moments he was clattering down the single narrow street that lost
itself in a chaotic ruin of races, ditches, and tailings at the foot of
the hill, and dismounted before the gilded windows of the "Magnolia"
saloon. Passing through the long barroom, he pushed open a green-baize
door, entered a dark passage, opened another door with a passkey, and
found himself in a dimly lighted room whose furniture, though elegant
and costly for the locality, showed signs of abuse. The inlaid center
table was overlaid with stained disks that were not contemplated in the
original design. The embroidered armchairs were discolored, and the
green velvet lounge, on which Mr. Hamlin threw himself, was soiled at
the foot with the red soil of Wingdam.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin did not sing in his cage. He lay still, looking at a
highly colored painting above him representing a young creature of
opulent charms. It occurred to him then, for the first time, that he
had never seen exactly that kind of a woman, and that if he should, he
would not, probably, fall in love with her. Perhaps he was thinking of
another style of beauty. But just then someone knocked at the door.
Without rising, he pulled a cord that apparently shot back a bolt, for
the door swung open, and a man entered.</p>

<p>The newcomer was broad-shouldered and robust&mdash;a vigor not borne
out in the face, which, though handsome, was singularly weak, and
disfigured by dissipation. He appeared to be also under the influence
of liquor, for he started on seeing Mr. Hamlin, and said, "I thought
Kate was here," stammered, and seemed confused and embarrassed.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin smiled the smile which he had before worn on the Wingdam
coach, and sat up, quite refreshed and ready for business.</p>

<p>"You didn't come up on the stage," continued the newcomer, "did
you?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Hamlin; "I left it at Scott's Ferry. It isn't due for
half an hour yet. But how's luck, Brown?"</p>

<p>Damn bad," said Brown, his face suddenly assuming an expression of
weak despair; "I'm cleaned out again, Jack," he continued, in a whining
tone that formed a pitiable contrast to his bulky figure, "can't you
help me with a hundred till tomorrow's cleanup? You see I've got to
send money home to the old woman, and&mdash;you've won twenty times
that amount from me."</p>

<p>The conclusion was, perhaps, not entirely logical, but Jack
overlooked it, and handed the sum to his visitor. "The old-woman
business is about played out, Brown," he added, by way of commentary;
"why don't you say you want to buck agin' faro? You know you ain't
married!"</p>

<p>"Fact, sir," said Brown, with a sudden gravity, as if the mere
contact of the gold with the palm of the hand had imparted some dignity
to his frame. "I've got a wife&mdash;a damned good one, too, if I do
say it&mdash;in the States. It's three year since I've seen her, and a
year since I've writ to her. When things is about straight, and we get
down to the lead, I'm going to send for her."</p>

<p>"And Kate?" queried Mr. Hamlin, with his previous smile.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown of Calaveras essayed an archness of glance, to cover his
confusion, which his weak face and whisky-muddled intellect but poorly
carried out, and said:</p>

<p>"Damn it, Jack, a man must have a little liberty, you know. But
come, what do you say to a little game? Give us a show to double this
hundred."</p>

<p>Jack Hamlin looked curiously at his fatuous friend. Perhaps he knew
that the man was predestined to lose the money, and preferred that it
should flow back into his own coffers rather than any other. He nodded
his head, and drew his chair toward the table. At the same moment there
came a rap upon the door.</p>

<p>"It's Kate," said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin shot back the bolt, and the door opened. But, for the
first time in his life, he staggered to his feet, utterly unnerved and
abashed, and for the first time in his life the hot blood crimsoned his
colorless cheeks to his forehead. For before him stood the lady he had
lifted from the Wingdam coach, whom Brown&mdash; dropping his cards
with a hysterical laugh&mdash;greeted as:</p>

<p>"My old woman, by thunder!"</p>

<p>They say that Mrs. Brown burst into tears, and reproaches of her
husband. I saw her, in 1857, at Marysville, and disbelieve the story.
And the WINGDAM CHRONICLE, of the next week, under the head of
"Touching Reunion," said: "One of those beautiful and touching
incidents, peculiar to California life, occurred last week in our city.
The wife of one of Wingdam's eminent pioneers, tired of the effete
civilization of the East and its inhospitable climate, resolved to join
her noble husband upon these golden shores. Without informing him of
her intention, she undertook the long journey, and arrived last week.
The joy of the husband may be easier imagined than described. The
meeting is said to have been indescribably affecting. We trust her
example may be followed."</p>

<p>Whether owing to Mrs. Brown's influence, or to some more successful
speculations, Mr. Brown's financial fortune from that day steadily
improved. He bought out his partners in the "Nip and Tuck" lead, with
money which was said to have been won at poker, a week or two after his
wife's arrival, but which rumor, adopting Mrs. Brown's theory that
Brown had forsworn the gaming-table, declared to have been furnished by
Mr. Jack Hamlin. He built and furnished the "Wingdam House," which
pretty Mrs. Brown's great popularity kept overflowing with guests. He
was elected to the Assembly, and gave largess to churches. A street in
Wingdam was named in his honor.</p>

<p>Yet it was noted that in proportion as he waxed wealthy and
fortunate, he grew pale, thin, and anxious. As his wife's popularity
increased, he became fretful and impatient. The most uxorious of
husbands, he was absurdly jealous. If he did not interfere with his
wife's social liberty, it was because it was maliciously whispered that
his first and only attempt was met by an outburst from Mrs. Brown that
terrified him into silence. Much of this kind of gossip came from those
of her own sex whom she had supplanted in the chivalrous attentions of
Wingdam, which, like most popular chivalry, was devoted to an
admiration of power, whether of masculine force or feminine beauty. It
should be remembered, too, in her extenuation that since her arrival,
she had been the unconscious priestess of a mythological worship,
perhaps not more ennobling to her womanhood than that which
distinguished an older Greek democracy. I think that Brown was dimly
conscious of this. But his only confidant was Jack Hamlin, whose
INFELIX reputation naturally precluded any open intimacy with the
family, and whose visits were infrequent.</p>

<p>It was midsummer, and a moonlit night; and Mrs. Brown, very rosy,
large-eyed, and pretty, sat upon the piazza, enjoying the fresh incense
of the mountain breeze, and, it is to be feared, another incense which
was not so fresh, nor quite as innocent. Beside her sat Colonel
Starbottle and Judge Boompointer, and a later addition to her court in
the shape of a foreign tourist. She was in good spirits.</p>

<p>"What do you see down the road?" inquired the gallant Colonel, who
had been conscious, for the last few minutes, that Mrs. Brown's
attention was diverted.</p>

<p>"Dust," said Mrs. Brown, with a sigh. "Only Sister Anne's 'flock of
sheep.'"</p>

<p>The Colonel, whose literary recollections did not extend farther
back than last week's paper, took a more practical view. "It ain't
sheep," he continued; "it's a horseman. Judge, ain't that Jack Hamlin's
gray?"</p>

<p>But the Judge didn't know; and as Mrs. Brown suggested the air was
growing too cold for further investigations, they retired to the
parlor.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown was in the stable, where he generally retired after
dinner. Perhaps it was to show his contempt for his wife's companions;
perhaps, like other weak natures, he found pleasure in the exercise of
absolute power over inferior animals. He had a certain gratification in
the training of a chestnut mare, whom he could beat or caress as
pleased him, which he couldn't do with Mrs. Brown. It was here that he
recognized a certain gray horse which had just come in, and, looking a
little farther on, found his rider. Brown's greeting was cordial and
hearty, Mr. Hamlin's somewhat restrained. But at Brown's urgent
request, he followed him up the back stairs to a narrow corridor, and
thence to a small room looking out upon the stable yard. It was plainly
furnished with a bed, a table, a few chairs, and a rack for guns and
whips.</p>

<p>"This yer's my home, Jack," said Brown, with a sigh, as he threw
himself upon the bed, and motioned his companion to a chair. "Her
room's t'other end of the hall. It's more'n six months since we've
lived together, or met, except at meals. It's mighty rough papers on
the head of the house, ain't it?" he said, with a forced laugh. "But
I'm glad to see you, Jack, damn glad," and he reached from the bed, and
again shook the unresponsive hand of Jack Hamlin.</p>

<p>"I brought ye up here, for I didn't want to talk in the stable;
though, for the matter of that, it's all round town. Don't strike a
light. We can talk here in the moonshine. Put up your feet on that
winder, and sit here beside me. Thar's whisky in that jug."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin did not avail himself of the information. Brown of
Calaveras turned his face to the wall and continued:</p>

<p>"If I didn't love the woman, Jack, I wouldn't mind. But it's loving
her, and seeing her, day arter day, goin' on at this rate, and no one
to put down the brake; that's what gits me! But I'm glad to see ye,
Jack, damn glad."</p>

<p>In the darkness he groped about until he had found and wrung his
companion's hand again. He would have detained it, but Jack slipped it
into the buttoned breast of his coat, and asked, listlessly, "How long
has this been going on?"</p>

<p>"Ever since she came here; ever since the day she walked into the
Magnolia. I was a fool then; Jack, I'm a fool now; but I didn't know
how much I loved her till then. And she hasn't been the same woman
since.</p>

<p>"But that ain't all, Jack; and it's what I wanted to see you about,
and I'm glad you've come. It ain't that she doesn't love me any more;
it ain't that she fools with every chap that comes along, for, perhaps,
I staked her love and lost it, as I did everything else at the
Magnolia; and, perhaps, foolin' is nateral to some women, and thar
ain't no great harm done, 'cept to the fools. But, Jack, I
think&mdash;I think she loves somebody else. Don't move, Jack; don't
move; if your pistol hurts ye, take it off.</p>

<p>"It's been more'n six months now that she's seemed unhappy and
lonesome, and kinder nervous and scared-like. And sometimes I've
ketched her lookin' at me sort of timid and pitying. And she writes to
somebody. And for the last week she's been gathering her own
things&mdash;trinkets, and furbelows, and jew'lry&mdash;and, Jack, I
think she's goin' off. I could stand all but that. To have her steal
away like a thief&mdash;" He put his face downward to the pillow, and
for a few moments there was no sound but the ticking of a clock on the
mantel. Mr. Hamlin lit a cigar, and moved to the open window. The moon
no longer shone into the room, and the bed and its occupant were in
shadow. "What shall I do, Jack?" said the voice from the darkness.</p>

<p>The answer came promptly and clearly from the window-side: "Spot the
man, and kill him on sight."</p>

<p>"But, Jack?"</p>

<p>"He's took the risk!"</p>

<p>"But will that bring HER back?"</p>

<p>Jack did not reply, but moved from the window toward the door.</p>

<p>"Don't go yet, Jack; light the candle, and sit by the table. It's a
comfort to see ye, if nothin' else."</p>

<p>Jack hesitated, and then complied. He drew a pack of cards from his
pocket and shuffled them, glancing at the bed. But Brown's face was
turned to the wall. When Mr. Hamlin had shuffled the cards, he cut
them, and dealt one card on the opposite side of the table and toward
the bed, and another on his side of the table for himself. The first
was a deuce, his own card, a king. He then shuffled and cut again. This
time "dummy" had a queen, and himself a four-spot. Jack brightened up
for the third deal. It brought his adversary a deuce, and himself a
king again. "Two out of three," said Jack, audibly.</p>

<p>"What's that, Jack?" said Brown.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>Then Jack tried his hand with dice; but he always threw sixes, and
his imaginary opponent aces. The force of habit is sometimes
confusing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some magnetic influence in Mr. Hamlin's presence, or the
anodyne of liquor, or both, brought surcease of sorrow, and Brown
slept. Mr. Hamlin moved his chair to the window, and looked out on the
town of Wingdam, now sleeping peacefully&mdash;its harsh outlines
softened and subdued, its glaring colors mellowed and sobered in the
moonlight that flowed over all. In the hush he could hear the gurgling
of water in the ditches, and the sighing of the pines beyond the hill.
Then he looked up at the firmament, and as he did so a star shot across
the twinkling field. Presently another, and then another. The
phenomenon suggested to Mr. Hamlin a fresh augury. If in another
fifteen minutes another star should fall&mdash; He sat there, watch in
hand, for twice that time, but the phenomenon was not repeated.</p>

<p>The clock struck two, and Brown still slept. Mr. Hamlin approached
the table and took from his pocket a letter, which he read by the
flickering candlelight. It contained only a single line, written in
pencil, in a woman's hand:</p>

<p>"Be at the corral, with the buggy, at three."</p>

<p>The sleeper moved uneasily, and then awoke. "Are you there
Jack?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Don't go yet. I dreamed just now, Jack&mdash;dreamed of old times.
I thought that Sue and me was being married agin, and that the parson,
Jack, was&mdash;who do you think?&mdash;you!"</p>

<p>The gambler laughed, and seated himself on the bed&mdash;the paper
still in his hand.</p>

<p>"It's a good sign, ain't it?" queried Brown.</p>

<p>"I reckon. Say, old man, hadn't you better get up?"</p>

<p>The "old man," thus affectionately appealed to, rose, with the
assistance of Hamlin's outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Smoke?"</p>

<p>Brown mechanically took the proffered cigar.</p>

<p>"Light?"</p>

<p>Jack had twisted the letter into a spiral, lit it, and held it for
his companion. He continued to hold it until it was consumed, and
dropped the fragment&mdash;a fiery star&mdash;from the open window. He
watched it as it fell, and then returned to his friend.</p>

<p>"Old man," he said, placing his hands upon Brown's shoulders, "in
ten minutes I'll be on the road, and gone like that spark. We won't see
each other agin; but, before I go, take a fool's advice: sell out all
you've got, take your wife with you, and quit the country. It ain't no
place for you, nor her. Tell her she must go; make her go, if she
won't. Don't whine because you can't be a saint, and she ain't an
angel. Be a man&mdash;and treat her like a woman. Don't be a damn fool.
Good-by."</p>

<p>He tore himself from Brown's grasp, and leaped down the stairs like
a deer. At the stable door he collared the half-sleeping hostler and
backed him against the wall. "Saddle my horse in two minutes, or
I'll&mdash;" The ellipsis was frightfully suggestive.</p>

<p>"The missis said you was to have the buggy," stammered the man.</p>

<p>"Damn the buggy!"</p>

<p>The horse was saddled as fast as the nervous hands of the astounded
hostler could manipulate buckle and strap.</p>

<p>"Is anything up, Mr. Hamlin?" said the man, who, like all his class,
admired the elan of his fiery patron, and was really concerned in his
welfare.</p>

<p>"Stand aside!"</p>

<p>The man fell back. With an oath, a bound, and clatter, Jack was into
the road. In another moment, to the man's half-awakened eyes, he was
but a moving cloud of dust in the distance, toward which a star just
loosed from its brethren was trailing a stream of fire.</p>

<p>But early that morning the dwellers by the Wingdam turnpike, miles
away, heard a voice, pure as a skylark's, singing afield. They who were
asleep turned over on their rude couches to dream of youth and love and
olden days. Hard-faced men and anxious gold-seekers, already at work,
ceased their labors and leaned upon their picks, to listen to a
romantic vagabond ambling away against the rosy sunrise.</p>
