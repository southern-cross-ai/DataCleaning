  <p class="quote">The well-known characters of Chip, Pink, Andy Green, Irish,
  Slim, Weary, Big Medicine and the Little Doctor&mdash;all the genial and well
  beloved members of the Happy Family&mdash;once more appear in this splendid
  new story of the cattleland.</p>

  <p class="quote">While "the Old Man" was away in Chicago, Dunk Whittaker, his
  former pardner, stocked a neighboring ranch with sheep. The very sight and
  smell of their woolly bodies, as the sheep were driven upon the choicest
  pasturage land of the Flying U Coulee, drove the cowboys frantic with
  rage.</p>

  <p class="quote">How the fear of the law put a wholesome crimp into the soul
  of Dunk Whittaker, and how "the bunch" wins out in the end, complete a story
  told in B.M. Bower's happiest vein. No other American author embodies so
  vividly the fine, free spirit of the West.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; THE COMING OF A NATIVE SON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Happy Family, waiting for the Sunday supper call, were
  grouped around the open door of the bunk-house, gossiping idly of things
  purely local, when the Old Man returned from the Stock Association at Helena;
  beside him on the buggy seat sat a stranger. The Old Man pulled up at the
  bunk-house, the stranger sprang out over the wheel with the agility which
  bespoke youthful muscles, and the Old Man introduced him with a quirk of the
  lips:</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Mig-u-ell Rapponi, boys&mdash;a peeler straight from the
  Golden Gate. Throw out your war-bag and make yourself to home, Mig-u-ell;
  some of the boys'll show you where to bed down."</p>

  <p>The Old Man drove on to the house with his own luggage, and Happy Jack
  followed to take charge of the team; but the remainder of the Happy Family
  unobtrusively took the measure of the foreign element. From his
  black-and-white horsehair hatband, with tassels that swept to the very edge
  of his gray hatbrim, to the crimson silk neckerchief draped over the pale
  blue bosom of his shirt; from the beautifully stamped leather cuffs, down to
  the exaggerated height of his tan boot-heels, their critical eyes swept in
  swift, appraising glances; and unanimous disapproval was the result. The
  Happy Family had themselves an eye to picturesque garb upon occasion, but
  this passed even Pink's love of display.</p>

  <p>"He's some gaudy to look at," Irish murmured under his breath to Cal
  Emmett.</p>

  <p>"All he lacks is a spot-light and a brass band," Cal returned, in much the
  same tone with which a woman remarks upon a last season's hat on the head of
  a rival.</p>

  <p>Miguel was not embarrassed by the inspection. He was tall, straight, and
  swarthily handsome, and he stood with the complacence of a stage favorite
  waiting for the applause to cease so that he might speak his first lines;
  and, while he waited, he sifted tobacco into a cigarette paper daintily, with
  his little finger extended. There was a ring upon that finger; a ring with a
  moonstone setting as large and round as the eye of a startled cat, and the
  Happy Family caught the pale gleam of it and drew a long breath. He lighted a
  match nonchalantly, by the artfully simple method of pinching the head of it
  with his fingernails, leaned negligently against the wall of the bunk-house,
  and regarded the group incuriously while he smoked.</p>

  <p>"Any pretty girls up this way?" he inquired languidly, after a moment,
  fanning a thin smoke-cloud from before his face while he spoke.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family went prickly hot. The girls in that neighborhood were
  held in esteem, and there was that in his tone which gave offense.</p>

  <p>"Sure, there's pretty girls here!" Big Medicine bellowed unexpectedly,
  close beside him. "We're all of us engaged to `em, by cripes!"</p>

  <p>Miguel shot an oblique glance at Big Medicine, examined the end of his
  cigarette, and gave a lift of shoulder, which might mean anything or nothing,
  and so was irritating to a degree. He did not pursue the subject further, and
  so several belated retorts were left tickling futilely the tongues of the
  Happy Family&mdash; which does not make for amiability.</p>

  <p>To a man they liked him little, in spite of their easy friendliness with
  mankind in general. At supper they talked with him perfunctorily, and
  covertly sneered because he sprinkled his food liberally with cayenne and his
  speech with Spanish words pronounced with soft, slurred vowels that made them
  sound unfamiliar, and against which his English contrasted sharply with its
  crisp, American enunciation. He met their infrequent glances with the cool
  stare of absolute indifference to their opinion of him, and their perfunctory
  civility with introspective calm.</p>

  <p>The next morning, when there was riding to be done, and Miguel appeared at
  the last moment in his working clothes, even Weary, the sunny-hearted, had an
  unmistakable curl of his lip after the first glance.</p>

  <p>Miguel wore the hatband, the crimson kerchief tied loosely with the point
  draped over his chest, the stamped leather cuffs and the tan boots with the
  highest heels ever built by the cobbler craft. Also, the lower half of him
  was incased in chaps the like of which had never before been brought into
  Flying U coulee. Black Angora chaps they were; long-haired, crinkly to the
  very hide, with three white, diamond-shaped patches running down each leg of
  them, and with the leather waistband stamped elaborately to match the cuffs.
  The bands of his spurs were two inches wide and inlaid to the edge with
  beaten silver, and each concho was engraved to represent a large, wild rose,
  with a golden center. A dollar laid upon the rowels would have left a fringe
  of prongs all around.</p>

  <p>He bent over his sacked riding outfit, and undid it, revealing a wonderful
  saddle of stamped leather inlaid on skirt and cantle with more beaten silver.
  He straightened the skirts, carefully ignoring the glances thrown in his
  direction, and swore softly to himself when he discovered where the leather
  had been scratched through the canvas wrappings and the end of the silver
  scroll ripped up. He drew out his bridle and shook it into shape, and the
  silver mountings and the reins of braided leather with horsehair tassels made
  Happy Jack's eyes greedy with desire. His blanket was a scarlet Navajo, and
  his rope a rawhide lariat.</p>

  <p>Altogether, his splendor when he was mounted so disturbed the fine mental
  poise of the Happy Family that they left him jingling richly off by himself,
  while they rode closely grouped and discussed him acrimoniously.</p>

  <p>"By gosh, a man might do worse than locate that Native Son for a silver
  mine," Cal began, eyeing the interloper scornfully. "It's plumb wicked to
  ride around with all that wealth and fussy stuff. He must 'a' robbed a bank
  and put the money all into a riding outfit."</p>

  <p>"By golly, he looks to me like a pair uh treys when he comes bow-leggin'
  along with them white diamonds on his legs," Slim stated solemnly.</p>

  <p>"And I'll gamble that's a spot higher than he stacks up in the cow game,"
  Pink observed with the pessimism which matrimony had given him. "You mind him
  asking about bad horses, last night? That Lizzie-boy never saw a bad horse;
  they don't grow 'em where he come from. What they don't know about riding
  they make up for with a swell rig&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And, oh, mamma! It sure is a swell rig!" Weary paid generous tribute.
  "Only I will say old Banjo reminds me of an Irish cook rigged out in silk and
  diamonds. That outfit on Glory, now&mdash;" He sighed enviously.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've gone up against a few real ones in my long and varied career,"
  Irish remarked reminiscently, "and I've noticed that a hoss never has any
  respect or admiration for a swell rig. When he gets real busy it ain't the
  silver filigree stuff that's going to help you hold connections with your
  saddle, and a silver-mounted bridle-bit ain't a darned bit better than a
  plain one."</p>

  <p>"Just take a look at him!" cried Pink, with intense disgust. "Ambling off
  there, so the sun can strike all that silver and bounce back in our eyes. And
  that braided lariat&mdash;I'd sure love to see the pieces if he ever tries to
  anchor anything bigger than a yearling!"</p>

  <p>"Why, you don't think for a minute he could ever get out and rope
  anything, do yuh ?" Irish laughed. "That there Native Son throws on
  a-w-l-together too much dog to really get out and do anything."</p>

  <p>"Aw," fleered Happy Jack, "he ain't any Natiff Son. He's a dago!"</p>

  <p>"He's got the earmarks uh both," Big Medicine stated authoritatively. "I
  know 'em, by cripes, and I know their ways." He jerked his thumb toward the
  dazzling Miguel. "I can tell yuh the kinda cow-puncher he is; I've saw 'em
  workin' at it. Haw-haw- haw! They'll start out to move ten or a dozen head uh
  tame old cows from one field to another, and there'll be six or eight
  fellers, rigged up like this here trey-spot, ridin' along, important as hell,
  drivin' them few cows down a lane, with peach trees on both sides, by cripes,
  jingling their big, silver spurs, all wearin' fancy chaps to ride four or
  five miles down the road. Honest to grandma, they call that punchin' cows!
  Oh, he's a Native Son, all right. I've saw lots of 'em, only I never saw one
  so far away from the Promised Land before. That there looks queer to me.
  Natiff Sons&mdash;the real ones, like him&mdash;are as scarce outside
  Calyforny as buffalo are right here in this coulee."</p>

  <p>"That's the way they do it, all right," Irish agreed. "And then they'll
  have a 'rodeo'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Haw-haw-haw!" Big Medicine interrupted, and took up the tale, which might
  have been entitled "Some Cowpunching I Have Seen."</p>

  <p>"They have them rodeos on a Sunday, mostly, and they invite everybody to
  it, like it was a picnic. And there'll be two or three fellers to every calf,
  all lit up, like Mig-u-ell, over there, in chaps and silver fixin's, fussin'
  around on horseback in a corral, and every feller trying to pile his rope on
  the same calf, by cripes! They stretch 'em out with two ropes&mdash;calves,
  remember! Little, weenty fellers you could pack under one arm! Yuh can't
  blame 'em much. They never have more'n thirty or forty head to brand at a
  time, and they never git more'n a taste uh real work. So they make the most
  uh what they git, and go in heavy on fancy outfits. And this here
  silver-mounted fellow thinks he's a real cowpuncher, by cripes!"</p>

  <p>The Happy Family laughed at the idea; laughed so loud that Miguel left his
  lonely splendor and swung over to them, ostensibly to borrow a match.</p>

  <p>"What's the joke?" he inquired languidly, his chin thrust out and his eyes
  upon the match blazing at the end of his cigarette.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family hesitated and glanced at one another. Then Cal spoke
  truthfully.</p>

  <p>"You're it," he said bluntly, with a secret desire to test the temper of
  this dark-skinned son of the West.</p>

  <p>Miguel darted one of his swift glances at Cal, blew out his match and
  threw it away.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how funny. Ha-ha." His voice was soft and absolutely expressionless,
  his face blank of any emotion whatever. He merely spoke the words as a
  machine might have done.</p>

  <p>If he had been one of them, the Happy Family would have laughed at the
  whimsical humor of it. As it was, they repressed the impulse, though Weary
  warmed toward him slightly.</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe anything this innocent-eyed gazabo tells you, Mr.
  Rapponi," he warned amiably. "He's known to be a liar."</p>

  <p>"That's funny, too. Ha-ha some more." Miguel permitted a thin ribbon of
  smoke to slide from between his lips, and gazed off to the crinkled line of
  hills.</p>

  <p>"Sure, it is&mdash;now you mention it," Weary agreed after a perceptible
  pause.</p>

  <p>"How fortunate that I brought the humor to your attention," drawled
  Miguel, in the same expressionless tone, much as if he were reciting a
  text.</p>

  <p>"Virtue is its own penalty," paraphrased Pink, not stopping to see whether
  the statement applied to the subject.</p>

  <p>"Haw-haw-haw!" roared Big Medicine, quite as irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"He-he-he," supplemented the silver-trimmed one.</p>

  <p>Big Medicine stopped laughing suddenly, reined his horse close to the
  other, and stared at him challengingly, with his pale, protruding eyes, while
  the Happy Family glanced meaningly at one another. Big Medicine was quite as
  unsafe as he looked, at that moment, and they wondered if the offender
  realized his precarious situation.</p>

  <p>Miguel smoked with the infinite leisure which is a fine art when it is not
  born of genuine abstraction, and none could decide whether he was aware of
  the unfriendly proximity of Big Medicine. Weary was just on the point of
  saying something to relieve the tension, when Miguel blew the ash gently from
  his cigarette and spoke lazily.</p>

  <p>"Parrots are so common, out on the Coast, that they use them in cheap
  restaurants for stew. I've often heard them gabbling together in the
  kettle."</p>

  <p>The statement was so ambiguous that the Happy Family glanced at him
  doubtfully. Big Medicine's stare became more curious than hostile, and he
  permitted his horse to lag a length. It is difficult to fight absolute
  passivity. Then Slim, who ever tramped solidly over the flowers of sarcasm,
  blurted one of his unexpected retorts.</p>

  <p>"I was just wonderin', by golly, where yuh learnt to talk!"</p>

  <p>Miguel turned his velvet eyes sleepily toward the speaker. "From the
  boarders who ate those parrots, amigo," he smiled serenely.</p>

  <p>At this, Slim&mdash;once justly accused by Irish of being a "single-shot"
  when it came to repartee&mdash;turned purple and dumb. The Happy Family,
  forswearing loyalty in their enjoyment of his discomfiture, grinned and left
  to Miguel the barren triumph of the last word.</p>

  <p>He did not gain in popularity as the days passed. They tilted noses at his
  beautiful riding gear, and would have died rather than speak of it in his
  presence. They never gossiped with him of horses or men or the lands he knew.
  They were ready to snub him at a moment's notice&mdash;and it did not lessen
  their dislike of him that he failed to yield them an opportunity. It is to be
  hoped that he found his thoughts sufficient entertainment, since he was left
  to them as much as is humanly possible when half a dozen men eat and sleep
  and work together. It annoyed them exceedingly that Miguel did not seem to
  know that they held him at a distance; they objected to his manner of smoking
  cigarettes and staring off at the skyline as if he were alone and content
  with his dreams. When he did talk they listened with an air of weary
  tolerance. When he did not talk they ignored his presence, and when he was
  absent they criticized him mercilessly.</p>

  <p>They let him ride unwarned into an adobe patch one day&mdash;at least, Big
  Medicine, Pink, Cal Emmett and Irish did, for they were with him&mdash;and
  laughed surreptitiously together while he wallowed there and came out afoot,
  his horse floundering behind him, mud to the ears, both of them.</p>

  <p>"Pretty soft going, along there, ain't it?" Pink commiserated
  deceitfully.</p>

  <p>"It is, kinda," Miguel responded evenly, scraping the adobe off Banjo with
  a flat rock. And the subject was closed.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's some relief to the eyes to have the shine taken off him,
  anyway," Pink observed a little guiltily afterward.</p>

  <p>"I betche he ain't goin' to forget that, though," Happy Jack warned when
  he saw the caked mud on Miguel's Angora chaps and silver spurs, and the
  condition of his saddle. "Yuh better watch out and not turn your backs on him
  in the dark, none uh you guys. I betche he packs a knife. Them kind always
  does."</p>

  <p>"Haw-haw-haw!" bellowed Big Medicine uproariously. "I'd love to see him
  git out an' try to use it, by cripes!"</p>

  <p>"I wish Andy was here," Pink sighed. "Andy'd take the starch outa him, all
  right."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't he be pickings for old Andy, though? Gee!" Cal looked around at
  them, with his wide, baby-blue eyes, and laughed. "Let's kinda jolly him
  along, boys, till Andy gets back. It sure would be great to watch 'em. I'll
  bet he can jar the eternal calm outa that Native Son. That's what grinds me
  worse than his throwin' on so much dog; he's so blamed satisfied with
  himself! You snub him, and he looks at yuh as if you was his hired man&mdash;
  and then forgets all about yuh. He come outa that 'doby like he'd been
  swimmin' a river on a bet, and had made good and was a hee-ro right before
  the ladies. Kinda 'Oh, that's nothing to what I could do if it was worth
  while,' way he had with him."</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't matter so much if he wasn't all front," Pink complained.
  "You'll notice that's always the way, though. The fellow all fussed up with
  silver and braided leather can't get out and do anything. I remember up on
  Milk river&mdash;" Pink trailed off into absorbing reminiscence, which,
  however, is too lengthy to repeat here.</p>

  <p>"Say, Mig-u-ell's down at the stable, sweatin from every pore trying to
  get his saddle clean, by golly!" Slim reported cheerfully, just as Pink was
  relighting the cigarette which had gone out during the big scene of his
  story. "He was cussin' in Spanish, when I walked up to him&mdash;but he shut
  up when he seen me and got that peaceful look uh hisn on his face. I wonder,
  by golly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up and go awn," Irish commanded bluntly, and looked at Pink.
  "Did he call it off, then? Or did you have to wade in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Naw; he was like this here Native Son&mdash;all front. He could look
  sudden death, all right; he had black eyes like Mig-u-ell&mdash; but all a
  fellow had to do was go after him, and he'd back up so blamed
  quick&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Slim listened that far, saw that he had interrupted a tale evidently more
  interesting than anything he could say, and went off, muttering to
  himself.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; "WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE next morning, which was Sunday, the machinations of Big
  Medicine took Pink down to the creek behind the bunk-house. "What's hurtin'
  yuh?" he asked curiously, when he came to where Big Medicine stood in the
  fringe of willows, choking between his spasms of mirth.</p>

  <p>"Haw-haw-haw!" roared Big Medicine; and, seizing Pink's arm in a
  gorilla-like grip, he pointed down the bank.</p>

  <p>Miguel, seated upon a convenient rock in a sunny spot, was painstakingly
  combing out the tangled hair of his chaps, which he had washed quite as
  carefully not long before, as the cake of soap beside him testified.</p>

  <p>"Combing&mdash;combing&mdash;his chaps, by cripes!" Big Medicine gasped,
  and waggled his finger at the spectacle. "Haw-haw-haw! C-
  combin'&mdash;his&mdash;chaps!"</p>

  <p>Miguel glanced up at them as impersonally as if they were two cackling
  hens, rather than derisive humans, then bent his head over a stubborn knot
  and whistled La Paloma softly while he coaxed out the tangle.</p>

  <p>Pink's eyes widened as he looked, but he did not say anything. He backed
  up the path and went thoughtfully to the corrals, leaving Big Medicine to
  follow or not, as he chose.</p>

  <p>"Combin'&mdash;his chaps, by cripes!" came rumbling behind him. Pink
  turned.</p>

  <p>"Say! Don't make so much noise about it," he advised guardedly. "I've got
  an idea."</p>

  <p>"Yuh want to hog-tie it, then," Big Medicine retorted, resentful because
  Pink seemed not to grasp the full humor of the thing. "Idees sure seems to be
  skurce in this outfit&mdash;or that there lily-uh-the-valley couldn't set and
  comb no chaps in broad daylight, by cripes; not and get off with it."</p>

  <p>"He's an ornament to the Flying U," Pink stated dreamily. "Us boneheads
  don't appreciate him, is all that ails us. What we ought to do is&mdash;help
  him be as pretty as he wants to be, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Looky here, Little One." Big Medicine hurried his steps until he was
  close alongside. "I wouldn't give a punched nickel for a four-horse load uh
  them idees, and that's the truth." He passed Pink and went on ahead, disgust
  in every line of his square- shouldered figure. "Combin' his chaps, by
  cripes!" he snorted again, and straightway told the tale profanely to his
  fellows, who laughed until they were weak and watery-eyed as they
  listened.</p>

  <p>Afterward, because Pink implored them and made a mystery of it, they
  invited Miguel to take a hand in a long-winded game&mdash;rather, a series of
  games&mdash;of seven-up, while his chaps hung to dry upon a willow by the
  creek bank&mdash;or so he believed.</p>

  <p>The chaps, however, were up in the white-house kitchen, where were also
  the reek of scorched hair and the laughing expostulations of the Little
  Doctor and the boyish titter of Pink and Irish, who were curling laboriously
  the chaps of Miguel with the curling tongs of the Little Doctor and those of
  the Countess besides.</p>

  <p>"It's a shame, and I just hope Miguel thrashes you both for it," the
  Little Doctor told them more than once; but she laughed, nevertheless, and
  showed Pink how to give the twist which made of each lock a corkscrew
  ringlet. The Countess stopped, with her dishcloth dangling from one red, bony
  hand, while she looked. "You boys couldn't sleep nights if you didn't pester
  the life outa somebody," she scolded. "Seems to me I'd friz them diamonds, if
  I was goin' to be mean enough to do anything."</p>

  <p>"You would, eh?" Pink glanced up at her and dimpled. "I'll find you a rich
  husband to pay for that." He straightway proceeded to friz the diamonds of
  white.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you have a strip of ringlets down each leg, with tight little
  curls between?" suggested the Little Doctor, not to be outdone by any other
  woman.</p>

  <p>"Correct you are," praised Irish.</p>

  <p>"And, remember, you're not heating branding-irons, mister man," she added.
  "You'll burn all the hair off, if you let the tongs get red-hot. Just so
  they'll sizzle; I've told you five times already." She picked up the Kid,
  kissed many times the finger he held up for sympathy&mdash;the finger with
  which he had touched the tongs as Pink was putting them back into the grate
  of the kitchen stove, and spoke again to ease her conscience. "I think it's
  awfully mean of you to do it. Miguel ought to thrash you both."</p>

  <p>"We're dead willing to let him try, Mrs. Chip. We know it's mean. We're
  real ashamed of ourselves." Irish tested his tongs as he had been told to do.
  "But we'd rather be ashamed than good, any old time."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor giggled behind the Kid's tousled curls, and reached out
  a slim hand once more to give Pink's tongs the expert twist he was trying
  awkwardly to learn. "I'm sorry for Miguel; he's got lovely eyes, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Yes, ain't he?" Pink looked up briefly from his task. "How's your leg,
  Irish? Mine's done."</p>

  <p>"Seems to me I'd make a deep border of them corkscrew curls all around the
  bottoms, if I was doin' it," said the Countess peevishly, from the kitchen
  sink. "If I was that dago I'd murder the hull outfit; I never did see a body
  so hectored in my life&mdash; and him not ever ketchin' on. He must be plumb
  simple-minded."</p>

  <p>When the curling was done to the hilarious satisfaction of Irish and Pink,
  and, while Pink was dancing in them to show them off, another entered with
  mail from town. And, because the mail- bearer was Andy Green himself, back
  from a winter's journeyings, Cal, Happy Jack and Slim followed close behind,
  talking all at once, in their joy at beholding the man they loved well and
  hated occasionally also. Andy delivered the mail into the hands of the Little
  Doctor, pinched the Kid's cheek, and said how he had grown good-looking as
  his mother, almost, spoke a cheerful howdy to the Countess, and turned to
  shake hands with Pink. It was then that the honest, gray eyes of him widened
  with amazement.</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly!" gasped Slim, goggling at the chaps of Miguel.</p>

  <p>"That there Natiff Son'll just about kill yuh for that," warned Happy
  Jack, as mournfully as he might with laughing. "He'll knife yuh, sure."</p>

  <p>Andy, demanding the meaning of it all, learned all about Miguel
  Rapponi&mdash;from the viewpoint of the Happy Family. At least, he learned as
  much as it was politic to tell in the presence of the Little Doctor; and
  afterward, while Pink was putting the chaps back upon the willow, where
  Miguel had left them, he was told that they looked to him, Andy Green, for
  assistance.</p>

  <p>"Oh, gosh! You don't want to depend on me, Pink," Andy expostulated
  modestly. "I can't think of anything&mdash;and, besides, I've reformed. I
  don't know as it's any compliment to me, by gracious&mdash;being told soon as
  I land that I'm expected to lie to a perfect stranger."</p>

  <p>"You come on down to the stable and take a look at his saddle and bridle,"
  urged Cal. "And wait till you see him smoking and looking past you, as if you
  was an ornery little peak that didn't do nothing but obstruct the scenery.
  I've seen mean cusses&mdash;lots of 'em; and I've seen men that was stuck on
  themselves. But I never&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come outa that 'doby," Pink interrupted, "mud to his eyebrows, just
  about. And he knew darned well we headed him in there deliberate. And when I
  remarks it's soft going, he says: 'It is, kinda,'&mdash;just like that." Pink
  managed to imitate the languid tone of Miguel very well. "Not another word
  outa him. Didn't even make him mad! He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell him about the parrots, Slim," Cal suggested soberly. But Slim only
  turned purple at the memory, and swore.</p>

  <p>"Old Patsy sure has got it in for him," Happy Jack observed. "He asked
  Patsy if he ever had enchiladas. Patsy won't speak to him no more. He claims
  Mig-u-ell insulted him. He told Mig-u-ell&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Enchiladas are sure fine eating," said Andy. "I took to 'em like a
  she-bear to honey, down in New Mexico this winter. Your Native Son is solid
  there, all right."</p>

  <p>"Aw, gwan! He ain't solid nowhere but in the head. Maybe you'll love him
  to death when yuh see him&mdash;chances is you will, if you've took to eatin'
  dago grub."</p>

  <p>Andy patted Happy Jack reassuringly on the shoulder. "Don't get excited,"
  he soothed. "I'll put it all over the gentleman, just to show my heart's in
  the right place. Just this once, though; I've reformed. And I've got to have
  time to size him up. Where do you keep him when he ain't in the show window?"
  He swung into step with Pink. "I'll tell you the truth," he confided
  engagingly. "Any man that'll wear chaps like he's got&mdash;even leaving out
  the extra finish you fellows have given 'em&mdash;had ought to be taught a
  lesson he'll remember. He sure must be a tough proposition, if the whole
  bunch of yuh have had to give him up. By gracious&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We haven't tried," Pink defended. "It kinda looked to us as if he was
  aiming to make us guy him; so we didn't. We've left him strictly alone.
  To-day"&mdash;he glanced over his shoulder to where the becurled chaps swung
  comically from the willow branch&mdash;"to-day's the first time anybody's
  made a move. Unless," he added, as an afterthought, "you count yesterday in
  the 'doby patch&mdash;and even then we didn't tell him to ride into it; we
  just let him do it."</p>

  <p>"And kinda herded him over towards it," Cal amended slyly.</p>

  <p>"Can he ride?" asked Andy, going straight to the main point, in the mind
  of a cowpuncher.</p>

  <p>"W-e-ell-he hasn't been piled, so far. But then," Pink qualified hastily,
  "he hasn't topped anything worse than Crow- hop. He ain't hard to ride. Happy
  Jack could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw, I'm gittin' good and sick of' hearin' that there tune," Happy growled
  indignantly. "Why don't you point out Slim as the limit, once in a
  while?"</p>

  <p>"Come on down to the stable, and let's talk it over," Andy suggested, and
  led the way. "What's his style, anyway? Mouthy, or what?"</p>

  <p>With four willing tongues to enlighten him, it would be strange, indeed,
  if one so acute as Andy Green failed at last to have a very fair mental
  picture of Miguel. He gazed thoughtfully at his boots, laughed suddenly, and
  slapped Irish quite painfully upon the back.</p>

  <p>"Come on up and introduce me, boys," he said. "We'll make this Native Son
  so hungry for home&mdash;you watch me put it on the gentleman. Only it does
  seem a shame to do it."</p>

  <p>"No, it ain't. If you'd been around him for two weeks, you'd want to kill
  him just to make him take notice," Irish assured him.</p>

  <p>"What gets me," Andy mused, "is why you fellows come crying to me for
  help. I should think the bunch of you ought to be able to handle one lone
  Native Son."</p>

  <p>"Aw, you're the biggest liar and faker in the bunch, is why," Happy Jack
  blurted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see." Andy hummed a little tune and pushed his hands deep into his
  pockets, and at the corners of his lips there flickered a smile.</p>

  <p>The Native Son sat with his hat tilted slightly back upon his head and a
  cigarette between his lips, and was reaching lazily for the trick which made
  the fourth game his, when the group invaded the bunk-house. He looked up
  indifferently, swept Andy's face and figure with a glance too impersonal to
  hold even a shade of curiosity, and began rapidly shuffling his cards to
  count the points he had made.</p>

  <p>Andy stopped short, just inside the door, and stared hard at Miguel, who
  gave no sign. He turned his honest, gray eyes upon Pink and Irish
  accusingly&mdash;whereat they wondered greatly.</p>

  <p>"Your deal&mdash;if you want to play," drawled Miguel, and shoved his
  cards toward Big Medicine. But the boys were already uptilting chairs to
  grasp the quicker the outstretched hand of the prodigal, so that Miguel
  gathered up the cards, evened their edges mechanically, and deigned another
  glance at this stranger who was being welcomed so vociferously. Also he
  sighed a bit&mdash; for even a languid-eyed stoic of a Native Son may feel
  the twinge of loneliness. Andy shook hands all round, swore amiably at Weary,
  and advanced finally upon Miguel.</p>

  <p>"You don't know me from Adam's off ox," he began genially, "but I know
  you, all right, all right. I hollered my head off with the rest of 'em when
  you played merry hell in that bull-ring, last Christmas. Also, I was part of
  your bodyguard when them greasers were trying to tickle you in the ribs with
  their knives in that dark alley. Shake, old-timer! You done yourself proud,
  and I'm glad to know yuh!"</p>

  <p>Miguel, for the first time in two weeks, permitted himself the luxury of
  an expressive countenance. He gave Andy Green one quick, grateful
  look&mdash;and a smile, the like of which made the Happy Family quiver
  inwardly with instinctive sympathy.</p>

  <p>"So you were there, too, eh?" Miguel exclaimed softly, and rose to greet
  him. "And that scrap in the alley&mdash;we sure had a hell of a time there
  for a few minutes, didn't we? Are you that tall fellow who kicked that
  squint-eyed greaser in the stomach? Muchos gracios, senor! They were piling
  on me three deep, right then, and I always believed they'd have got me, only
  for a tall vaquero I couldn't locate afterward." He smiled again that
  wonderful smile, which lighted the darkness of his eyes as with a flame, and
  murmured a sentence or two in Spanish.</p>

  <p>"Did you get the spurs me and my friends sent you afterward?" asked Andy
  eagerly. "We heard about the Arizona boys giving you the saddle&mdash;and we
  raked high and low for them spurs. And, by gracious, they were beauts,
  too&mdash;did yuh get 'em?"</p>

  <p>"I wear them every day I ride," answered Miguel, a peculiar, caressing
  note in his voice.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know&mdash;we heard you had disappeared off the earth.
  Why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Miguel laughed outright. "To fight a bull with bare hands is one thing,
  amigo," he said. "To take a chance on getting a knife stuck in your back is
  another. Those Mexicans&mdash;they don't love the man who crosses the river
  and makes of their bull-fights a plaything."</p>

  <p>"That's right; only I thought, you being a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a Mexican." Miguel's voice sharpened a trifle. "My father was
  Spanish, yes. My mother"&mdash;his eyes flashed briefly at the faces of the
  gaping Happy Family&mdash;"my mother was born in Ireland."</p>

  <p>"And that sure makes a hard combination to beat," cried Andy heartily. He
  looked at the others&mdash;at all, that is, save Pink and Irish, who had
  disappeared. "Well, boys, I never thought I'd come home and find&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Miguel Rapponi," supplied the Native Son quickly. "As well forget that
  other name. And," he added with the shrug which the Happy Family had come to
  hate, "as well forget the story, also. I am not hungry for the feel of a
  knife in my back." He smiled again engagingly at Andy Green. It was
  astonishing how readily that smile had sprung to life with the warmth of a
  little friendship, and how pleasant it was, withal.</p>

  <p>"Just as you say," Andy agreed, not trying to hide his admiration. "I
  guess nobody's got a better right to holler for silence. But&mdash;say, you
  sure delivered the goods, old boy! You musta read about it, you fellows;
  about the American puncher that went over the line and rode one of their
  crack bulls all round the ring, and then&mdash;" He stopped and looked
  apologetically at Miguel, in whose dark eyes there flashed a warning light.
  "I clean forgot," he confessed impulsively. "This meeting you here
  unexpectedly, like this, has kinda got me rattled, I guess. But&mdash;I never
  saw yuh before in my life," he declared emphatically. "I don't know a darn
  thing about&mdash;anything that ever happened in an alley in the city
  of&mdash;oh, come on, old-timer; let's talk about the weather, or something
  safe!"</p>

  <p>After that the boys of the Flying U behaved very much as do children who
  have quarreled foolishly and are trying shamefacedly to re-establish friendly
  relations without the preliminary indignity of open repentance. They avoided
  meeting the velvet-eyed glances of Miguel, and at the same time they were
  plainly anxious to include him in their talk as if that had been their habit
  from the first. A difficult situation to meet, even with the fine aplomb of
  the Happy Family to ease the awkwardness.</p>

  <p>Later Miguel went unobtrusively down to the creek after his chaps; he did
  not get them, just then, but he stood for a long time hidden behind the
  willow-fringe, watching Pink and Irish feverishly combing out certain
  corkscrew ringlets, and dampening their combs in the creek to facilitate the
  process of straightening certain patches of rebellious frizzes. Miguel did
  not laugh aloud, as Big Medicine had done. He stood until he wearied of the
  sight, then lifted his shoulders in the gesture which may mean anything,
  smiled and went his way.</p>

  <p>Not until dusk did Andy get a private word with him. When he did find him
  alone, he pumped Miguel's hand up and down and afterward clutched at the
  manger for support, and came near strangling. Miguel leaned beside him and
  smiled to himself.</p>

  <p>"Good team work, old boy," Andy gasped at length, in a whisper. "Best I
  ever saw in m'life, impromptu on the spot, like that. I saw you had the
  makings in you, soon as I caught your eye. And the whole, blame bunch fell
  for it&mdash;woo-oof!" He laid his face down again upon his folded arms and
  shook in all the long length of him.</p>

  <p>"They had it coming," said Miguel softly, with a peculiar relish. "Two
  whole weeks, and never a friendly word from one of them&mdash;oh, hell!"</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;I heard it all, soon as I hit the ranch," Andy replied
  weakly, standing up and wiping his eyes. "I just thought I'd learn 'em a
  lesson&mdash;and the way you played up&mdash;say, my hat's off to you, all
  right!"</p>

  <p>"One learns to seize opportunities without stuttering," Miguel observed
  calmly&mdash;and a queer look came into his eyes as they rested upon the face
  of Andy. "And, if the chance comes, I'll do as much for you. By the way, did
  you see the saddle those Arizona boys sent me? It's over here. It's a
  pip-pin&mdash;almost as fine as the spurs, which I keep in the bunk-house
  when they're not on my heels. And, if I didn't say so before, I'm sure glad
  to meet the man that helped me through that alley. That big, fat devil would
  have landed me, sure, if you hadn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;what?" Andy leaned and peered into the face of Miguel, his jaw
  hanging slack. "You don't mean to tell me&mdash;it's true?"</p>

  <p>"True? Why, I thought you were the fellow&mdash;" Miguel faced him
  steadily. His eyes were frankly puzzled.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you the truth, so help me," Andy said heavily. "I don't know a
  darned thing about it, only what I read in the papers. I spent the whole
  winter in Colorado and Wyoming. I was just joshing the boys."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Miguel.</p>

  <p>They stood there in the dusk and silence for a space, after which Andy
  went forth into the night to meditate upon this thing. Miguel stood and
  looked after him.</p>

  <p>"He's the real goods when it comes to lying&mdash;but there are others,"
  he said aloud, and smiled a peculiar smile. But for all that he felt that he
  was going to like Andy very much indeed. And, since the Happy Family had
  shown a disposition to make him one of themselves, he knew that he was going
  to become quite as foolishly attached to the Flying U as was even Slim,
  confessedly the most rabid of partisans.</p>

  <p>In this wise did Miguel Rapponi, then, become a member of Jim Whitmore's
  Happy Family, and play his part in the events which followed his
  adoption.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3">III. &mdash; BAD NEWS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ANDY GREEn, that honest-eyed young man whom everyone loved,
  but whom not a man believed save when he was indulging his love for more or
  less fantastic flights of the imagination, pulled up on the brow of Flying U
  coulee and stared somberly at the picture spread below him. On the porch of
  the White House the hammock swung gently under the weight of the Little
  Doctor, who pushed her slipper-toe mechanically against a post support at
  regular intervals while she read.</p>

  <p>On the steps the Kid was crawling laboriously upward, only to descend
  again quite as laboriously when he attained the top. One of the boys was just
  emerging from the blacksmith shop; from the build of him Andy knew it must be
  either Weary or Irish, though it would take a much closer observation, and
  some familiarity with the two to identify the man more exactly. In the corral
  were a swirl of horses and an overhanging cloud of dust, with two or three
  figures discernible in the midst, and away in the little pasture two other
  figures were galloping after a fleeing dozen of horses. While he looked, old
  Patsy came out of the messhouse, and went, with flapping flour-sack apron, to
  the woodpile.</p>

  <p>Peaceful it was, and home-like and contentedly prosperous; a little world
  tucked away in its hills, with its own little triumphs and defeats, its own
  heartaches and rejoicings; a lucky little world, because its triumphs had
  been satisfying, its defeats small, its heartaches brief, and its rejoicings
  untainted with harassment or guilt. Yet Andy stared down upon it with a
  frown; and, when he twitched the reins and began the descent, he sighed
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>Past the stable he rode with scarcely a glance toward Weary, who shouted a
  casual "Hello" at him from the corral; through the big gate and up the trail
  to the White House, and straight to the porch, where the Little Doctor
  flipped a leaf of her magazine and glanced at him with a smile, and the Kid
  turned his plump body upon the middle step and wrinkled his nose in a smile
  of recognition, while he threw out an arm in welcome, and made a wobbling
  effort to get upon his feet.</p>

  <p>Andy smiled at the Kid, but his smile did not reach his eyes, and faded
  almost immediately. He glanced at the Little Doctor, sent his horse past the
  steps and the Kid, and close to the railing, so that he could lean and toss
  the mail into the Little Doctor's lap. There was a yellow envelope among the
  letters, and her fingers singled it out curiously. Andy folded his hands upon
  the saddle-horn and watched her frankly.</p>

  <p>"Must be from J. G.," guessed the Little Doctor, inserting a slim finger
  under the badly sealed flap. "I've been wondering if he wasn't going to send
  some word&mdash;he's been gone a week&mdash;Baby! He's right between your
  horse's legs, Andy! Oh-h&mdash;baby boy, what won't you do next?" She
  scattered letters and papers from her lap and flew to the rescue. "Will he
  kick, Andy? You little ruffian." She held out her arms coaxingly from the top
  of the steps, and her face, Andy saw when he looked at her, had lost some of
  its color.</p>

  <p>"The horse is quiet enough," he reassured her. "But at the same time I
  wouldn't hand him out as a plaything for a kid." He leaned cautiously and
  peered backward.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;did you ever see such a child! Come to mother, Baby!" Her voice
  was becoming strained.</p>

  <p>The Kid, wrinkling his nose, and jabbering unintelligibly at her, so that
  four tiny teeth showed in his pink mouth, moved farther backward, and sat
  down violently under the horse's sweat- roughened belly. He wriggled round so
  that he faced forward, reached out gleefully, caught the front fetlocks, and
  cried "Dup!" while he pulled. The Little Doctor turned white.</p>

  <p>"He's all right," soothed Andy, and, leaning with a twist of his slim
  body, caught the Kid firmly by the back of his pink dress, and lifted him
  clear of danger. He came up with a red face, tossed the Kid into the eager
  arms of the Little Doctor, and soothed his horse with soft words and a series
  of little slaps upon the neck. He was breathing unevenly, because the Kid had
  really been in rather a ticklish position; but the Little Doctor had her face
  hidden on the baby's neck and did not see.</p>

  <p>"Where's Chip?" Andy turned to ride back to the stable, glancing toward
  the telegram lying on the floor of the porch; and from it his eyes went to
  the young woman trying to laugh away her trembling while she scolded
  adoringly her adventurous man-child. He was about to speak again, but thought
  better of it, and sighed.</p>

  <p>"Down at the stables somewhere&mdash;I don't know, really; the boys can
  tell you. Mother's baby mustn't touch the naughty horses. Naughty horses hurt
  mother's baby! Make him cry!"</p>

  <p>Andy gave her a long look, which had in it much pity, and rode away. He
  knew what was in that telegram, for the agent had told him when he hunted him
  up at Rusty Brown's and gave it to him; and the horse of Andy bore mute
  testimony to the speed with which he had brought it to the ranch. Not until
  he had reached the coulee had he slackened his pace. He decided, after that
  glance, that he would not remind her that she had not read the telegram;
  instead, he thought he ought to find Chip immediately and send him to
  her.</p>

  <p>Chip was rummaging after something in the store-house, and, when Andy saw
  him there, he dismounted and stood blotting out the light from the doorway.
  Chip looked up, said "Hello" carelessly, and flung an old slicker aside that
  he might search beneath it. "Back early, aren't you?" he asked, for sake of
  saying something.</p>

  <p>Andy's attitude was not as casual as he would have had it.</p>

  <p>"Say, maybe you better go on up to the house," he began diffidently. "I
  guess your wife wants to see yuh, maybe."</p>

  <p>"Just as a good wife should," grinned Chip. "What's the matter? Kid fall
  off the porch?"</p>

  <p>"N-o-o&mdash;I brought out a wire from Chicago. It's from a doctor
  there&mdash;some hospital. The&mdash;Old Man got hurt. One of them cussed
  automobiles knocked him down. They want you to come."</p>

  <p>Chip had straightened up and was hooking at Andy blankly. "If you're
  just&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Honest," Andy asserted, and flushed a little. "I'll go tell some one to
  catch up the team&mdash;you'll want to make that 11:20, I take it." He added,
  as Chip went by him hastily, "I had the agent wire for sleeper berths on the
  11:20 so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thanks. Yes, you have the team caught up, Andy." Chip was already well on
  his way to the house.</p>

  <p>Andy waited till he saw the Little Doctor come hurriedly to the end of the
  porch overlooking the pathway, with the telegram fluttering in her fingers,
  and then led his horse down through the gate and to the stable. He yanked the
  saddle off, turned the tired animal into a stall, and went on to the corral,
  where he leaned elbows on a warped rail and peered through at the turmoil
  within. Close beside him stood Weary, with his loop dragging behind him,
  waiting for a chance to throw it over the head of a buckskin three-year-old
  with black mane and tail.</p>

  <p>"Get in here and make a hand, why don't you?" Weary bantered, his eye on
  the buckskin. "Good chance to make a 'rep' for yourself, Andy. Gawd greased
  that buckskin&mdash;he sure can slide out from under a rope as
  easy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off to flip the hoop dexterously forward, had the reward of
  seeing the buckskin dodge backward, so that the rope barely flicked him on
  the nose, and drew in his rope disgustedly. "Come on, Andy&mdash;my hands are
  up in the air; I can't land him&mdash; that's the fourth throw."</p>

  <p>Andy's interest in the buckskin, however, was scant. His face was sober,
  his whole attitude one of extreme dejection.</p>

  <p>"You got the tummy-ache?" Pink inquired facetiously, moving around so that
  he got a fair look at his face.</p>

  <p>"Naw&mdash;his girl's went back on him!" Happy Jack put in, coiling his
  rope as he came up.</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up!" Andy's voice was sharp with trouble. "Boys, the Old
  Man's&mdash;well, he's most likely dead by this time. I brought out a
  telegram&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go on!" Pink's eyes widened incredulously. "Don't you try that kind of a
  load, Andy Green, or I'll just about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you fellows make me sick!" Andy took his elbows off the rail and
  stood straight. "Dammit, the telegram's up at the house&mdash;go and read it
  yourselves, then!"</p>

  <p>The three stared after him doubtfully, fear struggling with the caution
  born of much experience.</p>

  <p>"He don't act, to me, like he was putting up a josh," Weary stated
  uneasily, after a minute of silence. "Run up to the house and find out,
  Cadwalloper. The Old Man&mdash;oh, good Lord!" The tan on Weary's face took a
  lighter tinge. "Scoot&mdash;it won't take but a minute to find out for sure.
  Go on, Pink."</p>

  <p>"So help me Josephine, I'll kill that same Andy Green if he's lied about
  it," Pink declared, while he climbed the fence.</p>

  <p>In three minutes he was back, and before he had said a word, his face
  confirmed the bad news. Their eyes besought him for details, and he gave them
  jerkily. "Automobile run over him. He ain't dead, but they think&mdash;Chip
  and the Little Doctor are going to catch the night train. You go haze in the
  team, Happy. And give 'em a feed of oats, Chip said."</p>

  <p>Irish and Big Medicine, seeing the three standing soberly together there,
  and sensing something unusual, came up and heard the news in stunned silence.
  Andy, forgetting his pique at their first disbelief, came forlornly back and
  stood with them.</p>

  <p>The Old Man&mdash;the thing could not be true! To every man of them his
  presence, conjured by the impending tragedy, was almost a palpable thing. His
  stocky figure seemed almost to stand in their midst; he looked at them with
  his whimsical eyes, which had the radiating crow's-feet of age, humor and
  habitual squinting against sun and wind; the bald spot on his head, the
  wrinkling shirt-collar that seldom knew a tie, the carpet slippers which were
  his favorite footgear because they were kind to his bunions, his husky voice,
  good-naturedly complaining, were poignantly real to them at that moment. Then
  Irish mentally pictured him lying maimed, dying, perhaps, in a far-off
  hospital among strangers, and swore.</p>

  <p>"If he's got to die, it oughta be here, where folks know him
  and&mdash;where he knows&mdash;" Irish was not accustomed to giving voice to
  his deeper feelings, and he blundered awkwardly over it.</p>

  <p>"I never did go much on them darned hospitals, anyway," Weary observed
  gloomily. "He oughta be home, where folks can look after him. Mam-ma! It sure
  is a fright."</p>

  <p>"I betche Chip and the Little Doctor won't get there in time," Happy Jack
  predicted, with his usual pessimism. "The Old Man's gittin' old&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He ain't but fifty-two; yuh call that old, consarn yuh? He's younger
  right now than you'll be when you're forty."</p>

  <p>"Countess is going along, too, so she can ride herd on the Kid," Pink
  informed then. "I heard the Little Doctor tell her to pack up, and 'never
  mind if she did have sponge all set!' Countess seemed to think her bread was
  a darned sight more important than the Old Man. That's the way with women.
  They'll pass up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly, I like to see a woman take some interest in her own
  affairs," Slim defended. "What they packin' up for, and where they goin'?"
  Slim had just ridden up to the group in time to overhear Pink's
  criticism.</p>

  <p>They told him the news, and Slim swallowed twice, said "By golly!" quite
  huskily, and then rode slowly away with his head bowed. He had worked for the
  Flying U when it was strictly a bachelor outfit, and with the tenacity of
  slow minds he held J. G. Whitmore, his beloved "Old Man," as but a degree
  lower than that mysterious power which made the sun to shine&mdash;and, if
  the truth were known, he had accepted him as being quite as eternal. His
  loyalty adjusted everything to the interests of the Flying U. That the Old
  Man could die&mdash;the possibility stunned him.</p>

  <p>They were a sorry company that gathered that night around the long table
  with its mottled oil-cloth covering and benches polished to a glass-like
  smoothness with their own vigorous bodies. They did not talk much about the
  Old Man; indeed, they came no nearer the subject than to ask Weary if he were
  going to drive the team in to Dry Lake. They did not talk much about
  anything, for that matter; even the knives and forks seemed to share the
  general depression of spirits, and failed to give forth the cheerful clatter
  which was a daily accompaniment of meals in that room.</p>

  <p>Old Patsy, he who had cooked for J. G. Whitmore when the Flying U coulee
  was a wilderness and the brand yet unrecorded and the irons
  unmade&mdash;Patsy lumbered heavily about the room and could not find his
  dish-cloth when it was squeezed tight in one great, fat hand, and
  unthinkingly started to fill their coffee cups from the tea-kettle.</p>

  <p>"Py cosh, I vould keel der fool vot made her first von of der
  automo-beels, yet!" he exclaimed unexpectedly, after a long silence, and cast
  his pipe vindictively toward his bunk in one corner.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family looked around at him, then understandingly at one
  another.</p>

  <p>"Same here, Patsy," Jack Bates agreed. "What they want of the damned
  things when the country's full uh good horses gits me."</p>

  <p>"So some Yahoo with just sense enough to put goggles on to cover up his
  fool face can run over folks he ain't good enough to speak to, by cripes!"
  Big Medicine glared aggressively up and down the table.</p>

  <p>Weary got up suddenly and went out, and Slim followed him, though his
  supper was half-uneaten.</p>

  <p>"This goin' to be hard on the Little Doctor&mdash;only brother she's got,"
  they heard Happy Jack point out unnecessarily; and Weary, the equable, was
  guilty of slamming the door so that the whole building shook, by way of
  demonstrating his dislike of speech upon the subject.</p>

  <p>They were a sorry company who waved hands at the Little Doctor and the Kid
  and the Countess, just when the afterglow of a red sunset was merging into
  the vague, purple shadows of coming dusk. They stood silent, for the most
  part, and let them go without the usual facetious advice to "Be good to
  yourselves," and the hackneyed admonition to Chip to keep out of jail if he
  could. There must have been something very wistful in their faces, for the
  Little Doctor smiled bravely down upon then from the buggy seat, and lifted
  up the Kid for a four-toothed smile and an ecstatic "Bye!" accompanied by a
  vigorous flopping of hands, which included then all.</p>

  <p>"We'll telegraph first thing, boys," the Little Doctor called back, as the
  rig chucked into the pebbly creek crossing. "We'll keep you posted, and I'll
  write all the particulars as soon as I can. Don't think the
  worst&mdash;unless you have to. I don't." She smiled again, and waved her
  hand hastily because of the Kid's contortions; and, though the smile had
  tears close behind it, though her voice was tremulous in spite of herself,
  the Happy Family took heart from her courage and waved their hats gravely,
  and smiled back as best they could.</p>

  <p>"There's a lot uh cake you boys might just as well eat up," the Countess
  called belatedly. "It'll all dry out, if yuh don't&mdash;and there ain't no
  use wastin' it&mdash;and there's two lemon pies in the brown cupboard, and
  what under the shinin' sun&mdash;" The wheels bumped violently against a
  rock, and the Happy Family heard no more.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">IV. &mdash; SOME HOPES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the third day after, the Happy Family decided that there
  should be some word from Chicago; and, since that day was Sunday, they rode
  in a body to Dry Lake after it. They had not discussed the impending tragedy
  very much, but they were an exceedingly Unhappy Family, nevertheless; and,
  since Flying U coulee was but a place of gloom, they were not averse to
  leaving it behind them for a few hours, and riding where every stick and
  stone did not remind them of the Old Man.</p>

  <p>In Dry Lake was a message, brief but heartening:</p>

  <p>"J. G. still alive. Some hopes".</p>

  <p>They left the station with lighter spirits after reading that; rode to the
  hotel, tied their horses to the long hitching pole there and went in. And
  right there the Happy Family unwittingly became cast for the leading parts in
  one of those dramas of the West which never is heard of outside the theater
  in which grim circumstance stages it for a single playing&mdash;unless,
  indeed, the curtain rings down on a tragedy that brings the actors before
  their district judge for trial. And, as so frequently is the case, the
  beginning was casual to the point of triviality.</p>

  <p>Sary, Ellen, Marg'reet, Sybilly and Jos'phine Denson (spelled in
  accordance with parental pronunciation) were swinging idly upon the hitching
  pole, with the self-conscious sang froid of country children come to town.
  They backed away from the Happy Family's approach, grinned foolishly in
  response to their careless greeting, and tittered openly at the resplendence
  of the Native Son, who was wearing his black Angora chaps with the three
  white diamonds down each leg, the gay horsehair hatband, crimson neckerchief
  and Mexican spurs with their immense rowels and ornate conchos of hand-beaten
  silver. Sary, Ellen, Marg'reet, Jos'phine and Sybilly were also resplendent,
  in their way. Their carroty hair was tied with ribbons quite aggressively
  new, their freckles shone with maternal scrubbing, and there was a hint of
  home-made "crochet-lace" beneath each stiffly starched dress.</p>

  <p>"Hello, kids," Weary greeted them amiably, with a secret smile over the
  memory of a time when they had purloined the Little Doctor's pills and had
  made reluctant acquaintance with a stomach pump. "Where's the circus going to
  be at?"</p>

  <p>"There ain't goin' to be no circus," Sybilly retorted, because she was the
  forward one of the family. "We're going away; on the train. The next one that
  comes along. We're going to be on it all night, too; and we'll have to eat on
  it, too."</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly, you'll want something to eat, then!" Slim was feeling
  abstractedly in his pocket for a coin, for these were the nieces of the
  Countess, and therefore claimed more than a cursory interest from Slim. "You
  take this up to the store and see if yuh can't swop it for something good to
  eat." Because Sary was the smallest of the lot he pressed the dollar into her
  shrinking, amazed palm.</p>

  <p>"Paw's got more money'n that," Sybilly announced proudly. "Paw's got a
  million dollars. A man bought our ranch and gave him a lot of money. We're
  rich now. Maybe paw'll buy us a phony-graft. He said maybe he would. And
  maw's goin' to have a blue silk dress with green onto it. And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Better haze along and buy that grub stake," Slim interrupted the family
  gift for profuse speech. He had caught the boys grinning, and fancied that
  they were tracing a likeness between the garrulity of Sybilly and the fluency
  of her aunt, the Countess. "You don't want that train to go off and leave
  yuh, by golly."</p>

  <p>"Wonder who bought Denson out?" Cal Emmett asked of no one in particular,
  as the children went strutting off to the store to spend the dollar which
  little Sary clutched so tightly it seemed as if the goddess of liberty must
  surely have been imprinted upon her palm.</p>

  <p>When they went inside and found Denson himself pompously "setting 'em up
  to the house," Cal repeated the question in a slightly different form to the
  man himself.</p>

  <p>Denson, while he was ready to impress the beholders with his unaccustomed
  affluence, became noticeably embarrassed at the inquiry, and edged off into
  vague generalities.</p>

  <p>"I jest nacherlly had to sell when I got m' price," he told the Happy
  Family in a tone that savored strongly of apology. "I like the country, and I
  like m' neighbors fine. Never'd ask for better than the Flyin' U has been t'
  me. I ain't got no kick comin' there. Sorry to hear the Old Man's hurt back
  East. Mary was real put out at not bein' able to see Louise 'fore she went
  away"&mdash; Louise being 'the Countess' and Mary Denson's sister&mdash;"but
  soon as I sold I got oneasy like. The feller wanted p'session right away,
  too, so I told Mary we might as well start b'fore we git outa the notion. I
  wouldn't uh cared about sellin', maybe, but the kids needs to be in school.
  They're growin' up in ign'rance out here, and Mary's folks wants us to come
  back 'n' settle close handy by&mdash;they been at us t' sell out and move fer
  the last five years, now, and I told Mary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Even Cal forgot, eventually, that he had asked a question which remained
  unanswered; what interest he had felt at first was smothered to death beneath
  that blanket of words, and he eagerly followed the boys out and over to Rusty
  Brown's place, where Denson, because of an old grudge against Rusty, might be
  trusted not to follow.</p>

  <p>"Mamma!" Weary commented amusedly, when they were crossing the street,
  "that Denson bunch can sure talk the fastest and longest, and say the least,
  of any outfit I ever saw."</p>

  <p>"Wonder who did buy him out?" Jack Bates queried. "Old ginger-whiskers
  didn't pass out any facts, yuh notice. He couldn't have got much; his land's
  mostly gravel and 'doby patches. He's got a water right on Flying U creek,
  you know&mdash;first right, at that, seems to me&mdash;and a dandy fine
  spring in that coulee. Wonder why our outfit didn't buy him out&mdash;seeing
  he wanted to sell so bad?"</p>

  <p>"This wantin' to sell is something I never heard of b'fore," Slim said
  slowly. "To hear him tell it, that ranch uh hisn was worth a dollar an inch,
  by golly. I don't b'lieve he's been wantin' to sell out. If he had, Mis'
  Bixby woulda said something about it. She don't know about this here sellin'
  business, or she'd a said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yeah, you can most generally bank on the Countess telling all she knows,"
  Cal assented with some sarcasm; at which Slim grunted and turned sulky
  afterward.</p>

  <p>Denson and his affairs they speedily forgot for a time, in the diversion
  which Rusty Brown's familiar place afforded to young men with unjaded nerves
  and a zest for the primitive pleasures. Not until mid-afternoon did it occur
  to them that Flying U coulee was deserted by all save old Patsy, and that
  there were chores to be done, if all the creatures of the coulee would sleep
  in comfort that night. Pink, therefore, withdrew his challenge to the bunch,
  and laid his billiard cue down with a sigh and the remark that all he lacked
  was time, to have the scalps of every last one of them hanging from his belt.
  Pink was figurative in his speech, you will understand; and also a bit
  vainglorious over beating Andy Green and Big Medicine twice in
  succession.</p>

  <p>It occurred to Weary then that a word of cheer to the Old Man and his
  anxious watchers might not come amiss. Therefore the Happy Family mounted and
  rode to the depot to send it, and on the way wrangled over the wording of the
  message after their usual contentious manner.</p>

  <p>"Better tell 'em everything is fine, at this end uh the line," Cal
  suggested, and was hooted at for a poet.</p>

  <p>"Just say," Weary began, when he was interrupted by the discordant clamor
  from a trainload of sheep that had just pulled in and stopped. "'Maa-aa,
  Ma-a-aaa,' darn yuh," he shouted derisively, at the peering, plaintive faces,
  glimpsed between the close-set bars. "Mamma, how I do love sheep!" Whereupon
  he put spurs to his horse and galloped down to the station to rid his ears of
  the turbulent wave of protest from the cars.</p>

  <p>Naturally it required some time to compose the telegram in a style
  satisfactory to all parties. Outside, cars banged together, an engine snorted
  stertorously, and suffocating puffs of coal smoke now and then invaded the
  waiting-room while the Happy Family were sending that message of cheer to
  Chicago. If you are curious, the final version of their combined sentiments
  was not at all spectacular. It said merely:</p>

  <p>"Everything fine here. Take good care of the Old Man. How's the Kid
  stacking up?"</p>

  <p>It was signed simply "The Bunch."</p>

  <p>"Mary's little lambs are here yet, I see," the Native Son remarked
  carelessly when they went out. "Enough lambs for all the Marys in the
  country. How would you like to be Mary?"</p>

  <p>"Not for me," Irish declared, and turned his face away from the stench of
  them.</p>

  <p>Others there were who rode the length of the train with faces averted and
  looks of disdain; cowmen, all of them, they shared the range prejudice, and
  took no pains to hide it.</p>

  <p>The wind blew strong from the east, that day; it whistled through the
  open, double-decked cars packed with gray, woolly bodies, whose voices were
  ever raised in strident complaint; and the stench of them smote the
  unaccustomed nostrils of the Happy Family and put them to disgusted flight up
  the track and across it to where the air was clean again.</p>

  <p>"Honest to grandma, I'd make the poorest kind of a sheepherder," Big
  Medicine bawled earnestly, when they were well away from the noise and smell
  of the detested animals. "If I had to herd sheep, by cripes, do you know what
  I'd do? I'd haze 'em into a coulee and turn loose with a good rifle and
  plenty uh shells, and call in the coyotes to git a square meal. That's the
  way I'd herd sheep. It's the only way you can shut 'em up. They just 'baa-aa,
  baa-aa, baa-aa' from the time they're dropped till somebody kills 'em off.
  Honest, they blat in their sleep. I've heard 'em."</p>

  <p>"When you and the dogs were shooting off coyotes?" asked Andy Green
  pointedly, and so precipitated dissension which lasted for ten miles.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">V. &mdash; SHEEP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SLIM, rising first from dinner on the next day but one,
  opened the door of the mess-house, and stood there idly picking his teeth
  before he went about his work. After a minute of listening to the boys
  "joshing" old Patsy about some gooseberry pies he had baked without sugar, he
  turned his face outward, threw up his head like a startled bull, and began to
  sniff.</p>

  <p>"Say, I smell sheep, by golly!" he announced in the bellowing tone which
  was his conversational voice, and sniffed again.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's just a left-over in your system from the dose yuh got in town
  Sunday," Weary explained soothingly. "I've smelled sheep, and tasted sheep,
  and dreamed sheep, ever since."</p>

  <p>"No, by golly, it's sheep! It ain't no memory. I&mdash;I b'hieve I hear
  'em, too, by golly." Slim stepped out away from the building and faced
  suspiciously down the coulee.</p>

  <p>"Slim, I never suspected you of imagination before," the Native Son
  drawled, and loitered out to where Slim stood still sniffing. "I wonder if
  you're catching it from Andy and me. Don't you think you ought to be
  vaccinated?"</p>

  <p>"That ain't imagination," Pink called out from within. "When anybody
  claims there's sheep in Flying U coulee, that's straight loco."</p>

  <p>"Come on out here and smell 'em yourself, then!" Slim bawled indignantly.
  "I never seen such an outfit as this is gittin' to be; you fellers don't
  believe nobody, no more. We ain't all Andy Greens."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this Andy pushed back his chair and strolled outside. He
  clapped his hand down upon Slim's fat-cushioned shoulder and swayed him
  gently. "Never mind, Slim; you can't all be famous," he comforted. "Some day,
  maybe, I'll teach yuh the fine art of lying more convincingly than the
  ordinary man can tell the truth. It is a fine art; it takes a genius to put
  it across. Now, the only time anybody doubts my word is when I'm sticking to
  the truth hike a sand burr to a dog's tail."</p>

  <p>From away to the west, borne on the wind which swept steadily down the
  coulee, came that faint, humming sing-song, which can be made only by a herd
  of a thousand or more sheep, all blatting in different keys&mdash;or by a
  distant band playing monotonously upon the middle octave of their varied
  instruments.</p>

  <p>"Slim's right, by gracious! It's sheep, sure as yuh live." Andy did not
  wait for more, but started at a fast walk for the stable and his horse. After
  him went the Native Son, who had not been with the Flying U long enough to
  sense the magnitude of the affront, and Slim, who knew to a nicety just what
  "cowmen" considered the unpardonable sin, and the rest of the Happy Family,
  who were rather incredulous still.</p>

  <p>"Must be some fool herder just crossing the coulee, on the move
  somewhere," Weary gave as a solution. "Half of 'em don't know a fence when
  they see it."</p>

  <p>As they galloped toward the sound and the smell, they expressed freely
  their opinion of sheep, the men who owned them, and the lunatics who watched
  over the blatting things. They were cattlemen to the marrow in their bones,
  and they gloried in their prejudice against the woolly despoilers of the
  range.</p>

  <p>All these years had the Flying U been immune from the nuisance, save for
  an occasional trespasser, who was quickly sent about his business. The Flying
  U range had been kept in the main inviolate from the little, gray vandals,
  which ate the grass clean to the sod, and trampled with their sharp-pointed
  hoofs the very roots into lifelessness; which polluted the water-holes and
  creeks until cattle and horses went thirsty rather than drink; which, in that
  land of scant rainfall, devastated the range where they fed so that a
  long-established prairie-dog town was not more barren. What wonder if the men
  who owned cattle, and those who tended them, hated sheep? So does the farmer
  dread an invasion of grasshoppers.</p>

  <p>A mile down the coulee they came upon the band with two herders and four
  dogs keeping watch. Across the coulee and up the hillsides they spread like a
  noisome gray blanket. "Maa-aa, maa- aa, maa-aa," two thousand strong they
  blatted a strident medley while they hurried here and there after sweeter
  bunches of grass, very much like a disturbed ant-hill.</p>

  <p>The herders loitered upon either slope, their dogs lying close beside
  them. There was good grass in that part of the coulee; the Flying U had saved
  it for the saddle horses that were to be gathered and held temporarily at the
  ranch; for it would save herding, and a week in that pasture would put a keen
  edge on their spirits for the hard work of the calf roundup. A dozen or two
  that ranged close had already been driven into the field and were feeding
  disdainfully in a corner as far away from the sheep as the fence would
  permit.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family, riding close-grouped, stiffened in their saddles and
  stared amazed at the outrage.</p>

  <p>"Sheepherders never did have any nerve," Irish observed after a minute.
  "They keep their places fine! They'll drive their sheep right into your
  dooryard and tell 'em to help themselves to anything that happens to look
  good to them. Oh, they're sure modest and retiring!"</p>

  <p>Weary, who had charge of the outfit during Chip's absence, was making
  straight for the nearest herder. Pink and Andy went with him, as a matter of
  course.</p>

  <p>"You fellows ride up around that side, and put the run on them sheep,"
  Weary shouted back to the others. "We'll start the other side moving. Make
  'em travel&mdash;back where they came from." He jerked his head toward the
  north. He knew, just as they all knew, that there had been no sheep to the
  south, unless one counted those that ranged across the Missouri river.</p>

  <p>As the three forced their horses up the steep slope, the herder, sitting
  slouched upon a rock, glanced up at them dully. He had a long stick, with
  which he was apathetically turning over the smaller stones within his reach,
  and as apathetically killing the black bugs that scuttled out from the moist
  earth beneath. He desisted from this unexciting pastime as they drew near,
  and eyed them with the sullenness that comes of long isolation when the
  person's nature forbids that other extreme of babbling garrulity, for no man
  can live long months alone and remain perfectly normal. Nature, that stern
  mistress, always exacts a penalty from us foolish mortals who would ignore
  the instincts she has wisely implanted within us for our good.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," Weary began mildly and without preface, "you don't know this is
  private property. Get busy with your dogs, and haze these sheep back on the
  bench." He waved his hand to the north. "And, when you get a good start in
  that direction," he added, "yuh better keep right on going."</p>

  <p>The herder surveyed him morosely, but he said nothing; neither did he rise
  from the rock to obey the command. The dogs sat upon their haunches and
  perked their ears inquiringly, as if they understood better than did their
  master that these men were not to be quite overlooked.</p>

  <p>"I meant to-day," Weary hinted, with the manner of one who deliberately
  holds his voice quiet.</p>

  <p>"I never asked yuh what yuh meant," the herder mumbled, scowling. "We got
  to keep 'em on water another hour, yet." He went back to turning over the
  small rocks and to pursuing with his stick the bugs, as if the whole subject
  were squeezed dry of interest.</p>

  <p>For a minute Weary stared unwinkingly down at him, uncertain whether to
  resent this as pure insolence, or to condone it as imbecility. "Mamma!" he
  breathed eloquently, and grinned at Andy and Pink. "This is a real talkative
  cuss, and obliging, too. Come on, boys; he's too busy to bother with a little
  thing like sheep."</p>

  <p>He led the way around to the far side of the band, the nearest sheep
  scuttling away from then as they passed. "I don't suppose we could work the
  combination on those dogs&mdash;what?" he considered aloud, glancing back at
  them where they still sat upon their haunches and watched the strange riders.
  "Say, Cadwalloper, you took a few lessons in sheepherding, a couple of years
  ago, when you was stuck on that girl&mdash;remember? Whistle 'em up here and
  set 'en to work."</p>

  <p>"You go to the devil," Pink's curved hips replied amiably to his boss.
  "I've got loss-uh-memory on the sheep business."</p>

  <p>Whereat Weary grinned and said no more about it.</p>

  <p>On the opposite side of the coulee, the boys seemed to be laboring quite
  as fruitlessly with the other herder. They heard Big Medicine's truculent
  bellow, as he leaned from the saddle and waved a fist close to the face of
  the herder, but, though they rode with their eyes fixed upon the group, they
  failed to see any resultant movement of dogs, sheep or man.</p>

  <p>There is, at times, a certain safety in being the hopeless minority.
  Though seven indignant cowpunchers surrounded him, that herder was secure
  from any personal molestation&mdash;and he knew it. They were seven against
  one; therefore, after making some caustic remarks, which produced as little
  effect as had Weary's command upon the first man, the seven were constrained
  to ride here and there along the wavering, gray line, and, with shouts and
  swinging ropes, themselves drive the sheep from the coulee.</p>

  <p>There was much clamor and dust and riding to and fro. There was language
  which would have made the mothers of then weep, and there were faces grown
  crimson from wrath. Eventually, however, the Happy Family faced the north
  fence of the Flying U boundary, and saw the last woolly back scrape under the
  lower wire, leaving a toll of greasy wool hanging from the barbs.</p>

  <p>The herders had drawn together, and were looking on from a distance, and
  the four dogs were yelping uneasily over their enforced inaction. The Happy
  Family went back and rounded up the herders, and by sheer weight of numbers
  forced them to the fence without laying so much as a finger upon then. The
  one who had been killing black bugs gave then an ugly look as he crawled
  through, but even he did not say anything.</p>

  <p>"Snap them wires down where they belong," Weary commanded tersely.</p>

  <p>The man hesitated a minute, then sullenly unhooked the barbs of the two
  lower strands, so that the wires, which had thus been lifted to permit the
  passing of the sheep, twanged apart and once more stretched straight from
  post to post.</p>

  <p>"Now, just keep in mind the fact that fences are built for use. This is a
  private ranch, and sheep are just about as welcome as smallpox. Haze them
  stinking things as far north as they'll travel before dark, and at daylight
  start 'em going again. Where's your camp, anyhow?"</p>

  <p>"None of your business," mumbled the bugkiller sourly.</p>

  <p>Weary scanned the undulating slope beyond the fence, saw no sign of a
  camp, and glanced uncertainly at his fellows. "Well, it don't matter much
  where it is; you see to it you don't sleep within five miles of here, or
  you're liable to have bad dreams. Hit the trail, now!"</p>

  <p>They waited inside the fence until the retreating sheep lost their
  individuality as blatting animals, ambling erratically here and there, while
  they moved toward the brow of the hill, and merged into a great, gray blotch
  against the faint green of the new grass&mdash;a blotch from which rose again
  that vibrant, sing-song humming of many voices mingled. Then they rode back
  down the coulee to their own work, taking it for granted that the trespassing
  was an incident which would not be repeated&mdash;by those particular sheep,
  at any rate.</p>

  <p>It was, therefore, with something of a shock that the Happy Family awoke
  the next morning to hear Pink's melodious treble shouting in the bunk-house
  at sunrise next morning:</p>

  <p>"'G'wa-a-y round' 'em, Shep! Seven black ones in the coulee!" Men who know
  well the West are familiar with that facetious call.</p>

  <p>"Ah, what's the matter with yuh?" Irish raised a rumpled, brown head from
  his pillow, and blinked sleepily at him. "I've been dreaming I was a
  sheepherder, all night."</p>

  <p>"Well, you've got the swellest chance in the world to 'make every dream
  come true, dearie,'" Pink retorted. "The whole blamed coulee's full uh sheep.
  I woke up a while ago and thought I just imagined I heard 'em again; so I
  went out to take a look&mdash;or a smell, it was&mdash;and they're sure
  enough there!"</p>

  <p>Weary swung one long leg out from under his blankets and reached for his
  clothes. He did not say anything, but his face portended trouble for the
  invaders.</p>

  <p>"Say!" cried Big Medicine, coming out of his bunk as if it were afire, "I
  tell yuh right now them blattin' human apes wouldn't git gay around here if I
  was runnin' this outfit. The way I'd have of puttin' them sheep on the run
  wouldn't be slow, by cripes! I'll guarantee&mdash;"</p>

  <p>By then the bunk-house was buzzing with voices, and there was none to give
  heed to Big Medicine's blatant boasting. Others there were who seemed rather
  inclined to give Weary good advice while they pulled on their boots and
  sought for their gloves and rolled early-morning cigarettes, and otherwise
  prepared themselves for what Fate might have waiting for them outside the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure they're in the coulee, Cadwalloper?" Weary asked, during a
  brief lull. "They could be up on the hill&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hell, yes!" was Pink's forceful answer. "They could be on the hill, but
  they ain't. Why, darn it, they're straggling into the little pasture! I could
  see 'em from the stable. They&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come and eat your breakfast first, boys, anyway." Weary had his hand upon
  the door-knob. "A few minutes more won't make any difference, one way or the
  other." He went out and over to the mess-house to see if Patsy had the coffee
  ready; for this was a good three-quarters of an hour earlier than the Flying
  U outfit usually bestirred themselves on these days of preparation for
  roundup and waiting for good grass.</p>

  <p>"I'll be darned if I'd be as calm as he is," Cal Emmett muttered while the
  door was being closed. "Good thing the Old Man ain't here, now. He'd go
  straight up in the air. He wouldn't wait for no breakfast."</p>

  <p>"I betche there'll be a killin' yet, before we're through with them
  sheep," gloomed Happy Jack. "When sheepherders starts in once to be ornery,
  there ain't no way uh stoppin' 'em except by killin' 'em off. And that'll
  mean the pen for a lot of us fellers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly, it won't be me," Slim declared loudly. "Yuh wouldn't
  ketch me goin' t' jail for no doggone sheepherder. They oughta be a bounty on
  'em by rights."</p>

  <p>"Seems queer they'd be right back here this morning, after being hazed out
  yesterday afternoon," said Andy Green thoughtfully. "Looks like they're plumb
  anxious to build a lot of trouble for themselves."</p>

  <p>Patsy, thumping energetically the bottom of a tin pan, sent them trooping
  to the mess-house. There it was evident that the breakfast had been unduly
  hurried; there were no biscuits in sight, for one thing, though Patsy was
  lumbering about the stove frying hot-cakes. They were in too great a hurry to
  wait for them, however. They swallowed their coffee hurriedly, bolted a few
  mouthfuls of meat and fried eggs, and let it go at that.</p>

  <p>Weary looked at then with a faint smile. "I'm going to give a few of you
  fellows a chance to herd sheep to-day," he announced, cooling his coffee so
  that it would not actually scald his palate. "That's why I wanted you to get
  some grub into you. Some of you fellows will have to take the trail up on the
  hill, and meet us outside the fence, so when we chase 'em through you can
  make a good job of it this time. I wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't need to call out the troops for that job; one man is enough to
  put the fear uh the Lord into then herders," Andy remarked slightingly. "Once
  they're on the move&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right, my boy; we'll let you be the man," Weary told him promptly. "I
  was going to have a bunch of you take a packadero outfit down toward Boiler
  Bottom and comb the breaks along there for horses&mdash;and I sure do hate to
  spend the whole day chasing sheepherders around over the country. So we'll
  haze 'em through the fence again, and, seeing you feel that way about it,
  I'll let you go around and keep 'em going. And, if you locate their camp,
  kinda impress it on the tender, if you can round him up, that the Flying U
  ain't pasturing sheep this spring. No matter what kinda talk he puts up, you
  put the run on 'em till you see 'em across One-Man coulee. Better have Patsy
  put you up a lunch&mdash;unless you're fond of mutton."</p>

  <p>Andy twisted his mouth disgustedly. "Say, I'm going to quit handing out
  any valuable advice to you, Weary," he expostulated.</p>

  <p>"Haw-haw-haw-w-w!" laughed Big Medicine, and slapped Andy on the shoulder
  so that his face almost came in contact with his plate. "Yuh will try to work
  some innercent man into sheepherdin', will yuh? Haw-haw-haw-w! You'll come in
  tonight blattin'&mdash;if yuh don't stay out on the range tryin' t' eat
  grass, by cripes! Andy had a little lamb that follered him around&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Better let Bud take that herdin' job, Weary," Andy suggested. "It won't
  hurt him&mdash;he's blattin' already."</p>

  <p>"If you think you're liable to need somebody along," Weary began,
  soft-heartedly relenting, "why, I guess&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If I can't handle two crazy sheepherders without any help, by gracious,
  I'll get me a job holdin' yarn in an old ladies' hone," Andy cut in hastily,
  and got up from the table. "Being a truthful man, I can't say I'm stuck on
  the job; but I'm game for it. And I'll promise you there won't be no more
  sheep of that brand lickin' our doorsteps. What darned outfit is it, anyway?
  I never bumped into any Dot sheep before, to my knowledge."</p>

  <p>"It's a new one on me," Weary testified, heading the procession down to
  the stable. "If they belonged anywhere in this part of the country, though,
  they wouldn't be acting the way they are. They'd be wise to the fact that it
  ain't healthy."</p>

  <p>Even while he spoke his eyes were fixed with cold intensity upon a fringe
  of gray across the coulee below the little pasture. To the nostrils of the
  outraged Happy Family was borne that indescribable aroma which betrays the
  presence of sheep; that aroma which sheepmen love and which cattlemen hate,
  and which a favorable wind will carry a long way.</p>

  <p>They slapped saddles on their horses in record time that morning, and
  raced down the coulee ironically shouting commiserating sentences to the
  unfortunate Andy, who rode slowly up to the mess-house for the lunch which
  Patsy had waiting for him in a flour sack, and afterward climbed the grade
  and loped along outside the line fence to a point opposite the sheep and the
  shouting horsemen, who forced them back by weight of numbers.</p>

  <p>This morning the herders were not quite so passive. The bug-killer still
  scowled, but he spoke without the preliminary sulky silence of the day
  before,</p>

  <p>"We're goin' across the coulee," he growled. "Them's orders. We range
  south uh here."</p>

  <p>"No, you don't," Weary dissented calmly. "Not by a long shot, you don't.
  You're going back where you come from&mdash;if you ask me. And you're going
  quick!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6">VI. &mdash; WHAT HAPPENED TO ANDY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WITH the sun shining comfortably upon his back, and with a
  cigarette between his lips, Andy sat upon his horse and watched in silent
  glee while the irate Happy Family scurried here and there behind the band,
  swinging their ropes down upon the woolly backs, and searching their
  vocabularies for new and terrible epithets. Andy smiled broadly as a colorful
  phrase now and then boomed across the coulee in that clear, snappy
  atmosphere, which carries sounds so far. He did not expect to do much smiling
  upon his own account, that day, and he was therefore grateful for the
  opportunity to behold the spectacle before him.</p>

  <p>There was Slim, for instance, unwillingly careening down hill toward home,
  because, in his zeal to slap an old ewe smartly with his rope, he drove her
  unexpectedly under his horse, and so created a momentary panic that came near
  standing both horse and rider upon their heads. And there was Big Medicine
  whistling until he was purple, while the herder, with a single gesture, held
  the dog motionless, though a dozen sheep broke back from the band and climbed
  a slope so steep that Big Medicine was compelled to go after them afoot, and
  turn them with stones and profane objurgations.</p>

  <p>It was very funny&mdash;when one could sit at ease upon the hilltop and
  smoke a cigarette while others risked apoplexy and their souls' salvation
  below. By the time they panted up the last rock-strewn slope of the bluff,
  and sent the vanguard of the invaders under the fence, Andy's mood was
  complacent in the extreme, and his smile offensively wide.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you needn't look so sorry for us," drawled the Native Son, jingling
  over toward him until only the fence and a few feet of space divided them.
  "Here's where you get yours, amigo. I wish you a pleasant day&mdash;and a
  long one!" He waved his hand in mocking adieu, touched his horse with his
  silver spurs, and rode gaily away down the coulee.</p>

  <p>"Here, sheepherder's your outfit. Ma-aa-a-a!" jeered Big Medicine. "You'll
  wisht, by cripes, you was a dozen men just like yuh before you're through
  with the deal. Haw-haw-haw-w!"</p>

  <p>There were others who, seeing Andy's grin, had something to say upon the
  subject before they left.</p>

  <p>Weary rode up, and looked undecidedly from Andy to the sheep, and back
  again.</p>

  <p>"If you don't feel like tackling it single-handed, I'll send&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What do yuh think I am, anyway ?" Andy interrupted crisply, "a Montgomery
  Ward two-for-a-quarter cowpuncher? Don't you fellows waste any time worrying
  over me!"</p>

  <p>The herders stared at Andy curiously when he swung in behind the tail-end
  of the band and kept pace with their slow moving, but they did not speak
  beyond shouting an occasional command to their dogs. Neither did Andy have
  anything to say, until he saw that they were swinging steadily to the west,
  instead of keeping straight north, as they had been told to do. Then he rode
  over to the nearest herder, who happened to be the bug-killer.</p>

  <p>"You don't want to get turned around," he hinted quietly. "That's north,
  over there."</p>

  <p>"I'm workin' fer the man that pays my wages," the fellow retorted glumly,
  and waved an arm to a collie that was waiting for orders. The dog dropped his
  head, and ran around the right wing of the band, with sharp yelps and
  dartings here and there, turning them still more to the west.</p>

  <p>Andy hesitated, decided to leave the man alone for the present, and rode
  around to the other herder.</p>

  <p>"You swing these sheep north!" he commanded, disdaining preface or
  explanation.</p>

  <p>"I'm workin' for the man that pays my wages," the herder made answer
  stolidly, and chewed steadily upon a quid of tobacco that had stained his
  lips unbecomingly.</p>

  <p>So they had talked the thing over&mdash;had those two herders&mdash;and
  were following a premeditated plan of defiance! Andy hooked at the man a
  minute. "You turn them sheep, damn you," he commanded again, and laid a hand
  upon his saddle-horn suggestively.</p>

  <p>"You go to the devil, damn yuh," advised the herder, and cocked a wary eye
  at him from under his hat-brim. Not all herders, let it be said in passing,
  take unto themselves the mental attributes of their sheep; there are those
  who believe that a bold front is better than weak compliance, and who will
  back that belief by a very bold front indeed.</p>

  <p>Andy appraised him mentally, decided that he was an able-bodied man and
  therefore fightable, and threw his right leg over the cantle with a quite
  surprising alacrity.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to turn them sheep?" Andy was taking off his coat when he
  made that inquiry.</p>

  <p>"Not for your tellin'. You keep back, young feller, or I'll sick the dogs
  on yuh." He turned and whistled to the nearest one, and Andy hit him on the
  ear.</p>

  <p>They clinched and pummeled when they could and where they could. The dog
  came up, circled the gyrating forms twice, then sat down upon his haunches at
  a safe distance, tilted his head sidewise and lifted his ears interestedly.
  He was a wise little dog; the other dog was also wise, and remained
  phlegmatically at his post, as did the bug-killer.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to turn them sheep?" Andy spoke breathlessly, but with
  deadly significance.</p>

  <p>"N-yes."</p>

  <p>Andy took his fingers from the other's Adam's apple, his knee from the
  other's diaphragm, and went over to where he had thrown down his coat, felt
  in a pocket for his handkerchief, and, when he had found it, applied it to
  his nose, which was bleeding profusely.</p>

  <p>"Fly at it, then," he advised, eyeing the other sternly over the
  handkerchief. "I'd hate to ask you a third time."</p>

  <p>"I'd hate to have yuh," conceded the herder reluctantly. "I was sure I c'd
  lick yuh, or I'd 'a' turned 'em before." He sent the dog racing down the
  south line of the band.</p>

  <p>Andy got thoughtfully back upon his horse, and sat looking hard at the
  herder. "Say, you're a grade above the general run uh lamb- hickers," he
  observed, after a minute. "Who are you working for, and what's your object in
  throwing sheep on Flying U land? There's plenty of range to the north."</p>

  <p>"I'm workin'," said the herder, "for the Dot outfit. I thought you could
  read brands."</p>

  <p>"Don't get sassy&mdash;I've got a punch or two I haven't used yet. Who
  owns these woollies?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;Whittaker and Oleson, if yuh want to know."</p>

  <p>"I do." Andy was keeping pace with him around the band, which edged off
  from them and the dogs. "And what makes you so crazy about Flying U grass?"
  he pursued.</p>

  <p>"We've got to cross that coulee to git to where we're headed for; we got a
  right to, and we're going to do it." The herder paused and glanced up at Andy
  sourly. "We knowed you was a mean outfit; the boss told us so. And he told us
  you was blank ca'tridges and we needn't back up just 'cause you raised up on
  your hind legs and howled a little. I've had truck with you cowmen before.
  I've herded sheep in Wyoming." He walked a few steps with his head down,
  considering.</p>

  <p>"I better go over and talk some sense into the other fellow," he said,
  looking up at Andy as if all his antagonism had oozed in the fight. "You ride
  along this edge, so they won't scatter&mdash;we ought to be grazin' 'em
  along, by rights; only you seem to be in such an all-fired rush&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You go on and tell that loco son-of-a-gun over there what he's up
  against," Andy urged. "Blank cartridges&mdash;I sure do like that! If you
  only knew it, high power dum-dums would be a lot closer to our brand. Run
  along&mdash;I am in a kinda hurry, this morning."</p>

  <p>Andy, riding slowly upon the outskirts of the grazing, blatting band,
  watched the two confer earnestly together a hundred yards or so away. They
  seemed to be having some sort of argument; the bug-killer gesticulated with
  the long stick he carried, and the sheep, while the herders talked, scattered
  irresponsibly. Andy wondered what made sheepmen so "ornery," particularly
  herders. He wondered why the fellow he had thrashed was so insultingly
  defiant at first, and, after the thrashing, so unresentful and communicative,
  and so amenable to authority withal. He felt his nose, and decided that it
  was, all things considered, a cheap victory, and yet one of which he need not
  be ashamed.</p>

  <p>The herder cane back presently and helped drive the sheep over the edge of
  the bluff which bordered Antelope coulee. The bug-killer, upon his side, also
  seemed imbued with the spirit of obedience; Andy heard him curse a collie
  into frenzied zeal, and smiled approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Now you're acting a heap more human," he observed; and the man from
  Wyoming grinned ruefully by way of reply.</p>

  <p>Antelope coulee, at that point, was steep; too steep for riding, so that
  Andy dismounted and dug his boot-heels into the soft soil, to gain a foothold
  on the descent. When he was halfway down, he chanced to look back, straight
  into the scowling gaze of the bug-killer, who was sliding down behind
  him.</p>

  <p>"Thought you were hazing down the other side of 'em," Andy called back,
  but the herder did not choose to answer save with another scowl.</p>

  <p>Andy edged his horse around an impracticable slope of shale stuff and went
  on. The herder followed. When he was within twelve feet or so of the bottom,
  there was a sound of pebbles knocked loose in haste, a scrambling, and then
  came the impact of his body. Andy teetered, lost his balance, and went to the
  bottom in one glorious slide. He landed with the bug-killer on top&mdash;and
  the bug-killer failed to remove his person as speedily as true courtesy
  exacted.</p>

  <p>Andy kicked and wriggled and tried to remember what was that high-colored,
  vituperative sentence that Irish had invented over a stubborn sheep, that he
  might repeat it to the bug-killer. The herder from Wyoming ran up, caught
  Andy's horse, and untied Andy's rope from the saddle.</p>

  <p>"Good fer you, Oscar," he praised the bug-killer. "Hang onto him while I
  take a few turns." He thereupon helped force Andy's arms to his side, and
  wound the rope several times rather tightly around Andy's outraged, squirming
  person.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it ain't goin' to do yuh no good to buck 'n bawl," admonished the
  tier. "I learnt this here little trick down in Wyoming. A bunch uh punchers
  done it to me&mdash;and I've been just achin' all over fer a chance to return
  the favor to some uh you gay boys. And," he added, with malicious
  satisfaction, while he rolled Andy over and tied a perfectly unslippable knot
  behind, "it gives me great pleasure to hand the dose out to you, in
  p'ticular. If I was a mean man, I'd hand yuh the boot a few times fer luck;
  but I'll save that up till next time."</p>

  <p>"You can bet your sweet life there'll be a next time," Andy promised
  earnestly, with embellishments better suited to the occasion than to a
  children's party.</p>

  <p>"Well, when it arrives I'm sure Johnny-on-the-spot. Them Wyoming punchers
  beat me up after they'd got me tied. I'm tellin' yuh so you'll see I ain't
  mean unless I'm drove to it. Turn him feet down hill, Oscar, so he won't git
  a rush uh brains to the head and die on our hands. Now you're goin' to mind
  your own business, sonny. Next time yuh set out to herd sheep, better see the
  boss first and git on the job right."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet, surveyed Andy with his hands on his hips, mentally
  pronounced the job well done, and took a generous chew of tobacco, after
  which he grinned down at the trussed one.</p>

  <p>"That the language uh flowers you're talkin'?" he inquired banteringly,
  before he turned his attention to the horse, which he disposed of by tying up
  the reins and giving it a slap on the rump. When it had trotted fifty yards
  down the coulee bottom, and showed a disposition to go farther, he whistled
  to his dogs, and turned again to Andy.</p>

  <p>"This here is just a hint to that bunch you trot with, to leave us and our
  sheep alone," he said. "We don't pick no quarrels, but we're goin' to cross
  our sheep wherever we dern please, to git where we want to go. Gawd didn't
  make this range and hand it over to you cowmen to put in yer pockets&mdash;I
  guess there's a chance fer other folks to hang on by their eyebrows,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>Andy, lying there like a very good presentation of a giant cocoon, roped
  round and round, with his arms pinned to his sides, had the doubtful pleasure
  of seeing that noisome, foolish-faced band trail down Antelope coulee and
  back upon the level they had just left, and of knowing to a gloomy certainty
  that he could do nothing about it, except swear; and even that palls when a
  man has gone over his entire repertoire three times in rapid succession.</p>

  <p>Andy, therefore, when the last sheep had trotted out of sight, hearing and
  smell, wriggled himself into as comfortable a position as his bonds would
  permit, and took a nap.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7">VII. &mdash; TRUTH CRUSHED TO EARTH, ETC.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ANDY, only half awake, tried to obey both instinct and habit
  and reach up to pull his hat down over his eyes, so that the sun could not
  shine upon his lids so hotly; when he discovered that he could do no more
  than wiggle his fingers, he came back with a jolt to reality and tried to sit
  up. It is surprising to a man to discover suddenly just how important a part
  his arms play in the most simple of body movements; Andy, with his arms
  pinioned tightly the whole length of them, rolled over on his face, kicked a
  good deal, and rolled back again, but he did not sit up, as he had
  confidently expected to do.</p>

  <p>He lay absolutely quiet for at least five minutes, staring up at the
  brilliant blue arch above him. Then he began to speak rapidly and earnestly;
  a man just close enough to hear his voice sweeping up to a certain rhetorical
  climax, pausing there and commencing again with a rhythmic fluency of
  intonation, might have thought that he was repeating poetry; indeed, it
  sounded like some of Milton's majestic blank verse, but it was not. Andy was
  engaged in a methodical, scientific, reprehensibly soul-satisfying period of
  swearing.</p>

  <p>A curlew, soaring low, with long beak outstretched before him and long
  legs outstretched behind, cast a beady eye upon him, and shrilled "Cor-reck!
  Cor-reck!" in unregenerate approbation of the blasphemy.</p>

  <p>Andy stopped suddenly and laughed. "Glad you agree with me, old sport," he
  addressed the bird whimsically, with a reaction to his normally cheerful
  outlook. "Sheepherders are all those things I named over, birdie, and some
  that I can't think of at present."</p>

  <p>He tried again, this time with a more careful realization of his
  limitations, to assume an upright position; and being a persevering young
  man, and one with a ready wit, he managed at length to wriggle himself back
  upon the slope from which he had slid in his sleep, and, by digging in his
  heels and going carefully, he did at last rise upon his knees, and from there
  triumphantly to his feet.</p>

  <p>He had at first believed that one of the herders would, in the course of
  an hour or so, return and untie him, when he hoped to be able to retrieve, in
  a measure, his self-respect, which he had lost when the first three feet of
  his own rope had encircled him. To be tied and trussed by sheepherders! Andy
  gritted his teeth and started down the coulee.</p>

  <p>He was hungry, and his lunch was tied to his saddle. He looked eagerly
  down the coulee, in the faint hope of seeing his horse grazing somewhere
  along its length, until the numbness of his arms and hands reminded him that
  forty lunches, tied upon forty saddles at his side, would be of no use to him
  in his present position. His hands he could not move from his thighs; he
  could wiggle his fingers&mdash;which he did, to relieve as much as possible
  that unpleasant, prickly sensation which we call a "going to sleep" of the
  afflicted members. When it occurred to him that he could not do anything with
  his horse if he found it, he gave up looking for it and started for the
  ranch, walking awkwardly, because of his bonds, the sun shining hotly upon
  his brown head, because his hat had been knocked off in the scuffle, and he
  could not pick it up and put it back where it belonged.</p>

  <p>Taking a straight course across the prairie, he struck Flying U coulee at
  the point where the sheep had left it. On the way there he had crossed their
  trail where they went through the fence farther along the coulee than before,
  and therefore with a better chance of passing undetected; especially since
  the Happy Family, believing that he was forcing them steadily to the north,
  would not be watching for sheep. The barbed wire barrier bothered him
  somewhat. He was compelled to lie down and roll under the fence, in the most
  undignified manner, and, when he was through, there was the problem of
  getting upon his feet again. But he managed it somehow, and went on down the
  coulee, perspiring with the heat and a bitter realization of his ignominy.
  What the Happy Family would have to say when they saw him, even Andy Green's
  vivid imagination declined to picture.</p>

  <p>He knew by the sun that it was full noon when he came in sight of the
  stable and corrals, and his soul sickened at the thought of facing that
  derisive bunch of punchers, with their fiendish grins and their barbed
  tongues. But he was hungry, and his arms had reached the limit of prickly
  sensations and were numb to his shoulders. He shook his hair back from his
  beaded forehead, cast a wary glance at the silent stables, set his jaw, and
  went on up the hill to the mess-house, wishing tardily that he had waited
  until they were off at work again, when he might intimidate old Patsy into
  keeping quiet about his predicament.</p>

  <p>Within the mess-house was the clatter of knives and forks plied by hungry
  men, the sound of desultory talk and a savory odor of good things to eat. The
  door was closed. Andy stood before it as a guilty-conscienced child stands
  before its teacher; clicked his teeth together, and, since he could not open
  the door, lifted his right foot and gave it a kick to strain the hinges.</p>

  <p>Within were exclamations of astonishment, silence and then a heavy tread.
  Patsy opened the door, gasped and stood still, his eyes popping out like a
  startled rabbit.</p>

  <p>"Well, what's eating you?" Andy demanded querulously, and pushed past him
  into the room.</p>

  <p>Not all of the Happy Family were there. Cal, Jack Bates, Irish and Happy
  Jack had gone into the Bad Lands next to the river; but there were enough
  left to make the soul of Andy quiver forebodingly, and to send the flush of
  extreme humiliation to his cheeks.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family looked at him in stunned surprise; then they glanced at
  one another in swift, wordless inquiry, grinned wisely and warily, and went
  on with their dinner. At least they pretended to go on with their dinner,
  while Andy glared at them with amazed reproach in his misleadingly honest
  gray eyes.</p>

  <p>"When you've got plenty of time," he said at last in a choked tone, "maybe
  one of you obliging cusses will untie this damned rope."</p>

  <p>"Why, sure!" Pink threw a leg over the bench and got up with cheerful
  alacrity. "I'll do it now, if you say so; I didn't know but what that was
  some new fad of yours, like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fad!" Andy repeated the word like an explosion.</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly, Andy needn't think I'm goin' to foller that there style,"
  Slim stated solemnly. "I need m' rope for something else than to tie n'
  clothes on with."</p>

  <p>"I sure do hate to see a man wear funny things just to make himself
  conspicuous," Pink observed, while he fumbled at the knot, which was
  intricate. Andy jerked away from him that he might face him ragefully.</p>

  <p>"Maybe this looks funny to you," he cried, husky with wrath. "But I can't
  seem to see the joke, myself. I admit I let then herders make a monkey of
  me.... They slipped up behind, going down into Antelope coulee, and slid down
  the bluff onto me; and, before I could get up, they got me tied, all right. I
  licked one of 'em before that, and thought I had 'em gentled down&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andy stopped short, silenced by that unexplainable sense which warns us
  when our words are received with cold disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Mh-hm&mdash;I thought maybe you'd run up against a hostile jackrabbit, or
  something," Pink purred, and went back to his place on the bench.</p>

  <p>"Haw-haw-haw-w-w!" came Big Medicine's tardy bellow. "That's more
  reasonable than the sheepherder story, by cripes!"</p>

  <p>Andy looked at them much as he had stared up at the sky before he began to
  swear&mdash;speechlessly, with a trembling of the muscles around his mouth.
  He was quite white, considering how tanned he was, and his forehead was
  shiny, with beads of perspiration standing thickly upon it.</p>

  <p>"Weary, I wish you'd untie this rope. I can't." He spoke still in that
  peculiar, husky tone, and, when the last words were out, his teeth went
  together with a snap.</p>

  <p>Weary glanced inquiringly across at the Native Son, who was regarding Andy
  steadily, as one gazes upon a tangled rope, looking for the end which will
  easiest lead to an untangling.</p>

  <p>Miguel's brown eyes turned languidly to meet the look. "You'd better untie
  him," he advised in his soft drawl. "He may not be in the habit of doing
  it&mdash;but he's telling the truth."</p>

  <p>"Untie me, Miguel," begged Andy, going over to him, "and let me at this
  bunch."</p>

  <p>"I'll do it," said Weary, and rose pacifically. "I kinda believe you
  myself, Andy. But you can't blame the boys none; you've fooled 'em till
  they're dead shy of anything they can't see through. And, besides, it sure
  does look like a plant. I'd back you single-handed against a dozen
  sheepherders like them two we've been chasing around. If I hadn't felt that
  way I wouldn't have sent yuh out alone with 'em."</p>

  <p>"Well, Andy needn't think he's goin' to stick me on that there story,"
  Slim declared with brutal emphasis. "I've swallered too many baits, by golly.
  He's figurin' on gettin' us all out on the war-path, runnin' around in
  circles, so's't he can give us the laugh. I'll bet, by golly, he paid them
  herders to tie him up like that. He can't fool me!"</p>

  <p>"Say, Slim, I do believe your brains is commencin' to sprout!" Big
  Medicine thumped him painfully upon the back by way of accenting the
  compliment. "You got the idee, all right."</p>

  <p>Andy stood quiet while Weary unwound the rope; lifted his numbed arms with
  some difficulty, and displayed to the doubters his rope-creased wrists, and
  purple, swollen hands.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't fight a caterpiller right now," he said thickly. "Look at them
  hands! Do yuh call that a josh? I've been tied up like a bed-roll for five
  hours, you&mdash;" Well, never mind, he merely repeated a part of what he had
  recited aloud in Antelope coulee, the only difference being that he applied
  the vitriolic utterances to the Happy Family instead of to sheepherders, and
  that with the second recitation he gained much in fluency and dramatic
  delivery.</p>

  <p>It is not nice for a man to swear; to swear the way Andy did, at any rate.
  But the result perhaps atoned in a measure for the wickedness, in that the
  Happy Family were absolutely convinced of his sincerity, and the feelings of
  Andy greatly relieved, so that, when he had for the third time that day
  completely exhausted his vocabulary, he sat down and began to eat his dinner
  with a keen appetite.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you know where your horse is at, by this tine," Weary
  observed, as casually as possible, breaking a somewhat constrained
  silence.</p>

  <p>"I don't&mdash;and I don't give a darn," Andy snapped back. He ate a few
  mouthfuls, and added less savagely: "He wasn't in sight, as I came along. I
  didn't follow the trail; I struck straight across and came down the coulee.
  He may be at the gate, and he may be down toward Rogers'."</p>

  <p>Pink reached for a toothpick, eyeing Andy side-long; dimpled his cheeks
  disarmingly, and cleared his throat. "Please don't kill me off when you get
  that pie swallowed," he began pacifically. "Strange as it may seem, I believe
  you, Andy. What I want to know is this: Who owns them Dots? And what are they
  chasing all over the Flying U range for? It looks plumb malicious, to me. Did
  you find out anything about 'en, Andy, while you&mdash;er&mdash;while
  they&mdash;" His eyes twinkled and betrayed him for an arrant pretender.
  (Pink was not afraid of anything on earth&mdash;least of all Andy Green.)</p>

  <p>"I will kill yuh by inches, if I hear any remarks out of yuh that ain't
  respectful," Andy promised, thawing to his normal tone, which was pleasant to
  the ear. "I didn't find out much about 'em. The fellow I licked told me that
  Whittaker and Oleson owned the sheep. He didn't say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;by&mdash;golly!" Slim thrust his head forward belligerently.
  "Whittaker! Well, what d'yuh think uh that!" He glared from one face to the
  other, his gaze at last resting upon Weary. "Say, do yuh reckon
  it's&mdash;Dunk?"</p>

  <p>Weary paid no heed to Slim. He leaned forward, his face turned to Andy
  with that concentration of attention which means so much more than mere
  exclamation. "You're sure he said Whittaker?" he asked.</p>

  <p>His tone and his attitude arrested Andy's cup midway to his mouth.
  "Sure&mdash;Whittaker and Oleson. I never heard of the outfit&mdash;who's
  this Whittaker person?"</p>

  <p>Weary settled back in his place and smiled, but his eyes had quite lost
  their habitually sunny expression.</p>

  <p>"Up until four years ago," he explained evenly, "he was the Old Man's
  partner. We caught him in some mighty dirty work, and&mdash;well, he sold out
  to the Old Man. The old party with the hoofs and tail can't be everywhere at
  once, the way I've got it sized up, so he turns some of his business over to
  other folks. Dunk Whittaker's his top hand."</p>

  <p>"Why, by golly, he framed up a job on the Gordon boys, and railroaded 'em
  to the pen, just&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's the gazabo!" Andy's eyes shone with enlightenment. "I've heard
  a lot about Dunk, but I didn't know his last name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say! I'll bet they're the outfit that bought out Denson. That's why old
  Denson acted so queer, maybe. Selling to a sheep outfit would make the old
  devil feel kinda uneasy, talking to us&mdash;" Pink's eyes were big and
  purple with excitement. "And that train-load of sheep we saw Sunday, I'll bet
  is the same identical outfit."</p>

  <p>"Dunk Whittaker'd better not try to monkey with me, by golly!" Slim's face
  was lowering. "And he'd better not monkey with the Flying U either. I'd pump
  him so full uh holes he'd look like a colander, by golly!"</p>

  <p>Weary got up and started to the door, his face suddenly grown careworn.
  "Slim, you and Miguel better go and hunt up Andy's horse," he said with a
  hint of abstraction in his tone, as though his mind was busy with more
  important things. "Maybe Andy'll feel able to help you set those posts,
  Bud&mdash;and you'd better go along the upper end of the little pasture with
  the wire stretchers and tighten her up; the top wire is pretty loose, I
  noticed this morning." His fingers fumbled with the door-knob.</p>

  <p>"Want me to do anything?" Pink asked quizzically just behind him. "I
  thought sure we'd go and remonstrate with them gay&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Weary interrupted him. "The herders can wait&mdash;and, anyway, I've kinda
  got an idea Andy wants to hand out his own brand of poison to that bunch. You
  and I will take a ride over to Denson's and see what's going on over there.
  Mamma!" he added fervently, under his breath, "I sure do wish Chip and the
  Old Man were here!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">VIII. &mdash; THE DOT OUTFIT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BEFORE he laid him down to sleep, that night, Weary had
  repeated to himself many times and fervently that wish for old J. G. Whitmore
  and the stout staff upon which he was beginning more and more to lean, his
  brother-in-law, Chip Bennett. As matters stood, Weary could not even bring
  himself to let them know anything about his trouble&mdash;and that the thing
  was beginning to assume the form and shape and general malevolent attributes
  of Trouble, Weary was forced to admit to himself.</p>

  <p>Just at present an unthinking, unobserving person might pass over this
  sheep outfit as a mere unsavory incident; but Weary was neither unobserving
  nor unthinking&mdash;nor, for the matter of that, were the rest of the Happy
  Family. It needed no Happy Jack, with his foreboding nature, to point out the
  unpleasant possibilities that night when the committee of two made their
  informal report at the supper table.</p>

  <p>They had ridden to Denson coulee, which was in reality a meandering branch
  of Flying U coulee itself. To reach it one rode out of Flying U coulee and
  over a wide hill, and down again to Denson's. But the creek&mdash;Flying U
  creek&mdash;followed the devious turnings from Denson coulee down to the
  Flying U. A long mile of Flying U coulee J. G. Whitmore owned outright.
  Another mile he held under no other title save a fence. The creek flowed
  through it all&mdash;but that creek had its source somewhere up near the head
  of Denson coulee. J. G. Whitmore had, to his regret, been unable to claim the
  whole earth&mdash;or at least that portion of it&mdash;for his own; so, when
  he was constrained to make a choice, he settled himself in the wider, more
  fertile coulee, which he thereafter called the Flying U. While it is good
  policy to locate as near as possible to the source of those erratic little
  creeks which water certain garden spots of the northern range land, it is
  also well to choose land that will grow plenty of hay. J. G. Whitmore chose
  the hay land, and trusted that providence would insure the water supply.
  Through all these years Flying U creek had never once disappointed him.
  Denson, who settled in the tributary coulee, had not made any difference in
  the water supply, and his stock had consisted of thirty or forty head of
  cattle and horses.</p>

  <p>When Denson sold, however, things might be different. And, if he had sold
  to a sheepman, the change might be unpleasant. If he had sold to Dunk
  Whittaker&mdash;the Flying U boys faced that possibility just as they would
  face any other disaster, undaunted, but grim and unsmiling.</p>

  <p>It was thus that Pink and Weary rode slowly down into Denson coulee. Two
  miles back they had passed the band of Dot sheep, feeding leisurely just
  without the Flying U fence, which was the southern boundary. The bug-killer
  and the other were there, and they noted that the features of that other bore
  witness to the truth of Andy's story of the fight. He regarded them with one
  perfectly good eye and one which was considerably swollen, and grinned a
  swollen grin.</p>

  <p>The two had ridden ten paces past him when Pink pulled up suddenly. "I'm
  going to get off and lick that son-of-a-gun myself, just for luck," he stated
  dispassionately. "I'm going to lick 'em both," he revised while he
  dismounted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, come on, Cadwalloper," Weary dissuaded. "You'll likely have all the
  excitement you need, without that."</p>

  <p>"Here, you hold this fool cayuse. No." He shook his head, cutting short
  further protest. "You're the boss, and you don't want to mix in, and that
  part is all right. But I ain't responsible&mdash;and I sure am going to take
  a fall or two out of these geezers. They're a-w-l-together too stuck on
  themselves to suit me." Pink did not say that he was thinking of Andy, but
  nevertheless a vivid recollection of that unfortunate young man's
  rope-creased wrists and swollen hands sent him toward the herder with long,
  eager strides.</p>

  <p>Pink was not tall, and he was slight and boyish of build; also, his
  cherubic face, topped by tawny curls and lighted by eyes as deeply blue and
  as innocent as a baby's, probably deceived that herder, just as they had
  deceived many another. For Pink was a good deal like a stick of dynamite
  wrapped in white tissue paper and tied with blue ribbon; and Weary was not at
  all uneasy over the outcome, as he watched Pink go clanking back, though he
  loved him well.</p>

  <p>Pink did not waste any time or words on the preliminaries. With a
  delightful frankness of purpose he pulled off his coat and threw it on the
  ground, as he came up, sent his hat after it, and arrived fist first.</p>

  <p>The herder had waited grinning, and he had shouted something to Weary
  about spanking the kid if Weary didn't make him behave. Speedily he became a
  very surprised herder, and a distressed one as well.</p>

  <p>"All right," Pink remarked, a little quick-breathed, when the herder
  decided for the third time to get up. "A friend of mine worked yuh over a
  little, this morning, and I just thought I'd make a better job than he did.
  Your eyes didn't match. They will, now."</p>

  <p>The herder mumbled maledictions after him, but Pink would not even give
  him the satisfaction of resenting it.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to have broken a knuckle against his teeth, darn him," he
  observed ruefully when he was in the saddle again. "Come on, Weary. It won't
  take but a minute to hand a punch or two to that bug-killer, and then I'll
  feel better. They've both got it coming&mdash;come on!" This because Weary
  showed a strong inclination to take the trail and keep it to his destination.
  "Well, I'll go alone, then. I've got to kinda square myself for the way I
  threw it into Andy; and you know blamed well, Weary, they played it low-down
  on him, or they'd never have got that rope on him. And I'm going to lick
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mamma! You sure are a rambunctious person when you feel that way," Weary
  made querulous comment; but he rode over with Pink to where the bug-killer
  was standing with his long stick held in a somewhat menacing manner, and once
  more he held Pink's horse for him.</p>

  <p>Pink was gone longer this time, and he came back with a cut lip and a
  large lump on his forehead; the bug-killer had thrown a small rock with the
  precision which comes of much practice&mdash;such as stoning disobedient
  dogs, and the like&mdash;and, when Pink rushed at him furiously, the herder
  caught him very neatly alongside the head with his stick. These little
  amenities serving merely to whet Pink's appetite for battle, he stopped long
  enough to thrash that particular herder very thoroughly and to his own
  complete satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess I'm ready to go on now," he observed, dimpling rather
  one-sidedly as he got back on his horse.</p>

  <p>"I thought maybe you'd want to whip the dogs, too," Weary told him dryly;
  which was the nearest he came to expressing any disapproval of the incident.
  Weary was a peace-loving soul, whenever peace was compatible with
  self-respect; and it would never have occurred to him to punish strange men
  as summarily as Pink had done.</p>

  <p>"I would, if the dogs were half as ornery as the men," Pink retorted.
  "Say, they hang together like bull snakes and rattlers, don't they? If they
  was human, they'd have helped each other out&mdash;but nothing doing! Do you
  reckon a man could ride up to a couple of our bunch, and thrash one at a time
  without the other fellow having something to say about it?" He turned in the
  saddle and looked back. "So help me, Josephine, I've got a good mind to go
  back and lick them again, for not hanging together like they ought to." But
  the threat was an idle one, and they went on to Denson's, Weary still with
  that anxious look in his eyes, and Pink quite complacent over his
  exploit.</p>

  <p>In Denson coulee was an unwonted atmosphere of activity; heretofore the
  place had been animated chiefly by young Densons engaged in the pursuit of
  pleasure, but now a covered buggy, evidently just arrived, bore mute witness
  to the new order of things. There were more horses about the place, a covered
  wagon or two, three or four men working upon the corral, and, lastly, there
  was one whom Weary recognized the moment he caught sight of him.</p>

  <p>"Looks like a sheep outfit, all right," he said somberly. "And, if that
  ain't old Dunk himself, it's the devil, and that's next thing to him."</p>

  <p>Dunk, they judged, had just arrived with another man whom they did not
  know: a tall man with light hair that hung lank to his collar, a thin,
  sharp-nosed face and a wide mouth, which stretched easily into a smile, but
  which was none the pleasanter for that. When he turned inquiringly toward
  them they saw that he was stoop-shouldered; though not from any deformity,
  but from sheer, slouching lankness. Dunk gave them a swift, sour look from
  under his eyebrows and went on.</p>

  <p>Weary rode straight past the lank man, whom he judged to be Oleson, and
  overtook Dunk Whittaker himself.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Dunk," he said cheerfully, sliding over in the saddle so that a
  foot hung free of the stirrup, as men who ride much have learned to do when
  they stop for a chat, thereby resting while they may. "Back on the old
  stamping ground, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Since you see me here, I suppose I am," Dunk made churlish response.</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to own those Dot sheep, back there on the hill?" Weary
  tilted his head toward home.</p>

  <p>"I happen to own half of them." By then they had reached the gate and Dunk
  passed through and started on to the house.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be in a rush&mdash;come on back and be sociable," Weary called
  out, in the mildest of tones, twisting the reins around his saddle-horn so
  that he might roll a cigarette at ease.</p>

  <p>Dunk remembered, perhaps, certain things he had learned when he was J. G.
  Whitmore's partner, and had more or less to do with the charter members of
  the Happy Family. He came back and stood by the gate, ungraciously enough, to
  be sure; still, he came back. Weary smiled under cover of lighting his
  cigarette. Dunk, by that reluctant compliance, betrayed something which Weary
  had been rather anxious to know.</p>

  <p>"We've been having a little trouble with those sheep of yours," Weary
  remarked between puffs. "You've got some poor excuses for humans herding
  them. They drove the bunch across our coulee just exactly three times. There
  ain't enough grass left in our lower field to graze a prairie dog." He
  glanced back to see where Pink was, saw that he was close behind, as was the
  lank man, and spoke in a tone that included them all.</p>

  <p>"The Flying U ain't pasturing sheep, this spring," he informed them
  pleasantly. "But, seeing the grass is eat up, we'll let yuh pay for it. Why
  didn't you bring them in along the trail, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't bring them in. I just came down from Butte to-day. I suppose the
  herders brought them out where the feed was best; they did if they're worth
  their wages."</p>

  <p>"They happened to strike some feed that was pretty expensive. And," he
  smiled down at Whittaker misleadingly, "you ought to keep an eye on those
  herders, or they might let you in for another grass bill. The Flying U has
  got quite a lot of range, right around here, you recollect. And we've got
  plenty of cattle to eat it. We don't need any help to keep the grass down so
  we can ride through it."</p>

  <p>"Now, look here," began the lank man with that sort of persuasiveness
  which can turn instantly into bluster, "all this is pure foolishness, you
  know. We're here to stay. We've bought this place, and some other land to go
  with it, and we expect to stay right here and make a living. It happens that
  we expect to make a living off of sheep. Now, we don't want to start in by
  quarreling with our neighbors, and we don't want our neighbors to start any
  quarrel with us. All we want&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mamma! You're taking a fine way to make us love yuh," Weary cut in
  ironically. "I know what you want. You want the same as every other meek and
  lovely sheepman wants. You want it all&mdash; core, seeds and peeling. Dunk,"
  he said with a more impatient disgust than he was in the habit of showing for
  his fellowmen, "this man's a stranger; but I should think you'd know better
  than to come in here with sheep."</p>

  <p>"I don't know why a sheep outfit isn't exactly as good as a cow outfit,
  and I don't know why they haven't as much right here. You're welcome to what
  land you own, but it always seemed to me that public land is open to the use
  of the public. Now, as Oleson says, we expect to raise sheep here, and we
  expect your outfit to leave us alone. As far as our sheep crossing your
  coulee is concerned&mdash;I don't know that they did. But, if they did, and,
  if they did any damage, let J. G. do the talking about that. I deal with the
  owners&mdash;not with the hired men."</p>

  <p>Weary, you must understand, was never a bellicose young man. But, for all
  that, he leaned over and gave Dunk a slap on the jaw which must have stung
  considerably&mdash;and the full reason for his violence lay four years behind
  the two, when Dunk was part owner of the Flying U, and when his sneering
  arrogance had been very hard to endure.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to swallow that&mdash;from a hired man?" Weary inquired,
  after a minute during which nothing whatever occurred beyond the slow
  reddening of Dunk's face.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to fight, if that's what you mean,," Dunk sneered. "I
  decline to bring myself down to your level. One doesn't expect anything from
  a jackass but a bray, you know&mdash;and one doesn't feel compelled to bray
  because the jackass does." He smiled that supercilious smile which Weary had
  hated of old, and which, he knew, was well used to covering much treachery
  and small meannesses of various sorts.</p>

  <p>"As I said, if the Flying U has any claim against us, let the owner
  present it in the usual way." Dunk drew down his black brows, lifted a corner
  of his lip and turned his back deliberately upon them.</p>

  <p>Oleson let himself through the gate, which he closed somewhat hastily
  behind him. "I'm sorry you fellows seem to want to make trouble," he said,
  without looking up from the latch, which seemed somewhat out of repair, like
  the rest of the Denson property. "That's a poor way to start in with new
  neighbors." He lifted his hat with what Pink considered insulting politeness,
  and followed Dunk into the house.</p>

  <p>Weary waited there until they had gone in and closed the door, then turned
  and rode back home again, frowning thoughtfully at the trail ahead of them
  all the way, and making no reply to Pink's importunings for war.</p>

  <p>"I'd hate to say you've lost your nerve, Weary," Pink cried at last, in
  sheer desperation. "But why the devil didn't you get down and thump the
  daylights out of that black son-of-a-gun? I came pretty near walking into him
  myself, only I hate to butt into another fellow's scrap. But, if I'd known
  you were going to set there and let him walk off with that sneer on his
  face&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can't fight a man that won't hit back," Weary protested. "You couldn't
  either, Cadwalloper. You'd have done just what I did; you'd have let him
  go."</p>

  <p>"He will hit back, all right enough," Pink retorted passionately. "He'll
  do it when you ain't looking, though. He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know it," Weary sighed. "I'm kinda sorry, now, I slapped him. He'll hit
  back&mdash;but he won't hit me; he'll aim at the outfit. If the Old Man was
  here, or Chip, I'd feel a whole lot easier in my mind."</p>

  <p>"They couldn't do anything you can't do," Pink assured him loyally,
  forgetting his petulance when he saw the careworn look in Weary's face. "All
  they can do is gobble all the range around here&mdash;and I guess there's a
  few of us that will have a word or two to say about that."</p>

  <p>"What makes me sore," Weary confided, "is knowing that Dunk isn't thinking
  altogether of the dollar end of it. He's tickled to death to get a whack at
  the outfit. And I hate to see him get away with it; but I guess we'll have to
  stand for it."</p>

  <p>That sentiment did not please Pink; nor, when Weary repeated it later that
  evening in the bunk-house, did it please the Happy Family. The less pleasing
  it was because it was perfectly true and every man of them knew it. Beyond
  keeping the sheep off Flying U land, there was nothing they could do without
  stepping over the line into lawlessness&mdash;and, while they were not in any
  sense a meek Happy Family, they were far more law-abiding than their
  conversation that night made them appear.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">IX. &mdash; MORE SHEEP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE next week was a time of harassment for the Flying U; a
  week filled to overflowing with petty irritations, traceable, directly or
  indirectly, to their new neighbors, the Dot sheepmen. The band in charge of
  the bug-chaser and that other unlovable man from Wyoming fed just as close to
  the Flying U boundary as their guardians dared let them feed; a great deal
  closer than was good for the tempers of the Happy Family, who rode fretfully
  here and there upon their own business and at the same time tried to keep an
  eye upon their unsavory neighbors&mdash;a proceeding as nerve-racking as it
  was futile.</p>

  <p>The Native Son, riding home in jingling haste from Dry Lake, whither he
  had hurried one afternoon in the hope of cheering news from Chicago, reported
  another trainload of Dots on the wide level beyond Antelope coulee. There
  were, he said, four men in charge of the band, and he believed they carried
  guns, though he was not positive of that. They were moving slowly, and he
  thought they would not attempt to cross Flying U coulee before the next day;
  though, from the course they were taking, he was sure they meant to
  cross.</p>

  <p>Coupled with that bit of ill-tidings, the brief note from Chip, saying
  very little about the Old Man, but implying a good deal by its very
  omissions, would have been enough to send the Happy Family to sleepless beds
  that night if they had been the kind to endure with silent fortitude their
  troubles.</p>

  <p>"If you fellers would back me up," brooded Big Medicine down by the corral
  after supper, "I'd see to it them sheep never gits across the coulee, by
  cripes! I'd send 'em so far the other way they'd git plumb turned around and
  forgit they ever wanted to go south."</p>

  <p>"It's all Dunk's devilishness," Jack Bates declared. "He could take them
  in the other way, even if the feed ain't so good along the trail. It's most
  all prairie-dog towns&mdash;but that's good enough for sheep." Jack, in his
  intense partisanship, spoke as if sheep were not entitled to decent grass at
  any time or under any circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Them herders packin' guns looks to me like they're goin' to make trouble
  if they kin," gloomed Happy Jack. "I betche they'll kill somebody before
  they're through. When sheepmen gits mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Pink picked up his rope and started for the large corral, where a few
  saddle horses had been driven in just before supper and had not yet been
  turned out.</p>

  <p>"You fellows can stand around and chew the rag, if you want to," he said
  caustically, "and wait for Weary to make a war-talk. But I'm going to keep
  cases on them Dots, if I have to stand an all-night guard on 'em. I don't
  blame Weary; he's looking out for the law-and-order business&mdash;and that's
  all right. But I'm not in charge of the outfit. I'm going to do as I darn
  please, and, if they don't like my style, they can give me my time."</p>

  <p>"Good for you, Little One!" Big Medicine hurried to overtake him so that
  he might slap him on the shoulder with his favorite, sledge-hammer method of
  signifying his approval of a man's sentiments. "Honest to grandma, I was just
  b'ginnin' to think this bunch was gitting all streaked up with yeller.
  'Course, we ain't goin' to wait for no official orders, by cripes! I'd ruther
  lock Weary up in the blacksmith shop than let him tell us to go ahead. Go awn
  and tell him a good, stiff lie, Andy&mdash;just to keep him interested while
  us fellers make a gitaway. He ain't in on this; we don't want him in on
  it."</p>

  <p>"What yuh goin' to do?" Happy Jack inquired suspiciously. "Yuh can't go
  and monkey with them sheep, er them herders. They ain't on our land. And, if
  you don't git killed, old Dunk'll fix yuh like he fixed the Gordon
  boys&mdash;I know him&mdash;to a fare-you-well. It'd tickle him to death to
  git something on us fellers. I betche that's what he's aiming t'do. Git us to
  fightin' his outfit so's't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, go off and lie down!" Andy implored him contemptuously. "We're going
  to hang those herders, and drive the sheep all over a cut-back somewhere,
  like Jesus done to the hogs, and then we're going over and murder old Dunk,
  if he's at home, and burn the house to hide the guilty deed. And, if the
  sheriff comes snooping around, asking disagreeable questions, we'll all swear
  you done it. So now you know our plans; shut your face and go on to bed. And
  be sure," he added witheringly, "you pull the soogans over your head, so you
  won't hear the dying shriek of our victims. We're liable to get kinda excited
  and torture 'em a while before we kill 'em."</p>

  <p>"Aw, gwan!" gulped Happy Jack mechanically. "You make me sick! If yuh
  think I'm goin' to swaller all that, you're away off! You wouldn't dast do
  nothing of the kind; and, if yuh did, you'd sure have a sweet time layin' it
  onto me!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," drawled the Native Son, with a slow, velvet-eyed
  glance, "any jury in the country would hang you on your looks, Happy. I knew
  a man down in the lower part of California, who was arrested, tried and
  hanged for murder. And all the evidence there was against him was the fact
  that he was seen within five miles of the place on the same day the murder
  was committed; and his face. They had an expert physiognomist there, and he
  swore that the fellow had the face of a murderer; the poor devil looked like
  a criminal&mdash;and, though he had one of the best lawyers on the Coast, it
  was adios for him."</p>

  <p>"I s'pose you mean I got the face of a criminal!" sputtered Happy Jack.
  "It ain't always the purty fellers that wins out&mdash; like you 'n' Pink. I
  never seen the purty man yit that was worth the powder it'd take to blow him
  up! Aw, you fellers make me sick!" He went off, muttering his opinion of them
  all, and particularly of the Native Son, who smiled while he listened. "You
  go awn and start something&mdash;and you'll wisht you hadn't," they heard him
  croak from the big gate, and chuckled over his wrath.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the Happy Family, as a whole, or as individuals, had
  no intention of committing any great violence that evening. Pink wanted to
  see just where this new band of sheep was spending the night, and to find
  out, if possible, what were the herders' intentions. Since the boys were all
  restless under their worry, and, since there is a contagious element in
  seeking a trouble-zone, none save Happy Jack, who was "sore" at them, and
  Weary stayed behind in the coulee with old Patsy while the others rode away
  up the grade and out toward Antelope coulee beyond.</p>

  <p>They meant only to reconnoiter, and to warn the herders against attempting
  to cross Flying U coulee; though they were not exactly sure that they would
  be perfectly polite, or that they would confine themselves rigidly to the
  language they were wont to employ at dances. Andy Green, in particular,
  seemed rather to look forward with pleasure to the meeting. Andy, by the way,
  had remained heartbrokenly passive during that whole week, because Weary had
  extracted from him a promise which Andy, mendacious though he had the name of
  being, felt constrained to keep intact. Though of a truth it irked him much
  to think of two sheepherders walking abroad unpunished for their outrage upon
  his person.</p>

  <p>Weary, as he had made plain to them all, wanted to avoid trouble if it
  were possible to do so. And, though they grinned together in secret over his
  own affair with Dunk&mdash;which was not, in their opinion, exactly
  pacific&mdash;they meant to respect his wishes as far as human nature was
  able to do so. So that the Happy Family, galloping toward the red sunset and
  the great, gray blot on the prairie, just where the glory of the west tinged
  the grass blades with red, were not one-half as blood-thirsty as they had
  proclaimed themselves to be.</p>

  <p>While they were yet afar off they could see two men walking slowly in the
  immediate vicinity of the huddled band. A hundred yards away was a small
  tent, with a couple of horses picketed near by and feeding placidly. The men
  turned, gazed long at their approach, and walked to the tent, which they
  entered somewhat hastily.</p>

  <p>"Look at 'em dodge outa sight, will you!" cried Cal Emmett, and lifted up
  his voice in the yell which sometimes announced the Happy Family's arrival in
  Dry Lake after a long, thirsty absence on roundup. Other voices joined in
  after that first, shrill "Ow-ow-ow-eee!" of Cal's; so that presently the
  whole lot of them were emitting nerve-crimping yells and spurring their
  horses into a thunder of hoofbeats, as they bore down upon the tent. Between
  howls they laughed, picturing to themselves four terrified sheepherders
  cowering within those frail, canvas walls.</p>

  <p>"I'm a rambler, and a gambler, and far from my ho-o-me, And if yuh don't
  like me, jest leave me alo-o-ne!" chanted Big Medicine most horribly, and
  finished with a yell that almost scared himself and set his horse to plunging
  wildly.</p>

  <p>"Come out of there, you lop-eared mutton-chewers, and let us pick the wool
  outa your teeth!" shouted Andy Green, telling himself hastily that this was
  not breaking his promise to Weary, and yielding to the temptation of coming
  as close to the guilty persons as he might; for, while these were not the men
  who had tied him and left him alone on the prairie, they belonged to the same
  outfit, and there was some comfort in giving them a few disagreeable
  minutes.</p>

  <p>Pink, in the lead, was turning to ride around the tent, still yelling,
  when someone within the tent fired a rifle&mdash;and did not aim as high as
  he should. The bullet zipped close over the head of Big Medicine, who
  happened to be opposite the crack between the tent-flaps. The hand of Big
  Medicine jerked back to his hip; but, quick as he was, the Native Son plunged
  between him and the tent before he could take aim.</p>

  <p>"Steady, amigo," smiled Miguel. "You aren't a crazy sheepherder."</p>

  <p>"No, but I'm goin' to kill off one. Git outa my way!" Big Medicine was
  transformed into a cold-eyed, iron-jawed fighting machine. He dug the spurs
  in, meaning to ride ahead of Miguel. But Miguel's spurs also pressed home, so
  that the two horses plunged as one. Big Medicine, bellowing one solitary
  oath, drew his right leg from the stirrup to dismount. Miguel reached out,
  caught him by the arm, and held him to the saddle. And, though Big Medicine
  was a strong man, the grip held firm and unyielding.</p>

  <p>"You must think of the outfit, you know," said Miguel, smiling still.
  "There must be no shooting. Once that begins&mdash;" He shrugged his
  shoulders with that slight, eloquent movement, which the Happy Family had
  come to know so well. He was speaking to them all, as they crowded up to the
  scuffle. "The man who feels the trigger-itch had better throw his gun away,"
  he advised coolly. "I know, boys. I've seen these things start before. All
  hell can't stop you, once you begin to shoot. Put it up, Bud, or give it to
  me."</p>

  <p>"The man don't live that can shoot at me, by cripes, and git away with it.
  Not if he misses killin' me!" Big Medicine was shaking with rage; but the
  Native Son saw that he hesitated, nevertheless, and laughed outright.</p>

  <p>"Call him out and give him a thumping. That's good enough for a
  sheepherder," he suggested as a substitute.</p>

  <p>Perhaps because the Native Son so seldom offered advice, and, because of
  his cool courage in interfering with Big Medicine at such a time, Bud's jaw
  relaxed and his pale eyes became more human in their expression. He even
  permitted Miguel to remove the big, wicked Colt from his hand, and slide it
  into his own pocket; whereat the Happy Family gasped with astonishment. Not
  even Pink would have dreamed of attempting such a thing.</p>

  <p>"Well he's got to come out and take a lickin', anyway," shouted Big
  Medicine vengefully, and rode close enough to slap the canvas smartly with
  his quirt. By all the gods he knew by name he called upon the offender to
  come forth, while the others drew up in a rude half-circle to await
  developments. Heavy silence was the reply he got. It was as though the men
  within were sitting tense and watchful, like cougars crouched for a spring,
  with claws unsheathed and muscles quivering.</p>

  <p>"You better come out," called Andy sharply, after they had waited a decent
  interval. "We didn't come here hunting trouble; we want to know where you're
  headed for with these sheep. The fellow that cut loose with the
  gun&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw, don't talk so purty! I'm gitting almighty tired, just setting here
  lettin' m' legs hang down. Git your ropes, boys!" With one sweeping gesture
  of his arm Big Medicine made plain his meaning as he rode a few paces away,
  his fingers fumbling with the string that held his rope. "I'm goin' to have a
  look at 'em, anyway," he grinned. "I sure do hate to see men act so
  bashful."</p>

  <p>With his rope free and ready for action, Big Medicine shook the loop out,
  glanced around, and saw that Andy, Pink and Cal Emmett were also ready, and,
  with a dexterous flip, settled the noose neatly over the iron pin that thrust
  up through the end of the ridge-pole in front. Andy's loop sank neatly over
  it a second later, and the two wheeled and dashed away together, with Pink
  and Irish duplicating their performance at the other end of the tent. The
  dingy, smoke-stained canvas swayed, toppled, as the pegs gave way, and
  finally lay flat upon the prairie fifty feet from where it had stood, leaving
  the inmates exposed to the cruel stare of eight unfriendly cowpunchers. Four
  cowering figures they were, with guns in their hands that shook.</p>

  <p>"Drop them guns!" thundered Big Medicine, flipping his rope loose and
  recoiling it mechanically as he plunged up to the group.</p>

  <p>One man obeyed. One gave a squawk of terror and permitted his gun to go
  off at random before he fled toward the coulee. The other two crouched behind
  their bed-rolls, set their jaws doggedly and glared defiance.</p>

  <p>Pink, Andy, Irish, Big Medicine and the Native Son slid off their horses
  and made a rush at them. A rifle barked viciously, and Slim, sitting
  prudently on his horse well in the rear, gave a yell and started for home at
  a rapid pace.</p>

  <p>Considering the provocation the Happy Family behaved with quite
  praiseworthy self-control and leniency. They did not lynch those two herders.
  They did not kill them, either by bullets, knives, or beating to death. They
  took away the guns, however, and they told them with extreme bluntness what
  sort of men they believed them to be. They defined accurately their position
  in society at large, in that neighborhood, and stated what would be their
  future fate if they persisted in acting with so little caution and common
  sense.</p>

  <p>At Andy Green's earnest behest they also wound them round and round with
  ropes, before they departed, and gave them some very good advice upon the
  matter of range rules and the herding of sheep, particularly of Dot
  sheep.</p>

  <p>"You're playing big luck, if you only had sense enough to know it," Andy
  pointed out to the recumbent three before they rode away. "We didn't come
  over here on the warpath, and, if you hadn't got in such a darned hurry to
  start something, you'd be a whole lot more comfortable right now. We rode
  over to tell yuh not to start them sheep across Flying U coulee; because, if
  you do, you're going to have both hands and your hats plumb full uh trouble.
  It has taken some little time and fussing to get yuh gentled down so we can
  talk to you, and I sure do hope yuh remember what I'm saying."</p>

  <p>"Oh, we'll remember it, all right!" menaced one of the men, lifting his
  head turtlewise that he might glare at the group. "And our bosses'll remember
  it; you needn't worry about that none. You wait till&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The next man to him turned his head and muttered a sentence, and the
  speaker dropped his head back upon the ground, silenced.</p>

  <p>"It was your own outfit started this style of rope trimming, so you can't
  kick about that part of the deal," Pink informed them melodiously. "It's
  liable to get to be all the rage with us. So, if you don't like it, don't
  come around where we are. And say!" His dimples stood deep in his cheeks.
  "You send those ropes home to-morrow, will yuh? We're liable to need
  'em."</p>

  <p>"by cripes!" Big Medicine bawled. "What say we haze them sheep a few miles
  north, boys?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I guess they'll be all right where they are," Andy protested, his
  thirst for revenge assuaged at sight of those three trussed as he had been
  trussed, and apparently not liking it any better than he had liked it.
  "They'll be good and careful not to come around the Flying U&mdash;or I miss
  my guess a mile."</p>

  <p>The others cast comprehensive glances at their immediate surroundings, and
  decided that they had at least made their meaning plain; there was no
  occasion for emphasizing their disapproval any further. They confiscated the
  rifles, and they told the fellows why they did so. They very kindly pulled a
  tarpaulin over the three to protect them in a measure from the chill night
  that was close upon them, and they wished them good night and pleasant
  dreams, and rode away home.</p>

  <p>On the way they met Weary and Happy Jack, galloping anxiously to the
  battle scene. Slim, it appeared from Weary's rapid explanation, had arrived
  at the ranch with his horse in a lather and with a four-inch furrow in the
  fleshiest part of his leg, where a bullet had flicked him in passing. The
  tale he told had led Weary to believe that Slim was the sole survivor of that
  reckless company.</p>

  <p>"Mamma! I'm so glad to see you boys able to fork your horses and swear
  natural, that I don't believe I can speak my little piece about staying on
  your own side of the fence and letting trouble do some of the hunting," he
  exclaimed thankfully. "I wish you'd stayed at home and left these blamed Dots
  alone. But, seeing yuh didn't, I'm tickled to death to hear you didn't kill
  anybody off. I don't want the folks to come home and find the whole bunch in
  the pen. It might look as if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't want the folks to come home and find the whole ranch sheeped
  off, either, and the herders camping up in the white house, do yuh?" Pink
  inquired pointedly. "I kinda think," he added dryly, "those same herders will
  feel like going away around Flying U fences with their sheep. I don't believe
  they'll do any cutting across."</p>

  <p>"I betche old Dunk'll make it interestin' fer this outfit, just the same,"
  Happy Jack predicted. "Tyin' up three men uh hisn, like that, and ropin'
  their tent and draggin' it off, ain't things he'll pass up. He'll have a
  possy out here&mdash;you see if he don't!"</p>

  <p>"In that case, I'll be sorry for you, Happy," purred Miguel close beside
  him. "You're the only one in the outfit that looks capable of such a vile
  deed."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dunk won't do anything," Weary said cheerfully. "You'll have to take
  those guns back, though. They might take a notion to call that stealing!"</p>

  <p>"You forget," the Native Son reminded calmly, "that we left them three
  good ropes in exchange."</p>

  <p>Whereupon the Happy Family laughed and went to offer their unsought
  sympathy to Slim.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">X. &mdash; THE HAPPY FAMILY HERD SHEEP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE boys of the Flying U had many faults in common, aside
  from certain individual frailties; one of their chief weaknesses was
  over-confidence in their own ability to cope with any situation which might
  arise, unexpectedly or otherwise, and a belief that others felt that same
  confidence in them, and that enemies were wont to sit a long time counting
  the cost before venturing to offer too great an affront. Also they
  believed&mdash;and made it manifest in their conversation&mdash;that they
  could even bring the Old Man back to health if they only had him on the ranch
  where they could get at him. They maligned the hospitals and Chicago doctors
  most unjustly, and were agreed that all he needed was to be back on the ranch
  where somebody could look after him right. They asserted that, if they ever
  got tired of living and wanted to cash in without using a gun or anything,
  they'd go to a hospital and tell the doctors to turn loose and try to cure
  them of something.</p>

  <p>This by way of illustration; also as an explanation of their sleeping
  soundly that night, instead of watching for some hostile demonstration on the
  part of the Dot outfit. To a man&mdash;one never counted Happy Jack's
  prophecies of disaster as being anything more than a personal deformity of
  thought&mdash;they were positive in their belief that the Dot sheepherders
  would be very, very careful not to provoke the Happy Family to further
  manifestations of disapproval. They knew what they'd get, if they tried any
  more funny business, and they'd be mighty careful where they drove their
  sheep after this.</p>

  <p>So, with the comfortable glow of victory in their souls, they laid them
  down, and, when the animated discussion of that night's adventure flagged, as
  their tongues grew sleep-clogged and their eyelids drooped, they slept in
  peace; save when Slim, awakened by the soreness of his leg, grunted a
  malediction or two before he began snoring again.</p>

  <p>They rose and ate their breakfast in a fair humor with the world. One
  grows accustomed to the thought of sickness, even when it strikes close to
  the affections, and, with the resilience of youth and hope, life adjusts
  itself to make room for the specter of fear, so that it does not crowd
  unduly, but stands half-forgotten in the background of one's thoughts. For
  that reason they no longer spoke soberly because of the Old Man lying hurt
  unto death in Chicago. And, when they mentioned the Dot sheep and men, they
  spoke as men speak of the vanquished.</p>

  <p>With the taste of hot biscuits and maple syrup still lingering pleasantly
  against their palates, they went out and were confronted with sheep, blatting
  sheep, stinking sheep, devastating sheep, Dot sheep. On the south side of the
  coulee, up on the bluff, grazed the band. They fed upon the brow of the hill
  opposite the ranch buildings; they squeezed under the fence and spilled a
  ragged fringe of running, gray animals down the slope. Half a mile away
  though the nearest of them were, the murmur of them, the smell of them, the
  whole intolerable presence of them, filled the Happy Family with an amazed
  loathing too deep for words.</p>

  <p>Technically, that high, level stretch of land bounding Flying U coulee on
  the south was open range. It belonged to the government. The soil was not
  fertile enough even for the most optimistic of "dry land" farmers to locate
  upon it; and this was before the dry-land farming craze had swept the
  country, gathering in all public land as claims. J. G. Whitmore had contented
  himself with acquiring title to the whole of the Flying U coulee, secure in
  his belief that the old order of things would not change, in his life-time,
  at least, and that the unwritten law of the range land, which leaves the
  vicinity of a ranch to the use of the ranch owner, would never be repealed by
  new customs imposed by a new class of people.</p>

  <p>Legally, there was no trespassing of the Dots, beyond the two or three
  hundred which had made their way through the fence. Morally, however, and by
  right of custom, their offense would not be much greater if they came on down
  the hill and invaded the Old Man's pet meadows, just beyond the "little
  pasture."</p>

  <p>Ladies may read this story, so I am not going to pretend to repeat the
  things they said, once they were released from dumb amazement. I should be
  compelled to improvise and substitute&mdash; which would remove much of the
  flavor. Let bare facts suffice, at present.</p>

  <p>They saddled in haste, and in haste they rode to the scene. This, they
  were convinced, was the band herded by the bug-killer and the man from
  Wyoming; and the nerve of those two almost excited the admiration of the
  Happy Family. It did not, however, deter them from their purpose.</p>

  <p>Weary, to look at him, was no longer in the mood to preach patience and a
  turning of the other cheek. He also made that change of heart manifest in his
  speech when Pink, his eyes almost black, rode up close and gritted at
  him:</p>

  <p>"Well, what's the orders now? Want me to go back and get the wire nippers
  so we can let them poor little sheep down into the meadow? Maybe we better
  ask the herders down to have some of Patsy's grub, too; I don't believe they
  had time to cook much breakfast. And it wouldn't be a bad idea to haze our
  own stuff clear off the range. I'm afraid Dunk's sheep are going to fare
  kinda slim, if we go on letting our cattle eat all the good grass!" Pink did
  not often indulge in such lengthy sarcasm, especially toward his beloved
  Weary; but his exasperation toward Weary's mild tactics had been growing
  apace.</p>

  <p>Weary's reply, I fear, will have to be omitted. It was terribly
  unrefined.</p>

  <p>"I want you boys to spread out, around the whole bunch," was his first
  printable utterance, "and haze these sheep just as far south as they can get
  without taking to the river. Don't get all het up chasing 'em
  yourself&mdash;make the men (Weary did not call them men; he called them
  something very naughty) that's paid for it do the driving."</p>

  <p>"And, if they don't go," drawled the smooth voice of the Native Son, "what
  shall we do, amigo? Slap them on the wrist?"</p>

  <p>Weary twisted in the saddle and sent him a baleful glance, which was not
  at all like Weary the sunny-hearted.</p>

  <p>"If you can't figure that out for yourself," he snapped, "you had better
  go back and wipe the dishes for Patsy; and, when that's done, you can pull
  the weeds out of his radishes. Maybe he'll give you a nickel to buy candy
  with, if you do it good." Before he faced to the front again his harsh glance
  swept the faces of his companions.</p>

  <p>They were grinning, every man of them, and he knew why. To see him lose
  his temper was something of an event with the Happy Family, who used
  sometimes to fix the date of an incident by saying, "It was right after that
  time Weary got mad, a year ago last fall," or something of the sort. He
  grinned himself, shamefacedly, and told them that they were a bunch of
  no-account cusses, anyway, and he'd just about as soon herd sheep himself as
  to have to run with such an outfit; which swept his anger from him and left
  him his usual self, with but the addition of a purpose from which nothing
  could stay him. He was going to settle the sheep question, and he was going
  to settle it that day.</p>

  <p>Only one injunction did he lay upon the Happy Family. "You fellows don't
  want to get excited and go to shooting," he warned, while they were still out
  of hearing of the herders. "We don't want Dunk to get anything like that on
  us; savvy?"</p>

  <p>They "savvied," and they told him so, each after his own individual
  manner.</p>

  <p>"I guess we ought to be able to put the run on a couple of sheepherders,
  without wasting any powder," Pink said loftily, remembering his meeting with
  them a few days before.</p>

  <p>"One thing sure&mdash;we'll make a good job of it this time," promised
  Irish, and spurred after Weary, who was leading the way around the band.</p>

  <p>The herders watched them openly and with the manner of men who are
  expecting the worst to happen. Unlike the four whose camp had been laid low
  the night before, these two were unarmed, as they had been from the first;
  which, in Weary's opinion, was a bit of guile upon the part of Dunk. If
  trouble came&mdash;trouble which it would take a jury to settle&mdash;the
  fact that the sheepmen were unarmed would tell heavily in their favor; for,
  while the petty meanness of range-stealing and nagging trespass may be harder
  to bear than the flourishing of a gun before one's face, it all sounds
  harmless enough in the telling.</p>

  <p>Weary headed straight for the nearest herder, told him to put his dogs to
  work rounding up the sheep, which were scattered over an area half a mile
  across while they fed, and, when the herder, who was the bug-killer, made no
  move to obey, Weary deliberately pulled his gun and pointed at his head.</p>

  <p>"You move," he directed with grim intent, "and don't take too much time
  about it, either."</p>

  <p>The bug-killer, an unkempt, ungainly figure, standing with his back to the
  morning sun, scowled up at Weary stolidly.</p>

  <p>"Yuh dassent shoot," he stated sourly, and did not move.</p>

  <p>For answer, Weary pulled back the hammer; also he smiled as malignantly as
  it was in his nature to do, and hoped in his heart that he looked
  sufficiently terrifying to convince the man. So they faced each other in a
  silent clash of wills.</p>

  <p>Big Medicine had not been saying much on the way over, which was unusual.
  Now he rode forward until he was abreast of Weary, and he grinned down at the
  bug-killer in a way to distract his attention from the gun.</p>

  <p>"Nobody don't have to shoot, by cripes!" he bawled. "We hain't goin' to
  kill yuh. We'll make yuh wisht, by cripes, we had, though, b'fore we git
  through. Git to work, boys, 'n' gether up some dry grass an' sticks. Over
  there in them rose-bushes you oughta find enough bresh. We'll give him a
  taste uh what we was talkin' about comm' over, by cripes! I guess he'll be
  willin' to drive sheep, all right, when we git through with him.
  Haw-haw-haw-w-w!" He leaned forward in the saddle and ogled the bug-killer
  with horrid significance.</p>

  <p>"Git busy with that bresh!" he yelled authoritatively, when a glance
  showed him that the Happy Family was hesitating and eyeing him uncertainly.
  "Git a fire goin' quick's yuh kin&mdash;I'll do the rest. Down in Coconino
  county we used to have a way uh fixin' sheepherders&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw, gwan! We don't want no torture business!" remonstrated Happy Jack
  uneasily, edging away.</p>

  <p>"Yuh don't, hey?" Big Medicine turned in the saddle wrathfully and glared.
  When he had succeeded in catching Andy Green's eye he winked, and that young
  man's face kindled understandingly. "Well, now, you hain't runnin' this here
  show. Honest to grandma, I've saw the time when a little foot-warmin' done a
  sheepherder a whole lot uh good; and, it looks to me, by cripes, as if this
  here feller needed a dose to gentle him down. You git the fire started.
  That's all I want you t' do, Happy. Some uh you boys help me rope
  him&mdash;like him and that other jasper over there done to Andy. C'me on,
  Andy&mdash;it ain't goin' to take long!"</p>

  <p>"You bet your sweet life I'll come on!" exclaimed Andy, dismounting
  eagerly. "Let me take your rope, Weary. Too bad we haven't got a branding
  iron&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw, we don't need no irons." Big Medicine was also on the ground by then,
  and untying his rope. "Lemme git his shoes off once, and I'll show yuh."</p>

  <p>The bug-killer lifted his stick, snarling like a mongrel dog when a
  stranger tries to drive it out of the house; hurled the stick hysterically,
  as Big Medicine, rope in hand, advanced implacably, and, with a squawk of
  horror, turned suddenly and ran. After him, bellowing terribly, lunged Big
  Medicine, straight through the band like a snowplow, leaving behind them a
  wide, open trail.</p>

  <p>"Say, we kinda overplayed that bet, by gracious," Andy commented to Weary,
  while he watched the chase. "That gazabo's scared silly; let's try the other
  one. That torture talk works fine."</p>

  <p>In his enthusiasm Andy remounted and was about to lead the way to the
  other herder when Big Medicine returned puffing, the bug-killer squirming in
  his grasp. "Tell him what yuh want him to do, Weary," he panted, with some
  difficulty holding his limp victim upright by a greasy coat-collar. "And if
  he don't fall over himself doin' it, why&mdash;by cripes&mdash;we'll take off
  his shoes!"</p>

  <p>Whereupon the bug-killer gave another howl and professed himself eager to
  drive the sheep&mdash;well, what he said was that he would drive them to that
  place which ladies dislike to hear mentioned, if the Happy Family wanted him
  to.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, then. Start 'em south, and don't quit till somebody
  tells you to." Weary carefully let down the hammer of his six-shooter and
  shoved it thankfully into his scabbard.</p>

  <p>"Now, you don't want to pile it on quite so thick, next time," Irish
  admonished Big Medicine, when they turned away from watching the bug-killer
  set his dogs to work by gestures and a shouted word or two. "You like to have
  sent this one plumb nutty."</p>

  <p>"I betche Bud gets us all pinched for that," grumbled Happy Jack.
  "Torturing folks is purty darned serious business. You might as well shoot
  'em up decent and be done with it."</p>

  <p>"Haw-haw-haw-w-w!" Big Medicine ogled the group mirthfully. "Nobody can't
  swear I done a thing, or said a thing. All I said definite was that I'd take
  off his shoes. Any jury in the country'd know that would be hull lot worse
  fer us than it would fer him, by cripes. Haw-haw-haw-w-w!"</p>

  <p>"Say, that's right; yuh didn't say nothin', ner do nothin'. By golly, that
  was purty slick work, all right!" Slim forgot his sore leg until he clapped
  his hand enthusiastically down upon the place as comprehension of Bud's
  finesse dawned upon him. He yelped, and the Happy Family laughed
  unfeelingly.</p>

  <p>"You want to be careful and don't try to see through any jokes, Slim, till
  that leg uh yours gets well," Irish bantered, and they laughed the
  louder.</p>

  <p>All this was mere byplay; a momentary swinging of their mood to
  pleasantry, because they were a temperamentally cheerful lot, and laughter
  came to them easily, as it always does to youth and perfect mental and
  physical health. Their brief hilarity over Slim's misfortune did not swerve
  them from their purpose, nor soften the mood of them toward their
  adversaries. They were unsmiling and unfriendly when they reached the man
  from Wyoming; and, if they ever behaved like boys let out of school, they did
  not show it then.</p>

  <p>The Wyoming man was wiser than his fellow. He had been given several
  minutes grace in which to meditate upon the unwisdom of defiance; and he had
  seen the bug-killer change abruptly from sullenness to terror, and afterward
  to abject obedience. He did not know what they had said to him, or what they
  had done; but he knew the bug-killer was a hard man to stampede. And he was
  one man, and they were many; also he judged that, being human, and this being
  the third offense of the Dot sheep under his care, it would be extremely
  unsafe to trust that their indignation would vent itself in mere words.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Weary told him to get the stragglers back through the
  fence and up on the level, he stopped only long enough for a good look at
  their faces. After that he called his dogs and crawled through the fence.</p>

  <p>It really did not require the entire Family to force those sheep south
  that morning. But Weary's jaw was set, as was his heart, upon a thorough
  cleaning of that particular bit of range; and, since he did not definitely
  request any man to turn back, and every fellow there was minded to see the
  thing to a finish, they straggled out behind the trailing two
  thousand&mdash;and never had one bunch of sheep so efficient a convoy.</p>

  <p>After the first few miles the way grew rough. Sheep lagged, and the
  blatting increased to an uproar. Old ewes and yearlings these were mostly,
  and there were few to suffer more than hunger and thirst, perhaps. So Weary
  was merciless, and drove them forward without a stop until the first jumble
  of hills and deep-worn gullies held them back from easy traveling.</p>

  <p>But the Happy Family had not ridden those breaks for cattle, all these
  years, to be hindered by rough going. Weary, when the band stopped and
  huddled, blatting incessantly against a sheer wall of sandstone and gravel,
  got the herders together and told them what he wanted.</p>

  <p>"You take 'em down that slope till you come to the second little coulee.
  Don't go up the first one&mdash;that's a blind pocket. In the second coulee,
  up a mile or so, there's a spring creek. You can hold 'em there on water for
  half an hour. That's more than any of yuh deserve. Haze 'em down there."</p>

  <p>The herders did not know it, but that second coulee was the rude gateway
  to an intricate system of high ridges and winding waterways that would later
  be dry as a bleached bone&mdash;the real beginning of the bad lands which
  border the Missouri river for long, terrible miles. Down there, it is
  possible for two men to reach places where they may converse quite easily
  across a chasm, and yet be compelled to ride fifteen or twenty miles,
  perhaps, in order to shake hands. Yet, even in that scrap-heap of Nature
  there are ways of passing deep into the heart of the upheaval.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family knew those ways as they knew the most complicated figures
  of the quadrilles they danced so lightfootedly with the girls of the Bear Paw
  country. When they forced the sheep and their herders out of the coulee Weary
  had indicated he sent Irish and Pink ahead to point the way, and he told them
  to head for the Wash Bowl; which they did with praiseworthy zeal and scant
  pity for the sheep.</p>

  <p>When at last, after a slow, heartbreaking climb up a long, bare ridge,
  Pink and Irish paused upon the brow of a slope and let the trail-weary band
  spill itself reluctantly down the steep slope beyond, the sun stood high in
  the blue above them and their stomachs clamored for food; by which signs they
  knew that it must be near noon.</p>

  <p>When the last sheep had passed, blatting discordantly, down the bluff,
  Weary halted the sweating herders for a parting admonition.</p>

  <p>"We don't aim to deal you any more misery, for a while, if you stay where
  you're at. You're only working for a living, like the rest of us&mdash;but I
  must say I don't admire your trade none. Anyway, I'll send some of your bunch
  down here with grub and beds. This is good enough range for sheep. You keep
  away from the Flying U and nobody'll bother you. Over there in them trees,"
  he added, pointing a gloved finger toward a little grove on the far side of
  the basin, "you'll find a cabin, and water. And, farther down the river
  there's pretty good grass, in the little bottoms. Now, git."</p>

  <p>The herders looked as if they would enjoy murdering them all, but they did
  not say a word. With their dogs at heel they scrambled down the bluff in the
  wake of their sheep, and the Happy Family, rolling cigarettes while they
  watched them depart, told one another that this settled that bunch; they
  wouldn't bed down in the Flying U door-yard that night, anyway.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">XI. &mdash; WEARY UNBURDENS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HUNGRY with the sharp, gnawing hunger of healthy stomachs
  accustomed to regular and generous feeding; tired with the weariness of
  healthy muscles pushed past their accustomed limit of action; and hot with
  the unaccustomed heat of a blazing day shunted unaccountably into the midst
  of soft spring weather, the Happy Family rode out of the embrace of the last
  barren coulee and up on the wide level where the breeze swept gratefully up
  from the west, and where every day brought with it a deeper tinge of green
  into its grassy carpet.</p>

  <p>Only for this harassment of the Dot sheep, the roundup wagons would be
  loaded and ready to rattle abroad over the land. Meadow larks and curlews and
  little, pert-eyed ground sparrows called out to them that roundup time was
  come. They passed a bunch of feeding Flying U cattle, and flat-ribbed,
  bandy-legged calves galloped in brief panic to their mothers and from the
  sanctuary of grass-filled paunches watched the riders with wide, inquisitive
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"We ought to be starting out, by now," Weary observed a bit gloomily to
  Andy and Pink, who rode upon either side of him. "The calf crop is going to
  be good, if this weather holds on another two weeks or so. But&mdash;" he
  waved his cigarette disgustedly "&mdash;that darned Dot outfit would be all
  over the place, if we pulled out on roundup and left 'em the run of things."
  He smoked moodily for a minute. "My religion has changed a lot in the last
  few days," he observed whimsically. "My idea of hell is a place where there
  ain't anything but sheep and sheepherders; and cowpunchers have got to spend
  thousands uh years right in the middle of the corrals."</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, I'm going to quit cussing, and say my prayers every
  night," Andy Green asserted emphatically.</p>

  <p>"What worries me," Weary confided, obeying the impulse to talk over his
  troubles with those who sympathized, "is how I'm going to keep the work going
  along like it ought to, and at the same time keep them Dot sheep outa the
  house. Dunk's wise, all right. He knows enough about the cow business to know
  we've got to get out on the range pretty quick, now. And he's so mean that
  every day or every half day he can feed his sheep on Flying U grass, he calls
  that much to the good. And he knows we won't go to opening up any real
  gun-fights if we can get out of it; he counts on our faunching around and
  kicking up a lot of dust, maybe&mdash;but we won't do anything like what he'd
  do, in our places. He knows the Old Man and Chip are gone, and he knows we've
  just naturally got to sit back and swallow our tongues because we haven't any
  authority. Mamma! It comes pretty tough, when a low-down skunk like that just
  banks on your doing the square thing. He wouldn't do it, but he knows we
  will; and so he takes advantage of white men and gets the best of 'em. And if
  we should happen to break out and do something, he knows the herders would be
  the ones to get it in the neck; and he'd wait till the dust settled, and bob
  up with the sheriff&mdash;" He waved his hand again with a hopeless gesture.
  "It may not look that way on the face of it," he added gloomily, "but Dunk
  has got us right where he wants us. From the way they've been letting sheep
  on our land, time and time again, I'd gamble he's just trying to make us so
  mad we'll break out. He's got it in for the whole outfit, from the Old Man
  and the Little Doctor down to Slim. If any of us boys got into trouble, the
  Old Man would spend his last cent to clear us; and Dunk knows that just as
  well as he knows the way from the house to the stable. He'd see to it that it
  would just about take the Old Man's last cent, too. And he's using these Dot
  sheep like you'd use a red flag on a bull, to make us so crazy mad we'll kill
  off somebody.</p>

  <p>"That's why," he said to them all when he saw that they had ridden up
  close that they might hear what he was saying, "I've been hollering so loud
  for the meek-and-mild stunt. When I slapped him on the jaw, and he stood
  there and took it, I saw his game. He had a witness to swear I hit him and he
  didn't hit back. And when I saw them Dots in our field again, I knew, just as
  well as if Dunk had told me, that he was kinda hoping we'd kill a herder or
  two so he could cinch us good and plenty. I don't say," he qualified with a
  rueful grin, "that Dunk went into the sheep business just to get r-re-venge,
  as they say in shows. But if he can make money running sheep&mdash;and he
  can, all right, because there's more money in them right now than there is in
  cattle&mdash;and at the same time get a good whack at the Flying U, he's the
  lad that will sure make a running jump at the chance." He spat upon the burnt
  end of his cigarette stub from force of the habit that fear of range fires
  had built, and cast it petulantly from him; as if he would like to have been
  able to throw Dunk and his sheep problem as easily out of his path.</p>

  <p>"So I wish you boys would hang onto yourselves when you hear a sheep
  blatting under your window," he summed up his unburdening whimsically. "As
  Bud said this morning, you can't hang a man for telling a sheepherder you'll
  take off his shoes. And they can't send us over the road for moving that band
  of sheep onto new range to-day. Last night you all were kinda disorderly,
  maybe, but you didn't hurt anybody, or destroy any property. You see what I
  mean. Our only show is to stop with our toes on the right side of the dead
  line."</p>

  <p>"If Andy, here, would jest git his think-wheels greased and going good,"
  Big Medicine suggested loudly, "he ought to frame up something that would put
  them Dots on the run permanent. I d'no, by cripes, why it is a feller can
  always think uh lies and joshes by the dozens, and put 'em over O. K. when
  there ain't nothing to be made out of it except hard feelin's; and then when
  a deal like this here sheep deal comes up, he's got about as many idees, by
  cripes, as that there line-back calf over there. Honest to grandma, Andy
  makes me feel kinda faint. Only time he did have a chanc't, he let
  them&mdash;" It occurred to Big Medicine at that point that perhaps his
  remarks might be construed by the object of them as being offensively
  personal. He turned his head and grinned good-naturedly in Andy's direction,
  and refrained from finishing what he was going to say. "I sure do like them
  wind-flowers scattered all over the ground," he observed with such
  deliberate and ostentatious irrelevance that the Happy Family laughed, even
  to Andy Green, who had at first been inclined toward anger.</p>

  <p>"Everything," declared Andy in the tone of a paid instructor, "has its
  proper time and place, boys; I've told you that before. For instance, I
  wouldn't try to kill a skunk by talking it to death; and I wouldn't be
  hopeful of putting the run on this Dunk person by telling him ghost stories.
  As to ideas&mdash;I'm plumb full of them. But they're all about grub, just
  right at present."</p>

  <p>That started Slim and Happy Jack to complaining because no one had had
  sense enough to go back after some lunch before taking that long trail south;
  the longer because it was a slow one, with sheep to set the pace. And by the
  time they had presented their arguments against the Happy Family's having
  enough brains to last them overnight, and the Happy Family had indignantly
  pointed out just where the mental deficiency was most noticeable, they were
  upon that last, broad stretch of "bench" land beyond which lay Flying U
  coulee and Patsy and dinner; a belated dinner, to be sure, but for that the
  more welcome.</p>

  <p>And when they reached the point where they could look away to the very rim
  of the coulee, they saw sheep&mdash;sheep to the skyline, feeding scattered
  and at ease, making the prairie look, in the distance, as if it were covered
  with a thin growth of gray sage-brush. Four herders moved slowly upon the
  outskirts, and the dogs were little, scurrying, black dots which stopped
  occasionally to wait thankfully until the master-minds again urged them to
  endeavor.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family drew up and stared in silence.</p>

  <p>"Do I see sheep?" Pink inquired plaintively at last. "Tell me,
  somebody."</p>

  <p>"It's that bunch you fellows tackled last night," said Weary miserably. "I
  ought to have had sense enough to leave somebody on the ranch to look out for
  this."</p>

  <p>"They've got their nerve," stated Irish, "after the deal they got last
  night. I'd have bet good money that you couldn't drag them herders across
  Flying U coulee with a log chain."</p>

  <p>"Say, by golly, do we have to drive this here bunch anywheres before we
  git anything to eat?" Slim wanted to know distressfully.</p>

  <p>Weary considered briefly. "No, I guess we'll pass 'em up for the present.
  An hour or so won't make much difference in the long run, and our horses are
  about all in, right now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So'm I, by cripes!" Big Medicine attested, grinning mirthlessly. "This
  here sheep business is plumb wearin' on a man. 'Specially," he added with a
  fretful note, "when you've got to handle 'em gentle. The things I'd like to
  do to them Dots is all ruled outa the game, seems like. Honest to grandma, a
  little gore would look better to me right now than a Dutch picnic before the
  foam's all blowed off the refreshments. Lemme kill off jest one herder,
  Weary?" he pleaded. "The one that took a shot at me las' night. Purty,
  please!"</p>

  <p>"If you killed one," Weary told him glumly. "you might as well make a
  clean sweep and take in the whole bunch."</p>

  <p>"Well, I won't charge nothin' extra fer that, either," Bud assured him
  generously. "I'm willin' to throw in the other three &mdash;and the dawgs,
  too, by cripes!" He goggled the Happy Family quizzically. "Nobody can't say
  there's anything small about me. Why, down in the Coconino country they used
  to set half a dozen greasers diggin' graves, by cripes, soon as I started in
  to argy with a man. It was a safe bet they'd need three or four, anyways, if
  old Bud cut loose oncet. Sheepherders? Why, they jest natcherly couldn't keep
  enough on hand, securely, to run their sheep. They used to order sheepherders
  like they did woolsacks, by cripes! You could always tell when I was in the
  country, by the number uh extra herders them sheep outfits always kep' in
  reserve. Honest to grandma, I've knowed two or three outfits to club together
  and ship in a carload at a time, when they heard I was headed their way. And
  so when it comes to killin' off four, why that ain't skurcely enough to make
  it worth m'while to dirty up m'gun!"</p>

  <p>"Aw, I betche yuh never killed a man in your life!" Happy Jack grumbled in
  his characteristic tone of disparagement; but such was his respect for Big
  Medicine's prowess that he took care not to speak loud enough to be overheard
  by that modest gentleman, who continued with certain fearsome details of
  alleged murderous exploits of his own, down in Coconino County, Arizona.</p>

  <p>But as they passed the detested animals, thankful that the trail permitted
  them to ride by at a distance sufficient to blur the most unsavory details,
  even Big Medicine gave over his deliberate boastings and relapsed into
  silence.</p>

  <p>He had begun his fantastic vauntings from an instinctive impulse to leaven
  with humor a situation which, at the moment, could not be bettered. Just as
  they had, when came the news of the Old Man's dire plight, sought to push the
  tragedy of it into the background and cling to their creed of optimism, they
  had avoided openly facing the sheep complication squarely with mutual
  admissions of all it might mean to the Flying U.</p>

  <p>Until Weary had unburdened his heart of worry on the ride home that day,
  they had not said much about it, beyond a general vilification of the sheep
  industry as a whole, of Dunk as the chief of the encroaching Dots, and of the
  herders personally.</p>

  <p>But there were times when they could not well avoid thinking rather deeply
  upon the subject, even if they did refuse to put their forebodings into
  speech. They were not children; neither were they to any degree lacking in
  intelligence. Swearing, about herders and at them, was all very well;
  bluffing, threatening, pummeling even with willing fists, tearing down tents
  and binding men with ropes might serve to relieve the emotions upon occasion.
  But there was the grim economic problem which faced squarely the Flying U as
  a "cow outfit"&mdash;the problem of range and water; the Happy Family did not
  call it by name, but they realized to the full what it meant to the Old Man
  to have sheep just over his boundary line always. They realized, too, what it
  meant to have the Old Man absent at this time&mdash;worse, to have him lying
  in a hospital, likely to die at any moment; what it meant to have the whole
  responsibility shifted to their shoulders, willing though they might be to
  bear the burden; what it meant to have the general of an army gone when the
  enemy was approaching in overwhelming numbers.</p>

  <p>Pink, when they were descending the first slope of the bluff which was the
  southern rim of Flying U coulee, turned and glared vindictively back at the
  wavering, gray blanket out there to the west. When he faced to the front his
  face had the look it wore when he was fighting.</p>

  <p>"So help me, Josephine!" he gritted desperately, "we've got to clean the
  range of them Dots before the Old Man comes back, or&mdash;" He snapped his
  jaws shut viciously.</p>

  <p>Weary turned haggard eyes toward him.</p>

  <p>"How?" he asked simply. And Pink had no answer for him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">XII. &mdash; TWO OF A KIND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">PATSY, staunch old partisan that he was, placed before them
  much food which he had tried his best to keep hot without burning everything
  to a crisp, and while they ate with ravenous haste he told, with German
  epithets and a trembling lower jaw, of his troubles that day.</p>

  <p>"Dem sheeps, dey coom by der leetle pasture," he lamented while he poured
  coffee muddy from long boiling. "Looks like dey know so soon you ride away,
  und dey cooms cheeky as you pleece, und eats der grass und crawls under der
  fence and leafs der vool sthicking by der vires. I goes out mit a club, py
  cosh, und der sheeps chust looks und valks by some better place alreatty, und
  I throw rocks and yells till mine neck iss sore.</p>

  <p>"Und' dose herders, dey sets dem by der rock and laugh till I felt like I
  could kill der whole punch, by cosh! Und von yells, 'Hey, dutchy, pring me
  some pie, alreatty!' Und he laughs some more pecause der sheeps dey don't go
  avay; dey chust run around und eat more grass and baa-aa!" He turned and went
  heavily back to the greasy range with the depleted coffee pot, lifted the lid
  of a kettle and looked in upon the contents with a purely mechanical glance;
  gave a perfunctory prod or two with a long- handled fork, and came back to
  stand uneasily behind Weary.</p>

  <p>"If you poys are goin' to shtand fer dot," he began querulously, "Py cosh
  I von't! Py myself I vill go and tell dot Dunk W'ittaker vot lowdown skunk I
  t'ink he iss. Sheep's vool shtickin' by der fences efferwhere on der ranch,
  py cosh! Dot vould sure kill der Old Man quick if he see it. Shtinkin' off

  dem. Neffer pefore did I see vool on der Flying U fences, py cosh, und sheeps
  baa-aain' in der coulee!"</p>

  <p>Never had they seen Patsy take so to heart a matter of mere business
  importance. They did not say much to him; there was not much that they could
  say. They ate their fill and went out disconsolately to discuss the thing
  among themselves, away from Patsy's throaty complainings. They hated it as
  badly as did he; with Weary's urgent plea for no violence holding them in
  leash, they hated it more, if that were possible.</p>

  <p>The Native Son tilted his head unobtrusively stableward when he caught
  Andy's eye, and as unobtrusively wandered away from the group. Andy stopped
  long enough to roll and light a cigarette and then strolled after him with
  apparent aimlessness, secretly curious over the summons. He found Miguel in
  the stable waiting for him, and Miguel led the way, rope in hand across the
  corral and into the little pasture where fed a horse he meant to ride. He did
  not say anything until he had turned to close the gate, and to make sure that
  they were alone and that their departure had not carried to the Happy Family
  any betraying air of significance.</p>

  <p>"You remember when you blew in here, a few weeks or so ago?" the Native
  Son asked abruptly, a twinkle in his fathomless eyes. "You put up a good one
  on the boys, that time, you remember. Bluffed them into thinking I was a hero
  in disguise, and that you'd seen me pull off a big stunt of bull-fighting and
  bull- dogging down in Mexico. It was a fine josh. They believe it yet."</p>

  <p>Andy glanced at him perplexedly. "Yes&mdash;but when it turned out to be
  true," he amended, "the josh was on me, I guess; I thought I was just lying,
  when I wasn't. I've wondered a good deal about that. By gracious, it makes a
  man feel funny to frame up a yarn out of his own think-machine, and then find
  out he's been telling the truth all the while. It's like a fellow handing out
  a twenty-four karat gold bar to a rube by mistake, under the impression it
  only looks like one. Of course they believe it! Only they don't know I just
  merely hit the truth by accident."</p>

  <p>The Native Son smiled his slow, amused smile, that somehow never failed to
  be impressive. "That's the funny part of it," he drawled. "You didn't. I just
  piled another little josh on top of yours, that's all. I never throwed a bull
  in my life, except with my lariat. I'd heard a good deal about you,
  and&mdash;well, I thought I'd see if I could go you one better. And you put
  that Mexico yarn across so smooth and easy, I just simply couldn't resist the
  temptation to make you think it was all straight goods. Sabe?"</p>

  <p>Andy Green did not say a word, but he looked exceedingly foolish.</p>

  <p>"So I think we can both safely consider ourselves top-hands when it comes
  to lying," the Native Son went on shamelessly. "And if you're willing to go
  in with me on it and help put Dunk on the run&mdash;" He glanced over his
  shoulder, saw that Happy Jack, on horseback, was coming out to haze in the
  saddle bunch, and turned to stroll back as lazily as he had come. He
  continued to speak smoothly and swiftly, in a voice that would not carry ten
  paces. While Andy Green, with brown head bent attentively, listened eagerly
  and added a sentence or two on his own account now and then, and
  smiled&mdash;which he had not been in the habit of doing lately.</p>

  <p>"Say, you fellers are gittin' awful energetic, ain't yuh?&mdash;wranglin'
  horses afoot!" Happy Jack bantered at the top of his voice when he passed
  them by. "Better save up your strength while you kin. Weary's goin' to set us
  herdin' sheep agin&mdash;and I betche there's goin' to be something more'n
  herdin' on our hands before we git through."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be a bit surprised if there was," sang out Andy, as cheerfully
  as if he had been invited to dance "Ladies' choice" with the prettiest girl
  in the crowd. "Wonder what hole he's going to dump this bunch into," he added
  to the Native Son. "By gracious, he ought to send 'em just as far north as he
  can drive 'em without paying duty! I'd sure take 'em over into Canada, if it
  was me running the show."</p>

  <p>"It was a mistake," the Native Son volunteered, "for the whole bunch to go
  off like we did to-day. They had those sheep up here on the hill just for a
  bait. They knew we'd go straight up in the air and come down on those two
  freaks herding 'em, and that gave them the chance to cross the other bunch. I
  thought so all along, but I didn't like to butt in."</p>

  <p>"Well, Weary's mad enough now to do things that will leave a dent, anyway,"
  Andy commented under his breath when, from the corral gate, he got a good
  look at Weary's profile, which showed the set of his mouth and chin. "See
  that mouth? It's hunt the top rail, and do it quick, when old Weary
  straightens out his lips like that."</p>

  <p>Behind them, Happy Jack bellowed for an open gate and no obstructions, and
  they drew hastily to one side to let the saddle horses gallop past with a
  great upflinging of dust. Pink, with a quite obtrusive facetiousness, began
  lustily chanting that it looked to him like a big night to-night&mdash;with
  occasional, furtive glances at Weary's face; for he, also, had been quick to
  read those close-pressed lips, which did not soften in response to the ditty.
  Usually he laughed at Pink's drollery.</p>

  <p>They rode rather quietly upon the hill again, to where fed the sheep.
  During the hour or so that they had been absent the sheep had not moved
  appreciably; they still grazed close enough to the boundary to make their
  position seem a direct insult to the Flying U, a virtual slap in the face.
  And these young men who worked for the Flying U, and who made its interests
  right loyally their own, were growing very, very tired of turning the other
  cheek. With them, the time for profanity and for horseplay, bluffing, and
  judicious temporizing was past. There were other lips besides Weary's that
  were drawn tight and thin when they approached that particular band of sheep.
  More than one pair of eyes turned inquiringly toward him and away again when
  they met no answering look.</p>

  <p>They topped a rise of ground, and in the shallow wrinkle which had hidden
  him until now they came full upon Dunk Whittaker, riding a chunky black which
  stepped restlessly about while he conferred in low tones with a couple of the
  herders. The Happy Family recognized them as two of the fellows in whose safe
  keeping they had left their ropes the night before. Dunk looked around
  quickly when the group appeared over the little ridge, scowled, hesitated and
  then came straight up to them.</p>

  <p>"I want you rowdies to bring back those sheep you took the trouble to
  drive off this morning," he began, with the even, grating voice and the
  sneering lift of lip under his little, black mustache which the older members
  of the Happy Family remembered&mdash;and hated&mdash;so vividly. "I've stood
  just all I'm going to stand, of these typically Flying U performances you've
  been indulging in so freely during the past week. It's all very well to
  terrorize a neighborhood of long-haired rubes who don't know enough to teach
  you your places; but interfering with another man's property is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Interfering with another&mdash;what?" Big Medicine, his pale blue eyes
  standing out more like a frog's than ever upon his face, gave his horse a
  kick and lunged close that he might lean and thrust his red face near to
  Dunk's. "Another what? I don't see nothin' in your saddle that looks t'me
  like a man, by cripes! All I can see is a smooth-skinned, slippery vermin I'd
  hate to name a snake after, that crawls around in the dark and lets cheap
  rough- necks do all his dirty work. I've saw dogs sneak up and grab a man
  behind, but most always they let out a growl or two first. And even a rattler
  is square enough to buzz at yuh and give yuh a chanc't to side-step him.
  Honest to grandma, I don't hardly know what kinda reptyle y'are. I hate to
  insult any of 'em, by cripes, by namin' yuh after 'em. But don't, for Lordy's
  sake, ever call yourself a man agin!"</p>

  <p>Big Medicine turned his head and spat disgustedly into the grass and
  looked back slightingly with other annihilating remarks close behind his
  wide-apart teeth, but instead of speaking he made an unbelievably quick
  motion with his hand. The blow smacked loudly upon Dunk's cheek, and so
  nearly sent him out of the saddle that he grabbed for the horn to save
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I seert yuh keepin' yer hand next yer six-gun all the while," Big
  Medicine bawled. "That's one reason I say yuh ain't no man! Yuh wouldn't dast
  talk up to a prairie dog if yuh wasn't all set to make a quick draw. Yuh got
  your face slapped oncet before by a Flyin' U man, and yuh had it comm'. Now
  you're&mdash;gittin'&mdash;it&mdash;done&mdash;right!"</p>

  <p>If you have ever seen an irate, proletarian mother cuffing her offspring
  over an empty wood-box, you may picture perhaps the present proceeding of Big
  Medicine. To many a man the thing would have been unfeasible, after the first
  blow, because of the horses. But Big Medicine was very nearly all that he
  claimed to be; and one of his pet vanities was his horsemanship; he managed
  to keep within a fine slapping distance of Dunk. He stopped when his hand
  began to sting through his glove.</p>

  <p>"Now you keep your hand away from that gun&mdash;that you ain't honest
  enough to carry where folks can see it, but 'ye got it cached in your
  pocket!" he thundered. "And go on with what you was goin' t'say. Only don't
  get swell-headed enough to think you're a man, agin. You ain't."</p>

  <p>"I've got this to say!" Mere type cannot reproduce the malevolence of
  Dunk's spluttering speech. "I've sent for the county sheriff and a dozen
  deputies to arrest you, and you, and you, damn you!" He was pointing a
  shaking finger at the older members of the Happy Family, whom he recognized
  not gladly, but too well. "I'll have you all in Deer Lodge before that lying,
  thieving, cattle-stealing Old Man of yours can lift a finger. I'll sheep
  Flying U coulee to the very doors of the white house. I'll skin the range
  between here and the river&mdash;and I'll have every one of you hounds put
  where the dogs won't bite you!" He drew a hand across his mouth and smiled as
  they say Satan himself can smile upon occasion.</p>

  <p>"You've done enough to send you all over the road; destroying property and
  assaulting harmless men&mdash;you wait! There are other and better ways to
  fight than with the fists, and I haven't forgotten any of you
  fellows&mdash;there are a few more rounders among you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hey! You apologize fer that, by cripes, er I'll kill yuh the longest way
  I know. And that&mdash;" Big Medicine again laid violent hands upon Dunk,
  "and that way won't feel good, now I'm tellin' yuh. Apologize, er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Say, all this don't do any good, Bud," Weary expostulated. "Let Dunk
  froth at the mouth if he wants to; what we want is to get these sheep off the
  range. And," he added recklessly, "so long as the sheriff is headed for us
  anyway, we may as well get busy and make it worth his while. So&mdash;" He
  stopped, silenced by a most amazing interruption.</p>

  <p>On the brow of the hill, when first they had sighted Dunk in the hollow,
  something had gone wrong with Miguel's saddle so that he had stopped behind;
  and, to keep him company, Andy had stopped also and waited for him. Later,
  when Dunk was spluttering threats, they had galloped up to the edge of the
  group and pulled their horses to a stand. Now, Miguel rode abruptly close to
  Dunk as rides one with a purpose.</p>

  <p>He leaned and peered intently into Dunk's distorted countenance until
  every man there, struck by his manner, was watching him curiously. Then he
  sat back in the saddle, straightened his legs in the stirrups and laughed.
  And like his smile when he would have it so, or the little twitch of
  shoulders by which he could so incense a man, that laugh brought a deeper
  flush to Dunk's face, reddened though it was by Big Medicine's vigorous
  slapping.</p>

  <p>"Say, you've got nerve," drawled the Native Son, "to let a sheriff travel
  toward you. I can remember when you were more timid, amigo." He turned his
  head until his eyes fell upon Andy. "Say, Andy!" he called. "Come and take a
  look at this hombre. You'll have to think back a few years," he assisted
  laconically.</p>

  <p>In response, Andy rode up eagerly. Like the Native Son, he leaned and
  peered into eyes that stared back defiantly, wavered, and turned away. Andy
  also sat back in the saddle then, and snorted.</p>

  <p>"So this is the Dunk Whittaker that's been raising merry hell around here!
  And talks about sending for the sheriff, huh? I've always heard that a lot uh
  gall is the best disguise a man can hide under, but, by gracious, this beats
  the deuce!" He turned to the astounded Happy Family with growing excitement
  in his manner.</p>

  <p>"Boys, we don't have to worry much about this gazabo! We'll just freeze
  onto him till the sheriff heaves in sight. Gee! There'll sure be something
  stirring when we tell him who this Dunk person really is! And you say he was
  in with the Old Man, once? Oh, Lord!" He looked with withering contempt at
  Dunk; and Dunk's glance flickered again and dropped, just as his hand dropped
  to the pocket of his coat.</p>

  <p>"No, yuh don't, by cripes!" Big Medicine's hand gripped Dunk's arm on the
  instant. With his other he plucked the gun from Dunk's pocket, and released
  him as he would let go of something foul which he had been compelled to
  touch.</p>

  <p>"He'll be good, or he'll lose his dinner quick," drawled the Native Son,
  drawing his own silver-mounted six-shooter and resting it upon the saddle
  horn so that it pointed straight at Dunk's diaphragm. "You take Weary off
  somewhere and tell him something about this deal, Andy. I'll watch this
  slippery gentleman." He smiled slowly and got an answering grin from Andy
  Green, who immediately rode a few rods away, with Weary and Pink close
  behind.</p>

  <p>"Say, by golly, what's Dunk wanted fer?" Slim blurted inquisitively after
  a short silence.</p>

  <p>"Not for riding or driving over a bridge faster than a walk Slim," purred
  the Native Son, shifting his gun a trifle as Dunk moved uneasily in the
  saddle. "You know the man. Look at his face&mdash;and use your imagination,
  if you've got any."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">XIII. &mdash; THE HAPPY FAMILY LEARN SOMETHING</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WELL, I hope this farce is about over," Dunk sneered, with
  as near an approach to his old, supercilious manner as he could command, when
  the three who had ridden apart returned presently. "Perhaps, Weary, you'll be
  good enough to have this fellow put up his gun, and these&mdash;" he
  hesitated, after a swift glance, to apply any epithet whatever to the Happy
  Family. "I have two witnesses here to swear that you have without any excuse
  assaulted and maligned and threatened me, and you may consider yourselves
  lucky if I do not insist&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, cut that out," Andy advised wearily. "I don't know how it strikes the
  rest, but it sounds pretty sickening to me. Don't overlook the fact that two
  of us happen to know all about you; and we know just where to send word, to
  dig up a lot more identification. So bluffing ain't going to help you out, a
  darned bit."</p>

  <p>"Miguel, you can go with Andy," Weary said with brisk decision. "Take Dunk
  down to the ranch till the sheriff gets here&mdash;if it's straight goods
  about Dunk sending for him. If he didn't, we can take Dunk in to-morrow,
  ourselves." He turned and fixed a cold, commanding eye upon the slack-jawed
  herders. "Come along, you two, and get these sheep headed outa here."</p>

  <p>"Say, we'll just lock him up in the blacksmith shop, and come on back,"
  Andy amended the order after his own free fashion. "He couldn't get out in a
  million years; not after I'm through staking him out to the anvil with a
  log-chain." He smiled maliciously into Dunk's fear-yellowed countenance, and
  waved him a signal to ride ahead, which Dunk did without a word of protest
  while the Happy Family looked on dazedly.</p>

  <p>"What's it all about, Weary?" Irish asked, when the three were gone. "What
  is it they've got on Dunk? Must be something pretty fierce, the way he wilted
  down into the saddle."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to wait and ask the boys." Weary rode off to hurry the
  herders on the far side of the band.</p>

  <p>So the Happy Family remained perforce unenlightened upon the subject and
  for that they said hard things about Weary, and about Andy and Miguel as
  well. They believed that they were entitled to know the truth, and they
  called it a smart-aleck trick to keep the thing so almighty secret.</p>

  <p>There is in resentment a crisis; when that crisis is reached, and the dam
  of repression gives way, the full flood does not always sweep down upon those
  who have provoked the disaster. Frequently it happens that perfectly innocent
  victims are made to suffer. The Happy Family had been extremely forbearing,
  as has been pointed out before. They had frequently come to the boiling point
  of rage and had cooled without committing any real act of violence. But that
  day had held a long series of petty annoyances; and here was a really
  important thing kept from them as if they were mere outsiders. When Weary was
  gone, Irish asked Pink what crime Dunk had committed in the past. And Pink
  shook his head and said he didn't know. Irish mentally accused Pink of lying,
  and his temper was none the better for the rebuff, as anyone can readily
  understand.</p>

  <p>When the herders, therefore, rounded up the sheep and started them moving
  south, the Happy Family speedily rebelled against that shuffling, nibbling,
  desultory pace that had kept them long, weary hours in the saddle with the
  other band. But it was Irish who first took measures to accelerate that
  pace.</p>

  <p>He got down his rope and whacked the loop viciously down across the
  nearest gray back. The sheep jumped, scuttled away a few paces and returned
  to its nibbling progress. Irish called it names and whacked another.</p>

  <p>After a few minutes he grew tired of swinging his loop and seeing it have
  so fleeting an effect, and pulled his gun. He fired close to the heels of a
  yearling buck that had more than once stopped to look up at him foolishly and
  blat, and the buck charged ahead in a panic at the noise and the spat of the
  bullet behind him.</p>

  <p>"Hit him agin in the same place!" yelled Big Medicine, and drew his own
  gun. The Happy Family, at that high tension where they were ready for
  anything, caught the infection and began shooting and yelling like crazy
  men.</p>

  <p>The effect was not at all what they expected. Instead of adding impetus to
  the band, as would have been the case if they had been driving cattle, the
  result was exactly the opposite. The sheep ran&mdash;but they ran to a common
  center. As the shooting went on they bunched tighter and tighter, until it
  seemed as though those in the center must surely be crushed flat. From an
  ambling, feeding company of animals, they become a lumpy gray blanket, with
  here and there a long, vacuous face showing idiotically upon the surface.</p>

  <p>The herders grinned and drew together as against a common enemy&mdash;or
  as with a new joke to be discussed among themselves. The dogs wandered
  helplessly about, yelped half-heartedly at the woolly mass, then sat down
  upon their haunches and lolled red tongues far out over their pointed little
  teeth, and tilted knowing heads at the Happy Family.</p>

  <p>"Look at the darned things!" wailed Pink, riding twice around the huddle,
  almost ready to shed tears of pure rage and helplessness. "Git outa that! Hi!
  Woopp-ee!" He fired again and again, and gave the range-old cattle-yell; the
  yell which had sent many a tired herd over many a weary mile; the yell before
  which had fled fat steers into the stockyards at shipping time, and up the
  chutes into the cars; the yell that had hoarsened many a cowpuncher's voice
  and left him with a mere croak to curse his fate with; a yell to bring
  results&mdash;but it did not start those sheep.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family, riding furiously round and round, fired every cartridge
  they had upon their persons; they said every improper thing they could
  remember or invent; they yelled until their eyes were starting from their
  sockets; they glued that band of sheep so tight together that dynamite could
  scarcely have pried them apart.</p>

  <p>And the herders, sitting apart with grimy hands clasped loosely over
  hunched-up knees, looked on, and talked together in low tones, and
  grinned.</p>

  <p>Irish glanced that way and caught them grinning; caught them pointing
  derisively, with heaving shoulders. He swore a great oath and made for them,
  calling aloud that he would knock those grins so far in that they would
  presently find themselves smiling wrong-side-out from the back of their
  heads.</p>

  <p>Pink, overhearing him, gave a last swat at the waggling tail of a
  burrowing buck, and wheeled to overtake Irish and have a hand in reversing
  the grins. Big Medicine saw them start, and came bellowing up from the far
  side of the huddle like a bull challenging to combat from across a meadow.
  Big Medicine did not know what it was all about, but he scented battle, and
  that was sufficient. Cal Emmett and Weary, equally ignorant of the cause,
  started at a lope toward the trouble center.</p>

  <p>It began to look as if the whole Family was about to fall upon those
  herders and rend them asunder with teeth and nails; so much so that the
  herders jumped up and ran like scared cottontails toward the rim of Denson
  coulee, a hundred yards or so to the west.</p>

  <p>"Mamma! I wish we could make the sheep hit that gait and keep it,"
  exclaimed Weary, with the first laugh they had heard from him that day.</p>

  <p>While he was still laughing, there was a shot from the ridge toward which
  they were running; the sharp, vicious crack of a rifle. The Happy Family
  heard the whistling hum of the bullet, singing low over their heads; quite
  low indeed; altogether too low to be funny. And they had squandered all their
  ammunition on the prairie sod, to hurry a band of sheep that flatly refused
  to hurry anywhere except under one another's odorous, perspiring bodies.</p>

  <p>From the edge of the coulee the rifle spoke again. A tiny geyser of dust,
  spurting up from the ground ten feet to one side of Cal Emmett, showed them
  all where the bullet struck.</p>

  <p>"Get outa range, everybody!" yelled Weary, and set the example by tilting
  his rowels against Glory's smooth hide, and heading eastward. "I like to be
  accommodating, all right, but I draw the line on standing around for a target
  while my neighbors practise shooting."</p>

  <p>The Happy Family, having no other recourse, therefore retreated in haste
  toward the eastern skyline. Bullets followed them, overtook them as the
  shooter raised his sights for the increasing distance, and whined harmlessly
  over their heads. All save one.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">XIV. &mdash; HAPPY JACK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BIG MEDICINE, Irish and Pink, racing almost abreast, heard a
  scream behind them and pulled up their horses with short, stiff-legged
  plunges. A brown horse overtook them; a brown horse, with Happy Jack clinging
  to the saddle-horn, his body swaying far over to one side. Even as he went
  hurtling past them his hold grew slack and he slumped, head foremost, to the
  ground. The brown horse gave a startled leap away from him and went on with
  empty stirrups flapping.</p>

  <p>They sprang down and lifted him to a less awkward position, and Big
  Medicine pillowed the sweat-dampened, carroty head in the hollow of his arm.
  Those who had been in the lead looked back startled when the brown horse tore
  past them with that empty saddle; saw what had happened, wheeled and galloped
  back. They dismounted and stood silently grouped about poor, ungainly Happy
  Jack, lying there limp and motionless in Big Medicine's arms. Not one of them
  remembered then that there was a man with a rifle not more than two hundred
  yards away; or, if they did, they quite forgot that the rifle might be
  dangerous to themselves. They were thinking of Happy Jack.</p>

  <p>Happy Jack, butt of all their jokes and jibes; Happy the croaker, the
  lugubrious forecaster of trouble; Happy Jack, the ugliest, the stupidest, the
  softest-hearted man of them all. He had "betched" there would be someone
  killed, over these Dot sheep; he had predicted trouble of every conceivable
  kind; and they had laughed at him, swore at him, lied to him, "joshed" him
  unmercifully, and kept him in a state of chronic indignation, never dreaming
  that the memory of it would choke them and strike them dumb with that
  horrible, dull weight in their chests with which men suffer when a woman
  would find the relief of weeping.</p>

  <p>"Where's he hurt?" asked Weary, in the repressed tone which only tragedy
  can bring into a man's voice, and knelt beside Big Medicine.</p>

  <p>"I dunno&mdash;through the lungs, I guess; my sleeve's gitting soppy right
  under his shoulder." Big Medicine did not bellow; his voice was as quiet as
  Weary's.</p>

  <p>Weary looked up briefly at the circle of staring faces. "Pink, you pile
  onto Glory and go wire for a doctor. Try Havre first; you may get one up on
  the nine o' clock train. If you can't, get one down on the 'leven-twenty,
  from Great Falls. Or there's Benton&mdash;anyway, git one. If you could catch
  MacPherson, do it. Try him first, and never mind a Havre doctor unless you
  can't get MacPherson. I'd rather wait a couple of hours longer, for him. I'll
  have a rig&mdash;no, you better get a team from Jim. They'll be fresh, and
  you can put 'em through. If you kill 'em," he added grimly, "we can pay for
  'em." He had his jack-knife out, and was already slashing carefully the shirt
  of Happy Jack, that he might inspect the wound.</p>

  <p>Pink gave a last, wistful look at Happy Jack's face, which seemed
  unfamiliar with all the color and all the expression wiped out of it like
  that, and turned away. "Come and help me change saddles, Cal," he said
  shortly. "Weary's stirrups are too darned long." Even with the delay, he was
  mounted on Glory and galloping toward Flying U coulee before Weary was
  through uncovering the wound; and that does not mean that Weary was slow.</p>

  <p>The rifle cracked again, and a bullet plucked into the sod twenty feet
  beyond the circle of men and horses. But no one looked up or gave any other
  sign of realization that they were still the target; they were staring, with
  that frowning painfully intent look men have at such moments, at a purplish
  hole not much bigger than if punched by a lead pencil, just under the point
  of Happy Jack's shoulder blade; and at the blood oozing sluggishly from it in
  a tiny stream across the girlishly white flesh and dripping upon Big
  Medicine's arm.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't we better get a rig to take him home with?" Irish suggested.</p>

  <p>Weary, exploring farther, had just disclosed a ragged wound under the arm
  where the bullet had passed out; he made no immediate reply.</p>

  <p>"Well, he ain't got it stuck inside of 'im, anyway," Big Medicine
  commented relievedly. "Don't look to me like it's so awful bad&mdash;went
  through kinda anglin', and maybe missed his lungs. I've saw men shot up
  before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw&mdash;I betche you'd&mdash;think it was bad&mdash;if you had
  it&mdash;" murmured Happy Jack peevishly, lifting his eyelids heavily for a
  resentful glance when they moved him a little. But even as Big Medicine
  grinned joyfully down at him he went off again into mental darkness, and the
  grin faded into solicitude.</p>

  <p>"You'd kick, by golly, if you was goin' to be hung," Slim bantered tritely
  and belatedly, and gulped remorsefully when he saw that he was "joshing" an
  unconscious man.</p>

  <p>"We better get him home. Irish, you&mdash;" Weary looked up and discovered
  that Irish and Jack Bates were already headed for home and a conveyance. He
  gave a sigh of approval and turned his attention toward wiping the sweat and
  grime from Happy's face with his handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Somebody else is goin' to git hit, by golly, if we stay here," Slim
  blurted suddenly, when another bullet dug up the dirt in that vicinity.</p>

  <p>"That gol-darned fool'll keep on till he kills somebody. I wisht I had m'
  thirty-thirty here&mdash;I'd make him wisht his mother was a man, by
  golly!"</p>

  <p>Big Medicine looked toward the coulee rim. "I ain't got a shell left," he
  growled regretfully. "I wisht we'd thought to tell the boys to bring them
  rifles. Say, Slim, you crawl onto your hoss and go git 'em. It won't take
  more'n a minute. There'll likely be some shells in the magazines."</p>

  <p>"Go on, Slim," urged Weary grimly. "We've got to do something. They can't
  do a thing like this&mdash;"he glanced down at Happy Jack- &mdash;"and get
  away with it."</p>

  <p>"I got half a box uh shells for my thirty-thirty, I'll bring that." Slim
  turned to go, stopped short and stared at the coulee rim. "By golly, they're
  comm' over here!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Big Medicine glanced up, took off his hat, crumpled it for a pillow and
  eased Happy Jack down upon it. He got up stiffly, wiped his fingers
  mechanically upon his trouser legs, broke his gun open just to make sure that
  it was indeed empty, put it back and picked up a handful of rocks.</p>

  <p>"Let 'em come," he said viciously. "I c'n kill every damn' one with m'
  bare hands!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">XV. &mdash; OLESON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"SAY, ain't that Andy and Mig following along behind?" Cal
  asked after a minute of watching the approach. "Sure, it is. Now
  what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They're drivin' 'em, by cripes!" Big Medicine, under the stress of the
  moment, returned to his usual bellowing tone. "Who's that tall, lanky feller
  in the lead? I don't call to mind ever seeing him before. Them four herders I'd
  know a mile off."</p>

  <p>"That?" Weary shaded his eyes with his hat-brim, against the slant rays of
  the westering sun. "That's Oleson, Dunk's partner."</p>

  <p>"His mother'd be a-weepin'," Big Medicine observed bodefully, "if she
  knowed what was due to happen to her son right away quick. Must be him that
  done the shootin'."</p>

  <p>They came on steadily, the four herders and Oleson walking reluctantly
  ahead, with Andy Green and the Native Son riding relentlessly in the rear,
  their guns held unwaveringly in a line with the backs of their captives. Andy
  was carrying a rifle, evidently taken from one of the men&mdash;Oleson, they
  judged for the guilty one. Half the distance was covered when Andy was seen
  to turn his head and speak briefly with the Native Son, after which he lunged
  past the captives and galloped up to the waiting group. His quick eye sought
  first the face of Happy Jack in anxious questioning; then, miserably, he
  searched the faces of his friends.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he exclaimed mechanically, dismounted and bent over the
  figure on the ground. For a long minute he knelt there; he laid his ear close
  to Happy Jack's mouth, took off his glove and laid his hand over Happy's
  heart; reached up, twitched off his neckerchief, shook out the creases and
  spread it reverently over Happy Jack's face. He stood up then and spoke
  slowly, his eyes fixed upon the stumbling approach of the captives.</p>

  <p>"Pink told us Happy had been shot, so we rode around and come up behind
  'em. It was a cinch. And&mdash;say, boys, we've got the Dots in a pocket.
  They've got to eat outa our hands, now. So don't think about&mdash;our own
  feelings, or about&mdash;" he stopped abruptly and let a downward glance
  finish the sentence. "We've got to keep our own hands clean, and&mdash;now
  don't let your fingers get the itch, Bud!" This, because of certain
  manifestations of a murderous intent on the part of Big Medicine.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's all right to talk, if yuh feel like talking," Big Medicine
  retorted savagely. "I don't." He made a catlike spring at the foremost man,
  who happened to be Oleson, and got a merciless grip with his fingers on his
  throat, snarling like a predatory animal over its kill. From behind, Andy,
  with Weary to help, pulled him off.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean to&mdash;to kill anybody," gasped Oleson, pasty white. "I
  heard a lot of shooting, and so I ran up the hill&mdash;and the herders came
  running toward me, and I thought I was defending my property and men. I had a
  right to defend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Defend hell!" Big Medicine writhed in the restraining grasp of those who
  held him. "Look at that there! As good hearted a boy as ever turned a cow!
  Never harmed a soul in 'is life. Is all your dirty, stinkin' sheep, an' all
  your lousy herders, worth that boy's life? Yuh shot 'im down like a
  dog&mdash;lemme go, boys." His voice was husky. "Lemme tromp the life outa
  him."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were killing my men, or I never&mdash;I never meant
  to&mdash;to kill&mdash;" Oleson, shaking till he could scarcely stand, broke
  down and wept; wept pitiably, hysterically, as men of a certain fiber will
  weep when black tragedy confronts them all unawares. He cowered miserably
  before the Happy Family, his face hidden behind his two hands.</p>

  <p>"Boys, I want to say a word or two. Come over here." Andy's voice, quiet
  as ever, contrasted strangely with the man's sobbing. He led them back a few
  paces&mdash;Weary, Cal, Big Medicine and Slim, and spoke hurriedly. The
  Native Son eyed them sidelong from his horse, but he was careful to keep
  Oleson covered with his gun&mdash;and the herders too, although they were
  unarmed. Once or twice he glanced at that long, ungainly figure in the grass
  with the handkerchief of Andy Green hiding the face except where a corner,
  fluttering in the faint breeze which came creeping out of the west, lifted
  now and then and gave a glimpse of sunbrowned throat and a quiet chin and
  mouth.</p>

  <p>"Quit that blubbering, Oleson, and listen here." Andys voice broke
  relentlessly upon the other's woe. "All these boys want to hang yuh without
  any red tape; far as I'm concerned, I'm dead willing. But we're going to give
  yuh a chance. Your partner, as we told yuh coming over, we've got the dead
  immortal cinch on, right now. And&mdash;well you can see what you're up
  against. But we'll give yuh a chance. Have you got any family?"</p>

  <p>Oleson, trying to pull himself together, shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, you can get rid of them sheep, can't yuh? Sell 'em, ship 'em
  outa here&mdash;we don't give a darn what yuh do, only so yuh get 'em off the
  range."</p>

  <p>"Y-yes, I'll do that." Oleson's consent was reluctant, but it was fairly
  prompt. "I'll get rid of the sheep," he said, as if he was minded to clinch
  the promise. "I'll do it at once."</p>

  <p>"That's nice." Andy spoke with grim irony. "And you'll get rid of the
  ranch, too. You'll sell it to the Flying U&mdash;cheap."</p>

  <p>"But my partner&mdash;Whittaker might object&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look here, old-timer. You'll fix that part up; you'll find a way of
  fixing it. Look here&mdash;at what you're up against." He waited, with
  pointing finger, for one terrible minute. "Will you sell to the Flying
  U?"</p>

  <p>"Y-yes!" The word was really a gulp. He tried to avoid looking where Andy
  pointed; failed, and shuddered at what he saw.</p>

  <p>"I thought you would. We'll get that in writing. And we're going to wait
  just exactly twenty-four hours before we make a move. It'll take some fine
  work, but we'll do it. Our boss, here, will fix up the business end with you.
  He'll go with yuh right now, and stay with yuh till you make good. And the
  first crooked move you make&mdash;" Andy, in unconscious imitation of the
  Native Son, shrugged a shoulder expressively and urged Weary by a glance to
  take the leadership.</p>

  <p>"Irish, you come with me. The rest of you fellows know about what to do.
  Andy, I guess you'll have to ride point till I get back." Weary hesitated,
  looked from Happy Jack to Oleson and the herders, and back to the sober faces
  of his fellows. "Do what you can for him, boys&mdash;and I wish one of you
  would ride over, after Pink gets back, and&mdash;let me know how things stack
  up, will you?"</p>

  <p>Incredible as was the situation on the face of it, nevertheless it was
  extremely matter-of-fact in the handling; which is the way sometimes with
  incredible situations; as if, since we know instinctively that we cannot rise
  unprepared to the bigness of its possibilities, we keep our feet planted
  steadfastly on the ground and refuse to rise at all. And afterward, perhaps,
  we look back and wonder how it all came about.</p>

  <p>At the last moment Weary turned back and exchanged guns with Andy Green,
  because his own was empty and he realized the possible need of one&mdash;or
  at least the need of having the sheep-men perfectly aware that he had one
  ready for use. The Native Son, without a word of comment, handed his own
  silver-trimmed weapon over to Irish, and rolled a cigarette deftly with one
  hand while he watched them ride away.</p>

  <p>"Does this strike anybody else as being pretty raw?" he inquired calmly,
  dismounting among them. "I'd do a good deal for the outfit, myself; but
  letting that man get off&mdash;Say, you fellows up this way don't think
  killing a man amounts to much, do you?" He looked from one to the other with
  a queer, contemptuous hostility in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Andy Green took a forward step and laid a hand familiarly on his rigid
  shoulder. "Quit it, Mig. We would do a lot for the outfit; that's the God's
  truth. And I played the game right up to the hilt, I admit. But nobody's
  killed. I told Happy to play dead. By gracious, I caught him just in the nick
  uh time; he'd been setting up, in another minute." To prove it, he bent and
  twitched the handkerchief from the face of Happy Jack, and Happy opened his
  eyes and made shift to growl.</p>

  <p>"Yuh purty near-smothered me t'death, darn yuh."</p>

  <p>"Dios!" breathed the Native Son, for once since they knew him jolted out
  of his eternal calm. "God, but I'm glad!"</p>

  <p>"I guess the rest of us ain't," insinuated Andy softly, and lifted his hat
  to wipe the sweat off his forehead. "I will say that&mdash;" After all, he
  did not. Instead, he knelt beside Happy Jack and painstakingly adjusted the
  crumpled hat a hair's breadth differently.</p>

  <p>"How do yuh feel, old-timer?" be asked with a very thin disguise of
  cheerfulness upon the anxiety of his tone.</p>

  <p>"Well, I could feel a lot&mdash;better, without hurtin' nothin," Happy
  Jack responded somberly. "I hope you fellers&mdash;feel better, now. Yuh got
  'em&mdash;tryin' to murder&mdash;the hull outfit; jes' like I&mdash;told yuh
  they would&mdash;" Gunshot wounds, contrary to the tales of certain
  sentimentalists, do not appreciably sweeten, or even change, a man's
  disposition. Happy Jack with a bullet hole through one side of him was still
  Happy Jack.</p>

  <p>"Aw, quit your beefin'," Big Medicine advised gruffly. "A feller with a
  hole in his lung yuh could throw a calf through sideways ain't got no
  business statin' his views on nothin', by cripes!"</p>

  <p>"Aw gwan. I thought you said&mdash;it didn't amount t' nothin'," Happy
  reminded him, anxiety stealing into his face.</p>

  <p>"Well, it don't. May lay yuh up a day or two; wouldn't be su'prised if yuh
  had to stay on the bed-ground two or three meals. But look at Slim, here.
  Shot through the leg&mdash;shattered a bone, by cripes!&mdash;las' night,
  only; and here he's makin' a hand and ridin' and cussin' same as any of us
  t'day. We ain't goin' to let yuh grouch around, that's all. We claim we got a
  vacation comm' to us; you're shot up, now, and that's fun enough for one man,
  without throwin' it into the whole bunch. Why, a little nick like that ain't
  nothin'; nothin' a-tall. Why, I've been shot right through here, by
  cripes"&mdash;Big Medicine laid an impressive finger-tip on the top button of
  his trousers&mdash;"and it come out back here"&mdash;he whirled and showed
  his thumb against the small of his back&mdash;"and I never laid off but that
  day and part uh the next. I was sore," he admitted, goggling Happy Jack
  earnestly, "but I kep' a-goin'. I was right in fall roundup, an' I had to. A
  man can't lay down an' cry, by cripes, jes' because he gets pinked a
  little&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw, that's jest because&mdash;it ain't you. I betche you'd lay 'em
  down&mdash;jest like other folks, if yuh got shot&mdash;through the lungs.
  That ain't no&mdash;joke, lemme tell yuh!" Happy Jack was beginning to show
  considerable spirit for a wounded man. So much spirit that Andy Green, who
  had seen men stricken down with various ills, read fever signs in the
  countenance and in the voice of Happy, and led Big Medicine somewhat
  peremptorily out of ear-shot.</p>

  <p>"Ain't you got any sense?" he inquired with fine candor. "What do you want
  to throw it into him like that, for? You may not think so, but he's pretty
  bad off&mdash;if you ask me."</p>

  <p>Big Medicine's pale eyes turned commiseratingly toward Happy Jack. "I know
  he is; I ain't no fool. I was jest tryin' to cheer 'im up a little. He was
  beginnin' to look like he was gittin' scared about it; I reckon maybe I made
  a break, sayin' what I did about it, so I jest wanted to take the cuss off.
  Honest to gran'ma&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you know anything at all about such things, you must know what fever
  means in such a case. And, recollect, it's going to be quite a while before a
  doctor can get here."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll be careful. Maybe I did throw it purty strong; I won't, no
  more." Big Medicine s meekness was not the least amazing incident of the day.
  He was a big-hearted soul under his bellow and bluff, and his sympathy for
  Happy Jack struck deep. He went back walking on his toes, and he stood so
  that his sturdy body shaded Happy Jack's face from the sun, and he did not
  open his mouth for another word until Irish and Jack Bates came rattling up
  with the spring wagon hurriedly transformed with mattress, pillows and
  blankets into an ambulance.</p>

  <p>They had been thoughtful to a degree. They brought with them a jug of
  water and a tin cup, and they gave Happy Jack a long, cooling drink of it and
  bathed his face before they lifted him into the wagon. And of all the hands
  that ministered to his needs, the hands of Big Medicine were the eagerest and
  gentlest, and his voice was the most vibrant with sympathy; which was saying
  a good deal.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">XVI. &mdash; THE END OF THE DOTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SLIM may not have been more curious than his fellows, but he
  was perhaps more single-hearted in his loyalty to the outfit. To him the
  shooting of Happy Jack, once he felt assured that the wound was not
  necessarily fatal, became of secondary importance. It was all in behalf of
  the Flying U; and if the bullet which laid Happy Jack upon the ground was
  also the means of driving the hated Dots from that neighborhood, he felt, in
  his slow, phlegmatic way, that it wasn't such a catastrophe as some of the
  others seemed to think. Of course, he wouldn't want Happy to die; but he
  didn't believe, after all, that Happy was going to do anything like that. Old
  Patsy knew a lot about sickness and wounds. (Who can cook for a cattle
  outfit, for twenty years and more, and not know a good deal of hurts?) Old
  Patsy had looked Happy over carefully, and had given a grin and a snort.</p>

  <p>"Py cosh, dot vos lucky for you, alreatty," he had pronounced. "So you
  don't git plood-poisonings, mit fever, you be all right pretty soon. You go
  to shleep, yet. I fix you oop till der dochtor he cooms. I seen fellers shot
  plumb through der middle off dem, und git yell. You ain't shot so bad. You go
  to shleep."</p>

  <p>So, his immediate fears relieved, Slim's slow mind had swung back to the
  Dots, and to Oleson, whom Weary was even now assisting to keep his promise
  (Slim grinned widely to himself when he thought of the abject fear which
  Oleson had displayed because of the murder he thought he had done, while
  Happy Jack obediently "played dead"). And of Dunk, whom Slim had hated most
  abominably of old; Dunk, a criminal found out; Dunk, a prisoner right there
  on the very ranch he had thought to despoil; Dunk, at that very moment locked
  in the blacksmith shop. Perhape it was not curiosity alone which sent him
  down there; perhaps it was partly a desire to look upon Dunk humbled&mdash;he
  who had trodden so arrogantly upon the necks of those below him; so
  arrogantly that even Slim, the slow-witted one, had many a time trembled with
  anger at his tone.</p>

  <p>Slim walked slowly, as was his wont; with deadly directness, as was his
  nature. The blacksmith shop was silent, closed&mdash;as grimly noncommittal
  as a vault. You might guess whatever you pleased about its inmate; it was
  like trying to imagine the emotions pictured upon the face behind a smooth,
  black mask. Slim stopped before the closed door and listened. The rusty, iron
  hasp attracted his slow gaze, at first puzzling him a little, making him
  vaguely aware that something about it did not quite harmonize with his mental
  attitude toward it. It took him a full minute to realize that he had expected
  to find the door locked, and that the hasp hung downward uselessly, just as
  it hung every day in the year.</p>

  <p>He remembered then that Andy had spoken of chaining Dunk to the anvil.
  That would make it unnecessary to lock the door, of course. Slim seized the
  hanging strip of iron, gave it a jerk and bathed all the dingy interior with
  a soft, sunset glow. Cobwebs quivered at the inrush of the breeze, and
  glistened like threads of fine gold. The forge remained a dark blot in the
  corner. A new chisel, lying upon the earthen floor, became a bar of yellow
  light.</p>

  <p>Slim's eyes went to the anvil and clung there in a widening stare. His
  hands, white and soft when his gloves were off, drew up convulsively into
  fighting fists, and as he stood looking, the cords swelled and stood out upon
  his thick neck. For years he had hated Dunk Whittaker&mdash;</p>

  <p>The Happy Family, with rare good sense, had not hesitated to turn the
  white house into an impromptu hospital. They knew that if the Little Doctor
  and Chip and the Old Man had been at home Happy Jack would have been taken
  unquestioningly into the guest chamber&mdash;which was a square,
  three-windowed room off the big livingroom. More than one of them had
  occupied it upon occasion. They took Happy Jack up there and put him to bed
  quite as a matter-of-course, and when he was asleep they lingered upon the
  wide, front porch; the hammock of the Little Doctor squeaked under the weight
  of Andy Green, and the wide-armed chairs received the weary forms of divers
  young cowpunchers who did not give a thought to the intrusion, but were
  thankful for the comfort. Andy was swinging luxuriously and drawing the last
  few puffs from a cigarette when Slim, purple and puffing audibly, appeared
  portentously before him.</p>

  <p>"I thought you said you was goin' to lock Dunk up in the blacksmith shop,"
  he launched accusingly at Andy.</p>

  <p>"We did," averred that young man, pushing his toe against the railing to
  accelerate the voluptuous motion of the hammock.</p>

  <p>"He ain't there. He's broke loose. The chain&mdash;by golly, yuh went an'
  used that chain that was broke an' jest barely hangin' together! His horse
  ain't anywheres around, either. You fellers make me sick. Lollin' around here
  an' not paying no attention, by golly&mdash;he's liable to be ten mile from
  here by this time!" When Slim stopped, his jaw quivered like a dish of
  disturbed jelly, and I wish I could give you his tone; choppy, every sentence
  an accusation that should have made those fellows wince.</p>

  <p>Irish, Big Medicine and Jack Bates had sprung guiltily to their feet and
  started down the steps. The drawling voice of the Native Son stopped them,
  ten feet from the porch.</p>

  <p>"Twelve, or fifteen, I should make it. That horse of his looked to me like
  a drifter."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;are yuh goin' t' set there on your haunches an' let him GO?"
  Slim, by the look of him, was ripe for murder.</p>

  <p>"You want to look out, or you'll get apoplexy sure," Andy soothed, giving
  himself another luxurious push and pulling the last, little whiff from his
  cigarette before he threw away the stub. "Fat men can't afford to get as
  excited as skinny ones can."</p>

  <p>"Aw, say! Where did you put him, Andy?" asked Big Medicine, his first
  flurry subsiding before the absolute calm of those two on the porch.</p>

  <p>"In the blacksmith shop," said Andy, with a slurring accent on the first
  word that made the whole sentence perfectly maddening. "Ah, come on back here
  and sit down. I guess we better tell 'em the how of it. Huh, Mig?"</p>

  <p>Miguel cast a slow, humorous glance over the four. "Ye-es&mdash; they'll
  have us treed in about two minutes if we don't," he assented. "Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"Well," Andy lifted his head and shoulders that he might readjust a pillow
  to his liking, "we wanted him to make a getaway. Fact is, if he hadn't, we'd
  have been&mdash;strictly up against it. Right! If he hadn't&mdash;how about
  it, Mig? I guess we'd have been to the Little Rockies ourselves."</p>

  <p>"You've got a sweet little voice," Irish cut in savagely, "but we're
  tired. We'd rather hear yuh say something!"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;all right. Well, Mig and I just ribbed up a josh on Dunk. I'd
  read somewhere about the same kinda deal, so it ain't original; I don't lay
  any claim to the idea at all; we just borrowed it. You see, it's like this:
  We figured that a man as mean as this Dunk person most likely had stepped
  over the line, somewhere. So we just took a gambling chance, and let him do
  the rest. You see, we never saw him before in our lives. All that
  identification stunt of ours was just a bluff. But the minute I shoved my
  chips to the center, I knew we had him dead to rights. You were there. You
  saw him wilt. By gracious&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yuh don't know anything against him?" gasped Irish.</p>

  <p>"Not a darned thing&mdash;any more than what you all know," testified Andy
  complacently.</p>

  <p>It took a minute or two for that to sink in.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be damned!" breathed Irish.</p>

  <p>"We did chain him to the anvil," Andy went on. "On the way down, we talked
  about being in a hurry to get back to you fellows, and I told Mig&mdash;so
  Dunk could hear&mdash;that we wouldn't bother with the horse. We tied him to
  the corral. And I hunted around for that bum chain, and then we made out we
  couldn't find the padlock for the door; so we decided, right out loud, that
  he'd be dead safe for an hour or two, till the bunch of us got back. Not
  knowing a darn thing about him, except what you boys have told us, we sure
  would have been in bad if he hadn't taken a sneak. Fact is, we were kinda
  worried for fear he wouldn't have nerve enough to try it. We waited, up on
  the hill, till we saw him sneak down to the corral and jump on his horse and
  take off down the coulee like a scared coyote. It was," quoth the young man,
  unmistakably pleased with himself, "pretty smooth work, if you ask me."</p>

  <p>"I'd hate to ride as fast and far to-night as that hombre will,"
  supplemented Miguel with his brief smile, that was just a flash of white,
  even teeth and a momentary lightening of his languorous eyes.</p>

  <p>Slim stood for five minutes, a stolid, stocky figure in the midst of a
  storm of congratulatory comment. They forgot all about Happy Jack, asleep
  inside the house, and so their voices were not hushed. Indeed, Big Medicine's
  bull-like remarks boomed full- throated across the coulee and were flung back
  mockingly by the barren hills. Slim did not hear a word they were saying; he
  was thinking it over, with that complete mental concentration which is the
  chief recompense of a slow-working mind. He was methodically thinking it all
  out&mdash;and, eventually, he saw the joke.</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly!" he bawled suddenly, and brought his palm down with a
  terrific smack upon his sore leg&mdash;whereat his fellows laughed
  uproariously.</p>

  <p>"We told you not to try to see through any more jokes till your leg gets
  well, Slim," Andy reminded condescendingly.</p>

  <p>"Say, by golly, that's a good one on Dunk, ain't it? Chasin' himself clean
  outa the country, by golly&mdash;scared plumb to death&mdash;-and you fellers
  was only jest makin' b'lieve yuh knowed him! By golly, that sure is a good
  one, all right!"</p>

  <p>"You've got it; give you time enough and you could see through a
  barbed-wire fence," patronized Andy, from the hammock. "Yes, since you
  mention it, I think myself it ain't so bad."</p>

  <p>"Aw-w shut up, out there, an' let a feller sleep!" came a querulous voice
  from within. "I'd ruther bed down with a corral full uh calves at weanin'
  time, than be anywheres within ten mile uh you darned, mouthy&mdash;" The
  rest was indistinguishable, but it did not matter. The Happy Family, save
  Slim, who stayed to look after the patient, tiptoed penitently off the porch
  and took themselves and their enthusiasm down to the bunk-house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">XVII. &mdash; GOOD NEWS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">PINK rolled over in his bed so that he might
  look&mdash;however sleepily&mdash;upon his fellows, dressing more or less
  quietly in the cool dawn-hour.</p>

  <p>"Say, I got a letter for you, Weary," he yawned, stretching both arms
  above his head. "I opened it and read it; it was from Chip, so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What did he have to say?"</p>

  <p>"Old Man any better?"</p>

  <p>"How they comm', back here?"</p>

  <p>Several voices, speaking at once, necessitated a delayed reply.</p>

  <p>"They'll be here, to-day or to-morrow," Pink replied without any
  circumlocution whatever, while he fumbled in his coat pocket for the letter.
  "He says the Old Man wants to come, and the doctors think he might as well
  tackle it as stay there fussing over it. They're coming in a special car, and
  we've got to rig up an outfit to meet him. The Little Doctor tells just how
  she wants things fixed. I thought maybe it was important&mdash;it come
  special delivery," Pink added naively, "so I just played it was mine and read
  it."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Cadwalloper," Weary assured him while he read hastily
  the letter. "Well, we'll fix up the spring wagon and take it in right away;
  somebody's got to go back anyway, with MacPherson. Hello, Cal; how's
  Happy?"</p>

  <p>"All right," answered Cal, who had watched over him during the night and
  came in at that moment after someone to take his place in the sickroom.
  "Waked up on the fight because I just happened to be setting with my eyes
  shut. I wasn't asleep, but he said I was; claimed I snored so loud I kept him
  awake all night. Gee whiz! I'd ruther nurse a she bear with the mumps!"</p>

  <p>"Old Man's coming home, Cal." Pink announced with more joy in his tone and
  in his face than had appeared in either for many a weary day. Whereupon Cal
  gave an exultant whoop. "Go tell that to Happy," he shouted. "Maybe he'll
  forget a grouch or two. Say, luck seems to be kinda casting loving glances
  our way again&mdash; what?"</p>

  <p>"By golly, seems to me Pink oughta told us when he come in, las' night,"
  grumbled Slim, when he could make himself heard.</p>

  <p>"You were all dead to the world," Pink defended, "and I wanted to be. Two
  o'clock in the morning is a mighty poor time for elegant conversation, if you
  want my opinion."</p>

  <p>"And the main point is, you knew all about it, and you didn't give a darn
  whether we did or not," Irish said bluntly. "And Weary sneaked in, too, and
  never let a yip outa him about things over in Denson coulee."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what was the use?" asked Weary blandly. "I got an option out of
  Oleson for the ranch and outfit, and all his sheep, at a mighty good
  figure&mdash;for the Flying U. The Old Man can do what he likes about it; but
  ten to one he'll buy him out. That is, Oleson's share, which was two-thirds.
  I kinda counted on Dunk letting go easy. And," he added, reaching for his
  hat, "once I got the papers for it, there wasn't anything to hang around for,
  was there? Especially," he said with his old, sunny smile, "when we weren't
  urged a whole lot to stay."</p>

  <p>Remained therefore little, save the actual arrival of the Old Man&mdash;a
  pitifully weak Old Man, bandaged and odorous with antiseptics, and quite
  pathetically glad to be back home&mdash;and his recovery, which was rather
  slow, and the recovery of Happy Jack, which was rapid.</p>

  <p>For a brief space the Flying U outfit owned the Dots; very brief it was;
  not a day longer than it took Chip to find a buyer&mdash;at a figure
  considerably above that named in the option, by the way.</p>

  <p>So, after a season of worry and trouble and impending tragedy such as no
  man may face unflinchingly, life dropped back to its usual level, and the
  trail of the Flying U outfit once more led through pleasant places.</p>
