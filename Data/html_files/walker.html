<p>(The following biography is taken from <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Walker_%28explorer%29"
target="_blank">Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a> Thanks to
David Moss, the author of the article.)</p>

<p>Frederick Walker was born in England around 1820 and died of
gulf fever in Floraville, Queensland on 19 September 1866.</p>

<p>Walker emigrated to Australia as a young man. He held the
position of Clerk of Petty Sessions in Tumut, NSW, before he was
appointed as the first Commandant of the Native Police on the
recommendation of William Charles Wentworth and Augustus Morris,
two members of the Legislative Council.</p>

<p>As Commandant of the Corps of Native Police, Walker was
spectacularly successsful ending the depradations of the Bigambul
people in the Macintyre district.</p>

<p>In 1861 Walker led a party in search of the ill fated <a href=
"burkeandwills.html" target="_blank">Burke and Wills expedition</a>
and kept a meticulous journal of the search. Walker's Creek,
located near Marathon Station in far north Queensland is named
after Frederick Walker.</p>

<p>Frederick Walker's grave is located 71 kilometers south of the
township on Floraville Station, in far north Queensland. The
inscription reads:</p>

<p>&quot;On August 17 1848 Frederick Walker, aged 28, was appointed
to the position of Commandant of the Corps of Native Police having
emigrated from Australia from England. The Corps commenced with
fourteen troopers recruited from four different New South Wales
tribes. In 1850 Walker had three units and two lieutenants in the
corps and by 1852 he increased the Corps with 48 additional
Aboriginal troopers who were drilled and trained in the use of
carbines, swords, saddles and bridles. The Native Mounted Police
Corps were responsible for maintaining law and order beyond the
settled districts. On 12 October 1854 Walker was dismissed from the
service for impropriety of conduct due to his heavy drinking. After
his dismissal he continued to live on the frontier and briefly
formed an illegal force of ten ex-troopers from the Native Police
Corps to protect settlers in the Upper Dawson region. In August of
1861 fears had grown for the safety of the Burke and Wills
expedition and Walker was sent at the insistence of the Royal
Society of Victoria to search for the ill-fated expedition.</p>

<p>&quot;Frederick Walker was in many ways a remarkable man. His
exploration of the Gulf assisted in opening up the region and his
maps were considered accurate. Walker did not find Burke and Wills
but he did find Camp 119, the last Burke and Wills camp before they
turned south on their return journey. After lengthy explorations of
the Gulf region Walker was then employed by the Superintendant of
Electric Telegraph to survey a 500 mile route from Bowen to
Burketown in a bid to compete against South Australia to have
Burketown the end of the Trans-Oceanic link from Europe. Although
Frederick Walker lost the race and Darwin became the terminus. He
did survey the line. He arrived in Burketown with his party of four
Europeans and four Aboriginal assistants at the height of the Gulf
Fever - a typhoid which affected the Gulf after the arrival in
Burketown of a vessel on which all the crew except the Captain
died. Walker commenced his return journey but at Floraville he
became ill and after several days he also died of the Gulf Fever on
19 September 1866. The entry in the expedition's logbook recorded
the passing of a pioneer of the gulf: 'as soon as the horses were
brought up and a couple saddled Perrier and Ewan were starting for
the doctor of the Leichhardt search expedition which was camped
about six miles off. But he (Walker) died before they mounted. He
died at noon and was buried on the evening of the same day. So
ended the life of a remarkable Australian.&quot;</p>
