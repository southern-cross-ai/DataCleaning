<h3><b><a name="a14" id="a14"></a> Changes to Australian Copyright
Law</b>
</h3>

<p>In Australia there is no system of registration for copyright
protection. You do not need to publish your work, to put a
copyright notice on it, or to do anything else to be covered by
copyright&mdash;the protection is free and automatic. There are no
forms to fill in, and there are no fees to be paid. You do not have
to send your work to the Australian Copyright Council or to anyone
else. Further, as a result of international treaties, such as the
Berne Convention, Australian copyright works are protected in most
other countries, and copyright works from most other countries are
protected in Australia.</p>

<p>Under Australian copyright law, work published (anywhere in the
world) in an author's lifetime are, in Australia, protected for the
life of the author plus 70 years from the end of the year of the
author's death. After the protection period, they enter the
&quot;public domain&quot;. However, they may still be subject to
copyright in other countries. In countries where copyright
protections can extend more than 70 years past an author's death,
the author's estate and publishers still retain their legal and
moral rights to oversee the work in those countries.</p>

<p>Once copyright has expired it cannot be revived by subsequent
publication, or otherwise. New editions cannot extend copyright,
however new work (such as an introduction) will be copyright.
Translators, editors, and illustrators have similar rights to those
of the author of the work.</p>

<p>Until 2005 the period of copyright in Australia was for the life of the
author plus 50 years from the end of the year of the author's death. In 2005 amendments to the
Australian Copyright Act were made, as a result
of a Free Trade Agreement with the United States. Those
amendments extended the period of protection (for most material
that was still protected by copyright at the time) to 70 years, as
outlined in an earlier paragraph. In general, material that was
previously protected for the life of the creator plus 50 years is
now protected for the creator's life plus 70 years, and
material that was previously protected for 50 years from first
publication is protected for 70 years from the end of the year of
first publication.</p>

<p>The extended period of protection only applied to material that
was still protected by copyright on 1 January 2005, or created on
or after that date. There has been no revival of copyright in
material which was in the public domain as at 1 January 2005. This
means that, with regard to books, all material in the public domain
as at midnight on 31 December 2004 remains in the public domain.
For example, Miles Franklin died in 1954. Her book My Brilliant
Career entered the public domain at midnight on 31 December 2004.
It remains in the public domain. Works published by authors who
died in or after 1955 will now remain in copyright until midnight
on 31 December 2025, at the earliest.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The above information applies to <b>published</b> works. Until
2019, <b>unpublished</b> works remained in copyright until
published, at which time the rules above applied. From 1 January
2019 the law changed to allow publication of thousands of
unpublished documents. This change in the law sees the
liberation of numerous documents, which have languished in the
stack areas of public libraries, so that they can be freely
accessed and published by anyone.</p>

<p>The following is quoted from <i>2019 Australia&#8217;s Year of the Public Domain</i> published by the Australian Libraries Copyright Committee.
It can be downloaded from <a href=
"https://libcopyright.org.au/year-of-the-public-domain-media-statement/">
Australian Libraries Copyright Committee</a> site.</p>

<p><i>Canberra, Australia &mdash; 2019 will be a golden year for culture and learning in Australia. As of 1 January millions of items from our national collections &#8211; from Captain Cook&#8217;s carrot marmalade recipe and Henry Lawson&#8217;s letters to war posters and theses &#8211; will fall out of copyright for the first time, finally becoming free for all to use.<br>
<br>
This wealth of new material is a result of changes to copyright law introduced by the Copyright Amendment (Disability Access and Other Measures) Act 2017. As those who Cooked for Copyright in 2015 will remember, an aberration of Australian law has meant that unpublished materials &#8211; from letters to diaries to shipping manifests &#8211; currently remain in copyright in perpetuity. This means they rapidly become locked, unuseable, behind laws that require you to seek permission from an often impossible to identify copyright owner before you publish, adapt or even copy them.<br>
<br>
The new laws starting on 1 January reverse that, giving unpublished materials the same copyright term as their published counterparts. This means most of Australia&#8217;s national collection will now have a copyright term of 70 years after the author&#8217;s death. The changes also create a new term of 70 years for materials with unknown authors, known as orphan works.</i>

<h3><a name="a1" id="a1"></a><font color="#800000"><b>Dictionary of
Australian Biography</b></font>
</h3>

<p><b><img alt="Percival Serle" src="/ebooks15/1500721h/serle1.jpg"
width="117" height="150" align="left"></b>First published in 1949,
this prodigious work by Percival Serle includes biographies of
approximately one thousand prominent Australians or persons closely
connected with Australia, all of whom died before 1950.
Politicians, explorers, artists and pioneers in many areas are
covered.</p>

<p>The Dictionary took more than twenty years to complete. Serle
notes in the Preface that "I have endeavoured to make the book
worthy of its subject. It would have been better could I have spent
another five years on it, but at seventy-five years of age one
realizes there is a time to make an end."</p>

<p>To access the dictionary and a detailed biography of Serle
himself, go to the <a href=
"/pgaus.html#serle">Serle</a> entry.</p>

<p>The digital version of this book includes hyperlinks to othere
people referred in the biographies who also have entries, and
images of many of the subjects.</p>

<p>The entries generally avoid controversy and do not always
mention the personal life of the subjects, particularly
unflattering incidents. And, being a creature of his time, Serle
rarely mentions the wives of the male subjects who are covered.
Still, he generally provides good information regarding the facts
of the lives of the subjects.</p>

<p>For the modern reader perhaps there are too many politicians in
whom we are not now interested, but the entries provide a good
background reference. Not enough women are represented, but again,
Serle was a creature of his time. Nellie Melba, Caroline Chisholm,
Mary Gaunt and Catherine Spence are among those covered.</p>

<p>Can one imagine Serle sitting out (or writing out) more than one
thousand biographies. After scanning and proofing this book myself,
I still can't comprehend the Herculean task which he undertook. As
he said, &quot;at seventy-five years of age one realizes there is a
time to make an end.&quot; What an understatement.</p>

<h3><font color="#800000"><b><a name="a2" id="a2"></a>John White,
surgeon on the First Fleet to sail to Australia, in
1787-88.</b></font>
</h3>

<p><img alt="Early drawing of kangaroo" src="/images/white.jpg"
width="167" height="219" align="left">The first authenticated
discovery of Australia was by William Jansz in 1606. Further
contact was made by seafarers including Hartog, Houtman, Carstensz,
Tasman, Dampier, and Cook but it was not until 1788, when the ships
of the First Fleet landed at Sydney Cove with their "cargo" of
convicts and began the first white settlement on the continent,
that the "European" phase of Australian history really began.</p>

<p>The convicts were put on board the ships of the First Fleet in
March 1787 and arrived at Sydney Cove on 26 January, 1788&mdash;the
day now commemorated as "Australia Day". There have been a number
of first hand accounts of the voyage by men who were on board the
ships, including the very readable <a href=
"/pgaus.html#tench">&quot;A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany
Bay" and "A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port
Jackson&quot;</a> by Watkin Tench, one of the marines (see review,
below).</p>

<p>Another account, <a href="/pgaus.html#white">&quot;Journal of a
Voyage to New South Wales&quot;</a>, by John Wright,
Surgeon-General to the Settlement, was first published in 1790.
This publication included 65 magnificent colour plates of "non
descript animals, birds, serpents, curious cones of trees and other
natural productions".</p>

<p>Of the colour plates, an "advertisement" at the beginning of the
publication has this to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It becomes the duty of the Editor, as much as it is his
inclination, to return his public and grateful acknowledgments to
the Gentlemen through whose abilities and liberal communications,
in the province of Natural History, he has been enabled to surmount
those difficulties that necessarily attended the description of so
great a variety of animals, presented for the first time to the
observation of the Naturalist, and consequently in the class of
Non-descripts.</p>

<p>"Among those Gentlemen he has the honour, particularly, to
reckon the names of Dr. Shaw; Dr. Smith, the possessor of the
celebrated Linnaean Collection; and John Hunter, Esq., who, to a
sublime and inventive genius, happily unites a disinterested and
generous zeal for the promotion of natural science. The Public may
rely, with the most perfect confidence, on the care and accuracy
with which the drawings have been copied from nature, by Miss
Stone, Mr. Catton, Mr. Nodder, and other artists; and the Editor
flatters himself the Engravings are all executed with equal
correctness, by, or under the immediate inspection of Mr. Milton.
The Birds, etc. from which the drawings were taken are deposited in
the Leverian Museum."</p>
Quite a recommendation!

<p>Here is White's account of the landing at Sydney Cove on
Australia Day, 1788:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We again descried the French ships standing in for the bay,
with a leading wind; upon which Captain Hunter sent his first
lieutenant on board the commanding officer's ship, which was
distinguished by a broad pendant, to assist them in coming in. Soon
after the lieutenants were returned to the <i>Sirius</i>, Captain
Clonnard, the French Commodore's captain (who during the late war
commanded the <i>Artois</i>, taken by the Bienfaisant, Captain
Macbride), waited on Captain Hunter, and informed him that the
ships were the <i>Astrolabe</i> and the <i>Boussale</i>, which
sailed from France in the year 1786, under the command of Messieurs
de la Perouse and De Langle. He further acquainted him that, having
touched at Navigator's Isles, they had had the misfortune to lose
Captain De Langle, the second in command, with ten other officers
and two boats crews, all of whom were cut off by the natives of
those islands, who appeared to be numerous and warlike. This
accident induced them to put into this port in order to build some
boats, which they had in frames. It also had afforded room for the
promotion of Monsieur Clonnard, who, on their leaving France, was
only the commodore's first lieutenant.</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock the <i>Sirius</i>, with all the ships, weighed,
and in the evening anchored in Port Jackson, with a few trifling
damages done to some of them, who had run foul of each other in
working out of Botany Bay. Port Jackson I believe to be, without
exception, the finest and most extensive harbour in the universe,
and at the same time the most secure, being safe from all the winds
that blow. It is divided into a great number of coves, to which his
excellency has given different names. That on which the town is to
be built, is called Sydney Cove. It is one of the smallest in the
harbour, but the most convenient, as ships of the greatest burden
can with ease go into it, and heave out close to the shore.
Trincomal&eacute;, acknowledged to be one of the best harbours in
the world, is by no means to be compared to it. In a word, Port
Jackson would afford sufficient and safe anchorage for all the
navies of Europe. The <i>Supply</i> had arrived the day before, and
the governor, with every person that could be spared from the ship,
were on shore, clearing the ground for the encampment. In the
evening, when all the ships had anchored, the English colours were
displayed; and at the foot of the flag-staff his Majesty's health,
and success to the settlement, was drank by the governor, many of
the principal officers, and private men who were present upon the
occasion."</p>

<p>The publication of his journal with so many colur plates
indicates that White took more than a passing interest in the flora
and fauna of the new colony. However, it seems that, after the
publication of his journal, he became pessimistic about the future
of the settlement and, having obtained leave of absence, sailed for
England on 17 December, 1794. William Balmain, his assistant, took
over White's duties, and was later appointed principal surgeon.
History has shown, of course, that White's judgment regarding the
future of the colony was incorrect; but his observation about
Sydney Harbour, that it was the "finest and most extensive harbour
in the universe", has stood the test of time.</p>

<p>The etext of White's journal is now available at the <a href=
"/pgaus.html#white">Australiana page</a>. The HTML version of the
eBook includes all 66 colour plates, including the original title
page.</p>

<p><img alt="Watkin Tench" src="/images/tench.jpg" width="70"

"/pgaus.html#tench">&quot;A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany
Bay" and "A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port
Jackson&quot;.</a></p>

<p>The first fleet of ships which arrived in Botany Bay (Sydney)
from England, in January 1788, heralded the beginning of white
settlement in Australia. Watkin Tench (1759-1833), Captain of the
Marines, was one of the four captains who made the voyage. In his
autobiographical "A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay"
Tench states that "our number was . . . twelve sail: His Majesty's
ships <i>Sirius</i>, <i>Hyena</i>, and <i>Supply</i>, three
Victuallers with two years stores and provisions on board for the
Settlement, and six Transports, with troops and convicts. In the
transports were embarked four captains, twelve subalterns,
twenty-four serjeants and corporals, eight drummers, and one
hundred and sixty private marines, making the whole of the military
force, including the Major Commandant and Staff on board the
<i>Sirius</i>, to consist of two hundred and twelve persons, of
whom two hundred and ten were volunteers. The number of convicts
was five hundred and sixty-five men, one hundred and ninety-two
women, and eighteen children; the major part of the prisoners were
mechanics and husbandmen, selected on purpose by order of
Government."</p>

<p>In "A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay" and his
subsequent work "A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port
Jackson", Tench provides a first hand account of the voyage and
then goes on to describe the subsequent settlement in Sydney, New
South Wales. He details the natural environment of Port Jackson and
its environs; the efforts to establish food production; the
exploratory trips into the hinterland; and, most interestingly, the
first interaction between Europeans and the Australian Aborigines.
This is a remarkable eye-witness account by a thoughtful, humane
man who was also a talented writer. Tench was interested in
everyone and everything around him. These two works may be
considered the first works of Australian literature.</p>

<h3><font color="#800000"><b><a name="a4" id="a4"></a>James Tucker,
convict novelist</b></font>
</h3>

<p><img alt="North Head Sydney Harbour" src=
"images/portjackson.jpg" width="200" height="233" align=
"left">James Tucker (1803-1866) and the story behing the
publication of <a href="/pgaus.html#tucker">"Ralph
Rashleigh"</a>.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Dutton, in <i>The Australian
Collection&mdash;Australia's Greatest Books</i>, remarks that "The
definition of "classic" should be relevant to both time and place.
There are many books in each country's literature that are
cherished as classics in their homeland but little known
elsewhere." Hence the inclusion of <i>Ralph Rashleigh</i>in
Dutton's list of Australia's Greatest Books. The book is a
"classic" for a number of reasons: its literary merit; its
depiction of the life of a convict; the circumstances of its
composition; and the occasion of the discovery of the manuscript
and subsequent publication.</p>

<p>The novel relates the story of a well-educated Londoner who
drifts into petty crimes, for one of which he is tried, imprisoned,
and sentenced to death. He escapes from prison, only to be
recaptured. However his sentence is commuted and he is transported
to New South Wales. (The image shows the entrance to Port Jackson
(Sydney Harbour) in 2005. It has not changed much in over 200
years.)</p>

<p>During his life in the colony he is flogged, placed in solitary
confinement and forced to endure both heat and cold without the
benefit of shoes. Still, this is not a story of hopelessness and
the convicts manage to get up a theatre and Rashleigh is later
assigned as a labourer to a settler. The adventures continue
unabated, to such an extent that Dutton remarks, "Interest in the
breathless series of adventures that make up <i>Ralph Rashleigh</i>
might flag if most of them were not so clearly authentic." As it
was, the author of this work was himself a convict.</p>

<p>Colin Roderick, academic and writer on Australian literature,
noted in a foreword to the 1952 edition of the book, that "<i>Ralph
Rashleigh</i> is the "only novel of abiding stature to have been
written by a man who during all his Australian life was never
anything but a convict." Like Rashleigh, Tucker himself was
sentenced to be transported to New South Wales for the term of his
natural life, for the crime of sending a letter threatening to
(falsely) accuse his cousin, James Stanyford Tucker, with
indecently assaulting him, James Rosenberg Tucker (our author).
Tucker spent much of his time in the colony as a messenger and
clerk. On several occasions he was granted a ticket of leave only
to have it revoked each time, save the last. He died in Liverpool
(N.S.W.) asylum in 1866.</p>

<p>In fact, we are not <i>absolutely</i> certain that James Tucker
is the author of <i>Ralph Rashleigh</i>, as the following story
will admit. In 1920, at an exhibition of rare books and manuscripts
held by the Royal Australian Historical Society, an elderly man
"turned up" with a manuscript titled <i>Ralph Rashleigh or The Life
of an Exile</i>, by Giacomo di Rosenberg and handed it to the
president of the Society, Mr C. H. Bertie. The elderly man, Robert
Baxter, could only say that some 50 years earlier it had been left
to his wife by her father, who had it of the author 30 years before
that. Three other manuscripts were also presented at the same time.
The date written by the author, on the verso of the first page of
<i>Ralph Rashleigh</i>, was 31st December, 1845. The paper on which
the manuscript was written was watermarked 1840. Other paper in the
bundle was ascertained to have come from the register of assignment
of convicts at Port Macquarie (N.S.W.), the latest dates on those
sheets being 1838.</p>

<p>These facts, together with other evidence, suggested that the
manuscripts were genuine work from the 1840s. On the assumption
that <i>Ralph Rashleigh</i> was a disguised book of memoirs, in
1929 a re-written version of the manuscript was published in
London. The reasons for the re-writing were outlined in the
publishers' note at the beginning of the publication: "We
recognized its value and interest, but the archaic literary style
of the writer made us doubt whether the book would be acceptable to
modern readers. So the manuscript was rewritten, but with absolute
fidelity to the original story."</p>

<p>The identity of the author of <i>Ralph Rashleigh</i> remained a
mystery. Then, in 1949, Mr Bertie "put me in possession", as Colin
Roderick put it in the foreword to the 1952 edition of <i>Ralph
Rashleigh</i>, "of all he knew about the manuscript. Intrigued by
its obvious authenticity and moved by the obscure fate of its
author, I was persuaded not to let the pursuit of that worthy (sic)
stop until I had established his identity." Unfortunately, for
copyright reasons, we cannot include in the ebook of <i>Ralph
Rashleigh</i> the complete foreword, by Colin Roderick, to the 1952
edition. However, Roderick goes on to detail how he was able to
ascertain that James Tucker was almost certainly the author. After
two years, building upon the knowledge that the paper upon which
the manuscript was written came from the penal settlement at Port
Macquarie, Roderick recounts: "On the evening of 26 July 1951 I was
looking through the 1846 inward correspondence of William Nairn
Gray to the Colonial Secretary. A file of letters dealt with
several complaints against Gray, one of which was that he had
misappropriated convict labour to build a race-course and to
enlarge his own garden for profit. To refute the charges he
enclosed a plan of the trifling alterations to his garden, and
another of the mighty public works he had performed. "These plans
really gave the solution to the problem. Not only were they in the
same calligraphy as the title pages of the Rashleigh manuscripts,
but they were signed with the amateur architect's name, James
Tucker. Several pages attached to them were in the same handwriting
as the manuscript of <i>Ralph Rashleigh</i>."</p>

<p>Roderick provides other evidence to corroborate his contention
that Tucker was the author of <i>Ralph Rashleigh</i>. For example
Tucker, in a postscript to his threatening letter to his cousin,
mentioned earlier, directed the cousin to "address to me Mr
Rosenberg, the Bell, Exeter Street, Strand." Further, Tucker's
criminal charge was directed to "James Rosenberg Tucker", and at
Port Jackson, Tucker's name was entered as "James Tucker, or
Rosenberg." Rosenberg was, as mentioned earlier, the name entered
on the <i>Ralph Rashleigh</i> manuscript.Some commentators,
however, have argued that Tucker merely copied the manuscript.</p>

<p>In an exchange in the <i>Bulletin</i> December 1952 to February
1953, M. H. Ellis argued that Tucker was a copyist whose known
writing, for example a letter written in 1826, does not reveal the
qualities required of the author of <i>Ralph Rashleigh</i>.
Roderick, though, seems to have the weight of evidence. In the
foreword to the 1952 edition of <i>Ralph Rashleigh</i>, Colin
Roderick goes on further to note the "unfortunate introduction [to
the 1929 edition] by the late Earl of Birkenhead. Like the editor
of that text, Birkenhead was misled into believing the book was a
memoir entirely and the text was mangled and falsified to fit this
preconceived theory." Birkenhead set forth a diatribe in favour of
maintaining the death penalty, using as evidence to support his
claim, the "memoir" of Rashleigh, a person who "had the advantage
of a decent upbringing, but, out of weakness of character, adopted
what seemed the easier life of crime at an early age." It was
fortunate for Birkenhead that, by 1952 when the verbatim edition of
what turned out to be a novel was published, he was "late" as it
may have saved him from acute embarrassment.</p>

authentic popular edition" created from the original manuscript,
first published in 1952, together with the heavily edited 1929
edition (including the publishers' note and introduction by
Birkenhead). The 1929 edition is now, of course, just a curiosity.
I trust that you will agree that this is a "classic" story about a
classic work of Australian literature&mdash;<i>Ralph Rashleigh, The
Life of an Exile</i> by James Tucker.</p>

<h3><font color="#800000"><b><a name="a5" id="a5"></a>Sleeping

<p>A television series was shown recently on Australian television
about Ernest Shackleton's <a href=
"/pgaus.html#shackleton">"Expedition to the South Pole"</a> in the
early years of the twentieth century. Shackleton wrote the account
soon after the expedition ended and the book, whilst popular at the
time, has remained in relative obscurity for over half a century.
It, no doubt, became popular reading again following the television
series when viewers, intrigued by the story, went back to the
original source.</p>

<p>As with Shackleton's book, much of the early literature of
Australia has remained in relative obscurity. It might <i>seem</i>
to be as "dry as old bones" and there are certainly few people
singing its praises in order to convince people otherwise. There
is, after all, no profit in promoting books which are out of
copyright, and there is such a mountain of modern work which
<i>is</i> promoted by publishers and reviewed in newspapers and
literary journals. What is more, with such a bewildering number of
books to choose from we, as consumers, are often more than willing
to be guided by a trusted reviewer towards the novels which we
read. Or we might choose the latest novel of a favourite author in
the firm knowledge that we won't be disappointed with it. Such an
author already has "runs on the board."</p>

<p>Fortunately, not everybody relies on the
&quot;recommendation&quot; method of choosing books. Recently a
newspaper carried a story of a reader who maintained that she
simply walked down the aisles of her local library once a week and
chose four books at random, from the shelves. She walked through a
different section each week&mdash;fiction, biography, history, it
mattered not to her. She reported that she could only read one book
each week, but chose four so that she could discard the "fizzers"
and move on to the next one. What courage! Oh, but what buried
treasure she must unearth.</p>

<p>Many years ago I purchased a "psycho-analytical" book titled
<i>Dibs, in Search of Self</i> by Virginia Axline. It was then, or
has become, a classic in the field of "play therapy". However, I
didn't know that at the time. I don't know what attracted me to it
and enticed me to pluck it from the shelf in the bookstore, but it
has remained one of my all-time favourite non-fiction books. Over
the years, I have given away three or four copies to friends but
have always managed to buy another. I won't be giving anything away
here, in stating that the book its about a small child who seems to
be intellectually retarded. Ms Axline interacts with him and it
soon emerges that he is a genius with an IQ of 168. That is not so
important. More important is the sympathy displayed by the
therapist and the incredible courage shown by the little boy in
overcoming all of the problems unwittingly heaped upon him by his
parents. It has always haunted me that I may never have known this
beautiful book if I hadn't stumbled upon it. (This book is still in
copyright, and is not held at Project Gutenberg Australia)</p>

<p>Only a small number of "modern" works survive the test of time
to become part of the <i>treasure-trove</i> of literature; and
those that do survive may not have been best-sellers in their time.
Geoffrey Dutton, in <i><a href=
"/austgreatest.html">Australia's Greatest
Books</a>,</i> set out to review approximately one hundred books,
only one per author, which form part of Australia's literary
heritage. Not all were written by great stylists, but they were all
instrumental in helping form Australia's literary heritage and all
are worthwhile in one way or another.</p>

<p>One of Dutton's selections is <i><a href=
"/pgaus.html#stone">"Jonah"</a>.</i> This is
a novel set in Sydney in the early 1900s. Many of the places
described&mdash;Chinatown and Paddy's markets, Botany Road, Sydney
Harbour and its foreshores&mdash;are icons of Sydney. The
characters&mdash;members of the 'Push', rags-to-riches businessmen
like Jonah, and battlers like Chook and Pinky&mdash;are just as
recognisable today. This novel has been described as the first
great novel about Sydney. It has been the subject of a television
series and has been adapted for the stage. Yet it is certainly not
well-known by the reading public in Australia.</p>

<p>Another Dutton selection is <a href="/pgaus.html#tench">"A
Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson&quot;</a> (see
article above). This was republished as <i>1788</i> to coincide
with Australia's bi-centenary. Watkin Tench, who served as a marine
on one of the vessels of the First Fleet to arrive in Australia in
1788, provides a first hand account of the voyage and then goes on
to describe the subsequent settlement in Sydney. He details the
natural environment of Port Jackson and its environs; the efforts
to establish food production; the exploratory trips into the
hinterland; and, most interestingly, the first interaction between
Europeans and the Australian Aborigines. This is a remarkable
eye-witness account by a thoughtful, humane man who was also a
talented writer. Tench was interested in everyone and everything
around him. This work may be considered the first work of
Australian literature.</p>

<p>There is a large body of early Australian writing which covers
the journals written by early <a href=
"/explorers.html">explorers</a> including
Sturt, Giles, Leichhardt and Carnegie. Dutton includes a number of
these in his list, including Sturt, who had this to say as he and
his crew were swept down the Murray River in a whaleboat: "I still
retained a strong impression on my mind that some change was at
hand, and on this occasion, I was not disappointed; but the view
was one for which I was not altogether prepared. We had, at length,
arrived at the termination of the Murray. Immediately below me was
a beautiful lake, which appeared to be a fitting reservoir for the
noble stream that had led us to it; and which was now ruffled by
the breeze that swept over it."</p>

<p>One of <i>my</i> favourite books about Australia by an early
writer is <i><a href=
"/pgaus.html#derougemont">"The Adventures of
Louis de Rougemont"</a>.</i> To quote a short passage: "Just
picture the scene for yourself. The weird, unexplored land
stretches away on every side, though one could not see much of it
on account of the grassy hillocks. I, a white man, was alone among
the blacks in the terrible land of "Never Never,"&mdash;as the
Australians call their <i>terra incognita</i>; and I was wrestling
with a gigantic cannibal chief for the possession of two
delicately-reared English girls, who were in his power."</p>

<p>It never happened. Louis de Rougemont was the assumed name of
Swiss-born Louis Grin. The <i>Oxford Companion to English
Literature</i> describes him as "an adventurer who decided at the
age of sixteen to see the world. He began as a footman to Fanny
Kemble, touring through Europe and America, and eventually became
butler to the governor of Australia. After spending many years
there he contributed to <i>Wilde World Magazine</i> in 1898
sensational articles relating to his extraordinary, mostly bogus,
voyages and adventures in search of pearls and gold, where he
encountered an octopus with tentacles 75 feet long and rode turtles
in the water." It seems that, after great public excitement in the
UK over the stories, he was eventually rumbled when, in a passage
of poetic beauty, he described the wonderful "flight of the
wombat." This is a very entertaining book of shipwreck, isolation
and adventures with the Australian aborigines, which I found, for
the most part, quite unputdownable. You just have to admire an
author who can achieve that!</p>

<p>My dictionary defines <i>treasure-trove</i> as "treasure found
hidden without evidence of ownership." There really is a
treasure-trove of early Australian literature in libraries
throughout Australia, and at Project Gutenberg Australia, for that
matter. Why not skip down the "virtual" aisles and grab a few
titles. Taste them and discard the ones that don't appeal. Who
knows what treasures you might unearth. Most of the books mentioned
in this article are available as eBooks from this site. Go to

<p><img alt="Map of Sturt's expeditions" src="images/sturt-map.jpg"
width="393" height="179" align="left"> The First Fleet of ships
from England arrived in Sydney in 1788. This represented the first
European settlement of the continent, although aborigines had
already been living in Australia for tens of thousand of years. For
the first twenty-five years the new inhabitants were confined to
the coastal strip around Sydney as no way could be found across the
Blue Mountains, part of the Great Dividing Range which runs
parallel to the east coast of Australia for almost the coast's
entire length. When, in 1813, a way across the Blue Mountains was
found, a wave of inland exploration was unleashed which continued
for the next fifty years. New areas were opened up for settlement
and several expeditions were commissioned by the government and by
private backers to ascertain whether an inland sea existed. This
remarkable period in Australian history was documented by many of
the explorers themselves, who kept journals of their expeditions.
These journals were usually published soon after the conclusion of
each expedition, and particularly appealed to people in England who
took quite an interest in the "opening up" of the "new" continent.
Moreover, many of those journals have been reprinted in facsimile
editions, which mean that they are accessible to the modern reader,
though they are by no means readily available at all public
libraries. A number of Project Gutenberg volunteers in Australia
have been transcribing these journals and most are now available at
Project Gutenberg, including a a number of HTML versions, with
illustrations and maps from the original publications. Others works
are in progress at the present time, as part of an ongoing project.

<p><b>A COUPLE OF THINKERS GO DEEP&mdash;from <i>The New York
Times</i></b>
</p>

<p>When Rabindranath Tagore and Albert Einstein met for the first
time, in Germany in 1930, both had won the Nobel Prize, Tagore for
literature in 1913, Einstein for physics in 1921. At the time of
that meeting, Dimitri Marianoff, a relative of Einstein, described
Tagore as "the poet with the head of a thinker" and Einstein as
"the thinker with the head of a poet." The conversation, he added,
was "as though two planets were engaged in a chat." They met in
July at Einstein's home on a hilltop outside Berlin. Einstein, 42,
came down to the road to meet his 70-year-old Bengali guest, who
later recalled about his host, "His shock of white hair, his
burning eyes, his warm manner again impressed me with the human
character of this man who dealt so abstractly with the laws of
geometry and mathematics." He wrote that he was deeply impressed by
Einstein's great simplicity: "There was nothing stiff about him -
there was no intellectual aloofness. He seemed to me a man who
valued human relationship and he showed toward me a real interest
and understanding."</p>

<p>Marianoff published an abbreviated report of the meeting in
<i>The New York Times Magazine</i> in 1930 under the headline
"Einstein and Tagore Plumb the Truth."</p>

<p>Now, a longer version of that conversation and a second
dialogue, based on notes taken by Marianoff and another guest, has
been printed in a special issue of <a href=
"http://www.kenyonreview.org/">The Kenyon Review</a> (Spring 2001
edition) which was jointly published with the British literary
periodical <i>Stand</i>. The journal, titled <i>Cultures of
Creativity</i>, was published to celebrate the 100th anniversary of
the Nobel Prizes. (See <a href=

</p>

<p>It's a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. It's a
present from the White King and Queen. There now!'</p>

<p>'Is it really?' said Alice, quite pleased to find that she HAD
chosen a good subject, after all.<br></p>

<p>'They gave it me,' Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he
crossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it,
'they gave it me&mdash;for an un-birthday present.'</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon?' Alice said with a puzzled air.</p>

<p>'I'm not offended,' said Humpty Dumpty.</p>

<p>'I mean, what IS an un-birthday present?'</p>

<p>'A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.'</p>

<p>Alice considered a little. 'I like birthday presents best,' she
said at last.</p>

<p>'You don't know what you're talking about!' cried Humpty Dumpty.
'How many days are there in a year?'</p>

<p>'Three hundred and sixty-five,' said Alice.</p>

<p>'And how many birthdays have you?'</p>

<p>'One.'</p>

<p>'And if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what
remains?'</p>

<p>'Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.'</p>

<p>Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful. 'I'd rather see that done on
paper,' he said.</p>

<p>Alice couldn't help smiling as she took out her memorandumbook,
and worked the sum for him:</p>

<p>365<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br>

364<br>

<p>Humpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully. 'That
seems to be done right&mdash;' he began.</p>

<p>'You're holding it upside down!' Alice interrupted.</p>

<p>'To be sure I was!' Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned it
round for him. 'I thought it looked a little queer. As I was
saying, that SEEMS to be done right&mdash;though I haven't time to
look it over thoroughly just now&mdash;and that shows that there
are three hundred and sixty-four days when you might get

<h3><font color="#800000"><b><a name="a17" id="a17"></a>The History
of Sumatra</b></font>
</h3>

<p><i>The History of Sumatra</i>, by William Marsden, was recently
placed on line at Project Gutenberg by Sue Asscher, a volunteer who
has produced many ebooks for Project Gutenberg and Project
Gutenberg Australia. This book has the long title of <i>The History
of Sumatra, Containing an Account of the Government, Laws, Customs,
and Manners of the Native Inhabitants, with a Description of the
Natural Productions, and a Relation of the Ancient Political State
of that Island.</i> The Third Edition was published in 1811.</p>

<p><i>Wikipedia</i>, the online encyclopedia, in its article on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra" target=
"_blank">Sumatra</a> states that "Sumatra (also spelled Sumatara
and Sumatera) is the sixth largest island of the world
(approximately 470,000 sq. km) and is the largest part of
Indonesia." The article goes on to state that "most of Sumatra used
to be covered by tropical rainforest, home to species such as
orangutans, tapirs, and Sumatran tigers, and some unique plants
like the Rafflesia. Unfortunately, economic development coupled
with corruption and illegal logging has severely threatened its
existence. Conservation areas have not been spared from
destruction, either."</p>

<p>Chapter 6 of <i>The History of Sumatra</i> covers "beasts,
reptiles, fish, birds, and insects." Sue Asscher would not have
been aware of the above statement in Wikipedia, but she knows that
things aren't what they used to be in Sumatra or, for that matter,
the world. When submitting the completed book for online posting
she commented "I loved the animals and plants. I wonder how many
still survive. Are you mindful of all this being the chronicle of
the end of the world? So sad."</p>

<p>The publication of a book published in 1811 begs the question
"is it still relevant?" Well, old books often give us an insight
into the views held at the time; they provide a record of events
which occurred long ago; and in many cases they are a record of a
natural world which has vanished or is now under severe threat. If
<i>The History of Sumatra</i> is not actually a "chronicle of the
end of the world" it is certainly a chronicle of the many species
of beasts, reptiles, fish, birds, and insects which now no longer
inhabit our planet.</p>

<h3><font color="#800000"><b><a name="a18" id="a18"></a>The Sources
of History</b></font>
</h3>

<p>In the Introduction to <a href=
"/pgaus.html#swinburne" target="_blank">A
Source Book of Australian History</a> Gwendolen H. Swinburne notes
that:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;The number of events described in a Source Book must
necessarily be smaller than that in histories of another type; but
the aim is to place the student in contact with the evidence of
history in order that he may become his own historian by drawing
his own deductions from the contemporary records. The greatest
historian can find no materials ulterior to such as are here
presented, for there is nothing ulterior to them but the deeds
themselves. They are the records written by the men who gave their
life and health to lay the foundation of Australia's
greatness&mdash;by Phillip, weakening under the racking cares of
the infant state; by Sturt in the scorching desert, as the last
duty of an exhausting day. They are aglow with the heat of action;
they are inspiring in their quiet modesty and strength.&quot;</p>

<p>Many of the sources quoted by Swinburne are available, in full,
from Project Gutenberg and Project Gutenberg Australia via <a href=
"/pgaus.html" target="_blank">The Project
Gutenberg Library of Australiana</a>. The Library includes works by
Dampier, Cook, Flinders, Sturt, Stuart and Forest and a number of
other land and sea explorers. Also included are works by Arthur
Phillip, first Governor of New South Wales, and Watkin Tench, David
Collins and John White, who arrived with the first fleet. These,
together with other first hand accounts of the early days in New
South Wales and Victoria, are the sources of Australian history. As
Swinburne asserts, &quot;there is nothing ulterior to them but the
deeds themselves.&quot;</p>

<h3><font color="#800000"><b><a name="a19" id="a19"></a>Finding
Flinders</b></font>
</h3>

<p>One of the best things about putting ebooks online at Project
Gutenberg Australia is the process of identifying and finding the
source material in the first place. There is a lot of work involved
in producing an ebook, so I like to choose books which, to me, seem
really worthwhile having online. Of course, the first consideration
must be that the book is out of copyright in Australia.</p>

<p>A book may be &quot;worthwhile&quot; for many reasons. If a book
is an Australian &quot;classic&quot; it is a prime candidate.
Geoffrey Dutton, in <i>The Australian Collection&mdash;Australia's
Greatest Books</i>, remarks that &quot;The definition of
&quot;classic&quot; should be relevant to both time and place.
There are many books in each country's literature that are
cherished as classics in their homeland but little known
elsewhere.&quot; Some Australian classics, such as <i>My Brilliant
Career</i>, can be found in any public library. <i>Landtakers</i>
and <i>Inheritors</i>, both by Brian Penton, and both Australian
classics, are harder to find.</p>

<p>The journals of the Australian land and sea explorers are also
worthwhile, as they can then be used as a very convenient source of
reference. Fortunately for us, during 1960s the Libraries Board of
South Australia published facsimile editions of many of the
published journals of the early explorers and these are available
in many public libraries, though sometimes they cannot be borrowed
and can only be used as reference books within the library.</p>

<p>Once one identifies a worthwhile book, a copy must be found
which can be used to prepare the ebook. I use the internet to
browse the catalogues of public libraries in the city in which I
live to try to locate a copy of the book. If I find a copy, it is
usually in the &quot;stack&quot; area of the library. There are
many great books gathering dust in the stack areas of local
libraries throughout Australia and over the years I have had
occasion to become familiar with many of them as I have sought to
find a copy of a book which I have wanted to place online as an
ebook at Project Gutenberg Australia.</p>

<p>I have had some surprising finds in searching the online
catalogues of public libraries. Sometimes I don't expect to find
the book, but feel compelled to look &quot;just in case.&quot;
Catherine Helen Spence wrote <i>A Week in the Future</i>, which was
serialised in <i>The Centennial Magazine</i> from December 1888 to
July 1889. It is an important book as it provides an example of
early Australian &quot;speculative fiction&quot;, but I had never
seen a copy. In it Spence imagines a week 100 years in the future.
I could hardly believe it when I found a &quot;facsimile&quot; copy
of the story, in book form, in a suburban library.</p>

<p>An even more remarkable find was <i>The Part Borne by the Dutch
in the Discovery of Australia</i>, by J E Heeres, published in
1899. This is a rare and valuable book, the more so as we
celebrated in 2006 the four-hundredth anniversary of the first
authenticated landing on Australian soil by an
&quot;outsider&quot;, the Dutchman Willem Janszoon. I felt
compelled to advise the library of the value of the book and
suggested that they restrict it to in-library use, but not until I
had borrowed it and produced the ebook.</p>

<p>Another book by J E Heeres, equally important to Australia, is
<i>Abel Janszoon Tasman's Journal of his Discovery of Van Diemen's
Land and New Zealand in 1642, with Documents Relating to his
Exploration of Australia in 1644...to which are added his Life and
Labours</i>. I never expected to find an accessible copy of this
book and was delighted when a collector, who had a facsimile
edition of the book (also rare) offered to photocopy the pages and
forward them to me.</p>

<p>Matthew Flinders' <i>Voyage to Terra Australis</i> is an
important book in Australian history as it relates the story of the
circumnavigation of Australia by Flinders and his subsequent
imprisonment on the island of Mauritius by the French governor.
There were copies in a number of local libraries, however all were
marked &quot;for reference only&quot; and could not be borrowed. It
is futile in such cases to appeal to the librarian for special
dispensation to borrow such books so that they can be scanned into
a computer. Fortunately, I was finally able to gain access to the
two volumes.</p>

<p>For entirely different reasons I wanted to make an ebook of
<i>An American Angler in Australia</i> by Zane Grey. Grey's fishing
books have a cult following. In the book Grey chases Marlin off
Batemans Bay, on the New south Wales South Coast. However, there is
more to this book which includes interesting descriptions of
Australian flora and fauna by a person well-known for his interest
in nature. The only copy I could find was in a major library, where
viewing could only be done in a restricted area of the library.
Fortunately it is a short book, so i was able to photocopy all the
pages for later use.</p>

<p>People often ask why I make ebooks. There are many reasons, but
an important reason is that I can make available worthwhile books
which might otherwise not be accessible because it it not viable,
for one reason or another, to publish them again. The books may
otherwise never see the light of day as they are hidden away in
stack areas, or held reference sections or in restricted areas in
public libraries. Another reason, of course, is that I have such
fun tracking them down.</p>

<p><b>Bestsellers</b>
</p>

<p>Our <a href=
"/bestsellers.html">Bestsellers</a> page
contains the titles of the top ten bestselling books in both
fiction and non-fiction categories for the years 1923 through 1953
(from Publisher's Weekly) with links to those that are available at
Project Gutenberg Australia. All works by authors who died after 31
December, 1954 are still under copyright in Australia.</p>

<p>In the fiction category, there are some some surprising authors
on the list. Zane Grey, Booth Tarkington and Lloyd C Douglas are
now out of favour, even though their books are still very readable.
On the other hand, the works of Virginia Woolf and D H Lawrence are
still widely read.</p>

<p>The non-fiction category has some fascinating titles which would
readily find a publisher even today, including 'Self-Mastery
Through Conscious Auto-Suggestion', 'Diet and Health', and 'You
Must Relax.' No doubt the actual content would, in many cases, be
quite different.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find many of the non-fiction titles in
libraries today, much more difficult than finding many of the
fiction titles. One supposes that the transitory nature of many of
the non-fiction works has meant that the books date more
easily.</p>

<p>Why not click on the Bestsellers link and browse the list. At
the very least it provides an interesting insight into the reading
taste of people more than 50 years ago.</p>

<p><b>Arthur Conan Doyle</b>
</p>

<p>We all know Doyle as the creator of Sherlock Holmes, but some of
his other work, such as this collection of stories, is less well
known. A bibliography of his work is available from our <a href=
"/pages/doyle.html">Doyle</a> page. Most of
his titles can be directly accessed from that page.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous quotation attributed to Doyle's
character, Sherlock Holmes, is &quot;Elementary, my Dear
Watson.&quot; The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, Fourth Edition,
1992, p. 256, states that the quotation &quot;is not found in any
book by Conan Doyle, although a review of the film The Return of
Sherlock Holmes in New York Times 19 October 1929. p. 22, states:
'In the final scene Dr Watson is there with his &quot;Amazing,
Holmes,&quot; and Holmes comes forth with his &quot;Elementary, my
dear Watson, elementary.&quot;'</p>

<p>Here are a few other quotations which ARE in Doyle's books:</p>

<p>'Excellent,' I cried. 'Elementary,' said he.<br>
(The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1894), 'The Crooked Man.')</p>

<p>You see, but you do not observe.<br>
(The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892) 'The Red-Headed
League.')</p>

<p>How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
truth?<br>
(The Sign of Four (1890) ch. 6)</p>

<p>It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the
evidence. It biases the judgment.<br>
(A Study in Scarlet (1888) ch. 3)</p>

<p>Where there is no imagination, there is no horror.<br>
(A Study in Scarlet (1888) ch. 5)</p>

<p>Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself, but talent
instantly recognises genius.<br>
(The Valley of Fear (1915) ch.1)</p>
