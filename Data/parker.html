<p><strong>Australian Legendary Tales&mdash;Folk-lore of the
Noongahburrahs as told to the piccaninnies</strong><br>
<strong>The Euahlayi Tribe&mdash;A Study of Aboriginal Life in
Australia</strong>
</p>

<p>These books were published circa 1900 and this historical
context must be kept in mind when reading them. There are some
misconceptions, racist comments and inaccurate descriptions of
aboriginal spiritual practices. Nevertheless, they provide valuable
information about aboriginal folklore and cultural and spiritual
beliefs.</p>

<p>Parker lived in the Australian outback in the late nineteenth
century. As she said in the introduction to 'The Euahlayi Tribe',
&quot;The following pages are intended as a contribution to the
study of the manners, customs, beliefs, and legends of the
Aborigines of Australia. The area of my observation is mainly
limited to the region occupied by the Euahlayi tribe of
north-western New South Wales, who for twenty years were my
neighbours on the Narran River. I have been acquainted since
childhood with the natives, first in southern South Australia; next
on my father's station on the Darling River, where I was saved by a
native girl, when my sisters were drowned while bathing. I was
intimate with the dispositions of the blacks, and was on friendly
terms with them, before I began a regular attempt to inquire into
their folk-lore and customary laws, at my husband's station on the
Narran, due north of the Barwon River, the great affluent of the
Murray River.&quot;</p>
