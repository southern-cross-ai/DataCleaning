<h1>Dodge</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h1>William MacLeod Raine</h1>

<h4>A Story of the Old Hell-raising Trail's End<br>
Where the Colt Was King</h4>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<p>IT WAS in the days when the new railroad was pushing through the
country of the plains Indians that a drunken cowboy got on the train at a
way station in Kansas. John Bender, the conductor, asked him for his
ticket. He had none, but he pulled out a handful of gold pieces.</p>

<p>"I wantta&mdash;g-go to&mdash;h-hell," he hiccoughed.</p>

<p>Bender did not hesitate an instant. "Get off at Dodge. One dollar,
please."</p>

<p>Dodge City did not get its name because so many of its citizens were
or had been, in the Texas phrase, on the dodge. It came quite respectably
by its cognomen. The town was laid out by A. A. Robinson, chief engineer
of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe, and it was called for Colonel
Richard I. Dodge, commander of the post at Fort Dodge and one of the
founders of the place. It is worth noting this, because it is one of the
few respectable facts in the early history of the cowboy capital. Dodge
was a wild and uncurried prairie wolf, and it howled every night and all
night long. It was gay and young and lawless. Its sense of humour was
exaggerated and worked overtime. The crack of the six-shooter punctuated
its hilarity ominously. Those who dwelt there were the valiant vanguard
of civilization. For good or bad they were strong and forceful, many of
them generous and big-hearted in spite of their lurid lives. The town was
a hive of energy. One might justly use many adjectives about it, but the
word respectable is not among them.</p>

<p>There were three reasons why Dodge won the reputation of being the
wildest town the country had ever seen. In 1872 it was the end of the
track, the last Jumping-off spot into the wilderness, and in the days
when transcontinental railroads were building across the desert the
temporary terminus was always a gathering place of roughs and scalawags.
The payroll was large, and gamblers, gunmen, and thugs gathered for the
pickings. This was true of Hays, Abilene, Ogalala, and Kit Carson. It was
true of Las Vegas and Albuquerque.</p>

<p>A second reason was that Dodge was the end of the long trail drive
from Texas. Every year hundreds of thousands of longhorns were driven up
from Texas by cowboys scarcely less wild than the hill steers they
herded. The great plains country was being opened, and cattle were needed
to stock a thousand ranches as well as to supply the government at Indian
reservations. Scores of these trail herds were brought to Dodge for
shipment, and after the long, dangerous, drive the punchers were keen to
spend their money on such diversions as the town could offer. Out of
sheer high spirits they liked to shoot up the town, to buck the tiger, to
swagger from saloon to gambling hall, their persons garnished with
revolvers, the spurs on their high-heeled boots jingling. In no spirit of
malice they wanted it distinctly understood that they owned the town. As
one of them once put it, he was born high up on the Guadaloupe, raised on
prickly pear, had palled with alligators and quarrelled with
grizzlies.</p>

<p>Also, Dodge was the heart of the buffalo country. Here the hunters
were outfitted for the chase. From here great quantities of hides were
shipped back on the new railroad R. M. Wright, one of the founders of the
town and always one of its leading citizens, says that his firm alone
shipped two hundred thousand hides in one season. He estimates the number
of buffaloes in the country at more than twenty-five million, admitting
that many as well informed as he put the figure at four times as many.
Many times he and others travelled through the vast herds for days at a
time without ever losing sight of them. The killing of buffaloes was
easy, because the animals were so stupid. When one was shot they would
mill round and round. Tom Nickson killed 120 in forty minutes; in a
little more than a month he slaughtered 2,173 of them. With good luck a
man could earn a hundred dollars a day. If he had bad luck he lost his
scalp.</p>

<p>The buffalo was to the plains Indian food, fuel, and shelter. As long
as there were plenty of buffaloes he was in Paradise. But he saw at once
that this slaughter would soon exterminate the supply. He hated the
hunter and battled against his encroachments. The buffalo hunter was an
intrepid plainsman. He fought Kiowas, Comanches, and the Staked Plain
Apaches, as well as the Sioux and the Arapahoe. Famous among these
hunters were Kirk Jordan Charles Rath, Emanuel Dubbs, Jack Bridges, and
Curly Walker. Others even better known were the two Buffalo Bills
(William Cody and William Mathewson) and Wild Bill.</p>

<p>These three factors then made Dodge: it was the end of the railroad,
the terminus of the cattle trail from Texas the centre of the buffalo
trade. Together they made it "the beautiful bibulous Babylon of the
frontier," in the words of the editor of the Kingsley Graphic. There was
to come a time later when the bibulous Babylon fell on evil days and its
main source of income was old bones. They were buffalo-bones, gathered in
wagons, and piled beside the track for shipment, hundreds and hundreds of
carloads of them, to be used for fertilizer. (I have seen great
quantities of such bones as far north as the Canadian Pacific line,
corded for shipment to a factory.) It used to be said by way of derision
that buffalo bones were legal tender in Dodge.</p>

<p>But that was in the far future. In its early years Dodge rode the wave
of prosperity. Hays and Abilene and Ogalala had their day, but Dodge had
its day and its night, too. For years it did a tremendous business. The
streets were so blocked that one could hardly get through. Hundreds of
wagons were parked in them, outfits belonging to freighters, hunters,
cattlemen, and the government. Scores of camps surrounded the town in
every direction. The yell of the cowboy and the weird oath of the
bullwhacker and the mule skinner were heard in the land. And for a time
there was no law nearer than Hays City, itself a burg not given to undue
quiet and peace.</p>

<p>Dodge was no sleepy village that could drowse along without peace
officers. Bob Wright has set it down that in the first year of its
history twenty-five men were killed and twice as many wounded. The
elements that made up the town were too diverse for perfect harmony. The
freighters did not like the railroad graders. The soldiers at the fort
fancied themselves as scrappers. The cowboys and the buffalo hunters did
not fraternize a little bit. The result was that Boot Hill began to fill
up. Its inhabitants were buried with their boots on and without
coffins.</p>

<p>There was another cemetery, for those who died in their beds. The
climate was so healthy that it would have been very sparsely occupied
those first years if it had not been for the skunks. During the early
months Dodge was a city of camps. Every night the fires flamed up from
the vicinity of hundreds of wagons. Skunks were numerous. They crawled at
night into the warm blankets of the sleepers and bit the rightful owners
when they protested. A dozen men died from these bites. It was thought at
first that the animals were a special variety, known as the hydrophobia
skunk. In later years I have sat around Arizona camp fires and heard this
subject discussed heatedly. The Smithsonian Institute, appealed to as
referee, decided that there was no such species and that deaths from the
bites of skunks were probably due to blood poisoning caused by the foul
teeth of the animal.</p>

<p>In any case, the skunks were only one half as venomous as the gunmen,
judging by comparative statistics. Dodge decided it had to have law in
the community. Jack Bridges was appointed first marshal.</p>

<p>Jack was a noted scout and buffalo hunter, the sort of man who would
have peace if he had to fight for it. He did his sleeping in the
afternoon, since this was the quiet time of the day. Someone shook him
out of slumber one day to tell him that cowboys were riding up and down
Front Street shooting the windows out of buildings. Jack sallied out, old
buffalo gun in hand. The cowboys went whooping down the street across the
bridge toward their camp. The old hunter took a long shot at one of them
and dropped him. The cowboys buried the young fellow next day.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of excitement in the cow camps. If the boys
could not have a little fun without some old donker, an old vinegaroon
who couldn't take a joke, filling them full of lead it was a pretty
howdy-do. But Dodge stood pat. The coroner's jury voted it justifiable
homicide. In future the young Texans were more discreet. In the early
days whatever law there was did not interfere with casualties due to
personal differences of opinion provided the affair had no unusually
sinister aspect.</p>

<p>The first wholesale killing was at Tom Sherman's dance hall. The
affair was between soldiers and gamblers. It was started by a trooper
named Hennessey, who had a reputation as a bad man and a bully. He was
killed, as were several others. The officers at the fort glossed over the
matter, perhaps because they felt the soldiers had been to blame.</p>

<p>One of the lawless characters who drifted into Dodge the first year
was Billy Brooks. He quickly established a reputation as a killer. My old
friend Emanuel Dubbs, a buffalo hunter who "took the hides off'n" many a
bison, is authority for the statement that Brooks killed or wounded
fifteen men in less than a month after his arrival. Now Emanuel is a
preacher (if he is still in the land of the living; I saw him last at
Clarendon, Texas, ten years or so ago), but I cannot quite swallow that
"fifteen." Still, he had a man for breakfast now and then and on one
occasion four.</p>

<p>Brooks, by the way, was assistant marshal. It was the policy of the
officials of these wild frontier towns to elect as marshal some
conspicuous killer, on the theory that desperadoes would respect his
prowess or if they did not would get the worst of the encounter.</p>

<p>Abilene, for instance, chose "Wild Bill" Hickok. Austin had its Ben
Thompson. According to Bat Masterson, Thompson was the most dangerous man
with a gun among all the bad men he knew&mdash;and Bat knew them all. Ben
was an Englishman who struck Texas while still young. He fought as a
Confederate under Kirby Smith during the Civil War and under Shelby for
Maximilian. Later he was city marshal at Austin. Thompson was a man of
the most cool effrontery. On one occasion, during a cattlemen's
convention, a banquet was held at the leading hotel. The local
congressman, a friend of Thompson, was not invited. Ben took exception to
this and attended in person. By way of pleasantry he shot the plates in
front of the diners. Later one of those present made humorous comment. "I
always thought Ben was a game man. But what did he do? Did he hold up the
whole convention of a thousand cattlemen? No, sir. He waited till he got
forty or fifty of us poor fellows alone before he turned loose his
wolf."</p>

<p>Of all the bad men and desperadoes produced by Texas, not one of them,
not even John Wesley Hardin himself, was more feared than Ben Thompson.
Sheriffs avoided serving warrants of arrest on him. It is recorded that
once, when the county court was in session with a charge against him on
the docket, Thompson rode into the room on a mustang. He bowed pleasantly
to the judge and court officials.</p>

<p>"Here I am, gents, and I'll lay all I'm worth that there's no charge
against me. Am I right? Speak up, gents. I'm a little deaf."</p>

<p>There was a dead silence until at last the clerk of the court
murmured, "No charge."</p>

<p>A story is told that on one occasion Ben Thompson met his match in the
person of a young English remittance man playing cards with him. The
remittance man thought he caught Thompson cheating and indiscreetly said
so. Instantly Thompson's .44 covered him. For some unknown reason the
gambler gave the lad a chance to retract.</p>

<p>"Take it back&mdash;and quick," he said grimly.</p>

<p>Every game in the house was suspended while all eyes turned on the
dare-devil boy and the hard-faced desperado. The remittance man went
white, half rose from his seat, and shoved his head across the table
toward the revolver.</p>

<p>"Shoot and be damned. I say you cheat," he cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>Thompson hesitated, laughed, shoved the revolver back into its
holster, and ordered the youngster out of the house.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most amazing escape on record is that when Thompson, fired
at by Mark Wilson at a distance of ten feet from a double-barrelled
shotgun loaded with buckshot, whirled instantly, killed him, and an
instant later shot through the forehead Wilson's friend Mathews, though
the latter had ducked behind the bar to get away. The second shot was
guesswork plus quick thinking and accurate aim. Ben was killed a little
later, in company with his friend King Fisher, another bad man, at the
Palace Theatre. A score of shots were poured into them by a dozen men
waiting in ambush. Both men had become so dangerous that their enemies
could not afford to let them live.</p>

<p>King Fisher was the humorous gentleman who put up a signboard at the
fork of a public road bearing the legend:</p>

<pre class="poem">
THIS IS KING FISHER'S ROAD.
TAKE THE OTHER
</pre>

<p>It is said that those travelling that way followed his advice. The
other road might be a mile or two farther, but they were in no hurry.
Another amusing little episode in King Fisher's career is told. He had
had some slight difficulty with a certain bald-headed man. Fisher shot
him and carelessly gave the reason that he wanted to see whether a bullet
would glance from a shiny pate.</p>

<p>El Paso in its wild days chose Dallas Stoudenmire for marshal, and
after he had been killed, John Selman. Both of them were noted killers.
During Selman's r&eacute;gime John Wesley Hardin came to town. Hardin had
twenty-seven notches on his gun and was the worst man killer Texas had
ever produced. He was at the bar of a saloon shaking dice when Selman
shot him from behind. One year later Deputy United States Marshal George
Scarborough killed Selman in a duel. Shortly after this Scarborough was
slain in a gun fight by "Kid" Curry, an Arizona bandit.</p>

<p>What was true of these towns was true, too, of Albuquerque and Las
Vegas and Tombstone. Each of them chose for peace officers men who were
"sudden death" with a gun. Dodge did exactly the same thing. Even a
partial list of its successive marshals reads like a fighting roster. In
addition to Bridges and Brooks may be named Ed and Bat Masterson, Wyatt
Earp, Billy Tilghman, Ben Daniels, Mysterious Dave Mathers, T. C. Nixon,
Luke Short, Charley Bassett, W. H. Harris, and the Sughrue brothers, all
of them famous as fighters in a day when courage and proficiency with
weapons were a matter of course. On one occasion the superintendent of
the Sante Fe suggested to the city dads of Dodge that it might be a good
thing to employ marshals less notorious. Dodge begged leave to differ. It
felt that the best way to "settle the hash" of desperadoes was to pit
against them fighting machines more efficient, bad men more deadly than
themselves.</p>

<p>The word "bad" does not necessarily imply evil. One who held the
epithet was known as one dangerous to oppose. He was unafraid, deadly
with a gun, and hard as nails. He might be evil, callous, treacherous,
revengeful as an Apache. Dave Mathers fitted this description. He might
be a good man, kindly, gentle, never taking more than his fighting
chance. This was Billy Tilghman to a T.</p>

<p>We are keeping Billy Brooks waiting. But let that go. Let us look
first at "Mysterious Dave." Bob Wright has set it down that Mathers had
more dead men to his credit than any other man in the West. He slew seven
by actual count in one night, in one house, according to Wright. Mathers
had a very bad reputation. But his courage could blaze up magnificently.
While he was deputy marshal word came that the Henry gang of desperadoes
were terrorizing a dance hall. Into that hall walked Dave, beside his
chief Tom Carson. Five minutes later out reeled Carson, both arms broken,
his body shot through and through, a man with only minutes to live. When
the smoke in the hall cleared away Mathers might have been seen beside
two handcuffed prisoners, one of them wounded. In a circle round him were
four dead cowpunchers of the Henry outfit.</p>

<p>"Uncle" Billy Tilghman died the other day at Cromwell, Oklahoma, a
victim of his own fearlessness. He was shot to death while taking a
revolver from a drunken prohibition agent. If he had been like many other
bad men he would have shot the fellow down at the first sign of danger.
But that was never Tilghman's way. It was his habit to make arrests
without drawing a gun. He cleaned up Dodge during the three years while
he was marshal. He broke up the Doolin gang, killing Bill Raidler and
"Little" Dick in personal duels and capturing Bill Doolin the leader. Bat
Masterson said that during Tilghman's terms as sheriff of Lincoln County,
Oklahoma, he killed, captured, or drove from the country more criminals
than any other official that section ever had. Yet "Uncle" Billy never
used a gun except reluctantly. Time and again he gave the criminal first
shot, hoping the man would surrender rather than fight. Of all the old
frontier sheriffs none holds a higher place than Billy Tilghman.</p>

<p>After which diversion we return to Billy Brooks, a "gent" of an
impatient temperament, not used to waiting, and notably quick on the
trigger. Mr. Dubbs records that late one evening in the winter of '72-'73
he returned to Dodge with two loads of buffalo meat. He finished his
business, ate supper, and started to smoke a postprandial pipe. The sound
of a fusillade in an adjoining dance hall interested him since he had
been deprived of the pleasures of metropolitan life for some time and had
had to depend upon Indians for excitement. (Incidentally, it may be
mentioned that they furnished him a reasonable amount. Not long after
this three of his men were caught, spread-eagled, and tortured by
Indians. Dubbs escaped after a hair-raising ride and arrived at Adobe
Walls in time to take part in the historic defence of that post by a
handful of buffalo hunters against many hundred tribesmen.) From the
building burst four men. They started across the railroad track to
another dance hall, one frequented by Brooks. Dubbs heard the men mention
the name of Brooks, coupling it with an oath. Another buffalo hunter
named Fred Singer joined Dubbs. They followed the strangers, and just
before the four reached the dance hall Singer shouted a warning to the
marshal. This annoyed the unknown four, and they promptly exchanged shots
with the buffalo hunters. What then took place was startling in the
sudden drama of it.</p>

<p>Billy Brooks stood in bold relief in the doorway, a revolver in each
hand. He fired so fast that Dubbs says the sound was like a company
discharging weapons. When the smoke cleared Brooks still stood in the
same place. Two of the strangers were dead and two mortally wounded. They
were brothers. They had come from Hays City to avenge the death of a
fifth brother shot down by Brooks some time before.</p>

<p>Mr. Brooks had a fondness for the fair sex. He and Browney, the yard
master, took a fancy to the same girl. Captain Drew, she was called, and
she preferred Browney. Whereupon Brooks naturally shot him in the head.
Perversely, to the surprise of everybody, Browney recovered and was soon
back at his old job.</p>

<p>Brooks seems to have held no grudge at him for making light of his
markmanship in this manner. At any rate, his next affair was with Kirk
Jordan, the buffalo hunter.</p>

<p>This was a very different business. Jordan had been in a hundred tight
holes. He had fought Indians time and again. Professional killers had no
terror for him. He threw down his big buffalo gun on Brooks, and the
latter took cover. Barrels of water had been placed along the principal
streets for fire protection. These had saved several lives during
shooting scrapes. Brooks ducked behind one, and the ball from Jordan's
gun plunged into it. The marshal dodged into a store, out of the rear
door, and into a livery stable. He was hidden under a bed. Alas! for a
large reputation gone glimmering. Mr. Brooks fled to the fort, took the
train from the siding, and shook forever the dust of Dodge from his feet.
Whither he departed deponent sayeth not.</p>

<p>How do I explain this? I don't. I record a fact. Many gunmen were at
one time or another subject to these panics during which the yellow
streak showed. Not all of them by any means, but a very considerable
percentage. They swaggered boldly, killed recklessly. Then one day some
quiet little man with a cold gray eye called the turn on them, after
which they oozed out of the surrounding scenery.</p>

<p>Owen P. White gives it on the authority of Charlie Siringo that Bat
Masterson sang small when Clay Allison of the Panhandle, he of the
well-notched gun, drifted into Dodge and inquired for the city marshal.
But the old-timers at Dodge do not bear this out. Bat was at the Adobe
Walls fight, one of fourteen men who stood off five hundred bucks of the
Cheyenne, Comanche, and Kiowa tribes. He scouted for Miles. He was
elected sheriff of Ford County, with headquarters at Dodge when only
twenty-two years of age It was a tough assignment, and Bat executed it to
the satisfaction of all concerned except the element he cowed.</p>

<p>Personally, I never met Bat until his killing days were past. He was
dealing faro at a gambling house in Denver when I, a young reporter,
first had the pleasure of looking into his cold blue eyes. It was a
notable fact that all the frontier bad men had eyes either gray or blue,
often a faded blue, expressionless, hard as jade.</p>

<p>It is only fair to Bat to say that the old-timers of Dodge do not
accept the Siringo point of view about him Wright said of him that he was
absolutely fearless and no trouble hunter. "Bat is a gentleman by
instinct, of pleasant manners, good address, and mild until aroused, and
then, for God's sake, look out. He is a leader of men, has much natural
ability, and good hard common sense. There is nothing low about him. He
is high-toned and broad-minded, cool and brave." I give this opinion for
what it is worth.</p>

<p>In any case, he was a most efficient sheriff. Dave Rudabaugh, later
associated with Billy the Kid in New Mexico, staged a train robbery at
Kinsley, Kansas, a territory not in Bat s jurisdiction. However, Bat set
out in pursuit with a posse. A near-blizzard was sweeping the country.
Bat made for Lovell's cattle camp, on the chance that the bandits would
be forced to take shelter there. It was a good guess. Rudabaugh's outfit
rode in, stiff and half frozen, and Bat captured the robbers without
firing a shot. This was one of many captures Bat made.</p>

<p>He had a deep sense of loyalty to his friends. On two separate
occasions he returned to Dodge, after having left the town, to straighten
out difficulties for his friends or to avenge them. The first time was
when Luke Short, who ran a gambling house in Dodge, had a difficulty with
Mayor Webster and his official family. Luke appears to have held the
opinion that the cards were stacked against him and that this was a
trouble out of which he could not shoot himself. He wired Bat Masterson
and Wyatt Earp to come to Dodge. They did, accompanied by another friend
or two. The mayor made peace on terms dictated by Short.</p>

<p>Bat's second return to Dodge was caused by a wire from his brother
James, who ran a dance hall in partnership with a man named Peacock.
Masterson wanted to discharge the bartender, Al Updegraph, a
brother-in-law of the other partner. A serious difficulty loomed in the
offing. Wherefore James called for help. Bat arrived at eleven one sunny
morning, another gunman at heel. At three o'clock he entrained for
Tombstone, Arizona, James beside him. The interval had been a busy one.
On the way up from the station (always known then as the depot), the two
men met Peacock and Updegraph. No amenities were exchanged. It was
strictly business. Bullets began to sing at once. The men stood across
the street from each other and emptied their weapons. Oddly enough,
Updegraph was the only one wounded. This little matter attended to, Bat
surrendered himself, was fined three dollars for carrying concealed
weapons, and released. He ate dinner, disposed of his brother's interest
in the saloon, and returned to the station.</p>

<p>Bat Masterson was a friend of Theodore Roosevelt, who was given to
admiring men with "guts," such men as Pat Garrett, Ben Daniels, and Billy
Tilghman. Mr. Roosevelt offered Masterson a place as United States
Marshal of Arizona. The ex-sheriff declined it. "If I took it," he
explained, "inside of a year I'd have to kill some fool boy who wanted to
get a reputation by killing me." The President then offered Bat a place
as Deputy United States Marshal of New York, and this was accepted. From
that time Masterson became a citizen of the Empire State. For seventeen
years he worked on a newspaper there and died a few years since with a
pen in his hand. He was respected by the entire newspaper fraternity.</p>

<p>Owing to the pleasant habit of the cowboys of shooting up the town
they were required, when entering the city limits, to hand over their
weapons to the marshal. The guns were deposited at Wright &amp; Beverly's
store, in a rack built for the purpose, and receipts given for them.
Sometimes a hundred six-shooters would be there at once. These were never
returned to their owners unless the cowboys were sober.</p>

<p>To be a marshal of one of these fighting frontier towns was no post to
be sought for by a supple politician. The place called for a chilled iron
nerve and an uncanny skill with the Colt. Tom Smith, one of the gamest
men and best officers who ever wore a star on the frontier, was killed in
the performance of his duty. Colonel Breakenridge says that Smith,
marshal of Abilene before "Wild Bill," was the gamest man he ever knew.
He was a powerful, athletic man who would arrest, himself unarmed, the
most desperate characters. He once told Breakenridge that anyone could
bring in a dead man but it took a good officer to take lawbreakers while
they were alive. In this he differed from Hickok who did not take
chances. He brought his men in dead. Nixon, assistant marshal at Dodge,
was murdered by "Mysterious Dave" Mathers, who himself once held the same
post. Ed Masterson, after displaying conspicuous courage many times, was
mortally wounded April 9, 1878, by two desperate men, Jack Wagner and Alf
Walker, who were terrorizing Front Street. Bat reached the scene a few
minutes later and heard the story. As soon as his brother had died Bat
went after the desperadoes, met them, and killed them both. The death of
Ed Masterson shocked the town. Civic organizations passed resolutions of
respect. During the funeral, which was the largest ever held in Dodge,
all business houses were closed. It is not on record that anybody
regretted the demise of the marshal's assassins.</p>

<p>Among those who came to Dodge each season to meet the Texas cattle
drive were Ben and Bill Thompson, gamblers who ran a faro bank.
Previously they had been accustomed to go to Ellsworth, while that point
was the terminus of the drive. Here they had ruled with a high hand,
killed the sheriff, and made their getaway safely. Bill got into a
shooting affray at Ogalala. He was badly wounded and was carried to the
hotel. It was announced openly that he would never leave town alive. Ben
did not dare to go to Ogalala, for his record there had outlawed him. He
came to Bat Masterson.</p>

<p>Bat knew Bill's nurse and arranged a plan for campaign. A sham battle
was staged at the big dance hall, during the excitement of which Bat and
the nurse carried the wounded man to the train, got him to a sleeper, and
into a bed. Buffalo Bill met them next day at North Platte. He had relays
of teams stationed on the road, and he and Bat guarded the sick man
during the long ride, bringing him safely to Dodge.</p>

<p>Emanuel Dubbs ran a roadhouse not far from Dodge about this time. He
was practising with his six-shooter one day when a splendidly built young
six-footer rode up to his place. The stranger watched him as he fired at
the tin cans he had put on fence posts. Presently the young fellow
suggested he throw a couple of the cans up in the air. Dubbs did so. Out
flashed the stranger's revolvers. There was a roar of exploding shots.
Dubbs picked up the cans. Four shots had been fired. Two bullets had
drilled through each can.</p>

<p>"Better not carry a six-shooter till you learn to shoot," Bill Cody
suggested, as he put his guns back into their holsters. "You'll be a
living temptation to some bad man." Buffalo Bill was on his way back to
North Platte</p>

<p>Life at Dodge was not all tragic. The six-shooter roared in the land a
good deal, but there were very many citizens who went quietly about their
business and took no part in the night life of the town. It was entirely
optional with the individual. The little city had its legitimate theatres
as well as its hurdy-gurdy houses and gambling dens. There was the Lady
Gay, for instance, a popular vaudeville resort. There were well-attended
churches. But Dodge boiled so with exuberant young life, often inflamed
by bad liquor, that both theatre and church were likely to be the scenes
of unexpected explosions.</p>

<p>A drunken cowboy became annoyed at Eddie Foy. While the comedian was
reciting "Kalamazoo in Michigan" the puncher began bombarding the frail
walls from outside with a .45 Colt's revolver. Eddie made a swift
strategic retreat. A deputy marshal was standing near the cowpuncher, who
was astride a plunging horse. The deputy fired twice. The first shot
missed. The second brought the rider down. He was dead before he hit the
ground. The deputy apologized later for his marksmanship, but he added by
way of explanation, "The bronc sure was sunfishin' plenty."</p>

<p>The killing of Miss Dora Hand, a young actress of much promise, was
regretted by everybody in Dodge. A young fellow named Kennedy, the son of
a rich cattleman, shot her unintentionally while he was trying to murder
James Kelly. He fled. A posse composed of Sheriff Masterson, William
Tilghman, Wyatt Earp, and Charles Bassett took the trail. They captured
the man after wounding him desperately. He was brought back to Dodge,
recovered, and escaped. His pistol arm was useless, but he used the other
well enough to slay several other victims before someone made an end of
him.</p>

<p>The gay good spirits of Dodge found continual expression in practical
jokes. The wilder these were the better pleased was the town. "Mysterious
Dave" was the central figure in one. An evangelist was conducting a
series of meetings. He made a powerful magnetic appeal, and many were the
hard characters who walked the sawdust trail. The preacher set his heart
on converting Dave Mathers, the worst of bad men and a notorious scoffer.
The meetings prospered. The church grew too small for the crowds and
adjourned to a dance hall. Dave became interested. He went to hear
Brother Johnson preach. He went a second time and a third. "He certainly
preaches like the Watsons an goes for sin all spraddled out," Dave
conceded. Brother Johnson grew hopeful. It seemed possible that this
brand could be snatched from the burning. He preached directly at Dave,
and Dave buried his head in his hands and sobbed. The preacher said he
was willing to die if he could convert this one vile sinner. Others of
the deacons agreed that they, too, would not object to going straight to
heaven with the knowledge that Dave had been saved.</p>

<p>"They were right excited an' didn't know straight up," an old-timer
explained. "Dave, he looked so whipped his ears flopped. Finally he rose,
an' said, 'I've got yore company, friends. Now, while we're all saved I
reckon we better start straight for heaven. First off, the preacher; then
the deacons; me last.' Then Dave whips out a whoppin' big gun and starts
shootin'. The preacher went right through a window an' took it with him.
He was sure in some hurry. The deacons hunted cover. Seemed like they was
willin' to postpone taking that through ticket to heaven. After that they
never did worry any more about Dave's soul."</p>

<p>Many rustlers gathered around Dodge in those days. The most notorious
of these was a gang of more than thirty under the leadership of Dutch
Henry and Tom Owens, two of the most desperate outlaws ever known in
Kansas A posse was organized to run down this gang under the leadership
of Dubbs, who had lost some of his stock. Before starting, the posse
telephoned Hays City to organize a company to head off the rustlers.
Twenty miles west of Hays the posse overtook the rustlers. A bloody
battle ensued, during which Owens and several other outlaws were killed
and Dutch Henry wounded six times. Several of the posse were also shot.
The story has a curious sequel. Many years later, when Emanuel Dubbs was
county judge of Wheeler County, Texas, Dutch Henry came to his house and
stayed there several days. He was a thoroughly reformed man. Not many
years ago Dutch Henry died in Colorado. He was a man with many good
qualities. Even in his outlaw days he had many friends among the
law-abiding citizens.</p>

<p>After the battle with the Henry-Owens gang rustlers operated much more
quietly, but they did not cease stealing. One night three men were hanged
to a cottonwood on Saw Log Creek, ten or twelve miles from Dodge. One of
these was a young man of a good family who had drifted into rustling and
had been carried away by the excitement of it. Another of the three was
the son of Tom Owens. To this day the place is known as Horse Thief
Ca&ntilde;on. During its years of prosperity many eminent men visited
Dodge including Generals Sherman and Sheridan, President Hayes and
General Miles. Its reputation had extended far and wide. It was the wild
and woolly cowboy capital of the Southwest, a place to quicken the blood
of any man. Nearly all that gay, hard-riding company of cowpunchers,
buffalo hunters, bad men, and pioneers have vanished into yesterday's
seven thousand years. But certainly Dodge once had its day and its night
of glory. No more rip-roaring town ever bucked the tiger.</p>
