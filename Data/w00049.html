<h1>The Gold Wolf</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h1>W.A. Fraser</h1>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<p>ALL day long Bulldog Carney had found, where the trail was soft, the
odd imprint of that goblined inturned hoof. All day in the saddle, riding
a trail that winds in and out among rocks, and trees, and cliffs
monotonously similar, the hush of the everlasting hills holding in
subjection man's soul, the towering giants of embattled rocks thrusting
up towards God's dome pigmying to nothingness that rat, a man, produces a
comatose condition of mind; man becomes a child, incapable of little
beyond the recognition of trivial things; the erratic swoop of a bird,
the sudden roar of a cataract, the dirge-like sigh of wind through the
harp of a giant pine.</p>

<p>And so, curiously, Bulldog's fancy had toyed aimlessly with the
history of the cayuse that owned that inturned left forefoot. Always
where the hoof's imprint lay was the flat track of a miner's boot, the
hob nails denting the black earth with stolid persistency. But the owner
of the miner's boot seemed of little moment; it was the abnormal hoof
that, by a strange perversity, haunted Carney.</p>

<p>The man was probably a placer miner coming down out of the Eagle
Hills, leading a pack pony that carried his duffel and, perhaps, a small
fortune in gold. Of course, like Carney, he was heading for steel, for
the town of Bucking Horse.</p>

<p>Toward evening, as Carney rode down a winding trail that led to the
ford of Singing Water, rounding an abrupt turn the mouth of a huge cave
yawned in the side of a cliff away to his left. Something of life had
melted into its dark shadow that had the semblance of a man; or it might
have been a bear or a wolf. Lower down in the valley that was called the
Valley of the Grizzley's Bridge, his buckskin shied, and with a snort of
fear left the trail and elliptically came back to it twenty yards
beyond.</p>

<p>In the centre of the ellipse, on the trail, stood a gaunt form, a huge
dog-wolf. He was a sinister figure, his snarling lips curled back from
strong yellow fangs, his wide powerful head low hung, and the black
bristles on his back erect in challenge.</p>

<p>The whole thing was weird, uncanny; a single wolf to stand his ground
in daylight was unusual.</p>

<p>Instinctively Bulldog reined in the buckskin, and half turning in the
saddle, with something of a shudder, searched the ground at the wolf's
feet dreading to find something. But there was nothing.</p>

<p>The dog-wolf, with a snarling twist of his head, sprang into the
bushes just as Carney dropped a hand to his gun; his quick eye had seen
the movement.</p>

<p>Carney had meant to camp just beyond the ford of Singing Water, but
the usually placid buckskin was fretful, nervous.</p>

<p>A haunting something was in the air; Carney, himself, felt it. The
sudden apparition of the wolf could not account for this mental unrest,
either in man or beast, for they were both inured to the trail, and a
wolf meant little beyond a skulking beast that a pistol shot would drive
away.</p>

<p>High above the rider towered Old Squaw Mountain. It was like a
battered feudal castle, on its upper reaches turret and tower and bastion
catching vagrant shafts of gold and green, as, beyond, in the far west, a
flaming sun slid down behind the Selkirks. Where he rode in the twisted
valley a chill had struck the air, suggesting vaults, dungeons; the giant
ferns hung heavy like the plumes of knights drooping with the death dew.
A reaching stretch of salmon bushes studded with myriad berries that
gleamed like topaz jewels hedged on both sides the purling, frothing
stream that still held the green tint of its glacier birth.</p>

<p>Many times in his opium running Carney had swung along this wild trail
almost unconscious of the way, his mind travelling far afield; now back
to the old days of club life; to the years of army routine; to the bright
and happy scenes where rich-gowned women and cultured men laughed and
bantered with him. At times it was the newer rough life of the West; the
ever-present warfare of man against man; the yesterday where he had won,
or the to-morrow where he might cast a losing hazard &mdash; where the
dice might turn groggily from a six-spotted side to a deuce, and the
thrower take a fall.</p>

<p>But to-night, as he rode, something of depression, of a narrow
environment, of an evil one, was astride the withers of his horse; the
mountains seemed to close in and oppress him. The buckskin, too, swung
his heavy lop ears irritably back and forth, back and forth. Sometimes
one ear was pricked forward as though its owner searched the beyond, the
now glooming valley that, at a little distance, was but a blur, the other
ear held backward as though it would drink in the sounds of pursuit.</p>

<p>Pursuit! that was the very thing; instinctively the rider turned in
his saddle, one hand on the horn, and held his piercing gray eyes on the
back trail, searching for the embodiment of this phantasy. The unrest had
developed that far into conception, something evil hovered on his trail,
man or beast. But he saw nothing but the swaying kaleidoscope of tumbling
forest shadows; rocks that, half gloomed, took fantastic forms; bushes
that swayed with the rolling gait of a grizzly.</p>

<p>The buckskin had quickened his pace as if, tired though he was, he
would go on beyond that valley of fear before they camped.</p>

<p>Where the trail skirted the brink of a cliff that had a drop of fifty
feet, Carney felt the horse tremble, and saw him hug the inner wall; and,
when they had rounded the point, the buckskin, with a snort of relief,
clamped the snaffle in his teeth and broke into a canter.</p>

<p>"I wonder &mdash; by Jove!" and Bulldog, pulling the buckskin to a
stand, slipped from his back, and searched the black-loamed trail.</p>

<p>"I believe you're right, Pat," he said, addressing the buckskin;
"something happened back there."</p>

<p>He walked for a dozen paces ahead of the horse, his keen gray eyes on
the earth. He stopped and rubbed his chin, thinking &mdash; thinking
aloud.</p>

<p>"There are tracks, Patsy boy &mdash; moccasins; but we've lost our
gunboat-footed friend. What do you make of that, Patsy &mdash; gone over
the cliff? But that damn wolf's pugs are here; he's travelled up and
down. By gad! two of them!"</p>

<p>Then, in silence, Carney moved along the way, searching and pondering;
cast into a curious, superstitious mood that he could not shake off. The
inturned hoof-print had vanished, so the owner of the big feet that
carried hob-nailed boots did not ride.</p>

<p>Each time that Carney stopped to bend down in study of the trail the
buckskin pushed at him fretfully with his soft muzzle and rattled the
snaffle against his bridle teeth.</p>

<p>At last Carney stroked the animal's head reassuringly, saying: "You're
quite right, pal &mdash; it's none of our business. Besides, we're a pair
of old grannies imagining things."</p>

<p>But as he lifted to the saddle, Bulldog, like the horse, felt a
compelling inclination to go beyond the Valley of the Grizzley's Bridge
to camp for the night.</p>

<p>Even as they climbed to a higher level of flat land, from back on the
trail that was now lost in the deepening gloom, came the howl of a wolf;
and then, from somewhere beyond floated the answering call of the
dog-wolf's mate &mdash; a whimpering, hungry note in her weird wail.</p>

<p>"Bleat, damn you!" Carney cursed softly; "if you bother us I'll sit by
with a gun and watch Patsy boy kick you to death."</p>

<p>As if some genii of the hills had taken up and sent on silent waves
his challenge, there came filtering through the pines and birch a
snarling yelp.</p>

<p>"By gad!" and Carney cocked his ear, pulling the horse to a stand.</p>

<p>Then in the heavy silence of the wooded hills he pushed on again
muttering, "There's something wrong about that wolf howl &mdash; it's
different."</p>

<p>Where a big pine had showered the earth with cones till the covering
was soft, and deep, and springy, and odorous like a perfumed mattress of
velvet, he hesitated; but the buckskin, in the finer animal reasoning,
pleaded with little impatient steps and shakes of the head that they push
on.</p>

<p>Carney yielded, saying softly: "Go on, kiddie boy; peace of mind is
good dope for a sleep."</p>

<p>So it was ten o'clock when the two travellers, Carney and Pat, camped
in an open, where the moon, like a silver mirror, bathed the earth in
reassuring light. Here the buckskin had come to a halt, filled his lungs
with the perfumed air in deep draughts, and turning his head half round
had waited for his partner to dismount.</p>

<p>It was curious this man of steel nerve and flawless courage feeling at
all the guidance of unknown threatenings, unexplainable disquietude. He
did not even build a fire; but choosing a place where the grass was rich
he spread his blanket beside the horse's picket pin.</p>

<p>Bulldog's life had provided him with different sleeping moods; it was
a curious subconscious matter of mental adjustment before he slipped away
from the land of knowing. Sometimes he could sleep like a tired laborer,
heavily, unresponsive to the noise of turmoil; at other times, when deep
sleep might cost him his life, his senses hovered so close to
consciousness that a dried leaf scurrying before the wind would call him
to alert action. So now he lay on his blanket, sometimes over the border
of spirit land, and sometimes conscious of the buckskin's pull at the
crisp grass. Once he came wide awake, with no movement but the lifting of
his eyelids. He had heard nothing; and now the gray eyes, searching the
moonlit plain, saw nothing. Yet within was a full consciousness that
there was something &mdash; not close, but hovering there beyond.</p>

<p>The buckskin also knew. He had been lying down, but with a snort of
discontent his forequarters went up and he canted to his feet with a
spring of wariness. Perhaps it was the wolves.</p>

<p>But after a little Carney knew it was not the wolves; they, cunning
devils, would have circled beyond his vision, and the buckskin, with his
delicate scent, would have swung his head the full circle of the compass;
but he stood facing down the back trail; the thing was there,
watching.</p>

<p>After that Carney slept again, lighter if possible, thankful that he
had yielded to the wisdom of the horse and sought the open.</p>

<p>Half a dozen times there was this gentle transition from the sleep
that was hardly a sleep, to a full acute wakening. And then the paling
sky told that night was slipping off to the western ranges, and that
beyond the Rockies, to the east, day was sleepily travelling in from the
plains.</p>

<p>The horse was again feeding; and Carney, shaking oh the lethargy of
his broken sleep, gathered some dried stunted bushes, and, building a
little fire, made a pot of tea; confiding to the buckskin as he mounted
that he considered himself no end of a superstitious ass to have bothered
over a nothing.</p>

<p>Not far from where Carney had camped the trail he followed turned to
the left to sweep around a mountain, and here it joined, for a time, the
trail running from Fort Steel west toward the Kootenay. The sun, topping
the Rockies, had lifted from the earth the graying shadows, and now
Carney saw, as he thought, the hoof-prints of the day before.</p>

<p>There was a feeling of relief with this discovery. There had been a
morbid disquiet in his mind; a mental conviction that something had
happened that intoed cayuse and his huge-footed owner. Now all the weird
fancies of the night had been just a vagary of mind. Where the trail was
earthed, holding clear impressions, he dismounted, and walked ahead of
the buckskin, reading the lettered clay. Here and there was imprinted a
moccasined foot; once there was the impression of boots; but they were
not the huge imprints of hob-nailed soles. They showed that a man had
dismounted, and then mounted again; and the cayuse had not an inturned
left forefoot; also the toe wall of one hind foot was badly broken. His
stride was longer, too; he did not walk with the short step of a pack
pony.</p>

<p>The indefinable depression took possession of Bulldog again; he tried
to shake it off &mdash; it was childish. The huge-footed one perhaps was
a prospector, and had wandered up into some one of the gulches looking
for gold. That was objecting Reason formulating an hypothesis.</p>

<p>Then presently Carney discovered the confusing element of the same
cayuse tracks heading the other way, as if the man on horseback had
travelled both up and down the trail.</p>

<p>Where the Bucking Horse trail left the Kootenay trail after circling
the mountain, Carney saw that the hoof prints continued toward Kootenay.
And there were a myriad of tracks; many mounted men had swung from the
Bucking Horse trail to the Kootenay path; they had gone and returned, for
the hoof prints that toed toward Bucking Horse lay on top.</p>

<p>This also was strange; men did not ride out from the sleepy old town
in a troop like cavalry. There was but one explanation, the explanation
of the West &mdash; those mounted men had ridden after some body &mdash;
had trailed somebody who was wanted quick. This crescendo to his
associated train of thought obliterated mentally the goblin-footed
cayuse, the huge hob-nailed boot, the something at the cliff, the
hovering oppression of the night &mdash; everything.</p>

<p>Carney closed his mind to the torturing riddle and rode, sometimes
humming an Irish ballad of Mangin's.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when he rode into Bucking Horse; and Bucking
Horse was in a ferment.</p>

<p>Seth Long's hotel, the Gold Nugget, was the cauldron in which the
waters of unrest seethed.</p>

<p>A lynching was in a state of almost completion, with Jeanette Holt's
brother, Harry, elected to play the leading part of the lynched. Through
the deference paid to his well-known activity when hostile events were
afoot, Carney was cordially drawn into the maelstrom of ugly-tempered
men.</p>

<p>Jeanette's brother may be said to have suffered from a preponderance
of opinion against him, for only Jeanette, and with less energy, Seth
Long, were on his side. All Bucking Horse, angry Bucking Horse, was for
stringing him up tout de suite. The times were propitious for this
entertainment, for Sergeant Black, of the Mounted Police, was over at
Fort Steel, or somewhere else on patrol, and the law was in the keeping
of the mob.</p>

<p>Ostensibly Carney ranged himself on the side of law and order. That is
what he meant when, leaning carelessly against the Nugget bar, one hand
on his hip, chummily close to the butt of his six-gun, he said:</p>

<p>"This town had got a pretty good name, as towns go in the mountains,
and my idea of a man that's too handy at the lynch game is that he's a
pretty poor sport."</p>

<p>"How's that, Bulldog?" Kootenay Jim snapped.</p>

<p>"He's a poor sport," Carney drawled, "because he's got a hundred to
one the best of it &mdash; first, last, and always; he isn't in any
danger when he starts, because it's a hundred men to one poor devil, who,
generally, isn't armed, and he knows that at the finish his mates will
perjure themselves to save their own necks. I've seen one or two lynch
mobs and they were generally egged on by men who were yellow."</p>

<p>Carney's gray eyes looked out over the room full of angry men with a
quiet thoughtful steadiness that forced home the conviction that he was
wording a logic he would demonstrate. No other man in that room could
have stood up against that plank bar and declared himself without being
called quick.</p>

<p>"You hear fust what this rat done, Bulldog, then we'll hear what
you've got to say," Kootenay growled.</p>

<p>"That's well spoken, Kootenay," Bulldog answered. "I'm fresh in off
the trail, and perhaps I'm quieter than the rest of you, but first, being
fresh in off the trail, there's a little custom to be observed."</p>

<p>With a sweep of his hand Carney waved a salute to a line of bottles
behind the bar.</p>

<p>Jeanette, standing in the open door that led from the bar to the
dining-room, gripping the door till her nails sank into the pine, felt
hot tears gush into her eyes. How wise, how cool, this brave Bulldog that
she loved so well. She had had no chance to plead with him for help. He
had just come into that murder-crazed throng, and the words had been
hurled at him from a dozen mouths that her brother Harry &mdash; Harry
the waster, the no-good, the gambler &mdash; had been found to be the man
who had murdered returning miners on the trail for their gold, and that
they were going to string him up.</p>

<p>And now there he stood, her god of a man, Bulldog Carney, ranged on
her side, calm, and brave. It was the first glint of hope since they had
brought her brother in, bound to the back of a cayuse. She had pushed her
way amongst the men, but they were like wolves; she had pleaded and
begged for delay, but the evidence was so overwhelming; absolutely
hopeless it had appeared. But now something whispered "Hope".</p>

<p>It was curious the quieting effect that single drink at the bar had;
the magnetism of Carney seemed to envelop the men, to make them
reasonable. Ordinarily they were reasonable men. Bulldog knew this, and
he played the card of reason.</p>

<p>For the two or three gun men &mdash; Kootenay Jim, John of Slocan, and
Denver Ike &mdash; Carney had his own terrible personality and his
six-gun; he could deal with those three toughs if necessary.</p>

<p>"Now tell me, boys, what started this hellery," Carney asked when they
had drunk.</p>

<p>The story was fired at him; if a voice hesitated, another took up the
narrative.</p>

<p>Miners returning from the gold field up in the Eagle Hills had
mysteriously disappeared, never turning up at Bucking Horse. A man would
have left the Eagle Hills, and somebody drifting in from the same place
later on, would ask for him at Bucking Horse &mdash; nobody had seen
him.</p>

<p>Then one after another two skeletons had been found on the trail; the
bodies had been devoured by wolves.</p>

<p>"And wolves don't eat gold &mdash; not what you'd notice, as a steady
chuck," Kootenay Jim yelped.</p>

<p>"Men wolves do," Carney thrust back, and his gray eyes said plainly,
"That's your food, Jim."</p>

<p>"Meanin' what by that, pard?" Kootenay snarled, his face evil in a
threat.</p>

<p>"Just what the words convey &mdash; you sort them out, Kootenay."</p>

<p>But Miner Graham interposed. "We got kinder leery about this wolf
game, Carney, 'cause they ain't bothered nobody else 'cept men packin' in
their winnin's from the Eagle Hills; and four days ago Caribou Dave
&mdash; here he is sittin' right here &mdash; he arrives packin'
Fourteen-foot Johnson &mdash; that is, all that's left of
Fourteen-foot."</p>

<p>"Johnson was my pal," Caribou Dave interrupted, a quaver in his voice,
"and he leaves the Eagle Nest two days ahead of me, packin' a big
clean-up of gold on a cayuse. He was goin' to mooch aroun' Buckin' Horse
till I creeps-in afoot, then we was goin' out. We been together a good
many years, ol' Fourteen foot and me."</p>

<p>Something seemed to break in Caribou's voice and Graham added: "Dave
finds his mate at the foot of a cliff."</p>

<p>Carney started; and instinctively Kootenay's hand dropped to his gun,
thinking something was going to happen.</p>

<p>"I dunno just what makes me look there for Fourteen-foot, Bulldog,"
Caribou Dave explained. "I was comin' along the trail seein' the marks of
'em damn big feet of hisn, and they looked good to me &mdash; I guess I
was gettin' kinder homesick for him; when I'd camp I'd go out and paw 'em
tracks; 'twas kinder like shakin' hands. We been together a good many
years, buckin' the mountains and the plains, and sometimes havin' a bit
of fun. I'm comin' along, as I says, and I sees a kinder scrimmage like,
as if his old tan-colored cayuse had got gay, or took the blind staggers,
or somethin'; there was a lot of tracks. But I give up thinkin' it out,
'cause I knowed if the damn cayuse had jack-rabbited any, Fourteen-foot'd
pick him and his load up and carry him. Then I see some wolf tracks
&mdash; clang near as big as a steer's they was &mdash; and I figger
Fourteen-foot's had a set-to with a couple of 'em timber coyotes and
lammed hell's delight out of 'em, 'cause he could've done it. Then I'm
follerin' the cayuse's trail agen, pickin' it up here and there, and all
at onct it jumps me that the big feet is missin'. Sure I natural figger
Johnson's got mussed up a bit with the wolves and is ridin'; but there's
the clang wolf tracks agent And some moccasin feet has been passierin'
along, too. Then the hoss tracks cuts out just same's if he'd spread his
wings and gone up in the air &mdash; they just ain't."</p>

<p>"Then Caribou gets a hunch and goes back and peeks over the cliff,"
Miner Graham added, for old David had stopped speaking to bite viciously
at a black plug of tobacco to hide his feelings.</p>

<p>"I dunno what made me do it," Caribou interrupted; "it was just same's
Fourteen-foot's callin' me. There ain't nobody can make me believe that
if two men paddles together twenty years, had their little fights, and
show-downs, and still sticks, that one of 'em is going to cut clean out
just 'cause he goes over the Big Divide &mdash; 'tain't natural. I tell
you, boys, Fourteen-foot's callin' me &mdash; that's what he is, when I
goes back."</p>

<p>Then Graham had to take up the narrative, for Caribou, heading
straight for the bar, pointed dumbly at a black bottle.</p>

<p>"Yes, Carney," Graham said, "Caribou packs into Buckin' Horse on his
back what was left of Fourteen-foot, and there wasn't no gold and no sign
of the cayuse. Then we swarms out, a few of us, and picks up cayuse
tracks most partic'lar where the Eagle Hills trail hits the trail for
Kootenay. And when we overhaul the cayuse that's layin' down 'em tracks
it's Fourteen-foot's hawse, and a-ridin' him is Harry Holt."</p>

<p>"And he's got the gold you was talkie' 'bout wolves eatin', Bulldog,"
Kootenay Jim said with a sneer. "He was hangin' 'round here busted,
cleaned to the bone, and there he's a-ridin' Fourteen-foot's cayuse, with
lots of gold."</p>

<p>"That's the whole case then, is it, boys?" Carney asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Ain't it enough?" Kootenay Jim snarled.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't. You were tried for murder once yourself, Kootenay, and
you got off, though everybody knew it was the dead man's money in your
pocket. You got off because nobody saw you kill the man, and the
circumstantial evidence gave you the benefit of the doubt."</p>

<p>"I ain't bein' tried for this, Bulldog. Your bringin' up old scores
might get you in wrong."</p>

<p>"You're not being tried, Kootenay, but another man is, and I say he's
got to have a fair chance. You bring him here, boys, and let me hear his
story; that's only fair, men amongst men. Because I give you fair
warning, boys, if this lynching goes through, and you're in wrong, I'm
going to denounce you; not one of you will get away &mdash; not one!"</p>

<p>"We'll bring him, Bulldog," Graham said; "what you say is only fair,
but swing he will."</p>

<p>Jeanette's brother had been locked in the pen in the log police
barracks. He was brought into the Gold Nugget, and his defence was what
might be called powerfully weak. It was simply a statement that he had
bought the cayuse from an Indian on the trail outside Bucking Horse. He
refused to say where he had got the gold, simply declaring that he had
killed nobody, had never seen Fourteen-foot Johnson, and knew nothing
about the murder.</p>

<p>Something in the earnestness of the man convinced Carney that he was
innocent. However, that was, so far as Carney's action was concerned, a
minor matter; it was Jeanette's brother, and he was going to save him
from being lynched if he had to fight the roomful of men &mdash; there
was no doubt about that in his mind.</p>

<p>"I can't say, boys," Carney began, "that you can be blamed for
thinking you've got the right man."</p>

<p>"That's what we figgered," Graham declared.</p>

<p>"But you've not gone far enough in sifting the evidence if you sure
don't want to lynch an innocent man. The only evidence you have is that
you caught Harry on Johnson's cayuse. How do you know it's Johnsons
cayuse?"</p>

<p>"Caribou says it is," Graham answered.</p>

<p>"And Harry says it was an Indian's cayuse," Carney affirmed.</p>

<p>"He most natural just ordinar'ly lies about it," Kootenay ventured
viciously.</p>

<p>"Where's the cayuse?" Carney asked. "There ain't no thinkin' 'bout
it," Caribou an</p>

<p>"Out in the stable," two or three voices answered.</p>

<p>"I want to see him. Mind, boys, I'm working for you as much as for
that poor devil you want to string up, because if you get the wrong man
I'm going to denounce you, that's as sure as God made little apples."</p>

<p>His quiet earnestness was compelling. All the fierce heat of passion
had gone from the men; there still remained the grim determination that,
convinced they were right, nothing but the death of some of them would
check. But somehow they felt that the logic of conviction would swing
even Carney to their side.</p>

<p>So, without even a word from a leader, they all thronged out to the
stable yard; the cayuse was brought forth, and, at Bulldog's request, led
up and down the yard, his hoofs leaving an imprint in the bare clay at
every step. It was the footprints alone that interested Carney. He
studied them intently, a horrible dread in his heart as he searched for
that goblined hoof that inturned. But the two forefeet left saucer-like
imprints, that, though they were both slightly intoed, as is the way of a
cayuse, neither was like the curious goblined track that had so fastened
on his fancy out in the Valley of the Grizzley's Bridge.</p>

<p>And also there was the broken toe wall of the hind foot that he had
seen on the newer trail.</p>

<p>He turned to Caribou Dave, asking, "What makes you think this is
Johnson's pack horse?"</p>

<p>"There ain't no thinkin' 'bout it," Caribou answered with asperity.
"When I see my boots I don't think they're mine, I just most natur'ly
figger they are and pull em on. I'd know that dun-colored rat if I see
him in a wild herd."</p>

<p>"And yet," Carney objected in an even tone, "this isn't the cayuse
that Johnson toted out his duffel from the Eagle Hills on."</p>

<p>A cackle issued from Kootenay Jim's long, scraggy neck:</p>

<p>"That settles it, boys; Bulldog passes the buck and the game's over.
Caribou is just an ord'nary liar, 'cordin' to Judge Carney."</p>

<p>"Caribou is perfectly honest in his belief," Carney declared. "There
isn't more than half a dozen colors for horses, and there are a good many
thousand horses in this territory, so a great many of them are the same
color. And the general structure of different cayuses is as similar as so
many wheel-barrows. That brand on his shoulder may be a C, or a new moon,
or a flapjack."</p>

<p>He turned to Caribou: "What brand had Fourteen-foot's cayuse?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," the old chap answered surlily, "but it was there same
place it's restin' now &mdash; it ain't shifted none since you fingered
it."</p>

<p>"That won't do, boys," Carney said; "if Caribou can't swear to a
horse's brand, how can he swear to the beast?"</p>

<p>"And if Fourteen-foot'd come back and stand up here and swear it was
his hawse, that wouldn't do either, would it, Bulldog?" And Kootenay
cackled.</p>

<p>"Johnson wouldn't say so &mdash; he'd know better. His cayuse had a
club foot, an inturned left forefoot. I picked it up, here and there, for
miles back on the trail, sometimes fair on top of Johnson's big boot
track, and sometimes Johnson's were on top when he travelled behind."</p>

<p>The men stared; and Graham asked: "What do you say to that, Caribou?
Did you ever map out Fourteen-foot's cayuse &mdash; what his travellers
was like?"</p>

<p>"I never looked at his feet &mdash; there wasn't no reason to; I was
minin'."</p>

<p>"There's another little test we can make," Carney suggested. "Have you
got any of Johnson's belongings &mdash; a coat?"</p>

<p>"We got his coat," Graham answered; "it was pretty bad wrecked with
the wolves, and we kinder fixed the remains up decent in a suit of store
clothes."</p>

<p>At Carney's request the coat was brought, a rough Mackinaw, and from
one of the men present he got a miner's magnifying glass, saying, as he
examined the coat:</p>

<p>"This ought, naturally, to be pretty well filled with hairs from that
cayuse of Johnson's; and while two horses may look alike, there's
generally a difference in the hair."</p>

<p>Carney's surmise proved correct; dozens of short hairs were imbedded
in the coat, principally in the sleeves. Then hair was plucked from many
different parts of the cayuse's body, and the two lots were viewed
through the glass. They were different. The hair on the cayuse standing
in the yard was coarser, redder, longer, for its Indian owner had let it
run like a wild goat; and Fourteen-foot had given his cayuse considerable
attention. There were also some white hairs in the coat warp, and on this
cayuse there was not a single white hair to be seen.</p>

<p>When questioned Caribou would not emphatically declare that there had
not been a star or a white stripe in the forehead of Johnson's horse.</p>

<p>These things caused one or two of the men to waver, for if it were not
Johnson's cayuse, if Caribou were mistaken, there was no direct evidence
to connect Harry Holt with the murder.</p>

<p>Kootenay Jim objected that the examination of the hair was nothing;
that Carney, like a clever lawyer, was trying to get the murderer off on
a technicality. As to the club foot they had only Carney's guess, whereas
Caribou had never seen any club foot on Johnson's horse.</p>

<p>"We can prove that part of it," Graham said; "we can go back on the
trail and see what Bulldog seen."</p>

<p>Half a dozen men approved this, saying: "We'll put off the hangin' and
go back."</p>

<p>But Carney objected.</p>

<p>When he did so Kootenay Jim and John from Slocan raised a howl of
derision, Kootenay saying: "When we calls his bluff he throws his hand in
the discard. There ain't no club foot anywheres; it's just a game to gain
time to give this coyote, Holt, a chance to make a get-away. We're bein'
buffaloed &mdash; we're wastin' time. We gets a murderer on a murdered
man's hawse, with the gold in his pockets, and Bulldog Carney puts some
hawse hairs under a glass, hands out a pipe dream bout some ghost tracks
back on the trail, and reaches out to grab the pot. Hell! you'd think we
was a damn lot of tenderfeet."</p>

<p>This harangue had an effect on the angry men, but seemingly none
whatever upon Bulldog, for he said quietly:</p>

<p>"I don't want a troop of men to go back on the trail just now, because
I'm going out myself to bring the murderer in. I can get him alone, for
if he does see me he won't think that I'm after him, simply that I'm
trailing. But if a party goes they'll never see him. He's a clever devil,
and will make his get-away. All I want on this evidence is that you hold
Holt till I get back. I'll bring the foreleg of that cayuse with a club
foot, for there's no doubt the murderer made sure that the wolves got him
too."</p>

<p>They had worked back into the hotel by now, and, inside, Kootenay Jim
and his two cronies had each taken a big drink of whisky, whispering
together as they drank.</p>

<p>As Carney and Graham entered, Kootenay's shrill voice was saying:</p>

<p>"We're bein' flim-flammed &mdash; played for a lot of kids. There
ain't been a damn thing 'cept lookin' at some hawse hairs through a
glass. Men has been murdered on the trail, and who done it &mdash;
somebody. Caribou's mate was murdered, and we find his gold on a man that
was stony broke here, was bummin' on the town, spongin' on Seth Long; he
hadn't two bits. And 'cause his sister stands well with Bulldog he palms
this three-card trick with hawse hairs, and we got to let the murderer
go."</p>

<p>"You lie, Kootenay!" The words had come from Jeanette. "My brother
wouldn't tell you where he got the gold &mdash; he'd let you hang him
first; but I will tell. I took it out of Seth's safe and gave it to him
to get out of the country, because I knew that you and those two other
hounds, Slocan and Denver, would murder him some night because he knocked
you down for insulting me."</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" Kootenay screamed; "you and Bulldog 're runnin' mates
and you've put this up."</p>

<p>There was a cry of warning from Slocan, and Kootenay whirled, drawing
his gun. As he did so him arm dropped and his gun clattered to the floor,
for Carney's bullet had splintered its butt, incidentally clipping away a
finger. And the same weapon in Carney's hand was covering Slocan and
Denver as they stood side by side, their backs to the bar.</p>

<p>No one spoke; almost absolute stillness hung in the air for five
seconds. Half the men in the room had drawn, but no one pulled a trigger
&mdash; no one spoke.</p>

<p>It was Carney who broke the silence:</p>

<p>"Jeanette, bind that hound's hand up; and you, Seth, send for the
doctor &mdash; I guess he's too much of a man to be in this gang."</p>

<p>A wave of relief swept over the room; men coughed or spat as the
tension slipped, dropping their guns back into holsters.</p>

<p>Kootenay Jim, cowed by the damaged hand, holding it in his left,
followed Jeanette out of the room.</p>

<p>As the girl disappeared Harry Holt, who had stood between the two men,
his wrists bound behind his back, said:</p>

<p>"My sister told a lie to shield me. I stole the gold myself from
Seth's safe. I wanted to get out of this hell hole 'cause I knew I'd got
to kill Kootenay or he'd get me. That's why I didn't tell before where
the gold come from."</p>

<p>"Here, Seth," Carney called as Long came back into the room, "you
missed any gold &mdash; what do you know about Holt's story that he got
the gold from your safe?"</p>

<p>"I ain't looked &mdash; I don't keep no close track of what's in that
iron box; I jus' keep the key, and a couple of bags might get lifted and
I wouldn't know. If Jeanette took a bag or two to stake her brother, I
guess she's got a right to, 'cause we're pardners in all I got."</p>

<p>"I took the key when Seth was sleeping," Harry declared. "Jeanette
didn't know I was going to take it."</p>

<p>"But your sister claims she took it, so how'd she say that if it isn't
a frame-up?" Graham asked.</p>

<p>"I told her just as I was pullin' out, so she wouldn't let Seth get in
wrong by blamin' her or somebody else."</p>

<p>"Don't you see, boys," Carney interposed, "if you'd swung off this
man, and all this was proved afterwards, you'd be in wrong? You didn't
find on Harry a tenth of the gold Fourteen-foot likely had."</p>

<p>"That skunk hid it," Caribou declared; "he just kept enough to get out
with."</p>

<p>Poor old Caribou was thirsting for revenge; in his narrowed hate he
would have been satisfied if the party had pulled a perfect stranger off
a passing train and lynched him; it would have been a quid pro quo. He
felt that he was being cheated by the superior cleverness of Bulldog
Carney. He had seen miners beaten out of their just gold claims by
professional sharks; the fine reasoning, the microscopic evidence of the
hairs, the intoed hoof, all these things were beyond him. He was honest
in his conviction that the cayuse was Johnson's, and feared that the man
who had killed his friend would slip through their fingers.</p>

<p>"It's just like this, boys," he said, "me and Fourteen-foot was
together so long that if he was away somewhere I'd know he was comin'
back a day afore he hit camp &mdash; I'd feel it, same's I turned back on
the trail there and found him all chawed up by the wolves. There wasn't
no reason to look over that cliff only ol' Fourteen-foot a-callin' me.
And now he's a-tellin' me inside that that skunk there murdered him when
he wasn't lookin'. And if you chaps ain't got the sand to push this to a
finish I'll get the man that killed Fourteen-foot; he won't never get
away. If you boys is just a pack of coyotes that howls good and plenty
till somebody calls 'em, and is goin' to slink away with your tails
between your legs for fear you'll be rounded up for the lynchin', you can
turn this murderer loose right now &mdash; you don't need to worry
what'll happen to him. I'll be too danged lonesome without Fourteen-foot
to figger what's comin' to me. Turn him loose &mdash; take the hobbles
off him. You fellers go home and pull your blankets over your heads so's
you won't see no ghosts."</p>

<p>Carney's sharp gray eyes watched the old fanatic's every move; he let
him talk till he had exhausted himself with his passionate words; then he
said:</p>

<p>"Caribou, you're some man. You'd go through a whole tribe of Indians
for a chum. You believe you're right, and that's just what I'm trying to
do in this, find out who is right &mdash; we don't want to wrong anybody.
You can come back on the trail with me, and I'll show you the club-footed
tracks; I'll let you help me get the right man."</p>

<p>The old chap turned his humpy shoulders, and looked at Carney out of
bleary, weasel eyes set beneath shaggy brows; then he shrilled:</p>

<p>"I'll see you in hell fuss; I've heerd o' you, Bulldog; I've heerd you
had a wolverine skinned seven ways of the jack for tricks, and by the
rings on a Big Horn I believe it. You know that while I'm here that jack
rabbit ain't goin' to get away &mdash; and he ain't; you can bet your
soul on that, Bulldog. We'd go out on the trail and we'd find that
Wie-sah-ke-chack, the Indian's devil, had stole 'em pipe-dream,
club-footed tracks, and when we come back the man that killed my chum,
old Fourteen-foot, would be down somewhere where a smart-Aleck lawyer 'd
get him off."</p>

<p>It took an hour of cool reasoning on the part of Carney to extract
from that roomful of men a promise that they would give Holt three days
of respite, Carney giving his word that he would not send out any
information to the police but would devote the time to bringing in the
murderer.</p>

<p>Kootenay Jim had had his wound dressed. He was in an ugly mood over
the shooting, but the saner members of the lynching party felt that he
had brought the quarrel on himself; that he had turned so viciously on
Jeanette, whom they all liked, caused the men to feel that he had got
pretty much his just deserts. He had drawn his gun first, and when a man
does that he's got to take the consequences. He was a gambler, and a
gambler generally had to abide by the gambling chance in gun play as well
as by the fall of a card.</p>

<p>But Carney had work to do, and he was just brave enough to not be
foolhardy. He knew that the three toughs would waylay him in the dark
without compunction. They were now thirsting not only for young Holt's
life, but his. So, saying openly that he would start in the morning, when
it was dark he slipped through the back entrance of the hotel to the
stable, and led his buckskin out through a corral and by a back way to
the tunnel entrance of the abandoned Little Widow mine. Here he left the
horse and returned to the hotel, set up the drinks, and loafed about for
a time, generally giving the three desperadoes the impression that he was
camped for the night in the Gold Nugget, though Graham, in whom he had
confided, knew different.</p>

<p>Presently he slipped away, and Jeanette, who had got the key from
Seth, unlocked the door that led down to the long communicating drift, at
the other end of which was the opening to the Little Widow mine.</p>

<p>Jeanette closed the door and followed Carney down the stairway. At the
foot of the stairs he turned, saying: "You shouldn't do this."</p>

<p>"Why, Bulldog?"</p>

<p>"Well, you saw why this afternoon. Kootenay Jim has got an arm in a
sling because he can't understand. Men as a rule don't understand much
about women, so a woman has always got to wear armor."</p>

<p>"But we understand, Bulldog; and Seth does."</p>

<p>"Yes, girl, we understand; but Seth can only understand the evident.
You clamber up the stairs quick."</p>

<p>"My God! Bulldog, see what you're doing for me now. You never would
stand for Harry yourself."</p>

<p>"If he'd been my brother I should, just as you have, girl."</p>

<p>"That's it, Bulldog, you're doing all this, standing there holding up
a mob of angry men, because he's my brother."</p>

<p>"You called the turn, Jeanette."</p>

<p>"And all I can do, all I can say is, thank you. Is that all?"</p>

<p>"That's all, girl. It's more than enough."</p>

<p>He put a strong hand on her arm, almost shook her, saying with an
earnestness that the playful tone hardly masked:</p>

<p>"When you've got a true friend let him do all the friending &mdash;
then you'll hold him; the minute you try to rearrange his life you start
backing the losing card. Now, good-bye, girl; I've got work to do. I'll
bring in that wolf of the trail; I've got him marked down in a cave
&mdash; I'll get him. You tell that pin-headed brother of yours to stand
pat. And if Kootenay starts any deviltry go straight to Graham.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>Cool fingers touched the girl on the forehead then she stood alone
watching the figure slipping down the gloomed passage of the drift,
lighted candle in hand.</p>

<p>Carney led his buckskin from the mine tunnel climbed the hillside to a
back trail, and mounting rode silently at a walk till the yellow blobs of
light that was Bucking Horse lay behind him. Then at a little hunch of
his heels the horse broke into a shuffling trot.</p>

<p>It was near midnight when he camped; both he and the buckskin had
eaten robustly back at the Gold Nugget Hotel, and Carney, making the
horse lie down by tapping him gently on the shins with his quirt, rolled
himself in his blanket and slept close beside the buckskin &mdash; they
were like two men in a huge bed.</p>

<p>All next day he rode, stopping twice to let the buckskin feed, and
eating a dry meal himself, building no fire. He had a conviction that the
murderer of the gold hunters made the Valley of the Grizzley's Bridge his
stalking ground. And if the devil who stalked these returning miners was
still there he felt certain that he would get him.</p>

<p>There had been nothing to rouse the murderer's suspicion that these
men were known to have been murdered.</p>

<p>A sort of fatality hangs over a man who once starts in on a crime of
that sort; he becomes like a man who handles dynamite &mdash; careless,
possessed of a sense of security, of fatalism. Carney had found all
desperadoes that way, each murder had made them more sure of themselves,
it generally had been so easy.</p>

<p>Caribou Dave had probably passed without being seen by the murderer;
indeed he had passed that point early in the morning, probably while the
ghoul of the trail slept; the murderer would reason that if there was any
suspicion in Bucking Horse that miners had been made away with, a posse
would have come riding over the back trail, and the murderer would have
ample knowledge of their approach.</p>

<p>To a depraved mind, such as his, there was a terrible fascination in
this killing of men, and capturing their gold; he would keep at It like a
gambler who has struck a big winning streak; he would pile up gold,
probably in the cave Carney had seen the mouth of, even if it were more
than he could take away. It was the curse of the lust of gold, and, once
started, the devilish murder lust.</p>

<p>Carney had an advantage. He was looking for a man in a certain
locality, and the man, not knowing of his approach, not dreading it,
would be watching the trail in the other direction for victims. Even if
he had met him full on the trail Carney would have passed the time of day
and ridden on, as if going up into the Eagle Hills. And no doubt the
murderer would let him pass without action. It was only returning miners
he was interested in. Yes, Carney had an advantage, and if the man were
still there he would get him.</p>

<p>His plan was to ride the buckskin to within a short distance of where
the murders had been committed, which was evidently in the neighborhood
of the cliff at the bottom of which Fourteen-foot Johnson had been found,
and go forward on foot until he had thoroughly reconnoitered the ground.
He felt that he would catch sight of the murderer somewhere between that
point and the cave, for he was convinced that the cave was the home of
this trail devil.</p>

<p>The uncanny event of the wolves was not so simple. The curious tone of
the wolf's howl had suggested a wild dog &mdash; that is, a creature that
was half dog, half wolf; either whelped that way in the forests, or a
train dog that had escaped. Even a fanciful weird thought entered
Carney's mind that the murderer might be on terms of dominion over this
half-wild pair; they might know him well enough to leave him alone, and
yet devour his victims. This was conjecture, rather far-fetched, but
still not impossible. An Indian's train dogs would obey their master, but
pull down a white man quick enough if he were helpless.</p>

<p>However, the man was the thing.</p>

<p>The sun was dipping behind the jagged fringe of mountain tops to the
west when Carney slipped down into the Valley of the Grizzley's Bridge,
and, fording the stream, rode on to within a hundred and fifty yards of
the spot where his buckskin had shied from the trail two days before.</p>

<p>Dismounting, he took off his coat and draping it over the horse's neck
said: "Now you're anchored, Patsy &mdash; stand steady."</p>

<p>Then he unbuckled the snaffle bit and rein from the bridle and wound
the rein about his waist. Carney knew that the horse, not hampered by a
dangling rein to catch in his legs or be seized by a man, would protect
himself. No man but Carney could saddle the buckskin or mount him unless
he was roped or thrown; and his hind feet were as deft as the fists of a
boxer.</p>

<p>Then he moved steadily along the trail, finding here and there the
imprint of moccasined feet that had passed over the trail since he had.
There were the fresh pugs of two wolves, the dog-wolf's paws
enormous.</p>

<p>Carney's idea was to examine closely the trail that ran by the cliff
to where his horse had shied from the path in the hope of finding perhaps
the evidences of struggle, patches of blood soaked into the brown earth,
and then pass on to where he could command a view of the cave mouth. If
the murderer had his habitat there he would be almost certain to show
himself at that hour, either returning from up the trail where he might
have been on the lookout for approaching victims, or to issue from the
cave for water or firewood for his evening meal. Just what he should do
Carney had not quite determined. First he would stalk the man in hopes of
finding out something that was conclusive.</p>

<p>If the murderer were hiding in the cave the gold would almost
certainly be there.</p>

<p>That was the order of events, so to speak, when Carney, hand on gun,
and eyes fixed ahead on the trail, came to the spot where the wolf had
stood at bay. The trail took a twist, a projecting rock bellied it into a
little turn, and a fallen birch lay across it, half smothered in a lake
of leaves and brush.</p>

<p>As Carney stepped over the birch there was a crashing clamp of iron,
and the powerful jaws of a bear trap closed on his leg with such numbing
force that he almost went out. His brain swirled; there were roaring
noises in his head, an excruciating grind on his leg.</p>

<p>His senses steadying, his first cogent thought was that the bone was
smashed; but a limb of the birch, caught in the jaws, squelched to
splinters, had saved the bone; this and his breeches and heavy socks in
the legs of his strong riding boots.</p>

<p>As if the snapping steel had carried down the valley, the evening
stillness was rent by the yelping howl of a wolf beyond where the cave
hung on the hillside. There was something demoniac in this, suggesting to
the half-dazed man that the wolf stood as sentry.</p>

<p>The utter helplessness of his position came to him with full force; he
could no more open the jaws of that double-springed trap than he could
crash the door of a safe. And a glance showed him that the trap was
fastened by a chain at either end to stout-growing trees. It was a
man-trap; if it had been for a bear it would be fastened to a piece of
loose log.</p>

<p>The fiendish deviltry of the man who had set it was evident. The whole
vile scheme flashed upon Carney; it was set where the trail narrowed
before it wound down to the gorge, and the man caught in it could be
killed by a club, or left to be devoured by the wolves. A pistol might
protect him for a little short time against the wolves, but that even
could be easily wheedled out of a man caught by the murderer coming with
a pretense of helping him.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice fell on Carney's ear:</p>

<p>"Throw your gun out on the trail in front of you! I've got you
covered, Bulldog, and you haven't got a chance on earth."</p>

<p>Now Carney could make out a pistol, a man's head, and a crooked arm
projecting from beside a tree twenty yards along the trail.</p>

<p>"Throw out the gun, and I'll parley with your" the voice added.</p>

<p>Carney recognized the voice as that of Jack the Wolf, and he knew that
the offered parley was only a blind, a trick to get his gun away so that
he would be a quick victim for the wolves; that would save a shooting.
Sometimes an imbedded bullet told the absolute tale of murder.</p>

<p>"There's nothing doing in that line, Jack the Wolf," Carney answered;
"you can shoot and be damned to you! I'd rather die that way than be torn
to pieces by the wolves."</p>

<p>Jack the Wolf seemed to debate this matter behind the tree; then he
said: "It's your own fault if you get into my bear trap, Bulldog; I ain't
invited you in. I've been watchin' you for the last hour, and I've been
a-wonderin' just what your little game was. Me and you ain't good 'nough
friends for me to step up there to help you out, and you got a gun on
you. You throw it out and I'll parley. If you'll agree to certain things,
I'll spring that trap, and you can ride away, 'cause I guess you'll keep
your word. I don't want to kill nobody, I don't."</p>

<p>The argument was specious. If Carney had not known Jack the Wolf as
absolutely bloodthirsty, he might have taken a chance and thrown the
gun.</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well, Jack the Wolf, that if you came to help me
out, and I shot you, I'd be committing suicide, so you're lying."</p>

<p>"You mean you won't give up the gun?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, keep it, damn you! Them wolves knows a thing or two. One of 'em
knows pretty near as much about guns as you do. They'll just sit off
there in the dark and laugh at you till you drop; then you'll never wake
up. You think it over, Bulldog, I'm &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The speaker's voice was drowned by the howl of the wolf a short
distance down the valley.</p>

<p>"D'you hear him, Bulldog?" Jack queried when the howls had died down.
"They get your number on the wind and they're sayin' you're their meat.
You think over my proposition while I go down and gather in your
buckskin; he looks good to me for a get-away. You let me know when I come
back what you'll do, 'cause 'em wolves is in a hurry &mdash; they're
hungry; and I guess your leg ain't none too comf'table."</p>

<p>Then there was silence, and Carney knew that Jack the Wolf was
circling through the bush to where his horse stood, keeping out of range
as he travelled.</p>

<p>Carney knew that the buckskin would put up a fight; his instinct would
tell him that Jack the Wolf was evil. The howling wolf would also have
raised the horse's mettle; but he himself was in the awkward position of
being a loser, whether man or horse won.</p>

<p>From where he was trapped the buckskin was in view. Carney saw his
head go up, the lop ears throw forward in rigid listening, and he could
see, beyond, off to the right, the skulking form of Jack slipping from
tree to tree so as to keep the buckskin between him and Carney.</p>

<p>Now the horse turned his arched neck and snorted. Carney whipped out
his gun, a double purpose in his mind. If Jack the Wolf offered a fair
mark he would try a shot, though at a hundred and fifty yards it would be
a chance; and he must harbor his cartridges for the wolves; the second
purpose was that the shot would rouse the buckskin with a knowledge that
there was a battle on.</p>

<p>Jack the Wolf came to the trail beyond the horse and was now slowly
approaching, speaking in coaxing terms. The horse, warily alert, was
shaking his head; then he pawed at the earth like an angry bull.</p>

<p>Ten yards from the horse Jack stood still, his eye noticing that the
bridle rein and bit were missing. Carney saw him uncoil from his waist an
ordinary packing rope; it was not a lariat, being short. With this in a
hand held behind his back, Jack, with short steps, moved slowly toward
the buckskin, trying to soothe the wary animal with soft speech.</p>

<p>Ten feet from the horse he stood again, and Carney knew what that
meant &mdash; a little quick dash in to twist the rope about the horse's
head, or seize him by the nostrils. Also the buckskin knew. He turned his
rump to the man, threw back his ears, and lashed out with his hind feet
as a warning to the horse thief. The coat had slipped from his neck to
the ground.</p>

<p>Jack the Wolf tried circling tactics, trying to gentle the horse into
a sense of security with soothing words. Once, thinking he had a chance,
he sprang for the horse's head, only to escape those lightning heels by
the narrowest margin; at that instant Carney fired, but his bullet
missed, and Jack, startled, stood back, planning sulkily.</p>

<p>Carney saw him thread out his rope with the noose end in his right
hand, and circle again. Then the hand with a half-circle sent the loop
swishing through the air, and at the first cast it went over the
buckskin's head.</p>

<p>Carney had been waiting for this. He whistled shrilly the signal that
always brought the buckskin to his side.</p>

<p>Jack had started to work his way up the rope, hand over hand, but at
the well-known signal the horse whirled, the rope slipped through Jack's
sweaty hands, a loop of it caught his leg, and he was thrown. The
buckskin, strung to a high nervous tension, answered his master's signal
at a gallop, and the rope, fastened to Jack's waist, dragged him as
though he hung from a runaway horse with a foot in the stirrup. His body
struck rocks, trees, roots; it jiggered about on the rough earth like a
cork, for the noose had slipped back to the buckskin's shoulders.</p>

<p>Just as the horse reached Carney, Jack the Wolf's two legs straddled a
slim tree and the body wedged there. Carney snapped his fingers, but as
the horse stepped forward the rope tightened, the body was fast.</p>

<p>"Damned if I want to tear the cuss to pieces, Patsy," he said, drawing
forth his pocket knife. He just managed by reaching out with his long
arm, to cut the rope, and the horse thrust his velvet muzzle against his
master's cheek, as if he would say, "Now, old pal, we're all right
&mdash; don't worry."</p>

<p>Bulldog understood the reassurance and, patting the broad wise
forehead, answered: "We can play the wolves together, Pat &mdash; I'm
glad you're here. It's a hundred to one on us yet." Then a half-smothered
oath startled the horse, for, at a twist, a shoot of agony raced along
the vibrant nerves to Carney's brain.</p>

<p>In the subsidence of strife Carney was cognizant of the night shadows
that had crept along the valley; it would soon be dark. Perhaps he could
build a little fire; it would keep the wolves at bay, for in the darkness
they would come; it would give him a circle of light, and a target when
the light fell on their snarling faces.</p>

<p>Bending gingerly down he found in the big bed of leaves a network of
dead branches that Jack the Wolf had cunningly placed there to hold the
leaves. There was within reach on the dead birch some of its silver
parchment-like bark. With his cowboy hat he brushed the leaves away from
about his limbs, then taking off his belt he lowered himself gingerly to
his free knee and built a little mound of sticks and bark against the
birch log. Then he put his hand in a pocket for matches &mdash; every
pocket; he had not one match; they were in his coat lying down somewhere
on the trail. He looked longingly at the body lying wedged against the
tree; Jack would have matches, for no man travelled the wilds without the
means to a fire. But matches in New York were about as accessible as any
that might be in the dead man's pockets.</p>

<p>Philosophic thought with one leg in a bear trap is practically
impossible, and Carney's arraignment of tantalizing Fate was inelegant.
As if Fate resented this, Fate, or something, cast into the trapped man's
mind a magical inspiration &mdash; a vital grievance. His mind, acute
because of his dilemna and pain, must have wandered far ahead of his
cognizance, for a sane plan of escape lay evident. If he had a fire he
could heat the steel springs of that trap. The leaves of the spring were
thin, depending upon that elusive quality, the steel's temper, for
strength. If he could heat the steel, even to a dull red, the temper
would leave it as a spirit forsakes a body, and the spring would bend
like cardboard.</p>

<p>"And I haven't got a damn match," Carney wailed. Then he looked at the
body. "But you've got them &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He grasped the buckskin's headpiece and drew him forward a pace; then
he unslung his picket line and made a throw for Jack the Wolf's head. If
he could yank the body around, the wedged legs would clear.</p>

<p>Throwing a lariat at a man lying groggily flat, with one of the
thrower's legs in a bear trap, was a new one on Carney &mdash; It was
some test.</p>

<p>Once he muttered grimly, from between set teeth: "If my leg holds out
I'll get him yet, Patsy."</p>

<p>Then he threw the lariat again, only to drag the noose hopelessly off
the head that seemed glued to the ground, the dim light blurring form and
earth into a shadow from which thrust, indistinctly, the pale face that
carried a crimson mark from forehead to chin.</p>

<p>He had made a dozen casts, all futile, the noose sometimes catching
slightly at the shaggy head, even causing it to roll weirdly, as if the
man were not dead but dodging the rope. As Carney slid the noose from his
hand to float gracefully out toward the body his eye caught the dim form
of the dog-wolf, just beyond, his slobbering jaws parted, giving him the
grinning aspect of a laughing hyena. Carney snatched the rope and dropped
his hand to his gun, but the wolf was quicker than the man &mdash; he was
gone. A curious thing had happened, though, for that erratic twist of the
rope had spiraled the noose beneath Jack the Wolf's chin, and gently,
vibratingly tightening the slip, Carney found it hold. Then, hand over
hand, he hauled the body to the birch log, and, without ceremony,
searched it for matches. He found them, wrapped in an oilskin in a pocket
of Jack's shirt. He noticed, casually, that Jack's gun had been torn from
its belt during the owner's rough voyage.</p>

<p>The finding of the matches was like an anesthetic to the agony of the
clamp on his leg. He chuckled, saying, "Patsy, it's a million to one on
us; they can't beat us, old pard."</p>

<p>He transferred his faggots and birch bark to the loops of the springs,
one pile at either end of the trap, and touched a match to them.</p>

<p>The acrid smoke almost stilled him; sparks burnt his hands, and his
wrists, and his face; the jaws of the trap commenced to catch the heat as
it travelled along the conducting steel, and he was threatened with the
fact that he might burn his leg off. With his knife he dug up the black
moist earth beneath the leaves, and dribbled it on to the heating
jaws.</p>

<p>Carney was so intent on his manifold duties that he had practically
forgotten Jack the Wolf; but as he turned his face from an inspection of
a spring that was reddening, he saw a pair of black vicious eyes watching
him, and a hand reaching for his gun belt that lay across the birch
log.</p>

<p>The hands of both men grasped the belt at the same moment, and a
terrible struggle ensued. Carney was handicapped by the trap, which
seemed to bite into his leg as if it were one of the wolves fighting
Jack's battle; and Jack the Wolf showed, by his vain efforts to rise,
that his legs had been made almost useless in that drag by the horse.</p>

<p>Carney had in one hand a stout stick with which he had been adjusting
his fire, and he brought this down on the other's wrist, almost
shattering the bone. With a cry of pain Jack the Wolf released his grasp
of the belt, and Carney, pulling the gun, covered him, saying:</p>

<p>"Hoped you were dead, Jack the Murderer! Now turn face down on this
log, with your hands behind your back, till I hobble you."</p>

<p>"I can spring that trap with a lever and let you out," Jack
offered.</p>

<p>"Don't need you &mdash; I'm going to see you hanged and don't want to
be under any obligation to you, murderer; turn over quick or I'll kill
you now &mdash; my leg is on fire."</p>

<p>Jack the Wolf knew that a man with a bear trap on his leg and a gun in
his hand was not a man to trifle with, so he obeyed.</p>

<p>When Jack's wrists were tied with the picket line, Carney took a loop
about the prisoner's legs; then he turned to his fires.</p>

<p>The struggle had turned the steel springs from the fires; but in the
twisting one of them had been bent so that its ring had slipped down from
the jaws. Now Carney heaped both fires under the other spring and soon it
was so hot that, when balancing his weight on the leg in the trap, he
placed his other foot on it and shifted his weight, the strip of steel
went down like paper. He was free.</p>

<p>At first Carney could not bear his weight on the mangled leg; it felt
as if it had been asleep for ages; the blood rushing through the released
veins pricked like a tatooing needle. He took off his boot and massaged
the limb, Jack eyeing this proceeding sardonically. The two wolves
hovered beyond the firelight, snuffling and yapping.</p>

<p>When he could hobble on the injured limb Carney put the bit and bridle
rein back on the buckskin, and turning to Jack, unwound the picket line
from his legs, saying, "Get up and lead the way to that cave!"</p>

<p>"I can't walk, Bulldog," Jack protested; my leg's half broke."</p>

<p>"Take your choice &mdash; get on your legs, or I'll tie you up and
leave you for the wolves," Carney snapped.</p>

<p>Jack the Wolf knew his Bulldog Carney well. As he rose groggily to his
feet, Carney lifted to the saddle, holding the loose end of the picket
line that was fastened to Jack's wrists, and said:</p>

<p>"Go on in front; if you try any tricks I'll put a bullet through you
&mdash; this sore leg's got me peeved."</p>

<p>At the cave Carney found, as he expected, several little canvas bags
of gold, and other odds and ends such as a murderer too often, and also
foolishly, will garner from his victims. But he also found something he
had not expected to find &mdash; the cayuse that had belonged to
Fourteen-foot Johnson, for Jack the Wolf had preserved the cayuse to pack
out his wealth.</p>

<p>Next morning, no chance of action having come to Jack the Wolf through
the night, for he had lain tied up, like a turkey that is to be roasted,
he started on the pilgrimage to Bucking Horse, astride Fourteen-foot
Johnson's cayuse, with both feet tied beneath that sombre animal's belly.
Carney landed him and the gold in that astonished berg.</p>

<p>And in the fullness of time something very serious happened to the
enterprising man of the bear trap.</p>
