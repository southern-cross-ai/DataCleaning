<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>TRADE</h2>

<p>Ajidamo, the Squirrel, pushed his way through the undergrowth.
He had been walking thus, silently and observantly, for hours,
while he made the round of his traps. Like a brown ghost he came,
guided by a broken twig here, an overturned leaf there, and other
signs so faint as to be imperceptible save to the eye of an
aborigine. It was mid-afternoon when he reached a ridge where most
of the rock was bare and the forest pushed up close on either side.
Close to the ridge, in a clump of ground hemlock, was a stream on
whose banks the snow still lay a few inches deep. Beside the stream
glinted a small steel trap. In the trap was a mink with
russet-brown fur.</p>

<p>Ajidamo grunted complacently, opened the spring, dropped his
quarry into a sack, where it nestled softly against an otter and a
stone marten, then took his way silently along the ridge. He did
not hurry. The day was fine, and he was at home wherever sunset
might overtake him.</p>

<p>Three hundred yards farther on lay a young Norway pine
overthrown by winter winds. Its black roots lifted grotesquely into
the air and carried patches of earth and moss. In one of these
tangles Ajidamo noticed a piece of rock different from any he had
ever seen. It was strongly gripped, as though in a man's hand, and
the level rays of the sun seemed to pass through it. He looked at
it curiously. To the ordinary observer it would have resembled a
bit of semi-transparent alabaster enclosing a twist of gilded lace.
To a milling man it would have been a sample of high-grade,
free-milling gold ore. But to Ajidamo it was only something
different. And just for that reason he knocked it free, examined it
closely with unwinking black eyes, and dropped it in beside the
stone marten.</p>

<p>He tramped on, slept that night five miles away, continued his
silent pilgrimage another twenty miles, and reached his winter camp
at sundown. Here he thawed out his take, pulled the precious skins
inside out over the slim red bodies, threw the bodies into the pot,
and stretched the fur over thin, wedge-shaped pieces of wood. He
thought nothing more about the piece of rock, till presently the
oldest grandchild, rummaging in the sack with reddened fingers,
pulled the thing out. Ajidamo took it, held it questioningly toward
his daughter, and, when she shook her head, tossed the fragment
carelessly back.</p>

<p>Storms raged and ceased, snow fell and melted, the sun grew
stronger, water began to run over the rocks, the wilderness seemed
to yawn luxuriously in the growing warmth after months of rigid
slumber, and presently spring came to the Northern wilderness.
There was a slackening of the bones of earth, the whiteness of
rabbit-fur became patched with dirty brown, from the skies drifted
the calling of geese and swans on the long trek to the Arctic,
while a thousand streams burst their manacles and went singing
through the woods. It was at this time that Ajidamo gathered
together his winter's catch. Then he lifted his canoe from the
place where it had lain covered with spruce boughs since last
November, sewed up its gaping seams with fine strips of tamarac
root, sealed them with cloth dipped in hot resin, and went off to
the nearest Hudson Bay post, which was a hundred miles away, as
quietly as a dry leaf moves in front of a puff of wind.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Hudson Bay factor is a taciturn man, clothed generally in
nondescript garments and always with a great authority. His word
goes forth as the law of the Northern wilderness, because it has
never been broken. To Ojibway and Iroquois, to Yellowknife and
Cree, to Piegan and Blackfoot, that word is the same. When it comes
to a matter of trade, the bargain is hard and the terms are stiff,
but the faith is absolute. So it happens that in a season of the
year the hunters turn from the smoke of a thousand camp-fires and
push their canoes over leagues of water, black and brown, by lake
and rapid and cataract, to do business as their fathers did and
with the offspring of those who traded with their fathers.</p>

<p>Thus came Ajidamo to the post on Crooked Lake. He came at his
own pace, a leisurely twenty miles a day, his eyes active on the
journey, for when one lives by eye and ear and the strength of
one's sinews, there is much to be learned be one ever so old, and
Ajidamo was only seventy. He caught a few fish, mostly in the
rapids, where pickerel were to be had for the taking, snared a few
rabbits, drank a good deal of tea, and smoked incessantly. In the
bottom of the canoe, tied neatly in the sack, were mink, otter,
marten, a few fisher skins and one cross fox. He hoped for a good
deal from the latter.</p>

<p>Nearing the post, he fell in with others on the same errand.
Some he knew personally, such as Wa-wa, the Wild Goose, and
Ah-tick, the Caribou, but they did not talk much, making camp the
last night a little way apart on the river's bank, so that their
fires blinked like a succession of the red eyes of animals that
came down in the dark to drink when drinking could be done safely.
Nor was there any hustling for bargains when the post was reached,
it being common knowledge that prices did not vary. Each of them
came up in turn, emptied his catch on the rough-hewn counter, and
waited voicelessly till the factor had checked the number of skins
and formed his own opinion of their condition and value. And while
he waited, there was a swift, narrow-eyed scrutiny of the loaded
shelves, bulging with all that the heart of man, woman or child
could desire. Not the least thing to the credit of Ajidamo and his
friends was the fact that no Hudson Bay post reported losses by
theft.</p>

<p>When it came to Ajidamo's turn, he up-ended his sack, and with
the fur there tumbled out that forgotten fragment of rock. It fell
to the floor, lying unnoticed till the bargaining was done. Ajidamo
owed fifty dollars from Last year, and when this had been
liquidated he still found himself able to get most of the things he
wanted&mdash;cloth, a red shawl for his daughter, powder for
recharging Winchester cartridges, lead, three new traps, a
four-pound axe-head, a net with four-inch mesh for white-fish, a
slab of salt pork, tea, sugar, baking-powder. These he collected,
making a neat pile that rose beside him. The factor put in a pound
of tobacco as a present, then leaned forward.</p>

<p>"What's yon bit of rock?"</p>

<p>Ajidamo gave it to him and shook his head. "I don't know. Maybe
no good."</p>

<p>The factor twisted it between his hard fingers. "Where did it
come from?"</p>

<p>Ajidamo made a gesture that took in the entire country lying
north of Crooked Lake. "Up there. Long way. Me find him two months
gone&mdash;I guess no good."</p>

<p>Followed a little silence. There were rumours of gold in the
district, talks of gold around a good many camp-fires, and a
trickle of prospectors from the area farther south. The factor had
a month-old paper that came in by dog team the week before, and
there was an article in that. He didn't take it very seriously.
This was a good fur country, and that ought to be enough for him,
and he didn't know anything about minerals. But one could never
tell. He turned the thing round so that the light fell into it, and
thought it very pretty.</p>

<p>"Want it?" he asked Ajidamo.</p>

<p>The old hunter shook his head. "Me think no good." he said, and
gathered up his purchases.</p>

<hr>

<p>Kelly was plainly out of luck. He lay on his back in his tent,
slapped at mosquitoes and cursed creation in general. For a year
now he had been scratching rock to no purpose. Other men had made
good strikes, cleaned up a pile, and had either got out of the
country or else done the same thing over again. But on the Abitibi
River the Irish seemed to have lost their luck.</p>

<p>Added to this was the sobering fact that he was nearly broke.
The small sum of forty dollars separated him from that bankruptcy
which meant that he would have to work for someone else, a fate
that all real prospectors dread. To get up in the morning and feel
that you couldn't go where you wanted to go was something worse
than death. It stared Kelly in the face now. If one adds to this
the further truth that he was nearly out of grub, the venom of his
language will be the more understandable.</p>

<p>He lighted a pitch-pine knot, took a torn map from his packsack
and studied it intently. It was thumbed and mutilated beyond
repair, but still decipherable. In the flicker, and between slaps
at the mosquitoes, which were now worse than before, he saw that
the post of Crooked Lake lay about two days' journey off. H B P,
the map said, from which Kelly knew that there was to be obtained
there all that made life feasible in the wilderness. He reckoned
that the district was no good, never had been and never would be
any good, but, because he was in the middle of it, decided to give
it just one more chance. So at daybreak he started off, making a
bee-line for Crooked Lake, and wondering what the Scotchman, who
was bound to be in charge, would have the nerve to ask for a
fifty-pound sack of self-rising flour. He arrived on the eve of the
second day in a worse temper than ever. Mackintosh looked in his
angry eye and waited placidly. He was a man of experience.</p>

<p>"'Twill be ten cents a pound, cash," he said easily.</p>

<p>Kelly gulped. "It's a hold-up&mdash;three cents a pound in
Toronto."</p>

<p>"Ye're no forced to buy it if ye dinna want it," said
Mackintosh.</p>

<p>"You know I've got to buy it, but it's a whale of a price."</p>

<p>"Maybe. I'm not disputin' that, but it didn't exactly fly here,
ye ken."</p>

<p>"Can I have twenty dollars credit?"</p>

<p>Mackintosh shook his head. "If ye were an Indian; but I'll no
trust a white man in this country." He paused a moment. "Happen
ye're not a squaw man? That might help."</p>

<p>This left Kelly breathless, and he rocked with anger. "Think I'd
marry an Indian?" he hissed.</p>

<p>"Ye might do a sight waur," said Mackintosh calmly. "I've
married ane mysel'. D'ye want that flour?"</p>

<p>Kelly swallowed his wrath and bought. With the flour were other
things, and while the factor sorted them out his visitor's eye fell
on a fragment of rock that glinted whitely on a corner shelf.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he said, pointing.</p>

<p>"Naethin' but a bit that ane of ma customers left here last
winter. D'ye ken what it is?"</p>

<p>Kelly fingered the thing, and his pulse began to pound. Never in
his dreams had he seen a specimen like this. A thousand dollars to
the ton if it was worth a cent.</p>

<p>"Careful," he whispered to himself, "careful now!" and laid it
casually back on the counter.</p>

<p>"It might be worth following up. Where does the Indian live?
I'll drop in if I'm in that direction."</p>

<p>"I'm no sure where he is the noo, but he wintered on Loon Lake.
That's a hundred mile from here."</p>

<p>"What's he call himself?" Kelly's voice creaked a little.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ajidamo sat in the sun, making a new cedar paddle which would be
as light as a feather. One end of it was against his stomach, and
he drew the knife toward him with long, smooth strokes, while the
shavings fell away in neat, regular curls. Presently he saw a
distant flicker on the glassy water. There was a white man
coming.</p>

<p>Kelly floated up half an hour later, laid his own paddle across
the thwarts, leaned forward and lit his pipe.</p>

<p>"BOOZHOO," he said.</p>

<p>"BOOZHOO," replied Ajidamo. "MENO KEEJEGUD."</p>

<p>Kelly admitted that it was a fine day, took another look at the
camp, and came ashore. He had given a good deal of thought to this
interview. When one dealt with an Indian, the thing was not to be
too earnest or impetuous. It made the other fellow suspicious. One
led up to what one wanted, then touched on it casually in passing.
So he, too, lay in the sun and talked generalities of the
wilderness, while the paddle took shape under Ajidamo's firm brown
fingers. It was not till evening that he got round to the
subject.</p>

<p>"Much rock about here?"</p>

<p>The old man waved a hand at the purple horizon. "Plenty
rock&mdash;some places." He knew what Kelly sought before the canoe
touched shore, and Kelly knew that he knew. But that didn't alter
anything.</p>

<p>"Much fur last winter?"</p>

<p>"Some," said Ajidamo, and put a kettle on the fire.</p>

<p>"Smoke?" Kelly tossed over a plug of tobacco.</p>

<p>The ancient aristocrat nodded, filled his pipe, and relapsed
into silence. He wasn't interested, or even amused. He ripped up
the belly of a five-pound pickerel, carved out its backbone with
two swift strokes, and laid it in the pan. Kelly contributed a lump
of salt pork. The meal was shared without speech. Kelly glanced at
the grave, aquiline face and felt like choking, but it was no use
trying to rustle a man for whom time and space and riches nd the
world in general did not exist. Still, there remained the
outrageous fact that this relic of a vanishing race possessed
knowledge that was worth a barrel of money. He decided to wait a
little longer.</p>

<p>An hour before sunset he unrolled his blankets, and there fell
out a piece of white quartz. He pitched it across to Ajidamo.</p>

<p>"Ever see any rock Like that?"</p>

<p>Ajidamo fingered it, and knew at once all about it&mdash;the
upturned Norway pine, earth and moss in its roots, and this
glistening in the sun. So that was what had brought the stranger.
He rather liked Kelly, because the latter hadn't jumped down his
throat, bombarding him with questions. There was a way of doing
everything&mdash;even talking about rocks.</p>

<p>"Over there," he said, pointing west. "Me see him last
spring."</p>

<p>"Far?"</p>

<p>"Two days."</p>

<p>Kelly laid a hot coal in the bowl of his pipe just to make sure
of his nerves. They were quite steady,.</p>

<p>"How much&mdash;go there?"</p>

<p>Ajidamo considered this patiently. He usually asked two dollars
and a half a day for what little work he had ever done, and he
never got anything for the return trip, because one place was the
same as another as far as he was concerned. But this time, and
since something assured him that Kelly was very much in earnest, he
decided to take a chance and double the charge.</p>

<p>"Ten dollars," he said.</p>

<p>Kelly shook his head. "Too much. Give you five."</p>

<hr>

<p>Paterson had a combined office and residence, a wooden structure
twelve by twenty-four, on the outskirts of the town of Porcupine.
Over the door was a large sign: "Mines and Mining Shares Bought and
Sold." He lived in the other end&mdash;-twelve by twelve. In the
office were shelves carrying samples of ore from various
properties. The sight of them was apt to impress a client, and
helped to keep up his enthusiasm, for he had never bought a share
or sold a mine. His capital was five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>He was lounging about in front when Kelly came up the road,
staggering under a packsack which, though it was only half filled,
seemed extremely heavy. He dropped it opposite the office for a
rest, and Paterson caught the grinding creak of broken rock. He
strolled over and offered the stranger a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Got anything?"</p>

<p>Kelly glanced at the broad, red, good-natured face and rather
liked it.</p>

<p>"I've got the original horned mint," he said. "What have you
got?"</p>

<p>"A few thousand dollars. What's your hurry?"</p>

<p>Kelly brightened, then hesitated. "What do you call a few?"</p>

<p>"Enough to buy the real thing when I see it."</p>

<p>Kelly went in. Paterson talked about mines in general and it was
some time before they got round to the packsack. Neither wanted to
seem in a hurry, and Paterson played the same role as Kelly when
the latter did diplomatic work in the camp of Ajidamo. The scale of
intelligence ascended.</p>

<p>The up-ended packsack disgorged its burden. Gold, and lots of
it&mdash;gold in little filaments and plates and grains, frozen,
seemingly, in the milky quartz. Paterson had seen nothing like this
before.</p>

<p>"Not so bad," he said evenly. "where is it?"</p>

<p>Kelly laughed at him. "Nothing doing, pilgrim. I'm no free
information bureau."</p>

<p>Paterson passed on undisturbed. He didn't expect to be told yet,
but it was worth trying.</p>

<p>"Much of it?"</p>

<p>That was horse sense, and Kelly loosened up.</p>

<p>"She's about eight hundred feet long and seven wide. I stripped
her in seven places&mdash;all about the same. Some of it's richer
than this, and some not so good. Can you beat it?"</p>

<p>Paterson had a lump in his throat. "Far from the water?"</p>

<p>"About a quarter-mile."</p>

<p>"Hard to get at?"</p>

<p>"Easy as breathing."</p>

<p>"Cut loose, stranger. What's your name and your price?"</p>

<p>Kelly leaned back luxuriously. He had been thinking about the
price ever since Ajidamo led him up to the overturned Norway pine,
and he actually saw the thing he had dreamed of for years. The
figure had varied a good deal on the way out, but never got any
smaller. In the glow of the present moment he decided to take a
chance and double it.</p>

<p>"I want ten thousand down, twenty in three months, and another
twenty in six."</p>

<p>"Give you half that, and it's a deal," said Paterson.</p>

<hr>

<p>James Randolph, of New York, sat at a corner table in the
dining-room of the Porcupine Hotel. He was a quiet man, very
silent, and had a keen grey eye. There was nothing conspicuous
about Randolph, nothing to betray the fact that he was a noted
geologist; nothing to suggest that he represented enough money to
buy the entire township and all in it twice over. He ate slowly and
without interest, glancing occasionally at the very mixed
assemblage. It was nothing unusual to him.</p>

<p>Two strangers came in and annexed the adjoining table, one
large, red-faced, and of the type recognisable as "mining broker",
the other evidently just out of the woods. They were not drunk, but
very cheerful, and Randolph wondered where they got it. One ate
peas with his knife, very neatly and without spilling any, while
the other, apparently not hungry, ranged a row of quartz specimens
in front of his plate. Randolph noted these, and forgot about their
owner. Ten minutes later he strolled out, took a chair on the
verandah near the dining-room door and began to smoke
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Eight hundred long, seven wide, and pans heavy all the way.
She's the original nickel-plated mint, pilgrim, and you ought to be
tickled down the back." The words came quite clearly.</p>

<p>Presently the large man appeared and struck off down the road.
Randolph pitched away his cigarette and paced slowly in that
direction.</p>

<p>At two o'clock Paterson had the thing pretty well thought out.
He proposed to make his pile out of this one deal, as it was not
likely anything of the same sort would come his way again. He had
to find another twenty thousand in six months, so a fair price
would be a hundred thousand in five. He was gloating over the
samples when a stranger chanced in and asked the way to the
Lockmaster Mine.</p>

<p>The latter got the information and was about to walk on, when he
glanced casually at the specimens on Paterson's table.</p>

<p>"That looks to be pretty good stuff."</p>

<p>Paterson surmised that it was, the best stuff that ever came out
of the darned district, and, what's more, he owned it.</p>

<p>"Whereabouts?" asked the stranger.</p>

<p>Paterson grinned. "That exact information comes after a deal and
not before it."</p>

<p>"Far from here?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;easy as breathing"</p>

<p>"You in the mining business?"</p>

<p>"In a sort of way. Friends of mine might put some money in. But
I'm told there's been a lot lost up here."</p>

<p>Paterson chuckled. "'Tain't lost if you know where it is."</p>

<p>Randolph didn't answer. He was wondering how much the other man
knew\ about mines and mining.</p>

<p>"Is this much of a vein you've got?"</p>

<p>The figures came out, and he looked up rather wistfully.</p>

<p>"It's this way with me. I'm free to buy something for my friends
to develop. That stuff seems to have gold in it, and in a general
way I'm ready for a gamble. What's your price?"</p>

<p>Paterson told him, but he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Figure's too big for me. Doesn't matter. I'm going on to the
silver country to-morrow, and just came over here for a look. I've
real money to spend, but not as much as that. Must keep something
for development." He got up, smiling.</p>

<p>Paterson reflected. He'd rather like to say he'd bought a lode
and sold it in four hours. And perhaps the late vendor was a bit of
a liar.</p>

<p>"Suppose you made an offer?"</p>

<p>"My limit is just half your price, and you'd have to show me the
lode before you got the cheque."</p>

<p>"Just as the other fellow has to show me before he gets his,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Shake on it," said Paterson.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ajidamo had heard it all afternoon, a low, constant rumble that
sounded like distant thunder, but was always in the same place. It
grew louder as he paddled, till, rounding the point, he saw ahead a
great gash in the wooded slope of the land. It was now something
more than eighteen months since he had been here last, and then he
came to show a stranger the spot where a young Norway pine lay with
its roots in the air.</p>

<p>He stopped paddling a quarter-mile from shore, and drifted
motionless while comprehension slowly deepened in his dark eyes. Up
the hill, and just at the spot he remembered, was a tall timber
thing on top of which was a wheel that went round very fast. Below
this descended a nest of great buildings. On one side houses, the
only kind of house he had ever seen, with a white road running
between them. There were a dock, two or three launches, scows, men
sprinkled everywhere, long piles of wood, and always that queer
rumble. Close to the water he saw a log shanty he took to be the
store. At that he dipped his paddle, and the canoe moved as does a
thought in the mind of a lazy man.</p>

<p>He got out on a strip of sand that wasn't there before. Sharp
and very white, it was being carried down by a trough from the
lowest and biggest building of all. He had never seen sand like
that before. Ajidamo could not know that the ore from which it was
crushed had lain three hundred feet below the roots of the Norway
pine. He could not know that the Broadvenue Mine&mdash;thus
christened because its owners did business in a marble-lined eyrie
near the corner of the two most famous streets of a very famous
city&mdash;had repaid half its purchase price in the first month's
run. He could not know what happened to Kelly, or Paterson, or any
of them, nor would he have cared. What he did know was that his
share of all this was five dollars. And at that he grunted
softly.</p>

<p>The storekeeper at the Broadvenue was not versed in the ways of
the country, also he knew nothing and cared nothing about Indians.
So when Ajidamo came in on moccasined feet and, unwrapping four
silver dollars from a bit of caribou skin, asked for flour, he got
much less than he should have had. This time the price was doubled,
not halved. Nor was he given a plug of tobacco, which was gross
discourtesy as well as a tactical error, and in general he received
such treatment as no Hudson Bay factor would have dreamed of
extending to a member of the most ancient family of the land.</p>

<p>"Is that all you want?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ajidamo.</p>

<p>"Then clear out, and take this. Don't eat it&mdash;-it's to wash
with. You need it."</p>

<p>Ajidamo looked at him, but did not touch the soap. The young
man, knowing Third Avenue, thought he knew everything, but did not
understand that look. There was dignity in it, and a silent pride
born of thousands of years of freedom, and a sort of vague wonder.
The aged hunter had become used to something different, and a
certain mutual civility, and prices that, if hard, were at least
stable. So he felt that this change, and these bad manners, and the
rumble that shook the earth, and this short measure, were in a way
all his own fault. Furthermore, everyone seemed to be doing well in
this matter except himself. He picked up the flour and went slowly
out.</p>

<p>Halting on the white sand, he took a piece of quartz from his
pocket. It was about the same size as the first one, but infinitely
richer, and nearly half gold. He had found it three months
previously in a spot only a day's journey distant, but in such a
corner that it was very unlikely to be found again. The last piece
had earned five dollars, and he had hoped that this one would bring
him as much. Perhaps it was worth ten.</p>

<p>He turned it over in his smooth, callous palm for a moment, then
pitched it into the lake.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>THE EYES OF SEBASTION</h2>

<p>This is a tale of the big timber that grows in league-long
patches where the headwaters of the Saguenay find their birth
amongst tumbled foothills of the Laurentian range. Thence flows the
Saguenay, a chill and formidable stream, gathering volume as it
moves southward with countless tributaries from unknown lakes and
moose-trampled marshes, loitering on its way through stretches of
cedar-bordered solitude, flinging itself headlong over cataracts
where the tawny water rages thunderously day and night, ever more
deep, forbidding and austere, till at last it merges majestically
with the great St. Lawrence, the mother of many rivers, and spends
itself between the thousand-foot crags of Capes Trinity and
Eternity.</p>

<p>All along the Saguenay it is a French country, as French as when
two hundred years ago the peasants of Brittany and Normandy first
fared northward into the unexplored wilderness. Amid the big timber
and beside untamed waters they raised their log-hewn walls, with
the mud-chinked joints, the tiny deep set windows and the massive
roofs that must bear the weight of winter snows. Out of the forest
they carved their farms, planting grain between the unconquerable
roots, drawing sustenance from wood and stream, beating off
marauding Indians, gathering in the long winter evenings round
pine-heaped hearths, utterly alone save when in summer the yellow
bows of a canoe glided round a point, and a missionary Jesuit
Father landed from Quebec; or when in winter the man of God
tramped, solitary, through endless miles of big timber on his
errand of mercy and peace.</p>

<p>But always there was talk of France, with lingering, poignant
pictures of the land they had left, of the red roofs of Quiberon
that look across the bay at Croise and the cobbled streets of
Rennes that lead to the swift waters of the Vilaine.</p>

<p>In one of the patches of timber on Lac St. Luc there is a
lumber-camp, a nest of long buildings, ten feet high, that occupy a
roughly cleared space close to the water's edge. From the camp
there radiates a maze of winter roads traversed by a hundred
lumberjacks in gaudy woollen capotes, with axes and saws over their
shoulders, and down these roads, which ah slope gently to the lake,
great logs are drawn, to be dumped, rumbling, on the ice. All
through the day one can hear, near and far, the crash of big timber
toppling earthward, the creak of straining harness, the crack of
whips, the stroke of axes and the whine of distant saws. At night
there is talk beside great cast-iron stoves stuffed with fuel, much
smoke, the drone of winter winds and the plaintive hoot of the
great white owl.</p>

<p>It fell on a day when the sun shone bright and the snow was like
a sparkling blanket, that a man emerged from the Saguenay trail and
struck across Lac St. Luc. He walked with a long, easy swing,
bending a little forward beneath the weight of his pack. Threading
his way between the piles of logs, he halted at the door of the
main building, twisted his feet free of snowshoes and entered.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he said with a smile. "I have again arrived."</p>

<p>The cook looked round, and straightway forgot his cooking, for
the new-comer was none other than Antoine Carnot the
peddler&mdash;the bringer of news&mdash;the teller of
tales&mdash;the confidential go-between in the wilderness&mdash;the
human link with the outside world. Antoine was all of these, and
more. A bit of a doctor, a bit more of a lawyer, a shrewd trader,
and withal possessed of unfailing humour and a heart of gold. No
wonder that Pierre Colange forgot his cooking and hurried forward,
hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"Ten thousand welcomes, mon vieux. No, you shall not talk till
you have eaten. Behold, a partridge which was for the boss, but eat
and say nothing. The wind makes a chill in the stomach, but you
have an hour before the men come in. Fill thyself, and say nothing
till afterwards."</p>

<p>Antoine nodded and obeyed, while Pierre watched him admiringly.
Then there was news, much news from a dozen villages, while the
pack was unrolled and its contents spread on a table in the corner.
Knives and neckties, shirts and razors and mouth-organs, jimcracks
and cheap jewellery, studs and celluloid collars&mdash;the result
of Antoine's annual trip to Quebec. A great man was Antoine; had he
not once sent a telegram to Montreal and got an answer the very
next day, and he right there in Quebec all the time! Presently his
wares were displayed to his satisfaction, and he sent Pierre a
swift glance.</p>

<p>"Jean Deslormes, he is still here?"</p>

<p>Pierre nodded. "He makes good money, forty dollars a
month&mdash;and spends nothing save for tobacco."</p>

<p>"I was at Villeneuve this day two weeks ago," said Antoine
thoughtfully, "and saw the girl Marie Fisette. They are
betrothed."</p>

<p>Pierre laughed at this. "Does not the whole camp know it, and
how many times has Jean not told us! Every morning he goes along
the road making verses to that girl with his mouth. It is well that
he cannot write&mdash;but perhaps I do not understand such things.
I made no verses to my Henriette."</p>

<p>Antoine looked a little grave, "Sebastien was also at
Villeneuve, and full of anger when he heard of the betrothal. Marie
told me that he said strange and threatening things, that she
should never marry Jean. Then he barked something like a wolf, and
she did not see him again."</p>

<p>"Loup Garou!" whispered Pierre under his breath. It was a word
of awe through the outlying French country. The story of the Loup
Garou, that strange and malign combination of man and wolf, had
come across with them from the hills of Brittany. The belief still
held north of the Laurentians. It was always an old dog wolf,
tenanted by some evil and human spirit, endowed with wild powers of
murder and revenge, a lean grey beast that patrolled the winter
hills and sent his savage note drifting down into solitary villages
where simple folk gathered closer round the fire and glanced
apprehensively at the window-fastenings, Sometimes it was a man who
took the form of a wolf to serve his dread purpose, and became
again human when his deadly part was played.</p>

<p>This had been whispered of Sebastien behind his back. Where the
man came from none knew, only that calamity came with him. He was
small, dark and very active, with hollow cheeks and burning eyes,
and moved about through the French country, seldom doing any work,
but living apparently without effort. He was disliked and feared,
but the folk made no protest&mdash;at least to Sebastien. There was
the case of Georges Famieux who threw Sebastien out of his barn one
evening, and next morning found his prize cow with her throat torn.
One remembered that sort of thing in a district where cows were
scarce. So now the good Antoine pushed out his lips and nodded
gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said thoughtfully, "it can be nothing else."</p>

<p>A little silence fell in the cook's camp, and both men had a
vision of Marie Fisette of the parish of Villeneuve, Marie the
prettiest girl north of Cape Trinity, with her flaxen hair and
white skin like milk and a smile that was remembered and treasured
enviously in every lumber-camp on the Saguenay. They said that she
chose Jean Deslormes when she saw him driving logs through the
chute at Les Arables. And what Jean did then ought to be enough for
any girl.</p>

<p>"They will be married this summer&mdash;yes?" asked Pierre.</p>

<p>And just at this moment the door opened without sound, and
Sebastien himself strolled in. He rubbed his long hands to set the
blood going, glanced shrewdly at the two men and stared meaningly
toward the heaped platters on the stove. Pierre gave him food, this
being the law of the wilderness, while Antoine began to re-arrange
his stock. Both were a little breathless. Presently Sebastien
pushed away his plate.</p>

<p>"Without doubt, Pierre, you are the best cook in the Saguenay
camps. I will tell them so in Villeneuve." He lit his pipe and
began to smoke contentedly.</p>

<p>"You go then to Villeneuve?" hazarded Antoine.</p>

<p>"Yes, I start at once, this very day."</p>

<p>"By the Saguenay trail?"</p>

<p>Sebastien sent him an inscrutable smile. "My trail is my own,
Antoine"; then, meaningly, "let him follow who can."</p>

<p>"It is ninety miles to Villeneuve as the goose flies. What takes
you there in mid-winter?"</p>

<p>"The thing that takes all men to all places no matter what the
season. The face of a woman."</p>

<p>Pierre lifted a kettle from the stove, and the lid rattled. "Is
it then that Sebastien marries at his age?"</p>

<p>"What is age to the man who desires? In five days I shall have
what has been desired by many."</p>

<p>He announced this in a voice that lifted as he spoke, and
surveyed the others with burning, insolent eyes as though daring
them to protest. There was in his manner something suggesting that
he had at his disposal powers of which they knew nothing. He leaned
a little forward, every line of his sinewy body resembling an
animal crouched to spring, and there was but one animal in the
minds of the others. He was known to travel swiftly, and always
alone, but no man had ever found his tracks. And though he could
not marry till after he had been in Villeneuve for at least three
days, he now stated he would marry in five. That left two days to
cover ninety miles, measured as the goose flies. There was but one
beast in the big timber that could travel like this. Antoine
glanced furtively at Pierre, and the latter gave the faintest nod.
"Loup Garou," their lips signalled.</p>

<p>Sebastien got up, stretched himself, gave a short laugh and
strode to the door. "For a good dinner, bien merci, mon vieux. It
is I who shall feed you when the logs come down past Villeneuve in
the spring. Every woman of the family of Fisette is an incomparable
cook. We shall be ready, Marie and I."</p>

<p>For a moment after he disappeared there was silence in the camp,
till both men stepped quickly to the window. Sebastien had reached
the ice, and putting on his snowshoes already struck southward
across Lac St. Luc. He walked swiftly, dwindling as they watched to
a dark speck that vanished round a nearby point. Then Antoine
looked at his friend and swore a great oath.</p>

<p>"Jean&mdash;-where is Jean?" "He comes with the sawyers in ten
minutes. But wait, will call them now."</p>

<p>Pierre went out and smote with a poker on a large steel triangle
that hung close to the door. Straightway the woods throbbed with a
clear singing note that lifted through the green tops and caused a
dropping of axes and cessation of droning saws, till down the
winter roads trooped the lumberjacks, hungry as bears and chanting
musically of Alluette and La Claire Fontaine. At their head came
Jean Delormes, a young, tawny-haired giant, straight as a hemlock
and shouldered like a bull moose. He caught sight of Antoine
outside the camp, and, running forward, flung round him a pair of
gigantic arms.</p>

<p>"Ah, c'est le vieux Papa Carnot. When didst thou arrive, and
hast thou perchance been at a place called Villeneuve?"</p>

<p>Antoine struggled for breath, "I would first that some young
fools learn their strength&mdash;and use it less," he
gasped&mdash;then, in a whisper, "No, I have not visited Villeneuve
since a fortnight past, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A fortnight! That is but a moment, while I have not been there
for two months. Is there nothing then, to tell me, no message?"</p>

<p>"Shout not thy love to the whole camp, my son. There was one
here a moment ago who even now is on his way to Villeneuve."</p>

<p>"Have you then sold all your stock to the good Pierre, and send
out for more?"</p>

<p>Antoine shook his head. "The name of the traveller is Sebastien,
and he goes fast."</p>

<p>"Le Loup Garou," said Jean grimly. "But why to Villeneuve?"</p>

<p>"In search of one Marie Fisette, who he swears will be his in
the space of five days. My son will need all his strength, and must
act very quickly. Let go, Jean, you break my arm!"</p>

<p>"He took what trail&mdash;quick!" Jean swayed a little, with
such a tremor as runs through the brown column of a pine when the
saw eats at its heart.</p>

<p>"He said that his trail was his own, and that any might follow
who could, then struck south around the point. Shut up thy Marie in
thy breast, my son, and hasten; but"&mdash;and here Antoine sent
him an eloquent glance&mdash; "search not always for the form of a
man as you travel."</p>

<p>Jean hurled himself into the sleeping-camp.</p>

<p>In ten minutes he was out on the ice, and, clearing the strewn
logs, swung forward toward the first southerly point of Lac St.
Luc. Thus led Sebastien's trail&mdash;long, narrow tracks with the
points of the shoes turned up a Little more than was usual in a
bush country and the tail of one with an outward twist. He would
remember that. They took him</p>

<p>round that point, straight as an arrow-flight past the next one
and on to a glassy patch where the water had come up and turned a
mile of Lac St. Luc into a looking-glass. Here he slipped off his
shoes, trotted across and cast about close to the shore line. There
was no more trail. He stood for a moment, shaking his head like a
great puzzled dog. This was the trail that any might follow who
could! His lips became dry as he doubled back, and, picking up his
own tracks, traversed the edge of the patch till he came to them
again. "By Gar!" he whispered. "By Gar!"</p>

<p>Eighty miles due south was Villeneuve, with Marie and tinkling
sleigh-bells and pearl-grey smoke climbing from heaped roofs.
Somewhere to the south was something nosing swiftly through the big
timber. "Search not always for the form of a man," Antoine had
said. Jean jerked out a tense petition to St. Joseph, patron and
guardian of the family Fisette, then put on his shoes.</p>

<p>There was moonlight by seven. It turned the snow to a pale
purple, on which blue-black shadows of big timber lay in wide and
parallel bars. He tramped across these, bar to bar, leaning forward
with massive arms swinging, his legs working like pistons; a vast
engine of a man moving in a white flurry and spouting deep-drawn
jets of vapour. There was no sound save the creak of shoes, and a
muffled thud as some overburdened cedar doffed its load of snow and
straightened its tender branches in the stinging air. Presently he
came to a frozen swamp.</p>

<p>On the other side of this, where the shadows began again, stood
a lone wolf.</p>

<p>It vanished as he stared, merging like one shadow into another.
Jean paused for a moment while a new thought dawned, and struck off
sharp to the right. Two hundred yards away he found it&mdash;a wolf
track&mdash;the triangular pad with the long sharp projecting toe
and narrow trailing heel. He followed this back a quarter-mile,
noting that it paralleled his own, curving where his curved and
holding south for Villeneuve. And then Jean knew.</p>

<p>At four in the morning the moon went down in a bank of cloud.
Came a whine of wind and a few drifting flakes. The woods grew
dark. By this time Jean was very hungry, and therefore felt cold,
for in these latitudes the body, like a boiler, demands fuel. He
shoveled aside the snow, made fire and tea, searching the gloom
with quick and furtive glances, crossing himself between gulps. In
ten minutes he heard a rabbit squeal. That meant death in the
ground hemlock near by. Something else was feeding there, and
resting&mdash;resting.</p>

<p>As the goose flies it is ninety miles from the camp on St, Luc
to Villeneuve, but as man travels not less than a hundred. As a
wolf might go it is perhaps ninety-five. At sunrise Jean knew it
was the same this time for man and wolf. There was not so much
concealment now. He saw the gaunt, grey form flitting, wraith-like,
between brown trunks, a malign beast with deep, lean shoulders and
bony, arrow-shaped head. It rested when he rested, ate when he
ate&mdash;and kept always a little in advance.</p>

<p>By mid-afternoon it became difficult to think of anything else
and he grew very sleepy. It was only the vision of Marie with her
flaxen hair, her smiling mouth and white arms that held him awake.
At sundown he knew that he must sleep if only for half an hour, or
he would lose his way. There were no stars this time, and no moon.
He made two fires of green birch-logs, laid spruce-boughs between
them, pulled the hood of his capote over his nose and stretched
out.</p>

<p>Instantly, it seemed he began to dream. There was no loup garou
now, but only love and the whiteness of his girl's shoulder. At
this unction his body yielded, his great muscles relaxed; till,
smiling, he plunged into an abyss of slumber, lulled by tiny,
crepitant voices from the surrounding forest. Then, horribly, the
dream became distorted. Marie's face, so close to his own, changed
to a grinning mask with black lifted lips, fat, sleek skull and
malevolent yellow eyes. The yellow gave place to black. They were
the eyes of Sebastien. Simultaneously came a strange warmth on his
cheeks. He blinked. Something was staring at him, something so near
that it shut out the rest of the world. He gave a cry and sprang to
his feet. There was a scramble in the snow by the spruce-boughs.
Jean Deslornes was alone again.</p>

<p>"Que le bon Dieu nous sauvasit!" he whispered, trembling.</p>

<p>From a southward ridge came answer, not by le bon Dieu, but the
wild and haunting voice of the grey wolf. Through the big timber it
drifted,</p>

<p>savage, remote, but inescapable, the note of terror that in a
season of the year carries its own message to fur and hide on the
foothills of the Laurentians. To Jean it also carried a message,
and he flung himself forward. It could not now be more than thirty
miles to Villeneuve. He swung on, summoning his vast reserve of
strength, plunging through underbrush where once he would have gone
round, himself now a thing of the woods in the manner of his
going&mdash;this giant with the mind of a child. He stayed not to
rest or eat; he looked not again for the grey shape. Then a
remembered hilltop&mdash; a winter road for drawing wood&mdash;an
outlying pasture&mdash;the bark of a distant dog&mdash;and below,
in the valley, revealed in the half-light of dawn, the spire of a
church and the forty farms they called Villeneuve. Into the
crisping air climbed forty pencils of pearl smoke, like the
exhalations of those who slumbered yet a while ere facing the
rigour of the day.</p>

<p>Jean tore downhill to the house of Marthe Fisette, the mother of
Marie. It seemed that all was safe here. He paused at the door,
heard inside the crackling of a fire, and knocked. At sight of him
the old woman dropped an armful of wood.</p>

<p>"Jean!" she stammered, "how came you here?"</p>

<p>"As flies the goose from Lac St. Luc," he said, breathing hard;
"and Marie?"</p>

<p>Marthe did not answer that, but stared at him wonderingly and
with a touch of awe. "It is undoubtedly the good God who has sent
you, but how did you know?"</p>

<p>"Antoine Carnot told me; and, hearing it, I waited for
nothing&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off, staring back. "Then it is
true?"</p>

<p>"Sebastien?" Her lips framed the name.</p>

<p>He nodded. "Le Loup Garou! Together we have come from the camp
on Lac St. Luc, and this morning he also is in Villeneuve, but in
what form I know not. Last night when for a moment I closed my eyes
he came and crouched beside me, breathing in my face, and would
have torn my throat had I not suddenly awakened. I brought no gun,
for one cannot kill a loup garou except with a bullet that has been
blessed, and there was no priest on Lac St. Luc."</p>

<p>Marthe crossed herself fervently. "That is true&mdash;always it
has been so."</p>

<p>"And the friends here&mdash;what do they say?"</p>

<p>"They shrug their shoulders&mdash;and say nothing. It is not
well to quarrel with Sebastien. There is that affair of the good
Famieux&mdash;a thing all remember."</p>

<p>"And Marie?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Marthe sent him a wintry smile. "Look over your shoulder, my
son."</p>

<p>She was halfway down the ladder-stair from the room above; Marie
with thick, yellow, knitted strands down her back, great, slumbrous
roses in her smooth cheeks and drowsy love in her blue eyes. Jean
gave a huge, gusty sigh of delight, put out his mighty arms and
lifted her as one picks up an acorn. She hid her face in his
capote.</p>

<p>"My little one," he said softly, "my little partridge; thou art
safe here, very safe."</p>

<p>Presently they put food before him, and he ate ravenously,
telling in snatches of the trip from Lac St. Luc&mdash;"ninety-five
miles in forty-two hours, by Gar!" while Marie clucked over him as
though she were indeed a hen partridge, and Marthe busied herself
without words between stove and table. Then Jean got up.</p>

<p>"I go now to Pere Leduc, for we shall be married in three days.
Also there is the matter of blessing some bullets." He paused, and
waved a hand at the encircling bush. "It is there I shall use
them."</p>

<p>"I also shall go," said Marie, divided between love and
fear.</p>

<p>He shook his great head. "Such talk is not for my little bird,
but thou shalt go so far as the store, and wait there. In three
days my soul shall go everywhere with me. Be content, my
swallow."</p>

<p>They went off down the packed road, where the snowplough had
left four-foot ridges on either side, down to the store which was
diagonally opposite the church and the house of the good Father.
Here Jean left her clasped to the expansive bosom of Madame
Famieux, crossed the road, kicked his shoe-packs clean and found
Pere Leduc in his book-lined study. And books were precious north
of the Laurentians. He spoke first of his heart's desire.</p>

<p>The Father nodded, smiling. He loved this young Anak, this son
of the wilderness, with his great thews and child-like heart. Wise
and tender was Pere Leduc, a pure flame that glowed constantly,
healing both minds and souls with a wide spiritual paternity.</p>

<p>"It is well for you both&mdash;and the good Marthe agrees?"</p>

<p>Jean nodded.</p>

<p>"Then I will call your names at vespers this very night, so that
it may take place in three days. A good girl, your Marie. You go
yourself back to Lac St. Luc?"</p>

<p>No, Jean would not do that, He had saved eight hundred dollars
for a farm&mdash;and the farm of Georges Laurier was it not in the
market? He paused a moment.</p>

<p>"There is another matter. MON PERE&mdash;that of these bullets."
He held out a dozen, cupped in a gigantic palm. "May it please you
to bless them?"</p>

<p>Pere Leduc shook his head gently. Had he not been very wise he
would have laughed. He knew&mdash;knew all about it. Individually
he knew more than the entire village put together. Part of his
strength was that he only revealed a fraction of his knowledge. And
now he wanted to hear what this enormous child had to say&mdash;all
of it.</p>

<p>"Tell me, my son."</p>

<p>Jean told him, from the very start, touching not on the physical
marvel of the trip&mdash;for to Jean it was no marvel-but only on
its terror. How did Sebastien leave the flooded patch on Lac St.
Luc? What became of his shoes when he turned into a wolf. What did
he mean by breathing in Jean's face? Why did he lead the way to
Villeneuve? And most of all, what was the import of his boast about
Marie? There must be an end to this&mdash;the end brought by a
bullet</p>

<p>that had been blessed. All Villeneuve was waiting for that.</p>

<p>Pere Leduc put his hand on the young giant's shoulder, and spoke
of tradition and legends and the powers of evil. "No, my son, you
yourself are about to give answer to Sebastien&mdash;a final
answer. You and this dear daughter of the parish will have my
blessing, and not these bullets. When in three days you leave the
church with Marie on your arm and joy in your heart you will have
replied to Sebastien. He will have written himself down as a
loud-speaking fool at whom not only the village of Villeneuve will
laugh. That laugh will run up and down the Saguenay, till he will
wish to walk into the stream itself to escape it. As for what you
saw and searched for, but did not find on your way here, when the
mind of a man be distraught with weariness, and perhaps fear, there
is not much of which he can be very sure. You have had an evil
dream, but it is past. Go now, my son, and take peace and happiness
with you. Le bon Dieu is not forgetful of his children on the
Saguenay."</p>

<p>Jean went out, cheered but not convinced. It was all very well
to talk like that. But he knew, while the good Father had not been
on the trail from St. Luc. He rubbed the bullets together in his
pocket, stalked across to the store and gathered in Marie.</p>

<p>"Behold my wife in three days&mdash;this little spruce
partridge." he said to the fat Madame Famieux. "VIENS DONC, CHERIE;
there is much to talk of."</p>

<p>Up the shining road, arms linked, they walked, while Jean told
her the words of Pere Leduc. Nor was Marie convinced. The good
Father had never felt Sebastien's burning eyes, nor could he
understand what it meant to a girl to shrink and quiver beneath
that insolent stare till she became weak and helpless like a bird
in a net.</p>

<p>"It is but one thing we shall do, Jean."</p>

<p>"What is that, my dove?"</p>

<p>"You shall meet Sebastien and take his promise, or make it, that
there is an end to all this."</p>

<p>"Of what value then is the word of a wolf, could he speak it?"
grunted Jean. Then, looking up, his heart leaped. Sebastien had
rounded a bend in the road and came straight toward them. Marie saw
him, shivered and clung the closer.</p>

<p>"Jean," she whispered, "not now!"</p>

<p>Drawing nearer he walked more slowly, staring first at the giant
with strange, inscrutable gaze, then at Marie with a wild, unhuman
hunger. His cheeks were hollow, but he moved lightly on his feet.
They were not the feet of a man who had travelled ninety miles in
forty-two hours&mdash;or less. He came level with them. Marie found
herself pushed gently forward and past him. Jean stood motionless,
every sinew in him turned to fire.</p>

<p>"Loup Garou," he said thickly, "Loup Garou, what seek you
now?"</p>

<p>Sebastien did not speak, but lowered his lids, and from hot,
half-veiled eyes sent the big man a look of contemptuous pity. So
keen was it, so utterly penetrating, that Jean felt as though a
hand were fumbling</p>

<p>in his breast and groping for secrets. Then, as Sebastien was
about to pass on, a mighty arm shot out and took him by the throat.
He was shaken as a wolverine shakes a rabbit, shaken till his teeth
chattered and flung headlong into the crusted snow. Jean turned on
his heel and followed Marie.</p>

<p>"It is done, my turtle&mdash;and the wolf did not bark."</p>

<p>Late that night, after Jean had gone to sleep at the farm of
Christophe Famieux, Marie talked long with her mother and told her
the words of Pere Leduc. Marthe could make no answer to these
words, but found them nevertheless devoid of comfort. Presently she
climbed the stair ladder, returning with a small image of St.
Joseph, patron saint to every good Fisette.</p>

<p>"It is lead," she murmured, "and from Ste. Anne de Beaupre it
came, where it was blessed by his Eminence from Quebec. Is it not
that the head of the holy man is of the size of a bullet?"</p>

<p>Marie nodded, her eyes brightening.</p>

<p>"Then the rest of it I leave to thee, my pigeon. When thy
mountain of a husband shall take thee from me in a sleigh to
Beaulieu on the third day from this, see that the short gun of
Christophe be thus loaded, and near at hand under the robes. It is
in my mind that there will be need of that gun."</p>

<p>So on the third day, Gaston Roubidoux, sacristan, sent a rocking
peal from the wooden church, and those of Villeneuve came in
box-like sleighs stuffed with straw, and drawn by short-legged,
round-bodied</p>

<p>Percheron horses, to see the union of Jean and
Marie&mdash;doubly intriguing because it spelled the humiliation of
Le Loup Garou. Marie was all in white, with everlastings in her
hair; Jean in a new, tight and very bright blue suit into which he
just wedged his great body, celluloid collar anchored by a large
rolled-gold stud, yellow tie and patent-leather shoes that hurt
abominably. Then Pere Leduc spoke words of peace and love, after
which they all went to the house of Christophe, the largest in the
village, where was given the marriage feast, with riotous
quadrilles and great good feeling. And Sebastien had not been seen
by anyone since three days&mdash;which added not a little to the
general hilarity.</p>

<p>Beaulieu lay thirty miles away-or was it only three? Jean, being
dizzy with happiness and pride, was not quite sure when at sunset
he tucked his girl into the sleigh, wrapping the robes closely
round her feet. There was plenty of straw underneath. Marthe had
seen to that. The horses, pet team of Christophe, arching their
glossy necks, dashed off with a jangle of bells amid laughter and
cheers. The good Father nodded contentedly and turned homeward.
These children of his&mdash;how gay and handsome they were!</p>

<p>Halfway to Beaulieu&mdash;the horses going like playful
kittens&mdash;Marie pressing to his side&mdash;frosty roses in her
cheeks&mdash;the blue eyes like stars&mdash;with all this Jean
could hardly believe his own good fortune. What a noble day it had
been, and how many others, even more wonderful, lay ahead!</p>

<p>5 His feet were now very sore&mdash;-that being from the
dancing-his collar-stud was boring a hole in his gullet, but he was
bursting with joy.</p>

<p>"My love," he breathed, "my soul&mdash;my little ptarmigan!"</p>

<p>Just at this moment there came from a belt of cedar hard by the
pulsing howl of a timber wolf. Marie heard and shivered. Jean
heard, and his heart stopped, then began to race. The Percherons
heard, whinnied their alarm and plunged forward. Jean, gripping the
reins, lashed out till the woods streamed past in a blur. If the
road only held open he could make Beaulieu in an hour.</p>

<p>They swung into a clearing where the wind had got at the snow
and the road was drifted level. Knee-deep toiled the Percherons,
heads down, backs rippled with straining muscles. Jean stood up.
Something shot across just ahead, turned, doubled back and made a
ripping, darting stroke at the throat of the nearest horse.</p>

<p>"Quick, Jean, under the straw at my feet&mdash;the gun of
Christophe with the head of St. Joseph!" panted Marie.</p>

<p>He wondered what St. Joseph had to do with it, but a gun was a
gun, and, burrowing swiftly, he recognised the short,
single-barrelled muzzle-loader with half-inch bore. Pushing the
reins into the girl's hands, he cuddled his cheek against the brown
stock&mdash;and waited. The near Percheron was bleeding at the
throat. Again that lean, darting form, ears flattened back on the
sleek skull, again the curving attack rapid as light.</p>

<p>The wolf was in mid-air when the foresight covered a grey
shoulder for a fraction of time. Jean crooked his finger&mdash;saw
horses rearing in a tangle of harness&mdash;card Marie cry out in a
jangle of bells. Then a lank, hairy body seemed to have been thrust
away, and stretched, twitching, just ahead of the driving
hoofs.</p>

<p>He snatched back the reins, forced on the Percherons and fetched
them up, quivering, on top of the thing on the road. Here for a
deadly second the steel-shod, dancing feet hammered
down&mdash;down, till what lay beneath was a shapeless lump of
bloody hide. Marie covered her eyes, but Jean, soothing his team,
stared at it hard before he bent over and kissed the roses back to
her cheeks. It was in his mind that the eyes of this wolf, instead
of being long and yellow, had been large and dark and burning. They
did not burn now. But he said nothing of this.</p>

<p>"My little weasel spoke of the gun of Christophe with the head
of the good St. Joseph," he smiled. "And what did she mean by
that?"</p>

<p>Marie told him, and for months after that there was little talk
of Sebastien. Then summer arrived. The logs from St. Luc began to
come down the Saguenay, and Jean was persuaded to help the drive
through the chute of Les Arables. Marie went with him, and so it
happened that Pierre Colange on a certain day did indeed sit at the
table of an incomparable cook. The shanty that Jean knocked
together stood close to the river, and the table was outside. They
were talking of Sebastien when Pierre got up, shaded his eyes and
stared hard at the tawny water.</p>

<p>"It has been in my mind, MON VIEUX, that we should meet him yet
once again. What is that between the two hemlocks?"</p>

<p>He had come down with the logs&mdash;come from the
unknown&mdash;-and circled slowly in a great eddy. The smooth face
was still unscarred. One sodden arm rested on the ribbed bark. The
eddy brought him toward shore, bobbing as though something were
twitching at his heels. The three gazed at each other, till Jean,
remembering the prophecy of Pere Leduc, lifted his brows and
signalled.</p>

<p>"Go inside a moment, my little beaver. It is not for thee to
see."</p>

<p>There is a cross underneath a jack-pine just below that eddy.
Jean hewed it. On a flat stone at the foot is a small leaden image
without a head. That was the thought of Marie. On the cross Pierre
Colange, with some misgivings, put the name&mdash;one word. He
could not decide what else, under the circumstances, one might
safely say. It stood there after the drive went on and the
following sweep had cleared every stranded log. Squirrels perched
on it, rabbits hopped about it, red-headed woodpeckers sometimes
tried their strength on its tough fibre. But nothing happened till
Antoine Carnot passed in the autumn.</p>

<p>He saw it, read the one word and exactly appreciated the
difficulty. So, smiling, he lit his pipe, squatted close, and began
to carve with firm, deep strokes.</p>

<p>"Sebastien. Le Loup Garou," read the next lumberjack who came
that way.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>THE SPIRIT OF THE NORTH</h2>

<p>I</p>

<p>Along the broad back of a great ridge the outline of a man moved
slowly, tramping down the snow with wide-webbed shoes, whose
symmetrical furrow stretched for leagues behind him. He leant
forward as he walked, a tall figure muffled in a woollen tunic, the
capote down over his hard blue eyes. The visible portion of his
face was tanned a deep brown, his moustache a cake of ice, and the
breath from his hot lungs spouted little jets of vapour into the
tingling air.</p>

<p>All around the land was white, save where a scanty growth lined
the gullies with thickets of spruce and Birch. Over it sighed the
winds of the North, whose chilling touch crept down from the Arctic
circle and laid a crystallised finger of silence on the Barren
Lands. The snow had wrapped the sharp edges of every ridge in a
sheer blanket that stretched for a thousand miles, undulating in
slow and glistening waves to the hard line of a distant horizon. It
shone&mdash;a domain of death&mdash;where so late the wild rose
blossomed and the air throbbed with innumerable wings. The man
halted, slackened his shoulders, and sat for a moment on the
pack-sack. He had come twenty miles and another twenty remained to
be traversed.</p>

<p>He felt no fatigue; the muscles in his body were like well-oiled
steel springs. Presently he stood up, stretched his arms, resumed
his load, and swung down-hill towards the nearest thicket of
spruce. Here&mdash;taking off his shoes&mdash;he built a small
fire, made tea, and ate sparingly of pork and bread. Both being
frozen solid, he scorched them, meditatively, at the end of a
stick.</p>

<p>He remained thus for half an hour, his strong jaws champing, and
tossing a morsel now and then to a jay who lit suddenly on a branch
nearby. Its head was tilted on one side, while, chattering sharply,
it regarded him with bright, inquisitive eyes. He rubbed a wisp of
tobacco in his palm, smoked for a few moments, then, knocking the
ice from the webbing of his shoes, thrust his feet into the straps
and swung on. Just at this moment there came to him on the wind a
faint sound from beyond the ridge.</p>

<p>"My God !" he said under his breath.</p>

<p>An hour later he was five miles away, walking fast. His face was
set, and a hard light glinted in his frosty eyes. Now and again he
glanced over his shoulder&mdash;quick, furtive glances that seemed
to shrink from finding what they sought. The sound came less
intermittently&mdash;clearer and nearer&mdash;the most terrible
voice in the North&mdash;the voice of the terror of the
wilderness.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards he saw them&mdash;like black specks that moved
steadily over a white counterpane&mdash;two miles away, but
distinct in the glittering air.</p>

<p>In single file they travelled, the tall leader lifting now and
then her black muzzle and sending out a note of death&mdash;the
bunting call of the pack, It drifted through the desolation. Fur
and feather heard and knew it. Mink and marten tunnelled into the
snow, the rabbit scampered to his burrow, and even
carcajou&mdash;the wolverine&mdash;scuffled hastily for
shelter.</p>

<p>The man, too, heard it and cursed. From the mouth of his
pack-sack projected the sawed-off muzzle of a Winchester rifle. He
unstrapped this and tested the magazine. There were three
cartridges. His lips pressed tight and, glancing ahead, he strode
off with quickened pace towards a clump of small timber that lay in
a depression half a mile ahead. Once there he slipped off his
burden. The voice of the pack was nearer now.</p>

<p>Selecting the largest spruce, he chopped off the lower branches
to a height of six feet, leaving a series of sharp points. Then,
swinging the sack into the tree, he mounted swiftly, his rifle
slung over his shoulder. Ten minutes later a grey wolf loped
noiselessly by, smelt at the trampled snow and squatted on her
haunches. In the next moment the green eyes were fastened on the
man.</p>

<p>The long blade muzzle opened and the call went forth&mdash;sharp
and terrible. Came an answering whimper from the thicket and six
more wolves trotted up, their gaunt frames moving with incredible
smoothness. There was no sound save wind in the tree-tops and the
soft muffled thud as some laden branch deposited its weight of
snow. The seven beasts</p>

<p>stared up and the man stared down. They were all full grown, but
the bitch that led them was the biggest of all, with long flanks,
deep hairy chest, clean, sharp, black muzzle and pointed ears. She
spoke once, and the pack squatted, noses between forepaws, the fur
deep on the ridges of their backs, the lips lifted a little, tile
green eyes fixed in a remorseless stare. They could afford to
wait.</p>

<p>The man shifted gingerly to another branch. Instantly the seven
brutes were erect, their backs bristling. The grey leader licked
her dark muzzle, while from her shaggy throat came a warning note.
Very slowly he pulled the Winchester from its case. When he looked
down again the pack had scattered and circled with soundless feet
fifty yards away, slipping like wraiths from tree to tree, visible
one moment, invisible the next, implacable and restless, with death
locked in their jaws. He perceived that it was useless to shoot.
One could not kill a ghost.</p>

<p>The wind strengthened, till all around there was a swaying of
thick green branches and a tumbling of snow. The patrol did not
slacken. A little clear glade lay southward, and beyond he could
see open country&mdash;wind-smitten&mdash;devoid of life. It was an
hour when all that Lived on the Barren Lands sought shelter, save
only the grey terror of the wilds.</p>

<p>Rigid on his perch the cold began to strike more formidably. He
felt it first in hands and feet, and knocked them together noisily,
whereat there was a closing in of the savage ring and a sharper
gleam</p>

<p>in the merciless eyes. He continued his movements till the tree
was surrounded by a cordon of jaws, when suddenly he snatched at
his rifle and fired.</p>

<p>There was a scattering of padded feet and the tall bitch dragged
one leg, while she yelped fury and revenge. The man laid his rifle
carefully across a branch. He had two cartridges left. His brows
were pulled down, his arms and legs were getting numb, the cold was
reaching his body. He drew off one mitt and pressed his palm
against a frost-bite on his cheek. He slipped a little, recovering
himself with a queer feeling of sickness.</p>

<p>The light began to fade. Followed that amazingly short period
when in these latitudes darkness seems to pour from the sky and
crush out the day. The sky turned red, pink, grey, till a hard
purple asserted itself. The evening star hung like a lamp low over
the horizon. Simultaneously the pack found courage, closing in till
the gaunt bodies were almost beneath him, as though they knew that
he had but two cartridges left and was keeping one for himself.</p>

<p>The tall bitch stood upright on hind-legs and scratched at the
frozen bark with extended claws. He could look straight down her
throat. How black was the roof of her mouth! There was no yelping
now, but only an occasional quick, light panting of the deep
chests. They had settled down to wait.</p>

<p>The man's thighs grew stiff where they gripped the tree. His
back and shoulders had lost all heat, and he felt the drowsiness
that in the North heralds the approach of one's last sleep. It came
to him that he must not wait too long, or he would be alive</p>

<p>when he tumbled. He felt again at the Winchester. This time the
pack did not move. Very carefully he lowered the butt of the rifle
till it rested on a lifeless foot. Then he drew the muzzle
vertically under his chin.</p>

<p>A wolf on the outskirts of the circle put his nose into the air
with a querulous whimper. Something in the sound of it galvanised
his grey brethren into stiff attention. They stood Like images, the
wind lifting their long hair, their pointed ears rigid. Another
whimper, and another, till suddenly the pack wheeled and raced like
phantoms down the glade.</p>

<p>The man, his rifle still in position, straightened his smarting
eyes. A mile away, where the white plain glistened beneath a full
moon, he saw a cluster of dark bodies ploughing laboriously through
the drifts. It was a band of coast caribou. The pack made for them,
every throat flinging terrible cries into the night.</p>

<p>He waited for five minutes, then another five. Presently he
dropped his pack-sack and half-slid half-tumbled from his perch. He
could not feel the toe-straps of his shoes. Standing for a moment
to make sure of the wind's direction, he broke into a half-trot,
trailing the rifle and heading down-wind. A spruce partridge
cheeped sleepily in an adjoining tree. A mink pushed his head out
of a crevice and stole light-footed to the stain of blood that
shone like a ruby on the sparkling snow.</p>

<p>II</p>

<p>Ten miles away another man dragged himself slowly southward. The
sinews of his legs were burning like fire. For hours he had
tramped, travelling by the lie of the land and the run of hidden
rivers, but now the punishment of the trail was on him, the trail
that tempts and tortures, that allures and kills, the trail to
which the hearts of men respond as to a trumpet-call.</p>

<p>He had ten miles go, but his food was exhausted. Matches he had
in a tight box with a screw cap, and an axe. Ten miles back he had
taken a wrong turn that led him through rough country where no man
was meant to go. One shoe was broken. He had patched it up and
tramped on, but his fingers were too stiff for fine work, and the
frame gave at every step.</p>

<p>The pain in his legs increased, and he grew hungry. The fact,
rather than the hunger, made him clench his lips and push on though
every step was agony. He knew that to be hungry is to be cold, that
to be cold is to be weak, and that for those who are weak the North
has no mercy. H fired once at a rabbit and missed, his fingers
being too stiff to manipulate the trigger.</p>

<p>His mind began to work queerly. It seemed to him that the North
was like a mistress&mdash;beautiful but heartless&mdash;winning
men's souls, then destroying them. Always, it appeared, this
mistress did nothing.</p>

<p>The men themselves did everything&mdash;theirs being the pride,
the passion, and the offering. Then, when she had taken everything,
she just waited with that wintry smile of hers, and the end came
very quickly. She did not change, being assured of interminable
lovers from all corners of the earth who would in turn make their
oblations and receive their grim reward.</p>

<p>Presently the pain became so great that be knew that he must
rest, no matter how that rest might end, and just at that moment he
saw ahead of him a stretch of glare ice where a river wound
southward. He struck down-hill thankfully. Reaching the ice, he
still wore his shoes so as to distribute weight, and moved on. His
legs did not hurt so much now, being relieved from lifting that
weary webbing. He was looking at the line of scanty timber along
the shore, when everything gave way beneath. Automatically he
spread out his arms.</p>

<p>He was immersed neck-deep in a chilling flood whose current
tugged invisibly at the great shoes, as though trying to rip them
off. He twisted at them, but his mittens slipped on the glare ice
and the effort merely drew him under. Tile current clutched his
body, and through it there crept the first assault of breathless
cold. He gasped sharply, seeming to have no feet left.</p>

<p>Presently be tried again, staring at the shore, which seemed so
near and warm and unapproachable. He shouted, emptying his lungs,
but heard only the drone of wind and the intense frost at work</p>

<p>in the scanty timber, with sharp rifle-like reports that died
with dwindling echoes down far stretches of the manacled river.
Then he knew that he must save himself&mdash;or die.</p>

<p>Twisting desperately, and pressing hard with his arms on the
yielding ice, he turned his body up-stream and, pointing his toes
downwards, he felt one foot, then the other, loosen. Another twist
and his ankles came free. The blind current took the shoes swiftly.
He rested a moment, and, with a grim smile, thrust one arm into the
water and laid it dripping on the ice. Then the other.</p>

<p>In a few seconds he was anchored&mdash;congealed and riveted
there&mdash;a portion of a man&mdash;as though in supplication to
some unknown god. He began to pull, crooking elbows. His shoulders
lifted. There sounded a warning crack, but his breast was by now
over the edge. He drew a long, shivering breath and pulled
again.</p>

<p>This time his thighs came up. He crawled a few feet forward, the
only wet thing in that bitter wilderness, but wet only for an
instant. His clothing ceased to drip and became armour, stiffening
momentarily, and gripping his exhausted body where no heat was. He
began to shuffle arduously to the shore, crackling as he
went&mdash;half-man, half-animal&mdash;seeking the shelter of the
woods.</p>

<p>Reaching them gasping, he broke open his pocket and pulled at
the match-box he could no longer feel. It was more difficult to get
at his axe, the haft of which hung at his belt, its head in a
leather pouch. His mittens refused to grasp it. He clutched with
frozen hands, making cuts at dead trees, breaking dry twigs,
stamping the snow. The cold had nearly reached his heart. He got
the box open by holding the cap in his teeth, and finally lit a
match by biting its head. This he pushed under a handful of
birch-bark and stood breathless, swinging his arms.</p>

<p>His circulation quickened a little. Savage spots developed in
face, hands and feet, where frost had struck deep. He lengthened
the fire, heaping it high, then set to work building another six
feet distant. Between them he toiled like a salamander, his
clothing now dripping. Eight feet away it was forty below zero.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he began to strip off his now softened armour,
spreading it on branches stuck upright in the sodden snow. It
steamed furiously, and he tended it in bare feet, clad only in
drawers. There was a roaring of flames, a crackling of wood. In
this recess the wind did not reach him, but he was alternately
baked and frozen as he moved towards or from the twin furnaces.
Heat blisters spread amongst the frost-bites, and his skin looked
like mottled marble. In half an hour he smelt scorched cloth and
dressed quickly. Here and there the clothing was burnt through, but
it was dry. His moccasins took the longest. Finally he gave this up
and put them on, when they instantly became hard, like
parchment.</p>

<p>He struck out for the river-bank, wading through snow that came
nearly to his middle. At the edge of the ice he paused, scanned the
black spot where a glaze had already formed over an irregular hole,
and began to struggle down-stream, trusting to the ice as much as
he dared, but clinging nevertheless within reach of the friendly
shore.</p>

<p>III</p>

<p>To the west of the river lifted a medley of ridges, ironed
smooth by the snow. On the other side of this a third man moved
southward. From a mountain-top it would have been seen that the
trails of all three travellers converged towards the same point,
where from a cluster of dark green timber a thin grey pencil of
smoke climbed into the keen air. It was a throb of life in the
wilderness, a magnet to the wanderers, a place of warmth and
food.</p>

<p>The third man progressed uncertainly, diverging now and then
from the faint depression left by the swinging tread of some former
traveller. He was tall and gaunt. His sunken cheeks were grey with
frost, ice plastered his feet, and he walked with a strangely
uncertain step, stopping now and then to rub his eyes and peer
questioningly at the driven snow ahead.</p>

<p>He had been tramping thus since early morning. At noon his eyes
began to smart and at two o'clock the rims of the lids were red and
swollen; an hour later they began to stick, while a thick,
glutinous fluid oozed from their stinging corners. The flesh around
them swelled rapidly, and they burnt as though seared with hot
irons.</p>

<p>He pushed on drunkenly, swaying as he went, but ever the
interminable glitter of the snow struck upward and smote him the
more fiercely. The trail grew dim. Trees passed like men walking.
His ears, sharpened by distress, became his interpreters, bringing
him the faint squeak of small startled animals and a heavy beat of
wings as an ivory-beaked raven winnowed the air overhead. The
whiteness of the land grew blurred, and his lips moved in a
wordless petition. He walked now as one who sees with his feet,
feeling for the slight hardness of the trail, the light of day
being for him as darkness. Then his lids refused to be rubbed open,
and he did not see anything any more.</p>

<p>He stood for a little while quite still, feeling with moistened
fingers to establish. what wind might blow. His face expressed no
fear, but just a dumb wonder that this thing should have come to
him. There were so many other men abroad in the North. Suddenly it
struck him that he had been a fool not to stop an hour ago and make
some kind of camp and fire. That was what he wanted
now&mdash;fire.</p>

<p>He stamped with his shoes to make sure he was on the trail;
then, to make doubly sure, took off his mitts and felt beneath the
light surface drift for the thickened shell that should lie just
below. He found it unmistakably, and nodded. In the very middle of
it he began to dig, using one shoe as a shovel and casting into the
wind. Three feet down he came to moss and, poking at arm's height,
determined that his parapet was nearly level with his head. He
stood now in a hole some four feet square, with sharply sloping
sides. Testing the wind again, he found none.</p>

<p>By this time he was used to the dark, though his eyes hurt more
than ever, and, opening his pack-sack&mdash;fumbling a little with
the straps&mdash;-he pulled out a pair of Hudson Bay blankets.
Wrapping these round his body, he thrust himself in as far as he
could beneath the parapet, allowing the displaced snow to cover him
completely. As it slid over his face, which was nearly hidden by a
capote, he put out a hand, holding it stiffly till the slide
ceased. The hand was presently withdrawn to inner darkness, leaving
an irregrular air-hole a few inches long. There was left but a
depression, from which spurted small regular puffs of vapour.
Beside it a pair of wide shoes stood up into the wind, and at the
bottom lay a half-emptied pack-sack.</p>

<p>The moon came out, the cold intensified. In the pale light
rabbits hopped, like bundles of white fur with large pink eyes. An
Arctic owl circled with wide, noiseless pinions above the hole,
like a ghost of the wilderness. An otter came streaking up the
trail, which here ran close to the river, leaving a narrow furrow
in the loose drift. Carcajou&mdash;the wolverine and
glutton&mdash;stared at the pack-sack, then slid down and began
tearing: it to pieces with strong white teeth, till suddenly the
jets of vapour caught his small black eyes, and he scrambled back
in a paroxysm of fear. The moon swam majestically naked through a
sky sown with innumerable stars, casting blue-black shadows where
the scattered spruce dotted the lower land. The river, like a strip
of polished glass, wound southward&mdash;-its surface whipped clear
of snow, There was no sound save the steady drone from the
North&mdash;a potent voice that through the winter months holds its
interminable pitch. In this abode of solitude, peopled by fur and
feather wise in the law of the wilderness and waging the endless
war for existence, man survives only by the stoutness of his heart
and the strength of his body. The battle is to the strong. The wind
bites, the cold pierces, the way of the trail is arduous, and he
who falters is doomed. It is a stark country, grim and unforgiving,
merciless in its mandates and swift to punish.</p>

<p>Far up the trail a dark figure became visible, moving fast with
long, swinging tread, bending forward in the attitude of the
practised walker. It was the first man, with strength flowing its
full warm tide through his sinewy frame. His eyes were bright and
he thought not at all of what had been, but of a log cabin farther
down the river, where a lamp would be burning in the window beneath
the laden roof. Quickly he came, till, opposite the shoes, he
stopped abruptly and stared down at the torn pack-sack. As he
stared it seemed that very faintly there issued from the snow
itself a fine, intermittent vapour. With an exclamation he twisted
his feet free and began to dig.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he was working desperately over a stiff body
stretched beside a blazing fire. His methods were harsh but
efficacious. The breath began to reinhabit the lungs it had so
nearly deserted. Presently the blind man sighed deeply and a quiver
ran through his frame. At that the rescuer redoubled his efforts,
and, lifting the slack shoulders, put a steaming cup to the blue
lips.</p>

<p>"Hard luck!" he said, "Drink this."</p>

<p>They started an hour afterwards, the rescuer in the lead. Behind
him, and grasping the end of a raw-hide tump-line, came the
saved&mdash;walking uncertainly, with weak knees and wavering feet.
The man in front was carrying both pack-sacks, which loomed up
mountainously in the pale white light. He stopped now and again
with a word of encouragement, asking no questions, but his brain
worked for them both.</p>

<p>At the second bend of the river he stopped. The blind man heard,
and halted at once, his ears accomplishing a double duty. The
rescuer peered at the river, where it seemed something was moving,
mysteriously uncouth. He slung his Winchester forward and felt for
the trigger, then, with a grunt, let the weapon lie loose in his
arm.</p>

<p>Two hundred yards away a man was floundering in the snow, his
arms waving despairingly. He was nearly spent, falling often and
rising to his feet, plastered with white&mdash;half-engulfed in the
sparkling sea around him. He tried to shout, but could make only a
half-choked, inarticulate sound, more beast&mdash;like than human.
On he came, wallowing towards the trail. The first man stood, till
suddenly the truth was clear and he stepped swiftly forward. A
moment later the stranger pitched on his face and lay still.</p>

<p>An hour passed. The blind man heard one voice, then two, the
second being weak and almost incoherent. He caught words of
encouragement, smelt a fire, and moved on as close as he dared. He
was too far gone to talk himself, but knew that mercy walked abroad
that night in the Barren Lands. After a while someone spoke to him
in tones he knew:</p>

<p>"We'll start now. Stamp down as hard as you can&mdash;this
fellow has no shoes."</p>

<p>The three got into motion&mdash;and the second man&mdash;the
blind one&mdash;held thankfully on to the tump-line. He heard the
shoes of the leader driven down on to the trail by legs of
piston-like force, and stamped weakly himself, numbly conscious
that uncertain steps were following close behind. There was no
talk&mdash;breath being too precious to consume in speech.</p>

<p>The last man mustered all his strength. His body, savagely
frost-bitten, felt as though burnt by hot metal, his legs and
thighs were wound with ribbons of pain. Snow was plastered on his
face, and in the small of his neck throbbed the one warning signal
which the men of the North have learnt to heed&mdash;the protest of
a body that is about to revolt. He did not think much of his own
distress, but of the one in front. That was hard luck.</p>

<p>The blind man pushed on with dwindling force. His closed eyes
exuded a paste that froze on his wind-whipped cheeks. His very
spine felt frozen. It was queer to be walking in the dark between
two strangers. What sort of a time, he wondered, had the last man
experienced! His own eyes would be better in a few days, but it was
tough to be out in the woods without snowshoes.</p>

<p>The first man walked slowly, moderating his pace to suit the
others. He had noted the ghastly look on the features of the last
one rescued, and the face stuck in his mind. It was tough to go
through the ice in weather like this, and tougher still to have to
sacrifice one's shoes. He was glad he had never been caught like
that. As to the blind one he felt even more sorry. It was worse to
be helpless than to be half-frozen. He spoke over his shoulder
occasionally&mdash;watching to see that he was not going too fast.
Presently&mdash;straight ahead&mdash;a spark of yellow light glowed
through the dark of a clump of trees. He gave one great, joyful
shout.</p>

<hr>

<p>For twelve hours the three lay motionless in bunks built one
over the other. The first man was on top&mdash;the blind one at the
bottom. The former awoke and blinked at the red-hot stove, stuffed
with blazing wood. The roar of it and the weight of blankets over
him were both grateful. He lay for a little while, smoking
peacefully, then, hearing movements beneath, put his head over the
wooden sideboard and looked down.</p>

<p>"Hallo, pilgrim, how goes it ?"</p>

<p>The third man grunted comfortably. "Fine!" Then he too leant out
and surveyed the occupant of the bottom bunk.</p>

<p>"How do you feel, partner?"</p>

<p>The blind man stretched a pair of mottled arms. His face was
still plastered with the discharge from closed and swollen
lids.</p>

<p>"Like a bull moose. Do I smell coffee?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>THE CIRCUIT OF THE WILD
SWAN</h2>

<p>Along the shore of a palm-fringed lagoon two black swans moved
slowly, and from their curving breasts spread a double ripple that
died with a whisper against the land. Above them a tropic moon shed
a pale glory in which they seemed like slender ships floating
through a dream. The stars were large and lustrous, the air full of
nameless murmurs that breathed delicately from swamp and
jungle.</p>

<p>Presently the stroke of the wide, webbed feet quickened as, from
far ahead, came a cluster of great birds flying low, their whipping
wings just clearing the black surface of the water, till, with a
sudden splashing and furrowing of the hitherto unbroken expanse,
they came to rest close beside.</p>

<p>Months before they had arrived from the North, weary with
buffeting the winds of seven thousand miles, the tip feathers of
their pinions broken, their muscles lean and stiff. But since then
there was rest and safety and love-making and rearing of young and
feeding on soft-shell fish and sweet, bulbous things with witch the
shore of the lagoon was bordered, and in this period the thin
bodies filled out, the worn feathers became smooth and lustrous,
and the strong mandibles grew hard and bright.</p>

<p>For a day they floated, listening intently for the mysterious
call they would instantly obey. There were two trumpeters,
snow-white save for the black tips to their wing feathers, black
mandibles and feet, and reddish eyes; four great dark birds,
blue-black and dun-coloured, with yellow eyes and thick, rough
mandibles that projected like lumps from their black skulls; and
two grey swans of a rusty white, with buff-yellow feet and breasts,
and beady eyes with black pupil and grey iris. In pairs they had
spent the past luxurious month, but now congregated, with crooning
and low, soft whistles and sharp trumpeting, for a brief and
communicative space.</p>

<p>It was the next night when the call came. There followed a
redoubled exchange in voices smooth and rough, and a series of
trial flights in which the blue-black leader spiralled high and
tested the wind that came, hot and oppressive, from the equator. At
his swiftly won elevation he caught innumerable whispers from the
South. Then the others climbed their five thousand feet into the
humid air, after which there were circlings, seemingly aimless, but
all dominated by the strange wisdom of the speechless. Finally the
leader swung off with a calm certitude in the beat of his mighty
pinions, and one by one the rest of the hurtling birds swerved into
a swaying wedge that, mounting higher and higher, threaded the thin
air with increasing speed.</p>

<p>In three hours they had traversed two hundred and fifty miles,
and were well out over the Caribbean, holding west of north and
paralleling the Lesser Antilles. At a height of two miles the air
was fresh and cool, and beneath the a vast plain of sea lay
crisping against the velvet of scattered islands in leagues of lacy
foam. By this time the wedge had taken up its appointed order, the
order it would hold for the Arctic. At the apex throbbed the black
leader, his long neck straight and stiff, his bright eyes half
sheathed against the whistling wind, his wings hollowed to the most
efficient curve, cutting his liquid way with unvarying velocity. At
his right flank flew his mate, and behind her the four swans,
trumpeter and grey. On the other side sped the great dun-coloured
birds, each flinging its pulsing body into the partial vacuum left
by its predecessor. Lifting under the press of upward currents,
dipping into air-pockets, yielding almost imperceptibly to the side
thrust of an unsteady wind, the streaming phalanx sped on with the
rhythmical throb of rapidly beating wings.</p>

<p>Five hundred miles from the South American coast a, tremor of
expectation ran through the flock. A little more and they would
begin a long slant that always ended beside a certain sheltered key
that lies between Guadeloupe and Porto Rico, a key beloved of
feathered voyagers at a season of the year. But just as the
extended necks craned downward there came out of the east an angry
gust, and mysteriously the air beneath them became full of ragged
clouds.</p>

<p>Instantly the pilot swung to the right, till, breasting the
first heralds of bad weather, he shot his sleek body against the
strengthening wind, testing its force and receiving in his tingling
ears quick, warning messages from the grey Atlantic. The wedge
followed him, with a little widening of formation, a little
slackening of effort till, assured of an approaching gale, the
master mariner of this viewless ocean struck up a swift incline
that lifted the flock to fifteen thousand feet. Then, supported, as
it were, by the upper fringes of the storm, he swerved westward and
laid his course for Haiti. Here, in a long bay on Enriquilla Lake,
the travellers rested. They had come a thousand miles in twelve
hours.</p>

<p>Now, of the jaunt across Cuba to the Floridian swamps, and of
the long but luxurious glide up the Gulf of Mexico to the marshes
of Alabama, it is not necessary to write, for day after day
innumerable leaders guide their kinsmen through these high and
uncharted spaces till the air above is as a travelled road. And
even by night-time, if the skies are clear and the winds
favourable, we may descry these distant pilgrims, their microscopic
bodies seemingly threading a hazardous way between the stars. But
when the dun-coloured swan saw the lights of Tampa on the horizon
he sent out a deep-throated "coo-whoo, coo-whoo," that rang like a
silver bugle, and was answered distantly by other and invisible
voyagers through the semi-tropical dusk, while all around him the
air was filled with the soft winnowing of tireless wings.</p>

<p>Disaster waited farther north. Remembering of old that at the
first Great Lake there was a place that made him nervous when he
passed over it at whatever height, the leader held to the west,
meaning to avoid the territory of great smoke and follow up the
west shore of Lake Michigan. But, fifty miles south of Chicago, he
ran into a gale that thrust him eastward. With it came a late
snowfall. Whirring through the grey plain of cloud, he mounted
above the blizzard to altitudes where the air was piercingly cold,
while the flock, stiff and weary after long flight, complained in
querulous voices that they would be compelled, and that soon, to
descend in an untested country.</p>

<p>Two hours afterward the leader craned his dark neck and slid
downward at a mile and a half a minute. Through a wrinkle in the
cloud he had caught a patch of grey, and since grey in springtime
means water, while black, at all times of the year, means danger,
he flung himself onward with utmost velocity. They skimmed over
woods, the branches of which were unseasonably white, and over a
wide, flat place where they passed directly above a brown speck
that saw them and barked furiously. At last, close underneath, was
the water, looking smooth and oily as the snowflakes touched it and
vanished.</p>

<p>That evening the great birds rested on the icy lake, their necks
double-curved close against their snow-covered shoulders, while the
dun pilot kept watch. He too was very tired, but his yellow eyes
stared unceasingly into the dark, and he swam slowly to and fro,
trailing his wide, webbed feet. A little later it appeared that the
snow thickened just in one direction. He moved toward this with
sudden suspicion, till when, quite close and fifty yards ahead of
the others, a dull knock sounded with startling distinctness.
Instantly he perceived danger, and with one shrill alarm dived
directly for the point of peril. Not two feet under the water, and
with his tail-feathers still exposed, he heard a noise like
thunder. Four times it came and with it flashes of red lightning.
At that he struck out more desperately, and, rising to the surface
behind the strange snowbank, clattered into the air. Then, mounting
a thousand feet, he flew round and round in swift and anxious
circles. But down below an excited farmer, after breaking the
beautiful neck of the pilot's crippled mate by the stroke of his
swinging oar, dragged her, with the twitching bodies of the two
remaining black swans, into the flat bottom of his cotton-shrouded
punt.</p>

<p>A week later the diminished wedge slackened its speed and slid
comfortably a few thousand feet to lower altitudes. Beneath them
the barren lands unfolded toward the Arctic, a country whose naked
ribs projected irregularly from the moss-covered surface, a vast
tundra of rocks, lakes and troubled rivers, smitten in winter by
hard winds that whistled from the pole, and for a brief summer
bursting into a wild opulence of flower and fruit. Here, in the
Athabasca area, was the home of the swans. On bare promontories
they lived or on tiny islets where the crystal waters lap close to
the nest, itself a few sticks or a wisp of grass lined with down
plucked from parental breasts. The dun-coloured leader had wedded
beside the lagoon of British Guiann, but his young had gone their
own way and left him lonely. Now, with strange memories of a bitter
and fatal life, he suddenly resigned his mastership, and,
quickening his pace, began a long and solitary patrol of the lonely
and rocky shore, while the others, trumpeter and grey, winged a
deliberate course to their own well-remembered quarters.</p>

<p>Presently the wanderer, sailing low, drifted over a nest where a
graceful black swan nestled close while her mate fished contentedly
in a nearby marsh. At the intruder's approach there set up a shrill
whistling that brought an infuriated bird to a vicious defence of
home and country. The battle that followed was Homeric, with a
fierce arching of sinewy necks, a sharp hissing from gaping
mandibles, and quick, deadly strokes of great, scythe-like wings.
The female did not move. It all seemed to her somehow quite
suitable that battle-royal be waged over her sleek person, so she
only ruffled her soft breast feathers, curved her neck into more
graceful lines than ever, and prepared to pay swan-like homage to
the victor. In another moment her mate lifted himself heavily into
the air. The dun-coloured pilot, still savage over the catastrophe
of the week before, was irresistible. Now he glanced redly at the
dwindling outline of the vanquished, and, with a triumphant flutter
of mighty wings and a deep, soft note of love in his blue-black
throat, marched exulting to his prize.</p>

<p>Then came lengthening and luxurious days during which the sun
grew warmer, and the wrens, finches, yellow-hammers, and all the
short-beaked and cross-beaked tribe fluttered, twittering, over the
land in dancing flights of wind-blown colour. Beneath the breast of
the brooding swan were two great, mottled, slaty eggs, over which
she spread a protecting body while she watched her captor swimming
nearby, jerking up swan-root with its sweet, carrot-shaped bulb,
and shell-fish, and, best of all, the pink shrimp that began to
drift in careless schools along the barren shore. At times he
winged slowly across the lake to a low point where assembled daily
that strangest of all Northern gatherings, the club or conclave of
male swans. Hither, from near and far, the great birds journeyed,
leaving their mates to domestic duties, and joined in a shrill and
strenuous symposium. Here too, by ancient law, might approach no
feminine visitor save she whom adversity or the kestrel hawk had
robbed of her husband. In this case she came, a prey to
unaccustomed loneliness, to select from the club members a second
spouse. And at her advent there was redoubled clamour and a
preening of lustrous feathers, till, with a whistle of relief, she
rose into the air and turned homeward with a flattered
companion.</p>

<p>By the end of June the cygnets were born, two naked and
shapeless things with gigantic, bony heads and angular wings that
bore sproutings of incipient quills. Over them the parents lavished
the gleanings of the lake, till their pink and quivering bodies
bulged with food. Now, too, was constant warfare with mink and
otter that crept, dripping, from the shore, and with white foxes,
tarnished to a dirty yellow, that made swift raids from scanty
cover. In the air there were hurried flights from wheeling hawks,
whose sharp beaks hovered perilously near the great birds'
defenceless backs, while carcajou, the wolverine, braved the
hissing mandibles for one gulp of a delicious and and featherless
morsel. Anxious weeks were these, but all the time the cygnets grew
larger and stronger, and their grotesque proportions became more
familiar, till, with young plumage half-developed, they swayed
uncertainly to the water's edge and found, to their amazement, that
they could swim.</p>

<p>The tension lessened after that, for each day added to their
powers. Simultaneously it seemed that the lake was wrinkled with
new broods of swan, geese and ducks. There were geese, grey and
white, the latter the clear-throated wavy that undulates so swiftly
in its flight; black ducks with heavy, barrel-like bodies and
short, strong wings; mallards in grey, green and scarlet; wood
duck, resplendent with crested cowls and shimmering, painted
breasts; blue teal, whose whirring course was bullet-like; widgeon,
whistlers, cranes, and great mergansers, with sharp-pointed bills
and saw-like teeth that caught fish and tossed them, glittering, in
the air. All through the day they talked, and far into the night,
and then, when sleep overtook them, the Northern loon unleashed his
weird laughter and flung it, echoing, to the stars. So for a space,
while the stiff earth relaxed her ageless limbs, the hot flare of
sun called forth a prodigal fertility of fruit and flower, and the
winged life of the Barren Lands approached its most strange and
perilous period.</p>

<p>In August the older birds began to moult, and before long lost
much of their winter plumage. This, wind-whipped and worn, had
never recovered from the stress of pilgrimage, and now the great
wing-feathers, one by one, were displaced by the prickly thrust of
new quills beneath the toughened skin. In this guise the swans
became doubly helpless. Flight was denied them, and only unceasing
care and a searching out of sheltered places saved them from the
assault of a multitude of enemies. They seemed a strangely hybrid
breed, leading a precarious existence on land and water, their garb
a motley patchwork through which their fat bodies showed
irregularly in islands of pink and roughened flesh. Then, in the
early autumn, when the hasty fruit of the North is at its fullest,
and when the wild things finding subsistence easy are indolent and
surfeited, the half-fledged birds began their journey to the
coast.</p>

<p>By land and water they travelled, here swimming, here waddling
strenuously with lumbering gait and taut, stretched, anxious necks.
Their skins were tingling with the new growth, that not yet could
carry them aloft, but deep in their flat skulls moved an ancient
wisdom. Not by fresh fruit and fresh-water food could they attain
the strength they would shortly need, when the message came from
the upper air, but only by the sharp sea taste of shell-fish from
the salt sands of the bitter water. Of no purport for a journey was
the soft flesh of mating-ant breeding-time, and it was not written
that a brooding swan might rise from her nest or her companion wing
straightway from his club and both reel off untiring leagues of
space. Thus, in the appointed hour, from tarn and lake, from
promontory, point and island, the half-feathered folk turned to
their life-giving mother, the sea. Toward her they flowed in an
ever-increasing stream, choosing hidden paths where, defenceless,
they pushed through narrow lanes of grey caribou moss or among
sparse growths, that the white fox, peering from his hole, might
not descry their arduous passage. In scanty thickets the wood
buffalo raised his blunt and shaggy head, and often, across the
far-flung tundra, they saw vast herds carpeting the plain, with
multitudes of round, barrel-like bodies, while on the skyline the
grey wolf stalked in restless patrol, waiting for the deer that,
outcast by age or disease, would inevitably fall to his merciless
jaws.</p>

<p>But long ere the journey was ended the old swans' wing-leathers
were full grown, and the cygnets had mastered the first elements of
flight. The latter travelled unevenly in bursts of speed that ended
with abrupt bumps on the moss-covered plain, while their parents
circled overhead, uttering warning and encouraging cries. A
delightful procession this, with the thin air Like wine, with the
barren lands mapped below, stretching in dwindling miles out of
sight, and the call of the sea sounding ever more clearly across
the horizon. In it the young birds were taught many things that
pertained to their amazing art: how to glide from beneath the swoop
of the Northern kite&mdash;for the swan is, above all fliers,
defenceless; how to dive in the green water and change course the
moment one's tail-feathers were out of sight; how to take cover so
that one's long neck did not project with uncomfortable
distinction. There were feastings, too, on ripe cranberries that
shone in scarlet clusters along the creek bottoms, and on
blueberries, sweet and purple, where often they found the black
bear sitting on his haunches, while his forearms gathered the laden
hushes to his hairy breast. So eastward they fared, convoyed by
other flocks, whose mingled salutations rang cheerily through the
hollow skies, till on a day there came a sharpness in the
atmosphere and beneath them lay the grey shield of the Northern
Ocean, rimmed by endless leagues of glistening and mud-coloured
shore.</p>

<p>Here, it seemed, the life of the North had congregated for that
brief but luxurious period which precedes the frost. The polar bear
buried his sharp snout in the quivering side of a white whale
stranded by the lowering tide, and, at a little distance, loitered
the grey wolves till the masters of the North be satisfied. Behind
the wolves peered the bright pink eyes of the Arctic fox,
scavengers of the shore, and still farther down the scale the mink
and marten bided their time till their soft pads might sink unnoted
toward the feast. Divers and loons fished continually, and the
broad-billed tribes thrust their mandibles into delicious heaps of
seaweed, finding crabs and sea-worms, the very taste of which
filled the hungry birds with strange and sudden yearnings for
flight. Over the flat waters wheeled flocks of gulls, while,
farther out, the rounded back of the rorqual glinted in the sun, or
a school of speeding porpoise flashed into the air, sprinkling
diamonds of prismatic light. Life was here, young life, bursting
with crescent power that flushed and surged, growing stronger and
more riotous ere it should join the stern test that would begin
with the first whirring flakes of snow.</p>

<p>The season drew on. By night and day rose the clamour of the
feathered folk, for in these proving grounds soft muscles were
growing tough and strong, and the fat crops that so late were
stuffed with fruit now became cleansed and hard with salt sand,
whereby the marvellous digestion of the broad-billed people is
attained. Short beaks and cross-beaks had long since disappeared,
and there was left nothing that twittered or sang. Old pilots, wise
of wind and weather, mounted high, and after them streamed
inconsequent flocks of young birds, ignorant of the law and
rejoicing in new-found powers. Far up, where the air was thin, they
followed, only to discover that youth had much to learn and these
latitudes were full of invisible forces that buffeted and played
with them, dropping them into pockets and tilting them with savage
gusts till, weary of the sport, they sank earthward with wild and
raucous protests, while their leaders sailed, serene and unshaken,
in the zenith. But gradually these excursions took on definite
form. Youth learned experience, and instinct asserted its rule.
Three weeks after the dun-coloured leader reached salt water, the
teeming populace of the shore was ready to migrate.</p>

<p>It happened that this was a year of false alarms, in which the
chill breath of the North was intermittent and gave way, as though
relenting, to successive days of sunshine and warmth. Once and
again the great black swan, mounting high into the uncertain
air-lanes, and deciding that the hour had come, had marshalled his
pointed squadron, only to be baffled by lenient breezes that crept
up from the South. But when night fell there was a tightening along
the shore and a glint on the pools that he marked with blinking eye
and tested with his webbed feet. On one of these mornings the ducks
departed, and, as silence set in, he listened tensely for that
first unmistakable message of the Arctic.</p>

<p>Presently it came, with a little shifting of the wind and a
little shudder from the sea. The grey waters took on an aspect
empty and bleak, while the ripples that crisped the margin of the
bay seemed to have become almost metallic. The surface of the water
ceased to reflect the low-lying clouds, and stretched, dull and
burnished, with strange suggestions of molten fluid. Then, as
though loosed by dainty, invisible fingers, there danced from the
North a few flakes of starry snow.</p>

<p>Hardly had they reached him, when there fell upon the hooded ear
of the black swan a fine and steady drone. At that he waited no
more, but, clattering upward, flung a signal to the little group of
voyagers whose long necks and bright eyes had turned to him
inquiringly for days past. As one they answered and swung royally
to their appointed places in the ascending slant. Two miles above
the sea the pilot wheeled twice, quickening his pace in magnificent
circles, till, poising for an instant at Olympian heights, this
wise and valiant bird gathered the winds of Aeolus into the booming
curve of his mighty pinions and struck off on the superb line of
his long, uncharted course.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>THE BLINDNESS OF PITULUK</h2>

<p>Steering north by west up Baffin's Strait, and passing Amadjauk
Harbour on the east, with Salisbury Island well into the south, you
will make Cape Dorset. That is, if you are weather-wise and succeed
in bucking through the ice-pack. Farther north comes the big bend
that turns into Fox Channel&mdash;and so to Greenland waters.</p>

<p>From the naked ribs of Baffin Land, Cape Dorset thrusts a
gigantic thumb into the cool, green ocean. Past its rubbed and
fretted apex streams annually a great procession, belched,
grinding, from the Arctic. Month after month it ramps by, broken
occasionally into pond-like gaps where the square flipper suns
himself on the trembling floe, and the dark-eyed jar seal falls
prey to white bears marooned and adrift on the tumbled plain.</p>

<p>At all this, Pituluk, a lean Husky, had gazed calmly far years.
In winter his igloo huddled low in a wrinkle of the shore. In
summer his topeck crowned a little ridge from which the water ran
both ways when it rained. And with him lived Tuktu, the Caribou,
and Kugyiyuh, the Swan.</p>

<p>They were old, friendless and decrepit, but not in any way
impressed by the fact that they owed these declining years to the
good nature of Pituluk. Tuktu was lame and had a withered arm and a
nasty, complaining temper; while Kugyiyuk, even older than her
husband, was something like a piece of sinew that has been left out
in the sun. What Pituluk, a large, easygoing man, gave them they
took as if it were a right, and when food was scanty, as not
infrequently happened, they bombarded him with complaint and
criticism that seemed to slide like drops of rain from his oily
skin.</p>

<p>Kugyiyuk had black eyes that shifted as though greased in their
sockets, and stumps of ancient, rusty teeth whose strength had long
since vanished with much tugging at sinew and gnawing at the edges
of walrus-hides.</p>

<p>In the warm weather Pituluk fished for salmon, and shot white
foxes as they feasted on dead whales driven ashore by the run of
Arctic currents. Sometimes he faced a she-bear that lounged forth,
lean and vicious, with the cub she had suckled for months in a
snow-covered crevice. There was no difficulty about summer. The
caribou were fat, and his guests better tempered.</p>

<p>But when winter arrived with Unorri, the North Wind, both land
and sea tightened up like the snapping of the lock in a Hudson Bay
musket, and the ragged outlines of beach and ridge were smoothed
down and plastered over. As soon as he could find packed snow,
Pituluk built his igloo, and then began the long yearly struggle
against the gods of the out-of-doors. The foxes lost the mangy,
blue tinge of earlier months, becoming blanched like ice and hard
to see. The salmon backed into deep water. The caribou retreated
inland, and the square flipper came up to breathe in places not
easy to find. And when one walked abroad, it often happened that
one saw only the great form of a solitary he-bear, rocking his
arrow-shaped head as he stalked out to the edge of the ice to
fish.</p>

<p>In such times Tuktu and Kugyiyuk were hard to live with. The old
woman reckoned her years by the number of times she had seen the
pack-ice march down from Boothia Gulf. Seventy-five times she made
it. Tuktu was nearly as old. Staring at them as he sat on the snow
ledge of his house, mending a spear, Pituluk wondered why the aged
should become so cross. They had nothing to do but eat and sleep.
He did not mind their ugliness, for somehow that fitted into
everything else. But to be scolded through most of the short days
of summer and through half of the much longer nights of winter had
begun to wear into him, just as a badly sewn seal boot will wear
the skin off one's instep.</p>

<p>If he were asked why under these circumstances he continued to
shelter this thankless couple, Pituluk could not have told you. It
may have been that he had not moral courage to discard them to
death, but&mdash;much more likely&mdash;-it was because the law of
the North provides that what is enough for one can generally he
made sufficient for two, and even for three at a pinch. Also these
was the probability that, if he did turn them out, he would meet
them later on in the place where there is always plenty of food,
and be faced with accusation as well as complaint.</p>

<p>It fell on a hard day when Pituluk returned from a fruitless
tramp over leagues of tumbled ice, where the wind drove the drift
snow stinging into his face, that his eyes were very hot and sore.
At this he was a little anxious, and regained the igloo with
nothing but two patches of frost-bite to show for his work.
Kugyiyuk waited impatiently when she heard him crawling along the
low tunnel. Presently she turned to Tuktu, who was chewing steadily
at the last strip of seal-meat.</p>

<p>"Again he has nothing."</p>

<p>Tuktu, to make sure, paused till the hooded head pushed through.
He saw that the old woman was right and chewed the faster.</p>

<p>"So many times he comes&mdash;and with nothing."</p>

<p>Pituluk cleared the tunnel and, throwing back his hood, put his
hand into a stone bowl. This sat over a single spear-head of flame
rising from a stone lamp. Dipping up water. he bathed his eyes.</p>

<p>"I saw but one caribou&mdash;a coast caribou. It was too far. My
eyes are sick. It is the blindness that comes."</p>

<p>Tuktu laughed harshly. "What difference will that make to your
hunting?"</p>

<p>Pituluk closed his burning lids, then opened them because they
smarted the more.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will make a difference to you. It is not many months
since you have complained and called me a fool. Why then should you
care if I stop hunting?"</p>

<p>Tuktu was nearing the end of his strip. "I did not know," he
said, with a glance at the spear balanced against the curving
wall&mdash;"I did not know that you had begun, to hunt."</p>

<p>Pituluk did not answer, having just discovered that he could
neither open nor close his eyes without hurting himself. He
remembered thankfully that he had buried the dogs' harness and
stamped it tight in the snow. That was all right. The dogs could
get along very well for a few days till his eyes were better.</p>

<p>As for the others, he only chuckled and blinked at the two
shapeless forms working into their caribou-skin bags. He would blow
out the lamp presently and, placing flint and punk in a safe place,
crawl into his own. There he would lie for a while, listening to
the drone of cracked voices, while the wind pressed hard on the
igloo roof, and far out in Fox Channel the sea ice creaked all
night long. He did not rest much. Then, he could not tell at what
time, he heard Tuktu speak sharply:</p>

<p>"He sleeps better than he hunts."</p>

<p>Pituluk tried to open his eyes, but the lids were fastened down
with a sticky stuff that clung to his fingers when he touched it,
and the pain was worse than ever. He felt the two looking at him,
and sat up.</p>

<p>"Blindness has come in my sleep."</p>

<p>Kugyiyuk struck fire, lit the lamp, and bent over him. All she
could see of Pituluk's eyes were two narrow slits full of something
that looked like frozen blubber, only it was soft. She beckoned to
Tuktu.</p>

<p>"It is true. He is blind."</p>

<p>The hunter moved despairingly. She looked at him again, then got
back on to the ledge, where she and the old man whispered, their
glistening faces close together. Presently Tuktu also inspected the
Sick man.</p>

<p>"Water," groaned Pituluk, "bring it to me&mdash;I cannot
see."</p>

<p>Kugyiyuk slid down. The big man had begun to feel his way across
to the stone bowl. She reached ahead of him, and handed it quickly
to Tuktu.</p>

<p>"There is no water."</p>

<p>"In the night I was thirsty and drank," quavered her husband. He
set the bowl behind him and covered it with a robe.</p>

<p>Pituluk tried to think of the words he once heard a whaling
captain use when he was very angry. They struck him at the time as
good words, and there was nothing in the Husky language to express
what a whaling captain seemed to feel so often. He could not
remember them. Nevertheless, he knew there was water in that igloo.
A little later, when the two went out, he tried to make fire and
melt some for himself. But he only hit his fingers with the flint.
He was sorry now that he had not built the igloo out on the ice,
even though the wind was worse, because he could have fished
through the floor. His grandfather, being also blind, had caught
many fish. Then he was more than ever convinced there was water
near, and, fumbling about, touched the bowl under the robe. It was
already halt-frozen, but a good drink still remained. He drained
it, put the bowl aside, and groped back. The water lay cold on his
stomach, but he felt hot and very angry.</p>

<p>Outside, at a little distance, Tuktu and Kugyiyuk shivered
behind a cairn of stones and talked earnestly.</p>

<p>"I am not sorry that he is blind," said the latter, "and perhaps
he will never see again. Then we can take what he has and, being
rich, will go and live with the tribe at Amadjauk Harbour. It is
many years now since Pituluk got angry about that girl and came
away."</p>

<p>Tuktu nodded. "When I was in Amadjauk Harbour I saw a box that
had a devil in it, and, making sound, talked like a white man. The
box is still there, but the devil is asleep and silent. Sulkenlulug
saw it last summer; I would like to hear that."</p>

<p>She glanced at the igloo, of which the ivory dome was just
visible. "You will hear it without doubt. How long can a man live
without food?"</p>

<p>"If he be fat, for some time, but if he be cold and thin, not so
long. I do not want to see Pituluk die."</p>

<p>"We shall not be there. To-morrow we shall try to kill
something, but he must not know if we have meat."</p>

<p>"The smell of a hungry man is sharp," said Tuktu dubiously.</p>

<p>"There will be nothing in the igloo to smell," she grunted.</p>

<p>They went back and found the hunter feeling his spear, running
his fingers along its coil of rawhide. Where his eyes used to be
were two lines of sticky white.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry," he said dully.</p>

<p>Kugyiyuk's beady gaze rested on his brown, sightless face. She
could just see it in the faint flicker of the lamp.</p>

<p>"That is nothing&mdash;we are all hungry."</p>

<p>Pituluk's lips lifted. "Do we die here&mdash;all of us?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," put in Tuktu, "we should have starved in any
case."</p>

<p>The blind man stumbled to the mouth of the tunnel and stretched
himself across it. "Then we shall die together."</p>

<p>For the next few hours it was very quiet in the igloo. The grey
of the sky faded, to be succeeded by a sparkling light of intense
cold. Stiffer grew the frost, till the very bones of the hidden
earth seemed to shiver and contract. Across the field ice, sharp
cannon-like reports zig-zagged out to open water, while the split
floes crumpled into irregular ridges of irresistible expansion. The
sky, ineffably high and clear, was sown with a host of
diamond-pointed lights that became pallid against the curtain of
green and yellow flame that hung palpitating in the north. With a
low whining, the dogs scratched deeper, till, curled into balls of
fur, each lay in his own pit beneath the surface of the driven
snow. It was all hard-bitten, bleak and unutterably grim, and only
on the far expanse of open sea was there any semblance of life or
movement.</p>

<p>Hours later something did move on the ridge behind the igloo,
and for a moment a great shape with narrow skull, long lean body
and huge flat paws was outlined against the sky. It stood, gaunt
and menacing, swaying its white head, gathering into its black
nostrils whatever faint odour might be abroad on that crisping
night.</p>

<p>A dog stirred in his pit, thrusting a nose into the nipping
frost, while the long hair lifted on his spine. For a second he
waited thus with every mysterious instinct thrilling in his chilled
body. Then the nose lifted higher, and he flung his signal to the
moon. Another dog took it up&mdash;and another. Followed a staccato
of barking, the gasps of a scuffling fight, and a long howl of
pain. Pituluk woke with a start, for the sound of scratching of
mighty claws came through the igloo wall. The brute had smelled its
window of walrus membrane and, beating off the dogs, was scaling
the icy dome.</p>

<p>Tuktu slid down from his shelf, seized the spear, and began to
stab weakly upwards. A wide paw crashed through. In the gap,
against the twinkling stars, he saw the menacing head and shaggy
throat.</p>

<p>"He will break the roof," he panted; "quick&mdash;the bow and
arrows&mdash;-very quickly!"</p>

<p>Kugyiyuk snatched them up, trembling, and fitted a shaft to the
taut sinew; but there was no strength in her arm. The tough wood
defied her.</p>

<p>"Give it to Pituluk," croaked Tuktu.</p>

<p>"Can a blind man fight with a bear?" groaned the latter, not
caring much whether he died or not.</p>

<p>"Pull&mdash;-and I will guide you." Kugyiyuk thrust the weapon
into his hands. "Pull! In a minute he will come through."</p>

<p>Pituluk's fingers crooked round the cord.</p>

<p>"Then it will be as you said," he answered grimly, "but I am
glad to shoot once again before I die." The arrow-head came back
flush with the belly of the bow. A strong man was Pituluk, even in
his blindness.</p>

<p>"To the left!" screamed Kugyiyuk. "No, that is too
much&mdash;-now!"</p>

<p>The sinew twanged and simultaneously the great paw was
withdrawn. Tuktu could see the savage head twist round, then the
bear slithered down, his claws scraping deep grooves in the wall.
As he touched the ground there was a storm of frenzied barking, the
snap of locking jaws and a deep angry cough. This dwindled
gradually till there came silence.</p>

<p>Kugyiyuk breathed hard. "He is gone&mdash;we are safe."</p>

<p>Pituluk nodded. "Now we can die quietly."</p>

<p>Next morning, when the world was very dark to the hunter, the
two ancient ones went out and laid their fingers in the
grooves.</p>

<p>"He was a big bear," said Tuktu regretfully, "and without doubt
there was much meat on him."</p>

<p>Kugyiyuk did not answer. She was staring at a dog that lurched
toward them, his belly bulging. He licked his long jaws
contentedly. Her eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"There is meat. Come!"</p>

<p>They followed the trail a few hundred yards to higher ground.
There they found him, a broken arrow projecting from his throat,
flanks and side torn and gaping, a great beast from whose bones
half the flesh had been ripped by wild, sharp fangs. It was not
only dogs that had feasted there, and the meat could not last much
longer.</p>

<p>Tuktu chuckled. "There is enough left for such as us. See, we
will not take it into the igloo, but keep it here under the stones.
We will eat outside where Pituluk cannot hear us."</p>

<p>They ate as dogs eat, champing the tom flesh with rusty teeth:
then, piling rocks on what remained, went back to the igloo.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" demanded Pituluk suspiciously.</p>

<p>"To look for the bear."</p>

<p>"And you did not find him?"</p>

<p>"Would I not have brought you meat if we had found it?" replied
Tuktu.</p>

<p>Pituluk said nothing, but he was aware of a difference he did
not understand. Thinking very hard, it seemed that Tuktu's voice
was rounder and fuller than before. By now the gnawing in his own
stomach was such that he could not sleep. The others, however, did
sleep. He whispered to them several times, and got no answer. Also
it had struck him that they did not move slowly and painfully any
more, like hungry people. They spoke as they always spoke, while he
noticed the crack in his own voice. So he lay still for another
day.</p>

<p>Then, whispering again to make sure that they slept, he felt his
way out through the tunnel. By this time he was very weak, but his
eyes did not seem so sticky, and, lifting the lids apart with his
fingers, he thought he saw something yellow. Stooping, he found
this to be the snow. Winking very hard, the film over his sight
lifted a little, and he just made out a narrow trail, tramped deep,
that led up the hill. Stumbling along this, he came to a pile of
stones.</p>

<p>An hour later, Tuktu sat up suddenly and yawned.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It is nothing," said the hunter. "I went out to find if I could
perhaps see, but everything is black."</p>

<p>Tuktu grinned horribly in the dark. It would not be long
now.</p>

<p>Pituluk's voice came in again: "To-morrow let us go to the edge
of the ice, where perhaps you can kill a seal."</p>

<p>"It is too rough for a blind man."</p>

<p>"Then you will lead me. It is for the last time, and I will not
ask anything more."</p>

<p>Night passed. A block of clear ice had replaced the torn
membrane in the roof, and through this there filtered a pale green
light in which the hunter could make out two shapeless mounds that
snored steadily for hours. As to Kugyiyuk, he did not care much.
She was only an old woman, and therefore an old fool with the soul
of a fox from which not much could be expected. But with Tuktu it
was different. Here was a man who himself had once been a hunter,
and was now prepared to look on, his belly full, while another
hunter starved. Pituluk didn't think about the ingratitude of it so
much as that Tuktu had written himself down as an outcast from the
tribes of men.</p>

<p>That was it. An outcast! So Pituluk reached for the spear and
re-coiled the rawhide line. The meat in his stomach had thawed, and
he experienced sharp pains. But he was glad of them.</p>

<p>About noon, when the sun had mounted to the topmost point of its
flat arc, they set out for the edge of the ice. Tuktu went first,
then Kugyiyuk, and lastly the hunter, who had stubbornly insisted
on carrying the spear and line. "Let him carry it," thought the
others. In his left hand he held one end of a thong at which the
old woman jerked impatiently. It was a foolish trip, she decided,
for one about to die. But as Pituluk peered through the narrow slit
between his lids, the snow did not look yellow any longer. It was
very familiar, and staring white. Darting swift and unobserved
glances, he found that vision had returned. There was still
stickiness about his eyes, but he did not wipe it off, and stumbled
on, complaining weakly. Presently they came to open water.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Tuktu, "if Pituluk could only see now!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded the hunter.</p>

<p>"A white whale and her calf. There is much meat and they are
very close. I would that my arm were not withered, or I could feed
you well for many weeks."</p>

<p>But Pituluk had seen. Just against the ice floated a small whale
fifteen feet long, the green water surging lazily on its smooth and
shining back. It lay languid and was lifted, glistening in the
emerald heave of the sea. Beside it pressed a calf, like a fragment
detached from the mother floe, while intermittently came the deep
and whistling breath that shot a slim and sparkling fountain into
the air. "Ah-hoo-nah, ah-hoo-nah," the great fish seemed to sigh,
and saw them not.</p>

<p>A thrill ran through Pituluk. "Am I near enough to throw my
spear ?" he asked unsteadily.</p>

<p>Tuktu smiled coldly. "It matters not. Throw it!"</p>

<p>"How far is the whale?" The hunter's brown fingers closed over
the short, straight shaft, and he shook the coiled line so that its
loops hung free.</p>

<p>"Half a spear-throw only; but why risk this when you cannot see?
Do not hit the mother or you will lose both spear and line when she
dives. It is better that I try, and not you."</p>

<p>But Pituluk had raised himself on the balls of his feet and was
balanced tensely. Through the slit in his lids the length of the
larger whale shone clear and glaring white. He stiffened for the
throw, and the anger and contempt and hot hunger for revenge that
boiled in him burst forth in a great shout.</p>

<p>"I am very ready to lose them, 0 Tuktu, with the heart of a
wolf! Be thou ready to lose more!"</p>

<p>The shaft streaked forward, and as the point sank through he
flipped the swinging coils into the air. They fell neatly over
Tuktu's shoulders. The green water swirled violently as the great
whale body flashed downwards. The whale's ivory shape glimmered for
an instant. Then the line tightened, and in a flash Tuktu was
snatched forward and twitched into the depths. In another second
the tail of the line squirmed over the edge.</p>

<p>Pituluk stared at the bubbles contentedly.</p>

<p>"Let us go back to that pile of stones; I am very hungry."</p>

<p>The white whales still cruise up and down Fox Channel, passing
on into Boothia Gulf and the Arctic. From topeck and igloo the
small brown people watch them, and when they see beside the larger
bulk the shining body of a calf, they chuckle to themselves and
say, "It is Tuktu." And when the sparkling jet springs into the
light, and the sound of blowing comes across the heaving water,
they look at one another.</p>

<p>"Ah-hoo-nah, a-hoo-nah," they repeat. "It is Tuktu, who asks to
be forgiven, down among the salmon."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>THE MAGIC OF KAHDOOSH</h2>

<p>Kahdoosh, the Man with a Nose like a Bottle, sat on a flat stone
that happened to be on the west coast of Greenland, and stared
gloomily at a cluster of topecks huddled on a strip of ground near
the shore. The sun was bright and very hot. He scrutinised a pack
of mangy dogs hunting for offal along the edge of the sea, saw a
group of women go off in the oomiak, or skin boat, screaming with
laughter and a great splashing of paddles, and noted with cold and
critical gaze that Larpan, the Cross-eyed One, had got into his
kayack. He was going to the rocky islands two miles away over the
emerald water to determine whether the walrus had yet arrived.</p>

<p>Watching the dipping stroke of double blades that flashed like
mirrors in the sun, Kahdoosh felt more than ever a violent
antipathy to Larpan. The immediate cause of this was Peegish, the
Chatterer, a cylindrical maiden of nineteen years. Again the
eternal triangle. What need to point out that whether in Greenland
or Tooting, whether beneath silk or caribou-skin, the human heart
aspires with the same longings, throbs with the same profound
passion? Tooting may be more voluble than Greenland, but it can
harbour no deeper emotions. The Thames Embankment may be more
impressive than the rocky waste in which Peegish was acknowledged
to be the leading flapper, but no lover ever leaned on its massive
parapet and gazed more moodily at Chelsea Bridge than Kahdoosh now
gazed at his particular section of the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>The situation had grown acute. It is probable that had the tribe
of Kahdoosh lived, say, on the Beaufort Sea, where things are more
primitive and old-fashioned, and whaling-ships seldom penetrate,
the matter would have been settled months ago in a, practical and
expeditious manner. But here, in Greenland waters, one was, so to
speak, on the fringes of society. It was nothing novel that a
Dundee whaler should slide like a ghost into the bay, and drop
anchor with a roar of chain that roused the birds for a mile round.
Then there were visits on both sides, and as often as not some of
the men joined up for the cruise, returning later with wealth, and
new rifles, a much enlarged and decorated vocabulary and a general
air of superiority that the others sometimes found a trifle
irritating.</p>

<p>In the case of Larpan, who bad made one such voyage, the trouble
was that he then acquired an even more full equipment, having come
back nothing short of a full-blown magician. This excited a vast
amount of interest and amusement, and the first soiree he gave was
in the topeck of Hadjvick, the Man who Lurched when he Walked.
Hadjvick was the father of Peegish, and that damsel, with much
giggling and flashing of black eyes, was in the front row.
Kahdoosh, as not infrequently in such cases, lounged somewhat
superciliously at the back against the skin wall.</p>

<p>Larpan began by pulling a red cotton handkerchief from the back
of Hadjvick's neck, and accumulated a pile of rabbit's feet from
various members of the audience, all of whom disclaimed the
possession of such valueless articles. Then he uncovered the skull
of a jar seal between the feet of Chantook, the Fat Man, who stared
at the thing incredulously amid shouts of laughter. With an
insolent glint in his eye, he called up Kahdoosh, and drew from his
pocket a metal mirror used exclusively by the women. This made
Kahdoosh very hot and angry, for he knew he looked like a fool.
Finally, the slant-eyed Peegish herself was summoned, and her
well-oiled hair yielded a large collection of walrus-teeth, while
that young woman gave a series of little shrieks of admiring
surprise, each one of them a dagger in the heart of Kahdoosh. It is
true that at the beginning of the performance the figure of Larpan
was noticeably bulky, and, later, of merely average girth, but
Kahdoosh could not summon courage to call attention to the fact.
Magic was magic! The public had no desire to investigate second
causes. Without question it was Larpan's night of triumph.</p>

<p>That was a week ago, and Peegish enjoyed the present state of
affairs immensely. To be desired by two men, both of prominence in
the tribe, meant much to any girl in Greenland. Larpan was a little
the older, also not quite as well off as Kahdoosh, but he had
unquestionable resources. Also he was better tempered. Kahdoosh, on
the other hand, was a great hunter. He did not laugh so much, but
in hard times might make a safer partner. Hadjvick pointed out
these things, and asked the girl what she was going to do.</p>

<p>"For another six months," he concluded, "I will feed
you&mdash;but no more. If you have not chosen by then, I will
choose for you. I have spoken."</p>

<p>"Which will you choose?" asked Peegish thoughtfully.</p>

<p>He threw a stone at a dog. "There was once a woman of our tribe
who, being a fool like all women, married a magician because he did
wonderful things. In the middle of the first bad winter it happened
that he could not kill anything, and she starved to death. His
magic could not get through the fur of a single seal."</p>

<p>Peegish smiled. "Has then a woman no magic of her own?"</p>

<p>"Enough to make wise men at times very foolish, but not enough
to make a foolish man wise. The tongue that is always travelling
never arrives. As for these two men, it may be that I will give you
to the one who makes the greatest magic in six months from
now."</p>

<p>"The fingers of Kahdoosh are not long and clever like those of
Larpan."</p>

<p>Hadjvick grunted. "Again how like a woman, Is it not the head
that directs the fingers? It is well that you tell them both what I
say, and in six months we shall see."</p>

<p>Peegish did tell them, with sidelong looks and much digging of a
blunt seal-shed foot into the stony soil of Greenland. Then she
told everyone in the village. Larpan heard it, smiling, confident
and determined to surpass all previous achievements in the way of
illusion. Kahdoosh heard it, glum, frowning, with a distant desire
for murder in his heart, knowing very well that, practise as he
might, he could never bring the skull of a seal out of the ground,
or walrus-teeth from a girl's hair. Magic! What had he to do with
magic?</p>

<p>All this and a good deal more was in his mind when, sitting on
the rock, he observed on the horizon a white speck that he knew to
be not a gull's wing but the foresail of a whaler. He watched her
grow till the crumpled wave at her stem was visible. She came on
into the mouth of the bay and anchored a quarter-mile out.
Kahdoosh, staring, remembered that on such a ship as this Larpan
had learned his tricks. He wondered if there was any magic on this
vessel. Then he saw that Larpan's kayack had altered its course and
was headed for the whaler.</p>

<p>Something darted through his brain. He jumped up, dashed bulkily
down-hill, and a moment later was driving his own kayack over the
smooth water with quick, vicious strokes. He reached the vessel's
side at the instant when Larpan caught the tail-end of a rope.</p>

<p>Macgovvan, the captain, a hard-bitten sailor who had killed
whales from the Falklands to Spitzbergen, looked keenly at the two.
He wanted only one man, and it was difficult to choose. The obvious
strength of Kahdoosh was in his favour, but Larpan looked the
quicker of them. And both wanted to go. Kahdoosh waited, thinking
rapidly. Presently he made a gesture.</p>

<p>"I am a better hunter than Larpan," he said gravely, "but not so
great a man."</p>

<p>His rival stared, while Macgovan glanced at him curiously.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I am only a hunter, but he is a maker of magic."</p>

<p>" Eh?" grunted Macgovan. "What kind of magic?"</p>

<p>"Show him," said Kahdoosh.</p>

<p>Larpan was bursting with pride. What an astonishing tribute, he
thought&mdash;and at a time like this! Hastily he borrowed a
penknife from the cook and a plug of tobacco from the first mate,
and brought them both out of Macgovan's ears. The latter perhaps
was impressed, but it was hard to say what went on behind a face
like his. Larpan rolled his eyes around the grinning circle of the
crew, borrowed more articles, and surpassed himself.</p>

<p>"That is nothing," he said modestly; "I can do much more, but it
takes time. Much thought have I given to these things."</p>

<p>"It's enough," snapped Macgovan abruptly. "You're no hunter, but
a conjurer." He turned to Kahdoosh. "Can you do any of these
tricks?"</p>

<p>The big Husky shook his head. "I am not clever enough. I can
only hunt."</p>

<p>"Then you're the man for me. Come on board in one hour. Now off
with both of you."</p>

<p>The two paddled shoreward without a word. "Not clever enough!"
thought Larpan to himself. "Not clever enough!"</p>

<p>Kahdoosh, having no packing to do, used a good deal of that hour
talking to Peegish. No details had come out, and for his side of it
Larpan would see that they didn't, but it was already known in the
village that both men had wanted that job, and Kahdoosh had got it.
Peegish learned a good deal more when Kahdoosh asked her to wait,
just as they ask in Clapham and Mount Street.</p>

<p>"I go for the whale-hunting," he said earnestly, "and it may be
I shall go farther, not coming again till the ice moves in the
spring."</p>

<p>Peegish was impressed by the look in his eyes, but there was her
father to reckon with.</p>

<p>"Why so long?"</p>

<p>"Because it is in my mind that there is a greater magic than
that of Larpan, which deals only with childish things. It is that I
seek, and maybe it is not to be found on any whaler. If this be so,
then I go to the place where the whaler came from and seek
there."</p>

<p>The black eyes surveyed him with sudden respect.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if you did not go you might have me anyway."</p>

<p>Kahdoosh took a long breath. "That is well, but Larpan found a
woman's glass in my pocket, and till I have made him a greater fool
than I was then, I shall not be content. If on the other hand you
desire this man, why not take him?"</p>

<p>This was a totally new angle for Peegish. To be told in so many
words that she might marry Larpan if she wished, and be hanged to
her, invested Kahdoosh with an entirely novel interest. No man had
ever spoken to her like that before. And since the psychology of
the feminine heart is the same on the western coast of Greenland
as, say, on the shores of the Mediterranean, she liked him better
than ever. Also, she reflected, Larpan would help to pass the
time.</p>

<p>"It is well," she said softly, "and I will speak to Hadjvick. It
may be that he will feed me till the ice moves."</p>

<p>She told the latter when he was watching the whaler clear the
month of the bay. He listened, nodded, but never took his eyes from
the ship.</p>

<p>"Then let it be till the ice moves," he said dryly. "And it is
in my mind that one head is better than many long and clever
fingers."</p>

<p>Now of that trip, and the adventures which befell Kahdoosh, it
is not necessary to write, such doings being known to many even of
those who go not out in ships. There was the grind and hardship and
sleet that cut to the bone, and death close at hand many a time.
There was the flight of the harpoon, the plunging leviathan, the
breathless pursuit with the line tight as a banjo-string over the
bow, the death of leviathan, the whaler coming up to the kill like
a homing gull, the flenching and rendering&mdash;and then the whole
thing over again. Kahdoosh liked it all and never complained and,
because he felt best when well oiled, was as strong as two horses,
had no nerves, and eyes like a cormorant, he found much favour with
Macgovan, who knew good stuff when it came his way.</p>

<p>It fell on a morning when the whaler lay becalmed, that
Kahdoosh, who lounged amidships, heard voices in the
galley&mdash;that is the cook was whistling and another singing.
This was very strange, as the former seemed to be alone. Presently
he came out, spat over the rail and passed the time of day. The
voice, however, continued. It was something like Macgovan's.
Kahdoosh stared, and when the cook went forward he peered in
through the galley window. No one there! Still the voice! At this
his stomach rolled over inside him.</p>

<p>The cook, returning, found him gripping the rail, his whole body
stiff.</p>

<p>"What's the matter wi' ye, Dooshy?"</p>

<p>"Many things. There is a devil on this ship."</p>

<p>"What are ye talkin' about, ye big loon?"</p>

<p>Kahdoosh held up a warning hand. "Listen!"</p>

<p>From the galley drifted the voice: "I lo'e a lassie, a bonnie
Hielan' lassie."</p>

<p>"What is it that speaks without a mouth? No man is there. Is
this magic?"</p>

<p>Cookie grinned, hooked his arm and steered him, unwilling, to
the galley door.</p>

<p>"It's naethin' but a bit box that the sound comes out of. Look
under yon table."</p>

<p>Kahdoosh looked very hard, and his lips felt dry. The box wasn't
much bigger than his head. Something in it was going round and
round. This stopped with the noise that a dog makes when he
scratches the ice. The voice ceased.</p>

<p>"The devil is dead," he said thickly.</p>

<p>"Aye, that one. Now we'll try another."</p>

<p>For the next quarter-hour cookie enjoyed the study of the pagan
face, while the black eyes never blinked and marvellous thoughts
darted rapidly through that savage brain. Undoubtedly great magic,
this! Greater by far than Larpan ever dreamed of.</p>

<p>"The words," he said slowly, "how is it there are words without
a tongue and throat? Where do they come from?"</p>

<p>Cookie held up a record. "They're on this, ye auld pagan."</p>

<p>"Who put them on ?"</p>

<p>"I dinna ken."</p>

<p>"But how did he put them?"</p>

<p>"Simple enough. There's a place where they're made, and if ye
talk on to the thing it talks back."</p>

<p>" Like a woman?"</p>

<p>"Aye, verra like a woman."</p>

<p>"Where is this place?"</p>

<p>Cookie indicated the eastern horizon. "Over yonder, where we
come from."</p>

<p>"Will it give back any kind of words, or is it they must be
those of a white man?"</p>

<p>"Any kind."</p>

<p>"Then this devil does not care what he says?"</p>

<p>"Not a hoot."</p>

<p>Kahdoosh pulled down his brews because the intensity of his
thoughts hurt him.</p>

<p>"Does the ship go to that place?"</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;or near it."</p>

<p>"Then I go with the ship. Let the devil now sleep a little."</p>

<p>Of the rest of that voyage it is written that, when he was not
flenching or rendering or Pulling stroke oar in the whaling-gig,
Kahdoosh spent his time with the devil, over whom he soon gained a
complete control. He made a picture when his big, strong hand
fitted a needle, and he learned to finger a record as Lightly as
one would a bubble. His wages loomed very large in his mind during
these days, and when he heard from Macgovan that he would have more
than enough to buy a large strong devil with many voices, his cup
was full. Now, too, he watched the white man more closely than ever
before, picking up more and more English till, at the end of an
extended voyage, when he set foot in Dundee and arrayed himself in
Scotch tweeds, he was a very different Husky from the one who sat
on a flat rock and tortured his soul with thoughts of Peegish and
Larpan. Larpan&mdash;the son of many fools! But he wanted Peegish
more than ever.</p>

<p>It fell on a day when the water was running down a thousand
streams of Greenland that Macgovan's whaler rounded a point on the
western coast and headed for an anchorage well known to her master.
In the bow stood Kahdoosh, garbed as no Husky had been garbed
before in that desolate region. His boots hurt a good deal, but the
vivid pattern of his tweeds made up for that. He stood motionless,
picking out the topeck of Hadjvick, which was pitched in the same
place, and marking diminutive figures that grew slowly larger.
No&mdash;it was nothing like Dundee or the other ports where he had
worked all winter. But it was home&mdash;-home with the rocks and
jar seals and mangy dogs and kayacks dancing on the water&mdash;and
Peegish. The seed of the North was too deep-rooted in his pagan
breast to be destroyed by anything he had seen or done. Thus does
the cold hand of the Arctic claim her own.</p>

<p>Peegish was there when he landed in the middle of an awed circle
with great good-humour and two large bundles. She had indeed been
fed by her father till the ice moved, but not without protest,
since her appetite was hearty. Now she stared at her lover with
uncontrollable excitement, and got just one look. That was enough.
Larpan, who had developed several new tricks that greatly enhanced
his reputation, was also there, a little contemptuous about the
Scotch tweeds, but vastly curious as to the bundles. More magic, no
doubt&mdash;but he felt safe enough. Hadjvick, congratulating
himself that his larder was now to be relieved of a strain,
reckoned that the trousers of Kahdoosh would make admirable
lamp-wick, and decided if the wanderer gained the day to put that
price on the hand of his daughter. Then there were the rest of
them, hunters, women and children, all talking at once, fingering
the fringe of the strange clothing, the men trying not to show how
jealous they were, the women prodigiously impressed, the children
staring with round black eyes. It was a great home-coming.</p>

<p>Followed a little silence, till Kahdoosh dropped into the Husky
tongue as smoothly as oil flows into a bottle. He looked at Larpan
out of the corner of his eye while he spoke.</p>

<p>"It is known to all that between me and Larpan there is a matter
to be settled. It is well that it be settled now, and for this
purpose I have come back. But to make that which I will make, it is
necessary that I be alone first. Who then will lend me his igloo
for the space of a short time?"</p>

<p>"I will," said Hadjvick promptly. His was the biggest of
all.</p>

<p>Kahdoosh nodded. "It is well."</p>

<p>He picked up his bundles, stalked to the home of Peegish, and
retired to solitude. The village waited expectant. Larpan felt a
little nervous, admitting that this was a good opening and
contributed the desirable touch of mystery. He did a few tricks in
the sight of everybody just to show that he didn't care, but they
were old and missed fire. What was Kahdoosh up to? That was the
question. Presently the latter appeared and waved a hand. The
village trooped in, silent, wondering. The topeck was exactly as
before. Nothing touched or altered. Peegish squatted in the front
row, with Larpan lounging this time against the back wall. The
semicircle formed&mdash;black brows&mdash;narrow, slanting
eyes&mdash;rows of copper-coloured faces&mdash;teeth that
glittered&mdash;oily hair that fell to the strong shoulders.
Kahdoosh took it all in and nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"It is now nearly a year since I went away," he began, "and many
strange things have I seen in the land where the whaling-ships rest
in winter. There are igloos like sand on the shore, built of stone
both red and white, and many devils are slaves of the people. Being
too impatient to walk, they journey in things like an oomiak which
has a roof and runs along the ground more quickly than a coast
caribou. There is fire for all, made of stones that come out of the
earth, and water runs where they will in long tubes like a bear's
entrails. Plenty of meat there is, also a white food made of a
certain powder, which is burned with fire and goes into the
stomachs of all. In the night-time they have light in small bottles
wherein are certain devils who shine very brightly when there is
need of them. But the greatest devil of all is one who runs like
lightning with a great roaring, following a certain path prepared
for him, and pulling behind him more people than there are in many
villages."</p>

<p>"Ey-yah," said Hadjvick," what wonders are these? Is Kahdoosh
then talking of what he dreamed?"</p>

<p>"No," smiled the traveller, "but only of that which I saw and
also touched. But of all these devils the most strange is the one
who takes to himself the voice of those dead or distant, and speaks
for them."</p>

<p>This was too much. Larpan began to laugh, while even the faith
of Peegish tottered. Kahdoosh did not change a muscle.</p>

<p>"It is truth that I tell, and furthermore it is the law that
this devil, being very wise, also speaks only the truth. That which
he says is believed of all men, and when his word goes forth there
is none that answers back. He has a tongue, but no ears; and having
no head yet remembers many things. That devil has come here with
me. Even now he is in this topeck."</p>

<p>A shiver ran through the audience. They glanced fearfully about.
Nothing visible here&mdash;no devil&mdash;only the utensils of
Hadjvick&mdash;a pile of greasy skins&mdash;two stone lamps and
some gear. Kahdoosh marked the shiver and lifted the door-flap.</p>

<p>"What remains to be said is outside. Sit you close there."</p>

<p>They filed out, squatting within a few feet of the opening. He
stepped back, and the flap closed. A little silence. Then came a
sort of throaty chant, the voice of Kahdoosh.</p>

<p>"I, the devil of all truth, tell of Larpan, who, being in no
manner a hunter, but desiring a certain woman, learned for himself
some tricks to make his name great in his village. This man,
filling his sleeves with walrus-teeth..."</p>

<p>Here the audience sat up very straight, for Kahdoosh still
telling his story came out, dropped the flap and sat in the midst
of them. But, wonder of wonders, the voice went on inside.</p>

<p>"...filling his sleeves with walrus-teeth, and burying the skull
of a jar seal in the ground, brought forth these things, pretending
that"&mdash;here Peegish screamed and Larpan's eyes
bulged&mdash;"that he was a magician. Fools there were in the
village that believed him, so he sat up with his fingers at night,
making them smooth for more tricks. But because his mind was empty
like a pool in which there are no fish, and his head soft like a
child's, and his arm weak like that of an old woman, it came that
the tribe grew weary of his foolishness, and the woman he desired
laughed in his face and married another."</p>

<p>With that the voice ceased, making a little noise like a dog
does when it scratches the ice.</p>

<p>"Ou-uh!" breathed the audience. "Ou-uh!" Here indeed was magic
surpassing the wildest dream. They looked at Larpan for his
answer.</p>

<p>He got up shakily, glared at Kahdoosh, seemed about to speak,
then marching stolidly to his own topeck went in and drew the flap
tight.</p>

<p>The village watched him without words, but the father of Peegish
wasted no thought on Larpan. He leaned over and spoke into the
hollow of his daughter's ear:</p>

<p>"If the trousers of your husband please you not, I am in great
need of lamp-wick."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>THE REWARD OF KWASIND</h2>

<p>Kwasind, whose name in English means the Strong Man, lived with
his daughter Suggemah, the Mosquito, in a conical teepee on the
iron-bound shores of Lac Seul, which lies roughly half-way between
Lake Superior and Hudson Bay. Should you desire to know more of Lac
Seul, it will suffice to say that the surrounding country is flat
and rocky, the timber small and straggling, the fishing good, the
fur better than good, the summers are hot and sweltering, the
winters bleak and smitten with biting winds.</p>

<p>This is one of the many regions of the North once administered
by the factors of the Company of Gentlemen Adventurers who became
in time lords of the territory they penetrated, and developed into
the undisputed rulers of the Land of Little Sticks, till later
their sway was challenged by others; but Kwasind, being a
conservative by nature, preferred to do business at the old shop.
Also there was the fact that Mactavish, the nearby factor, was a
man of few words, who had the habit of doing rather better than his
promise. And that helped trade a great deal. It fell, during a
winter when the winds were unusually bitter, that there passed
through the Lac Seul country the story that white men were looking
through spy-glasses that stood on three legs to ascertain if there
could be found a good trail for the thing that vomited fire, and
ran on wheels, and carried many, many men in its entrails. Kwasind,
like other Ojibways in the district, heard this story, and hoped
greatly that there was nothing in it. For one thing, there were
enough white men as matters stood. For another, any such
arrangement would certainly affect the hunting and trapping. He
understood a little English, but had small respect for the men he
learned it from, excepting always Mactavish. And, after all, it was
his country, and not theirs.</p>

<p>He was thinking about this one day while going the round of his
traps, which meant a circuit of about a hundred and thirty miles,
and took about a week, when he noticed that a recent snowshoe-trail
cut across his old one, a trail that had certainly been made within
the last few hours. Also he saw In a moment that it was a white
man's trail, that the man was tired or sick, about six feet tall,
limped a trifle on his left leg, was not sure where he was going,
and carried a pack that was but loosely strapped to his
shoulders.</p>

<p>There were a good many other points about the trail that one
could not mistake&mdash;for instance, that the shoes had been made
by old Keego, on Manitou Lake, that the man had one very sore heel,
and some of the fingers of his left hand were frozen. These were of
minor interest. The one that stood out was that the stranger needed
help, and needed it badly.</p>

<p>He found the man in less than half a mile, found him in a
tumbled heap, with his eyes shut, and grey patches on his cheeks;
wnereupon Kwasind got very busy, and in six minutes was holding a
cup of steaming tea to the stiff lips. In sixteen minutes he was
smashing down the trail to his nearest hunting-shack, grunting
words of encouragement over his doubly-burdened shoulder to the
figure that staggered behind him. Twenty-four hours later he lifted
the flap of the teepee on Lac Seul and motioned the stranger in.
The latter obeyed, swayed weakly for an instant, then pitched
forward on his face.</p>

<p>Now, it is written&mdash;-though few there be that are wise
enough to read before the punishment comes for
disobedience&mdash;-that the wilderness has rules of her own. To
follow these without question is to be safe. To violate them is to
invite the inevitable. Young Murchison, who in nature and mind
could not be called a thoroughbred, and was late from the office of
an engineering firm that did their business in the sober purlieus
of Victoria Street, S.W., had not read the rules, and thereby
committed certain grievous errors. He left camp not very sure of
where he was going, he started out tired and with a sore heel, in
the first half-hour he lost the mitt from his left hand, and,
lastly, did not trouble to watch the sun, of which there may be but
little in such regions in winter, nor did he bother to adjust his
pack, which, swinging loosely, added to his fatigue without his
knowing it. Also a bit of shrapnel near his left knee had begun to
burn like fire. So, taking one thing with another, the conclusions
of Kwasind might be considered fairly accurate.</p>

<p>Twelve hours later the white man stretched his six-foot length
of weary body&mdash;Kwasind had estimated his height by the length
of his stride&mdash;and opened his eyes. His feet were swollen, and
the patches on his cheeks very tender. He was lying beside a
smokeless fire of dry wood, from which vagrant sparks danced upward
to an opening where the teepee poles met and crossed. The camp was
floored with balsam-boughs, over which lay caribou robes and
rabbit-skin blankets, the latter made of long one-inch-wide strips
woven into a sort of loose fabric. On the other side of the fire
sat Suggemah, her black hair in two long thick braids that trailed
over her supple shoulders. She was very busy with something, and
presently Murchison made out that she was mending a pair of
moccasins. They looked like his own. He studied the smooth,
impassive face, the high cheek-bones, the squareness of her small,
strong wrists, the quick certainty of the slim, brown hands. Then
he met a glance from her black eyes. It was queer, he thought, to
be alone with a heathen girl like this. And where was the man?</p>

<p>"Hungry?" asked Suggemah. She had been practising her English
for hours past, repeating it over in whispers to herself, and
greatly intrigued with the whole situation.</p>

<p>"Very hungry," he replied, feeling that he could have gnawed
contentedly at the blanket that covered him.</p>

<p>She made a soft little noise in her throat, and lifted the lid
from a pot by the fire. Instantly the teepee was filled with the
most seductive odours. There was a partridge in that pot, and a bit
of bacon&mdash;which on Lac Seul, was worth a dollar and a half
that winter, or, say, the price of a fairly prime
mink-skin&mdash;and a lump of caribou meat, half a whitefish that
Kwasind had lifted from the ice a few hours previously, and some
balls of flour, known in the North as doughboys, which provide what
may be called the cementing agent to every really solid meal. All
these had been simmering in a slow, deliberate fashion that
permitted none of their virtues to escape, and now sent out an
invitation that made Murchison lick his swollen lips and stretch an
eager hand.</p>

<p>"Not much first time," said Suggemah, smiling gravely. "Eat more
by and by. White man make much sick eat too much."</p>

<p>He ate slowly, which was an effort, watching her out of the
corner of his eye. There was a good deal of the aristocrat about
her. She didn't stare at him, or giggle, or do any of the things
that some girls he knew would have done in the circumstances, nor
was she in any way self-conscious. The teepee was clean and tidy,
her clothes&mdash;which she had evidently made herself&mdash;were
neat and well finished, and there was that in her face and manner
which said very plainly that she expected to be treated by this
stranger with exactly the consideration she had for him. This was
her party, and in her father's house.</p>

<p>Presently he put down an empty dish with an eloquent sigh. "That
was very, very good. No more now?"</p>

<p>"Smoke!" said Suggemah, and handed him his own pipe. "My father
come back soon. Me make your feet better now."</p>

<p>She rubbed him with an ointment of herbs and bear's grease that
soothed the fire in his flesh, and there seemed to be healing in
her very touch. He was smoking thoughtfully, wondering how to thank
her, when from close by in the bush came a sudden squealing cry
that sounded strangling and almost human. He looked at her,
startled.</p>

<p>"Me snare wahboose-rabbit. Plenty wahboose this winter. Last
winter not many. Every seven years great sickness kill them."</p>

<p>"Where is your father?"</p>

<p>"He go see traps. You go sleep now. He here when you wake
up."</p>

<p>Murchison did as he was bid, it being very easy to obey. He
dreamed as he slept, with visions of other Samaritans of whom he
had read, especially of One, grave and tender, while into his
dreams drifted the dull reports from the bleak expanse of Lac Seul
where the ice expanded and heaved in the intense frost, and a lone
timber wolf howled hungrily from the slope of a distant ridge. And
all the time, hour after hour, Suggemah tended the fire, lest the
stranger be cold, replenishing its blaze from the pile of wood at
the teepee door.</p>

<p>There were many questions she wanted to ask when he woke, but
her English could not go that far. What did girls of her own age do
and look like in the land he came from? Was the trapping good, and
were there plenty of rabbits? What did one pay for a red flannel
skirt at the trading-posts? Was the snow deep in winter, and the
birch-bark good for canoe-making? And when a girl married, did she
have to work very hard, and chop wood, and feed the dogs, and pull
the nets from under the ice? That was the job Suggemah liked least,
though she had never dreamed of saying so.</p>

<p>All these things would fall to her lot, and because she rather
dreaded them she was staying with her grave, kindly father as long
as she possibly could. But there was no escape from Fate.</p>

<p>Late that night Murchison heard the yelp of dogs a mile away,
and presently the creak of shoes outside the teepee, then the stamp
of feet, and Kwasind came in, a tall, white pillar of a man with
frost rime sparkling on his upper lip. He glanced at his guest,
nodded to Suggemah, and said not a word till he had eaten.</p>

<p>"Me go your camp tell everybody you all right come back
to-morrow," he remarked presently. "Everybody think you big fool
get lost and die."</p>

<p>Murchison thought that this bordered on the personal, But He
probably had been a fool of some description. So he merely tried to
explain that he knew nothing of the North, which was quite
unnecessary, and that he was one of a survey party exploring for a
new railway.</p>

<p>Kwasind nodded. "Why you make railway here?"</p>

<p>"To open up the country and bring lots of people." The young man
said this with a touch of pride, and saw himself waving the banner
of progress.</p>

<p>The Indian made a deliberate gesture, fingers out, palm
down.</p>

<p>"Plenty people here now. Me no want your fire-wagon. This my
country. You keep fire-wagon at home your country. Great Spirit
tell me last night fire-wagon no good for Land of Little Sticks.
Frighten mink and otter and caribou. Big noise and much stink."</p>

<p>Murchison felt amused and rather patronising. Without doubt he
was dealing with a very limited intelligence, and Kwasind did not
mean to be rude, nor did he realise that he would make money more
easily after the railway was built, and would benefit in many ways
at present past the comprehension of a benighted heathen.</p>

<p>"That's all right," he said carelessly, "and you'll soon get
used to it."</p>

<p>It was a social and tactical error. What Murchison had failed to
perceive was that for the time being he was the guest of a member
of one of the oldest aristocracies in the world, a man who was
proud to a degree that only a very few understand, a man who had
been weighing him with remarkable care. Kwasind was very wise in
some ways, and very ignorant in others, but he knew much, and was
therefore very far from being a fool. He understood the instincts
of animals, and the ways of fur and feather, and could read the
skies like an open book, and was brave and simple and honest, and
could and did live well where a white man would starve. As to white
men in general, his experience told him that his people were
usually better off without them, excepting always the Hudson Bay
factors, who often married Indians, that union producing the best
all-round specimen to be found in the woods&mdash;the Scotch
half-breed.</p>

<p>And Kwasind did want the country for his tribe and himself. It
wasn't much to ask, and the fur not as good as it used to be, and
what he could not understand was why men should leave their own
territory to invade his. As for a railway, he had the feeling that
it would he the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>"Suppose me make fire-wagon pass close by your teepee, you no
like him, eh?" he said after a long pause.</p>

<p>"I'd rather like it," chuckled Murchison, "and if I didn't I'd
move the teepee. That's what you'll have to do, old man."</p>

<p>Kwasind said nothing, having made up his mind to that long ago,
and presently his guest noted the beauty of the soapstone pipe
around which the strong brown fingers curved so contentedly.</p>

<p>"I say, what will you take for that pipe?"</p>

<p>Kwasind regarded him calmly. That pipe had been smoked by his
great-grandfather all the way from Lake Superior to the Coppermine
River. It was saturated with tradition and history, a thing beyond
purchase, consecrated by the vanished lips that once closed over
its stem, the companion of lonely hours when the winds were bitter,
the solace for punishing days when one tightened the leather thong
round one's empty stomach. Such things were not sold.</p>

<p>But the longer Murchison stared, the more he coveted. It was
utterly unlike any pipe he had ever seen, with the wing-bone of a
crane for a stem, and he ached to take it back to London, show it
to admiring friends, and tell them of his adventure on Lac Seul
while he filled it with British tobacco, not the filthy stuff that
the present owner seemed to fancy.</p>

<p>"I'll give you five dollars."</p>

<p>Kwasind shook his head.</p>

<p>"Ten!"</p>

<p>Ten dollars was the price of seven prime mink-skins on Lac Seul
that winter, and a deal of money, but Kwasind did not give a
sign.</p>

<p>"Fifteen!" said Murchison. "Better let me have it. You can make
another any day."</p>

<p>Kwasind took the pipe from his mouth, looked at it fixedly, and
held it out. There was an expression in his eyes that his guest
only understood later on.</p>

<p>"Take it!"</p>

<p>Murchison's hand was in his pocket, when Kwasind added with a
curious inflexion: "Keep it. I do not sell, but give."</p>

<p>It was very silent in the teepee that night, with not even a
whine from the dogs half-buried in the snow outside, and the white
man, in a rabbit-skin sleeping-bag, lay on his back and thought for
a long time. He rather felt he had put his foot in it. Kwasind had
not said another word, nor had Suggemah, on the subject of the
pipe, so the only thing to do was to settle up next morning in so
liberal a fashion as to wipe out any sense of loss the gift might
have occasioned. If he gave the old fellow twenty-five dollars for
saving his life, that ought to put everything straight. And
Suggemah could get no end of an outfit with twenty-five
dollars.</p>

<p>At noon on the following day he stood on the summit of a ridge,
and Kwasind pointed to a pencil of grey smoke that rose from a
clump of dark-green spruce far below, They had come to it as a bird
flies across country, and on the way Kwasind indicated the run of
the water, the slope of the hills, the boundaries of lakes, and
numberless other things of infinite value to an engineer. It gave
him no pleasure to do this, but it was his duty as a host, even
though it made the advent of the fire-wagon all the more certain.
Then, with the stranger's camp in sight, and the stranger himself
safe and restored, he said a grave good-bye.</p>

<p>Murchison put out his hand. "Here's twenty-five dollars, and
thank you."</p>

<p>Kwasind drew himself up to his full height and waved aside the
money. His dark, smooth face was stern, and he gave a smile that
the young man thought was almost contemptuous.</p>

<p>"No take money for help sick man, Some day, perhaps, you do same
for me."</p>

<p>In the next moment Murchison was alone. His host had vanished
like a spirit over the crown of the ridge, and there was left only
his fresh trail, with the snow crumbling in over the edges, and the
dull sound of an axe, softened as it rose from the adjoining
valley.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some two Years later there stood on the stage of a London hall a
group of Indians with painted faces and variegated garments of
gaudy colours. Their narrow, black, unwinking eyes took in the
serried rows of the audience, the staring lights, and the great
dome of the building that housed them. To their ears came the
murmur of a multitude, and they caught a strange odour that rose
from packed humanity. They did not know what to think, for this,
and all that had preceded it, was too far removed from anything
they had known before. But they were aware that they were there to
be stared at. At home they did not paint their faces, nor attire
themselves in scarlet and yellow and emerald green. That was left
for the young squaws, who, naturally, were fools. But the
interpreter had explained that the white people expected it, and it
was all covered in the contract which the Indian agent had read
over very carefully before he allowed Kwasind to make his cross at
the bottom. The money had been paid in advance, and waited his
return to Lac Seul with Suggemah.</p>

<p>All this was arranged after a white man had made in the North
the picture which had been shown them the day they reached London.
It was very great magic. Kwasind was in it, and Suggemah, and even
old Keego, for whom a messenger had been sent to Manitou Lake,
because he had a face like an owl with its beak chopped off. They
had all fished and hunted, and done the things they did, anyway,
while the white man said strange words through the interpreter, and
twisted at a thing on three legs that had a large glass eye and
made a noise like a woodpecker against a hollow log. They had
journeyed in the entrails of the fire-wagon, in fire-canoes that
had many bowels, one on top of the other; they had crossed a great
lake of bitter water, where all the islands had been washed away,
and an evil spirit turned their stomachs upside down within them,
and the chief of the fire-canoes worshipped the sun every day at
noon, raising his arms to heaven in the middle of his prayer. And
now, at the end of it all, there were white people like the leaves
in summer, and a great noise and many strange smells.</p>

<p>Kwasind and Suggemah were sick of the whole thing. They didn't
mind being stared at, but they hated to sleep in small rooms in a
large place where there was no air. One could not trap or hunt
here, and when one night Kwasind stole out by himself and snared a
rabbit in a little clearing where there were trees, and many people
rowed themselves in boats in the daytime, there was much trouble,
and many words by men who wore blue clothes. He had snared a duck,
too, while it slept, and had it under his clothes all the time, but
felt it was wiser to say nothing about it. As to Suggemah, she was
tired, and bewildered at things she did not understand, and a
little jealous because she could never look like the women she saw.
So between the two there was a deep longing for the expanse of La
Seul, and to meet someone who knew their own country, and would
talk to them, even if not in their own tongue, about the simple
things they knew and missed and loved so greatly.</p>

<p>One night, when this hunger lay heavy on the heart of Kwasind,
and be was more than usually sick of his green blanket and the
paint on his cheeks, be happened to pick out amongst the blur of
the audience one face that he actually knew. It was that of the man
whose life he had saved. He wondered for a while if he would see
Murchison, but that possibility was put aside. Now the
extraordinary thing had actually happened. He whispered it to
Suggemah, and she too stared hard. Then she nodded.</p>

<p>"It is the same man," she said under her breath.</p>

<p>"There is much that I would say to him," murmured her father,
"and he has a debt to pay. No doubt he will take me for a while out
of this place to where there is wood and water, and the wind blows,
and I can snare something. I would speak to him now in the sign
language, but he would not understand. What shall I do?" He paused,
feeling very helpless. "There is not any trouble in finding a man
in the woods, but here is one that I see, yet cannot reach."</p>

<p>Suggemah thought quickly. "Without doubt he will go away by the
big door wherein he came, so if we were there first it would be
easy. When the magic has nearly moved across the wall, tell the
interpreter that your stomach is sick within you, and go to the big
door and wait, When he comes out, tell the young man what is in
your heart, and without doubt he will be very glad."</p>

<p>Kwasind nodded, and did as was arranged. So it happened that for
a quarter-hour he stood like a graven image at the big door, with
the flaring lights of a London street full on his painted face. His
arms were folded, and not a muscle of him stirred. His dark eyes,
lustrous and steady, betrayed nothing, but his heart was full of a
great hunger. In all these millions there was not one he knew
amongst the white men, saving only the man he waited for. He saw
again the half-frozen figure beside the unsteady trail, remembered
Murchison's gratitude when he said good-bye, felt again the smooth
surface of the soapstone pipe he had prized so greatly and given so
quietly, and reckoned that now, at any rate, the white man would
find some suitable way of saying "Thank you!" in his own fashion.
Moments passed. People glanced at him, remarked smilingly that it
was good advertising, and passed on. Then came the sound of many
feet.</p>

<p>Kwasind's eye flashed and his body stiffened. The avalanche
surged by, growing in volume, and he surveyed it with a gaze keener
by far than any he met. Girls stared at him, nudged each other, and
giggled. Men regarded him, closer now than before, and nodded
understandingly. He saw all of them&mdash;and none. Suddenly he
stepped forward, put out an arm like an iron bar, and touched
someone on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Boozhoo!" he said huskily. "Boozhoo! You remember Lac
Seul?"</p>

<p>Murchison pulled up, peered hard into the strong face, noble in
spite of its fantastic colouring, and gave a quick laugh of
delighted recognition.</p>

<p>"By all the Powers! Were you on that platform?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kwasind. "Me there, and see you."</p>

<p>Murchison blinked, shouldered his way to the edge of the crowd,
and looked at this friend who had suddenly appeared, an older and
wiser Murchison, with a good many of his corners knocked off by
work and experience. In the past two years he had thought a good
deal about Lac Seul, and now saw himself in a not very favourable
light so far as that incident was concerned. But one couldn't undo
it. Queer how at this moment the sight of Kwasind should revive the
chill of frost in his body, and make him feel again the numbing
approach of that stupor from which no man awakes in the North. He
was aware of this, and a good deal more.</p>

<p>"Suggemah," he asked, "is she here, too?"</p>

<p>The father of Suggemah nodded.</p>

<p>"Good! Where do you live?"</p>

<p>Kwasind made a gesture that embraced North London.</p>

<p>"Will you and Suggemah come and see me now? I want to talk about
Lac Seul."</p>

<p>Kwasind's heart leapt, but not a muscle of his face moved.</p>

<p>"You wait. Me get her."</p>

<p>What happened in the next hour always remained in the mind of
the hunter as the sort of thing one liked to remember. He and
Suggemah embarked in one of the smaller stink devil-wagons that ran
about the streets, and came to a. big teepee in a row of teepees
all made of stone. There the white man brought them to a room
wherein sat an old woman of his own tribe, and told her that these
were the friends from Lac Seul of whom he had often spoken.
Thereupon the woman kissed Suggemah on both cheeks, and held
Kwasind's hands for some time, making a queer noise like a laugh,
but with tears on her cheeks&mdash;which surely was a strange
thing. After that was much feasting on many kinds of food brought
by another white woman, who screamed as though in fear the first
time she entered the room. Then talk of Lac Seul, and much smoke.
In the middle of the smoke the young man slapped his leg as though
bitten by many mosquitoes at once, and, going away, came back,
smiling, with the soapstone puagun, or pipe, at the sight of which,
as Kwasind put it, his stomach rolled over and he desired it
greatly. Five-ten-fifteen-twenty-five dollars&mdash;he was a man of
substance and could afford to buy it now. The longer he looked, the
greater became his desire. But it had been his gift, so he said not
a word.</p>

<p>For a moment Murchison did not say anything either, but stood
with the ancient thing in his fingers, glancing oddly from the
hunter to his mother. Very deliberately he filled it and struck a
match. Kwasind quivered ever so slightly, his beady eyes fixed on
the treasure of his tribe.</p>

<p>"Was this a peace pipe?" asked Murchison.</p>

<p>"Sometimes a peace pipe. It has seen both peace and war."</p>

<p>"But it was never a pipe of reproach?"</p>

<p>Kwasind's dark brows wrinkled a little.</p>

<p>"I do not know that word."</p>

<p>Murchison reddened, glanced at his mother, then took one puff,
and held out the puagun to its rightful owner.</p>

<p>"I believe that," he said, "but I do. Here you are, old
chap!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>THE LOYALTY OF PEEGUK</h2>

<p>Peeguk, the Flat-footed One, lived, when he was at home, not a
thousand miles from Fort Herschell, and, for the Arctic, this is a
fairly close address, from which he would be easily found by one
who knew the country. Fort Herschell is, as all the world knows, a
mass of rock as big as two or three English counties, and situated
not a great way from the mouth of the Coppermine River. It is
wind-whipped, storm-smitten and ice-blistered, and, in the
short-lived summer, occasionally quite warm. The fort&mdash;though
there is no fort&mdash;is the farthest north spot where abide the
representatives of law and order.</p>

<p>Peeguk's very mobile headquarters were on the mainland.
Sometimes he found it rather lonely, and this in spite of the fact
that his joys and sorrows were shared by Oomgah, the Moon-faced
One. There was never any shortage of food. White whales, for
instance, came ashore every now and then in summer, and as soon as
Peeguk saw that they were firmly wedged among the rocks he would
move his topeck&mdash;or, rather, Oomgah moved it&mdash;to the
nearest point, and the whale furnished a free lunch counter from
which, perhaps for weeks, they carved lean and fat as their
leisurely fancy desired. By night the white bears slouched up to
help themselves, and after them the lesser fry of the
curved-clawed, short-furred, sharp-toothed family; so under this
combined assault the whale, which only weighed from twelve to
fifteen tons, did not last very long. But it was all quite
amicable, with the rules of precedence mutually remembered and
recognised. It happened on a day that some coast Huskies came along
in the fine weather, floating like gulls on the placid sea, and
camped at the mouth of Wind River, not far from the summer
residence of Peeguk. Amongst them was a certain Atokwok, the
Far-sighted One, known to many of the small brown tribes as being
wise and of great experience. Especially was he learned when it was
a matter of the doings and habits of white men. And it occurred
when Peeguk and he were sharing a still living salmon that the
latter had just jerked up through six fathom of cold green water,
that Peeguk, whose throat was full of fish, asked if there was
anything new in that particular part of the world.</p>

<p>Atokwok picked a salmon-bone out of his gums and waved a greasy
hand.</p>

<p>"I have come from the island on a whaler to the mouth of the
Mother of Rivers" (he meant the Copper-mine) "and thence here. But
on the island I saw those who had arrived from the far south,
bringing with them a strange new devil. Never before have I beheld
such a devil."</p>

<p>"Does it live in a box, and speak without a tongue, and make a
noise like a dog scratching the ice when its speech is
finished?"</p>

<p>Atokwok shook his head. "No&mdash;not that one&mdash;but
nevertheless kindred to it, for, of a truth, this I saw is born in
a box. But it will not stay there, and leaps out of it across a
place as big as many topecks, whereupon it sticks to the wall."</p>

<p>Peeguk blinked at him. "Then you can catch it, or scrape it
off?"</p>

<p>"Not so: for when I tried to do this there was much laughter,
and my hand went through the devil and felt only the wall."</p>

<p>"Then it escaped&mdash;for there cannot be a devil made out of
nothing."</p>

<p>"Yet there is, and I who speak to you have seen it. It is the
spirit of a very powerful and active one, and lives in the
dark."</p>

<p>"Since when has my brother seen in the dark?" asked Peeguk
satirically.</p>

<p>Atokwok, undisturbed, and looking very superior, helped himself
to the tail of the salmon.</p>

<p>"Verily this thing crossed the dark on a bridge of light, as the
ice makes a bridge over a narrow lane of deep water in a season of
the year. Thus it came to the wall of which I spoke, and there it
stuck."</p>

<p>Peeguk surveyed his visitor gravely. Men did not lie to each
other when they sat on a flat rock, side by side, and ate fish on
the shore of the sea. At least Eskimo men did not. But all this was
a deal harder to swallow than the salmon. A devil that stuck to a
wall, and could not be scraped off! Then he had an idea.</p>

<p>"Had it a voice?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nor was there any sound save a small rattling noise in
the box from which it jumped. But no voice."</p>

<p>"And your hand went through it, touching the wall?"</p>

<p>"As I have told you. The part I touched was water, with many
strange boats on it, boats that moved with men in them, speaking,
it seemed, together; and though I dipped my hand in this water I
felt no cold nor was my hand even wet. Have you no more
salmon?"</p>

<p>Peeguk did not answer at once, being too occupied with many
reflections, novel and stirring. He knew enough to realise that the
white man was all-powerful. It was always a surprise to him to hear
that a white man had died, and attributed it to the fact that one
of the numerous devils in their service had for a moment got the
better of his master&mdash;which was not infrequently correct. In a
way it made one feel more contented with one's own lot. This last
revelation, however, surpassed anything he had ever heard.</p>

<p>"No," he said slowly, "but in the next bay is what is left of a
young whale whose meat is rotten and therefore very tender. What
size is this devil of which you speak?"</p>

<p>Atokwok heaved himself up. "How far away is that whale?"</p>

<p>"As far as a tired man can walk in one hour." He put it this way
because all men who are tired cover about the same distance in a
given time.</p>

<p>"Again I ask how large is this devil?"</p>

<p>"Twice as long as my arms can reach, and twice as high; and,"
added Atokwok impressively, "it all came out of a hole in the box
of a bigness that could be filled by the nose of a jar seal."</p>

<p>He waddled off, his own nose questingly in the air, for thereby
he would inevitably find what he sought, and Peeguk sat quite
motionless. He gave up trying to understand, but at that moment
there was born in him the determination to see this thing for
himself. If Atokwok was a liar&mdash;well, the word would go forth
to that effect; and if he was not&mdash;well, the heart of the
hunter swelled at the very thought. So because he wanted to work
the thing out carefully in his own mind, he asked no more
questions, and when Atokwok and his friends moved off eastward next
morning into the empty wastes of the Beaufort Sea, Peeguk merely
waved a hand and said nothing. But the kayacks of the voyagers had
hardly vanished round the nearest point when he turned to Oomgah
with an odd look in his oily black eyes.</p>

<p>"I go to see something of which Atokwok has told me, and in two
months I shall be at the mouth of the Mother of Rivers. Meet me
there with the dogs."</p>

<p>That was all he said, this being a matter he had decided to
handle himself, and he went off with the quiet assurance of those
who can live without fire or water, and whose larder is the deep
green sea from which they take what they need when they need it. He
did not worry about Oomgah, she being well able to take care of
herself in this fat season of the year, when the salmon lay like
silver slabs in the shallow waters, and the runways beside the
small inland lakes were crowded with plump, pink-fleshed,
half-feathered geese and swans that waddled coastwards while their
plumage grew. Nor did storms delay Peeguk, and day after day his
kayack, tight as a drum and unsinkable as a soda-water bottle,
nosed along the naked shores of the Arctic, its slim prow set
steadfastly toward Herschell Island. Then, for the last leg of the
trip, an obliging Alaskan whaler gave him a lift over from the
mainland, during which he worked his passage with rising excitement
in his barrel-like breast.</p>

<p>He approached the fort: with strange misgivings that intensified
when he learned from a Coppermine Husky of the notable things which
were being done there almost every night. It was certainly great
magic. The man who told him this said, his eyes rolling, that once
he had crept up to a window of the fort, and, looking in, beheld
two white men fighting with guns against the wall, that one of them
was killed&mdash;for he fell down and did not move, and there was
no noise at all of fighting or firearms.</p>

<p>"This thing I saw," he repeated earnestly, "so, being much
afraid, I ran away, and for two days watched the fort from a little
distance. But there was no white man's body carried out to be put
with those who died of the great sickness, nor was there any
sadness or mourning. Without doubt it is a place of devils, many
and strong, and there lies much danger in this matter."</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Peeguk, setting his teeth.</p>

<p>"It is in my mind that when a man is thus killed, he is
forthwith eaten. Otherwise where is his body?"</p>

<p>Peeguk took a long, long breath. In the year of the great hunger
men had been eaten on the shore of the Beaufort Sea, and he knew
it. But they were mostly old men&mdash;who could be spared, and an
old woman or two&mdash;not of much value. This, however, was spoken
of only in whispers. because evil things had befallen many of those
who thus saved themselves. Pituluk, for instance, who ate some of
his grandfather, was killed by a bear within two months; and
Sinuluk, the Large-eared One, whose wife's mother was at the very
end of her life the mainstay of the family, came to grief over a
difference with a bull walrus the very next spring. So, for every
reason, the subject as well as the practice was wisely avoided. But
he felt that a large, hearty devil might well lick his lips over
such fare.</p>

<p>"Atokwok told me that he had put his hand through this thing."
Peeguk's voice was stubborn, but his bowels felt as though they
were turned to water.</p>

<p>"I do not know or care what Atokwok said, but it is true that
he, being admitted to that place for a short time, came out very
quickly with his face the colour of sand when it is mixed with mud
where the white foxes play at the edge of the water. Also he did
not ask to go back, though the chief of the fort was willing, but
took his kayack and started for the anchorage of the whaler that
brought him."</p>

<p>Peeguk glanced apprehensively at the ship from which he had just
disembarked, then his jaw stiffened. Had he not come a matter of
twenty days' journey to see this thing? He felt in the leg of his
long walrus-hide boot, and brought out a sheathed skinning-knife
with a bone handle, a twelve-inch blade and an edge like a razor.
Testing this reflectively with a leathery thumb, he gave a little
grunt.</p>

<p>"I go to seek this devil," he said curtly, and, turning uphill,
strode toward the fort.</p>

<p>To the man behind the counter&mdash;there was much profitable
trading done here&mdash;the request was made known, the brown face
a mask for feelings many and mingled. It then appeared from what he
was told that the thing had been brought by a medicine man six
moons ago as a present for the chief of the fort, that no such
devil had ever been seen in the North before, that it came out only
in the dark, and that though it was a white man's devil an
exception could be made for himself since he had come so far.</p>

<p>"Then it cannot get loose?"</p>

<p>"Only when the light shines in the dark, and then when it is
permitted."</p>

<p>"Atokwok told me it went across to the wall on a bridge of
light."</p>

<p>"That is what happens."</p>

<p>"And otherwise it lives in a box?"</p>

<p>The trader nodded. A patient man, used to dealing gravely with
those who were only aware of first principles, he could enter into
the mind of this hunter with the quick, black, questioning eyes and
the soul of a child. The seal of the North was over them both.
There were also mysteries on Peeguk's side, strange stories handed
down from father to son of a Thing that walked by night, and,
passing near an igloo, was shortly and inevitably followed by
another visitor, even more grim and relentless. It had been heard
and seen, but the full story was locked in pagan breasts where it
would lie concealed. And there were other cardinal and more earthly
mysteries pertaining to birds, animals and fishes that the short,
brown people read at sight but no white man could ever decipher.
Besides all this there was that which one feels for another if that
other comes of a breed that will walk up to the hungry she-bear
when she issues gaunt and ravening from her winter fast with her
cub lurching beside her, and, taunting the great brute in his
queer, clicking tongue, will drive his spear into her vast furry
body. So, take it all in all, the trader found nothing to laugh at
when he looked at Peeguk.</p>

<p>"There is much that is hard to put into words concerning this
matter, but come you here after I have eaten, and you shall see for
yourself."</p>

<p>Peeguk went out, and for the next three hours sat on a rock not
five yards from the door. His stomach was empty but he craved no
food. At times he took out the knife, tested the edge of it with
his tongue, and put it thoughtfully back. The feel of it was good
against his leg. At nine o'clock, when it was as dark as it would
be for the next three months, the door opened.</p>

<p>"Come, and fear nothing. While this thing is on the wall it is
not permitted to any man to speak. You may laugh or cry, but no
words."</p>

<p>Peeguk took a look round before he went in. The grey of the
Arctic sea tilting flatly up to the horizon&mdash;rock ledges, worn
smooth by glaciers in the distant past&mdash;the low island
buildings, hugging the solid earth as though they feared being
uprooted by winter blasts&mdash;a cluster of topecks just above
tide level&mdash;a few hungry, mangy dogs&mdash;the miniature
whaler, riding, slack-chained, in the bay&mdash;and, over it all,
the suggestion of illimitable space and emptiness. This was very
familiar. Now it was in his mind that he might never see it again,
for all that the trader said, because the trader did not know what
he proposed to do. But he only made a soft little noise in his
throat, and followed. And this, perhaps, was the bravest thing he
ever did in his life.</p>

<p>The room, the biggest in Fort Herschell, was used
indiscriminately as a church when a missionary came that way; or a
court, as it had been when a magistrate journeyed five thousand
miles to try Tetamagama and Alikomiak concerning the murders for
which they were subsequently hanged; or for trading when the rush.
was on in the springtime. Some of the whaler's crew sat on benches
at one end, with a few other whites. Behind them was a small wooden
house with a hole in one side. Peeguk noted that this hole was of
the size of the nose of a jar seal.</p>

<p>"It is the devil-house!" he whispered to himself, and took the
seat nearest the door.</p>

<p>Someone turned out the lamp, and a moment later light was
visible inside this house. A voice spoke, saying that all was
ready. Peeguk did not stir a muscle, but the hair crawled up the
back of his neck.</p>

<p>Then out of the hole in the devil-house leaped a great light
that hit the opposite wall so that there came a space like a very
white cloud and very round. At the same time was heard a sound like
small gravel running down the bank of a stream, or many, many
rifles being cocked quickly one after the other. In the white cloud
appeared something Peeguk did not understand, but knew to be the
writing of white men; then a face, very large, the face of a woman
who opened her mouth showing many teeth, and smiled at
him&mdash;Peeguk, the husband of Oomgah. At this his soul quivered
within him, and he was glad Oomgah had not come. After that another
white woman, also beautiful, and with as many strong teeth, but not
fat enough for a good wife. Then two men, evidently not hunters,
because their necks were thin and their shoulders narrow. They also
looked at him and went away, and behold, the white cloud remained
without a mark. Of a truth this was great magic!</p>

<p>His brain began to reel, while, mutely, he searched his past
life for something by which he could judge this matter. There was
not anything. He desired greatly to get clear of this, but was
mysteriously anchored to his seat, not frightened as much as he
expected, but reduced to helplessness because there was so much
beyond his understanding. When one has travelled four hundred
miles, one wants to understand. It would be no use trying to
describe this thing to Oomgah. It would pester him for the rest of
his days.</p>

<p>He became aware that these spirits, for they could be nothing
else, had something to do with each other. One man and woman rubbed
noses. He understood that. The other man saw it, and was angered.
This also was comprehensible. There were many devil things they got
into and out of, black like porpoises, things that ran about over
the ground and carried people in their entrails. Peeguk did not
worry about this end of it, because he expected that the males were
going to fight about the woman. He had seen several fights about
women in the last few years. So now he tried to soothe his
palpitating heart, and waited. Also he loosened the knife that lay
against his right calf.</p>

<p>It came before he was ready for it. One man&mdash;or
devil&mdash;sat smoking, the woman having melted away from him,
when the other came up very quickly from behind and stabbed him
between the shoulders. Peeguk did not think much of the stabbing,
because he who did it evidently knew little about the proper use of
a knife, also when a man was stabbed he generally twisted about on
the ground for a while before he died, whereas this one died at
once. But great anger stirred in the pagan breast when, a little
later, the murderer came upon the woman and, taking her in his
arms, rubbed noses very hard indeed. She did not like it, and
fought with him.</p>

<p>Peeguk writhed on his seat, hot fury mounting in him. He had
seen much the same thing before when Ugnuk carried off Pilyuka, the
Cross-eyed One, and wife of Tolpan. Tolpan had stabbed very
efficiently when he caught them. But here was a woman who had none
to help her. She went on fighting, her hair flying loose like much
dry seaweed. Then, just as she became all soft, and bent like a
fish in the arms of the murderer, Peeguk, who had suffered all he
could, saw red. Whipping out the skinning-knife, he rushed across
and drove it deep into the man's heart,</p>

<p>In that instant several things happened. There was a great shout
that filled the room as with laughter; the murderer faded away as a
salmon swims under the ice; the gravel-like noise ceased
altogether&mdash;and there was the knife sticking into the breast
of the woman! At that the stomach of Peeguk stood upside-down
within him. He gave one loud cry and fled for the open air.</p>

<p>Oomgah, the Moon-faced One, had come at her leisure to the mouth
of the Mother of Rivers, paddling close to the shore while the dogs
yelped and scrambled westward over the barren land. The journey was
nothing to her. She fished, trapped, slept as much as she liked,
and in a general way enjoyed a sort of rest cure. As to Peeguk she
had no anxiety. He might come at the end of two moons, but if it
were three, what matter? She rather expected him to do some
visiting first.</p>

<p>She was therefore surprised when, a week ahead of time, she saw
his kayack floating like a dry leaf opposite the camp. He came
ashore, rubbed her nose in a rather thoughtful manner, asked a few
ordinary questions, ate heartily, and resumed life in the good
old-fashioned way. But never a word he said of what had transpired
at Herschell Island. She endured this for some days, then went at
him.</p>

<p>"It is in my mind that after talking with Atokwok you journeyed
to see certain magic. Did you see it?"</p>

<p>He nodded stolidly.</p>

<p>"It was great magic?"</p>

<p>"Too great for a woman to understand."</p>

<p>She turned that over for a moment, and presently sent him a
knowing glance.</p>

<p>"Where is your skinning-knife with the walrus-tusk handle? Mine
is broken."</p>

<p>"I lost it, and therefore bought another. Also I bought this for
you."</p>

<p>He drew out a small packet, the contents of which had cost him
much thought. It was a purchase made from the cook of the whaler on
the way back from Herschell Island, and paid for with an otter
skin. He had anticipated awkward questions from his life's partner,
questions he was not prepared to meet, so with the wisdom that may
be found on the Beaufort Sea as well as off it, pitched on the
oblique method of evasion. Women, if diverted, give no trouble.
Therefore divert them. He handed Oomgah the packet.</p>

<p>Inside she found a four-inch shaving-glass, backed with copper.
Her lips widened in delight as she stared into it and saw the
moonlike, globular face, with rows of rusty teeth, broken and
jagged from much chewing of walrus hide. Here was a great treasure,
and what a husband was hers! So she laid her round oily cheek
against his, gurgling her satisfaction.</p>

<p>"It may be that you saw other women at the island?" she said
throatily.</p>

<p>He shuddered a little. "Yes, one devil woman."</p>

<p>"Was she beautiful?"</p>

<p>He made a gesture, and surveyed her critically. "Yes, but not so
beautiful as you."</p>

<p>"Then she will not come between us?"</p>

<p>"Never!" said Peeguk triumphantly. "I killed her!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>THE PASSING OF CHANTIE, THE
CURLEW</h2>

<p>This is a tale of the year of the great sickness that came to
the small brown people who live on the shores of Grant Island where
it fringes the eastern borders of the Beaufort Sea. Of necessity
such tales ate told simply, as one speaks to a child or to those
who are very old, for they deal with those who walk carefully and
are slow of speech. And the reason is that death is never very far
away.</p>

<p>The North is a stern mother to the tribes that tenant her silent
places. She feeds them for a time, then, perchance, starves them.
She bakes them under a, torrid sun and, in a little while, strikes
them with killing winds. She smiles across leagues of sunny waters
that soon are hidden beneath endless fields of grinding ice. She
dangles her purple Aurora in the zenith that all may see and
marvel, but out of her unknown regions come roaring the storms that
no man may face and live. So beneath her threats and caresses the
brown people are what they are: brave, simple and uncomplaining;
wistful, because they know not when the end may come; loving the
slant-eyed children for whose safety they are ready to die;
generous, because hunger is brother to all, and, when old age
comes, facing the final great adventure with unquestioning
fortitude and faith.</p>

<p>Chantie, the Curlew, was smitten with many years. The last great
event in her life had been when Oulibut, the Shining Ice, went the
way of his fathers in a fine new igloo with a walrus tusk on top to
signify that this was the place of death. She never forgot that,
even though life had gone hard with her ever since. Now she was
sixty-five. The way she reckoned this was by the number of times
she could remember the breaking up of the ice on Beaufort Sea added
to her age when she could begin to count. And at sixty-five she
lived with Metauk, her son, and his two children, Tilligoo and
Nanook. Metauk had married late, and soon after the children came
his wife had run a poisoned fish-hook into her palm and gone out
into the unknown, babbling strange and non-understandable
things.</p>

<p>It was the year after that when the great sickness came to Grant
Island. Elsewhere it would have been called measles, and treated
accordingly, but to the small brown people it was a scourge laid on
them by the Great Spirit who had a habit of expressing himself in
various recognisable ways. One could, therefore, but wait and see
how heavily the punishment would fall. So the scourge spread from
point to point, from bay to bay, from igloo to igloo, till morning
after morning there set forth fewer and fewer hunters over the
field ice, and in the scattered igloos the tribe of Metauk lay on
their backs with swollen and distorted faces, staring at the
curving walls that shut out Unorri, the North Wind, indifferent
alike to the yelping of famished dogs and the dwindling complaint
of starving children.</p>

<p>They died&mdash;here a hunter, there a woman and there a child,
and what became of the dead it were better not to ask. Perhaps the
white foxes knew, or those lean and dreadful shapes that came by
night from the nearby hills. Simultaneously it seemed that the
salmon deserted the shallow waters, for they swam no longer with
slowly-waving fins beneath the igloo's floor, while the sinew line
with its bone hook hung slack; and motionless in the emerald
depths.</p>

<p>And if within the homes of the tribe of Metauk there was disease
and death, the surrounding plains held that which was equally
forbidding. Day after day, night after night, droned Unorri from
the speechless north, unconquerably bitter. With the wind came a
fine driving snow that stung like hot sand and made even the polar
bear blink his yellow eyes. The outlines of the rocky ridges were
smoothed into gentle curves; the stars, when visible, were diamond
pin-points immeasurably distant; across the ice-fields vast
pressure ridges were thrust up, creaking and groaning, and even the
ancient earth herself seemed to contract and shrink beneath her
spotless blanket.</p>

<p>It was the finger of Fate that kept old Chantie from the curse.
It may be that she was too dry and shrivelled to yield to disease.
Her gums were fleshless, her skin like parchment&mdash;brown and
crackling with age, and her eyes had receded till they were no more
than black slits in a leathern mask. Her chief sensations were love
for Nanook and Tilligoo, and a consciousness of having forgotten
many things. She was famished like the rest, but her hunger soon
became submerged in a vast pity for the children. At night she lay
awake for hours, pinching her withered breast and thinking of the
days when Metauk's small sleek head lay against her warm smooth
shoulder. She wondered if Oulibut, who had gone to the place where
there was always good hunting and fishing&mdash;and no sickness,
could see them now, and what he thought about it. Just then the
children stopped babbling, and she became aware of a voice thick,
and scarcely recognisable. It was the voice of Metauk. He had
turned on his side so that she could just make out his distorted
face.</p>

<p>"How long have I been thus?"</p>

<p>"I know not, but for many days."</p>

<p>"Then give me food. My belly is like a water-hole in which there
is no water."</p>

<p>The old woman shook her tousled head. "Were there food Tilligoo
had eaten it long ago. There is none."</p>

<p>At that Metauk propped himself up. He was not a pretty sight,
for his head seemed as large as his body.</p>

<p>"Then go to the igloo of Aivick and ask for seal meat. All women
are fools, especially the old ones."</p>

<p>"There is no meat in that igloo," said Chantie patiently, "nor
will Aivick bring home any more. The sickness took him and he is
dead."</p>

<p>Metauk made a choking little noise in his throat. "Speak then to
Pituluk or some of the others, for the walls of my stomach are
cleaving together and the strength has run out of my bones."</p>

<p>"Pituluk is even like yourself, calling for food when there is
none to give. The salmon have gone down to the floor of the sea,
and the curse lies so heavy that there is not one hunter who can
take up his spear. The white foxes are fat, but the tribe of Metauk
is very lean."</p>

<p>"And the sickness has spared you, 0! worthless one?"</p>

<p>Chantie nodded. She knew that she was worthless. About all that
she had been good for during past years was to chew the edges of
walrus skins to make them soft for sewing into boots and kayack
coverings, which meant that her teeth. had dwindled to a few jagged
roots. The sickness had doubtless spared her because she was not
worth the taking. It was not any sign of humility to admit this.
The thing was obvious.</p>

<p>"What is there I can do?" she croaked despondently. "The Great
Spirit walks about in the storm and is angered. "Who am I to reason
with him?" There is no blood in my body, or I would give it to the
children; and I, too, am very weak."</p>

<p>The hunter groaned and lay back. Fire was in his veins and
strange lights danced before his eyes. There was no strength in him
either. Further than that, he was filled with a queer sense of
shame at his own impotence. It cut him to the heart that his
children should be famished and he unable to feed them. Why should
he be struck down, and this old crone spared?</p>

<p>"Do what no other woman has done in the tribe," he grunted
sarcastically, feeling the fever overtake him again, "and go out
and kill something that we may eat."</p>

<p>Chantie did not answer. Presently she stooped over Nanook and
put the end of a strip of walrus hide between the boy's dry lips,
at which they began to mumble vigorously. It was all there was was
to suck in that igloo. Her mind was working slowly, and creaked
while it worked. She did not fear death for herself, but did not
want to leave these small ones to die alone. Outside came a whimper
from the dogs. Days ago she had tried to spear one of them, but the
team had danced away out of reach, reading only too well the
meaning of the weapon that quivered in her skinny hand. By now they
themselves were half-mad with hunger, and, reflected Chantie, dog
would soon eat dog.</p>

<p>She drifted off into a sort of blind wonder at what it all
meant. She could not remember having deliberately offended the
Great Spirit, but something must have happened. Through her pagan
mind passed the simple panorama of pagan life. Killing and eating,
sleep and journey, effort and rest, the igloo in the lee of the
pressure ridge, the straining sledge wriggling between a multitude
of hummocks, the square flipper, warm and bloody beside his
air-hole, the writhing salmon on the igloo floor, life and death
and dim memories of affection in olden days, the passing of Oulibut
as passes a chief&mdash;these were the pictures on the screen of
her mind. She was thankful for them. They almost warmed her.</p>

<p>It was hours later when there came suddenly from the team a new
note in which fear and excitement were sharply mingled. Metauk
heard it through his stupor and began to babble of the hunts of
other days. Chantie heard it, and the blood in her ancient veins
coursed the faster, for with the voice of the dogs was a deeper,
hoarser sound, half-cough, half-grunt, that was unmistakable. The
white bear walked abroad that night.</p>

<p>She waited, and the sound came closer. The monarch of the North
was in no danger from Metauk's team, and he seemed to know it. A
half-starved dog meant no more to him than a snowflake. It was
plain that he too was hungry, for there was anger in his grunt and
his shuffling stride was carrying him nearer and nearer to the
rounded dome of the house of Metauk. He could not catch a dog, but
there was quarry here for the taking. Presently he upreared his
gigantic height, took one vicious stroke at the nearest dog that
broke its back, and laid his broad, sharp-taloned paws on the
curving walls.</p>

<p>Chantie trembled and shook the hunter by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Awake, Metauk, and kill," she quavered, "or you will die in
your sleep, and all of us with you."</p>

<p>But Metauk could not hear, having drifted off to regions where
even the white bear was harmless. He only mumbled unintelligible
things, pushing out his swollen lips and tossing his fevered body.
Tilligoo and Nanook as well were unconscious, a shapeless, tumbled
mound in the half-light. The terror of Chantie rose to madness and
she wrung her withered hands. The claws of the bear were cutting
deep grooves in the rounded roof. Presently he would get foothold
and climb up. Then the roof would collapse.</p>

<p>At this moment the querulous complaint of Metauk came back to
her, demanding why she did not go out and kill something that he
might eat. She had wondered vaguely what there was that an old
woman might kill, and now, impelled by a strange impulse, she
reached convulsively for the hunter's long, stiff-bladed spear. She
shivered at the touch of it, for this meant death, but there seemed
nothing else to do. And the bear's paws were just two feet from her
grey head, With the snow wall between. She did not look at Metauk
or the small motionless figures on the sleeping-ledge. It was time
for an offering, and just one way in which to make it.</p>

<p>Crawling out on hands and knees, she looked up and saw a white
pyramid, at the base of which snapped the surviving dogs. Never
before had she beheld such a bear. There was a glimmer of moonlight
in which his fur took on a sheen as of silk that rippled in quick
waves with the play of his deep shoulders. He stood like a giant of
a man, his lean arrow-shaped head turned savagely at the pestering
team, his long black claws distended, his massive forearms reaching
nearly to the centre of the igloo dome. At his flanks danced the
dogs, weak with hunger, jaws open, nostrils wrinkled, staggering as
they attacked, their yellow bodies fired with an ancient enmity. It
was a battle of the strong against the weak, to which there could
be but one end.</p>

<p>As Chantie crept into view the brute dropped to all-fours,
recognising a new and different opponent. The man smell came to
him, and he stood, swaying with a slow rocking motion, while
instinct moved disturbingly in the sleek skull. Then the old woman
heard a roaring in her ears that came from her own pounding heart,
and made one weak, uncertain thrust.</p>

<p>It was only a pin-prick and drew no blood, but it roused in the
beast the inherent timidity of man which lurks in all animals,
great and small, so instead of one swift stroke of the broad paw
that would have crushed out whatever life remained in Chantie's
withered body, the lord of the North lunged at the frenzied dogs
and began to shuffle toward the distant hills. Simultaneously the
old woman, who by this time had cast away all fear, perceived that
with him would go all prospect of food. And it was for food that
she had made ready to die.</p>

<p>It must be that in times of utter stress humanity is able to
discard all human weakness and clothe itself with prodigious if
transitory powers. In such periods the vital flame achieves an
unwonted brilliance before it flickers into darkness, and mortality
scales hitherto unconquered heights. So it was with Chantie, the
Curlew. The knowledge that those few who were left to her, and whom
she loved with all her pagan soul, were sick and starving, and that
their salvation depended on the oblation of her own worn-out body,
was all-sufficient. The strength of youth flowed back in a swift,
penultimate tide, bringing with it a strange fire that crept
through vein and sinew and revived wild memories of days long past.
Her fingers stiiffened over the spear, and she stood upright,
straighter than she had stood since the day when Oulibut went into
the igloo with the walrus tusk on top. She was not old any more.
Her voice came back, displacing the raven-like croak of later
years, and with that voice, vibrant and contemptuous, she addressed
the dwindling figure of the lord of the North:</p>

<p>"Are you then a rat and the son of many rats that you run from a
curlew? Do your knees knock together while you seek shelter with
your wife who hides under the snow that she may bear you a son in
peace? Your hide is thick but your blood is thin, and your heart
like that of the small cross-beaked birds that come when the sun is
warm. Stop, therefore, that I may pull your heart out and give it
to the dogs."</p>

<p>Now whether it was the dogs that snapped at his heels or the
effect this stream of derision poured out by the ancient crone as
she stumbled gasping through the drifts, no man can say, but
something penetrated the great carcass so that the bear halted,
and, turning, upreared himself, as though to put an end to so
outrageous a situation. Chantie, seeing this, realised that her
race was nearly run, and what there was left for her to do must be
done very quickly. Therefore she crept up as close as she dared,
and, dropping on one knee, wedged the butt of Metauk's spear into a
cranny of projecting ice, sloping the weapon forward so that it
pointed directly at the great white chest.</p>

<p>"Come, 0! coward with the spirit of a fish," she quavered
shrilly, "and I will throw your entrails to the dogs."</p>

<p>The white pyramid swayed forward to bring this pigmy assailant
within reach of the thick forearms. Chantie involuntarily shut her
eyes, for the lean head was now directly above her own. Then amid
the furious barking of the team she heard a choking grunt. The
spear shaft quivered and bent. She could see nothing, the world
being blotted out by the huge overhanging body, but her stiffened
arm grew suddenly wet. For an instant thus while the vast weight
seemed to poise above her, till, with a crack, the shaft splintered
in her grip, she felt something stinging and searing bite into her
side. Then the heavens fell and crushed her into the snow. The last
thing she heard was a muffled barking that sounded as though it
came from a long way off.</p>

<p>She struggled back to consciousness a little later, feeling that
her side was on fire and her face buried in fur, close and choking,
making it hard to breathe. Slowly her eyes cleared. She was partly
under the bear, which was lying still with the dogs guzzling at his
rent flanks, while the double-edged spear projected stiffly from
the prone carcass. Chantie had no feeling of triumph, but only of
extreme weakness. The fire and the frenzy had passed, leaving her
an old, old woman, wounded to the death, and with her final
offering yet unmade, There was little time now in which to make
it.</p>

<p>She managed to twist herself free, and with ultimate effort
dislodged the spear. The dogs took no notice of her, being too busy
stuffing their empty bellies with hot meat. The spear she found was
but a poor cutting instrument, and it took precious moments to hack
off a lump of dripping flesh. Even as she toiled at this the
strength ran out of her like water, and her stiff fingers became
caked with a grisly glaze. Then the snow fell again like a ghostly
blanket in which she pitted her dwindling vitality against the
onslaught of storm and bitter cold. She did not think at all, but
only laboured, her lips set tight, a strange flicker in her glassy
eyes. And with every movement it was as though the spear were
penetrating her own tortured side. The final oblation was nearly
made now.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Metauk, who was lying motionless in his skin
sleeping-bag, felt something familiar touch his mouth. He could not
open his lips because they were too swollen, but every fibre in his
famished body thrilled to the taste of fresh meat. There was no
asking whence it came, nor could Tilligoo or Nanook put the
question, but all three lay and sucked in strength from the wild
body that so late had roamed the frigid spaces of the North. The
life of the white bear was now theirs, and flowed mysteriously
through every vein. Their faltering heart-beats steadied, their
chilled limbs grew warmer, till presently sleep crept in through
the igloo door and spread its beneficent cloak over the home of
Metauk the hunter.</p>

<p>But there was one whom sleep did not reach. Chantie sat silent
in the gloom, waiting for the sands of life to run out. She managed
to light the stone lamp by using a little of the bear's fat, and
laid the rest of the meat close by the faces of the sick ones so
that by no chance could the miss it. She pulled in the sinew
fishing-line and rebaited the bone hook. If a salmon came now he
would not pass that. She arranged the broken spear with its stained
blade by Metauk's side, that her son might not accuse her or
carelessness, for good spears were scarce on Beaufort Sea. Then
because her breast was burning so that it hurt horribly even to
breathe, she pulled the hood of her walrus-skin tunic over her
head, and lay down on the floor with her face against the igloo
wall. There was nothing more she could remember to do.</p>

<p>Hours passed. Unorri, the North Wind, ceased to moan, and over
the whole stark wilderness spread a strange calm. The stars came
out and with them a quivering Aurora that shook its gleaming
banners in the zenith and shed a soft radiance over the home of
Metauk. The satiated dogs curled up and slept, while four gaunt
forms stole down from the hills toward the stiffened body of the
white bear. All else was motionless, breathless and empty, a vast
and stinging void above which the springing dome of diamonded sky
rose with a great encircling sweep.</p>

<p>It was nearly morning before Metauk moved. He felt
better&mdash;and not nearly so hungry. His lids opened more freely.
Turning, his mouth touched meat. It was frozen solid, but what
difference! He began to tear at it, driving in his strong teeth
with ever-increasing energy. Presently he stopped eating and
puckered his copper-coloured brows.</p>

<p>"Is it then Pituluk who has killed the bear that I dreamed was
climbing on the roof of the igloo, or, "and here the hunter
chuckled derisively, "is it perhaps that an aged curlew with no
feathers in her tail has gone out and brought me the heart of the
lord of the North?"</p>

<p>But Chantie, the Curlew, did not answer.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>THE AFFAIR OF KALAUK, THE
SKILFUL HUNTER</h2>

<p>If you journey by way of the Fox Channel and Boothia Gulf,
turning north along the edge of the Beaufort Sea, you will come to
the place where Kalauk, known to his friends as the Skilful Hunter,
sat in the lee of a wind-whipped rock and stared thoughtfully at
the Arctic Ocean. At a little distance, Kinniuk, the Orphan, played
industriously with the bleached skulls of five square flipper
seals. For the rest of it there was an apology for a tent, made of
walrus hide, Kalauk's skin-covered kayack, lifted delicately beyond
the reach of the waves, a spear or two, three lean and scabious
dogs, a battered, up-ended sledge&mdash;and that was about
all&mdash;except the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>But Kalauk was not conscious of anything being missing&mdash;for
nothing was missing. All his stock-in-trade was here, everything by
which he and the Orphan survived and wrested subsistence from land
and sea and ice. He wondered sometimes how Kinniuk would fare if he
were cast on his own resources, because the boy seemed interested
in all but hunting and fishing, which was a serious handicap for an
Eskimo youth. Also at the moment Kalauk was racking his wits to
contrive how he would get along that coming winter with three dogs
instead of four. Now the way the fourth had gone was by virtue of a
disagreement with a polar bear whose hide was by this time in
Dundee, being carried thither by the whaling captain who happened
along just as the row was over. Presently the father of Kinniuk
made a little noise in his throat whereat the dogs glanced at him
suspiciously out of the tail of their narrow eyes, for this was
summer time in which all the dogs of the North are doubly
treacherous.</p>

<p>"We shall go to-morrow," he said briefly.</p>

<p>The Orphan balanced one shining skull on the other till he had
built up a grinning pyramid. "And where shall we go?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere the seal and salmon are to be found. I shall take the
kayack, while you and the dogs take the shore."</p>

<p>"And the tent?" put in Kinniuk anxiously.</p>

<p>"If the weather be fine I shall take the tent also, but if not
it shall be yours to carry. Have I not said this same thing to you
many times already?"</p>

<p>Kinniuk only grunted. As a matter of fact he had heard this
edict pronounced ever since he could remember. He also knew that
nothing was quite so hard to bear, and nothing made him quite so
furious as to go stumbling over rocks and hills for endless miles
with that shapeless lump balanced on his shoulders and watch at the
same time his father skimming along a mile from shore with only an
occasional stroke of his long double-bladed paddle. Then there were
the dogs. He confessed privately to an aversion for dogs, which in
itself was an extraordinary thing for an Eskimo of any age. And it
seemed now that he spent most of his life with them&mdash;which was
perfectly true, because there was no other society whatever. The
real trouble with Kinniuk was that he felt unutterably
lonely&mdash;and did not know it. His mother had died years before
when the woman's oomiak, or skin boat, had capsized in a bay of
Ellesmere Island while they moved camp in the absence of the
hunters; and since her Umak, or guardian spirit, had appeared
several times to her husband, with warnings of what would happen if
he took another spouse, it was very unlikely that the latter would
take any chances whatever in this intimate business.</p>

<p>"How far do we go this time?" said the boy sulkily.</p>

<p>"Till you reach the spot where I shall be waiting for you," was
the placid answer.</p>

<p>Kalauk did not say anything more, but chewed contentedly at the
last fragment of the last square flipper seal he had killed. There
were more where that one had come from, so he did not worry, and
even should he not kill for the next few days, he was fat enough
and oily enough to exist for a considerable time without serious
discomfort. What he really wanted was another dog. And there were
no females left in his team after that incident with the polar bear
the winter before.</p>

<p>About noon on the following day Kinniuk flung himself down on a
ledge that overhung a long narrow bay, and fixed his black eyes on
his father's kayack that danced lightly from wave to wave something
more than a mile distant. He had never seen anything quite so
effortless in his life, though he had seen it many times before.
The boy himself was exceedingly hot from the awkward weight on the
small of his back, and the dogs seemed possessed of many devils.
The naked country all round was shimmering in the bright sun of the
short Arctic summer, and except in the lee of the ridges there was
no shade. He dared not leave the bundle of walrus skin for an
instant, or the dogs would have got at it. Presently the nearest of
them put a long quivering nose into the air, sniffed at something
that crept into his black, expanded nostrils and sent out a quick,
excited whimper. In the next moment he tore off straight inland,
his lean belly close to the ground, and the other two leaping after
him so closely that they looked like a narrow, dirty wave of yellow
fur. Kinniuk blinked. He could not swear. And this for the reason
that only those folk who claim to have escaped from savagery know
how to swear.</p>

<p>From a spur of the stark hills that lifted to the southward came
a wild medley of sound, in which the frenzied barking of Kalauk's
team was punctuated by another note, higher, sharper and even more
wild. Kinniuk held his breath and listened, till there shot into
his mind a startling thought that made him forget instantly about
the bundle that was torturing his soul. And at that he dashed off,
rolling as he want like a coal barge in a gale, for the Eskimo is
built for strength rather than speed. In ten minutes he knew what
the trouble was.</p>

<p>Squatting on its haunches in the midst of the pack was a thing
which save for the length of its legs was half the size of the
smallest dog, and Kinniuk knew it in a minute for a wolf pup. It
was not the brown wolf of the timber country far to the south, nor
yet the wolf of the Land of Little Sticks, but the great grey
Arctic wolf, the terror of the North. The dogs seemed to know it
too, for even now when it was but a quarter grown and had but a
fraction of its ultimate strength, they danced just out of reach of
the long jaws and sharp teeth that were already formidable. But
Kinniuk saw that the odds were too heavy and the end could not be
far away. The grey flanks were already torn, and a gaping cut
widened in the bony shoulder.</p>

<p>And then a curious thing happened, for the wolf's eyes met the
boy's eyes and it seemed that in some strange way there flashed
from the former a sort of swift, proud appeal. Of course, as
Kinniuk instantly realised, it could be nothing of the kind, but
nevertheless there sped between these two pups of the North, animal
and human, that which was in some mysterious fashion mutually
understood. Simultaneously, and this was strangest of all, every
vestige of fear was emptied out of Kinniuk's heart just as one
empties sea-water out of a skin bucket. He saw the wolf
pup&mdash;and loved it. He saw the yelping dogs&mdash;and for the
first time in his life despised them.</p>

<p>Now it is given to some to understand, and to others to seek
diligently and yet understand not at all, and this applies to both
men and beasts. So if you ask how it was that Kinniuk was able to
cast away all fear, and how it came that the wolf pup, when the boy
had beaten back the snarling team, lurched weakly forward and with
an upward glance of narrow, yellow eyes laid his lean head between
the boy's feet, it may simply be said that the North has mysteries
of its own, and the empty spaces of the world are not more devoid
of wonders than the teeming city.</p>

<p>Thus it came that in the fullness of time the team of Kalauk,
the Skilful Hunter, was made complete, but it is told along the
shore of Ellesmere Island and in many a cranny of the Arctic that
in the making there was much tribulation. Between Amerauk, the
wolf, and the dogs there was warfare till the increasing strength
of the former, combined with the sharpness of his teeth and his
amazing quickness of action, brought him gradually but surely to
the leadership of the team. Through battle after battle he forged
steadily ahead, and with scarred flanks and long white cicatrices
on his bony skull emerged the undisputed master, Kalauk stood by,
marvelling, and held his peace, for it seemed that with the wolf
pup the boy Kinniuk was also finding himself. It was after watching
wolf pup and man pup hunt the coast caribou that Kalauk consulted
Kitamauk, the Sorcerer, who happened to come that way, and was told
that the matter was none of his affair. Then, not being entirely
satisfied with Kitamauk, whose reputation in the Beaufort Sea was
somewhat questionable, he broached the subject direct on an evening
when he was full of seal meat and good-nature.</p>

<p>"How is it, Kinniuk, that you, being once afraid of dogs, have
now no fear of a wolf? It is not many months since your courage was
like the seawater that runs away through the sand till there is
nothing left."</p>

<p>The boy grinned contentedly. He was curled up in a shapeless
mound, his fingers playing with the long white hair that waved on
Amerauk's throat. The lank jaws were open, disclosing a red cavern
of mouth, roofed with black. The brute lay motionless, his yellow
eyes fixed on his master.</p>

<p>"We understand, the wolf and I&mdash;-that is all."</p>

<p>"But it is not written that a wolf can understand, unless he be
possessed of an evil spirit."</p>

<p>Kinniuk shook his head. "His spirit is not evil. I think it is
that of my mother which has returned. Then why should I fear
it?"</p>

<p>Kalauk glanced at him sharply. If here indeed were the spirit of
his late wife, there was nothing for him to fear either. His mind
went back to the time when Chiooka, which means the Woman with the
Round Nose, was alive, and it began to appear that he had not
always treated her quite as well as he might. In fact he distinctly
remembered several occasions when he had not. So it seemed
uncomfortably possible that Chiooka, who had been very devoted to
Kinniuk, was seizing this opportunity to return to earth and even
the score. Kalauk had been about to venture stroking the beast, but
this last reflection made him hesitate. Just then Amerauk yawned,
and one could see about a foot farther down his throat. The hunter
decided not to do any stroking at that moment, and Kinniuk made a
little gesture of amusement.</p>

<p>"It is in my stomach to ask you why it is that you are afraid of
the wolf if I am not, especially should this be indeed your wife."
The boy drawled this out in a voice that Kalauk found distinctly
irritating. "Would my father, who is known to be brave, not do what
I do?"</p>

<p>"Thou art a fool. All my life I have done that which would turn
thy bones to water."</p>

<p>"Look," said Kinniuk, and, rolling over, took the brute by one
torn ear, then, with a chuckle, thrust an oily hand straight into
the cavernous mouth. Amerauk did not stir, but a quick light dawned
in the savage eyes and the saliva dripped from his rigid jaws. For
a moment thus, man pup and wolf pup, till with a little laugh the
boy withdrew his slimy fingers and gave that terrible head a
playful push as though to signal that the game was over.</p>

<p>"Will my father, the Skilful Hunter, do this? Surely HIS bones,
which are more ancient than mine, will not turn to water."</p>

<p>Kalauk hesitated, feeling as uncomfortable as he had the summer
before when a bull walrus decided to come to the surface
immediately beneath his kayack, with results that were nearly
disastrous. Also he noted that Amerauk was now regarding him with
an expression remarkably like the one which used to rest on the
face of Chiooka when he had been more than usually unkind. It
suggested that the time was coming, and it puzzled him greatly to
imagine just how a wolf could manage to convey that idea. So,
putting all things together, he could see no reason for taking any
chances that might be avoided.</p>

<p>"It may be that thy mother. being regretful at having given
birth to so great a fool as thou art, is now sorry for thee and
will not bite," he said contemptuously: "and, because she had thee
for a son, is now punished and made to wear the skin of a wolf. Of
these things I will speak to Kitamauk, the Sorcerer, when he
returns this way from his hunting."</p>

<p>A low growl rumbled threateningly in the shaggy throat, at which
Kalauk moved a little farther off, while Kinniuk laughed
delightedly. "My mother says that it will be well for both you and
Kitamauk if there be no more talk of this matter." He got up, shook
himself and laid a caressing hand on the lean head. "Now we go to
hunt the coast caribou, Amerauk and I, for it seems that the
hunting of my father is of no avail and we be hungry, we two
together." He paused, then added meaningly. "If Amerauk should run
perchance on thy spear when the night is dark and be killed, the
spirit of my mother may take on another shape which would please
thee even less than this one. It is well to think sometimes of
these things, and to-night there will be much meat."</p>

<p>He strolled off, the grey shape at his heels, while Kalauk
stared silently after him. The conversation had taken a most
unfortunate turn. It was perfectly true that the Skilful Hunter had
contemplated putting a sudden end to these embarrassing
circumstances, but he had never imagined the possible results as
Kinniuk now pictured them, and no man could look forward to
spending the rest of his life in trying to kill his late wife every
time she assumed a new guise. The whole affair was full of awkward
complications, and the more he reflected the more puzzled he got.
Just then the hunting cry of the grey wolf sounded from inland, and
he ran quickly to the top of the nearest ridge to watch Amerauk in
action.</p>

<p>Lying on his stomach, he peered eastward over the great tundra,
which now in the swimming warmth of summer was a series of long,
low, rolling undulations of rock, covered partly with tufted moss
and interspersed by lakes where the wildfowl reared their families
with a whistling and calling and quacking that went on day and
night. Between two of these lakes he discerned a small band of
coast caribou, all females who had come north without the bulls to
bear their young. There were perhaps a dozen of them, crowded close
together, the calves in the middle and protected for the moment by
the jostling of their mothers' tawny yellow bodies on which the new
hair grew in great smooth patches, for this was the season when fur
and feather in the North discard their old coats ere donning the
new ones that nature so marvellously provides against the bitter
weather to come. But Kalauk was not interested in this, which was
an old story to him. His eyes were fixed on a lean, yellow-white
shape that darted in dizzy circles around the terrified deer.</p>

<p>It seemed that Amerauk was playing with his quarry ere he
struck. Faster and faster he flew, his shaggy belly close to the
ground, while the terrible head, thrust straight out in dreadful
expectation, and the white brush trailing straight behind,
transformed him into a sort of arrow of destruction. He moved not
as a dog moves in leaps, but in a sort of streaming rapidity that
was independent of time or distance, an animal projectile, sharp of
tooth and of inexpressible ferocity. Kalauk waited and held his
breath. What chance bad anything that lived in the North, save only
the white bear himself, against an enemy like this?</p>

<p>Presently Amerauk wearied of his sport, and, swerving like
lightning, made one vicious upward stroke at the throat of a
trembling cow whose body projected a little farther than the
others. Kalauk's eye, sharp though it was, could hardly follow, but
he noted in the next moment that the cow had begun to stagger,
while from the frightened calves came a piteous bleating. The group
swayed, lost formation, recovered it again and huddled still
closer. The large soft eyes were fixed on the common foe, but there
was nothing to fight with, and the sharp horns of the bulls were
five hundred miles away in the Land of Little Sticks. Amerauk
swerved again, and this time, as though in a royal and savage
disgust at such helplessness, dashed straight in, fastened with one
leap at the cow's throat and pulled her down. The band wavered and
broke. Came a clatter of flying hoofs on the bare rock and the big
beasts dispersed in winged terror, some to the east, some to the
south. In a moment the wilderness swallowed them, calf and cow,
till there was left only that half-dead mound of matted hide, with
the gaunt brute fastened at the torn throat. And then, most
terrible of all, there rose into the throbbing silence that note of
fear which speaks of peril in the empty spaces, the grey wolf
calling to the pack.</p>

<p>It was an hour later before Kinniuk, burdened as to the
shoulders with a bloody load, tramped into camp. At his heels was
Amerauk, with bulging sides, and it was evident that man pup and
wolf pup had both eaten to the full capacity of their stomachs.
Kinniuk dropped his trophy at Kalauk's feet without a word, which
the latter found particularly irritating, while Amerauk, with his
black lips lifted a little, rejoined the team. The team smelled
fresh meat, looked furtively at their leader, and did nothing.
Kinniuk's skin was full to bursting, and for a while he said not a
word, but lay on the flat of his back, his fat hands under his oily
head.</p>

<p>"Where will my father hunt this winter?" he hazarded after a
long silence, speaking casually as though it did not really matter
very much.</p>

<p>"It is in my mind to go to the Bay of the Black Rock, there
being shallow water at the mouth of the bay where the square
flipper is found. But what has a child to do with such things?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps nothing, but it may be that the spirit of my mother
will have something to say."</p>

<p>Kalauk felt a sudden surge of anger at this impertinence, and
put out a hand as though to take the boy by the ear, when in that
second something drew his eye to the leader of his team. The beast
was staring at him with just the expression of resentment that
Chiuka used to wear when he lost his temper in the years that were
past. At least this is what Kalauk thought he recognised, while
added to it was a warning rumble in the shaggy throat totally
unlike any sound Chiooka had ever made. Hastily he withdrew the
hand, wondering hotly whether in all the country there could be
another Skilful Hunter in such a position as this.</p>

<p>"Where else would I go?" he replied, disregarding all reference
to his late wife, "Besides, there be many wolves in the hills
behind that bay and it may be that Amerauk would like the company
of his kind."</p>

<p>Kalauk threw out this last in a sort of bravado, when, in a
flash, the great idea came to him. Other wolves! The more the
better, for their desolate cry would drift into his camp night
after night with its ghastly invitation to the leader of his team
to come out and hunt and kill, till after a while Amerauk would
vanish like a spirit indeed and be no more seen. And after that he
would be well content with only three dogs. The more he thought of
this the more he liked it.</p>

<p>"Are you answered, 0! wise one?" he concluded sarcastically.</p>

<p>Kinniuk nodded. "We are content, Amerauk and I."</p>

<p>Now this was the way of it, and in the days when fur and feather
made ready for the bitter weather, the former by putting on their
winter garments and the latter by winnowing their marvellous flight
thousands of miles to the south, and when the lakes and pools were
stiff and glazed and snow had begun to gather in the hollows of the
naked land, Kalauk made camp in the Bay of the Black Rock and spent
much of the night listening for those wild voices which would
surely come before long from the dark hills in the east. Duly in
the small hours of a dead still morning they did come, faint but
unmistakable, and instantly drifted back the answer of Amerauk with
a wild and savage fervour that made the blood run cold.</p>

<p>"It will not be long now," whispered the Skilful Hunter to
himself, and rolled over and slept.</p>

<p>Thus began a strange season in which Kalauk knew not whether he
was dealing with dog or wolf or devil. When morning broke, the
brute was always there, but often it was plain that he had filled
his belly meantime. No man saw his comings and goings. He was still
leader of the team. He did not shirk his work, and pulled with the
best of them. But if the days were Kalauk's, the nights were his
own. Kinniuk would sometimes say that he had heard Amerauk hunting
the night before, then take the great head between his knees and
stare curiously into the formidable eyes. By degrees Kalauk learned
not to notice things, but was conscious of being watched with a
ceaseless vigilance. The situation had begun to burden him heavily,
when one day there grew a dark speck far out on the field ice and
an hour later Kitamauk, the Sorcerer, drove his panting team into
camp. Kalauk breathed a sigh of relief when he saw who it was, and,
as Kinniuk happened to be out with Amerauk, the Skilful Hunter at
once opened his heart to the wisest man on the Beaufort Sea.
Kitamauk, chewing stolidly, listened unmoved, save only for an
occasional flash of his small black eyes. He had known Chiooka.
Presently he gulped down a final fragment of raw and frozen seal
meat.</p>

<p>"It is written that the spirit: of any man or woman may return
to earth, having first chosen the shape it will take, but of many
such happenings this is the most strange."</p>

<p>"Have I not said it is strange?" replied Kalauk impatiently.</p>

<p>"That is true, but you have not seen that the strangeness is
because Chiooka, having once been a woman, now takes the form of a
male wolf."</p>

<p>Kalauk started." I had not thought of that."</p>

<p>"There can be but one reason, which is that while she was a
woman she was so unhappy that she has refused longer to be a female
of any kind."</p>

<p>"But if indeed she does not like me, why then does she stay and
pull my sledge?"</p>

<p>"It is not for you, foolish one, but for Kinniuk that she stays.
Also there may be that she has forgotten, and returns thus to
perform it."</p>

<p>Kalauk felt more than ever uncomfortable, and put a greasy hand
on the other man's knee.</p>

<p>"Then you, wise one, shall tell me what I must do, for there is
not anything I would not do to put an end to this since it makes a
sickness in my stomach. Nor is there anything I will not give thee,
even to the knife I have from the captain of the whaling ship and
the carved tusk that Cunayou, the Image Maker, gave to Chiooka many
moons ago. Speak, therefore, because I hear the voice of Amerauk in
the wind, and like the wind he comes quickly,"</p>

<p>Kitamauk seemed undisturbed. "A thought rises in my mind as the
square flipper to his air hole," he said composedly." Is there not
left any of the bark of the red willow that you traded with the
Yellowknife Indian who fished on Dead Walrus Island?"</p>

<p>The Skilful Hunter choked a little. There was some left, but he
bad not thought it worth while mentioning.</p>

<p>"It may be that half of the bag remains, and it shall be thine
if the thought in thy mind keep on till it gets to the surface.
What is this thought?"</p>

<p>Kitamauk shook his head, and just then Kinniuk shuffled into
camp with Amerauk at his heels. He stared at the Sorcerer, saying
not a word, but the wolf extended a sharp black nose that wrinkled
suspiciously, then made a deep sound in his hairy throat. Kitamauk
stood rigid till the tenseness of the moment passed, when Kinniuk
gave a laugh, and, at a gesture, the beast disappeared. The
Sorcerer glanced after it, a wrinkled smile spreading on his aged
face.</p>

<p>"I would smoke now," he said briefly.</p>

<p>He left next morning, divulging nothing further before he struck
off over the field ice save that he would shortly return for the
knife, the tusk and the tobacco. And with this Kalauk was perforce
content.</p>

<p>A week passed in the Bay of the Black Rock and it seemed to the
Skilful Hunter that the leader of his team was becoming more human
at every nightfall. When the team was needed, Amerauk was in his
place without a word of command. Out on the ice, the long
whip-thong never touched him, because he never needed it, also
because Kalauk had qualms about flogging the spirit of his late
wife. So tractable was the beast, that he wished that Chiooka had
displayed more of the same engaging qualities before she departed.
As to the other dogs, Amerauk lorded it over them with a sort of
royal disdain. They stirred not till he had selected the lump of
seal meat he desired, then slunk forward, tails between their legs.
Thus peace reigned in camp so long as dogs and men attended
strictly to their own business. But always the brute was watching.
Kalauk dreamed of him when he slept, and the belief grew in his
mind that Amerauk was waiting, waiting for that which was yet to
come. As for Kinniuk, the boy only grinned. He was happier than
ever before in his life.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the seventh day another speck appeared on
the hard horizon, and presently Kitamauk's team scrambled over the
rough shore ice. The Sorcerer ran alongside, while a shapeless lump
balanced on the lurching vehicle. Kalauk stared till the lump
detached itself and waddled toward his igloo. Then he saw that it
was a woman. Instinctively he glanced over his shoulder, as he
often did now, at Amerauk. The beast was erect, legs stiff, lips
lifted and the long hair on his spine standing up like the back fin
of a spring salmon. But, which was most amazing of all, the woman
only laughed.</p>

<p>Kitamauk motioned her into the igloo, and with Kalauk crawled in
after her. When they were seated, he coughed importantly and spoke
thus:</p>

<p>"It is without question that the spirit of Chiooka inhabits the
body of the wolf that follows thy son, and being that of a woman is
therefore more troublesome to deal with. So it came to me that the
only way was to call upon another woman, who is the more likely to
understand, we being but men, you and I. Thus it is that I have
brought my sister, Kasiaga, the Flat Face, for whom I have not been
able to find any use these many years."</p>

<p>Kalauk looked at him in wonder. The face of Kasiaga was
undoubtedly as flat as an ice pan. Also her teeth were nearly gone,
the few remaining ones being worn and broken from the interminable
chewing of much walrus hide. Her skin was like old brown leather,
and as tough as a whip-lash. What powers had such a one, marvelled
Kalauk, to charm away the spirit of Chiooka? He could understand
her brother not finding any use for her. Then Kitamauk's dry tones
came in again:</p>

<p>"It is written that while a woman, or even the spirit of a
woman, will stand much from a man, she will not stand anything at
all from another woman. Why this is I do not know, but it always
has been thus since the world began, whereof the place is not far
from here. Also, since I myself am tired of the Flat Face, I bring
her to thee for a wife, and if after this thou art troubled further
with the wolf Amerauk, you need not give me the knife and the tusk
and the bag of Yellowknife tobacco. I have spoken."</p>

<p>Kasiaga croaked Like an amused raven, but Kalauk gasped. He did
not want to marry again, especially a thing like this. And what
would Kinniuk say? He pushed out his lips, tried to speak,
floundered, then made an ineffectual gesture.</p>

<p>"It has come to me in a dream," continued the Sorcerer suavely,
"that you should be very thankful. Otherwise Amerauk will without
doubt demand soon that by right he shall sleep in thy igloo beside
thy son. Furthermore, if thou attempt to kill, the spirit of
Chiooka may inhabit next the body of a white bear."</p>

<p>Silence fell beneath the icy dome, and Kasiaga looked more ugly
every minute, But she would not be as difficult to handle as a
jealous wolf. Kalauk had to admit that. He was still wavering when
Kinniuk pushed in on hands and knees, glanced sharply at Flat Face,
and turned to his father.</p>

<p>"Who is this woman, and where is Amerauk?"</p>

<p>The Skilful Hunter drew a long breath. "The woman is thy new
mother, and where Amerauk is I know not nor care."</p>

<p>Nor did anyone know, even the Sorcerer himself. Amerauk had
vanished like a cloud in the night, taking his terrible but
defeated way back to the silent places where he joined a pack that
hunted in the hills of Grant Island and along the shores of the
Beaufort Sea. In a week he was the leader of the pack, killing the
old grey bitch that had governed it for months past. And often in
the season of bitter weather that followed, Kalauk, as be journeyed
homeward spear in hand, was shadowed by a great, gaunt form that
watched him with fierce, resentful eyes as it drifted like a lost
spirit from rock to rock.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>THE SALVING OF PYACK</h2>

<p>It fell on a night in the bitter season of the year that Peeguk,
the Flat-footed One, was heavy of heart. Unorri, the North Wind,
had been pressing down out of Boothia Gulf for weeks past with a
weight so heavy that it could be felt through the twelve-inch walls
of his igloo, and now he stared moodily at his second wife, Oomgah,
the Moon-faced One, a grim question in his black eyes. She sat
huddled on the snow bench, holding close a shapeless bundle. The
bundle was Pyack, the Late Comer, now nine months old. Pyack had
arrived in the spring of last year with the grey geese from the
south.</p>

<p>The heart of Peeguk ached in many places. The stone lamp was fed
by a shred of seal fat, and when that was consumed there would
follow a great darkness. It was hard to be hungry in the dark. One
would also be cold. So there were three enemies to be faced at
once. The reason it would be cold was that when the fires of the
body run low for lack of fuel, there are opened mysterious passages
by which the enemy of frost may enter. And he always does. They
both knew this.</p>

<p>For many days the North had been shrinking, flattening and
cowering beneath the onslaught of Unorri. Ridges were smoothed out
and crowned by long, crystalline folds from which was whipped
constantly a fine, dry rain of powdery snow, paralleling the earth
six feet deep, a stinging, driving punishment that the lord of the
North himself did not care to face. No food was afoot, no track of
pad or claw imprinted that vast and chilling blanket, so that even
the grey wolf ravened unfed. And when he starves there be many
furred bellies that go empty.</p>

<p>Peeguk, in the past month, had worked inland from Boothia Gulf,
much farther inland than he had ever been before. This because the
ice had jammed thick and solid against the coast, vomiting up great
pressure ridges thirty feet high, so that the air holes of the jar
seal were almost impossible to find, and for the first time in
Peeguk's life the ocean had ceased to be his larder. That, and the
weight of the unending storm, drove him south in search of caribou.
He had saved a little seal fat for Pyack and the stone lamp.</p>

<p>It seemed that there were no caribou. Day after day be scourged
his dogs over the empty plain, and night after night saw them
staggering back unsatisfied. Their ribs projected like barrel
hoops, their hanks were dry sinew, their pads were cracked and
bleeding, the pointed ears lay flat on the lean skulls and the bony
shoulders thrust loose into their walrus-hide collars. One morning
he found four dogs instead of five, and a week later only three.
Now three dogs cannot pull a sledge with a woman and child and the
family gear&mdash;even three that are not famishing. This fact
moved poignantly in Peeguk's mind as he stared at his wife.</p>

<p>"I will kill one," he said, after an hour's silence. She held
the Late Comer a little closer. Without dogs a man cannot travel.
In the North he who travels not, starves&mdash;with those who be
with him. On the other hand, there was no milk in her breast
now&mdash;but only love, and Pyack could not be fed on love. Were
this possible, he would be fat&mdash;very fat. What frightened her
was the alternative with which they were faced.</p>

<p>"Can we not wait another day?"</p>

<p>"The dogs will not wait. Never before have I known one dog to
eat another. It is a very great hunger."</p>

<p>The Late Comer gave a weak whimper, and she felt the small lips
pucker, questingly, against her side.</p>

<p>"Ey-yah, my husband! And what then?"</p>

<p>He fingered his useless spear. "It may be the storm will be
over. Till then the white foxes devour each other in their caves,
and nothing stirs."</p>

<p>He crawled out next morning and grimly surveyed his dogs,
half-buried in the snow. Their narrow eyes never left him. Which,
he pondered, should he kill? Not the black-eared bitch that led the
team. The other two were younger. With bitterness in his heart he
approached the nearest, but the starved brute caught the murder in
his glance and leaped away. He flung his spear and&mdash;missed!
He, Peeguk, missed!</p>

<p>The fact sobered him. Too late to do anything more, for all
three were circling warily, just out of range, as wise as he, and
as loving of their hardbitten life. Dog against man, it would be
now, and what end might not come to this! The long hair bristled on
the lean backs, and, his heart growing cold within him, he turned
and crawled in toward Oomgah.</p>

<p>"The dogs&mdash;they know. I tried to kill one, and missed. They
are now our enemies. I go to hunt again, so you will stay here. Do
not come out."</p>

<p>He stooped over her and, very gently, touched the hidden head of
the Late Comer. Oomgah did not speak, but looked steadfastly into
his eyes. It was all there, the fidelity and tragedy of the life
they had shared together. She wished that Pyack had not
arrived&mdash;it hurt her so when he cried. But evidently they were
all about to die together, and Pyack had only been
hungry&mdash;really hungry&mdash;for three days. The skin was drawn
tight, like brown parchment, over Peeguk's face, his voice was
hollow, and she knew that the strength which had been her pride and
safety had run out of his back and arms and legs. It might be that
he would not return to the igloo, but die in the open, in which
case the dogs&mdash;or the wolves would find him. If he did not
come back she could only seal up the entrance with a block of snow,
cover her face&mdash;and wait. So, because she was aware of all
this, and knew that he also was aware, she spoke no word, but only
nodded. Then Peeguk stooped and went out.</p>

<p>He could never remember much about that day, except that the
dogs were with him, keeping a hundred yards off, one behind, one on
each side. Or were they wolves? He was not quite sure, but they
appeared through the snow flurries, moving like phantoms that gave
no tongue. The wind did not seem so heavy. He had curious visions
of square-flipper seals basking, of salmon crowding up to the
shallow spawning grounds, half-feathered geese waddling near their
nests, stranded whales, cow walrus, very sleek and fat, sunning
themselves&mdash;and all this within a spear's length. But
something told him they were not really there&mdash;only the
dogs.</p>

<p>He did come back&mdash;though empty-handed; bent,
snow-plastered, feet that dragged, his inward fires burning low,
his visage a frosted mask through which the eyes of the man glowed,
hot and desperate. Caribou were in the country! He had seen them,
miles away, drifting, a ghostly herd, across the horizon with life,
heat and salvation in their round and jostling bodies. He followed
for a while, hoping that the wolves might pull one down, or one go
lame. But none went lame, and the grey wolf hunted elsewhere. The
dogs came back with. him, squatting round the igloo, watching,
waiting. Now that they feared each other, they kept the same
distance apart. Peeguk knew what they waited for. But that, he
vowed, would never be.</p>

<p>It was then that there came a rift in the wind. The stinging
drive went out of the powdery snow. It settled, leaving the air
clear. The drone of four weeks past softened to a whisper and died.
The seared feeling in his eyes lessened, and he saw a great white
star burning in the south. In the same moment the old bitch put her
black muzzle into the still air, sought out and captured some
indefinite signal that reached her from the beyond, cocked her
pointed ears, and began a tremulous whimper that swelled and
consolidated into a long, long howl. The other two joined in.</p>

<p>The heart of Peeguk leaped within him, but he dared not stir.
The dogs were looking south&mdash;where the star was. That meant
other dogs, other life! Then, with a shriek, the wind began again,
the powdery snow was once more driven like dust, the star vanished,
and he was left sucking the ice block that covered his short
bristly moustache. He stooped, saw the snow plug at the entrance,
kicked it away, and felt inside in the dark for Oomgah. He put his
arm round her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Come&mdash;we start now. There is a camp not far to the
south."</p>

<p>"It is too late. My legs have turned to water, and I cannot
walk."</p>

<p>"You need not walk. Put Pyack close to your heart and sit on the
sledge."</p>

<p>"You have the dogs again?"</p>

<p>"I am many dogs to-night. Come!"</p>

<p>They lurched southward, wallowing through, she a squat pyramid
of snow, he a staggering but indomitable figure, one with the storm
itself, equalling its ferocity in the strength of one ultimate
purpose, squaring his shoulders that the wind might aid him the
more, his bones like aching rods, sinews like burning wires, the
heart of him pumping defiantly, his whole tortured, striving frame
calling up its last ounce of strength and resistance. Something lay
to the south, how far he did not know, yet something. The dogs had
gone for it, but their trail was instantly obliterated. At times
the star gleamed through, so he followed that, Oomgah swaying
behind him with that which was dearer than life held close to her
dry bosom, concentrating on this one beloved morsel all the warmth
in her fainting body.</p>

<p>She did not know how long it lasted, but the sledge never
stopped once. It seemed like hours after they started that she saw
a gleam. It was the roofs of a cluster of tents, with high snow
walls and lights inside. Then a great barking of dogs, and voices.
She knew that Peeguk tried to lift her from the sledge, but fell in
the snow and did not move.</p>

<p>The rest of it was a dream. When Oomgah woke she felt warm and
comfortable, with the Late Comer sleeping next her side. She lay
very still, examining the tent with half-lidded eyes, soothed by a
tide of strength that crept reassuringly through her body. No sound
of wind now. Peeguk stretched on his back close by, his eyes shut,
his face blistered with frost patches. Near Peeguk sat a white man
who looked at them not at all, but made a writing in something that
she knew was a book. She wondered how he got the writing to put
there. At the back of the tent was a small iron stove, and she
recognised the odour of flaming oil, a different kind of oil. A
lantern hung from the ridge-pole, this pole being the biggest piece
of wood she had ever seen except when the whaler came ashore on
Lost Island. There were piles of robes, and boxes. The white man
had a red face, red hands, a short brown beard, and his eyes were
grey like the sea when the snow comes and the black swans fly
south.</p>

<p>Another man came in, looked at the strangers, and handed the
first one certain small things covered with snow, These being
observed very closely, more writing was made in the the book. Then
the man said something and went out. Soon after that the red-faced
one stood beside Oomgah.</p>

<p>"You are better now?" He spoke in the Husky tongue, a little
stiffly, but quite understandable.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Your name?"</p>

<p>"Oomgah." She touched her breast. "There is also Pyack, of nine
months."</p>

<p>He smiled. "I have seen Pyack. And this man?"</p>

<p>"Peeguk, my husband."</p>

<p>"You have come far?"</p>

<p>Oomgah did not know. "Two moons ago we left the ice because
there was no food. What place is this?"</p>

<p>Macgregor's tawny brows lifted a little. He had been sent out by
the Government at Ottawa to make records of temperature and
snowfall, and learn in general what might be learned of this
section of the wind-whipped North. He saw these to be Coast Eskimo,
and the spot where he now camped was three hundred miles from
salt-water.</p>

<p>"It is not any place when I am gone. How did you find me?"</p>

<p>Peeguk, who had opened his eyes and was listening intently, made
a sound in his throat.</p>

<p>"The bitch, who is leader of my team, smelled something when the
wind dropped. Then the storm came again, covering the dogs' tracks,
but there was a star, and I followed that."</p>

<p>"A star?" said Macgregor gravely.</p>

<p>"There was nothing else to follow."</p>

<p>Silence spread in the tent, and Peeguk said no more, it not
being his place to do the talking. Oomgah sent him a look and
touched her breast again. All was well with the Late Comer.</p>

<p>"And if there had been no star?"</p>

<p>Peeguk made a gesture. "I do not know. My strength had all run
away."</p>

<p>He of the red face nodded understandingly. "You will eat now for
the second time, only a little, for it is not well to fill an empty
stomach too quickly."</p>

<p>"The second time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the second time since last night."</p>

<p>Peeguk marvelled, yet held his peace. But he But he wanted
greatly to know about the dogs. Presently he asked.</p>

<p>"Their bellies are full. We are camped by a lake and there are
many fish under the ice."</p>

<p>Macgregor disappeared, and a Yellowknife Indian brought food in
bowls. Peeguk, like all Huskies, hated the Yellowknives, but this
was no hour for hate. So he took the food from the slim brown
fingers and closed his eyes, burdened with a great wonder. The
inward fire of his body was glowing now.</p>

<p>In the morning he stood on his feet, a man again. The storm had
roared itself out, and the high clear sky held not a cloud. A
bright sun transformed the wilderness into an interminable fleece,
deep sprinkled with captured constellations. Their myriads of
diamond facets sent out a blinding brilliancy of refracted
blue-white rays. Northward from camp stretched a nearly obliterated
furrow that marked the tortuous passage of the sledge.</p>

<p>Macgregor, a quiet man, who had his own way of doing things,
talked with Peeguk that day, saying that he needed a hunter, and
the Yellowknives were of little use in those latitudes. The thing
was settled with few words, and Peeguk told Oomgah as he punched
his spear-handle in the snow to find a drift wind-packed to the
right point for igloo building.</p>

<p>"It is very simple. I will have a rifle, better than the one I
lost through the ice, and we will reach the sea when the geese come
north."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is well, but there was fear in my heart this
morning."</p>

<p>"What kind of fear?"</p>

<p>"In the topeck the red-faced one opened a box. I saw many
strange things small and black, as in a nest. These he fastened
together at the top with fine iron sinews, very many of them. Then
I saw four bottles, very small and standing up straight. There was
light in those bottles, but no fire,"</p>

<p>" You asked nothing of this?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;it being in my mind that this was a devil-box."</p>

<p>Peeguk scratched his head, remembering the devil-woman who stuck
to the wall at Herschell Island and could not be scraped off, and
the man he had tried to stab, but who escaped leaving the woman
with the knife in her breast. Many questions had moved him
concerning this matter, but so far he had not found anyone who
could answer.</p>

<p>"I will speak to the red-faced one," he said gravely, "and it
may be this will do no harm. I have only known of two kinds: one
that speaks with a voice, and thereupon makes a noise like a dog
scratching the ice; and that other at the island, of which I told
you. Keep silent, therefore, till I know more."</p>

<p>Oomgah kept very silent. Above all things, Pyack must not be
exposed to any malign influence. She was very grateful to the
red-faced one, and his eyes were kind, but to her all white men
were mysterious. They had so many potent things at their command.
So, when Peeguk finished the igloo, which he did very soon,
slashing out the big curved blocks so that they fitted without any
trimming, she crawled in thankfully, and felt much more at home.
Peeguk, on the other hand, went straight to Macgregor.</p>

<p>"My woman says that you have a devil-box in the topeck. Is there
danger to the child?"</p>

<p>Macgregor understood perfectly. "There is danger to none. It is
a spirit-box, and not of devils."</p>

<p>Peeguk, knowing something about spirits, felt happier. A spirit
was the thing that went out of you when you died, went clean
through the wall of your igloo, journeyed to find those of your
family who had gone before, gave them the latest news, and lived
with them thereafter in a place where there was much food and no
wind.</p>

<p>"To-night," added Macgregor, "you shall hear it."</p>

<p>"Does it make a noise like a dog scratching the ice when its
speech is done?"</p>

<p>"No, not that one. Not always can I hear it myself, and but
seldom in storms. But to-night will be fine, and," here his voice
softened and he looked oddly at Peeguk, "on this day it says that
which is said on no other of all the year."</p>

<p>"How comes this voice?"</p>

<p>"Through waves of air," said the red-faced one as though to
himself, "and over the clouds from far away." Then he laughed,
while his eyes grew kinder than ever. "It travels like the eagle,
but more swiftly. And to-night I think it will speak to you."</p>

<p>Peeguk immediately told all this to Oomgah, and she came out and
sat in the sun and watched Macgregor. He had set up two poles, and
joined their tops with a long piece of iron sinew. From this he led
another bit into his topeck, where he remained busy for quite a
time, till suddenly sounded such a strange noise that the old
bitch, whose ribs now bulged as though she bad swallowed the Late
Comer, put her tail between her legs and howled grievously. The
other dogs joined in, whereat Peeguk beat them to silence.</p>

<p>Now the rest of that day was like was like ant\y other day,
till, at nightfall, the red-faced one summoned all in camp to his
topeck, leaving the door-flaps open. One could already see some
stars, the biggest of them being that which Peeguk had followed.
When all were seated, the Huskies farthest from the Yellowknives,
Macgregor looked at his watch and, nodding, put his hand in the
spirit-box. Peeguk saw the light born in four small bottles, and
held his breath.</p>

<p>For a moment nothing. Only strange sounds and many clicks. Then,
close beside them, the voice. High, clear, pure as crystal, a voice
that sped on invisible wings. Over rigid lakes, rockbound coast,
snow-buried forest, over the fields of ice and desolation
unspeakable it came. Out of the heavens it descended, the voice of
a child, penetrating the cabin of the trapper, the hidden
trading-post, and wherever man might spread his intercepting
filaments.</p>

<p>"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
field, keeping watch over their flocks by night."</p>

<p>Thus sang tile voice, and sang on, telling of a star that men
followed while the world was young. Peeguk and Oomgah did not
understand a word except about the star. That was natural enough.
Macgregor's eyes were fixed on these children of Time. They too had
followed a star. There came to him the vision of a Woman an an ass,
a Babe at her bosom, and it seemed that between that Woman and
Oomgah, between the Judaean Child and the Late Comer with his
small, pinched, copper-coloured face and strands of coal-black
hair, was every tie of kinship. And the arms of Mary, Mother of
God, in which Divinity rested on a Galilean hillside, why did they
differ from those of Oomgah behind whose dark, low-lidded gaze
moved a thousand questions that world never be answered? So,
thinking of all this, he did not notice that the others, reckoning
the affair to be over, had slipped away, leaving only Peeguk and
his family. Presently the hunter put out a venturesome hand and
touched the box.</p>

<p>"It is very great magic. But may not this thing we have heard be
also heard on some other day of the year?"</p>

<p>"On no other does it mean the same."</p>

<p>"Then it always comes in the bitter weather?"</p>

<p>"Always, Perhaps it is needed more then."</p>

<p>"Is it the day of the death of a great chief?"</p>

<p>"No," said Macgregor gently, "but of the birth of a child."</p>

<p>Peeguk pulled down his black brows. "That is hard of
understanding."</p>

<p>Oomgah looked at him. Then she drew the Late Comer closer to her
breast, and began to sway with a slow rocking motion.</p>

<p>"Ey-yah, my husband," she murmured softly, "I can
understand."</p>
