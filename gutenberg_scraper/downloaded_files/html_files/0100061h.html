THE WAY HOME</h1>

<hr>

<h2>PROEM</h2>

<p>When, having braved the bergs and cyclones of the desolate South
Pacific, and rounded the Horn; having lain becalmed in the
Doldrums, bartered Cross for Plough, and snatched a glimpse of the
Western Isles: when the homeward-bound vessel is come level with
Finisterre and begins to skirt the Bay, those aboard her get the
impression of passing at one stroke into home waters. Gone alike
are polar blasts and perfumed or desert-dry breezes; gone
opalescent dawns, orange-green sunsets, and nights when the very
moon shines warm, the black mass of ocean sluggish as pitch. The
region the homing wanderer now enters is quick with associations.
These tumbling crested marbled seas, now slate-grey, now of a cold
ultramarine, seem but the offings of those that wash his native
shores; and they are peopled for him by the saltwater ghosts of his
ancestors, the great navigators, who traced this road through the
high seas on their voyages of adventure and discovery. The fair
winds that belly the sails, or the head winds that thwart the
vessel's progress, are the romping south-west gales adrip with
moisture, or the bleak north-easters which scour his island home
and make it one of the windy corners of the world. Not a breath of
balmy softness remains. There is a rawness in the air, a keener,
saltier tang; the sad-coloured sky broods low, or is swept by scud
that flies before the wind; trailing mists blot out the horizon.
And these and other indelible memories beginning to pull at his
heartstrings, it is over with his long patience. After tranquilly
enduring the passage of some fifteen thousand watery miles, he now
falls to chafing, and to telling off the days that still divide him
from port and home.</p>

<p>On an autumn morning in the late 'sixties that smart clipper the
<i>Red Jacket</i>, of some seven hundred tons burden, entered the
English Channel, and having rolled about for a while, for want of a
breeze to steady her, picked up a fine free following wind and
forged ahead at a speed of eight and a half knots an hour.</p>

<p>At the eagerly awaited cry of "Land ho!" from the foretop, an
excited bunch of cuddy-passengers and their ladies, all markedly
colonial in dress and bearing, swarmed to the side of the vessel,
and set to raking and probing the distance. Telescopes and
spy-glasses travelled from hand to hand, arms were silhouetted,
exclamations flew, the female gaze, adrift in space, was gallantly
piloted to the sober level of the horizon. And even the most
sceptical convinced that the dusky shadow on the water's rim was,
in truth, the goal of their journeying, three cheers were called
for and given, the gentlemen swung their hats with an "England for
ever!" the ladies blew kisses and fluttered their kerchiefs. But,
their feelings eased, they soon had their fill of staring at what
might equally well have been a cloud or a trail of smoke; and
having settled the wagers laid on this moment, and betted anew on
the day and hour of casting anchor, they accepted the invitation of
a colonial Croesus, and went below to drink a glass to the Old
Country.</p>

<p>Richard Mahony alone remained, though warmly bidden.</p>

<p>"The pleasure of your company, Mr. Mahony, sir!"</p>

<p>"Mayn't we hope, doctor, for a few words befitting the
occasion?"</p>

<p>He had on the whole been a fairly popular member of the ship's
party. This was thanks to the do-nothing life. Here, on board ship,
he had actually known what it was to feel time hang heavy on his
hands. In consequence, he had come out of his shell, turned
sociable and hearty, taking an interest in his fellow-travellers, a
lead in the diversions of the voyage. And the golden weeks of
sunshine and sea air having made a new man of him&mdash;in looks he
resembled a younger brother of the lean and haggard individual who
had climbed the ship's ladder&mdash;he was able for once harmlessly
to enjoy the passing hour. Again, a genuine sea-lover, he had found
not one of the ninety odd days spent afloat unbearable; and in
refusing to be daunted&mdash;either by the poor, rough food, or the
close quarters; or during a hurricane, when the very cabins were
awash; or again in the tropics, when the ship lay motionless on a
glassy sea, the cruel sun straight overhead&mdash;by making light
of inconvenience and discomfort, he had helped others, too, to put
a brave face on them. Nobody guessed how easy it came to him. His
cheerfulness was counted to him for a virtue, and set him high in
general favour; people fell into the way of running to him not only
with their ailments but their troubles; looked to him to smooth out
the frictions that were the crop of this overlong voyage. So
unusual a state of things could not last. And, indeed, with the
vessel's first knot in northern waters, he had become sensitively
aware of a cooling-off. Let but a foot meet the shore, and the
whole ill-mixed company would scatter to the winds, never to
reassemble. Well, he, for one, would not feel that his ties with
the colony were broken beyond repair until this had happened, and
he had seen the last of all these boisterous, kindly, vulgar
people.</p>

<p>The liking was chiefly on their part. For though, since setting
sail, he had been rid of the big-mouthed colonial boaster, and
among runaways like himself, men who were almost as glad as he to
turn their backs on Australia&mdash;but a single one of the thirty
cabin-passengers contemplated returning&mdash;this was far from
saying that he had found in them congenial spirits. They chafed him
in ways they did not dream of. The Midases of the party&mdash;it
was ruled sharply off into those who had amassed a fortune and
those who patently had not; none went "home" but for one or other
reason; he himself was the only half tint on the
palette&mdash;these lucky specimens were for ever trumpeting the
opinion that the colonies were a good enough place in which to fill
your money-bags; but to empty them, you repaired to more civilised
climes. And to hear his case&mdash;or at least what had once been
his intention&mdash;put thus crudely made Mahony wince. The
speakers reminded him of underbred guests, who start belittling
their entertainment before they are fairly over their host's
door-sill. At the same time he had to laugh in his sleeve. For
where, pray, could Monsieur le Boucher and Monsieur l'Epicier undo
their purse-strings to better effect, find a society more exactly
cut to their shape, than in the Antipodes, where no display was too
showy, no banquet too sumptuous, no finery too loud; and where the
man who could slap a well-filled pocket was anyone's
equal?&mdash;Even less to his taste was the group of lean kine.
With nothing to show for themselves but broken health and shattered
illusions, these men saw the land of their exile through the smoked
glasses of hate, and had not a single good word to say for it.
Which of course was nonsense.</p>

<p>And so it came about that Mary was sometimes agreeably surprised
to hear Richard, if not exactly standing up for the colony, at
least not helping to swell the choir of its detractors. This was
unending, went round and round like a catch. People outdid one
another in discovering fresh grounds for their aversion. Besides
the common grievances&mdash;the droughts and floods, the dust winds
and hot winds, the bare, ugly landscape, the seven plagues of
winged and creeping things&mdash;many a small private grudge was
owned to, and by the most unlikely lips. Here was a burly tanner
who had missed the glimmer of twilight, been vexed at the sudden
onrush of the dark. Another grumbler bemoaned the fact that, just
when you looked for snow and holly-berries: "Hanged if there ain't
the pitches and appricoats ripe and ready to tumble into your
mouth!"</p>

<p>"An onnatcheral country, and that's the truth."</p>

<p>"The wrong side of the world, say I&mdash;the under side."</p>

<p>Quaint home-sicknesses cropped up, too. On board was a skinny
little colonist from the Moreton Bay district, with, as the Irish
wit of the company had it, "the face of his own granddad upon his
shoulders"&mdash;who was, that is to say, more deeply wrinkled than
the bewrinkled rest. Where this man came from, dirt was not: the
little weatherboard houses were as clean when they dropped to
pieces as when first run up. He it was who now confessed to an odd
itch to see again the grime and squalor of London town: the shiny
black mud that served as mortar to the paving-stones; the beds of
slush into which, on a rainy day, the crossing-sweepers
voluptuously plunged their brooms; the smoke-stained buildings;
monuments tarred with the dirt of ages. He wanted to feel his cheek
stung by the mixture of flying fodder and dry ordure that whirls
the streets, does the east wind go; to sniff the heavy smell of
soot and frost that greets the Londoner's nose on a winter
morning&mdash;even to choke and smother in a London fog.</p>

<p>No one smiled.</p>

<p>"Aye, it's what one's born to that tells; what one comes back to
in the end," nodded a pursy builder, whose gold watch-chain, hung
with seals and coins, was draped across his waistcoat like a line
of gala bunting. "I knew a man, gents&mdash;it's a fact I'm tellin'
you!&mdash;who could 'a bought out the up-country township he lived
in twice and three times over; and yet I'm blessed if this old
Johnny-bono didn't as good as turn on the waterworks when he spoke
o' the pokey old cottage down Devon way, where he'd been young.
Seemed as if all the good smells o' the rest o' the world couldn't
make up to him for a bit o' peat burnin' on a still winter's
evenin'; or new thatch smellin' in the rains or the softish stink
o' the milch-cows' dung in long wet meadow grass."</p>

<p>That white raven, "the man who was going back," held aloof from
the sentimentalists. Was he however present at such a sitting, he
kept silence, an ambiguous expression on his face. Once only, in a
conversation engineered by Mahony out of curiosity, did he speak
up. And then it was with a disagreeable overbearing. "I left
England, sir, six years since, because man isn't a sprite to live
on air alone. My father went half-starved all his days&mdash;he was
a farmhand, and reared a family o' nine on eleven bob a week. He
didn't taste meat from one year's end to another. Out yon
"&mdash;and he pointed with his cutty-pipe over his
shoulder&mdash;" I've ate meat three times a day. I've a snug
little crib of me own and a few acres o' land, and I've come home
to fetch out me old mother and the young fry. They shall know what
it is to eat their fill every day of the seven, and she'll drive to
chapel of a Sabbath in her own trap and a black silk
gown.&mdash;Nay, be sure I haven't loafed around, nor sat with me
hands before me. There's not much anyone can learn me in the way of
work. But the old country wouldn't either gimme anything to do, nor
yet keep me free, gratis and for nothing."&mdash;And so on, in a
strain dear to the tongues of the lower orders.</p>

<p>These things flitted through Mahony's mind as he stood, chin in
hand, elbow on gunwale, gazing over the last stretch of dividing
sea. Before him lay an aquarelle of softest colouring, all pale
light and misty shadow; and these lyric tints, these shades and
half shades, gripped his heart as the vivid hues of the south never
had. Their very fleetingness charmed. But a little ago and the day
had been blue and sunny, with just a spice of crispness in the air
to remind one that it was autumn. A couple of white bales of cloud,
motionless overhead, had flung gigantic purple shadows, which lay
like painted maps of continents on the glittering sea. But, the
breeze freshening, the clouds had been set in motion; and
simultaneously the shadow-continents, losing their form, had begun
to travel the surface of the water. A rain-shower was coming up
from the west: it drew a curtain over the sky, and robbed the sea
of its colour. Only in the east did a band of light persist, above
which the fringes of the storm cloud hung, sending down straight
black rays. And now the squall was upon them; wind and rain hunted
each other over the waves; the deck slanted, masts and spars
whistled, sails smacked and shrilled.</p>

<p>In the course of that day the vessel was taken in tow, and when,
towards evening, the downpour ceased and Mahony again climbed the
companion-way, a very different scene met his eye. They now drove
through a leaden sea, which the rain had beaten flat, reduced to a
kind of surly quiescence. Above them was an iron-grey sky, evenly
spread and of a fair height, the lower clouds having withdrawn to
the horizon where, in a long, cylinder-like roll, they hung poised
on the water's rim. But this cold and stony aspect of things was
more than made up for. Flush with the ship, looking as though it
had just risen from the waves, was land&mdash;was the English
shore.</p>

<p>At sight of it Mahony had a shock of surprise&mdash;that
thrilled surprise that England holds for those of her sons who
journey back, no matter whence, across the bleak and windy desert
of the seas. Quite so lovely as this, one had not dared to remember
the homeland. There it lay, stretched like an emerald belt against
its drab background, and was as grateful to sun-tired eyes as a
draught of mountain water to a climber's parched throat. Not a rood
of this earth looked barren or unkempt: veritable lawns ran down to
the brink of the cliffs; hedges ruled bosky lines about the
meadows; the villages were bowers of trees &mdash;English trees.
Even the rain had favoured him: his first glimpse of all this
beauty was caught at its freshest, grass and foliage having emerged
from the clouds as if new painted in greenness.</p>

<p>Another aspect of it struck Mary who mounted in his wake,
gloved, shawled and hatted against the evening chills. With an
exclamation of pleasure she cried: "Oh, Richard&mdash;how pretty!
How...how tidy! It looks like...like"&mdash;she hesitated,
searching her memory for the trimmest spot she knew; and
ended&mdash;"doesn't it?...just like the Melbourne Botanic
Gardens."</p>

<p>"It looks too good to be true, my dear."</p>

<p>But he understood what she was trying to say. If the landscape
before them was lovely as a garden, it had also something of a
garden's limitations. There was an air of arrangedness about it; it
might have been laid out according to plan, and on pleasing, but
rather finikin lines; it was all exquisite, but just a trifle
overdressed. And as he followed up the train of thought started by
Mary's words, he was swept through by a sudden consciousness of
England's littleness, her tiny, tight compactness, the narrow
compass that allowed of so intensive a cultivation. These fair
fields in miniature!&mdash;after the wide acreage of the colonial
paddock. These massy hedgerows cutting up the good pasture-land
into chequerboard squares!&mdash;after the thready rail-and-post
fences that offered no hindrance to the eye. These diminutive
clusters of houses huddled wall to wall&mdash;compared with the
sprawling townships set, regardless of ground-space, at the four
corners of immense cross-roads. These narrow, winding lanes and
highways that crawled their mile or so from one village to the near
next&mdash;after the broad, red, rectilinear Australian roads, that
dashed ahead, it might be for the length of a day's journey,
without encountering human habitation. These duly preserved morsels
of woodland, as often as not guarded, they too, by a leafy wall
where songsters trilled-compared with the immense and terrible
bush, bare alike of bird and man: all these forcible contrasts
worked in him as he stood gazing on the fair natural garden of
southern England; and a sensation that was half wonder, half a kind
of protective tenderness, called at the same time a smile to his
lips and tears to his eyes. In face of this adorable littleness,
this miniature perfection, his feelings were those of the nomad son
who, weary of beating up and down the world, turns home at last to
rest on the untravelled heart of his mother. Here the familiar
atmosphere of his childhood laps him round; and he breathes it
greedily &mdash;even while he marvels how time has stood still for
the home-keepers, and asks himself if he can ever again be one of
them. All the tempestuous years of his youth lie between. He has
fought fire-spueing dragons, suffered shipwreck in Sargasso, bent
the knee at strange shrines. And the sense of an older, tireder
wisdom, which makes of him the ancient, of them the young and
untried, completes the breach. How, knowing what he knows, can he
placidly live through the home day, with its small, safe monotony?
How give up for ever the excitement of great risks taken and met,
on grander shores, under loftier skies?</p>

<p>But a truce to such vapourings! Did the man exist that had it in
him to fret and go unhappy, feel pinioned, and a prisoner while,
round the cliffs of England, now grey, now white, now red, danced
and beckoned the English sea? For who, native to these coasts,
would renounce, once having drawn on it, that heritage of vagrancy
which has come down to him through the ages? Amphibian among the
peoples, has he not learnt to adjust his balance to the sea's
tumblings, his sight to its vast spaces?&mdash;so that into the
English eye has, with time, come a look of remoteness: the
sailor-look, which, from much scouring of horizons, seems to focus
on near objects only with an effort.&mdash;And musing thus, Mahony
believed he knew why, for all its smallness, on this little speck
of an island rising green and crumbly from the waves, there should
have bred a mighty race. It was not in spite of its size, but
because of it. Just because the span of the land was so narrow,
those whose blood ran high could shove off on the unruly element
from their very doorsteps, and whether these looked north or south,
faced sunrise or sunset: the deep-sea fishers, the great
traffickers, the navigators and explorers, the fighting men of the
deep. And with them, so it pleased him to think, no matter for what
point they headed, they bore tidings of the mother-country, and of
her struggles towards a finer liberty, a nicer justice, that should
make of her sons true freemen; for her a difficult task because she
lay isolate, shut off by barriers of foam, a prey to hoary
traditions, and with no land-frontier across which seditious
influences might slip; and yet for her most needful, seeing that
the hearts of her people were restless, indomitable&mdash;had in
them something of the unruliness of her seas. And just as these
rovers carried out news of England, so, homing again, either for a
breathing-space in the great tourney, or, old and feeble, to lay
their bones in English earth, they brought back their quota of
things seen, heard, felt on their Odyssey; a fruity crop of
experience; so that even the chimney-dwellers in England came by a
certain bigness of vision: through the eyes of son or brother they
explored outlandish parts, were present at exotic happenings. And
now, his thoughts turning inward, he asked himself whether even he,
Richard Mahony, in his small way, was not carrying on the great
tradition. Having fared forth in his youth, endured in exile, then
heard and obeyed the home-call, did not he, too, return the richer
for a goodly store of spiritual experience&mdash;<i>his</i>
treasure-trove of life-wisdom&mdash;which might serve to guide
others on their road, or go before them as a warning? And the idea
grew, under his pondering. He saw his race as the guardian of a
vast reserve fund of spiritual force, to which all alike
contributed&mdash;; as each was free at will or at need to draw on
it&mdash;a hoard, not of the things themselves, but of their
ghostly sublimates: the quintessence of all achievement, all
endeavour; of failure, suffering, joy and pain. And, if this image
held, it would throw light on the obscure purpose of such a
seemingly aimless life as his had been; a life ragged with broken
ends. Only in this way, he must believe, had it been possible to
distil the precious drop of oil that was <i>his</i> ultimate
essence. Not ours to judge of the means, or in what our puny
service should consist: why to one should fall the bugles and the
glory&mdash;the dying in splendour for a great cause, or the living
illustriously to noble issues&mdash;to another, a life that was one
long blind stumble, with, for finish, an inglorious end. Faith bid
us believe that, in the sight of the great Foreordainer, all
service was equal. But this we could not know. The veil&mdash;a web
of steel despite its tenuity&mdash;was lowered, and would not rise
on the mystery until that day dawned towards which all our days had
headed, for which no man had ever waited in vain. And then, pinched
of nostril and marble-cold, earth's last little posy in our
gripless hands, we should lie supine and&mdash;such was the irony
of things&mdash;no longer greatly care to know.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-1" id="ch-2-1-1"></a>Chapter I</h3>

<p>The ancient little town of Buddlecombe, originally pressed down
the mouth of a narrow valley to the sea, from which it is protected
by rampart and breakwater, has, in the course of the centuries,
scaled the nearer of the two hills that confine it. Nowadays its
streets go everywhere up and down. A precipitous lane is climbed by
the ridge-like steps of an Italian donkey-path; the old town
gardens, massively walled, are built in tiers, so that the
apple-trees on the higher levels scatter their blossoms on the
gardens beneath. Coming from the upland, three driving-roads drop
into the town at a bold gradient; and vehicles, whether they mount
or descend, creep like snails. Halfway down the sheerest of the
three, the quaint little old houses, that set in oddly enough just
where the road is steepest, appear to cling shoulder to shoulder,
each a storey or a half-storey lower than the last, their lines all
out of drawing with age and the insecurity of their foothold; while
those at the bottom of the hill, seen from this point but as a
dimpling cluster of gables, dormers, chimneys, look, till you are
virtually upon them, as if they were standing in the sea. The roofs
of one and all are silvered with the mortar of innumerable repairs,
some of their ancient tiles flying off afresh in every rowdy
equinox.</p>

<p>The sea-front is crescent-shaped; and a high, wooded cliff,
which leaves room for no more than a footpath between it and the
surf-rolled shingle, cuts the town in two. The smaller half,
grouped about the harbour, includes the old custom-house, a couple
of ramshackle magazines and their yards, an ancient inn or two, all
bustling places once on a time, when elephants' teeth and gold dust
were unshipped here, and the stuffs and linens of England arrived
on pack-horses for transit to France; when, too, much lucrative
wine and spirit-running went on with the French coast. Now, there
is little doing, either here or in the tiny antiquated storehouses
and weighing-sheds out on the famous old stone quay that crooks
round the harbour. In these sheds children play or visitors shelter
while peeping forth at the great waves which, in stormy weather,
toss up over the breakwater; and the storehouses are closed and
deserted. A claim to notice, though, they still have. More than one
of them is tinted a delicate pink; and the rays of the setting
summer sun, catching this, reflect it like a rose in the harbour;
which sometimes, half full, lies a pool of melted turquoise;
sometimes, during the spring-tides, when the moored boats ride
level with the quay, has no more colour in it than an empty glass,
or a pure sky before dawn.</p>

<p>To get the best view of the town you must row out beyond harbour
and mole, or, better still, swim out, on one of those dead-calm
days that every summer brings&mdash;days when the yellow cliffs
across the bay send down perfect golden shadows in the blue mirror
of the sea. Then, lying pillowed on this saltest, most buoyant
water, glance back to where, grouped in that perfect symmetry that
seems the lost secret of old town-builders, the little place on its
gun-cliffs lies curved to the bay. Viewed thus, it looks like a
handful of grey shells clustered on a silver shingle&mdash;pearl,
not stone grey&mdash;for there is no dourness about Buddlecombe:
light and graceful of aspect, it might have suffered bodily
transport at the hands of some giant Ifrit, from the French coast
over the way. Its silveriness is dashed only by the creeper on the
square church-tower&mdash;perched, this, too, on the very cliff
edge&mdash;a creeper which betimes in summer the salt air dyes a
blood-red; and by an old jet-black house, tarred and pitched
against the breakers which, in a south-west gale, beat to its
topmost windows, and hurl roots and branches of seaweed up the
slope of the main street.</p>

<p>Above the town the green hillsides are dotted with goodly
residences, in which officers on half-pay, and Anglo-Indians in
search of clemency, lie snug for the rest of their dormouse days.
The houses are as secluded as a foliage of almost tropical
luxuriance or walls well over man's height, with great hedges atop
of these, can make them; and the loveliness of their jealously
hidden gardens is only to be guessed at from peeps through a door
left ajar by a careless errand-boy; from the bold application of an
eye to a keyhole; or, in midsummer, from the purple masses of
buddleia and the wealth of climbing-roses&mdash;pink and crimson,
yellow and white&mdash;that toss over the walls in a confusion of
beauty.</p>

<p>In this pleasant spot Richard Mahony had made his home. Here,
too, he had found the house of his dreams. It was built of
stone&mdash;under a tangle of creeper&mdash;was very old, very
solid: floors did not shake to your tread, and, shut within the
four walls of a room, voices lost their carrying power. But its
privacy was what he valued most. To the steep road on which it
abutted the house turned a blank face&mdash;or blank but for
entrance-door and one small window&mdash;while, in a line with it,
up-hill and down, to conceal respectively flower and
kitchen-gardens, ran two arms of massy wall. In addition to this,
the front door was screened by a kind of sentry-box porch, open
only on one side. In this porch was set a tiny glass oval; and here
one could stand, secure from rough weather or the curiosity of an
occasional passer-by, and watch for mounting postman or expected
guest; just as no doubt fifty odd years before, through this very
peep-hole, anxious eyes had strained for news-carrier or outrider
bringing tidings of sailor son or soldier husband, absent on
foreign service in the Great War.</p>

<p>On stepping over the threshold you found yourself at once on the
upper floor; for so abruptly did the ground on the farther side
fall away that the house was one storey to the road, two to the
garden. The living-rooms were on the higher level, with a fine view
over town and bay&mdash;all but one, a snug little oak-panelled
parlour on the ground floor; and here it was that, one autumn
morning between eight and nine o'clock, the Mahonys sat at
breakfast. Although the air of the young day was mild in the
extreme, a generous fire burned in the grate and roared up the
chimney, entirely putting to shame, with its scarlet vigour, the
wraith-like patch of sunshine that lay across the table.</p>

<p>Mary, seated behind the urn, looked very thoughtful; and this
was the more marked because, in obedience to the prevailing
fashion, she had swept the heavy bands of her hair off cheeks and
forehead, and now wore it braided high in a crown. The change threw
up the fine, frank lines of her head and brow; and atoned for the
youthful softness it robbed her of, by adding to the dignity and
character of her face.</p>

<p>More than once during the meal she had made as if to speak. But
as certainly as she opened her lips, Richard, who was deep in The
<i>Times</i> of the day before, would either absently hold out his
cup to her; or attack the muffin-dish anew; or, in turning a richly
crackling sheet of the paper, exclaim: "Ha! Here we have it! Mr.
Disraeli threatens to resign. The poor Queen will be forced to send
for that turncoat Gladstone." And Mary did not wish to spoil his
appetite or interrupt his reading.</p>

<p>But when he had pushed cup and saucer from him, wiped his
moustache, and driven back his chair, fleetly to skim the less
important columns, she felt justified in claiming his
attention.</p>

<p>"Richard, dear&mdash;I want to tell you something. What we
suspected is true. The Burroughs <i>have</i> called in Mr.
Robinson. Selina says his gig stood outside their house yesterday
for quite a time."</p>

<p>She paused, waiting for a rejoinder that did not come.</p>

<p>"And that's not the most annoying thing, either. He has been
sent for to 'Toplands' as well."</p>

<p>After this she was no longer in doubt whether he heard her. For
though he went on reading, his face changed in a way she well knew.
To herself she called it "going wrong"&mdash;"his face went wrong"
was how she put it &mdash;and in the year they had been in England,
she had watched what was formerly a casual occurrence turn to
almost a habit. Now Richard had always been a very transparent
person, showing anger, pride, amusement, all too plainly. But this
was something different. It was not so much an expression as a loss
of expression; and it happened when anyone laid a chance finger on
some sensitive spot he had believed securely hidden. Put thus out
of countenance he wore an oddly defenceless, even a hapless air;
and it distressed her to see him give himself away in front of
strangers. Hence, she had a fresh reason for trying to be
beforehand with news of a disagreeable nature. In the old days, she
had wished to hinder him feeling hurt; now it was to hinder him
showing that he was hurt&mdash;which, of the two, she believed he
minded more.</p>

<p>In the present case his sole response was a curt: "Well!...fools
will be fools," as he turned a page of the paper. A moment later,
however, he did what she expected: laid the <i>Times</i> down and
stalked out of the room.</p>

<p>She threw a motherly glance after him, and sighed. Poor old
Richard! She had been bound to tell him, of course; but by doing so
she had furnished him with a worry for the whole day. It was clear
he had set his heart on keeping "Toplands"; and now, after
consulting him on and off for a couple of months, the silly people
seemed to be going back to that red-nosed, ungentlemanly Mr.
Robinson. She couldn't understand it. Still, in Richard's place,
she would have taken it calmly. Ten to one turncoats like these
would soon come running to him again. Time was needed for people
here to find out how clever he was.</p>

<p>Having cleared the breakfast-table, she rang the bell for the
servant to take away the tray. But neither her first ring nor a
second was answered. For at this moment the girl, her skirts
bunched high above a pair of neat prunellas, stood ruefully eyeing
the condition of the lower lawn, wondering how she could make her
master hear without soiling her boots or indecently raising her
voice.</p>

<p>From the dining-room Mahony had stepped out into the garden.
This was saturated with moisture. During the night a sea fog had
crept up and enmuffled the land; and though by now a watery sun was
dissipating the mists&mdash;they lingered only about remote
objects, like torn handfuls of cotton wool&mdash;they had left
everything drenched and sodden. As he crossed the grass of the
upper lawn, the water came in over the tops of his carpet-slippers;
bushes and shrubs against which he brushed delivered showers of
drops; and gossamer-webs, spun by the thousand in lovely geometrics
that hung whitey-grey and thick as twine, either shattered
themselves on his shoulders, or laid themselves fillet-wise round
his brow. At the foot of the garden he traversed a second lawn, in
which his feet sank and stuck, and climbed three wooden steps set
against a side wall. He had hammered these steps together himself,
that he might have a view to seaward. A small cutting, in the end
wall, as well as all the windows of the house, looked to the town
and the row of yellow cliffs beyond. They dated from a time when a
land view of any kind was preferred to that of the bare and open
sea.</p>

<p>Here he now stood and stared at the palely glittering water. But
he did not see it. His mind was busy with the uncomfortable
impression left on it by Mary's last statement. At a stroke this
had laid waste the good spirits in which he had got up that
morning; even if, for the moment, it had done no more than pull him
up short, as one is pulled up by a knot in a needleful of
pack-thread, or a dumb note on a keyboard. For the feeling roused
in him was no such simple one as mere mortification at the rumoured
loss of the big house known as "Toplands"; though the dear soul
indoors put it down to this, and he should continue to let her
think so. No; there was more behind. But only now, when alone with
himself, did he mutter under his breath: "Good Lord! What if this
place should prove to be Leicester over again!"</p>

<p>He got no further; for here was it that Selina's prim voice
broke on his ear. The girl had followed in his steps to say that
Jopson, the liveryman, was at the back door and wished to speak to
him. A patient also waited in the passage.</p>

<p>Jopson, who was a short man of enormous bulk, had been
accommodated with a chair, after his drag uphill. He rose at
Mahony's approach, but continued to ease his weight against the
doorpost.</p>

<p>"Sarry, surr, but I ca'an't let 'ee 'ave the mare to-day. 'Er's
arff 'er feed. Sarry, surr. T'others is every one bespoke. No,
surr, mine's t' only livery in the town. One o' the inns
<i>might</i> let 'ee 'ave a turn-out, of a sart; but I dunno as I'd
advise 'ee to go to they. They's almighty partiklar, surr, 'ow
their 'arses is drove. 'Twouldn't do to bring one o' they whoam
along, winded and h'all of a sweat."</p>

<p>"You surely don't mean to insinuate I've been overdriving the
mare?"</p>

<p>"Well, surr, and since you mention it yourself, Allfred did say
yesterday as 'ow you took 'er h'up ovurr Brandlebury 'Ill faster
than 'er 'dd anny mind to go. The 'ills is steep 'ereabouts, surr,
and cruel 'aard on the 'arses. An' 'tis naat the furst time
neether. If you'll excuse me sayin' so, surr, them 'oove seen it do
tell as 'ow you be rather a flash 'and with the reins."</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word, Jopson, this is something new! I drive for
show?...I overwork a horse? Why, my man, where I come from, it used
to be dinned into me on all sides that I was far too easy with
them."</p>

<p>"Ca'an't say, surr, I'm sure." Jopson was perfectly civil, but
equally non-committal.</p>

<p>"But I can!" gave back Mahony, with warmth. "I had two of my own
there, let me tell you, and no beasts were ever better treated or
cared for. They certainly hadn't to be walked up every slope for
fear they'd lose their wind. They took their honest share of the
day's work. For where I come from..." At the repetition of the
phrase he bit his lip.</p>

<p>"Aye, surr, ahl very well, I dessay, for such a
place&mdash;Australy, as I unnerstand," answered Jopson unmoved.
"But 'twouldn't do 'ere, surr&mdash;in England. Thic's a civilised
country." And so on to a somewhat acid wrangle, in which Mahony,
galled by the doubt cast on his compassion for dumb brutes, was
only restrained by the knowledge that, in this matter of
conveyance, he was wholly in Jopson's power.</p>

<p>"Really, my dear, if it weren't that the fellow kept his hat in
his hand and scattered his 'sirs' broadcast, it might just have
been old Billy de la Poer himself I was talking to. <i>Do</i> you
remember Billy? And how, in his palmy days, one had to wheedle a
mount out of him, if he wasn't in the vein to hire? The very same
uppish independence! I don't know, I'm sure, what this country's
coming to. Though I will say, with all his shortcomings Billy never
had the impudence to tell me I couldn't drive."</p>

<p>The woman who was waiting for him brought a summons to one of
the lonely little farms that dotted the inland hills.</p>

<p>"Three miles out and only shanks' ponies to get me there just my
luck! Imagine, Mary, a place with but a single horse for hire!
To-night I must go thoroughly into the money question again. I
shan't be satisfied now, my dear, till I am independent of Jopson
and his great fat pampered quadruped. Stable with him? Not I! Not
if I have to build on here myself!"</p>

<p>His first visit led him down the main street of Buddlecombe.</p>

<p>It was between nine and ten o'clock, the hour of day at which
the little town was liveliest. Shopkeepers had opened their
shutters, saw-dusted and sprinkled their floors, picked over their
goods, unlocked their tills and tied on clean white aprons. They
might now be seen sunning themselves in their doorways, exchanging
the time of day with their neighbours, or shooing off the dogs
which, loosed from chain and kennel, frolicked, yapped and sprawled
over the pavement. Mounted butcher-boys trotted smartly to and fro.
A fisherman, urging a sluggish horse and laden cart uphill, cried
mackerel at two a penny. And, from big houses and little, women
were emerging, on foot or in donkey and pony-chaises, to do their
marketing, chat with one another, glean the news that had
accumulated overnight. For every one knew everybody else in
Buddlecombe, and was almost more interested in his neighbour's
business than in his own. You could not, vowed Mahony, enter a shop
for a penn'orth of tin-tacks&mdash;the selling of which was
conducted as if you had all eternity to spare for it; what with the
hunting up of a small enough bit of paper, the economical
unravelling of a tangled length of twine&mdash;without learning
that Mr. Jones's brindled cow had calved at last, or that the
carrier had delivered to Mr. Du Cane still another hogshead of
brandy-wine. This, together with many a sly inquiry as to where you
yourself might be bound for, or the trend of your own affairs.
Alongside the rampart stood half a dozen ancient men of the sea,
discussing, with vigour, God knew what. A bottle-nosed constable,
stationed in the middle of the road to superintend a traffic that
did not exist, gossiped with the best.</p>

<p>Down this street Mahony walked, in the surtout, light trousers
and bell-topper which he still preferred to the careless attire of
a country doctor. He was greeted with bows and bobs and touched
forelocks. But the fact of his appearing on foot brought him many a
quizzing glance; and there were also shoppers who came at a trot to
the door to see and stare after him. Or perhaps, he thought with a
grimace, the more than common interest he roused this morning was
due to his ill-treatment of Jopson's mare, the tale of which had no
doubt already been buzzed abroad. He was really only now, after
several months' residence in Buddlecombe, beginning to understand
the seven days' wonder with which he must have provided the
inhabitants by settling in their midst&mdash;he, who bore with him
the exotic aroma of the Antipodes! At the time, being without
experience of little English country places, he had failed to
appreciate it.</p>

<p>His visits in the town paid, he chose to leave it by the
sea-front and climb the steeper hill at the farther end, rather
than retrace his steps and present himself anew to all these
curious and faintly hostile eyes.</p>

<p>Thus began for him a day of fatigue and discomfort. The promise
of the early morning was not fulfilled: the sun failed; down came
the mist again; and the tops of the hills and the high roads that
ran along them were lost in a bank of cloud. He was for ever
opening and shutting his umbrella, as he passed from rain to fog
and fog to rain. Not a breath of air stirred. His greatcoat hung a
ton-weight on his shoulders.</p>

<p>He walked moodily. As a rule on his country rounds, he had the
distraction of the reins: his eye, too, could range delightedly
over the shifting views of lovely pastoral country, fringed by the
belt of blue sea. To-day, even had the weather allowed of it, he
could have seen nothing, on foot between giant hedgerows that
walled in the narrow lanes leading from one cottage and one village
to the next. Plodding along he first tried, without success, to
visualise the pages of his passbook; then fell back on the deeper,
subtler worry that was in him. This, sitting perched hobgoblinlike
on his neck, pricked and nudged his memory, and would not let him
rest. So that, on coming out of a house and starting his tramp
anew, he would murmur to himself: "Where was I?...what was it? Oh,
yes, I know: just suppose this should turn out to be Leicester over
again!"</p>

<p>For the present was not his first bid for a practice in England.
That had been made under very different circumstances.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-2" id="ch-2-1-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>It was at another breakfast-table, something over a year
previously, that Mary, having opened and read it, handed him a
letter bearing the Leicester postmark.&mdash;"From my mother."</p>

<p>This ran:</p>

<p>NOW MY DARLINGS I DON'T WANT TO HURRY YOU AWAY FROM ALL THE
GRANDEURS AND GAIETIES OF THE METROPOLIS, AND HAVE YOU GRUMBLING OH
BOTHERATION TAKE THAT OLD MOTHER OF OURS; BUT I DO LONG TO SEE YOU
BOTH, MY CHILDREN, AND TO GET MY ARMS ROUND YOU. YOUR ROOM IS
READY, THE BED MADE AND AIRED&mdash;LISBY HAS ONLY TO RUN THE
BED-WARMER OVER THE SHEETS FOR THE LAST TIME. MY HOME IS SMALL AS
YOU KNOW, POLLY, BUT YOU SHALL HAVE A ROYAL WELCOME, MY DEARS, AND
I HOPE WILL MAKE IT YOURS TILL YOU HAVE ONE OF YOUR OWN AGAIN.</p>

<p>"A royal welcome indeed, Mary!...one may say our first genuine
welcome to England," declared Mahony; and threw, in thought, a
caustic side-glance at the letters he had received from his own
people since landing: Irish letters, charming in phrase and
sentiment, but&mdash;to his own Irish eyes&mdash;only partially
cloaking the writers' anxiety lest, as a result of his long absence
from the country, he should take Irish words at their face value,
take what was but the warm idea of an invitation for the thing
itself, and descend to quarter himself upon them. "Now what do you
say, love? Shall we pack our traps and be off? Yes, yes, I suppose
I shall have to gulp down another cup of these dregs...that
masquerade as coffee."</p>

<p>"Ssh, Richard!...not so loud." Mary spoke huskily, being in the
grip of a heavy cold and muffled to the chin. "I should like it, of
course. But remember, in engaging these rooms you mentioned a
month&mdash;if not six weeks."</p>

<p>"I did, I know. But...Well, my dear, to speak frankly the sooner
I walk out of them for the last time the better I'll be pleased.
How the deuce that hotel we stopped at had the effrontery to
recommend them staggers me!" And with aversion Mahony let his eye
skim the inseparable accompaniments of a second class London
lodging: the stained and frayed table linen, cracked, odd china,
dingy hangings; the cheap, dusty coal, blind panes, smut-strewn
sills. "Fitzroy Square indeed! By hanging out of the window till I
all but over-reach myself, to catch a glimpse of a single sooty
tree branch. And the price we're asked to pay for the privilege! I
assure you, Mary, though we had fork out rent for the full six
weeks, we should save in the end by going. The three we've been
here have made a sad hole in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Yes. But of course we've done some rather extravagant things,
dear. Cabs everywhere&mdash;because of your silly prejudice against
me using the omnibus. Then that concert...the Nightingale, I forget
her name...and the Italian Opera, and Adelina Patti. I said at the
time you should have left me at home; you could have told me all
about it afterwards. What with gloves and bouquet and head-dress,
it must have cost close on five pounds."</p>

<p>"And pray are we to be here at last, in the very heart of
things, with twenty years' rust&mdash;oh, well! very nearly
twenty&mdash;to rub off, and yet go nowhere and hear nothing? No,
wife, that's not the money I begrudge. All the same, just let me
tell you what our stay in London has run to&mdash;I totted it up at
three A.M. when those accursed milk-wagons began to rattle
by"&mdash;and here he did aloud for Mary's benefit a rapid sum in
mental arithmetic. "What do you say to that?&mdash;No, I know I
haven't," he answered another objection on her part. "But on second
thoughts, I've decided to postpone seeing over hospitals and
medical schools till I'm settled in practice again, and have a
fixed address on my pasteboards. I shall then get a good deal more
deference shown me than I should at present, a mere nobody, sprung
from the dickens knows where."</p>

<p>He had lighted the after-breakfast pipe he could now allow
himself, and pacing the room with his hands in his dressing-gown
pockets went on: "This sense of insignificance regularly haunts me.
I'm paying, I expect, for having lived so long in a place like
Ballarat, where it was easy to imagine oneself a personage of
importance. Here, all such vanity is soon crushed out of one. The
truth of the matter is, London's too big for me; I don't feel equal
to it&mdash;I believe one can lose the habit of great cities, just
like any other. And sometimes, especially since you've been laid
up, Mary&mdash;for which I hold myself mainly responsible, my dear,
running you off your legs as I did at first..."</p>

<p>"Still we can say, Richard, can't we, we've seen all there is to
be seen?" threw in Mary with a kind of cheerful inattention. Risen
meanwhile from the breakfast-table, she had opened the door of the
chiffonier; and her thoughts were now divided between Richard's
words and the fresh depredations in her store of provisions that
had taken place overnight.</p>

<p>Mahony snorted. "A fiftieth part of it would be nearer the
mark!&mdash;Well, as I was saying...if you'll do me the kindness to
listen...this last week or so, since I've been mooning about by
myself&mdash;Gad! to think how I once looked forward to treading
these dingy old streets again&mdash;half silly with the noise of
the traffic...upon my word, wife, that begins to get on my nerves,
too: it goes on like a wave that never breaks; I find myself
eternally waiting for a crash that doesn't come. Well, as I say,
when I push my way through all these hard, pale, dirty London
faces&mdash;yes, my dear, even the best of 'em look as though they
needed a thorough scrub with soap and water...as for me, if I wash
my hands once, I wash 'em twenty times a day; I defy any one to
keep clean in such an atmosphere. All strange faces, too; never one
you recognise in the whole bunch; while out there, of course, the
problem was, to meet a person you did <i>not</i> know. Well, there
come times, if you'll believe me, when I've caught myself feeling
I'd hail with pleasure even a sight of old
What-was-his-name?&mdash;you know, Mary, that vulgar old jackanapes
on board who was for ever buttonholing me...my particular <i>bete
noire</i>&mdash;yes, or even sundry other specimens of the
<i>omnium gatherum</i> we were blessed with."</p>

<p>"Well, I never! And me who thought you were only too glad to ged
rid of them."</p>

<p>"Faith and wasn't I?...at the time. Indeed, yes." And Mahony
smiled; for at Mary's words a picture rose before him of his
fellow-passengers as he had last seen them, standing huddled
together like frightened sheep on the platform of the great railway
terminus: an outlandish, countrified, colonial-looking set if ever
there was one, with their over-bushy hair and whiskers, their
overloud shepherds'-plaids and massy watch-chains, the ladies'
bonnets (yes, Mary's too!) seeming somehow all wrong. Even the most
cocksure of the party had been stunned into a momentary silence by
the murk of fog and steam that filled the space under the lofty
roofing; by the racket of whistling, snorting, blowing engines; the
hoarse shouts of cabbies and porters. But the first shock over,
spirits had risen in such crescendo that with a hasty: "Come, love,
let <i>us</i> get out of this!" he had torn Mary from voluminous
embraces, bundled her into a four-wheeler and bidden the driver
whip up. A parting glance through the peep-hole showed the group
still gesticulating, still vociferating, while crowns and
half-crowns rained on grinning porters, who bandied jokes about the
givers with expectant Jehus and a growing ring of onlookers. Their
very luggage, rough, makeshift, colonial, formed a butt for
ridicule.</p>

<p>Lost in such recollections&mdash;they included the whole dirty,
cold, cheerless reality of arrival; included the first breath drawn
of an air that smells and tastes like no other in the world; the
drive in a musty old growler reeking of damp straw, and pulled by
something "God might once have meant for a horse!" to an hotel, the
address of which he had kept to himself: "Or we should have the
whole lot of 'em trapesing after us!"&mdash;sunk in these memories,
Mahony let a further remark of Mary's pass unheeded. But when, with
a raucous cry, a butcher's boy stumped down the area steps, bearing
in his wooden tray the very meat, red and raw, that was to be
dished up on their table later on, he swung abruptly round, turning
his back on a sight he could not learn to tolerate. "Was there
<i>ever</i> such a place for keeping the material needs of the body
before one?...meat, milk, bread!...they're at it all day long. My
dear, I think I've heard you say your mother's house is not cursed
with a basement? Come, love, let us accept her invitation and go
down into the country. The English country, Mary! Change of air
will soon put you right again, and I could do, I assure you, with a
few nights' uninterrupted sleep. Besides, once I'm out of London,
it will be easier to see how the land lies with regard to that
country practice I've set my heart on."</p>

<p>This last reason would, he knew, appeal to Mary, whose chief
wish was to see him back at work. And sure enough she nodded and
said, very well then, they would just arrange to go.</p>

<p>For her part Mary saw that Richard's mind was as good as made
up: to oppose him would only be to vex him. Of course, it went
against the grain in her to be so fickle: to take lodgings for six
weeks and abandon them at the end of three! (Vainly had she tried,
at the time, to persuade Richard to a weekly arrangement. Richard
had <i>bought</i> the smile on their landlady's grim face; and she
felt certain did not regret it.) But though she hadn't shown it,
she had been shocked to hear the sum total of their expenses since
landing. Nor was there anything to keep them in London. They had
fitted themselves out from top to toe, in order to lose what
Richard persisted in calling "the diggers' brand"; and, say what he
might to the contrary, they had seen and heard enough of London to
last them for the rest of their lives. Museums, picture galleries,
famous buildings: all had been scampered through and they
themselves worn out, before the first week was over: her
ship-softened feet still burned at the remembrance. Yes, for
herself, she would be well pleased to get away. Privately she
thought London not a patch on Ballarat; thought it cold,
comfortless, dreary; a bewildering labyrinth of dirty streets. And
the longer she stayed there the more she regretted the bright,
clean, sunny land of her adoption.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that before the third week was over, they
were in the train bound for Leicester.</p>

<p>It was a wet day. Rain set in at dawn, and continued to fall
hour after hour, in one of those steady, sullen, soulless downpours
that mark the English autumn. Little could be seen by the two
travellers who sat huddled chillily in wraps and rugs, the soles of
their feet burning or freezing on tin foot-warmers&mdash;seen
either of the cast-iron sky, over which drifted lower, looser
bulges of cloud, or of the bare, flattish country through which the
train ran. On the one side the glass of the narrow window was
criss-crossed with rain stripes; on the other, the flying puffs of
steam, unwinding from the engine like fleecy cardings, wearisomely
interposed between their eyes and the landscape. Now and then
Mahony, peering disconsolately, caught a glimpse of a low-lying
meadow which, did a brook meander through it, was already half
under water. Here and there on a rise he distinguished a melancholy
spinney or copse: in its rainy darkness, trailed round by wreaths
of mist, it looked as fantastic as a drawing by Dore. On every
station at which they halted stood rows of squat, ruddy-faced
figures, dripping water from garments and umbrellas, the rich mud
of the countryside plastered over boots and leggings. They made
Mahony think of cattle, did these sturdy, phlegmatic
country-people&mdash;the soaked and stolid cattle that might be
seen in white-painted pens beside the railway, or herded in trucks
along the line. And both men and beasts alike seemed insensitive to
the surrounding gloom.</p>

<p>On the platform at Leicester, reached towards five o'clock, so
many muddied feet had passed and repassed that, even under cover,
not a clean or a dry spot was left. And still the rain fell,
hissing and spitting off the edges of the roof, lying as
chocolate-coloured puddles between the rails. In the station-yard
the wet cabs and omnibuses glistened in the dusk; and every hollow
of their leather aprons held its pool of water. The drivers,
climbing down from their boxes, shook themselves like dogs; the
patient horses drooped their heads and stood weak-kneed, their
coats dark and shiny with moisture.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!...what weather!" grumbled Mahony, and having got
Mary into the little private omnibus that was to bear them to their
destination, he watched a dripping, beery-faced coachman drag and
bump their trunks on to the roof of the vehicle, and stack the
inside full with carpet-bags and hand-portmanteaux. "Yet I suppose
this is what we have got to expect for the rest of our
days.&mdash;Keep your mouth well covered, my dear."</p>

<p>Behind her mufflings Mary vented the opinion that they would
have done better to time their landing in England for earlier in
the year.</p>

<p>"Yes; one forgets out there what an unspeakable climate this is.
The dickens! Look at the mould on the floor! I declare to you the
very cushions are damp." Having squeezed into the narrow space left
vacant for him, Mahony vehemently shut the door against the
intruding rain. And the top-heavy vehicle set to trundling over the
slippery cobbles.</p>

<p>But the discomfort of the journey was forgotten on arrival.</p>

<p>The omnibus drew up in a side street before a little red-brick
house&mdash;one of a terrace of six&mdash;standing the length of a
broom-handle back from the road. A diminutive leaden portico
overhung the door. Descending a step and going through a narrow
passage, they entered what Mahony thought would be but a dingy
sitting-room. But although small, and as yet unlit by candles, this
room seemed all alive with brightness. A clear fire burned in a
well-grate; a copper kettle on the hob shone like a great orange;
the mahogany of the furniture, polished to looking-glass splendour,
caught and gave back the flames, as did also, on the table spread
for tea, a copper urn and the old dented, fish-back silver. On the
walls twinkled the glass of the family portraits; even the
horsehair had high lights on it. A couple of armchairs faced the
blaze. And to this atmosphere of cosy comfort came in, chill and
numb, two sun-spoiled colonials, who were as much out of place in
the desolate, rain-swept night as would have been two lizards, but
lately basking on a sun-baked wall.</p>

<p>"Come, this is really <i>very</i> jolly, Mary!"</p>

<p>Thus Mahony, toasting his coat-tails before the fire, while
their hosts were absent on the last ceremonies connected with tea.
And went on, warmed through now, both in mind and body: "I fear
you've had a shocking old grizzler at your side of late, love. But
I've felt like a fish out of water. Idleness doesn't agree with me,
Mary. I must get back to work, my dear. I want a house of my own
again too. When I see a snug little place like this, after those
unspeakable lodgings, why, upon my word it makes me feel inclined
to jump at the first vacancy that offers."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would never do," said Mary with a smile. And their
hands, which had met, fell apart at the sound of footsteps.</p>

<p>It was also a cheerful evening; one that opened with jest and
laughter. For barely were they seated at the tea-table when sister
Lisby, who towered head and shoulders above her stout little dot of
a mother&mdash;Lisby shamelessly betrayed a secret, telling how,
while the travellers were upstairs removing their wraps, mother had
seized her and danced her round, exclaiming as she did: "Oh, my
dear, aren't we grand?...aren't we grand? Which I may mention was
not intended for you, Polly&mdash;I would say Mary. For I feel
sure, if you could see inside my mother's heart, you would find
yourself there no more than fourteen&mdash;the age you were when
last she saw you."</p>

<p>They all laughed; and Mother covered her old confusion by
picking up the sugar-tongs and dropping an extra lump into Mahony's
cup.</p>

<p>"Now give over, miss, will you?" she said affectionately. "Any
one but such a pert young thing as you would make allowance for an
old woman's pleasure at getting a son again. Ready-made,
too&mdash;without any bother. Eight of 'em, Richard my dear, have I
brought into this world in my day &mdash;a baker's dozen all told,
boys and girls together&mdash;and not one is left to their poor old
mother but this forward young party here. And she'd be off if she
could."</p>

<p>"My mother," said Lisby&mdash;having filled and handed round the
cups, she was now engaged in apportioning a pork pie, performing
the task with a nicety that made Mahony think of Shylock and his
bond: not a crumb was spilt or wasted&mdash;"My mother would have
me sit all day at the parlour window, on the watch for some Prince
Charming. To him she would gladly resign me. But because I wish to
go out into the world and stand on my own feet..."</p>

<p>"Lisby! Not woman's rights, I hope?" interposed Mary. And
reassured: "Then, mother, I should let her try it. Especially now
you've got me to look after you. Lisby, my dear, if you had been in
the colony with us in the early days&mdash;" and here Mary dilated
on some of the hard and incongruous jobs she had seen women put
their hands to.</p>

<p>"Now, did you ever?" ejaculated Lisby&mdash;with force, but a
divided mind. At present she was carving a cold chicken with the
same precision as the pie. (Mahony laughed afterwards when, sunk
deep in the feathers, he lay watching the gigantic shadows flung by
a single candle on the white ceiling, and Mary braided her hair;
laughed and said, Lisby's carving made him think of a first-year
medical performing on a frog.) "<i>Never</i> did I hear tell of
such things! I declare, my dear, I am reminded of Miss Delauncey of
Dupew. You will remember her, Polly&mdash;I would say Mary." ("I
think I do just remember the name," from Mary.) "Well, my dear,
what must she do but leave home&mdash;against her father's
will&mdash;to go and be a governess in Birmingham." And now Lisby
in her turn held forth on the surprising adventures of Miss
Delauncey, who, finding herself in a post that did not suit her,
was obliged to take another.</p>

<p>This kind of thing happened more than once during the meal: the
ball of talk, glancing aside from the guests' remoter experiences,
was continually coming back to Lisby and the world she knew. Her
old mother, it seemed to Mahony, was shyer, more retiring. But
though she did not say much, it was she who peeped into cups to see
if the bottoms were showing; who put titbits on Mary's plate when
Mary was not looking; pressed Mahony to a dish of cheesecakes with
a smile that would have won any heart. He returned the smile,
accepted the cakes, but otherwise, finding no point of contact, sat
silent. Mary, with an eye to him through all Lisby's chat, feared
her relatives would think him stiff and dull.</p>

<p>But tea over, chairs drawn to the fire, feet planted on the
fender, Mother turned her pretty old pink-and-white face framed in
lisse cap and bands to Mahony, and seeing him still sit meditative,
laid her plump little hand over his long thin one, which rested on
the arm of his chair. And as he did not resist, she made it a
prisoner, and carried it to her shiny old black silk lap. Sitting
in this way, hand in hand with him, she began to put gentle
questions about the lives and fates of those dearest to her: John,
John's two families of children, and his wives, neither of whom,
not the lovely Emma, nor yet soft, brown-eyed Jinny&mdash;to whom,
through her letters, she had grown deeply attached&mdash;could she
now ever hope to know on earth. Next Zara, whom she called Sarah:
"For the name I chose for her at her baptism I still think good
enough for her," with a stingless laugh at her eldest daughter's
elegancies. Steady Jerry, who would never set the Thames on fire.
Ned, poor dear unfortunate Ned, who had been a source of anxiety to
her since his birth&mdash;"Ah, but I was troubled when I carried
him, Richard!"&mdash;from whom she had not heard directly for many
a long day. Inquiring thus after her brood, and commenting on what
she heard with a rare good sense, she gradually lured Mahony into a
talking-fit that subdued even Lisby, and kept them all out of their
beds till two o'clock in the morning. Once started, Richard proved
regularly in the vein; and Mary no longer needed to fear lest he be
thought dull or stand-off. Indeed, she found herself listening with
interest. For he told things&mdash;gave reasons for throwing up his
Ballarat practice, described sensations on the homeward voyage and
in London&mdash;which were new even to her. At some of them she
rather opened her eyes. She didn't want to insinuate that Richard
was inventing them on the spur of the moment; but she did
think&mdash;and on similar occasions had thought before
now&mdash;that certain ideas occurred to him only when he got
fairly wound up: he was like a fisher who didn't always know what
he was going to catch.&mdash;Besides, there was this odd
contradiction in Richard: he who was usually so reserved could, she
had noticed, sometimes speak out more frankly, unbosom himself more
easily, to people he was meeting for the first time, than to those
he lived his life with. It was as if he said to himself, once
didn't count.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-3" id="ch-2-1-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>The next-door house, the first in the row, stood at right angles
to the rest, and faced two diverging streets of shops and stores.
Further, the little leaden rain-shield over the front door was
supported by a pair of pillars coloured to resemble marble, between
which hung a red lamp. This lamp had burned there, night for night,
for over half a Century: the stone of the doorstep was worn to a
hollow by the countless feet that had rubbed and scraped and
shuffled, under its ruby glow. For the house belonged to old Mr.
Brocklebank the surgeon, who was one of the original landmarks of
the neighbourhood. He had, in fact, lived there so long that none
was old enough to remember his coming&mdash;with the possible
exception, said Mother, of old Joe Dorgan, for sixty years past,
ostler at the "Saddlers' Arms." Joe was now in his dotage, and his
word did not count for much; but in earlier life he had been heard
to tell of the slim and elegant figure young Brocklebank had once
cut, in redingote, choker and flowered gilet; and of how people had
thought twice before summoning him, owing to his extreme youth.
This defect time had remedied; and so effectually that it soon
passed belief to connect youth and slimness with the heavy and
corpulent old man. When, for instance, mother came there as a
bride, he had seemed to her already elderly; the kind of doctor a
young wife could with propriety consult.</p>

<p>The practice had flourished till it was second to none; and he
was reported, being a bachelor and very thrifty, not to say
close-fisted, to have laid by the thousands which in this town were
commonly associated only with leather or hose. But now he had all
but reached the eighties; and despite one of those marvellous
country-bred English constitutions&mdash;founded on ruddy steaks,
and ale, and golden cheddars&mdash;the infirmities of age began to
vex him. For some time past his patients had hesitated to call him
out by night, or in bad weather, or for what he might consider too
trifling a cause; though they remained his faithful adherents,
preferring any day a bottle of Mr. B.'s good physic to treatment by
a more modish doctor. Recently, however, he had let two
comparatively simple cases slip through his fingers; while the
habit was growing on him of suddenly nodding off at a bedside; what
time the patient had to lie still until the old gentleman came to
himself again. A blend, too, of increasing deafness and obstinacy
led him to shout people down. So that altogether something like a
sigh of relief went up when one fine day a great-nephew appeared,
and the rumour ran that Mr. B. was retiring: was being carried off
to end his honourable and useful career under another's tutelage;
to be wheeled to the grave-brink in the humiliating bath-chair to
which he had condemned many a sufferer. And house and practice were
for sale.</p>

<p>Lisby came primed with the news&mdash;brought by the milkman on
his early round&mdash;to the breakfast-table. And Mother, her first
shock over and her eyes dried, fell into a reminiscent mood.</p>

<p>"Dear oh deary me! Old Mr. B. laid on the shelf! Why, it seems
only like the other day I saw him for the first time...when Johnny
was born. Yet it must be nigh on five-and-forty years; Johnny will
be forty-five come March. In walks Mr. B.&mdash;I'd never needed a
doctor till then&mdash;and says to me&mdash;me, poor young ignorant
thing thankful to have escaped with my life&mdash;in he comes:
'Here's a fine fish we've landed to-day, madam! Here's a new
recruit for the Grenadier Guards! Twelve pounds if an ounce, and a
leg like a three-year-old!' I up on my elbow to see, and he quite
gruffly: 'Lie down you villainous young mother, you! Do you want to
make an orphan of the brat?' He had always to have his joke had Mr.
B. and we were good friends from that day. One after another he
brought the whole batch of you into the world.&mdash;Deary me, I
shall miss him. Many and many's the time he's stepped over the
railing with his weekly news-sheet: 'Here's a murder case to make
you ladies' blood run cold,' he would say. Or: 'Another great
nugget found on the goldfields!'&mdash;for he knew the ties I had
with the colony. And the last sound I used to hear at night was him
knocking out his pipe on the chimney-piece. It was such a comfort
to me&mdash;after your father went and the boys scattered&mdash;to
know we'd a man so close. Especially in '59, when those dreadful
burglaries took place."</p>

<p>"Now, mother, give over trying to make yourself engaging," was
Lisby's comment. "You know the truth is, no one troubled less about
the burglars than you. Before my mother went to bed she would lay
out all the silver and plate and her rings and brooches, in neat
piles on the table, so as to save the robbers trouble should they
come."</p>

<p>"So as to save my own skin, you saucy girl!&mdash;Well,
well!...what's past is past. To be sure it wouldn't have done for
him to go on doctoring till he lost his memory, and perhaps mixed
his drugs and poisoned us all."</p>

<p>"It would not indeed. And for the rest, my dear mother, I tell
you what: Mary and I will take up our abode next door and look
after you," said Mahony.</p>

<p>At the moment, the words passed as the jest they were meant for.
But they sowed their seed. Mahony ate his toast and drained his cup
with an absent air; and as soon as breakfast was over made Mary a
private sign to follow him upstairs. There, while she sat on the
edge of the bed, he fidgeted about the room, fingering objects and
laying them down again in a manner that told of a strong inner
excitement.</p>

<p>"I spoke without reflection but, upon my soul, it does look
rather like the finger of Providence. An opening to crop up in this
way at my very elbow!...one that's not to be despised either, if
report speaks true. Really, wife, I don't know what to think. It
has quite unsettled me. Here have I been expecting to have to
travel the country, visiting this place and that, answering
advertisements that lead to nothing, or myself advertising and
receiving no replies&mdash;all so much nerve and shoe
wear&mdash;and a dreary business at best. You see, my dear, what I
need first of all is English experience. I mean"&mdash;he made an
airy gesture&mdash;"I must be able to say, when I find the
perfectly suitable position I'm looking for: 'I've been practising
in such and such a place for so and so many years, and have had a
first-class connection there.'&mdash;You notice, I hope, I have no
intention&mdash;should I take the chance offered me, that is, and
pop in here&mdash;of the making it a permanency. It remains my
ambition to live in the country. But if only half what they say of
old Brocklebank's affairs is to be believed, a few years here
wouldn't hurt me. There are <i>pots</i> of money to be made in
these manufacturing towns, once a practice is set going&mdash;and
this has existed for over half a century. Besides, it might even
improve under my hands...why not, indeed? Such a Methuselah must
have been entirely out of date in medicine. I confess it isn't
exactly the spot I would have chosen, even to start in, were money
and time no object. But considering, Mary, what our expenses have
been...the lateness of the season, too! Why, it's virtually winter
already, and the worst possible time of year to travel about in."
And so on, with much more in the same strain, and a final bait of:
"Another point we mustn't lose sight of is that here, you, love,
would have the company of your mother and sister. And I think I
know what a pleasure that would be to you."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course, as far as that's concerned," said Mary,
who had not interrupted by a word.</p>

<p>"Well, and the rest?" he asked a trifle querulously. "Don't I
convince you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," she said again, but slowly. "In one way. I agree it
might be worth considering. But I wouldn't be in <i>too</i> great a
hurry, Richard. Look about you. See some other places first."</p>

<p>"Yes, and while I hum and haw and think myself too good for it,
some one else snaps it up. The profession is in very different case
here, my dear, from what it was in the colonies. It's
overcrowded...worked to death. I can't afford to be too particular.
Must just find a modest corner, slip into it and be
thankful.&mdash;And let me give you a piece of advice, Mary," he
went on more warmly, with the waxing impatience of a man who longs
to see his own hesitation overthrown. "It's no earthly use your
comparing everything that turns up on this side of the globe, with
Ballarat. A practice like that won't come my way again; or at least
not in the meantime. <i>Try</i>, love, not to let yourself be
influenced by the size of a house and the width of a street. I
assure you once more, you have no conception what these provincial
concerns are worth. If I step into old Brocklebank's shoes, you may
drive in your carriage yet, my dear!"</p>

<p>Mary had run through so many considerations in listening, that
she had really listened more to herself than to him. Of course,
much of what he said was sound. Did he settle here, it would save
time and money&mdash;and one of her standing fears about the new
venture had been that Richard would prove too hard to please. But
for him now to rush to the other extreme! Nor was she one to stand
out for showiness and style; or rather, she would not be, were
Richard a different man. But he, with his pernickitiness! And it
was all very well for him to say, don't draw comparisons; how could
one help it? To have flung up a brilliant practice, a big house and
garden, a host of congenial friends...for this a pokey house in a
small dull street, in a dull, ugly, dirty town. As for what
<i>she</i> stood to gain by it, the living door by door with mother
and sister, fond as she was of them she could see, even here,
drawbacks that were invisible to his man's eye.</p>

<p>However, since the one way to deal with Richard was to give him
his head, and only by degrees deftly trickle in doubts and
scruples, Mary smothered her own feelings for the time being.
Perhaps he was right, said she: the place might do for a start; and
she was certainly against him going travelling in winter with the
objection he had to flannel. Mr. Brocklebank's advisers might, of
course, ask a stiff price for the goodwill of the practice; still,
if he got on well for two or three years, that would soon be
covered. Thus Mary, trusting to a certain blind common sense that
<i>did</i> exist in Richard for all his flightiness, if he was
neither badgered nor opposed. ("Just the Irish way of getting at a
thing backwards!" was how he himself described it.) One point
though she insisted on; and that was, he should take an outside
opinion on the practice before entering into negotiations.</p>

<p>Entirely pacified, Mahony kissed her and together they went
downstairs. According to Mother, who had now to be drawn into
confidence, the person to consult would be Bealby the chemist; he
had dispensed for Mr. B. ever since the old man grew too
comfortable to do it for himself. So Mahony on with his hat and off
to Bealby's shop, well content to leave Mary to damp the
exasperating flutter into which the news had thrown her relatives.
Well, no, he wouldn't say that: in Mother even this was bearable.
It was true, declaring you might knock her down with a feather, she
had seated herself heavily in her chair by the fire, to think and
talk over the plan in detail. But her cheery old mind saw only the
bright side of it; while her kindly, humorous smile took the sting
from fuss and curiosity. Lisby was harder to repress. She threw up
her hands. "No! <i>Never</i> did I hear tell of such a thing,
Polly&mdash;I would say Mary! Going off to buy a practice, my dear,
for all the world as if it were a tooth-brush or a cravat!" Richard
safely out of the house, Mary felt constrained to come to his
defence.</p>

<p>"You must remember, Lisby, it doesn't seem <i>quite</i> such an
important affair to Richard as it does to you. With all his
experience. Living in the colony, too, one learnt to make up one's
mind quickly. You had to. Think of shares, for instance. They might
be all right when you went to bed, and by the morning have sunk
below par; so that you had to decide there and then whether to sell
out or risk holding on." The mild amusement with which Richard's
behaviour provided Lisby was apt to jar on Mary.</p>

<p>From the chemist Mahony got all the information he
wanted&mdash;and more. The object of his visit grasped, he was led
into a dingy little parlour behind the shop, where, amid an
overflow of jars and bottles and drawer-cases, Bealby carried on
his ex-business life. And both doors noiselessly closed to ensure
their privacy, the chemist&mdash;a rubicund, paunchy old man, with
snow-white hair and whiskers&mdash;himself grew so private that he
spoke only in a whisper, and accompanied his words with a
forefinger laid flat along his nose. This mysterious air gave the
impression that he was divulging dark secrets; though he had no
secret to tell, nor would his hearer have thanked him for any.
Plainly he was a rare old gossip, and as such made the most both of
his subject and the occasion. Mahony could neither dam nor escape
from his flow of talk. However, his account of the practice was so
favourable that the rest had just to be swallowed&mdash;even
disagreeable tittle-tattle about the old surgeon's mode of life. At
the plum kept to the last&mdash;Brocklebank, it appeared, had
actually been called in professionally to the great house of the
district, Castle Bellevue&mdash;Mahony could not repress a smile;
Bealby alluding to it with a reverence that would have befitted a
religious rite. Of more practical importance was the information
that there were already two candidates for the practice in the
field; but that to these, he, Mahony, would no doubt be preferred;
for both were young men, just about to start. And: "We want no
fledglings, no young sawbones in a position such as this, sir! Now
with an elderly man like yourself..." Wincing, Mahony contrived
soon after to let slip the fact that he was but a couple of years
over forty.</p>

<p>"His eyes almost jumped out of his head when I said it, Mary.
The fellow had evidently put me down for sixty or thereabouts," he
came back on the incident that night. "It made me feel I must be
beginning to look a very old man."</p>

<p>"Not old, Richard. Only rather delicate. And the people here are
all so rosy and sturdy that they don't understand any one being
pale and thin."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm positive he thought me a contemporary, if not just of
old B.'s, at least of his own."</p>

<p>What he did not mention to Mary was the impression he saw he
left Bealby under, that lack of success had been the reason of his
quitting Australia. Were he only more skilled at blowing his own
trumpet! Actually the old fool seemed to think he, Mahony, would be
bettering himself by settling in Leicester!</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I can promise you, you will find an old-established,
first-class practice, such as this, a very different thing from
those you have been used to. England, doctor, old England! There's
no place like it." At which Mahony, who had himself, aloud and in
secret, rung changes on this theme, regarded the speaker&mdash;his
paunch, due to insufficient exercise; his sheeplike, inexperienced
old face; his dark little living-room, and darker still,
mysterious, provincial manner&mdash;looked, and knew that he did
not, in the very least, mean the same thing any more.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>"Come, give over, Mary!" said Mother affectionately.</p>

<p>Mother sat by the fire in the twilight, her hands folded
placidly in her lap. She was neither a sewer nor a knitter. If not
nimbly trotting about the house, in aid of the rheumaticky old
servant, she liked best to sit still and do nothing; which Richard
said made her a most soothing companion. Her words were addressed
to Mary, who was rattling a sewing-machine as if her life depended
on it. They also referred to a remark passed in a pause of her
handle-twirling. This had constituted a criticism of
Richard&mdash;or as much of a criticism as Mary could rise to.
Which, here, she felt quite safe in making, so surely did she know
Richard nested in Mother's heart.</p>

<p>That afternoon&mdash;it was December, and night now soon after
three o'clock&mdash;he had&mdash;and not for the first
time&mdash;stepped over the low railing that separated the
garden-plots to say: "Come, Lisby, let us go a-gallivanting!"
Nothing loath, Lisby, also not for the first time, laid aside her
needle, tied on bonnet and tippet, and off they went arm-in-arm, to
prowl round the lighted shops of the town.</p>

<p>Mary's objection was: "But if he's wanted, mother! I shouldn't
know where to send for him."</p>

<p>"My dear, Eliza would find him for you in less than half an
hour.&mdash;Besides, Mary, it's very unlikely anyone would want him
in such a hurry as all that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. It's me that's silly. But you see, in
Ballarat he never dreamt of going out without leaving word just
where he was to be found. Indeed, he seldom went out for pleasure
at all. He was much too busy."</p>

<p>Mother did not put the question that would have leapt, under
similar conditions, to Lisby's lips: "Then, why, in the name of
fortune, did he leave it?" She only said: "You must have patience,
my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not me&mdash;it's him I'm afraid of. Patience is one
of the things Richard hasn't got."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. Then: "You have a very good husband,
Mary. Value him, my dear, at his true worth.&mdash;Nay, child, let
the lamp be. Can't you sit idle for half an hour?"</p>

<p>She stirred the fire to a blaze which lit up their faces, and
the many-folded drapery of their gowns.</p>

<p>"I know that, mother. But he doesn't get easier to manage as he
grows older. In some ways Richard is most difficult&mdash;very,
very queer."</p>

<p>"And pray, doesn't the old tree get knobby and gnarled?...Take a
hint from your mother, my dear&mdash;for though, Mary, you've been
so long away from me, I know my own flesh and blood as no one else
can. Be glad, child, not sorry, if Richard has his little faults
and failings&mdash;even if you can't understand 'em. They help to
bind him. For his roots in this world don't go deep, Mary. He
doesn't set proper store on the prizes other men hanker
after&mdash;money and position and influence, and such like." She
paused again, to add: "It's a real misfortune, my dear, you have no
children."</p>

<p>"Yes, and me so fond of them, too. But I'm not sure about
Richard. He's got used, now, to being without them, to having only
himself to consider. I'm afraid he'd find them in the way."</p>

<p>"And yet it was of Richard I was thinking," said the old lady
gently.</p>

<p>"You say he's hard to manage, Mary," she went on. "But la!
child, what does that matter? He's kind, generous, straight as a
die&mdash;I'm sure I'm right in believing he's never done a mean
action in his life?"</p>

<p>"Never! It isn't in him."</p>

<p>"Well, then!" said Mother: and her cheerful old tone was like a
verbal poke in the ribs. "He might be easier to manage,
Mary&mdash;and thoughtless...or stingy...or attentive to other
women. You little know what you're spared, child, in not having
that to endure. There are some poor wives would think you like the
princess in the fairytale, who couldn't sleep for the pea." She
fell into a reverie over this, sat looking into the heart of the
fire. "Men?&mdash;ah, my dear! to me even the best of 'em seem only
like so many children. We have to be mothers to 'em as well as
wives, Mary; watch over them the same as over those we've borne;
and feel thankful if their nature is sound, behind all the little
surface tricks and naughtinesses. Men may err and stray, my dear,
but they must always find us here to come back to, and find us
forgiving and unchanged.&mdash;But tut, tut, what a sermon your old
mother's preaching you! As if you weren't the happiest of wives,"
and she laid her soft old hand on Mary's. "I got led into it, I
suppose, because of the strong tie between us: you're more like me,
Mary, than any of the rest. Another thing, too: I'm a very old
woman, my dear, and shan't live to see the end of the day's
business. So always remember, love, Mother's advice to you was
this: not to worry over small things&mdash;the big ones will need
all your strength. And you can't do Richard's experiencing for him,
Mary, however much you'd like to spare him the knocks and jars of
it.&mdash;But I do declare, here they come. Now what will they say
to finding us gossiping in the dark?"</p>

<p>The shoppers' steps echoed down the quiet street&mdash;really
sounding like one rather heavy footfall&mdash;and turned in at the
gate. And then there were voices and laughter and the sound of
rustling paper and snipped string in the little room, where Mary
lit the lamp, and Lisby displayed her presents&mdash;sweetmeats, a
piece of music she had coveted, a pair of puce-covered gloves, a
new net for her chignon&mdash;while Mother tried to prevent the
great round pork pie Mahony deposited on her lap, from sliding into
the grate.</p>

<p>"You dear naughty spendthrift of a man! Why, the girl's head
will be turned."</p>

<p>"Come, mother, let me give her a little pleasure."</p>

<p>"You give yourself more, or I'm much mistaken."</p>

<p>"Pooh! Such trifles! I shouldn't otherwise know what to do with
my small change," retorted Mahony. And Mary laughed and said:
"Wait, mother, till the practice really begins to move, and then
you'll see!"</p>

<p>This nudged Mahony's memory. "Has any one been?"</p>

<p>"They hadn't when I came over. And Mary Ann has not knocked at
the wall.&mdash;Oh yes, the boy called with an account from Mr.
Bealby."</p>

<p>The news of the empty afternoon, together with Mary's
colonialism, grated on Mahony. "<i>Do</i> knight him, my dear,
while you're about it," he said snappishly.</p>

<p>"Oh well, Bealby then. Though, I really can't see what it
matters. And out there, if I <i>hadn't</i> said Mr. Chambers, Mr.
Tangye, you would have been the one to suffer."</p>

<p>"And I can assure you, my dears, Bealby won't think any the
worse of you for turning him into a gentleman," soothed Mother.</p>

<p>"Oh! but Richard is very correct&mdash;aren't you, dear?"</p>

<p>Here Lisby had also to put in her spoke.</p>

<p>"And Bellvy Castle, pray?&mdash;what of Bellvy Castle? Has still
no groom come riding post-haste to summon you?"</p>

<p>Heartily tired of this jest, which he himself had innocently
started, Mahony picked up a book and stuck his nose in it. "No, nor
ever will."</p>

<p>"Come, Lisby," said Mother, "the kettle's boiling its head
off.&mdash;Richard, my dear, draw up your chair; you must be cold
and famished.&mdash;Nay, Mary, I'll not let you go home. We're
going to drink a cosy cup together. And afterwards Richard shall
tell us more adventures of the early days. I've looked forward to
it all the afternoon. It's as good as any book."</p>

<p>Mahony had more than once said to his wife: "Before I knew your
mother, Mary, I used to think <i>you</i> the warmest-hearted
creature under the sun. But now that I know her, love, and can draw
comparisons, I declare you sometimes seem to me quite a hard and
reasonable young woman."</p>

<p>And then he would fall to musing on the subject of wisdom inborn
and acquired. Here was this little old lady, who knew nothing of
the world, had never, indeed, travelled fifty miles from her native
place, and yet was richer in wisdom&mdash;intuitive wisdom, the
wisdom of the heart&mdash;than any second mortal he had met. He
could not picture to himself the situation, however tangled, that
Mary's mother would fail to see through, and, seeing, to judge
soundly and with loving kindness. Yes, his acquaintance with and
affection for her was the one thing that helped him over the blank
disappointment of these early weeks.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-4" id="ch-2-1-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>The surgery was a small, darkish room on the ground floor, a
step or two below street level; and the window behind which Mahony
spent the greater part of his first English winter was screened
from the curiosity of passers-by, by an attorney's brown gauze
shade. Across this blind he saw people move like shadows; or like
bodies immersed in water, only the tops of whose crowns shewed
above the surface. There went the hooded tray and crooked arm of
the tinkling muffin-man; and the wares of the buy-a-brooms. There,
also, to the deep notes of his bigger bell and his insistent: "To
all whom it may concern!" passed the shiny black hat of the town
crier. Regularly, too, at dusk, through fog or silvery rain, the
lamp-lighter's ladder and torch rose into Mahony's field of vision,
flicking alive the little gas flame that set his own brass plates
a-glitter.</p>

<p>About this surgery hung a disagreeable, penetrating
smell&mdash;a kind of blend of the countless drugs that had been
housed and mixed there for over half a century&mdash;and, air as
you might, it was not to be got rid of. It gave even Mary, who was
not sensitive to smells, the headache. Otherwise, during Richard's
absences she might have used this room, which held a comfortable
armchair. As it was, she found herself fairly crowded out. The
passage was so narrow that two people were a tight fit in it; and,
were more than two in waiting, they had to be furnished with seats
in the little parlour to the back, pokier, this, than even the
surgery, and very dark&mdash;Richard called it the "Black
Hole"&mdash;giving as it did on a walled-in yard no bigger than a
roofless prison cell. Altogether, the accommodation was so cramped
that it was like living in a mouse-trap. Still, it would have been
folly in the beginning to separate house from practice, when the
two had hung together for so long. Time enough later on to make
changes. Mary's own idea was to turn the first-floor bedroom into a
drawing-room. Richard talked of moving; of knocking two houses into
one; even of building for himself. In the meantime he had taken the
house on a short lease, preferring to pay a higher rent for a few
years than to bind himself for the mystic seven. And so it was
mainly in the bedroom that Mary spent her first winter; sewing,
sheerly to kill time, garments she did not need, or which she might
just as well have "given out." Sitting bent over her needle in the
half daylight, she could sometimes almost have smiled did she think
of the sacrifices they had made&mdash;all for this. But for the
most part she felt troubled and anxious. Richard had tied himself
down for three years; but not a month had passed before her
constant, nagging worry was: how long will he hold out?</p>

<p>Mahony, too, was offended by the atmosphere of his room: though
not so much by the drugs, to which his nose was seasoned, as by the
all-pervading reek of stale tobacco. This hung about and
persisted&mdash;though a carpenter speedily prised open the
hermetically sealed window&mdash;and only became bearable when a
good fire burned and the room was thoroughly warm. Cooled off, it
had a cold, flat, stagnant smell that turned you sick. His old
forerunner must have kept his pipe going like a furnace; have
wadded it, too, with the rankest of weeds. Even had the practice
been shaping satisfactorily this smell might have ended by driving
him from the room; which would also have meant from the house. As
things stood, however, it was not worth his while to think of
moving. Before a month was up he suspected what two months showed,
and three made plain as the nose on his face: the whole affair had
been of the nature of a gross take-in.</p>

<p>There he sat, with the last numbers of the medical journals, new
books on medicine before him, and was too unsettled to read, or, if
he did, to make sense of what he read. The mischief was not only
that the practice didn't move properly: what came was of entirely
the wrong sort. He had not had half a dozen calls to good houses
since starting. The patients who had thus far consulted him were
the servant-girls and petty tradesmen of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In fits of exasperation, he knew what it was to feel convinced
that the entries in the books laid before him at purchase, the rosy
tales of Brocklebank's receipts, had been invented for his
decoying. If not, what in the name of fortune had become of the
practice? In calmer moments, he absolved those about him from the
charge of wilful fraud: they had acted according to their
lights&mdash;that was all. That their way of looking at things was
not his, was constantly being brought home to him anew. And how,
indeed, could he expect them, who had passed their whole lives
fixed as vegetables on the selfsame spot, to know his touchstone
for a practice? For example, the visit, famous in local history,
paid by old Brocklebank to Bellevue Castle. On closer scrutiny this
dwindled into the bandaging of a turned ankle, an ankle belonging
to one of the under-servants who had slipped on a greasy cobble
while at market. Never had old B. set foot in the Castle: or, at
most&mdash;little more than a servant himself&mdash;had entered it
but by the back door. Chagrin was not the only feeling this
incident roused in Mahony: he found insufferable the obsequious
attitude of mind it spoke to in those concerned. Long residence in
a land where every honest man was the equal of his neighbour had
unfitted him for the genuflexions of the English middle-classes
before the footstools of the great. But he had given up trying to
make himself or his views intelligible. For all that those about
him understood, he might as well have been speaking Chinese; while
any reference to the position and income he had turned his back on,
called to their eyes a look of doubt, and even disbelief. They
considered him a supremely lucky man to have stepped into old
Brocklebank's shoes; and at his door alone would the blame be laid,
if he failed to succeed.</p>

<p>And failing he was! So far, he had booked the magnificent sum of
slightly over a couple of pounds weekly. Two pounds! It reminded
him of his first struggle-and-starve campaign on taking up practice
after his marriage. Only under one condition could he have faced
the present situation with equanimity; and that, paradoxically
enough, was, if he had not seen the colour of the money, and it had
stood on account to some of the big houses round about. As it was,
it dribbled in, a few shillings here, a few there; which meant that
his spending had also to be done in driblets&mdash;a habit it was
easier to lose than to recapture. Yes! if the handful of shares he
had left invested in the colony were not bringing in what they did,
he and Mary would at this moment have been reduced to living on
their capital.</p>

<p>Talking of Mary: her position here was another bite he could not
swallow. It had really not been fair of him to foist this kind of
thing on Mary. To begin with, the house&mdash;possibly the
neighbourhood, too, dark, crowded, airless did not suit her. She
looked pale and thin, and had never quite lost the cough she had
arrived with. How could she, indeed, when she sat for hours at a
stretch stooped over her needle? She had no society worth the
name&mdash;never a drive, a party, a bazaar. Her sole diversion was
tending her mother; undertaking the countless odd jobs the old lady
and her rheumaticky maidservant had need of. In one way, of course,
this was right and proper; and he did not begrudge her to the
mother from whom she had so long been parted. His grudge was aimed
at another quarter. Soon after Christmas Lisby had made good her
escape, and was now established as resident mistress at a Young
Ladies' Seminary, near Leeds. Which wormed, in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>No complaint crossed Mary's lips; she sacrificed herself as
cheerfully as usual. None the less, he owed one of his chief
worries during these weeks to Mary. For he could <i>feel</i> that
she did not expect him to hold fast, and lived in suspense lest he
should throw up the sponge. The consciousness of this galled
him&mdash;got on his nerves. Yet never had he felt so averse from
breaking silence. It was not only self-annoyance at the foolishness
he had been guilty of; or anticipation of a resigned, I-told-you-so
attitude on Mary's part&mdash;she <i>had</i> told him so, of
course; but it wouldn't be Mary if, when the crisis came, she
twitted him with it. No, what tied his tongue was his own
disinclination to face the future.</p>

<p>The result was that Mary, too, grew fidgety: it was so unlike
Richard to bottle himself up in this fashion. She began to be
afraid he was afraid of her and of what she might say. So, one
evening, as they sat together over book and needle, she herself
broke the ice by asking him point-blank whether he regretted having
settled in Leicester. "For I can see the practice is not doing much
in the meantime. Still...if you otherwise like the place..."</p>

<p>At her first word the torrent burst.</p>

<p>"<i>Like</i> it? I wish to God I'd never set foot in its hideous
red-brick streets! As for the practice not doing much&mdash;my
dear, it has melted into thin air, and that's all there is to say
about it. The great majority of that old horse-doctor's patients
have given me the go-by&mdash;what on earth has become of the
wealthy shoemakers, etc., whose names stood on his books, Heaven
alone knows! It can't be that they disapprove of my treatment, for
they've never even tried it. Upon my word, Mary, I sometimes think
the whole thing was a fake and a swindle. But I can tell you this:
if I stop here, I'm on the high road to becoming a sixpenny doctor
for the masses. And I will confess to feeling myself a little too
good for that."</p>

<p>"I should think so! It's really most unfortunate, Richard. But
what's to be done?"</p>

<p>"The only course I can see, is to get out of it. I've made a big
mistake, my dear, and the shortest and cheapest way in the end will
be to admit it and tot up the balance. I could curse myself now,
for not having taken your advice. Over hasty as always! The only
excuse for me is, I honestly believed there was money to be made
here. And was in a panic at the rate our funds were running
away."</p>

<p>"Well, it's no use crying over spilt milk. But since you own you
did rush rather blindly into this, be warned and don't, for
goodness sake, do the same thing in getting out of it. Give it a
year's trial."</p>

<p>But the bare idea turned him cold. Now, too, that he had had his
say, he felt doubly resolute. Aloud, he declared that another three
months spent in these dark quarters, among this stickiest
provinciality, in the mud, wind and rain of this dirty, wet, dismal
town, would drive him crazy. "The very smell of the place does for
me. Leather and corn and horses&mdash;horses and leather and corn!
A population of ostlers and grooms and commercial gentlemen, and
cattle-dealers and bull-necked farmers. No, thank you, my dear, no
more of it for me! Naturally I shall sell at a loss; but the sooner
the better, Mary, before the practice falls to pieces altogether."
And from this decision he was not to be moved.</p>

<p>The question of what next brought them to another deadlock. Mary
had got it into her head that, if he went from here, it should only
be to London&mdash;and was dumbfounded by the moody silence into
which he fell at London's very name.&mdash;"It's society you've
missed, Richard. Even had you got on well, you couldn't have put up
with the lack of that. But if you persist in sticking to your
original plan and going to live in some miserable little village,
it will be worse than ever. You used to say you felt cut off in
Ballarat. But since we've..."</p>

<p>"And you?...what about you, pray?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for me it's been different"&mdash;dear Mary!&mdash;"living
next door to my mother and all that."</p>

<p>"Well, I can tell you this, wife. I've grown more attached to
your mother, her kind heart and sound sense, than I was to any one
in all Australia. And certainly more than I am to my own."</p>

<p>"Surely it's time you proved that? What must they be thinking of
you?" ("They? Oh? they'll understand. You forget they're Irish,
too, love.") "Well, Richard, my advice is...if you're quite
determined to move from here...go and pay some visits and travel
about a bit, as you ought to have done at first."</p>

<p>Than this, no suggestion could have jumped better with Mahony's
mood: his cramped soul longed to stretch its wings. Spring was at
the door, too: that English spring the marvels of which he had seen
so often in imagination&mdash;and in imagination continued to catch
his only glimpse of them, shut up between brick walls as he was. At
Mary's words he had a sudden vision of all the
loveliness&mdash;green downs rolling to the sea, orchards in
blossom, dewy old bird-haunted gardens&mdash;that he had missed, in
flinging himself hugger-mugger on the business of money-making in
this sordid town. And so, overthrowing in his haste his original
plan of waiting till he was in more prosperous circumstances to
present himself, he packed his carpet-bag and went off to visit his
relatives and renew his acquaintance with his <i>alma mater</i>,
putting the practice up for sale, and leaving a <i>locum</i> to
hold together what remained of it. According to the innate
perversity of things, he had no sooner done this than it showed
signs of betterment. His substitute was called in to one of the
hosier kings, bespoken by the wife of a wealthy tanner. Mere
chance, of course, but it did look as though fate had a special
down on him.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The nominal goal of his journey was Dublin; and after that
Edinburgh. But when he looked back on the weeks that followed, he
saw them solely in the light of a journey into the past. And now,
too, he grasped why he had so long postponed embarking on it. He
was, he discovered, one of those who have a nervous aversion from
returning on their traces.</p>

<p>Alighting from his car at a corner of the square, he stood, bag
in hand, and gazed at his old home. It was very early on a gusty,
grey, spring morning; and he himself was cold and unslept. Already,
too, the spiritual depression that is Ireland's first gift to her
homing sons was invading him: looking about him he saw only
stagnation and decay. Here now he stood, a worn and elderly
wayfarer, over whose head thirty odd years had passed since, as a
boy, he light-heartedly trod this pavement. Thirty years! Yet it
might have been yesterday. For nothing was changed&mdash;or nothing
but himself. And, as he moved towards the house, he had&mdash;in
self-defence as it were&mdash;a moment of vision, in which the long
trail of his life swept past the eye of his mind: his rich, motley
life, with all its blanks and prizes, its joys, pains and
compensations, let alone the multitude of other lives with which it
had made contact. And to think there had been moments when he
counted it a failure!</p>

<p>In the bulging glass flower-case outside the ground-floor
window, a familiar collection of ferns and green things pursued
their morbid growth. Down in the area stood the empty saucer,
placed there full, of a night, for any thirsty beast that passed.
Here was the well-known dent in the brass knocker; the ugly crack
in the stone coping. As of old, the balcony showed green and
mildewed with the water that leaked from a pair of flower-tubs;
just as he remembered it, the white carriage step was split
asunder&mdash;a trap for delicate feet. With this difference, that
the mould was thicker, the split wider, the cracks more
pronounced.</p>

<p>It was the same with his relatives; they, too, had made giant
strides along the road of decay: throats had sagged, eyes grown
smaller, knuckles bonier. Of the three, the older generation had
worn best. His mother carried herself erectly, was
slender&mdash;slender to emaciation&mdash;and, an inveterate enemy
of crinoline, wore clinging, trailing black garments of a style all
her own, she and his sisters moving like lank, heavily draped
maypoles, where other women bulged and billowed and swam. ("Good
Lord, what frights!" was his verdict on this deviation from the
norm.) With their ivory faces, long, finely pointed noses, straight
Irish eyebrows and pretty, insincere Irish mouths, the three of
them looked like replicas of the one cameo (as did also he, could
he but have seen himself); and since, in age, there was less than a
score of years between the trio, the relationship might have been
that of sisters rather than mother and daughters.</p>

<p>Thus dispassionately, and Irishly, he viewed them. As they him.
"My beloved son, colony life is disastrous. It ruins the soul...as
it ruins the body."&mdash;From the way they looked at him, as this
was said, he saw that they found him unnaturally withered&mdash;old
for his age. Still, his greying temples and wrinkled brows touched
them little. compared with the burning question whether he had come
home in time to save this soul of his alive. For they were even
more deeply rapt than of old in the mysteries and ecstasies of
religion. On its conduct they lavished their remaining vitality;
while the mother faith, which flourished so abundantly around them,
supplied them with an outlet for the bitter hatred which life's
hardships had engendered in them. Popery was an invention of the
Arch-Fiend; its priests were the "men of sin." &mdash;To Mahony,
who had learnt to regard all sects and denominations as branches of
the one great tree, such an attitude was intolerable.</p>

<p>He stayed with them but for three days; longer he could not have
borne the lifeless atmosphere of his old home. But...seventeen
years, and for three days! There was, however, another reason.
Their poverty was such that it wrung his heart to have to watch
their shifts and makeshifts. In this big house not a single servant
moved; his sisters' thin, elderly hands were hard and seamy with
work. The two women rose at daybreak to clean the steps and polish
the knocker. Themselves they washed and ironed the finely darned
damask; kept bright the massive bits of silver, than which there
was little else on the oval surface of a dinner-table built to seat
a score of people. They did their scanty shopping in distant
neighbourhoods where they were not known, creeping out with their
baskets early in the morning, while others of their class were
still between the sheets. No! the food they set before him stuck in
his throat; it was so much taken from them, who looked so
bloodless. Yet, though he grudged himself each mouthful, he did not
dare either to refuse what was offered him, or to add to it by a
gift of money or eatables&mdash;anything that might have shown them
he saw how matters stood. Banknotes slipped, unmentioned, into a
letter from far Australia had been a different thing. These could
be politely ignored&mdash;as indeed they had always remained
unacknowledged. He imagined the fine gesture with which his mother
let them flutter through her fingers, in saying airily to Sophy and
Lucinda: "Some nonsense of poor Richard's!" He ventured no more
than to buy her a bouquet of cut flowers and a vellum-bound book of
devotions. Even hothouse grapes might have exuded a utilitarian
flavour. But all he felt went into his gift; and he knew just the
nerve in the proud old heart that would be satisfied by it. For
though he did not warm to them, yet like spoke to like, blood to
blood, directly they met again. He could read their private
thoughts, their secret feelings. At a glance he saw through the
inventions and excuses, the tricks and stratagems with which they
bolstered up their lives; while yet retaining their dignity as
great ladies. Again, the flashes of mordant humour, which not your
godliest Irishman can ever wholly subdue; or the sudden, caustic,
thumb-nail sketch of friend or foe: these were so familiar to him
as to seem his own: while the practical Irish habit of stripping
things of false sentiment was homely and refreshing. Thus, with
regard to Mary's childlessness, his mother queried briskly: "Has
fretted for lack of a family? Nonsense! In such a climate she was
much better without." Again: "Her relatives will miss you. No doubt
they placed great faith in your skill. Besides, your visits cost
them nothing." Or her description of a neighbour's state as: "A
demi-fortune &mdash;cab and one horse!"</p>

<p>Many were the inquiries made after Mary, the regrets expressed
at her absence; but he in his heart (as probably they in theirs)
felt relieved that she had not accompanied him. For Mary would
certainly have put her foot in it. There would have been no keeping
out of her face the pity she burned with; she would have made
presents where presents were an injury; have torn down veils that
were sacred, even between the women themselves; would, in short,
have come hopelessly to grief amid the shoals and quicksands
through which it was necessary to steer a course. Whereas to him
the task was second nature. He took leave of them without regret.
Once away, however, he was conscious of a feeling of something like
guilt towards them. For he understood now, only too plainly, what
the withdrawal of the ninety to a hundred pounds yearly, which in
his later, palmy days he had been able to allow them-what the
abrupt stoppage of this sum must have meant to them. It had no
doubt made all the difference between comparative ease and their
present dire poverty. Yet never by so much as a word had they
hinted at this. There was surely something great about them,
too&mdash;for all their oddity.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Did this experience give him the sensation of a dream in which
he, who was alive, went down among those who had ceased to live,
his return to Edinburgh and its well-known scenes had exactly the
opposite effect: made <i>him</i> feel like a shade permitted to
revisit the haunts of men. For here was life in all its pristine
vigour, life bubbling hot from the source&mdash;and aeons divided
him from it. Here he found again his own youth&mdash;eager,
restless, passionate-though encased now in other forms. Other keen
young spirits swept from hospital to theatre, and from theatre to
lecture-room, as he once had done; and were filled to the brim,
they, too, with high purpose and ambition. Never before had it been
made so clear to him of what small worth was the individual: of
what little account the human moulds in which this life-energy was
cast. Momentous alone was the presence of the great Breath: the
eternal motor impulse. Each young soul had its hour, followed a
starry trail, dreamed a kingship; then passed&mdash;vanishing in
the ranks of the mediocre, the disillusioned, the
conquered&mdash;to make room for the new company of aspirants
thronging on behind. Many of these lads would, no doubt, in looking
back, find as little in their lives to feel proud of as he found in
his: nothing accomplished of all they now so surely anticipated.
And one or other of them might also, when his time came, hover as
an elderly ghost, eyed with a flagrant curiosity by this insolently
young throng&mdash;how contemptuously would not he himself in old
days have stared at the apparition!&mdash;hover round the
precincts, the real old middle-aged hack, returned for a glimpse at
the scenes of his youth.&mdash;Such were his feelings, the
experience being one that drove his years home to him with a cruel
stab.</p>

<p>The result was, he fell into an elegiac mood; and not having
Mary at his elbow to nudge his attention to realities, he let day
after day slip by without calling on, or otherwise making himself
known to distinguished members of the profession. He shirked the
necessary explanations. The one attempt he did make turned out
poorly. Spelt, too, a good dose of patronage for this untrumpeted
doctor from the backwoods.</p>

<p>To Mary he wrote: "I do not see much advancement in physick."
But this was in self-excuse. Of a truth new ideas were in the air.
The shining lights of his own day, now but a pair of crabbed old
invalids, waited each for his mortal release. The man of the
hour&mdash;or so rumour had it &mdash;was a young surgeon in
Glasgow; which "Godforsaken" city British and foreign physicians
were actually travelling to and settling in, to see demonstrated a
new means for hindering germ-putrefaction. At first he himself
inclined to side with his old chief, who turned a cold shoulder on
young Lister and his experimenting. But after reading up the
subject in the Medical Library he changed his mind. Pasteur's
theory of the existence of certain spores in the atmosphere might
not yet be proved to every one's satisfaction; but the examples
published by this Dr. Lister, illustrating the successful
employment of the new method, could not but make a deep impression.
In the end, he would for two pins have taken rail himself to
Glasgow, where in even the most insanitary hospital wards pyaemia,
erysipelas and hospital gangrene had been well nigh stamped
out.</p>

<p>It was while he still lingered, ruminating these things, that he
saw advertised for sale a practice on the south coast of England,
in a locality which was described as lovely, sheltered, salubrious.
Something in the wording of the paragraph took his fancy and he
wrote for particulars. The reply was so favourable that, instead of
either travelling to Glasgow or going back to Leicester, he set out
by way of Bristol for the south. To see the place was straightway
to lose his heart to it; here, for once was a dream come true. The
advertiser turned out to be as young as Brocklebank had been
old&mdash;a practitioner of but a year's standing. But to the hardy
old surgeon as a reed to an oak. For even the soft air of this
sheltered nook had not been mild enough for a congenital
throat-weakness; and the young man was hieing him to the Cape,
where he proposed to settle. Such was his eagerness to be gone that
he came a considerable way to meet Mahony in the matter of
price.&mdash;And now letters passed and telegrams flew between
husband and wife; till, even the electric wire proving too
circumstantial for Richard's impatience, Mary was bidden to pack
her bag and join him there. She came, and was herself charmed with
the spot &mdash;as, indeed, how could she help being, cried
Richard, who was as elated as a child. You might search England
through, and not find its equal.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty was to get a house. Young Philips, as a
bachelor, had lived in furnished apartments; which of course was
impossible for them. But it was literally a case of Hobson's
choice. For most people owned their houses&mdash;had been born and
would die in them like their fathers before them&mdash;and in all
the place only two were vacant. One was of a type that disfigures
many a seaside town: a high, gloomy house &mdash;in a terrace of
three&mdash;standing right on the pavement of a side street. With
no garden of its own, it was darkened by the foliage of the big
trees in the gardens opposite. Still worse, it turned its back on
the sea. A lawyer had lived there; the ground-floor windows bore
the hated shades. His widow, planning to move from the
neighbourhood, was willing to let the house on lease. But Mahony
took a furious dislike to it; and even Mary thought it dull, and
rather large for the two of them. The second, much smaller and
older&mdash;some hundred and fifty years, said report&mdash;was, on
the other hand, bright and cheerful, and had a charming old-world
garden and a magnificent view across the Bay. But it was for sale.
Nor was the position it occupied so suitable as that of the
lawyer's: it stood above the town, half-way up a steep hill. Still,
distances were surely negligible, argued Mahony, in so small a
place; and whoever really needed a doctor would summon him, whether
it meant fifty yards further or no.</p>

<p>None the less the decision cost him his sleep of a night. Mary
was all in favour of the one to be rented: his inclinations leaned
to the other. He walked past this a dozen times a day, and went
over it so often that the agent suggested him keeping the keys
until he had made up his mind. It was ridiculous, he told himself,
to think of buying a house before he had sampled the practice; yet
seldom had he been so torn. And once again Mary, pitying his
distraction, came to the rescue and said, well, after all, perhaps
he should just buy and be done with it. For she saw what would
happen if he didn't: he would never cease to bemoan his loss, and
to find fault with the house he was in. Better for his peace of
mind that he should take the monetary risk&mdash;and though this
meant using up the last remainder of their available ready money.
But there was also another unspoken thought at the back of Mary's
mind. The knowledge that he had thus involved himself might help
him to sit firm, if&mdash;and with a person like Richard the
contingency <i>had</i> to be allowed for&mdash;if he afterwards
tired of the place.</p>

<p>So he bought; and not for a second had he regretted it&mdash;any
more than he regretted having pitched his tent in this loveliest of
spots. On the contrary he counted himself a remarkably lucky
man.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>And thus to Buddlecombe.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-5" id="ch-2-1-5"></a>Chapter V</h3>

<p>The practice bore out its reputation. The huckster, the publican
and the ostler were in the minority here; Mahony's visiting-list
was studded with good names. This change for the better, together
with the pride he took in his pretty house and garden, sent his
spirits up sky-high. And, as was natural, he read his own
satisfaction into others. "If I'm not much mistaken, Mary, people
here are well pleased to have a medical man of a reasonable age in
their midst again." It fell to Mary to keep him gently damped; to
prevent him skipping off the earth altogether, in his new-found
lightness of heart.</p>

<p>At first, though, even she had to admit there was nothing to
complain of.</p>

<p>For if Mahony here felt himself restored to his own level
professionally, on the social side&mdash;which was important,
too&mdash;things also promised to run smoothly. Of course, English
people were notoriously slow to take you to their hearts; and, even
after they had found out all about you, would still go walking
round you looking you up and down. Once, however, these sticklers
were sure with whom they had to deal, they made rich amends. And so
Mary had numerous callers of the right kind; and invitations
followed the calls. The vicar's wife took her up&mdash;a due
appearance at church having been made, and a pew hired&mdash;and
she joined a circle that sat twice a week to sew for the heathen.
Further, she was asked to help in visiting and distributing tracts
among the lower orders; in getting up a Penny Reading to raise
funds for the promulgation of the Gospel; to take a table at the
annual Sunday School Feast: was, in short, made free of all the
artless diversions of the parish.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the month was April; and the thousand and
one beauties of an exceptionally fine spring unrolled before their
eyes. Declared Mahony: to be present at this budding and bursting,
this sprouting and flowering, more than made up for the
disappointments he had suffered since landing in England. What a
feast of tender green, of changing colours, was here spread for
eyes sore with the harshness and aridity of the Australian
landscape, the eternal grey-green of its skimpy foliage! When he
first arrived, every sheltered slope and sunny bank was yellow with
primroses; the lesser celandine bedecked the meadow-grass, violets
were mauve and purple in the hedgerows; and no sooner did these
show signs of fading than the ground became blue with myriads of
bells, which, taken in the mass, looked like patches of sky dropped
to earth. And the blue in its turn yielded to the ruby-pink of the
red campion. Against a background of starry blackthorn blazed the
golden gorse. The cliffs were covered with the comical little
striped brown pokers of the horsetails, which soon branched out
into bristly brooms; and piercing the rust-red carpet of last
year's growth, up sprang the straight nimble spears of the bracken.
In the high hedges the ruddy cane of the willows was smothered by
the succulent green tips of hawthorn and bramble; and on the
rolling countryside that belle of trees, the larch, stood out among
the copperish buds of the beeches and the first tightly folded
leaves of the chestnuts, with a pale green feathery loveliness all
its own.</p>

<p>But with the onset of summer, when gardeners were busy netting
strawberry-beds and currant-bushes against the greedy thrush; and
the blackbird, his wooing done, was omitting the topnotes at the
end of his call: by this time, in spite of Mahony's liking for the
moderate but sympathetic practice, sly doubts had begun to invade
him whether things were really at bottom as satisfactory as they
seemed, or whether both in his professional and their twofold
social life, there was not a fly in the ointment. In his own case,
the suspicion soon deepened to a certainty.&mdash;Robinson was that
fly.</p>

<p>Of the person who bore his name he had naturally heard nothing
at the time of buying. Only by degrees did Robinson come within his
ken. A surgeon some years his junior, the fellow had originally, it
now turned out, held the whole practice of the place for miles
round in his hands. Then, three years previously, he had married a
rich widow&mdash;report credited her with eight to ten thousand a
year&mdash;bought a fine property and retired. Since
then&mdash;again according to rumour&mdash;he had spent more time
than was fitting in the company of the bottle. However that might
be, his former wide professional connection, his wife's money and
social standing, combined to make him <i>persona grata</i> in all
the best houses; while among the townspeople and villagers, slow of
wit and opposed to change as only English country-people could be,
the memory, or rather the habit of him, had persisted, to the
tribulation no doubt of his successors. For there came moments when
Mahony mistrusted the throat-weakness alleged by young Philips; or
at least wondered whether this was his sole reason for quitting so
promising a place after a bare year's trial. And who had preceded
Philips? At first what he, Mahony, had to meet was no more than a
casual mention of Robinson's name. "Mr. Robinson said this, or
would have done that"; and, at the outset, he had been simple
enough to believe it a slip of the tongue for Philips. He soon
learned better. A question put, a scrap of gossip retailed by Mary,
taught him that Robinson was still a power in the place. For yet a
while, however, he ascribed what was going on to hard-dying custom,
which might be overcome. The first time he scented actual danger
was when one of two spinsters he was attending complained of her
sister's slow progress, and said she would ask Mr. Robinson to look
in, he understanding their constitutions better than any one
else.</p>

<p>"If you do that, my good woman, you see no more of me!" was
Mahony's quick retort. And so he lost a patient.</p>

<p>Thereafter on his rounds he himself began to catch glimpses of
the bottle-nosed surgeon&mdash;sitting perched in a high gig beside
a groom in livery; altogether a very smart turn-out&mdash;and this
went on until it positively looked as if the fellow intended taking
up practice again...filching it back from under his very nose. A
pretty thing that would be to happen, now he had staked his all on
it! A shabby trick and no mistake!&mdash;one, too, that ran counter
to every known rule of medical etiquette.</p>

<p>The mischief was&mdash;with a brain like his&mdash;let the door
open to one such suspicion, and straightway a dozen others seized
the chance of inserting themselves. He next fell to questioning the
apparent ease with which Mary and he had entered the polite society
of the town. For, the longer he lived there, the more plainly he
saw just what a wasps' nest of caste and prejudice they had fallen
into. Social life in Buddlecombe was the most complicated affair
under the sun: was divided into innumerable grades; made up of a
series of cliques, rising one above the other and fitting as
exactly as a set of Japanese boxes. No such simple matter, and that
was a fact, for a pair of newcomers to find themselves to rights in
it. But they in their ignorance had pranced boldly in, where those
who knew better, walked warily and with discretion. The vicar's
wife had taken Mary up: yes; but by now Mahony had come to see that
she would be equally attentive to any one who might prove useful in
helping to run the parish, or in slaving for foreign missions. And
he began to doubt whether, often as Mary went to the vicarage, she
was invited to the really select parties there given. She had
never, for instance, met the Blakeneys of "The Towers," people he
knew to be hand-in-glove with the vicaress. Mary either did not
notice or, noticing, heed such trivial details she just laughed and
said: "Rubbish!" or "You <i>are</i> fanciful, Richard!"&mdash;but
he most emphatically did, and thanked you for being put off with
the second best. And besides her insensitiveness to slights, she
was hopelessly obtuse when it came to observing the invisible but
cast-iron barriers with which the various cliques hedged themselves
round, to keep those a step lower in the scale from coming too
near.</p>

<p>"Not shake hands with that nice old Mr. Dandy just because he
was once in trade? I never heard such a thing!" In Ballarat Mary
had been used to feel flattered did her grocer&mdash;rich,
influential, a trustee of the church, a member of the Horticultural
Society&mdash;emerge from behind the counter specially to chat with
her. "I think we should just make a beginning."</p>

<p>"Indeed and you'll put your foot in it with a vengeance, my
dear, if you try anything of that kind here...when I'm still
struggling to get a stand."</p>

<p>"Oh well, of course, if you look at it that way...But all the
same...when I think..." Her sentence tailed off into a speaking
silence.</p>

<p>He understood. "<i>Tempi passati</i>, love! Nowadays, we must do
as Rome does. &mdash;Recollect, too, my dear, these things may seem
trifling enough to you...and me...who have knocked about the world;
but to people here they're the very A B C of good
breeding&mdash;have been sucked in with their mother's milk. We
mustn't let ourselves appear ignoramuses of the first water."</p>

<p>"But I've <i>got</i> to be friendly with your patients, Richard,
whoever they are."</p>

<p>"True. But even you must draw the line somewhere, you know."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't; I'm not clever enough. It doesn't seem
human either. For we're all the same flesh and blood."</p>

<p>Yes, for the countless niceties and distinctions of social
etiquette, Mary had, as she confessed, little aptitude. It
sometimes seemed that, if a mistake was possible, she made it.</p>

<p>The two chief houses in Buddlecombe, the "Hall" and the "Court,"
were closed when the Mahonys settled there, the families being
respectively abroad and in residence in London. During their
absence the temporary leader, who gave the sign and set the key,
and to whom the vicar deferred with his treacliest smile, was the
owner of "Toplands." This was a Mrs. Challoner, a widow with two
sons, and a person of great wealth and importance&mdash;"Toplands"
was really the biggest and most up-to-date place in the
neighbourhood, both Hall and Court being cramped by comparison and
mouldy with age. But let the Trehernes or the Saxeby-Corbetts show
so much as the tips of their noses, and this lady subsided with
extraordinary swiftness, collapsed like a jack-in-the-box; for,
though her husband's antecedents were irreproachable, there was, on
her own side, some shadowy connection with "malt" which could never
be forgotten or forgiven her; or at least "only by the grace of
God...or of the Saxeby-Corbetts."</p>

<p>Mrs. Challoner was a member of the vicarage sewing-circle; and
here she met Mary, to whom she seemed to take a liking; for she
called, asked her to "Toplands," and, as a special mark of favour,
drove her out in her carriage; Mahony being simultaneously summoned
to attend the younger of the two sons, a delicate lad of seventeen.
Thus, when, in Mary's opinion, the time had come to return the
various invitations they had received, by herself sending out cards
for a party, she felt justified in including Mrs. Challoner. And,
sure enough, had in reply a graceful note of acceptance. So far
good. But now it was that Mary let her hospitable impulses outride
her discretion. At the vicarage she had made a further
acquaintance, in the shape of a Mrs. Johnston-Perkes, a very
charming lady who had been settled in Buddlecombe not much longer
than they themselves. And having it from this person's own lips
that she came of a good Oxfordshire family, besides meeting her
where she did&mdash;Mrs. Dandy, for example, was not made free of
the sewing-club&mdash;how was Mary to guess that the
Johnston-Perkes were not "in the swim"? Nor could Richard have
helped her. For the dark fact, unknown to either, was that in his
day the husband's father had had some Connection with a publishing
firm; and though Mr. Perkes himself had never soiled his hands
thus, yet the business stigma &mdash;pray, did not the issuing of
books imply the abhorred counter?&mdash;clung to him and his
lady-wife and tracked them from place to place. What followed
proved&mdash;according to Mahony&mdash;that, though good enough for
God and His works&mdash;witness the lady's presence at the
vicarage!&mdash;the Johnston-Perkes were not by any means good
enough for the upper crust of Buddlecombe; and the consequence was,
Mary's party was a failure. There was no open contretemps; Mrs.
Challoner and her satellites behaved with perfect civility. But it
was impossible, to Mahony's mind, to misread the crippling surprise
writ big on these people's faces; and the atmosphere of the
drawing-room remained icy&mdash;would not thaw.</p>

<p>Another thing that sent people's eyebrows up was the supper to
which Mary sat them down as the clock struck ten. At this date she
had not been long enough in Buddlecombe to know it for an
unalterable rule that, unless the invitation was to dinner, a
heavy, stodgy dinner of one solid course after another, from which,
if you happened to be a peckish eater, you rose feeling as though
you could never look on food again; except in this case, the
refreshment offered was of the lightest and most genteel: a
biscuit; a jug of barley-water for the gouty, or lemon-water for
the young&mdash;at most, a glass of inferior sherry, cellars not
being tapped to any extent on such occasions. But Mary had gone at
her supper in good old style, giving of her best. And Mahony was so
used to leaving such matters entirely to her that it had never
entered his head to inferfere. Not until the party was squeezed
into the little dining-room, round a lengthened dinner-table on
which jellies twinkled, cold fowls lay trussed, sandwiches were
piled loaf-high&mdash;not till then and till he saw the amazed
glances flying between the ladies, did he grasp how wrong Mary had
gone. A laden supper-table was an innovation: and who were these
newcomers, hailing from God knew where, to attempt to improve on
the customs of Buddlecombe? It was also a trap for the
gouty&mdash;and all were gouty more or less. Thirdly, such
profusion constituted a cutting criticism on the meagre
refreshments that were here the rule. He grew stiff with
embarrassment; felt, if possible, even more uncomfortable than did
poor Mary, at the refusals and head-shakings that went down one
side of the table and up the other. For none broke more than the
customary Abernethy, or crumpled a sandwich. Liver-wings and slices
of breast, ham patties and sausage-rolls made the round, in vain.
Mrs. Challoner gave the cue; and even the vicar, a hearty eater,
followed her lead, the only person to indulge being the worthy
gentleman who had caused half the trouble&mdash;and <i>him</i>
Mahony caught being kicked by his wife under the table.</p>

<p>He felt so sore on Mary's behalf that, by the time he had
escorted the last guest through the sentry-box porch, he was fairly
boiling over. Flinging downstairs to the dining-room, where he
found his wife disconsolately regarding her table&mdash;it looked
almost as neat as when she first arranged it&mdash;he flashed out:
"Well, you've done it now! What in heaven's name possessed you to
sit people down to a spread like this?"</p>

<p>Mary had begun to collect her tartlets&mdash;dozens of
them&mdash;on one large dish, and was too preoccupied to lend him
more than half an ear. To herself she said: "What <i>shall</i> I do
with them?"</p>

<p>"Do? Bury 'em, my dear, in a corner of the garden&mdash;hide 'em
away out of sight! I wish you could get the memory out of people's
minds as easily. <i>our</i> supper-party will be the talk of
Buddlecombe for many a day to come!"</p>

<p>"Just because I tried to make it as nice as I knew how? I think
you judge every one by yourself, Richard. Because you didn't enjoy
it..."</p>

<p>"Then why was nothing touched?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they didn't feel hungry. I oughtn't to have had it till
an hour later."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort! Though you had given it to 'em at five in
the morning, they would still have walked home on empty stomachs.
This kind of thing isn't done here, and the sooner you get that
into your head the better!"</p>

<p>"Never will I descend to their starvation-diet!" cried Mary
warmly.</p>

<p>"Another thing: what in heaven's name induced you to mix those
Perkeses up with Mrs. Challoner and her set? That was <i>faux
pas</i> of the first water."</p>

<p>"I do declare I never seem to do anything right! But you said
nothing: you didn't know. For if it comes to that, Richard, you
make mistakes, too."</p>

<p>"Indeed and I should like to know how?"&mdash;Mahony was huffed
in a second.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to say anything about it. But it appears the
vicar took it very badly, the other Sunday, that you went to hear
that London preacher at the Methodist Chapel. I overheard something
that was said at the last sewing-party&mdash;about your perhaps
being really a dissenter."</p>

<p>"Well, of all the...objects to my going to hear a well-known
preacher, just because he belongs to another sect?
Preposterous!"</p>

<p>"Yes, if it's anything to do with yourself, it's preposterous.
But when it's me, it's mistakes, and <i>faux pas</i>, and all the
rest of it. Sometimes I really feel quite confused. To remember I
mustn't shake hands here or even bow there. That in some quarters I
must only say 'Good afternoon,' and not 'How do you do?'&mdash;and
then the other way round as well. That nice Mrs. Perkes is not the
thing and ought to be cold-shouldered; and when I have company I'm
not to give them anything to eat. Oh, Richard, it all seems to me
such <i>fudge!</i> How grown-up people can spend their lives being
so silly, I don't know. Out <i>there</i>, you had to forget what a
person's outside was like&mdash;I mean his table-manners and
whether he could say his aitches&mdash;as long as he got on and was
capable...or rich. But here it's always: '<i>Who</i> is he? How far
back can he trace his pedigree?'&mdash;and nothing else seems to
matter a bit. I do believe you might be friends with a swindler or
a thief, as long as his family-tree was all right. And the disgrace
trade seems to be! Why, looked at this way there wasn't any one in
Ballarat who was fit to know. Just think of Tilly and old Mr.
Ocock. Here they would be put down as the vulgarest of the vulgar.
One certainly wouldn't be able even to <i>bow</i> to them! And then
remember all they were to us, and how fond I was of Tilly, and what
a splendid character she had. No, this kind of thing goes against
the grain in me. I'm afraid the truth is, I like them vulgar best.
And I'm too old, now, to change."</p>

<p>"You too old!" cried Mahony, amazed to hear this, his own dirge,
on his wife's lips. "Why, Mary love,"&mdash;and from where he sat
he held out his hand to her across the table, over the creams and
jellies standing like flowers in their cups. "You but a couple of
months over thirty, and far and away the best-looking woman in the
place! Candidly, my dear, never did I set eyes on such a pack of
scarecrows&mdash;from the vicaress with her wolf's teeth, up the
scale and down."</p>

<p>"You don't feel very happy or at home here, love&mdash;I see
that," he went on. "And I sometimes doubt, my dear, whether I did
right to uproot you from your adopted country."</p>

<p>"I certainly liked being there better than here. Still I'm quite
ready, as you know, to put up with things. Only you mustn't scold
me, Richard, when I make mistakes I do my best, dear, but..."</p>

<p>"We'll lay our heads together, love, and so avoid them. And as a
beginning, Mary, we'll stifle the natural feelings of friendliness
and goodwill we have always had for our fellow-mortals&mdash;no
matter what their rank in life. We'll forget that we're all, as you
say, the sons of Adam, and are placed on this earth-ball but for a
very brief period, in which it would certainly be to our advantage
to love our neighbours as ourselves. And we'll learn to be narrow,
and bigoted, and snobbish, and mean with our grub...eh, Mary?
Joking apart, my dear, you see how it is. We've either got to adapt
ourselves to the petty outlook of those about us, or be regarded as
a pair of boors who've brought home with them the manners and
habits of the backwoods. And that means turning out again, love.
For I won't stay here to be looked down on...when I feel every whit
as good as anybody else."</p>

<p>"Now when you talk like that, Richard...You know I'm willing to
put up with any mortal thing, as long as I can feel sure you're
happy and contented. But when I think, dear, of the down <i>you</i>
used to have on narrowness and snobbishness...And this is even
worse."</p>

<p>"All the same, I felt I could stand no more of the rough
diamonds we had to hobnob with out there."</p>

<p>"Still, some were diamonds, weren't they?"</p>

<p>"What we need, you and I, Mary, is a society that would take the
best from both sides. The warm-heartedness of our colonial friends,
their generosity and hospitality; while we could do without the
promiscuity, the worship of money, the general loudness and want of
refinement.&mdash;You wonder if I shall be happy here? I like the
place, love; it's an ideal spot. I like this solid old house, too:
and so far the climate has suited me. I seem to be getting on
fairly well with the people; and though the practice is still
nothing extraordinary, it has possibilities."</p>

<p>"Yes; but..."</p>

<p>"But? Well, I undoubtedly miss the income I used to have;
there's little money to be made&mdash;compared with Ballarat, it's
the merest niggling. And besides that, there was a certain breadth
of view&mdash;that we'd got used to, you and I. Here, things
sometimes seem atrociously cramped and small. But we must remember
good exists everywhere and in every one, wife, if we only take the
trouble to look for it. And since the fates have pitched us here,
here we must stay and work our vein until we've laid the gold bare.
We've got each other, love, and that's the chief thing."</p>

<p>"Of course it is."</p>

<p>And now they were up and doing, he helping her to stow away her
feast that it should not meet Selina's eye in the morning. And over
this there was a good deal of merriment: they had to eat up some of
the more perishable things themselves, which they did to a
confession from Mary that she really had not meant to make
<i>quite</i> so much, but had been lured on from one thing to
another, by the thought of how nice it would look on the table.
They packed away a decent amount in the larder, for appearance
sake; the rest in a cupboard in the surgery.</p>

<p>But afterwards, Mary as she took down her hair, Mahony as he
went round the house locking up, each dedicated the matter a
further and private refection. She said to herself, astonished: "I
do believe Richard is turning radical," and then went on to muse, a
little wryly, that the "fates" to which he so jauntily referred
were, after all, but another name for his own caprices. He, on the
other hand, after justifying an omission to himself with: "No use
worrying the poor little soul about that dam fool Robinson!" sent
her a thought so warm that it resembled a caress. For at heart his
whole sympathy was with Mary and Mary's ineradicable generosity.
Alone, and his irritation cooled, he ranged himself staunchly on
her side, against the stiff, uncharitable little world into which
they were fallen.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-6" id="ch-2-1-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>Entering the house late one summer afternoon, his pockets bulged
with scraps of weed and wild-flower&mdash;the country people still
gaped at sight of their doctor descended from his trap, a round
glass in one eye, poking and prying in the hedgerows&mdash;Mahony
was turning these specimens out on the hall table when Mary called
to him from the dining-room. "Richard! A great surprise!"</p>

<p>He went downstairs to her, pulling off his gloves. "What?...the
mail in already? I calculated it wasn't due for another week at
least."</p>

<p>"And such a big one!"</p>

<p>Mary sat in an armchair, her lap full of envelopes, a closely
written sheet of foreign note in her hand. Mahony picked up the
several letters bearing his name, and ran his eye over the
superscriptions. Their English post-bag was a lean one; but the
arrival of the Australian mail more than atoned for it; and the
deciphering of the crossed and recrossed pages, the discussing of
news from the old home occupied the pair of them for days. Among
his pile Mahony found a letter from Chinnery of the London
Chartered, another from Archdeacon Long, a third from an old
fellow-practitioner; while a bulky envelope promised a full
business statement from the agent whom he had left in charge of his
affairs. Taking off his greatcoat he sat down to read at his
ease.</p>

<p>First, though, he had to hear from Mary the gist of those she
had fleetly skimmed, prior to going back and reading them over
again, word by word, with a brooding seriousness.</p>

<p>"Just fancy, John writes he's been forced to shut up his house
and go and live at the Melbourne Club. <i>What</i> a state of
things! That lovely house left to go to rack and ruin. It seems the
last housekeeper turned out worst of all. She didn't set her cap at
him, like Mrs. Perry, but he discovered that she was carrying on
improperly with men. To think of a woman like that looking after
poor Jinny's children! Now John has put all three to
boarding-school. And Josey still the merest baby. How he expects
them to thrive, I don't know&mdash;with never a proper home, or a
mother's care. Then, here's Trotty...or Emma as he will persist in
calling her...accused of being idle and flighty. Trotty flighty! If
ever there was a dear, good-hearted little soul...easy to manage
and open as the day. But John still seems to have his old down on
Emma's children. And that brings me to some bad news. Johnny has
run away. Listen to this.</p>

<p>"AND NOW I PASS TO THE DOINGS OF MY SON AND HEIR. AFTER KEEPING
THE BOY TO HIS DESK UNDER MY OWN EYE FOR THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS,
AND ENDEAVOURING BY PRECEPT AND SEVERITY TO MAKE AN HONEST MAN OF
HIM&mdash;IN VAIN, MARY, FOR NEVER A MOMENT'S GRATIFICATION OR
SATISFACTION HAVE I HAD FROM HIM; NEVER A THANK-YOU HAS HE GIVEN ME
FOR ALL THE MONEY SPENT ON HIM&mdash;HE WAS LAZY, DECEPTIVE, AND
FREQUENTED LOOSE COMPANY...Richard! At seventeen!...NEGLECTED HIS
DUTIES, TOOK MORE WINE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM, PLAYED CARDS FOR
MONEY, AND IN THE END WENT SO FAR AS TO ABSTRACT HIS LOSSES FROM MY
PRIVATE DRAWER.&mdash;Isn't it dreadful?&mdash;WHEN I TAXED HIM
WITH IT, AND THREATENED HIM WITH EXPOSURE, HE AS GOOD AS WHISTLED
IN MY FACE; THEN ACTUALLY HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASSERT HE OWED ME NO
GRATITUDE, SINCE I HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING FOR HIM; AND THE NEXT
MORNING HE WAS MISSING&mdash;HIS BED HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT IN. WHEN
AFTER THE LAPSE OF SEVERAL WEEKS I CONTRIVED TO TRACK HIM, I
LEARNED, TO MY SHAME AND DISGRACE, THAT HE HAD SHIPPED BEFORE THE
MAST TO THAT ELDORADO OF THIEVES AND SCOUNDRELS, AMERICA. NOW HE
MAY SHIFT FOR HIMSELF; I WASH MY HANDS OF HIM. I HAVE CUT HIM OUT
OF MY WILL AND SHALL DO THE SAME BY EMMA, UNLESS SHE MENDS HER
WAYS. YOU WILL SCARCELY CREDIT IT, MY DEAR MARY, BUT HER
SCHOOLMISTRESS WRITES ME THAT THE GIRL&mdash;NOT YET FIFTEEN YEARS
OF AGE, MARK YOU!&mdash;HAS HAD TO BE 'PUBLICLY REBUKED' FOR
COQUETTING WITH MEMBERS OF THE OTHER SEX IN A PLACE OF
WORSHIP.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, stuff and nonsense, John! Never will I believe such a thing
of Trotty. I know the child a great deal better than you. If I were
only there, to find out what it all means He winds up with the
usual: THANK GOD, JANE'S CHILDREN ARE OF ANOTHER DISPOSITION. I AM
CONFIDENT I SHALL NEVER BE DISGRACED BY THEM. No, my dear John,
they haven't the spirit. But...well, I never did!" and Mary let her
hand fall flop on the table. "Just listen to this! A
postscript&mdash;I didn't see it before. He says: YOUR SISTER ZARA
SEEMS ABOUT TO MAKE A FOOL OF THE FIRST WATER OF HERSELF. SHE IS, I
HEAR&mdash;FOR I HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF HER, I AM THANKFUL TO
SAY&mdash;CONTEMPLATING MATRIMONY.&mdash;Richard! And he doesn't
even say who to. Isn't that like a man? Can it...could it be...But
there! I believe I saw a letter from Zara herself."</p>

<p>Dropping John's, Mary picked on one of the envelopes in her lap,
slit it open and began to fly the lines. "Mm...a tirade against
John, of course...how those two do bicker! They seem to get worse
as they grow older. Now where can it be? Mm...NO ONE CAN PUT UP
WITH HIM ANY LONGER...HAS HAD TO CLOSE HIS HOUSE, THUS
PROVING&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hullo, my dear, here's news!" cried Mahony and slapped his
thigh. He had waited patiently for John's Jeremiad to end. In
Zara's pursuit of matrimony he took no interest whatever. "Well,
upon my word!...who would have dreamt of this? Those <i>Australia
Felixes</i>...you remember, Mary, I bought them rather as a pig in
a poke; and they've done nothing but make calls ever since. Now
here they are declaring a three-pound dividend. My highest
expectations did not exceed thirty shillings and even that would
have been handsome. Think what it will be when they get in ten more
stamps. Fifty pounds a month, for certain! My dear! we shall end by
being moneyed people after all."</p>

<p>"Indeed I hope so," said Mary; and resumed her search for Zara's
plum. "It looks as if she's not going to mention it. This is all
about her pupils. They dote on her as usual, and she drives out
every day in the carriage. Zara is certainly lucky in her
employers.&mdash;Oh, here it is&mdash;tucked away in a postscript.
OTHER AND FAIRER PROSPECTS BECKON, MY DEAR MARY, THAN THOSE OF
ETERNALLY IMPROVING THE MINDS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN. AT
PRESENT I CAN SAY NO MORE. BUT YOUR CLEVERNESS WILL NO DOUBT ENABLE
YOU TO DIVINE WHAT I LEAVE UNSAID. And that's all. Now I suppose I
must wait another three months to hear who it is and how it
happened. Oh dear, how <i>out</i> of everything we do seem
here!"</p>

<p>"They've got the money for the chancel at last," threw in
Mahony. "I must write and congratulate Long. Splendid work! They've
had the laying ceremony, too, and hope twelve months hence that the
Bishop will be up consecrating. The last Fancy Bazaar did the job.
Here's a message to you. Mrs. Long's warm love, and she missed your
help sadly at the refreshment-stall.&mdash;What? Well, I'm hanged!
Old Higgins in my place as Trustee. Ha, ha! Listen to this. AND NOW
AN ITEM, DOCTOR, AFTER YOUR OWN HEART. WE RECENTLY HAD WITH US A
DISCIPLE AND FOLLOWER OF SPURGEON&mdash;ONE OF THE FAITHFUL WHO
SECEDED WITH THE GREAT MAN FROM THE EVANGELICAL ALLIANCE. HE
PREACHED A FIRST TIME IN THE BAPTIST CHAPEL, BUT THIS PROVED TOO
SMALL TO HOLD A QUARTER OF THOSE WHO WISHED TO HEAR HIM. AND SO THE
SECOND TIME, ON A SUNDAY EVENING, HE APPEARED ON THE PLATFORM OF
THE NEW ALFRED HALL. THIS WAS PACKED TO THE DOORS. THE CONSEQUENCE
WAS I PREACHED TO EMPTY BENCHES. WELL! BELIEVING THAT THE WORD OF
GOD REMAINS THE WORD OF GOD, NO MATTER UNDER WHAT GUISE IT IS
PRESENTED, I CUT MY DISCOURSE SHORT, DOFFED MY CASSOCK AND WENT
HOME TO BED. THE WORTHY FELLOW CALLED ON ME NEXT DAY; WISHED TO
EXCHANGE BIBLES&mdash;HIS, I AM TOLD, DEEPLY UNDER-SCORED&mdash;BUT
I DID NOT FEEL JUSTIFIED IN GOING SO FAR AS THAT."</p>

<p>"Oh, Polly's lost her baby, poor thing!" cried Mary, whom the
doings of Spurgeon's follower interested but mildly. "I do feel
sorry for her. Not but what she takes it very sensibly. And if you
think...six children and that teeny-weeny house. Still, it's rather
sad. She says: OF COURSE NOBODY MISSES IT OR CARED ANYTHING ABOUT
IT BUT ME. BUT IT WAS RATHER A NICE LITTLE KID MARY, AND WELL
FORMED. I HAD IT AT THE BREAST FOR A DAY, AND FELT ITS LITTLE
FINGERS, AND IT HAD BLUE EYES. Now fancy that!&mdash;and the rest
of them so dark. Polly would think it belonged all the more to her,
because of it. She says Ned's keeping a little steadier&mdash;that
will be good news for Mother. He's clerk in a coal merchant's
office now, and brings home his wages pretty regularly. Poor old
Ned!" and Mary sighed.</p>

<p>But a message in Mr. Chinnery's made her smile. TELL MRS. MAHONY
HOW MUCH SHE IS MISSED IN SOCIETY HERE. THOSE PLEASANT EVENINGS WE
USED TO SPEND AT YOUR HOUSE, DOCTOR, AND HER FAMOUS SUPPERS ARE
STILL TALKED OF, AND WILL LONG BE REMEMBERED. "There, my dear!
that's a feather in your cap, and should console you for recent
happenings."</p>

<p>With this Mahony's budget was exhausted, and he rose to go to
the surgery, where he proposed to make a few calculations in
connection with his little windfall. But Mary held him back for yet
a moment.</p>

<p>"I declare marrying's in the air. Now here's Jerry gone and got
engaged. Who to? He writes: THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN ALL THE WORLD AND
THE BEST AS WELL. Let us only hope that's true. Dear old Jerry! He
deserves a good wife, if ever anyone did. But, oh dear me! she's
only sixteen&mdash;barely a year older than Trotty. That's too
young."</p>

<p>"Is it indeed? I know somebody who was once of a different
opinion."</p>

<p>"But I was old for my age. Dear Jerry! He's so sensible in other
things. If only he has not let his feelings run away with him
here!"</p>

<p>"Poor old Mary wife! If only you were there to look after them
all, eh? Better as it is, love. You'd have the burden of Atlas on
your shoulders again."</p>

<p>"What atlas?" asked Mary absently, having passed to her next
correspondent.</p>

<p>But the letter she spent longest over was the one she kept till
the last&mdash;till Richard had retired to his room. For only to
Tilly did she write nowadays with anything approaching frankness;
and in this reply, oddly written, indifferently spelt, there might
be private references to things she had said, besides the plain
truth about all and any it touched on. Afterwards Richard would
get, in her own words, all he needed to hear.</p>

<p>BEAMISH HOUSE,<br>
LAKE WENDOUREE,<br>
BALLARAT.</p>

<p>MY DARLING MARY,&mdash;YOURS OF 19TH WAS A RARE OLD TREAT. JOB
BROUGHT IT WHEN I WASN'T AT HOME&mdash;I'D DRIVEN OUT TO HAVE A
LOOK AT THE MARE ZOE, WHO'S IN FOAL AND AT GRASS IN A PADDOCK OF
WILLY URQUHART'S. DIDN'T I POUNCE ON IT WHEN I FOUND IT. I READ IT
THROUGH TWICE WITHOUT STOPPING, MY DEAR. AND DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER TO
BE GLAD OR SORRY WHEN I'D DONE. YOU WRITE CHEERY ENOUGH, MARY, BUT
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME YOU CAN BE REALLY HAPPY IN A PLACE LIKE YOU
SAY LEICESTER IS&mdash;ALL DAMP AND DREARY, AND NO GARDEN OR SPACE,
AND SO LITTLE COMPANY. I'M GLAD IT ISN'T ME &mdash;THAT'S ALL.
AUSTRALY FOR EVER, FOR THIS CHICKEN. YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE RAINY
SEASON MAKES ME GET COLD SHIVERS DOWN MY SPINE. GIVE ME THE SUN,
THANK YOU, AND HORSES AND A GARDEN, AND EVERYTHING JUST AS JOLLY AS
CAN BE. FINE FEATHERS AND BLUE BLOOD AREN'T IN MY LINE ANYHOW.</p>

<p>NOW FOR MY BUDGET. I'M STILL THE GAY OLD WIDDER I WAS WHEN YOU
HEARD LAST, AND HAVEN'T FELT TEMPTED TO CHANGE MY STATE. TO TELL
THE TRUTH, MARY, THOUGH I GAD ABOUT AS USUAL AND DON'T SIT AT HOME
AND PULL A LONG FACE, I STILL MISS DEAR OLD PA. IT WAS SO HOMEY TO
HEAR HIM SAY: "NOW THEN, WHAT'S MY GIRL BEEN UP TO TO-DAY?"
WHENEVER I CAME IN, AND THE JOY OF MY LIFE TO HELP HIM SET HIS WILL
AGAINST MONSEER H.'S. WELL, HE CAN'T SAY HE'S FORGOTTEN. I'VE PUT
HIM UP THE GRANDEST MONUMENT IN ALL THE NEW CEMETERY. PA IN A SORT
OF NIGHTSHIRT, MARY, WITH WINGS ATTACHED, FLYING OFF, AND A FEMALE
FIGURE ALL BOWED UP AND WEEPING ON THE GROUND. THIS IS ALL RIGHT
FOR ME, BUT SOMETIMES I THINK PA WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN TOOK JUST
SITTING ON A LOG AND SMOKING HIS PIPE. BUT HENRY AND THE MAN AS
DONE IT WOULDN'T HEAR OF SUCH A THING, SAID IT WOULDN'T BE
IDEEL.</p>

<p>THE CHIEF NEWS OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS THAT TOM AND JOHNNY HAS
MOVED OUT. I WAS FOR KEEPING THEM ON&mdash;WE'RE NONE OF US
CHICKENS ANY MORE&mdash;BUT HENRY PECKED AND NAGGED AT ME ABOUT
PROPRIETY, TILL I GAVE IN FOR SHEER PEACE SAKE. THEY'RE BOARDED
OUT, POOR BOYS, AND TOM COMES OVER EVERY MORNING TO SEE AFTER THE
FOWLS. ONE OF THESE DAYS I SHALL HAVE TO PUT MY FOOT DOWN AND
SQUASH HENRY&mdash;I SEE THAT. FOR IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE WEEDS.
PA USED TO SAY: "WEAR NO WEEPERS FOR ME, TILDA!"&mdash;MEANING
VEILS AND HANGERS AND ALL THAT&mdash;"YOU'VE NOTHING TO GRIEVE FOR,
OLD GIRL." AND I TO COMFORT HIM: "RIGHT YOU ARE, OLD JO! IF MY
MEMORY LASTS SO LONG, THAT IS, FOR YOU'LL BEAT METHUSELAH YET!" BUT
WHEN HENRY HEARD OF IT, HE ALL BUT STOOD ON HIS HEAD&mdash;MY DEAR,
HE HAS AGNES GOING ROUND WITH A FLOUNCE OF CREPE A YARD WIDE ON HER
SKIRTS. AND INDEED, MARY, I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE FACED WALKING
UP THE AISLE OF A SUNDAY WITHOUT A BLACK BONNET AND ALL COMPLETE;
THOUGH BETWEEN OURSELVES IT MAKES ME FEEL A PROPER CROW. DON'T
TELL, BUT WHEN I DRIVE OUT INTO THE BUSH I STUFF A SHADY OLD HAT IN
A BASKET UNDER THE SEAT, AND AS SOON AS I GET FAR ENOUGH, I OFF
WITH THE BONNET AND ON WITH THE HAT. THE WEEPERS DO DRAW THE FLIES
SO. AYE, AND FLIES OF ANOTHER COLOUR TOO, MARY, IF YOU'LL BELIEVE
ME. BUT THEY COME TO THE WRONG SHOP HERE; NONE OF YOUR LONG-NOSED
FORTUNE-SNUFFLERS FOR ME. AND THAT REMINDS ME&mdash;WHAT DO YOU
THINK HENRY'S LATEST IS? SAYS I OUGHT TO HAVE SOME ONE TO LIVE WITH
ME&mdash;THAT IT ISN'T COMMY FAUT FOR AN ATTRACTIVE YOUNG
WIDDER-WOMAN TO LIVE ALL ALONE! HA HA! DO YOU SEE ANY GREEN IN THIS
CHILD'S EYE? I THINK I CAN BE TRUSTED, DON'T YOU, MARY, TO LOOK
AFTER MYSELF. BUT I ENJOY KEEPING MOSSIEU HENRY ON THE QUAKE. WHAT
HE'S AFRAID OF IS THAT ALL I GOT FROM POOR OLD PA WON'T FALL TO HIS
AND AGNES'S KIDS WHEN I HOP THE TWIG. TALKING OF AGNES, I DON'T SEE
MILADI ONCE IN A BLUE MOON NOWADAYS. I HEAR SHE'S "NOT AT ALL
WELL." IT'S MY PRIVATE BELIEF SOMETHING'S WRONG THERE, MARY.
THEY'VE CHANGED DOCTORS THREE TIMES, TELL YOUR HUSBAND, SINCE HE
LEFT. LOUISE URQUHART'S PRESENTED HER HUSBAND WITH THE ELEVENTH.
HOW SHE KEEPS IT UP SO REGULAR BEATS ME. BUT THERE'S RUCTIONS IN
THAT FAMILY AT PRESENT. WILLY'S BEEN UNUSUAL GAY. THIS TIME IT WAS
A GOVERNESS, A REAL YOUNG SPARK THEY HAD UP TO YARANGOBILLY TO
TEACH THE KIDS.</p>

<p>SHE GOT BUNDLED OUT DOUBLE-QUICK AT THE END, AND WILLY'S LOOKED
MEEK AS A SUCKING-LAMB EVER SINCE. I DROP IN TO SEE NED'S POLLY NOW
AND AGAIN&mdash;YOU'VE HEARD I SUPPOSE SHE LOST HER LAST. AND A
GOOD THING TOO. SHE'S GOT MORE THAN SHE CAN MANAGE AS IT IS. I
HEARD FROM HER, YOUNG JERRY'S THE NEWEST CANDIDATE FOR THE HOLY
ESTATE. THEY DO SAY THE BRIDE ELECT STILL PLAYS WITH DOLLS. LOR,
MARY! WHAT WILL THESE INFANTS BE UP TO NEXT? ANOTHER PIECE OF NEWS
IS THAT THAT OBSTINATE OLD BRUTE IN MELBOURNE HAS GONE AND PUT ALL
POOR FINN'S BLESSED LITTLE NIPPERS TO BOARDING-SCHOOL. THAT DOES
HIT ME HARD, MARY. BUT I GET EVEN WITH HIM IN ANOTHER WAY, MY DEAR.
I'VE WON OVER THE OLD VINAIGRETTE HERE&mdash;SHE NEEDED NEW GLOBES,
ETC. FOR HER SCHOOLHOUSE&mdash;AND WE HAVE A KIND OF AGREEMENT, ALL
UNBEKNOWNST TO THE HONOURABLE, THAT THE KID TROTTY CAN COME HOME
WITH ME OF A SATURDAY AFTERNOON INSTEAD OF SPENDING THE DAY ON THE
BACKBOARD. SHE'S A NICE LITTLE KID, FULL OF LIFE, THOUGH YOUNG
ENOUGH FOR HER AGE, AND I TRY TO GIVE HER A GOOD TIME. BUT WHAT SHE
LIKES BEST IS TO MAKE BUTTER, SO I PIN AN APRON ON HER AND TURN HER
INTO THE DAIRY WITH MARTHA, AMONG THE MILK-PANS AND CHURNS. BUT LET
ME TELL YOU THIS, MY DEAR. THE HONOURABLE JOHN NEEDN'T INDULGE ANY
FOOL IDEAS ABOUT ECONOMISING IN HOUSEKEEPERS WHEN HER SCHOOLING'S
OVER&mdash;AS OLD PRUNES AND PRISMS TELLS ME. SOME ONE A GREAT DEAL
YOUNGER AND HANDSOMER THAN HIM WILL WHIP HER OFF. SHE'S MUCH TOO
PRETTY FOR THE SINGLE LIFE.</p>

<p>I THINK THAT'S ALL MY NEWS. WE HAD GREAT CHURCH FESTIFICATIONS
LATELY AND LOOK FORWARD TO MORE WHEN THE CHANCEL'S BUILT. I SAY,
THE DOCTOR HAD SOME "AUSTRALIA FELIXES," HADN'T HE? I HEAR THEY'VE
STRUCK THE REEF. BUT THIS IS A FEARFUL LONG SCRAWL, AND YET NOT
HALF SO COMFORTABLE AS EVEN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR'S GOOD YARN WOULD
BE. WHEN SHALL WE HAVE THAT AGAIN, MARY DARLING? I DON'T LOSE HOPES
FOR SOMEDAY. AND AS YOU KNOW I'VE SWORN NEVER TO CROSS THE WATER,
IT MUST MEAN THE OTHER WAY ABOUT. YES, I STILL BELIEVE I SHALL SEE
YOU BACK AGAIN: AND WHEN YOU DO COME, YOU'LL FIND YOU ARE NOT
FORGOTTEN BY YOUR DEVOTED OLD CRONY&mdash;TILLY.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-7" id="ch-2-1-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>The end of September brought day after day of soft, steamy
mists, which saturated everything with moisture, and by night fell
as a fine rain that turned low-lying parts of the garden to a bog.
Did you mount to the roads on the high level you were in the clouds
themselves; they trailed past you like smoke. There was no horizon
seaward. At a little distance from the shore the grey water became
one with a bank of vapour; the yellow cliffs vanished; suns neither
rose nor set.</p>

<p>It was exasperating weather. These eternal sea fogs, which never
a puff of wind came to chase away, seemed literally to bury you
alive. They brought out the sweat on the flagged floors and
passages of the old, old house; a crop of mould sprang up in the
corners of the dining-room; the bread mildewed in the bin. Did the
back door stand open, frogs took advantage of it to hop in and
secrete themselves; slugs squeezed through cracks and left their
silvery trail over the carpets. Mary began to fear the house would
prove but sorry winter quarters; and she had ample leisure to
indulge such reflections, the bad weather confining her almost
wholly within doors. Here was no kind friend with buggy or
shandrydan to rout her out and take her driving; and ladies did not
walk in Buddlecombe: the hilly roads were too steep, the flat roads
too muddy. So, once more, she sat and sewed, faced by the prospect
of a long, dull, lonely winter. Calls and invitations had rather
dropped off, of late...as was not unnatural...and she would have
been for seeing nothing peculiar in it, had she not connected it in
some obscure way with Richard and the practice. This had also
declined; was failing, it was plain, to live up to its early
promise.</p>

<p>She was unaware that no sooner had the "Court" reopened for the
winter than the tale&mdash;in a garbled version&mdash;of the
innovations attempted by the "new doctor's wife" had been carried
to the ears of its mistress. And Mrs. Archibald Treherne pinched a
pair of very thin lips and further arched already supercilious
eyebrows. That was all; but it was enough. And, in consequence,
from the choicest entertainments of the autumn the Mahonys found
themselves conspicuously omitted.</p>

<p>Their only personal connection with the big house was due to an
unhappy contretemps of the kind that was given to rankling for ever
after in Mahony's mind.</p>

<p>On learning of the family's arrival, both he and Mary privately
thought an exchange of courtesies would follow. Hence when one day
a footman was found to have handed in cards during Mary's
absence&mdash;his mistress keeping her seat in her carriage at the
foot of the hill&mdash;the visit did not take them by surprise.
Within the week Mary drove out in a hired vehicle to return it.</p>

<p>A bare half-hour later she was home again, looking flushed and
disturbed.</p>

<p>"Richard!...a most <i>awkward</i> thing has happened. Those
cards were not meant for us at all. It was the footman's mistake.
He ought to have left them at the next house down the
road&mdash;that little thatched cottage at the corner. They were
for a Mrs. Pigott, who's staying there."</p>

<p>"What? Well, upon my word!"</p>

<p>Leaning back in his chair Mahony stared at his wife, while he
took in the significance of her words. "And does that mean to say
the woman doesn't intend to call on you...as well?"</p>

<p>"Evidently not." Mary was crestfallen.</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i> But will call on this Mrs. Pigott?&mdash;living in
a farmer's thatched cottage?" And Mary not replying, he burst out:
"You will never, with my consent, set foot in that house
again!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I don't want to," said Mary, and sitting down untied
her bonnet-strings and threw them over her shoulders. "I don't know
<i>when</i> I've felt so uncomfortable. I was ushered into the
drawing-room&mdash;it seemed crowded with people&mdash;and there
she sat, holding our cards and looking from them to me and back
again. I heard something about 'the new doctor's wife' as I went
in. Then she asked to what she owed my visit, said she hadn't the
pleasure and so on&mdash;all in front of these other
people&mdash;the Brookes of 'Shirley' I think they were&mdash;that
retired old General...you met him once, you know, and thought him
very stuck-up. I had to explain how it had happened; I felt my face
getting as red as fire. I didn't know whether to walk out again or
what, and she didn't help me&mdash;didn't get up, or shake hands,
or anything. Fortunately a very nice person&mdash;a sort of
companion, I think &mdash;asked me to rest a little after my drive,
and I thought it would make things less awkward for everybody if I
did so; so I just sat down for a minute and said a word or two, and
then bowed and left. She came with me to the door&mdash;the
companion, I mean."</p>

<p>White with anger Mahony shuffled and re-shuffled the papers that
lay before him on the writing-table. "We've never been treated like
this in our lives before, Mary, and I for one won't put up with it!
Damn the woman and her insolence! Talk about breeding and blue
blood&mdash;give me ordinary decent feelings and a little kindness,
and you can keep the blood, thank you! I snap my fingers at it." In
imagination he saw his Mary, faced by a like predicament, doing her
utmost to smooth over the embarrassment of the moment and set the
unfortunate intruder at ease.</p>

<p>And time did not lessen his resentment. Rudeness to
Mary&mdash;such a thing had never before come within the range of
his experience&mdash;stung him, he found, almost more than rudeness
to himself. But was the thrust not actually aimed at him...through
her? What had the object of it been but to drive home to him the
galling fact that, on this side of the world, the medical
profession carried with it no standing whatever? In the colonies,
along with the Parson and the Police Magistrate, he had helped to
constitute the upper ten of a town. Here the doctor&mdash;and quite
especially the country doctor&mdash;stood little higher in the
social scale than did the vet. and the barber. Oh, those striped
poles! Tradition died so hard in this slow-thinking, slow-moving
country. Ingrained in people, not to be eradicated, was a memory of
the day when the surgeon had been but the servant, the attendant
lackey of the great house.</p>

<p>Grimly cogitating, he prepared in advance for further snubs and
slights by going about with his chin in the air, looking to the
last degree stiff and unapproachable. For, that Mary's misadventure
would remain a secret, he did not for a moment believe. There were
all too many mouths in Buddlecombe agape for gossip&mdash;it would
be threshed out over every tabby's tea-table&mdash;and those
already inclined to look down their noses at him and Mary would
have a fresh excuse for so grimacing. Anything was possible in such
a petty-minded, tittle-tattling place. Hence, it did not surprise
him to hear that Robinson had been called to the "Court." The
trouble was, of course, that the townspeople and lesser folk were
faithful in imitation of their betters; and soon it began to seem
to him that he was not occasionally, but everlastingly getting out
of Robinson's way. And as he sat at home over the fire&mdash;Mary
kept fires going to drive the damp out; though, in order to
breathe, you had to leave the windows wide open to mist and
fog&mdash;his thoughts were anything but cheerful. There was not
work enough for two &mdash;or money either. As it was, he was
having to depend more than he cared for on his Australian
dividends.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that the report reached his ears of
illness at "Toplands," where the younger son lay prostrate with
gastric fever. But his services were not requisitioned.</p>

<p>Then came that morning when Mary, grave and worried, broke the
news to him that Robinson's gig had been seen at the gates of
"Toplands"; the morning when, unable to hire a horse for his
rounds, he was tormented, as he trudged the country lanes, by the
idea that, like the last, this practice also was threatening to
peter out.</p>

<p>Late that evening as he sat reading, there came a loud
rat-tatting at the front door. The doctor in him pricked up his
ears at the now unfamiliar sound: it was like an old-time call to
action&mdash;in the land of cruel accident and sudden death. The
visitor admitted, an excited voice was heard in the passage, and
Mary's in reply; after which Mary herself entered the surgery,
shutting the door behind her and looking irresolute and
uncomfortable. The elder of the two Challoner boys had, it seemed,
come driving down post-haste from "Toplands." His brother lay
dying. Would Dr. Mahony come back with him&mdash;the dogcart was at
the door&mdash;and meet Mr. Robinson?</p>

<p>"Meet <i>Robinson?</i> Not if I know it!"</p>

<p>"I told him I couldn't be sure. But, Richard, there's nobody
else&mdash;unless he rides all the way to Brixeter. And there and
back would take him at least four hours. His brother might be dead
by then. Their mother is almost out of her mind, poor thing."</p>

<p>"Poor thing, indeed! After the way she's treated us. But you
haven't a scrap of pride in you."</p>

<p>"Not when it's a case of life or death I haven't. Dear, don't
you think you could manage to overlook what's happened?...not stand
on etiquette? If the boy should die, you'd reproach yourself
bitterly for not having gone."</p>

<p>"You never will understand these things, Mary!&mdash;and though
you live to be a hundred. Little did I dream," he said with
violence, as he slapped his book to and ungraciously rose to his
feet, "when I settled here, that I should ever come down to playing
second fiddle in this fashion."</p>

<p>"It may be your chance to play first again&mdash;if you cure
him."</p>

<p>Mahony pshawed.</p>

<p>Off he drove though, as she had known all along he would; and
did not get back till four in the morning. Then, half a glance was
enough to show her that he was in a state of extreme nervous
exasperation. So she asked only a single question: did the lad
still live? But Richard could not contain himself; and as he moved
about the bedroom, winding up his watch and letting his collar fly,
he burst out: "Nothing on earth will induce me to stop in this
place, Mary, to be insulted as I have been to-night! This is
worse&mdash;a hundred times worse!&mdash;than the colony."</p>

<p>From under her lashes Mary shot him a swift look he did not see:
a look full of motherly tenderness&mdash;and yet triumphant. Aloud
she merely said: "But think what a feather in your cap it will be,
if the boy recovers,...the prestige you will gain."</p>

<p>"Prestige? Pah! Robinson will say he did the curing, and I
stepped in and took the credit. A fat lot of prestige to be got
from that! Mary, there's been a dead set made against me
here&mdash;I've felt it now for some time, though why, I knew no
more than Adam. To-night I believe I got a clue. It's Australia if
you please!&mdash;the fact of my having practised in Australia is
against me." And at Mary's vigorously expressed disbelief: "Well!
just listen to this, my dear, and judge for yourself. First of all,
they prefer Robinson <i>fuddled</i>, to me sober. Yes, it's the
truth. When I get to 'Toplands' I find him tight&mdash;stupidly
tight&mdash;standing by the bed staring like an owl. Quite devoid
of shame he evidently is not though, for no sooner did he see me
than off he bolted&mdash;leaving me as much in the dark as ever. I
tried to get some information from the womenfolk about the earlier
stages of the complaint; but not one was capable of giving a
connected answer...I'd sent the other young fellow off for leeches
and the barber. Young Leonard lay convulsed and insensible. And
yet, if you'll believe me, Robinson had been telling them it was
gastric, and plying him with brandy. Inflammation of the membranes
of the brain, Mary!&mdash;and the fool killing him with stimulants.
While I was making mustard poultices for his feet and legs, back
comes Robinson and attempts to feel his pulse. I said: 'Now look
here, my good man, if you don't give me some particulars of this
case, I shall proceed to treat it without you.' He answered not a
word. Then I turned to her. 'Now, madam,' said I, 'I'm not going to
stand this. Either he or I must leave the room&mdash;or indeed the
house&mdash;and, until you decide which, I go downstairs.' She
followed, all but clawing at my coat. He lurches after us, shouting
abuse...for the whole house to hear. And what, pray, do you think
he said?...amongst other scurrilous trash. 'Very well, if you
prefer the opinion of this old quack to mine, take it and abide by
the consequences. Australia! We all knows what <i>that</i> means.
Ask him what other trades he's plied there. Make him turn out his
credentials.' It was as much as I could do to keep from knocking
him down. Only the thought of the lad upstairs restrained me.
<i>She</i> was very humble and apologetic, of course; besought me
to take no notice; almost grovelled to me to save her son, etc.
etc. I made short work of her, though."</p>

<p>"Besides, you can surely afford to smile at such nonsense,
Richard?" Mary strove to soothe him. "It would be beneath your
dignity to notice it. Especially as he wasn't himself." Distressed
though she felt at this return for Richard's kindness, Mary was
also unpleasantly worked on by his interlarded "My good man!" and
the general hoity-toity air of his narration. What a peppery fellow
he was! How could he ever expect to succeed and be popular? That
kind of tone would not go down here.</p>

<p>"I make allowance for his condition...of course I do...but all
the same it does not incline me, my dear...If such are the tales
that are going the round about me, Mary&mdash;charlatan and quack,
a colonial ne'er-do-well trading on a faked diploma and so on; if
it's a blot on my reputation to have lived and practised in the
colonies, instead of mouldering my life away in this miserable
village &mdash;then much is explained that has been dark to me.
Anyhow, it came over me with a rush to-night: I go from here. They
don't want me; I'm not good enough for them&mdash;a man who has
held a first-class practice in the second city of Victoria not good
enough for the torpid livers of Buddlecombe! Very well, let them
get some one else...I'm done with 'em. Really, Mary, I sometimes
feel so sick and tired of the struggle that I fancy throwing up
medicine altogether. What would you say, love, to taking a small
cottage somewhere and living modestly on the little we have?"</p>

<p>Now what <i>would</i> he say next? wondered Mary with an inward
sigh. But the present was not the moment to combat such vagaries.
Richard was sore and smarting; and in this mood he just tossed off
suggestions without thinking; letting his anger out in them as the
hole in the lid of a kettle lets out steam. So she only said: "Let
us first see what happens here. Is there any chance of Lenny
Challoner recovering?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, I don't think there is. I give him till the coming
midnight. He'll probably die between then and dawn."</p>

<p>But this prediction was not fulfilled. The boy weathered the
night; and after sixty hours' unconsciousness spoke to those about
him, though with wandering wits.</p>

<p>Buddlecombe was all a-twitter and agog: the affair was discussed
over counters by tradesmen and goodwives; at mahogany
dinner-tables; in the oaken settles of inns. Every one knew to a T
everything that had happened...and a good deal more: were for and
against the two doctors in their feud. "'Tis a'anyway little
better'n boo'tchers a hoald t'lot of un," thus Raby, the town
crier, summed up the matter to his cronies of the "Buddlecombe
Arms." "Bu'ut if us was ca'alves, 'tis the ha'and us knows as us
'ud ra'ather die by."</p>

<p>Yes, chiefly against him, felt Mahony: and it screwed him stiff
as a rod. The majority sided with the townsman who had lived among
them for years; who was rich enough to spend freely in their shops,
subscribe heavily to their charities; besides being an expert in
the right admixture of joviality and reserve necessary to make his
failings go down.</p>

<p>Mary fought this idea with all her might. Richard was just
reading his own feelings into other people, as usual. She herself
clung to the belief that the sick boy would pull through, now he
had held out so long. Which would be a veritable triumph for
Richard. If only he did not spoil things by his uncompromising
behaviour! For he was in a most relentless frame of mind. More than
one of Robinson's patients subsequently sent for him. But he,
riding the high horse, declined to touch a single other of the
enemy's cases. They should apply for relief, said he, to Mr. Jakes
of Brixeter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, of course, he did not spare himself over the patient
he had taken in hand. But eventually, in spite of his care, the boy
died, killing Mary's hopes, and enabling Robinson to go about
cockahoop, boasting that wrong treatment had finished him off. It
<i>had</i> been "gastric," after all!</p>

<p>And now, as he stalked his way or drove his gig about the hilly
roads and narrow streets, Mahony felt himself indeed a marked
man.</p>

<p>"Till Christmas...not a day longer! I was never built for this."
And as he said it, his thoughts flew back to a time when the merest
hint that his skill was doubted had shaken his roots to their
depths. Here, where he had as yet hardly put out a sucker, the
wrench was easier, and at the same time a hundredfold more
destructive.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-8" id="ch-2-1-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>But before Christmas came, Mary's hope that things would somehow
right themselves burned up anew&mdash;if hope that could be called
which ran so counter to her own inclinations, and to the possible
issue she now thought she descried.</p>

<p>With the onset of November it was the turn of "Buddlecombe Hall"
to reopen. And now a wave of new life seemed to run through the
sluggish little town. The Saxeby-Corbetts, returning, as it were
took possession of the place; and they had this advantage over the
Trehernes&mdash;a childless couple&mdash;that they counted a
baker's dozen in family all told. Their arrival was after the
fashion of crowned heads. First came dragloads of servants, male
and female, and of varying ages&mdash;from the silver-headed butler
down to young scullery and laundry-maids&mdash;after which the
windows of the great house were flung up, the chimneys belched
smoke, hammerings and beatings resounded; while various elderly
women in the town tied on rusty black and went off to give
obsequious aid. Footmen in livery lounged about the inns; grooms
rode swathed horses out to exercise. The tradespeople wellnigh lost
their wits with excitement. One heard of nothing, now, on entering
a shop, but "the family," its needs and preferences.</p>

<p>"I've never seen anything to equal it!" cried Mahony
exasperated. "The way these poor creatures burn to prostrate
themselves."</p>

<p>The list of young people would not be full till the holidays
began; but donkey and pony-carts were met with containing the
smaller children, their attendant governesses and nursemaids. The
squire himself, a ruddy-faced man in early middle age, mounted on a
fine chestnut, might be observed confabbing with the farmers; and
lastly came his lady, driving herself in a low chaise: a
bony-jawed, high-nosed woman, whose skin told of careless exposure
to all weathers. Dressed anyhow, too, said Mary, who had once seen
her in the town with an old garden-hat perched on her head, a red
flannel spencer thrown over her bodice.</p>

<p>And now, at the sound of wheels, grocer and butcher would prick
up their ears and pop from their respective doors, merely on the
off chance of pulling their forelocks, and (as likely as not)
receiving in return a snub from the lady of the "Hall." For in
spite of what Mahony called their "piteous desire" to please, she
was never satisfied, and hurled at their heads, in vigorous
language, her frank opinion of their wares.</p>

<p>"Now, Johnson, this will not do! That last meat you supplied to
the servants hall was tough as my boot. If the next is no better, I
shall come and superintend the slaughtering myself. It's my belief,
my man, you don't know a heifer from a leather-gutted
milch-cow!"</p>

<p>And Johnson, doubled in two with relish of her "ladyship's"
joke, could be heard right down the street vowing there should be
no further ground for complaint; though a visit from her "ladyship"
to his humble establishment would at any time be reckoned as an
honour&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p>To mark his disapproval of this fawning, and for fear any hint
of patronage or condescension might come his way, Mahony had all
his armour on, all his spines out, when he was unexpectedly
summoned to the "Hall" to attend one of the children, sick of a
feverish cold. Mary saw him go, with many misgivings; but it
actually seemed as if, for once, his lordly manner went down. By
his own account he successfully faced the imperious dame: "Who, if
you please, was for herself pronouncing on the ailment&mdash;it
turns out to be chicken-pox&mdash;and had nurses and maids dancing
like puppets to a string. I soon let her see that kind of thing
wouldn't do with me, Mary. And she took the hint fast enough,
changed her tone, and behaved like any other decently bred
woman.&mdash;I had certainly rather though," he added, "have her
for a friend than an enemy."</p>

<p>Oh, if this could only be, thought Mary. It might alter
everything. And it was here, with him daily at the "Hall," where
the nursery in a body succumbed to the pox, that her confidence
bloomed anew. For in a way Richard even became a kind of protege of
its mistress: she would keep him, after his professional visit was
paid, to chat about the colonies and hear his impressions of
England. Even Mary herself received a call, and though it was one
of a somewhat quizzing inspection and Madam was "not at home" when
she returned it, yet Richard was pleased, which was the main thing.
He himself was twice bidden to dinner&mdash;a little informal
dinner, at which only another man or two was present; a state of
things that seemed to mark as true the report that the dame had
small liking for the company of her own sex.</p>

<p>Yes, Richard's fortunes seemed at last to have taken a definite
turn for the better, when of a sudden the blow fell which put an
end to hopes and fears alike. What was behind it Mary did not know,
and never learned. But one morning at breakfast he blurted out in
summary fashion that he had resolved, overnight, to shake the dust
of Buddlecombe off his feet. And before she had recovered from the
shock of this announcement, the house was up for sale, and she hard
at work sorting and packing. Coming as it did on top of her renewed
confidence, the decision hit Mary hard. It also gave a further push
to her tottering faith in Richard's judgment. Of course, it was
clear something unpleasant had happened at the last dinner-party.
But she could get nothing out of Richard&mdash;absolutely
nothing&mdash;except that he was done "for all eternity" with place
and people. In vain she reasoned, argued, pleaded...and even lost
her temper. He remained obstinately silent, leaving her to her own
conjectures&mdash;which led nowhere. Leicester?...well, compared
with this, his bolting from Leicester had been as easy to
understand as A B C&mdash;an ugly town with no practice worth
speaking of, and the little there was, of the wrong kind. But here
where she had thought his first irate "Till Christmas!" was
gradually being overlaid; here she could only put his abrupt
determination down to one of his most freakish and wayward
impulses.</p>

<p>Mahony saw her trouble; saw, too, how rudely her trust in him
was shaken. But he did not enlighten her&mdash;he would rather have
cut his tongue out. For what had happened concerned Mary first of
all; and though there was a chance she might have taken it less
tragically than he&mdash;in real "Mary-ish" fashion&mdash;yet he
felt as averse to bringing the words over his lips as to letting
her see how deeply it had mortified him.</p>

<p>Another informal invitation to dine at the "Hall" had reached
him&mdash;at least, he took it to be such, since Mary was not
included. At the entrance to the great house, however&mdash;six
o'clock of a frosty December evening&mdash;he ran into old Barker,
a retired Anglo-Indian, just dismounting from his hired fly; and to
his amazement saw that, this time, Barker had his ladies with him.
Becoming involved in their entrance, he was waiting with the
Colonel for wife and daughters to rejoin them, when the old
valetudinarian found that he had left his jujubes in the pocket of
his greatcoat. Standing thus alone, close to the half-open
drawing-room door, Mahony suddenly heard his own name spoken and in
the harsh, grating voice of their hostess.&mdash;"Yes, from the
colonies. I can tell you I <i>was</i> put out, when I came back and
found what had happened. I wrote off at once to that sheep, young
Philips, and gave him a sound rating for letting himself be
frightened away, after the trouble I had been to, to get him here."
At this a gentler voice murmured a query; to which the answer rang
shrill and dear: "Oh, well, <i>he</i> is quite presentable!"</p>

<p>This it was that stuck in Mahony's throat. And on getting home
shortly after midnight he did not go down the passage to the
bedroom, but turned into the surgery, which faced the hall-door. No
sound came from Mary; she was evidently asleep.</p>

<p>He did not strike a match: feeling his way to the window, he
raised the blind and leaned his forehead on the glass. The sea lay
still and black as ink, under a starlit sky&mdash;as starlight went
here. Presently the moon, now entered on her last quarter, would
come up from behind the diffs and throw a lurid light&mdash;lurid,
because the light of decay&mdash;over the cold sea and sleeping
town, picking out the line of silvery shingle that edged the beach,
and making the odd old curved breakwater look as though it were
built of marble.</p>

<p>He had been at white heat all the evening. Again and again amid
the desultory talk, both at the dinner-table and afterwards in the
drawing-room, the rasping voice had rung in his ears: "<i>He</i> is
quite presentable!"&mdash;while he could imagine, though he had not
seen, the impudent shrug that accompanied the stressing of the
pronoun. Thus wantonly did mortals glance at, sum up and dismiss
one another. The jar to his pride was a rude one. For, ingrained in
him, and not to be eradicated was the conviction that he was
gentleman first, doctor second: slights might be aimed at his
profession, but not at him in person.&mdash;And yet, in comparison,
the patronising "presentable" affixed to himself left him cold. It
was the sneer at Mary that stung him to the quick. That was
something he would never be able either to forget or forgive. Did
he contemplate this great heart, full to the brim of charity, of
human kindness; this mine of generous impulse; this swift begetter
of excuse and explanation for everything in others that was not as
fair and honest as in himself; did he consider that, to assist in
their need any of these purblind souls who sat so lightly in
judgment on her, she would have stripped the clothing from her
back: then he burned with a wrath too deep for words. He did not
know one of them worthy to tie up her shoe-lace. And yet, such a
worm for truth existed in him, so plaguy an instinct to get to the
root of a matter, that even as he burned, he found himself looking
Mary up and down, viewing her from every angle, and with a purely
objective eye. He saw her at home, in church, in the company of
others; saw her gestures, her movements, her smile; heard her
laughter, the tones of her voice and her way of speaking: all
these, for the first time, as things for themselves, detached from
the true, sound core of her. And as he did so, he was forced to own
that, in a way, these people were justified of their criticism: she
<i>was</i> different. But not as they meant it. Her manner had a
naturalness, her gestures a spontaneity, which formed only too
happy a contrast to their ruled and measured restraint. Indeed as
he studied her, it began to seem to him that into all Mary did or
said there had crept something large and free&mdash;a dash of the
spaciousness belonging to the country that had become her true
home. She needed elbow-room. Her voice was deeper, fuller, more
resonant than theirs; she fixed a straight, simple gaze on people
and things; walked with a freer step, was franker in her speech,
readier with her tongue; she stood up to members of the other sex
as women emphatically did <i>not</i> do here, an they did not
belong to the class of "Madam of the Hall." No connection between
Mary and the pursed-up mouth, the downcast, unroving, unintelligent
eye, the hands primly folded at the waist, the short, sedate steps,
of the professing English lady. For that, the net of her experience
had been too widely cast. She had rubbed shoulders with all sorts;
had been unable to afford the "lady's" privilege of shutting an eye
to evil or wrong-doing and pretending it did not exist. And if, in
the process, she had come to be a shade too downright in her
opinions, too blunt for the make-believe of antique
conventions...well, he thought he might safely leave it to Him who
had broken bread with publicans and sinners, to adjudge which was
the worthier attitude of the two.</p>

<p>Thus he reasoned; but ever and again his mind veered back to the
personal thrust. Mary vulgar!...Mary, of whom he had felt so fondly
proud, having grown to middle age hearing on all sides that she had
not her equal in those attributes that make a woman blessed. "Out
there" he had seen her courted, made much of; none had approached
her in popularity. And from this happy state he had torn her
away...for what? For the privilege of being looked down on as not
quite a lady...had uprooted her from the country she loved best and
fitted best into, to make her a stranger on the face of the earth.
So much for Mary. But did he himself feel any more at home here
than she? Not a bit of it! Nor had he been a jot apter at adjusting
himself. They stood out, the pair of them, like over-large figures
on a miniature background. The truth was they had lost the knack of
running in a groove: life, in its passage, had hammered them out
into citizens of the world. So that, by now, an indelible stamp was
on them. And, with this as their dower, cured for ever of an
excessive insularity, they had come back to find an England that
had not budged by an inch; where people's outlook, habits, opinions
were just what they had always been &mdash;inelastic, uninspired.
Worse, these islanders seemed to preen themselves on their very
rigidity, their narrow-mindedness, their ignorance of any life or
country but their own; waving aside with an elegant flutter of the
hand, everything of which they themselves had no cognisance. And
into this closed circle he and Mary&mdash;especially Mary&mdash;had
come blundering, trampling on prejudice, surrounded by an aura of
adventure...and unsuccessful adventure at that! Was it indeed any
wonder they found themselves outside the pale?</p>

<p>Well, this ended it. He could not picture himself going on
living there with a nervous eye eternally cocked at Mary to see how
she was comporting herself, or how what she did struck the wretched
group of snobs he had been fool enough to dump her down amongst;
the while he winced at idiosyncrasies he yet grudged to admit. No,
the wider the distance he could put between himself and Buddlecombe
the better he would be pleased. But where to go?...what next? Back
to some sordid manufacturing town, with its black mud and slippery
cobble-stones, to act as medical adviser to a handful of grooms and
servant girls? Or to another village to see exclusive country-folk
turn up their noses at your wife, and watch the practice in which
you had invested your hard-earned hundreds melting away, filched by
one whose chief merit was never having been out of England? Not if
he knew it!&mdash;There now remained only London to
consider&mdash;Mary would no doubt harp anew on the openings to be
found there. But at the mere thought of London he shrank into
himself, as he had shrunk under his first physical impression of
it. What he had then suspected he now felt sure of. Great cities
were not for him: he was too old to stand the strain of their wear
and tear. And therewith the list of possibilities on this side of
the globe was exhausted. Would he had stayed on the other! CIVIS
BRITANNICUS SUM&mdash;that knowledge should have been enough for
him. Instead of which, burning to prove his citizenship, he had
chased back, with, in his heart, the pent-up feelings of his long,
long absence. He laughed did he now recall the exultation with
which he had descried the outlines of the English coast. "Out
there," he had seen this old country through the rose-red
spectacles of youthful memory. Now he knew that the thrill he had
experienced on again beholding it&mdash;his pleasure in its radiant
greenness&mdash;was the sum total of the satisfaction he would ever
get from it. No sooner ashore&mdash;and not even Mary had fathomed
his passionate desire to stand well here&mdash;than he had felt
himself outsider and alien. England had no welcome for her homing
sons, or any need of them: their places were long since filled.</p>

<p>But stay! let him be frank with himself. Had he liked the
motherland any better than it liked him? He had not. Indeed his
feelings were a great deal more active than any want of liking. He
hated it&mdash;yes! hate was not too strong a word&mdash;and had
done, from the first moment of landing. His attempt at
transplanting himself had been a sad and sorry failure. Returning
full of honours and repute, he found that the mere fact of his
having lived and practised in Australia cast a slur on his good
name. Again, he had come back on what he believed to be but the
threshold of middle age&mdash;and without being greatly troubled by
it; for, "out there," men of his own years had kept pace, gone
along with him&mdash;and everywhere had been made to feel himself
well over his prime, if not indeed&mdash;thanks to Australian
pallor and wrinkles&mdash;an old man: one of those broken-down
adventurers who limp home, at long last, to eke out the remainder
of a wasted life.</p>

<p>But what next?&mdash;what in all the world next? To this
question he could find no answer. Nor was he helped by staring at
the sea, or the golden, lemon-shaped moon that now came up on its
back from behind the dark mass of the cliffs. The purchase of a
third practice was beyond him: if he went from here he went
empty-handed. Possibly he might get for the house what he had given
for it&mdash;though he had discovered that it was both damp and in
need of repair&mdash;but this sum would not suffice to set him up
anew. No, the outlook was darker than, a moment before, the night
had been; no moon rose for him. And he lay long wakeful, grappling
in a cold sweat with the many small practical details of the
break&mdash;details which it is so easy to overlook in the taking
of sweeping decisions, yet which afterwards rise up like
mountains&mdash;and following the square of silver that flooded in
through the uncurtained window, and slowly moved across the bed on
its passage from wall to wall. With the glimmer of the material
dawn, however&mdash;red behind those cliffs that had delivered up
the moon, great Jupiter hanging like a globe of silver above
them&mdash;there came to him, too, the dawning of a possible
solution. But at the first hint of it he flung restlessly over on
his side, unable to bear its weight. A bolder hand than his was
needed, to sweep away the cobwebs of prejudice and nervous aversion
in which he had spun himself. It took Mary to do it; and she did;
though not till she had talked herself hoarse in an attempt to make
him see reason, begging him to hold the field and show fight; till
her head swam with listening to his monotonous: "What now? Where
can I go?" Then, abruptly determined, she cut the knot by facing
him and answering squarely: "Why, home again!"&mdash;words which
first made Mahony wince, then snort with contempt. But he had no
other suggestion to offer&mdash;or none but the fatuous one Mary
had already smiled at, that, he having given up practice, they
should retire to some tiny cottage, do without domestic help, see
no company, and live on the slender sum that came to them from
Australia. "I think we could be very happy and content, love,
living so&mdash;just you and I." If a soul can be said to laugh,
then, in spite of her trouble, Mary's soul rocked with laughter at
this fresh sample of Richard's fantasy. Oh, was there ever such an
unpractical old dreamer?...such an inability to see things as they
were. No doubt he pictured a show cottage, wreathed in roses and
honeysuckle, where they would pass idyllic days. The slow
death-in-life of such an existence, the reaction of his haughty
pride against the social position&mdash;or want of
position&mdash;that would be forced upon them, was hidden from him.
Perhaps mercifully hidden...and Mary sighed.</p>

<p>But she did not falter...either at his first disdainful sniff,
or, later on, when his eyes came stealing back to hers; came tamed,
all the scorn gone out of them. "Only do not call it home," was his
unspoken request. Short of a miracle that name would never, he
believed, cross his lips again. No place could now be "home" to him
as long as he lived. He was once more an outcast and a wanderer;
must go back in humiliation to the land that had eaten up his
prime, and there make the best of the years that were left him.</p>

<p>As time wore on, however, and their preparations for departure
advanced; as, too, the prospect of a change of scene hoisted its
pirate flag again, this sense of bitterness subsided; the acute
ache turned to a dull pain that was almost a relief. And worked on
by this, as by the joy which, for all her anxieties, Mary could not
quite conceal, the relief also imperceptibly changed its character,
and grew to be a warm spot in his heart.</p>

<p>And one evening, when the supper dishes had been pushed aside to
make room for Mary's desk&mdash;she was methodically noting the
contents of a tin trunk&mdash;Mahony in watching her and thinking
how the frequent coughs and colds she had suffered from, since
landing in England, had thinned her down, spoke his thought aloud.
"Well, love, whatever happens, you at least will grow fat and well
again, and be the healthy woman you always were."</p>

<p>"Now don't start to worry about me. I'm all right," said Mary.
"It takes time to get used to a strange climate." She entered a few
more items in her clean, pointed writing, then laid her pen down
and put her chin on her hand. "The thing I like to think of,
Richard, is how soon I shall be seeing them all again&mdash;Ned and
Jerry and Tilly, and the dear children. I can hardly believe it. I
<i>have</i> missed them so."</p>

<p>"Poor little wife! And shall I tell you what I dwell most on?
'Pon my soul, Mary, it's of getting my teeth into a really sweet
apple again&mdash;instead of a specimen that's red on one side
only. I believe England will stick in my mind, for the rest of my
days, as the land where the fruit doesn't ripen."</p>

<p>"And yet costs so much to buy."</p>

<p>"And if I know you, my dear, it's the Abernethy biscuit and thin
lemon-water you won't forget. Well, well, madam! you'll soon be
able to pamper your guests once more to your heart's content."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But I shall at least see who it is Jerry thinks of
marrying."</p>

<p>"See?...yes. But don't hug the belief you'll be able to
influence him in his choice."</p>

<p>"I may not want to. And then there's Johnny to try and find out
about, poor boy, and to keep Zara from making a goose of herself.
Oh! now that we're going home, I feel how dreadfully cut off from
them all I have been here."</p>

<p>"And they'll every one hail you joyfully, my dear, rest assured
of that!...be literally foaming with impatience to make use of you
again. I should only like to know how they've got on without you."
Mahony had risen from his chair and was standing on the hearthrug
with his back to the fire. Having meditatively warmed his
coat-tails for a moment he added: "There's another thing, Polly, I
don't mind telling you I look forward to, and that is seeing a real
sunrise and sunset again. On this side of the world...well, as
often as not the sun seems just to slip in or out of a bank of
clouds. There's none of that sense of a coming miracle...that
uplifting effect of space...or splendour of colouring. Why, I've
still in my memory evenings when half the field of the sky was one
pink flush&mdash;with a silver star twinkling through&mdash;or a
stretch of unreal green deepening into yellow &mdash;or mauve...And
the idea has come to me that it must have been from glories of this
kind that the old Greek scribe drew his picture of the New
Jerusalem...Yes, I must say, things here&mdash;colouring,
landscape, horizon&mdash;have all seemed very dull and
cramped...like the souls of the people themselves."</p>

<p>Again he fell into thought. Then warmed by these confidences,
went further. "Mary, love, let me confess it: I realise what a sad
fool I've made of myself over this whole business. My ever leaving
Ballarat was a fatal mistake. If I'd only had the sense to take
your advice! I was run down&mdash;at the end of my
tether&mdash;from years of overwork. A twelve-month out of harness
would have set me right again: a voyage to this side; fresh
surroundings and associations&mdash;and no need to stint with the
money either, for we should now have been going back to our old
ample income. Instead of having to face another start on as good as
nothing...eat humble pie before them all, too. For they will
certainly grasp what has happened.&mdash;No, I can see it now; I
was too old for such a drastic break. One's habits stiffen with
one's joints. You've noticed I've been hurt by people here implying
I'm out-of-date, old-fashioned&mdash;good enough for the colonies
but not for the home-country&mdash;but, upon my word, Mary, I don't
know if there isn't some truth in it. I stopped too long in the one
place, my dear; with the result that I ought to have stopped there
altogether.&mdash;Well, well!...there's only this about it: fiasco
though it has proved, it has not hit me as hard as it might have
done, considering the exaggerated expectations I came home with.
Which in itself is enough to show me age is rendering me
indifferent. Actually, my dear, I believe much of the sting is
taken from what has happened by the sight of your satisfaction at
returning. Never should I have brought you here&mdash;never! I
thought to find myself among a different set of people altogether.
In memory, I confused good breeding with tact and kindliness.
Whereas, now, if it comes to a choice between blue blood and inborn
goodness of heart, then what I say is: give me nature's gentlefolk
all the time. There's as little likeness between them as between
this eternal clammy drizzle and some of those cloudless winter days
we knew on the Flat."</p>

<p>"Richard! Don't forget how you hated the climate there. And how
poorly the sun made you feel."</p>

<p>"Nor do I. And in spite of the mizzle, and damp, and want of
sun, I've thriven in this country. But one can't live on climate
alone. And when I let my mind dwell on the way
I&mdash;we&mdash;have been treated here; the stodgy lack of
goodwill...animosity even...the backbiting and gossip, I tell you
this, love: there's but one person I shall regret when I leave; one
only of whom I shall carry away a warm remembrance; and that's, as
you know, your dear old mother. But can you guess why? Upon my
word, I believe it's because there's something in her
warm-heartedness and generosity, her overflowing hospitality, that
reminds me of the people we lived among so long."</p>

<p>"Well! it's late...we must to bed," he went on, after a silence
which Mary did not break, there seeming really nothing left for her
to say. "I've no plans, my dear, nor have I at present the spirit
to make any. It seems best at this moment to leave the future in
the laps of the gods. I know this much though: I'm cured of
castle-building for ever."</p>

<p>Mary nodded and acquiesced; or at least again said nothing; and
she kept to this attitude in the weeks that followed, when, as was
only natural, Richard's mind, far too active and uneasy to rest,
began to play round the plans he <i>might</i> have made, had he not
forsworn the habit. These included settling somewhere by the sea;
either near Melbourne or at one of the watering-places on the
Bay&mdash;Dromana or Schnapper Point. Mary let him talk. She
herself was persuaded that the only rational thing for him to do
was to return to Ballarat. It was of no use his riding the high
horse: feelings of pique and pride must yield to practical
considerations. He was known from one end of Ballarat to the other;
and the broken threads could there be picked up more swiftly and
with greater ease than anywhere else. It would, of course, no
longer be a case of Webster Street&mdash;unless the doctor to whom
he had sold the practice had failed, or proved otherwise
unsatisfactory. But Richard would find room somewhere; even if it
had to be on the Redan, or at Sebastopol, or out at Buninyong. And
though he could now never hope to occupy the position he had
wilfully abandoned&mdash;oh, the unspeakable folly of
man!&mdash;never hope to give up general practice for that of
consultant or specialist, yet with care something might still be
saved from the wreck of the past. And nursing these schemes, Mary
set her lips and frowned with determination. Never again in the
years to come, should he be able to say he repented not having
taken her advice. This time she would set her will through, cost
what it might.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-2-2-0" id="ch-2-2-0"></a>Part II</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-1" id="ch-2-2-1"></a>Chapter I</h3>

<p>The good ship <i>Florabella</i>, eighty-four days out from
Liverpool, made the Australian coast early one spring morning; and
therewith the faint, new, spicy smell of land wafted across the
water.</p>

<p>Coming up from below to catch a whiff of it, her passengers
blinked dazzled eyes at the gaudy brilliancy of light and
colouring. Here were no frail tints and misty trimmings; everything
stood out hard, clear, emphatic. The water was a crude sapphire;
the surf that frothed on the reefs white as milk. As for the sky,
Mahony declared it made him think of a Reckitt's bluebag; while a
single strip of pearly cloud to the east looked fixed,
immovable&mdash;solid as those clouds on which, in old paintings,
cherubs perch or lean.</p>

<p>Outside the "Rip" the vessel hove to, to take up the pilot; and
every neck was craned to watch his arrival; for with him would come
letters and news&mdash;the first to reach the travellers since
their departure from England. Hungrily was the unsealing of the
mail-bag awaited.</p>

<p>Mary's lap would hardly hold the envelopes that bore her name.
They were carried to her by the grizzled old Captain himself, who
dealt them out, one by one, cracking a joke to each. Mary laughed;
but at the same time felt a touch of embarrassment. For her to
receive so large a share of the good things&mdash;under the very
noses, too, of those unfortunates who got none&mdash;seemed not in
the best of taste. So, the tale told, she retired with her budget
to the cabin; and Mahony, having seen her below, went back to read
his own correspondence on deck.</p>

<p>But she had done no more than finish John's note of welcome and
break the seal of Tilly's, when a foot came bounding through the
saloon, off which the cabin opened, and there was Richard
again&mdash;Richard with rumpled hair, eyes alight, red of face,
looking for all the world like a rowdy schoolboy. Seizing her by
the hands he pulled her to her feet, and would have twirled her
round. But Mary, her letters strewing the floor,
protested&mdash;stood firm.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the matter?"</p>

<p>"Mary! Wife! Here's news for us!...here's news. A letter
from&mdash;" and he flourished a sheet of paper at her. "I give you
three guesses, love. But nonsense!&mdash;you couldn't...not if you
guessed till Doomsday. No more pinching and scraping for us, Mary!
No more underpaid drudgery for me! My fortune's made. I am a rich
man...at last!"</p>

<p>"Richard dear! What is it now?"</p>

<p>Mary spoke in the lightly damping tone which Mahony was wont to
grumble she reserved for him alone. But to-day it passed
unnoticed.</p>

<p>"Here you are, madam&mdash;read for yourself!" and he pushed a
crumpled letter into her hand. "It's those <i>Australia Felixes</i>
we have to thank for it. What a glorious piece of luck, Mary, that
I should have stuck to them and gone on paying their wretched
calls, when every one else let them lapse in despair. John will be
green with envy. And this is only the beginning, my dear. There's
no telling what they'll do when they get the new plant in&mdash;old
Simmonds says so himself, and he's not given to superlatives as you
know.&mdash;Yes, it's good-bye to poverty!"&mdash;and forgetting in
his excitement where he was, Mahony flung round to pace the floor.
Baulked by the narrow wall of the cabin, he had just to turn to the
right-about. "It means I can now pick and choose, Mary&mdash;put up
my plate in Collins Street East&mdash;hold my head as high as the
best."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, how glad I am!...for your sake." The tears sprang to
Mary's eyes; she had openly to wipe them away. "But it's so sudden.
I can hardly believe it. Are you sure it's <i>really</i> true?" And
now she stroked the page smooth, to read for herself.</p>

<p>"You for my sake...I for yours! What haven't you had to put up
with, my poor love, through being tied to a rolling old stone like
me? But now, I promise you, everything will be different. There's
nothing you shall not have, my Mary&mdash;nothing will be too good
for you. You shall ride in your own carriage&mdash;keep half a
dozen servants. And when once you are free of worries and troubles
you'll grow fat and rosy again, and all these little lines on your
forehead will disappear."</p>

<p>"And perhaps you won't dislike the colony so much...and the
people...if you can feel independent of them," said Mary hopefully.
Could he have promised her from this day forth a tranquil and
contented mind, it would have been the best gift of any.</p>

<p>When he had danced out&mdash;danced was the word that occurred
to her to describe the new spring in his step, which seemed
intolerant of the floor&mdash;had gone to consult the steward about
the purchase of a special brand of champagne, which that worthy was
understood to hold in store for an occasion such as this: when Mary
sat down to collect her wits, she indulged in a private reflection
which neither then nor later did she share with Richard. It ran:
"Oh, how thankful I am we didn't get the letter till we were safely
away from that...from England. Or he might have taken it into his
head to stop there."</p>

<p>Mahony felt the need of being alone, and sought out a quiet spot
to windward where he was likely to be undisturbed. But news of the
turn of his fortunes had run like wildfire through the ship,
started by the steward, to whom in the first flush he had
garrulously communicated it. And now came one after another of his
fellow-passengers to wring his hand and wish him joy. It was well
meant; he could not but answer in kind. But then they, too, had
changed. From mere nondescripts and undesirables they were
metamorphosed into kindly, hearty folk, generous enough, it seemed,
to feel almost as elated at a fellow-mortal's good luck as if it
were their own. His hedge of spines went down: he turned frank,
affable, easy of approach; though any remaining standoffishness was
like to have been forgiven him, who at a stroke had become one of
the wealthiest men on board.</p>

<p>He could see these simple souls thought he took his windfall
very coolly. Well!...in a way he did. Just for the moment he had
been carried off his feet&mdash;as indeed who could fail to be,
when by a single lucky chance, one spin of fate's wheel, all that
had become his which half a lifetime's toil had failed to give him?
Yet ingrained in him was so lively a relish, so poignant a need for
money and the ease of mind money would bring, that the stilling of
the want had something almost natural about it&mdash;resembled the
payment of an overdue debt. Yes, affluence would fit him like a
second skin. The beggardom of early days, the push and scramble for
an income of later life&mdash;these had been the travesty.</p>

<p>Next came a sense of relief&mdash;relief unspeakable. Alone by
now in his windy corner, he could afford to let his eyes grow
moist; and the finger he passed round inside his collar trembled.
From what a nightmare of black care, a horde of petty anxieties,
did the miracle of this day not set him free! To take but a single
instance: the prospect of having to explain away his undignified
return to the colony had cost him many a night's sleep. Now he was
the master of circumstance, not its playball. And into the delights
of this sensation he plunged as into a magic water; laved in it,
swam, went under; and emerged a new man. The crust of indifference,
the insidious tiredness, the ennui that comes of knowing the end of
a thing before you have well begun it, and knowing it not worth
while: all such marks of advancing age fell away. Youthfully he
squared his shoulders; he was ready to live again, and with zest.
And under the influence of this revival there stirred in him, for
the first time, a more gracious feeling for the land towards which
he was heading. What he had undergone there in his day, none but
himself knew; but, if his sufferings had been great, great, too,
was the atonement now made him. Indeed the bigness of the reward
had in it something of the country's own immensity&mdash;its
far-flung horizons.</p>

<p>"And perhaps, after all...who knows, who knows!...I myself...the
worm that was in me...that ceaseless hankering for&mdash;why,
happiness, of course...the goal of man's every venture...the belief
in one's <i>right</i> to it...the fixed idea that it must be
waiting for one somewhere...remains but to go in search of it. So,
it is not conceivable...thus made wiser...all fear for the future
stilled, too&mdash;<i>how</i> fear lames and
deadens!&mdash;independent, now...beholden to nobody"&mdash;such
were some of the loose tags of thought that drifted through his
brain.</p>

<p>Till one or other touched a secret spring, and straightway he
was launched again on those dreams and schemes with which he
believed his last unhappy experience had for ever put him out of
conceit. Oh, the house he would build!...the grounds he would lay
out...the books he would buy...and buy...till he had a substantial
library of his own. All the rare and pretty things that should be
Mary's. The gifts they would make her dear old mother. The
competency that should rescue his own people from their obscure
indigence. The deserving strugglers to whom he would lend a hand.
Even individuals he disliked or was fretted by&mdash;Zara, Ned,
Ned's encumbrances&mdash;sipped from his overflow. Indeed he
actually caught himself thinking of people &mdash;poor devils,
mostly&mdash;who had done him a bad turn, and of how he could now
requite them.</p>

<p>Over these imaginings the hours flew by&mdash;hours not divided
off each from the next, but fusing to form one single golden day:
of a kind that does not come twice in a lifetime. Meanwhile the
vessel was well advanced up the great Bay, and familiar landmarks
began to rise into view. He had sometimes wondered, on the voyage
out, what his feelings would be, when he saw these familiar places
again and knew that the pincer of the "Heads" had snapped behind
him. Now, he contemplated them with a vacant eye; did not take up
the thread of a personal relationship. Or once only: at sight of a
bare old clump of hills behind Geelong. Then he impulsively went
below to fetch Mary&mdash;Mary was packing the cabin furniture,
sewing up mattresses in the floor-carpeting, the mirror in the
blankets&mdash;and she, good-naturedly rising from her knees, for
to-day she had not the heart to refuse him anything, tied on her
bonnet and accompanied him on deck. There, standing arm-in-arm,
they thought and spoke of a certain unforgettable evening, now
years deep in the past.</p>

<p>"What greenhorns we were then, love, to be sure! So mercifully
ignorant of all the ups and downs in store for us."&mdash;But his
tone was light, even merry; for to-day the ups had it.</p>

<p>"Yet you seemed to me very old and wise, Richard. I suppose it
came of you wearing that horrid beard."</p>

<p>"And what a little sprite you were!&mdash;so shy and elusive.
There was no catching you...or getting a word in
edgeways&mdash;thanks to that poor old chattering Mother B and her
two bumpkins."</p>

<p>"Whom you couldn't tell apart...how that did make me laugh!"
said Mary To add with a sigh: "Poor Jinny! Little did we think she
would have to go so much sooner than the rest."</p>

<p>"My dear, a good half of that party is dust by now."</p>

<p>But no melancholy tinged the reflection. In his present mood,
Mahony accepted life, and the doom life implied, with cheerfullest
composure.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Hardly a letter received by Mary that morning but had besought
them to regard the writer's house as their own: they had only to
make their choice. "Yes, and give umbrage to all the rest.
Nonsense, Mary! We'll just slip off quietly to a hotel. We don't
need to consider the expense now, and shall be much freer and more
comfortable than if we tied ourselves down to stay with
people."</p>

<p>But Mahony's plan miscarried.</p>

<p>What a home-coming that was! No sooner had the ship cast anchor
than rowing-boats began to push off from the pier; while one that
had been lying on its oars made for them with all speed. Mary,
standing hatted and shawled for landing, looked, looked again,
rubbed her eyes and exclaimed: "Why, I do declare if it isn't
Tilly! Oh, <i>Richard</i>, what a difference the weeds make!" And
sure enough a few minutes later Tilly's head came bobbing up over
the side, and the two women lay in each other's arms half laughing,
half crying, drawing back, first one, then the other, the better to
fix her friend. Certainly Tilly had never shown to more advantage.
In old days her hats had been flagrant, her silks over-sumptuous,
her jewellery too loud. Now, the neat widow's bonnet with its white
frill and black hangings formed a becoming frame for her
yellow-brown hair, tanned skin and strong white teeth; the chains,
lockets and brooches of twenty-two-carat Ballarat gold had given
way to decorous jet; the soft black stuff of the dress moulded and
threw up every good point in the rich, full-bosomed figure.
Silently Mary noted and rejoiced. But Tilly, one glance snatched,
blurted out: "Well, I must say England 'asn't done much for you, my
dear! In all my days, Mary, never did I see you look so peaked and
pasty. Seasickness? Not it! It's that <i>horrible</i> climate
you've 'ad to put up with. I declare your very letters&mdash;with
their rain, rain, and fog, fog&mdash;used to gimme the blue devils.
Well! you've come back 'ere to the finest climate in the world.
We'll 'ave you up to the mark again in a brace o' shakes."</p>

<p>Further she did not get, for here now was John arriving&mdash;a
somewhat greyer and leaner John than they had left, but advancing
upon one, thought Mahony, with the same old air of: I am here; all
is well. Having cordially embraced his sister, John wrung his
brother-in&mdash;law's hand: "It would be false to pretend
surprise, my dear Mahony, at your decision to return to us." On his
heels came none other than Jerry and his wife: a fair, fragile slip
of a girl this&mdash;Australian-born and showing it, in a skin pale
as a white flower. Mary put her arms round the child&mdash;she was
scarcely more&mdash;and kissed her warmly; while in one breath the
little wife, who was all a-flutter and a-tremble, confided to her
how very, very much afraid she had felt of this meeting, knowing
Mary to be dear "Harry's" favourite sister; and how she hoped dear
Mary, please, wouldn't mind her calling him Harry, but she had once
had a dog named Jerry, a white dog with a black patch over one eye;
and it seemed so droll, didn't it? to call your husband by the same
name as a dog, especially such a funny-looking dog; although if
dear Mary wished it very, very much...all this gabbled off like a
lesson got by heart. Mary promptly reassured her: it was her good
right to call her husband by whatever name she chose, so long as he
did not mind; and that&mdash;with a loving glance at
Jerry&mdash;she would guarantee he didn't. Then she turned to her
brother. The same steady old sober-sides; but now grown quite the
man: broad of shoulder, richly whiskered, and, as could be seen at
a glance, the most devoted of husbands. Did his young wife speak to
some one, he tried to overhear what she was saying; watched the
effect of her words on the other; smiled in advance at her little
jokes, to incite the listener to smile, too&mdash;for all the world
after the fashion of a fond mother playing off her child. And when,
sprite-like, the girl ran to the other side of the ship, he took
the opportunity before following her to squeeze his sister's hand
and murmur: "<i>what</i> do you say to my little Fanny, Mary? Isn't
she perfect?"</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Jerry! If she's only half as good as she's
pretty...and I can see she is," said Mary returning the
squeeze.</p>

<p>Meanwhile quite a crowd had collected on the wharf, to which the
party was rowed in a boat so laden that, at moments, the ladies
instinctively held their breaths to lighten the load, and the
little bride shrank into the crook of her husband's arm. Here stood
Zara fluttering a morsel of cambric: she had feared an attack of
<i>mal de mer</i>, she whispered, did she embark on so choppy a
sea. ("We could hardly, I think, love, expect Zara to consider us
worth the half-guinea the boatmen were charging!" was Mahony's
postprandial comment.) Here were Agnes Ocock and Amelia Grindle
with sundry of their children, and the old Devines, and Trotty,
advanced to a hair-net, and John's three youngest in charge of
their schoolmistress; besides many a lesser friend and acquaintance
who had made light of the journey to the port. Hand after hand was
thrust forth with: "I trust I see you in prime health, ma'am?"
"Dear, dearest Mary! <i>How</i> we have missed you!" or: "Thought
you'd never hold it out over there, sir." "Delighted, doctor, I'm
sure, to welcome you back to our little potato-patch!" And those
who could not get near enough for more, along with a sprinkling of
curious strangers, enjoyed just forming the fringe of the crowd. It
was a pleasant break in the monotony of colonial life to catch a
glimpse of arrivals from overseas; to note the latest fashion in
hair and dress; to hear news and pick up gossip.</p>

<p>Mary had just stooped to the youngest of the children,
marvelling at its growth, when her ear caught an oddly familiar
sound, an uneven, thumping footfall, and turning quickly, whom in
all the world should she see but Purdy, out of breath and red in
the face, but otherwise looking just the same as of old, or at
least "not very different"&mdash;a phrase with which Mary had
already covered a marked change in more than one present: John's
singular spareness of rib, Zara's greying front, Agnes's florid
cheeks, the wizened-apple aspect of Amelia Grindle. In Purdy's case
it cloaked a shining-through of the cranium, did he bare his head;
more than a hint of coming stoutness; a cheap and flashy style of
dress. First, though, she shot a lightning glance at Richard: how
would he take this sudden apparition? The look reassured her: he
was to-day uplifted above all ordinary prejudice. There was just an
instant's hesitation, and then he himself stepped forward, both
hands outheld, one to grasp Purdy's right, the other to clap on his
shoulder; while his: "Dickybird, my boy! How are you?...how are
you?" came simultaneously with Purdy's: "Dick, old man, I heard
your tub was in. I thought I'd just trot along and give you a
pawshake."&mdash;And thus the old bond was cemented anew.</p>

<p>Thought Mary: was there any end to the good things with which
this day was full?</p>

<p>Drawn to the group, Purdy came in for his share of the welcome.
For he had not been back to Ballarat since his abrupt departure
some years previously; and his former friends and acquaintances
hailed him with the lively interest and curiosity peculiar to
people who see but few fresh faces, and never forget an old
one.</p>

<p>He shook hands all round. When it came to Tilly: "I need hardly
introduce you two, I think!" said Mary slyly.</p>

<p>Tilly burst into a roar. "I should say not, indeed! Why, my
dear, I can remember 'im when 'e was only <i>so</i>
'igh,"&mdash;and she measured a foot from the ground.</p>

<p>Purdy capped her fiction. "Is that all? Why, you lisped your
first prayer at my knee."</p>

<p>But the children grew peevish; it was time to make a move. At
the first breathing of the word hotel, however, such a chorus of
dissent broke out that Mahony's plan had there and then to be let
drop. Not a guest-chamber, it seemed, but had been swept and
dressed for them&mdash;John's excepted, John still leading a
bachelor life at the Melbourne Club. Even Jerry and his bride had
made ready their tiny weatherboard; and here Jerry put his lips to
Mary's ear to say how inconsolable little Fanny would be if they
went elsewhere: she had sat stitching till past midnight at
wonderful bows for bed and window-hangings&mdash;a performance
which, in the young husband's eyes, far outweighed the fact of
their living miles out, at Heidelberg, to which place a coach ran
but at ten of a morning; so that the present night would have to be
spent in Melbourne, under the bride's father's roof. Had Mary been
free to please herself, she would have waived all other
considerations rather than disappoint the youthful pair. But
Richard! She could hear his amused and sarcastic ha-ha, at the idea
of "camping out" with utter strangers for the pleasure of next
morning being "carted off" to Heidelberg. Meanwhile, on her other
side Fanny was whispering: just fancy, Harry hadn't been able to
tell her what dear Mary's complexion was, whether blonde or
brunette. She had chosen pink for her bows, because pink suited
most people, and she had clapped her hands on finding she was
right; but she thought she would have sunk through the floor, had
she hit on blue. And when Mary laughingly declared that blue was
one of her favourite colours, and that even in yellow or green the
trimmings would have been equally appreciated, little Fanny bit her
lip and looked as if she were going to cry.&mdash;All this in a
rapid aside.</p>

<p>The Devines won the day&mdash;after a heated discussion in which
everybody spoke at once. These good people had actually a
carriage-and-pair in waiting, that the travellers might be spared
the brief railway journey from port to town; as well as a
spring-cart for the baggage. There was no standing out against Mrs.
Devine's persuasions, seconded as they were by the M.L.C. himself,
who from a modest place in the background threw in, whenever he got
the chance: "My 'ouse is entirely at your disposal, sir. We beg you
and your good lady will do us the honour."</p>

<p>"Indeed and I'll <i>not take no</i>!" declared his wife; and,
under a pair of nodding, hearse-like plumes, her fat, rosy face
beamed on those about her, after the manner of a big red sun. "'Tis
a great hempty barn, that's what it is, and I've looked to this day
to fill it. Why, dearie, so's not to 'ear quite so much of me own
footsteps, I've been and taken in one o' Jake's sister's 'usband's
sister's children."</p>

<p>Thus the Mahonys found themselves rolling townwards in the
Devines' well-hung landau, on their knees a picnic-basket
containing port wine and sandwiches with which to refresh and
sustain the inner man.</p>

<p>Mahony fell silent as the wheels revolved; a smile played round
his lips. He was laughing at himself for having imagined that it
would be necessary to explain away his reappearance in these
people's midst. One and all had followed John's lead in finding his
return to Australia&mdash;Australia <i>facile
princeps</i>!&mdash;the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>At South Yarra they became the occupants of the largest
guest-chamber in a brand-new mansion, which counted every comfort
and luxury the upholsterers had known how to cram into it, and now
only needed really to be lived in. Its stiff formality reminded
Mary, the homemaker, of the specimen rooms set out in a great
furniture warehouse; rooms in which no living creature has yet left
a trace. Her fingers itched to break up the prim rows of chairs
ranged against the walls; lightly to disarrange albums; to leave on
antimacassars the impress of a head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Devine having finally satisfied herself that they had
everything they had everything they required&mdash;; down to a
plump and well-studded pincushion on which the pins wrote
"Welcome!"&mdash;for: "I've no faith in them giddy girls,
dearie,"&mdash;husband and wife were at last alone together.</p>

<p>"Whew!" breathed Mahony, and sinking into an armchair he fanned
himself with his handkerchief. "Well! I sincerely hope you're
satisfied, Mary. Royalty itself could not ask for a warmer welcome
than you have had, my dear." But he smiled again as he spoke; and
the usual edge to his words was wanting.</p>

<p>"You, too," said Mary, who was fighting the lock of a carpetbag.
Then she laughed. "As if royalty ever got hugged, and kissed, and
slapped on the back! But indeed, Richard, I shall never, never
forget the kindness that's been shown us. And what a lovely house
this is! I mean, could be made."</p>

<p>"My dear, you shall have as good&mdash;and better. Rather much
oilcloth here for my taste. The grounds, too, struck me as
stiffish, what I saw of them." Rising to take another look through
a raised slat of the venetian, he turned and beckoned his wife.
"What do you say to this, Mary?" Peeping over his shoulder she saw
their host, in comfortable corduroys, without his coat, his
shirt-sleeves rolled up above his elbows, trundling a loaded
wheelbarrow. Said Mahony: "Seems to have turned into a very decent
sort of fellow indeed, does our good Cincinnatus."</p>

<p>"Who?...Mr. Devine? Yes, hasn't he? I thought it most tactful of
him to be quiet in the carriage, when he saw you didn't want to
talk."</p>

<p>Below, on a dinner-table built to accommodate a score, a
veritable banquet had been spread. They sat down to it at six
o'clock, a large family party. For on the wharf Mrs. Devine, as
winner, had scattered her invitations broadcast, even insisting on
Tilly exchanging her hotel for the second-best spare room. Zara was
there, together with Jerry and his wife, and John, and Trotty, who
hung on one of Aunt Mary's arms as did pretty Fanny on the other;
and the health of the home-comers and the happy change in Mahony's
fortunes were drunk to in bumpers of champagne. By every one but
the master of the house; before whose plate stood a jug of
barley-water. In the intervals of signalling to the servants where
to put the dishes, and whose glass or plate stood empty, Mrs.
Devine, purply moist with gratification and excitement, drew
Mahony's attention to this jug with a nudge and a wink.</p>

<p>"Your doin', doctor...all thanks to you. Jake took the pledge
that time you know of, and never 'as 'e broke it since, no matter
where 'e is or in 'oos company." She actually laid her pudgy hand
on Mahony's and gave it a warm squeeze.</p>

<p>"Very creditable...very creditable indeed," murmured Mahony,
stiff with embarrassment lest his host should overhear what was
being said.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Devine had already telegraphed to her husband down the
length of the table; and the good man smiled and nodded, and sipped
his barley-water in Mahony's direction.</p>

<p>The ladies withdrawing and Jerry sidling out soon after, the
three men pulled their chairs closer; and now colonial affairs took
the place of family gossip and perfunctory inquiries about "home."
As fellow-members of the Legislative Council, John and Devine had
become fast friends. It was also in the wind, it seemed, that
Devine might be called on to form a ministry. Puzzled by the many
changes, the new men and new names that had come up during his
absence, Mahony acted chiefly the listener; but the interested
listener, for it was gratifying to find himself once more at the
fountain-head. His companions' talk, ranging over a great variety
of topics, harked back yet and again to the great natural
catastrophe in the face of which legislation was
powerless&mdash;the unprecedented drought which, already in its
fourth year, was ruining the squatters, compelling them to part
with thousands on thousands of dying sheep, for the price of the
skins alone.</p>

<p>In listening Mahony eyed the two men up and down. His bearded
host looked sound as a bell. But it was otherwise with
John&mdash;"He's a shocking bad colour,"&mdash;and knowing his
brother-in-law to be of temperate habits, he resolved to have a
word with him in private.</p>

<p>It grew late: for over an hour John's horses had pawed the
gravel of the drive. Finally Mahony excused himself on grounds of
fatigue and ran upstairs. But he might have saved his haste. For
Mary had taken her hairbrush and gone to Tilly's room. There, a
fresh log having been thrown on the whitewashed hearth, the two
women sat and talked far into the night.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-2" id="ch-2-2-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>Mahony's first lightning plan of putting up his plate at the top
of Collins Street, among the bigwigs of the profession, was not
carried out. For when, the day after landing, he went to interview
Simmonds, his man of business, he found his affairs in even more
brilliant condition than Simmonds' letter&mdash;written a fortnight
back to await the ship's arrival&mdash;had led him to believe. That
had put the sum lying to his credit at between ten and eleven
thousand pounds. By now, however&mdash;a second company in which he
was interested choosing the self-same moment to look
up&mdash;combined dividends were flowing in at the rate of twelve
to fifteen hundred pounds a month. And this, despite the enormous
outlay incurred by the Australia Felix Company in sinking a fourth
shaft, lighting the mine throughout with gas, erecting the heaviest
plant yet seen on the goldfields.</p>

<p>In the conveyance that left Collins Street at midday for South
Yarra, Mahony sat feeling mildly stunned by the extent of his good
fortune, as by Simmonds' confident prediction of still grander
things to come; sat with far-away eyes, absently noting the velvety
black shadows that accompanied vehicles and pedestrians up and down
the glaring whiteness of the great street. He had already drawn
attention to himself by smiling broadly at thought of the news he
was taking home to Mary. Now, as a fresh idea struck him, he
uttered a smothered exclamation and tried to slap his knee a
gesture that entangled him with a stout party whose crinoline
overflowed him, and gave a pimply faced youth sitting opposite a
chance to exercise his wit.</p>

<p>"Fy, matey, fy! What 'ud our missis say?"</p>

<p>The vehicle&mdash;a kind of roofless omnibus&mdash;started with
a lunge that sent the two rows of passengers toppling like ninepins
one against another. Mahony alone raised his voice in apology: he
had lain on the shoulder of the fat woman. The man on her farther
side angrily bade her take her danged feathers out of his eye. The
greater number recovered their balance by thrusting forth an elbow
and lodging it firmly in a neighbour's rib.</p>

<p>Even in his present holiday mood this promiscuity was too much
for Mahony. He regretted not having accepted Devine's offer of a
buggy; and half-way to his destination dismounted, and covered the
rest of the distance on foot.</p>

<p>This was better. In the outlying district where he found
himself, no traffic moved. Roads and paths were sandy and
grass-edged. The scattered houses lay far back in their gardens,
screened by rows of Scotch firs. He met no one, could think in
peace; and over a knotty point he stopped short and dug with his
stick in the sand.</p>

<p>The brilliant idea that had flashed through his mind in the
omnibus was: why go back into harness at all? Retire!...retire and
live on his dividends...here was the solution. From now on be free
to devote himself to the things that really mattered, in which he
had hitherto had no share.</p>

<p>He threshed the scheme out as he went, and was plain-spoken with
himself. I am now a middle-aged man: forty-three and a quarter to
be exact in point of time, but a good ten years older with regard
to bodily health...and disillusionment: considerably more than
halfway, that is, on my journey to the green sod. And what have I
so far had of life? It has been but one long grind: firstly to keep
my head above water, and then, to live up to my neighbours; while
every attempt to free myself has failed, the last great wild-goose
chase most completely of any. Yes, the real trouble has always been
want of money &mdash;of money and time&mdash;or of money enough to
have time. Now that the one has fallen to me, should I not be a
fool beyond compare if I failed to master the other? Think of all
the wonders of this world I shall die without knowing&mdash;the
books I shall not have read, the scientific discoveries, the
intellectual achievements I shall never have heard of. Oh! the joy
of devoting one's remaining years to a congenial occupation. One
cannot love one's work, the handle one grinds by&mdash;the notion
that such a thing is possible belongs to a man's green and salad
days. Though perhaps if one climbed to the top of the tree...But
for the majority of us, the fact that we labour to earn our bread
by a certain handiwork wears all liking for it threadbare. It
becomes a habit&mdash;like the meals one eats...the clothes one
puts on of a morning.&mdash;Ambitions to be sacrificed? But are
there? I had them once; in plenty. Where are they now? Blown into
thin air&mdash;spent like smoke. The fag of living was too much for
them. And so, in following my bent, I should sacrifice
nothing&mdash;or nothing but the possibility of fresh
humiliations...and much unnecessary pother...an infinitude of
business...Thus he reasoned, thus justified himself to himself,
arriving at the house with his arguments marshalled ready to be
laid before Mary. The walk, however, had taken longer than he
expected; the afternoon was now far advanced and he footsore and
hungry. But though he could hear the servants chattering in the
kitchen, none came to offer him so much as a cup of tea. They would
of course suppose him to have lunched; or else Madam D. had the
keys of the larder in her petticoat pocket. The big house yawned
inhospitably still and empty&mdash;but for a common-looking child
in copper-toed boots and oilcloth apron, which he unexpectedly ran
across: it fled from him like a startled cat. Mary was out driving
with her hostess and did not get back till close on dinner-time.
There was another party that night; they sat down fifteen to table
and went to bed only in the small hours. He could do no more than
skim the cream off his interview for her benefit, before
retiring.</p>

<p>His chance came next morning.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock had struck, but Mary was still in bedgown and
slippers, her hair tied in its nightly bunch of half a dozen little
plaits on the crown of her head. This state of undress did not,
however, imply that she had newly risen&mdash;as a matter of fact
she had been up and doing for a couple of hours. But it was one of
the rules of this extraordinary house that visitors did not
breakfast till after ten; the longer after, the better, but at any
moment <i>past</i> the hour, provided that the servants did not
know beforehand what it would be: they must be kept up to the mark,
hover perpetually alert for the ringing of the dining-room bell:
and many and scathing were Richard's comments on the practice of
using your guests as the stick with which to belabour your slaves.
Mrs. Devine herself, clad in a voluminous paisley gown, her
nightcap bound under her chin, was early astir: she gave her
husband, who rose at dawn to work among his flowers&mdash;as he had
once worked among his market produce&mdash;breakfast at eight,
before he left for town. But if you belonged to the elite, were
truly <i>bon ton</i>, you did not descend till the morning was half
over, and even then must appear "stifling elegant yawns, which show
the effort it has been to tear your high-born limbs from the
feathers!"&mdash;so ran another of Richard's glosses. The first
morning he and Mary had blundered in this respect; on the second
they were wiser; and now loitered chilly and hungry above-stairs.
Chafing at the absurdity and fretting for his breakfast, Mahony
grumbled: "Was there ever such a fudge? As if the woman didn't know
I used to have to be up at daybreak, if necessary...was in my
consulting-room hours before this."</p>

<p>Mary, who had been writing letters and sewing, began to dress
her hair. "Do try not to fuss so, dear. After all, it's only a
little thing. It pleases her to imagine she's up in the ways of
good society. Besides, every house has its peculiarities."</p>

<p>"Then give me my own, thank you. But what absurd nonsense you do
talk, Mary! I'm sure, when you had 'em, you never tyrannised over
guests in this stark fashion. You were their drudge, my dear;
danced to their tune. But I believe you'd sacrifice the last scrap
of your personal comfort to pander to the foibles of other
people."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Mary stoutly. "But we can't possibly let her
see we don't like it."</p>

<p>She had unbound her hair: freed from its plaits, it hung all
crinks and angles. Now she set, with long, smooth sweeps, to
brushing it to its customary high gloss.</p>

<p>Mahony pulled a chair to the window, threw up the sash and leant
his elbow on the sill. The morning was warm and balmy, after a
bitterly cold night. By midday the sun would have gained almost
summer strength, gradually to fade through the autumn of the
afternoon till, with darkness, you were back in a wintry spring.
The orange-blossom scent of the pittosperums, now everywhere in
flower, filled the air. Sunning himself thus, he fell to informing
Mary yet once again what he had made up his mind to; spoke shortly
and impatiently and with decision. For this time at least he knew
that his planning involved his wife in no hardships: he was not
asking her to shoulder fresh burdens.</p>

<p>Practised hand though she was at concealing surprise, and
rightly attributing Richard's snappishness to the want of a good
hot cup of coffee, Mary could not help echoing his words, her
hairbrush suspended in the air. "Give up practice altogether?" And,
at his emphatic affirmation: "But, Richard, you'd soon get tired of
having nothing to do."</p>

<p>"Nothing to do indeed! I, who all my life have longed for a
little leisure to follow my own pursuits! Haven't I told you, Mary,
again and again, that if I were to read from sunrise to sundown,
for the rest of my days, I shouldn't get through a quarter of the
books that are waiting for me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, don't talk such rubbish. As if you could spend all
the rest of your life reading! Why, I've often heard you say, after
sitting with your head in a book for even a few hours running, that
it felt like a boiled turnip."</p>

<p>"But, good God!...I shall have a garden, I suppose?...and a
decent horse to ride?"</p>

<p>"Now, Richard, it's no use mincing words: you do tire easily of
things &mdash;much more easily than other people. And I'm sure
you'd tire of idleness as well. After working as you have."</p>

<p>"Oh, go on acting the brake on the coach. I suppose that, too,
is a mission in life."</p>

<p>"How you do snap one up! There's this about it, of course, you
<i>could</i> go back into practice at any time if you wanted to."
("Thank you, never again for me!") "You only say that now, Richard.
In a couple of years you may have completely changed your mind. No,
it's not a bit of good getting angry. I think it's a step that
requires most careful consideration. Besides you promised,
remember, not so <i>very</i> long ago, to be guided next time by
what I thought."</p>

<p>"So I did. But here the case is different&mdash;entirely
different. Not twopenceworth of risk is entailed. I have no
intention of speculating further, as you ought to know&mdash;if you
know anything at all about me&mdash;and, well invested, this money
that has fallen to us is enough to keep us in comfort to our lives'
end."</p>

<p>But Mary refused to be rushed into a decision.</p>

<p>The long, elaborate breakfast over: they had to eat their way
through chops and steaks, eggs and rissoles, barracouta and
garfish, fruit, hot rolls, preserves, tea and coffee: breakfast
coped with, Mary waited, dressed for driving, for the carriage to
come round, and for her hostess to cease goading on her several
maidservants and tracking down their misdeeds. Propping her chin in
her hand and poking with the tip of her parasol at one of the
fruit-and-flower baskets enworked in the maroon ground of the
Brussels carpet, Mary wrestled with the problem of their future.
Richard's present project called for a readjustment of all her
private plans for his benefit. These had never wavered; remained
those she had hatched on the morrow of the Buddlecombe fiasco; and
throughout the voyage she had listened in silence to his fluid
plannings and imaginings what he was going to do next&mdash;had
just listened and let him talk. Ballarat had seen his beginnings;
seen his rise to one of its most popular medical men: it should
also, she was resolved, learn to know him as the moneyed consultant
who could afford to see as few patients as he wished. It was
ridiculous for him to think of starting all over again in a strange
place, when there, in Ballarat, was his old reputation waiting for
him. What was the point of success either, if it did not come to
you among the friends of your less palmy days?</p>

<p>But his intention to retire into private life cut clean through
these aspirations. And yet, for the first time, Mary hesitated. The
difference was, what he now proposed made a subtle appeal to her.
For, to be nothing, to have neither trade nor profession, to fold
one's hands and live on one's income&mdash;that was the <i>ne plus
ultra</i> of colonial society, the ideal tirelessly to be striven
after. Work brought neither honour nor glory where all too many had
been manual labourers, the work itself of a low or disreputable
kind. And the contingency of Richard ending as the private
gentleman, the leisured man of means, had never been wholly absent
from Mary's mind&mdash;or wouldn't have been, had he not so
quixotically cut his career in half.</p>

<p>There was another point, too: was anybody better fitted than he
to live as the gentleman? Where so many floundered like fish out of
water, he would be entirely in his element. If <i>only</i> she
could have felt surer of him! But thanks to Buddlecombe she knew
that, no matter how fixed he seemed, at the first trifling
unpleasantness&mdash;a hint, for example, that medically he was on
the shelf&mdash;he would be up and off to prove the contrary;
perhaps again, as on the last occasion, not even condescending to
tell her where the trouble lay. Oh dear! it <i>would</i> be nice to
have a husband who saw things sensibly and practically&mdash;as one
did oneself. How the two of them could then have put their heads
together. Instead of her always having to make allowance for
unreckonable impulses.</p>

<p>One comfort: there was no more talk on his part of going "home"
with his fortune. The old foolish idea that he would be happier in
England had been knocked on the head. At considerable expense, and
much worry and trouble, poor old Richard! Still, if he <i>would</i>
buy his experience in this costly fashion...Here, however, her
musings were cut short by the entrance of Mrs. Devine in shawl and
bonnet, and struggling to button a magenta kid glove across a palm
not built for such a covering: it bulged through the opening,
creased and rolled with fat. The good lady was keyed up to a high
pitch with domestic disasters&mdash;a chipped wineglass, a scrap of
flue found under a bed&mdash;"Liars and deceivers every one,
dearie!" But the great red face beamed with goodwill. No malice was
in it; only the delights of the chase; so that the onlooker was
reluctantly driven to conclude that Mrs. Devine heartily enjoyed
her slave-driving.</p>

<p>And her private doubts and scruples notwithstanding, Mary could
not but feel pleased and proud, for Richard's sake, at the stir
caused by the announcement that he had no further need to practise
medicine. Congratulations showered on him. Himself, he laughed, in
his new, happy fashion. "I declare, so much fuss they make, I might
have discovered the North Pole." And having got him safely away
from the tyrannic rules Mrs. Devine considered essential to his
comfort&mdash;or the comfort of his blue blood&mdash;and settled in
a furnished house near the Carlton Gardens, Mary prepared to guide
him gently and imperceptibly along the road she thought it for his
good he should go. In doing this, however, she found herself up
against a stone wall, in the shape of a hitherto unsuspected trait
in Richard: a violent aversion from returning on his traces. When
it dawned on him that she was still hankering after Ballarat, he
lost his temper, and vowed with the utmost vehemence that
<i>when</i> he was done with a place he <i>was</i> done, and wild
horses shouldn't drag him back to it.</p>

<p>"Good God, Mary! one's dead self would confront one at every
turn. Here one did this, there that. You don't stock-take, my dear,
when you're going on living in a place; but a break&mdash;and even
a brief one&mdash;forces you to it...in murderous fashion. I should
thank you for the constant reminder how life is flying, and how
little one has made of it, and what a fool one was in the past, and
yet how full of hopes and aspirations."&mdash;With cobwebby stuff
such as this, there was no coming to grips.</p>

<p>No, it was to be Melbourne this time. What was more, he had
resolved to build his own house. He was sick to death of suiting
his needs to those of other people.</p>

<p><i>Build?</i>...well yes, there was something to be said for it:
Mary hastily swallowed her dismay, seeing his feathers rise in
earnest. Build?...before he knew anything about a locality? Why, a
neighbour's fowls only needed to cackle or crow too early of a
morning, railway-whistles or church-bells sound too plainly, and
all his peace and pleasure would be gone. She was not going to risk
any such contingency as that, thank you! And having wormed the
information out of him that he leaned to the district lying between
St. Kilda and Brighton, she took John into confidence, and John and
she laid their heads together to circumvent his harebrained scheme.
A string or two was pulled; and one day, while Richard and she were
driving round looking for a site, they happened, as if by chance,
on the very house to suit them. One, too, that was not yet in the
public market. As John had foreseen, Richard lost his heart to it
on the spot, and before the week was out had become its
owner.&mdash;Well! buying offhand was bad enough; but a good deal
less risky than building.</p>

<p>Houses in Melbourne were of two types: either spacious, white,
two-storeyed buildings almost as broad as they were long, with
balcony and verandah to the front, and needing but to stand in a
sandy compound to advertise their origin; or low, sprawly villas a
single storey high, Covering much ground space, and wearing their
circlet of verandah like a shady hat. Mahony's purchase was of this
latter kind.</p>

<p>Built some ten years previously, by a wealthy squatter who was
now about to become a permanent absentee, it stood within half an
hour's walk of the Brighton beach, on a quiet, sandy road the edges
of which were fringed with grass and capeweed. The grounds, running
to between four and five acres, were well stocked and fully grown;
and included kitchen and flower-gardens, a couple of croquet lawns
and a fair-sized orchard. From the gates, no glimpse of the house
could be caught, so thick were the protecting shrubberies, so
closely set the Scotch firs. These grounds turned the scales for
Mahony. To get a garden&mdash;and such a garden!&mdash;ready-made,
instead of having to wait for it to grow. In the house itself the
only alteration he planned was a large study to be thrown out on
the orchard side. Otherwise it suited them to a nicety.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-3" id="ch-2-2-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>While Richard haunted his new property and egged on the workmen,
or sat drawing up a list of books for dispatch to an Edinburgh
bookseller, Mary devoted herself to unravelling the knots and
tangles into which the several members of her family had tied
themselves. And after for two years having had to deal exclusively
with a difficult, faddy person like Richard, she found this a
comparatively simple job. Those to whose aid she now came saw
things from the same angle as herself, and they spoke a common
language.</p>

<p>Zara had first innings. Seated in the drawing-room of the
Carlton house, Zara poured out her woes, with much drying of eyes
and the old, old recriminations against John. Never, she wept, had
she met any one so hard, so self-centred. He was also too stingy to
lift a finger to help you; and, in her opinion, richly deserved the
misfortunes that had befallen him&mdash;Emma's untimely death, and
the loss of Jinny; the disgrace of Johnny's flight and Trotty's
misdemeanours. Who could wonder at it, if he treated wives and
children as he was now treating her?</p>

<p>"But, Zara..."</p>

<p>Oh, John had the influence, could do it <i>easily</i> if he
chose. But for that, he was too down on the match. As if his own
second marriage had been anything to boast of! Pray, who was Jinny?
A publican's daughter...and, if the truth were told, common as
dirt. But&mdash; "I'm still utterly in the dark, Zara. Who is it
John objects to...that you want to marry?"</p>

<p>"Not I want to marry, if you please, Mary!" Zara's tone was acid
as a lemon. "It's <i>quite</i> the other way about. If it only
rested with me..."</p>

<p>"Yes, but <i>who?</i>"</p>

<p>"Haven't you wits enough to guess, my dear? Who is it that has
followed me and pestered&mdash;yes, <i>pestered!</i>&mdash;me with
his attentions, ever since my first visit to Ballarat?"</p>

<p>Ballarat? Her first visit? "Zara! You surely don't mean..."</p>

<p>"My dear, I have not a heart of <i>stone</i>&mdash;like
<i>some</i> people I could mention! I can stand out no longer
against his prayers and persuasions. Year after year, year after
year&mdash;not <i>many</i> women, Mary, can boast of having
inspired such devotion. He worships the very ground I
tread&mdash;and has done ever since those early days...though I was
then little more than a child. Of course, I am aware he is not my
equal..."</p>

<p>"Oh, good gracious, what does that matter if you really care for
him? I've no patience with nonsense of that kind."</p>

<p>Mary spoke with a robust heartiness; but her thoughts were
elsewhere, and travelled swiftly. In the two years that had elapsed
since last she saw her, Zara had crossed a subtle boundary, and,
from being a youngish person who looked a trifle worn and tired,
had turned into an elderly person who looked young for her age:
which made all the difference in the world. For, alas! Zara's
features were not of that well-boned type, whose cameo outlines
show up even better in the middle years than under the plump
padding of youth. Short, irregular, piquant, they had depended on
freshness and round contours for their charm. Now that the dimples
had run to lines, the cheeks hollowed, the skin sagged, Zara wore
the pathetic aspect of a faded child. When she drooped her fine
eyes, it was really sad, to one who loved her, to see how haggard
and old she looked. Poor Zara! All her choice offers and good
chances come to nothing. She had dangled them too long; been over
fastidious; and now it was too late. Mary could read this out of
what she said: this and more. Even the posts open to her as
finishing-governess were not, it appeared, what they had once been.
Younger women, competent to teach the new&mdash;fangled
"callisthenics," and dull, dry pieces by "Mosar" instead of the
tuneful <i>Morceaux</i> in which Zara excelled, were now getting
the plums. It did seem a shame, considering Zara's talents, and her
long experience but so it was. Perhaps she had grown a trifle
"scratchy" with the years. Her elegant sprightliness was certainly
deserting her, giving place to a kind of fixed pettishness. And so,
having turned the matter over, Mary soothed her by promising to do
all she could to further the marriage. She would beard John in his
den, and urge him to use his influence&mdash;according to Zara he
was on friendly terms with a prominent member of the Baptist
Union&mdash;to procure for her intended, who was still but an
unsalaried "helper," the pastorate that would enable them to
wed.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, you must bring Hemp...Mr. Hempel to see us."</p>

<p>As visiting John at the Melbourne Club was out of the question,
Mary took the only slightly less bold step of calling at the great
warehouse in Flinders Lane. And having climbed a dark, steep stair
to the first storey, and passed through various rooms where clerks,
perched on high stools, stole curious glances at the apparition of
a silk-and-velvet-clad lady whispered to be the senior partner's
sister: this ordeal behind her, she arrived, a trifle pink and
confused, at the door of John's sanctum.</p>

<p>John himself emerged to meet her.</p>

<p>"Yes, John, quite alone...I hope you won't mind. But I wanted
very much to see you." And having regained breath and composure,
Mary lost no time in going straight to the core of Zara's
business.</p>

<p>John listened, with a patience he would have shown no one else,
his dark eyes, so like Mary's own, yet so much older in worldly
wisdom, turned intently on her.&mdash;"Objections to her marrying?
My dear girl, as far as I personally am concerned, my sister Zara
may wed a navvy if she chooses&mdash;always provided he has the
means to support her, once the knot is tied. But this
Methody-fellow now...have you seen him? No? Then pray do so,
without delay. After which, let me hear if you are still of the
same mind."</p>

<p>"Your sister Zara," he went on, "admits to having laid by, in
the course of her governessing, some five hundred pounds: knowing
her as we do, seven or eight hundred would, I make no doubt, be
nearer the mark. This sum, well invested, will ensure her yearly
some eighty or ninety pounds&mdash;not a princely income, I dare
say, but sufficient for the requirements of an unmarried female.
Should she, however, fritter away her savings on this
what's-his-name, it would, in the event of his decease, fall to her
relatives to support her. Which I for one am not disposed to
do."</p>

<p>Mary had refrained from interrupting. Now, nothing daunted, she
insisted on John viewing the case from Zara's standpoint: the very
natural desire of an ageing woman for a home and a husband; the
dreaded stigma of old-maidism; the weariness and monotony of going
on teaching other people's children year after year; the
mortification of seeing younger women chosen over your head, and
your salary steadily decreasing as you grew older. And finally, by
dint of what she afterwards described to Richard as "this, that,
and the other thing," she got John so far as to promise that if,
after seeing the bridegroom-elect, she still thought the marriage
should go forward, he would do what lay in his power to procure for
Hempel the pastorate in the little up-country township of
Wangawatha, on which Zara had set her heart.</p>

<p>This accomplished, Mary drew on her gloves, which she had
removed for the sherry and biscuits brought forth by John from a
cupboard, with a "Both dry unfortunately, my dear girl, since I am
not often honoured by visits from the sweet-toothed sex."</p>

<p>"And does business flourish, John?"</p>

<p>"It does, Mary. Yes, on that score I have nothing to complain
of&mdash;nothing whatever. As you will have observed, we have
recently made considerable additions to the premises, and young
MacDermott has been definitely taken into partnership. Still, as
far as I myself am concerned, I confess there come moments when in
spite of everything I look round me and ask: <i>cui bono</i>? For
whom do I build?...since there is no one to step into my shoes when
I am gone."</p>

<p>John and <i>cui bono</i>!...John to talk of being "gone"! Mary's
eyes widened and darkened. But she did not let the opportunity
slip. "Look here, John, what I have always been meaning to say: I
firmly intend to try and find out what has become of
Johnny&mdash;and if possible get him home again. It seems dreadful
to me that a boy of that age, and one I was so fond of, too, should
just disappear and perhaps never be heard of again. I feel
convinced there was nothing radically wrong; and can't help
thinking he'd be ready to come back after this taste of hardship,
and settle down, and make you proud of him."</p>

<p>Was it fancy, or did a new expression flit over John's face at
her words?&mdash;a kind of hope look out of his eyes? If so, it was
gone again at once, drowned in the harsh expression he seemed to
reserve for poor Emma's children. "Nay, I have washed my hands of
him, Mary. He has publicly disgraced me. And from all I hear, I
fear his sister is about to follow the example he has set her."</p>

<p>At this Mary laughed outright. "Really, John! I'm surprised at
you: letting yourself be imposed on by the tales of some prim old
school-marm. You wait; I mean to have Trotty down to stay with me;
and then I'll very soon find out the truth about her. Besides, you
know you <i>can't</i> wash your hands of your children like this;
it's unnatural. I wish to goodness I could see you comfortably
settled in your own house once more, with them all about you. This
is very well, but it <i>isn't</i> home."&mdash;And Mary's glance
swept the leaded windows, the cobwebbed corners, the white dust on
books and papers, the dimness of the office furniture; to end with
John himself. To her eye he had a rather uncared-for appearance
nowadays; looked unbrushed, much less spruce than of old.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" John, his elbows on the arms of his chair, lightly
met his ten fingers and tipped them, to a shrug of the shoulders.
"Ah! had it pleased the Almighty to make women other than they
are&mdash;yourself excepted, my dear Mary, always excepted. But
that reminds me. I have been intending for some time past to ask
you to drive out and go over the house, and report to me on its
condition. The last person I placed in charge proved as
untrustworthy as the rest."</p>

<p>Stowing away the key in her petticoat pocket, Mary gladly
undertook the commission. And as she jogged homewards in a
wagonette, she felt well satisfied with what she had achieved; and
not on Zara's score alone. "Poor old John! He doesn't <i>know</i>
how lonely and uncomfortable he is. Or how, in his heart of hearts,
he's fretting for that boy."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after considerable shilly-shallying, Zara had
introduced Hempel afresh, in what proved an exceedingly painful
visit.</p>

<p>"I declare," said Mary afterwards, "every time I spoke, I seemed
to put my foot in it."</p>

<p>To begin with, it was plain at once what John had meant by his:
wait till you have seen him! Hempel was now but the shadow of his
former self, shrunken, emaciated, with over-bright eyes, and a dry
cough that took him in paroxysms, at the end of which he withdrew a
spotted handkerchief from his lips.</p>

<p>Zara looked so annoyed when this happened that Mary tried to
seem unobservant. But after one particularly violent explosion, the
words: "Oh, what do you do for it?" escaped her in spite of
herself.</p>

<p>"It's <i>nothing</i> in the world but dust," cut in Zara
smartly. "I vow Carlton to be the dustiest suburb in all Melbourne.
How you came to select it amazes me&mdash;positively it does!"</p>

<p>"I look upon it as a righteous affliction, ma'am," said Hempel
loudly and slowly, and as though Zara had not spoken. "Such things
are sent to try us. 'Oom the Lord loveth 'e chasteneth."</p>

<p>"Besides he is perfectly well able to control it if he
chooses."&mdash;Zara was so caustic that Mary hurriedly made a
diversion by inviting her upstairs. And curiosity to hear a
detailed account of the interview with John got the better of
Zara's patent reluctance to leave the two men alone together.</p>

<p>"He looks dreadfully delicate, Zara," said Mary dubiously, when
the bedroom door had shut behind them.</p>

<p>"My dear Mary, a change of climate is <i>all</i> that is
necessary. We have taken the very <i>best</i> medical advice. I
truly hope Richard will not go putting any far-fetched notions into
his head." And overriding Mary's delicate inquiries with a
dramatic: "The happiness of my life is at stake!" Zara declined a
chair, swept her crinoline about the room, and having greedily
extracted the gist of John's promises, knew no peace till they
returned to the parlour.</p>

<p>Hempel&mdash;he now wore a short, woolly beard round face and
throat&mdash;had certainly improved in his way of speaking. Still
he did have lapses; and these Zara accentuated and underlined in
distressing fashion. Throughout the visit she sat bolt upright on
the extreme edge of her chair, almost prompting the words into
Hempel's mouth; while, at every misplaced or unaccomplished "h,"
she half-closed her eyes and drew in her breath with a semi-audible
groan, as if the aspirate were a missile that had struck her.
Hempel alone remained undisturbed by her behaviour. Richard, Mary
knew, would be fuming inwardly at such tactlessness; and her own
discomfiture was so acute that she trebled the warmth of her manner
towards the unfortunate man.</p>

<p>"And what are we to call you?" she asked, as Zara rose to go.
"Mister sounds too stiff altogether for a relation."</p>

<p>Instantly she saw that, with this well-meant question, she had
made another mistake. Zara turned a dark red, and flashing a
warning glance at Hempel began a hurried babble of adieux. But
Hempel was either too dense or too obstinate to see.</p>

<p>"My name, ma'am, is Ebenezer." ("Edgar, Mary, Edgar is what I
call him!") "Yes, Miss Turn'am 'ere"&mdash;and so saying, Hempel
signified Zara, without looking at her, by an odd little outward
jerk of the elbow and a smile that struck even Mary as
malicious&mdash;"Miss Turn'am don't cotton to it, and wants to
persuade me to fancy names. But I say the one as my parents chose
for me in the name of the Lord is good enough for me. So I'll be
obleeged by Ebenezer, if you please."</p>

<p>"It's in the Bible, too, isn't it?" threw in Mary, feeling, if
she did not see, the silent laughter with which Richard was
shaking. And to herself she thought: "Oh dear, won't he catch it
when he gets outside!"</p>

<p>"Ha ha! Serves her right...serves her very well right. Mrs.
Ebenezer! Why, of course, it comes back to me now." ("I felt sure
it was Edward&mdash;or I shouldn't have asked," said Mary ruefully.
"And now I shan't know what to call him.") "But I can tell you
this, my dear: Zara is about to commit a monstrous folly. The
fellow is far gone in phthisis. If she wants a job as sick-nurse,
she'll get it&mdash;and upon my word, Mary, I don't know that she
won't be better employed in seeing the poor chap decently and
comfortably into his coffin, than in grafting her insincerities and
affectations on the young. A more lukewarm bridegroom, though, it
has seldom been my lot to meet."</p>

<p>"How hard on her you are! Yes, both you and John. Every woman
<i>naturally</i> wants a husband...and a good thing, too, or where
would the world be? Besides if she doesn't marry, you men are the
first to twit her with being an old maid. But if she shows any
inclination for it, it's considered matter for a joke...or not
quite nice."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear! Why, love, at this rate we shall soon have you clad
in bloomers and spouting on a platform for women's rights."</p>

<p>"Richard! Don't speak to me of such horrors. But we're talking
about Zara. I must say, after seeing Hempel I agree with John, it's
a ridiculous match. He really doesn't seem to care <i>that</i> much
for her..."</p>

<p>"Which is but natural. At his stage of the disease a man is
entirely occupied with his own health...and his God."</p>

<p>"And I thought Zara most cutting with him. No, I'm afraid she's
taking him just to be married."</p>

<p>But, even as she said it, Mary had a glimpse into depths that
were closed to her menkind. Just to be married! It meant that
solace of the woman who was getting on in years&mdash;the plain
gold band on the ring finger. It meant no longer being shut out
from the great Society of Matrons; no longer needing to look the
other way were certain subjects alluded to; or pretending not to
notice the nods and winks, the silently mouthed words that went on
behind your back. It was all very well when you were young; when
your very youth and innocence made up for it: as you grew older, it
turned to a downright mortification&mdash;like that of going in to
dinner after the bride of eighteen.</p>

<p>"Besides we <i>can't</i> dictate to Zara as if she were still a
child. She has a right to buy her own experience...even if it's
only with a poor creature like Hempel."</p>

<p>Another unspoken thought that lurked comfortably at the back of
Mary's mind was of the more than liberal pin-money Richard was now
giving her. He had said expressly, too, she need render no account
of how she spent it. Thus, should the worst happen, she would be
able to see to it that neither he nor John had to put hand to
pocket.</p>

<p>A last attempt to bring Zara to reason, however, she made. And
having only succeeded in fanning the flames&mdash;sister-wise, Zara
took interference less well from her than from any one&mdash;Mary
tilted her chin, and sighing: "Well, we must just make the best of
it!" forthwith requested John to do his share.</p>

<p>One thing, though, she did not yield in: she went off by herself
to town and bought the stuff for Zara's wedding-dress. For Zara,
she could see, was meditating satin and orange-blossoms; and
against this all Mary's common sense rose in arms. "For a place
like Wangawatha! And with not even a Bishop to entertain...I mean,
Hempel being a Baptist." So she chose Madras muslin&mdash;finest
Madras, which cost a good deal more than satin&mdash;and a neat
bonnet trimmed with lilac.</p>

<p>"For these you can wear to chur&mdash;to chapel, Zara, you know,
when the hot weather comes." But Zara was so angry that she forgot
to thank Mary for the gift, and tried the texture of the muslin
between thumb and finger as if it were a bit of print.</p>

<p>And so a quiet wedding was celebrated at the Carlton house, a
ceremony in which the only hitch was a somewhat lengthy pause for
the bridegroom to recover his breath after a fit of coughing; a
glass of champagne was drunk to the health of the newly wedded; and
off they went in a shower of rice which Mary took care was thick
enough to satisfy even Zara. Nor was a satin slipper forgotten for
the back of the carriage-and-pair, all flowers and favours, which
Mahony had provided to drive the happy couple to the steamboat on
which they would sail to Sorrento.</p>

<p>The very last thing, upstairs in the bedroom, Mary pressed a
small wad of notes into Zara's hand. "A bit of my wedding present
to you, dear Zara. Now don't stint on your honeymoon. Put up at the
best hotel and enjoy yourselves. Remember, one is only married
once."</p>

<p>"<i>Merci, ma bonne Marie, merci!</i>" said Zara: in the course
of the past hour she had gradually taken on the allures of an elder
married woman towards her junior. "But I should have done so in any
case."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The rice swept up, the hundred and one boxes of wedding cake
dispatched which should intimate to even the least of Zara's
acquaintances that she had quitted the single state, Mary turned to
her next job, and drove one morning to St. Kilda to inspect John's
house. She went by herself, for she thought John would thank you to
have other eyes than hers quizzing his neglected home. And she was
glad indeed no one else was present when, the coachman having
unlocked the front door and drawn up the blinds for her, she was
free to wander through the deserted rooms. The house had stood
empty almost as long as she had been absent from the colony; and,
in such a climate as this, two years spelt ruin. No window or door
had fitted tightly enough, when hot winds and their accompanying
dust-storms swept the town. The dust crunched gritty underfoot; lay
in a white layer over all tables and polished surfaces; made it
impossible to look out of the windows. The cobwebs that hung from
the corners of the ceilings, and festooned the lustred chandeliers,
were thick as string with it. You could hardly see yourself in the
mirrors for fly-specks, or see the wax flowers under their shades.
Everywhere, in hundreds, flies and blowflies lay dead. Moths had
ravaged each single woollen article she laid hands on. The
beautiful Brussels carpets were eaten into holes, as were also
curtains and bed-hangings, table-covers and the backs of
wool-worked chairs. It was truly a scene of desolation.</p>

<p>In John's bedroom she chanced to open a leaf of the great
triple-fronted mahogany wardrobe, to look if any clothes had been
left hanging to share in the general dilapidation; and there, the
first thing she lighted on was a shawl of "poor Jinny's"&mdash;or
what had once been a shawl, for it was now riddled like a colander,
and all but fell to pieces as she touched it. For a moment Mary
stood lost to her surroundings. What memories that shawl called up!
Of softest white cashmere, with a handsome floral border, it had
been John's present to Jinny on the birth of their first child:
"And if the next's a boy, Jane, I promise you one of richest India
silk, my love!" But, even so, this gift had filled Jinny's cup to
the brim. Mary could only remember it tied up with ribbons in
tissue paper, and smelling of camphor to knock you down&mdash;Jinny
had hardly dared to wear it for fear the dust should discolour it,
or the sun fade the bordering. There had been quite a quarrel one
day, when John and she were staying with them in Ballarat, because
Jinny had visited the Ococks in her second-best. "Far from me be
it, Mary, to inculcate an extravagant spirit in Jane, or encourage
her to run up bills at the milliner's. But she is now my wife, and
it is her duty to dress accordingly," had been John's way of
putting it. Well, poor Jinny, she might just as well have worn her
finery and worn it out...as only have had it on her back some dozen
times in all. She was gone where no shawls were needed.</p>

<p>"It's really a lesson not to hoard one's clothes, but to use and
enjoy them while you can. Not to get anything too grand, either,
which makes it seem a pity to wear."</p>

<p>"John ought to have given all such things away," she aid to
herself a few minutes later. For a nudge of memory had drawn her to
a lumber-room, where four zinc-and-wood saratogas were lined up in
a row. These held all that remained to mortal eyes of "poor Emma."
For Jinny had once soon after marriage confessed to a wild fit of
jealousy, in which she had packed away every scrap of her
predecessor's belongings.&mdash;Fifteen years dead! The things were
now, no doubt, mere rags and tatters, for the box-lid was not made
that could keep out the moth. Some day she, Mary, must make it her
business to run through them, to see if no little enduring thing
was left that could be handed on to Trotty, as a memento of her
long-dead mother.</p>

<p>"Regular Bluebeard's chambers," was Richard's comment, when she
told him of her discoveries.</p>

<p>But Mary had on her thinking-cap, and sat wondering how she
could best reduce John's affairs to order. The house must be opened
up without loss of time, scrubbers and cleaners turned in, painters
and paperhangers and then...A few days later she came home
radiant.</p>

<p>"I've got the very <i>person</i> for John!" and undoing her
bonnet-strings, she threw them back with an air of triumph. It was
a hot November afternoon.</p>

<p>"What!...yet again?" and having kissed her, Mahony laid his book
face downwards and prepared to listen. "Tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"Quite one of the most sensible women I've ever met."</p>

<p>"Then, my dear, you do <i>not</i> mean pretty Fanny!"</p>

<p>For Mary had been out spending a couple of days with the young
pair at Heidelberg, to pay her overdue respects to the cottage of
which she had heard so much.</p>

<p>"It really is a dear little place. And kept in apple-pie
order."</p>

<p>She had soon discovered, though, that the prevailing neatness
and nicety were not the result of any brilliant housewifely
qualities in the little bride. The good genius proved to be an
aunt&mdash;"Auntie Julia"&mdash;who had had charge of the
motherless girl since birth.</p>

<p>"One of those neat, brisk little women, Richard, who do
everything well they put their hands to. Her hair's grey, but she
is not really old. What struck me first was when she said: 'Now
please don't imagine I'm a fixture here, Mrs. Mahony. I just came
to help my little Fan over her first troubles in setting up house.
I don't hold with old aunts&mdash;or mothers
either&mdash;quartering themselves upon the newly wed. Young people
should be left to their own devices. No, poor old Auntie Julia's
job is done; she's permanently out of work.'"</p>

<p>It was here Mary thought she saw a light in John's darkness.
Taking the bull by the horns, she there and then told Miss Julia
the story of her brother's two marriages, and of his vain attempts
to live in peace and harmony with Zara.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow, poor fellow! Dear Mrs. Mahony, I agree with you:
relatives are not the easiest people in the world to get on with.
They are either so much alike that each knows all the time just
what the other is thinking&mdash;and that is fatal; for, if you
won't mind my saying so, the private thoughts we indulge in, even
of our nearest, are not of a fit kind to be made public." ("But
with such a merry twinkle in her eye, Richard, that it took away
anything that might have sounded sharp or biting.") "Or else
brothers and sisters are so different that they might have been
born on different planets."</p>

<p>Mary next enumerated the long line of housekeepers who had
wandered in their day through John's establishment. "In at one
door, and out at the next!"</p>

<p>"Aha! You needn't tell me where the shoe pinched there. I see, I
see. Each of 'em in turn thought she was <i>the</i> one chosen by
fate to fill your poor sister-in-law's place. May I speak frankly?
If I take the post, you may make your mind perfectly easy on that
score. I'm not of the marrying sort. Some men are born to be
bachelors; some women, bless 'em, what's known as old maids. I can
assure you, my dear Mrs. Mahony, I am happiest in the single life.
Nor have I missed a family of my own, for my little Fan here has
been as much mine as though I had borne her." Here, however, seeing
Mary's rather dubious air, she laid a hand on her arm and added
reassuringly: "But don't be afraid, my dear. I do not noise these
views abroad. They're just between you, me and the tea-caddy."</p>

<p>"It was really said very nicely, Richard&mdash;not at all
indelicately."</p>

<p>"All the same, I should give her a hint that such radical ideas
would be fatal to her prospects with his lordship," said Mahony,
who had recently smarted anew under his brother-in-law's
heavy-handed patronage.</p>

<p>"She won't talk like that to a <i>man</i>. And I feel sure I'm
right; she's the very person."</p>

<p>And so she was. No sooner had John, on Mary's recommendation,
made definite arrangements with Miss Julia than tangles seemed to
straighten of themselves. Hers was a master mind. In less than no
time the house was cleaned, renovated, repaired; efficient servants
were engaged; John was transferred from his uncomfortable Club
quarters to a comfortable domesticity. And Miss Julia proved
herself of an exquisite tact in running the establishment, in
meeting John's wishes, in agreeing with him without yielding a jot
of her own convictions. And thereafter John &mdash;"He couldn't, of
course, let the credit for the changed state of affairs go out of
the family!"&mdash;John went about singing Mary's praises, and
congratulating himself on being the possessor of so capable a
sister.</p>

<p>Next, Jinny's three mites were brought home from boarding
school; and together Mary and Miss Julia stripped them of their
"uniforms," undid their meagre little rats'-tails, and freed their
little bodies from the stiff corsets in which even the infant
Josephine was encased. Three pleasant-faced, merry-eyed little
girls emerged, who soon learned to laugh and play again, and filled
the dead house with the life it needed. They adored Auntie Julia:
and were adored by their father as of old.</p>

<p>There remained only Trotty&mdash;or Emmy, as she was now called.
Mary had confabbed with Miss Julia, and they had shaken their heads
in unison over John's extraordinary attitude towards his first
family. But, on meeting the girl, Miss Julia struck her palms
together and cried: "What! stand out against <i>that?</i>...my
dear, have <i>no</i> fear! Just let your brother grow used to
seeing such a daughter opposite him at breakfast, and he'll soon
miss her if she chances to be absent. <i>Exactly</i> what he needs
to preside over his dinner-table. It shall be my task to train her
for the post."</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, Mary kept Emmy at her own side, in
order to renew acquaintance with one she had known so well as a
child.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-4" id="ch-2-2-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>Emmy also served to fill a gap.</p>

<p>As always when forced to live at haphazard, without a fixed
routine, Mahony was restless and ill at ease. He had not even a
comfortable room to retire to: his present den was the dull little
back parlour of a town house. Books, too, he came very short in; it
did not seem worth while unpacking those he had brought out with
him; and the newly ordered volumes could not be expected to arrive
for months to come. Nor did he see much of Mary: what time she had
to spare from her relatives was spent in endless discussions with
decorators and upholsterers.</p>

<p>The company of his young niece was thus a real boon to him. Emmy
had no obligations, was free to go with him when and where he
chose. What was more, with neither the cares of a family nor of
house-furnishing on her mind, her thoughts never strayed. And a
sound friendship sprang up between the oddly matched pair. No
longer afraid of her uncle, Emmy displayed a gentle, saucy,
laughing humour. Mahony hired a little horse for her and they rode
out together, she pinned up in Mary's old habit; rode out early of
a morning while other people were still fast asleep. Their
destination was invariably the new house, to see what progress had
been made since the day before: holding her habit high, Emmy would
run from room to room, exclaiming. Thence they followed quiet,
sandy tracks that led through stretches of heath and gorse to the
sea. Or they strolled on foot, Emmy hanging on her uncle's arm and
chattering merrily: a simple-hearted, unaffected girl, as natural
as she was pretty, which was saying a good deal, for she promised
to be a regular beauty. "Strawberries and cream" was Mahony's name
for her. She had inherited her mother's ripe-corn fairness and
limpid, lash-swept eyes; but the wildrose complexion of the
English-born woman had here been damped to palest cream, in which,
as a striking contrast, stood out two lovely lips of a vivid
carnation-red&mdash;a daring touch on the part of nature that
already drew men's eyes as she passed. In person, she was soft and
round and womanly. But the broad little hands with their slyly
bitten nails were still half a child's. She was childishly
unconscious too, of her attractions, innocent in the use to which
she put them; and blushed helplessly did any one remark on her
appearance&mdash;as the outspoken people who surrounded her were
only too apt to do. Without being in the least clever, she had a
bright open mind, and drank in with interest all Mahony could give
her: tales of his travels or of the early days; descriptions of
books and plays; little homilies on the wonders of nature. If he
had a fault to find with her, it was that she seemed just as
sweetly grateful for, say, "Auntie Julia's" enjoinders how to hold
her crotchet-needle, or hints on dress and deportment, as to him
for his deeper lore. Yes, the child had an artless and inborn
desire to please, and dissipated her favours in a manner that
belonged very surely to her age...and her sex. For he might say
"child," but let him remember that his own little Polly-Mary had
been but a couple of months older, when he ran her off from among
her playmates and friends.</p>

<p>Altogether there was much about John's daughter&mdash;no! not
thus would he put it&mdash;about Mary's niece, that reminded him of
Mary herself, as a little mouse of a bride long years ago. And not
the least striking point of resemblance was this whole-hearted
surrender of attention. It would, of course, be unreasonable to
expect the faculty to persist: life in its course brought, to even
the fondest of wives, distractions, cares and interests of her own.
But there was no denying it, this lack of preoccupation it was,
this freedom&mdash;even emptiness if you would&mdash;of mind, into
which oneself poured the contents, that rendered a very young woman
so delightful a companion.</p>

<p>And when, at length, the move to the new house was made, and
Mahony set about unpacking, arranging and cataloguing the books he
had, and planning where those to come should be shelved, Emmy was
still his right hand. Mary, busy with strange servants, with the
stocking of kitchen and larder, could do no more than occasionally
look in to see how the two of them were getting on, and keep them
supplied with refreshment. Good-naturedly she yielded Emmy entirely
to Richard, who now passed to overhauling his minerals, plants and
butterflies, all of which had made the journey to England with him
and back. And glass cases, stacks of blotting-paper and sheets of
cork were set up afresh in this big, pleasant room, the windows of
which looked down a vista cut through spreading oleanders to where,
in the orchard, peach and almond-blossom vied in pinkness against a
pale blue sky.</p>

<p>But it was not very long before Emmy was spirited away to grace
her father's table. Then, his own affairs in order, domestic
appointments running smoothly, Mahony drove out with Mary in the
neat brougham he had given her, to return some of the visits that
had been paid them. Later on, too, he accompanied her to dinners,
balls and soirees; or played the host at his own table, which Mary
soon filled with guests.</p>

<p>The society in which they here found themselves had a variety
and a breadth about it that put it on a very different footing from
either the narrow Ballarat circle of earlier years, or the medieval
provincialism into which they had stumbled overseas. And moments
came when, squarely facing the facts, Mahony admitted to himself he
might go farther and fare worse: in other words, that he could now
never hope to know anything better. The most diverse tastes were
catered for. There was the ultra-fashionable set that revolved
round Government House and the vice-regal entertainments; that
covered the lawns at Flemington and Caulfield; drove out in
splendid four and six-in-hands to champagne picnics at Yan Yean;
overflowed the dress circle at the Theatre Royal, where Bandmann
was appearing in his famous roles; the ladies decked for all
occasions&mdash;lawn, theatre, picnics, dusty streets
alike&mdash;in the flimsiest and costliest of robes. At the head of
this aristocracy of wealth stood those primitive settlers the great
squatter-kings, owners of sheep-runs that counted up to a hundred
thousand acres: men whose incomes were so vast that they hardly
knew how to dispense them, there existing here no art treasures to
empty the purse, nor any taste to buy them had they existed.
Neither did travel tempt these old colonists, often of humble
origin, whose prime had been spent buried in the bush; while it had
not yet become the fashion to educate sons and daughters "at
home."</p>

<p>Since, however, fortunes were still notoriously
precarious&mdash;flood or fire could ruin a man overnight&mdash;and
since, too, the sense of uncertainty that characterised the early
days had bitten too deep ever to be got out of the blood, "spend
while you may" remained the motto men lived by. And this led to a
reckless extravagance that had not its equal. Women lavished money
on dress, which grew to be a passion in this fair climate; on
jewellery with which to behang their persons; on fantastic
entertainments; men drank, betted, gambled; while horse-racing had
already become, with both sexes, the obsession it was to remain.
This stylish set&mdash;it also included fabulously lucky
speculators, as well as the great wool-buyers&mdash;Mahony did not
do much more than brush in passing. His sympathies inclined rather
to that which revolved round the trusty prelate who, having guided
the destinies of the Church through the ups and downs of its
infancy, now formed a pivot for the intellectual interests of the
day&mdash;albeit of a somewhat non-progressive, anti-modern kind.
Still, the atmosphere that prevailed in the pleasant rooms at
Bishopscourt was the nearest thing to be found to the urbane,
unworldly air of English university or cathedral life. Next in
order came the legal luminaries, Irishmen for the most part, with
keen, ugly faces and scathingly witty tongues; men whose enormous
experience made them the best of good company. And to this clique
belonged also the distinguished surgeons and physicians of the
eastern hill; the bankers, astutest of financiers; with, for spice,
the swiftly changing politicians of the moment, here one day, gone
the next, with nothing but their ideas or their energy to recommend
them, and dragging with them wives married in their working
days...well, the less said of the wives the better.</p>

<p>Such was the society in which Mahony was now called on to take
his place. And the result was by so much the most vivid expression
of his personality he had yet succeeded in giving, that it became
<i>the</i> one that imprinted itself on men's minds, to the
confusion of what had gone before and was to come after: became the
reality from which his mortal shadow was thrown.&mdash;"Mahony?"
would be the query in later years. "Mahony? Ah yes, of course, you
mean Townshend-Mahony of 'Ultima Thule,'" this being the name he
had bestowed on his new house.&mdash;Mary regarded him fondly and
with pride. Certain it was, no matter in what circle she moved,
whose dinner-table he sat at, whose hearthrug he stood on, he was
by far the most distinguished-looking man in the room. And not only
this: a kind of mellowness now descended on him, a new tolerance
with his fellowmen. The lines of work and worry disappeared; he
filled out both in face and figure, and loved to tease Mary by
declaring he was on the high road to growing fat. He brushed up his
musical accomplishments, too; and his pleasant tenor, his skill as
a flute-player, brought him into fresh demand. Miss Timms-Kelly,
Judge Kelly's daughter, who had quite the finest amateur voice in
Melbourne, was heard to say she preferred Richard's second in a
duet to any other; and many an elaborate aria, full of shakes and
trills, did she warble to his <i>obbligato</i> on the flute.</p>

<p>How happy all this made Mary, she could not have told. To know
Richard even moderately contented would have satisfied her; to see
him actually taking pleasure in life caused her Cup to run over.
She had now not a care left, hardly a wish unfulfilled. And she
showed it. The eclipse in health and good looks she had suffered by
reason of her transplantation was past: never had she felt better
than at present; while in appearance she bloomed anew&mdash;enjoyed
a kind of Indian summer. At thirty-two, an age when, in the trying
climate of the colony, a woman was, as often as not, hopelessly
faded, Mary did not need to fear comparison with ladies ten years
her junior. Her skin was still flawless, eye as brilliant, her hair
as glossy as of old. In figure she inclined to the statuesque,
without being either too tall or too full: arms and shoulders were
unsurpassed in their rounded whiteness. A certain breadth of brow
alone prevented her, at this stage of her life, from being classed
among the acknowledged beauties of her sex: it lent her a
thoughtful air, where she should have been merely
pleasing.&mdash;But, after all, what did this matter? Her real
beauty, as Richard often reflected, consisted in the warmth and
loving-kindness that beamed from her eyes, illuminating a face
which never a malicious thought had twisted or deformed. Her
expression was, of course, no more one of utter
unsuspicion&mdash;experience had seen to that&mdash;just as her
mind was no longer afflicted with the adorable blindness that had
been its leading trait in girlhood. Mary now knew very well that
evil existed, and that mortals were prone to it. But she would not
allow that it could be inborn; held fast to her unconquerable
belief in the innate goodness of every living soul; and was never
at a loss to exonerate the sinner. "No wonder he's what he is,
after the life he has been forced to lead. We mightn't have turned
out any better ourselves, with his temptations." Or: "She has never
had a chance, poor thing! Circumstances have always been against
her."</p>

<p>With her anxieties on Richard's behalf, Mary's ambitions for
him&mdash;that he should climb the tree, make a name&mdash;also
gradually sank to rest. Her mind was thus at liberty to follow its
own bent. Fond though she was of her fellow-creatures, the formal
round of social life had never made a very deep appeal to her: she
liked to see people merry and enjoying themselves, but she herself
needed something more active to engross her. Her house, well
staffed, well run, claimed only a fraction of her attention. Hence
she had plenty of time to devote herself to what Richard called her
true mission in life: the care of others&mdash;especially of the
poor and suffering, the unhappy and unsure. And many a heart was
lightened by having Mary to lean on, her strong common sense for a
guide. Her purse, too, was an unending solace. Even in the latter
years in Ballarat, she had had to dispense her charities carefully,
balancing one against another. Now her income was equal to all the
calls made on it...and more...Richard generously bidding her add to
her own pin-money anything left over from the handsome cheque he
gave her for housekeeping expenses. And since he, mindful of his
promise, never inquired what she did with it, she was at last free
to give as royally as she chose...in any direction. But if he did
not ask to see her pass-book, neither did she see his: he would not
have her troubling her head, he said, about their general
expenditure. At first she rather demurred at this: she would have
liked to know how their outlay per month tallied with the sum at
their disposal; and she missed the talks they had been used to
have, about how best to portion out their income. But Richard said
those days were over and done with: she would lose her way, he
teased her, among sums of four figures&mdash;for, in a twinkling,
his late-found affluence had thrown him back on the traditional
idea that money affairs were the man's province, not the woman's.
For her comfort, he stressed once more the fact that he did not
intend to speculate; also that at long last, he would, despite the
enormous premium, be able to insure his life. In the event of
anything happening to him, she would be well provided for, and thus
might spend what he gave her freely and without scruple. Yielding
to these persuasions, Mary acquiesced in the new arrangement, and
gradually slipped into the delightful habit of taking money for
granted. After all, the confidence was mutual: he trusted her not
to run up bills at milliner's or jeweller's; she, too, had to trust
in her turn. She valued his faith in her, and was careful not to
abuse it. Her own accounts were scrupulously kept: just as in the
old days, she wrote down every shilling she spent, and knitted her
brows over the halfpennies; with the result that she soon began to
accumulate a tidy little nest-egg.</p>

<p>Her charities were her sole extravagance, her personal wants
remaining few and simple. Besides, Richard was for ever making her
presents. It could not be said of him that his tastes did not
expand with his purse. He put his men-servants into livery, stocked
his cellars, bought silver table-appliances and egg-shell china,
had his crest stamped wherever it could find a place. And the
things he bought for her were of the same costly nature. In
addition to the carriage, which she had to admit was both useful
and necessary, his gifts included jewellery (which she wore more to
please him than because she had any real liking for it)&mdash;rings
and chains, brooches and bracelets&mdash;all things <i>his</i> wife
ought to have and never had had: curling ostrich feathers for hat
and fan; gold-mounted mother-of-pearl opera-glasses; hand-painted
fans; carved ivory card-cases; ivory-backed brushes and silver
vinaigrettes: any fal-lal, in short, that struck his eye or caught
his fancy.</p>

<p>There came a day on which he fairly outdid himself. Soon after
inscribing their names in the visiting-book at Government House,
they received invitations to a ball there, in honour of two
men-of-war that were anchored in the Bay&mdash;a very select affair
indeed: none of your promiscuous May Day crushes! As it would be
their first appearance in style, Mahony&mdash;a trifle uncertain
whether Mary would do the thing handsomely enough&mdash;insisted on
fitting her out. The pale blue silk he chose for her gown was
finest Lyons, the cost of which, without making, ran to thirty
pounds: Mary had never seen a silk like it. It was got privatim
through John, who had it direct from the French factory. John, too,
was responsible for the crowning glory of Mary's attire. For after
Richard had added a high, pearl-studded Spanish comb for her hair,
John one day showed him a wonderful shawl that had just come into
the warehouse, suggesting it would look well on Mary. And for once
Mahony found himself in agreement with his brother-in-law. Of
softest cashmere, supple as silk&mdash;and even softer to the
touch&mdash;the scarlet ground of the shawl was well-nigh hidden by
a massive white Indian embroidery; so that the impression gained
was one of sumptuous white silk, broken by flecks of red. It was
peaked, burnous-like, to form a hood, and this and the corners were
hung with heavy white silk tassels. So magnificent an affair was it
that Mary had severe qualms about wearing it: in her heart she
considered it far too showy and elaborate. But Richard had no doubt
paid an enormous price for it, and would be hurt into the bargain
if she said what she thought.</p>

<p>He himself was charmed with the effect, when she draped it over
the sky-blue of the gown. "Upon my word, my dear, you'll put every
other woman in the shade!"</p>

<p>But even he was not prepared for the stir that ran through the
ballroom on their arrival. In among the puces and magentas, the
rose-budded pinks and forget-me-notted blues came Mary, trailing a
bit of oriental splendour, and wearing it, as only she could, with
a queenly yet unconscious air. Seated on a dais among the
matrons&mdash;for nowadays she danced only an occasional "square,"
leaving round dances to the young&mdash;Mary drew the fire of all
eyes.</p>

<p>And it was not the opera-cloak alone.</p>

<p>"A skin like old Florentine ivory!" declared an Englishman fresh
from "home." The guest of the Governor, he was wandering through
this colonial assembly much as a musical connoisseur might wander
through a cattle-yard. Till Mary caught his eye...And when she
dropped the cloak, for the honour of a quadrille with his
Excellency, this same visitor was heard to dilate on the tints cast
by the blue on the ivory...to murmur of Goya...Velasquez.</p>

<p>Subsequently he was introduced, and sat by her side for the
better part of an hour.</p>

<p>At two o'clock, when Mahony handed her to the carriage, it was
with something of the lover-like elan that even the least fond
husband feels on seeing his wife the centre of attraction.</p>

<p>"Now, madam!...wasn't I right? Who was the success of the
evening I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard...Put up the window, dear, it's cold. If there can
be any talk of a success...then it's the cloak you mean, not
me."</p>

<p>"It took you to carry it off, love. Not another woman in the
room could have done it. Made it seem very well worth the price I
had to pay for it."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me, you haven't yet told me what that was."</p>

<p>"My business, sweetheart! Yours to play the belle and get
compared to the old masters by admiring strangers."</p>

<p>"<i>Really</i>, Richard!" Mary made the deprecating movement of
the chin with which she was wont to rebuke extravagances. "Why,
dear, he was so high-falutin I didn't know half the time what he
was talking about." Then fearing she had been too severe, she
added: "Of course I'm very glad you were pleased,"&mdash;and hoped
that was the end of it. Compliments, even from one's husband, were
things to be evaded if possible. "Well, I must remember poor Jinny
and not hoard it up for the moths to get at." But there was more
than a dash of doubt in Mary's tone, and she sighed. Not merely for
Jinny. She did not know when another opportunity so splendid as
this evening's would arise. For an ordinary one, such finery would
certainly be out of place.</p>

<p>"Wear it or not as you please, love. It has served its
end...stamped itself on a moment of time," said Mahony; and fell
therewith into a brown study.</p>

<p>But as he helped her from the carriage he stooped and kissed
her...which Mary was very much afraid the coachman saw.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-5" id="ch-2-2-5"></a>Chapter V</h3>

<p>Than queening it at balls, she felt more in her element seated
in a rather dingily furnished drawing-room, holding poor Agnes
Ocock's hand. Although it had struck five and the worst heat of the
day was over, Agnes was still in her bedgown&mdash;she had been
lying down with the headache, she said&mdash;nor could Mary
persuade her to exchange this for bonnet and shawl, and drive out
with her in the brougham that stood at the door.</p>

<p>"Another time, dearest, if you do not mind. To-day I have no
fancy for it."</p>

<p>Mary was shocked by the change the past six months had worked in
her friend; and disagreeably impressed by the common-featured house
in which she found her: it had no garden, but stood right on the
dusty St. Kilda Parade. Agnes was growing very stout; her fine skin
looked as creased as her robe, her cheek was netted with veins, her
hair thin, under a cap set awry. Mary knew the rumours that were
current; and her heart swelled with pity.</p>

<p>"Just as you like, dear. And how are the children? Are they in?
May I see them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, the children. Why...the truth is, dearest Mary, I
haven't...they are not with me. Henry thought...he thought..."</p>

<p>Agnes's voice broke, and after a painful struggle to compose
herself she hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Leaning forward Mary laid an arm round her shoulders. "Dearest
Agnes, won't you tell me your trouble? Is it the little one
you...you lost, you are fretting over?"</p>

<p>And now there was no sound in the room but that of
crying&mdash;and such crying! It seemed difficult to connect these
heavy nerve-racking sobs with the lovely, happy little Agnes of
former days. Holding her close, Mary let her weep unstintedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, Mary! I am the most miserable creature alive."</p>

<p>Yes, it was the loss of the child that was breaking her
heart...or rather the way in which she had lost it.</p>

<p>"It was the finest baby you ever saw, Mary&mdash;neither of the
others could compare with it. They were all very well; but this
one...His tiny limbs were so round and smooth&mdash;it was like
kissing velvet. And dimples everywhere. And he was born with a head
of golden hair. I never knew Henry so pleased. He said such a child
did me credit...and this used rather to make me wonder, Mary; for
Baby wasn't a bit like Henry...or like the other two. He took after
my family and had blue eyes. But do you know who he reminded me of
most of all? It was of Eddie, Mary...and through Eddie of Mr.
Glendinning. When Eddie was born he used to lie in my lap, just as
soft and fair...and sometimes I think I forgot, and imagined this
baby <i>was</i> Eddie over again...and that made me still fonder of
him; for one's first is one's first, love, no matter how many come
after. And then...then...He was five months old, and beginning to
try to grasp things and take notice&mdash;oh, such a happy babe!
And then one morning, I wasn't feeling well, Mary&mdash;the doctor
said the nursing of such a hearty child was a great strain on me;
then a giddy fit took me&mdash;I had been giving him the breast and
got up to lay him down&mdash;nurse wasn't there. I must have been
dizzy with sitting so long stooped over him&mdash;and he was heavy
for his age. I got up and came over faint all of a sudden&mdash;the
doctor says so...and I tottered, Mary, and Baby fell&mdash;fell out
of my arms...on his little head&mdash;I heard the thud&mdash;yes,
the thud...but not a cry or a sound...nothing...nothing...he never
cried again."</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor Agnes! Oh, you poor, poor thing!"</p>

<p>Mary was weeping, too; the tears ran down her cheeks. But she
made no attempt to palliate or console; did not speak of an
accident for which it was impossible to blame yourself; or of God's
will, mysterious, inscrutable: she just grieved, with an intensity
of feeling that made her one with the bereft. Things of this kind
went too deep for words; were hurts from which there could be no
recovery. Time might grow its moss over them...hide them from
mortal sight...that was all.</p>

<p>As she drove home she reflected, pitifully, how strange it was
that so soft and harmless a creature as Agnes should thus be
singled out for some of life's hardest blows. Agnes had so surely
been born for happiness&mdash;and to make others happy. Misfortunes
such as these ought to be kept for people of stronger, harder
natures and with broader backs; who could suffer and still carry
their heads high. Agnes was merely crushed to earth by them...like
a poor little trampled flower.</p>

<p>But before she reached the house, a fearful suspicion crossed
her mind.</p>

<p>Tilly nodded confirmingly.</p>

<p>"The plain English of it is, she was squiffy."</p>

<p>And went on: "It was hushed up, my dear, you bet!&mdash;kept
dark as the grave...doctor changed, etc. etc. They actually 'ad the
face to put it down to the nurse's carelessness: said nurse being
packed off at once, <i>handsomely remunerated</i>, mind you, to
hold 'er tongue. An' a mercy the child died; the doctor seemed to
think it might 'ave been soft, 'ad it lived&mdash;after such a
knock on the pate&mdash;and can you see Henry dragging the village
idiot at 'is heels? <i>never</i> was a man in such a fury, Mary.
Ugh! that white face with those little pitch-black eyes rolling
round in it&mdash;it gave me the fair shakes to look at 'im. 'Pon
my word I believe, if 'e'd dared, 'e'd 'ave slaughtered Agnes there
and then. His child, <i>his</i> son!&mdash;you know the tune of it.
'E'll never forgive 'er, mark my words he won't!...the disgrace and
all that&mdash;for of course everybody knew all about it and a good
deal more. She was odd enough beforehand, never going anywhere. Now
she's taking the sea-air at St. Kilda, and, if you ask me, she'll
go on taking it...till Doomsday."</p>

<p>"The very way to drive her to despair!" cried Mary; and
burned.</p>

<p>Tilly shrugged. "It's six of one and 'alf a dozen of the other
to my mind. I'd almost rather be put away to rot like a poisoned
rat in a hole, than live under the whip of Mossieu Henry's
tongue&mdash;not to mention 'is eye!"</p>

<p>"Agnes shall not die like a rat in a hole if I can help it."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you can't, my dear!...don't make any mistake about
that. You might as well try to bend a bar of iron as
'Enry.&mdash;And I must say, Mary, it does sometimes seem a good
deal of fuss to make over one small kid. She can 'ave more for the
asking."</p>

<p>"<i>Tilly!</i>" Mary looked up from her sewing&mdash;the two
women sat on the verandah of Tilly's house in Ballarat, where Mary
was visiting&mdash;in reproof and surprise at a speech so unlike
her friend. It was not the first either; Tilly often wore a mopy,
world-weary air nowadays, which did not sit naturally on her. "Each
child that lives is just itself," added Mary. "That's why one loves
it so."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I s'pose so. And as you know, love, I'd 'ave 'ad a
dozen if I could. It wouldn't 'ave been one too many to fill this
'ouse."</p>

<p>Mary believed she read the answer to the riddle. "Look here,
Tilly, you're lonely...that's what's the matter with you."</p>

<p>And Tilly nodded, dumpily&mdash;again unlike herself.</p>

<p>"Fact is, Mary, I want something to <i>do</i>. As long as dear
old Pa lived, and I 'ad the boys to look after, it was all
right&mdash;I never knew what it was to be dull. But now...P'r'aps
if they'd let me keep Tom and Johnny...or if I could groom my own
'orses or ride 'em at the stakes...No, no, of course, I know it
wouldn't do&mdash;or be <i>commy faut</i>. It's only my gab."</p>

<p>"I wonder, Tilly," said Mary, "I wonder if...have you never
thought, dear, at times like these that...that perhaps you might
some day marry again?" She put the question very tentatively,
knowing Tilly's robust contempt for the other sex.</p>

<p>But Tilly answered pat: "Why, that's just what I 'ave,
Mary."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mary. And to cover up her amazement, added: "I think
it would be the very best thing that could happen."</p>

<p>There followed a pause of some length. Mary did not know what to
make of it. Tilly was humming and hawing: she fidgeted, coloured,
shifted her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," she said at length, in answer to Mary's
invitation to speak out: "I <i>Have</i> something on my
chest...something I want to say to you, Mary, and yet don't quite
know, 'ow. Fact is, I want you to do me a good turn, my dear. No,
now just you wait a jiff, till you 'ear what it is. Tell you what,
Mary, I've found meself regularly down in the mouth of
late&mdash;off me grub&mdash;and that sort of thing. No, Pa's death
has nothing whatever to do with it. I was getting on
famously&mdash;right as a trivet&mdash;till...well, till I went to
town&mdash;yes, that time, you know, to meet you and the doctor."
And as Mary still sat blank and uncomprehending, she blurted out:
"Oh, well...till I saw...oh, <i>you</i> know!&mdash;till I met a
<i>Certain Person</i> again."</p>

<p>"A certain person? Do you...Tilly! Oh, Tilly, do you
<i>really?</i> Purdy?"</p>

<p>Tilly nodded, heavily, gloomily, without the ghost of a smile.
"Yes, it's a fact&mdash;and not one I'm proud of either, as you can
guess. And yet again I ask meself why not? I need some one to look
after, Mary...and that's the truth. 'E'S down on <i>his</i> luck,
as always; can't get the money to stick; and I've more than I know
what to do with. And to see 'im there, lookin' so poor and shabby,
and yet keeping 'is pecker up as 'e did&mdash;why, I dunno, but it
seemed some'ow to 'urt me <i>'ere!</i>"&mdash;and Tilly, her
aitches scattering more wildly than usual under the stress of her
emotion, laid her hands, one over the other, on her left
breast.</p>

<p>"But Tilly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! now don't go and but me, Polly, like the dear good soul you
are and always 'ave been. If you mean, am I going to let 'im make
ducks and drakes of poor old Pa's money, I can truly say
no&mdash;no fear! Not this child. But...well...look 'ere, Mary, I
'aven't spit out the whole truth yet. You'll laugh at what I'm
going to tell you, and well you may do; it sounds rum enough. But
you know they do say old folks fall to playing again with toys,
cuddling dolls and whittling chips. Well, a <i>Certain Person</i>
'ad a bit of hair, Poll, that used to curl behind 'is
ear&mdash;many and many's the time in the old spoony days I've sat
and twiddled it round me finger. Now, 'is hair's wearing thin on
top, but the curl's still there&mdash;and I...would you believe
it?...yes, I'm blessed if my finger didn't itch to be at it again.
And what's worse, <i>has</i> itched ever since. 'Ere I go, properly
in the dumps and the doldrums, and feeling as if nothing 'ull ever
matter much any more if I can't. Oh, there's no fool like an old
fool, Mary love!...and nobody knows that better than the old fool
'im&mdash;herself."</p>

<p>"Oh come, Tilly, you're not quite so ancient as you try to make
out! As to what you say...it's been the living alone and all that,
it's come of."</p>

<p>But though she spoke in a reassuring tone, Mary was none the
less genuinely perturbed: her robust, sensible Tilly reduced to
such a foolish state! Why, it was like seeing one's dearest friend
collapse under a sudden illness.</p>

<p>"P'r'aps. And p'r'aps not. But what I want you to do for me, old
girl, is this. Ask me down to stop for a bit, and ask him to the
house while I'm there. The rest I'll manage for myself. Only you
won't let on to the doctor, will you, love, what I've told you? I
don't want the doctor to know. 'E'd look down 'is nose at me with
that queer look of his&mdash;no, I couldn't stand it, Poll! Henry,
too&mdash;I shall keep 'Enry in the dark till it's too late. 'E'd
raise Cain. For, of course 'e thinks what Pa left's safe to come to
his brats. While, if I fix things up as I want 'em"&mdash;she
lowered her voice&mdash;"I may 'ave kids of my own yet."</p>

<p>"Indeed and I hope so...from the bottom of my heart."</p>

<p>Tell Richard? No, indeed! As that same afternoon Mary drove in
Tilly's double buggy down the dusty slope of Sturt Street, and out
over the Flat, she imagined to herself what Richard would
say&mdash;and think&mdash;did she make him partner in Tilly's
confidences. What?...try to trap a man, and an old friend to boot,
into a loveless marriage, merely because you want to twist a bit of
hair round your finger? He would snort with disgust at such
folly...besides thinking it indelicate into the bargain. As she was
afraid she, Mary, did a little, too. The difference was: she saw,
as he never would, that loneliness was at the bottom of it;
loneliness, and the want of some one to care for, or, as Tilly put
it, of something to do. It might also be that the old girlish
inclination had never quite died out, but only slumbered through
all these years. Not that that would count with Richard; indeed, it
might count in just the opposite way. For he was more than
straitlaced where things of this kind were in question; had a
constitutional horror of them; and he would not consider it at all
nice for the seeds of an old attachment to have stayed alive in
you, while you were happily married to some one else. Another
point: if Purdy yielded to the temptation and took Tilly and her
money, Richard might always think less well of him for doing so;
which would be a thousand pities, now a first move towards a
reconciliation had been made. Whereas if the engagement seemed to
come about of itself...And in this respect there was really
something to be said for it. Purdy once married and settled, the
foolish barrier that had grown up between the two men would fall
away, and they again become the friends they had been of old.</p>

<p>Reasoning thus, Mary arrived at a row of mean little
weatherboard houses, in one of which Ned lived. She did not knock,
but stepped across the verandah, turned the door-knob and went down
the passage. It was a Monday, and washing day. The brick floor of
the kitchen overflowed with water, in which the young fry played.
Polly, turning from the tubs, ran her hands down her arms to sluice
off the lather, before extending them, all moist and crinkled, in
an embrace. By the copper sat Ned&mdash;poor Ned&mdash;convalescent
from the attack of acute bronchitis which had brought Mary in hot
haste to Ballarat a few weeks previously. Ned's chest and shoulders
were wrapped up in an old red flannel petticoat, pinned under the
chin; his feet, well out of the damp's way on an upturned
sugar-box, were clad in down-at-heel felt slippers. His thick
ringletty hair and curly beard hung long and unkempt above the
scarlet drapery, forming a jet-black aureole from which his face,
chastened to a new delicacy, looked out beautiful as a cameo.</p>

<p>Pouncing on Mary he talked volubly, in the hoarse whisper that
was all the voice his illness had left him. It was the same old
Ned, holding forth in the same old way: on the luck that had always
been against him, the fair chance he had never yet had; man and
theme lit up by the same unquenchable optimism. He had to-day a
yarn to tell of the fortune he might have made, not three months
back, had he only at the critical moment been able to lay hands on
the needful: men had gone in and won who had not a quarter of his
flair. How much of this was truth and how much imagination, Mary
did not know or greatly care&mdash;unlike Polly who, rasped beyond
measure, clicked an angry tongue and lashed out at Ned's "atrocious
lies."</p>

<p>Striving to keep the peace by dropping in soothing words, Mary
sat and pondered how best these poor souls could be helped. On the
voyage out, she had seriously considered adopting one&mdash;perhaps
even two&mdash;of the black-haired brood. But again Polly made
short work of the suggestion. Not even to Mary whom she dearly
loved, would she give up her children.</p>

<p>"They're me own and I'll stick to 'em, come what may! For
they're all I've got, dearie...all I'll ever get from the whole
galumphing galoot." With which Mary was forced to agree; and though
seven lived and a ninth was on the way.</p>

<p>Nor could Polly be induced to part from them even for the
benefit of their education.</p>

<p>"Ta, love, you mean it kindly, but I'll not have 'em brought up
above their station. They're a working-man's kids, and such they'll
remain. Besides, you may be sure there'll be <i>some</i> of Ned's
blowfly notions in some of their heads. And the State School's the
best place to knock such nonsense out of 'em." Which, duly reported
by Mary, Richard said was a gross example of parental selfishness.
What right had a mother to stand in the way of her offspring? No
child with any true affection would grow up to despise his parents.
On the contrary, as he understood the sacrifice they had made for
him, his love for them would deepen and increase. But this was just
Richard's high-flown way of looking at things.</p>

<p>No, what Ned and Polly wanted was money, and money alone. This
piece of knowledge was accompanied, however, by so disagreeable a
sensation that Mary was thankful Richard was not there to share it.
Not only were they ready to take every shilling offered...poor
things, no one could blame them for that, pinched and straitened as
they were...it was their manner of accepting that wounded Mary.
They pocketed what Richard sent them almost as a matter of course,
frankly inspecting the amount, and sometimes even going so far as
to wrinkle their noses over it. Which was really hardly fair; for
Richard was very generous to them; considering they were no blood
relations of his, and he felt they didn't like him. Nor did they:
there was no getting away from that; they showed it even to the
extent of begrudging him his good luck...without which he would
have been unable to do anything for them! Poor Ned's eye was hot
with envy whenever Richard's rise in the world was mentioned. While
Polly alluded to it with an open sneer.</p>

<p>"I say, <i>infra dig.</i> isn't it and no mistake, for a heavy
swell like he is, to have such low-down connections...people who
take in other people's washing!"</p>

<p>Mary could not bring herself to sit in judgment on them: for all
his tall talk, Ned had never harmed a fly; and Polly's was just a
generous nature warped and twisted by poverty and an imprudent
marriage. All the same she took great pains not to let Richard know
how the wind blew. Her letters to him, on Ned and Polly's behalf,
were full of the warm gratitude she herself would have felt had she
stood in their shoes.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-6" id="ch-2-2-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>For the first time in his life Mahony found himself in
possession of all the books he wanted: rare books hard to get;
expensive books he had till now never felt justified in buying. And
Mary, his social conscience, being absent, he fell into depths of
abstraction from which there was nothing to rouse him.</p>

<p>His two old arch-enemies time and money&mdash;or rather the lack
of them&mdash;had definitely ceased to plague him. His leisure was
unbounded, the morrow well provided for, and the material comfort
of his present surroundings such as he had hitherto known only in
dreams. No domestic sounds rasped his ear, scattered his attention;
his spacious study, book-lined from ceiling to floor, stood apart
from the rest of the house, and was solidly built. Was cool and
airy, too; even in the heat of midday he caught a whiff of the sea.
The garden with its shrubberies and lawns of buffalo-grass, its
spreading figtrees and dark firs, rested and refreshed the eye. His
meals appeared on the table as by clockwork, served as he liked
them, cooked to a turn. And so greatly did the hermit's life he now
led jump with his mood, that invitations to social functions grew
fly-spotted on the chimney-shelf, or were swept up by the housemaid
from the floor.</p>

<p>He first undertook to examine the great moderns: those
world-famous scientists and their philosophic spokesmen who
dominated the intellectual life of the day. So far he had read
their works only in snatches, and at random. He now re-read them
systematically; followed step by step the presentment of their
monumental theories&mdash;the idea of evolution, the origin of
species, the antiquity of man&mdash;as well as the constructive or
subversive conclusions deduced therefrom.</p>

<p>Thus weeks passed. At the end of this time&mdash;Mary being
still from home &mdash;he emerged heavy-eyed and a trifle dazed,
from sittings protracted late into the night, and paused to take
his bearings. And it was now, on looking back over what he had
read, that he became aware of a feeling of dissatisfaction. Chiefly
with regard to the mental attitude of the writers themselves. So
sound were their arguments that they might well, he thought, have
refrained from the pontifical airs they saw fit to adopt; having
been a shade less intolerant of views and beliefs that did not
dovetail with their own. Riding on the crest of the highest wave of
materialism that had ever broken over the world, they themselves
were satisfied that life and its properties could be explained, to
the last iota, in terms of matter; and, dogmatically pronouncing
their interpretation of the universe to be the only valid one, they
laid a crushing veto on any suggestion of a possible spiritual
agency. Here it was, he parted company with them. For the same
thing had surely happened before, in the world's history, bodies of
learned men arising at various epochs in divers lands, and claiming
to have solved the great riddle once and for all? Over and above
this, did Huxley's inflamed outbursts against the "cosmogony of the
semi-barbarous Hebrew"; his sighs that the "myths of Paganism, dead
as Osiris or Zeus," had not been followed to their graves by the
"coeval imaginations current among the rude inhabitants of
Palestine"; his bald definition of science as "trained and
organised common sense"&mdash;<i>did</i> Huxley's type of mind, or
yet that of another well-known savant, who declared that one should
decide beforehand what was possible and what not, incline you to
trust these men's verdict on the spiritual issues of human
existence? In his own case, certainly not. He believed and would
continue to believe it impossible wholly to account for life and
its phenomena, in terms of physiology, chemistry and physics.</p>

<p>Another thing that baffled him was: why, having advanced to a
certain point, should they suddenly stop short, with a kingly
gesture of: "Thus far and no farther"? Devoting decades of
laborious research to the <i>origin</i> of life on this globe, its
age, its evolution, why should they leave untouched two questions
of still more vital import: life's ultimate goal, and the moral
mysteries of the soul of man? Yes, the chief bone he had to pick
with them was that they had no will to fathom such deeps; plumed
themselves instead on cold-shouldering them; flaunted as their
device: <i>ignoramus et ignorabimus</i>. Arrogantly sure of
themselves, carried away by a passion for facts, they covered with
ridicule those&mdash;the seers, the poets, the childlike in
heart&mdash;who, over and above the rational and knowable, caught
glimpses of what was assumed to be unknowable; declaring, with a
fierce and intolerant unimaginativeness, that the assertion which
outstripped the evidence was not only a blunder, but a crime.
Strange, indeed, was it to watch these masters toiling to interpret
human life, yet denying it all hope of a further development, any
issue but that of eternal nothingness. For his part, he could not
see why the evolution-formula should be held utterly to rule out
the transcendental-formula. But so it was; every line of their
works confirmed it...confirmed, too, the reader's opinion that, in
their bigoted attitude of mind, they differed not so very markedly
from those hard-and-fast champions of orthodoxy who, in the rising
flood of enlightenment, remained perilously clinging to the
vanishing rock of dogma and tradition. On the one hand, for all
answer to the burning needs and questions of the hour, the tale of
Creation as told in Genesis, the Thirty-nine Articles, the
intolerable Athanasian Creed; on the other, as bitterly stubborn an
agnosticism&mdash;each surely, in the same degree, stones for
bread. One would have liked to call to them: Fear not to turn the
light of research on the conception of that immortality which you
affirm...which you deny.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that, little by little, Mahony found himself
drifting away from the barren conclusions of science: just as in
earlier years he had cast loose from a too rigid orthodoxy. Occult
subjects had always had a strong fascination for him, and he now
turned back to them; read ancient screeds on alchemy and astrology;
the writings of Paracelsus and Apollonius of Tyana. Thence he dived
into mysticism; studied the biographies of Saint Theresa, Joseph
Glanvill, Giordano Bruno; and pondered anew the trance history of
Swedenborg. Men and women like these, living their lives as a kind
of experiment, and an arduous and painful experiment at that, were
yet supported and uplifted by the consciousness of a mighty power
outside, and at the same time within themselves: a bottomless well
of spiritual strength. Out of this inspiration they taught
confidently that all life emanated from God (no matter what form it
assumed in its progress), to God would return, and in Him continue
to exist. Yes, spirituality outstripped intellect; there were
mysteries at once too deep and too simple for learned brains to
fathom. Actually, the unlettered man who said: "God is, and I am of
God!" came nearest to reading the riddle of the universe. How cold
and comfortless, too, the tenet that this one brief span of being
ended all. Without faith in a life to come, how endure, stoically,
the ills that here confronted us?...the injustices of human
existence, the evil men did, the cruelty of man to his brothers, of
God to man? Postulate a Hereafter, and the hope arose that, some
day, the ultimate meaning of all these apparent contradictions
would be made plain: the endless groping, struggling, suffering
prove but rungs in the ladder of humanity's upward climb. Not for
him the Byzantine Heaven of the churches, with its mental
stagnation, its frozen immobility, wherein a jealous God, poorer in
charity than the feeble creatures built in His image, spent
Eternity damning those who had failed to propitiate Him. Nor yet
the doctrine of the Fall of a perfect man from grace. Himself he
held this present life to be but a portal, an antechamber, where
dwelt an imperfect but wholly vital creation, which, growing more
and more passionately aware with the passing of the ages of its
self-contained divinity, would end by achieving, by being
reabsorbed in, the absolute consciousness of the Eternal.</p>

<p>Yes, old faiths lay supine, stunned by the hammer blows of
science; and science had nothing soul-satisfying to offer in their
place. Surely now, if ever, the age was ripe for a new revelation:
racked by doubts, or cut to the heart by atheistic denial, it cried
aloud for a fresh proof of God's existence, and of God's concern
with man.&mdash;Restlessly feeling his way, Mahony set himself to
take the measure, where he had so far only dabbled in it, of the
new movement spiritualism, which, from its rise in a tiny American
hamlet, had run like a wildfire over Europe. If what its followers
claimed for it was true&mdash;and among them were men of standing
whose words could not be dismissed with a shrug&mdash;if the
spirits of those who had crossed the bourne were really able...as
in the days of Moses and the prophets...to return and speak with
their loved ones&mdash;then it meant that a new crisis had arisen
in man's relation to the Unseen, with which both science and
religion would eventually have to reckon. Unlike the majority, he
was not put off by the commonplace means of communication
employed&mdash;the rappings and the tappings, the laborious telling
over of the alphabet&mdash;nor yet by the choice, as agents, or the
illiterate and immature. He recalled the early history of
Christianity: the Chaldean shepherds; the Judean carpenter's shop;
the unlettered fishermen; the sneers and gibes of Roman society.
God's ways had never been, never would be man's ways. Why, even as
it was, some found the practice of conventional Christianity none
too easy, thanks to the frailty of the human channels through which
the great message had to pass: the supercilious drawl of a
ritualistic parson; one's inability to admit that a bad priest
might read a true Mass; the fact that the celebrant from whom you
received the Eucharist was known to be, in his spare hours, drinker
and gambler, or one of those who systematically hunted small
animals to death. Measured by such stumbling-blocks as these, the
spiritualists' sincere faith and homely conduct of their seances
did not need to shirk comparison. Indeed, there would sometimes
seem to be more genuine piety at their meetings than at many an
ordinary church service. But, however one looked at it, the
question to be answered remained: was it possible to draw from this
new movement proofs of the knowledge one's soul craved&mdash;the
continuity of existence; the nearness, the interwovenness, of the
spiritual world to the material; the eternal and omnipotent
presence of the Creator?</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-7" id="ch-2-2-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>"My papeh dotes on music. Positively, I have known my papeh to
say he would rather go without his port at dinner than his music
after dinner. My papeh has heard all the most famous singers. In
his opinion, no one could compare with Malibran." Thus Miss
Timms-Kelly; and at his cue the chubby, white-haired old Judge,
surreptitiously snatching forty winks in a dark corner of the
drawing-room, would start, open his eyes, and, like a well-trained
parrot, echo his daughter's words.</p>

<p>"Malibran?...ah, now there was a voice for you!&mdash;Pasta
could not hold a candle to her. As a young man I never missed an
opera when she sang. Great nights, great nights! The King's Theatre
packed to suffocation. All of us young music-lovers burning with
enthusiasm...our palms tingling from applause." Here however, at
some private sign, the speaker abruptly switched off his
reminiscences, which threatened to carry him away, and got to the
matter in hand.&mdash;"My dear, give us, if you please, <i>casta
diva</i>. Though I say so myself, there is something in my
daughter's rendering of that divine air that recalls Malibran in
her prime."</p>

<p>A musical party at the Timms-Kellys' tempted even Mahony forth.
On such evenings, in company with other devotees, he would wander
up Richmond Hill and through the wooden gates of Vaucluse, where a
knot of houses stood sequestered in a grove. The French windows of
the Timms-Kellys' drawing-room were invariably set wide open; and
guests climbing the hill could hear, while still some way off, the
great voice peal out&mdash;like a siren-song that urged and
cajoled.</p>

<p>Miss Timms-Kelly herself bore the brunt of the entertainment;
occasionally mingling in a duo with some manly second, or with the
strains of Mahony's flute; but chiefly in solo. For the thin little
tones of the other ladies, their tinkly performances of "Maiden's
Prayers" and "Warblings at Eve," or the rollicking strains of a sea
ballad (which was mostly what the gentlemen were good for) stood
none of them an earthly chance against a voice like hers. It was a
contralto, with, in its middle and lower registers, tones of a
strange, dark intensity which made of it a real <i>voix sombre</i>;
yet of such exceptional compass that it was also equal to <i>or sai
chi l'onore</i> and <i>non mi dir, bell' idol mio</i>. Mahony used
to say there was something in its lower notes that got at you,
"like fingers feeling round your heart." Ladies, while admitting
its volume and beauty, were apt to be rendered rather uncomfortable
by it; and under its influence would fall to fidgeting in their
seats.</p>

<p>In person Miss Timms-Kelly matched her voice: though not over
tall she was generously proportioned, with a superb bust and
exquisitely sloping shoulders. Along with this handsome figure went
piquantly small hands and feet&mdash;she boasted a number three
shoe&mdash;white teeth, full lips, a fresh complexion. But her
chief charm lay in her animation of manner: she was alive with
verve and gesture; her every second word seemed spoken in italics.
Amazing, thought and said all, that one so fascinating should have
reached the brink of the thirties without marrying; society had
known her now for twelve years, and during this time the marvellous
voice had rung out night for night, her old father faithfully
drawing attention to its merits, the while he grew ever whiter and
sleepier in his corner of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>But the little court that surrounded Miss Timms-Kelly consisted
chiefly of married men and bachelors well past marrying age:
greybeards who, in listening to the strains of <i>Norma</i> or
<i>Semiramide</i>, re-lived their youth. Eligible men fought a
little shy of the lady and after a couple of visits to the house
were apt to return no more. Happily, Miss Timms-Kelly did not take
this greatly to heart. Indeed she even confessed to a relief at
their truancy. "All my life, love, I have preferred the company of
<i>elderly</i> gentlemen. They make one feel so <i>safe</i>."</p>

<p>In process of dressing for such an evening, Mary remarked: "Of
course, it's very nice of Lizzie to say that...and most sensible.
But all the same it <i>is</i> odd&mdash;I mean the fact of her
never having married. Not only because of her voice&mdash;one
doesn't just marry a voice. But she really is a dear, warm-hearted
creature. And so generous." At which Mahony stopped shaving his
chin to throw in: "That's precisely it. Your marriageable man
instinctively fears not being able to live up to the fair singer's
generosity."</p>

<p>"<i>Really</i>, Richard!...it takes you to say queer things. Now
I believe it comes of Lizzie never having had a mother to go about
with. She's been obliged to put herself too much forward."</p>

<p>But for all his two-edged comments, let Miss Timms-Kelly but
open her mouth to sing, and Mahony was hopelessly her slave. His
natural instinct for music had outlived even the long years of
starvation in this country, where neither taste nor performance was
worth a straw. Under the present stimulus, his dormant feelings
awoke to new life: when the great voice rang forth he would sit
rapt...absorbed. And where others, but faintly responsive to the
influence, listened with only half an ear, the while they followed
their own trains of thought, musing, gently titillated: "How fine
the moon to-night!" or "I shall certainly succeed, if I carry
through that deal," or "Perhaps after all Julia will hear my suit,"
he surrendered thought for emotion, and climbed the ladder of sound
to a world built wholly of sound, where he moved light-footedly and
at ease.</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, I would walk ten miles to hear her rendering of
an aria by Mozart or Verdi!"</p>

<p>This was all very well in its way&mdash;its musical way. But now
something happened which brought him with a bump to earth. And,
ever after, he twitted and blamed himself with having been the
innocent cause of a most unnecessary complication.</p>

<p>Towards the close of her stay in Ballarat, Mary had a second
meeting&mdash;a chance one, this time&mdash;with Mr. Henry Ocock.
And Ocock, in his new role of friend and adviser, let fall a hint
with regard to a certain mining company in which he believed Mahony
held shares. This was not the case; but Mary rather thought John
did, begged Richard to find out, and if so, to let him know what
was being said. As Mr. Henry's information had been <i>sub
rosa</i>, Mahony thought it wise to pass it on by word of mouth,
and wrote John saying he would drop in for a moment the following
evening, on his way to Richmond: he was bound with his flute for
Vaucluse. In the morning, however, John's groom brought a note
asking him to take pot-luck with the family at six o'clock. Such
things were possible in John's house nowadays, under the fairy rule
of Miss Julia. And so he found himself that night at John's
dinner-table.</p>

<p>As usual at this stage, when he had not seen his brother-in-law
for a time, Mahony's chief sensation on meeting John was one of
discomfort. Without doubt, some great change was at work in John.
Lean as a herring, yellow as a Chinaman, he had been for months
past. But the change in his manner was even more striking. Gone was
much of the high-handedness, the pompous arrogance it had once been
so hard to stomach; gone the opulent wordiness of his
pronunciamentos. He was now in point of becoming a morose and
taciturn sort of fellow; prone, too, to fits of blankness in which,
staring straight before him, he seemed to forget your very
presence. So much at least was plain: John was not taking the
universe by any means so much for granted, as of old.</p>

<p>Money troubles?...such was the first thought that leapt to
Mahony's mind. Then he laughed at himself. John's business
flourished like the green baytree: you never heard of it but it was
putting forth a fresh shoot in a fresh direction. No lack of money
there!&mdash;the notion was just a telling example of how one
instinctively tried to read into another, what had been one's own
chief bogey. Besides, the warning passed on by Mary left John cold:
he waved it aside with a gesture that said: a few thousands more or
less signified nothing to him. Could the wife's idea that he was
fretting over the loss of his boy be the right one? Again, no: that
was just a woman's interpretation: <i>he</i> jumped to money, she
to the emotional, the personal. Then after all it must be John's
health that was causing him anxiety. But a tactful question on this
score called forth so curt a negative that he could not press
it.</p>

<p>Not till the nuts and port were on the table did John shake off
his abstraction. Then his trio of little girls ran into the
room&mdash;with the playful antics of so many tame white
mice&mdash;ran in and rubbed their sleek little comb-ringed heads
against their father's, and climbed over him with their thin little
white-stockinged legs. And John became solely the fond parent,
gathering his children to him, taking the youngest on his knee and
holding her to his watered-silk waistcoat, letting them play with
the long gold chain from which depended his <i>pince-nez</i>, count
his studs with their little fingers, disarrange the ends of his
tie. At the lower end of the table Emmy, who had presided over the
meal a radiant vision in white muslin and blue ribbons, flushed,
drooped her head, and looked as though she were going to cry. For
though the lovely girl had throughout dinner hung distractingly on
her father's lips, he had never so much as glanced in her
direction.</p>

<p>In watching her, Mahony fell into a reverie, so vividly did she
remind him of her dead mother, and the one&mdash;the
only&mdash;time he had seen John's first wife. It was here, in this
very room, that the gracious Emma, the picture of all that was
comely, had dandled her babes. One of the two, like herself, had
vanished from mortal eyes. The other, a full-grown woman in her
turn, was now ripe for her fate.</p>

<p>When Emmy shepherded the little girls to their nursery, he
turned to John. "Upon my soul, it makes a man realise his age, to
see the young ones come on as they do."</p>

<p>Something in this reflection seemed to flick John. His response
was more in his old style. "You say so? For my part I cannot admit
to feeling a day older than I did ten years back. I am not aware of
any decrease of vigour. I still rise at six, take a cold
shower-bath, and attend to business for a couple of hours before
breakfast. I have needed neither to diet myself for a gouty
constitution, nor to coddle myself in flannel. Age? Bah! At
forty-six a man is in the prime of his life!"</p>

<p>After this one outburst, however, he relapsed into his former
moody silence; and they sat smoking, with scant speech, till Mahony
rose to leave. Then it turned out that John had forgotten the
existence of a previous engagement on Mahony's side, and now made a
lame attempt to overthrow it. ("Looks as if he didn't want to be
left to his own thoughts!") This being impossible, Mahony suggested
that John should accompany him, and undertook to guarantee him a
hearty welcome: it would be well worth his while to hear Miss
Timms-Kelly sing. At first John pooh-poohed the suggestion; musical
evenings were not in his line; and though he had knocked up against
old Timms-Kelly at the Club, he had never met the daughter.
However, in the end he allowed himself to be persuaded; and off
they went, in company.</p>

<p>"And that, my dear, was how it came about in the first place. I
dragged him with me, like the fool I was. And, once there, the game
was up. From the moment John entered the drawing-room, your friend
Lizzie made what I can only describe as a dead set at him. She
never took her eyes off him. She talked to him, she talked at him;
she sang for him, asked his opinion of her selections; and there
sat John, who doesn't know doh from re, or a major key from a
minor, tapping his foot to the tune and looking as if he had been a
judge of music all his life. On two occasions afterwards, I found
him there. Mind you, only two. Then came that unfortunate evening
at <i>Ernani</i>. It's no use asking <i>me</i>, Mary, how the
muddle occurred. I can't tell you; I had nothing to do with it. All
I know is, after the opera Mrs. Vance had to be escorted back to
North Melbourne; and this job naturally fell to me, John not being
the man to shoulder unpleasant duties if he can, with propriety,
put them off on some one else. Well, we hired a wagonette and drove
away&mdash;in a violent thunder-shower&mdash;leaving the other
three outside the theatre. But it appears that somehow or other,
what with the rain and the crush, the two of them lost sight of the
old man. According to John's account they stood waiting for him to
turn up till Miss Lizzie's teeth were chattering with cold. There
seemed nothing for it but for him to call a cab and drive her home.
He did so, and the next morning I'm hanged if he doesn't get a
furious letter from the father, accusing them of having slipped off
alone on purpose. John heads straight for Vaucluse to apologise;
and when he gets there the old man hammers the table, declares his
daughter has been compromised, and ends by demanding to know John's
intentions. Now I ask you, what could John&mdash;what could any man
with the feelings of a gentleman&mdash;do, but offer the only
reparation in his power and at once propose for her hand?
Therewith, of course the old boy cools down...becomes amiability
itself. I don't know, my dear, whether John was really guilty of an
indiscretion&mdash;that's his affair. But if you want my candid
opinion, I think the whole thing was a put-up job. Your friend
Lizzie is a veritable Leyden jar."</p>

<p>Mary, whom the news of John's engagement had brought flying home
from Ballarat, here uttered a disclaimer. "Tch! There you go,
Richard...jumping to conclusions...as usual. Still, I must
say...I'm confident, as far as John was concerned, he had no idea
of marrying again. I really don't know what to think."</p>

<p>"Ah! but such a dear, kind, generous creature..."</p>

<p>"Why, so she is. But..."</p>

<p>"But it's another story, eh, when John the Great comes in
question?"</p>

<p>"Don't be sarcastic! You know quite well I'm very fond of
Lizzie. But poor John was so comfortably settled&mdash;I mean with
Miss Julia to look after him. It seemed as if he was going to have
peace at last. And then, think of the upset again for those poor
dear children."</p>

<p>"Indeed and I do. Though, on the other hand...stepmother to two
families...I shouldn't care, love, to take on the job. But there's
another thing, Mary. Your brother is decidedly queer just
now&mdash;I mean in his manner...and appearance. He looks a tired
man. My own opinion is, he's seen the best of his health. Of
course, he's lived a strenuous life&mdash;like all the rest of
us&mdash;and isn't as young as he was. But that's not
enough...doesn't account for everything. And makes what has
happened very disturbing. If only I'd let well alone that
evening...he'd probably never have set eyes on the woman. It is
certainly a lesson to mind one's own business&mdash;even when it's
a question of doing a kindness...or what one thinks a
kindness."&mdash; "My dehling Mary! So we are to be sisters,
love&mdash;actually sisters! I cannot say how overjoyed I am. Never
have I had such a surprise, dehling, as when my papeh informed me
your brother had declared himself. I said: 'Papeh, are you
<i>sure</i> you are not mistaken?' For never had I imagined, love,
that such a clever and accomplished man as your brother would
select <i>me</i>, from all the ladies of his acquaintance. My heart
still flutters when I think of it. I walk on air.&mdash;Yes,
dehling! Though how I shall ever manage to leave my dear papeh, I
do not know."</p>

<p>"Dear Lizzie! I, too, am very glad.&mdash;But what about the
children? Have you thought if it will suit you to be a stepmother?
Emmy is a grown girl now&mdash;turned seventeen."</p>

<p>"Mary! The dehlings! The poor neglected lambs! Why, I yearn,
dearest, simply yearn to show them a mother's love."</p>

<p>But on Emmy being presented, Lizzie's fervour suffered a visible
abatement. Even to Mary's eye. And an embrace given and received,
her stepmother-to-be looked the girl up and down, with a coolness
which not even her extreme warmth of manner could conceal.</p>

<p>"My dehling! Why, Mary, love, I had no idea&mdash;positively I
had not...I declare it will be like having a younger
sister.&mdash;My dehling girl! And I will show you how to dress
your hair, love&mdash;two puffs, one on each side of the
parting&mdash;it will be a <i>great</i> improvement to your
appearance. That will please papeh, won't it? His dear <i>pet</i>,
I feel sure. Who will be able to tell me <i>all</i> his little
ways."</p>

<p>Emmy wept.</p>

<p>"I <i>hate</i> the way she does her hair, Aunt Mary. I wouldn't
wear mine like that&mdash;not for anything! And I'm <i>not</i>
going to show her how papa likes things done.&mdash;Oh, couldn't I
come and live with you and Uncle Richard? I shall never be happy
here, any more. Why does papa want to get married? Auntie Julia
always promised me I should keep house for him, and he would learn
to like me in time. And now...now..."</p>

<p>It was not for a daughter to sit in judgment on her father, and
Mary gently rebuked Emmy, even while she reflected that the girl
had really a great deal of John's own spirit in her. Lizzie would
not find her new position a bed of roses. For neither did the
little ones take to her. They clung to Auntie Julia's hands and
skirts&mdash;although, to these children who were without personal
beauty, their future mother was still more gracious than to Emmy.
At first, that was. Afterwards, remarked Mahony who was present at
the introduction: afterwards when she saw that they were not to be
cozened into friendliness, she made him think of a pretended animal
lover, who, on a dog failing to respond to his advances, looks as
though he will presently kick it on the sly. But then Richard had
flown to the other extreme, and become both prejudiced and unfair,
not being able to get over the march that had been stolen on
him.</p>

<p>But to such a bagatelle as the likes or dislikes of a parcel of
children Miss Timms-Kelly paid small heed. She had other and more
important fish to fry. The engagement was to be as brief as
propriety admitted; and she was hard put to it to get her trousseau
bought, furniture chosen, the affairs of her maidenhood set in
order. Through the apartments of her new home she swept like a
whirlwind...like a whirlwind, too, overthrowing and destroying.
Painters and paperhangers were already hard at work. For much
company would be seen there after the wedding, great receptions
held: as the Honourable Mrs. Turnham she would move not only in
musical circles, but in the wider world of politics. John's
prospects were of the best: it was an open secret that, for his
services in the Devine ministry, he would probably receive a
knighthood. And small wonder, thought Mary, that Lizzie found the
house shabby and antiquated. Nothing had been done to it since the
day on which John, in his first ardour, had dressed it for his
first bride.</p>

<p>Now, drastic changes were in progress. The old mahogany
four-poster with its red rep curtains&mdash;"Jinny's bed," as it
persisted in Mary's mind&mdash;was to be replaced by one of the new
French testers, with canopy and curtains at the head only. (A
rather risky innovation at John's age!) Oval plate-glass mirrors in
gilt frames, with bunches of candelabra attached, were hung round
the drawing-room walls: a splendid Collard and Collard ousted the
old piano; bouquets of wax flowers and fruit under glass shades
topped the whatnots; horsehair gave way to leather. And the
nursery, which stood next John's own bedroom, was requisitioned by
Lizzie as a boudoir, the children being relegated to the back of
the house.</p>

<p>And John?&mdash;To the four eyes that watched him, with
curiosity and a motherly anxiety, John's attitude came as a
surprise and a relief. He was regularly caught up in the whirl;
and, for once leaving both business and politics in the lurch,
danced attendance on his affianced from morning till night. Though
he still had a haggard air, and certainly nowadays looked what he
was, an elderly man, yet a wave of new life ran through him. In his
attire he grew almost as dapper as of old. It seemed as if he was
determined to carry the affair off with a high hand. He spared no
expense, baulked at no alteration; and the ring that sparkled on
Lizzie's plump finger was, even in this land of showy jewellery, so
costly and magnificent as to draw all eyes. Nor would he have been
human, had he not at heart felt proud of the fine figure cut by his
bride-elect. He <i>was</i> proud, and showed it. More: when he
returned from his wedding-trip to Sydney and the Blue Mountains,
every one could see that he was very much in love.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-8" id="ch-2-2-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>It was a promise of long standing that, once fairly settled in
her new house, Mary should invite to stay with her those of her
friends to whom she lay under an obligation. She had plenty of room
for them, plenty of time; all that remained to do was to fix the
order of their coming.</p>

<p>First, though, she charged herself with Emmy and the children:
to get them out of the workpeople's way, and after the
wedding&mdash;it was celebrated at All Saints, Brighton, and proved
a very swell affair indeed, John's four daughters following the
bride up the aisle&mdash;to leave Miss Julia free to give the final
touches to the house. Emmy cried bitterly when the day came to
return to it: all Mary's reasoning and persuading had not succeeded
in plucking from the girl's heart the sting this third marriage of
her father's had implanted there. A great hope had been dashed in
Emmy; and she went back hot with resentment against the intruder.
The young ones were easier to manage. The excitement of the
wedding, new frocks, new dolls, helped them over the break. For
them, too, this would not be so complete. Miss Julia proposed to
open a select school for the daughters of gentlemen, at which the
three little girls were to be day-pupils.</p>

<p>Not a word had passed between Mary and Miss Julia in criticism
of John's marriage. Their eyes just met for a moment in a look of
complete understanding ("Oh, these men...these men!"). Then with a
nod and a sigh they set resolutely to making the best of
things&mdash;a task, said Mahony, in which the wife had at last
found her peer.</p>

<p>John's affairs having thus once more slipped from her grasp,
Mary devoted herself to the long line of visitors who now crossed
the threshold of "Ultima Thule."</p>

<p>Louisa Urquhart headed the list. Louisa arrived one afternoon at
Spencer Street railway station, and was drawn from the train, her
bonnet askew, her cheeks scarlet with excitement at having
undertaken without escort the four-hour journey from Ballarat. And
after Louisa, who far outstayed her welcome, came Agnes Ocock and
her children and her children's nurses; came Zara and her husband,
in search of expert medical advice; Jerry and his Fanny, the latter
in a delicate state of health; a couple of Ned's progeny; Amelia
Grindle and a sickly babe; came Mrs. Tilly: not to speak of other,
less intimate acquaintances.</p>

<p>Mahony groaned. It was all very well for Mary to say that, if he
wished to be alone, he had only to go into his study and shut the
door. He could and did retire there. But, like other doors, this,
too, had a handle; and since Mary could never get it into her head
that to be busy among your books was to be seriously busy, the
petty interruptions he suffered were endless. Take, for example,
the case of Louisa Urquhart. This was by no means exhausted with
the stitching of a rose in a drab bonnet. Louisa had lived so long
in semi-invalid retirement that she was little better than a cretin
with regard to the small, practical affairs of life. She did not
know how to stamp a letter or tie up a newspaper for the post;
could not buy a pair of gloves or cross a crowded street without
assistance. They had to accompany her everywhere. She also lived in
a perpetual nervous flutter lest some accident should happen at
Yarangobilly while she was absent: the house catch fire, or one of
the children take a fit. "That Willy will not do a bolt with a less
dismal party than she, it would be rash indeed to assume! Of all
the woebegone wet-blankets..." Mahony was disgruntled: it spoilt
his appetite for breakfast to listen to Louisa's whining, did she
learn by the morning post that one of her infants had the
stomach-ache; or to look on at the heroic efforts made by Mary to
disperse the gloom. (The wife's tender patience with the noodles
she gathered round her invariably staggered him afresh.) Then
parties must needs be given in Louisa's honour&mdash;and the honour
of those who came after; the hours for meals disarranged, put
backwards or forwards to suit the home habits of the particular
guest.</p>

<p>Even more disturbing was the visit of Mrs. Henry which followed.
Here, he could not but share Mary's apprehensions lest something
untoward should happen which might give servants or acquaintances
an inkling of how matters stood. As for poor Mary, she grew quite
pale and peaked with the strain; hardly dared let Agnes out of her
sight. At dinner-parties&mdash;and the best people had to be asked
to meet the wife of so important a personage as Mr. Henry&mdash;her
eye followed the decanters their rounds with an anxiety painful to
see. (Between-times, she kept the chiffonier strictly locked.)
During this visit, too, the servants made difficulties by refusing
to wait on the strange nursemaids, who gave themselves airs; while,
to cap all, a pair of the rowdiest and worst-behaved children ever
born romped in the passage, or trampled the flower-beds in the
garden. No walls were thick enough to keep out their noise; any
more than the fact of being in a stranger's house could improve
their manners. The walls were also powerless against Zara's
high-pitched, querulous voice, or the good Ebenezer's fits of
coughing, which shook the unfortunate man till his very bones
seemed to rattle. Later on, for variety, they had the shrill
screaming of Amelia Grindle's sick babe (with Mary up and down at
night, preparing bottles); had Ned's children to be tamed and
taught to blow their noses; pretty Fanny tumbling into faints half
a dozen times a day. Of course, there was no earthly reason why all
these good people should not make his home theirs&mdash;oh dear no!
If Jerry got a fortnight's holiday, what more natural than that he
should choose to spend it in his sister's comfortable,
well-appointed house, rather than in his own poky weatherboard? If
Mrs. Devine wanted to take sea-air ("And, really, Richard, one
<i>has</i> to remember how extraordinarily kind she was to us on
landing"), the least one could do was to beg her to exchange Toorak
for Brighton-on-Beach. Only the fact of John's house being but a
paltry half-hour's walk distant, and the ozone both families
breathed of the same brand, saved them from having John and Lizzie
quartered on them as well.</p>

<p>Yes, Mary's hospitality was rampageous&mdash;no other word would
describe it. He had given her <i>carte blanche</i> and he kept to
his bond; but as time went on his groans increased in volume, he
was sarcastic at the expense of "Mrs. Mahony's Benevolent Asylum,"
and openly counted the days till he should have his house to
himself again. A quiet evening was a thing of the past; he was
naturally expected to escort the ladies to their various
entertainments. Besides, he was "only reading." What selfishness to
shut yourself up with a book, when a visitor's amusement was in
question! For, as usual, Mary's solicitude was all for others. Much
less consideration was shown him personally than in the old
Ballarat days. Then, he had been the breadwinner, the wage-earner,
and any disturbance of his life's routine meant a corresponding
disturbance in their income. Here, with money flowing in without
effort, and abundantly&mdash;as it continued to do-there was no
such practical reason to respect his privacy. And so it was:
"Richard, will you answer these cards for me?" "See to the
decanting of the port?" "Leave an order at the fruiterer's?" "Book
seats for <i>East Lynne</i>, or <i>Maritana?</i>"</p>

<p>In this hugger-mugger fashion week after week, month after month
ran away. Then, however, things seemed to be tailing off, and he
was just congratulating himself that he had bowed the last guest
out, when Tilly arrived, and back they fell into the old atmosphere
of fuss and flutter. Tilly had originally stood high on Mary's
list. Then, for some reason which was not made clear to him, her
visit had been postponed; and he had comfortably forgotten all
about it.</p>

<p>Once she was there, though, it was impossible to forget Tilly,
even for an hour. Her buxom, bouncing presence filled the house.
There was no escape from her strident voice, her empty, noisy
laugh. The very silk of her gowns seemed to rustle more loudly than
other women's; and she had a foot like a grenadier. The truth was,
his old aversion to Tilly, and the type she represented, broke out
anew directly she crossed his door-sill. And three times a day he
was forced to sit next her at meals, attend to her wants, and
listen, as civilly as he might, to her crude comments on people and
things.</p>

<p>In vain did Mary harp on Tilly's sterling qualities. Before a
week was out, Mahony swore he would prefer fewer virtues and more
tact. Goodness of heart could be rated too highly. Why should not
quick-wittedness, and sensitiveness to your neighbour's tender
places, also be counted to your credit? Why must it always be the
blunt-tongued, the hob-nailed of approach, who got all the
praise?</p>

<p>It was at the dinner-table where, in the course of talk, the
burning question of spirits and spirit-phenomena had come up; and
Mary &mdash;Mary, not he: it would never have occurred to him to
dilate on the theme before such as Tilly!&mdash;had told of the
raps and movements of furniture that were taking place at the house
of a Mrs. Phayre, a prominent member of Melbourne society. Now
Tilly knew very well he did <i>not</i> belong to those who
dismissed such happenings with a smile and a shrug. Yet the mere
mention of them was enough to send her off into an unmannerly
guffaw.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!...ha, ha, ha! To see your furniture jumping about the
room! I'D pretty soon nab the slavey&mdash;you take my word for it,
Mary, it's the slavey&mdash;who played such tricks on me. I'D
bundle 'er off with a flea in 'er ear."</p>

<p>A glance at Richard showed him black as thunder. Mary adroitly
changed the subject. But afterwards she came back on it.</p>

<p>"It's all very well, Richard, but you can't expect a
common-sense person like Tilly <i>not</i> to be amused by that sort
of thing."</p>

<p>"And pray do you mean to imply that every one who does not mock
and jeer is devoid of sense?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. Besides, I didn't say sense; I said common
sense."</p>

<p>"Well, since you yourself bring in the 'common,' I'll quote you
the dictum of a famous man. 'Commonplace minds usually condemn
everything that is beyond the scope of their understanding.'"</p>

<p>"How sweeping! And so conceited. But Tilly is <i>not</i>
commonplace. In many ways, she's just as capable as her mother was.
But I don't think we ought to be discussing her. While she's our
visitor."</p>

<p>"Good God! Is one to go blind and dumb because a fool is under
one's roof?"</p>

<p>"Well, really! I do wonder what you'll say next." Mary was hurt
and showed it.</p>

<p>But Mahony did not try to conciliate her. He had a further
ground for annoyance. Ever since Tilly had come to the house, that
side of Mary's nature had prevailed with which he was least in
sympathy. Never had she seemed so deadly practical, and lacking in
humour; so instinctively antagonistic to the imaginative and
speculative sides of life. Her attitude, for example, to the
subject under discussion. At bottom, this was no whit different
from Tilly's. "<i>That</i> sort of thing," said as Mary said it,
put her opinion of the new movement in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Out of this irritation he now demanded: "Tell me: are we never
in this world to have our house to ourselves again?"</p>

<p>"But, Richard, Tilly <i>had</i> to come!...after the time I
stayed with her. And now she's here&mdash;even though you despise
her so&mdash;we've got to do all we can to make her visit a
success. I should hate her to think we didn't consider her good
enough to introduce to our friends."</p>

<p>"Among whom she fits about as well as a porpoise in a basin of
goldfish."</p>

<p>"As if a porpoise could get inside a basin! How wildly you do
talk! Besides you don't mean it. For if ever there was a person
particular about paying debts, it's you."</p>

<p>Late one afternoon he came in from the garden, where he had been
superintending the laying out of a new shrubbery. Only the day
before he had found, to his dismay, that a gap in the screening
hedge of lauristinus and pittosporums allowed of errand-boys and
nursemaids spying on a privacy he had believed absolute. The
thought was unbearable. But the change had cost him a fierce tussle
with his pig-headed Scot of a gardener, who held there were already
too many shrubs about the place. Now he felt hot and tired.</p>

<p>As he crossed the verandah Mary came rustling out of the
dining-room. She looked mysterious, but also, if he knew his Mary,
a trifle uncomfortable. "Richard! I've got a surprise for you. I
want you in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose it will keep till I've washed the dust off."
The drawing-room spelt visitors; and he had looked forward to pipe
and book.</p>

<p>In course of making a hasty toilet, however, he pricked up his
ears. Down the passage came the tones of a voice that seemed
strangely familiar. And, sure enough, when he entered the room he
found what he expected: the visitor Tilly was entertaining with
such noisy gusto was no other than Purdy.</p>

<p>Purdy sat on the circular yellow-silk ottoman, in the easiest of
attitudes. With one leg stuck straight out before him, he hugged
the other to him by the knee, rocking his body backwards and
forwards as he told what was evidently a capital story&mdash;to
judge by his own roars of laughter and Tilly's purple face and
moist eyes, at which she made feeble dabs with her
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>The shock of the encounter drove the semblance of a hearty
greeting out of Mahony. But with this he had exhausted himself;
Purdy and he could find no points of contact; and after a few
halting remarks and awkward pauses, Purdy faced round to Tilly
again and took up the broken thread of his yarn. And from now on,
both there and at the high tea to which Mary presently led them,
Mahony sat silent and constrained. For one thing, he disdained
competition with Tilly in her open touting for Purdy's notice.
Again, as he looked and listened, he understood Mary's discomfort
and embarrassment. On the occasion of last seeing Purdy, they had
both been giddy with excitement. Now the scales fell from his eyes.
This, his former intimate and friend? This common, shoddy little
man, already pot-bellied and bald?&mdash;whose language was that of
the tap-room and the stable; who sat there bragging of the shady
knowledge he had harvested in dark corners, blowing to impress the
women; one of life's failures and aware of it, and, just for this
reason, cocksure, bitter, intolerant&mdash;a self-lover to the Nth
degree. In the extravagant fables they were asked to swallow, he,
Purdy, had seen the best of everything, the worst of everything,
had always been in the thick of a fray and in at the finish.</p>

<p>Well! one person present seemed to enjoy the tasteless
performance, and that was Tilly, who hung on his lips. She even
urged him to repeat some of his tallest stories, for the benefit of
Mary who had been out of the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, love, you <i>must</i> 'ear that yarn of the splitter and
the goanna. I've laughed to burst my sides. Go on, Purd, tell it
again. It was a regular corker." And, belonging to the class of
those who pre-indulge, Tilly hee-hawed at full lung-strength in
anticipation of the coming joke. After which Mahony had to listen
for the second time to some witless anecdote, the real point of
which was to show Purdy in his role of top dog.</p>

<p>Was it possible that he had ever enjoyed, or even put up with
this kind of thing? Had Purdy always been a vainglorious braggart,
or had the boasting habit grown on him as he went downhill? Of
course he himself had not become more tolerant as the years went
by; and he could afford to yield to his antipathies, now that no
business reasons made civility incumbent. But there was more in it
than this. In earlier days a dash of the old boyish affection had
persisted, to blind him to Purdy's failings; just as the memory of
their boyhood's standing&mdash;he the senior, Purdy the
junior&mdash;had caused Purdy to look up to him and defer to his
opinion. Now, nothing of this remained. On either side.
Long-suffering, deference, affection had alike been flung on time's
scrap-heap&mdash;at least, during the two distasteful hours spent
in Purdy's company, not even the ghosts of such feelings stirred.
Then what had brought him back? Mere tuft-hunting? Where, too, in
the name of Christendom had Mary fished him up, who would have been
so much better left in obscurity? Had she really fancied she would
give him, Mahony, a pleasure thereby? <i>Poor Mary!</i></p>

<p>But the thin smile of amusement that curled his lips at the
thought faded, when he heard her pressing Purdy to come again. And
the first time he got her alone&mdash;it was not till
bedtime&mdash;he took her soundly to task.</p>

<p>"Your surprise this afternoon was a surprise indeed&mdash;in
more ways than one. But what possessed you, Mary, to ask him to
repeat the visit? My dear, you must surely see for yourself we
cannot have the eyesore he has become, about this house?"</p>

<p>Mary paused in the act of slipping the rings off her fingers and
on the branches of her ring-tree, and looked surprised.
"<i>What</i>, Richard? Your <i>oldest</i> friend?" But Mahony,
versed in every lightest expression that flitted across the candid
face before him, felt the emphasis to be overdone. Like himself it
was plain Mary had suffered something of a shock.</p>

<p>So he swallowed a caustic rejoinder, and said dryly: "I know
your intentions were of the best. But...well, frankly, my dear, I
think it's bad enough if you fill the house with <i>your</i> old
friends."</p>

<p>He was right. Her discomfiture showed in the way she now flared
up. "Fill the house?...with only one person here at a time, and
never more than two? But&mdash;since you put it that way,
Richard&mdash;I think it's rather a good thing I do. If we are ever
to see anyone at all!"</p>

<p>"Give me books and I don't want people."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've no patience with such a selfish standpoint. Whatever
would be the good of all this&mdash;I mean the nice house, and our
not needing to worry about expense&mdash;if we didn't ask other
people to share it with us?"</p>

<p>"Pray, have I hindered you from doing so?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly. But why start to grumble now, when it's a
question of your best friend?"</p>

<p>At the repetition his patience failed him. "Best friend! Oldest
friend! Good heavens, Mary! do think what you are saying. How can
one continue to be friends with a person one never sees or hears
of? Surely the word implies somebody with whom one has at least
<i>half</i> an idea in common? People don't stand still in this
world. They're always growing and changing&mdash;up or down or off
at a tangent. <i>Panta rei</i> is the eternal truth: <i>Semper
idem</i> the lie we long to see confirmed. And to hug a sentimental
memory of what a mortal once was to you, and go on trying to
bolster up an intimacy on the strength of it&mdash;why, that's to
drag a dead carcase behind you, which impedes your own
progress.&mdash;No, the real friend is one you pick up at certain
points in your life, whose way runs along with yours&mdash;for a
time. A time only. A milestone on your passage&mdash;no more. Few
or none march together the whole way."</p>

<p>"Milestones? Why not tombstones while you're about it?" cried
Mary hotly, repudiating a theory that seemed to her wholly perverse
"Of course, you're able to use words I don't understand; but I say,
once a friend, always a friend. I know I'D be sorry to forget
anyone I had ever liked&mdash;even if I didn't find much to talk to
them about. But you must always have your own ideas. I declare
you're going on now about people just as you do about places, about
not wanting to see them again once you've left."</p>

<p>"Yes, places and people&mdash;one as the other. Let me face
forward&mdash;not back. But to return to the matter in hand: I
don't mind telling you I'd gladly <i>pay</i> our visitor of this
afternoon to stop away...and drink his tea elsewhere."</p>

<p>"I never heard such a thing!" Then, however, another thought
struck her. "You're not letting that silly old affair in Ballarat
still prejudice you against him?"</p>

<p>Mahony laughed out loud. "Good Lord, no! The grass has been
green over that for what seems like half a century."</p>

<p>"Then it's because he drank his tea out of his saucer&mdash;and
things like that."</p>

<p>"Tch!" On the verge of letting his temper get away with him,
Mahony pulled up. "Well, my dear...well, perhaps you're not
altogether wrong. I'll put it even more plainly though. Mary, it's
because he spoke and looked like what I veritably believe him to
be: an ostler in some stable. Horsey checks, dirty nails, sham
brilliants; and a mind and tongue to match. No, I stick to what
I've said: I'd offer him a ten-pound note to stop away."</p>

<p>"I never knew anyone so hard on people as you."</p>

<p>"Come, <i>do</i> I need to mix with ostlers at my time of
life?...and in my present position. It's not my fault that I've
gone up in the world and he down."</p>

<p>"No, but all the more reason not to turn your back on somebody
who hasn't had your luck."</p>

<p>"I deny that I'm a snob. I'd invite my butcher or my baker to
the house any day, so long as he had decent manners and took an
interest in what interests me."</p>

<p>"My dear Richard, you only say that because you know you'll
never have to! And if you did, you wouldn't like them a bit better
than you do Purdy. But I'm sure I sometimes don't know what's
coming over you. You used to be such a stickler for remembering old
friends and old kindnesses, and hadn't bad enough to say about
people who didn't. I believe it was the going home that changed
you. Yet when you were in England, how you railed at people there
for letting themselves be influenced by a person's
outside&mdash;how he ate peas, or drank his soup, and things like
that."</p>

<p>"England had nothing whatever to do with it. But it was a very
different thing in Ballarat, Mary, where my practice brought me up
against all sorts of people to whom I was forced to be civil. Now,
there's no such obligation. And so I decline, once and for all, to
exhibit the specimen we saw to-day to our social circle. If you're
absolutely bent on befriending him&mdash;and I know doing good is,
to you, the temptation strong drink is to others&mdash;although in
my opinion, my dear, you'll end by <i>over</i>doing it: you've not
looked yourself for weeks past. If you must have Purdy here, kindly
let it be when no one else is present, and if possible when I, too,
am out of the way. What you're to say about me? Anything you like.
He won't miss me so long as your friend Tilly is at hand to drink
in his words. You certainly hit the bull's-eye this time, my dear,
in providing her with entertainment. Purdy's egregious lying was
pabulum after her own heart."</p>

<p>With which Richard slung a towel round his neck and retired to
the bathroom, leaving Mary to the reflection that, if ever there
was a person who knew how to complicate the doing of a simple
kindness, it was Richard. Here he went, detesting Tilly with all
his old fervour and dead set from the start against Purdy and his
coming to the house. (It was true Purdy had got rather loud and
bumptious; but a sensible woman like Tilly might be trusted soon to
knock the nonsense out of him.) Meanwhile she, Mary, had somehow to
propitiate all three; and in particular to hinder Richard from
showing what he felt. For if the match came off, Purdy would become
a rich and important personage to whom every door would open. And
then Richard, too, would come round&mdash;would have to. If, that
was, she could meanwhile contrive to keep him from making lifelong
enemies of the happy pair.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-9" id="ch-2-2-9"></a>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>Tilly said:</p>

<p>"My dear! the minute I set eyes on 'er, I knew she was a fraud.
And I thinks to myself: 'Just you wait, milady, till the lights go
out, and I'll cook your goose for you!' Well, sure enough, there we
all sat 'and-in-hand in the dark, like a party of kids playing
'unt-the-slipper. And by-and-by one and another squeals: 'I'm
touched!' What do I do, Mary? Why, I gradually work the hand I'm
'olding in me right, closer to me left, till I'd got <i>them</i>
joined and me right 'and free. (It's as easy as Punch if you know
'ow to do it.) And when the man next me&mdash;oh, 'e <i>was</i> a
solemn old josser!&mdash;when 'e said in a voice that seemed to
come from 'is boots: 'The spirits 'ave deigned to touch
me'&mdash;as if 'e'd said: 'God Almighty 'as arrived and is
present!'&mdash;I made one grab, and got 'old of&mdash;now what do
you think? I'm danged if it wasn't 'er false chignon I found in my
hand. I thought she was going to give me the slip then, after all:
she wriggled like an eel. But I held on like grim death and,
luckily for me, she'd a few 'airs left still clinging to her
cranium. She squeals like a pig. 'Up with the lights,' says I;
'I've got 'er!' 'Turn up the lights if you dare,' cries she: 'it'll
kill me.' Over goes a chair in the scrimmage, and then they did
turn 'em up, and there was she squirming on the floor, bald like an
egg, with I don't know how many false gloves and feathers and
things pinned on to 'er body!"</p>

<p>Tilly sat by the fire in Mary's bedroom, her black silk skirts
turned back from the blaze. She was in high feather, exhilarated by
her own acumen as by the smartness with which she had conducted the
exposure. Opposite her Mary, her head tied up in red flannel,
crippled by the heavy cold and the face-ache that had confined her
to the house, listened with a sinking heart. It was all very well
for Tilly to preen herself on what she had done: Richard would see
it in a very different light. He had gone straight to his study on
entering; and hurrying out in her dressing-gown to learn what had
brought the two of them home so early, Mary had caught a glimpse of
his face. It was enough. When Richard looked like that, all was
over. His hatred of a scene in public amounted to a mania.</p>

<p>It was most discouraging. For a fortnight past she had done
everything a friend could do, to advance Tilly's suit; plotting and
planning, always with an anxious ear to the study-door, in a
twitter lest Richard should suddenly come out and complain about
the noise. For the happy couple, to whom she had given up the
drawing-room, conversed in tones that were audible throughout the
house: a louder courtship Mary had never heard; it seemed to
consist chiefly of comic stories, divided one from the next by
bursts of laughter. Personally she thought the signs and portents
would not be really favourable till the pair grew quieter: every
wooing <i>she</i> had assisted at had been punctuated by long, long
silences, in which the listener puzzled his brains to imagine what
the lovers could be doing. However, Tilly seemed satisfied. After
an afternoon of this kind she went into the seventh heaven, and
leaning on Mary's neck shed tears of joy: it <i>was</i> a case of
middle-aged lovesickness and no mistake! True, she also knew
moments of uncertainty, when things seemed to hang fire, under the
influence of which she would vehemently declare: "Upon my soul,
Mary love, if <i>he</i> doesn't, I shall! I feel it in my bones." A
state of mind which alarmed Mary and made her exclaim: "Oh no,
don't, Tilly!&mdash;don't do that. I'm sure you'd regret it. You
know, later on he might cast it up at you."</p>

<p>And now Tilly had probably spoilt everything, by her hasty,
ill-considered action.</p>

<p>Fortunately for her she didn't realise how deeply she had
sinned; though even she could see that Richard was angry. "Of
course, love, the doctor's in a bit of a taking. I couldn't get a
word out of 'im all the way 'ome.&mdash;Lor', Mary, what geese men
are, to be sure!...even the best of 'em. Not to speak of the
cleverest. To see all those learned old mopokes sitting there
to-night, solemn as hens on eggs...it was enough to make a cat
laugh. But even if 'e <i>does</i> bear me a bit of a grudge, it
can't be helped. I'm not a one, love, to sit by and see a cheat and
keep my mouth shut. A fraud's a fraud, and even if it's the Queen
'erself."</p>

<p>"Of course it is. I feel just the same as you. It makes my blood
boil to watch Richard, with all his brains, letting himself be
duped by some dishonest creature who only wants to make money out
of him. But...when he once gets an idea in his head...And he's not
a bit <i>grateful</i> for having his eyes opened."</p>

<p>Grateful, indeed! When, after an hour's solitude which might
really have been expected to cool him down, he came into the
bedroom, his very first words were: "Either that woman leaves the
house, or I go myself!"</p>

<p>For all Mary's firm resolve to act as peacemaker, this was more
than she could swallow. "Richard, don't be so absurd! We can't turn
a visitor out. Decency forbids."</p>

<p>"It's <i>my</i> house, and for me to say whom I'll have in
it."</p>

<p>"Tilly's <i>my</i> friend, and I'm not going to have her
insulted." Mary's tone was as dogged as his own.</p>

<p>"No! but she is at liberty to insult mine...and make me a
laughing-stock into the bargain. Such a scandalous scene as
to-night's, it has never been my lot to witness."</p>

<p>"However did it happen that you held a seance? The invitation
only said cards and music. I'd have kept her at home if I'd
guessed, knowing her opinion of that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I wish to God you had! You talk of decency? You need hardly
worry, I think, in the case of a person who has so few decent
feelings of her own. If you could have heard her! 'I got 'er! Up
with the gas! I'm 'olding 'er&mdash;by 'er false
'air!'"&mdash;Mahony gave the imitation with extravagant emphasis.
"I leave it to you to imagine the rest. That voice...the scattered
aitches...the gauche and vulgar manner...the medium weeping and
protesting...your friend parleying and exclaiming&mdash;at the top
of her lungs, too&mdash;glorying in what she had done as if it was
something to be proud of, and blind as a bat to the thunder-glances
that were being thrown at her...no! I shall never forget it. She
has rendered me impossible&mdash;in a house where till now I have
been an honoured guest."</p>

<p>The exaggeration of this statement nettled Mary. She clicked her
tongue. "Oh, <i>don't</i> be so silly! Surely you can write and
explain? Mrs. Phayre will understand...that you had nothing to do
with it."</p>

<p>"Who am I that I should have to explain and apologise?&mdash;and
for the behaviour of a person she did us the courtesy to
invite."</p>

<p>"But considering the woman <i>was</i> a fraud? Tilly vows she
had all sorts of contrivances pinned to her body."</p>

<p>"There you go! Ready, as usual, to believe any one rather than
me! She was no more a fraud than I am. She came to us well attested
by circles of the highest standing. Yet in spite of this, an
ignorant outsider, who is present at a sitting for the first time
in her life, has the insolence to set herself up as a
judge.&mdash;Mary! I've put up with the job lot you call your
friends for more than a twelvemonth. But this is the last straw.
Out she goes, and that's the end of it!"</p>

<p>But this flicked Mary on the raw. "You seem to forget
<i>some</i> of the job lot were my own relations."</p>

<p>"Oh, now get touchy, do! You know very well what I mean. But
enough's enough. I can stand no more."</p>

<p>"You talk as if you were the sole person to be considered. As
usual, think of nobody but yourself."</p>

<p>"Ha! I like that," cried Mahony, exasperated. "I think I'm
possessed of the patience of Job, if you ask me. For there's never
been a soul among them with whom I had two ideas in common."</p>

<p>"No, you prefer these wretched mediums and the silly people who
are taken in by them. I wish spiritualism had never been
invented!"</p>

<p>"Don't talk about what you don't understand!"</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i>. I know nearly every time we go out now, I have to
sit by and watch you letting yourself be humbugged. And then I'm
not to open my mouth, or say what I see, or have any opinion of my
own."</p>

<p>"No! I should leave that to the superior wits of your
friend."</p>

<p>"I think it's abominable the way you sneer at Tilly! But if you
do it just to get her out of the house, you're on the wrong tack.
She's <i>not</i> going just now, and that's all about it. Any one
but you would understand what's happening. But you're so taken up
with yourself that you never see a thing&mdash;not if it's under
your very nose!"</p>

<p>"Pray what do you mean by that? <i>What</i> is happening?"
Pierced by a sudden suspicion Mahony swung round and faced her.
"Good Lord, Mary!"...his voice trailed off in a kind of incredulous
disgust. "Good Lord! You don't want to tell me you're trying to
bolster up a match between this woman and...and Purdy?"</p>

<p>Mary tightened her lips and did not reply.</p>

<p>Mahony's irritation burst its bounds. "Well, upon my
soul!...well, of all the monstrous pieces of folly!" After which he
broke off, to throw in caustically: "Of course if it comes to that,
I 'll allow they're well matched...in manners and appearance. But
the fellow's an incorrigible waster. He'll make ducks and drakes of
old Ocock's hard-earned pile. Besides, has he shown the least
desire for matrimony? Are you not lending yourself to a vulgar
intrigue on the woman's part? If so, let me tell you that it's
beneath your dignity&mdash;your dignity as my wife&mdash;and I for
one decline to permit anything so offensive to go on under my roof.
Not to speak of having to see you bear the blame, should things go
wrong."</p>

<p>"No, really, Richard! this is too much," cried Mary, and bounced
up from her seat. "For <i>goodness</i> sake, let me manage my own
affairs! To hear you talk, any one would think I was still a child,
to be told what I may and mayn't do&mdash;instead of a middle-aged
woman. I'm quite able to judge for myself; yes! and take the
consequences, too. But you blow me up just as if I wasn't a person
for myself at all, but only your wife. Besides, I think you might
show a <i>little</i> confidence in me. I shan't disgrace you, even
if I am fool enough to bring two people together again who were
once so fond of each other. Which you seem to have quite forgotten.
Though your own common sense might tell you. Tilly's alone in the
world, and has more money than she knows what to do with. And he
has none. I think you can safely leave it to her to look after her
own interests. She's a good deal sharper than any of us, you
included. And Purdy, too. You sneer at him for an ostler and a
ne'er-do-well. He's nothing of the sort. For six months now he's
worked hard as a traveller in jewellery." ("Ha!...<i>that</i>
explains the sham diamonds, the rings, the breastpins.") "There you
go!...sneering again. And here am I, struggling and striving to
keep the peace between you, till I don't know whether I'm standing
on my head or my heels. And as far as you're concerned, it's not
the least bit of good. I think you grow more selfish and perverse
day by day. You ought to have lived on a desert island, all by
yourself. Oh, I'm tired...sick and tired...of it and of
everything!"&mdash;and having said her say, passionately and at top
speed, Mary suddenly broke down and burst out crying.</p>

<p>Mahony's anger was laid on the instant. "Why, my dear!...why,
Mary...what's all this about? Come, come, love!"&mdash;as her sobs
increased in violence&mdash;"this will never do. There's nothing to
upset yourself over. The fact is, as you say, you're tired out. We
shall be having you ill in earnest if this goes on. And small
wonder, I'm sure. I declare, as soon as you're rid of your cold I
shall shut this place up and take you away from everybody, on a
trip to Sydney and the Blue Mountains."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go to Sydney. I only want to be left alone, and
not have my friends insulted and turned out of the house."</p>

<p>"Good God, wife!...surely you can give me credit for some small
degree of tact? But now, enough. You lie still and go to sleep. Or
as I say, we shall have you really ill."</p>

<p>"Oh, leave me out of it, do. I shall be all right in the
morning."</p>

<p>But this was not the case. Mary coughed and tossed, and went
from hot to cold and cold to hot, for the greater part of the
night. In the morning her head felt a ton weight on the pillow. It
was no good chafing; in bed she had to stay. Mahony and Tilly faced
each other in glum silence across the length of the
breakfast-table.</p>

<p>The next few days bringing no improvement, Tilly had the good
sense to pack her trunks and return to Ballarat. And it was one
crumb of comfort to Mary that, thanks to her indisposition, this
departure was accomplished without further unpleasantness.</p>

<p>Leaning over the bed for a farewell embrace, Tilly answered her
friend's hoarse whisper with a shake of the head. "But don't you
bother, love. My dear, you'll see what you do see! I'm no chicken,
Mary, nor any mealy-mouthed schoolgirl to lose me chance for want
of opening me mouth. But whatever happens, I'll never forget how
you tried to pull it off for me, old girl&mdash;never!...not so
long as I live."</p>

<p>And now, the nervous strain she had been under of lying
listening for sounds of strife and warfare&mdash;this removed, Mary
was left at peace in her dimity-white bed, and gave herself up to
the luxury of feeling thoroughly out of sorts. Richard found plenty
to say in admonition, as the days went by and she continued low and
languid, unable to shake off what seemed but a heavy cold. He also
laid down many a stringent rule to safeguard her, in future, from
the effects of her inexhaustible hospitality.</p>

<p>Then, however, the words died on his lips.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>When the truth dawned on them that Mary's illness could be
ascribed to a purely natural cause, and that, at long last, she was
to bear a child, husband and wife faced the fact as diversely as
they now faced all vital issues. In Mahony's feelings, bewilderment
and dismay had the upper hand. For though, at one time, Mary's
childlessness had been a real grief to him, so many years had
passed since then that he had long ceased either to hope or to
regret. And when you had bowed thus to the inevitable, and arranged
your life accordingly, it was disquieting, to say the least of it,
to see your careful structure turned upside down. Rudely
disquieting.</p>

<p>And this sense of inexpediency persisted long after Mary was up
and about again, her old blithe self, and the two of them had more
or less familiarised themselves with the idea of the drastic change
that lay in store for them. The truth was: he no longer wished for
children. One needed to be younger than he, still in the early
years of married life, to accept their coming unconcernedly. (Nor
was he enough of a self-lover to crave to see himself
re-duplicated, and thus assured of an earthly immortality.) He felt
old; <i>was</i> old: too late, now, to conjure up any of the dreams
that belonged by rights to the coming of a child. His chief
sensation was one of fear: he shrank from the responsibility that
was being thrust upon him. A new soul to guide, and shield, and
make fit for life!...when he himself was so unsure. How establish
the links that should bind it to the world around it?&mdash;as to
the world unseen. How explain evil?...and sin?...the doctrine of
reward and punishment?&mdash;and reconcile these with the idea of a
tender, all-powerful Creator. For though one might indulge in
theory and speculation for one's own edification, one dare not risk
them on a child. Another more selfish point of view was that he
looked forward with real apprehension to the upheaval of his little
world: the inroads on, the destruction of that peace and solitude
with which he had fallen so deeply in love.</p>

<p>A bright side to the affair was that they were now, for the
first time in their united lives, really able to afford the outlay
involved. They could make comfortable, even extravagant preparation
for the new arrival; and only too gladly did he bid Mary spend what
she chose. For though his own pleasure in the prospect of
fatherhood was severely tempered, it warmed his heart to see her
joy. "Radiant" was the only word that described Mary. No irksome
thoughts of responsibility bore her down. She would have laughed at
the notion in regard to a child of her own. But then, there never
was less of a doubter than Mary: no hypercritical brooding over
man's relation to God, or God's to the world, had ever robbed her
of an hour's sleep. She accepted things as they were with a kind of
simple, untroubled faith. Or was it perhaps just the
reverse&mdash;the absence of any religious spirit? Sometimes he
half believed it&mdash;believed there existed in Mary more than a
dash of the pagan. Well, however that might be, the coming of a
babe would set the crown on a life which, in spite of its
happiness, had so far lacked the supreme gift. For women's arms,
like their bodies, were built to cradle and enfold the young of the
race.</p>

<p>Mary wrinkled her brow over none but the most practical
considerations. Enough to occupy her was the burning question which
rooms to take for nurseries, in a house where all rooms had long
ago had their use allotted them.</p>

<p>Mahony laughed at her worried air. "Why, build 'em, my dear, and
as many as you choose! I'll not grudge the expense, I promise
you."</p>

<p>But this was just one of Richard's harebrained schemes. The
house was amply big enough as it stood; and any additions would
spoil its shape. Time enough, too, to think of extra accommodation
when all was happily over. Thus Mary: deciding eventually that the
guestrooms were those that must be sacrificed: they were large,
cool, airy; and once the baby was there, she would have scant
leisure for entertaining. At least, in the beginning. And with this
resolution, which was at once put into effect, Mary's overdone and
tiresome hospitality found its natural end.</p>

<p>Next came the question of furnishing. And here Richard proved to
have ultra-queer notions about what would be good for a
child&mdash;his child&mdash;and what wouldn't. The nurse was not
even to share a room with it&mdash;and this, when most nurses slept
with their charges in the same bed! Then he tabooed carpets as
dust-traps, so that there was no question of just covering the
floor with a good Brussels; and curtains must be of thinnest
muslin&mdash;not rep. In the end Mary had the floors laid in
polished wood, on which were spread loose strips of bamboo matting;
and dark green sunblinds were affixed to the outsides of the
windows. The walls were distempered a light blue. In place of the
usual heavy mahogany the furniture was of a simple style, and
painted white. The little crib&mdash;it had to be made to order,
for Richard would have none of the prevalent rocking-cradles,
which, he declared, had rocked many a babe into
convulsions&mdash;was white as well. When all was finished the
effect was quite fairylike, and so novel that tales of the
nurseries got abroad, and visitors invariably asked before leaving
if they might be allowed a peep at them. Meanwhile, Mahony did his
share by hunting up pictures on which the infant eye might rest
with pleasure. He also bought toys; and would arrive home with his
pocket bulging. Mary bore with him as long as he confined his
purchases to woolly balls and rag dolls. But when it came to his
ordering in an expensive rocking-horse, she put her foot down.</p>

<p>"<i>Really</i>, Richard! Just suppose anything...I mean it will
be more than time enough for things like these a year or two from
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, the doctor expects <i>his</i> kid to come into the world
able to walk and talk...like a foal or a calf. Never will such a
miracle have trod this old earth!"</p>

<p>And as Tilly&mdash;she had come down on her own initiative,
solely to be near Mary over her confinement&mdash;as she drove back
to the hotel at which she was putting up, she hummed the popular
refrain:</p>

<p>Oh, la, la!<br>
What fools men are!</p>

<p>For besides making a donkey of himself over his purchases,
Mahony was haunted, now the end drew nigh, by a memory, by the fear
of another disappointment. He hardly trusted Mary out of his sight;
hardly let her put one foot before another,&mdash;"As jumpy as a
Persian cat! You'd never think 'e'd 'elped hundreds of brats into
the world in 'is day!"</p>

<p>Mary sat in a rocking-chair on the shady side of the verandah,
and waved a palm-leaf fan to keep the flies off. More often she was
surrounded by yards of muslin, real India muslin, which she
fashioned into robes and petticoats, on which she frilled and
tucked and embroidered, sewing every stitch by hand.</p>

<p>"A regular trousseau!" said Tilly; and enviously fingered the
piles of gossamer garments.</p>

<p>On the ordeal that lay before her, Mary herself was not given to
brooding: for one thing, she was much stronger than she had been as
a girl. And the first discomforts of her state over, her health was
well maintained. But when December, with its livid heat, had
slipped into the greater heats of January and her time came, she
gave birth as hardly as on that first occasion long years ago; all
but paying with her own for the new life she was bringing into the
world. Well-known specialists, hastily summoned, performed a
critical operation, Mahony's trust in his own skill deserting him
as usual where Mary was in question. And though the operation was
successful and the child born alive, days of acute anxiety followed
before it was certain that Mary would pull through. Tilly and
Mahony buried the hatchet in the long hours they spent together in
that darkened bedchamber, where Mahony moved a pale, distraught
shadow, and Tilly sat weeping silently, her handkerchief to her
eyes. In the dining-room John and Jerry strayed aimlessly to and
fro among the furniture; and outsiders like Mrs. Devine would drive
up early, and remain sitting in their carriages to hear the latest
bulletin. In the end Mary's sound constitution triumphed, and she
was gradually won back to life; but over a week passed before she
even asked to see her child. Then, in sudden impatience, she tried
to raise herself on her elbow&mdash;a movement that sent Tilly and
the nurse flying to lay her flat again. Tilly it was who, going to
the crib, carried to her on a pillow one of the tiniest babies ever
seen: a waxen doll, with black hair an inch long, and the large
black eyes of Mary's own family.</p>

<p>It was a boy. At his baptism, where John, Jerry and Lizzie stood
sponsors, he received the name of Cuthbert&mdash;in full was to be
known as Cuthbert Hamilton Townshend-Mahony.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-1" id="ch-2-3-1"></a>Chapter I</h3>

<p>These unlooked-for children&mdash;the following year twin girls
were born, thus rounding off a trio&mdash;came too late to form the
bond between their parents they might once have done. For that, the
attitudes adopted towards them by father and mother, themselves now
branched so far apart, were too dissimilar. In Mahony's case, once
his children were there in the flesh before him, all his puny fears
of personal upset and mental pother fell away. He had only to feel
tiny soft fingers straying over his face, to become the tenderest
of fathers, loving his babies wholeheartedly. Now he feared only
for them, in their frailty and helplessness. Did he wake in the
night and think he heard a cry, he was out of bed in an instant;
and the nurse, entering from the next room to make sure of her
charges, would find her master there before her&mdash;a tall,
dressing-gowned figure, shading a candle with his hand. Often, too,
when wakeful, he would rise and steal into the night-nursery to
take a peep at his little ones, lying relaxed in sleep. Yes, he was
passionately solicitous for them&mdash;and not for their bodily
health alone. He would have wished to shield their little plastic
minds from all impressions that might pain or harm; have had them
look only at beautiful and pleasant things, hear soft voices and
kind words; on no child of his might hand be laid in anger. The
result was that the children, dimly conscious of his perpetual
uneasiness, were rendered uneasy by it in their turn, and, for all
the deep affection from which it sprang, never really warmed
towards their father.</p>

<p>Instead, they sunned themselves in their mother's love, which
knew nothing of fears or apprehensions. Mary laughed at Richard's
exaggerated anxiety; though she rejoiced to see him so fond. A
self-centred person like him might well have found children a
nuisance and in the way.</p>

<p>To her they were all in all; and on them she lavished that great
hoard of mother-love which, till now, she had spent on the world at
large. Had they been born shortly after her marriage, she, who was
then little more than a child herself, would have been a child
along with them; and the four would have grown up together in a
delightful intimacy. Of this there was now no question. Coming when
they did, the children stood to her only for possessions&mdash;her
most precious possessions&mdash;but still, something absolutely her
own, to do with just as she thought good. Through them, too, she
believed she would some day gratify those ambitions which, where
Richard was concerned, had proved so stark a failure. He had had no
desire to walk the high paths she had mapped out for him. Her
children would&mdash;and should. In the meantime, however, ambition
lay fallow in love; and it was to their mother the babies ran with
their pains and pleasures, their discoveries and attainments. She
alone gave them that sense of warmth and security in which very
young things thrive.</p>

<p>Their devotion to her was the one feature the three had in
common. The twins&mdash;they soon earned the nickname of "the
Dumplings"&mdash;were mere rolypoly bundles of good nature and
jollity, who rarely cried, and were as seldom ill as naughty. Mary
boasted: the most docile children in the world. Passionately
attached to each other said Mahony, it was as though a single soul
had been divided between two bodies&mdash;they toddled through
babyhood hand in hand; faithfully sharing all good things that came
their way; sleeping in the same crib, face to face, each with an
arm flung protectively about the other's neck. To look at they were
as like as two peas, blue-eyed, fair-haired, dimpled, lovely to
handle in their baby plumpness, and the most satisfying of armfuls.
Their development, too, kept equal pace they walked late, owing to
the burden of their little rotundities and long remained content
with inarticulate sounds for speech.</p>

<p>The boy was of quite another fibre: as hard to manage as they
were easy; as quick as they were slow. Tilly early said of him:
"Lor', Mary! the doctor 'imself in frocks and petticoats." But this
referred chiefly to little physical tricks and similarities: a
certain faddiness about his food, his clothes, his belongings. A
naughty child he was not&mdash;at first. He, too, began life as a
placid infant, who slept well, did not cry, and accepted
philosophically the bottle&mdash;substitute that was put to his
lips. This meant that, in spite of his midget-size at birth, he was
sound and healthy&mdash;in a fragile, wiry way. He continued small,
but was neatly formed. To his mother's colouring he added his
father's straight features; and even in babyhood had the latter's
trick of carrying his head well back, and a little to one side. He
walked before he was a year old, talked soon after; and, to his
parents' pride, was able to pick out a given letter from a
play-alphabet before he either walked or talked.</p>

<p>His precocity showed itself in other ways as well. For a year
and a quarter he was King of the House, the pivot of his little
world, sole occupant of his mother's knee. Then came the sudden
apparition of his sisters. In the beginning, Cuffy&mdash;thus he
named himself&mdash;did not pay much heed to this pair of animated
dolls, who moved their legs and arms when bathed, and rode out in a
carriage beside his, but for the most part lay asleep and
negligible. Only gradually did it dawn on him that his privileges
were being invaded; that not only, indeed, was his reign as sole
ruler at an end, but that the greater favours were falling to the
newcomers' share. And one day the full knowledge of what had
happened burst through, with disastrous results, Cuffy being then
something over two years old. Dressed for driving Mary entered the
nursery; and Cuffy clamoured to be set upon her knee.</p>

<p>"Not now, darling, I've no time. You must wait till Mamma comes
back."</p>

<p>But the nurses appearing at this moment with the babies, all
warm and fragrant from their afternoon nap, Mary was not able to
resist holding out her arms for them. She even lingered, fondling
them, after the carriage was announced.</p>

<p>Cuffy had docilely retreated to a corner, where he played with a
stuff elephant. But on seeing this&mdash;seeing his mother, who had
been too busy for him, petting the twins who had not even
<i>asked</i> to be nursed&mdash;at this he planted himself before
her and regarded her with his solemn black eyes. ("I do declare,
Master Cuffy seems to look right through you and out behind, when
he stares so," was a saying of Nannan's.)</p>

<p>Relinquishing her babies Mary stooped to him. "Say good-bye to
Mamma."</p>

<p>To her amazement, instead of putting up his face for a kiss,
Cuffy darted at her what she described to Richard as "a dreadfully
naughty look," and going over to his rocking-horse, which, though
he was not yet allowed to mount it, was his dearest treasure,
started to beat it with both hands, and with such force that the
patient effigy swung violently to and fro.</p>

<p>Shocked at this fit of temper, Nannan and Mary exclaimed in
chorus: "Master Cuffy! Well, I never did! Such tantrums!"</p>

<p>"Cuffy! What <i>are</i> you doing? If you are so naughty, Mamma
will never take you on her knee again."</p>

<p>The child's back being towards her, she did not see how at these
words the little face flushed crimson, the eyes grew round with
alarm. Cuffy at once left off hitting the horse; just stood
stock-still, as if letting what his mother had said sink in. But he
did not turn and come to her. Mary told Richard of the incident as
she buttoned her gloves. And Richard had Cuffy brought to him.
Laying aside his book he lifted the child to his knee.</p>

<p>"Papa is sorry to hear Cuffy has been naughty. Will Cuffy tell
Papa why?"</p>

<p>Unwinkingly the great eyes regarded him. But there was no
response.</p>

<p>"Fy, fy! To hit poor horsey...when it had done nothing to
deserve it."</p>

<p>"Cuffy's 'orsey&mdash;own norsey."</p>

<p>"But, just because it is Cuffy's&mdash;Cuffy's very own&mdash;he
must be kind...all the kinder...to it. Never wreak your temper or
your vengeance, my little son, on a person or thing that is in your
power. It's ungenerous. And I want my Cuffy to grow up into a good,
kind man. As careful of the feelings of others as he is of his
own."</p>

<p>Something in his father's voice&mdash;grave, measured,
tender&mdash;got at the baby, though the words went over his head.
And then Mahony saw what he long remembered: a fight for
self-control extraordinary in one so young. The black eyes filled;
the little mouth twitched and trembled. But the child swallowed
hard in an attempt to keep back his tears. And when at last they
broke through, he turned and hid his face against his father's
coat. Not, Mahony felt sure, seeking there either comfort or
sympathy. Merely that his distress might be unobserved. Taking in
his own the two little hands, which were locked in each other,
Mahony drew them apart. Both palms were red and sore-looking, and
no doubt still tingled hotly. The child had hurt himself most of
all.</p>

<p>But Cuffy's tears soon dried. After a very few seconds he raised
his face, and, this having been patted with his father's
handkerchief, slid to the floor and trotted back to the nursery.
And then, said Nannan, what a to-do there was! Master Cuffy dragged
his little chair up beside the horse, climbed on the chair and put
his arms round the animal's neck, talking to it for all the world
as if it was a live creature and could talk back.</p>

<p>"Wos 'oo 'urt, dea' 'orsey?&mdash;poor 'ickle 'orsey! Cuffy
didn't mean to. Wot 'oo say, 'orsey? 'Orsey 'oves Cuffy
double-much? Dea' 'orsey! Cuffy 'oves 'orsey, too&mdash;much more
better zan Effalunt."</p>

<p>And having deposited horsey's rival upside-down in a dark
cupboard, he begged a lump of sugar from Eliza the under-nurse, and
rammed it in between the steed's blood-red jaws; where it remained,
until a trail of white ants was discovered making a straight line
for it from the window.</p>

<p>To Mary, Mahony said: "If I were you, my dear, I should be
careful to distribute my favours equally. Don't let the little
fellow feel that his nose has been put out of joint. He's
jealous&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"Jealous? Of his own sisters? Oh, Richard!...I don't think that
augurs very well for him.&mdash;And surely he can't learn too soon
that it's for him to give way to them&mdash;as little girls?"</p>

<p>For almost the first time in his knowledge of her, Mahony seemed
to sense a streak of hardness in Mary; for the first time she did
not excuse a wrongdoer with a loving word. And this her own
child!</p>

<p>"He's but a baby himself. Don't ask too much of him," he soothed
her. And added: "Of course, I only give you my idea. Do as you
think best." &mdash;For Mary had proved as capable as a mother as
at everything else: she solved problems by sheer intuition, where
he would have fretted and fumbled. Even the children's early
religious training had, when the time came, fallen to her. Here
again she had no bothersome theories: just the simplest practice.
The question whether Cuffy and his sisters should be taught to pray
or not to pray, to invoke a personal or an impersonal Deity, never
entered her head. As soon as they could lisp their first syllables,
they knelt night and morning at her knee to repeat their "Gentle
Jesus!" and "Jesus, tender Shepherd!" And as long as the great
First Cause was set forth in this loving and protective guise,
Mahony saw no reason to interfere. He contented himself with
forbidding the name of God ever to be used as a threat, or in
connection with punishment: the children were taught that the worst
that could befall a sinner was a temporary withdrawal of God's
love. Nor would he have the THOU GOD SEEST ME! fallacy&mdash;this
reduction of the Omnipotent and Eternal to the level of spyer and
peeper&mdash;instilled into their young minds; while such a purely
human invention as the Devil&mdash;"That scapegoat on which man
piles the blame for the lapses in his own nature!"&mdash;was never
to be so much as mentioned in the nursery.</p>

<p>These few simple rules laid down, he retired into the
background. The comfortable knowledge that his children were in the
best of hands left his mind free.</p>

<p>Until now it had been plain sailing. Now...well, Mary invariably
dated the beginning of the real trouble with Cuffy from the day on
which he flew into such a naughty passion with his horse. Exactly
an easy child to manage he had never been; he was too fanciful for
that. There was no need for Richard to fuss and fidget about
keeping ugly things from him. Cuffy himself would have none of
them. Before he was a twelve-month old, did he, in looking at his
"Queen of Hearts" story-book, draw near the picture of the thieving
knave, you saw his eyes getting bigger and bigger. And if he could
not contrive, with his baby hands, to turn two pages at
once&mdash;and nobody else might do it for him &mdash;he would
avert his eyes altogether, or lay his palm flat over the wretch's
ugly face. The Dore illustrations to his big fairy-book had a kind
of horrid fascination for him. There he would sit staring at these
dense and gloomy forests, these ruined, web-hung castles surrounded
by their stagnant moats&mdash;and then, when bedtime came, he
turned frightened. It was of no use trying to shame him with: "A
great boy like you! Why, the Dumplings aren't a bit afraid." Or
cheerily assuring him: "There are no such things, darling, as
witches and giants. They're only made up to amuse little
children."</p>

<p>Cuffy knew better&mdash;when the lamp was out and Nannan had
left the nursery. Then the picture he feared most: Hop-o'-my-Thumb,
a creature in petticoats, no bigger than himself, leading a long
string of brothers and sisters into a forest black as ink: this
picture <i>would</i> rise up before him. Not only so, but he
himself must join the tail, fall in after Hop-o' and follow into
that dreadful wood, where the ogre lived. Since he could not resist
its attraction, the book had to be locked away.</p>

<p>The eldest, and a boy, to be such a baby! Mary felt quite
abashed for Cuffy, and lost no chance of poking fun at his fears.
But it did not help; and eventually she saw that she must leave it
to time to drive this nonsense out of him. There were other, more
actively disturbing traits in his nature, on which time might have
the opposite effect. For example, for such a little child he was
far too close and reserved; he kept his thoughts and feelings
buttoned up inside himself. He had a passionate
temper&mdash;"Cuffy's temper" it was called, as though of a special
brand that belonged to him alone&mdash;but he did not often give it
play. Was he hurt or offended or angry, he would retire to a
corner, and stay there by himself. If he had to cry, he cried in a
corner; he did not want to be petted or comforted; and he would
also in nine cases out of ten not say&mdash;Richard declared would
perhaps not be able to say &mdash;why he cried. Mary saw him
growing up very unfrank and secretive; which, to her, spelt
deceitful.</p>

<p>Again, it wormed in her that he was not a friendly or a trusting
child &mdash;one of those who indiscriminately hold out their arms,
or present a cheek. Cuffy would not go to strangers or always give
his kiss when bidden. Nor was he generous; he did not willingly
share his toys, or his picture-books, or his lollipops. The things
that belonged to him belonged absolutely. Really, he seemed to look
upon them as bits of himself, and hence not to be parted with. His
favourite animals&mdash;horse and elephant&mdash;might be touched
by no one. Was there a children's party in the nursery special
playthings had to be provided, or only those used that were the
Dumplings' property. To Mary, bound by but gossamer threads to all
things material, her little son's attitude was something of a
mystery; and many a time did she strive with him over the head of
it. His inability to share with others stood to her for sheer
selfishness. She trembled, too, lest the Dumplings should learn to
copy him in this, and cease to be the open-hearted, open-handed
little mortals they were. For they looked up to Cuffy with adoring
eyes&mdash;Cuffy who walked while they still drove; was present at
dessert in the evening, while they were put to bed; wore
knickerbockers instead of skirts. But, try as she might, by
teaching and example, she could not influence the boy, let alone
master him; while the usual nursery proceeding of making a child's
naughty fit end with an expression of contrition shattered on
Cuffy's obstinacy. If he did not feel sorry, he would not say he
was; and in the battle royal that ensued he generally came off
victor. The fact was, in the dark-eyed mite she had now to deal
with, Mary ran up against more than a dash of her own resolute
spirit; and naturally enough failed to recognise it.</p>

<p>"He's got a shocking will of his own. And what troubles me,
Richard, is, if he's as set as all this when he's not much more
than a baby, whatever will he be when he grows up?"</p>

<p>"Set? Nonsense, my dear! The child's got character. Give it
scope to expand. Try to influence him and work on his good feelings
instead of bullying him."</p>

<p>"It's all very well for you. You don't have to deal with him a
dozen times a day. I must say, I sometimes think you might help a
little more than you do." It was a sore point with Mary that
Richard would not rise to his responsibilities as a father, but
went on leading the life of a bookworm and a recluse. "Especially
as the child takes more notice of you than of any one else."</p>

<p>But Mahony was not to be bought. "My dear, you've the knack and
I haven't. Now don't worry. As long as he's honest and truthful,
he'll be all right."</p>

<p>Honest?...truthful? That went without saying! It was only that
Mary wanted her first-born to be so much more: sunny, lovable,
transparent, brave&mdash;and a hundred other things besides. He was
Nurse's darling though. You had only, said Nannan, to beware of
knocking up against any of his funny little fads, such as
undressing him before people, or asking him to eat with any but his
own silver fork and spoon.</p>

<p>"What Master Cuffy needs is just a bit of managing. I can twist
him round my little finger." But it did not tally with Mary's ideas
that a child of that age should have to be "managed" at all.</p>

<p>Turning from these traits in her son of which she could not
approve, she dwelt with pleasure on his marked quickness and
cleverness. Cuffy had sure fingers and a retentive memory. At an
early age he could catch a ball and trundle a hoop; could say his
prayers without prompting; learn nursery rhymes at a single
hearing; could eat nicely, keep himself clean, button up those of
his buttons which were within reach: in short do everything in this
line that could be expected of so young a mortal.</p>

<p>And in addition he had one genuine talent. For some reason or
other&mdash;"a throwback to his grandmother," supposed
Mahony&mdash;Cuffy had been dowered with a natural gift for music.
He learnt tunes more easily than he learnt his letters; could hum
"Rock of Ages" and "Sun of my Soul" before he uttered a word. His
ear was extraordinarily good, his little voice sweet and true. And
knowing that Mary's intonation was but faulty, that of the nursery
faultier still, Mahony here put in his single spoke in Cuffy's
education. He had the boy brought to his dressing-room of a
morning; and there, while he dressed, Cuffy with his elephant would
sit perched on a corner of the table, singing songs old and new.
Together Mahony and his son practised "Oft in the Stilly Night" and
"The Land o' the Leal," and with such success that, was there
company to dinner, Cuffy in his best velvet tunic would be stood on
a chair at dessert, to perform to the guests. And as he gave forth,
in baby language, such ditties as:</p>

<p>A temple to friendship,<br>
Cried Laura, enchanted,<br>
I'll build in my garden<br>
The thought is divine!</p>

<p>The ladies uttered rapturous exclamations; while the gentlemen,
mostly without a note of music in them, declared: "'pon my word,
very remarkable, very remarkable indeed!" and Aunt Lizzie, from
whom cuffy had picked up this song by ear, hailed him as an infant
prodigy, and painted for him a future that made Mary's heart swell
with pride.</p>

<p>Such were Mahony's children.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-2" id="ch-2-3-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>Mrs. Marriner, the youngish widow whose acquaintance Mary had
made while visiting on the Urquharts' station, was a person of
character. In the matter of dress, for example, she defied the
prevailing fashion; wore her light brown hair swept straight back
from her brow (which was classic), and, employing neither net nor
comb, twisted it in a Grecian knot on the nape of her neck. She
also eschewed crinoline, and wandered a tall, willowy form, the
eyed of all beholders.</p>

<p>"Out and away too conspicuous!" was Mahony's verdict. "The woman
must <i>want</i> people to stare at her. Though I will say, Mary,
it's something of a treat to behold the natural female figure
again, after the unnatural bulgings we've put up with. And a very
fine figure, too!"</p>

<p>For this he had to admit: there was nothing unfeminine or
forbidding about the lady. She was as handsome as she was striking.
A full eye, a Grecian nose, a slim waist: such were her charms; to
say nothing of a white, dimpled hand, and a well-turned ankle. And
yet every one who knew her agreed that she captivated less by
reason of her comeliness, than by the ease and elegance of her
manner.</p>

<p>She was just as popular with her own as with the sterner sex.
Which said a good deal; for, wherever she went, she was run after
by "the gentlemen." And small wonder, thought Mary. For Gracey was
up in any subject, however dry; had brains really equal to
"gentlemen's conversation."</p>

<p>Richard said: "It's not the least piquant thing about her that
after she has been holding forth, supremely well, on one of those
learned themes ladies as a rule fight shy of, she will suddenly
lapse into some delightful feminine inconsequence. That, my dear,
gives us men back, for a finish, the sense of superiority we need."
But here you just had one of the satirical remarks Richard was so
apt at making&mdash;especially in the early stages of an
acquaintance. Afterwards he generally had to eat his words, or at
least water them down.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marriner rented a villa within easy driving distance of
"Ultima Thule." This was in the early days of the nursery, while
the twins were still babies in arms, and Mary went out but little.
It fell to the newcomer to pick up the threads; and she did so with
a will, calling frequently and entering wholeheartedly into Mary's
interests. She was devoted to children; and sometimes, as they sat
on the verandah, Nannan would bring Cuffy out to them. And then it
was a pretty sight to see the tall, handsome woman on her knees
before the little child, rolling his woolly ball to him, or playing
at peek-a-bo.</p>

<p>The merry voices lured even Mahony forth from his den. And
having tossed his son in the air, he lingered for a word with his
wife's guest. This happened more than once; after which, as Mary
had foreseen, his sarcasms died away. Mrs. Marriner had travelled
widely, and owned a large collection of photographs of famous
beauty-spots; and the first time Mahony went to her house was when
he and Mary drove over one evening to view these through a
stereoscope. Dotted about the rooms they found many another
interesting memento of her travels. On the chimney-piece were
candelabra of Dresden china. Coloured prints of Venice by night and
the blue grotto of Capri adorned the walls. A statuette of Christ
by a Danish sculptor stood on the lid of the piano. She had a very
fair assortment of books&mdash;serious works, too: essays, poetry,
history&mdash;both old and of the newest; and Mahony carried away
with him a couple of volumes by a modern writer of verse named
Browning.</p>

<p>In addition she was musical. Not in sister Lizzie's superb,
almost professional fashion; but singing in a clear, correct voice,
and playing the pianoforte with neatness and skill. Her performance
of Mendelssohn's <i>Songs Without Words</i> was most enjoyable. And
now it was Mahony's turn to suggest inviting her; after which he
went back to sing duets, and listen to her execution of a sonata by
Haydn. He relished, too, a conversation that for once rose above
the affairs of the nursery.</p>

<p>For, the piano closed, the lady and he dropped into talk. And
having skimmed the surface of various subjects on which they found
themselves in marvellous accord, they came round to the one which
still engrossed Mahony's attention. Of spiritualism Mrs. Marriner
was ignorant; she begged the doctor to enlighten her. And the rough
sketch he gave her interested her so much that she expressed a
strong wish to know more. He promised to bring her an armful of
literature; and then, if her interest still held, to procure her
the entree to a sitting at the house of that arch-spiritualist,
Mrs. Phayre, where remarkable phenomena took place. Weird noises
might be heard there at dead of night: furniture was moved by
unseen hands from its place against the wall.</p>

<p>The next day he carried over the books; and Mrs. Marriner read
them with what seemed to him a rare and unfeminine insight: that is
to say, she was neither alarmed, nor derisive, nor stupidly
obstinate: and, so far, except for members of the inner circle, he
had known no woman whose state of mind towards the question was not
one of these three. She also jumped at his offer of introducing her
at a seance. Later on, learning that he was eager to find an
unprofessional medium with whom he might experiment in private, and
on whom no shadow of suspicion could be held to rest, she herself
proposed sitting at a small table in her drawing-room. And after a
few fruitless hours, during which he had every reason to admire her
patience, they met with success: the table tilted under their hands
and a pencil, delicately sustained by the lady's fingers, wrote
words that could be read. It was plain she was possessed of the
power.</p>

<p>He went home to Mary in high feather.</p>

<p>"Now, perhaps, you'll believe there's something in it!"</p>

<p>"I never said there wasn't <i>something</i>. It's only
that..."</p>

<p>"You can hardly suspect your friend of being an impostor?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious no! The idea!"</p>

<p>And Mary meant it. Gracey was no more capable of downright fraud
than she herself. And yet...yet...say what you liked, there was a
part of you that simply would not accept the conclusions you were
asked to draw. To think, because a table stood on two legs, or a
pencil wrote: "I am here," that dead people&mdash;people who lay
mouldering in their graves!&mdash;were speaking to you...no, that
she would never be able to believe, not if she lived to be
Methusalah. Why, you might just be leaning a little too heavily on
your side of the table without knowing it. Or your hand write
things down in a kind of dream, and you imagine somebody or
something else was doing it. And still be the most truthful person
alive. Like Richard. Who again and again let himself be imposed
on.&mdash;The truth was: if people wanted to believe such things,
believe they would: the wish was father to the thought. Well, at
least this new hobby of Richard's had one advantage: it gave him
something to do. Which was just what he needed. Instead of always
sitting humped up over his books.</p>

<p>Under the stimulus he began to look more like his old self. He
spruced up his dress; and the daily ride to Gracey's gave him
beneficial exercise. As time went on, their sittings proved so
satisfactory that he began to think of publishing a small pamphlet,
embodying the results. And though Mary would rather it had been on
a less outlandish subject, she hailed the idea and encouraged it.
For looking after Richard became, year by year, more like minding a
fidgety child, who had always to be kept on the go. He had been
such a worker in his day. And the old fear could still wake in her
at times that, being without active employment, he might all of a
sudden turn restless and declare himself tired of their lovely
home.</p>

<p>But then came that afternoon when Lizzie let drop an item of
news which successfully routed Mary's peace of mind.</p>

<p>They did not see much of Lizzie nowadays; she and John were
always in society; out night after night at concerts, dinners,
balls. Or else entertaining lavishly in their own home. It was an
open secret that the longed-for knighthood would very soon set the
crown on John's labours for the colony.</p>

<p>Stateliness in person, gauzes and laces floating from arms and
shoulders, trinkets and chains a-jingle, Lizzie swept through the
hall, a majestic figure indeed. No wonder John was still unable to
refuse her anything.</p>

<p>Then, just about to step into her carriage, she paused. "Mary,
dehling...I vow I all but forgot it! I have something to tell you,
love, that I think will interest you. Mary! I met a gentleman on
Friday who was once acquainted with our friend&mdash;the charmin'
Gracey. And <i>what</i> do you think? My dear, she is not a widow
at all."</p>

<p>Mary was thunderstruck. "Not a widow? Lizzie! Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dehling, her husband is still alive. He left her,
love&mdash;deserted her for another woman...the lowest of the low!
At this very moment he lives with the creature...in his lawful
wife's stead."</p>

<p>As always, Mary's first impulse was to protect...defend. "Oh,
poor Gracey!...how terrible for her!"</p>

<p>"Well, love...I thought you ought to know. Since dear Richard is
so friendly there. And considering the ultra-strict views he
holds."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. But, Lizzie, it's not her fault, is it?
<i>She</i> can't help the man she married turning out a
scoundrel."</p>

<p>But though she spoke up thus, Mary was greatly perturbed and her
mind became a sea of doubts where no doubts had been. She found
herself looking at Gracey with other eyes. The fact was, a divorced
or legally separated woman&mdash;even one who was just living apart
from her husband&mdash;was by no means the same as a widow...and
never could be. Gracey knew that well enough; else why, to a close
friend like herself, had she made a mystery of her state? And
though not a shadow of blame should rest on her (and Mary was sure
it didn't), it meant, none the less, that she had been through all
sorts of unpleasant matrimonial experiences, which a properly
married or widowed woman would know nothing about. Something of
them might have remained clinging to her...the old saw about
touching pitch would run in Mary's head. It was dreadful. Such a
dear, nice woman as Gracey. And yet...deep down in Mary's heart
there dwelt the obstinate conviction that once married was always
married, and that as long as your husband lived you belonged at his
side. Did you sit firm and hold fast to your rights as a wife, it
seemed incredible that another woman could ever usurp your place.
Had Gracey perhaps gone off in a tantrum, leaving the coast clear?
Yes, doubts would up, and the result was, she found herself
considering, with a more critical eye, the friendship that had
sprung up between Richard and Grace over their table-tilting. Never
before had she known Richard so absorbed by any one outside his
home. Now suppose, just suppose Gracey, thanks to her wretched
married life, had come to regard things&mdash;serious things,
sacred things&mdash;more lightly than she ought? What if, because
of her own unhappy past, she should not hold the marriage-tie to be
binding? Why was she so attractive to gentlemen? Did they know or
suspect anything? In reply to which there flashed through Mary's
mind a memory of her last visit to Yarangobilly: Willy Urquhart's
infatuation and the state poor Louisa had worked herself into. Of
course there was really no comparison between the two
cases&mdash;none whatever! Willy was a notorious flirt: Richard a
gentleman. And poor Louisa's morbid, distorted outlook would never
be hers.</p>

<p>Richard...The question that teased Mary was, should she tell him
what she had heard, or keep it to herself? In one way she agreed
with Lizzie that he ought to know, he being so fastidious in his
views. Besides, if he heard it from some other source, he might
feel aggrieved that she had held back. On the other hand, his
knowing would probably curtail, if not put a stop altogether to his
and Gracey's experiments: he wouldn't want to give people food for
talk. And that would be a pity. Would it be disloyal to say
nothing? Disloyal to Gracey to tell what she so plainly wished to
keep dark? But Richard came first.&mdash;And here again, unlike
poor Louisa, Mary felt she could weigh the matter very calmly; for
in her was a feeling nothing could shake: the happily married
woman's sense of possession. It was not only the fact of Richard
being what he was. Their life together rested on the surest of
foundations: the experiences of many, how many years; the trials
and tribulations they had been through together; the joys they had
shared; the laughs they had had over things and people; a complete
knowledge of each other's prejudices and antipathies&mdash;who else
could unlock, with half a word, the rich storehouse of memories
they had in common? Homelier things, too, there were in plenty,
which bound no less closely: the airing and changing of your
underlinen; how sweet or how strong you drank your coffee; how you
liked your bed made; your hatred of the touch of steel on fruit; of
a darn in a sock.&mdash;Deeper down though, pushed well below the
topmost layer of her consciousness, just one unspoken fear
<i>did</i> lurk. If she told Richard what she had heard, and he did
not take it in the spirit he had hitherto invariably shown towards
irregularities of this kind, Mary knew she would feel both hurt and
humiliated. Not for herself&mdash;but for him.</p>

<p>The sitting at an end, the table was put back in its place
against the wall.</p>

<p>"You will smoke, doctor? Nay, please do...I like it. Here are
matches.&mdash;Down, Rover! Not yet, Fitz!" For at her movement a
red setter had sprung up from a corner, and now stood, his front
paws on her knee, ingratiatingly wagging his tail; while observing
his comrade's advance an immense black cat, which had been dozing
in an arm-chair, rose and dropped a kind of bob-curtsey with its
hind quarters. "Behold my two tyrants! They think it time for a
run.&mdash;Oh, yes, Mr. Fitz comes too."</p>

<p>"You are very fond of animals?"</p>

<p>"I should be lost without them. They are such dear companions,
in their dumb way." As she spoke Mrs. Marriner fondled a silky ear,
letting it slip through a pretty, dimpled hand.</p>

<p>"Well do I know it. In my bachelor days, living in a bark-hut
the whole of which would have gone into this room, I kept no less
than three." And casting the net of his memory Mahony told of his
long-forgotten pets, and of their several untimely
ends.&mdash;"After that I took no more."</p>

<p>"You had not the heart?" Now could any but a genuine
animal-lover have put this question?</p>

<p>"Not exactly. But as a hard-worked medico, with a growing
practice...the burden of them, you see, would have fallen on my
wife. And she does not much care for animals."</p>

<p>"Dear Mary. And now, of course, she has her babies."</p>

<p>"Yes, and all a mother's fears for them, with regard to the
four-footed race."</p>

<p>"That is but natural. While they are so tiny." In the kindly
indulgence of her tone, the speaker seemed to take all mothers and
their weaknesses under her wing. "And yet, doctor, if I had been
blessed with little ones, I think I should have brought up babies,
puppies and kittens <i>en masse</i>...as one family party. Correct
me though, if I speak foolishly. Perhaps, when children come, they
are all in all."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> amazing how the little beggars twine themselves
round one's heart. Before my boy was born, my chief feeling was a
sense of the coming responsibility. I can laugh at myself now. For
my wife has shouldered everything of that sort...I leave the
children entirely to her."</p>

<p>"I think dear Mary quite the most capable person I know."</p>

<p>What a handsome creature she was, to be sure, full-bosomed yet
slender, her neat waist held by a silver girdle, her face alight
with sympathy and understanding! Mahony answered heartily: "There
have, indeed, been few situations in life Mary has not proved equal
to."</p>

<p>The words set a string of memories vibrating; and a silence
fell. Unlike many of her sex, who would have babbled on, the lady
just smiled and waited; and even her waiting was perfect in
tact.</p>

<p>Mahony felt drawn to unbosom himself. "Talking of my
children...it is sometimes a sorry thought to me that my
acquaintance with them can only be a brief one. I mean, the
probability is I shall see them but to the threshold of their adult
life&mdash;no further. And would like so well to know what they
make of it."</p>

<p>His meaning was grasped...and with ease. "I understand
that...especially in the case of such a gifted child as your sweet
little Cuffy."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do think the boy is quick beyond the common run."</p>

<p>"Without doubt he is. Look at his musical ability."</p>

<p>"Ah, there you mention the one bit of his education I take a
hand in. For Mary has no ear for music. Nor even any particular
liking for it."</p>

<p>"And it is so important, is it not, that the ear should be well
trained from the first? The spadework done before the child is even
aware of it." (Here spoke your true musician.) "But, doctor, if our
findings are correct, you may still have the joy of watching over
your little brood from the other side...<i>n'est-ce-pas?</i>"</p>

<p>"Ah!...if that might be. If one could be sure of that." And on
the instant Mahony mounted his hobby-horse and was carried away.
"With this, my dear lady, you put your finger on what seems to me
one of the vital points of the whole question. Have you ever
reflected what a difference it would make, did we mortals
<i>seriously</i> believe in a life to come?...I don't mean the
Jewish-Byzantine state of petrified adoration that the churches
offer us...I mean a life such as we know it: a continuation of the
best of this earthly existence&mdash;mental striving, spiritual
aspiration, love for our neighbour. If we did so believe, our every
perspective would alter. And the result be a marked increase in
spirituality. For the orthodox Christian's point of view is too
often grossly materialistic&mdash;and superstitious. The tenacity
with which he clings to a resurrection of the flesh&mdash;this poor
cankered flesh!...after countless years deep in its
grave&mdash;that grave on which he dwells with so morbid a
pleasure. Or his childish fear of death&mdash;despite the glories
that are promised him on the other side...do these not remind you
of the sugar-candy with which an infant is bribed to take its pill?
Against all this, set the belief that in dying we pass but from one
room to another of the house of life&mdash;Christ's 'many
mansions.' The belief that an invisible world exists around
us&mdash;the spirit counterpart of this we know. That those we have
lost still live and love and await us...on the other side of a veil
which already a few, of rarer perceptions than the rest, have
pierced.&mdash;But forgive me! When once I get going on this
subject I know no measure. And I confess...so few opportunities to
talk of it arise. My wife has scant sympathy with the movement;
sees, I fear, only its shady side."</p>

<p>"Dearest Mary. She is so practically minded."</p>

<p>"Yes. She is often genuinely uneasy at the hours I spend over my
books; would rather have me up and doing&mdash;and though but
riding for pleasure along the seashore. Books to her are only a
means of killing time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Marriner turned the full weight of a grave, sweet smile
upon him. "While we book-lovers...well! as far as I am concerned,
doctor, my life would be a blank indeed, without the company of the
printed page."</p>

<p>"And what of me?...whose dearest dream it was, while I slaved
for a living, to be able to end my days in a library. I declare to
you, it is still a disturbing thought that I shall die leaving so
many books unread."</p>

<p>"Let me comfort you. My dear father, who lived to a ripe old
age, was given to complaining towards the end that he had 'read all
the books'&mdash;or at least all that were worth reading."</p>

<p>"Of course; as one grows older; and harder to please...Myself
though, I seem still far from that. The lists I send my bookseller
grow longer, not shorter. And it's not the unread books only. While
we're on these ghost-thoughts&mdash;we all have them, I
suppose&mdash;let me confess to another, and that is that I shall
probably need to go, having seen all too few of the grandeurs and
beauties of this world. Pass on to the next without knowing what
the Alps or the Andes are like, or the torrents of the Rhine."</p>

<p>"But doctor...what hinders you? I don't mean the
Andes,"&mdash;and Mahony was the recipient of a roguish smile. "But
travel is so easy nowadays. One packs one's trunks, books one's
berth&mdash;<i>et voila</i>! What hinders you?"</p>

<p>Ah! what...what, indeed? Mahony hesitated for a moment before
replying. "The truth is, the years we spent in England were
thoroughly uncongenial...to us both. We were glad, on getting back
to the colony, to settle down. And having once settled..."</p>

<p>Yes, that was it: of his own free will he had saddled himself
with a big, expensive house, and all that belonged to its upkeep:
men-servants and maid-servants, horses and carriages. Mary had
taken root immediately; and now the children...their tender
age...But darker than all else loomed Mary's attitude...or what
might he expect this to be, if&mdash;"The truth is, my wife does
not...I mean she has gone through so many upheavals already, on my
account, that I should hardly feel justified...again...so
soon...Still there's no denying it: I do sometimes feel like an old
hulk which lies stranded. But there! All my days I've been gnawed
by the worm of change&mdash;change of any sort. As a struggling
medico I longed for leisure and books. Pinned to the colony, I
would be satisfied with nothing but the old country. Now that I
have ample time, and more books than I can read, I could wish to be
up and out seeing the world. And my dear wife naturally finds it
difficult to keep pace with such a weathercock."</p>

<p>"I think it is with you as the German poet sings: 'There, where
thou art not, there alone is bliss!'"</p>

<p>"Indeed and that hits my nail squarely on the head. For I can
assure you it's no mere spirit of discontent&mdash;as some suppose.
It's more a kind of...well, it's like reaching out after&mdash;say,
a dream one has had and half forgotten, and struggles to recapture.
That's baldly put. But perhaps you will understand."</p>

<p>A lengthy silence followed. The clock ticked; the dog sighed
gustily. Then, feeling the moment come, the lady rose and swept her
skirts to the piano. "Let me play to you," said she.</p>

<p>Mahony gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>Once the music had begun, however, he fell back on his own
reflections; they were quickened rather than hampered by the
delicate tinkling of the piano. He felt strangely elated: not a
doubt of it, a good talk was one of the best of medicines,
particularly for such a dry, bottled-up old fogy as he was on the
verge of becoming. Of course, did you open your heart you must
have, for listener, one who was in perfect tune with you; who could
pick up your ideas as you dropped them; take your meaning at a
word. And mortals of this type were all too rare; in respect of
them, his life had been a sandy waste. Which had told heavily
against him. Looking down the years he saw that, all through, his
most crying need had been for spiritual companionship; for the balm
of tastes akin to his own. It was a crippling reflection that never
yet had he found the person to whom he could have blurted out his
thoughts without fear of being misunderstood...or disapproved...or
smiled at for an oddity. Here, having unexpectedly tapped a woman's
quick perception, a woman's lively sympathy, he had a swift vision
of what might have been&mdash;that misty picture that inhabits the
background of most minds. To know his idiosyncrasies fondly
accepted&mdash;his mental gropings accompanied, his roving spirit
gauged and condoned...not as any fault of his own, but as an innate
factor in his blood! Ah! but for that to come to pass, one would
need to leave choosing one's fellow-traveller on the long
life-journey until one's own mind and character had formed and
ripened. How could one tell, in the twenties, what one would be on
nearing the fifties?&mdash;in which direction one would have
branched out, and set, and stiffened? At twenty all was glamour and
romance; and it seemed then to matter little whether or no a heart
was open to the sufferings of the brute creation; whether the
written word outweighed the spoken; in how far the spiritual
mysteries made appeal&mdash;questions which gradually, with time,
came to seem more vital than all else. In youth one's nature cried
aloud for companionship...one's blood ran hot...the mysteries
played no part. And then the years passed and passed, and one
drifted...drifted...slowly, but very surely...until...well, in many
a case, he supposed the fact that you <i>had</i> drifted never came
to your consciousness at all. But should anything happen to pull
you up with a jerk, force you to cast the plummet; should you get
an inkling of something rarer and finer: then, the early flames
being sunk to a level glow, you stood confounded by your
aloofness...by the distance you had travelled...the isolation of
your state. But had he, in sooth, ever felt other than lonely, and
alone? Mary was&mdash;had always been&mdash;dearest and best of
wives...yet...yet...had they, between them, a single idea in
common?...Did they share an interest, a liking, a point of
view?&mdash;with the one exception of an innate sobriety and
honesty of purpose. No, for more years than he cared to count, Mary
had done little, as far as he was concerned, but sit in judgment:
she silently censured, mentally condemned all those things in life
which he held most worth while: his needs, his studies, his
inclinations&mdash;down to his very dreams and hopes of a
hereafter.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Lizzie said: "My dear, our lady friend is in hoops now, if you
please! Nothing extreme, of course, considering from whom she takes
her present cue. <i>Just</i> the desired
<i>soupcon!</i>&mdash;Mary, she went about as a Slim Jane only
because the <i>cavalier</i> of the moment approved the simplicity
of the human form divine. To-day she is a rapping and tapping
medium&mdash;as we very well know. To-morrow, love, the wind will
shift to another quarter, and we shall hear of the fair lady
running to matins and communicating on an empty stomach. Or
visiting in a prison cell got up as a nursing sister, <i>A la</i>
Elizabeth Fry."</p>

<p>Hoops...nothing extreme...considering from whom she takes her
present cue. At these words, and even while she was standing up for
Gracey's sincerity, there leapt to Mary's mind, with a stab of real
pain, Richard's nervous hatred of the exaggerated&mdash;the
bizarre. And whether it was hoops, or hooplessness.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-3" id="ch-2-3-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>These rather waspish comments&mdash;Lizzie never seemed able to
resist having a thrust at Gracey&mdash;were made in the
drawing-room at "Ultima Thule," where the two wives sat waiting for
their husbands to rejoin them. John and Lizzie were dining there at
John's express request: the groom had ridden over after lunch with
a line from John, asking if he and Lizzie might take pot-luck with
them that evening. Richard said: "Wonders will never cease," and a
refusal was not to be thought of; but Cook had been very put out by
the shortness of the notice; so much so that Mary had driven to
town to fetch delicacies; thinking as she went, how in the old days
<i>she</i> would have run up a dinner for four, and one well worth
eating, too, in less than an hour. Her hands did sometimes itch to
show such a fair-weather worker as Cook what could be done.</p>

<p>By now the evening was more than half gone, and still the
gentlemen lingered; though Lizzie had sung all Richard's favourite
songs and pieces, some of them more than once. To pass the time,
she had also sung to Cuffy; for&mdash;as had happened ere this when
she was dining there &mdash;Nannan had knocked to say Master Cuffy
could not be got to sleep, for thinking his Auntie might sing to
him. Cuffy as audience was better than none, so Lizzie begged for
the child to be brought in; and thereupon Cuffy appeared on
Nannan's arm in his little red flannel nightgown, his feet swathed
in a crib&mdash;blanket, his eyes alight with expectation. Seated
on his mother's knee he drank in: "There was a Friar of Orders
Grey," and the sad ditty of "Barbara Allan," himself rendering "Sun
of my Soul" before, soundly kissed and cosseted by his aunt, who
had a great liking for the little man, he was carried back to
bed.</p>

<p>Towards ten o'clock, Lizzie could no longer conceal her yawns.
Mary and she had talked themselves out: and where she had first
surreptitiously peeped, she now openly drew her watch from her
belt. This, John's latest present to her, was a magnificent affair,
crusted back and front with diamonds, while tiny brilliants
sprinkled the long gold chain on which it hung. Unlike most women,
Lizzie could wear any quantity of jewellery without looking
overloaded. At the present moment a little heap of rings and
bracelets lay on the lid of the piano; for, in despair, she had
re-seated herself at the keys and begun anew to sing.</p>

<p>At the best of times Mary found it hard to fix her mind on music
for five minutes together; and on this evening she had had more
than enough of it, and could now let her thoughts stray in comfort.
She wondered what could be keeping the two men...it was certainly
rather impolite of Richard...wondered if Nannan had at last got
Cuffy to sleep. The dinner had been very nice; Cook needn't have
made so much fuss beforehand. But there! When they undertook
anything of this kind, it usually went off well. The house, of
course, had something to do with it. This room, for instance, how
well it lighted up! Richard declared he much preferred it to
John's, and Mary's eyes wandered lovingly round walls and
furniture, lingering on the great gilt-edged mirror, which reached
to the ceiling; the lovely girandoles, a present from Richard; the
lustred chandelier; the glass-shaded ormolu clock. The carpet, too,
was of a most uncommon lemon colour; the suite, in a brocade to
match, had a pattern of French lilies on it. She loved every inch
of the place. <i>What</i> a happy ending to all their ups and
downs!...to be settled at last in such a home. Did she look back on
the "Black Hole," or the snails and damp of Buddlecombe, she felt
she did not always fully appreciate her present good fortune.</p>

<p>But Lizzie here striking up a tune Mary knew, her thoughts came
back with a jerk. She eyed the singer in listening, and: "Handsomer
than ever" was her mental comment; although by now Lizzie was
embarked on that adventure which, more than any other, steals from
a woman's good looks. What with her full, exquisitely sloping
shoulders&mdash;they stood out of the low-cut bertha as out of a
cup&mdash;her dimpled arms and hands, the fingers elegantly curled
on the notes of the piano; her rich red lips, opening to show the
almond-white teeth; her massive throat, swelling and beating as she
sang...yes, Lizzie had indeed thriven on matrimony. It was
otherwise with John. One had grown gradually used, as time passed,
to the loss of that air of radiant health, of masterful assertion,
which had formerly distinguished him. But since his marriage he had
turned almost into an old man. Thin as a lath, he walked with a
slight stoop, and hair and beard were grey. His face seemed to have
grown longer, too, more cadaverous; his eye had an absent, inturned
expression. At dinner he had been very silent. He had just sat
there listening to Lizzie, hanging on her lips&mdash;really, if he
went on like this when the two of them were at a stranger's house,
it would not be quite the thing.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in the drawing-room, Lizzie had made open complaint
of his inertia; discussing him in that barefaced way of hers which
plumed itself on calling a spade a spade.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is growing stodgy, dehling&mdash;stodgy and slow! I
said to him the other day, I said: 'John, love! this will
<i>never</i> do. <i>Where</i> is the man I married?' Will you
believe it, Mary, he actually wished to stop at home from
Government House Ball last night? While this evening, if you
please, he throws up an important dinner-party at Sir Joshua
Dent's, to come here. Not but what it has been a <i>charmin'</i>
evening, dehling. But a man in John's position has not the right to
pick and choose."</p>

<p>"Are you sure he is quite well, Lizzie? He looks very thin to
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, yes! Perfectly well. John was never made to be
fat."</p>

<p>The laggards at length appearing, Lizzie crashed out a chord and
rose from the piano-stool to hail and reproach them. "A pretty pair
to be sure," cried she playfully yet not without malice, the while
she slid on rings and clicked the catches of bracelets; a pretty
pair of husbands to prefer the society of their pipes to that of
their wives! She had been so looking forward to a duo with Richard.
It was evident she had reckoned without her host! Richard made one
lame attempt to fall in with her tone, John none at all. He seemed
only in haste to go; asked for the carriage to be brought round at
once; himself rang the bell and gave the order.</p>

<p>Lizzie might be too full of her own grievances to notice how the
wind blew; but Mary had eyes in her head. She saw that something
was seriously amiss the moment the two men entered the room.
Richard looked pale and distracted&mdash;and as for John! Whatever
could be the matter? Had they quarrelled?...had a scene?</p>

<p>Then, in coming along the passage from the bedroom, with Lizzie
enshawled at her side, she caught a murmured word of Richard's that
was evidently meant only for John's ear. And when she had seen her
guests off she did not re-enter the house, but stood on the
verandah, anxiously awaiting Richard who had gone to open the
gate.</p>

<p>At the crunch of his feet on the gravel, she moved forward,
exclaiming impetuously before she was level with him: "What's the
matter? What was wrong with John to-night?"</p>

<p>"Matter? What on earth do you mean?" He stooped to pick up
something; was exaggeratedly casual and indifferent.</p>

<p>"Now, dear, you needn't put on that tone to me. I saw directly
you came into the room...have you and he fallen out?"</p>

<p>"Good God, no! What have you got in your head now?"</p>

<p>"Well, then what is it? You can't deceive me, Richard...you
don't look like that for nothing."</p>

<p>"Who wants to deceive you, I'd like to know?" He was very short
and gruff.</p>

<p>"Is John ill?"</p>

<p>"My dear Mary, don't try and <i>pump</i> me, if you please! You
know my aversion to that kind of thing."</p>

<p>"Richard, I heard with my own ears what you said to him in the
hall...about a possible loophole. What did you mean? Oh,
<i>don't</i> be so obstinate!&mdash;Very well, then! I shall go
over and see John myself, the first thing in the morning."</p>

<p>"Indeed and you'll do nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"He's my brother. I've a right to know what's happened."</p>

<p>"A confidence is a confidence; and I'm hanged if I'll be
hectored into betraying it."</p>

<p>"Anyone would think I was asking out of mere curiosity," cried
Mary; and tears of vexation rose to her eyes. "I know&mdash;I have
the feeling&mdash;there's something wrong. And you go on talking
about confidences...and your own pride in not betraying them...when
John looked to me as if he'd got his death sentence."</p>

<p>Richard's start did not escape her. He retorted, though less
surely: "But it is at his own urgent request, Mary, that I hold my
tongue!"</p>

<p>"Then he <i>did</i> come to consult you about his health? Oh,
Richard, please!...don't keep me in suspense. What is it?"</p>

<p>"My dear, if you had gone through what I did to-night! I suppose
I may as well out with it; for as usual with your wild shot you
have hit the bull's-eye. The fact of the matter is, what I had to
tell John did amount to a sentence of death."</p>

<p>"Then...then it is..."</p>

<p>"The worst. I examined him. A growth in the liver. No, too late
now, for anything of that kind. My private opinion is he hasn't
more than six months to live."</p>

<p>"<i>Richard!</i>...though I think I've been afraid of something
like this...it's just as if, inside me, I had felt what was
coming."</p>

<p>"And I suspected it. But you know, Mary, what John is...so
unapproachable. I must say this though: I was moved this evening to
a profound admiration for him. He took the verdict like a
man...without flinching."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. But what does that matter now? The thing is, you've
let him go home alone&mdash;with this on his mind&mdash;and only
Lizzie beside him...who cares for no one but herself." Mary had not
known she thought this of Lizzie; it just popped out.</p>

<p>"A great spider!...that's what the woman is, if you want my
opinion," cried Mahony angrily. "But what could I
do?&mdash;Besides, at heart, I'm one with him. There are crises in
a man's life that are best fought through alone."</p>

<p>"Not while I'm here. Where I'm going? Why, to him, of
course!"</p>

<p>"At this hour of night? Indeed I advise you very strongly, Mary,
to do nothing of the kind. Not only will he resent&mdash;and
rightly too&mdash;my having broken my word, but he won't thank you
either for intruding.&mdash;And he'll have gone to bed. How can you
knock him up? What excuse have you?"</p>

<p>Mary reached for a wrap and threw it over her shoulders. "John
won't be in bed. And I'll make it all right about you; don't be
afraid.&mdash;No, no, I'll just walk over. As for intruding...I've
always understood John better than any of you. Besides, I don't see
how people can care whether they do or not at a time like
this."</p>

<p>"Well, at least put on a pair of sound walking-boots and take a
shawl. Of course I am. If you must go, I go with you."</p>

<p>Stepping out of the gate they plodded through the sand of the
road that led past now a large garden, now a wild, open space
covered with gorse and heath. Masses of firs stood out black and
forbidding. In the distance could be heard the faint lapping of the
sea.</p>

<p>They walked in silence. Once only did Mary exclaim aloud, out of
the many conflicting thoughts that were going round in her head:
"Lizzie, of course, must know nothing. The last thing John will
want is for her to be worried or upset."</p>

<p>And Mahony: "It will not be long now before she and every one
else has to know."</p>

<p>"When I think...how...how proud she has been of it all&mdash;I
mean John's position...and their entertainments...and his
future&mdash;how she has looked forward to the title coming...Oh
dear, oh dear! If only Jinny were beside him now...or poor dear
Emma."</p>

<p>On reaching the house they unlatched the gate with care, and
crept like a pair of conspirators over the grass, to avoid the
noise their steps would have made on the gravel. The venetian
blinds were down, but bars of light filtered through them in
Lizzie's bedroom on the one side, and in John's sanctum on the
other. Mary tiptoed round the verandah, and tapped on her brother's
window-pane.</p>

<p>"It is I, John...Mary."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, then the French window was
noiselessly opened, and she disappeared inside the room.</p>

<p>On the front verandah a rocking-chair had been left standing.
Mahony sat down in it and waited...and waited. Time passed; an
hour...two hours...and still Mary did not return. Lizzie's light
had long ago gone out; not a sound came from the house; nor did any
living thing move in garden or road. So absolute was the stillness
that, more than once as he sat, he heard a petal drop from a
camellia in the central bed. John had a fine show of these stiff,
scentless flowers. They stood out, white and waxen, against the
dark polish of their leaves.</p>

<p>It was spring, and a night warm enough to release the scents of
freesia and boronia; though as usual the pittosporums outdid all
else. There was no moon; but the stars made up for that; the sky
was powdered white with them&mdash;was one vast field of glittering
silver. Leaning back in his chair Mahony lay looking up at them and
thinking the old, well-worn thoughts that besiege a mortal at sight
of the Creator's prodigality. Pigmy man's insignificance in face of
these millions of worlds; the preposterousness of the claim that
his tiny existence can engage the personal notice of Him who has
strewn the Milky Way; and yet the bitter reality of his small, mad
miseries, the bottomless depths of his mental anguish: pain, as the
profoundest of life's truths, the link by which man is bound up
with the Eternal...pain that bites so much deeper than pleasure,
outlasting pleasure's froth and foam as granite outlasts
thistledown.</p>

<p>And now John's link was being forged...his turn had come to
taste pain's bitterness&mdash;John who, all his days, had looked
haughtily down on weakness and decay, as touching others, not
himself. The material things of this world had been his pride and
his concern. His soul, that poor soul which Mary, once more the
comforter, was standing by in its black hour, had gone needy and
untended. Now he was being called on to leave everything he prized:
marriage and happiness, wealth, a proud standing, ambition crowned.
Never, in his forward march, had John looked deeper; though in his
own way he had walked according to his lights: a man of enterprise
and energy, upright in business, grappling with the hardships of a
new country, a pathfinder for those who would come after.&mdash;Yet
for all this, a strangely unsympathetic nature! It was not alone
the absence of the spiritual in him. It was the cold, proud, narrow
fashion in which he had lived enclosed in his earthy shell, keeping
the door rigidly shut on intruders. No one had really known
John&mdash;known what manner of man housed within. Perhaps he had
acted thus out of fear; had been afraid of the strange fears that
might be found in him. Afraid of his fellows discovering that he
was hollow, a sham and a pretence, where they had imagined
wonderful strength and lovely virtues.</p>

<p>Well!...be that as it might. The time was past for probing and
conjecturing. John's hour had struck; and the phantom which had
thus far borne his name, striding confident and alert through the
world of men, would soon be blotted out. However one looked at it,
it was a melancholy business. The swiftness of the blow made one
realise, anew, on the edge of what an abyss one walked. Life was
like a procession that trooped along this perilous margin, brimful
of hope and vigour, gay, superbly unthinking; and then of a sudden
there was a gap in the ranks, and one of the train had vanished,
had pitched head-foremost into the depths, to be seen no
more&mdash;by mortal eyes at least. Such a disaster must surely
say&mdash;to those who had pinned their hearts to this world, with
no more than a conventional faith in one to come (which amounted to
little or none)&mdash;must surely seem to say: take all you can get
while there is still time! A little while and it may be too late.
Even in himself, who had won through to the belief that life was a
kind of semi-sleep, death the great awakening, it called up the old
nervous fear of being snatched away before he was ready to go. One
lived on...<i>he</i> lived on...inactive as a vegetable...and at
any moment the blow might fall, and his chance be gone for
ever&mdash;of doing what he had meant to do, of seeing what he had
meant to see. And now, sitting there under the multitudinous stars,
Mahony let the smothered ache for movement, the acute longing for
change of scene that was smouldering in him, come to full
consciousness. Yes, there was no denying it: the old restlessness
was strong on him again; he was tired of everything he
knew&mdash;tired of putting on his clothes in the morning and
taking them off at night; tired of nursery talk and the well-known
noises about the house, and the faces he saw every day. Tired of
his books, too, and of his own familiar company. He wanted fresh
scenes and people; wanted to open his eyes on new surroundings; be
on the move again&mdash;feel a deck under his feet, and the rigours
of a good head wind&mdash;all this, while health and a semblance of
youth were left him. Another few years and he would be past
enjoying it. Now was the time to make the break...cut his
bonds...front Mary's grief and displeasure.</p>

<p>Mary. At her name the inner stiffening, the resistance, with
which his mind had approached her, yielded; and in its place came a
warm uprush of feeling. Her behaviour this very night&mdash;how
surely and fearlessly she had come to the stricken man's aid,
without a single hampering thought of self! There was nobody like
Mary in a crisis: happy the mortal who, when his end came, had her
great heart to lean on. That was worth all else. For of what use,
in one's last hour, would be the mental affinity, the ties of
intellect he had lately so pitied himself for having missed? One
would see these things then for the earth-trimmings they were. A
child faced with the horrors of the dark does not ask for his fears
to be shared, or to have their origin explained to him. He cries
for warm, enfolding arms with which to keep his terrors at bay; or
which, if met these must be, alone can help him through the ordeal.
Man on his death-bed was little more than such a child; and it was
for the mother-arms he craved, to which he clung in passing, until,
again like a child, he had dropped to sleep. Hope, faith and love,
these three...yes, but needed was a love like Mary's, compounded of
utter selflessness, and patience, and infinite forbearance&mdash;a
love which it was impossible to sin against or overthrow...which
had more than a touch of the divine in it; was a dim image of that
infinite tenderness God Himself might be assumed to bear towards
the helpless beings He had created. Measured by it, all other human
experience rang hollow.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-4" id="ch-2-3-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>Mamma and Papa were going away; Master Cuffy would need to be a
<i>very</i> good boy and do everything he was told; so that Mamma
would be pleased with him when she came back. Thus Nannan, while
Eliza and she gave the three children their morning bath; and four
blue and two black eyes were turned on her in curiosity and
wonderment. Cuffy, extending his arm to have the raindrops rubbed
off it, echoed her words: "Mamma and Papa goin' away!" It sounded
exciting.</p>

<p>After breakfast he broke the news to Effalunt, who, though now
in his old age, hairless, and a leg short, was still one of the
best beloveds; for Cuffy had a faithful heart.</p>

<p>Going away? What would it be like? Hi-spy-hi in the garden?...or
a pitchnick?...or Mamma putting on a pretty dress wif beads round
her neck?</p>

<p>He played at it during the morning: he got under an opossum-rug
and was a bear to the Dumplings, and go'ed away. Later on, he was
allowed to crawl inside a leather trunk that stood in Mamma's
bedroom, and have the lid <i>nearly</i> shut over him.</p>

<p>The carriage came round after lunch; the trunk was hoisted to
the roof; Mamma and Papa had their bonnets on.</p>

<p>There stood Nannan, a Dumpling's hand in each of hers. The
babies, though o-eyed, were serene; but Cuffy by now was not so
sure. He had watched Mamma's dresses being put into the trunk and
Eliza sitting on it, to make it shut; and the thing that worried
him was, how Mamma could get up in the morning if her clothes were
locked inside the big box. He began to feel uncomfortable. And so,
now the moment had come, he was busy being a horse, capering up and
down the verandah, stamping, tossing his head.</p>

<p>The Dumplings obediently put up their faces and offered their
bud-mouths. Cuffy had to be called to order.</p>

<p>Said Mary: "Why, darling, aren't you coming to kiss Mamma and
Papa good-bye? Or be a little sorry they're going?"</p>

<p>Sorry? Why? He hadn't been naughty! Perfunctorily Cuffy did what
was required of him, but his heart went on being a horse.</p>

<p>It was not till night that the trouble broke. Then, as often as
Nannan entered the nursery, he was sitting bolt upright and
wide-eyed in his crib, his little face looking each time wanner and
whiter as he piped: "Is Cuffy's Mamma and Papa tum 'ome yet,
Nannan?"</p>

<p>"There you have it!" said Nurse to Eliza. "This is what happens
when gentlemen get to interfering in things they don't understand.
If the doctor 'ud just 'ave let me say they were gone to a party,
there'd 'ave been none of this. Master Cuffy knows well enough what
a party is, and though it 'ad lasted for weeks it wouldn't 'ave
made any difference to him, bless 'is little heart! It's the things
they <i>don't</i> understand that worries children. This fad now
that they must 'ave nothing but the truth told 'em. Lord bless you!
If we did that, there soon wouldn't be any more children
left...nothing but little old men and women."</p>

<p>And to mark her disapproval of Mahony's methods, Nannan kept the
forbidden lamp alight, and sat by the cribside with Cuffy's hand in
hers till he fell asleep.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mary and Richard had taken the afternoon train to
Ballarat. For the date set for Tilly's marriage had come right in
the middle of the trouble about John.</p>

<p>Seated in a saloon carriage Mary undid her bonnet-strings and
put her feet up on the cushions. Off at last! And opposite her sat
Richard&mdash;a morose and unamiable Richard, it was true, who made
it abundantly plain that he was being dragged to Ballarat against
his will. Still, there he was, and that was the main thing. Up to
the last minute she hadn't felt sure of him.</p>

<p>She had early determined that it was his duty to be present at
Tilly's wedding, and had spared no pains to win him over. Hadn't it
to a certain extent been his fault that Tilly's plans had failed,
the time she stayed with them before Cuffy was born? If he had not
been so down on her, the plot she was hatching might then and there
have come to a head. As it was, one thing after another had
happened to delay the issue. Misunderstanding Tilly's abrupt
departure, Purdy had disappeared up-country again, on his
commercial rounds. Then, still up-country somewhere, he had been in
a frightful buggy-accident, pitching out head-foremost, and all but
breaking his neck. For months nothing could be heard of him, he
lying at death's door with concussion and broken bones, in a little
bush hospital. When Tilly did finally contrive to run him to earth,
he was literally at his last farthing, and a sick and broken man.
Tilly had behaved like her own splendid self: waiving any false
pride, she had journeyed straight to see him; and at their very
first meeting they had arrived at an understanding (Mary could make
a shrewd guess how) and were now to be man and wife. An even more
urgent reason why Richard should appear at the wedding was, it
would greatly improve Purdy's social standing, if it became known
that Dr. Mahony had travelled all the way from Melbourne to be
present. And Purdy, poor fellow, could well do with such a lift.
Even she, Mary, who had known him in so many a tight fit, had felt
shocked at his condition after his last adventure.</p>

<p>Thus she reflected as she watched the landscape slip past:
yellowish-grey flats, or stone-strewn paddocks tufted with clumps
of brown grass, all of which she had seen too often before to pay
much heed to them. Still she never wanted to read in a train. So
unlike Richard, whose idea of a journey was to bury himself in a
book from start to finish. At the present moment he was deep in a
pamphlet entitled: "The Unity, Duality or Trinity of the
Godhead?"&mdash;Tch, what questions he did vex his head with!...he
must always be trying to settle the universe. If only he would
sometimes give his poor brains a rest.</p>

<p>He was looking pale and washed out, too, not by any means his
best...for meeting all the old friends. But what could you expect
if he <i>would</i> spend his life cooped up indoors?&mdash;never
leaving the house except to attend long, hot seances; or sittings
with Gracey. And these had rather fallen off of late. Mary didn't
know why, and he said nothing; but Lizzie as usual was prolific in
hints. Poor old Richard! She did hope things would go smoothly for
him during the next three days. She would feel relieved when they
were over.</p>

<p>But no sooner did they reach Ballarat than the trouble began. On
the platform stood Tilly, wreathed in smiles, open-armed in
welcome, but gone, alas, was the decent and becoming black to
which, as "old Mrs. Ocock," she had been faithful for so long. In
its stead...well, there was no mincing the fact: she looked fit for
<i>Punch!</i> Her dress, of a loud, bottle-green satin, was in the
very latest mode, worn entirely without crinoline, so that her full
form was outlined in unspeakable fashion; her big capable hands
were squeezed into lemon-coloured kid gloves, tight to bursting,
and on her head perched a monstrous white hat, turned up at the
side and richly feathered.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear!"</p>

<p>For Mary knew very well that neither the genuine sincerity of
Tilly's greeting, nor her multitudinous arrangements for their
comfort, would suffice to blot from Richard's mind the figure she
cut this day.</p>

<p>Climbing to the driver's seat of an open buggy, all her feathers
afloat, Tilly trotted a pair of cream ponies in great style up
Sturt Street. Of course everybody in Ballarat knew her, so it
didn't matter for herself what she looked like. It was Richard who
was to be pitied.</p>

<p>The next thing to provoke him was the arbitrary way in which she
disposed of his personal liberty. She had it all fixed and settled
that, directly supper was over, he should go back to town, to
"Moberley's Hotel," and there spend the evening with the
bridegroom-elect.</p>

<p>"She wants them to be seen in public together," thought Mary as
she helped Richard on with his overcoat and muffled him up in a
comforter; for the air on this tableland struck cold, after
Melbourne's sea-level. "And for that, of course, there's no better
place than Moberley's Coffee Room."&mdash;Aloud she said
reprovingly: "Ssh! She'll hear you. You know, dear, you needn't
stop long." But Richard, chilly and tired from the railway journey,
looked as though he could cheerfully have consigned Tilly and her
nuptials to Hades.</p>

<p>"And now you and I can 'ave a real cosy evening, love, while the
lords of creation smoke and jaw about early days," said dear blind
old Tilly. Or perhaps she was not quite so blind as she seemed; and
just wanted to be rid of Richard and the atmosphere of glacial
politeness that went out from him. Anyhow off he set, with a very
bad grace, and the two women retired to Tilly's bedroom. Here a
great log fire burned on the whitewashed hearth; and Tilly kept the
poker in her hand with which to thump the logs, did the blaze
threaten to fail. This dyed the dimity-hangings of the fourposter;
made ruddy pools in the great mahogany wardrobe.</p>

<p>Said Tilly: "Well, here we are again, Poll, you and me, like so
often before...and the day after to-morrow's me wedding-day. 'Pon
my word it's hard to believe; and yet...I don't know, dearie, but
somehow it seems no time since us three bits of girls used to sit
over the fire and gas about all the grand things that was going to
happen to us. That's ages back, and yet, except that we're grown a
bit hulkier you and me, it might be only yesterday. I don't feel a
day older and that's the truth; which is odd when you come to think
of it...with pa and ma and Jinn and poor old Pa all gone, these
ever so many years! I say, <i>do</i> you remember, Poll, how Purd
used to ride down from Melbourne? And how, when 'e'd gone, I 'd
count the days off on me fingers till 'e'd come again?"</p>

<p>"I think you're a very lucky woman, Tilly, to get your heart's
wish like this. I do hope it will bring you every happiness."</p>

<p>"I think it will, Poll. I'm not going into it with my eyes shut,
or any of the flighty notions one has as a young girl&mdash;heaven
on earth and bunkum of that sort. But now, listen to me, dearie,
there's things I want to say to you. First of all, Mary, I've
fixed, once we're spliced, for Tom and Johnny to come back to this
house&mdash;which they never ought to 'ave left. I won't say it
'asn't taken a bit of managing. But my mind was quite made up. It's
gone to my heart, all these years, to see how badly those poor lads
were cared for. Enough to make poor old Pa turn in 'is grave."</p>

<p>But Mary had raised her eyebrows. For all its kindness, she
thought the plan a most unwise one. Just suppose Purdy should turn
nasty! In subtle connection the question sprang to her lips: "What
about the money side of it&mdash;settlements, and all that?"</p>

<p>Tilly nodded. "Ah! I can see what you're thinking,
love&mdash;writing me down a lovesick old fool who's going to let
Pa's good money be made ducks and drakes of. It's true, most of
what I've got <i>will</i> pass to Purd, to do as 'e likes with. But
somehow I don't believe 'e'll be a waster. A man who's gone short
as long as him...However, just in case, Poll"&mdash;here Tilly sank
her voice to a mysterious hiss&mdash;"the fact is, love, I've got a
reserve fund of my own, a nest-egg so to speak, which I don't mean
to let on one word about...no, not to anybody. Except you. I've
laid something by, my dear, in the last few years, made a bit at
the races; sold out of <i>Blazing Diamonds</i> in the nick of time;
and the long and the short of it is, Mary, I've between seven and
eight thousand by me at this very minute. What's more, I intend to
keep it; just let it lie, have it to draw on, in case of trouble.
One never knows. I've got a small tin box, my dear, and out in the
dairy, going down the ladder into the cellar, a flag's come loose,
which just leaves room for it. There's no chance there of fire, or
thieves either&mdash;no one but myself even sets foot in the place.
And if anything happens to me, it's there you'll find it. The boys
are to have it, if I go first. For as you can see, love, with no
blood-tie between them and me, there wouldn't be much call on Purd,
would there, to support 'em after my death?"</p>

<p>Indeed that was true; nor could Purdy be blamed, if he failed to
recognise the obligation. It said a good deal for him that he was
willing to accept, as inmates of his house, these two middle-aged
men, one of whom was a confirmed drunkard with lucid intervals, the
other little more than an overgrown child. As for Tilly's plan of
keeping a large sum of money on the premises, risky though it
seemed, Mary faltered in her criticism of it. For she knew too well
the advantage of a private purse into which you could dip at will.
Instead of having to run to your husband with all the little extra
expenses that <i>would</i> crop up, spare as you might. These were
never kindly greeted. Richard, too, had been the most generous of
husbands, and she a fairly good manager. Tilly on the other hand
was lavish and lordly with money, Purdy still a dark horse in
respect of it.</p>

<p>Another thing, as long as Purdy and Mr. Henry knew nothing,
Tilly could neither be wheedled out of her savings nor bullied into
reinvesting them.</p>

<p>When at the end of an hour the two women kissed good-night,
Tilly uttered her usual request: "Now mind, not a word to the
doctor!"</p>

<p>Oh dear no! (<i>How</i> Richard would have jeered!) Besides,
when he got home some half-hour later, he was so full of a new
grudge against Tilly that every word had to be weighed, for fear of
fanning the flames. It seemed that on reaching Moberley's, he had
found Purdy the centre of a rowdy party, whose noise and laughter
could be heard even before he entered the hotel. More: his
appearance was totally unexpected. Purdy looked as if he couldn't
believe his eyes; ejaculated: "What, Dick? You here already?" and
then turned back to his companions&mdash;the motley collection of
commercial travellers and bar-haunters he had gathered round him.
Ten minutes of this were enough for Mahony; he slipped unobserved
from the room. Recognising, however, that the appointment had been
a ruse on Tilly's part to get rid of him, he did not come back to
the house, but took a long walk round the lake in the dark. There,
at least, he could be sure of not meeting any one he knew.</p>

<p>He seemed to have this idea of dodging familiar faces on the
brain. Did ever any one hear the like?...on his return, for the
first time, to the place where he had spent a third of his
life...where he had been so well known and sought after. But really
<i>just</i> how odd Richard had become, Mary did not grasp till
now. And before the following day was out, she was heartily sorry
she had not left him at home. One of his worst bad nights did not
help to mend matters. He vowed he had not missed the striking of a
single hour; but had tossed and turned on a too hard bed, in a too
light room, listening to the strange noises of a strange house, and
wakened for good and all long before dawn, by the crowing of "a
thousand infernal roosters." Before any one else stirred he was up
and out, on a long tramp bushwards.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done with him. Summoned to the
drawing-room to greet Amelia Grindle and Agnes Ocock, who drove
over immediately after breakfast "for a glimpse of our darling
Mary," he was so stiff and found so little to say that poor Amelia,
timid and fluttery as ever, hardly dared to raise her eyes from her
boots. Thereafter Mary left him in peace on the back verandah, and
sought to waylay Tilly, whose main idea of hospitality&mdash;poor
old Tilly!&mdash;was continually to be bothering him with something
to eat.</p>

<p>The person who did not look near was Purdy; and this was an
additional source of offence. The least he could have done, said
Richard, was to ride out and make up for his offensive behaviour of
the night before. Didn't the fellow grasp that he, Mahony, had come
to Ballarat solely with the object of doing him a good turn?
Privately Mary thought it very unlikely that Purdy, or Tilly
either, saw Richard's presence in this light. Aloud she observed
that he must know it would not be considered proper for the
bridegroom to hang about the house, the day before the wedding. But
Richard said: propriety be hanged!</p>

<p>He also flouted her suggestion that he should himself pay some
visits&mdash;look up the Archdeacon, or Chinnery of the National,
or those colleagues on hospital or asylum with whom he had once
been intimate.</p>

<p>"Not I! If they want to see me, let <i>them</i> make the
overture."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. Of course they'd like to see you again."</p>

<p>"I know better."</p>

<p>"Then why, if you're so sure of it, feel hurt because they don't
come? For that's what you are," said Mary bluntly. She wore a large
cooking-apron over her silk gown, and looked tired but content. She
had helped to set the wedding-breakfast on long trestle-tables
running the length of the hall; had helped to pack and strap the
bride's trunks for the journey to Sydney; had baked some of her
famous cakes, and laid the foundation for the more elaborate cream
dishes that were to be whipped up the first thing next morning.</p>

<p>She went on: "Personally, I don't see how you can expect people
to run after you, when you've never troubled to keep up with
them...written a line or sent a message." And just because she
herself thought <i>some</i> of Richard's old friends might have
done him the compliment of calling, Mary spoke very warmly. Adding:
"Well, at least you'll take a stroll round the old place now you're
here, and see how it's grown."</p>

<p>"Indeed and I'll do nothing of the sort!...now don't start
badgering me, Mary. Why on earth should I go to the trouble of
soldering old links, for the sake of a single day? I'll never be
here again."</p>

<p>"Tch, tch!" said Mary. "With you it's always yourself...nothing
but I, I, I!"</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word!...I like that. After me dragging all this
way...not to speak of being perched up to-morrow before a churchful
of people, for them to stare at!"</p>

<p>At this Mary laughed aloud. "Oh, Richard! As if they would ever
think of looking at anybody but the bride!...or bridegroom."</p>

<p>But Richard, it seemed, suffered from an intense nervous
conviction that he would be a target for all eyes.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Something before three o'clock the following afternoon, Mary
stood on the front verandah, which was white and scrunchy with
flowers and rice, and watched him, carpet-bag in hand, make a dash
for gate, trap, and the train that was to carry him back to town.
Indoors the guests still lingered: you could hear a buzz of talk,
the clink of glasses, the rustle of silk; and she herself was not
leaving till next day, having promised Tilly first to see the house
restored to order. But nothing would persuade Richard to stop a
moment longer than was necessary. He fled.</p>

<p>Tossing hat and bag on the cushions of the railway carriage,
Mahony fell into a seat and wiped his forehead. Doors slammed; a
bell rang; they were off. Well, <i>that</i> was over, thank
God!...and never, no, never! would he let himself be trapped into
this kind of thing again. To begin with, he had been inveigled here
on false pretences. It no doubt buttered Tilly's vanity to see his
name topping the list of her wedding-guests. But as far as all else
was concerned, he might have stayed comfortably at home. Purdy had
not cared a threepenny-bit one way or the other. As for it ever
dawning on the fellow that he was being given a leg-up&mdash;a
social safe-conduct, so to speak&mdash;all such rubbish originated
in Mary's confounded habit of reading her own ideas into other
people. At his expense.</p>

<p>But while he could dismiss Tilly and her folly with a smile,
Purdy's bovine indifference roused a cold resentment in him.
Consciously he had washed his hands of the connection long since.
And yet it seemed as if a part of him still looked for
gratitude&mdash;or at least a show of gratitude&mdash;did he exert
himself on Purdy's behalf. Which was absurd.&mdash;And anyhow Purdy
had never been famous for delicacy of feeling&mdash;a graceless,
thankless beggar from the start. In his heyday, a certain debonair
blitheness had cloaked his shortcomings. Now, time having robbed
him of every charm, he stood revealed in all his crudity: obese,
loose-mouthed, with an eye grown shifty from overreaching his
fellow-men: <i>how</i> he plumed himself on his skill as a Jeremy
Diddler! Oh, this insufferable exaggeration!&mdash;this eternal
bragging...even while they were waiting in church for the arrival
of the bride, he had been unable to refrain. Mary said: "Do have
patience. Mark my words, Tilly will knock him into shape." But
Mahony doubted it. Once a boaster, always a boaster!&mdash;besides,
the fair fat Tilly was too far gone in love to wish to chip and
change her chosen. Her face had been oily with bliss as she stood
with her groom before the altar, he in a check the squares of which
could have been counted from across the road, draped in a
watch-chain on which he might have hanged himself; she, puce-clad,
in a magenta bonnet topped with roses the size of peonies, which
sat crooked over one ear. (Mary, cool and pale in silver grey,
looked as though sprung from a different branch of the human
race.)</p>

<p>What a farce the whole thing had been!...from beginning to end.
The congratulations he had had to smirk a response to on "his
friend's" marriage, "his friend's" good fortune. Then old Long's
flowery periods, which would have well befitted a dewy damsel of
eighteen, but bordered on the ludicrous when applied to Tilly, who
would never see forty again, and had been through all this before.
Henry Ocock "giving away" his mature stepmother and her money-bags,
his father's money-bags, those bags that should by rights have
descended to <i>his</i> son: in spite of his sleek suavity, it was
not hard to imagine the wrath that burned behind Henry's chalky
face and boot-button eyes. He was ageing, was Henry; white hairs
showed in his jetty beard and the creasing of his lids made him
look foxier than ever. But so it was with all of them. Those he had
left young were now middle-aged the middle-aged had grown old. Like
Henry's, their faces had not improved in the process. Time seemed
to show up the vacancy that had once been overlaid by rounded
cheeks and a smooth forehead. Or else the ugly traits in a nature,
ousting the good, had been bitten in as by an etcher's acid. He
wondered what secrets his own phiz held, for those who had eyes to
see. The failures and defeats his prime had been spent in
enduring&mdash;had each left its special mark, in the shape of
hollow, or droop, or wrinkle? Oh, his return to this hated place
called up bitter memories from their graves: raised one obscene
ghost after another, for his haunting. Here, he was to have
garnered the miraculous fortune that would lift him for ever out of
the mud of poverty; here had dreamt the marriage that was to be
like no other on earth; here turned back, with a big heart, to the
profession that should ensure him ease and renown&mdash;even the
cutting himself loose, when everything else had miscarried, was to
have heralded the millennium.&mdash;No! one's past simply did not
bear thinking about. Looking back was wormwood and a wound. It
meant remembering all the chances you had not taken; the gaudy
soap-bubble schemes that had puffed out at a breath; meant an
inward writhing at the toll of the years flown by, empty of
achievement&mdash;at the way in which you had let him get the
better of you. Time, which led down and down, with a descent ever
steeper and more rapid, till it landed you...in who knew what
Avernus?&mdash;Nervously Mahony unclasped his bag and rummaged a
book from its depths. To lose himself in another's thoughts was the
one anodyne left him.</p>

<p>The train was racing now. They had passed Navigator, white and
sweet with lucerne; and the discomforts and absurdities of the past
forty-eight hours were well behind him.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Cuffy, playing that evening on the front verandah, was surprised
by the sudden advent of his father, who caught him up, tossed and
soundly kissed him with a: "And how is my little man? How is my
darling?" But at three years old even a short absence digs a
breach. Cuffy had had time to grow shy. He coloured, hung his head,
looked sideways along the floor; and as soon as he was released
pattered off to Nannan and the nursery.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-5" id="ch-2-3-5"></a>Chapter V</h3>

<p>The old mahogany fourposter with the red rep hangings had been
brought out from among the lumber, and set up afresh in John's
study. And soon after his interview with Mahony John shifted his
quarters to this room, on the pretence of sleeping poorly and
disturbing his wife. Lizzie raised fierce objections to the change.
It took Mary to mollify her, and to insist that she must now place
her own health and comfort above everything. Save in this one
point, it was true, Lizzie needed small persuasion. The household
danced to her whims.</p>

<p>Emmy's room was only a trifle nearer the study than the other
bedrooms; but in everything that touched her father the girl's
senses were preternaturally acute. And so it happened that she
started out of her first sleep, wakened she did not know by what,
but conscious, even as she opened her eyes, of sounds coming from
her father's room&mdash;the strange, heart-rending sounds of a man
crying. Sitting up in bed, her hands pressed to her breast, Emmy
listened till she could bear it no longer: stealthily unlatching
the door, she crept down the passage to the study. And there, on
this and many another night, she lay crouched on the mat, her heart
bursting with love and pity; while John, believing himself alone
with his Maker, railed and rebelled, in blind anguish, against his
fate. Yes, Emmy knew before any one else that some disaster had
come upon her father. And in the riot of emotion the knowledge
stirred in her, there was one drop of sweetness: she alone shared
his secret.</p>

<p>The feeling of intimacy this engendered did much to help her
over the days of suspense that followed; when she waited from hour
to hour for the unknown blow to fall. She confided in no
one&mdash;not even Aunt Mary. Her father himself she dared not
approach. Papa was so stern with her. Once, after a night when she
really thought her heart would break, she ventured a timid: "Papa,
if there is anything...I mean, Papa...if I could..." But he stared
so angrily at her that she turned and ran from the room, for fear
of bursting out crying&mdash;as much at the sound of her own words
and the feeling of self-pity they roused in her, as at his cold
repulse. She did not see the look he threw after her as she went.
"Her mother's daughter," was his muttered comment; and long past
days rose before him, when there had been one at his side from whom
nothing was hid. Tatting and crocheting, crocheting and tatting,
Emmy gave her imagination free play. A failure in business, even
bankruptcy was the solution she favoured&mdash;being still too
young to face of herself the destructive thought of death. And did
this happen, and Papa lose all his money, then would come
<i>her</i> chance. He would learn that he had one faithful soul at
his side, one shoulder to lean on. Together they would go away, he
and she, right into the bush if necessary, and start life afresh.
But again there were moments when she indulged an even dearer hope:
at last, perhaps, Papa was beginning to see what a dreadful mistake
his marriage had been.</p>

<p>For Emmy hated her stepmother; hated her, and sat in judgment on
her, with the harshness of the young creature who has been wounded
in her tenderest susceptibilities. Thus, though for the most part
she rejoiced to know Lizzie among the uninitiated, she could also
burn with a furious, unreasoning anger against her for living on,
so blindly, so selfishly, without noticing that something was
amiss. At sight of the big woman lying stretched on her <i>chaise
longue</i>, idly fanning herself, book and vinaigrette at her
elbow; or Papa bathing her temples for her with lavender-water, or
running errands for her like a servant&mdash;at things like these
Emmy clenched her fist, and averted her tell-tale eyes. She hated,
too, Lizzie's vigorous, exaggerated manner of speaking; hated the
full red lips that went in and out and up and down when she talked;
her affected languor...her unwieldy figure...the baby that was on
the way.</p>

<p>But with the crash came also the chance of revenge. Then it was
Emmy's turn; and she could say in all good faith: "Oh, <i>don't</i>
let her&mdash;don't let...Mamma go in to him, Aunt Mary! She
worries him so." As always, there was just the suspicion of a
pause&mdash;a kind of intake of the breath&mdash;before she got the
"Mamma" out; a name here bestowed for the third time, and only
after a severe inward struggle, because <i>he</i> had wished
it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile John's serene and dignified existence had shattered to
its foundations; carrying with it, in its fall, the peace and
security of those lesser lives that depended on it. For close on
six months, he had kept his own counsel. With his once full lips
pinched thin in his old, greying face, he went doggedly to and from
the warehouse in Flinders Lane, as he had done every day for
five-and-twenty years: driving off at nine of a morning, and
returning as the clock struck six to escort Lizzie to any
entertainment she still cared to patronise: and this, though his
skin had gone the colour of dry clay or a dingy plaster, and he was
so wasted that his clothes seemed to flap scarecrow-like on his
bones. Mary's heart bled for him; and even Richard was moved to
remark that what John must be suffering, both mentally and
physically, God alone knew. But they could only pity in silence;
open compassion was not to be thought of: after the one terrible
night Mary had spent with John, the subject of his illness was
taboo, even to her. Alone, sheathed in his impenetrable reserve, he
prepared for his departure; bade farewell, behind locked doors, to
a life of surpassing interest, now cut short in mid-career. In
politics, his place would not be hard to fill. But of the great
business he had built up he was still the mainspring; and, in a
last spurt of his stiff pride, he laboured to leave all that
concerned it in perfect order.&mdash;And yet, watching him with her
heart in her eyes, Mary sometimes wondered...wondered whether the
unquenchable optimism that had made him the man he was had even yet
wholly deserted him. He had had so little experience of illness,
and was, she knew, still running privily from doctor to specialist;
giving even quacks and their remedies a trial. Did he nurse a hope
that medical opinion, right in ninety-nine cases, might prove wrong
in his, and he have the hundredth chance? One thing at least she
knew: he intended, if humanly possible, to bear up till the child
was born and Lizzie better able to withstand the blow.</p>

<p>But this was not to be. The morning came when, in place of
rising and tapping at his wife's door, solicitously to inquire how
she had passed the night, John, beaten at last, lay prostrate in
his bed...from which he never rose again.</p>

<p>A scene of the utmost confusion followed. Mary, summoned just as
she was sitting down to breakfast, found Lizzie in hysterics, John
writhing in an agony he could no longer conceal. The scared
servants scuttled aimlessly to and fro; the children, but half
dressed, cried in a corner of the nursery. Emmy alone had her wits
about her&mdash;though she, too, shook as with the ague.</p>

<p>Meeting Mary at the front door, she held out two clasped hands
imploringly. "Oh...what is it? Aunt Mary! what is the matter with
Papa?"</p>

<p>"Emmy...your poor, dear father&mdash;my darling, I look to you
to be brave and help me&mdash;he will need all our help now."</p>

<p>Long prepared for some such emergency, Mary took control.
Dispatching the groom at a gallop for the doctor, she mixed a
soothing-draught for Lizzie ("See to her first," was John's
whispered request) and gave John the strongest opiate she dared.
The children were put in the carriage, and sent to "Ultima Thule."
Then, as Richard had directed, Mary cleared the sickroom of
superfluous furniture; while Emmy bore a note to Miss
Julia&mdash;Mary's sole confidante. And faithful to a promise, Miss
Julia was back with Emmy inside an hour. Without her aid she at
once saw to Lizzie, and brought the servants to their
senses&mdash;without this sane, calm presence, Mary did not know
how she would have managed, John from the start obstinately
refusing to let her out of his sight. Or for that matter without
Emmy either...Emmy was her right hand. Nimble, yet light-footed as
a cat; tireless; brave; Emmy now proved her mettle. Nothing was
beneath her: she performed the most menial duties of the sickroom
with a kind of fiery, inner gratitude. And, these done, would sit
still as a mouse, a scrap of needlework in her hand, just waiting
for the chance of springing up afresh. Her young face grew thin and
peaked, and the life went out of her step; but she never
complained, or sought to obtrude her own feelings. Only one person
knew what she was suffering. It was on Auntie Julia's neck that she
had had her single breakdown, and wept out her youthful passion of
love and despair.</p>

<p>"What shall I do! Oh, what <i>shall</i> I do?"</p>

<p>And Auntie Julia, knowing everything, understanding everything,
wisely let her cry and cry till she could cry no more. "There,
there, my little one! There, there!" But after this Emmy did not
again give way. Indeed, thought Mary, there was something in her of
John's own harsh self-mastery: a trait that sat oddly on her soft
and lovely girlhood.</p>

<p>Lizzie was the sorest trial. But then, poor thing, was it to be
wondered at in her condition, and after the shock John had given
her? For when, that first morning he failed to present himself at
her bedside, Lizzie passed in a twinkling from a mood of pettish
surprise to one of extreme ungraciousness. The housemaid was
peremptorily bidden to go knock at the master's door and ask the
reason of his negligence. The girl's confused stammerings throwing
no light on this, Emmy was loudly rung for. "Pray, my love, be so
good as to find out if your Papeh, who has evidently
<i>forgotten</i> to wish me a good-morning, does not intend going
to town to-day!" And when Emmy, sick and trembling, yet with a kind
of horrific satisfaction, returned bearing John's brutal reply:
"No, not to-day, nor ever again!" Lizzie, now thoroughly roused,
threw on a wrapper and swept down the passage to her husband's
room.</p>

<p>On discovering the true state of things she dropped to the floor
in a swoon. Restored to consciousness and got back to bed, she fell
to screaming in hysterical abandonment&mdash;on his arrival the
doctor had more to do for her than for John, and pulled a long
face. And even when the danger of a premature confinement was over,
and the worst of the hysteria got under, she would lie and sob and
cry, breaking out, to whoever would listen, in wild
accusations.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, love! When I think <i>how</i> I have been
deceived!...the trick that has been played on me...me who ought to
have known before any one else. John and his secrecy!&mdash;he has
made a fool of me, even in the eyes of the servants."</p>

<p>"My poor, dear Lizzie! Do believe me, he only wanted to spare
you...as long as he could. Consider him now, and his sufferings,
and don't make it harder for him than you can help. Think, too, of
your baby."</p>

<p>But she might as well have talked to a post: Lizzie continued
stormily to weep and to rail. The two older women bore patiently
with her, even coming to consider it a good thing that she was thus
able to vent her emotion. It remained for Emmy, Emmy with the hard
and unyoung look her face assumed when she spoke of her stepmother,
to make the bitter comment: "She's not really <i>sorry</i> for
Papa&mdash;she's <i>savage</i>, Aunt Mary, that's what she
is!"&mdash;a point of view which Mary herself was so rigidly
suppressing that it received but scant quarter. "Emmy, Emmy! You
must <i>not</i> say such things of your Mamma." But Richard
declared the girl had hit the nail on the head. It was herself and
herself alone Lizzie grieved for.</p>

<p>"And is it so unnatural? Has Fate not played her a shabby trick?
She took John, as we all know, because he was by far the best catch
that had ever come her way. Now, after a few brief years of glory,
and when her main ambition was about to materialise, the Lady
Turnham-to-be sees herself doomed to a widow's dreary existence:
all weepers and seclusion: with, for sole diversion, the care of an
unwanted infant. Not to speak of the posse of stepdaughters she has
loaded herself up with."</p>

<p>"It <i>does</i> sound harsh...the way you put it," said Mary,
and re-tied her bonnet-strings; she had run home one evening for a
peep at her children.</p>

<p>However, if he and Emmy were right about Lizzie and her
feelings, then what a blessing it was that John, in his illness,
made no demands on her, asking neither for nor after her. With his
one request on the morning of his collapse, that she should receive
first attention, all thought for her seemed exhausted: just as, in
the brutal answer he returned her by Emmy, had evaporated his love
and care. From the sound of her pitiless crying he turned with
repugnance away. Did she enter his room, with a swish of the
skirts, either forgetting to lower her voice or hissing in a
melodramatic whisper, he was restless till she withdrew. Except for
Mary&mdash;and he fretted like a child if Mary were long
absent&mdash;John asked only to be alone.</p>

<p>On taking to his bed he had severed, at one stroke, every link
with the outside world: and soon he was to lie drug-sodden and
mercifully indifferent even to the small world of his sickroom. But
before this happened he expressed one wish&mdash;or rather gave a
last order. The nature of his illness was not to be made known
beyond the family circle.</p>

<p>"Trying to keep his Chinese Wall up to the end," said Mahony.
"His death&mdash;like his life&mdash;is to be nobody's business but
his own. Well, well...as a man lives so he shall die!"</p>

<p>But Mary was much perturbed. A dying man's whim&mdash;and as
such, of course, it had to be respected. But what <i>could</i> it
hurt now whether people knew what was the matter with him or not?
Concealing the truth meant all sorts of awkward complications. But
Emmy, overhearing this, flushed sensitively and looked distressed.
"Oh, Aunt Mary, don't you <i>see</i>? Papa is...is <i>ashamed</i>
of having a cancer."</p>

<p>Ashamed?...ashamed of an illness?...Mary had never heard of such
a thing. But Richard, struck afresh by Emmy's acumen, declared:
"That's it! The girl is right. You call it a sick man's fancy, I
the exaggerated reserve of a lifetime, but Emmy knows better, sees
deeper than any of us." And added a moment later: "It strikes me,
my dear, that if instead of hankering after that impossible
scapegrace of a son, just because he <i>was</i> a son, your brother
had had a little more eye for the quick wits and understanding of
his daughter, he might have been a happier man."</p>

<p>News of the serious illness of the Honourable John Millibank
Turnham, M.L.C., brought an endless string of callers and inquirers
to the door: the muffled knocker thudded unceasingly. People came
in their carriages, on horseback, on foot; and included not merely
John's distracted partners, and his colleagues on the Legislative
Council, but many a lesser man and casual acquaintance&mdash;Mary
herself marvelled to see how widely known and respected John had
been. And those who could not come in person wrote letters of
condolence, sent gifts of luscious fruit and choice flowers and
out-of-season delicacies&mdash;anything in short of which kindly
people could think, to prove their sympathy. It was one person's
while to receive the visitors, answer the letters, acknowledge the
gifts. Fortunately this very person was at hand in the shape of
Zara. Zara's elegant manners and her ease in expressing herself on
paper were exactly what was wanted.</p>

<p>She and Hempel were staying in lodgings at Fitzroy, prior to
setting out on the forlorn hope of a sea voyage. For, after
numerous breakdowns, poor Hempel&mdash;he looked as if the first
puff of wind would blow him overboard; Richard called him: "The
next candidate for the Resurrection!"&mdash;had been obliged
definitely to abandon his pastorate. In the meantime he was resting
in bed from the fatigues of the train journey, before undertaking
the fresh fatigues to which Zara, in her wilful blindness,
condemned him.</p>

<p>At John's, Zara received in the dining-room among horsehair and
mahogany, as better befitting the occasion than the gilt and satin
of the drawing-room. Lugubriously clad, she spoke with the pious
and resigned air of one about to become a mourner. "My poor
brother," "Our great grief," "God's will be done!" But of an
evening when the rush was over, she carried to Lizzie a list of
names and gifts and a sheaf of letters.</p>

<p>Her sibilant tones were audible through the half-closed door.
"Yes, Judge O'Connor&mdash;yes, yes, my dear, himself in
person!...with his own and his lady's compliments...desires to be
kept informed of our dear John's progress."</p>

<p>And Lizzie's rich, fruity tones: "Major Grenville, did you
say?...on behalf of his Excellency? Very gratifying...very
gratifying indeed!"</p>

<p>Mary was never one to jib at trifles. But as often as Emmy heard
them at it, she clenched her fist and ground her teeth. <i>How</i>
she hated them!...hated them. To be able to care who called and who
didn't call, when Papa lay dying! In her passionate young egoism
she demanded that there should be no room in any mind but for this
single thought.</p>

<p>But, as week added itself to week, and John still lay prostrate,
and since, too, the most heartfelt inquiries evoked none but the
stereotyped response: "No improvement," the press of sympathisers
visibly declined. People ceased to call daily; came but once a
week; then at still wider intervals. And at length even the
hardiest dropped off, and a great stillness settled round the dying
man. John was forgotten; was reckoned to the dead before he was
actually of them. Only once more on earth would he, for a brief
hour, play a leading part.</p>

<p>The flawless constitution that had been so great an asset to him
in life stood him now in ill stead. His dying was arduous and
protracted. Behind the red rep hangings there went on one of those
bitter struggles with death that wring from even the least
sensitive an amazed: "Wherefore? To what end?" Cried Mahony,
watching John's fruitless efforts: "The day will come, I'm sure of
it, when we shall agree to the incurable sufferer being put
painlessly away. We need a lethal chamber, and not for dumb brutes
alone." At which Mary looked apprehensive, and wished he wouldn't.
A good job he was no longer in practice. Or what <i>would</i> his
patients have thought?</p>

<p>"Ah, thank God, the muzzle of medical etiquette is off my
jowl!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thought his wife, he was in his element, all
tenderness and consideration for John&mdash;he went to endless
trouble in procuring for him the newest make of
water-bed&mdash;which was just what one would expect of Richard.
Nor would he have him teased about religious questions or his
approaching end. On the other hand, had John shown the least desire
for religious consolation, Richard would have been the person to
see that he got it.</p>

<p>But this John did not. At those rare moments when he was awake
to his surroundings and tolerably free from pain, he lay exhausted
and inert, his eyes closed, and with little to distinguish him from
one already dead. What his innermost thoughts were, what his hopes
and fears of a hereafter, remained his own secret. The single wish
that crossed his lips seemed to point to his mind still occupying
itself with earthly things.</p>

<p>Mary, sewing beside the bed, looked up one day to find his
sunken eyes open and fastened on her.</p>

<p>She rose and leaned over him. "What is it, John? Do you want
anything?"</p>

<p>He signified yes with his lids, sparing himself any superfluous
word for fear of rousing up his enemy. Then, in a thick, raucous
whisper: "I should like...to see...the boy. Yours."</p>

<p>Thus it came about&mdash;greatly against the wish of Mahony, who
held that illness and suffering were evil sights for childish
eyes&mdash;that Cuffy was one day lifted into the carriage beside
Nannan, where he sat his little legs a-dangle, clad in his best
velvet tunic and with his Scotch cap on his head. He looked pale
and solemn. Nannan and Eliza had made such funny faces at each
other, and had whispered and whispered. And while she was dressing
him Nannan had talked about nothing but how good and quiet he must
be, and what would happen to him if he wasn't. In consequence,
directly he was set down from the carriage Cuffy started walking on
the tips of his toes; and on tiptoe, holding fast to his nurse's
hand, crept laboriously up the gravel path to the house.</p>

<p>At the front door stood Cousin Emmy, who kissed him and led him
in. Like Nannan she, too, said: "Now you must be a <i>very</i> good
boy, Cuffy, and not make the least noise." Cuffy's heart began to
thump with anxiety: he walked more gingerly than before. The house
felt like the nursery when the Dumplings were asleep. Emmy opened a
door into a room that was quite dark. It had also a very nasty
smell. Someone was snoring. Cuffy tried to pull back.</p>

<p>"Now, be good, Cuffy!"</p>

<p>Then he was at his mother's knee, mechanically holding out his
hands to have his little gloves peeled off. But his thoughts were
with his eyes &mdash;pinned to some one lying in a bed...a man with
a dark yellow face and a grey beard, who was asleep and
snoring&mdash;like Nannan did. Cuffy did not associate this
funny-looking person with his uncle; he just stood and stared
stupidly. Nevertheless, something very disturbing began to go round
inside him; and he swallowed hard.</p>

<p>Then two big black shiny eyes were awake and looking at him.
They looked and looked. Cuffy stood transfixed, his lips apart, his
breath coming unevenly, his own eyes round with a growing fear.</p>

<p>A yellow hand like a claw came over the bedclothes towards him,
and some one tried to speak; and only made a funny sound&mdash;and
tried again.</p>

<p>"...does you credit. But...at his age...John...a finer...child."
After which the eyes shut and the snoring began anew.</p>

<p>Then, though he had only just come, somebody said: "Kiss your
uncle good-bye, Cuffy."</p>

<p>This was too much. As he was lifted up Cuffy made protest,
wildly working his arms and legs. "No, no!"</p>

<p>But his lips had brushed something cold and clammy before, his
clothes all twisted round him, he was put back on the floor. And by
then the face on the bed had changed: the eyes were all wrinkles
now; the mouth like a big black hole. Somebody screamed. And now
people were scurrying about, and there came Aunt Lizzie running in
her dressing-gown, and she was naughty and cried, making the noise
he had been told not to. His own tears flowed; but true to his
promise he did not utter a sound.</p>

<p>Then some one took his hand and ran him out of the room to the
dining-room, where, his eyes wiped and his nose blown, Cousin Emmy
gave him a nectarine, which she peeled for him and cut up in
quarters, because it was "nicer so." He was also allowed to eat it
messily, and not scolded for letting the juice drip down his
tunic.</p>

<p>But at home again, he felt the need of blowing out his shrunken
self-esteem. It was a chance, too, of making himself big in the
eyes of his playfellow Josey, the youngest of his three cousins, a
long-legged girl of seven, who domineered over him, smacked him and
used his toys without asking. There she came along the verandah,
dragging his best horse and cart&mdash;with her nasty big black
eyes, and the hair that stuck straight out behind her round
comb.</p>

<p>Under seal of secrecy and with an odd sense of guilt, as if he
was doing something he ought not to, Cuffy confided to her his
discovery that big people could cry, too. "I seed your Mamma do
it."</p>

<p>But in place of being impressed Josey was very angry. Grabbing
the secretmonger's silky topknot, she shook him soundly. "That's a
storwy, Cuffy Mahony, and you're a howwid storwy-teller! Gwownup
people <i>never</i> cwy!" The fact that she spoke with a strong
lisp, while a baby like Cuffy would talk plainly, always rendered
Josey very emphatic. Moreover in the present case, she still burned
with shame at the disgraceful knowledge that not only Mamma could
cry, but Papa, too.</p>

<p>John died five days later at midnight.</p>

<p>The afternoon before, an odd thing happened. Mary and Emmy were
alone with him, he lying drugged and comatose, and Mary had been
fanning him, for it was very warm. Outside, beneath a
copper-coloured sky, a scorching north wind blew; the windows of
the room were shut against swirling clouds of dust. There was no
sound but John's laboured breathing, and, exhausted, Mary thought
she must have dropped into a doze. For when, warned by a kind of
instinct she started up, she saw that John's eyes were open: he was
gazing with a glassy stare at the foot-end of the bed. And as she
watched, an extraordinary change came over the shrunken, jaundiced
face. The eyes widened, the pin-hole pupils dilated; while the
poor, burst lips, on which were black sores that would not heal,
parted and drew back, disclosing the pallid flesh of the gums. John
was trying to smile.</p>

<p>A second later and the whole face was transfigured&mdash;lit by
an expression of rapturous joy. John even made an abortive effort
to raise himself&mdash;to hold out his arms. His breath came
sobbingly.</p>

<p>"Emma! Oh, <i>Emma!</i>...<i>Wife!</i>"</p>

<p>At first sound of her name, Emmy sprang from her seat behind the
curtains and threw herself on her knees at the bedside, close to
John's groping hand. "Papa!...yes, oh yes? Oh,
papa...<i>darling!</i>"</p>

<p>But John did not hear her. All the life left him was centred in
his eyes, which hung, dazed with wonder, on something visible to
them alone. Bending over the passionately weeping girl Mary
whispered: "Hush, hush, Emmy! Hush, my dear! He sees...he thinks he
sees your mother."</p>

<p>Mahony knew nothing of this occurrence till long after. By the
time he got there that evening, the death-agony had begun; and now
the one thought of those gathered round John's bed was to ease and
speed his passing. It was a murderous business. For the drug that
had thus far blunted the red-hot knives that hacked at his vitals
suddenly lost its power: injections now gave relief but for a few
moments on end; and, hour after hour, hour after hour, his
heart-breaking cry for help beat the air. "Morphia...morphia! For
God's sake, morphia!"</p>

<p>But the kindly, bearded physician who sat with a finger on
John's wrist remained impassive: the dose now necessary to reduce
the paroxysms would be more than the weakened heart could bear. And
so, livid, drenched in sweat, John fought his way to death through
tortures indescribable.</p>

<p>At the end of the afternoon those present felt that the limits
of human endurance had been reached. All eyes hung on the doctor's,
with the same mute appeal. The two men, Mahony and the other,
exchanged a rapid glance. Then, bending over the writhing anguished
thing that had once been John Turnham, the doctor addressed it by
name. "Mr. Turnham; you are in your right mind...and fully aware of
what you are saying. Do you take the injection necessary to relieve
you, of your own free will and at your own risk?"</p>

<p>"For the love of God!"</p>

<p>A moment's stir and business, and the blessed sedative was
running through the quivering veins, the last excruciating pangs
were throbbing with hammer-strokes to their end: upwards from the
feet crept the blissful numbness...rising higher...higher...higher.
And, as peace descended and the heavy lids fell to, Mahony stepped
forward, and taking one of the dying hands in his said in a loud,
clear voice: "Have no fear of death, John!"</p>

<p>Already floating out on the great river, John yet heard these
words and was arrested by them. Slowly the lids rolled back once
more, and for the fraction of a second the broken eyes met
Mahony's. In this, their last, living look, not a trace was left of
the man who had been. They were now those of one who was about to
be&mdash;fined and refined; rich in an experience that transcended
all mortal happenings; wise with an ageless wisdom. And as they
closed for ever to this world, there came an answer to Mahony's
words in ever so faint a flattening of the lips, an almost
imperceptible intake at the corners of the mouth, which, on the
sleeping face, had the effect of a smile: that lurking smile,
remote with peace, and yet touched with the lightest suspicion of
amused wonder, that sometimes makes the faces of the dead so good
to see.</p>

<p>John did not wake again. Towards midnight his breathing grew
more stertorous, the intervals between the breaths longer. And at
last the moment came when the watchers waited for the next...and
waited...in vain.</p>

<p>All was over; the poor weeping, shattered women were led from
the room. Mary, despite her grief, kept her presence of mind, and
Miss Julia with her. But Lizzie was convulsed; and poor little
Emmy, her long service ended, broke down utterly and had to be
carried to bed, and chafed, and dosed with restoratives. Zara was
bidden see to the children, John's three, who had been brought over
during the afternoon in case their father should ask for them:
forgotten, hungry, tired, they had cried themselves to sleep, and
now lay huddled in a tear-stained group on the dining-room sofa.
Mahony and the doctor busied themselves for yet a while in the
death-chamber; after which, decently composed and arranged, John
formed no more than a sheet-draped rising on the bed's smooth
plain. Mahony locked the door behind him and took the key. The
dogcart had come round, and Jerry, who was to drive back to town
with the doctor, stood, his collar turned up, all of a fidget to
get home to Fanny and his children. Mahony went out with them and,
having watched them drive off, paused to breathe the night air,
which was fresh and welcome after the fetid odours of the sickroom.
And standing there under the stars he sent, like an arrow of
farewell, a parting thought to the soul that might even now be
winging its way to freedom, and to whom soon all mysteries would be
plain. John had made a brave end. There had been no whining for
pity or pardon: on his own responsibility he had lived, and he died
by the same rule&mdash;the good Turnham blood had come out in him
to the last. And as he re-entered the house, where, by now, the
last exhausted watcher was sinking into unconsciousness, Mahony
murmured half-aloud to himself: "Well done, John...well done!"</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-6" id="ch-2-3-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>Some six months later the Mahonys set out on their second voyage
to England. They sailed by the clipper-ship <i>Atrata</i> and
travelled in style, accompanied by a maid to attend to Mary and
both nurses.&mdash;And "Ultima Thule" passed into other hands.</p>

<p>It had proved easier to persuade Mary to the break than Mahony
had dared to hope. John's illness and death paved the way. For, by
the time her long vigil at his bedside was over, and Lizzie seen
safely through a difficult confinement, Mary's own health was
beginning to suffer. A series of obstinate coughs and colds plagued
her; and a thorough change of air was advisable. A change of scene,
too. Though Mary was not given to moping and, at the time, had
thankfully accepted John's release, yet when it came to taking up
her ordinary life again the full sense of her loss came home to
her. And not to her alone but to every one. John's had been such a
vigorous personality. Its withdrawal left a gap nothing could
fill.</p>

<p>None the less, the sacrifice she was now called on to make was a
bitter one, and cost her much heartburning: when she first grasped
the <i>kind</i> of change Richard was tentatively proposing, she
burst into heated exclamation. What, break up their home
again?...their lovely home? Leave all the things they had collected
round them? Leave intimates and friends and their assured
position?...to go off no one knew where...and where nobody knew
them? Oh, he couldn't mean it!&mdash;And what about the
children?...still mere babies&mdash;"For though you talked till you
were black in the face, Richard, you would never get me to leave
them behind!"&mdash;and the drawbacks of ship-life for them at
their tender age?...the upset in their habits...not to speak of
having to watch them grow spoilt and fractious: winding up with her
dread of the sea, his antipathy to England and English life.</p>

<p>But Mahony, though he spoke soothingly, stuck to his guns. It
was only to be a visit this time, he urged. It could hardly hurt
the house to be let for a year or so. A good tenant would take good
care of it; and it would be there, just as it stood, for them to
come back to. Then both nurses would go with them; and as for the
darlings being too young for a voyage, that was the sheerest
nonsense: on the contrary, it would do them a world of good;
perhaps even turn Cuffy into a sturdy boy. The same could be said
for her own ailments: there was nothing like the briny for laying
coughs and colds; while the best cabin in the ship would go far
towards lessening the horrors of sea-sickness. As for England, they
would not know it for the same country, travelling as they did
to-day. Plenty of money, introductions to good people, going
everywhere, seeing everything; and ending up, if she felt disposed,
with a jaunt to the Paris Exhibition and a tour of the Continent.
"It isn't every wife, my dear, has such an offer made her."</p>

<p>But his words fell flat: Mary only shrugged her shoulders in
reply. Tours and exhibitions meant nothing to her. She hadn't the
least desire to travel&mdash;or at any rate to go farther afield
than Sydney or Tasmania. She had been so happy here...so perfectly
happy! Why, oh why, could Richard not be content? And that he could
forget so easily how he had hated England...and disliked the
English...well, no, she must be fair to him. As he said, life over
there would be a very different thing now they had money. (Though
all the money in the world wouldn't stop it raining!) He might also
be right about the voyage doing the chicks good; and it would
certainly give them, tiny tots though they were, just that
something which colonial-bred children lacked. But oh, her
home!...her beautiful home. To have to hand it over to strangers,
have strangers tramping on your best carpets, sleeping in your
beds, using your egg-shell china&mdash;even the best of tenants
would not care for the things as she did. She had asked nothing
better than to spend the rest of her life at "Ultima Thule"; and
here now came Richard, for whom even a few years of it had proved
too many. Luxury and comfort, or poverty and hard work, it did not
seem to matter which: the root of the evil lay in himself. On the
other hand she mustn't forget how splendidly he had behaved over
John's illness: never grumbling at her long absences, or at being
left to the tender mercies of the servants. Many another husband
might have said: let them hire some one to do their nursing, and
not wear out my wife over it! But Richard wasn't like that.</p>

<p>And her first heat cooled, wiser counsels prevailed; the end of
which was a sturdy resolve to smother her own feelings and think
only of him. Two considerations finally turned the scale. One was
that when, with Lizzie's convalescence, she was free to return
home, she had a nasty shock at the state in which she found
Richard. Without her to nag at him and rout him out, he had let
himself go as never before: he had forgotten to change his
under-clothing or have his hair cut; had neglected his meals,
neglected the children&mdash;lost interest even in his beloved
garden. And for all this they had to thank that horrid
spiritualism! During the last few months it had come to be a
perfect obsession with him; and from a tolerably clear-headed
person he had turned into a bundle of credulous superstition. He
actually sat for as long as an hour at a time, with a pencil in his
hand, waiting for it to write by itself&mdash;write messages from
the dead...and wasn't he angry when she laughed at him!</p>

<p>This was one thing&mdash;the chance for him of a complete break
with all such nonsense. Again, coming back to him as it were with
fresh eyes, she saw that he was beginning to look very elderly. He
seemed to be growing downwards, losing his height, through always
sitting crouched over books; and the fair silky hair at his temples
was quite silvery now, did you peer closely at it. It was hard to
think of Richard as old...and him still well under fifty. Yet the
coming on of age might account for much. Elderly people did settle
into ruts; and, once fixed in them, were impossible to move.
Perhaps his present morbid hankering after change was a kind of
warning from something inside him to shake himself up and get out
of his groove before it was too late. In which case it would be
folly and worse than folly, on her part, to try to prevent him.</p>

<p>For his sake then and for his alone. When it came to a question
of Richard's welfare, all other considerations went by the board.
One condition, though, she did stand out for, and that was, the
house should not be let to any one, no matter whom, for longer than
a year. By then, she was positive, Richard would have had his fill
of travelling, with the varied discomforts it implied, and be
thankful to get back to his own dear home.</p>

<p>Thus it came that "Ultima Thule" was put into an agent's hands,
and Mary fell to sorting and packing and making her preparations
for the long sea voyage. Not the least of these was fitting the
three children out anew from top to toe. Richard had forbidden them
even an armband as mourning for their uncle&mdash;he was never done
railing at Lizzie for having turned John's three into little
walking mountains of bombazine and crepe. So Mary was free to
indulge her love for dainty stuffs and pretty colours. And, thought
she, if ever children paid for dressing hers did. The Dumplings
were by now lovely, fair-haired, blue-eyed three-year-olds, with
serious red mouths and firm chubby legs. They prattled the livelong
day; loved and were loved by every one. Cuffy, dark, slim,
retiring, formed just the right contrast. People often stopped
nurse to ask whose children they were. And on this, their first
excursion into the big world, nobody should be able to say they
were not the best-dressed, best-cared-for children on the ship!</p>

<p>Before, however, a suitable tenant for the house had been
found&mdash;Richard turned up his nose at every one who had so far
looked over it (when it came to the point he was the fastidious one
of the two)&mdash;before anything had been fixed, a note came from
Tilly saying she and Purdy had travelled down from Ballarat
overnight, and were putting up at "Scott's." So after breakfast
Mary on with her bonnet and drove to town.</p>

<p>She found Tilly in a fine sitting-room on the first floor of the
hotel, looking very, very prosperous...all silk and bugles. Purdy
was out, on the business that had brought him to town: "So we two
have all the morning, love, to jaw in." As she spoke, Tilly whipped
off Mary's bonnet and mantle and carried them to the bedroom,
supplying Mary meanwhile with one of her own caps, lest any one
should enter the room and find her with a bare pate. Then, a second
chair having been drawn up for her to put her feet on, a table with
cake and wine set at her elbow, they were free to fall to work.
They had not met since Tilly's wedding; and Mary had now to tell
the whole sad story of John's illness and death, starting from the
night on which he had unexpectedly come to consult Richard, and not
omitting his queer hallucination the day before he died (an
incident she had so far religiously kept from Richard, as only too
likely to encourage his present craze). Next they discussed Lizzie,
her behaviour during John's illness, her attitude to the children
and the birth of her boy&mdash;a peevish, puny infant to whom, much
against her inclination, she thinking the world of her own family
and little of any other, she had been induced to give John's name.
And then John's will, "John's infamous will!" as Richard called it,
by which Lizzie was left sole executrix, and trustee of Emmy and
the little girls' money (five thousand apiece), with free use of
the interest so long as she provided a home for them under her
roof. "Which, as you can see, Tilly, is about as foolish a
condition as the poor fellow could well have made."</p>

<p>Tilly nodded; but suppressed the: "Yes, but oh how like 'im!"
that jumped to her lips, on the principle of not picking holes in
the dead. "But what about if Madam marries again...eh, Mary? How
then?"</p>

<p>Mary nodded ruefully. "Why, then it's the usual thing: she's cut
off with a penny; most of her money goes to the boy; and Richard
and Jerry become trustees in her stead." But, extenuating where
Tilly had suppressed, Mary added: "You must remember the will was
drawn up directly after marriage, when John was still very much in
love."</p>

<p>"Lor', Mary, <i>what</i> a picnic!" said Tilly, and sagely
wagged her head. "My dear, can't you see 'em? Madam, gone sour as
curds, clinging like grim death to 'er posse of old maids! Poor old
Jinn! Poor little kids! Caught like fishes in a net."</p>

<p>"Yes, well, except that...as Richard says...it's very
unlikely..."</p>

<p>Their eyes met.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I suppose it is," said Tilly dryly.</p>

<p>Thence they passed to their own affairs; and Mary told of the
fresh uprootal that was in store for her&mdash;and, over the
telling, let out some of the exasperation that burned in her at the
prospect. Tilly was the one person who would understand what it
meant; to whom she could utter a word of complaint. To the world at
large Richard and she must, and would, always present a united
front.</p>

<p>Said she: "Oh, I <i>did</i> think this time, Tilly, he would be
content; when he'd got everything he could possibly wish for. It
was a different matter him leaving Ballarat&mdash;and I couldn't
blame him myself for not wanting to settle permanently in England.
But here...our nice house...his library...the garden...And the
stupid part of it is I know he'll regret it...tire of being on the
move long before we can get back into the house. I'm making up my
mind to <i>that</i>, before I start."</p>

<p>"Poor old girl! You do have a tough time of it."</p>

<p>"Besides, there are the chicks to think of now as well. Their
father says the voyage will do them good, and he may be right. But
the voyage isn't everything. What about the change of climate for
them while they're so small?&mdash;going over into the cold as we
shall do. Then, travelling isn't the thing for little
children&mdash;you know what an excitable child Cuffy
is.&mdash;Besides, just think what it's going to cost us, with
three servants, renting a furnished house in London, making a tour
of the Continent and all the rest of it. Richard has such grand
notions nowadays. Economy's a word that has ceased to exist for
him. The money's there and it's to be spent, and that's the end of
it. But it does sometimes seem...I mean I can't help feeling it
would be better if I had some idea what we've got and how it
goes."</p>

<p>But having opened her heart thus, Mary came to a stop: there
were things she drew the line at touching on, and though her hearer
was only Tilly. You did not, even to your dearest friend, belabour
the point that your husband was growing old and rusty, stiff in
body and in mind. You locked the knowledge up, with a pang, inside
your own heart. Again, Tilly had always made such game of
spiritualism. Did she now hear that, from an interested inquirer,
Richard had become an out-and-out adherent, accepting as gospel the
rubbish its devotees talked, attending sittings which opened with
prayers and hymns, just as if they were trying to take the place of
going to church&mdash;why, at this, Tilly would certainly tap her
forehead and make significant eyes, imagining goodness only knew
what. So Mary kept a wifely silence.</p>

<p>Besides, it was Tilly's turn now to talk. Tilly had brought a
rare budget of gossip with her from the old home; and no one could
give this in racier, more entertaining fashion than she. Mary
listened and laughed, throwing in a reproving: "Now, <i>really</i>,
Tilly!" at some of the speaker's most daring shots; growing
grave-eyed were the tragedies alluded to that underlay many a
prosperous exterior.</p>

<p>Not till all the old friends had been asked after, did she press
nearer home. "And now, Tilly, how about yourself, my dear? Are
you...has it...come! you know what I mean!"</p>

<p>Tilly laughed out loud. "Indeed and it has, old girl!&mdash;and
no apologies needed. Yes, love, the very best of husbands. But I
was right as rain, Mary, in what I said beforehand&mdash;no
spendthrift as I'm alive! Why, 'e even goes to the other extreme,
love, and holds the purse-strings a bit tighter than yours truly
'as been used to. Though it's not for me to complain, my dear,
considering 'ow he handles money. I'm still a bit dazed by it
myself. A born knack with the shekels, and that's the truth! I
declare to you, old Pa's leavings have almost <i>doubled</i> in
these six months. Purd's got a sort of second-sight, which tells
'im to the minute what o'clock it is. All that was wrong with him,
Mary, was never having enough of the needful to show what 'e was
made of."</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>am</i> glad to hear that&mdash;I am indeed!"</p>

<p>She went home full of the news. "We were both wrong, you
see."</p>

<p>But it would not have been Richard if he hadn't made ironical
remarks. Wait till the bloom was off the grapes, said he, and then
see how the land lay. For, if Purdy had started speculating
already..."Ah, but Tilly says he has a kind of sixth sense for the
ups and downs of the market."</p>

<p>"Many a wife thinks the same, till the crash comes. But you know
<i>my</i> opinion of the national vice."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll be able to judge for yourself. I've asked them to
dinner this evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, deuce take it! Have we really got to have them here?"</p>

<p>"Now, Richard...when Tilly's in town for the first time since
her wedding. Certainly we have. Besides, I know you'll be
interested to see what marriage has done for Purdy."</p>

<p>"Oh Lord, Mary! Am I not at my time of life allowed to know what
interests me and what doesn't?"</p>

<p>"Well, I shan't see Tilly again for ever so long. I do beg you
to be nice to her, dear...to both of them," said Mary.</p>

<p>And when the time came he was...of course he was: with the near
prospect of escape from people, Richard invariably found it easy to
be charming to them. Another thing, she had pandered to his weak
side by preparing a very choice little dinner; and she wore one of
his favourite dresses&mdash;a black velvet gown, with jet
trimmings, cut square at the neck.</p>

<p>But without a doubt, the main reason for his amiability was the
immense improvement that had taken place in Purdy: it was
noticeable even as the latter entered the drawing-room. In
appearance he would, it was true, never be very much, what with his
limp, and so on; and his lack of distinction was doubly remarkable
when Richard was present, who was so slender and
aristocratic-looking. But his aggressiveness had gone; he was no
longer up in arms against the world. Gone, too, was the dreadful
boasting that had so set Richard against him; and he had quite
given over telling tiresome stories...thanks, thought Mary, to
having married one of the most sensible of women. At the single
threatened lapse into his old tone, she distinctly felt Tilly seek
and find his foot beneath the table.</p>

<p>"Didn't I say she'd pull him into shape?" and: "Upon my word,
wife, if ever there was an exploded notion, it is that the
possession of this world's goods makes for evil. Why, there was
actually a trace of his old self about the fellow to-night."</p>

<p>The ormolu clock on the drawing-room mantelpiece had just chimed
eleven. Mary was giving her toes a final toast before retiring,
Richard securing the hasps and bolts of shutters and French
windows.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," agreed Mary; but with an absent air. She was
thinking of Tilly&mdash;dear old Tilly&mdash;in whom the change had
been no less marked. Looking very buxom and rather handsome in
magenta velvet, Tilly had sat smiling broadly, but with less to say
for herself than ever in her life before. Instead of paying
attention to Richard, as she ought to have done, she had all the
time been listening to Purdy, drinking in his words, and signing to
Mary to listen, too, by many a private tilt of the brows. So
palpably eager was she for him to shine that she had been unable to
resist breaking in with a: "Oh, come now, Purd, take a
<i>leetle</i> bit of the credit to yourself!&mdash;it was his doing
really, Mary, and no one else's, though 'e tries now to make out it
was Blake's." And at Purdy's: "Forgive my old woman's dotage, you
two...it's still kissing-time with us, you know!"&mdash;at this
Tilly had smirked and blushed like a sixteen-year-old.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Richard was saying from the hearthrug, where he stood
nursing his coat-tails: "...an interesting chat after you had left
the room, my dear. I was hearing all about the Mitcham case from
within&mdash;the big mining suit, you know, that has created such a
scandal in Ballarat...you must remember old Grenville of Canterbury
Station, his deafness and his expletives, and those enormous black
cigars&mdash;he always had one stuck in the corner of his mouth
when he drove his four-in-hand to town."</p>

<p>"Of course I do. A very kind old gentleman I thought him."</p>

<p>"Yes...he had rather a way with the ladies.&mdash;Well, as I was
saying, this fellow Blake Purdy swears by was one of the partners
in the company formed after old G. had sold his mine&mdash;at a
dead loss, mind you, and on the express advice of his confidential
manager, who, directly after, became a promoter of the new company.
When the output suddenly redoubled and the shares began to soar,
old Grenville, naturally enough, thought he had been done, and sued
them for fraud. The jury could not agree. Now, there's rumour of a
settlement. If it takes place, it is calculated that the shares
will rise in value by two to three hundred per cent. Purdy stands
to make his fortune&mdash;thanks to having some one at his elbow
who is in the swim."</p>

<p>But Mary pursed her lips and looked dubious. "Well, I don't
know, Richard...I must say it sounds to me rather shady."</p>

<p>"Hm...well, myself I prefer to keep clear of that sort of thing.
All the same, Mary, I couldn't help thinking what a terrible
slowcoach old Simmonds is, compared with these modern brokers one
hears of. One never gets any inside information from him&mdash;for
the very good reason that he doesn't know it himself."</p>

<p>"But so honest and trustworthy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there's that about it," said Richard, a trifle
morosely Mary thought.</p>

<p>"And what do you say to the house? Wasn't it a funny thing Purdy
tumbling across some one, like that?" she hastened to add, in an
attempt to divert his mind from old Simmonds's shortcomings.</p>

<p>"A stroke of luck of the first order!"</p>

<p>For amongst other news Purdy had had a titbit for them. Only
that very day, it seemed, in the coffee-room of the hotel, he had
run up against a squatter from Darumbooli who was on the look-out
for a furnished house, standing in its own grounds and not too far
from the sea, where he could settle wife and daughters while the
latter attended a finishing school. Purdy had at once thought of
"Ultima Thule" and extolled its beauties: its lawns and shrubberies
and fruit gardens, its proximity to the sea. The squatter had
pricked up his ears and, if they agreed, would come out to see it
early next morning.</p>

<p>Whereupon the last trace of Mahony's starchedness had melted, in
a glow of gratitude and content.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Mary, it sounds the very thing, at last!"</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-7" id="ch-2-3-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>That night he could not sleep. To begin with, he had been unused
of late to an evening's talk: bits and scraps of it went on buzzing
round his brain, long after he lay abed. Then, something he had
eaten had disagreed with him: Cook's short-crust must have been too
rich, or the pears over-ripe. He tossed and turned, to the
disturbance of poor Mary; tried lying high, lying low, counting
sheep and other silly tricks, all to no purpose: before an hour had
passed, the black thoughts of the night&mdash;those sinister
imaginings born of darkness and immobility&mdash;had him in their
grip.</p>

<p>Their approach was stealthy. For he had gone to bed in high
feather at the prospect of at last securing a tenant. Weeks had
dragged by, and the house was still unlet. He fumed as often as he
thought of it. To put a house like his on the market and get no
offers for it! Sell?...yes; he could have sold three times over.
But the idea of renting a place ready furnished seemed not to enter
the colonial mind. Now, however, if Purdy was to be trusted...A
rich squatter, too...willing no doubt to pay a good price for a
good thing&mdash;though this condition was not, God be thanked, the
<i>sine qua non</i> it would once have been. Still, money was
money; you could not have too much of it...especially here. Give a
man means and you gave him friends and favours, and a rank second
to none. To take a petty instance: what had money not done for the
very person they had had before their eyes that evening? From the
seedy little down-at-heel of a year back, Purdy had been
metamorphosed into...well, at least rendered presentable enough to
bid to your table. Money had restored his shrunken self-respect. It
had also brought out in him talents which not his oldest friends
had guessed at. That Purdy, of all people, should prove a dabster
in the share-market!&mdash;exchange to such good purpose
bar-parlour for "Corner." No doubt the years he had spent
hobnobbing with every variety of individual had sharpened his wits.
You saw something of that in the shrewd choice he had made of a
broker. For, three parts of the game, did you enter the big gamble,
depended on having a wide-awake adviser at your elbow. And this man
Blake, of whom they had heard so much that night, did actually seem
to be one in a thousand.</p>

<p>One in a thousand...one in a thousand...a thousand...Mahony was
on the point of dropping off, to the rhythm of these words, when a
vague uneasiness began to stir in him; more exactly, when he became
abruptly aware that, deep down in him, a nagging anxiety had for
some time been at work. Coming to with a jerk, he sent his thoughts
back over the evening. What was it?...what had happened to prick
him, when all had seemed to go so smoothly? He groped and groped.
Then...ha!...he had it. Simmonds. The name whizzed into his mind
like a dart; like a dart stuck there, and was not to be plucked
out. And no sooner had he found this clue than, with a rush, a
swarm of vexatious thoughts and impressions was upon him. His
apparent good spirits were all humbug; at heart he had been
depressed by the tale of Purdy's successes. They had made him feel
a back number, an old fossil, who had to learn from some one he had
always looked down on as his inferior, what was actually happening
in the financial world. And for this he held Simmonds to blame.
What was the use of a confidential agent who did not keep you up to
the mark?&mdash;Not that he wanted to speculate; or at least not as
the word was here understood. But he wished to feel that he
<i>could</i> have done so, and with as much aplomb as anybody, did
the fit take him. And brooding over the chances he had no doubt
missed and even at this moment might be missing: at a picture of
himself lying high and dry, while one and another&mdash;mere
whipper-snappers like Purdy &mdash;floated easily out to fortune,
an acute irritation mastered him.</p>

<p>He turned his pillow, and, even as he did so, told himself that
the fault had been not Simmonds's, but his own. Yes, the truth was,
he had had no ambition. Otherwise, why have laid his affairs in the
hands of such a humdrum?&mdash;and, what was worse, have left them
there. Honest?&mdash;yes: but so was many a noodle honest: and in
these new countries honesty alone, unbacked by any more worldly
qualities, stood not an earthly chance. And again a vision danced
before his closed lids. He saw the thousands he had failed to
make&mdash;thousands that grew to hundreds of thousands as he
watched&mdash;fluttering just beyond <i>his</i> grasp, though
within easy reach of others. And now, to sting him, the earlier
bitterness returned...in the form of a galling envy. To see Purdy,
the foolish harum-scarum, the confessed failure, the mean little
<i>commis voyageur</i>&mdash;to see such a one about to pass,
surpass him, in means and influence: this was surely one of the
bitterest mouthfuls he had ever had to swallow.</p>

<p>And here, seizing its chance, a further fear insinuated itself.
What if it should not end with this? Simmonds being what he was,
might he not fail in other ways as well?&mdash;let what he already
held slip through his fingers, and he, Mahony, wake one morning to
find himself a poor man? A shiver ran down his spine at the
thought, and he made a feverish movement: he would have liked to
throw off the bedclothes, and go hotfoot to call Simmonds to
account. Since he was condemned to lie like a log, his imagination
did the work for him, running riot in a series of pictures...till
cold drops stood out on his forehead.</p>

<p>Sitting up he fumbled for a handkerchief. The change of position
brought him a moment's calmness. Good Lord, what was he
doing...working himself into such a state. It was like those bad
old times when he had had to worry himself half to death about
money...or the lack of it. He drank a glass of water, and rolled
over on his other side.</p>

<p>Scarcely, however, had his head touched the pillow when he was
off again, stabbed by yet another nightmare thought. What if it
should be a case of fraud on Simmonds's part? Might not the
lethargy, the stolid honesty be but a pose?&mdash;the cloak to
cover a rascally activity? Like the confidential agent whose
double-dealing they had heard of that night, it would be child's
play for Simmonds, just because he appeared so straight and
aboveboard, to fleece his clients&mdash;or at least such among them
as gave him the open chances he, Mahony, had. Careless, distraught,
interested in everything rather than in money, he had ambled along
unthinking as a babe, leaving Simmonds to his own devices for
months, nay, years, at a time. Now, he could not wait for daylight
to get his affairs back into his own hands. If only he were not too
late!&mdash;And thus on and on, ever deeper into the night, his
suspicions growing steadily more sinister, till there was no crime
of which he was not ready to suspect his man of business. A dozen
times he had trapped him, unmasked him, brought him to justice,
before he fell into a feverish doze, in which not Simmonds but
himself was the fugitive, hunted by two monstrous shadow policemen
who believed him criminal before the law. Waking with a terrific
start he pulled himself together, only at once to sink back in
dream. This time, he was being led by Purdy and some one strangely
resembling that bottle-nosed Robinson who had played him a dirty
trick over an English practice, to a cemetery, where stood a
tombstone bearing Simmonds's name. Why, good Lord! the fellow's
dead...dead?...and what of me? "Who's got my money? Where is it?
Where am I?" cried Mahony aloud&mdash;and woke at the sound of his
own voice to see pale lines of light creeping in at the sides of
the windows. His pulse was bounding, Mary sleepily murmuring: "Oh
dear, oh dear, what <i>is</i> the matter?"&mdash;Rising, he opened
a window and stuck his hot head out in the morning air.</p>

<p>At breakfast-time he emerged pale and peevish, to a day that
proved hardly less wearing than the night had been. One, too, that
called for a clear brain and prompt decisions. For the owner of
Darumbooli, Baillie by name, put in an appearance as
arranged&mdash;an elderly Scot, tanned, sun-wrinkled,
grey-whiskered, with a bluff yet urbane manner&mdash;a self-made
man, it was plain, and wholly unlettered, but frank, generous,
honourable: one of nature's gentlemen, in short, and of a type
Mahony invariably found it easy to do business with. Better still,
he turned out to be one of your genuine garden-lovers: as the pair
of them walked the grounds of "Ultima Thule," none of the details
and improvements Mahony felt proudest of but was observed and
bespoken: the white-strawberry bed, the oleander grove, the
fernery, the exquisitely smooth buffalo-grass lawns on which sprays
were kept playing. A good garden was, it seemed, a desideratum with
Baillie. And he fell in love with Mahony's at first sight.</p>

<p>But...yes, yes! now came the fly in the ointment...he wished not
to rent but to buy: had never, he averred, had any idea of renting
a house: it was entirely "that fellow Smith's mistake" ("all
Purdy's muddle!"). The schooling proved another bit of fiction. His
daughters were past their school years; of an age to be launched in
society. Darumbooli was up for sale&mdash;Baillie had already
refused a bid of ninety thousand&mdash;and planned from now on to
settle in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Having thus cleared the air and added that, only the day before,
he had seen a house at Toorak which, though not a patch on this,
would serve his purpose, he offered a sum for "Ultima Thule," just
as it stood, with all its contents, which sent Mahony's eyebrows
half-way up his forehead.</p>

<p>Mary was speechless when she heard the upshot of the interview;
when, too, she saw that Richard's mind&mdash;that mind which seemed
unable to hold fast to any mortal thing for long together&mdash;was
more than three parts made up to accept Baillie's offer. And too
discomfited to meet this Irish fluidity with her usual wily
caution, she no sooner found her voice than she cried: "Oh,
Richard, <i>no!</i>&mdash;that we <i>can't</i> do...we really
can't! Think of all the things we got specially out from home...the
French tapestry...the carpets...and...and everything!"</p>

<p>Tch! now he had this to go through...on top of his bad night,
and his own burning irresolution. His nerves felt like the frayed
ends of a rope. But as usual opposition spurred him on.</p>

<p>"But, my dear, with such a sum at our disposal, we shall be able
to furnish our <i>next</i> house ten times as well. Look here,
Mary, I tell you what we'll do. We'll bring every atom of stuff out
with us, from London or Paris: the very newest of
everything&mdash;there won't be a house in the colony like it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard!...oh, I <i>do</i> think&mdash;" For an instant
bitterness choked Mary. Then, she could not resist pricking him
with a: "And have <i>you</i> decided to let all your books go, as
well?"</p>

<p>"My books? Most certainly not! I made that clear on the
spot.&mdash;But how absurd, Mary! What would a man whose whole life
has been spent among sheep and cattle do with my volumes of physic
and metaphysics?" But Mary put on her obstinate face. "Well, my
things mean just as much to me as yours to you."</p>

<p>"Now for goodness sake, my dear, be reasonable!" cried Richard,
growing excessively heated. "I suppose even a squatter can use a
chair or a sofa; needs a bed and a table; but what, I ask you,
would he make of Lavater?...or the Church Fathers?"</p>

<p>"It's always the same. I'm to give up everything, you
nothing.&mdash;But if my wishes and feelings can be trampled on,
don't you care about the children?...I mean about them all having
been born here?"</p>

<p>"Indeed and I do not! I would no more have them tie their
feelings to the shell of a house than I'd have mourners hang round
a grave."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no talking to you nowadays, your head's so full of
windy stuff. But I tell you this, Richard, I refuse to have my
children dragged from place to place...as I've been. It's not as if
it's ever helped a bit either, our giving up home after home.
You're always wild, at the moment, to get away, but afterwards
you're no happier than you were before. And then, what makes me so
angry, you let yourself be influenced by such silly, trivial
things. I believe you're ready to sell this house just because you
<i>like</i> the man who wants to buy it, or because he's praised up
the garden. But you'll be sorry for it, I know you will, before
three months are out. I haven't lived with you all these years for
nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh well, my dear," said Mahony darkly, "I'm an old man now, and
you won't be troubled with me much longer. When I'm gone you'll be
able to do just as you please."</p>

<p>Mary's black eyes flashed, and her lips opened to a sharp
retort; then she snapped them to, and said nothing. For to this
there could be no real reply; and Richard knew it.</p>

<p>The bargain struck&mdash;for struck of course it was, as she had
seen from the first it would be: thereafter it only remained for
Mary to apply her age-old remedy, and make the best of a very bad
job. But the present was by so much the most unreasonable thing
Richard had ever done, and she herself felt so sore and exasperated
over it, that not for several days was she cool enough to discuss
the matter with him. Then, however, each coming half-way to meet
the other, they had a long talk, in the course of which Mahony
sought to make amends by letting her into some of his money
secrets, and she extracted a solemn promise that, except for a mere
fringe&mdash;a couple of thousand, say, for travelling and other
immediate expenses&mdash;the sum he was receiving (it ran to five
figures) should be kept for the purpose of setting them up anew on
their return to the colony. Mahony bade her make her mind easy.
They ought to be able to live as comfortably on their dividends in
England, as here; and the price paid for "Ultima Thule" should be
faithfully laid by for the purpose of building, when they came
back, the house that would form their permanent home. "For by then
my travelling days will be over. We'll plan it together, love,
every inch of it; and it will be more our own than any house we've
lived in."</p>

<p>"Yes, I dare say." But Mary's tone lacked warmth, was rich in
incredulity.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-8" id="ch-2-3-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>And now for Simmonds.</p>

<p>As he made ready to go to town Mahony recalled, with a smile,
his grotesque imaginings of two nights back. What a little hell the
mind could create for a man's undoing! But none the less, though he
now ridiculed them, his nightmares had left a kind of tingling
disquietude in their train. He felt he would do well to have a
straight talk with Simmonds, go carefully through his share-list,
and arrange in detail for the conduct of his affairs during his
absence.</p>

<p>He went off jauntily enough. "Don't expect me till about
six."</p>

<p>But not a couple of hours later, as Mary was on her knees before
a drawer of the great wardrobe she was beginning to dismantle, she
heard his foot on the verandah, and the next moment his voice,
sharp, querulent, distracted, cried: "Mary! Mary, where are
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear? I'm coming. Why, Richard, whatever is wrong now?"
For with a despairing gesture Mahony had tossed his hat on the
hall-table, and himself dropped heavily on a chair.</p>

<p>"You may well ask. Here's a pretty kettle of fish! It's all over
now with our getting away."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? But not here. The servants...Come into the
bedroom. Well, you do look hot and tired."</p>

<p>She brought him a glass of water, and while he sat and sipped
this, she listened to his story; listened, and put two and two
together. Arrived at his agent's office in Great Bourke Street, he
had found to his surprise and annoyance that Simmonds was absent
from business. Worse still, had been, for over two months. He was
ill, bedridden&mdash;yes, seriously ill. "Confound the fellow! I
believe he means to die, just to inconvenience me. Mary! my dream
the other night...it flashed across me as I walked home. Depend
upon it, one doesn't dream that kind of thing for nothing."
Richard's tone was full of gloomiest foreboding.</p>

<p>"What nonsense, dear! How can you be so silly!"</p>

<p>In place of Simmonds he had been met by a...well, by a sort of
clerk, who was in charge&mdash;at least he presumed so: he had
never set eyes on the fellow before, and never meant to again, if
he could help it! "To find a par to his behaviour, Mary, you would
need to go back to the early days, when every scoundrelly Tom, Dick
and Harry thought himself your equal."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>Say? Well, first, it was plain to Mary, he had not known from
Adam who Richard was. Without getting up from his chair, not
troubling to take his head out of a newspaper, he had asked the
intruder's pleasure in the free-and-easy colonial fashion which,
long as he had lived there, Richard had never learned to swallow.
Besides, not to be recognised in a place he honoured with his
patronage was in itself a source of offence. Haughtily presenting
his card (which, she could see, had lamentably failed to produce an
effect), he demanded to speak to Simmonds, with whom he had
important business.</p>

<p>"Pray, what answer do you think I got? In a voice, my dear, the
twang of which you could have cut with a knife, I was informed:
'Well, in that case, doc., I guess you'll have to keep it
snug&mdash;locked up in your own bosom, so to say! For the boss
lies sick abed, and all the business in the world wouldn't get him
up from it.' Whereupon I clapped on my hat and walked out of the
place! In which, as long as Simmonds is away, I shall not set foot
again. But now, as you can see, we're in a pretty fix. All our
plans knocked on the head! The house sold, the agreement
signed&mdash;or as good as signed...it's utterly impossible to draw
back. Why the deuce was I in such a hurry? We shall have to go into
apartments, Mary&mdash;take the children into common lodgings. Good
God! Such a thing is not to be contemplated for a moment."</p>

<p>Mary let him talk; listened to this and much more before she
threw in a mild: "We'll take a furnished house. There'd be nothing
common about that.&mdash;All the same, I don't believe Simmonds,
who has always been so straight, would put any one in to look after
things who wasn't honest, too&mdash;in spite of uncouth behaviour.
And you can't refuse to deal with a person just because he has no
manners...and doesn't know how to address you."</p>

<p>"My dear Mary, it has been a one-man show all these years; and
the probability is, when the old fellow broke down he had no one to
turn to. But I can assure you, if I left my investments in such
hands I shouldn't know a moment's peace all the time I was away.
Besides, if he does die, the whole concern will probably go
smash."</p>

<p>Oh, the fuss and the flutter! As if it wasn't bad enough to have
your house sold over your head, without this fresh commotion on top
of it. There must surely be something very slipshod and
muddle-headed about the way Richard managed his affairs. She didn't
say so, but, had she been in his shoes, she would have known long
ago of Simmonds's illness. As it was, this clerk might have been
cheating the clients right and left. But anything to do with money
(except, of course, the spending of it!) had of late years become
anathema to Richard.</p>

<p>Now he went about with a hand pressed to an aching head; and
after putting up with this for some days and herself feeling wholly
at a loss, Mary made a private journey to town to visit Tilly. She
would see what that practical, sagacious woman thought of the
situation. Tilly, of course, at once laid her finger on the weak
spot by asking bluntly: "But whyever doesn't the doctor take advice
of some of 'is friends?&mdash;the big-bow-wow ones, I mean. They'd
be able to tell 'im, right enough."</p>

<p>"Why, the fact is, Richard hasn't got...I mean his friends are
not business men, any more than he is. If only John were alive!
He'd have been the one."</p>

<p>"Well, look here, Poll, I can ask Purd about it if you like. He
may know, and if e doesn't, 'e can easily find out&mdash;I mean
whether old S. is really going to hop the twig or what. Purd has
strings 'e can pull."</p>

<p>Mary went home intending to keep silence about her
intermeddling&mdash;at any rate till she saw what came of it. But
Richard was regularly in the doldrums: he had to be comforted
somehow. At first, as she had expected, he was furious; and abused
her like a pickpocket for discussing his private affairs with an
outsider. "You <i>know</i> how I hate publicity! As for telling
them in that quarter...why, I might as well go out and shout them
from the housetop."</p>

<p>"Richard...you can't afford...if you re really set on getting
away...to mind now who knows and who doesn't."</p>

<p>But on this point, as always, they joined issue. He accused her
of lacking personal dignity; she said that his ridiculous secrecy
over money matters would end by leading people to believe there was
something fishy about them.</p>

<p>"Let them! What does it matter to me what they think?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know anyone who'd resent it <i>more</i>&mdash;so
proud and touchy as you are! And since home truths were the order
of the day," she added: "You know, dear, its just this: you've only
yourself to thank for the fix you're in. You've cut yourself off
from every one, and now, when you need help, you haven't a soul to
turn to. And because I have, and make use of them, then your
pride's hurt."</p>

<p>Which was the very truth. He had let slip friends and
acquaintances who at this juncture might have been useful to him;
but...could one nurse people, the inner impulse to friendship
failing, solely from motives of opportunism? The idea revolted him.
True, also, was what she said about the damage to his pride. Not,
however, because they were <i>her</i> friends as she supposed, but
because they were the friends they were. Again, he shrank in
advance from the silly figure he was going to cut, did the story
get about town how he had sold his house and packed his
portmanteaux, while, all unknown to him, the chief spoke in his
wheel had collapsed. What a fool he would look! Though the fact
was, Simmonds had handled his affairs without supervision for so
long, that he had come to look on the fellow as a kind of fixture
in his life.</p>

<p>And, in spite of everything, his determination to get away did
not weaken. In mind, he had already started&mdash;was out on the
high seas. Impossible now to call his thoughts home. And the
feeling that such a course might be expected of him&mdash;that Mary
would expect it&mdash;only served to throw him into a frenzy of
impatience; make him more blackly intolerant of each fresh obstacle
that blocked his path.</p>

<p>Then Tilly appeared: he saw her from the window, all furbelows
and flounces, and wearing an air at once important and mysterious.
She and Mary retired to the drawing-room; and there he could hear
them jabbering, discussing <i>him</i> and his concerns, as he sat
pretending to read. This went on and on&mdash;would they never end?
Even when plainer tones, and the opening and shutting of doors
seemed to herald Tilly's departure, all that followed was a sheerly
endless conversation on the step of the verandah. By the time Mary
came in to him, he was nervily a-shake. And her news was as bad as
it could be. Old Simmonds was doomed; was in the last stages of
Bright's disease; his place of business would know him no more.
Most of his clients had already transferred to other agents; and
Purdy's advice to Richard was, to lose no time in following their
example.</p>

<p>"Huh! All very well...very easily said! But to whom am I to
turn, I'd like to know?...when there isn't one honest broker in a
thousand. Swindlers&mdash;damned swindlers!&mdash;that's what they
are, every man-jack of 'em. And here am I, just going out of the
colony, and with all this fresh money to invest."</p>

<p>Said Mary: "I've been thinking" (which, of course, meant
tittle-tattling with Tilly), "why not write to Mr. Henry and
consult him? He's such a good business man, and knows so many
people. He might be able to recommend some one to you." But with
this suggestion she only added fuel to the inordinate, unreasonable
grudge which Richard still bore every one connected with the old
life. "Nothing would induce me!...to eat humble pie before that
crew!"</p>

<p>"Well then, <i>do</i> let us postpone our journey...if only for
six months."</p>

<p>He was equally stubborn. "Sooner than that&mdash;if it comes to
that!&mdash;I'll sell right out and take every penny I possess to
the other side. And never set foot in the colony again."</p>

<p>"Now, for goodness sake, Richard!..." cried Mary; then bit her
lip. He was quite capable of carrying out his threat, did she make
the least show of opposition.</p>

<p>However, on this occasion his rashness took another form. After
spending the whole of the next day in town, where he had gone to
visit his banker, to settle with his wine merchant, arrange for the
storing of his books and so on, he came home to dinner looking a
different man. On her, who had gone about all day with a crease
between her brows, not knowing whether to pack for a voyage or for
the removal to another house, he burst in, and catching her by the
waist kissed her and swung her round. "Here's your bear come home.
But cheer up, Mary, cheer up, my love, and make your mind easy! All
will yet be well."</p>

<p>"What? Do you mean to say you've actually&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank the Lord, I have!"</p>

<p>Over the dinner-table he gave her particulars. At the end of a
bothersome, wasted morning he had dropped into "Scott's," and
there, in the coffee-room, had tumbled across Purdy.
("What!&mdash;<i>Purdy?</i>" was Mary's amazed inner comment, she
being as usual hard at work drawing inferences.) Purdy had met him
in friendliest fashion: "I've come to the conclusion, my dear, I've
sometimes been rather hard on the boy of late." They had lunched
together, over a chop and a bottle of claret had got talking, and
had sat for the better part of an hour. Naturally the subject of
Simmonds's collapse had come up, and the fix it had put him into.
Purdy&mdash;"'Pon my word, Mary, I saw to-day he's got his head
screwed on the right way!"&mdash;had given him various useful tips
how to deal with the modern broker, which an innocent old sheep
like himself would never have dreamt of. And then just at the end,
as they were making a move, Purdy had scratched his head and
believed he knew some one who might&mdash; "<i>Not</i> Blake?"</p>

<p>"Blake? Absurd! Good Lord, no!...Blake needs watching." (Richard
knew all about it to-night.) No, no: this was no flashy dare-devil,
but a steady-going, cautious sort of fellow, who could be trusted
to "look after your interests during your absence, and transmit
<i>the</i> interest...ha, ha!&mdash;Oh, and I must tell you this,
Mary. When he said&mdash;Purdy, I mean&mdash;'I believe I know some
one who'd suit you, Dick,' where do you suppose my thoughts flew?
They went back, love, to a day more years ago than I care to count,
when he used the self-same words. We were riding to Geelong
together, he and I, two carefree young
men&mdash;heigh-ho!&mdash;and not many hours after, I had the
honour of meeting a certain young lady...Well, wife, if this
introduction turns out but half as well as that, I shall have no
cause to complain. Anyway, I took it as a good omen. We hadn't time
then to go further into the matter; but I am to meet him again
to-morrow and hear all details."</p>

<p>He rattled on in the highest spirits, seeing everything fixed
and settled; and Mary had not the heart to damp him by putting
inconvenient, practical questions. And having said his say and
refilled her glass and his own, he sent for the children&mdash;they
had been hushed back into the nursery for the past three days,
while Papa had a headache. Now, setting his girlies on his knees,
with Cuffy standing before him, he told the trio of the big ship
that was coming to take them away, and on which they were to
live&mdash;for weeks, and weeks, and weeks to come.</p>

<p>The Dumplings' eyes grew round. "An' s'all us 'ave bekspup on ze
big s'ip?" asked Lallie, the elder of the twins.</p>

<p>"Bekspup on ze big s'ip?" echoed her sister.</p>

<p>"Breakfast <i>and</i> dinner, <i>and</i> tea, and go to sleep in
little beds like boxes built on to the wall, and look out of little
windows just big enough for your little heads, and see nothing,
wherever you look, but the great, wide sea."</p>

<p>"Ooo! Bekfast, <i>an'</i> dinner, <i>an'</i> tea!"&mdash;Cuffy
had to cut a few capers about the room to let off steam, before he
could listen to more.</p>

<p>Mary took no part in the merry chatter. And when Nannan had
fetched the children, she abruptly came back to the subject of her
thoughts. "Of course you'll see this person Purdy speaks of, see
what you think of him yourself, before actually deciding on
anything?"</p>

<p>"Of <i>course</i>, my dear, of course!"</p>

<p>"It seems rather...I mean, it seems strange Purdy didn't...And
as he is doing the recommending, I can't very well ask Tilly's
opinion."</p>

<p>"And who wants you to? I'll be very much obliged if you
<i>don't</i> interfere! Surely, Mary, I can be trusted to attend to
some of my own business? I'm not quite on the shelf yet, I
hope?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Richard. After all...I mean it's not so very long ago
and nothing would have induced you to take Purdy's advice."</p>

<p>"And pray who was it brought home glowing tales of how
splendidly he had got on, thanks to his acuteness and financial
genius, etc., etc., etc.?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But still..."</p>

<p>"But as soon as I come into it, or because I come into it, you
lose every atom of faith. I wonder if all wives are as distrustful
of their husbands' capabilities. A bad look-out for them if they
are."</p>

<p>Mary did not deny the charge. Doubtful she was, and doubtful she
remained: an attitude of mind that severely tried Mahony's temper,
he having more than one private scruple of his own.</p>

<p>For his second meeting with Purdy, in which he had planned to be
very cautious and to throw out wily feelers, was a failure. On
getting to the hotel he found that Purdy could spare him but a few
moments, himself having an urgent appointment to keep. They did not
sit down, and their talk was scampered through at lightning speed.
However, Purdy supplied him with a list of people for whom this man
Wilding had acted &mdash;well-known names they were too!&mdash;and
himself undertook to put in a word on Mahony's behalf. In the
meantime it would be as well for him to write and summon Wilding to
town.&mdash;Write? Yes; for now it turned out that Wilding's
business was carried on, not in Melbourne but in Ballarat. Purdy
vowed he had mentioned this fact the day before; but if so, Mahony
had failed to hear him. Not that it mattered much, seeing that he
himself was about to leave Melbourne. It might even, he agreed, the
majority of his investments being in Ballarat mines, prove a
benefit to have an agent who was on the spot.</p>

<p>Still, the conversation left him visibly less jubilant. While
from the interview he had some days later with Wilding himself, he
returned tired and headachy&mdash;always a bad sign where Richard
was concerned. He met Mary with a: "Well, my dear, all our troubles
are now over!"&mdash;which was true in so far as the business side
of the affair had gone off smoothly. The transfer had been
effected, power of attorney given, new investments arranged for,
his existing share-list overhauled and revised. But...well, he had
not been very favourably impressed by the man himself. He could
find no likeness in him to the portrait drawn by Purdy&mdash;and
probably amplified by his own mind, which looked for a second
Simmonds&mdash;of a staid and dignified man of affairs. No, Wilding
was again one of your rough diamonds: over-familiar, slangy, a
back-slapper, and, like every one else here, in a tearing hurry: he
hardly bothered to listen to what you said, knew everything you
were going to say beforehand, and better than you. His appearance,
too, was against him&mdash;at least to one who set store by the
fleshly screen. Wilding had a small, oblique eye; fat, pursed lips;
fat, grubby fingers on which flashy rings twinkled; a diamond pin
that took your breath away. Also, from an injudicious word he let
drop, the idea leapt at Mahony...well, it might be pure fancy on
his part...or owing to these unlovely looks...besides it was only a
fleeting impression...vaguely troubling. But come! it would not do
to let a personal antipathy to the man's appearance prejudice you
against him...as Mary was never tired of preaching. What though
Wilding was no beauty? Whose hands here <i>were</i> impeccably
clean? Was this not just the type of your modern broker, as
compared with one of the old school? The main thing, the only thing
that really mattered was that he should prove alert and up-to-date.
And in this respect his credentials were of the first water. What
was more, it leaked out, in something he said, that Purdy had
already been in correspondence with him over the affair. Might one
not safely assume a hint on Purdy's part that he himself meant to
keep an eye on things, during his friend's absence from the
colony?</p>

<p>And now, at last, nothing stood in the way of their departure;
and preparations were rushed forward that they might sail by the
vessel of their choice. Mahony superintended the sorting and
packing of his books, and saw them carted to a depository; then
rearranged the furniture and bought fresh pieces to fill the bare
walls where the bookcases had stood. Next he conveyed the
luggage&mdash;it filled a lorry&mdash;to the wharf, saw it aboard
and stowed away between hold and cabins. Of these, they had three
of the largest amidships; and the best warehouse in Melbourne had
carpeted, furnished, curtained them. No need, this time, for Mary
to toil and slave. Like a queen she had only to step aboard and
take possession.</p>

<p>They spent the last couple of days at an hotel. And one morning,
having received word overnight that the <i>Atrata</i> was ready to
sail, they packed into two landaus and were driven to William's
Town. There they found a pretty crowd assembled. Everybody they
knew, or had ever met, had turned out to see them off, headed by
dear old Sir Jake and Lady Devine, the Bishop and Mrs. Moreton,
Baron von Krause the famous botanist, old Judge Barmore and many
another, not to speak of Mary's intimate personal friends,
Richard's spiritualist circle, relatives and members of the family.
For a full half-hour they were hard at it, shaking hands and
exchanging greetings and farewells. Richard, in his new travelling
rig, spruce from top to toe, was urbanity itself: as indeed how
should he fail to be when, within cooee, rode the good ship that
was to carry him off? There was also a generous sprinkling of
children present, the colonial youngster never being denied the
chance of an outing. And to Cuffy, standing stiff and important in
red gloves and a tasselled sash, came Cousin Josephine to hiss in
his ear: "Ooo...aren't I glad I'M not going? Our servant, Mawy Ann,
says you'll pwobably <i>all</i> go to the bottom of the sea!" and
then to laugh maliciously at Cuffy's chalk-white face.</p>

<p>Rowed on board, they found the cabins hardly big enough to house
the masses of flowers that had been deposited in them&mdash;great
stately bouquets in lace or silver holders; lavish sprays; purple
and white arrangements shaped like anchors and inscribed "For
remembrance." And beside the flowers were piled cases of fruit and
delicacies, as well as other more endurable keepsakes: scent, and
fans, and cushions, and books. Nor were the children forgotten.
Over-excited, the despair of their nurses, Cuffy and his sisters
rushed to and fro, their arms full of wonderful new toys.</p>

<p>Said Mary in tears: "I think they're the dearest, kindest people
in all the world."</p>

<p>The last to leave the ship were Jerry, Tilly and Emmy. Emmy,
looking lovely as ever in her deep, becoming mourning, broke down
over the parting and cried bitterly. Mary&mdash;and Richard
too&mdash;would have liked to take the girl with them; both as a
companion for Mary, and in order that foreign travel might give a
fitting polish to John's eldest daughter. But Lizzie vehemently
opposed the plan. Nor was Emmy's own heart in it. For, since John's
death, she had taken upon herself the entire charge of her little
brother, heaping on his infant head all the love that had once been
her father's. Hence she could not tear herself away.</p>

<p>Jerry, a bank manager now, the father of a family, and hailing
from the township of Bummaroo, had stayed the night with them at
their hotel; and, John being no more, Mary had seized this chance
of unburdening herself to her staid, younger brother, of some of
the doubts that haunted her with regard to Richard's present
flighty management of his affairs. Bummaroo was not very far from
Ballarat; and Jerry promised indirectly to find out and keep her
informed of what was going on. "Don't worry, old girl. I can easily
run over from time to time and see how the land lies."</p>

<p>Tilly sat on the edge of a bunk and was very down in the mouth.
"Upon my word, Poll, I seem to feel it more this time than
last&mdash;which is just what a silly old Noah's Ark like me
<i>would</i> do, considering it was for always then, and here
you'll be back before the kids 'ave cut their second teeth."</p>

<p>But the last bell went; the ship was cleared, the ladder hauled
up; and all the din and bustle of weighing anchor began. The wind
being favourable, the Captain undertook to reach the "Heads" before
night; and he was as good as his word. They made a record voyage
down the Bay; and, catching the tide before it turned, headed
straight for the Bight. Mahony, in his old sea-mood of rare
expansiveness, went below to announce their whereabouts. But by
now, thanks to a freshening wind and the criss-cross motion of the
ship, all was confusion in the cabins. The Dumplings, very sick,
were being hurriedly undressed; Mary and the nurses staggered
about, their hands to their dizzy heads. Cuffy alone was
unconcerned: his father found him playing in the saloon, twirling
to and fro on one of the revolving chairs. Here was a chip of the
old block! Wrapping the child in a rug he bore him aloft, to watch
the passage through the "Rip."</p>

<p>Perched on a capstan, Cuffy followed the proceedings with a
lively interest, and to a running fire of questions. Why was the
sea so white and bubbly? Where was it running away to? What were
reefs? Why were light-houses? Why was a pilot? <i>How</i> did he
know? Why did he have such a big boat all to himself? Why didn't he
have a staircase? Did he have his own skin on under the oil? When
was the sea <i>shut?</i>...and many another. But gradually the
little voice ceased its piping and a silence fell&mdash;unnoticed
by Mahony, who himself was carried away once more by a splendid
inner exultation, at dancing in the open, leaving land behind. He
stood lost in his own feelings, till suddenly he felt the little
body his arm enclosed give a great shiver.</p>

<p>He looked down. "What is it, dear? Are you cold?"</p>

<p>But Cuffy just nestled closer into the crook of his father's arm
and did not reply. He had no words at his disposal to tell what he
felt at sight of nightfall on these wild, grey, desolate seas. Nor
did he dare to resolve the more actual fear of Cousin Josey's
implanting, and put the question that burned on his lips: "How far
is it to the bottom?"...For perhaps Papa did not know that was
where they were all sure to go.</p>

<p>"Come, it's long past bedtime."&mdash;And lifting the child from
his perch, Mahony carried him below.</p>

<p>In the gloom of the cabin the hanging-lamp swayed from side to
side, with a slow, rhythmical movement; timbers creaked and
groaned; from the pantries came the noise of shifting, slithering
china&mdash;sounds that were as music in Mahony's cars, telling as
they did of a voyage begun.</p>

<p>Mary turned a feeble head.</p>

<p>"Where <i>have</i> you been? The child will be perished. Well,
you'll have to see to him yourself now. We're all much too
ill."</p>

<p>And thereafter, between convulsive fits of retching, she heard
from the cabin opposite, where Mahony was undoing little buttons
and untying tapes, the voices of father and son raised in
unison:</p>

<p>Rocked in the cradle of the deep,<br>
I lay me down...in peace to sleep.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-9" id="ch-2-3-9"></a>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>The house they took for the winter was in Kensington Gore, and
the children walked every day with their nurses in Kensington
Gardens. When first they arrived, the great trees, with branches
that grew almost low enough to be pulled (if you jumped), were
thick with leaves, and shady like houses. Then the leaves tumbled
off and lay on the ground, and, when Nannan didn't see you, you
shuffled your feet through them, kicking up a dust and making a
noise like crackly paper. Afterwards, men brought brooms and swept
the leaves into heaps and burned them in little bonfires; and then
what fun it was to run like blind men, with eyes tight shut,
through the clouds of smoke. You trundled your hoop up and down
these paths, but didn't go far away, because you couldn't see where
they ended for mist; and Nannan said you might get lost, or fall
into a round pond. And one day a strange, thick, yellow mist came
down, and hid even the path you were walking on, and made your
throat tickle and your eyes sting; and Nannan and Eliza, talking
about pea-soup, rushed for home, feeling frightened, big as they
were, and having to be helped across the road by a policeman, who
made light with what Eliza said was a "bull's-eye."</p>

<p>After this, Cuffy got a cough and had to take tablespoonfuls of
cod-liver oil, and to stay indoors while the Dumplings walked. It
was dull work. The nursery was so high up that you couldn't see
anybody but trees from the windows, which were barred; and you were
not allowed to look out at all, if they were open. Nannan said
looking over made her poor old head dizzy; and she lived in fear of
seeing one of them "land on the pavement." So Cuffy hammered with
his knuckles on the panes, making tunes for himself, or beat them
out on his drum or xylophone, till Nannan, sewing by the fire, said
her poor old head was like to split.</p>

<p>Cuffy gave her his gravest attention. "Are you so <i>very</i>
old, Nannan?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, not so very," said Nannan with a queer laugh: she was
buxom, and in her prime.</p>

<p>"How old?"</p>

<p>"As old as my tongue and a little older than my teeth," was the
cryptic reply, which, far from ending the conversation, led on
through a tangle of question and answer&mdash;why tongues grew
before teeth, what made teeth, where they came from&mdash;to the
eternal wonder: "Was I born, too?" and "How?"</p>

<p>"A caution, that child, if ever there was one!" said Nannan, in
relating this "poser" and how she had queered it&mdash;"Only
<i>naughty</i> little boys ask things like that, Master
Cuffy!"&mdash;to Eliza and Ann over tea. This was drunk in a kind
of cubby-hole off the night nursery, the three colonials having
failed to fraternise with the posse of English servants who had
been taken over with the house: a set of prim, starched pokers
these, ran the verdict; and deceitful, too, with their "sirs" and
"madams" to your face, and all the sneery backbiting that went on
below-stairs.</p>

<p>In regard to Cuffy, however, Nannan's opinion was general: an
awkward child to deal with. You never knew what fresh fad was going
to get the whiphand of him. For instance his first fear, of Cousin
Josey's suggesting that they would all be drowned, which had preyed
on him during the voyage: this allayed, he was haunted by the dread
of being lost, or at least overlooked&mdash;like a bag or an
umbrella&mdash;in this great, strange, bewildering place. Even at
the pantomime at Drury Lane, he suffered torments lest, when it was
over, Nannan and Eliza should suddenly forget that he and the
Dumplings were there and go home without them; and from the close
of the first scene on, he inquired regularly every few minutes
throughout the afternoon: "Is this the end?" till Nannan's patience
gave way, and she roundly declared that never would she bring him
to a theatre again. It was the same at Madame Tussaud's&mdash;the
same, plus an antipathy that amounted to a horror of all these
waxen people with their fixed, glassy eyes; and a fantastic fear
that he might be mistaken for one of them and locked in among them,
did he not keep perpetually on the move. His hot little hand tugged
mercilessly at Eliza's baggy glove. Yes! more bother than half a
dozen children put together. Just a walking bundle, said Nannan, of
whims and crotchets.</p>

<p>Chief of these, and most tiresome of all, was the idea that he
could not&mdash;or must not&mdash;sleep of a night, as long as his
father and mother were out. Did they attend an evening party, he
tossed restless till their return. And if in spite of himself he
dozed off, it was only to start up with the cry: "Is my Papa and
Mamma come home yet?" Nannan was at her wits' end what to do with
him; and more than once boldly transgressed her instructions about
absolute truth in the nursery. For it was not as if Master Cuffy
really wanted his parents, or even wanted to see them. No sooner
did he know they were back, under the same roof with him again,
than he turned over and slept like a top.</p>

<p>The mischief was: they were out almost every night. For, in
violent contrast to the hermit's life he had been leading, Mahony
was now never happy unless he was on the go. An itch for
distraction plagued him; books and solitude had lost their charm;
and an evening spent in his own society, in this large, dark,
heavily furnished house, sent his spirits down to zero. They had
brought many an excellent letter of introduction with them; a
carriage-and-pair stood at their disposal; and so, except for an
occasional party of their own, they went out night after night, to
dinners, balls and card-parties; to soirees, conversaziones and
lectures; to concerts and plays. They heard Tietjens sing, and
Nilsson, and Ilma di Murska; Adelina Patti with Nicolini; and a
host of lesser stars. Richard said they must make the most of their
time; since it was unlikely they would ever be on this side of the
world again. To which, however, Mary now secretly demurred: or not
till the children are grown up. For, though foreign travel meant
little to her, she was already determined that her children should
not miss it&mdash;it, or anything else in life that was worth
having.</p>

<p>In the beginning, she was heartily glad of the change in
Richard's habits, and followed him without a grumble wherever he
wished: he wouldn't budge a step without her. But, as week after
week went by, she did occasionally long for an hour to herself; to
prowl round the shops; see something of the children; write her
letters in peace. As things stood, it was a ceaseless rush from one
entertainment to another, not to mention all the dressing and
re-dressing this implied. Done, too, with Richard standing
irritable and impatient in the hall, watch in hand, calling: "Now
<i>do</i> come along, Mary!&mdash;can't you hear, my dear? We shall
certainly be late."</p>

<p>She comforted herself with the thought that it was not for long:
they had taken the house only for a twelvemonth; and there was
talk, as soon as the weather improved, of a trip to Ireland to see
Richard's sisters, and to the Midlands to visit Lisby, now
Headmistress of a Young Ladies' Seminary. So, in the meantime, Mary
went without her tea to sit through interminable political debates;
or struggled to keep her eyes open at meetings of learned
societies, where old greybeards droned on by the hour, without you
being able to hear the half of what they said. "I suppose it does
<i>somebody</i> some good!" thought she. Richard, for instance, who
had read so many clever books and enjoyed teasing his brains.
Herself, she felt a very fish out of water.</p>

<p>Nowhere more so than at the spiritualist seances, which, for
peace' sake&mdash;and also because everybody was doing it&mdash;she
now regularly attended. London was permeated with spiritualism; you
hardly met a person who was not a convert to the craze. The famous
medium Home had already retired, on his marriage, into private
life, much to Richard's disappointment, but he had left scores of
imitators behind, who were only too well versed in his tricks and
stratagems. The miracles you could see performed! Through the
ceiling came apports of fresh flowers with the dew on them, or
roots with the soil still clinging; great dinner-tables rose from
the floor; lights flitted; apparitions appeared, spoke to you, took
you by the hand. But nothing that happened could shake Mary's
convinced unbelief. She was of those who maintained that so-called
"levitation" was achieved by standing on your toes; the "fire-test"
by your having previously applied chemicals to the palm of your
hand; while the spirits that walked about were just so much drapery
on a broomstick. And it invariably riled her anew, to see Richard
sitting solemnly accepting all this nonsense as if it heralded a
new revelation. Of course, many clever men besides him were the
dupes of their own imagination. Learning and common sense did not
seem to go together. <i>She</i> preferred, thank you, to trust the
evidence of her own eyes and ears.</p>

<p>However, she kept these thoughts to herself, patiently doing all
that was required of her in the way of linking hands in dark rooms,
hymn-singing and the rest, with only an occasional silent chuckle
at the antics of the believers. But then came an evening when
circumstances forced her hand. Well, yes...that was partly true.
They were at a sitting with a medium of whom she had long had her
doubts; and, on this night, the evidence for fraud seemed to her so
glaring that she determined to put it to the test. For once,
Richard was not beside her. Instead, on her right, she had a lady
who fell into raptures at each fresh proof of the "dear spirits'"
presence. Stealthily bringing her two hands together (as Tilly had
long ago instructed her), Mary freed one from this person's hold;
and, when "spirit-touches" were again proclaimed by her neighbour
(they never visited <i>her!</i>) she made a grab, and just as she
expected, found the medium easily recognisable by her
bulk&mdash;crouched on her knees inside the circle, with a long
feather whisk in her hand. In the dark, and in utter silence, a
struggle went on between them, she holding fast, the medium
wriggling this way and that, and ultimately, by lying almost flat
on the floor, contriving to wrench herself free. Not a word did
Mary say. But at the end, when the lights were turned up, it was
announced that the "spirits" complained of an unsympathetic
presence in the circle; and after some hocus-pocus with
slate-writing, etc., she, Mary, was designated and asked to
withdraw.</p>

<p>Richard, pale and extremely haughty, made the best of the
situation in face of all these strangers, none of whom but eyed
Mary as if she were a moral pariah. Inwardly he was raging; and he
freely vented his anger in the carriage going home.</p>

<p>"There you have it! Your mulish obstinacy...your intolerable
lack of imagination...your narrow, preconceived notions of what can
and cannot happen!" Till Mary, too, lost her temper, and blurted
out the plain facts of the case. "I knew her by her figure. What's
more, I distinctly felt the big wart she has on the side of her
chin."</p>

<p>But with this, it seemed, she merely displayed her ignorance.
For the spirit body, in manifestation, was but the ethereal shadow
cast by the physical, and its perfect duplicate. Richard also went
on to crush her with St. Paul's "terrestrial and celestial";
harangued her on the astounding knowledge of the occult possessed
by the early Christians. It was no good talking. Everything she
said could be turned against her.</p>

<p>As she brushed her hair for the night, however, she could not
resist remarking, in a final tone: "Well! all I know is, if these
really <i>are</i> spirits who come back, it doesn't make me think
much of heaven. That the dead can still take an interest in such
silly, footling things!"</p>

<p>"Quite so, my dear. You keep your traditional fancy picture of
semi-birds and harps and crowns. It best suits a mind like yours to
make its heaven as remote and unreal as possible. For the truth is,
you no more believe in it than you do in the tale of
Cinderella."</p>

<p>"<i>Really</i>, Richard!...what next, I wonder?&mdash;Though I
must say, I don't think there's much to choose between harps and
things, and playing concertinas and tilting tables. One's as stupid
as the other."</p>

<p>"Well, how else...can you perhaps suggest a better way for a
discarnate being to make its presence known? Every beginning is
crude&mdash;and always has been. Though, for that matter, what is
the Morse alphabet they use on the electric telegraph, but a series
of transmitted raps?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not clever enough to argue about these things. But I
know this: if I go to heaven, I hope at least to find there'll be
something something really useful&mdash;<i>to do</i>."</p>

<p>But when the light was out and they lay composing themselves for
sleep, she heard Richard mutter to himself: "There may be...there
probably <i>is</i>...fraud. And why not?...do not rogues ofttimes
preach the gospel? But that there's truth in it&mdash;a truth
greater than any yet dreamed of&mdash;on that I would stake my
soul. Ours the spadework...God alone knows what the end will
be."</p>

<p>The result of this affair was that Mary no longer frequented
seances. On such nights Richard went out alone, and she sat
comfortably by the fire, her feet on the fender, her needlework or
the children at hand.</p>

<p>But not for long. As suddenly as Richard had thrown himself into
the whirl, so suddenly he tired of it, and at the first hint of
spring&mdash;it was early February; birds had begun to twitter in
the parks, the spikes of the golden crocus to push up through the
grass, and Richard petulantly to discard his greatcoat&mdash;on one
of these palely sunny days he came home restless to the
finger-tips, and before the evening ended was proposing to start,
then and there, for the Continent. Why should they not shut up the
house, send the children to the seaside, and jaunt off by
themselves, hampered only by the lightest of luggage, and moving
from place to place as their fancy led them?</p>

<p>Why not? There was, nowadays, no practical reason why he should
scruple to satisfy any and every whim. And so his roughly sketched
plan was carried out. With the sole difference that they took Cuffy
with them. For, as soon as Nannan heard what was in the wind, she
marched downstairs and said bluntly, she did not choose to shoulder
the entire charge of Master Cuffy. The child was anyhow but poorly,
what with the colds and things he had had since getting here; a
walking mass of the fidgets besides; and if now his papa and mamma
were going away as well, she guaranteed he'd worry himself, and
everybody else, into a nervous fever. Mahony cut short the argument
that followed by saying curtly: "We'll take the youngster with us,"
and pooh-poohed Mary's notion that travelling would be bad for the
child. Much less harmful, said he, than staying behind and fretting
his heart out. Besides, Ann would be there. Ann could look after
him.</p>

<p>And so it came about that Cuffy journeyed in foreign parts,
bearing with him, snail-like, all that stood to him for home.</p>

<p>Of these early travels, the most vivid memory he retained was,
oddly enough, the trifling one of being wrapped in an opossum-rug
and carried in some one's arms from a train to a ship, and back to
a train. But in those buried depths of his mind to which he had
normally no access, a whole galaxy of pictures lay stored; and,
throughout his life, was the hidden spring that released them
touched, one and another would abruptly flash into consciousness.
As a small boy they put him in many an awkward fix; for he could
never prove what he said, or even make it sound probable; and, at
school, among companions whose horizon was bounded north, south,
east and west by the bush, they harvested him a lively crop of
ridicule and opprobrium. ("A tarnation liar...that young Cuffs
<i>Mahony!</i>") But there <i>were</i> houses built in
water&mdash;somehow he knew it&mdash;and bridges with shops on
them. Boats with hoods, too, and men who stood up in them to row
with a single oar. There <i>was</i> a statue so big that you could
climb into its nose and sit there, and look out of its eyes:
rivers, not red and muddy but apple green; a tower that leaned
right over to one side; long-legged birds that built their nests on
chimney-tops.&mdash;But then again, on the heel of such bold
assertions, a sudden doubt would invade the speaker; a doubt
whether he had not, after all, only <i>dreamt</i> these things.
With no one to whom he could turn for confirmation, with every
object that related to them lost or destroyed, Cuffy, throughout
his later boyhood, swung like a pendulum between fact and dream,
and was sadly torn in consequence.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-10" id="ch-2-3-10"></a>Chapter X</h3>

<p>Travelling from Dover to Calais and thence to Paris, the party
set off on what, in thought, Mary ever after dubbed: "that mad race
across Europe."</p>

<p>For, the Channel behind them, Richard's restlessness broke out
in a new form: it seemed impossible for him to be content in any
place they visited for more than a day or two on end. In vain did
Mary protest: "But, Richard, we're not seeing anything!" Within a
few hours of his arrival in a town, he had had enough of it, sucked
it dry; and was fidgeting to be off to the next on their line of
route. Nor was this itch for movement all. The strange food did not
suit him: he either liked it too well and ate too heartily of it,
or turned from it altogether. Then the noisiness of foreign
cities&mdash;the cobbled streets, the rattling of the loosely hung
vehicles, the loud foreign voices, the singing, the
tambourining&mdash;got on his nerves, and, together with the
unshaded windows of hotel bedrooms, kept him awake half the night:
him spoilt, for how many a year, by the perfectly darkened sashes,
the ordered silence of his sleeping-room at "Ultima Thule." And all
the beauties in the world could not make up to Richard for lack of
sleep. Or, to turn it round: rob him of his sleep, and you robbed
him of all power to enjoy fine scenery or handsome monuments. And
so they sometimes arrived at a place and left it again, without
having really seen very much more of it than the four walls of a
room.</p>

<p>Before they had got any distance, it became clear to Mary that
Richard's travelling-days were...well, one could hardly say over,
when they had only just begun. The truth was, they had come too
late. He was no longer able to enjoy them.</p>

<p>It was not the physical discomforts alone that defeated him. The
fancies he went in for, as soon as he set foot on foreign soil,
made his life a misery to him. In Paris, for instance, he was
seized by a nervous fear of the street traffic; actually felt
afraid he was going to be run over. If he had to cross one of the
vast squares, over which vehicles dashed from all directions, he
would stand and hesitate on the kerb, looking from side to side,
unable to resolve to take the plunge; and wasn't he angry with her,
if she tried to make a dash for it! His own fears rendered him
fussy about Cuffy and the maid's safety, too. He wouldn't hear of
them going out alone; and insisted every morning on shepherding
them to their walk in the Public Gardens. If he was prevented, they
must drive there in a <i>fiacre</i>. Which all helped to make the
stay in Paris both troublesome and costly. Then there was that time
in Strasbourg, when they set out to climb the tower of the
cathedral. It was certainly a bad day to choose, for it had rained
in the night and afterwards frozen over, and even the streets were
slippery. But Richard was bent on seeing the Rhine, and the Vosges,
and the Black Forest from the top of the steeple; so up they went.
As far as the platform, it was plain sailing. But on the tower
proper, when they were mounting the innumerable stone
steps&mdash;all glassy with ice, and very tricky to keep a footing
on&mdash;which led to the spire, he turned pale, and confessed to
giddiness...it was true you looked through the wide-open stonework
right down to the street below, where people crawled like ants. And
after another bend in the stair, he clinging fast to the iron
hand-rail, he had ignominiously to give in and descend again:
backwards, too! "I felt I should either fall through one of the
openings or throw myself out. Great heights are evidently not for
me."</p>

<p>And this was not wholly due to imagination. For, after going up
the Leaning Tower of Pisa and taking a peep over the side, he felt
so sick on reaching the ground that he had to go back to the hotel
and lie down.</p>

<p>Again a beautiful city like Munich was ruined for him, by the
all-pervading smell of malt from its many breweries. The whole time
they were there he went about with his nose in the air, sniffing;
and he never ceased to grumble. Next, as the Tyrolese mountains
were so close, they took train and went in among them; but this
didn't suit him either. The nearness of these drear, dark masses
wakened in him, he said, an overpowering sense of oppression; made
him feel as if he <i>must</i> climb them; get to their summits in
order to be able to breathe. One moment abjuring heights, another
hankering after them!...who could keep pace with such
inconsistencies?</p>

<p>Of course there were times when he smiled at himself; saw the
humour of the situation; especially when he had just escaped from
one of his bugbears. But then came the next (he was never prepared
for them) and hit him equally hard. The thing he <i>couldn't</i>
laugh at was his&mdash;their&mdash;"infernal ignorance of foreign
lingos." Not to be able to express himself properly, make himself
fully understood, riled and fretted him; though less, perhaps, than
did her loud and unabashed efforts to say what she wanted. And
because he couldn't argue, or expostulate, with porters, waiters,
cabbies and the like, he constantly suspected these people of
trying to do him. The queer thing was, he preferred being diddled,
putting up with it in gloomy silence, to trying, in broken French,
German or Italian, to call the cheats to account. Many an extra
franc and taler and lira did this hypersensitiveness cost him. But
his dread of being laughed at was stronger than himself.</p>

<p>Yes! there was always something. He never let himself have any
real peace or enjoyment. Or so thought Mary at the time. It was not
till afterwards, when he fell to re-living his travels in memory,
that she learned how great was the pleasure he had got out of them.
Inconveniences and annoyances were by then sunk below the horizon.
Above, remained visions of white cities, and slender towers, and
vine-clad hills; of olive groves bedded in violets; fine music
heard in opera and oratorio; coffee-drinking in shady gardens on
the banks of a lake; orchards of pink almond-blossom massed against
the misty blue of far mountain valley.</p>

<p>Of all the towns they touched, even including Naples and Rome,
Venice suited him best; and this, she firmly believed, because he
went there with the idea that, having neither streets nor wheeled
traffic, it must of necessity be a quiet and restful place. Herself
she noticed nothing of this. Dozens of people walked the narrow
alleys&mdash;you could really go everywhere on foot&mdash;and the
cries of the gondoliers, the singing and mandoline-playing lasted
far into the night. But Richard throve on it; though it was June
now, and very hot, and alive with mosquitoes. He bathed daily on
the Lido, and for the rest of the day kept cool in
picture-galleries and churches, of which he never seemed to tire.
Whereas she, after half an hour of screwing up her eyes and craning
her neck at ceilings, had had more than enough.</p>

<p>They had been there for a whole fortnight, and there was still
no talk of their moving on, when something happened which cut their
stay through as with a knife. The smallest details of that July
afternoon&mdash;it started with one of Cuffy's outbreaks&mdash;were
burnt into Mary's brain.</p>

<p>Richard had gone after lunch to the British Consul's, to fetch
their Australian mail: Mary was anxiously waiting for news of the
birth of Tilly's child. She wrote at her own home budget while
expecting his return, sitting in the cool hotel bedroom with Cuffy
playing on the floor beside her. Deep in her letter, she did not
notice that the child had strayed to the balcony. How long he had
been there, still as a mouse, she did not know; but she was
suddenly startled by hearing him give a shrill cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, no...<i>no</i>!"</p>

<p>Laying down her pen, she stepped through the window. "What's the
matter with <i>you?</i>"</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the canal some men were engaged in
drowning a puppy. They had tied a weight to the little animal's
neck before throwing it into the water, but this was not heavy
enough to keep it down; and again and again, in a desperate
struggle for breath, it fought its way to the surface, only to be
hit at with sticks did it come within arm's reach. Finally, amid
the laughter of the crowd, the flat side of an oar caught it full
on its little panting snout and terrified eyes. With a shriek that
was almost human, it sank, not to rise again.</p>

<p>"Run inside, Cuffy. Don't stay here watching those nasty cruel
men," said Mary, and took him by the arm. But Cuffy tore it away
and remained standing with dilated eyes and open lips, breathing
rapidly. The last blow struck, he burst into a passion of tears
and, running to a corner of the room, threw himself face downwards
on the floor.</p>

<p>There followed one of those dreadful exhibitions of rage or
temper which Mary found it so hard to reconcile with her little
son's usual docility. Cuffy kicked and screamed and wouldn't be
touched, like the naughtiest of children; and at the same time was
shaken from head to foot by sobs about which there was nothing
childish.</p>

<p>She was still bending over him, still remonstrating, when the
door opened and Richard came in. One glance at his face was enough
to make her forget Cuffy and spring to her feet.</p>

<p>"Richard! Why, my dear...why, <i>whatever</i> is the matter?"
For he had gone out, not an hour earlier, in the best of spirits;
and here he came back white as a ghost, with dazed-looking eyes and
shuffling feet. "Are you ill? Has the sun...?"</p>

<p>Midway in a sob Cuffy stopped to listen...held his breath.</p>

<p>Pouring himself out a glass of water and spilling it as he
poured, Richard drank, in a series of gulps. Then, from a bundle of
newspapers and letters he was carrying, he drew forth a folded
sheet and handed it to Mary.</p>

<p>"Read this."</p>

<p>In deep apprehension she took the paper. As she read she, too,
went pale. It was a telegram from Jerry, forwarded by their London
banker, and ran: RETURN IMMEDIATELY. MOST URGENT. WILDING ABSCONDED
AMERICA.</p>

<p>Mary could not all at once take in the full sense of the
words.</p>

<p>"But how...what does it mean, Richard? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Mean? Ruin, I suppose. In all probability I am a ruined man."
And dropping heavily on a chair, Mahony buried his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>Cuffy sat up, and peeped furtively at his father and mother,
with round eyes.</p>

<p>"Ruin? But how?...why? Oh dear, <i>can't</i> you speak? No, no,
Richard! What are you thinking of? Remember the child." From under
his hands tears were dripping on the table.&mdash;"Go to Ann,
Cuffy. She shall take you out or give you your tea. Run away,
dear...quickly!&mdash;Now, Richard, pull yourself together. It's no
good breaking down. <i>What</i> has happened? What do you intend to
do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what am I to do? Oh, help me, help me, Mary!"</p>

<p>"Of course, dear, of course I will."</p>

<p>Stifling her own alarm, Mary sat down at his side and took his
hand in hers. It was plain he had had a severe shock. He admitted
as much himself: the thing had come so suddenly. He told how, out
of the dazzling sunshine he had stepped into the cool office at the
consulate, had passed the time of day with a clerk, had been
chatting with the fellow when the telegram was handed him.</p>

<p>"This has just come for you, sir. I was about to send it on to
your hotel."</p>

<p>Yes, he had not even stopped talking as he tore it open. The
next moment the room had started to swing round him; he had been
obliged to take a seat, every one staring at him, eyeing him
askance. How he managed to get out of the place and home, he didn't
know. His mind seemed to have escaped control: felt like a child's
puzzle that had been rudely jolted into hundreds of pieces, and had
now all to be re-set. "Which I don't feel equal to, Mary&mdash;and
that's the truth. Something seems to have broken inside me."</p>

<p>Oh, how like a bad dream, the remainder of that day! For the
practical side of the matter could not wait&mdash;not for a single
hour. Richard half-way restored to composure, they had to set to
work in cold blood to discuss the situation. It was clear to both
that he must return to Melbourne with the least possible delay.
Till then, he would not know how he stood. Things might not, urged
Mary, be quite so black as they looked at first glance, Wilding's
absence yet prove capable of a rational explanation. But Richard,
she could see, feared the worst...had no real hope of this. (And in
her heart even she thought the tone of Jerry's message belied it.
Oh, where would they have been, had she not had that private confab
with Jerry the night before sailing!) No, the conclusion Richard
had jumped to at first reading, he still maintained: after the
fashion of many a dishonest broker, Wilding had sold the scrip he
held from his clients and bolted with the proceeds. Now, the only
question was: what was left; what could be saved from the
wreck.&mdash;A mail steamer was due to leave Venice some time
during the week; and on this Richard must, if humanly possible,
secure a berth. And the rest of the day passed in running from
wharf to agent, from consul to banker. The money question had also
to be gone into: what he still had in hand; how much remained on
his letters of credit; what balance lay in the London bank. Then
they had to think of the furniture, the curios and pictures they
had bought on their travels, and sent back to England. The London
house would have to be got rid of; the servants paid off, and so
on. Before evening Mary's brain was reeling with all the details it
was necessary for her to take in. But this rush and flurry was
exactly what Richard needed. And she kept him at it, kept him on
the go till late at night, with the result that he went to bed
dog-tired&mdash;too worn out to think.</p>

<p>But he had hardly dozed off, when they were roused by Cuffy
starting up in his sleep, screaming: "No, no!...don't hit him...oh,
<i>Doggy!</i>"</p>

<p>Hastily informed what had happened, Mahony struck a light and
rose; and forgetting himself over a trouble even more pressing than
his own, he lifted Cuffy out of bed and set him on his knee There
he talked to him as, thought Mary, only Richard could talk. He went
through the scene of the afternoon, made the child, amid tears and
frantic sobs, live through it afresh; then fell to work to dispel
the brooding horror that lay over it. Such things as this were
often to be met with in life; Cuffy must be a brave little man and
face them squarely. Somehow, they all fitted into a great scheme on
God's part, which our poor brains were too puny to understand. To
be pitied was not only poor doggy, whose struggles had soon ceased,
but also the men who could act so cruelly towards their little
brother&mdash;no less a brother because he had not the gift of
speech. Cuffy must try to feel sorry for them, too; they had
probably never had any one to teach them the difference between
right and wrong. And he must make up for their want of love, by
being doubly kind himself to all dumb creatures.&mdash;And so on
and on, in a quiet, soothing voice, till the child's terror was
allayed and he slept, his arms clasped like a vice round his
father's neck.</p>

<p>Forty-eight hours later Richard, with for luggage a single
portmanteau, boarded the Overland Mail for Egypt&mdash;and thus
ended a two days' nightmare in which he had never ceased to torture
himself with the bitterest reproaches. "It is all my fault...my own
fault...I alone am to blame. If <i>only</i> I had not been so
headstrong...had listened to you!" The last glimpse Mary had of him
showed him standing at the taffrail of the tender that carried
passengers to the steamer; standing very erect, and even making a
brave attempt to smile, as he waved his hat in farewell; for, when
the time came, his chief thought was of her, and how he could ease
the parting.</p>

<p>Till now Mary had kept up; had had, indeed, not a moment to
think of herself, so busy had she been consoling, supporting,
encouraging. But now that everything was over and she sat alone in
the hotel bedroom, all she had gone through, all the conflicting
emotions of these two past days&mdash;not the least of which were
self-reproaches every whit as bitter as Richard's own&mdash;took
toll of her. Behind locked doors she broke down and wept
bitterly.</p>

<p>The thought of her coming loneliness appalled her. For over
twenty years she had never been absent from Richard for more than a
few weeks at a time...had never been parted from him by more than a
couple of hundred miles. Now, this violent abrupt separation, with
all the seas between, made her feel as if she had been roughly torn
in two. For months and months to come she would have no one to lean
on, no one to consult&mdash;oh, <i>What</i> if one of the children
should fall ill and Richard not be there? She also shrank, with the
timidity of unuse, from the prospect of having to emerge from her
womanly seclusion and rub shoulders with the world. Her work had
invariably been carried on in the background. When it came to a
personal contact with business and business people, Richard had
always been there, to step forward and bear the brunt. Now she, who
had travelled but the briefest of distances unescorted, was called
on to undertake by herself, not only the far journey across the
Continent, but the infinitely more trying one of a two to three
months' sea-voyage round the Cape. And until she got on board! To
be faced, before that, were railway officials, porters,
house-agents, shipping companies, bankers; the drawing of cheques
and the paying of bills; the dismissing of servants; the packing
and transport of baggage and furniture, the embarking, the long,
long voyage with but one nurse for the children, and nobody at all
to look after her. But hardest of anything was the knowledge that
she would have to remain in her present state of ignorance and
uncertainty, knowing nothing of what had actually happened, or of
how Richard was bearing up, and whether he was well or ill, until
she herself landed in Melbourne more than six months hence.</p>

<p>But the barest hint of illness in connection with Richard was
enough to make her mind swerve, with a sudden jerk, from herself
and her own troubles, to him. Desperately as she would miss him,
and need him, yet she had small doubt&mdash;something within told
her so&mdash;that, when she stood face to face with things, she
would contrive to get on somehow. But he!&mdash;how would he ever
manage without her?...to nerve him and to soothe him, and to listen
to his outpourings&mdash;away from her, he quite literally would
not have a soul to speak to. She saw him on the outward voyage,
eternally pacing the deck, a prey to blackest anxiety&mdash;and the
last thought of self went under, in a fierce uprush of pity for
him, so solitary, so self&mdash;centred, so self-tormented. Oh,
that he might be spared the worst! He was old for his age; much too
old to have to begin life afresh&mdash;life which, with every
caprice satisfied, had yet become so hard for him: an hourly tussle
with flimsy, immaterial phantoms, whose existence other people
never so much as dreamed of. And to know him pinched for money
again, going short, denying himself, fretting over the straits to
which he had brought her and the children...no! Mary felt there was
nothing, absolutely nothing she would not do, to help him, to spare
him.</p>

<p>Well!...sitting crying wasn't the way to begin. That was a
fool's job. She must just set her teeth and make the best of
things&mdash;separation, uncertainty,
responsibility&mdash;endeavouring, when it came to business, to
stand her ground, even though she was but an inexperienced woman.
And as a first step she got up, dried her eyes, and bathed her
face. After which she had trunks and saratogas brought out, and
fell to packing.</p>

<p>But more and more, as the day wore on, did a single thought take
possession of her&mdash;and, in this thought, Mary came as near as
she ever would, to a conscious reflection on the aim and end of
existence. It began with her suddenly becoming aware how she longed
to hug her babies to her again, and how much she had missed them; a
feeling until now resolutely repressed...for Richard's sake. Now,
as, in imagination, she gathered her little ones to her
heart&mdash;and gathered Richard with them, he, too, just an adored
and absent child&mdash;it came over her like a flash that, amid
life's ups and downs, to be able to keep one's little flock about
one, to know one's dearest human relationships safe and unharmed,
was, in good truth, all that signified. Compared with this,
hardships and misfortune weighed no more than feathers in the
balance.</p>

<p>"As long as we can be together...as long as I have him and my
children...nothing really matters. I can bear anything...put up
with anything...if only they are spared me!"</p>
