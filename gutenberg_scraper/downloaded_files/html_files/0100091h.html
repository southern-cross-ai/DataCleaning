<h1><a name="ch-1-0-0" id="ch-1-0-0"></a>BOOK I<br>
AUSTRALIA FELIX</h1>

<hr>

<h2>PROEM</h2>

<p>In a shaft on the Gravel Pits, a man had been buried alive. At
work in a deep wet hole, he had recklessly omitted to slab the
walls of a drive; uprights and tailors yielded under the lateral
pressure, and the rotten earth collapsed, bringing down the roof in
its train. The digger fell forward on his face, his ribs jammed
across his pick, his arms pinned to his sides, nose and mouth
pressed into the sticky mud as into a mask; and over his
defenceless body, with a roar that burst his ear-drums, broke
stupendous masses of earth.</p>

<p>His mates at the windlass went staggering back from the belch of
violently discharged air: it tore the wind-sail to strips, sent
stones and gravel flying, loosened planks and props. Their shouts
drawing no response, the younger and nimbler of the two&mdash;he
was a mere boy, for all his amazing growth of beard&mdash;put his
foot in the bucket and went down on the rope, kicking off the sides
of the shaft with his free foot. A group of diggers, gathering
round the pit-head, waited for the tug at the rope. It was quick in
coming; and the lad was hauled to the surface. No hope: both drives
had fallen in; the bottom of the shaft was blocked. The crowd
melted with a "Poor Bill&mdash;God rest his soul!" or with a silent
shrug. Such accidents were not infrequent; each man might thank his
stars it was not he who lay cooling down below. And so, since no
more washdirt would be raised from this hole, the party that worked
it made off for the nearest grog-shop, to wet their throats to the
memory of the dead, and to discuss future plans.</p>

<p>All but one: a lean and haggard-looking man of some five and
forty, who was known to his comrades as Long Jim. On hearing his
mate's report he had sunk heavily down on a log, and there he sat,
a pannikin of raw spirit in his hand, the tears coursing ruts down
cheeks scabby with yellow mud, his eyes glassy as marbles with
those that had still to fall.</p>

<p>He wept, not for the dead man, but for himself. This accident
was the last link in a chain of ill-luck that had been forging ever
since he first followed the diggings. He only needed to put his
hand to a thing, and luck deserted it. In all the sinkings he had
been connected with, he had not once caught his pick in a nugget or
got the run of the gutter; the "bottoms" had always proved barren,
drives been exhausted without his raising the colour. At the
present claim he and his mates had toiled for months, overcoming
one difficulty after another. The slabbing, for instance, had cost
them infinite trouble; it was roughly done, too, and, even after
the pins were in, great flakes of earth would come tumbling down
from between the joints, on one occasion nearly knocking silly the
man who was below. Then, before they had slabbed a depth of three
times nine, they had got into water, and in this they worked for
the next sixty feet. They were barely rid of it, when the two
adjoining claims were abandoned, and in came the flood
again&mdash;this time they had to fly for their lives before it, so
rapid was its rise. Not the strongest man could stand in this
ice-cold water for more than three days on end&mdash;the bark slabs
stank in it, too, like the skins in a tanner's yard&mdash;and they
had been forced to quit work till it subsided. He and another man
had gone to the hills, to hew trees for more slabs; the rest to the
grog-shop. From there, when it was feasible to make a fresh start,
they had to be dragged, some blind drunk, the rest blind stupid
from their booze. That had been the hardest job of any: keeping the
party together. They had only been eight in all&mdash;a
hand-to-mouth number for a deep wet hole. Then, one had died of
dysentery, contracted from working constantly in water up to his
middle; another had been nabbed in a manhunt and clapped into the
"logs." And finally, but a day or two back, the three men who
completed the nightshift had deserted for a new "rush" to the
Avoca. Now, his pal had gone, too. There was nothing left for him,
Long Jim, to do, but to take his dish and turn fossicker; or even
to aim no higher than washing over the tailings rejected by the
fossicker.</p>

<p>At the thought his tears flowed anew. He cursed the day on which
he had first set foot on Ballarat.</p>

<p>"It's 'ell for white men&mdash;'ell, that's what it is!"</p>

<p>"'Ere, 'ave another drink, matey, and fergit yer bloody
troubles."</p>

<p>His re-filled pannikin drained, he grew warmer round the heart;
and sang the praises of his former life. He had been a lamplighter
in the old country, and for many years had known no more arduous
task than that of tramping round certain streets three times daily,
ladder on shoulder, bitch at heel, to attend the little flames that
helped to dispel the London dark. And he might have jogged on at
this up to three score years and ten, had he never lent an ear to
the tales that were being told of a wonderful country, where, for
the mere act of stooping, and with your naked hand, you could pick
up a fortune from the ground. Might the rogues who had spread these
lies be damned to all eternity! Then, he had swallowed them only
too willingly; and, leaving the old woman wringing her hands, had
taken every farthing of his savings and set sail for Australia.
That was close on three years ago. For all he knew, his wife might
be dead and buried by this time; or sitting in the almshouse. She
could not write, and only in the early days had an occasional
newspaper reached him, on which, alongside the Queen's head, she
had put the mark they had agreed on, to show that she was still
alive. He would probably never see her again, but would end his
days where he was. Well, they wouldn't be many; this was not a
place that made old bones. And, as he sat, worked on by grief and
liquor, he was seized by a desperate homesickness for the old
country. Why had he ever been fool enough to leave it? He shut his
eyes, and all the well-known sights and sounds of the familiar
streets came back to him. He saw himself on his rounds of a
winter's afternoon, when each lamp had a halo in the foggy air;
heard the pit-pat of his four-footer behind him, the bump of the
ladder against the prong of the lamp-post. His friend the
policeman's glazed stovepipe shone out at the corner; from the
distance came the tinkle of the muffin-man's bell, the cries of the
buy-a-brooms. He remembered the glowing charcoal in the stoves of
the chestnut and potato sellers; the appetising smell of the
cooked-fish shops; the fragrant steam of the hot, dark coffee at
the twopenny stall, when he had turned shivering out of bed; he
sighed for the lights and jollity of the "Hare and Hounds" on a
Saturday night. He would never see anything of the kind again. No;
here, under bare blue skies, out of which the sun frizzled you
alive; here, where it couldn't rain without at once being a flood;
where the very winds blew contrarily, hot from the north and
bitter-chill from the south; where, no matter how great the heat by
day, the night would as likely as not be nipping cold: here he was
doomed to end his life, and to end it, for all the yellow sunshine,
more hopelessly knotted and gnarled with rheumatism than if, dawn
after dawn, he had gone out in a cutting north-easter, or groped
his way through the grey fog-mists sent up by grey Thames.</p>

<p>Thus he sat and brooded, all the hatred of the unwilling exile
for the land that gives him house-room burning in his breast.</p>

<p>Who the man was, who now lay deep in a grave that fitted him as
a glove fits the hand, careless of the pass to which he had brought
his mate; who this really was, Long Jim knew no more than the rest.
Young Bill had never spoken out. They had chummed together on the
seventy-odd-mile tramp from Melbourne; had boiled a common billy
and slept side by side in rain-soaked blankets, under the scanty
hair of a she-oak. That was in the days of the first great stampede
to the goldfields, when the embryo seaports were as empty as though
they were plague-ridden, and every man who had the use of his legs
was on the wide bush-track, bound for the north. It was better to
be two than one in this medley of bullock-teams, lorries, carts and
pack-horses, of dog-teams, wheelbarrows and swagmen, where the air
rang with oaths, shouts and hammering hoofs, with whip-cracking and
bullock-prodding; in this hurly-burly of thieves, bushrangers and
foreigners, of drunken convicts and deserting sailors, of slit-eyed
Chinese and apt-handed Lascars, of expirees and ticket-of-leave
men, of Jews, Turks and other infidels. Long Jim, himself stunned
by it all: by the pother of landing and of finding a roof to cover
him; by the ruinous price of bare necessaries; by the length of
this unheard-of walk that lay before his town-bred feet: Long Jim
had gladly accepted the young man's company on the road.
Originally, for no more than this; at heart he distrusted Young
Bill, because of his fine-gentleman airs, and intended shaking the
lad off as soon as they reached the diggings. There, a man must,
for safety's sake, be alone, when he stooped to pick up his
fortune. But at first sight of the strange, wild scene that met his
eyes he hastily changed his mind. And so the two of them had stuck
together; and he had never had cause to regret it. For all his
lily-white hands and finical speech Young Bill had worked like a
nigger, standing by his mate through the latter's disasters; had
worked till the ladyish hands were horny with warts and corns, and
this, though he was doubled up with dysentery in the hot season,
and racked by winter cramps. But the life had proved too hard for
him, all the same. During the previous summer he had begun to
drink&mdash;steadily, with the dogged persistence that was in
him&mdash;and since then his work had gone downhill. His sudden
death had only been a hastening-on of the inevitable. Staggering
home to the tent after nightfall he would have been sure, sooner or
later, to fall into a dry shicer and break his neck, or into a wet
one and be drowned.</p>

<p>On the surface of the Gravel Pit his fate was already forgotten.
The rude activity of a gold-diggings in full swing had closed over
the incident, swallowed it up.</p>

<p>Under a sky so pure and luminous that it seemed like a thinly
drawn veil of blueness, which ought to have been transparent,
stretched what, from a short way off, resembled a desert of pale
clay. No patch of green offered rest to the eye; not a tree, hardly
a stunted bush had been left standing, either on the bottom of the
vast shallow basin itself, or on the several hillocks that dotted
it and formed its sides. Even the most prominent of these, the
Black Hill, which jutted out on the Flat like a gigantic tumulus,
had been stripped of its dense timber, feverishly disembowelled,
and was now become a bald protuberance strewn with gravel and clay.
The whole scene had that strange, repellent ugliness that goes with
breaking up and throwing into disorder what has been sanctified as
final, and belongs, in particular, to the wanton disturbing of
earth's gracious, green-spread crust. In the pre-golden era this
wide valley, lying open to sun and wind, had been a lovely
grassland, ringed by a circlet of wooded hills; beyond these, by a
belt of virgin forest. A limpid river and more than one creek had
meandered across its face; water was to be found there even in the
driest summer. She-oaks and peppermint had given shade to the
flocks of the early settlers; wattles had bloomed their brief
delirious yellow passion against the grey-green foliage of the
gums. Now, all that was left of the original "pleasant
resting-place" and its pristine beauty were the ancient volcanic
cones of Warrenheip and Buninyong. These, too far off to supply
wood for firing or slabbing, still stood green and timbered, and
looked down upon the havoc that had been made of the fair, pastoral
lands.</p>

<p>Seen nearer at hand, the dun-coloured desert resolved itself
into uncountable pimpling clay and mud-heaps, of divers shade and
varying sizes: some consisted of but a few bucketfuls of mullock,
others were taller than the tallest man. There were also hundreds
of rain-soaked, mud-bespattered tents, sheds and awnings;
wind-sails, which fell, funnel-like, from a kind of gallows into
the shafts they ventilated; flags fluttering on high posts in front
of stores. The many human figures that went to and fro were hardly
to be distinguished from the ground they trod. They were coated
with earth, clay-clad in ochre and gamboge. Their faces were daubed
with clauber; it matted great beards, and entangled the coarse
hairs on chests and brawny arms. Where, here and there, a blue
jumper had kept a tinge of blueness, it was so besmeared with
yellow that it might have been expected to turn green. The gauze
neck-veils that hung from the brims of wide-awakes or cabbage-trees
were become stiff little lattices of caked clay.</p>

<p>There was water everywhere. From the spurs and gullies round
about, the autumn rains had poured freely down on the Flat; river
and creeks had been over their banks; and such narrow ground-space
as remained between the thick-sown tents, the myriads of holes that
abutted one on another, jealous of every inch of space, had become
a trough of mud. Water meandered over this mud, or carved its soft
way in channels; it lay about in puddles, thick and dark as
coffee-grounds; it filled abandoned shallow holes to the brim.</p>

<p>From this scene rose a blurred hum of sound; rose and as it were
remained stationary above it&mdash;like a smoke-cloud, which no
wind comes to drive away. Gradually, though, the ear made out, in
the conglomerate of noise, a host of separate noises infinitely
multiplied: the sharp tick-tick of surface-picks, the dull thud of
shovels, their muffled echoes from the depths below. There was also
the continuous squeak and groan of windlasses; the bump of the
mullock emptied from the bucket; the trundle of wheelbarrows,
pushed along a plank from the shaft's mouth to the nearest pool;
the dump of the dart on the heap for washing. Along the banks of a
creek, hundreds of cradles rattled and grated; the noise of the
spades, chopping the gravel into the puddling-tubs or the Long
Toms, was like the scrunch of shingle under waves. The fierce
yelping of the dogs chained to the flag-posts of stores, mongrels
which yapped at friend and foe alike, supplied a note of
earsplitting discord.</p>

<p>But except for this it was a wholly mechanical din. Human brains
directed operations, human hands carried them out, but the sound of
the human voice was, for the most part, lacking. The diggers were a
sombre, preoccupied race, little given to lip-work. Even the
"shepherds," who, in waiting to see if their neighbours struck the
lead, beguiled the time with euchre and "lambskinnet," played
moodily, their mouths glued to their pipe-stems; they were
tail-on-end to fling down the cards for pick and shovel. The great
majority, ant-like in their indefatigable busyness, neither turned
a head nor looked up: backs were bent, eyes fixed, in a hard
scrutiny of cradle or tin-dish: it was the earth that held them,
the familiar, homely earth, whose common fate it is to be trodden
heedlessly underfoot. Here, it was the loadstone that drew all
men's thoughts. And it took toll of their bodies in odd, exhausting
forms of labour, which were swift to weed out the unfit.</p>

<p>The men at the windlasses spat into their horny palms and bent
to the crank: they paused only to pass the back of a hand over a
sweaty forehead, or to drain a nose between two fingers. The
barrow-drivers shoved their loads, the bones of their forearms
standing out like ribs. Beside the pools, the puddlers chopped with
their shovels; some even stood in the tubs, and worked the earth
with their feet, as wine-pressers trample grapes. The cradlers,
eternally rocking with one hand, held a long stick in the other
with which to break up any clods a careless puddler might have
deposited in the hopper. Behind these came the great army of
fossickers, washers of surface-dirt, equipped with knives and
tin-dishes, and content if they could wash out half-a-pennyweight
to the dish. At their heels still others, who treated the tailings
they threw away. And among these last was a sprinkling of women,
more than one with an infant sucking at her breast. Withdrawn into
a group for themselves worked a body of Chinese, in loose blue
blouses, flappy blue leg-bags and huge conical straw hats. They,
too, fossicked and re-washed, using extravagant quantities of
water.</p>

<p>Thus the pale-eyed multitude worried the surface, and, at the
risk and cost of their lives, probed the depths. Now that deep
sinking was in vogue, gold-digging no longer served as a play-game
for the gentleman and the amateur; the greater number of those who
toiled at it were work-tried, seasoned men. And yet, although it
had now sunk to the level of any other arduous and uncertain
occupation, and the magic prizes of the early days were seldom
found, something of the old, romantic glamour still clung to this
most famous gold-field, dazzling the eyes and confounding the
judgment. Elsewhere, the horse was in use at the puddling-trough,
and machines for crushing quartz were under discussion. But the
Ballarat digger resisted the introduction of machinery, fearing the
capitalist machinery would bring in its train. He remained the
dreamer, the jealous individualist; he hovered for ever on the
brink of a stupendous discovery.</p>

<p>This dream it was, of vast wealth got without exertion, which
had decoyed the strange, motley crowd, in which peers and churchmen
rubbed shoulders with the scum of Norfolk Island, to exile in this
outlandish region. And the intention of all alike had been: to
snatch a golden fortune from the earth and then, hey, presto! for
the old world again. But they were reckoning without their host:
only too many of those who entered the country went out no more.
They became prisoners to the soil. The fabulous riches of which
they had heard tell amounted, at best, to a few thousands of
pounds: what folly to depart with so little, when mother earth
still teemed! Those who drew blanks nursed an unquenchable hope,
and laboured all their days like navvies, for a navvy's wage.
Others again, broken in health or disheartened, could only turn to
an easier handiwork. There were also men who, as soon as fortune
smiled on them, dropped their tools and ran to squander the work of
months in a wild debauch; and they invariably returned, tail down,
to prove their luck anew. And, yet again, there were those who,
having once seen the metal in the raw: in dust, fine as that
brushed from a butterfly's wing; in heavy, chubby nuggets; or, more
exquisite still, as the daffodil-yellow veining of bluish-white
quartz: these were gripped in the subtlest way of all. A passion
for the gold itself awoke in them an almost sensual craving to
touch and possess; and the glitter of a few specks at the bottom of
pan or cradle came, in time, to mean more to them than "home," or
wife, or child.</p>

<p>Such were the fates of those who succumbed to the "unholy
hunger." It was like a form of revenge taken on them, for their
loveless schemes of robbing and fleeing; a revenge contrived by the
ancient, barbaric country they had so lightly invaded. Now, she
held them captive&mdash;without chains; ensorcelled&mdash;without
witchcraft; and, lying stretched like some primeval monster in the
sun, her breasts freely bared, she watched, with a malignant eye,
the efforts made by these puny mortals to tear their lips away.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-1-1-1" id="ch-1-1-1"></a>Chapter I</h3>

<p>On the summit of one of the clay heaps, a woman shot into
silhouette against the sky. An odd figure, clad in a skimpy green
petticoat, with a scarlet shawl held about her shoulders, wisps of
frowsy red hair standing out round her head, she balanced herself
on the slippery earth, spinning her arm like the vane of a
windmill, and crying at the top of her voice: "Joe,
boys!&mdash;Joe, Joe, Joey!"</p>

<p>It was as if, with these words, she had dropped a live shell in
the diggers' midst. A general stampede ensued; in which the cry was
caught up, echoed and re-echoed, till the whole Flat rang with the
name of "Joe." Tools were dropped, cradles and tubs abandoned,
windlasses left to kick their cranks backwards. Many of the workers
took to their heels; others, in affright, scuttled aimlessly hither
and thither, like barnyard fowls in a panic. Summoned by shouts of:
"Up with you, boys!&mdash;the traps are here!" numbers ascended
from below to see the fun, while as many went hurriedly down to
hiding in drive or chamber. Even those diggers who could pat the
pocket in which their licence lay ceased work, and stood about with
sullen faces to view the course of events. Only the group of
Chinamen washing tail-heaps remained unmoved. One of them, to whom
the warning woman belonged, raised his head and called a Chinese
word at her; she obeyed it instantly, vanished into thin air; the
rest went impassively on with their fossicking. They were not such
fools as to try to cheat the Government of its righteous dues. None
but had his licence safely folded in his nosecloth, and thrust
inside the bosom of his blouse.</p>

<p>Through the labyrinth of tents and mounds, a gold-laced cap
could be seen approaching; then a gold-tressed jacket came into
view, the white star on the forehead of a mare. Behind the
Commissioner, who rode down thus from the Camp, came the members of
his staff; these again were followed by a body of mounted troopers.
They drew rein on the slope, and simultaneously a line of foot
police, backed by a detachment of light infantry, shot out like an
arm, and walled in the Flat to the south.</p>

<p>On the appearance of the enemy the babel redoubled. There were
groans and cat-calls. Along with the derisive "Joeys!" the rebel
diggers hurled any term of abuse that came to their lips.</p>

<p>"The dolly mops! The skunks! The bushrangers!&mdash;Oh, damn
'em, damn 'em!...damn their bloody eyes!"</p>

<p>"It's Rooshia&mdash;that's what it is!" said an oldish man
darkly.</p>

<p>The Commissioner, a horse-faced, solemn man with brown side
whiskers, let the reins droop on his mare's neck and sat unwinking
in the tumult. His mien was copied by his staff. Only one of them,
a very young boy who was new to the colony and his post, changed
colour under his gaudy cap, went from white to pink and from pink
to white again; while at each fresh insult he gave a perceptible
start, and gazed dumbfounded at his chief's insensitive back.</p>

<p>The "bloodhounds" had begun to track their prey. Rounding up,
with a skill born of long practice, they drove the diggers before
them towards the centre of the Flat. Here they passed from group to
group and from hole to hole, calling for the production of licences
with an insolence that made its object see red. They were nice of
scent, too, and, nine times in ten, pounced on just those
unfortunates who, through carelessness, or lack of means, or on
political grounds, had failed to take out the month's licence to
dig for gold. Every few minutes one or another was marched off
between two constables to the Government Camp, for fine or
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Now it was that it suddenly entered Long Jim's head to cut and
run. Up till now he had stood declaring himself a free-born Briton,
who might be drawn and quartered if he ever again paid the blasted
tax. But, as the police came closer, a spear of fright pierced his
befuddled brain, and inside a breath he was off and away. Had the
abruptness of his start not given him a slight advantage, he would
have been caught at once. As it was, the chase would not be a long
one; the clumsy, stiff-jointed man slithered here and stuck fast
there, dodging obstacles with an awkwardness that was painful to
see. He could be heard sobbing and cursing as he ran.</p>

<p>At this point the Commissioner, half turning, signed to the
troopers in his rear. Six or seven of them shook up their bridles
and rode off, their scabbards clinking, to prevent the fugitive's
escape.</p>

<p>A howl of contempt went up from the crowd. The pink and white
subaltern made what was almost a movement of the arm to intercept
his superior's command.</p>

<p>It was too much for Long Jim's last mate, the youthful
blackbeard who had pluckily descended the shaft after the accident.
He had been standing on a mound with a posse of others, following
the man-hunt. At his partner's crack-brained dash for the open, his
snorts of indignation found words. "Gaw-blimy!...is the old fool
gone dotty?" Then he drew a whistling breath. "No, it's more than
flesh and blood...Stand back, boys!" And though he was as little
burdened with a licence as the man under pursuit, he shouted:
"Help, help!...for God's sake, don't let 'em have me!" shot down
the slope, and was off like the wind.</p>

<p>His foxly object was attained. The attention of the hunters was
diverted. Long Jim, seizing the moment, vanished underground.</p>

<p>The younger man ran with the lightness of a hare. He had also
the hare's address in doubling and turning. His pursuers never
knew, did he pass from sight behind a covert of tents and mounds,
where he would bob up next. He avoided shafts and pools as if by a
miracle; ran along greasy planks without a slip; and, where these
had been removed to balk the police, he jumped the holes, taking
risks that were not for a sane man. Once he fell, but, enslimed
from head to foot, wringing wet and hatless, was up again in a
twinkling. His enemies were less sure-footed than he, and times
without number measured their length on the oily ground. Still, one
of them was gaining rapidly on him, a giant of a fellow with long
thin legs; and soon the constable's foot filled the prints left by
the young man's, while these were still warm. It was a fine run.
The diggers trooped after in a body; the Flat rang with cheers and
plaudits. Even the Commissioner and his retinue trotted in the same
direction. Eventually the runaway must land in the arms of the
mounted police.</p>

<p>But this was not his plan. Making as though he headed for the
open, he suddenly dashed off at right angles, and, with a final
sprint, brought up dead against a log-and-canvas store which stood
on rising ground. His adversary was so close behind that a
collision resulted; the digger's feet slid from under him, he fell
on his face, the other on top. In their fall they struck a huge
pillar of tin-dishes, ingeniously built up to the height of the
store itself. This toppled over with a crash, and the dishes went
rolling down the slope between the legs of the police. The dog
chained to the flagstaff all but strangled himself in his rage and
excitement; and the owner of the store came running out.</p>

<p>"Purdy!...you! What in the name of...?"</p>

<p>The digger adroitly rolled his captor over, and there they both
sat, side by side on the ground, one gripping the other's collar,
both too blown to speak. A cordon of puffing constables hemmed them
in.</p>

<p>The storekeeper frowned. "You've no licence, you young
beggar!"</p>

<p>And: "Your licence, you scoundrel!" demanded the leader of the
troop.</p>

<p>The prisoner's rejoinder was a saucy: "Now then, out with the
cuffs, Joe!"</p>

<p>He got on his feet as bidden; but awkwardly, for it appeared
that in falling he had hurt his ankle. Behind the police were
massed the diggers. These opened a narrow alley for the Camp
officials to ride through, but their attitude was hostile, and
there were cries of: "Leave 'im go, yer blackguards!...after sich a
run! None o yer bloody quod for 'im!" along with other, more
threatening expressions. Sombre and taciturn, the Commissioner
waved his hand. "Take him away!"</p>

<p>"Well, so long, Dick!" said the culprit jauntily; and, as he
offered his wrists to be handcuffed, he whistled an air.</p>

<p>Here the storekeeper hurriedly interposed: "No, stop! I'll give
bail." And darting into the tent and out again, he counted five
one-pound notes into the constable's palm. The lad's collar was
released; and a murmur of satisfaction mounted from the crowd.</p>

<p>At the sound the giver made as if to retire. Then, yielding to a
second thought, he stepped forward and saluted the Commissioner. "A
young hot-head, sir! He means no harm. I'll send him up in the
morning, to apologise."</p>

<p>("I'll be damned if you do!" muttered the digger between his
teeth.)</p>

<p>But the Chief refused to be placated. "Good day, doctor," he
said shortly, and with his staff at heel trotted down the slope,
followed till out of earshot by a mocking fire of "Joes." Lingering
in the rear, the youthful sympathiser turned in his saddle and
waved his cap.</p>

<p>The raid was over for that day. The crowd dispersed; its members
became orderly, hard-working men once more. The storekeeper hushed
his frantic dog, and called his assistant to rebuild the pillar of
tins.</p>

<p>The young digger sat down on the log that served for a bench,
and examined his foot. He pulled and pulled, causing himself great
pain, but could not get his boot off. At last, looking back over
his shoulder he cried impatiently: "Dick!...I say, Dick Mahony!
Give us a drink, old boy!...I'm dead-beat."</p>

<p>At this the storekeeper&mdash;a tall, slenderly built man of
some seven or eight and twenty&mdash;appeared, bearing a jug and a
pannikin.</p>

<p>"Oh, bah!" said the lad, when he found that the jug held only
water. And, on his friend reminding him that he might by now have
been sitting in the lock-up, he laughed and winked. "I knew you'd
go bail."</p>

<p>"Well!...of all the confounded impudence..."</p>

<p>"Faith, Dick, and d'ye think I didn't see how your hand itched
for your pocket?"</p>

<p>The man he called Mahony flushed above his fair beard. It was
true: he had made an involuntary movement of the hand&mdash;checked
for the rest halfway, by the knowledge that the pocket was empty.
He looked displeased and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, I'll pay you back soon's ever me ship comes
home," went on the young scapegrace, who very well knew how to play
his cards. At his companion's heated disclaimer, however, he
changed his tone. "I say, Dick, have a look at my foot, will you? I
can't get this damned boot off."</p>

<p>The elder man bent over the injury. He ceased to show
displeasure. "Purdy, you young fool, when will you learn
wisdom?"</p>

<p>"Well, they shouldn't hunt old women, then&mdash;the swine!"
gave back Purdy; and told his tale. "Oh, lor! there go six
canaries." For, at his wincing and shrinking, his friend had taken
a penknife and ripped up the jackboot. Now, practised hands
explored the swollen, discoloured ankle.</p>

<p>When it had been washed and bandaged, its owner stretched
himself on the ground, his head in the shade of a barrel, and went
to sleep.</p>

<p>He slept till sundown, through all the traffic of a busy
afternoon.</p>

<p>Some half-a-hundred customers came and went. The greater number
of them were earth-stained diggers, who ran up for, it might be, a
missing tool, or a hide bucket, or a coil of rope. They spat jets
of tobacco-juice, were richly profane, paid, where coin was scarce,
in gold-dust from a match-box, and hurried back to work. But there
also came old harridans&mdash;as often as not, diggers
themselves&mdash;whose language outdid that of the males, and dirty
Irish mothers; besides a couple of the white women who inhabited
the Chinese quarter. One of these was in liquor, and a great
hullabaloo took place before she could be got rid of. Put out, she
stood in front of the tent, her hair hanging down her back, cursing
and reviling. Respectable women as well did an afternoon's shopping
there. In no haste to be gone, they sat about on empty boxes or
upturned barrels exchanging confidences, while weary children
plucked at their skirts. A party of youngsters entered, the tallest
of whom could just see over the counter, and called for
shandygaffs. The assistant was for chasing them off, with hard
words. But the storekeeper put, instead, a stick of barley-sugar
into each dirty, outstretched hand, and the imps retired well
content. On their heels came a digger and his lady-love to choose a
wedding-outfit; and all the gaudy finery the store held was
displayed before them. A red velvet dress flounced with satin, a
pink gauze bonnet, white satin shoes and white silk stockings met
their fancy. The dewy-lipped, smutty-lashed Irish girl blushed and
dimpled, in consulting with the shopman upon the stays in which to
lace her ample figure; the digger, whose very pores oozed gold,
planked down handfuls of dust and nuggets, and brushed aside a neat
Paisley shawl for one of yellow satin, the fellow to which he swore
to having seen on the back of the Governor's lady herself. He
showered brandy-snaps on the children, and bought a polka-jacket
for a shabby old woman. Then, producing a bottle of champagne from
a sack he bore, he called on those present to give him, after: "'Er
most Gracious little Majesty, God bless 'er!" the: "'Oly estate of
materimony!" The empty bottle smashed for luck, the couple departed
arm-in-arm, carrying their purchases in the sack; and the rest of
the company trooped to the door with them, to wish them joy.</p>

<p>Within the narrow confines of the tent, where red-herrings
trailed over moleskin-shorts, and East India pickles and Hessian
boots lay on the top of sugar and mess-pork; where cheeses rubbed
shoulders with tallow candles, blue and red serge shirts, and
captain's biscuits; where onions, and guernseys, and sardines, fine
combs, cigars and bear's-grease, Windsor soap, tinned coffee and
hair oil, revolvers, shovels and Oxford shoes, lay in one grand
miscellany: within the crowded store, as the afternoon wore on, the
air grew rank and oppressive. Precisely at six o'clock the bar was
let down across the door, and the storekeeper withdrew to his
living-room at the back of the tent. Here he changed his coat and
meticulously washed his hands, to which clung a subtle blend of all
the strong-smelling goods that had passed through them. Then,
coming round to the front, he sat down on the log and took out his
pipe. He made a point, no matter how brisk trade was, of not
keeping open after dark. His evenings were his own.</p>

<p>He sat and puffed, tranquilly. It was a fine night. The first
showy splendour of sunset had passed; but the upper sky was still
aflush with colour. And in the centre of this frail cloud, which
faded as he watched it, swam a single star.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-1-2" id="ch-1-1-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>With the passing of a cooler air the sleeper wakened and rubbed
his eyes. Letting his injured leg lie undisturbed, he drew up the
other knee and buckled his hands round it. In this position he sat
and talked.</p>

<p>He was a dark, fresh-coloured young man, of middle height, and
broadly built. He had large white teeth of a kind to crack nuts
with, and the full, wide, flexible mouth that denotes the generous
talker.</p>

<p>"What a wind-bag it is, to be sure!" thought his companion, as
he smoked and listened, in a gently ironic silence, to abuse of the
Government. He knew&mdash;or thought he knew&mdash;young Purdy
inside out.</p>

<p>But behind all the froth of the boy's talk there lurked, it
seemed, a purpose. No sooner was a meal of cold chop and tea over
than Purdy declared his intention of being present at a meeting of
malcontent diggers. Nor would he even wait to wash himself clean of
mud.</p>

<p>His friend reluctantly agreed to lend him an arm. But he could
not refrain from taking the lad to task for getting entangled in
the political imbroglio. "When, as you know, it's just a kind of
sport to you."</p>

<p>Purdy sulked for a few paces, then burst out: "If only you
weren't so damned detached, Dick Mahony!"</p>

<p>"You're restless, and want excitement, my boy&mdash;that's the
root of the trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm jiggered! If ever I knew a restless mortal, it's
yourself."</p>

<p>The two men picked their steps across the Flat and up the
opposite hillside, young Purdy Smith limping and leaning heavy, his
lame foot thrust into an old slipper. He was at all times
hail-fellow-well-met with the world. Now, in addition, his plucky
exploit of the afternoon blazed its way through the settlement; and
blarney and bravos rained upon him. "Golly for you, Purdy, old
'oss!" "Showed 'em the diggers' flag, 'e did!" "What'll you take,
me buck? Come on in for a drop o' the real strip-me-down-naked!"
Even a weary old strumpet, propping herself against the doorway of
a dancing-saloon, waved a tipsy hand and cried: "Arrah, an' is it
yerrself, Purrdy, me bhoy? Shure an' it's bussin' ye I'd be
afther&mdash;if me legs would carry me!" And Purdy laughed, and
relished the honey, and had an answer pat for everybody especially
the women. His companion on the other hand was greeted with a
glibness that had something perfunctory in it, and no touch of
familiarity.</p>

<p>The big canvas tent on Bakery Hill, where the meeting was to be
held, was already lighted; and at the tinkle of a bell the diggers,
who till then had stood cracking and hobnobbing outside, began to
push for the entrance. The bulk of them belonged to the race that
is quickest to resent injustice&mdash;were Irish. After them in
number came the Germans, swaggering and voluble; and the
inflammable French, English, Scotch and Americans formed a smaller
and cooler, but very dogged group.</p>

<p>At the end of the tent a rough platform had been erected, on
which stood a row of cane seats. In the body of the hall, the
benches were formed of boards, laid from one upturned keg or tub to
another. The chair was taken by a local auctioneer, a
cadaverous-looking man, with never a twinkle in his eye, who, in a
lengthy discourse and with the single monotonous gesture of beating
the palm of one hand with the back of the other, strove to bring
home to his audience the degradation of their present political
status. The diggers chewed and spat, and listened to his periods
with sang-froid: the shame of their state did not greatly move
them. They followed, too, with composure, the rehearsal of their
general grievances. As they were aware, said the speaker, the
Legislative Council of Victoria was made up largely of Crown
nominees; in the election of members the gold-seeking population
had no voice whatsoever. This was a scandalous thing; for the
digging constituent outnumbered all the rest of the population put
together, thus forming what he would call the backbone and mainstay
of the colony. The labour of <i>their</i> hands had raised the
colony to its present pitch of prosperity. And yet these same bold
and hardy pioneers were held incapable of deciding jot or tittle in
the public affairs of their adopted home. Still unmoved, the
diggers listened to this recital of their virtues. But when one
man, growing weary of the speaker's unctuous wordiness, discharged
a fierce: "Why the hell don't yer git on to the bloody
licence-tax?" the audience was fire and flame in an instant. A
riotous noise ensued; rough throats rang changes on the question.
Order restored, it was evident that the speech was over. Thrown
violently out of his concept, the auctioneer struck and struck at
his palm&mdash;in vain; nothing would come. So, making the best of
a bad job, he irately sat down in favour of his successor on the
programme.</p>

<p>This speaker did not fare much better. The assemblage, roused
now, jolly and merciless, was not disposed to give quarter; and his
obtuseness in dawdling over such high-flown notions as that
population, not property, formed the basis of representative
government, reaped him a harvest of boos and groans. This was not
what the diggers had come out to hear. And they were as direct as
children in their demand for the gist of the matter.</p>

<p>"A reg-lar ol' shicer!" was the unanimous opinion, expressed
without scruple. While from the back of the hall came the curt
request to him to shut his "tater-trap."</p>

<p>Next on the list was a German, a ruddy-faced man with
mutton-chop whiskers and prominent, watery eyes. He could not
manage the letter "r." In the body of a word where it was
negligible, he rolled it out as though it stood three deep. Did he
tackle it as an initial, on the other hand, his tongue seemed to
cleave to his palate, and to yield only an "l." This quaint defect
caused some merriment at the start, but was soon eclipsed by a more
striking oddity. The speaker had the habit of, as it were, creaking
with his nose. After each few sentences he paused, to give himself
time to produce something between a creak and a snore&mdash;an
abortive attempt to get at a mucus that was plainly out of
reach.</p>

<p>The diggers were beside themselves with mirth.</p>

<p>"'E's forgot 'is 'ankey!"</p>

<p>"'Ere, boys, look slippy!&mdash;a 'ankey for ol' sausage!"</p>

<p>But the German was not sensitive to ridicule. He had something
to say, and he was there to say it. Fixing his fish-like eyes on a
spot high up the tent wall, he kept them pinned to it, while he
mouthed out blood-and-thunder invectives. He was, it seemed, a
red-hot revolutionist; a fierce denouncer of British rule. He
declared the British monarchy to be an effete institution; the
fetish of British freedom to have been "exbloded" long ago. What
they needed, in this grand young country of theirs, was a
"republic"; they must rid themselves of those shackles that had
been forged in the days when men were slaves. It was his sound
conviction that before many weeks had passed, the Union Jack would
have been hauled down for ever, and the glorious Southern Cross
would wave in its stead, over a free Australia. The day on which
this happened would be a never-to-be-forgotten date in the annals
of the country. For what, he would like to know, had the British
flag ever done for freedom, at any time in the world's history?
They should read in their school-books, and there they would learn
that wherever a people had risen against their tyrants, the Union
Jack had waved, not over them, but over the British troops sent to
stamp the rising out.</p>

<p>This was more than Mahony could stomach. Flashing up from his
seat, he strove to assert himself above the hum of agreement that
mounted from the foreign contingent, and the doubtful sort of
grumble by which the Britisher signifies his disapproval.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman! Gentlemen!" he cried in a loud voice. "I call
upon those loyal subjects of her Majesty who are present here, to
join with me in giving three cheers for the British flag. Hip, hip,
hurrah! And, again, hip, hip, hurrah! And, once more, hip, hip,
hurrah!"</p>

<p>His compatriots followed him, though flabbily; and he continued
to make himself heard above the shouts of "Order!" and the bimming
of the chairman's bell.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman! I appeal to you. Are we Britons to sit still and
hear our country's flag reviled?&mdash;that flag which has ensured
us the very liberty we are enjoying this evening. The gentleman who
has been pleased to slander it is not, I believe, a British
citizen. Now, I put it to him: is there another country on the face
of the earth, that would allow people of all nations to flock into
a gold-bearing colony on terms of perfect equality with its own
subjects?&mdash;to flock in, take all they can get, and then make
off with it?" a point of view that elicited forcible grunts of
assent, which held their own against hoots and hisses.
Unfortunately the speaker did not stop here, but went on:
"Gentlemen! Do not, I implore you, allow yourselves to be led
astray by a handful of ungrateful foreigners, who have received
nothing but benefits from our Crown. What you need, gentlemen, is
not revolution, but reform; not strife and bloodshed, but a liberty
consistent with law and order. And this, gentlemen,&mdash;"</p>

<p>("You'll never get 'em like that, Dick," muttered Purdy.)</p>

<p>"Not so much gentlemening, if <i>you</i> please!" said a
sinister-looking man, who might have been a Vandemonian in his day.
"<i>Men's</i> what we are&mdash;that's good enough for us."</p>

<p>Mahony was nettled. The foreigners, too, were pressing him.</p>

<p>"Am I then to believe, sir, what I frequently hear asserted,
that there are no gentlemen left on the diggings?"</p>

<p>("Oh lor, Dick!" said Purdy. He was sitting with his elbows on
his knees, clutching his cheeks as though he had the
toothache.)</p>

<p>"Oh, stow yer blatherskite!"</p>

<p>"Believe what yer bloody well like!" retorted the Vandemonian
fiercely. "But don't come 'ere and interrupt our pleasant and
h'orderly meetings with <i>your</i> blamed jaw."</p>

<p>Mahony lost his temper. "I not interrupt?&mdash;when I see you
great hulks of men&mdash;"</p>

<p>("Oh, lor!" groaned Purdy again.)</p>

<p>"&mdash;who call yourselves British subjects, letting yourselves
be led by the nose, like the sheep you are, by a pack of foreigners
who are basely accepting this country's hospital'ty?"</p>

<p>"Here, let me," said Purdy. And pushing his way along the bench
he hobbled to the platform, where several arms hoisted him up.</p>

<p>There he stood, fronting the violent commotion that had ensued
on his friend's last words; stood bedraggled, mud-stained,
bandaged, his cabbage-tree hat in his hand. And Mahony, still on
his feet, angrily erect, thought he understood why the boy had
refused to wash himself clean, or to change his dress: he had no
doubt foreseen the possibility of some such dramatic
appearance.</p>

<p>Purdy waited for the hubbub to die down. As if by chance he had
rested his hand on the bell; its provoking tinkle ceased. Now he
broke into one of the frank and hearty smiles that never fail to
conciliate.</p>

<p>"Brother diggers!"</p>

<p>The strongly spoken words induced an abrupt lull. The audience
turned to him, still thorny and sulky it was true, but yet they
turned; and one among them demanded a hearing for the
youngster.</p>

<p>"Brother diggers! We are met here to-night with a single purpose
in view. Brother diggers! We are not met here to throw mud at our
dear old country's flag! Nor will we have a word said against her
most gracious Majesty, the Queen. Not us! We're men first, whose
business it is to stand up for a gallant little woman, and diggers
with a grievance afterwards. Are you with me, boys?&mdash;Very
well, then.&mdash;Now we didn't come here to-night to confab about
getting votes, or having a hand in public affairs&mdash;much as we
want 'em both and mean to have 'em, when the time comes. No,
to-night there's only one thing that matters to us, and that's the
repeal of the accursed tax!" Here, such a tempest of applause broke
out that he was unable to proceed. "Yes, I say it again," he went
on, when they would let him speak; "the instant repeal! When that's
been done, this curse taken off us, then it'll be time enough to
parlez-vous about the colour of the flag we mean to have, and about
going shares in the Government. But let me make one thing clear to
you. We're neither traitors to the Crown, nor common rebels. We're
true-blue Britons, who have been goaded to rebellion by one of the
vilest pieces of tyranny that ever saw the light. Spies and
informers are everywhere about us. Mr. Commissioner Sleuth and his
hounds may cry tally-ho every day, if 'tis their pleasure to! To
put it shortly, boys, we're living under semi-martial law. To such
a state have we free-born men, men who came out but to see the
elephant, been reduced, by the asinine stupidity of the Government,
by the impudence and knavishness of its officials. Brother diggers!
When you leave the hall this evening, look over at the hill on
which the Camp stands! What will you see? You will see a blaze of
light, and hear the sounds of revelry by night. There, boys, hidden
from our mortal view, but visible to our mind's eye, sit Charley
Joe's minions, carousing at our expense, washing down each mouthful
with good fizz bought with our hard-earned gold. Licence-pickings,
boys, and tips from new grog-shops, and the blasted farce of the
Commissariat! We're supposed&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here Mahony gave a loud click of the tongue&mdash;in the
general howl of execration it passed unheard&mdash;and, pushing his
way out of the tent, let the flap-door fall to behind him.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-1-3" id="ch-1-1-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>He retraced his steps by the safe-conduct of a full moon, which
showed up the gaping black mouths of circular shafts and silvered
the water that flooded abandoned oblong holes to their brim. Tents
and huts stood white and forsaken in the moonlight: their owners
were either gathered on Bakery Hill, or had repaired to one of the
gambling and dancing saloons that lined the main street. Arrived at
the store he set his frantic dog free, and putting a match to his
pipe, began to stroll up and down.</p>

<p>He felt annoyed with himself for having helped to swell the
crowd of malcontents; and still more for his foolishness in giving
the rein to a momentary irritation. As if it mattered a doit what
trash these foreigners talked! No thinking person took their
bombast seriously; the authorities, with great good sense, let it
pass for what it was&mdash;a noisy blowing-off of steam. At heart,
the diggers were as sound as good pippins.</p>

<p>A graver consideration was Purdy's growing fellowship with the
rebel faction. The boy was too young and still too much of a
fly-by-night to have a black mark set against his name. It would be
the more absurd, considering that his sincerity in espousing the
diggers' cause was far from proved. He was of a nature to ride
tantivy into anything that promised excitement or adventure. With,
it must regretfully be admitted, an increasing relish for the
limelight, for theatrical effect&mdash;see the cunning with which
he had made capital out of a bandaged ankle and dirty dress! At
this rate, and with his engaging ways, he would soon stand for a
little god to the rough, artless crowd. No, he must leave the
diggings &mdash;and Mahony rolled various schemes in his mind. He
had it! In the course of the next week or two business would make a
journey to Melbourne imperative. Well, he would damn the extra
expense and take the boy along with him! Purdy was at a loose end,
and would no doubt rise like a fish to a fly at the chance of
getting to town free of cost. After all, why be hard on him? He was
not much over twenty, and, at that age, it was natural
enough&mdash;especially in a place like this&mdash;for a lad to
flit like a butterfly from every cup that took his restless
fancy.</p>

<p>Restless?...h'm! It was the word Purdy had flung back at him,
earlier in the evening. At the time, he had rebutted the charge,
with a glance at fifteen months spent behind the counter of a
store. But there was a modicum of truth in it, none the less. The
life one led out here was not calculated to tone down any innate
restlessness of temperament: on the contrary, it directly hindered
one from becoming fixed and settled. It was on a par with the
houses you lived in&mdash;these flimsy tents and draught-riddled
cabins you put up with, "for the time being"&mdash;was just as much
of a makeshift affair as they. Its keynote was change. Fortunes
were made, and lost, and made again, before you could say Jack
Robinson; whole townships shot up over-night, to be deserted the
moment the soil ceased to yield; the people you knew were here
to-day, and gone &mdash;sold up, burnt out, or dead and
buried&mdash;to-morrow. And so, whether you would or not, your
whole outlook became attuned to the general unrest; you lived in a
constant anticipation of what was coming next. Well, he could own
to the weakness with more justification than most. If trade
continued to prosper with him as it did at present, it would be no
time before he could sell out and joyfully depart for the old
country.</p>

<p>In the meantime, why complain? He had much to be thankful for.
To take only a small point: was this not Saturday night? To-morrow
the store was closed, and a string of congenial occupations
offered: from chopping the week's wood&mdash;a clean and wholesome
task, which he gladly performed&mdash;through the pages of an
engrossing book to a botanical ramble round old Buninyong. The
thought of it cheered him. He stooped to caress his two cats, which
had come out to bear him the mute and pleasant company of their
kind.</p>

<p>What a night! The great round silver moon floated serenely
through space, dimming the stars as it made them, and bathing the
earth in splendour. It was so light that straight black lines of
smoke could be seen mounting from chimneys and open-air fires. The
grass-trees which supplied the fuel for these fires spread a
pleasant balsamic odour, and the live red patches contrasted oddly
with the pale ardour of the moon. Lights twinkled over all the
township, but were brightest in Main Street, the course of which
they followed like a rope of fireflies, and at the Government Camp
on the steep western slope, where no doubt, as young Purdy had
impudently averred, the officials still sat over the dinner-table.
It was very quiet&mdash;no grog-shops or saloons-of-entertainment
in this neighbourhood, thank goodness!&mdash;and the hour was still
too early for drunken roisterers to come reeling home. The only
sound to be heard was that of a man's voice singing <i>Oft in the
Stilly Night</i>, to the yetching accompaniment of a concertina.
Mahony hummed the tune.</p>

<p>But it was growing cold, as the nights were apt to do on this
tableland once summer was past. He whistled his dog, and Pompey
hurried out with a guilty air from the back of the house, where the
old shaft stood that served to hold refuse. Mahony put him on the
chain, and was just about to turn in when two figures rounded the
corner of a tent and came towards him, pushing their shadows before
them on the milk-white ground.</p>

<p>"'D evenin', doc," said the shorter of the two, a nuggetty
little man who carried his arms curved out from his sides,
gorilla-fashion.</p>

<p>"Oh, good evening, Mr. Ocock," said Mahony, recognising a
neighbour.&mdash;"Why, Tom, that you? Back already, my
boy?"&mdash;this to a loutish, loose-limbed lad who followed
behind.&mdash;"You don't of course come from the meeting?"</p>

<p>"Not me, indeed!" gave back his visitor with gall, and turned
his head to spit the juice from a plug. "I've got suthin' better to
do as to listen to a pack o' jabberin' furriners settin' one
another by th'ears."</p>

<p>"Nor you, Tom?" Mahony asked the lad, who stood sheepishly
shifting his weight from one leg to the other.</p>

<p>"Nay, nor 'im eether," jumped in his father, before he could
speak. "I'll 'ave none o' my boys playin' the fool up there. And
that reminds me, doc, young Smith'll git 'imself inter the devil of
a mess one o' these days, if you don't look after 'im a bit
better'n you do. I 'eard 'im spoutin' away as I come
past&mdash;usin' language about the Gover'ment fit to turn you
sick."</p>

<p>Mahony coughed. "He's but young yet," he said drily. "After all,
youth's youth, sir, and comes but once in a lifetime. And you can't
make lads into wiseacres between sundown and sunrise."</p>

<p>"No, by Gawd, you can't!" affirmed his companion. "But I think
youth's just a fine name for a sort o' piggish mess What's the
good, one 'ud like to know, of gettin' old, and learnin' wisdom,
and knowin' the good from the bad, when ev'ry lousy young fathead
that's born inter the world starts out again to muddle through it
for 'imself, in 'is own way. And that things 'as got to go on like
this, just the same, for ever and ever &mdash;why, it makes me fair
tired to think of it. My father didn't 'old with youth: 'e knocked
it out of us by thrashin', just like lyin' and thievin'. And it's
the best way, too.&mdash;Wot's that you say?" he flounced round on
the unoffending Tom. "Nothin'? You was only snifflin', was you? You
keep your fly-trap shut, my fine fellow, and make no mousy sounds
to me, or it'll be the worse for you, I can tell you!"</p>

<p>"Come, Mr. Ocock, don't be too hard on the boy."</p>

<p>"Not be 'ard on 'im? When I've got the nasty galoon on me 'ands
again like this?&mdash;Chucks up the good post I git 'im in
Kilmore, without with your leave or by your leave. Too lonely for
'is lordship it was. Missed the sound o' wimmin's petticoats, 'e
did." He turned fiercely on his son. "'Ere, don't you stand starin'
there! You get 'ome, and fix up for the night. Now then, wot are
you dawdlin' for, pig-'ead?"</p>

<p>The boy slunk away. When he had disappeared, his father again
took up the challenge of Mahony's silent disapproval. "I can't
'ardly bear the sight of 'im, doc.&mdash;disgracin' me as 'e 'as
done. 'Im a father, and not eighteen till June! A son o' mine, who
can't see a wench with 'er bodice open, but wot 'e must be arter
'er...No, sir, no son o' mine! I'm a respectable man, I am!"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh! but they're a sore trial to me, these boys, doc. 'Enry's
the only one...if it weren't for 'Enry&mdash;Johnny, 'e can't pass
the drink, and now 'ere's this young swine started to nose arter
the wimmin."</p>

<p>"There's good stuff in the lads, I'm sure of it. They're just
sowing their wild oats."</p>

<p>"They'll sow no h'oats with me."</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is, Mr. Ocock, you need a woman about your
place, to make it a bit more homelike," said Mahony, calling to
mind the pigstye in which Ocock and his sons housed.</p>

<p>"Course I do!" agreed Ocock. "And Melia, she'll come out to 'er
daddy soon as ever th'ol' woman kicks the bucket.&mdash;Drat 'er!
It's 'er I've got to thank for all the mischief."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" said Mahony, and rising knocked out his pipe on
the log. Did his old neighbour once get launched on the subject of
his wife's failings, there was no stopping him. "We all have our
crosses."</p>

<p>"That I 'ave. And I'm keepin' you outer your bed, doc., with me
blather. &mdash;By gum! and that reminds me I come 'ere special to
see you to-night. Bin gettin' a bit moonstruck, I
reckon,"&mdash;and he clapped on his hat.</p>

<p>Drawing a sheaf of papers from an inner pocket, he selected one
and offered it to Mahony. Mahony led the way indoors, and lighting
a kerosene-lamp stooped to decipher the letter.</p>

<p>For some weeks now he had been awaiting the delivery of a load
of goods, the invoice for which had long since reached him. From
this communication, carried by hand, he learnt that the drayman,
having got bogged just beyond Bacchus's marsh, had decamped to the
Ovens, taking with him all he could cram into a spring-cart, and
disposing of the remainder for what he could get. The agent in
Melbourne refused to be held responsible for the loss, and
threatened to prosecute, if payment for the goods were not
immediately forthcoming. Mahony, who here heard the first of the
affair, was highly indignant at the tone of the letter; and before
he had read to the end resolved to let everything else slide, and
to leave for Melbourne early next morning.</p>

<p>Ocock backed him up in this decision, and with the aid of a
great quill pen stiffly traced the address of his eldest son, who
practised as a solicitor in the capital.</p>

<p>"Go you straight to 'Enry, doc. 'Enry'll see you through."</p>

<p>Brushing aside his dreams of a peaceful Sabbath Mahony made
preparations for his journey. Waking his assistant, he gave the
man&mdash;a stupid clodhopper, but honest and
attached&mdash;instructions how to manage during his absence, then
sent him to the township to order horses. Himself, he put on his
hat and went out to look for Purdy.</p>

<p>His search led him through all the drunken revelry of a Saturday
night. And it was close on twelve before, having followed the trace
from bowling-alley to Chinese cook-shop, from the "Adelphi" to
Mother Flannigan's and haunts still less reputable, he finally
succeeded in catching his bird.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-1-4" id="ch-1-1-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>The two young men took to the road betimes: it still wanted some
minutes to six on the new clock in the tower of Bath's Hotel, when
they threw their legs over their saddles and rode down the steep
slope by the Camp Reserve. The hoofs of the horses pounded the
plank bridge that spanned the Yarrowee, and striking loose stones,
and smacking and sucking in the mud, made a rude clatter in the
Sunday quiet.</p>

<p>Having followed for a few hundred yards the wide, rut-riddled
thoroughfare of Main Street, the riders branched off to cross
rising ground. They proceeded in single file and at a footpace, for
the highway had been honeycombed and rendered unsafe; it also
ascended steadily. Just before they entered the bush, which was
alive with the rich, strong whistling of magpies, Purdy halted to
look back and wave his hat in farewell. Mahony also half-turned in
the saddle. There it lay&mdash;the scattered, yet congested,
unlovely wood and canvas settlement that was Ballarat. At this
distance, and from this height, it resembled nothing so much as a
collection of child's bricks, tossed out at random over the ground,
the low, square huts and cabins that composed it being all of a
shape and size. Some threads of smoke began to mount towards the
immense pale dome of the sky. The sun was catching here the panes
of a window, there the tin that encased a primitive chimney.</p>

<p>They rode on, leaving the warmth of the early sun-rays for the
cold blue shadows of the bush. Neither broke the silence. Mahony's
day had not come to an end with the finding of Purdy. Barely
stretched on his palliasse he had been routed out to attend to Long
Jim, who had missed his footing and pitched into a shaft. The poor
old tipsy idiot hauled up &mdash;luckily for him it was a dry,
shallow hole&mdash;there was a broken collar-bone to set. Mahony
had installed him in his own bed, and had spent the remainder of
the night dozing in a chair.</p>

<p>So now he was heavy-eyed, uncommunicative. As they climbed the
shoulder and came to the rich, black soil that surrounded the
ancient cone of Warrenheip, he mused on his personal relation to
the place he had just left. And not for the first time he asked
himself: what am I doing here? When he was absent from Ballarat,
and could dispassionately consider the life he led there, he was so
struck by the incongruity of the thing that, like the beldame in
the nursery-tale, he could have pinched himself to see whether he
waked or slept. Had anyone told him, three years previously, that
the day was coming when he would weigh out soap and sugar, and hand
them over a counter in exchange for money, he would have held the
prophet ripe for Bedlam. Yet here he was, a full-blown tradesman,
and as greedy of gain as any tallow-chandler. Extraordinary, aye,
and distressing, too, the ease with which the human organism
adapted itself; it was just a case of the green caterpillar on the
green leaf. Well, he could console himself with the knowledge that
his apparent submission was only an affair of the surface. He had
struck no roots; and it would mean as little to his half-dozen
acquaintances on Ballarat when he silently vanished from their
midst, as it would to him if he never saw one of them again. Or the
country either&mdash;and he let his eye roam unlovingly over the
wild, sad-coloured landscape, with its skimpy, sad-coloured
trees.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they were advancing: their nags' hoofs, beating in
unison, devoured mile after mile of the road. It was a typical
colonial road; it went up hill and down dale, turned aside for no
obstacles. At one time it ran down a gully that was almost a
ravine, to mount straight up the opposite side among boulders that
reached to the belly-bands. At others, it led through a reedy
swamp, or a stony watercourse; or it became a bog; or dived through
a creek. Where the ground was flat and treeless, it was a rutty,
well-worn track between two seas of pale, scant grass.</p>

<p>More than once, complaining of a mouth like sawdust, Purdy
alighted and limped across the verandah of a
house-of-accommodation; but they did not actually draw rein till,
towards midday, they reached a knot of weatherboard verandahed
stores, smithies and public-houses, arranged at the four Corners of
two cross-roads. Here they made a substantial luncheon; and the
odour of fried onions carried far and wide. Mahony paid his three
shillings for a bottle of ale; but Purdy washed down the steak with
cup after cup of richly sugared tea.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon they set off again, revived and
refreshed. Purdy caught at a bunch of aromatic leaves and burst
into a song; and Mahony...Good God! With a cloudless sky overhead,
a decent bit of horseflesh between his knees, and the prospect of a
three days' holiday from storekeeping, his name would not have been
what it was if he had for long remained captious, downhearted.
Insufficient sleep, and an empty stomach&mdash;nothing on earth
besides! A fig for his black thoughts! The fact of his being
obliged to spend a few years in the colony would, in the end,
profit him, by widening his experience of the world and his
fellow-men. It was possible to lead a sober, Godfearing life, no
matter in what rude corner of the globe you were
pitchforked.&mdash;And in this mood he was even willing to grant
the landscape a certain charm. Since leaving Ballan the road had
dipped up and down a succession of swelling rises, grass-grown and
untimbered. From the top of these ridges the view was a far one:
you looked straight across undulating waves of country and
intervening forest-land, to where, on the horizon, a long, low
sprawling range of hills lay blue&mdash;cobalt-blue, and painted in
with a sure brush&mdash;against the porcelain-blue of the sky. What
did the washed-out tints of the foliage matter, when, wherever you
turned, you could count on getting these marvellous soft distances,
on always finding a range of blue-veiled hills, lovely and
intangible as a dream?</p>

<p>There was not much traffic to the diggings on a Sunday. And
having come to a level bit of ground, the riders followed a joint
impulse and broke into a canter. As they began to climb again they
fell naturally into one of those familiar talks, full of allusion
and reminiscence, that are only possible between two of a sex who
have lived through part of their green days together.</p>

<p>It began by Purdy referring to the satisfactory fashion in which
he had disposed of his tools, his stretcher-bed, and other effects:
he was not travelling to Melbourne empty-handed.</p>

<p>Mahony rallied him. "You were always a good one at striking a
bargain, my boy! What about: 'Four mivvies for an alley!'&mdash;eh,
Dickybird?"</p>

<p>This related to their earliest meeting, and was a standing joke
between them. Mahony could recall the incident as clearly as though
it had happened yesterday: how the sturdy little apple-cheeked
English boy, with the comical English accent, had suddenly bobbed
up at his side on the way home from school, and in that laughable
sing-song of his, without modulation or emphasis, had offered to
"swop" him, as above.</p>

<p>Purdy laughed and paid him back in kind. "Yes, and the funk you
were in for fear Spiny Tatlow 'ud see us, and peach to the
rest!"</p>

<p>"Yes. What young idiots boys are!"</p>

<p>In thought he added: "And what snobs!" For the breach of
convention&mdash;he was an upper-form boy at the time&mdash;had not
been his sole reason for wishing to shake off his junior. Behind
him, Mahony, when he reached home, closed the door of one of the
largest houses in the most exclusive square in Dublin. Whereas
Purdy lived in a small, common house in a side street. Visits there
had to be paid surreptitiously.</p>

<p>All the same these were frequent&mdash;and for the best of
reasons. Mahony could still see Purdy's plump, red-cheeked English
mother, who was as jolly and happy as her boy, hugging the loaf to
her bosom while she cut round after round of bread and butter and
jam, for two cormorant throats. And the elder boy, long-limbed and
lank, all wrist and ankle, had invariably been the hungrier of the
two; for, on the glossy damask of the big house, often not enough
food was set to satisfy the growing appetites of himself and his
sisters.&mdash;"Dickybird, can't you see us, with our backs to the
wall, in that little yard of yours, trying who could take the
biggest bite?&mdash;or going round the outside: 'Crust first, and
though you burst, By the bones of Davy Jones!' till only a little
island of jam was left?"</p>

<p>Purdy laughed heartily at these and other incidents fished up by
his friend from the well of the years; but he did not take part in
the sport himself. He had not Mahony's gift for recalling detail:
to him past was past. He only became alive and eager when the talk
turned, as it soon did, on his immediate prospects.</p>

<p>This time, to his astonishment, Mahony had had no trouble in
persuading Purdy to quit the diggings. In addition, here was the
boy now declaring openly that what he needed, and must have, was a
fixed and steadily paying job. With this decision Mahony was in
warm agreement, and promised all the help that lay in his
power.</p>

<p>But Purdy was not done; he hummed and hawed and fidgeted; he
took off his hat and looked inside it; he wiped his forehead and
the nape of his neck.</p>

<p>Mahony knew the symptoms. "Come, Dickybird. Spit it out, my
boy!"</p>

<p>"Yes...er...Well, the fact is, Dick, I begin to think it's time
I settled down."</p>

<p>Mahony gave a whistle. "Whew! A lady in the case?"</p>

<p>"That's the chat. Just oblige yours truly by takin' a squint at
this, will you?"</p>

<p>He handed his friend a squarely-folded sheet of thinnest blue
paper, with a large purple stamp in one corner, and a red seal on
the back. Opening it Mahony discovered three crossed pages, written
in a delicately pointed, minute, Italian hand.</p>

<p>He read the letter to the end, deliberately, and with a growing
sense of relief: composition, expression and penmanship, all met
with his approval. "This is the writing of a person of some
refinement, my son."</p>

<p>"Well, er...yes," said Purdy. He seemed about to add a further
word, then swallowed it, and went on: "Though, somehow or other,
Till's different to herself, on paper. But she's the best of girls,
Dick. Not one o' your ethereal, die-away, bread-and-butter misses.
There's something <i>of</i> Till there is, and she's always on for
a lark. I never met such girls for larks as her and 'er sister. The
very last time I was there, they took and hung up...me and some
other fellers had been stoppin' up a bit late the night before, and
kickin' up a bit of a shindy, and what did those girls do? They got
the barman to come into my room while I was asleep, and hang a
bucket o' water to one of the beams over the bed. Then I'm blamed
if they didn't tie a string from it to my big toe! I gives a kick,
down comes the bucket and half drowns me.&mdash;Gosh, how those
girls did laugh!"</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Mahony dubiously; while Purdy in his turn chewed the
cud of a pleasant memory.&mdash;"Well, I for my part should be glad
to see you married and settled, with a good wife always beside
you."</p>

<p>"That's just the rub," said Purdy, and vigorously scratched his
head.</p>

<p>"Till's a first-class girl as a sweetheart and all that; but
when I come to think of puttin' my head in the noose, from now till
doomsday&mdash;why then, somehow, I can't bring myself to pop the
question."</p>

<p>"There's going to be no trifling with the girl's feelings, I
hope, sir?"</p>

<p>"Bosh! But I say, Dick, I wish you'd turn your peepers on 'er
and tell me what you make of 'er. She's A1 'erself, but she's got a
mother...By Job, Dick, if I thought Tilly 'ud ever get like
that...and they're exactly the same build, too."</p>

<p>It would certainly be well for him to inspect Purdy's flame,
thought Mahony. Especially since the anecdote told did not bear out
the good impression left by the letter&mdash;went far, indeed, to
efface it. Still, he was loath to extend his absence by spending a
night at Geelong, where, a, it came out, the lady lived; and he
replied evasively that it must depend on the speed with which he
could put through his business in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Purdy was silent for a time. Then, with a side-glance at his
companion, he volunteered: "I say, Dick, I know some one who'd suit
you."</p>

<p>"The deuce you do!" said Mahony, and burst out laughing. "Miss
Tilly's sister, no doubt?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;not her. Jinn's all right, but she's not your
sort. But they've got a girl living with 'em&mdash;a sort o' poor
relation, or something&mdash;and she's a horse of quite another
colour.&mdash;I say, old man, serious now, have you never thought
o' gettin' spliced?"</p>

<p>Again Mahony laughed. At his companion's words there descended
to him, once more, from some shadowy distance, some pure height,
the rose-tinted vision of the wife-to-be which haunts every man's
youth. And, in ludicrous juxtaposition, he saw the women, the only
women he had encountered since coming to the colony: the
hardworking, careworn wives of diggers; the harridans, sluts and
prostitutes who made up the balance.</p>

<p>He declined to be drawn. "Is it old Moll Flannigan or one of her
darlints you'd be wishing me luck to, ye spalpeen?"</p>

<p>"Man, don't I say I've <i>found</i> the wife for you?" Purdy was
not jesting, and did not join in the fresh salvo of laughter with
which Mahony greeted his words. "Oh, blow it, Dick, you're too
fastidious&mdash;too damned particular! Say what you like, there's
good in all of 'em&mdash;even in old Mother Flannigan
'erself&mdash;and 'specially when she's got a drop inside 'er.
Fuddle old Moll a bit, and she'd give you the very shift off her
back.&mdash;Don't I thank the Lord, that's all, I'm not built like
you! Why, the woman isn't born I can't get on with. All's fish that
comes to my net.&mdash;Oh, to be young, Dick, and to love the
girls! To see their little waists, and their shoulders, and the
dimples in their cheeks! See 'em put up their hands to their
bonnets, and how their little feet peep out when the wind blows
their petticoats against their legs!" and Purdy rose in his
stirrups and stretched himself, in an excess of wellbeing.</p>

<p>"You young reprobate!"</p>

<p>"Bah!&mdash;you! You've got water in your veins."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort! Set me among decent women and there's no
company I enjoy more," declared Mahony.</p>

<p>"Fish-blood, fish-blood!&mdash;Dick, it's my belief you were
born old."</p>

<p>Mahony was still young enough to be nettled by doubts cast on
his vitality. Purdy laughed in his sleeve. Aloud he said: "Well,
look here, old man, I'll lay you a wager. I bet you you're not
game, when you see that tulip I've been tellin' you about, to take
her in your arms and kiss her. A fiver on it!"</p>

<p>"Done!" cried Mahony. "And I'll have it in one note, if you
please!"</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried Purdy. "Bravo, Dick!" And having gained his end,
and being on a good piece of road between post-and-rail fences, he
set spurs to his horse and cantered off, singing as he went:</p>

<p>She wheels a wheelbarrow,<br>
Through streets wide and narrow,<br>
Crying cockles, and mussels,<br>
Alive, alive-oh!</p>

<p>But the sun was growing large in the western sky; on the ground
to the left, their failing shadows slanted out lengthwise; those
cast by the horses' bodies were mounted on high spindle-legs. The
two men ceased their trifling, and nudged by the fall of day began
to ride at a more business-like pace, pushing forward through the
deep basin of Bacchus's marsh, and on for miles over wide, treeless
plains, to where the road was joined by the main highway from the
north, coming down from Mount Alexander and the Bendigo. Another
hour, and from a gentle eminence the buildings of Melbourne were
visible, the mastheads of the many vessels riding at anchor in
Hobson's Bay. Here, too, the briny scent of the sea, carrying up
over grassy flats, met their nostrils, and set Mahony hungrily
sniffing. The brief twilight came and went, and it was already
night when they urged their weary beasts over the Moonee ponds, a
winding chain of brackish waterholes. The horses shambled along the
broad, hilly tracks of North Melbourne; warily picked their steps
through the city itself. Dingy oil-lamps, set here and there at the
corners of roads so broad that you could hardly see across them,
shed but a meagre light, and the further the riders advanced, the
more difficult became their passage: the streets, in process of
laying, were heaped with stones and intersected by trenches.
Finally, dismounting, they thrust their arms through their bridles,
and laboriously covered the last half-mile of the journey on foot.
Having lodged the horses at a livery-stable, they repaired to a
hotel in Little Collins Street. Here Purdy knew the proprietor, and
they were fortunate enough to secure a small room for the use of
themselves alone.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-1-5" id="ch-1-1-5"></a>Chapter V</h3>

<p>Melbourne is built on two hills and the valley that lies
between.</p>

<p>It was over a year since Mahony or Purdy had been last in the
capital, and next morning, on stepping out of the "Adam and Eve,"
they walked up the eastern slope to look about them. From the
summit of the hill their view stretched to the waters of the Bay,
and its forest of masts. The nearer foreground was made up of mud
flats, through which a sluggish, coffee-coloured river wound its
way to the sea. On the horizon to the north, the Dandenong Ranges
rose storm-blue and distinct, and seemed momently to be drawing
nearer; for a cold wind was blowing, which promised rain. The
friends caught their glimpses of the landscape between dense clouds
of white dust, which blotted everything out for minutes at a time,
and filled eyes, nose, ears with a gritty powder.</p>

<p>Tiring of this they turned and descended Great Collins
Street&mdash;a spacious thoroughfare that dipped into the hollow
and rose again, and was so long that on its western height
pedestrians looked no bigger than ants. In the heart of the city
men were everywhere at work, laying gas and drain-pipes,
macadamising, paving, kerbing: no longer would the old wives' tale
be credited of the infant drowned in the deeps of Swanston Street,
or of the bullock which sank, inch by inch, before its owner's eyes
in the Elizabeth Street bog. Massive erections of freestone were
going up alongside here a primitive, canvas-fronted dwelling, there
one formed wholly of galvanised iron. Fashionable shops, two
storeys high, stood next tiny, dilapidated weatherboards. In the
roadway, handsome chaises, landaus, four-in-hands made room for
bullock-teams, eight and ten strong; for tumbrils carrying water or
refuse&mdash;or worse; for droves of cattle, mobs of wild colts
bound for auction, flocks of sheep on their way to be boiled down
for tallow. Stock-riders and bull-punchers rubbed shoulders with
elegants in skirted coats and shepherd's plaid trousers, who
adroitly skipped heaps of stones and mortar, or crept along the
narrow edging of kerb.</p>

<p>The visitors from up-country paused to listen to a brass band
that played outside a horse-auction mart; to watch the shooting in
a rifle-gallery. The many decently attired females they met also
called for notice. Not a year ago, and no reputable woman walked
abroad oftener than she could help: now, even at this hour, the
streets were starred with them. Purdy, open-mouthed, his eyes
a-dance, turned his head this way and that, pointed and exclaimed.
But then <i>he</i> had slept like a log, and felt in his own words
"as fit as a fiddle." Whereas Mahony had sat his horse the whole
night through, had never ceased to balance himself in an imaginary
saddle. And when at daybreak he had fallen into a deeper sleep, he
was either reviewing outrageous females on Purdy's behalf, or
accepting wagers to kiss them.</p>

<p>Hence, diverting as were the sights of the city, he did not come
to them with the naive receptivity of Purdy. It was, besides, hard
to detach his thoughts from the disagreeable affair that had
brought him to Melbourne. And as soon as banks and offices began to
take down their shutters, he hurried off to his interview with the
carrying-agent.</p>

<p>The latter's place of business was behind Great Collins Street,
in a lane reached by a turnpike. Found with some trouble, it proved
to be a rude shanty wedged in between a Chinese laundry and a
Chinese eating-house. The entrance was through a yard in which
stood a collection of rabbit-hutches, while further back gaped a
dirty closet. At the sound of their steps the man they sought
emerged, and Mahony could not repress an exclamation of surprise.
When, a little over a twelvemonth ago, he had first had dealings
with him, this Bolliver had been an alert and respectable man of
business. Now he was evidently on the downgrade; and the cause of
the deterioration was advertised in his bloodshot eyeballs and
veinous cheeks. Early as was the hour, he had already been
indulging: his breath puffed sour. Mahony prepared to state the
object of his visit in no uncertain terms. But his preliminaries
were cut short by a volley of abuse. The man accused him
point-blank of having been privy to the rascally drayman's fraud
and of having hoped, by lying low, to evade his liability. Mahony
lost his temper, and vowed that he would have Bolliver up for
defamation of character. To which the latter retorted that the
first innings in a court of law would be his: he had already put
the matter in the hands of his attorney. This was the last straw.
Purdy had to intervene and get Mahony away. They left the agent
shaking his fist after them and cursing the bloody day on which
he'd ever been fool enough to do a deal with a bloody
gentleman.</p>

<p>At the corner of the street the friends paused for a hasty
conference. Mahony was for marching off to take the best legal
advice the city had to offer. But Purdy disapproved. Why put
himself to so much trouble, when he had old Ocock's recommendation
to his lawyer-son in his coat pocket? What, in the name of
Leary-cum-Fitz, was the sense of making an enemy for life of the
old man, his next-door neighbour, and a good customer to boot?</p>

<p>These counsels prevailed, and they turned their steps towards
Chancery Lane, where was to be found every variety of legal
practitioner from barrister to scrivener. Having matched the
house-number and descried the words: "Mr. Henry Ocock, Conveyancer
and Attorney, Commissioner of Affidavits," painted black on two
dusty windows, they climbed a wooden stair festooned with cobwebs,
to a landing where an injunction to: "Push and Enter!" was, rudely
inked on a sheet of paper and affixed to a door.</p>

<p>Obeying, they passed into a dingy little room, the entire
furnishing of which consisted of a couple of deal tables, with a
chair to each. These were occupied by a young man and a boy,
neither of whom rose at their entrance. The lad was cutting notches
in a stick and whistling tunefully; the clerk, a young fellow in
the early twenties, who had a mop of flaming red hair and
small-slit white-lashed eyes, looked at the strangers, but without
lifting his head: his eyes performed the necessary motion.</p>

<p>Mahony desired to know if he had the pleasure of addressing Mr.
Henry Ocock. In reply the red-head gave a noiseless laugh, which he
immediately quenched by clapping his hand over his mouth, and
shutting one eye at his junior said: "No&mdash;nor yet the Shar o'
Persia, nor Alphybetical Foster!&mdash;What can I do for you,
governor?"</p>

<p>"You can have the goodness to inform Mr. Ocock that I wish to
see him!" flashed back Mahony.</p>

<p>"Singin' til-ril-i-tum-tum-dee-ay!&mdash;Now then, Mike, me
child, toddle!"</p>

<p>With patent reluctance the boy ceased his whittling, and dawdled
across the room to an inner door through which he vanished, having
first let his knuckles bump, as if by chance, against the wood of
the panel. A second later he reappeared. "Boss's engaged." But
Mahony surprised a lightning sign between the pair.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I decline to state my business to anyone but Mr. Ocock
himself!" he declared hotly, in response to the red-haired man's
invitation to "get it off his chest." "If you choose to find out
when he will be at liberty, I will wait so long&mdash;no
longer."</p>

<p>As the office-boy had somehow failed to hit his seat on his
passage to the outer door, there was nothing left for the clerk to
do but himself to undertake the errand. He lounged up from his
chair, and, in his case without even the semblance of a knock,
squeezed through a foot wide aperture, in such a fashion that the
two strangers should not catch a glimpse of what was going on
inside. But his voice came to them through the thin partition. "Oh,
just a couple o' stony-broke Paddylanders." Mahony, who had seized
the opportunity to dart an angry glance at Purdy, which should say:
"This is what one gets by coming to your second-rate pettifoggers!"
now let his eyes rest on his friend and critically detailed the
latter's appearance. The description fitted to a nicety. Purdy did
in truth look down on his luck. Unkempt, bearded to the eyes, there
he stood clutching his shapeless old cabbage-tree, in mud-stained
jumper and threadbare smalls&mdash;the very spit of the
unsuccessful digger. Well might they be suspected of not owning the
necessary to pay their way!</p>

<p>"All serene, mister! The boss'ull take you on."</p>

<p>The sanctum was a trifle larger than the outer room, but almost
equally bare; half-a-dozen deed-boxes were piled up in one corner.
Stalking in with his chin in the air, Mahony found himself in the
presence of a man of his own age, who sat absorbed in the study of
a document. At their entry two beady grey eyes lifted to take a
brief but thorough survey, and a hand with a pencil in it pointed
to the single empty chair. Mahony declined to translate the gesture
and remained standing.</p>

<p>Under the best of circumstances it irked him to be kept waiting.
Here, following on the clerk's saucy familiarity, the wilful delay
made his gorge rise. For a few seconds he fumed in silence; then,
his patience exhausted, he burst out: "My time, sir, is as precious
as your own. With your permission, I will take my business
elsewhere."</p>

<p>At these words, and at the tone in which they were spoken, the
lawyer's head shot up as if he had received a blow under the chin.
Again he narrowed his eyes at the couple. And this time he laid the
document from him and asked suavely: "What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>The change in his manner though slight was unmistakable. Mahony
had a nice ear for such refinements, and responded to the shade of
difference with the promptness of one who had been on the watch for
it. His irritation fell; he was ready on the instant to be
propitiated. Putting his hat aside he sat down, and having
introduced himself, made reference to Ballarat and his acquaintance
with the lawyer's father: "Who directed me to you, sir, for advice
on a vexatious affair, in which I have had the misfortune to become
involved."</p>

<p>With a "Pray be seated!" Ocock rose and cleared a chair for
Purdy. Resuming his seat he joined his hands, and wound them in and
out. "I think you may take it from me that no case is so
unpromising but what we shall be able to find a loophole."</p>

<p>Mahony thanked him&mdash;with a touch of reserve. "I trust you
will still be of that opinion when you have heard the facts." And
went on: "Myself, I do not doubt it. I am not a rich man, but
serious though the monetary loss would be to me, I should settle
the matter out of court, were I not positive that I had right on my
side." To which Ocock returned a quick: "Oh, quite so...of
course."</p>

<p>Like his old father, he was a short, heavily built man; but
there the likeness ended. He had a high, domed forehead, above a
thin, hooked nose. His skin was of an almost Jewish pallor. Fringes
of straight, jet-black hair grew down the walls of his cheeks and
round his chin, meeting beneath it. The shaven upper lid was long
and flat, with no central markings, and helped to form a mouth that
had not much more shape or expression than a slit cut by a knife in
a sheet of paper. The chin was bare to the size of a crown-piece;
and, both while he spoke and while he listened to others speaking,
the lawyer caressed this patch with his finger-tips; so that in the
course of time it had arrived at a state of high polish&mdash;like
the shell of an egg.</p>

<p>The air with which he heard his new client out was of a
non-committal kind; and Mahony, having talked his first heat off,
grew chilled by the wet blanket of Ocock's silence. There was
nothing in this of the frank responsiveness with which your
ordinary mortal lends his ear. The brain behind the dome was, one
might be sure, adding, combining, comparing, and drawing its own
conclusions. Why should lawyers, he wondered, treat those who came
to them like children, advancing only in so far as it suited them
out of the darkness where they housed among strangely worded
paragraphs and obscure formulas?&mdash;But these musings were cut
short. Having fondled his chin for a further moment, Ocock looked
up and put a question. And, while he could not but admire the
lawyer's acumen, this did not lessen Mahony's discomfort. All
unguided, it went straight for what he believed to be the one weak
spot in his armour. It related to the drayman. Contrary to custom
Mahony had, on this occasion, himself recommended the driver. And,
as he admitted it, his ears rang again with the plaints of his
stranded fellow-countryman, a wheedler from the South Country, off
whose tongue the familiar brogue had dripped like honey. His
recommendation, he explained, had been made out of charity; he had
not forced the agent to engage the man; and it would surely be a
gross injustice if he alone were to be held responsible.</p>

<p>To his relief Ocock did not seem to attach importance to the
fact, but went on to ask whether any written agreement had existed
between the parties. "No writing? H'm! So...so!" To read his
thoughts was an impossibility; but as he proceeded with his
catechism it was easy to see how his interest in the case grew. He
began to treat it tenderly; warmed to it, as an artist to his work;
and Mahony's spirits rose in consequence.</p>

<p>Having selected a number of minor points that would tell in
their favour, Ocock dilated upon the libellous aspersion that had
been cast on Mahony's good faith. "My experience has invariably
been this, Mr. Mahony: people who suggest that kind of thing, and
accuse others of it, are those who are accustomed to make use of
such means themselves. In this case, there may have been no goods
at all&mdash;the thing may prove to have been a put-up job from
beginning to end."</p>

<p>But his hearer's start of surprise was too marked to be
overlooked. "Well, let us take the existence of the goods for
granted. But might they not, being partly of a perishable nature,
have gone bad or otherwise got spoiled on the road, and not have
been in a fit condition for you to receive at your end?"</p>

<p>This was credible; Mahony nodded his assent. He also added,
gratuitously, that he had before now been obliged to reclaim on
casks of mouldy mess-pork. At which Ocock ceased coddling his chin
to point a straight forefinger at him, with a triumphant: "You
see!"&mdash;But Purdy who, sick and tired of the discussion, had
withdrawn to the window to watch the rain zig-zag in runlets down
the dusty panes, and hiss and spatter on the sill; Purdy puckered
his lips to a sly and soundless whistle.</p>

<p>The interview at an end, Ocock mentioned, in his frigidly urbane
way, that he had recently been informed there was an excellent
opening for a firm of solicitors in Ballarat: could Mr. Mahony, as
a resident, confirm the report? Mahony regretted his ignorance, but
spoke in praise of the Golden City and its assured
future.&mdash;"This would be most welcome news to your father, sir.
I can picture his satisfaction on hearing it."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Golly, Dick, that's no mopoke!" was Purdy's comment as
they emerged into the rain-swept street. "A crafty devil, if ever I
see'd one."</p>

<p>"Henry Ocock seems to me to be a singularly able man," replied
Mahony drily. To his thinking, Purdy had cut a poor figure during
the visit: he had said no intelligent word, but had lounged
lumpishly in his chair&mdash;the very picture of the country man
come up to the metropolis&mdash;and, growing tired of this, had
gone like a restless child to thrum his fingers on the panes.</p>

<p>"Oh, you bet! He'll slither you through."</p>

<p>"What? Do you insinuate there's any need for slithering...as you
call it?" cried Mahony.</p>

<p>"Why, Dick, old man...And as long as he gets you through, what
does it matter?"</p>

<p>"It matters to me, sir!"</p>

<p>The rain, a tropical deluge, was over by the time they reached
the hollow. The sun shone again, hot and sticky, and people were
venturing forth from their shelters to wade through beds of mud, or
to cross, on planks, the deep, swift rivers formed by the open
drains. There were several such cloud-bursts in the course of the
afternoon; and each time the refuse of the city was whirled past on
the flood, to be left as an edging to the footpaths when the water
went down.</p>

<p>Mahony spent the rest of the day in getting together a fresh
load of goods. For, whether he lost or won his suit, the store had
to be restocked without delay.</p>

<p>That evening towards eight o'clock the two men turned out of the
Lowther Arcade. The night was cold, dark and wet; and they had
wound comforters round their bare throats. They were on their way
to the Mechanics' Hall, to hear a lecture on Mesmerism. Mahony had
looked forward to this all through the sorry job of choosing soaps
and candles. The subject piqued his curiosity. It was the one drop
of mental stimulant he could hope to extract from his visit. The
theatre was out of the question: if none of the actors happened to
be drunk, a fair proportion of the audience was sure to be.</p>

<p>Part of his pleasure this evening was due to Purdy having agreed
to accompany him. It was always a matter of regret to Mahony that,
outside the hobnob of daily life, he and his friend had so few
interests in common; that Purdy should rest content with the coarse
diversions of the ordinary digger.</p>

<p>Then, from the black shadows of the Arcade, a woman's form
detached itself, and a hand was laid on Purdy's arm.</p>

<p>"Shout us a drink, old pal!"</p>

<p>Mahony made a quick, repellent movement of the shoulder. But
Purdy, some vagrom fancy quickened in him, either by the voice,
which was not unrefined, or by the stealthiness of the approach,
Purdy turned to look.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my boy. We've no time to lose."</p>

<p>Without raising her pleasant voice, the woman levelled a volley
of abuse at Mahony, then muttered a word in Purdy's ear.</p>

<p>"Just half a jiff, Dick," said Purdy. "Or go ahead.&mdash;I'll
make up on you."</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour Mahony aired his heels in front of a
public-house. Then he gave it up, and went on his way. But his
pleasure was damped: the inconsiderateness with which Purdy could
shake him off, always had a disconcerting effect on him. To face
the matter squarely: the friendship between them did not mean as
much to Purdy as to him; the sudden impulse that had made the boy
relinquish a promising clerkship to emigrate in his wake&mdash;into
this he had read more than it would hold.&mdash;And, as he picked
his muddy steps, Mahony agreed with himself that the net result,
for him, of Purdy's coming to the colony, had been to saddle him
with a new responsibility. It was his lot for ever to be helping
the lad out of tight places. Sometimes it made him feel
unnecessarily bearish. For Purdy had the knack, common to sunny,
improvident natures, of taking everything that was done for him for
granted. His want of delicacy in this respect was distressing. Yet,
in spite of it all, it was hard to bear him a grudge for long
together. A well-meaning young beggar if ever there was one! That
very day how faithfully he had stuck at his side, assisting at dull
discussions and duller purchasings, without once obtruding his own
concerns.&mdash;And here Mahony remembered their talk on the ride
to town. Purdy had expressed the wish to settle down and take a
wife. A poor friend that would be who did not back him up in this
intention.</p>

<p>As he sidled into one of the front benches of a half-empty
hall&mdash;the mesmerist, a corpse-like man in black, already
surveyed its thinness from the platform with an air of pained
surprise&mdash;Mahony decided that Purdy should have his chance.
The heavy rains of the day, and the consequent probable flooding of
the Ponds and the Marsh, would serve as an excuse for a change of
route. He would go and have a look at Purdy's sweetheart; would
ride back to the diggings by way of Geelong.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-1-6" id="ch-1-1-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>In a whitewashed parlour of "Beamish's Family Hotel" some few
miles north of Geelong, three young women, in voluminous skirts and
with their hair looped low over their ears, sat at work. Books lay
open on the table before two of them; the third was making a
bookmark. Two were fair, plump, rosy, and well over twenty; the
third, pale-skinned and dark, was still a very young girl. She it
was who stitched magenta hieroglyphics on a strip of perforated
cardboard.</p>

<p>"Do lemme see, Poll," said the eldest of the trio, and laid down
her pen. "You <i>'ave</i> bin quick about it, my dear."</p>

<p>Polly, the brunette, freed her needle of silk and twirled the
bookmark by its ribbon ends. Spinning, the mystic characters united
to form the words: "Kiss me quick."</p>

<p>Her companions tittered. "If ma didn't know for certain 'twas
meant for your brother John, she'd never 'ave let you make it,"
said the second blonde, whose name was Jinny.</p>

<p>"Girls, what a lark it 'ud be to send it up to Purdy Smith, by
Ned!" said the first speaker.</p>

<p>Polly blushed. "Fy, Tilly! That wouldn't be ladylike."</p>

<p>Tilly's big bosom rose and fell in a sigh. "What's a lark never
is."</p>

<p>Jinny giggled, agreeably scandalized: "What things you do say.
Till! Don't let ma 'ear you, that's all."</p>

<p>"Ma be blowed!&mdash;'Ow does this look now, Polly?" And across
the wax-cloth Tilly pushed a copybook, in which she had laboriously
inscribed a prim maxim the requisite number of times.</p>

<p>Polly laid down her work and knitted her brows over the
page.</p>

<p>"Well...it's better than the last one, Tilly," she said gently,
averse to hurting her pupil's feelings. "But still not quite good
enough. The f's, look, should be more like this." And taking a
steel pen she made several long-tailed f's, in a tiny, pointed
hand.</p>

<p>Tilly yielded an ungrudging admiration. "'Ow well you do it,
Poll! But I <i>hate</i> writing. If only ma weren't so set on
it!"</p>

<p>"You'll never be able to write yourself to a certain person,
'oos name I won't mention, if you don't 'urry up and learn," said
Jinny, looking sage.</p>

<p>"What's the odds! We've always got Poll to write for us," gave
back Tilly, and lazily stretched out a large, plump hand to recover
the copybook. "A certain person'll never know&mdash;or not till
it's too late."</p>

<p>"Here, Polly dear," said Jinny, and held out a book. "I know it
now."</p>

<p>Again Polly put down her embroidery. She took the book.
"Plough!" said she.</p>

<p>"Plough?" echoed Jinny vaguely, and turned a pair of soft,
cow-like brown eyes on the blowflies sitting sticky and sleepy
round the walls of the room. "Wait a jiff...lemme think! Plough?
Oh, yes, I know. P-l..."</p>

<p>"P-l-o" prompted Polly, the speller coming to a full stop.</p>

<p>"P-l-o-w!" shot out Jinny, in triumph.</p>

<p>"Not <i>quite</i> right," said Polly. "It's g-h, Jinny:
p-l-o-u-g-h."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's what I meant. I knew it right enough."</p>

<p>"Well, now, trough!"</p>

<p>"Trough?" repeated Jinny, in the same slow, vacant way.</p>

<p>"Trough? Wait, lemme think a minute. T-r-o..."</p>

<p>Polly's lips all but formed the "u," to prevent the "f" she felt
impending. "I'm afraid you'll have to take it again, Jinny dear,"
she said reluctantly, as nothing further was forthcoming.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Poll. T-r-o-" began Jinny with fresh vigour. But before
she could add a fourth to the three letters, a heavy foot pounded
down the passage, and a stout woman, out of breath, her cap-bands
flying, came bustling in and slammed the door.</p>

<p>"Girls, girls, now whatever d'ye think? 'Ere's Purdy Smith come
ridin' inter the yard, an' another gent with 'im. Scuttle along
now, an' put them books away!&mdash;Tilda, yer net's 'alf 'angin'
off&mdash;you don't want yer sweet-'eart to see you all untidy like
that, do you?&mdash;'Elp 'em, Polly my dear, and be quick about
it!&mdash;H'out with yer sewin', chicks!"</p>

<p>Sprung up from their seats the three girls darted to and fro.
The telltale spelling and copy-books were flung into the drawer of
the chiffonier, and the key was turned on them. Polly, her immodest
sampler safely hidden at the bottom of her workbox, was the most
composed of the three; and while locks were smoothed and collars
adjusted in the adjoining bedroom, she remained behind to look out
thimbles, needles and strips of plain sewing, and to lay them
naturally about the table.</p>

<p>The blonde sisters reappeared, all aglow with excitement. Tilly,
in particular, was in a sad flutter.</p>

<p>"Girls, I simply <i>can't</i> face 'im in 'ere!" she declared.
"It was 'ere, in this very room, that 'e first&mdash;you know
what!"</p>

<p>"Nor can I," cried Jinny, catching the fever.</p>

<p>"Feel my 'eart, 'ow it beats," said her sister, pressing her
hands, one over the other, to her full left breast.</p>

<p>"Mine's every bit as bad," averred Jinny.</p>

<p>"I believe I shall 'ave the palpitations and faint away, if I
stop 'ere."</p>

<p>Polly was genuinely concerned. "I'll run and call mother
back."</p>

<p>"No, I tell you what: let's 'ide!" cried Tilly, recovering.</p>

<p>Jinny wavered. "But will they find us?"</p>

<p>"Duffer! Of course. Ma'll give 'em the 'int.&mdash;Come on!"</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, and imitated by her sister, she
scrambled over the window sill to the verandah. Polly found herself
alone. Her conscientious scrupling: "But mother may be cross!" had
passed unheeded. Now, she, too, fell into a flurry. She could not
remain there, by herself, to meet two young men, one of whom was a
stranger: steps and voices were already audible at the end of the
passage. And so, since there was nothing else for it, she clambered
after her friends&mdash;though with difficulty; for she was not
very tall.</p>

<p>This was why, when Mrs. Beamish flourished open the door,
exclaiming in a hearty tone: "An' 'ere you'll find 'em,
gents&mdash;sittin' at their needles, busy as bees!" the most
conspicuous object in the room was a very neat leg, clad in a white
stocking and black prunella boot, which was just being drawn up
over the sill. It flashed from sight; and the patter of running
feet beat the floor of the verandah.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, too late! The birds have flown," laughed Purdy, and
smacked his thigh.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare, an' so they 'ave&mdash;the <i>naughty</i>
creatures!" exclaimed Mrs. Beamish in mock dismay. "But trust you,
Mr. Smith, for sayin' the right thing. Jus' exackly like birds they
are&mdash;so shy an' scared-like. But I'll give you the 'int,
gents. They'll not be far away. Jus' you show 'em two can play at
that game.&mdash;Mr. S., you know the h'arbour!"</p>

<p>"Should say I do! Many's the time I've anchored there," cried
Purdy with a guffaw. "Come, Dick!" And crossing to the window he
straddled over the frame, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Reluctantly Mahony followed him.</p>

<p>From the verandah they went down into the vegetable-garden,
where the drab and tangled growths that had outlived the summer
were beaten flat by the recent rains. At the foot of the garden,
behind a clump of gooseberry-bushes, stood an arbour formed of a
yellow buddleia. No trace of a petticoat was visible, so thick was
the leafage; but a loud whispering and tittering betrayed the
fugitives.</p>

<p>At the apparition of the young men, who stooped to the low
entrance, there was a cascade of shrieks.</p>

<p>"Oh, lor, <i>'ow</i> you frightened me! 'Owever did you know we
were 'ere?"</p>

<p>"You wicked fellow! Get away, will you! I 'ate the very sight of
you!"&mdash;this from Tilly, as Purdy, his hands on her hips, gave
her a smacking kiss.</p>

<p>The other girls feared a like greeting; there were more squeaks
and squeals, and some ineffectual dives for the doorway. Purdy
spread out his arms. "Hi, look out, stop 'em, Dick! Now then, man,
here's your chance!"</p>

<p>Mahony stood blinking; it was dusk inside, after the dazzle of
the sun. At this reminder of the foolish bet he had taken, he
hurriedly seized the young woman who was next him, and embraced
her. It chanced to be Jinny. She screamed, and made a feint of
feeling mortally outraged. Mahony had to dodge a box on the
ears.</p>

<p>But Purdy burst into a horselaugh, and held his sides. Without
knowing why, Tilly joined in, and Jinny, too, was infected. When
Purdy could speak, he blurted out: "Dick, you fathead!&mdash;you
jackass!&mdash;you've mugged the wrong one."</p>

<p>At this clownish mirth, Mahony felt the blood boil up over ears
and temples. For an instant he stood irresolute. Did he admit the
blunder, his victim would be hurt. Did he deny it, he would save
his own face at the expense of the other young woman's feelings.
So, though he could have throttled Purdy he put a bold front on the
matter.</p>

<p>"<i>Carpe diem</i> is my motto, my boy! I intend to make both
young ladies pay toll."</p>

<p>His words were the signal for a fresh scream and flutter: the
third young person had escaped, and was flying down the path. This
called for chase and capture. She was not very agile but she knew
the ground, which, outside the garden, was rocky and uneven. For a
time, she had Mahony at vantage; his heart was not in the game: in
cutting undignified capers among the gooseberry-bushes he felt as
foolish as a performing dog. Then, however, she caught her toe in
her dress and stumbled. He could not disregard the opportunity; he
advanced upon her.</p>

<p>But two beseeching hands fended him off. "No...no. Please...oh,
<i>please</i>, don't!"</p>

<p>This was no catchpenny coquetry; it was a genuine dread of undue
familiarity. A kindred trait in Mahony's own nature rose to meet
it.</p>

<p>"Certainly not, if it is disagreeable to you. Shall we shake
hands instead?"</p>

<p>Two of the blackest eyes he had ever seen were raised to his,
and a flushed face dimpled. They shook hands, and he offered his
arm.</p>

<p>Halfway to the arbour, they met the others coming to find them.
The girls bore diminutive parasols; and Purdy, in rollicking
spirits, Tilly on one arm, Jinny on the other, held Polly's above
his head. On the appearance of the laggards, Jinny, who had put her
own interpretation on the misplaced kiss, prepared to free her arm;
but Purdy, winking at his friend, squeezed it to his side and held
her prisoner.</p>

<p>Tilly buzzed a word in his ear.</p>

<p>"Yes, by thunder!" he ejaculated; and letting go of his
companions, he spun round like a ballet-dancer. "Ladies! Let me
introduce to you my friend, Dr. Richard Townshend-Mahony, F.R.C.S.,
M.D., Edinburgh, at present proprietor of the 'Diggers' Emporium,'
Dead Dog Hill, Ballarat. &mdash;Dick, my hearty, Miss Tilly
Beamish, world-famed for her sauce; Miss Jinny, renowned for her
skill in casting the eyes of sheep; and, last but not least, pretty
little Polly Perkins, alias Miss Polly Turnham, whose good deeds
put those of Dorcas to the blush."</p>

<p>The Misses Beamish went into fits of laughter, and Tilly hit
Purdy over the back with her parasol.</p>

<p>But the string of letters had puzzled them, roused their
curiosity.</p>

<p>"What'n earth do they mean?&mdash;Gracious! So clever! It makes
me feel quite queer."</p>

<p>"Y'ought to 'ave told us before 'and, Purd, so's we could 'ave
studied up."</p>

<p>However, a walk to a cave was under discussion, and Purdy urged
them on. "Phoebus is on the wane, girls. And it's going to be damn
cold to-night."</p>

<p>Once more with the young person called Polly as companion,
Mahony followed after. He walked in silence, listening to the
rattle of the three in front. At best he was but a poor hand at the
kind of repartee demanded of their swains by these young women; and
to-day his slender talent failed him altogether, crushed by the
general tone of vulgar levity. Looking over at the horizon, which
swam in a kind of gold-dust haze below the sinking sun, he smiled
thinly to himself at Purdy's ideas of wiving.</p>

<p>Reminded he was not alone by feeling the hand on his arm
tremble, he glanced down at his companion; and his eye was arrested
by a neatly parted head, of the glossiest black imaginable.</p>

<p>He pulled himself together. "Your cousins are excellent
walkers."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, very. But they are not my cousins."</p>

<p>Mahony pricked up his ears. "But you live here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I help moth...Mrs. Beamish in the house."</p>

<p>But as if, with this, she had said too much, she grew
tongue-tied again; and there was nothing more to be made of her.
Taking pity on her timidity, Mahony tried to put her at ease by
talking about himself. He described his life on the diggings and
the straits to which he was at times reduced: the buttons affixed
to his clothing by means of gingerbeer-bottle wire; his periodic
onslaughts on sock-darning; the celebrated pudding it had taken him
over four hours to make. And Polly, listening to him, forgot her
desire to run away. Instead, she could not help laughing at the
tales of his masculine shiftlessness. But as soon as they came in
view of the others, Tilly and Purdy sitting under one parasol on a
rock by the cave, Jinny standing and looking out rather
aggressively after the loiterers, she withdrew her arm.</p>

<p>"Moth...Mrs. Beamish will need me to help her with tea.
And...and <i>would</i> you please walk back with Jinny?"</p>

<p>Before he could reply, she had turned and was hurrying away.</p>

<p>They got home from the cave at sundown, he with the ripe Jinny
hanging a dead weight on his arm, to find tea spread in the private
parlour. The table was all but invisible under its load; and their
hostess looked as though she had been parboiled on her own kitchen
fire. She sat and fanned herself with a sheet of newspaper while,
time and again, undaunted by refusals, she pressed the good things
upon her guests. There were juicy beefsteaks piled high with rings
of onion, and a barracoota, and a cold leg of mutton. There were
apple-pies and jam-tarts, a dish of curds-and-whey and a jug of
custard. Butter and bread were fresh and new; scones and cakes had
just left the oven; and the great cups of tea were tempered by
pure, thick cream.</p>

<p>To the two men who came from diggers' fare: cold chop for
breakfast, cold chop for dinner and cold chop for tea: the meal was
little short of a banquet; and few words were spoken in its course.
But the moment arrived when they could eat no more, and when even
Mrs. Beamish ceased to urge them. Pipes and pouches were produced;
Polly and Jinny rose to collect the plates, Tilly and her beau to
sit on the edge of the verandah: they could be seen in silhouette
against the rising moon, Tilly's head drooping to Purdy's
shoulder.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beamish looked from them to Mahony with a knowing smile,
and whispered behind her hand: "I do wish those two 'ud 'urry up
an' make up their minds, that I do! I'd like to see my Tilda
settled. No offence meant to young Smith. 'E's the best o' good
company. But sometimes...well, I cud jus' knock their 'eads
together when they sit so close, an' say: come, give over yer
spoonin' an' get to business! Either you want one another or you
don't.&mdash;I seen you watchin' our Polly, Mr. Mahony" &mdash;she
made Mahony wince by stressing the second syllable of his name.
"Bless you, no&mdash;no relation whatsoever. She just 'elps a bit
in the 'ouse, an' is company for the girls. We tuck 'er in a year
ago&mdash;'er own relations 'ad played 'er a dirty trick. Mustn't
let 'er catch me sayin' so, though; she won't 'ear a word against
'em, and that's as it should be."</p>

<p>Looking round, and finding Polly absent from the room, she went
on to tell Mahony how Polly's eldest brother, a ten years' resident
in Melbourne, had sent to England for the girl on her leaving
school, to come out and assist in keeping his house. And how an
elder sister, who was governessing in Sydney, had chosen just this
moment to throw up her post and return to quarter herself upon the
brother.</p>

<p>"An' so when Polly gets 'ere&mdash;a little bit of a thing in
short frocks, in charge of the capt'n&mdash;there was no room for
'er, an' she 'ad to look about 'er for somethin' else to do. We
tuck 'er in, an', I will say, I've never regretted it. Indeed I
don't know now, 'ow we ever got on without 'er.&mdash;Yes, it's you
I'm talkin' about, miss, singin' yer praises, an' you needn't get
as red as if you'd bin up to mischief! Pa'll say as much for you,
too."</p>

<p>"That I will!" said Mr. Beamish, opening his mouth for the first
time except to put food in it. "That I will," and he patted Polly's
hand." The man as gits Polly'll git a treasure."</p>

<p>Polly blushed, after the helpless, touching fashion of very
young creatures: the blood stained her cheeks, mounted to her
forehead, spread in a warm wave over neck and ears. To spare her,
Mahony turned his head and looked out of the window. He would have
liked to say: Run away, child, run away, and don't let them see
your confusion. Polly, however, went conscientiously about her
task, and only left the room when she had picked up her full
complement of plates.&mdash;But she did not appear again that
night.</p>

<p>Deserted even by Mrs. Beamish, the two men pushed back their
chairs from the table and drew tranquilly at their pipes.</p>

<p>The innkeeper proved an odd, misty sort of fellow, exceedingly
backward at declaring himself; it was as though each of his heavy
words had to be fetched from a distance. "No doubt about it, it's
the wife that wears the breeches," was Mahony's inward comment. And
as one after another of his well-meant remarks fell flat: "Become
almost a deaf-mute, it would seem, under the eternal female
clacking."</p>

<p>But for each mortal there exists at least one theme to fire him.
In the case of Beamish this turned out to be the Land Question.
Before the gold discovery he had been a bush shepherd, he told
Mahony, and, if he had called the tune, he would have lived and
died one. But the wife had had ambitions, the children were growing
up, and every one knew what it was when women got a maggot in their
heads. There had been no peace for him till he had chucked his
twelve-year-old job and joined the rush to Mount Alexander. But at
heart he had remained a bushman; and he was now all on the side of
the squatters in their tussle with the Crown. He knew a bit, he'd
make bold to say, about the acreage needed in certain districts per
head of sheep; he could tell a tale of the risks and mischances
squatting involved: "If t'aint fire it's flood, an' if the water
passes you by it's the scab or the rot." To his thinking, the
government's attempt to restrict the areas of sheep-runs, and to
give effect to the "fourteen-year-clause" which limited the tenure,
were acts of folly. The gold supply would give out as suddenly as
it had begun; but sheep would graze there till the crack of
doom&mdash;the land was fit for nothing else.</p>

<p>Mahony thought this point of view lopsided. No new country could
hope to develop and prosper without a steady influx of the right
kind of population and this the colony would never have, so long as
the authorities, by refusing to sell them land, made it impossible
for immigrants to settle there. Why, America was but three thousand
miles distant from the old country, compared with Australia's
thirteen thousand, and in America land was to be had in plenty at
five shillings per acre. As to Mr. Beamish's idea of the gold
giving out, the geological formation of the goldfields rendered
that improbable. He sympathised with the squatters, who naturally
enough believed their rights to the land inalienable; but a
government worthy of the name must legislate with an eye to the
future, not for the present alone.</p>

<p>Their talk was broken by long gaps. In these, the resonant voice
of Mrs. Beamish could be heard rebuking and directing her two
handmaidens.</p>

<p>"Now then, Jinny, look alive, an' don't ack like a dyin' duck in
a thunderstorm, or you'll never get back to do <i>your</i> bit o'
spoonin'!&mdash;Save them bones, Polly. Never waste an atom, my
chuck&mdash;remember that, when you've got an 'ouse of your own!
No, girls, I always says, through their stomachs, that's the
shortcut to their 'earts. The rest's on'y fal-de-lal-ing."&mdash;On
the verandah, in face of the vasty, star-spangled night, Tilly's
head had found its resting-place, and an arm lay round her
waist.</p>

<p>"I shall make 'im cut off 'is beard first thing," said Jinny
that night: she was sitting half-undressed on the side of a big
bed, which the three girls shared with one another.</p>

<p>"Um! just you wait and see if it's as easy as you think,"
retorted Tilly from her pillow. Again Purdy had let slip a golden
chance to put the decisive question; and Tilly's temper was short
in consequence.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Dr. Mahony...though I do wonder 'ow 'e ever keeps people
from saying Ma-<i>hon</i>-y," said Jinny dreamily. She, too, had
spent some time in star-gazing, and believed she had ground for
hope.</p>

<p>"Just listen to 'er, will you!" said Tilly angrily. "Upon my
word, Jinny Beamish, if one didn't know you 'ad the 'abit of
marrying yourself off to every fresh cove you meet, one 'ud say you
was downright bold!"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> needn't talk! Every one can see you're as mad as can
be because you can't bring your old dot-and-go-one to the
scratch."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, Jinny" said Polly, grieved at this thrust into
Tilly's open wound.</p>

<p>"Well, it's true.&mdash;Oh, look 'ere now, there's not a drop o'
water in this blessed jug again. 'Oo's week is it to fill it? Tilly
B., it's yours!"</p>

<p>"Serves you right. You can fetch it yourself."</p>

<p>"Think I see myself!"</p>

<p>Polly intervened. "I'll go for it, Jinny."</p>

<p>"What a little duck you are, Poll! But you shan't go alone. I'll
carry the candle."</p>

<p>Tying on a petticoat over her bedgown, Polly took the ewer, and
with Jinny as torch-bearer set forth. There was still some noise in
the public part of the house, beside the bar; but the passage was
bare and quiet. The girls crept mousily past the room occupied by
the two young men, and after several false alarms and suppressed
chirps reached the back door, and filled the jug at the tap of the
galvanised-iron tank.</p>

<p>The return journey was not so successful. Just as they got level
with the visitors' room, they heard feet crossing the floor. Polly
started; the water splashed over the neck of the jug, and fell with
a loud plop. At this Jinny lost her head and ran off with the
candle. Polly, in a panic of fright, dived into the pantry with her
burden, and crouched down behind a tub of fermenting
gingerbeer.&mdash;And sure enough, a minute after, the door of the
room opposite was flung open and a pair of jackboots landed in the
passage.</p>

<p>Nor was this the worst: the door was not shut again but remained
ajar. Through the chink, Polly, shrunk to her smallest&mdash;what
if one of them should feel hungry, and come into the pantry and
discover her?&mdash;Polly heard Purdy say with appalling loudness:
"Oh, go on, old man-don't jaw so!" He then seemed to plunge his
head in the basin, for it was with a choke and a splutter that he
next inquired: "And what did you think of the little 'un? Wasn't I
right?"</p>

<p>There was the chink of coins handled, and the other voice
answered: "Here's what I think. Take your money, my boy, and be
done with it!"</p>

<p>"Dick!&mdash;Great Snakes! Why, damn it all, man, you don't mean
to tell me..."</p>

<p>"And understand, sir, in future, that I do not make bets where a
lady is concerned."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know&mdash;only on the Tilly-Jinny-sort. And yet good
Lord, Dick!"&mdash;the rest was drowned in a bawl of laughter.</p>

<p>Under cover of it Polly took to her heels and fled, regardless
of the open door, or the padding of her bare feet on the
boards.</p>

<p>Without replying to the astonished Jinny's query in respect of
the water, she climbed over Tilly to her place beside the wall, and
shutting her eyes very tight, drew the sheet over her face: it felt
as though it would never be cool again.&mdash;Hence, Jinny,
agreeably wakeful, was forced to keep her thoughts to herself; for
if you lie between two people, one of whom is in a bad temper, and
the other fast asleep, you might just as well be alone in bed.</p>

<p>Next morning Polly alleged a headache and did not appear at
breakfast. Only Jinny and Tilly stood on the verandah of romantic
memories, and ruefully waved their handkerchiefs, keeping it up
till even the forms of horses were blurred in the distance.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-1-7" id="ch-1-1-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>His tent-home had never seemed so comfortless. He ended his
solitary ride late at night and wet to the skin; his horse had cast
a shoe far from any smithy. Long Jim alone came to the door to
greet him. The shopman, on whose doltish honesty Mahony would have
staked his head, had profited by his absence to empty the cash-box
and go off on the spree.&mdash;Even one of the cats had met its
fate in an old shaft, where its corpse still swam.</p>

<p>The following day, as a result of exposure and hard riding,
Mahony was attacked by dysentery; and before he had recovered, the
goods arrived from Melbourne. They had to be unloaded, at some
distance from the store, conveyed there, got under cover, checked
off and arranged. This was carried out in sheets of cold rain,
which soaked the canvas walls and made it doubly hard to get about
the clay tracks that served as streets. As if this were not enough,
the river in front of the house rose&mdash;rose, and in two twos
was over its banks&mdash;and he and Long Jim spent a night in their
clothes, helping neighbours less fortunately placed to move their
belongings into safety.</p>

<p>The lion's share of this work fell on him. Long Jim still
carried his arm in a sling, and was good for nothing but to guard
the store and summon Mahony on the appearance of customers. Since
his accident, too, the fellow had suffered from frequent fits of
colic or cramp, and was for ever slipping off to the township to
find the spirits in which his employer refused to deal. For the
unloading and warehousing of the goods, it was true, old Ocock had
loaned his sons; but the strict watch Mahony felt bound to keep
over this pretty pair far outweighed what their help was worth to
him.</p>

<p>Now it was Sunday evening, and for the first time for more than
a week he could call his soul his own again. He stood at the door
and watched those of his neighbours who were not Roman Catholics
making for church and chapel, to which half a dozen tinkly bells
invited them. The weather had finally cleared up, and a goodly
number of people waded past him through the mire. Among them, in
seemly Sabbath dress, went Ocock, with his two black sheep at heel.
The old man was a rigid Methodist, and at a recent prayer-meeting
had been moved to bear public witness to his salvation. This was no
doubt one reason why the young scapegrace Tom's almost simultaneous
misconduct had been so bitter a pill for him to swallow: while,
through God's mercy, he was become an exemplar to the weaker
brethren, a son of his made his name to stink in the nostrils of
the reputable community. Mahony liked to believe that there was
good in everybody, and thought the intolerant harshness which the
boy was subjected would defeat its end. Yet it was open to question
if clemency would have answered better. "Bad eggs, the brace of
them!" had been his own verdict, after a week's trial of the lads.
One would not, the other apparently could not work. Johnny, the
elder, was dull and liverish from intemperance; and the round-faced
adolescent, the news of whose fatherhood had raced the wind, was so
sheep-faced, so craven, in the presence of his elders, that he
could not say bo to a battledore. There was something unnatural
about this fierce timidity&mdash;and the doctor in Mahony caught a
quick glimpse of the probable reverse of the picture.</p>

<p>But it was cold, in face of all this rain-soaked clay; cold
blue-grey clouds drove across a washed-out sky; and he still felt
unwell. Returning to his living-room where a small American stove
was burning, he prepared for a quiet evening. In a corner by the
fire stood an old packing-case. He lifted the lid and thrust his
hand in: it was here he kept his books. He needed no light to see
by; he knew each volume by the feel. And after fumbling for a
little among the tumbled contents, he drew forth a work on natural
science and sat down to read. But he did not get far; his brain was
tired, intractable. Lighting his pipe, he tilted back his chair,
laid the <i>vestiges</i> face downwards, and put his feet on the
table.</p>

<p>How differently bashfulness impressed one in the case of the
weaker sex! There, it was altogether pleasing. Young Ocock's
gaucherie had recalled the little maid Polly's ingenuous confusion,
at finding herself the subject of conversation. He had not once
consciously thought of Polly since his return. Now, when he did so,
he found to his surprise that she had made herself quite a warm
little nest in his memory. Looked back on, she stood out in high
relief against her somewhat graceless surroundings. Small doubt she
was both maidenly and refined. He also remembered with a sensible
pleasure her brisk service, her consideration for others. What a
boon it would have been, during the past week, to have a busy,
willing little woman at work, with him and for him, behind the
screen! As it was, for want of a helping hand the place was like a
pigsty. He had had neither time nor energy to clean up. The marks
of hobnailed boots patterned the floor; loose mud, and crumbs from
meals, had been swept into corners or under the stretcher-bed;
while commodities that had overflowed the shop added to the
disorder. Good Lord, no!...no place this for a woman.</p>

<p>He rose and moved restlessly about, turning things over with his
foot: these old papers should be burnt, and that heap of
straw-packing; those empty sardine and coffee-tins be thrown into
the refuse-pit. Scrubbed and clean, it was by no means an
uncomfortable room; and the stove drew well. He was proud of his
stove; many houses had not even a chimney. He stood and stared at
it; but his thoughts were elsewhere: he found himself trying to
call to mind Polly's face. Except for a pair of big black
eyes&mdash;magnificent eyes they seemed to him in
retrospect&mdash;he had carried away with him nothing of her
outward appearance. Yes, stay!&mdash;her hair: her hair was so
glossy that, when the sun caught it, high lights came out on
it&mdash;so much he remembered. From this he fell to wondering
whether her brain kept pace with her nimble hands and ways. Was she
stupid or clever? He could not tolerate stupidity. And Polly had
given him no chance to judge her; had hardly opened her lips before
him. What a timid little thing she was to be sure! He should have
made it his business to draw her out, by being kind and
encouraging. Instead of which he had acted towards her, he felt
convinced, like an ill-mannered boor.</p>

<p>He did not know how it was, but he couldn't detach his thoughts
from Polly this evening: to their accompaniment he paced up and
down. All of a sudden he stood still, and gave a short, hearty
laugh. He had just seen, in a kind of phantom picture, the feet of
the sisters Beamish as they sat on the verandah edge: both young
women wore flat sandal-shoes. And so that neatest of neat ankles
had been little Polly's property! For his life he loved a
well-turned ankle in a woman.</p>

<p>A minute later he sat down at the table again. An idea had
occurred to him: he would write Polly a letter&mdash;a letter that
called for acknowledgment&mdash;and form an opinion of the girl
from her reply. Taking a sheet of thin blue paper and a magnum
bonum pen he wrote:</p>

<p>DEAR MISS TURNHAM,</p>

<p>I WONDER IF I MIGHT ASK YOU TO DO ME A FAVOUR? ON GETTING BACK
TO BALLARAT, I FIND THAT THE RAIN HAS SPOILT MY STORE FLAG. WOULD
YOU BE SO KIND AS TO MAKE ME A NEW ONE? I HAVE NO LADY FRIENDS HERE
TO APPLY TO FOR HELP, AND I AM SURE YOU ARE CLEVER WITH YOUR
NEEDLE. IF YOU CONSENT, I WILL SEND YOU THE OLD FLAG AS A PATTERN,
AND STUFF FOR THE NEW ONE. MY KIND REGARDS TO ALL AT THE HOTEL.</p>

<p>FAITHFULLY YOURS,<br>
RICHARD TOWNSHEND-MAHONY.</p>

<p>P.S. I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN OUR PLEASANT WALK TO THE CAVE.</p>

<p>He went out to the post with it himself. In one hand he carried
the letter, in the other the candle-end stuck in a bottle that was
known as a "Ballarat-lantern" for it was a pitchdark night.</p>

<p>Trade was slack; in consequence he found the four days that had
to pass before he could hope for an answer exceptionally long.
After their lapse, he twice spent an hour at the Post Office, in a
fruitless attempt to get near the little window. On returning from
the second of these absences, he found the letter waiting for him;
it had been delivered by hand.</p>

<p>So far good: Polly had risen to his fly! He broke the seal.</p>

<p>DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>I shall be happy to help you with your new flag if I am able.
Will you kindly send the old one and the stuff down by my brother,
who is coming to see me on Saturday. He is working at Rotten Gully,
and his name is Ned. I do not know if I sew well enough to please
you, but I will do my best.</p>

<p>I REMAIN,<br>
YOURS TRULY,<br>
MARY TURNHAM.</p>

<p>Mahony read, smiled and laid the letter down&mdash;only to pick
it up again. It pleased him, did this prim little note: there was
just the right shade of formal reserve about it. Then he began to
study particulars: grammar and spelling were correct; the
penmanship was in the Italian style, minute, yet flowing, the
letters dowered with generous loops and tails. But surely he had
seen this writing before? By Jupiter, yes! This was the hand of the
letter Purdy had shown him on the road to Melbourne. The little
puss! So she not only wrote her own letters, but those of her
friends as well. In that case she was certainly not stupid for she
was much the youngest of the three.</p>

<p>To-day was Thursday. Summoning Long Jim from his seat behind the
counter, Mahony dispatched him to Rotten Gully, with an injunction
not to show himself till he had found a digger of the name of
Turnham. And having watched Jim set out, at a snail's pace and
murmuring to himself, Mahony went into the store, and measured and
cut off material for the new flag, from two different coloured
rolls of stuff.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock that night before Polly's brother presented
himself. Mahony met him at the door and drew him in: the stove
crackled, the room was swept and garnished&mdash;he flattered
himself that the report on his habitat would be a favourable one.
Ned's appearance gave him a pleasant shock: it was just as if Polly
herself, translated into male terms, stood before him. No need,
now, to cudgel his brains for her image! In looking at Ned, he
looked again at Polly. The wide-awake off, the same fine, soft,
black hair came to light&mdash;here, worn rather long and curly
&mdash;the same glittering black eyes, ivory-white skin, short,
straight nose; and, as he gazed, an offshoot of Mahony's
consciousness wondered from what quarter this middle-class English
family fetched its dark, un-English strain.</p>

<p>In the beginning he exerted himself to set the lad at ease. He
soon saw, however, that he might spare his pains. Though clearly
not much more than eighteen years old, Ned Turnharn had the aplomb
and assurance of double that age. Lolling back in the single
armchair the room boasted, he more than once stretched out his hand
and helped himself from the sherry bottle Mahony had placed on the
table. And the disparity in their ages notwithstanding, there was
no trace of deference in his manner. Or the sole hint of it was: he
sometimes smothered a profane word, or apologised, with a winning
smile, for an oath that had slipped out unawares. Mahony could not
accustom him self to the foul language that formed the diggers'
idiom. Here, in the case of Polly's brother, he sought to overlook
the offence, or to lay the blame for it on other shoulders: at his
age, and alone, the boy should never have been plunged into this
Gehenna.</p>

<p>Ned talked mainly of himself and his doings. But other facts
also transpired, of greater interest to his hearer. Thus Mahony
learned that, out of a family of nine, four had found their way to
the colony, and a fifth was soon to follow&mdash;a mere child this,
on the under side of fifteen. He gathered, too, that the eldest
brother, John by name, was regarded as a kind of Napoleon by the
younger fry. At thirty, this John was a partner in the largest
wholesale dry-goods' warehouse in Melbourne. He had also married
money, and intended in due course to stand for the Legislative
Council. Behind Ned's windy bragging Mahony thought he discerned
tokens of a fond, brotherly pride. If this were so, the affair had
its pathetic side; for, from what the boy said, it was evident that
the successful man of business held his relatives at arm's length.
And as Ned talked on, Mahony conceived John to himself as a kind of
electro-magnet, which, once it had drawn these lesser creatures
after it, switched off the current and left them to their own
devices. Ned, young as he was, had tried his hand at many trades.
At present he was working as a hired digger; but this, only till he
could strike a softer job. Digging was not for him, thank you; what
you earned at it hardly repaid you for the sweat you dripped. His
every second word, indeed, was of how he could amass most money
with the minimum of bodily exertion.</p>

<p>This calculating, unyouthful outlook was repugnant to Mahony,
and for all his goodwill, the longer he listened to Ned, the cooler
he felt himself grow. Another disagreeable impression was left by
the grudging, if-nothing-better-turns-up fashion, in which Ned
accepted an impulsive offer on his part to take him into the store.
It was made on the spur of the moment, and Mahony had qualms about
it while his words were still warm on the air, realizing that the
overture was aimed, not at Ned in person, but at Ned as Polly's
brother. But his intuition did not reconcile him to Ned's
luke-warmness; he would have preferred a straight refusal. The best
trait he could discover in the lad was his affection for his
sister. This seemed genuine: he was going to see her
again&mdash;getting a lift halfway, tramping the other twenty odd
miles&mdash;at the end of the week. Perhaps though, in the case of
such a young opportunist, the thought of Mrs. Beamish's lavish
board played no small part; for Ned had a rather lean, underfed
look. But this only occurred to Mahony afterwards. Then, his chief
vexation was with himself: it would have been kinder to set a dish
of solid food before the boy, in place of the naked sherry-bottle.
But as usual, his hospitable leanings came too late.</p>

<p>One thing more. As he lighted Ned and his bundle of stuff
through the shop, he was impelled to slip a coin into the boy's
hand, with a murmured apology for the trouble he had put him to.
And a something, the merest nuance in Ned's manner of receiving and
pocketing the money, flashed the uncomfortable suspicion through
the giver's mind that it had been looked for, expected. And this
was the most unpleasant touch of all.</p>

<p>But, bless his soul! did not most large families include at
least one poorish specimen?&mdash;he had got thus far, by the time
he came to wind up his watch for the night. And next day he felt
sure he had judged Ned over-harshly. His first impressions of
people&mdash;he had had occasion to deplore the fact before
now&mdash;were apt to be either dead white or black as ink; the web
of his mind took on no half tints. The boy had not betrayed any
actual vices; and time might be trusted to knock the bluster out of
him. With this reflection Mahony dismissed Ned from his mind. He
had more important things to think of, chief among which was his
own state with regard to Ned's sister. And during the fortnight
that followed he went about making believe to weigh this matter, to
view it from every coign; for it did not suit him, even in secret,
to confess to the vehemence with which, when he much desired a
thing, his temperament knocked flat the hurdles of reason. The
truth was, his mind was made up &mdash;and had been, all along. At
the earliest possible opportunity, he was going to ask Polly to be
his wife.</p>

<p>Doubts beset him of course. How could he suppose that a girl who
knew nothing of him, who had barely seen him, would either want or
consent to marry him? And even if&mdash;for "if's" were
cheap&mdash;she did say yes, would it be fair of him to take her
out of a comfortable home, away from friends&mdash;such as they
were!&mdash;of her own sex, to land her in these crude
surroundings, where he did not know a decent woman to bear her
company? Yet there was something to be said for him, too. He was
very lonely. Now that Purdy had gone he was reduced, for society,
to the Long Jims and Ococks of the place. What would he not give,
once more to have a refined companion at his side? Certainly
marriage might postpone the day on which he hoped to shake the dust
of Australia off his feet. Life <i>&agrave; deux</i> would mean a
larger outlay; saving not prove so easy. Still it could be done;
and he would gladly submit to the delay if, by doing so, he could
get Polly. Besides, if this new happiness came to him, it would
help him to see the years he had spent in the colony in a truer and
juster light. And then, when the hour of departure did strike, what
a joy to have a wife to carry with one&mdash;a Polly to rescue, to
restore to civilisation!</p>

<p>He had to remind himself more than once, during this fortnight,
that she would be able to devote only a fraction of her day to
flagmaking. But he was at the end of his tether by the time a
parcel and a letter were left for him at the store&mdash;again by
hand: little Polly had plainly no sixpences to spare. The
needlework as perfect, of course; he hardly glanced at it, even
when he had opened and read the letter. This was of the same
decorous nature as the first. Polly returned a piece of stuff that
had remained over. He had really sent material enough for two
flags, she wrote; but she had not wished to keep him waiting so
long. And then, in a postscript:</p>

<p>MR. SMITH WAS HERE LAST SUNDAY. I AM TO SAY MRS. BEAMISH WOULD
BE VERY PLEASED IF YOU ALSO WOULD CALL AGAIN TO SEE US.</p>

<p>He ran the flag up to the top of his forty-foot staff and
wrote:&mdash; WHAT I WANT TO KNOW, MISS POLLY, IS, WOULD YOU BE
GLAD TO SEE ME?</p>

<p>But Polly was not to be drawn.</p>

<p>WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY PLEASED.</p>

<p>Some days previously Mahony had addressed a question to, Henry
Ocock. With this third letter from Polly, he held the lawyer's
answer in his hand. It was unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>YOURSELF ATS. BOLLIVER. WE THINK THAT ACTION WILL BE SET DOWN
FOR TRIAL IN ABOUT SIX WEEKS' TIME. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE DO
NOT THINK ANY USEFUL PURPOSE WILL BE SERVED BY YOU CALLING TO SEE
US UNTIL THIS IS DONE. WE SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WOULD CALL AFTER
THE ACTION IS ENTERED.</p>

<p>Six weeks' time? The man might as well have said a year. And
meanwhile Purdy was stealing a march on him, was paying clandestine
visits to Geelong. Was it conceivable that anyone in his five
senses could prefer Tilly to Polly? It was not. In the clutch of a
sudden fear Mahony went to Bath's and ordered a horse for the
following morning.</p>

<p>This time he left his store in charge of a young consumptive,
whose plight had touched his heart: the poor fellow was stranded on
Ballarat without a farthing, having proved, like many another of
his physique, quite unfit for work on the diggings. A strict
Baptist this Hempel, and one who believed hell-fire would be his
portion if he so much as guessed at the "plant" of his employer's
cash-box. He also pledged his word to bear and forbear with Long
Jim. The latter saw himself superseded with an extreme bad grace,
and was in no hurry to find a new job.</p>

<p>Mahony's nag was in good condition, and he covered the distance
in a trifle over six hours.</p>

<p>He had evidently hit on the family washing-day. The big boiler
in the yard belched clouds of steam; the female inmates of the
Hotel were gathered in the out-house: he saw them through the door
as he rode in at the gate. All three girls stood before tubs, their
sleeves rolled up, their arms in the lather. At his apparition
there was a characteristic chorus of cheeps and shrills and the
door was banged to. Mrs. Beamish alone came out to greet him. She
was moist and blown, and smelt of soap.</p>

<p>Not in a mood to mince matters, he announced straightway the
object of his visit. He was prepared for some expression of
surprise on the part of the good woman; but the blend of
sheep-faced amazement and uncivil incredulity to which she
subjected him made him hot and angry; and he vouchsafed no further
word of explanation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beamish presently so far recovered as to be able to finish
wiping the suds from her fat red arms.</p>

<p>Thereafter, she gave way to a very feminine weakness.</p>

<p>"Well, and now I come to think of it, I'm blessed if I didn't
suspeck somethin' of it, right from the first! Why, didn't I say to
Beamish, with me own lips, 'ow you couldn't 'ardly take your eyes
off 'er? Well, well, I'm sure I wish you every
'appiness&mdash;though 'ow we're h'ever goin' to get on without
Polly, I reelly don't know. Don't I wish it 'ad bin one o' my two
as 'ad tuck your fancy&mdash;that's all! Between you an' me, I
don't believe a blessed thing's goin' to come of all young Smith's
danglin' round. An' Polly's still a bit young&mdash;only just
turned sixteen. Not as she's any the worse o' that though; you'll
get 'er h'all the easier into your ways. An' now I mus' look smart,
an' get you a bite o' somethin' after your ride."</p>

<p>In vain did Mahony assure her that he had lunched on the road.
He did not know Mrs. Beamish. He was forced not only to sit down to
the meal she spread, but also, under her argus eye, to eat of
it.</p>

<p>When after a considerable delay Polly at length appeared, she
had removed all traces of the tub. The hand was cold that he took
in his, as he asked her if she would walk with him to the cave.</p>

<p>This time, she trembled openly. Like a lamb led to the
slaughter, he thought, looking down at her with tender eyes. Small
doubt that vulgar creature within-doors had betrayed him to Polly,
and exaggerated the ordeal that lay before her. When once she was
his wife he would not consent to her remaining intimate with people
of the Beamishes' kidney: what a joy to get her out of their
clutches! Nor should she spoil her pretty shape by stooping over a
wash-tub.</p>

<p>In his annoyance he forgot to moderate his pace. Polly had to
trip many small steps to keep up with him. When they reached the
entrance to the cave, she was flushed and out of breath.</p>

<p>Mahony stood and looked down at her. How young she was...how
young and innocent! Every feature of her dear little face still
waited, as it were, for the strokes of time's chisel. It should be
the care of his life that none but the happiest lines were graved
upon its precious surface.</p>

<p>"Polly," he said, fresh from his scrutiny. "Polly, I'm not going
to beat about the bush with you. I think you know I came here
to-day only to see you."</p>

<p>Polly's head drooped further forward; now, the rim of her bonnet
hid her face.</p>

<p>"You aren't afraid of me, are you, Polly?"</p>

<p>Oh, no, she was not afraid.</p>

<p>"Nor have you forgotten me?"</p>

<p>Polly choked a little, in her attempt to answer. She could not
tell him that she had carried his letters about with her by day,
and slept with them under her pillow; that she knew every word in
them by heart, and had copied and practised the bold flourish of
the Dickens-like signature; that she had never let his name cross
her lips; that she thought him the kindest, handsomest, cleverest
man in the world, and would willingly have humbled herself to the
dust before him: all this boiled and bubbled in her, as she brought
forth her poor little "no."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I hope not," went on Mahony. "Because, Polly, I've come
to ask you if you will be my wife."</p>

<p>Rocks, trees, hills, suddenly grown tipsy, went see-sawing round
Polly, when she heard these words said. She shut her eyes, and hid
her face in her hands. Such happiness seemed improbable&mdash;was
not to be grasped. "Me?...your wife?" she stammered through her
fingers.</p>

<p>"Yes, Polly. Do you think you could learn to care for me a
little, my dear? No, don't be in a hurry to answer. Take your own
time."</p>

<p>But she needed none. With what she felt to be a most unmaidenly
eagerness, yet could not subdue, she blurted out: "I know I could.
I...I do."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" said Mahony. "Thank God for that!"</p>

<p>He let his arms fall to his sides; he found he had been holding
them stiffly out from him. He sat down. "And now take away your
hands, Polly, and let me see your face. Don't be ashamed of showing
me what you feel. This is a sacred moment for us. We are promising
to take each other, you know, for richer for poorer, for better for
worse&mdash;as the good old words have it. And I must warn you, my
dear, you are not marrying a rich man. I live in a poor, rough
place, and have only a poor home to offer you. Oh, I have had many
scruples about asking you to leave your friends to come and share
it with me, Polly my love!"</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid. I am strong. I can work."</p>

<p>"And I shall take every care of you. Please God, you will never
regret your choice."</p>

<p>They were within sight of the house where they sat; and Mahony
imagined rude, curious eyes. So he did not kiss her. Instead, he
drew her arm though his, and together they paced up and down the
path they had come by, while he laid his plans before her, and
confessed to the dreams he had dreamt of their wedded life. It was
a radiant afternoon in the distance the sea lay deep blue, with
turquoise shallows; a great white bird of a ship, her canvas spread
to the breeze, was making for...why, to-day he did not care whether
for port or for "home"; the sun went down in a blaze behind a bank
of emerald green. And little Polly agreed with everything he
said&mdash;was all one lovely glow of acquiescence. He thought no
happier mortal than himself trod the earth.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-1-8" id="ch-1-1-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>Mahony remained at the Hotel till the following afternoon, then
walked to Geelong and took the steam-packet to Melbourne. The
object of his journey was to ask Mr. John Turnham's formal sanction
to his marriage. Polly accompanied him a little way on his walk.
And whenever he looked back he saw her standing fluttering her
handkerchief&mdash;a small, solitary figure on the bare, red
road.</p>

<p>He parted from her with a sense of leaving his most precious
possession behind, so close had words made the tie. On the other
hand, he was not sorry to be out of range for a while of the
Beamish family's banter. This had set in, the evening before, as
soon as he and Polly returned to the house&mdash;pacing the deck of
the little steamer, he writhed anew at the remembrance. Jokes at
their expense had been cracked all through supper: his want of
appetite, for instance, was the subject of a dozen crude
insinuations; and this, though everyone present knew that he had
eaten a hearty meal not two hours previously; had been kept up till
he grew stony and savage, and Polly, trying hard not to mind but
red to the rims of her ears, slipped out of the room. Supper over,
Mrs. Bearnish announced in a loud voice that the verandah was at
the disposal of the "turtle-doves." She no doubt expected them to
bill and coo in public, as Purdy and Matilda had done. On edge at
the thought, he drew Polly into the comparative seclusion of the
garden. Here they strolled up and down, their promenade bounded at
the lower end by the dense-leaved arbour under which they had first
met. In its screening shadow he took the kiss he had then been
generous enough to forgo.</p>

<p>"I think I loved you, Polly, directly I saw you."</p>

<p>In the distance a clump of hills rose steep and bare from the
waste land by the sea's edge&mdash;he could see them at this moment
as he leant over the taffrail: with the sun going down behind them
they were the colour of smoked glass. Last night they had been
white with moonlight, which lay spilled out upon them like milk.
Strange old hills! Standing there unchanged, unshaken, from time
immemorial, they made the troth that had been plighted under their
shield seem pitifully frail. And yet...The vows which Polly and he
had found so new, so wonderful; were not these, in truth, as
ancient as the hills themselves, and as undying? Countless
generations of human lovers had uttered them. The lovers passed,
but the pledges remained: had put on immortality.</p>

<p>In the course of their talk it leaked out that Polly would not
feel comfortable till her choice was ratified by brother John.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you will like John; he is so clever."</p>

<p>"I shall like everyone belonging to you, my Polly!"</p>

<p>As she lost her shyness Mahony made the discovery that she
laughed easily, and was fond of a jest. Thus, when he admitted to
her that he found it difficult to distinguish one fair, plump,
sister Beamish from the other; that they seemed to him as much
alike as two firm, pink-ribbed mushrooms, the little woman was
hugely tickled by his his masculine want of perception. "Why, Jinny
has brown eyes and Tilly blue!"</p>

<p>What he did not know, and what Polly did not confess to him, was
that much of her merriment arose from sheer lightness of
heart.&mdash;She, silly goose that she was! who had once believed
Jinny to be the picked object of his attentions.</p>

<p>But she grew serious again: could he tell her, please, why Mr.
Smith wrote so seldom to Tilly? Poor Tilly was unhappy at his long
silences&mdash;fretted over them in bed at night.</p>

<p>Mahony made excuses for Purdy, urging his unsettled mode of
life. But it pleased him to see that Polly took sides with her
friend, and loyally espoused her cause.</p>

<p>No, there had not been a single jarring note in all their
intercourse; each moment had made the dear girl dearer to him. Now,
worse luck, forty odd miles were between them again.</p>

<p>It had been agreed that he should call at her brother's private
house, towards five o'clock in the afternoon. He had thus to kill
time for the better part of the next day. His first visit was to a
jeweller's in Great Collins Street. Here, he pushed aside a tray of
showy diamonds&mdash;a successful digger was covering the fat, red
hands of his bride with them &mdash;and chose a slender, discreetly
chased setting, containing three small stones. No matter what
household duties fell to Polly's share, this little ring would not
be out of place on her finger.</p>

<p>From there he went to the last address Purdy had given him; only
to find that the boy had again disappeared. Before parting from
Purdy, the time before, he had lent him half the purchase-money for
a horse and dray, thus enabling him to carry out an old scheme of
plying for hire at the city wharf. According to the landlord of the
"Hotel Vendome," to whom Mahony was referred for fuller
information, Purdy had soon tired of this job, and selling dray and
beast for what he could get had gone off on a new rush to "Simson's
Diggings" or the "White Hills." Small wonder Miss Tilly was left
languishing for news of him.</p>

<p>Pricked by the nervous disquietude of those who have to do with
the law, Mahony next repaired to his solicitor's office. But Henry
Ocock was closeted with a more important client. This, Grindle the
clerk, whom he met on the stairs, informed him, with an evident
relish, and with some hidden, hinted meaning in the corners of his
shifty little eyes. It was lost on Mahony, who was not the man to
accept hints from a stranger.</p>

<p>The hour was on lunch-time; Grindle proposed that they should go
together to a legal chop-house, which offered prime value for your
money, and where, over the meal, he would give Mahony the latest
news of his suit. At a loss how to get through the day, the latter
followed him &mdash;he was resolved, too, to practise economy from
now on. But when he sat down to a dirty cloth and fly-spotted cruet
he regretted his compliance. Besides, the news Grindle was able to
give him amounted to nothing; the case had not budged since last he
heard of it. Worse still was the clerk's behaviour. For after
lauding the cheapness of the establishment, Grindle disputed the
price of each item on the "meenew," and, when he came to pay his
bill, chuckled over having been able to diddle the waiter of a
penny.</p>

<p>He was plainly one of those who feel the constant need of an
audience. And since there was no office-boy present, for him to
dazzle with his wit, he applied himself to demonstrating to his
table-companion what a sad, sad dog he was.</p>

<p>"Women are the deuce, sir," he asserted, lying back in his chair
and sending two trails of smoke from his nostrils. "The very deuce!
You should hear my governor on the subject! He'd tickle your ears
for you. Look here, I'll give you the tip: this move, you know, to
Ballarat, that he's drivin' at: what'ull you bet me there isn't a
woman in the case? Fact! 'Pon my word there is. And a devilish fine
woman, too!" He shut one eye and laid a finger along his nose. "You
won't blow the gab?&mdash;that's why you couldn't have your
parleyvoo this morning. When milady comes to town H. O.'s <i>non
est</i> as long as she's here. And she with a hubby of her own,
too! What 'ud our old pa say to that, eh?"</p>

<p>Mahony, who could draw in his feelers no further than he had
done, touched the limit of his patience. "My connexion with Mr.
Ocock is a purely business one. I have no intention of trespassing
on his private affairs, or of having them thrust upon me. Carver,
my bill!"</p>

<p>Bowing distantly he stalked out of the eating-house and back to
the "Criterion," where he dined. "So much for a maiden attempt at
economy!"</p>

<p>Towards five o'clock he took his seat in an omnibus that plied
between the city and the seaside suburb of St. Kilda, three miles
off. A cool breeze went; the hoofs of the horses beat a rataplan on
the hard surface; the great road, broad enough to make three of,
was alive with smart gigs and trotters.</p>

<p>St. Kilda was a group of white houses facing the Bay. Most were
o' weatherboard with brick chimneys; but there were also a few of a
more solid construction. Mahony's goal was one of these: a low,
stone villa surrounded by verandahs, in the midst of tasteful
grounds. The drive up to the door led through a shrubbery, artfully
contrived of the native ti-tree; behind the house stretched kitchen
and fruit-gardens. Many rare plants grew in the beds. There was a
hedge of geraniums close on fifteen feet high.</p>

<p>His knock was answered by a groom, who made a saucy face: Mr.
Turnham and his lady were attending the Governor's ball this
evening and did not receive. Mahony insisted on the delivery of his
visiting-card. And since the servant still blocked the entrance he
added: "Inform your master, my man, that I am the bearer of a
message from his sister, Miss Mary Turnham."</p>

<p>The man shut him out, left him standing on the verandah. After a
lengthy absence, he returned, and with a "Well, come along in
then!" opened the door of a parlour. This was a large room, well
furnished in horsehair and rep. Wax-lights stood on the mantelpiece
before a gilt-framed pierglass; coloured prints hung on the
walls.</p>

<p>While Mahony was admiring the genteel comfort to which he had
long been a stranger, John Turnham entered the room. He had a quiet
tread, but took determined strides at the floor. In his hand he
held Mahony's card, and he looked from Mahony to it and back
again.</p>

<p>"To what do I owe the pleasure, Mr...er...Mahony?" he asked,
refreshing his memory with a glance at the pasteboard. He spoke in
the brusque tone of one accustomed to run through many applicants
in the course of an hour. "I understand that you make use of my
sister Mary's name." And, as Mahony did not instantly respond, he
snapped out: "My time is short, sir!"</p>

<p>A tinge of colour mounted to Mahony's cheeks. He answered with
equal stiffness: "That is so. I come from Mr. William Beamish's
'Family Hotel,' and am commissioned to bring you your sister's warm
love and regards."</p>

<p>John Turnham bowed; and waited.</p>

<p>"I have also to acquaint you with the fact," continued Mahony,
gathering hauteur as he went, "that the day before yesterday I
proposed marriage to your sister, and that she did me the honour of
accepting me."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!" said John Turnham, with a kind of ironic snort.
"And may I ask on what ground you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On the ground, sir, that I have a sincere affection for Miss
Turnham, and believe it lies in my power to make her happy."</p>

<p>"Of that, kindly allow me to judge. My sister is a mere
child&mdash;too young to know her own mind. Be seated."</p>

<p>To a constraining, restraining vision of little Polly, Mahony
obeyed, stifling the near retort that she was not too young to earn
her living among strangers. The two men faced each other on
opposite sides of the table. John Turnham had the same dark eyes
and hair, the same short, straight nose as his brother and sister,
but not their exotic pallor. His skin was bronzed; and his large,
scarlet mouth supplied a vivid dash of colour. He wore bushy
side-whiskers.</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. Mahony, I will ask you a blunt question. I receive
letters regularly from my sister, but I cannot recall her ever
having mentioned your name. Who and what are you?"</p>

<p>"Who am I?" flared up Mahony. "A gentleman like yourself,
sir!&mdash;though a poor one. As for Miss Turnham not mentioning me
in her letters, that is easily explained. I only had the pleasure
of making her acquaintance five or six weeks ago."</p>

<p>"You are candid," said Polly's brother, and smiled without
unclosing his lips. "But your reply to my question tells me
nothing. May I ask what...er...under what...er...circumstances you
came out to the colony, in the first instance?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, you may not!" cried Mahony, and flung up from his
seat; he scented a deadly insult in the question.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mr. Mahony," said Turnham in a more conciliatory
tone. "Nothing is gained by being techy. And my inquiry is not
unreasonable. You are an entire stranger to me; my sister has known
you but for a few weeks, and is a young and inexperienced girl into
the bargain. You tell me you are a gentleman. Sir! I had as lief
you said you were a blacksmith. In this grand country of ours,
where progress is the watchword, effete standards and dogging
traditions must go by the board. Grit is of more use to us than
gentility. Each single bricklayer who unships serves the colony
better than a score of gentlemen."</p>

<p>"In that I am absolutely not at one with you, Mr. Turnham," said
Mahony coldly. He had sat down again, feeling rather ashamed of his
violence. "Without a leaven of refinement, the very raw material of
which the existing population is composed&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Turnham interrupted him. "Give 'em time, sir, give 'em time.
God bless my soul! Rome wasn't built in a day. But to resume. I
have repeatedly had occasion to remark in what small stead the
training that fits a man for a career in the old country stands him
here. And that is why I am dissatisfied with your reply. Show me
your muscles, sir, give me a clean bill of health, tell me if you
have learnt a trade and can pay your way. See, I will be frank with
you. The position I occupy to-day I owe entirely to my own efforts.
I landed in the colony ten years ago, when this marvellous city of
ours was little more than a village settlement. I had but five
pounds in my pocket. To-day I am a partner in my firm, and intend,
if all goes well, to enter parliament. Hence I think I may, without
presumption, judge what makes for success here, and of the type of
man to attain it. Work, hard work, is the key to all doors. So
convinced am I of this, that I have insisted on the younger members
of my family learning betimes to put their shoulders to the wheel.
Now, Mr. Mahony, I have been open with you. Be equally frank with
me. You are an Irishman?"</p>

<p>Candour invariably disarmed Mahony&mdash;even lay a little heavy
on him, with the weight of an obligation. He retaliated with a
light touch of self-depreciation. "An Irishman, sir, in a country
where the Irish have fallen, and not without reason, into general
disrepute."</p>

<p>Over a biscuit and a glass of sherry he gave a rough outline of
the circumstances that had led to his leaving England, two years
previously, and of his dismayed arrival in what he called "the
cesspool of 1852".</p>

<p>"Thanks to the rose-water romance of the English press, many a
young man of my day was enticed away from a modest competency, to
seek his fortune here, where it was pretended that nuggets could be
gathered like cabbages&mdash;I myself threw up a tidy little
country practice...I might mention that medicine was my profession.
It would have given me intense satisfaction, Mr. Turnham, to see
one of those glib journalists in my shoes, or the shoes of some of
my messmates on the <i>Ocean Queen</i>. There were men aboard that
ship, sir, who were reduced to beggary before they could even set
foot on the road to the north. Granted it is the duty of the press
to encourage emigration&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let the press be, Mahony," said Turnham: he had sat back,
crossed his legs, and put his thumbs in his armholes. "Let it be.
What we need here is colonists&mdash;small matter how we get
'em."</p>

<p>Having had his say, Mahony scamped the recital of his own
sufferings: the discomforts of the month he had been forced to
spend in Melbourne getting his slender outfit together; the
miseries of the tramp to Ballarat on delicate unused feet, among
the riff-raff of nations, under a wan December sky, against which
the trunks of the gum-trees rose whiter still, and out of which
blazed a copper sun with a misty rim. He scamped, too, his
six-months' attempt at digging&mdash;he had been no more fit for
the work than a child. Worn to skin and bone, his small remaining
strength sucked out by dysentery, he had in the end bartered his
last pinch of gold-dust for a barrow-load of useful odds and ends;
and this had formed the nucleus of his store. Here, fortune had
smiled on him; his flag hardly set a-flying custom had poured in,
business gone up by leaps and bounds&mdash;"Although I have never
sold so much as a pint of spirits, sir!" His profits for the past
six months equalled a clear three hundred, and he had most of this
to the good. With a wife to keep, expenses would naturally be
heavier; but he should continue to lay by every spare penny, with a
view to getting back to England.</p>

<p>"You have not the intention, then, of remaining permanently in
the colony?"</p>

<p>"Not the least in the world."</p>

<p>"H'm," said John: he was standing on the hearthrug now, his legs
apart. "That, of course, puts a different complexion on the matter.
Still, I may say I am entirely reassured by what you have told
me&mdash;entirely so. Indeed, you must allow me to congratulate you
on the good sense you displayed in striking while the iron was hot.
Many a one of your medical brethren, sir, would have thought it
beneath his dignity to turn shopkeeper. And now, Mr. Mahony, I will
wish you good day; we shall doubtless meet again before very long.
Nay, one moment! There are cases, you will admit, in which a female
opinion is not without value. Besides, I should be pleased for you
to see my wife."</p>

<p>He crossed the hall, tapped at a door and cried: "Emma, my love,
will you give us the pleasure of your company?"</p>

<p>In response to this a lady entered, whom Mahony thought one of
the most beautiful women he had ever seen. She carried a yearling
infant in her arms, and with one hand pressed its pale flaxen poll
against the rich, ripe corn of her own hair, as if to dare
comparison. Her cheeks were of a delicate rose pink.</p>

<p>"My love," said Turnham&mdash;and one felt that the word was no
mere flower of speech. "My love, here is someone who wishes to
marry our Polly."</p>

<p>"To marry our Polly?" echoed the lady, and smiled a faint,
amused smile &mdash;it was as though she said: to marry this infant
that I bear on my arm. "But Polly is only a little girl!"</p>

<p>"My very words, dearest. And too young to know her own
mind."</p>

<p>"But you will decide for her, John."</p>

<p>John hung over his beautiful wife, wheeled up an easy chair,
arranged her in it, placed a footstool. "Pray, pray, do not
overfatigue yourself, Emma! That child is too heavy for you," he
objected, as the babe made strenuous efforts to kick itself to its
feet. "You know I do not approve of you carrying it yourself."</p>

<p>"Nurse is drinking tea."</p>

<p>"But why do I keep a houseful of domestics if one of the others
cannot occasionally take her place?"</p>

<p>He made an impetuous step towards the bell. Before he could
reach it there came a thumping at the door, and a fluty voice
cried: "Lemme in, puppa, lemme in!"</p>

<p>Turnham threw the door open, and admitted a sturdy two-year-old,
whom he led forward by the hand. "My son," he said, not without
pride. Mahony would have coaxed the child to him; but it ran to its
mother, hid its face in her lap.</p>

<p>Forgetting the bell John struck an attitude. "What a picture!"
he exclaimed. "What a picture! My love, I positively must carry out
my intention of having you painted in oils, with the children round
you.&mdash;Mr. Mahony, sir, have you ever seen anything to equal
it?"</p>

<p>Though his mental attitude might have been expressed by a note
of exclamation, set ironically, Mahony felt constrained to second
Turnham's enthusiasm. And it was indeed a lovely picture: the
gracious, golden-haired woman, whose figure had the amplitude, her
gestures the almost sensual languor of the young nursing mother;
the two children fawning at her knee, both ash-blond, with vivid
scarlet lips.&mdash;"It helps one," thought Mahony, "to understand
the mother-worship of primitive peoples."</p>

<p>The nursemaid summoned and the children borne off, Mrs. Emma
exchanged a few amiable words with the visitor, then obeyed with an
equally good grace her husband's command to rest for an hour,
before dressing for the ball.</p>

<p>Having escorted her to another room, Turnham came back rubbing
his hands. "I am pleased to be able to tell you, Mr. Mahony, that
your suit has my wife's approval. You are highly favoured! Emma is
not free with her liking." Then, in a sudden burst of effusion: "I
could have wished you the pleasure, sir, of seeing my wife in
evening attire. She will make a furore again; no other woman can
hold a candle to her in a ballroom. To-night is the first time
since the birth of our second child that she will grace a public
entertainment with her presence; and unfortunately her appearance
will be a brief one, for the infant is not yet wholly weaned." He
shut the door and lowered his voice. "You have had some experience
of doctoring, you say; I should like a word with you in your
medical capacity. The thing is this. My wife has persisted,
contrary to my wishes, in suckling both children herself."</p>

<p>"Quite right, too," said Mahony. "In a climate like this their
natural food is invaluable to babes."</p>

<p>"Exactly, quite so," said Turnham, with a hint of impatience.
"And in the case of the first child, I made due allowance: a young
mother...the novelty of the thing...you understand. But with regard
to the second, I must confess I&mdash;How long, sir, in your
opinion, can a mother continue to nurse her babe without injury to
herself? It is surely harmful if unduly protracted? I have observed
dark lines about my wife's eyes, and she is losing her fine
complexion.&mdash;Then you confirm my fears. I shall assert my
authority without delay, and insist on separation from the
child.&mdash;Ah! women are strange beings, Mr. Mahony, strange
beings, as you are on the high road to discovering for
yourself."</p>

<p>Mahony returned to town on foot, the omnibus having ceased to
run. As he walked&mdash;at a quick pace, and keeping a sharp
look-out; for the road was notoriously unsafe after dark&mdash;he
revolved his impressions of the interview. He was glad it was over,
and, for Polly's sake, that it had passed off satisfactorily. It
had made a poor enough start: at one moment he had been within an
ace of picking up his hat and stalking out. But he found it
difficult at the present happy crisis to bear a grudge&mdash;even
if it had not been a proved idiosyncrasy of his, always to let a
successful finish erase a bad beginning. None the less, he would
not have belonged to the nation he did, had he not indulged in a
caustic chuckle and a pair of good-humoured pishes and pshaws, at
Turnham's expense. "Like a showman in front of his booth!"</p>

<p>Then he thought again of the domestic scene he had been
privileged to witness, and grew grave. The beautiful young woman
and her children might have served as model for a Holy
Family&mdash;some old painter's dream of a sweet benign Madonna;
the trampling babe as the infant Christ; the upturned face of the
little John adoring. No place this for the scoffer. Apart from the
mere pleasure of the eye, there was ample justification for
Turnham's transports. Were they not in the presence of one of
life's sublimest mysteries&mdash;that of motherhood? Not alone the
lovely Emma: no; every woman who endured the rigours of childbirth,
to bring forth an immortal soul, was a holy figure.</p>

<p>And now for him, too, as he had been reminded, this wonder was
to be worked. Little Polly as the mother of his children&mdash;what
visions the words conjured up! But he was glad Polly was just
Polly, and not the peerless creature he had seen. John Turnham's
fears would never be his&mdash;this jealous care of a transient
bodily beauty. Polly was neither too rare nor too fair for her
woman's lot; and, please God, the day would come when he would see
her with a whole cluster of little ones round her &mdash;little
dark-eyed replicas of herself. She, bless her, should dandle and
cosset them to her heart's content. Her joy in them would also be
his.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-1-9" id="ch-1-1-9"></a>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>He sawed, planed, hammered; curly shavings dropped and there was
a pleasant smell of sawdust. Much had to be done to make the place
fit to receive Polly. A second outhouse was necessary, to hold the
surplus goods and do duty as a sleeping-room for Long Jim and
Hempel: the lean-to the pair had occupied till now was being
converted into a kitchen. At great cost and trouble, Mahony had
some trees felled and brought in from Warrenheip. With them he put
up a rude fence round his backyard, interlacing the lopped boughs
from post to post, so that they formed a thick and leafy screen. He
also filled in the disused shaft that had served as a rubbish-hole,
and chose another, farther off, which would be less malodorous in
the summer heat. Finally, a substantial load of firewood carted in,
and two snakes that had made the journey in hollow logs dispatched,
Long Jim was set down to chop and split the wood into a neat pile.
Polly would need but to walk to and from the woodstack for her
firing.</p>

<p>Indoors he made equal revolution. That her ears should not be
polluted by the language of the customers, he ran up a partition
between living-room and store, thus cutting off the slab-walled
portion of the house, with its roof of stringy-bark, from the
log-and-canvas front. He also stopped with putty the worst gaps
between the slabs. At Ocock's Auction Rooms he bought a horsehair
sofa to match his armchair, a strip of carpet, a bed, a
washhand-stand and a looking-glass, and tacked up a calico curtain
before the window. His books, fetched out of the wooden case, were
arranged on a brand-new set of shelves; and, when all was done and
he stood back to admire his work, it was borne in on him afresh
with how few creature-comforts he had hitherto existed. Plain to
see now, why he had preferred to sit out-of-doors rather than
within! Now, no one on the Flat had a trimmer little place than
he.</p>

<p>In his labours he had the help of a friendly digger&mdash;a
carpenter by trade&mdash;who one evening, pipe in mouth, had stood
to watch his amateurish efforts with the jack-plane. Otherwise, the
Lord alone knew how the house would ever have been made shipshape.
Long Jim was equal to none but the simplest jobs; and Hempel, the
assistant, had his hands full with the store. Well, it was a
blessing at this juncture that business could be left to him.
Hempel was as straight as a die; was a real treasure&mdash;or would
have been, were it not for his eternal little bark of a cough. This
was proof against all remedies, and the heck-heck of it at night
was quite enough to spoil a light sleeper's rest. In building the
new shed, Mahony had been careful to choose a corner far from the
house.</p>

<p>Marriages were still uncommon enough on Ballarat to make him an
object of considerable curiosity. People took to dropping in of an
evening&mdash;old Ocock; the postmaster; a fellow storekeeper,
ex-steward to the Duke of Newcastle&mdash;to comment on his
alterations and improvements. And over a pipe and a glass of
sherry, he had to put up with a good deal of banter about his
approaching "change of state."</p>

<p>Still, it was kindly meant. "We'll 'ave to git up a bit o'
company o' nights for yer lady when she comes," said old Ocock, and
spat under the table.</p>

<p>Purdy wrote from Tarrangower, where he had drifted:</p>

<p>HOORAY, OLD DICK, GOLLY FOR YOU! OLD MAN DIDN'T I KICK UP A
BOBBERY WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS. NEVER WAS SO WELL PLEASED IN MY
LIFE. THAT'S ALL YOU NEEDED, DICK&mdash;NOW YOU'LL TURN INTO A
FIRST-RATE COLONIAL. HOW ABOUT THAT FIVER NOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW. YOU
CAN TELL POLLY FROM ME I SHALL PAY IT BACK WITH INTEREST ON THE
FATAL DAY. OF COURSE I'LL COME AND SEE YOU SPLICED, TOGS OR NO
TOGS&mdash;TO TELL THE TRUTH MY KICKSIES ARE ON THEIR VERY LAST
LEGS&mdash;AND THERE'S NOTHING DOING HERE&mdash;ALL THE LOOSE
STUFF'S BEEN TURNED OVER. THERE'S OCEANS OF QUARTZ, OF COURSE, AND
THEY'RE TRYING TO POUND IT UP IN DOLLIES, BUT YOU COULD PUT ME TO
BED WITH A PICK-AXE AND A SHOVEL BEFORE I'D GO IN FOR SUCH
TOMFOOLERY AS THAT.&mdash;DAMN IT ALL, DICK, TO THINK OF YOU BEING
COTCHED AT LAST. I CAN'T GET OVER IT, AND IT'S A BIT OF A RISK,
TOO, BY DAD IT IS, FOR A GIRL OF THAT AGE IS A DARK HORSE IF EVER
THERE WAS ONE.</p>

<p>Mahony's answer to this was a couple of pound-notes: SO THAT MY
BEST MAN SHALL NOT DISGRACE ME! His heart went out to the writer.
Dear old Dickybird! pleased as Punch at the turn of events, yet
quaking for fear of imaginary risks. With all Purdy's respect for
his friend's opinions, he had yet an odd distrust of that friend's
ability to look after himself. And now he was presuming to doubt
Polly, too. Like his imperence! What the dickens did HE know of
Polly? Keenly relishing the sense of his own intimate knowledge,
Mahony touched the breast-pocket in which Polly's letters
lay&mdash;he often carried them out with him to a little hill, on
which a single old blue-gum had been left standing; its scraggy
top-knot of leaves drooped and swayed in the wind, like the few
long straggling hairs on an old man's head.</p>

<p>The letters formed a goodly bundle; for Polly and he wrote
regularly to each other, she once a week, he twice. His bore the
Queen's head; hers, as befitted a needy little governess, were
oftenest delivered by hand. Mahony untied the packet, drew a chance
letter from it and mused as he read. Polly had still not ceded much
of her early reserve&mdash;and it had taken him weeks to persuade
her even to call him by his first name. She was, he thanked
goodness, not of the kind who throw maidenly modesty to the winds,
directly the binding word is spoken. He loved her all the better
for her wariness of emotion; it tallied with a like streak in his
own nature. And this, though at the moment he was going through a
very debauch of frankness. To the little black-eyed girl who pored
over his letters at "Beamish's Family Hotel," he unbosomed himself
as never in his life before. He enlarged on his tastes and
preferences, his likes and dislikes; he gave vent to his real
feelings for the country of his exile, and his longings for "home";
told how he had come to the colony, in the first instance, with the
fantastic notion of redeeming the fortunes of his family; described
his collections of butterflies and plants to her, using their Latin
names. And Polly drank in his words, and humbly agreed with all he
wrote, or at least did not disagree; and, from this, as have done
lovers from the beginning of time, he inferred a perfect harmony of
mind. On one point only did he press her for a reply. Was she fond
of books? If so, what evenings they would spend together, he
reading aloud from some entertaining volume, she at her fancy work.
And poetry? For himself he could truly say he did not care for
poetry...except on a Saturday night or a quiet Sunday morning; and
that was, because he liked it too well to approach it with any but
a tranquil mind.</p>

<p>I THINK IF I KNOW YOU ARIGHT, AS I BELIEVE I DO, MY POLLY, YOU
TOO HAVE POETRY IN YOUR SOUL.</p>

<p>He smiled at her reply; then kissed it.</p>

<p>I CANNOT WRITE POETRY MYSELF, said Polly, BUT I AM VERY FOND OF
IT AND SHALL INDEED LIKE VERY MUCH DEAR RICHARD TO LISTEN WHEN YOU
READ.</p>

<p>But the winter ran away, one cold, wet week succeeding another,
and still they were apart. Mahony urged and pleaded, but could not
get Polly to name the wedding-day. He began to think pressure was
being brought to bear on the girl from another side. Naturally the
Beamishes were reluctant to let her go: who would be so useful to
them as Polly?&mdash;who undertake, without scorn, the education of
the whilom shepherd's daughters? Still, they knew they had to lose
her, and he could not see that it made things any easier for them
to put off the evil day. No, there was something else at the bottom
of it; though he did not know what. Then one evening, pondering a
letter of Polly's, he slapped his forehead and exclaimed aloud at
his own stupidity. That night, into his reply he slipped four
five-pound notes. JUST TO BUY YOURSELF ANY LITTLE THING YOU FANCY,
DEAREST. IF I CHOSE A GIFT, I MIGHT SEND WHAT WOULD NOT BE
ACCEPTABLE TO YOU. Yes, sure enough, that was it&mdash;little Polly
had been in straits for money: the next news he heard was that she
had bought and was stitching her wedding-gown. Taxed with her need,
Polly guiltily admitted that her salary for the past three months
was owing to her. But there had been great expenses in connection
with the hotel; and Mr. B. had had an accident to his leg. From
what she wrote, though, Mahony saw that it was not the first time
such remissness had occurred; and he felt grimly indignant with her
employers. Keeping open house, and hospitable to the point of
vulgarity, they were, it was evident, pinchfists when it came to
parting with their money. Still, in the case of a little woman who
had served them so faithfully! In thought he set a thick black mark
against their name, for their cavalier treatment of his Polly. And
extended it to John Turnham as well. John had made no move to put
hand to pocket; and Polly's niceness of feeling had stood in the
way of her applying to him for aid. It made Mahony yearn to snatch
the girl to him, then and there; to set her free of all contact
with such coarse-grained, miserly brutes.</p>

<p>Old Ocock negotiated the hire of a neat spring cart for him, and
a stout little cob; and at last the day had actually come, when he
could set out to bring Polly home. By his side was Ned Turnham.
Ned, still a lean-jowled wages-man at Rotten Gully, made no secret
of his glee at getting carried down thus comfortably to Polly's
nuptials. They drove the eternal forty odd miles to Geelong, each
stick and stone of which was fast becoming known to Mahony; a
journey that remained equally tiresome whether the red earth rose
as a thick red dust, or whether as now it had turned to a mud like
birdlime in which the wheels sank almost to the axles. Arrived at
Geelong they put up at an hotel, where Purdy awaited them. Purdy
had tramped down from Tarrangower, blanket on back, and stood in
need of a new rig-out from head to foot. Otherwise his persistent
ill-luck had left no mark on him.</p>

<p>The ceremony took place early the following morning, at the
house of the Wesleyan minister, the Anglican parson having been
called away. The Beamishes and Polly drove to town, a tight fit in
a double buggy. On the back seat, Jinny clung to and half supported
a huge clothes-basket, which contained the wedding-breakfast. Polly
sat on her trunk by the splashboard; and Tilly, crowded out, rode
in on one of the cart-horses, a coloured bed-quilt pinned round her
waist to protect her skirts.</p>

<p>To Polly's disappointment neither her brother John nor his wife
was present; a letter came at the eleventh hour to say that Mrs.
Emma was unwell, and her husband did not care to leave her.
Enclosed, however, were ten pounds for the purchase of a
wedding-gift; and the pleasure Polly felt at being able to announce
John's generosity helped to make up to her for his absence. The
only other guest present was an elder sister, Miss Sarah Turnham,
who, being out of a situation at the moment, had sailed down from
Melbourne. This young lady, a sprightly brunette of some three or
four and twenty, without the fine, regular features of Ned and
Polly, but with tenfold their vivacity and experience, caused quite
a sensation; and Tilly's audible raptures at beholding her Purdy
again were of short duration; for Purdy had never met the equal of
Miss Sarah, and could not take his eyes off her. He and she were
the life of the party. The Beamishes were overawed by the visitor's
town-bred airs and the genteel elegance of her dress; Polly was a
mere crumpled rose-leaf of pink confusion; Mahony too preoccupied
with ring and licence to take any but his formal share in the
proceedings.</p>

<p>"Come and see you?" echoed Miss Sarah playfully: the knot was
tied; the company had demolished the good things laid out by Mrs.
Beamish in the private parlour of an hotel, and emptied a couple of
bottles of champagne; and Polly had changed her muslin frock for a
black silk travelling-gown. "Come and <i>see</i> you? Why, of
course I will, little silly!"&mdash;and, with her pretty white
hands, she patted the already perfect bow of Polly's
bonnet-strings. Miss Sarah had no great opinion of the match her
sister was making; but she had been agreeably surprised by Mahony's
person and manners, and had said so, thus filling Polly's soul with
bliss. "Provided, of course, little goosey, you have a <i>spare
room</i> to offer me.&mdash;For, I confess," she went on, turning
to the rest of the party, "I confess I feel inordinately curious to
see, with my own eyes, what these famous diggings are like. From
all one hears, they must be <i>marvellously</i>
entertaining.&mdash;Now, I presume that you, Mr. Smith, never touch
at such <i>rude, out-of-the-world</i> places in the course of
<i>your</i> travels?"</p>

<p>Purdy, who had discreetly concealed the fact that he was but a
poverty-stricken digger himself, quibbled a light evasion, then
changed the subject, and offered his escort to the steam-packet by
which Miss Sarah was returning to Melbourne.</p>

<p>"And you, too, dear Tilly," urged little Polly, proceeding with
her farewells. "For, mind, you promised. And I won't forget
to...you know what!"</p>

<p>Tilly, sobbing noisily, wept on Polly's neck that she wished she
was dead or at the bottom of the sea; and Polly, torn between pride
and pain at Purdy's delinquency, could only kiss her several times
without speaking.</p>

<p>The farewells buzzed and flew.</p>

<p>"Good-bye to you, little lass...beg pardon, Mrs. Dr.
Mahony!"&mdash; "Mind you write, Poll! I shall die to 'ear."&mdash;
"Ta-ta, little silly goosey, and <i>au revoir</i>!"&mdash;"Mind he
don't pitch you out of the cart, Polly!"&mdash;"Good-bye, Polly, my
duck, and remember I'll come to you in a winkin', h'if and when..."
which speech on the part of Mrs. Beamish distressed Polly to the
verge of tears.</p>

<p>But finally she was torn from their arms and hoisted into the
cart; and Mahony, the reins in his hand, began to unstiffen from
the wooden figure-head he had felt himself during the ceremony, and
under the whirring tongues and whispered confidences of the
women.</p>

<p>"And now, Polly, for home!" he said exultantly, when the largest
pocket-handkerchief had shrunk to the size of a nit, and Polly had
ceased to twist her neck for one last, last glimpse of her
friends.</p>

<p>And then the bush, and the loneliness of the bush, closed round
them.</p>

<p>It was the time of flowers&mdash;of fierce young growth after
the fruitful winter rains. The short-lived grass, green now as that
of an English meadow, was picked out into patterns by the scarlet
of the Running Postman; purple sarsaparilla festooned the stems of
the scrub; there were vast natural paddocks, here of yellow
everlastings, there of heaths in full bloom. Compared with the
dark, spindly foliage of the she-oaks, the ti-trees' waxy flowers
stood out like orange-blossoms against firs. On damp or marshy
ground wattles were aflame: great quivering masses of softest gold.
Wherever these trees stood, the fragrance of their yellow puff-ball
blossoms saturated the air; one knew, before one saw them, that
they were coming, and long after they had been left behind one
carried their honeyed sweetness with one; against them, no other
scent could have made itself felt. And to Mahony these waves of
perfume, into which they were continually running, came, in the
course of the hours, to stand for a symbol of the golden future for
which he and Polly were making; and whenever in after years he met
with wattles in full bloom, he was carried back to the blue spring
day of this wedding-journey, and jogged on once more, in the light
cart, with his girl-wife at his side.</p>

<p>It was necessarily a silent drive. More rain had fallen during
the night; even the best bits of the road were worked into deep,
glutinous ruts, and the low-lying parts were under water. Mahony,
but a fairish hand with the reins, was repeatedly obliged to leave
the track and take to the bush, where he steered a way as best he
could through trees, stumps, boulders and crab-holes. Sometimes he
rose to his feet to encourage the horse; or he alighted and pulled
it by the bridle; or put a shoulder to the wheel. But to-day no
difficulties had power to daunt him; and the farther he advanced
the lighter-hearted he grew: he went back to Ballarat feeling, for
the first time, that he was actually going home.</p>

<p>And Polly? Sitting motionless at her husband's side, her hands
folded on her black silk lap, Polly obediently turned her head this
way and that, when Richard pointed out a landmark to her, or called
her attention to the flowers. At first, things were new and
arresting, but the novelty soon wore off; and as they went on and
on, and still on, it began to seem to Polly, who had never been
farther afield than a couple of miles north of the "Pivot City," as
if they were driving away from all the rest of mankind, right into
the very heart of nowhere. The road grew rougher, too&mdash;became
scored with ridges and furrows which threw them violently from side
to side. Unused to bush driving, Polly was sure at each fresh jolt
that this time the cart <i>must</i> tip over; and yet she preferred
the track and its dangers to Richard's adventurous attempts to
carve a passage through the scrub. A little later a cold south wind
sprang up, which struck through her thin silk mantle; she was very
tired, having been on her feet since five o'clock that morning; and
all the happy fuss and excitement of the wedding was behind her.
Her heart sank. She loved Richard dearly; if he had asked her, she
would have gone to the ends of the earth with him; but at this
moment she felt both small and lonely, and she would have liked
nothing better than Mrs. Beamish's big motherly bosom, on which to
lay her head. And when, in passing a swamp, a well-known noise
broke on her ear&mdash;that of hundreds of bell-frogs, which were
like hundreds of hissing tea-kettles just about to boil&mdash;then
such a rush of homesickness took her that she would have given all
she had, to know she was going back, once more, to the familiar
little whitewashed room she had shared with Tilly and Jinny.</p>

<p>The seat of the cart was slanting and slippery. Polly was
continually sliding forward, now by inches, now with a great jerk.
At last Mahony noticed it. "You are not sitting very comfortably,
Polly, I fear?" he said.</p>

<p>Polly righted herself yet again, and reddened. "It's my...my
feet aren't long enough," she replied.</p>

<p>"Why, my poor little love!" cried Mahony, full of quick
compunction. "Why didn't you say so?" And drawing rein and getting
down, he stuffed some of Mrs. Beamish's bundles&mdash;fragments of
the feast, which the good woman had sent with them&mdash;under his
wife's feet; stuffed too many, so that Polly drove the rest of the
way with her knees raised to a hump in front of her. All the
afternoon they had been making for dim blue ranges. After leaving
the flats near Geelong, the track went up and down. Grey-green
forest surrounded them, out of which nobbly hills rose like islands
from a sea of trees. As they approached the end of their journey,
they overtook a large number of heavy vehicles labouring along
through the mire. A coach with six horses dashed past them at full
gallop, and left them rapidly behind. Did they have to skirt
bull-punchers who were lashing or otherwise ill-treating their
teams, Mahony urged on the horse and bade Polly shut her eyes.</p>

<p>Night had fallen and a drizzling rain get in, by the time they
travelled the last couple of miles to Ballarat. This was the worst
of all; and Polly held her breath while the horse picked its way
among yawning pits, into which one false step would have plunged
them. Her fears were not lessened by hearing that in several places
the very road was undermined; and she was thankful when
Richard&mdash;himself rendered uneasy by the precious cargo he
bore&mdash;got out and walked at the horse's head. They drew up
before a public-house. Cramped from sitting and numb with cold,
Polly climbed stiffly down as bidden; and Mahony having unloaded
the baggage, mounted to his seat again to drive the cart into the
yard. This was a false move, as he was quick to see: he should not
have left Polly standing alone. For the news of the arrival of
"Doc." Mahony and his bride flew from mouth to mouth, and all the
loafers who were in the bar turned out to stare and to quiz. Beside
her tumulus of trunk, bag, bundle little Polly stood desolate, with
drooping shoulders; and cursing his want of foresight, Mahony all
but drove into the gatepost, which occasioned a loud guffaw. Nor
had Long Jim turned up as ordered, to shoulder the heavy luggage.
These blunders made Mahony very hot and curt. Having himself stowed
the things inside the bar and borrowed a lantern, he drew his
wife's arm through his, and hurried her away.</p>

<p>It was pitch-dark, and the ground was wet and squelchy. Their
feet sank in the mud. Polly clung to Richard's arm, trembling at
the rude voices, the laughter, the brawling, that issued from the
grog-shops; at the continual apparition of rough, bearded men. One
of these, who held a candle stuck in a bottle, was accosted by
Richard and soundly rated. When they turned out of the street with
its few dismal oil-lamps, their way led them among dirty tents and
black pits, and they had to depend for light on the lantern they
carried. They crossed a rickety little bridge over a flooded river;
then climbed a slope, on which in her bunchy silk skirts Polly
slipped and floundered, to stop before something that was half a
tent and half a log-hut.&mdash;What! this the end of the long, long
journey! This the house she had to live in?</p>

<p>Yes, Richard was speaking. "Welcome home, little wife! Not much
of a place, you see, but the best I can give you."</p>

<p>"It's...it's very nice, Richard," said Polly staunchly; but her
lips trembled.</p>

<p>Warding off the attack of a big, fierce, dirty dog, which sprang
at her, dragging its paws down her dress, Polly waited while her
husband undid the door, then followed him through a chaos, which
smelt as she had never believed any roofed-in place could smell, to
a little room at the back.</p>

<p>Mahony lighted the lamp that stood ready on the table, and threw
a satisfied glance round. His menfolk had done well: things were in
apple-pie order. The fire crackled, the kettle was on the boil, the
cloth spread. He turned to Polly to kiss her welcome, to relieve
her of bonnet and mantle. But before he could do this there came a
noise of rowdy voices, of shouting and parleying. Picking up the
lantern, he ran out to see what the matter was.</p>

<p>Left alone Polly remained standing by the table, on which an
array of tins was set&mdash;preserved salmon, sardines, condensed
milk&mdash;their tops forced back to show their contents. Her heart
was heavy as lead, and she felt a dull sense of injury as well.
This hut her home!&mdash;to which she had so freely invited sister
and friend! She would be ashamed for them ever to set eyes on it.
Not in her worst dreams had she imagined it as mean and poor as
this. But perhaps...With the lamp in her hand, she tip-toed
guiltily to a door in the wall: it opened into a tiny bedroom with
a sloping roof. No, this was all, all there was of it: just these
two miserable little poky rooms! She raised her head and looked
round, and the tears welled up in spite of herself. The roof was so
low that you could almost touch it; the window was no larger than a
pocket-handkerchief; there were chinks between the slabs of the
walls. And from one of these she now saw a spider crawl out, a huge
black tarantula, with horrible hairy legs. Polly was afraid of
spiders; and at this the tears began to overflow and to trickle
down her cheeks. Holding her skirts to her&mdash;the new dress she
had made with such pride, now damp, and crushed, and
soiled&mdash;she sat down and put her feet, in their soaked,
mud-caked, little prunella boots, on the rung of her chair, for
fear of other monsters that might be crawling the floor.</p>

<p>And then, while she sat thus hunched together, the voices
outside were suddenly drowned in a deafening noise&mdash;in a
hideous, stupefying din, that nearly split one's eardrums: it
sounded as though all the tins and cans in the town were being
beaten and banged before the door. Polly forgot the tarantula,
forgot her bitter disappointment with her new home. Her black eyes
wide with fear, her heart thudding in her chest, she sprang to her
feet and stood ready, if need be, to defend herself. Where, oh
where was Richard?</p>

<p>It was the last straw. When, some five minutes later, Mahony
came bustling in: he had soothed the "kettledrummers" and sent them
off with a handsome gratuity, and he carried the trunk on his own
shoulder, Long Jim following behind with bags and bundles: when he
entered, he found little Polly sitting with her head huddled on her
arms, crying as though her heart would break.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-1-2-0" id="ch-1-2-0"></a>Part II</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-2-1" id="ch-1-2-1"></a>Chapter I</h3>

<p>Over the fathomless grey seas that tossed between, dissevering
the ancient and gigantic continent from the tiny motherland,
unsettling rumours ran. After close on forty years' fat peace,
England had armed for hostilities again, her fleet set sail for a
foreign sea. Such was the news the sturdy clipper-ships brought
out, in tantalising fragments; and those who, like Richard Mahony,
were mere birds-of-passage in the colony, and had friends and
relatives going to the front, caught hungrily at every detail. But
to the majority of the colonists what England had done, or left
undone, in preparation for war, was of small account. To them the
vital question was: will the wily Russian Bear take its revenge by
sending men-of-war to annihilate us and plunder the gold in our
banks&mdash;us, months removed from English aid? And the opinion
was openly expressed that in casting off her allegiance to Great
Britain, and becoming a neutral state, lay young Australia's best
hope of safety.</p>

<p>But, even while they made it, the proposers of this scheme were
knee-deep in petty, local affairs again. All Europe was depressed
under the cloud of war; but they went on belabouring hackneyed
themes&mdash;the unlocking of the lands, iniquitous licence-fees,
official corruption. Mahony could not stand it. His heart was in
England, went up and down with England's hopes and fears. He
smarted under the tales told of the inefficiency of the British
troops and the paucity of their numbers; under the painful
disclosures made by journalists, injudiciously allowed to travel to
the seat of war; he questioned, like many another of his class in
the old country, the wisdom of the Duke of Newcastle's orders to
lay siege to the port of Sebastopol. And of an evening, when the
store was closed, he sat over stale English newspapers and a map of
the Crimea, and meticulously followed the movements of the
Allies.</p>

<p>But in this retirement he was rudely disturbed, by feeling
himself touched on a vulnerable spot&mdash;that of his pocket.
Before the end of the year trade had come to a standstill, and the
very town he lived in was under martial law.</p>

<p>On both Ballarat and the Bendigo the agitation for the repeal of
the licence-tax had grown more and more vehement; and spring's
arrival found the digging-community worked up to a white heat. The
new Governor's tour of inspection, on which great hopes had been
built, served only to aggravate the trouble. Misled by the golden
treasures with which the diggers, anxious as children to please,
dazzled his eyes, the Governor decided that the tax was not an
outrageous one; and ordered licence-raids to be undertaken twice as
often as before. This defeat of the diggers' hopes, together with
the murder of a comrade and the acquittal of the murderer by a
corrupt magistrate, goaded even the least sensitive spirits to
rebellion: the guilty man's house was fired, the police were
stoned, and then, for a month or more, deputations and petitions
ran to and fro between Ballarat and Melbourne. In vain: the demands
of the voteless diggers went unheard. The consequence was that one
day at the beginning of summer all the troops that could be spared
from the capital, along with several pieces of artillery, were
raising the dust on the road to Ballarat.</p>

<p>On the last afternoon in November work was suspended throughout
the diggings, and the more cautious among the shopkeepers began to
think of closing their doors. In front of the "Diggers' Emporium,"
where the earth was baked as hard as a burnt crust, a little knot
of people stood shading their eyes from the sun. Opposite, on
Bakery Hill, a monster meeting had been held and the "Southern
Cross" hoisted&mdash;a blue bunting that bore the silver stars of
the constellation after which it was named. Having sworn allegiance
to it with outstretched hands, the rebels were lining up to march
off to drill.</p>

<p>Mahony watched the thin procession through narrowed lids. In
theory he condemned equally the blind obstinacy of the authorities,
who went on tightening the screw, and the foolhardiness of the men.
But&mdash;well, he could not get his eye to shirk one of the
screaming banners and placards: "Down with Despotism!" "Who so base
as be a Slave!" by means of which the diggers sought to inflame
popular indignation. "If only honest rebels could get on without
melodramatic exaggeration! As it is, those good fellows yonder are
rendering a just cause ridiculous."</p>

<p>Polly tightened her clasp of his arm. She had known no peace
since the evening before, when a rough-looking man had come into
the store and, with revolver at full cock, had commanded Hempel to
hand over all the arms and ammunition it contained. Hempel, much to
Richard's wrath, had meekly complied; but it might have been
Richard himself; he would for certain have refused; and
then...Polly had hardly slept for thinking of it. She now listened
in deferential silence to the men's talk; but when old
Ocock&mdash;he never had a good word to say for the riotous
diggers&mdash;took his pipe out of his mouth to remark: "A pack o'
Tipperary boys spoilin' for a fight&mdash;that's what I say. An'
yet, blow me if I wouldn't 'a bin glad if one o' my two 'ad 'ad
spunk enough to join 'em,"&mdash;at this Polly could not refrain
from saying pitifully: "Oh, Mr. Ocock, do you really <i>mean</i>
that?" For both Purdy and brother Ned were in the rebel band, and
Polly's heart was heavy because of them.</p>

<p>"Can't you see my brother anywhere?" she asked Hempel, who held
an old spyglass to his eyes.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, sorry to say I can't," replied Hempel. He would
willingly have conjured up a dozen brothers to comfort Polly; but
he could not swerve from the truth, even for her.</p>

<p>"Give me the glass," said Mahony, and swept the line.&mdash;"No,
no sign of either of them. Perhaps they thought better of it after
all.&mdash;Listen! now they're singing&mdash;can you hear them? The
<i>Marseillaise</i> as I'm alive. &mdash;Poor fools! Many of them
are armed with nothing more deadly than picks and shovels."</p>

<p>"And pikes," corrected Hempel. "Several carry pikes, sir."</p>

<p>"Ay, that's so, they've bin 'ammerin' out bits of old iron all
the mornin'," agreed Ocock. "It's said they 'aven't a quarter of a
firearm apiece. And the drillin'! Lord love yer! 'Alf of 'em don't
know their right 'and from their left. The troops 'ull make
mincemeat of 'em, if they come to close quarters."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not!" said Polly. "Oh, I do hope they won't get
hurt."</p>

<p>Patting her hand, Mahony advised his wife to go indoors and
resume her household tasks. And since his lightest wish was a
command, little Polly docilely withdrew her arm and returned to her
dishwashing. But though she rubbed and scoured with her usual
precision, her heart was not in her work. Both on this day and the
next she seemed to exist solely in her two ears. The one strained
to catch any scrap of news about "poor Ned"; the other listened,
with an even sharper anxiety, to what went on in the store. Several
further attempts were made to get arms and provisions from Richard;
and each time an angry scene ensued. Close up beside the thin
partition, her hands locked under her cooking-apron, Polly sat and
trembled for her husband. He had already got himself talked about
by refusing to back a Reform League; and now she heard him openly
declare to some one that he disapproved of the terms of this
League, from A to Z. Oh dear! If only he wouldn't. But she was
careful not to add to his worries by speaking of her fears. As it
was, he came to tea with a moody face.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the foraging parties growing more and more
threatening, Mahony thought it prudent to follow the general
example and put up his shutters. Wildly conflicting rumours were in
the air. One report said a contingent of Creswick dare-devils had
arrived to join forces with the insurgents; another that the
Creswickers, disgusted at finding neither firearms nor quarters
provided for them, had straightway turned and marched the twelve
miles home again. For a time it was asserted that Lalor, the Irish
leader, had been bought over by the government; then, just as
definitely, that his influence alone held the rebel faction
together. Towards evening Long Jim was dispatched to find out how
matters really stood. He brought back word that the diggers had
entrenched themselves on a piece of rising ground near the Eureka
lead, behind a flimsy barricade of logs, slabs, ropes and
overturned carts. The Camp, for its part, was screened by a
breastwork of firewood, trusses of hay and bags of corn; while the
mounted police stood or lay fully armed by their horses, which were
saddled ready for action at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>Neither Ned nor Purdy put in an appearance, and the night passed
without news of them. Just before dawn, however, Mahony was wakened
by a tapping at the window. Thrusting out his head he recognised
young Tommy Ocock, who had been sent by his father to tell "doctor"
that the soldiers were astir. Lights could be seen moving about the
Camp, a horse had neighed&mdash;father thought spies might have
given them the hint that at least half the diggers from the
Stockade had come down to Main Street last night, and got drunk,
and never gone back. With a concerned glance at Polly Mahony
struggled into his clothes. He must make another effort to reach
the boys&mdash;especially Ned, for Polly's sake. When Ned had first
announced his intention of siding with the insurgents, he had
merely shrugged his shoulders, believing that the young vapourer
would soon have had enough of it. Now he felt responsible to his
wife for Ned's safety: Ned, whose chief reason for turning rebel,
he suspected, was that a facetious trooper had once dubbed him
"Eytalian organ-grinder," and asked him where he kept his
monkey.</p>

<p>But Mahony's designs of a friendly interference came too late.
The troops had got away, creeping stealthily through the morning
dusk; and he was still panting up Specimen Hill when he heard the
crack of a rifle. Confused shouts and cries followed. Then a bugle
blared, and the next instant the rattle and bang of musketry split
the air.</p>

<p>Together with a knot of others, who like himself had run forth
half dressed, Mahony stopped and waited, in extreme anxiety; and,
while he stood, the stars went out, one by one, as though a
finger-tip touched them. The diggers' response to the volley of the
attacking party was easily distinguished: it was a dropping fire,
and sounded like a thin hail-shower after a peal of thunder. Within
half an hour all was over: the barricade had fallen, to cheers and
laughter from the military; the rebel flag was torn down; huts and
tents inside the enclosure were going up in flames.</p>

<p>Towards six o'clock, just as the December sun, huge and fiery,
thrust the edge of its globe above the horizon, a number of
onlookers ran up the slope to all that was left of the ill-fated
stockade. On the dust, bloodstains, now set hard as scabs, traced
the route by which a wretched procession of prisoners had been
marched to the Camp gaol. Behind the demolished barrier huts
smouldered as heaps of blackened embers; and the ground was strewn
with stark forms, which lay about&mdash;some twenty or thirty of
them&mdash;in grotesque attitudes. Some sprawled with outstretched
arms, their sightless eyes seeming to fix the pale azure of the
sky; others were hunched and huddled in a last convulsion. And in
the course of his fruitless search for friend and brother, an old
instinct reasserted itself in Mahony: kneeling down he began
swiftly and dexterously to examine the prostrate bodies. Two or
three still heaved, the blood gurgling from throat and breast like
water from the neck of a bottle. Here, one had a mouth plugged with
shot, and a beard as stiff as though it were made of rope. Another
that he turned over was a German he had once heard speak at a
diggers' meeting&mdash;a windy braggart of a man, with a quaint
impediment in his speech. Well, poor soul! he would never mouth
invectives or tickle the ribs of an audience again. His body was a
very colander of wounds. Some had not bled either. It looked as
though the soldiers had viciously gone on prodding and stabbing the
fallen.</p>

<p>Stripping a corpse of its shirt, he tore off a piece of stuff to
make a bandage for a shattered leg. While he was binding the limb
to a board, young Tom ran up to say that the military, returning
with carts, were arresting every one they met in the vicinity. With
others who had been covering up and carrying away their friends,
Mahony hastened down the back of the hill towards the bush. Here
was plain evidence of a stampede. More bloodstains pointed the
track, and a number of odd and clumsy weapons had been dropped or
thrown away by the diggers in their flight.</p>

<p>He went home with the relatively good tidings that neither Ned
nor Purdy was to be found. Polly was up and dressed. She had also
lighted the fire and set water on to boil, "just in case." "Was
there ever such a sensible little woman?" said her husband with a
kiss.</p>

<p>The day dragged by, flat and stale after the excitement of the
morning. No one ventured far from cover; for the military remained
under arms, and detachments of mounted troopers patrolled the
streets. At the Camp the hundred odd prisoners were being sorted
out, and the maimed and wounded doctored in the rude little
temporary hospital. Down in Main Street the noise of hammering went
on hour after hour. The dead could not be kept, in the summer heat,
must be got underground before dark.</p>

<p>Mahony had just secured his premises for the night, when there
came a rapping at the back door. In the yard stood a stranger who,
when the dog Pompey had been chidden and soothed, made mysterious
signs to Mahony and murmured a well-known name. Admitted to the
sitting-room he fished a scrap of dirty paper from his boot. Mahony
put the candle on the table and straightened out the missive. Sure
enough, it was in Purdy's hand&mdash;though sadly scrawled.</p>

<p>HAVE BEEN HIT IN THE PIN. COME IF POSSIBLE AND BRING YOUR TOOLS.
THE BEARER IS SQUARE.</p>

<p>Polly could hear the two of them talking in low, urgent tones.
But her relief that the visitor brought no bad news of her brother
was dashed when she learned that Richard had to ride out into the
bush, to visit a sick man. However she buttoned her bodice, and
with her hair hanging down her back went into the sitting-room to
help her husband; for he was turning the place upside down. He had
a pair of probe-scissors somewhere, he felt sure, if he could only
lay hands on them. And while he ransacked drawers and cupboards for
one or other of the few poor instruments left him, his thoughts
went back, inopportunely enough, to the time when he had been
surgeon's dresser in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. <i>O tempora, O
mores</i>! He wondered what old Syme, that prince of surgeons,
would say, could he see his whilom student raking out a probe from
among the ladles and kitchen spoons, a roll of lint from behind the
saucepans.</p>

<p>Bag in hand, he followed his guide to where the latter had left
a horse in safe-keeping; and having lengthened the stirrups and
received instructions about the road, he set off for the hut in the
ranges which Purdy had contrived to reach. He had an awkward
cross-country ride of some four miles before him; but this did not
trouble him. The chance-touched spring had opened the gates to a
flood of memories; and, as he jogged along, he re-lived in thought
the happy days spent as a student under the shadow of Arthur's
Seat, round the College, the Infirmary and old Surgeons' Square.
Once more he sat in the theatre, the breathless spectator of famous
surgical operations; or as house-surgeon to the Lying-in Hospital
himself assisted in daring attempts to lessen suffering and save
life. It was, of course, too late now to bemoan the fact that he
had broken with his profession. Yet only that very day envy had
beset him. The rest of the fraternity had run to and from the tents
where the wounded were housed, while he, behung with his shopman's
apron, pottered about among barrels and crates. No one thought of
enlisting his services; another, not he, would set (or bungle) the
fracture he had temporarily splinted.</p>

<p>The hut&mdash;it had four slab walls and an earthen
floor&mdash;was in darkness on his arrival, for Purdy had not dared
to make a light. He lay tossing restlessly on a dirty old straw
palliasse, and was in great pain; but greeted his friend with a
dash of the old brio.</p>

<p>Hanging his coat over the chinks in the door, and turning back
his sleeves, Mahony took up the lantern and stooped to examine the
injured leg. A bullet had struck the right ankle, causing an ugly
wound. He washed it out, dressed and bandaged it. He also bathed
the patient's sweat-soaked head and shoulders; then sat down to
await the owner of the hut's return.</p>

<p>As soon as the latter appeared he took his leave, promising to
ride out again the night after next. In spite of the circumstances
under which they met, he and Purdy parted with a slight coolness.
Mahony had loudly voiced his surprise at the nature of the wound
caused by the bullet: it was incredible that any of the military
could have borne a weapon of this calibre. Pressed, Purdy admitted
that his hurt was a piece of gross ill-luck: he had been
accidentally shot by a clumsy fool of a digger, from an ancient
holster-pistol.</p>

<p>To Mahony this seemed to cap the climax; and he did not mask his
sentiments. The pitiful little forcible-feeble rebellion, all along
but a futile attempt to cast straws against the wind, was now
completely over and done with, and would never be heard of again.
Or such at least, he added, was the earnest hope of the law-abiding
community. This irritated Purdy, who was spumy with the
self-importance of one who has stood in the thick of the fray. He
answered hotly, and ended by rapping out with a contemptuous click
of the tongue: "Upon my word, Dick, you look at the whole thing
like the tradesman you are!"</p>

<p>These words rankled in Mahony all the way home.&mdash;Trust
Purdy for not, in anger, being able to resist giving him a flick on
the raw. It made him feel thankful he was no longer so dependent on
this friendship as of old. Since then he had tasted better things.
Now, a woman's heart beat in sympathetic understanding; there met
his, two lips which had never said an unkind word. He pushed on
with a new zest, reaching home about dawn. And over his young
wife's joy at his safe return, he forgot the shifting moods of his
night-journey.</p>

<p>It had, however, this result. Next day Polly found him with his
head in one of the great old shabby black books which, to her mind,
spoilt the neat appearance of the bookshelves. He stood to read,
the volume lying open before him on the top of the cold stove, and
was so deeply engrossed that the store-bell rang twice without his
hearing it. When, reminded that Hempel was absent, he whipped out
to answer it, he carried the volume with him.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-2-2" id="ch-1-2-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>But his first treatment of Purdy's wound was also his last. Two
nights later he found the hut deserted; and diligently as he
prowled round it in the moonlight, he could discover no clue to the
fate of its occupants. There was nothing to be done but to head his
horse for home again. Polly was more fortunate. Within three days
of the fight Ned turned up, sound as a bell. He was sporting a new
hat, a flashy silk neckerchief and a silver watch and chain. At
sight of these kickshaws a dismal suspicion entered Mahony's mind,
and refused to be dislodged. But he did not breathe his
doubts&mdash;for Polly's sake. Polly was rapturously content to see
her brother again. She threw her arms round his neck, and listened,
with her big, black, innocent eyes&mdash;except for their fleckless
candour, the counterpart of Ned's own&mdash;to the tale of his
miraculous escape, and of the rich gutter he had had the good luck
to strike.</p>

<p>Meanwhile public feeling, exasperated beyond measure by the
tragedy of that summer dawn, slowly subsided. Hesitation, timidity,
and a very human waiting on success had held many diggers back from
joining in the final coup; but the sympathy of the community was
with the rebels, and at the funerals of the fallen, hundreds of
mourners, in such black coats as they could muster, marched side by
side to the wild little unfenced bush cemetery. When, too, the
relief-party arrived from Melbourne and martial law was proclaimed,
the residents handed over their firearms as ordered; but an attempt
to swear in special constables failed, not a soul stepping forward
in support of the government.</p>

<p>There was literally nothing doing during the month the military
occupied Ballarat. Mahony seized the opportunity to give his back
premises a coat of paint; he also began to catalogue his collection
of Lepidoptera. Hence, as far as business was concerned, it was a
timely moment for the arrival of a letter from Henry Ocock, to the
effect that, "subject of course to any part-heard case," "our case"
was first on the list for a date early in January.</p>

<p>None the less, the announcement threw Mahony into the fidgets.
He had almost clean forgotten the plaguey affair: it had its roots
in the dark days before his marriage. He wished now he had thought
twice before letting himself be entangled in a lawsuit. Now, he had
a wife dependent on him, and to lose the case, and be held
responsible for costs, would cripple him. And such a verdict was
not at all unlikely; for Purdy, his chief witness, could not be got
at: the Lord alone knew where Purdy lay hid. He at once sat down
and wrote the bad news to his solicitor.</p>

<p>At six o'clock in the morning some few days later, he took his
seat in the coach for Melbourne. By his side sat Johnny Ocock, the
elder of the two brothers. Johnny had by chance been within earshot
during the negotiations with the rascally carrier, and on learning
this, Henry had straightway subpoenaed him. Mahony was none too
well pleased: the boy threatened to be a handful. His old father,
on delivering him up at the coach-office, had drawn Mahony aside to
whisper: "Don't let the young limb out o' yer sight, doc., or get
nip or sip o' liquor. If 'e so much as wets 'is tongue, there's no
'olding 'im." Johnny was a lean, pimply-faced youth, with cold,
flabby hands.</p>

<p>Little Polly had to stay behind. Mahony would have liked to give
her the trip and show her the sights of the capital; but the
law-courts were no place for a woman; neither could he leave her
sitting alone in a hotel. And a tentative letter to her brother
John had not called forth an invitation: Mrs. Emma was in delicate
health at present, and had no mind for visitors. So he committed
Polly to the care of Hempel and Long Jim, both of whom were her
faithful henchmen. She herself, in proper wifely fashion, proposed
to give her little house a good red-up in its master's absence.</p>

<p>Mahony and Johnny dismounted from the coach in the early
afternoon, sore, stiff and hungry: they had broken their fast
merely on half-a-dozen sandwiches, keeping their seats the while
that the young toper might be spared the sight of intoxicating
liquors. Now, stopping only to brush off the top layer of dust and
snatch a bite of solid food, Mahony hastened away, his witness at
heel, to Chancery Lane.</p>

<p>It was a relief to find that Ocock was not greatly put out at
Purdy having failed them. "Leave it to us, sir. We'll make that all
right." As on the previous visit he dry-washed his hands while he
spoke, and his little eyes shot flashes from one to the other, like
electric sparks. He proposed just to run through the morrow's
evidence with "our young friend there"; and in the course of this
rehearsal said more than once: "Good...good! Why, sonny, you're
quite smart." This when Johnny succeeded in grasping his drift. But
at the least hint of unreadiness or hesitation, he tut-tutted and
drew his brows together. And as it went on, it seemed to Mahony
that Ocock was putting words into the boy's mouth; while Johnny,
intimidated, said yes and amen to things he could not possibly
know. Presently he interfered to this effect. Ocock brushed his
remark aside. But after a second interruption from Mahony: "I
think, sir, with your permission we will ask John not to depart
from what he actually heard," the lawyer shuffled his papers into a
heap and said that would do for to-day: they would meet at the
court in the morning. Prior to shaking hands, however, he threw out
a hint that he would like a word with his brother on family
matters. And for half an hour Mahony paced the street below.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day was spent in keeping Johnny out of
temptation's way, in trying to interest him in the life of the
city, its monuments and curiosities. But the lad was too apathetic
to look about him, and never opened his mouth. Once only in the
course of the afternoon did he offer a kind of handle. In their
peregrinations they passed a Book Arcade, where Mahony stopped to
turn the leaves of a volume. Johnny also took up a book, and began
to read.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Mahony. "Would you like to have it, my
boy?"</p>

<p>Johnny stonily accepted the gift&mdash;it was a tale of Red
Indians, the pages smudged with gaudy illustrations&mdash;and put
it under his arm.</p>

<p>At the good supper that was set before him he picked with a
meagre zest; then fell asleep. Mahony took the opportunity to write
a line to Polly to tell of their safe arrival; and having sealed
the letter, ran out to post it. He was not away for more than three
minutes, but when he came back Johnny was gone. He hunted high and
low for him, ransacked the place without success: the boy had
spoken to no one, nor had he been seen to leave the coffee-room;
and as the clock-hands were nearing twelve, Mahony was obliged to
give up the search and go back to the hotel. It was impossible at
that hour to let Ocock know of this fresh piece of ill-luck.
Besides, there was just a chance the young scamp would turn up in
the morning. Morning came, however, and no Johnny with it.
Outwitted and chagrined, Mahony set off for the court alone.</p>

<p>Day had broken dim and misty, and by the time breakfast was over
a north wind was raging&mdash;a furnace-like blast that bore off
the sandy deserts of the interior. The sun was a yellow blotch in a
copper sky; the thermometer had leapt to a hundred and ten in the
shade. Blinding clouds of coarse, gritty dust swept house-high
through the streets: half-suffocated, Mahony fought his way along,
his veil lowered, his handkerchief at his mouth. Outside those
public-houses that advertised ice, crowds stood waiting their turn
of entry; while half-naked barmen, their linen trousers drenched
with sweat, worked like niggers to mix drinks which should quench
these bottomless thirsts. Mahony believed he was the only perfectly
sober person in the lobby of the court. Even Ocock himself would
seem to have been indulging.</p>

<p>This suspicion was confirmed by the lawyer's behaviour. No
sooner did Ocock espy him than up he rushed, brandishing the note
that had been got to him early that morning&mdash;and now his eyes
looked like little dabs of pitch in his chalk-white face, and his
manner, stripped of its veneer, let the real man show through.</p>

<p>"Curse it, sir, and what's the meaning of this, I'd like to
know?" he cried, and struck at the sheet of notepaper with his free
hand. "A pretty fix to put us in at the last minute, upon my word!
It was your business, sir, to nurse your witness...after all the
trouble I'd been to with him! What the devil do you expect us to do
now?"</p>

<p>Mahony's face paled under its top-dressing of dust and moisture.
To Ocock's gross: "Well, it's your own look-out, confound
you!&mdash;entirely your own look-out," he returned a cool:
"Certainly," then moved to one side and took up his stand in a
corner of the hall, out of the way of the jostle and bustle, the
constant going and coming that gave the hinges of the door no
rest.</p>

<p>When after a weary wait the time came to enter court, he
continued to give Ocock, who had been deep in consultation with his
clerk, a wide berth, and moved forward among a number of other
people. A dark, ladder-like stair led to the upper storey. While he
was mounting this, some words exchanged in a low tone behind him
arrested his attention.</p>

<p>"Are you O.K., old man?"</p>

<p>"We are, if our client doesn't give us away. But he has to be
handled like a hot&mdash;" Here the sentence snapped, for Mahony,
bitten by a sudden doubt, faced sharply round. But it was a
stranger who uncivilly accused him of treading on his toe.</p>

<p>The court&mdash;it was not much more than twenty feet
square&mdash;was like an ill-smelling oven. Every chink and crack
had been stopped against the searing wind; and the atmosphere was a
brew of all the sour odours, the offensive breaths, given off by
the two-score odd people crushed within its walls. In spite of
precautions the dust had got in: it lay thick on sills, desks and
papers, gritted between the teeth, made the throat raspy as a
file.</p>

<p>Mahony had given up all hope of winning his case, and looked
forward to the sorry pleasure of assisting at a miscarriage of
justice. During the speech for the plaintiff, however, he began to
see the matter in another light. Not so much thanks to the speaker,
as in spite of him. Plaintiff's counsel was a common little fellow
of ungainly appearance: a double toll of fat bulged over the neck
of his gown, and his wig, hastily re-donned after a
breathing-space, sat askew. Nor was he anything of an orator: he
stumbled over his sentences, and once or twice lost his place
altogether. To his dry presentment of the case nobody seemed to pay
heed. The judge, tired of wiping his spectacles dry, leant back and
closed his eyes. Mahony believed he slept, as did also some of the
jurors, deaf to the Citation of Dawes V. Peck and Dunlop V.
Lambert; to the assertion that the carrier was the agent, the goods
were accepted, the property had "passed." This "passing" of the
property was evidently a strong point; the plaintiff's name itself
was not much oftener on the speaker's lips. "The absconding driver,
me Lud, was a personal friend of the defendant's. Mr. Bolliver
never knew him; hence could not engage him. Had this person not
been thrust upon him, Mr. Bolliver would have employed the same
carrier as on a previous occasion." And so on and on.</p>

<p>Mahony listened hand at ear, that organ not being keyed up to
the mutterings and mumblings of justice. And for all the dullness
of the subject-matter and counsel's lack of eloquence his interest
did not flag. It was the first time he heard the case for the other
side stated plainly; and he was dismayed to find how convincing it
was. Put thus, it must surely gain over every honest,
straight-thinking man. In comparison, the points Ocock was going to
advance shrank to mere legal quibbles and hair-splitting
evasions.</p>

<p>Then the plaintiff himself went into the witness-box&mdash;and
Mahony's feelings became involved as well. This his
adversary!&mdash;this poor old mangy greybeard, who stood blinking
a pair of rheumy eyes and weakly smiling. One did not pit oneself
against such human flotsam. Drunkard was stamped on every inch of
the man, but this morning, in odd exception to the well-primed crew
around him, he was sober&mdash;bewilderedly sober&mdash;and his
shabby clothing was brushed, his frayed collar clean. Recognising
the pitiful bid for sympathy, Mahony caught himself thinking: "Good
Lord! I could have supplied him with a coat he'd have cut a better
figure than that in."</p>

<p>Bolliver clutched the edge of the box with his two hands. His
unusual condition was a hindrance rather than a help to him;
without a peg or two his woolly thoughts were not to be
disentangled. He stammered forth his evidence, halting either to
piece together what he was going to say, or to recollect what he
had just said&mdash;it was clear he went in mortal fear of
contradicting himself. The scene was painful enough while he faced
his own counsel, but, when counsel for the defence rose, a
half-hour followed in which Mahony wished himself far from the
court.</p>

<p>Bolliver could not come to the point. Counsel was merciless and
coarsely jocose, and brought off several laughs. His victim wound
his knotty hands in and out, and swallowed oftener than he had
saliva for, in a forlorn endeavour to evade the pitfalls artfully
dug for him. More than once he threw a covert glance, that was like
an appeal for help, at all the indifferent faces. Mahony drooped
his head, that their eyes should not meet.</p>

<p>In high feather at the effect he was producing, counsel inserted
his left arm under his gown, and held the stuff out from his back
with the tips of all five fingers.</p>

<p>"And now you'll p'raps have the goodness to tell us whether
you've ever had occasion to send goods by a carrier before, in the
course of your young life?"</p>

<p>"Yes." It was a humble monosyllable, returned without
spirit.</p>

<p>"Then of course you've heard of this Murphy?"</p>

<p>"N...no, I haven't," answered Bolliver, and let his vacillating
eyes wander to the judge and back.</p>

<p>"You tell that to the marines!" And after half a dozen other
tricky questions: "I put it to you, it's a well-known fact that
he's been a carrier hereabouts for the last couple o' years or
more?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I sup...sup-pose so." Bolliver's tongue grew
heavy and tripped up his words.</p>

<p>"And yet you've the cheek, you old rogue you, to insinuate that
this was a put-up job?"</p>

<p>"I...I only say what I heard."</p>

<p>"I don't care a button what you heard or didn't hear. What I
ask, my pretty, is do you yourself say so?"</p>

<p>"The...the defendant recommended him."</p>

<p>"I put it to you, this man Murphy was one of the best known
carriers in Melbourne, and <i>that</i> was why the defendant
recommended him&mdash;are you out to deny it?"</p>

<p>"N...n...no."</p>

<p>"Then you can stand down!" and leaning over to Grindle, who was
below him, counsel whispered with a pleased spread of the hand:
"There you are! that's our case."</p>

<p>There was a painful moment just before Bolliver left the
witness-box. As if become suddenly alive to the sorry figure he had
cut, he turned to the judge with hands clasped, exclaimed: "My
Lord, if the case goes against me, I'm done...stony-broke! And the
defendant's got a down on me, my Lord&mdash;'e's made up his mind
to ruin me. Look at him a-setting there&mdash;a hard man, a mean
man, if ever you saw one! What would the bit of money 'ave meant to
'im? But..."</p>

<p>He was rudely silenced and hustled away, to a sharp rebuke from
the judge, who woke up to give it. All eyes were turned on Mahony.
Under the fire of observation&mdash;they were comparing him, he
knew, with the poor old Jeremy Diddler yonder, to the latter's
disadvantage&mdash;his spine stiffened and he held himself
nervously erect. But, the quizzing at an end, he fumbled with his
finger at his neck&mdash;his collar seemed to have grown too tight.
While, without, the hot blast, dark with dust, flung itself against
the corners of the house, and howled like a soul in pain.</p>

<p>Counsel for the defence made an excellent impression.
"Naturally! I can afford to pay a better-class man," was Mahony's
caustic note. He had fallen to scribbling on a sheet of paper, and
was resigned to sitting through an adept presentment of Ocock's
shifts and dodges. But the opening words made him prick up his
ears.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said counsel, "I submit there is here no case to go
to the jury. No written contract existed between the parties, to
bring it within the Statute of Frauds. Therefore, the plaintiff
must prove that the defendant accepted these goods. Now I submit to
you, on the plaintiff's own admission, that the man Murphy was a
common carrier. Your Lordship will know the cases of Hanson V.
Armitage and various others, in which it has been established
beyond doubt that a carrier is not an agent to accept goods."</p>

<p>The judge had revived, and while counsel called the quality of
the undelivered goods in question, and laid stress on the fact of
no money having passed, he turned the pages of a thick red book
with a moistened thumb. Having found what he sought, he pushed up
his spectacles, opened his mouth, and, his eyes bent meditatively
on the speaker, picked a back tooth with the nail of his first
finger.</p>

<p>"Therefore," concluded counsel, "I hold that there is no
question of fact to go to the jury. I do not wish to occupy your
Lordship's time any further upon this submission. I have my client
here, and all his witnesses are in court whom I am prepared to
call, should your Lordship decide against me on the present point.
But I do submit that the plaintiff, on his own showing, has made
out no case; and that under the circumstances, upon his own
evidence, this action must fail."</p>

<p>At the reference to witnesses, Mahony dug his pencil into the
paper till the point snapped. So this was their little game! And
should the bluff not work...? He sat rigid, staring at the chipped
fragment of lead, and did not look up throughout the concluding
scene of the farce.</p>

<p>It was over; the judge had decided in his favour. He jumped to
his feet, and his coat-sleeve swept the dust off the entire length
of the ledge in front of him. But before he reached the foot of the
stairs Grindle came flying down, to say that Ocock wished to speak
to him. Very good, replied Mahony, he would call at the office in
the course of the afternoon. But the clerk left the courthouse at
his side. And suddenly the thought flashed through Mahony's mind:
"The fellow suspects me of trying to do a bolt&mdash;of wanting to
make off without paying my bill!"</p>

<p>The leech-like fashion in which Grindle stuck to his heels was
not to be misread. "This is what they call nursing, I
suppose&mdash;he's nursing <i>me</i> now!" said Mahony to himself.
At the same time he reckoned up, with some anxiety, the money he
had in his pocket. Should it prove insufficient, who knew what
further affronts were in store for him.</p>

<p>But Ocock had recovered his oily sleekness.</p>

<p>"A close shave that, sir, a <i>ve-ry</i> close shave! With
Warnock on the bench I thought we could manage to pull it off. Had
it been Guppy now...Still, all's well that ends well, as the poet
says. And now for a trifling matter of business."</p>

<p>"How much do I owe you?"</p>

<p>The bill&mdash;it was already drawn up&mdash;for "solicitor's
and client's costs" came to twenty odd pounds. Mahony paid it, and
stalked out of the office.</p>

<p>But this was still not all. Once again Grindle ran after him,
and pinned him to the floor.</p>

<p>"I say, Mr. Mahony, a rare joke&mdash;gad, it's enough to make
you burst your sides! That old thingumbob, the plaintiff, ye know,
now what'n earth d'you think 'e's been an' done? Gets outer court
like one o'clock &mdash;'e'd a sorter rabbit-fancyin' business in
'is backyard. Well, 'ome 'e trots an' slits the guts of every
blamed bunny, an' chucks the bloody corpses inter the street. Oh
lor! What do you say to that, eh? Unfurnished in the upper storey,
what? Heh, heh, heh!"</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-2-3" id="ch-1-2-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>How truly "home" the poor little gimcrack shanty had become to
him, Mahony grasped only when he once more crossed its threshold
and Polly's arms lay round his neck.</p>

<p>His search for Johnny Ocock had detained him in Melbourne for
over a week. Under the guidance of young Grindle he had scoured the
city, not omitting even the dens of infamy in the Chinese quarter;
and he did not know which to be more saddened by: the revolting
sights he saw, or his guide's proud familiarity with every shade of
vice. But nothing could be heard of the missing lad; and at the
suggestion of Henry Ocock he put an advertisement in the
<i>Argus</i>, offering a substantial reward for news of Johnny
alive or dead.</p>

<p>While waiting to see what this would bring forth, he paid a
visit to John Turnham. It had not been part of his scheme to
trouble his new relatives on this occasion; he bore them a grudge
for the way they had met Polly's overture. But he was at his wits'
end how to kill time: chafing at the delay was his main employment,
if he were not worrying over the thought of having to appear before
old Ocock without his son. So, one midday he called at Turnham's
place of business in Flinders Lane, and was affably received by
John, who carried him off to lunch at the Melbourne Club. Turnham
was a warm partisan of the diggers' cause. He had addressed a mass
meeting held in Melbourne, soon after the fight on the Eureka; and
he now roundly condemned the government's policy of repression.</p>

<p>"I am, as you are aware, my dear Mahony, no sentimentalist. But
these rioters of yours seem to me the very type of man the country
needs. Could we have a better bedrock on which to build than these
fearless champions of liberty?"</p>

<p>He set an excellent meal before his brother-in-law, and himself
ate and drank heartily, unfolding his very table-napkin with a kind
of relish. In lunching, he inquired the object of Mahony's journey
to town. At the mention of Henry Ocock's name he raised his
eyebrows and pursed his lips.</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! Then it is hardly necessary to ask the upshot."</p>

<p>He pooh-poohed Mahony's intention of staying till the defaulting
witness was found; disapproved, too, the offer of a reward. "To be
paid out of <i>your</i> pocket, of course! No, my dear Mahony, set
your mind at rest and return to your wife. Lads of that sort never
come to grief&mdash;more's the pity! By the bye, how <i>is</i>
Polly, and how does she like life on the diggings?"</p>

<p>In this connection, Mahony tendered congratulations on the
expected addition to Turnham's family. John embarked readily enough
on the theme of his beautiful wife; but into his voice, as he
talked, came a note of impatience or annoyance, which formed an odd
contrast to his wonted self-possession. "Yes...her third, and for
some reason which I cannot fathom, it threatens to prove the most
trying of any." And here he went into medical detail on Mrs. Emma's
state.</p>

<p>Mahony urged compliance with the whims of the mother-to-be, even
should they seem extravagant. "Believe me, at a time like this such
moods and caprices have their use. Nature very well knows what she
is about."</p>

<p>"Nature? Bah! I am no great believer in nature," gave back John,
and emptied his glass of madeira. "Nature exists to be coerced and
improved."</p>

<p>They parted; and Mahony went back to twirl his thumbs in the
hotel coffee-room. He could not persuade himself to take Turnham's
advice and leave Johnny to his fate. And the delay was nearly over.
At dawn next morning Johnny was found lying in a pitiable condition
at the door of the hotel. It took Mahony the best part of the day
to rouse him; to make him understand he was not to be horsewhipped;
to purchase a fresh suit of clothing for him: to get him, in short,
halfway ready to travel the following day&mdash;a blear-eyed,
weak-witted craven, who fell into a cold sweat at every bump of the
coach. Not till they reached the end of the awful
journey&mdash;even a Chinaman rose to impudence about Johnny's
nerves, his foul breath, his cracked lips&mdash;did Mahony learn
how the wretched boy had come by the money for his debauch. At the
public-house where the coach drew up, old Ocock stood grimly
waiting, with a leather thong at his belt, and the news that his
till had been broken open and robbed of its contents. With an
involuntary recommendation to mercy, Mahony handed over the culprit
and turned his steps home.</p>

<p>Polly stood on tip-toe to kiss him; Pompey barked till the roof
rang, making leaps that fell wide of the mark; the cat hoisted its
tail, and wound purring in and out between his legs. Tea was
spread, on a clean cloth, with all sorts of good things to eat; an
English mail had brought him a batch of letters and journals.
Altogether it was a very happy home-coming.</p>

<p>When he had had a sponge-down and finished tea, over which he
listened, with a zest that surprised him, to a hundred and one
domestic details: afterwards he and Polly strolled arm-in-arm to
the top of the little hill to which, before marriage, he used to
carry her letters. Here they sat and talked till night fell; and,
for the first time, Mahony tasted the dregless pleasure of coming
back from the world outside with his toll of adventure, and being
met by a woman's lively and disinterested sympathy. Agreeable
incidents gained, those that were the reverse of pleasing lost
their sting by being shared with Polly. Not that he told her
everything; of the dark side of life he greatly preferred little
Polly to remain ignorant. Still, as far as it went, it was a
delightful experience. In return he confessed to her something of
the uncertainty that had beset him, on hearing his opponent's
counsel state the case for the other side. It was disquieting to
think he might be suspected of advancing a claim that was not
strictly just.</p>

<p>"Suspected?...<i>you?</i> Oh, how could anybody be so
silly!"</p>

<p>For all the fatigues of his day Mahony could not sleep. And
after tossing and tumbling for some time, he rose, threw on his
clothing and went out to smoke a pipe in front of the store.
Various worries were pecking at him&mdash;the hint he had given
Polly of their existence seemed to have let them fairly loose upon
him. Of course he would be&mdash;he was&mdash;suspected of having
connived at the imposture by which his suit was won &mdash;why else
have put it in the hands of such a one as Ocock? John Turnham's
soundless whistle of astonishment recurred to him, and flicked him.
Imagine it! He, Richard Mahony, giving his sanction to these queasy
tricks!</p>

<p>It was bad enough to know that Ocock at any rate had believed
him not averse from winning by unjust means. Yet, on the whole, he
thought this mortified him less than to feel that he had been
written down a Simple Simon, whom it was easy to impose on. Ah
well! At best he had been but a kind of guy, set up for them to let
off their verbal fireworks round. Faith and that was all these
lawyer-fellows wanted&mdash;the ghost of an excuse for parading
their skill. Justice played a negligible role in this battle of
wits; else not he but the plaintiff would have come out victorious.
That wretched Bolliver!...the memory of him wincing and flushing in
the witness-box would haunt him for the rest of his days. He could
see him, too, with equal clearness, broken-heartedly slitting the
gizzards of his, pets. A poor old derelict&mdash;the amen to a life
which, like most lives, had once been flush with promise. And it
had been his Mahony's., honourable portion to give the last kick,
the ultimate shove into perdition. Why, he would rather have lost
the money ten times over!</p>

<p>To divert his mind, he began next morning to make an inventory
of the goods in the store. It was high time, too: thanks to the
recent disturbances he did not know where he stood. And while he
was about it, he gave the place a general clean-up. A job of this
kind was a powerful ally in keeping edged thoughts at bay. He and
his men had their hands full for several days, Polly, who was not
allowed to set foot in the store, peeping critically in at them to
see how they progressed. And, after business hours, there was
little Polly herself.</p>

<p>He loved to contemplate her.</p>

<p>Six months of married life had worked certain changes in his
black-eyed slip of a girl; but something of the doe-like shyness
that had caught his fancy still clung to her. With strangers she
could even yet be touchingly bashful. Not long out of short frocks,
she found it difficult to stand upon her dignity as Mrs. Dr.
Mahony. Besides, it was second nature to Polly to efface herself,
to steal mousily away. Unless, of course, some one needed help or
was in distress, in which case she forgot to be shy. To her
husband's habits and idiosyncrasies she had adapted herself
implicitly&mdash;but this came easy; for she was sure everything
Richard did was right, and that his way of looking at things was
the one and only way. So there was no room for discord between
them. By this time Polly could laugh over the dismay of her first
homecoming: the pitch-dark night and unfamiliar road, the racket of
the serenade, the apparition of the great spider: now, all this
might have happened to somebody else, not Polly Mahony. Her dislike
of things that creep and crawl was, it is true, inborn, and
persisted; but nowadays if one of the many "triantelopes" that
infested the roof showed its hairy legs, she had only to call
Hempel, and out the latter would pop with a broomstick, to do away
with the creature. If a scorpion or a centipede wriggled from under
a log, the cry of "Tom!" would bring the idle lad next door
double-quick over the fence. Polly had learnt not to summon her
husband on these occasions; for Richard held to the maxim: "Live
and let live." If at night a tarantula appeared on the
bedroom-wall, he caught it in a covered glass and carried it
outside: "Just to come in again," was her rueful reflection. But
indeed Polly was surrounded by willing helpers. And small wonder,
thought Mahony. Her young nerves were so sound that Hempel's dry
cough never grated them: she doctored him and fussed over him, and
was worried that she could not cure him. She met Long Jim's
grumbles with a sunny face, and listened patiently to his
forebodings that he would never see "home" or his old woman again.
She even brought out a clumsy good-will in the young varmint Tom;
nor did his old father's want of refinement repel her.</p>

<p>"But, Richard, he's such a kind old man," she met her husband's
admission of this stumbling-block. "And it isn't his fault that he
wasn't properly educated. He has had to work for his living ever
since he was twelve years old."</p>

<p>And Mr. Ocock cried quits by remarking confidentially: "That
little lady o' yours 'as got 'er 'eadpiece screwed on the right
way. It beats me, doc., why you don't take 'er inter the store and
learn 'er the bizness. No offence, I'm sure," he made haste to add,
disconcerted by Mahony's cold stare.</p>

<p>Had anyone at this date tried to tell Polly she lived in a mean,
rough home, he would have had a poor reception. Polly was long
since certain that not a house on the diggings could compare with
theirs. This was a trait Mahony loved in her&mdash;her sterling
loyalty; a loyalty that embraced not only her dear ones themselves,
but every stick and stone belonging to them. His discovery of it
helped him to understand her allegiance to her own multicoloured
family: in the beginning he had almost doubted its sincerity. Now,
he knew her better. It was just as though a sixth sense had been
implanted in Polly, enabling her to pierce straight through John's
self-sufficiency or Ned's vapourings, to the real kernel of
goodness that no doubt lay hid below. He himself could not get at
it; but then his powers of divination were the exact opposite of
Polly's. He was always struck by the weak or ridiculous side of a
person, and had to dig laboriously down to the virtues. While his
young wife, by a kind of genius, saw the good at a glance&mdash;and
saw nothing else. And she did not stint with her gift, or hoard it
up solely for use on her own kith and kin. Her splendid sympathy
was the reverse of clannish; it was applied to every mortal who
crossed her path.</p>

<p>Yes, for all her youth, Polly had quite a character of her own;
and even thus early her husband sometimes ran up against a certain
native sturdiness of opinion. But this did not displease him; on
the contrary, he would have thanked you for a wife who was only an
echo of himself. To take the case of the animals. He had a profound
respect for those creatures to which speech has been denied; and he
treated the four-footers that dwelt under his roof as his fellows,
humanising them, reading his own thoughts into them, and showing
more consideration for their feelings than if they had been able to
speak up for themselves. Polly saw this in the light of an
exquisite joke. She was always kind to Pompey and the stately
Palmerston, and would as soon have forgotten to set Richard's
dinner before him as to feed the pair; but they remained "the dog"
and "the cat" to her, and, if they had enough to eat, and received
neither kicks nor blows, she could not conceive of their souls
asking more. It went beyond her to study the cat's dislike to being
turned off its favourite chair, or to believe that the dog did not
make dirty prints on her fresh scrubbed floor out of malice
prepense; it was also incredible that he should have doggy fits of
depression, in which up he must to stick a cold, slobbery snout
into a warm human hand. And when Richard tried to conciliate
Palmerston stalking sulky to the door, or to pet away the
melancholy in the rejected Pompey's eyes, Polly had to lay down her
sewing and laugh at her husband, so greatly did his behaviour amuse
her.</p>

<p>Again, there was the question of literature. Books to Mahony
were almost as necessary as bread; to his girl-wife, on the other
hand, they seemed a somewhat needless luxury&mdash;less vital by
far than the animals that walked the floor. She took great care of
the precious volumes Richard had had carted up from Melbourne; but
the cost of the transport was what impressed her most. It was not
an overstatement, thought Mahony, to say that a stack of
well-chopped, neatly piled wood meant more to Polly than all the
books ever written. Not that she did not enjoy a good story: her
work done, she liked few things better; and he often smiled at the
ease with which she lived herself into the world of make-believe,
knowing, of course, that it <i>was</i> make-believe and just a kind
of humbug. But poetry, and the higher fiction! Little Polly's
professed love for poetry had been merely a concession to the
conventional idea of girlhood; or, at best, such a burning wish to
be all her Richard desired, that, at the moment, she was convinced
of the truth of what she said. But did he read to her from his
favourite authors her attention <i>would</i> wander, in spite of
the efforts she made to pin it down.</p>

<p>Mahony declaimed:</p>

<p>'TIS THE SUNSET OF LIFE GIVES US MYSTICAL LORE,<br>
AND COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE,</p>

<p>and his pleasure in the swing of the couplet was such that he
repeated it.</p>

<p>Polly wakened with a start. Her thoughts had been miles
away&mdash;had been back at the "Family Hotel". There Purdy, after
several adventures, his poor leg a mass of supuration, had at
length betaken himself, to be looked after by his Tilly; and
Polly's hopes were all alight again.</p>

<p>She blushed guiltily at the repetition, and asked her husband to
say the lines once again. He did so.</p>

<p>"But they don't really, Richard, do they?" she said in an
apologetic tone&mdash;she referred to the casting of shadows. "It
would be so useful if they did&mdash;" and she drew a sigh at
Purdy's dilatory treatment of the girl who loved him so well.</p>

<p>"Oh, you prosaic little woman!" cried Mahony, and laid down his
book to kiss her. It was impossible to be vexed with Polly: she was
so honest, so transparent. "Did you never hear of a certain
something called poetic licence?"</p>

<p>No: Polly was more or less familiar with various other forms of
licence, from the gold-diggers' that had caused all the fuss, down
to the special licence by which she had been married; but this
particular one had not come her way. And on Richard explaining to
her the liberty poets allowed themselves, she shifted uncomfortably
in her chair, and was sorry to think he approved. It seemed to her
just a fine name for wanton exaggeration&mdash;if not something
worse.</p>

<p>There were also those long evenings they spent over the first
hundred pages of <i>Waverley</i>. Mahony, eager for her to share
his enthusiasm, comforted her each night anew that they would soon
reach the story proper, and then, how interested she would be! But
the opening chapters were a sandy desert of words, all about people
duller than any Polly had known alive; and sometimes, before the
book was brought out, she would heave a secret sigh&mdash;although,
of course, she enjoyed sitting cosily together with Richard,
watching him and listening to his voice. But they might have put
their time to a pleasanter use: by talking of themselves, or their
friends, or how further to improve their home, or what the store
was doing.</p>

<p>Mahony saw her smiling to herself one evening; and after
assuring himself that there was nothing on the page before him to
call that pleased look to her young face, he laid the book down and
offered her a penny for her thoughts. But Polly was loath to
confess to wool-gathering.</p>

<p>"I haven't succeeded in interesting you, have I, Pollikins?"</p>

<p>She made haste to contradict him. Oh, it was very nice, and she
loved to hear him read.</p>

<p>"Come, honestly now, little woman!"</p>

<p>She faced him squarely at that, though with pink cheeks. "Well,
not much, Richard."</p>

<p>He took her on his knee. "And what were you smiling at?"</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, I was just thinking of something that happened
yesterday"&mdash;and Polly sat up, agog to tell.</p>

<p>It appeared that the day before, while he was out, the digger's
wife who did Polly's rough work for her had rushed in, crying that
her youngest was choking. Bonnetless, Polly had flown across to the
woman's hut. There she discovered the child, a fat youngster of a
year or so, purple in the face, with a button wedged in its throat.
Taking it by the heels she shook the child vigorously, upside-down;
and, lo and behold! this had the opposite effect to what she
intended. When they straightened the child out again the button was
found to have passed the danger-point and gone down. Quickly
resolved, Polly cut slice on slice of thin bread-and-butter, and
with this she and Mrs. Hemmerde stuffed the willing babe till, full
to bursting, it warded them off with its tiny hands.</p>

<p>Mahony laughed heartily at the tale, and applauded his wife's
prompt measures. "Short of the forceps nothing could have been
better!"</p>

<p>Yes, Polly had a dash of native shrewdness, which he prized. And
a pair of clever hands that were never idle. He had given her leave
to make any changes she chose in the house, and she was for ever
stitching away at white muslin, or tacking it over pink calico.
These affairs made their little home very spick and span, and kept
Polly from feeling dull&mdash;if one could imagine Polly dull! With
the cooking alone had there been a hitch in the beginning. Like a
true expert Mrs. Beamish had not tolerated understudies: none but
the lowliest jobs, such as raisin-stoning or potato-peeling, had
fallen to the three girls' share: and in face of her first fowl
Polly stood helpless and dismayed. But not for long. Sarah was
applied to for the best cookery-book on sale in Melbourne, and when
this arrived, Polly gave herself up to the study of it. She had
many failures, both private and avowed. With the worst, she either
retired behind the woodstack, or Tom disposed of them for her, or
the dog ate them up. But she persevered: and soon Mahony could with
truth declare that no one raised a better loaf or had a lighter
hand at pastry than his wife.</p>

<p>Three knocks on the wooden partition was the signal which, if he
were not serving a customer, summoned him to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, it's ripen beautifully!" And, red with heat and
pride, Polly drew a great golden-crusted, blown-up sponge-cake
along the oven shelf. Richard, who had a sweet tooth, pretended to
be unable to curb his impatience.</p>

<p>"Wait! First I must see..." and she plunged a knife into the
cake's heart: it came out untarnished. "Yes, it's done to a
turn."</p>

<p>There and then it was cut; for, said Mahony, that was the only
way in which he could make sure of a piece. Afterwards chunks were
dealt out to every one Polly knew&mdash;to Long Jim, Hempel, Tommy
Ocock, the little Hemmerdes. Side by side on the kitchen-table,
their feet dangling in the air, husband and wife sat boy-and-girl
fashion and munched hot cake, till their appetites for dinner were
wrecked.</p>

<p>But the rains that heralded winter&mdash;and they set in early
that year&mdash;had not begun to fall when more serious matters
claimed Mahony's attention.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-2-4" id="ch-1-2-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>It was an odd and inexplicable thing that business showed no
sign of improving. Affairs on Ballarat had, for months past, run
their usual prosperous course. The western township grew from day
to day, and was straggling right out to the banks of the great
swamp. On the Flat, the deep sinking that was at present the
rule&mdash;some parties actually touched a depth of three hundred
feet before bottoming&mdash;had brought a fresh host of
fortune-hunters to the spot, and the results obtained bid fair to
rival those of the first golden year. The diggers' grievances and
their conflict with the government were now a turned page. At a
state trial all prisoners had been acquitted, and a general amnesty
declared for those rebels who were still at large. Unpopular
ministers had resigned or died; a new constitution for the colony
awaited the Royal assent; and pending this, two of the
rebel-leaders, now prominent townsmen, were chosen to sit in the
Legislative Council. The future could not have looked rosier. For
others, that was. For him, Mahony, it held more than one element of
uncertainty.</p>

<p>At no time had he come near making a fortune out of
storekeeping. For one thing, he had been too squeamish. From the
outset he had declined to soil his hands with surreptitious
grog-selling; nor would he be a party to that evasion of the law
which consisted in overcharging on other goods, and throwing in
drinks free. Again, he would rather have been hamstrung than stoop
to the tricks in vogue with regard to the weighing of gold-dust:
the greased scales, the wet sponge, false beams, and so on.
Accordingly, he had a clearer conscience than the majority and a
lighter till. But even at the legitimate ABC of business he had
proved a duffer. He had never, for instance, learned to be a really
skilled hand at stocking a shop. Was an out-of-the-way article
called for, ten to one he had run short of it; and the born
shopman's knack of palming off or persuading to a makeshift was not
his. Such goods as he had, he did not press on people; his attitude
was always that of "take it or leave it"; and he sometimes
surprised a ridiculous feeling of satisfaction when he chased a
drunken and insolent customer off the premises, or secured an
hour's leisure unbroken by the jangle of the store-bell.</p>

<p>Still, in spite of everything he had, till recently, done well
enough. Money was loose, and the diggers, if given long credit when
down on their luck, were in the main to be relied on to pay up when
they struck the lead or tapped a pocket. He had had slack seasons
before now, and things had always come right again. This made it
hard for him to explain the present prolonged spell of
dullness.</p>

<p>That there was something more than ordinarily wrong first dawned
on him during the stock-taking in summer. Hempel and he were
constantly coming upon goods that had been too long on hand, and
were now fit only to be thrown away. Half-a-dozen boxes of currants
showed a respectable growth of mould; a like fate had come upon
some flitches of bacon; and not a bag of flour but had developed a
species of minute maggot. Rats had got at his coils of rope, one of
which, sold in all good faith, had gone near causing the death of
the digger who used it. The remains of some smoked fish were
brought back and flung at his head with a shower of curses, by a
woman who had fallen ill through eating of it. And yet, in spite of
the replenishing this involved, the order he sent to town that
season was the smallest he had ever given. For the first time he
could not fill a dray, but had to share one with a greenhorn, who,
if you please, was setting up at his very door.</p>

<p>He and Hempel cracked their brains to account for the
falling-off&mdash;or at least he did: afterwards he believed Hempel
had suspected the truth and been too mealy-mouthed to speak out. It
was Polly who innocently&mdash;for of course he did not draw her
into confidence&mdash;Polly supplied the clue from a piece of
gossip brought to the house by the woman Hemmerde. It appeared
that, at the time of the rebellion, Mahony's open antagonism to the
Reform League had given offence all round&mdash;to the extremists
as well as to the more wary on whose behalf the League was drafted.
They now got even with him by taking their custom elsewhere. He
snorted with indignation on hearing of it; then laughed ironically.
He was expected, was he, not only to bring his personal tastes and
habits into line with those of the majority, but to deny his
politics as well? And if he refused, they would make it hard for
him to earn a decent living in their midst. Nothing seemed easier
to these unprincipled democrats than for a man to cut his coat to
suit his job. Why, he might just as well turn Whig and be done with
it!</p>

<p>He sat over his account-books. The pages were black with bad
debts for "tucker." Here however was no mystery. The owners of
these names&mdash;Purdy was among them&mdash;had without doubt been
implicated in the Eureka riot, and had made off and never returned.
He struck a balance, and found to his consternation that, unless
business took a turn for the better, he would not be able to hold
out beyond the end of the year. Afterwards, he was blessed if he
knew what was going to happen. The ingenious Hempel was full of
ideas for tempting back fortune&mdash;opening a branch store on a
new lead was one of them, or removing bodily to Main
Street&mdash;but ready money was the <i>sine qua non</i> of such
schemes, and ready money he had not got. Since his marriage he had
put by as good as nothing; and the enlarging and improving of his
house, at that time, had made a big hole in his bachelor savings.
He did not feel justified at the present pass in drawing on them
anew. For one thing, before summer was out there would be, if all
went well, another mouth to feed. And that meant a variety of seen
and unforeseen expenses.</p>

<p>Such were the material anxieties he had to encounter in the
course of that winter. Below the surface a subtler embarrassment
worked to destroy his peace. In face of the shortage of money, he
was obliged to thank his stars that he had not lost the miserable
lawsuit of a few months back. Had that happened, he wouldn't at
present have known where to turn. But this amounted to confessing
his satisfaction at having pulled off his case, pulled it off
anyhow, by no matter what crooked means. And as if this were not
enough, the last words he had heard Purdy say came back to sting
him anew. The boy had accused him of judging a fight for freedom
from a tradesman's standpoint. Now it might be said of him that he
was viewing justice from the same angle. He had scorned the idea of
distorting his political opinions to fit the trade by which he
gained his bread. But it was a far more serious thing if his
principles, his character, his sense of equity were all to be
undermined as well. If he stayed here, he would end by becoming as
blunt to what was right and fair as the rest of them. As it was, he
was no longer able to regard the two great landmarks of man's moral
development&mdash;liberty and justice&mdash;from the point of view
of an honest man and a gentleman.</p>

<p>His self-annoyance was so great that it galvanised him to
action. There and then he made up his mind: as soon as the child
that was coming to them was old enough to travel, he would sell out
for what he could get, and go back to the old country. Once upon a
time he had hoped, when he went, to take a good round sum with him
towards a first-rate English practice. Now he saw that this scheme
had been a kind of Jack-o'-lantern &mdash;a marsh-light after which
he might have danced for years to come. As matters stood, he must
needs be content if, the passage-moneys paid, he could scrape
together enough to keep him afloat till he found a modest corner to
slip into.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to say nothing of this to his wife in the
meantime. Why unsettle her? But he had reckoned without the sudden
upward leap his spirits made, once his decision was taken: the
winter sky was blue as violets again above him; he turned out
light-heartedly of a morning. It was impossible to hide the change
in his mood from Polly&mdash;even if he had felt it fair to do so.
Another thing: when he came to study Polly by the light of his new
plan, he saw that his scruples about unsettling her were
fanciful&mdash;wraiths of his own imagining. As a matter of fact,
the sooner he broke the news to her the better. Little Polly was so
thoroughly happy here that she would need time to accustom herself
to the prospect of life elsewhere.</p>

<p>He went about it very cautiously though; and with no hint of the
sour and sorry incidents that had driven him to the step. As was
only natural, Polly was rather easily upset at present: the very
evening before, he had had occasion to blame himself for his
tactless behaviour.</p>

<p>In her first sick young fear Polly had impulsively written off
to Mother Beamish, to claim the fulfilment of that good woman's
promise to stand by her when her time came. One letter gave
another; Mrs. Beamish not only announced that she would hold
herself ready to support her "little duck" at a moment's notice,
but filled sheets with sage advice and old wives' maxims; and the
correspondence, which had languished, flared up anew. Now came an
ill-scrawled, misspelt epistle from Tilly&mdash;doleful, too, for
Purdy had once more quitted her without speaking the binding
word&mdash;in which she told that Purdy's leg, though healed, was
permanently shortened; the doctor in Geelong said he would never
walk straight again.</p>

<p>Husband and wife sat and discussed the news, wondered how
lameness would affect Purdy's future and what he was doing now,
Tilly not having mentioned his whereabouts. "She has probably no
more idea than we have," said Mahony.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," said Polly with a sigh. "Well, I hope he won't
come back here, that's all"; and she considered the seam she was
sewing, with an absent air.</p>

<p>"Why, love? Don't you like old Dickybird?" asked Mahony in no
small surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, quite well. But..."</p>

<p>"Is it because he still can't make up his mind to take your
Tilly&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"That, too. But chiefly because of something he said."</p>

<p>"And what was that, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very silly," and Polly smiled.</p>

<p>"Out with it, madam! Or I shall suspect the young dog of having
made advances to my wife."</p>

<p>"Richard, <i>dear!</i>" Little Polly thought he was in earnest,
and grew exceedingly confused. "Oh no, nothing like that," she
assured him, and with red cheeks rushed into an explanation. "He
only said, in spite of you being such old friends he felt you
didn't really care to have him here on Ballarat. After a time you
always invented some excuse to get him away." But now that it was
out, Polly felt the need of toning down the statement, and added:
"I shouldn't wonder if he was silly enough to think you were
envious of him, for having so many friends and being liked by all
sorts of people."</p>

<p>"Envious of him? I? Who on earth has been putting such ideas
into your head?" cried Mahony.</p>

<p>"It was 'mother' thought so&mdash;it was while I was still
there," stammered Polly, still more fluttered by the fact of him
fastening on just these words.</p>

<p>Mahony tried to quell his irritation by fidgeting round the
room. "Surely, Polly, you might give up calling that woman
'mother,' now you belong to me&mdash;I thank you for the
relationship!" he said testily. And having with much unnecessary
ado knocked the ashes out of his pipe, he went on: "It's bad enough
to say things of that kind; but to repeat them, love, is in even
poorer taste."</p>

<p>"Yes, Richard," said Polly meekly.</p>

<p>But her amazed inner query was: "Not even to one's own
husband?"</p>

<p>She hung her head, till the white thread of parting between the
dark loops of her hair was almost perpendicular. She had spoken
without thinking in the first place&mdash;had just blurted out a
passing thought. But even when forced to explain, she had never
dreamt of Richard taking offence. Rather she had imagined the two
of them&mdash;two banded lovingly against one&mdash;making merry
together over Purdy's nonsense. She had heard her husband laugh
away much unkinder remarks than this. And perhaps if she had
stopped there, and said no more, it might have been all right. By
her stupid attempt to gloss things over, she had really managed to
hurt him, and had made him think her gossipy into the bargain.</p>

<p>She went on with her sewing. But when Mahony came back from the
brisk walk by means of which he got rid of his annoyance, he
fancied, though Polly was as cheery as ever and had supper laid for
him, that her eyelids were red.</p>

<p>This was why, the following evening, he promised himself to be
discreet.</p>

<p>Winter had come in earnest; the night was wild and cold. Before
the crackling stove the cat lay stretched at full length, while
Pompey dozed fitfully, his nose between his paws. The red-cotton
curtains that hung at the little window gave back the lamplight in
a ruddy glow; the clock beat off the seconds evenly, except when
drowned by the wind, which came in bouts, hurling itself against
the corners of the house. And presently, laying down his
book&mdash;Polly was too busy now to be read to&mdash;Mahony looked
across at his wife. She was wrinkling her pretty brows over the
manufacture of tiny clothes, a rather pale little woman still, none
of the initial discomforts of her condition having been spared her.
Feeling his eyes on her, she looked up and smiled: did ever anyone
see such a ridiculous armhole? Three of one's fingers were enough
to fill it &mdash;and she held the little shirt aloft for his
inspection. Here was his chance: the child's coming offered the
best of pretexts. Taking not only the midget garment but also the
hand that held it, he told her of his resolve to go back to England
and re-enter his profession.</p>

<p>"You know, love, I've always wished to get home again. And now
there's an additional reason. I don't want my...our children to
grow up in a place like this. Without companions&mdash;or refining
influences. Who knows how they would turn out?"</p>

<p>He said it, but in his heart he knew that his children would be
safe enough. And Polly, listening to him, made the same
reservation: yes, but <i>our</i> children..."And so I propose, as
soon as the youngster's old enough to travel, to haul down the flag
for good and all, and book passages for the three of us in some
smart clipper. We'll live in the country, love. Think of it, Polly!
A little gabled, red-roofed house at the foot of some Sussex down,
with fruit trees and a high hedge round it, and only the
oast-houses peeping over. Doesn't it make your mouth water, my
dear?"</p>

<p>He had risen in his eagerness, and stood with his back to the
stove, his legs apart. And Polly nodded and smiled up at
him&mdash;though, truth to tell, the picture he drew did not mean
much to her: she had never been in Sussex, nor did she know what an
oast-house was. A night such as this, with flying clouds and a
shrill, piping wind, made her think of angry seas and a dark ship's
cabin, in which she lay deathly sick. But it was not Polly's way to
dwell on disagreeables: her mind glanced off to a pleasanter
theme.</p>

<p>"Have you ever thought, Richard, how strange it will seem when
there <i>are</i> three of us? You and I will never be quite alone
together again. Oh, I do hope he will be a good baby and not cry
much. It will worry you if he does&mdash;like Hempel's cough. And
then you won't love him properly."</p>

<p>"I shall love it because it is yours, my darling. And the baby
of such a dear little mother is sure to be good."</p>

<p>"Oh, babies will be babies, you know!" said Polly, with a new
air of wisdom which sat delightfully on her.</p>

<p>Mahony pinched her cheek. "Mrs. Mahony, you're shirking my
question. Tell me now, should you not be pleased to get back to
England?"</p>

<p>"I'll go wherever you go, Richard," said Polly staunchly.
"Always. And of course I should like to see mother&mdash;I mean my
real mother&mdash;again. But then Ned's here...and John, and Sarah.
I should be very sorry to leave them. I don't think any of them
will ever go home now."</p>

<p>"They may be here, but they don't trouble <i>you</i> often, my
dear," said Mahony, with more than a hint of impatience.
"Especially Ned the well-beloved, who lives not a mile from your
door."</p>

<p>"I know he doesn't often come to see us, Richard. But he's only
a boy; and has to work so hard. You see it's like this. If Ned
should get into any trouble, I'm here to look after him; and I know
that makes mother's mind easier&mdash;Ned was always her
favourite."</p>

<p>"And an extraordinary thing, too! I believe it's the boy's good
looks that blind you women to his faults."</p>

<p>"Oh no, indeed it isn't!" declared Polly warmly. "It's just
because Ned's Ned. The dearest fellow, if you really know him."</p>

<p>"And so your heart's anchored here, little wife, and would
remain here even if I carried your body off to England?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, Richard," said Polly again. "My heart would always be
where you are. But I can't help wondering how Ned would get on
alone. And Jerry will soon be here too, now, and he's younger
still. And <i>how</i> I should like to see dear Tilly settled
before I go!"</p>

<p>Judging that enough had been said for the time being, Mahony
re-opened his book, leaving his wife to chew the cud of innocent
matchmaking and sisterly cares.</p>

<p>In reality Polly's reflections were of quite another nature.</p>

<p>Her husband's abrupt resolve to leave the colony, disturbing
though it was, did not take her altogether by surprise. She would
have needed to be both deaf and blind not to notice that the
store-bell rang much seldomer than it used to, and that Richard had
more spare time on his hands. Yes, trade was dull, and that made
him fidgety. Now she had always known that someday it would be her
duty to follow Richard to England. But she had imagined that day to
be very far off&mdash;when they were elderly people, and had saved
up a good deal of money. To hear the date fixed for six months
hence was something of a shock to her. And it was at this point
that Polly had a sudden inspiration. As she listened to Richard
talking of resuming his profession, the thought flashed through her
mind: why not here? Why should he not start practice in Ballarat,
instead of travelling all those thousands of miles to do it?</p>

<p>This was what she ruminated while she tucked and hemmed. She
could imagine, of course, what his answer would be. He would say
there were too many doctors on Ballarat already; not more than a
dozen of them made satisfactory incomes. But this argument did not
convince Polly. Richard wasn't, perhaps, a great success at
storekeeping; but that was only because he was too good for it. As
a doctor, he with his cleverness and gentlemanly manners would
soon, she was certain, stand head and shoulders above the rest. And
then there would be money galore. It was true he did not care for
Ballarat&mdash;was down on both place and people. But this
objection, too, Polly waived. It passed belief that anybody could
really dislike this big, rich, bustling, go-ahead township, where
such handsome buildings were springing up and every one was so
friendly. In her heart she ascribed her husband's want of love for
it to the "infra dig" position he occupied. If he mixed with his
equals again and got rid of the feeling that he was looked down on,
it would make all the difference in the world to him. He would then
be out of reach of snubs and slights, and people would understand
him better&mdash;not the residents on Ballarat alone, but also
John, and Sarah, and the Beamishes, none of whom really appreciated
Richard. In her mind's eye Polly had a vision of him going his
rounds mounted on a chestnut horse, dressed in surtout and choker,
and hand and glove with the bigwigs of society&mdash;the gentlemen
at the Camp, the Police Magistrate and Archdeacon Long, the rich
squatters who lived at the foot of Mount Buninyong. It brought the
colour to her cheeks merely to think of it.</p>

<p>She did not, however, breathe a word of this to Richard. She was
a shade wiser than the night before, when she had vexed him by
blurting out her thoughts. And the present was not the right time
to speak. In these days Richard was under the impression that she
needed to be humoured. He might agree with her against his better
judgment, or, worse still, pretend to agree. And Polly didn't want
that. She wished fairly to persuade him that, by setting up here on
the diggings where he was known and respected, he would get on
quicker, and make more money, than if he buried himself in some
poky English village where no one had ever heard of him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the unconscious centre of her ambitions wore a
perplexed frown. Mahony was much exercised just now over the
question of medical attendance for Polly. The thought of coming
into personal contact with a member of the fraternity was
distasteful to him; none of them had an inkling who or what he was.
And, though piqued by their unsuspectingness, he at the same time
feared lest it should not be absolute, and he have the ill-luck to
hit on a practitioner who had heard of his stray spurts of
doctoring and written him down a charlatan and a quack. For this
reason he would call in no one in the immediate
neighbourhood&mdash;even the western township seemed too near.
Ultimately, his choice fell on a man named Rogers who hailed from
Mount Pleasant, the rise on the opposite side of the valley and
some two miles off. It was true since he did not intend to disclose
his own standing, the distance would make the fellow's fees mount
up. But Rogers was at least properly qualified (half those claiming
the title of physician were impudent impostors, who didn't know a
diploma from the Ten Commandments), of the same <i>alma mater</i>
as himself&mdash;not a contemporary, though, he took good care of
that!&mdash;and, if report spoke true, a skilful and careful
obstetrician.</p>

<p>When, however, in response to a note carried by Long Jim Rogers
drew rein in front of the store, Mahony was not greatly impressed
by him. He proved to be a stout, reddish man, some ten years
Mahony's senior, with a hasty-pudding face and an undecided manner.
There be sat, his ten spread finger-tips meeting and gently tapping
one another across his paunch, and nodding: "Just so, just so!" to
all he heard. He had the trick of saying everything twice over.
"Needs to clinch his own opinion!" was Mahony's swift diagnosis.
Himself, he kept in the background. And was he forced to come
forward his manner was both stiff and forbidding, so on tenterhooks
was he lest the other should presume to treat him as anything but
the storekeeper he gave himself out to be.</p>

<p>A day or so later who but the wife must arrive to visit
Polly!&mdash;a piece of gratuitous friendliness that could well
have been dispensed with; even though Mahony felt it keenly that,
at this juncture, Polly should lack companions of her own sex. But
Rogers had married beneath him, and the sight of the pursy
upstart&mdash;there were people on the Flat who remembered her
running barefoot and slatternly&mdash;sitting there, in satin and
feathers, lording it over his own little Jenny Wren, was more than
Mahony could tolerate. The distance was put forward as an excuse
for Polly not returning the call, and Polly was docile as usual;
though for her part she had thought her visitor quite a pleasant,
kindly woman. But then Polly never knew when she was being
patronised!</p>

<p>To wipe out any little trace of disappointment, her husband
suggested that she should write and ask one of the Beamish girls to
stay with her: it would keep her from feeling the days long.</p>

<p>But Polly only laughed. "Long?&mdash;when I have so much sewing
to do?"</p>

<p>No, she did not want company. By now, indeed, she regretted
having sent off that impulsive invitation to Mrs. Beamish for the
end of the year. Puzzle as she would, she could not see how she was
going to put "mother" comfortably up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rains were changing the familiar aspect of the
place. Creeks&mdash;in summer dry gutters of baked clay&mdash;were
now rich red rivers; and the yellow Yarrowee ran full to the brim,
keeping those who lived hard by it in a twitter of anxiety. The
steep slopes of Black Hill showed thinly green; the roads were
ploughed troughs of sticky mire. Occasional night frosts whitened
the ground, bringing cloudless days in their wake. Then down came
the rain once more, and fell for a week on end. The diggers were
washed out of their holes, the Flat became an untraversable bog.
And now there were floods in earnest: the creeks turned to foaming
torrents that swept away trees and the old roots of trees; and the
dwellers on the river banks had to fly for their bare lives.</p>

<p>Over the top of book or newspaper Mahony watched his wife
stitch, stitch, stitch, with a zeal that never flagged, at the
dolly garments. Just as he could read his way, so Polly sewed hers,
through the time of waiting. But whereas she, like a sensible
little woman, pinned her thoughts fast to the matter in hand, he
let his range freely over the future. Of the many good things this
had in store for him, one in particular whetted his impatience. It
took close on a twelvemonth out here to get hold of a new book. On
Ballarat not even a stationer's existed; nor were there more than a
couple of shops in Melbourne itself that could be relied on to
carry out your order. You perforce fell behind in the race,
remained ignorant of what was being said and done&mdash;in science,
letters, religious controversy&mdash;in the great world overseas.
To this day he didn't know whether Agassiz had or had not been
appointed to the chair of Natural History in Edinburgh; or whether
fresh heresies with regard to the creation of species had spoiled
his chances; did not know whether Hugh Miller had actually gone
crazy over the <i>vestiges</i>; or even if those arch-combatants,
Syme and Simpson, had at length sheathed their swords. Now,
however, God willing, he would before very long be back in the
thick of it all, in intimate touch with the doings of the most
wide-awake city in Europe; and new books and pamphlets would come
into his possession as they dropped hot from the press.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-2-5" id="ch-1-2-5"></a>Chapter V</h3>

<p>And then one morning&mdash;it was spring now, and piping hot at
noon&mdash;Long Jim brought home from the post-office a letter for
Polly, addressed in her sister Sarah's sloping hand. Knowing the
pleasure it would give her, Mahony carried it at once to his wife;
and Polly laid aside broom and duster and sat down to read.</p>

<p>But he was hardly out of the room when a startled cry drew him
back to her side. Polly had hidden her face, and was shaken by sobs
As he could not get her to speak, Mahony picked up the letter from
the floor and read it for himself.</p>

<p>Sarah wrote like one distracted.</p>

<p>OH, MY DEAR SISTER, HOW CAN I FIND WORDS TO TELL YOU OF THE
TRULY "AWFUL" CALAMITY THAT HAS BEFALLEN OUR UNHAPPY BROTHER.
Mahony skipped the phrases, and learnt that owing to a carriage
accident Emma Turnham had been prematurely confined, and, the best
medical aid notwithstanding &mdash;JOHN SPARED ABSOLUTELY "NO"
EXPENSE&mdash;had died two days later. JOHN IS LIKE A MADMAN.
DIRECTLY I HEARD THE "SHOCKING" NEWS, I AT ONCE THREW UP MY
ENGAGEMENT&mdash;AT "SERIOUS" LOSS TO MYSELF, BUT THAT IS A MATTER
OF SMALL CONSEQUENCE&mdash;AND CAME TO TAKE MY PLACE BESIDE OUR
POOR DEAR BROTHER IN HIS GREAT TRIAL. BUT ALL MY EFFORTS TO BRING
HIM TO A PROPER AND "CHRISTIAN" FRAME OF MIND HAVE BEEN FRUITLESS.
I AM INDEED ALARMED TO BE ALONE WITH HIM, AND I TREMBLE FOR THE
CHILDREN, FOR HE IS POSSESSED OF AN "INSANE" HATRED FOR THE SWEET
LITTLE LOVES. HE HAS LOCKED HIMSELF IN HIS ROOM, WILL SEE "NO ONE"
NOR TOUCH A "PARTICLE" OF NOURISHMENT. DO, MY DEAREST POLLY, COME
AT ONCE ON RECEIPT OF THIS, AND HELP ME IN THE "TRULY AWFUL" TASK
THAT HAS BEEN LAID UPON ME. AND PRAY FORGIVE ME FOR USING THIS
PLAIN PAPER. I HAVE HAD LITERALLY NO TIME TO ORDER MOURNING "OF ANY
KIND."</p>

<p>So that was Sarah! With a click of the tongue Mahony tossed the
letter on the table, and made it clear to Polly that under no
consideration would he allow her to attempt the journey to town.
Her relatives seemed utterly to have forgotten her condition; if,
indeed, they had ever grasped the fact that she was expecting a
child.</p>

<p>But Polly did not heed him. "Oh, poor, poor Emma! Oh, poor dear
John!" Her husband could only soothe her by promising to go to
Sarah's assistance himself, the following day.</p>

<p>They had been entirely in the dark about things. For John
Turnham thought proper to erect a jealous wall about his family
life. What went on behind it was nobody's business but his own. You
felt yourself&mdash;were meant to feel yourself&mdash;the alien,
the outsider. And Mahony marvelled once more at the wealth of love
and sympathy his little Polly had kept fresh for these two, who had
wasted so few of their thoughts on her.</p>

<p>Polly dried her eyes; he packed his carpet-bag. He did this with
a good deal of pother, pulling open the wrong drawers, tumbling up
their contents and generally making havoc of his wife's
arrangements. But the sight of his clumsiness acted as a kind of
tonic on Polly: she liked to feel that he was dependent on her for
his material comfort and well-being.</p>

<p>They spoke of John's brief married life.</p>

<p>"He loved her like a pagan, my dear," said Mahony. "And if what
your sister Sarah writes is not exaggerated, he is bearing his
punishment in a truly pagan way."</p>

<p>"But you won't say that to him, dear Richard...will you? You'll
be very gentle with him?" pleaded Polly anxiously.</p>

<p>"Indeed I shall, little woman. But one can't help thinking these
things, all the same. You know it is written: 'Thou shalt have none
other gods but Me.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But then this was <i>just</i> Emma...and she was
so pretty and so good"&mdash;and Polly cried anew.</p>

<p>Mahony rose before dawn to catch the coach. Together with a
packet of sandwiches, Polly brought him a small black mantle.</p>

<p>"For Sarah, with my dear love. You see, Richard, I know she
always wears coloured dresses. And she will feel so much happier if
she has <i>something</i> black to put on." Little Polly's voice was
deep with persuasion. Richard was none too well pleased, she could
see, at having to unlock his bag again; she feared too, that, after
the letter of the day before, his opinion of Sarah had gone down to
zero.</p>

<p>Mahony secured a corner seat; and so, though his knees
interlocked with those of his <i>vis-a-vis</i>, only one of the
eight inside passengers was jammed against him. The coach started;
and the long, dull hours of the journey began to wear away. Nothing
broke the monotony but speculations whether the driver&mdash;a
noted tippler&mdash;would be drunk before Melbourne was reached and
capsize them; and the drawling voice of a Yankee prospector, who
told lying tales about his exploits in California in '48 until,
having talked his hearers to sleep, he dropped off himself. Then,
Mahony fell to reflecting on what lay before him. He didn't like
the job. He was not one of your born good Samaritans: he relished
intruding as little as being intruded on. Besides, morally to
sustain, to forbear with, a fellow-creature in misfortune, seemed
to him as difficult and thankless a task as any required of one.
Infinite tact was essential, and a skin thick enough to stand snubs
and rebuffs. But here he smiled. "Or my little wife's inability to
recognise them!"</p>

<p>House and garden had lost their air of well-groomed smartness:
the gate stood ajar, the gravel was unraked, the verandah-flooring
black with footmarks. With all the blinds still down, the windows
looked like so many dead eyes. Mahony's first knock brought no
response; at his second, the door was opened by Sarah Turnham
herself. But a very different Sarah this, from the elegant and
sprightly young person who had graced his wedding. Her chignon was
loose, her dress dishevelled. On recognising Mahony, she uttered a
cry and fell on his neck&mdash;he had to disengage her arms by
force and speak severely to her, declaring that he would go away
again, if she carried out her intention of swooning.</p>

<p>At last he got her round so far that she could tell her tale,
which she did with a hysterical overstatement. She had, it seemed,
arrived there just before her sister-in-law died. John was
quarrelling furiously with all three doctors, and, before the end,
insulted the only one who was left in such a fashion that he, too,
marched out of the house. They had to get the dead woman measured,
coffined and taken away by stealth. Whereupon John had locked
himself up in his room, and had not been seen since. He had a
loaded revolver with him; through the closed door he had threatened
to shoot both her and the children. The servants had deserted,
panic-stricken at their master's behaviour, at the sudden collapse
of the well-regulated household: the last, a nurse-girl sent out on
an errand some hours previously, had not returned. Sarah was at her
wits' end to know what to do with the children&mdash;he might hear
them screaming at this moment.</p>

<p>Mahony, in no hesitancy now how to deal with the situation, laid
his hat aside and drew off his gloves. "Prepare some food," he said
briefly. "A glass of port and a sandwich or two, if you can manage
nothing else&mdash;but meat of some kind."</p>

<p>But there was not a morsel of meat in the house.</p>

<p>"Then go to the butcher's and buy some."</p>

<p>Sarah gasped, and bridled. She had never in her life been inside
a butcher's shop!</p>

<p>"Good God, woman, then the sooner you make the beginning the
better!" cried Mahony. And as he strode down the passage to the
door she indicated, he added: "Now control yourself, madam! And if
you have not got what I want in a quarter of an hour's time, I'll
walk out of the house and leave you to your own devices!" At which
Sarah, cowed and shaken, began tremblingly to tie her
bonnet-strings.</p>

<p>Mahony knocked three times at the door of John Turnham's room,
each time more loudly. Then he took to battering with his fist on
the panels, and cried: "It is I, John, your brother-in-law! Have
the goodness to unlock this door at once!"</p>

<p>There was still an instant of suspense; then heavy footsteps
crossed the floor and the door swung back. Mahony's eyes met a
haggard white face set in a dusky background.</p>

<p>"You!" said John in a slow, dazed way, and blinked at the light.
But in the next breath he burst out: "Where's that damned fool of a
woman? Is she skulking behind you? I won't see her&mdash;won't have
her near me!"</p>

<p>"If you mean your sister Sarah, she is not in the house at
present," said Mahony; and stepping over the threshold he shut the
door. The two men faced each other in the twilight.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" demanded John in a hoarse voice. "Have you,
too, come to preach and sermonise? If so, you can go back where you
came from! I'll have none of that cant here."</p>

<p>"No, no, I leave that to those whose business it is. I'm here as
your doctor"; and Mahony drew up a blind and opened a window.
Instantly the level sun-rays flooded the room; and the air that
came in with them smacked of the sea. Just outside the window a
quince-tree in full blossom reared extravagant masses of pink snow
against the blue overhead; beyond it a covered walk of vines shone
golden-green. There was not a cloud in the sky. To turn back to the
musty room from all this lush and lovely life was like stepping
down into a vault.</p>

<p>John had sunk into a seat before a secretaire, and shielded his
eyes from the sun. A burnt-out candle stood at his elbow; and in a
line before him were ranged such images as remained to him of his
dead&mdash;a dozen or more daguerrotypes, of various sizes: Emma
and he before marriage and after marriage; Emma with her first
babe, at different stages of its growth; Emma with the two
children; Emma in ball-attire; with a hat on; holding a book.</p>

<p>The sight gave the quietus to Mahony's scruples. Stooping, he
laid his hand on John's shoulder. "My poor fellow," he said gently.
"Your sister was not in a fit state to travel, so I have come in
her place to tell you how deeply, how truly, we feel for you in
your loss. I want to try, too, to help you to bear it. For it has
to be borne, John."</p>

<p>At this the torrent burst. Leaping to his feet John began to
fling wildly to and fro; and then, for a time, the noise of his
lamentations filled the room. Mahony had assisted at scenes of this
kind before, but never had he heard the like of the blasphemies
that poured over John's lips. (Afterwards, when he had recovered
his distance, he would refer to it as the occasion on which John
took the Almighty to task, for having dared to interfere in his
private life.)</p>

<p>At the moment he sat silent. "Better for him to get it out," he
thought to himself, even while he winced at John's scurrility.</p>

<p>When, through sheer exhaustion, John came to a stop, Mahony cast
about for words of consolation. All reference to the mystery of
God's way was precluded; and he shrank from entering that sound
plea for the working of Time, which drives a spike into the heart
of the new-made mourner. He bethought himself of the children.
"Remember, she did not leave you comfortless. You have your little
ones. Think of them."</p>

<p>But this was a false move. Like a belated thunderclap after the
storm is over, John broke out again, his haggard eyes aflame.
"Curse the children!" he cried thickly. "Curse them, I say! If I
had once caught sight of them since she...she went, I should have
wrung their necks. I never wanted children. They came between us.
They took her from me. It was a child that killed her. Now, she is
gone and they are left. Keep them out of my way, Mahony! Don't let
them near me.&mdash;Oh, Emma...wife!" and here his shoulders
heaved, under dry, harsh sobs.</p>

<p>Mahony felt his own eyes grow moist. "Listen to me, John. I
promise you, you shall not see your children again until you wish
to&mdash;till you're glad to recall them, as a living gift from her
you have lost. I'll look after them for you."</p>

<p>"You will?...God bless you, Mahony!"</p>

<p>Judging the moment ripe, Mahony rose and went out to fetch the
tray on which Sarah had set the eatables. The meat was but a chop,
charred on one side, raw on the other; but John did not notice its
shortcomings. He fell on it like the starving man he was, and
gulped down two or three glasses of port. The colour returned to
his face, he was able to give an account of his wife's last hours.
"And to talk is what he needs, even if he goes on till morning."
Mahony was quick to see that there were things that rankled in
John's memory, like festers in flesh. One was that, knowing the
greys were tricky, he had not forbidden them to Emma long ago. But
he had felt proud of her skill in handling the reins, of the
attention she attracted. Far from thwarting her, he had actually
urged her on. Her fall had been a light one, and at the outset no
bad results were anticipated: a slight haemorrhage was soon got
under control. A week later, however, it began anew, more
violently, and then all remedies were in vain. As it became clear
that the child was dead, the doctors had recourse to serious
measures. But the bleeding went on. She complained of a roaring in
her ears, her extremities grew cold, her pulse fluttered to
nothing. She passed from syncope to coma, and from coma to death.
John swore that two of the doctors had been the worse for drink;
the third was one of those ignorant impostors with whom the place
swarmed. And again he made himself reproaches.</p>

<p>"I ought to have gone to look for someone else. But she was
dying...I could not tear myself away.&mdash;Mahony, I can still see
her. They had stretched her across the bed, so that her head hung
over the side. Her hair swept the floor&mdash;one scoundrel trod on
it...trod on her hair! And I had to stand by and watch, while they
butchered her&mdash;butchered my girl.&mdash;Oh, there are things,
Mahony, one cannot dwell on and live!"</p>

<p>"You must not look at it like that. Yet, when I recall some of
the cases I've seen contraction induced in..."</p>

<p>"Ah yes, if you had been here...my God, if only you had been
here!"</p>

<p>But Mahony did not encourage this idea; it was his duty to
unhitch John's thoughts from the past. He now suggested that, the
children and Sarah safe in his keeping, John should shut up the
house and go away. To his surprise John jumped at the proposal, was
ready there and then to put it into effect. Yes, said he, he would
start the very next morning, and with no more than a blanket on his
back, would wander a hundred odd miles into the bush, sleeping out
under the stars at night, and day by day increasing the distance
between himself and the scene of his loss. And now up he sprang, in
a sudden fury to be gone. Warning Sarah into the background, Mahony
helped him get together a few necessaries, and then walked him to a
hotel. Here he left him sleeping under the influence of a drug, and
next day saw him off on his tramp northwards, over the Great
Divide.</p>

<p>John's farewell words were: "Take the keys of the house with
you, and don't give them up to me under a month, at least."</p>

<p>That day's coach was full; they had to wait for seats till the
following afternoon. The delay was not unwelcome to Mahony; it gave
Polly time to get the letter he had written her the night before.
After leaving John, he set about raising money for the extra fares
and other unforeseen expenses: at the eleventh hour, Sarah informed
him that their young brother Jerry had landed in Melbourne during
Emma's illness, and had been hastily boarded out. Knowing no one
else in the city, Mahony was forced, much as it went against the
grain, to turn to Henry Ocock for assistance. And he was effusively
received&mdash;Ocock tried to press double the sum needed on him.
Fortune was no doubt smiling on the lawyer. His offices had swelled
to four rooms, with appropriate clerks in each. He still, however,
nursed the scheme of transferring his business to Ballarat.</p>

<p>"As soon, that is, as I can hear of suitable premises. I
understand there's only one locality to be considered, and that's
the western township." On which Mahony, whose address was in the
outer darkness, repeated his thanks and withdrew.</p>

<p>He found Jerry's lodging, paid the bill, and took the boy back
to St. Kilda&mdash;a shy slip of a lad in his early teens, with the
colouring and complexion that ran in the family. John's coachman,
who had shown himself not indisposed&mdash;for a substantial sum,
paid in advance&mdash;to keep watch over house and grounds, was
installed in an outbuilding, and next day at noon, after personally
aiding Sarah, who was all a-tremble at the prospect of the bush
journey, to pack her own and the children's clothes, Mahony turned
the key in the door of the darkened house. But a couple of weeks
ago it had been a proud and happy home. Now it had no more virtue
left in it than a crab's empty shell.</p>

<p>He had fumed on first learning of Jerry's superfluous presence;
but before they had gone far he saw that he would have fared ill
indeed, had Jerry not been there. Sarah, too agitated that morning
to touch a bite of food, was seized, not an hour out, with sickness
and fainting. There she sat, her eyes closed, her salts to her nose
or feebly sipping brandy, unable to lift a finger to help with the
children. The younger of the two slept most of the way hotly and
heavily on Mahony's knee; but the boy, a regular pest, was never
for a moment still. In vain did his youthful uncle pinch his leg
each time he wriggled to the floor. It was not till a
fierce-looking digger opposite took out a jack-knife and threatened
to saw off both his feet if he stirred again, to cut out his tongue
if he put another question that, scarlet with fear, little Johnny
was tamed. Altogether it was a nightmare of a journey, and Mahony
groaned with relief when, lamps having for some time twinkled past,
the coach drew up, and Hempel and Long Jim stepped forward with
their lanterns. Sarah could hardly stand. The children, wrathful at
being wakened from their sleep, kicked and screamed.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-2-6" id="ch-1-2-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>For the first time in her young married life, Polly felt vexed
with her husband.</p>

<p>"Oh, he shouldn't have done that...no, really he shouldn't!" she
murmured; and the hand with the letter in it drooped to her
lap.</p>

<p>She had been doing a little surreptitious baking in Richard's
absence, and without a doubt was hot and tired. The tears rose to
her eyes. Deserting her pastry-board she retreated behind the
woodstack and sat down on the chopping-block; and then, for some
minutes, the sky was blotted out. She felt quite unequal, in her
present condition, to facing Sarah, who was so sensitive, so easily
shocked; and she was deeply averse from her fine-lady sister
discovering the straitness of Richard's means and home.</p>

<p>But it was hard for Polly to secure a moment's privacy.</p>

<p>"An' so this is w'ere you're 'idin', is it?" said Long Jim
snappishly&mdash;he had been opening a keg of treacle and held a
sticky plug in his hand. "An' me runnin' my pore ol' legs off arter
you!" And Hempel met her on her entry with: "No further bad news, I
'ope and trust, ma'am?"&mdash;Hempel always retained his smooth
servility of manner. "The shopman <i>par excellence</i>, my dear!"
Richard was used to say of him.</p>

<p>Polly reassured her attendants, blew her nose, re-read her
letter; and other feelings came uppermost. She noticed how scribbly
the writing was &mdash;Richard had evidently been hard pushed for
time. There was an apologetic tone about it, too, which was unlike
him. He was probably wondering what she would say; he might even be
making himself reproaches. It was unkind of her to add to them. Let
her think rather of the sad state poor John had been found in, and
of his two motherless babes. As for Sarah, it would never have done
to leave her out.</p>

<p>Wiping her eyes Polly untied her cooking-apron and set to
reviewing her resources. Sarah would have to share her bed, Richard
to sleep on the sofa. The children...and here she knitted her
brows. Then going into the yard, she called to Tom Ocock, who sat
whittling a stick in front of his father's house; and Tom went down
to Main Street for her, and bought a mattress which he carried home
on his shoulder. This she spread on the bedroom floor, Mrs.
Hemmerde having already given both rooms a sound scouring, just in
case a flea or a spider should be lying perdu. After which Polly
fell to baking again in good earnest; for the travellers would be
famished by the time they arrived.</p>

<p>Towards ten o'clock Tom, who was on the look-out, shouted that
the coach was in, and Polly, her table spread, a good fire going,
stepped to the door, outwardly very brave, inwardly all a-flutter.
Directly, however, she got sight of the forlorn party that toiled
up the slope: Sarah clinging to Hempel's arm, Mahony bearing one
heavy child, and&mdash;could she believe her eyes?&mdash;Jerry
staggering under the other: her bashfulness was gone. She ran
forward to prop poor Sarah on her free side, to guide her feet to
the door; and it is doubtful whether little Polly had ever spent a
more satisfying hour than that which followed.</p>

<p>Her husband, watching her in silent amaze, believed she
thoroughly enjoyed the fuss and commotion.</p>

<p>There was Sarah, too sick to see anything but the bed, to
undress, to make fomentations for, to coax to mouthfuls of tea and
toast. There was Jerry to feed and send off, with the warmest of
hugs, to share Tom Ocock's palliasse. There were the
children...well, Polly's first plan had been to put them straight
to bed. But when she came to peel off their little trousers she
changed her mind.</p>

<p>"I think, Mrs. Hemmerde, if you'll get me a tub of hot water,
we'll just pop them into it; they'll sleep so much better," she
said...not quite truthfully. Her private reflection was: "I don't
think Sarah can once have washed them properly, all that time."</p>

<p>The little girl let herself be bathed in her sleep; but young
John stood and bawled, digging fat fists into slits of eyes, while
Polly scrubbed at his massy knees, the dimpled ups and downs of
which looked as if they had been worked in by hand. She had never
seen her brother's children before and was as heartily lost in
admiration of their plump, well-formed bodies, as her helper of the
costliness of their outfit.</p>

<p>"Real Injun muslin, as I'm alive!" ejaculated the woman, on
fishing out their night-clothes. "An' wid the sassiest lace for
trimmin'!&mdash;Och, the poor little motherless angels!&mdash;Stan'
quiet, you young divil you, an' lemme button you up!"</p>

<p>Clean as lily-bells, the pair were laid on the mattress-bed.</p>

<p>"At least they can't fall out," said Polly, surveying her work
with a sigh of content.</p>

<p>Every one else having retired, she sat with Richard before the
fire, waiting for his bath-water to reach the boil. He was anxious
to know just how she had fared in his absence, she to hear the full
story of his mission. He confessed to her that his offer to load
himself up with the whole party had been made in a momentary burst
of feeling. Afterwards he had repented his impulsiveness.</p>

<p>"On your account, love. Though when I see how well you've
managed&mdash;you dear, clever little woman!"</p>

<p>And Polly consoled him, being now come honestly to the stage of:
"But, Richard, what else could you do?"</p>

<p>"What, indeed! I knew Emma had no relatives in Melbourne, and
who John's intimates might be I had no more idea than the man in
the moon."</p>

<p>"John hasn't any friends. He never had."</p>

<p>"As for leaving the children in Sarah's charge, if you'll allow
me to say so, my dear, I consider your sister Sarah the biggest
goose of a female it has ever been my lot to run across."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you don't really know Sarah yet," said Polly, and
smiled a little, through the tears that had ripen to her eyes at
the tale of John's despair.</p>

<p>What Mahony did not mention to her was the necessity he had been
under of borrowing money; though Polly was aware he had left home
with but a modest sum in his purse. He wished to spare her
feelings. Polly had a curious delicacy&mdash;he might almost call
it a manly delicacy&mdash;with regard to money; and the fact that
John had not offered to put hand to pocket; let alone liberally
flung a blank cheque at his head, would, Mahony knew, touch his
wife on a tender spot. Nor did Polly herself ask questions. Richard
made no allusion to John having volunteered to bear expenses, so
the latter had evidently not done so. What a pity! Richard was so
particular himself, in matters of this kind, that he might write
her brother down close and stingy. Of course John's distressed
state of mind partly served to excuse him. But she could not
imagine the calamity that would cause Richard to forget his
obligations.</p>

<p>She slid her hand into her husband's and they sat for a while in
silence. Then, half to herself, and out of a very different train
of thought she said: "Just fancy them never crying once for their
mother."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>"Talking of friends," said Sarah, and fastidiously cleared her
throat. "Talking of friends, I wonder now what has become of one of
those young gentlemen I met at your wedding. He was...let me
see...why, I declare if I haven't forgotten his name!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know who you mean&mdash;besides there was only one,
Sarah," Mahony heard his wife reply, and therewith fall into her
sister's trap. "You mean Purdy&mdash;Purdy Smith&mdash;who was
Richard's best man."</p>

<p>"Smith?" echoed Sarah. "La, Polly! Why don't he make it
Smythe?"</p>

<p>It was a warm evening some three weeks later. The store was
closed to customers; but Mahony had ensconced himself in a corner
of it with a book: since the invasion, this was the one place in
which he could make sure of finding quiet. The sisters sat on the
log-bench before the house; and, without seeing them, Mahony knew
to a nicety how they were employed. Polly darned stockings, for
John's children; Sarah was tatting, with her little finger stuck
out at right angles to the rest. Mahony could hardly think of this
finger without irritation: it seemed to sum up Sarah's whole
outlook on life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Polly's fresh voice went on, relating Purdy's
fortunes. "He took part, you know, in the dreadful affair on the
Eureka last Christmas, when so many poor men were killed. We can
speak of it, now they've all been pardoned; but then we had to be
very careful. Well, he was shot in the ankle, and will always be
lame from it."</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;go hobbling on one leg for the remainder of his
days? Oh, my dear!" said Sarah, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, because the wound wasn't properly attended to&mdash;he had
to hide about in the bush, for ever so long. Later on he went to
the Beamishes, to be nursed. But by that time his poor leg was in a
very bad state. You know he is engaged&mdash;or very nearly
so&mdash;to Tilly Beamish."</p>

<p>"What?" said Sarah once more. "That handsome young fellow
engaged to one of those vulgar creatures?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sarah...not really vulgar. It isn't their fault they didn't
have a better education. They lived right up-country, where there
were no schools. Tilly never saw a town till she was sixteen; but
she can sit any horse.&mdash;Yes, we hope very much Purdy will soon
settle down and marry her&mdash;though he left the Hotel again
without proposing." And Polly sighed.</p>

<p>"There he shows his good taste, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure he's fond of Tilly. It's only that his life is so
unsettled. He's been a barman at Euroa since then; and the last we
heard of him, he was shearing somewhere on the Goulburn. He doesn't
seem able to stick to anything."</p>

<p>"And a rolling stone gathers no moss!" gave back Sarah
sententiously&mdash;and in fancy Mahony saw the cut-and-dried nod
with which she accompanied the words.</p>

<p>Here Hempel passed through the store, clad in his Sunday best,
his hair plastered flat with bear's-grease.</p>

<p>"Going out for a stroll?" asked his master.</p>

<p>"That was my h'intention, sir. I don't think you'll find I've
left any of my dooties undone."</p>

<p>"Oh, go, by all means!" said Mahony curtly, nettled at having
his harmless query misconstrued. It pointed a suspicion he had had,
of late, that a change was coming over Hempel. The model employee
was a shade less prompt than heretofore to fly at his word, and
once or twice seemed actually to be studying his own convenience.
Without knowing what the matter was, Mahony felt it politic not to
be over-exacting&mdash;even mildly to conciliate his assistant. It
would put him in an awkward fix, now that he was on the verge of
winding up affairs, should Hempel take it in his head to leave him
in the lurch.</p>

<p>The lean figure moved on and blocked the doorway. Now there was
a sudden babble of cheepy voices, and simultaneously Sarah cried:
"Where have you been, my little cherubs? Come to your aunt, and let
her kiss you!"</p>

<p>But the children, who had frankly no great liking for Aunt
Sarah, would, Mahony knew, turn a deaf ear to this display of
opportunism and make a rush for his wife. Laying down his book he
ran out. "Polly...cautious!"</p>

<p>"It's all right, Richard, I'm being careful." Polly had let her
mending fall, and with each hand held a flaxen-haired child at
arm's length. "Johnny, dirty boy! what <i>have</i> you been up
to?"</p>

<p>"He played he was a digger and sat down in a pool&mdash;I
couldn't get him to budge," answered Jerry, and drew his sleeve
over his perspiring forehead.</p>

<p>"Oh fy, for shame!"</p>

<p>"Don' care!" said John, unabashed.</p>

<p>"Don' tare!" echoed his roly-poly sister, who existed but as his
shadow.</p>

<p>"Don't-care was made to care, don't-care was hung!" quoted Aunt
Sarah in her severest copybook tones.</p>

<p>Turning his head in his aunt's direction young John thrust forth
a bright pink tongue. Little Emma was not behindhand.</p>

<p>Polly jumped up, dropping her work to the ground. "Johnny, I
shall punish you if ever I see you do that again. Now, Ellen shall
put you to bed instead of Auntie."&mdash;Ellen was Mrs. Hemmerde's
eldest, and Polly's first regular maidservant.</p>

<p>"Don' care," repeated Johnny. "Ellen plays pillers."</p>

<p>"Edn pays pidders," said the echo.</p>

<p>Seizing two hot, pudgy hands Polly dragged the pair
indoors&mdash;though they held back mainly on principle. They were
not affectionate children; they were too strong of will and set of
purpose for that; but if they had a fondness for anyone it was for
their Aunt Polly: she was ruler over a drawerful of sugar-sticks,
and though she scolded she never slapped.</p>

<p>While this was going on Hempel stood, the picture of indecision,
and eased now one foot, now the other, as if his boots pinched
him.</p>

<p>At length he blurted out: "I was wondering, ma'am&mdash;ahem!
Miss Turnham&mdash;if, since it is an agreeable h'evening, you
would care to take a walk to that 'ill I told you of?"</p>

<p>"Me take a walk? La, no! Whatever put such an idea as that into
your head?" cried Sarah; and tatted and tatted, keeping time with a
pretty little foot.</p>

<p>"I thought per'aps..." said Hempel meekly.</p>

<p>"I didn't make your thoughts, Mr. Hempel," retorted Sarah,
laying stress on the aspirate.</p>

<p>"Oh no, ma'am. I 'ope I didn't presume to suggest such a thing";
and with a hangdog air Hempel prepared to slink away.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" said Sarah double quick; and ceasing to jerk her
crochet-needle in and out, she nimbly rolled up her ball of thread.
"Since you're so insistent...and since, mind you, there's no
society worth calling such, on these diggings..." The truth was,
Sarah saw that she was about to be left alone with
Mahony&mdash;Jerry had sauntered off to meet Ned&mdash;and this
<i>tete-a-tete</i> was by no means to her mind. She still bore her
brother-in-law a grudge for his high-handed treatment of her at the
time of John's bereavement. "As if I had been one of the domestics,
my dear&mdash;a paid domestic! Ordered me off to the butcher's in
language that fairly shocked me."</p>

<p>Mahony turned his back and strolled down to the river. He did
not know which was more painful to witness: Hempel's unmanly
cringing, or the air of fatuous satisfaction that succeeded it.
When he returned, the pair was just setting out; he watched Sarah,
on Hempel's arm, picking short steps in dainty latchet-shoes.</p>

<p>As soon as they were well away he called to Polly.</p>

<p>"The coast's clear. Come for a stroll."</p>

<p>Polly emerged, tying her bonnet-strings. "Why, where's Sarah?
Oh...I see. Oh, Richard, I hope she didn't put on that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She did, my dear!" said Mahony grimly, and tucked his wife's
hand under his arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I wish she wouldn't!" said Polly in a tone of concern.
"She does get so stared at&mdash;especially of an evening, when
there are so many rude men about. But I really don't think she
minds. For she <i>has</i> a bonnet in her box all the time." Miss
Sarah was giving Ballarat food for talk, by appearing on her
promenades in a hat: a large, flat, mushroom hat.</p>

<p>"I trust my little woman will never put such a ridiculous object
on her head!"</p>

<p>"No, never...at least, not unless they become quite the
fashion," answered Polly. "And I don't think they will. They look
too odd."</p>

<p>"Another thing, love," continued Mahony, on whom a sudden light
had dawned as he stood listening to Sarah's trumpery. "I fear your
sister is trifling with the feelings of our worthy Hempel."</p>

<p>Polly, who had kept her own counsel on this matter, went
crimson. "Oh, do you really think so, Richard?" she asked
evasively. "I hope not. For of course nothing could come of it.
Sarah has refused the most eligible offers."</p>

<p>"Ah, but there are none here to refuse. And if you don't mind my
saying so, Poll, anything in trousers seems fish to her net!"</p>

<p>On one of their pacings they found Mr. Ocock come out to smoke
an evening pipe. The old man had just returned from a flying visit
to Melbourne. He looked glum and careworn, but livened up at the
sight of Polly, and cracked one of the mouldy jokes he believed
beneficial to a young woman in her condition. Still, the
leading-note in his mood was melancholy; and this, although his
dearest wish was on the point of being fulfilled.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've got the very crib for 'Enry at last, doc., Billy de
la Poer's liv'ry-stable, top o' Lydiard Street. We sol' poor Billy
up yesterday. The third smash in two days that makes. Lord! I dunno
where it'll end."</p>

<p>"Things are going a bit quick over there. There's been too much
building."</p>

<p>"They're at me to build, too&mdash;'Enry is. But I says no. This
place is good enough for me. If 'e's goin' to be ashamed of 'ow 'is
father lives, 'e'd better stop away. I'm an ol' man now, an' a poor
one. What should I want with a fine noo 'ouse? An' 'oo should I
build it for, even if I 'ad the tin? For them two good-for-nothin's
in there? Not if I know it!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ocock, you wouldn't believe how kind and clever Tom's been
at helping with the children," said Polly warmly.</p>

<p>"Yes, an' at bottle-washin' and sweepin' and cookin' a pasty.
But a female 'ud do it just as well," returned Tom's father with a
snort of contempt.</p>

<p>"Poor old chap!" said Mahony, as they passed out of earshot. "So
even the great Henry's arrival is not to be without its drop of
gall."</p>

<p>"Surely he'll never be ashamed of his father?"</p>

<p>"Who knows! But it's plain he suspects the old boy has made his
pile and intends him to fork out," said Mahony carelessly; and,
with this, dismissed the subject. Now that his own days in the
colony were numbered, he no longer felt constrained to pump up a
spurious interest in local affairs. He consigned them wholesale to
that limbo in which, for him, they had always belonged.</p>

<p>The two brothers came striding over the slope. Ned, clad in blue
serge shirt and corduroys, laid an affectionate arm round Polly's
shoulder, and tossed his hat into the air on hearing that the
"Salamander," as he called Sarah, was not at home.</p>

<p>"For I've tons to tell you, Poll old girl. And when milady sits
there turning up her nose at everything a chap says, somehow the
spunk goes out of one."</p>

<p>Polly had baked a large cake for her darling, and served out
generous slices. Then, drawing up a chair she sat down beside him,
to drink in his news.</p>

<p>From his place at the farther end of the table Mahony studied
the trio&mdash;these three young faces which were so much alike
that they might have been different readings of one and the same
face. Polly, by reason of her woman's lot, looked considerably the
oldest. Still, the lamplight wiped out some of the shadows, and she
was never more girlishly vivacious than with Ned, entering as she
did with zest into his plans and ideas&mdash;more sister now than
wife. And Ned showed at his best with Polly: he laid himself out to
divert her; forgot to brag or to swear; and so natural did it seem
for brother to open his heart to sister that even his egoistic
chatter passed muster. As for young Jerry, who in a couple of days
was to begin work in the same claim as Ned, he sat round-eyed, his
thoughts writ large on his forehead. Mahony translated them thus:
how in the world I could ever have sat prim and proper on the
school-bench, when all this&mdash;change, adventure,
romance&mdash;was awaiting me? Jerry was only, Mahony knew, to push
a wheelbarrow from hole to water and back again for many a week to
come; but for him it would certainly be a golden barrow, and laden
with gold, so greatly had Ned's tales fired his imagination.</p>

<p>The onlooker felt odd man out, debarred as he was by his
profounder experience from sharing in the young people's
light-legged dreams. He took up his book. But his reading was cut
into by Ned's sprightly account of the Magpie rush; by his
description of an engine at work on the Eureka, and of the wooden
airpipes that were being used to ventilate deep-sinkings. There was
nothing Ned did not know, and could not make entertaining. One was
forced, almost against one's will, to listen to him; and on this
particular evening, when he was neither sponging, nor acting the
Big Gun, Mahony toned down his first sweeping judgment of his young
relative. Ned was all talk; and what impressed one so unfavourably
&mdash;his grumbling, his extravagant boastfulness&mdash;was the
mere thistledown of the moment, puffed off into space. It mattered
little that he harped continually on "chucking up" his job. Two
years had passed since he came to Ballarat, and he was still
working for hire in somebody else's hole. He still groaned over the
hardships of the life, and still toiled on&mdash;and all the rest
was just the froth and braggadocio of aimless youth.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-2-7" id="ch-1-2-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>Not twenty-four hours later, Sarah had an accident to her
<i>machoire</i> and returned post-haste to Melbourne.</p>

<p>"A most opportune breakage!" said Mahony, and laughed.</p>

<p>That day at the dinner-table he had given his sister-in-law a
piece of his mind. Sarah had always resented the name bestowed on
her by her parents, and was at present engaged in altering it, in
giving it, so to speak, a foreign tang: henceforth she was to be
not Sarah, but Sara (spoken Sahra). As often as Polly's tongue
tripped over the unfamiliar syllable, Sara gently but firmly put
her right; and Polly corrected herself, even begged pardon for her
stupidity, till Mahony could bear it no longer. Throwing politeness
to the winds, he twitted Sara with her finical affectations, her
old-maidish ways, the morning sloth that expected Polly, in her
delicate state of health, to carry a breakfast-tray to the bedside:
cast up at her, in short, all that had made him champ and fret in
silence. Sara might, after a fitting period of the huff, have
overlooked the rest; but the "old-maidish" she could not forgive.
And directly dinner was over, the mishap to her mouthpiece was made
known.</p>

<p>Too much in awe of Mahony to stand up to him&mdash;for when he
was angry, he was very angry&mdash;Sara retaliated by abusing him
to Polly as she packed her trunk.</p>

<p>"Manners, indeed! To turn and insult a visitor at his own table!
And who and what is he, I should like to know, to speak to me so?
Nothing but a common storekeeper. My dear, you have my deepest
sympathy. It's a <i>dreadful</i> life for you. Of course you keep
everything as nice as possible, under the circumstances. But the
surroundings, Polly!...and the store...and the want of society. I
couldn't put up with it, not for a week!"</p>

<p>Polly, sitting on the side of the tester-bed and feeling very
cast down at Sara's unfriendly departure, shed a few tears at this.
For part of what her sister said was true: it had been wrong of
Richard to be rude to Sara while the latter was a guest in his
house. But she defended him warmly. "I couldn't be happier than I
am; Richard's the best husband in the world. As for his being
common, Sara, you know he comes of a much better family than we
do."</p>

<p>"My dear, common is as common does; and a vulgar calling ends by
vulgarising those who have the misfortune to pursue it. But there's
another reason, Polly, why it is better for me to leave you. There
are certain circumstances, my dear, in which, to put it mildly, it
is <i>awkward</i> for two people of <i>opposite</i> sexes to go on
living under the same roof."</p>

<p>"Sarah!&mdash;I mean Sara&mdash;do you really mean to say Hempel
has made you a proposal?" cried Polly, wide-eyed in her tears.</p>

<p>"I won't say, my dear, that he has so far forgotten himself as
to actually offer marriage. But he has let me see only too plainly
what his feelings are. Of course, I've kept him in his
place&mdash;the preposterous creature! But all the same it's not
<i>comme il faut</i> any longer for me to be here."</p>

<p>"Did she say where she was going, or what she intended to do?"
Mahony inquired of his wife that night as she bound the strings of
her nightcap.</p>

<p>No, she hadn't, Polly admitted, rather out of countenance. But
then Sara was like that&mdash;very close about her own affairs. "I
think she's perhaps gone back to her last situation. She had
several letters while she was here, in that lady's hand. People are
always glad to get her back. Not many finishing governesses can
teach all she can"&mdash;and Polly checked off Sara's attainments
on the fingers of both hands. "She won't go anywhere under two
hundred a year."</p>

<p>"A most accomplished person, your sister!" said Mahony sleepily.
"Still, it's very pleasant to be by ourselves again&mdash;eh,
wife?"</p>

<p>An even more blessed peace shortly descended on the house; for
the time was now come to get rid of the children as well. Since
nothing had been heard of John, they were to be boarded out over
Polly's illness. Through the butcher's lady, arrangements were made
with a trooper's wife, who lived outside the racket and dust of the
township, and had a whole posse of little ones of her
own.&mdash;"Bless you! half-a-dozen more wouldn't make any
difference to me. There's the paddock for 'em to run wild in." This
was the best that could be done for the children. Polly packed
their little kit, dealt out a parting bribe of barley-sugar, and
saw them hoisted into the dray that would pass the door of their
destination.</p>

<p>Once more husband and wife sat alone together, as in the days
before John's domestic catastrophe. And now Mahony said
tentatively: "Don't you think, love, we could manage to get on
without that old Beamish woman? I'll guarantee to nurse you as well
as any female alive."</p>

<p>The question did not come as a surprise to Polly; she had
already put it to herself. After the affair with Sara she awaited
her new visitor in fear and trembling. Sara had at least stood in
awe of Richard and held her tongue before him; Mrs. Beamish prided
herself on being afraid of nobody, and on always speaking her mind.
And yet, even while agreeing that it would be well to put "mother"
off, Polly drooped her wings. At a time like this a woman was a
woman. It seemed as if even the best of husbands did not quite
understand.</p>

<p>"Just give her the hint we don't want her," said Mahony
airily.</p>

<p>But "mother" was not the person to take a hint, no matter how
broad. It was necessary to be blunt to the point of rudeness; and
Polly spent a difficult hour over the composition of her letter.
She might have saved her pains. Mrs. Beamish replied that she knew
her darling little Polly's unwillingness to give trouble; but it
was not likely she would now go back on her word: she had been
packed and ready to start for the past week. Polly handed the
letter to her husband, and did not say what she thought she read
out of it, namely that "mother," who so seldom could be spared from
home, was looking forward with pleasure to her trip to
Ballarat.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's a case of making the best of a bad job," sighed
Mahony; and having one day drawn Mrs. Beamish, at melting point,
from the inside of a crowded coach, he loaded Long Jim with her
bags and bundles.</p>

<p>His aversion was not lightened by his subsequently coming on his
wife in the act of unpacking a hamper, which contained half a ham,
a stone jar of butter, some home-made loaves of bread, a bag of
vegetables and a plum pudding. "Good God! does the woman think we
can't give her enough to eat?" he asked testily. He had all the
poor Irishman's distrust of a gift.</p>

<p>"She means it kindly, dear. She probably thought things were
still scarce here; and she knew I wouldn't be able to do much
cooking," pleaded Polly. And going out to the kitchen she untied
the last parcel, in which was a big round cheese, by stealth.</p>

<p>She had pulled Mrs. Beamish over the threshold, had got her into
the bedroom and shut the door, before any of the "ohs" and "ahs"
she saw painted on the broad, rubicund face could be transformed
into words. And hugs and kisses over, she bravely seized the bull
by the horns and begged her guest not to criticise house or
furnishings in front of Richard.</p>

<p>It took Mrs. Beamish a minute or two to grasp her meaning. Then,
she said heartily: "There, there, my duck, don't you worry! I'll be
as mum as mum." And in a whisper: "So, 'e's got a temper, Polly,
'as 'e? But this I will say: if I'd known this was all 'e 'ad to
h'offer you, I'd 'a' said, stop w'ere you are, my lamb, in a
comfortable, 'appy 'ome."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>am</i> happy, mother dear, indeed I am!" cried Polly.
"I've never regretted being married&mdash;never once!"</p>

<p>"There, there, now!"</p>

<p>"And it's only...I mean...this is the best we can afford in the
meantime, and if I am satisfied..." floundered Polly, dismayed to
hear her words construed into blame of her husband. "It's only that
it upsets Richard if people speak slightingly of our house, and
that upsets me&mdash;and I musn't be worried just now, you know,"
she added with a somewhat shaky smile.</p>

<p>"Not a word will I say, ducky, make yer pore little mind easy
about that. Though such a poky little 'en-coop of a place I never
was in!"&mdash;and, while tying her cap-strings, Mrs. Beamish swept
the little bedroom and its sloping roof with a withering glance. "I
was 'orrified, girls, simply <i>'orrified</i>!" she related the
incident to her daughters. "An' I up an' told 'er so&mdash;just
like me, you know. Not room enough to swing a cat in, and 'im
sittin' at the 'ead of the table as 'igh an' mighty as a dook! You
can thank yer stars, you two, 'e didn't take one o' you instead o'
Polly." But this was chiefly by way of a consolation-prize for
Tilly and Jinny.</p>

<p>"An' now, my dear, tell me <i>everything</i>." With these words,
Mrs. Beamish spread her skirts and settled down to a cosy chat on
the subject of Polly's hopes.</p>

<p>But like the majority of her sex she was an adept at dividing
her attention; and while making delicate inquiries of the young
wife, she was also travelling her shrewd eye round the little
bedchamber, spying out and appraising: not one of poor Polly's
makeshifts escaped her. The result of her inspection was to cause
her to feel justly indignant with Mahony. The idea! Him to rob them
of Polly just to dump her down in a place like this! She would
never be able to resist telling him what she thought of him.</p>

<p>Here, however, she reckoned without Polly. Polly was sharp
enough to doubt "mother's" ability to hold her tongue; and saw to
it that Richard and she were not left alone together. And of an
evening when talk languished, she would beg her husband to read to
them from the <i>Ballarat Star</i>, until, as often as not, Mrs.
Beamish fell asleep. Frequently, too, she persuaded him to go out
and take a hand in a newlyformed whist club, or discuss politics
with a neighbour.</p>

<p>Mahony went willingly enough; his home was less home than ever
since the big woman's intrusion. Even his food lost its savour.
Mrs. Beamish had taken over the cooking, and she went about it with
an air that implied he had not had a decent bite to eat since his
marriage.</p>

<p>"There! what do you say to that now? That's something
<i>like</i> a pudding!" and a great plum-duff was planked
triumphantly down in the middle of the dinner-table. "Lor, Polly!
your bit of a kitchen...in this weather...I'm fair dished." And the
good woman mopped her streaming face and could herself eat
nothing.</p>

<p>Mahony much preferred his wife's cooking, which took account of
his tastes&mdash;it was done, too, without any fuss&mdash;and he
persisted in upholding Polly's skill, in face of Mrs. Beamish's
good-natured disbelief. Polly, on edge, lest he should openly state
his preference, nervously held out her plate.</p>

<p>"It's so good, mother, I must have a second helping," she
declared; and then, without appetite in the cruel, midday heat, did
not know what to do with the solid slab of pudding. Pompey and
Palmerston got into the way of sitting very close to her chair.</p>

<p>She confided to Richard that Mrs. Beamish disapproved of his
evening outings. "Many an 'usband takes to goin' out at such a
time, my dear, an' never gets back the 'abit of stoppin' at 'ome.
So just you be careful, ducky!" This was a standing joke between
them. Mahony would wink at Polly when he put his hat on, and wear
it rakishly askew.</p>

<p>However, he quite enjoyed a crack with the postmaster or the
town-surveyor, at this juncture. Colonial politics were more
interesting than usual. The new Constitution had been proclaimed,
and a valiant effort was being made to form a Cabinet; to induce,
that was, a sufficient number of well-to-do men to give up time to
the service of their country. It looked as if the attempt were
going to fail, just as on the goldfields the Local Courts, by which
since the Stockade the diggers governed themselves, were failing,
because none could afford to spend his days sitting in them.</p>

<p>Yet however high the discussion ran, he kept one ear turned
towards his home. Here, things were at a standstill. Polly's time
had come and gone &mdash;but there was no end set to their
suspense. It was blazing hot now in the little log house; walls and
roof were black with flies; mosquitoes made the nights hideous.
Even Polly lost patience with herself when, morning after morning,
she got up feeling as well as ever, and knowing that she had to
steer through another difficult day.</p>

<p>It was not the suspense alone: the strain of keeping the peace
was growing too much for her.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>don't</i> quarrel with her, Richard, for my sake," she
begged her husband one night. "She means so well. And she can't
help being like she is&mdash;she has always been accustomed to
order Mr. Beamish about. But I wish she had never, never come,"
sobbed poor Polly. And Mahony, in a sudden flash of enlightenment,
put his arms round her, and made humble promises. Not another word
should cross his lips! "Though I'd like nothing so well as to throw
her out, and her bags and bundles after her. Come, laugh a little,
my Polly. Think of the old lady flying down the slope, with her
packages in a shower about her head!"</p>

<p>Rogers, M.D., looked in whenever he passed. At this stage he was
of the jocular persuasion. "Still an unwelcome visitor, ma'am? No
little tidbit of news for me to-day?" There he sat, twiddling his
thumbs, reiterating his singsong: "Just so!" and looking wise as an
owl. Mahony knew the air &mdash;had many a time seen it donned to
cloak perplexity&mdash;and covert doubts of Rogers' ability began
to assail him. But then he fell mentally foul of every one he came
in touch with, at present: Ned, for the bare-faced fashion in which
he left his cheerfulness on the door-mat; Mrs. Beamish for the
eternal "Pore lamb!" with which she beplastered Polly, and the
antiquated reckoning-table she embarrassed them by consulting.</p>

<p>However, this state of things could not last for ever, and at
dawn, one hot January day, Polly was taken ill.</p>

<p>The early hours promised well. But the morning wore on, turned
to midday, then to afternoon, and matters still hung fire. While
towards six o'clock the patient dismayed them by sitting up in bed,
saying she felt much better, and asking for a cup of tea. This
drew: "Ah, my pore lamb, you've got to feel worse yet afore you're
better!" from Mrs. Beamish.</p>

<p>It ended in Rogers taking up his quarters there, for the
night.</p>

<p>Towards eleven o'clock Mahony and he sat, one on each side of
the table, in the little sitting-room. The heat was insupportable
and all three doors and the window were propped open, in the feeble
hope of creating a draught. The lamp had attracted a swarm of
flying things: giant moths beat their wings against the globe, or
fell singed and sizzling down the chimney; winged-ants alighted
with a click upon the table; blowflies and mosquitoes kept up a
dizzy hum.</p>

<p>From time to time Mahony rose and stole into the bedroom, where
Mrs. Beamish sat fanning the pests off Polly, who was in a feverish
doze. Leaning over his wife he let his finger lie on her wrist;
and, back again in the outer room, he bit nervously at his
little-finger nail&mdash;an old trick of his when in a quandary. He
had curtly refused a game of bezique; so Rogers had produced a pack
of cards from his own pocket&mdash;soiled, frayed cards, which had
likely done service on many a similar occasion&mdash;and was
whiling the time away with solitaire. To sit there watching his
slow manipulation of the cards, his patent intentness on the game;
to listen any longer to the accursed din of the gnats and flies
passed Mahony's powers of endurance. Abruptly shoving back his
chair, he went out into the yard.</p>

<p>This was some twenty paces across&mdash;from the row of old
kerosene-tins that constituted his flower-garden, past shed and
woodstack to the post-and-rail fence. How often he walked it he did
not know; but when he went indoors again, his boots were heavy with
mud. For a brief summer storm had come up earlier in the evening. A
dense black pall of cloud had swept like a heavy curtain over the
stars, to the tune of flash and bang. Now, all was clear and calm
again; the white star-dust of the Milky Way powdered the sky just
overhead; and though the heat was still intense, the air had a
fragrant smell of saturated dust and rain-soaked earth&mdash;he
could hear streamlets of water trickling down the hillside to the
river below.</p>

<p>Out there in the dark, several things became plain to him. He
saw that he had not had any real confidence in Rogers from the
start; while the effect of the evening spent at close quarters had
been to sink his opinion to nothing. Rogers belonged to an old
school; his method was to sit by and let nature take its
course&mdash;perhaps just this slowness to move had won him a name
for extreme care. His old fogyism showed up unmistakably in a short
but heated argument they had had on the subject of chloroform. He
cited such hoary objections to the use of the new anaesthetic in
maternity cases as Mahony had never expected to hear again: the
therapeutic value of pain; the moral danger the patient ran in
yielding up her will ("What right have we to bid a fellow-creature
sacrifice her consciousness?") and the impious folly of interfering
with the action of a creative law. It had only remained for him to
quote Genesis, and the talking serpent!</p>

<p>Had the case been in his own hands he would have intervened
before now. Rogers, on the contrary, was still satisfied with the
shape of affairs&mdash;or made pretence to be. For, watching
lynx-eyed, Mahony fancied each time the fat man propelled his
paunch out of the sickroom it was a shade less surely: there were
nuances, too, in the way he pronounced his vapid: "As long as our
strength is well maintained...well maintained." Mahony doubted
Polly's ability to bear much more; and he made bold to know his own
wife's constitution best. Rogers was shilly-shallying: what if he
delayed too long and Polly slipped through his hands? Lose Polly?
Good God! the very thought turned him cold. And alive to his
finger-tips with the superstition of his race, he impetuously
offered up his fondest dream to those invisible powers that sat
aloft, waiting to be appeased. If this was to be the price exacted
of him&mdash;the price of his escape from
exile&mdash;then...then...To come back to the present, however, he
was in an awkward position: he was going to be forced to take
Polly's case out of the hands of the man to whom he had entrusted
it. Such a step ran counter to all the stiff rules of conduct, the
punctilios of decorum, laid down by the most code-ridden profession
in the world.</p>

<p>But a fresh visit to Polly, whose pulse had grown markedly
softer, put an end to his scruples.</p>

<p>Stalking into the sitting-room he said without preamble: "In my
opinion any further delay will mean a risk to my wife. I request
you to operate immediately."</p>

<p>Rogers blinked up from his cards, surprise writ across his ruddy
countenance. He pushed his spectacles to his forehead. "Eh? What?
Well, well...yes, the time is no doubt coming when we shall have to
lend Mother Nature a hand."</p>

<p>"Coming? It's come...and gone. Are you blind, man?"</p>

<p>Rogers had faced many an agitated husband in his day. "Now, now,
Mr. Mahony," he said soothingly, and laid his last two cards in
line. "You must allow me to be the judge of that. Besides," he
added, as he took off his glasses to polish them on a red bandanna;
"besides, I should have to ask you to go out and get some one to
assist me."</p>

<p>"I shall assist you," returned Mahony.</p>

<p>Rogers smiled his broad, fat smile. "Easier said than done, my
good sir!...easier said than done."</p>

<p>Mahony considerately turned his back; and kept it turned.
Emptying a pitcher of water into a basin he began to lather his
hands. "I am a qualified medical man. Of the same university as
yourself. I studied under Simpson." It cost him an effort to get
the words out. But, by speaking, he felt that he did ample penance
for the fit of tetchy pride which, in the first instance, had tied
his tongue.</p>

<p>Rogers was dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word!" he ejaculated, letting his hands with
glasses and handkerchief fall to the table. "God bless my soul! why
couldn't you say so before? And why the deuce didn't you yourself
attend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We can go into all that afterwards."</p>

<p>But Rogers was not one of those who could deal rapidly with the
unexpected: he continued to vent his surprise, and to shoot
distrustful glances at his companion. He was flurried, too, at
being driven forward quicker than he had a mind to go, and said
sulkily that Mahony must take full responsibility for what they
were about to do. Mahony hardly heard him; he was looking at the
instruments laid out on the table. His fingers itched to close
round them.</p>

<p>"I'll prepare my wife," he said briskly. And going into the
bedroom he bent over the pillow. It was damp with the sweat that
had dripped from Polly's head when the pains were on her.</p>

<p>"'Ere, you girl, get in quick now with your bucket and cloth,
and give that place a good clean-up afore that pore lamb opens 'er
eyes again. I'm cooked&mdash;that's what I am!" and sitting heavily
down on the kitchen-chair, Mrs. Beamish wiped her face towards the
four points of the compass.</p>

<p>Piqued by an unholy curiosity young Ellen willingly obeyed. But
a minute later she was back, having done no more than set her pail
down inside the bedroom door. "Oh, sure, Mrs. Beamish, and I can't
do't!" she cried shrilly. "It's jus' like Andy Soakes's shop...when
they've bin quarterin' a sheep."</p>

<p>"I'll <i>quarter</i> you, you lazy trollop, you!" cried Mrs.
Beamish, rising to her aching legs again; and her day-old anxiety
found vent in a hearty burst of temper. "I'll teach you!" pulling,
as she spoke, the floorcloth out of the girl's hand. "Such airs and
graces! Why, sooner or later, milady, you've got to go through it
yourself."</p>

<p>"<i>Me</i>...? Catch me!" said Ellen, with enormous emphasis.
"D'yer mean to say that's 'ow...'ow the children always come?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is, you mincing Nanny-hen!&mdash;every blessed
child that walks. And I just 'ope," said Mrs. Beamish, as she
marched off herself with brush and scrubber: "I 'ope, now you know
it, you'll 'ave a little more love and gratitoode for your own
mother than ever you 'ad before."</p>

<p>"Oh lor!" said the girl. "Oh, lor!" And plumping down on the
chopping-block she snatched her apron to her face and began to
cry.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-1-2-8" id="ch-1-2-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>Two months passed before Mahony could help Polly and Mrs.
Beamish into the coach bound for Geelong.</p>

<p>It had been touch and go with Polly; and for weeks her condition
had kept him anxious. With the inset of the second month, however,
she seemed fairly to turn the corner, and from then on made a
steady recovery, thanks to her youth and an unimpaired
vitality.</p>

<p>He had hurried the little cradle out of sight. But Polly was
quick to miss it, and quite approved of its having been given to a
needy expectant mother near by. Altogether she bore the thwarting
of her hopes bravely.</p>

<p>"Poor little baby, I should have been very fond of it," was all
she said, when she was well enough to fold and pack away the tiny
garments at which she had stitched with such pleasure.</p>

<p>It was not to Mahony's mind that she returned with Mrs.
Beamish&mdash;but what else could be done? After lying a prisoner
through the hot summer, she was sadly in need of a change. And Mrs.
Beamish promised her a diet of unlimited milk and eggs, as well as
the do nothing life that befitted an invalid. Just before they
left, a letter arrived from John demanding the keys of his house,
and proposing that Polly should come to town to set it in order for
him, and help him to engage a housekeeper. A niggardly&mdash;a
truly "John-ish"&mdash;fashion of giving an invitation, thought
Mahony, and was not for his wife accepting it. But Polly was so
pleased at the prospect of seeing her brother that he ended by
agreeing to her going on to Melbourne as soon as she had thoroughly
recuperated.</p>

<p>Peace between him and Mrs. Beamish was dearly bought up to the
last; they barely avoided a final explosion. At the beginning of
her third month's absence from home the good woman grew very
restive, and sighed aloud for the day on which she would be able to
take her departure.</p>

<p>"I expec' my bein' away like this'll run clean into a
fifty-poun' note," she said one evening. "When it comes to managin'
an 'ouse, those two girls of mine 'aven't a h'ounce o' gumption
between them."</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> tactless of her, even Polly felt that; though she
could sympathise with the worry that prompted the words. As for
Mahony, had he had the money to do it, he would have flung the sum
named straight at her head.</p>

<p>"She must never come again," said Polly to herself, as she bent
over the hair-chain she was making as a gift for John. "It is a
pity, but it seems as if Richard can't get on with those sort of
people."</p>

<p>In his relief at having his house to himself, Mahony accepted
even Polly's absence with composure. To be perpetually in the
company of other people irked him beyond belief. A certain amount
of privacy was as vital to him as sleep.</p>

<p>Delighting in his new-found solitude, he put off from day to day
the disagreeable job of winding up his affairs and discovering how
much&mdash;or how little&mdash;ready money there would be to set
sail with. Another thing, some books he had sent home for, a year
or more ago, came to hand at this time, and gave him a fresh
pretext for delay. There were eight or nine volumes to unpack and
cut the pages of. He ran from one to another, sipping, devouring.
Finally he cast anchor in a collected edition of his old chief's
writings on obstetrics&mdash;slipped in, this, as a gift from the
sender, a college chum&mdash;and over it, his feet on the table,
his dead pipe in the corner of his mouth, Mahony sat for the better
part of the night.</p>

<p>The effect of this master-mind on his was that of a spark on
tinder. Under the flash, he cursed for the hundredth time the folly
he had been guilty of in throwing up medicine. It was a vocation
that had fitted him as coursing fits a hound, or house-wifery a
woman. The only excuse he could find for his apostasy was that he
had been caught in an epidemic of unrest, which had swept through
the country, upsetting the balance of men's reason. He had since
wondered if the Great Exhibition of '51 had not had something to do
with it, by unduly whetting people's imaginations; so that but a
single cry of "Gold!" was needed, to loose the spirit of vagrancy
that lurks in every Briton's blood. His case had perhaps been
peculiar in this: no one had come forward to warn or dissuade. His
next relatives&mdash;mother and sisters&mdash;were, he thought,
glad to know him well away. In their eyes he had lowered himself by
taking up medicine; to them it was still of a piece with barber's
pole and cupping-basin. Before his time no member of the family had
entered any profession but the army. Oh, that infernal Irish
pride!...and Irish poverty. It had choke-damped his youth, blighted
the prospects of his sisters. He could remember, as if it were
yesterday, the jibes and fleers called forth by the suit of a
wealthy Dublin brewer, who had been attracted&mdash;by sheer force
of contrast, no doubt&mdash;to the elder of the two swan-necked,
stiff-backed Miss Townshend-Mahonys, with their long, thin noses,
and the ingrained lines that ran from the curled nostrils to the
corners of their supercilious mouths, describing a sneer so deep
that at a distance it was possible to mistake it for a smile.
"Beer, my dear, indeed and there are worse things in the world than
beer!" he heard his mother declare in her biting way. "By all means
take him! You can wash yourself in it if water gets scarce, and
I'll place my kitchen orders with you." Lucinda, who had perhaps
sniffed timidly at release, burnt crimson: thank you! she would
rather eat rat-bane.&mdash;He supposed they pinched and scraped
along as of old&mdash;the question of money was never broached
between him and them. Prior to his marriage he had sent them what
he could; but that little was in itself an admission of failure.
They made no inquiries about his mode of life, preferring it to
remain in shadow; enough for them that he had not amassed a
fortune. Had that come to pass, they might have pardoned the rude
method of its making&mdash;in fancy he listened to the witty,
cutting, self-derisive words, in which they would have alluded to
his success.</p>

<p>Lying back in his chair he thought of them thus, without
unkindliness, even with a dash of humour. That was possible, now
that knocking about the world had rubbed off some of his own
corners. In his young days, he, too, had been hot and bitter. What,
however, to another might have formed the chief crux in their
conduct&mdash;it was by squandering such money as there was, his
own portion among it, on his scamp of an elder brother, that they
had forced him into the calling they despised&mdash;this had not
troubled him greatly. For medicine was the profession on which his
choice would anyhow have fallen. And to-night the book that lay
before him had infected him with the old enthusiasm. He re-lived
those days when a skilfully handled case of <i>placenta previa</i>,
or a successful delivery in the fourth position, had meant more to
him than the Charge of the Light Brigade.</p>

<p>Fresh from this dip into the past, this foretaste of the future,
he turned in good heart to business. An inventory had to be taken;
damaged goods cleared out; a list of bad and less bad debts drawn
up: he and Hempel were hard at work all next day. The result was
worse even than he had expected. His outlay that summer&mdash;ever
since the day on which he had set off to the aid of his bereaved
relative&mdash;had been enormous. Trade had run dry, and throughout
Polly's long illness he had dipped blindly into his savings. He
could never have said no to Mrs. Beamish when she came to him for
money&mdash;rather would he have pawned the coat off his back. And
she, good woman, was unused to cheeseparing. His men's wages paid,
berths booked, the numerous expenses bound up with a departure
defrayed, he would have but a scanty sum in hand with which to
start on the other side.</p>

<p>For himself he was not afraid; but he shrank from the thought of
Polly undergoing privations. So far, they had enjoyed a kind of
frugal comfort. But should he meet with obstacles at the outset: if
patients were laggardly and the practice slow to move, or if he
himself fell ill, they might have a spell of real poverty to face.
And it was under the goad of this fear that he hit on a new scheme.
Why not leave Polly behind for a time, until he had succeeded in
making a home for her?&mdash;why not leave her under the wing of
brother John? John stood urgently in need of a head for his
establishment, and who so well suited for the post as Polly?
Surely, if it were put before him, John must jump at the offer!
Parting from Polly, and were it only for a little while, would be
painful; but, did he go alone, he would be free to do his
utmost&mdash;and with an easy mind, knowing that she lacked none of
the creature-comforts. Yes, the more he considered the plan, the
better he liked it. The one flaw in his satisfaction was the
thought that if their child had lived, no such smooth and simple
arrangement would have been possible. He could not have foisted a
family on Turnham.</p>

<p>Now he waited with impatience for Polly to return&mdash;his
reasonable little Polly! But he did not hurry her. Polly was
enjoying her holiday. Having passed to Melbourne from Geelong she
wrote:</p>

<p>JOHN IS SO VERY KIND. HE DOESN'T OF COURSE GO OUT YET HIMSELF,
BUT I WAS PRESENT WITH SOME FRIENDS OF HIS AT A VERY ELEGANT
SOIREE. JOHN GAVE ME A HEADDRESS COMPOSED OF BLACK PEARLS AND
FROSTED LEAVES. HE MEANS TO GO IN FOR POLITIES AS SOON AS HIS YEAR
OF MOURNING IS UP.</p>

<p>Mahony replied:</p>

<p>ENJOY YOURSELF, MY HEART, AND SET ALL THE SIGHTS YOU CAN.</p>

<p>While into more than one of his letters he slipped a
banknote.</p>

<p>FOR YOU KNOW I LIKE YOU TO PAY YOUR OWN WAY AS FAR AS
POSSIBLE.</p>

<p>And at length the day came when he could lift his wife out of
the coach. She emerged powdered brown with dust and very tired, but
radiantly happy: it was a great event in little Polly's life, this
homecoming, and coming, too, strong and well. The house was a
lively place that afternoon: Polly had so much to tell that she sat
holding her bonnet for over an hour, quite unable to get as far as
the bedroom; and even Long Jim's mouth went up at the corners
instead of down; for Polly had contrived to bring back a little
gift for every one. And in presenting these, she found out more of
what people were thinking and feeling than her husband had done in
all the eight weeks of her absence.</p>

<p>Mahony was loath to damp her pleasure straightway; he bided his
time. He could not know that Polly also had been laying plans, and
that she watched anxiously for the right moment to unfold them.</p>

<p>The morning after her return, she got a lift in the baker's cart
and drove out to inspect John's children. What she saw and heard on
this visit was disquieting. The children had run wild, were grown
dirty, sly, untruthful. Especially the boy.&mdash;"A young Satan,
and that's a fact, Mrs. Mahony! What he needs is a man's hand over
him, and a good hidin' six days outer seven."</p>

<p>It was not alone little Johnny's misconduct, however, that made
Polly break silence. An incident occurred that touched her still
more nearly.</p>

<p>Husband and wife sat snug and quiet as in the early days of
their marriage. Autumn had come round and a fire burnt in the
stove, before which Pompey snorted in his dreams. But, for all the
cosy tranquillity, Polly was not happy; and time and again she
moistened and bit at the tip of her thread, before pointing it
through her needle. For the book open before Richard, in which he
was making notes as he read, was&mdash;the Bible. Bending over him
to drop a kiss on the top of his head, Polly had been staggered by
what she saw. Opposite the third verse of the first chapter of
Genesis: "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light,"
he had written: "Three days before the sun!" Her heart seemed to
shrivel, to grow small in her breast, at the thought of her husband
being guilty of such impiety. Ceasing her pretence at sewing, she
walked out of the house into the yard. Standing there under the
stars she said aloud, as if some one, <i>the</i> One, could hear
her: "He doesn't mean to do wrong...I <i>know</i> he doesn't!" But
when she re-entered the room he was still at it. His beautiful
writing, reduced to its tiniest, wound round the narrow
margins.</p>

<p>Deeply red, Polly took her courage in both hands, and struck a
blow for the soul whose salvation was more to her than her own.
"Richard, do you think that...is...is right?" she asked in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Mahony raised his head. "Eh?&mdash;what, Pollykin?"</p>

<p>"I mean, do you think you ought...that it is right to do what
you are doing?"</p>

<p>The smile, half-tender, half-quizzical that she loved, broke
over her husband's face. He held out his hand. "Is my little wife
troubled?"</p>

<p>"Richard, I only mean..."</p>

<p>"Polly, my dear, don't worry your little head over what you
don't understand. And have confidence in me. You know I wouldn't do
anything I believed to be wrong?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. And you are really far more religious than I
am."</p>

<p>"One can be religious and yet not shut one's eyes to the truth.
It's Saint Paul, you know, who says: we can do nothing against the
Truth but for the Truth. And you may depend on it, Polly, the
All-Wise would never have given us the brains He has, if He had not
intended us to use them. Now I have long felt sure that the Bible
is not wholly what it claims to be&mdash;direct inspiration."</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard!" said Polly, and threw an anxious glance over her
shoulder. "If anyone should hear you!"</p>

<p>"We can't afford to let our lives be governed by what other
people think, Polly. Nor will I give any man the right to decide
for me what my share of the Truth shall be."</p>

<p>On seeing the Bible closed Polly breathed again, at the same
time promising herself to take the traitorous volume into
safe-keeping, that no third person's eye should rest on it.
Perhaps, too, if it were put away Richard would forget to go on
writing in it. He had probably begun in the first place only
because he had nothing else to do. In the store he sat and smoked
and twirled his thumbs&mdash;not half a dozen customers came in, in
the course of the day. If he were once properly occupied again,
with work that he liked, he would not be tempted to put his gifts
to such a profane use. Thus she primed herself for speaking. For
now was the time. Richard was declaring that trade had gone to the
dogs, his takings dropped to a quarter of what they had formerly
been. This headed just where she wished. But Polly would not have
been Polly, had she not glanced aside for a moment, to cheer and
console.</p>

<p>"It's the same everywhere, Richard. Everybody's complaining. And
that reminds me, I forgot to tell you about the Beamishes. They're
in great trouble. You see, a bog has formed in front of the Hotel,
and the traffic goes round another way, so they've lost most of
their custom. Mr. Beamish never opens his mouth at all now, and
mother is fearfully worried. That's what was the matter when she
was here&mdash;only she was too kind to say so."</p>

<p>"Hard lines!"</p>

<p>"Indeed it is. But about us; I'm not surprised to hear trade is
dull. Since I was over in the western township last, no less than
six new General Stores have gone up&mdash;I scarcely knew the
place. They've all got big plate-glass windows; and were crowded
with people."</p>

<p>"Yes, there's a regular exodus up west. But that doesn't alter
the fact, wife, that I've made a very poor job of storekeeping. I
shall leave here with hardly a penny to my name."</p>

<p>"Yes, but then, Richard," said Polly, and bent over her strip of
needlework, "you were never cut out to be a storekeeper, were
you?"</p>

<p>"I was not. And I verily believe, if it hadn't been for that old
sober-sides of a Hempel, I should have come a cropper long
ago."</p>

<p>"Yes, and Hempel," said Polly softly; "Hempel's been wanting to
leave for ever so long."</p>

<p>"The dickens he has!" cried Mahony in astonishment. "And me
humming and hawing about giving him notice! What's the matter with
him? What's he had to complain of?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing like that. He wants to enter the ministry. A
helper's needed at the Baptist Chapel, and he means to apply for
the post. You see, he's saved a good deal, and thinks he can study
to be a minister at the same time."</p>

<p>"Study for his grave, the fool! So that's it, is it? Well, well!
it saves trouble in the end. I don't need to bother my head now
over what's to become of him...him or anyone else. My chief desire
is to say good-bye to this hole for ever. There's no sense, Polly,
in my dawdling on. Indeed, I haven't the money to do it. So I've
arranged, my dear, with our friend Ocock to come in and sell us
off, as soon as you can get our personal belongings put
together."</p>

<p>Here Polly raised her head as if to interrupt; but Mahony, full
of what he had to say, ignored the movement, and went on speaking.
He did not wish to cause his wife uneasiness, by dwelling on his
difficulties; but some explanation was necessary to pave the way
for his proposal that she should remain behind, when he left the
colony. He spent all his eloquence in making this sound natural and
attractive. But it was hard, when Polly's big, astonished eyes hung
on his face. "Do you think, for my sake, you could be brave
enough?" he wound up, rather unsurely. "It wouldn't be for long,
love, I'm certain of that. Just let me set foot in England once
more!"</p>

<p>"Why...why, yes, dear Richard, I...I think I could, if you
really wished it," said Polly in a small voice. She tried to seem
reasonable; though black night descended on her at the thought of
parting, and though her woman's eyes saw a hundred objections to
the plan, which his had overlooked. (For one thing, John had just
installed Sara as housekeeper, and Sara would take it very unkindly
to be shown the door.) "I <i>think</i> I could," she repeated. "But
before you go on, dear, I should like to ask <i>you</i>
something."</p>

<p>She laid down her needlework; her heart was going pit-a-pat.
"Richard, did you ever...I mean have you never thought of...of
taking up your profession again&mdash;I mean here&mdash;starting
practice here?&mdash;No, wait a minute! Let me finish. I...I...oh,
Richard!" Unable to find words, Polly locked her fingers under the
tablecloth and hoped she was not going to be so silly as to cry.
Getting up, she knelt down before her husband, laying her hands on
his knees. "Oh, Richard, I wish you would&mdash;<i>how</i> I wish
you would!"</p>

<p>"Why, Polly!" said Mahony, surprised at her agitation. "Why, my
dear, what's all this?&mdash;You want to know if I never thought of
setting up in practice out here? Of course I did...in the
beginning. You don't think I'd have chosen to keep a store, if
there'd been any other opening for me? But there wasn't, child. The
place was overrun. Never a medico came out and found digging too
much for him, but he fell back in despair on his profession. I
didn't see my way to join their starvation band."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>then</i>, Richard!&mdash;but now?" broke in Polly.
"Now, it's quite, quite different. Look at the size Ballarat has
grown&mdash;there are more than forty thousand people settled on
it; Mr. Ocock told me so. And you know, dear, doctors have cleared
out lately, not come fresh. There was that one, I forget his name,
who drank himself to death; and the two, you remember, who were
sold up just before Christmas." But this was an unfortunate line of
argument to have hit on, and Polly blushed and stumbled.</p>

<p>Mahony laughed at her slip, and smoothed her hair. "Typical
fates, love! They mustn't be mine. Besides, Polly, you're
forgetting the main thing&mdash;how I hate the place, and how I've
always longed to get away."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not. But please let me go on.&mdash;You know, Richard,
every one believes some day Ballarat will be the chief
city&mdash;bigger even than Geelong or Melbourne. And then to have
a good practice here would mean ever such a lot of money. I'm not
the only person who thinks so. There's Sara, and Mrs.
Beamish&mdash;I know, of course, you don't care much what they say;
but still&mdash;" Polly meant: still, you see, I have public
opinion on my side. As, however, once more words failed her, she
hastened to add: "John, too, is amazed to hear you think of going
home to bury yourself in some little English village. He's sure
there'd be a splendid opening for you here. John thinks very, very
highly of you. He told me he believes you would have saved Emma's
life, if you had been there."</p>

<p>"I'm much obliged to your brother for his confidence," said
Mahony dryly; "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Richard! You see, dear, I can't help feeling
myself that you ought not to be too hasty in deciding. Of course, I
know I'm young, and haven't had much experience, but...You see,
you're <i>known</i> here, Richard, and that's always something; in
England you'd be a perfect stranger. And though you may say there
are too many doctors on the Flat, still, if the place goes on
growing as it is doing, there'll soon be room for more; and then,
if it isn't you, it'll just be some one else. And that <i>does</i>
seem a pity, when you are so clever&mdash;so much, much cleverer
than other people! Yes, I know all about it; Mrs. Beamish told me
it was you I owed my life to, not Dr. Rogers"&mdash;at which Mahony
winced, indignant that anyone should have betrayed to Polly how
near death she had been. "Oh, I <i>do</i> want people to know you
for what you really are!" said little Polly.</p>

<p>"Pussy, I believe she has ambitions for her husband," said
Mahony to Palmerston.</p>

<p>"Of course I have. You say you hate Ballarat, and all that, but
have you ever thought, Richard, what a difference it would make if
you were in a better position? You think people look down on you,
because you're in trade. But if you were a doctor, there'd be none
of that. You'd call yourself by your full name again, and write it
down on the visiting list at Government House, and be as good as
anybody, and be asked into society, and keep a horse. You'd live in
a bigger house, and have a room to yourself and time to read and
write. I'm quite sure you'd make lots of money and soon be at the
top of the tree. And after all, dear Richard, I don't want to go
home. I would much rather stay here and look after Jerry, and dear
Ned, and poor John's children," said Polly, falling back as a
forlorn hope on her own preference.</p>

<p>"Why, what a piece of special pleading!" cried Mahony, and
leaning forward, he kissed the young flushed face.</p>

<p>"Don't laugh at me. I'm in earnest."</p>

<p>"Why, no, child. But Polly, my dear, even if I were tempted for
a moment to think seriously of what you say, where would the money
come from? Fees are high, it's true, if the ball's once set
a-rolling. But till then? With a jewel of a wife like mine, I'd be
a scoundrel to take risks."</p>

<p>Polly had been waiting for this question. On hearing it, she sat
back on her heels and drew a deep breath. The communication she had
now to make him was the hub round which all turned. Should he
refuse to consider it...Plucking at the fringe of the tablecloth,
she brought out, piecemeal, the news that John was willing to go
surety for the money they would need to borrow for the start. Not
only that: he offered them a handsome sum weekly to take entire
charge of his children.&mdash;"Not here, in this little
house&mdash;I know that wouldn't do," Polly hastened to throw in,
forestalling the objection she read in Richard's eyes. Now did he
not think he should weigh an offer of this kind very carefully? A
name like John's was not to be despised; most people in their
position would jump at it. "I understand something about it," said
the little woman, and sagely nodded her head. "For when I was in
Geelong, Mr. Beamish tried his hardest to raise some money and
couldn't, his sureties weren't good enough." Mahony had not the
heart to chide her for discussing his private affairs with her
brother. Indeed, he rather admired the businesslike way she had
gone about it. And he admitted this, by ceasing to banter and by
calling her attention to the various hazards and inconveniences the
step would entail.</p>

<p>Polly heard him out in silence. Enough for her, in the
beginning, that he did not decline off-hand. They had a long talk,
the end of which was that he promised to sleep over John's
proposal, and delay fixing the date of the auction till the
morning.</p>

<p>Having yielded this point Mahony kissed his wife and sent her to
bed, himself going out with the dog for his usual stroll.</p>

<p>It was a fine night&mdash;moonless, but thick with stars. So
much, at least, could be said in favour of the place: there was
abundant sky-room; you got a clear half of the great vault at once.
How he pitied, on such a night, the dwellers in old, congested
cities, whose view of the starry field was limited to a narrow
strip, cut through house-tops.</p>

<p>Yet he walked with a springless tread. The fact was, certain of
his wife's words had struck home; and in the course of the past
year he had learnt to put considerable faith in Polly's practical
judgment. As he wound his way up the little hill to which he had
often carried his perplexities, he let his pipe go out, and forgot
to whistle Pompey off butcher's garbage.</p>

<p>Sitting down on a log he rested his chin in his hands. Below him
twinkled the sparse lights of the Flat; shouts and singing rose
from the circus.&mdash;And so John would have been willing to go
surety for him! Let no one say the unexpected did not happen. All
said and done, they were little more than strangers to each other,
and John had no notion what his money-making capacities as a doctor
might be. It was true, Polly had been too delicate to mention
whether the affair had come about through her persuasions or on
John's own initiative. John might have some ulterior motive up his
sleeve. Perhaps he did not want to lose his sister...or was
scheming to bind a pair of desirables fast to this colony, the
welfare of which he had so much at heart. Again, it might be that
he wished to buy off the memory of that day on which he had
stripped his soul naked. Simplest of all, why should he not be
merely trying to pay back a debt? He, Mahony, might shrink from
lying under an obligation to John, but, so far, the latter had not
scrupled to accept favours from him. But that was always the way
with your rich men; they were not troubled by paltry pride; for
they knew it was possible to acquit themselves of their debts at a
moment's notice, and with interest. This led him to reflect on the
great help to him the loan of his wealthy relative's name would be:
difficulties would melt before it. And surely no undue risk was
involved in the use of it? Without boasting, he thought he was
better equipped, both by aptitude and training, than the ruck of
colonial practitioners. Did he enter the lists, he could hardly
fail to succeed. And out here even a moderate success spelled a
fortune. Gained double-quick, too. After which the lucky individual
sold out and went home, to live in comfort. Yes, that was a point,
and not to be overlooked. No definite surrender of one's hopes was
called for; only a postponement. Ten years might do it&mdash;meaty
years, of course, the best years of one's life&mdash;still...It
would mean very hard work; but had he not just been contemplating,
with perfect equanimity, an even more arduous venture on the other
side? What a capricious piece of mechanism was the human brain!</p>

<p>Another thought that occurred to him was that his services might
prove more useful to this new country than to the old, where able
men abounded. He recalled many good lives and promising cases he
had here seen lost and bungled. To take the instance nearest
home&mdash;Polly's confinement. Yes, to show his mettle to such as
Rogers; to earn respect where he had lived as a mere null&mdash;the
idea had an insidious fascination. And as Polly sagely remarked: if
it were not he, it would be some one else; another would harvest
the <i>kudos</i> that might have been his. For the rough-and-ready
treatment&mdash;the blue pills and black draughts&mdash;that had
satisfied the early diggers had fallen into disrepute; medical
skill was beginning to be appreciated. If this went on, Ballarat
would soon stand on a level with any city of its size at home. But
even as it was, he had never been quite fair to it; he had seen it
with a jaundiced eye. And again he believed Polly hit the nail on
the head, when she asserted that the poor position he had occupied
was responsible for much of his dislike.</p>

<p>But there was something else at work in him besides. Below the
surface an admission awaited him, which he shrank from making. All
these pros and cons, these quibbles and hair-splittings were but a
misfit attempt to cloak the truth. He might gull himself with them
for a time: in his heart he knew that he would yield&mdash;if yield
he did&mdash;because he was by nature only too prone to follow the
line of least resistance. What he had gone through to-night was no
new experience. Often enough after fretting and fuming about a
thing till it seemed as if nothing under the sun had ever mattered
so much to him, it could happen that he suddenly threw up the
sponge and bowed to circumstance. His vitality exhausted itself
beforehand&mdash;in a passionate aversion, a torrent of
words&mdash;and failed him at the critical moment. It was a
weakness in his blood&mdash;in the blood of his race.&mdash;But in
the present instance, he had an excuse for himself. He had not
known&mdash;till Polly came out with her brother's offer&mdash;how
he dreaded having to begin all over again in England, an utter
stranger, without influence or recommendations, and with no money
to speak of at his back.</p>

<p>But now he owned up, and there was no more need of shift or
subterfuge: now it was one rush and hurry to the end. He had
capitulated; a thin-skinned aversion to confronting difficulties,
when he saw the chance of avoiding them, had won the day. He
intended&mdash;had perhaps the whole time intended&mdash;to take
the hand held out to him. After all, why not? Anyone else, as Polly
said, would have jumped at John's offer. He alone must argue
himself blue in the face over it.</p>

<p>But as he sat and pondered the lengthy chain of
circumstance&mdash;Polly's share in it, John's, his own, even the
part played by incorporeal things &mdash;he brought up short
against the word "decision". He might flatter himself by imagining
he had been free to decide; in reality nothing was further from the
truth. He had been subtly and slily guided to his goal &mdash;led
blindfold along a road that not of his choosing. Everything and
every one had combined to constrain him: his favours to John, the
failure of his business, Polly's inclinations and persuasions, his
own fastidious shrinkings. So that, in the end, all he had had to
do was to brush aside a flimsy gossamer veil, which hung between
him and his fate. Was it straining a point to see in the whole
affair the workings of a Power outside himself&mdash;against
himself, in so far as it took no count of his poor earth-blind
vision?</p>

<p>Well, if this were so, better still: his ways were in God's
hand. And after all, what did it matter where one strove to serve
one's Maker&mdash;east or west or south or north&mdash;and whether
the stars overhead were grouped in this constellation or in that?
Their light was a pledge that one would never be overlooked or
forgotten, traced by the hand of Him who had promised to note even
a sparrow's fall. And here he spoke aloud into the darkness the
ancient and homely formula that is man's stand-by in face of the
untried, the unknown.</p>

<p>"If God wills...God knows best."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-1-3-0" id="ch-1-3-0"></a>Part III</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-3-1" id="ch-1-3-1"></a>Chapter I</h3>

<p>The house stood not far from the Great Swamp. It was of
weather-board, with a galvanised iron roof, and might have been
built from a child's drawing of a house: a door in the centre, a
little window on either side, a chimney at each end. Since the
ground sloped downwards, the front part rested on piles some three
feet high, and from the rutty clay-track that would one day be a
street wooden steps led up to the door. Much as Mahony would have
liked to face it with a verandah, he did not feel justified in
spending more than he could help. And Polly not only agreed with
him, but contrived to find an advantage in the plainer style of
architecture. "Your plate will be better seen, Richard, right on
the street, than hidden under a verandah." But then Polly was
overflowing with content. Had not two of the rooms fireplaces? And
was there not a wash-house, with a real copper in it, behind the
detached kitchen? Not to speak of a spare room!&mdash;To the rear
of the house a high paling-fence enclosed a good-sized yard. Mahony
dreamed of a garden, Polly of keeping hens.</p>

<p>There were no two happier people on Ballarat that autumn than
the Mahonys. To and fro they trudged down the hill, across the
Flat, over the bridge and up the other side; first, through a
Sahara of dust, then, when the rains began, ankle-deep in gluey red
mud. And the building of the finest mansion never gave half so much
satisfaction as did that of this flimsy little wooden house, with
its thin lath-and-plaster walls. In fancy they had furnished it and
lived in it, long before it was even roofed in. Mahony sat at work
in his surgery&mdash;it measured ten by twelve &mdash;Polly at her
Berlin-woolwork in the parlour opposite: "And a cage with a little
parrot in it, hanging at the window."</p>

<p>The preliminaries to the change had gone smoothly
enough&mdash;Mahony could not complain. Pleasant they had not been;
but could the arranging and clinching of a complicated money-matter
ever be pleasant? He had had to submit to hearing his private
affairs gone into by a stranger; to make clear to strangers his
capacity for earning a decent income.</p>

<p>With John's promissory letter in his pocket, he had betaken
himself to Henry Ocock's office.</p>

<p>This, notwithstanding its excellent position on the brow of the
western hill, could not deny its humble origin as a livery-barn.
The entry was by a yard; and some of the former horse-boxes had
been rudely knocked together to provide accommodation. Mahony
sniffed stale dung.</p>

<p>In what had once been the harness-room, two young men sat at
work.</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, my lad, you here?"</p>

<p>Tom Ocock raised his freckled face, from the chin of which
sprouted some long fair hairs, and turned red.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me. Do you want to see 'En&mdash;" at an open kick
from his brother&mdash;"Mr. Ocock?"</p>

<p>"If you please."</p>

<p>Informed by Grindle that the "Captain" was at liberty, Mahony
passed to an inner room where he was waved to a chair. In answer to
his statement that he had called to see about raising some money,
Ocock returned an: "Indeed? Money is tight, sir, very tight!" his
face instantly taking on the blank-wall solemnity proper to
dealings with this world's main asset.</p>

<p>Mahony did not at once hand over John's way-soothing letter. He
thought he would first test the lawyer's attitude towards him in
person&mdash;a species of self-torment men of his make are rarely
able to withstand. He spoke of the decline of his business; of his
idea of setting up as a doctor and building himself a house; and,
as he talked, he read his answer pat and clear in the ferrety eyes
before him. There was a bored tolerance of his wordiness, an utter
lack of interest in the concerns of the petty tradesman.</p>

<p>"H'm." Ocock, lying back in his chair, was fitting five
outstretched fingers to their fellows. "All very well, my good sir,
but may I ask if you have anyone in view as a security?"</p>

<p>"I have. May I trouble you to glance through this?" and
triumphantly Mahony brandished John's letter.</p>

<p>Ocock raised his brows. "What? Mr. John Turnham? Ah, very
good...very good indeed!" The brazen-faced change in his manner
would have made a cat laugh; he sat upright, was interested,
courteous, alert. "Quite in order! And now, pray, how much do we
need?"</p>

<p>Unadvised, he had not been able, said Mahony, to determine the
sum. So Ocock took pencil and paper, and, prior to running off a
reckoning, put him through a sharp interrogation. Under it Mahony
felt as though his clothing was being stripped piece by piece off
his back. At one moment he stood revealed as mean and stingy, at
another as an unpractical spendthrift. More serious things came out
besides. He began to see, under the limelight of the lawyer's
inquiry, in what a muddle-headed fashion he had managed his
business, and how unlikely it was he could ever have made a good
thing of it. Still worse was his thoughtless folly in wedding and
bringing home a young wife without, in this settlement where
accident was rife, where fires were of nightly occurrence, insuring
against either fire or death. Not that Ocock breathed a hint of
censure: all was done with a twist of the eye, a purse of the lip;
but it was enough for Mahony. He sat there, feeling like an eel in
the skinning, and did not attempt to keep pace with the lawyer, who
hunted figures into the centre of a woolly maze.</p>

<p>The upshot of these calculations was: he would need help to the
tune of something over one thousand pounds. As matters stood at
present on Ballarat, said Ocock, the plainest house he could build
would cost him eight hundred; and another couple of hundred would
go in furnishing; while a saddle-horse might be put down at fifty
pounds. On Turnham's letter he, Ocock, would be prepared to borrow
seven hundred for him&mdash;and this could probably be obtained at
ten per cent on a mortgage of the house; and a further four
hundred, for which he would have to pay twelve or fifteen. Current
expenses must be covered by the residue of this savings, and by
what he was able to make. They would include the keep of the horse,
and the interest on the borrowed money, which might be reckoned
roughly at a hundred and twenty per annum. In addition, he would be
well advised to insure his life for five to seven hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>The question also came up whether the land he had selected for
building on should be purchased or not. He was for doing so, for
settling the whole business there and then. Ocock, however, took
the opposite view. Considering, said he, that the site chosen was
far from the centre of the town, Mahony might safely postpone
buying in the meanwhile. There had been no government land-sales of
late, and all main-road frontages had still to come under the
hammer. As occupier, when the time arrived, he would have first
chance at the upset price; though then, it was true, he would also
be liable for improvements. The one thing he must beware of was of
enclosing too small a block.</p>

<p>Mahony agreed&mdash;agreed to everything: the affair seemed to
have passed out of his hands. A sense of dismay invaded him while
he listened to the lawyer tick off the obligations and
responsibilities he was letting himself in for. A thousand pounds!
He to run into debt for such a sum, who had never owed a farthing
to anyone! He fell to doubting whether, after all, he had made
choice of the easier way, and lapsed into a gloomy silence.</p>

<p>Ocock on the other hand warmed to geniality.</p>

<p>"May I say, doctor, how wise I think your decision to come over
to us?" &mdash;He spoke as if Ballarat East were in the heart of
the Russian steppes. "And that reminds me. There's a friend of
mine...I may be able at once to put a patient in your way."</p>

<p>Mahony walked home in a mood of depression which it took all
Polly's arts to dispel.</p>

<p>Under its influence he wrote an outspoken letter to
Purdy&mdash;but with no very satisfactory result. It was like
projecting a feeler for sympathy into the void, so long was it
since they had met, and so widely had his friend's life branched
from his.</p>

<p>Purdy's answer&mdash;it was headed "The Ovens"&mdash;did not
arrive till several weeks later, and was mainly about himself.</p>

<p>IN A WAY I'M WITH YOU, OLD PILL-BOX, he wrote. YOU'LL CUT A
JOLLY SIGHT BETTER FIGURE AS AN M.D. THEN EVER YOU'VE DONE BEHIND A
COUNTER. BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D CARE TO STAKE MY LAST DOLLAR ON
YOU ALL THE SAME. WHAT DOES MRS. POLLY SAY?&mdash;AS FOR ME, OLD
BOY, SINCE YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH TO ASK, WHY THE LESS SAID THE BETTER.
ONE OF THESE DAYS A POOR WORN OLD SHICER'LL COME CRAWLING ROUND TO
YOUR BACK DOOR TO SEE IF YOU'VE ANY CAST-OFF DUDS YOU CAN SPARE
HIM. SERIOUSLY, DICK, OLD MAN, I'M STONY-BROKE ONCE MORE AND THE
LORD ONLY KNOWS HOW I'M GOING TO WIN THROUGH.</p>

<p>In the course of that winter, custom died a natural death; and
one day, the few oddments that remained having been sold by
auction, Mahony and his assistant nailed boards horizontally across
the entrance to the store. The day of weighing out pepper and salt
was over; never again would the tinny jangle of the accursed bell
smite his ears. The next thing was that Hempel packed his chattels
and departed for his new walk in life. Mahony was not sorry to see
him go. Hempel's thoughts had soared far above the counter; he was
arrived at the stage of: "I'm just as good as you!" which everyone
here reached sooner or later.</p>

<p>"I shall always be pleased to hear how you are getting on."</p>

<p>Mahony spoke kindly, but in a tone which, as Polly who stood by,
very well knew, people were apt to misunderstand.</p>

<p>"I should think so!" she chimed in. "I shall feel very hurt
indeed, Hempel, if you don't come and see us."</p>

<p>With regard to Long Jim, she had a talk with her husband one
night as they went to bed.</p>

<p>"There really won't be anything for him to do in the new house.
No heavy crates or barrels to move about. And he doesn't know a
thing about horses. Why not let him go home?&mdash;he does so want
to. What would you say, dear, to giving him thirty pounds for his
passage-money and a trifle in his pocket? It would make him very
happy, and he'd be off your hands for good.&mdash;Of course,
though, just as you think best."</p>

<p>"We shall need every penny we can scrape together, for
ourselves, Polly. And yet, my dear, I believe you're right. In the
new house, as you say, he'll be a mere encumbrance. As for me, I'd
be only too thankful never to hear his cantankerous old pipe again.
I don't know now what evil genius prompted me to take him in."</p>

<p>"Evil genius, indeed!" retorted Polly. "You did it because
you're a dear, good, kind-hearted man."</p>

<p>"Think so, wifey? I'm inclined to put it down to sheer dislike
of botheration&mdash;Irish inertia...the curse of our race."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I knoo you'd be wantin' to get rid o' me, now you're
goin' up in the world," was Long Jim's answer when Polly broached
her scheme for his benefit. "Well, no, I won't say anythin' against
you, Mrs. Mahony; you've treated me square enough. But doc., 'e's
always thought 'imself a sight above one, an' when 'e does, 'e lets
you feel it."</p>

<p>This was more than Polly could brook. "And sighing and groaning
as you have done to get home, Jim! You're a silly, ungrateful old
man, even to hint at such a thing."</p>

<p>"Poor old fellow, he's grumbled so long now, that he's forgotten
how to do anything else," she afterwards made allowance for him.
And added, pierced by a sudden doubt: "I hope his wife will still
be used to it, or...or else..."</p>

<p>And now the last day in the old house was come. The furniture,
stacked in the yard, awaited the dray that was to transport it.
Hardly worth carrying with one, thought Mahony, when he saw the few
poor sticks exposed to the searching sunlight. Pipe in mouth he
mooned about, feeling chiefly amazed that he could have put up, for
so long, with the miserable little hut which his house, stripped of
its trimmings, proved to be.</p>

<p>His reflections were cut short by old Ocock, who leaned over the
fence to bid his neighbours good-bye.</p>

<p>"No disturbance! Come in, come in!" cried Mahony, with the
rather spurious heartiness one is prone to throw into a final
invitation. And Polly rose from her knees before a clothes-basket
which she was filling with crockery, and bustled away to fetch the
cake she had baked for such an occasion.</p>

<p>"I'll miss yer bright little face, that I will!" said Mr. Ocock,
as he munched with the relish of a Jerry or a Ned. He held his
slice of cake in the hollow of one great palm, conveying with
extreme care the pieces he broke off to his mouth.</p>

<p>"You must come and see us, as soon as ever we're settled."</p>

<p>"Bless you! You'll soon find grander friends than an old chap
like me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ocock! And you with three sons in the law!"</p>

<p>"Besides, mark my words, it'll be your turn next to build,"
Mahony removed his pipe to throw in. "We'll have you over with us
yet."</p>

<p>"And what a lovely surprise for Miss Amelia when she arrives, to
find a bran'-new house awaiting her."</p>

<p>"Well, that's the end of this little roof-tree," said
Mahony.&mdash;The loaded dray had driven off, the children and
Ellen perched on top of the furniture, and he was giving a last
look round. "We've spent some very happy days under it, eh, my
dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very," said Polly, shaking out her skirts. "But we shall be
just as happy in the new one."</p>

<p>"God grant we may! It's not too much to hope I've now seen all
the downs of my life. I've managed to pack a good many into thirty
short years.&mdash;And that reminds me, Mrs. Townshend-Mahony, do
you know you will have been married to me two whole years, come
next Friday?"</p>

<p>"Why, so we shall!" cried Polly, and was transfixed in the act
of tying her bonnet-strings. "How time does fly! It seems only the
other day I saw this room for the first time. I peeped in, you
know, while you were fetching the box. <i>do</i> you remember how I
cried, Richard? I was afraid of a spider or something." And the
Polly of eighteen looked back, with a motherly amusement, at her
sixteen-year-old eidolon. "But now, dear, if you're ready...or else
the furniture will get there before we do. We'd better take the
short cut across Soldiers' Hill. That's the cat in that basket, for
you to carry, and here's your microscope. I've got the decanter and
the best teapot. Shall we go?"</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-3-2" id="ch-1-3-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>And now for a month or more Mahony had been in possession of a
room that was all his own. Did he retire into it and shut the door,
he could make sure of not being disturbed. Polly herself tapped
before entering; and he let her do so. Polly was dear; but dearer
still was his long-coveted privacy.</p>

<p>He knew, too, that she was happily employed; the fitting-up and
furnishing of the house was a job after her own heart. She had
proved both skilful and economical at it: thanks to her, they had
used a bare three-quarters of the sum allotted by Ocock for the
purpose&mdash;and this was well; for any number of unforeseen
expenses had cropped up at the last moment. Polly had a real knack
for making things "do". Old empty boxes, for instance, underwent
marvellous transformations at her hands&mdash;emerged, clad in
chintz and muslin, as sofas and toilet-tables. She hung her
curtains on strings, and herself sewed the seams of the parlour
carpet, squatting Turk-fashion on the floor, and working away, with
a great needle shaped like a scimitar, till the perspiration ran
down her face. It was also she who, standing on the kitchen-table,
put up the only two pictures they possessed, Ned and Jerry giving
opinions on the straightness of her eye, from below: a fancy
picture of the Battle of Waterloo in the parlour; a print of
"Harvey Discovering the Circulation of the Blood" on the surgery
wall.</p>

<p>From where he sat Mahony could hear the voices of the
children&mdash;John's children&mdash;at play. They frolicked with
Pompey in the yard. He could endure them, now that he was not for
ever tumbling over them. Yes, one and all were comfortably
established under the new roof&mdash;with the exception of poor
Palmerston the cat. Palmerston had declined to recognise the
change, and with the immoderate homing-instinct of his kind had
returned night after night to his old haunts. For some time
Mahony's regular evening walk was back to the store&mdash;a road he
would otherwise not have taken; for it was odious to him to see
Polly's neat little appointments going to rack and ruin, under the
tenancy of a dirty Irish family. There he would find the animal
sitting, in melancholy retrospect. Again and again he picked him up
and carried him home; till that night when no puss came to his
call, and Palmerston, the black and glossy, was seen no more:
either he had fallen down a shaft, or been mangled by a dog, or
stolen, cats still fetching a high price on Ballarat.</p>

<p>The window of Mahony's room faced a wide view: not a fence,
hardly a bit of scrub or a tuft of grass-tree marked the bare
expanse of uneven ground, now baked brown as a piecrust by the
December sun. He looked across it to the cemetery. This was still
wild and unfenced&mdash;just a patch of rising ground where it was
permissible to bury the dead. Only the day before&mdash;the second
anniversary of the Eureka Stockade&mdash;he had watched some two to
three hundred men, with crepe on their hats and sleeves, a
black-draped pole at their head, march there to do homage to their
fallen comrades. The dust raised by the shuffling of these many
feet had accompanied the procession like a moving cloud; had
lingered in its rear like the smoke from a fire. Drays and lorries
crawled for ever laboriously along it, seeming glued to the earth
by the monstrous sticky heat of the veiled sun. Further back rose a
number of bald hills&mdash;rounded, swelling hills, shaped like a
woman's breasts. And behind all, pale china-blue against the tense
white sky, was the embankment of the distant ranges. Except for
these, an ugly, uninviting outlook, and one to which he seldom
lifted his eyes.</p>

<p>His room pleased him better. Polly had stretched a bright green
drugget on the floor; the table had a green cloth on it; the
picture showed up well against the whitewashed wall. Behind him was
a large deal cupboard, which held instruments and drugs. The
bookshelves with their precious burden were within reach of his
hand; on the top shelf he had stacked the boxes containing his
botanical and other specimens.</p>

<p>The first week or so there was naturally little doing: a
sprained wrist to bandage, a tooth to draw, a case of fly-blight.
To keep himself from growing fidgety, he overhauled his minerals
and butterflies, and renewed faded labels. This done, he went on to
jot down some ideas he had, with regard to the presence of
auriferous veins in quartz. It was now generally agreed that quartz
was the matrix; but on the question of how the gold had found its
way into the rock, opinions were sharply divided. The theory of
igneous injection was advanced by some; others inclined to that of
sublimation. Mahony leaned to a combination of the two processes,
and spent several days getting his thoughts in order; while Polly,
bursting with pride, went about on tiptoe audibly hushing the
children: their uncle was writing for the newspapers.</p>

<p>Still no patients worth the name made their appearance. To fend
off the black worry that might get the better of him did he sit
idle, he next drew his Bible to him, and set about doing
methodically what he had so far undertaken merely by fits and
starts&mdash;deciding for himself to what degree the Scriptures
were inspired. Polly was neither proud nor happy while this went
on, and let the children romp unchecked. At present it was not so
much the welfare of her husband's soul she feared for: God must
surely know by this time what a good man Richard was; he had not
his equal, she thought, for honesty and uprightness; he was kind to
the poor and the sick, and hadn't missed a single Sunday at church,
since their marriage. But all that would not help, if once he got
the reputation of being an infidel. Then, nobody would want him as
a doctor at all.</p>

<p>Casually begun, Mahony's studies soon absorbed him to the
exclusion of everything else.</p>

<p>Brought up in the cast-iron mould of Irish Protestantism, to
which, being of a sober and devout turn of mind, he had readily
submitted, he had been tossed, as a youthful student, into the
freebooting Edinburgh of the forties. Edinburgh was alive in those
days to her very paving-stones; town and university combined to
form a hotbed of intellectual unrest, a breeding-ground for
disturbing possibilities. The "development theory" was in the air;
and a book that appeared anonymously had boldly voiced, in popular
fashion, Maillet's dream and the Lamarckian hypothesis of a
Creation undertaken once and for all, in place of a continuous
creative intenention. This book, opposing natural law to miracle,
carried complete conviction to the young and eager. Audacious
spirits even hazarded the conjecture that primitive life itself
might have originated in a natural way: had not, but recently, an
investigator who brought a powerful voltaic battery to bear on a
saturated solution of silicate of potash, been startled to find, as
the result of his experiment, numberless small mites of the species
<i>acarus horridus</i>? Might not the marvel electricity or
galvanism, in action on albumen, turn out to be the vitalising
force? To the orthodox zoologist, phytologist and geologist, such a
suggestion savoured of madness; they either took refuge in a
contemptuous silence, or condescended only to reply: Had one
visited the Garden of Eden during Creation, one would have found
that, in the morning, man was not, while in the evening he
was!&mdash;morning and evening bearing their newly established
significance of geological epochs. The famous tracing of the
Creator's footsteps, undertaken by a gifted compromiser, was felt
by even the most bigoted to be a lame rejoinder. His
<i>asterolepsis</i>, the giant fossil-fish from the Old Red
Sandstone, the antiquity of which should show that the origin of
life was not to be found solely in "infusorial points," but that
highly developed forms were among the earliest created&mdash;this
single prop was admittedly not strong enough to carry the whole
burden of proof. No, the immutability of species had been seriously
impugned, and bold minds asked themselves why a single act of
creation, at the outset, should not constitute as divine an origin
of life as a continued series of "creative fiats."</p>

<p>Mahony was one of them. The "development theory" did not repel
him. He could see no impiety in believing that life, once
established on the earth, had been left to perfect itself. Or hold
that this would represent the Divine Author of all things as, after
one master-stroke, dreaming away eternal ages in apathy and
indifference. Why should the perfect functioning of natural law not
be as convincing an expression of God's presence as a series of
cataclysmic acts of creation?</p>

<p>None the less it was a time of crisis, for him, as for so many.
For, if this were so, if science spoke true that, the miracle of
life set a-going, there had been no further intervention on the
part of the Creator, then the very head-and-corner stone of the
Christian faith, the Bible itself, was shaken. More, much more
would have to go than the Mosaic cosmogony of the first chapter of
Genesis. Just as the Elohistic account of creation had been
stretched to fit the changed views of geologists, so the greater
part of the scriptural narratives stood in need of a wider
interpretation. The fable of the Eternal's personal mediation in
the affairs of man must be accepted for what it was&mdash;a
beautiful allegory, the fondly dreamed fulfilment of a world-old
desire. And bringing thus a sharpened critical sense to bear on the
Scriptures, Mahony embarked on his voyage of discovery. Before him,
but more as a warning than a beacon, shone the example of a famous
German savant, who, taking our Saviour's life as his theme,
demolished the sacred idea of a Divine miracle, and retold the
Gospel story from a rationalistic standpoint. A savagely
unimaginative piece of work this, thought Mahony, and one that laid
all too little weight on the deeps of poetry, the mysteries of
symbols, and the power the human mind drew from these, to pierce to
an ideal truth. His own modest efforts would be of quite another
kind.</p>

<p>For he sought, not to deny God, but to discover Him anew, by
freeing Him from the drift of error, superstition and
dead-letterism which the centuries had accumulated about Him. Far
was it from His servant's mind to wish to decry the authority of
the Book of Books. This he believed to consist, in great part, of
inspired utterances, and, for the rest, to be the wisest and ripest
collection of moral precept and example that had come down to us
from the ages. Without it, one would be rudderless indeed&mdash;a
castaway in a cockleshell boat on a furious sea&mdash;and from
one's lips would go up a cry like to that wrung from a famous
infidel: "I am affrighted and confounded with the forlorn solitude
in which I am placed by my philosophy...begin to fancy myself in
the most deplorable condition imaginable, environed by the deepest
darkness."</p>

<p>No, Mahony was not one of those who held that the Christian
faith, that fine flower of man's spiritual need, would suffer
detriment by the discarding of a few fabulous tales; nor did he
fear lest his own faith should become undermined by his studies.
For he had that in him which told him that God was; and this
instinctive certainty would persist, he believed, though he had
ultimately to admit the whole fabric of Christianity to be based on
the Arimathean's dream. It had already survived the rejection of
externals: the surrender of forms, the assurance that ceremonials
were not essential to salvation belonged to his early student-days.
Now, he determined to send by the board the last hampering relics
of bigotry and ritual. He could no longer concede the tenets of
election and damnation. God was a God of mercy, not the blind,
jealous Jahveh of the Jews, or the inhuman Sabbatarian of a narrow
Protestantism. And He might be worshipped anywhere or anyhow: in
any temple built to His name&mdash;in the wilderness under the open
sky&mdash;in silent prayer, or according to any creed.</p>

<p>In all this critical readjustment, the thought he had to spare
for his fellow-men was of small account: his fate was not bound to
theirs by the altruism of a later generation. It was a time of
intense individualism; and his efforts towards spiritual
emancipation were made on his own behalf alone. The one link he had
with his fellows&mdash;if link it could be termed&mdash;was his
earnest wish to avoid giving offence: never would it have occurred
to him to noise his heterodoxy abroad. Nor did he want to disturb
other people's convictions. He respected those who could still draw
support from the old faith, and, moreover, had not a particle of
the proselytiser in him. He held that religion was either a matter
of temperament, or of geographical distribution; felt tolerantly
inclined towards the Jews, and the Chinese; and did not even smile
at processions to the Joss-house, and the provisioning of those
silent ones who needed food no more.</p>

<p>But just as little as he intermeddled with the convictions of
others would he brook interference with his own. It was the concern
of no third person what paths he followed in his journeyings after
the truth&mdash;in his quest for a panacea for the ills and
delusions of life. For, call it what he would&mdash;Biblical
criticism, scientific inquiry&mdash;this was his aim first and
last. He was trying to pierce the secret of existence&mdash;to rede
the riddle that has never been solved.&mdash;What am I? Whence have
I come? Whither am I going? What meaning has the pain I suffer, the
evil that men do? Can evil be included in God's scheme?&mdash;And
it was well, he told himself, as he pressed forward, that the flame
in him burnt unwaveringly, which assured him of his kinship with
the Eternal, of the kinship of all created things; so unsettling
and perplexing were the conclusions at which he arrived.</p>

<p>Summoned to dinner, he sat at table with stupid hands and
evasive eyes. Little Johnny, who was, as Polly put it, "as sharp as
mustard," was prompt to note his uncle's vacancy.</p>

<p>"What you staring at, Nunkey?" he demanded, his mouth full of
roly-pudding, which he was stuffing down with all possible
dispatch.</p>

<p>"Hush, Johnny. Don't tease your uncle."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, my boy?"</p>

<p>"I mean..." Young John squeezed his last mouthful over his
windpipe and raised his plate. "I mean, you look just like you was
seein' a emeny.&mdash;More puddin', Aunt Polly!"</p>

<p>"What does the child mean? An anemone?"</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>" said John with the immense contempt of five years.
"I didn't say anner emeny." Here, he began to tuck in anew, aiding
the slow work of his spoon with his more habile fingers. "A emeny's
d emeny. Like on de pickshur in Aunt Polly's room. One...one's de
English, an' one's de emeny."</p>

<p>"It's the Battle of Waterloo," explained Polly. "He stands in
front of it every day."</p>

<p>"Yes. An' when I'm a big man, I'm goin' to be a sojer, an' wear
a red coat, an' make 'bung'!" and he shot an imaginary gun at his
sister, who squealed and ducked her head.</p>

<p>"An ancient wish, my son," said Mahony, when Johnny had been
reproved and Trotty comforted. "Tom-thumbs like you have voiced it
since the world&mdash;or rather since war first began."</p>

<p>"Don't care. Nunkey, why is de English and why is de emeny?"</p>

<p>But Mahony shrank from the gush of whats and whys he would let
loose on himself, did he attempt to answer this question. "Come,
shall uncle make you some boats to sail in the wash-tub?"</p>

<p>"Wiv a mast an' sails an' everyfing?" cried John wildly; and
throwing his spoon to the floor, he scrambled from his chair. "Oh
yes, Nunkey&mdash;dear Nunkey!"</p>

<p>"Dea Unkey!" echoed the shadow.</p>

<p>"Oh, you cupboard lovers, you!" said Mahony as, order restored
and sticky mouths wiped, two pudgy hands were thrust with a new
kindness into his.</p>

<p>He led the way to the yard; and having whittled out for the
children some chips left by the builders, he lighted his pipe and
sat down in the shade of the house. Here, through a veiling of
smoke, which hung motionless in the hot, still air, he watched the
two eager little mortals before him add their quota to the miracle
of life.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-3-3" id="ch-1-3-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>Polly had no such absorbing occupation to tide her over these
empty days of waiting; and sometimes&mdash;especially late in the
afternoon, when her household duties were done, the children safely
at play&mdash;she found it beyond her power to stitch quietly at
her embroidery. Letting the canvas fall to her knee, she would
listen, listen, listen till the blood sang in her ears, for the
footsteps and knocks at the door that never came. And did she draw
back the window-curtain and look out, there was not a soul to be
seen: not a trace of the string of prosperous, paying patients she
had once imagined winding their way to the door.</p>

<p>And meanwhile Richard was shut up in his room, making those
dreadful notes in the Bible which it pinched her heart even to
think of. He really did not seem to care whether he had a practice
or not. All the new instruments, got from Melbourne, lay unused in
their casings; and the horse was eating its head off, at over a
pound a week, in the livery-barn. Polly shrank from censuring her
husband, even in thought; but as she took up her work again, and
went on producing in wools a green basket of yellow fruit on a
magenta ground, she could not help reflecting what she would have
done at this pass, had she been a man. She would have announced the
beginning of her practice in big letters in the <i>Star</i>, and
she would have gone down into the township and mixed with people
and made herself known. With Richard, it was almost as if he felt
averse from bringing himself into public notice.</p>

<p>Only another month now, and the second instalment of interest
would fall due. Polly did not know exactly what the sum was; but
she did know the date. The first time, they had had no difficulty
in meeting the bill, owing to their economy in furnishing. But what
about this one, and the next again? How were payments to be made,
and kept up, if the patients would not come?</p>

<p>She wished with all her heart that she was ten years older. For
what could a person who was only eighteen be supposed to understand
of business? Richard's invariable answer, did she venture a word,
was not to worry her little head about such things.</p>

<p>When, however, another week had dribbled away in the same
fashion, Polly began to be afraid the date of payment had slipped
his memory altogether. She would need to remind him of it, even at
the risk of vexing him. And having cast about for a pretext to
intrude, she decided to ask his advice on a matter that was giving
her much uneasiness; though, had he been <i>really</i> busy, she
would have gone on keeping it to herself.</p>

<p>It related to little Johnny.</p>

<p>Johnny was a high-spirited, passionate child, who needed most
careful handling. At first she had managed him well enough. But
ever since his five months' boarding-out, he had fallen into
deceitful ways; and the habit of falsehood was gaining on him. Bad
by nature, Polly felt sure the child was not; but she could not
keep him on the straight path now he had discovered that a lie
might save him a punishment. He was not to be shamed out of telling
it; and the only other cure Polly knew of was whipping. She whipped
him; and provoked him to fury.</p>

<p>A new misdeed on his part gave her the handle she sought. Johnny
had surreptitiously entered her pantry and stolen a plateful of
cakes. Taxed with the theft he denied it; and cornered, laid,
Adam-like, the blame on his companion, asserting that Trotty had
persuaded him to take the goodies; though bewildered innocence was
writ all over the baby's chubby face.</p>

<p>Mahony had the young sinner up before him. But he was able
neither to touch the child's heart, nor to make him see the gravity
of what he had done: never being allowed inside the surgery, John
could now not take his eyes off the wonderful display of gold and
purple and red moths, which were pinned, with outstretched wings,
to a sheet of cork. He stood o-mouthed and absentminded, and only
once shot a blue glance at his uncle to say: "But if dey're so
baddy...den why did God <i>make</i> lies an' de
debble?"&mdash;which intelligent query hit the nail of one of
Mahony's own misgivings on the head.</p>

<p>No real depravity, was his verdict. Still, too much of a
handful, it was plain, for Polly's inexperience. "A problem for
John himself to tackle, my dear. Why should we have to drill a
non-existent morality into his progeny? Besides, I'm not going to
have you blamed for bad results, later on." He would write to John
there and then, and request that Johnny be removed from their
charge.</p>

<p>Polly was not prepared for this summary solution of her dilemma,
and began to regret having brought it up; though she could not but
agree with Richard that it would never do for the younger child to
be corrupted by a bad example. However she kept her wits about her.
Did John take the boy away, said she, she was afraid she would have
to ask for a larger housekeeping allowance. The withdrawal of the
money for Johnny's board would make a difference to their
income.</p>

<p>"Of course," returned Mahony easily, and was about to dismiss
the subject.</p>

<p>But Polly stood her ground. "Talking of money, Richard, I don't
know whether you remember...you've been so busy...that it's only
about a fortnight now till the second lot of interest falls
due."</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;a fortnight?" exclaimed her husband, and reached
out for an almanack. "Good Lord, so it is! And nothing doing yet,
Polly...absolutely nothing!"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, you can't expect to jump into a big practice all at
once, can you? But you see, I think the trouble is, not nearly
enough people know you've started." And a little imploringly, and
very apologetically, Polly unfolded her artless schemes for
self-advertisement.</p>

<p>"Wife, I've a grave suspicion!" said Mahony, and took her by the
chin. "While I've sat here with my head in the clouds, you've been
worrying over ways and means, and over having such an unpractical
old dreamer for a husband. Now, child, that won't do. I didn't
marry to have my girl puzzling her little brains where her next
day's dinner was to come from. Away with you, to your stitching!
Things will be all right, trust to me."</p>

<p>And Polly did trust him, and was so satisfied with what she had
effected that, raising her face for a kiss, she retired with an
easy mind to overhaul Johnny's little wardrobe.</p>

<p>But the door having clicked behind her, Mahony's air of forced
assurance died away. For an instant he hesitated beside the table,
on which a rampart of books lay open, then vigorously clapped each
volume to and moved to the window, chewing at the ends of his
beard. A timely interruption! What the dickens had he been about,
to forget himself in this fool's paradise, when the crassest of
material anxieties&mdash;that of pounds, shillings and
pence&mdash;was crouched, wolf-like, at his door?</p>

<p>That night he wakened with a jerk from an uneasy sleep. Though
at noon the day before, the thermometer had registered over a
hundred in the shade, it was now bitterly cold, and these abrupt
changes of temperature always whipped up his nerves. Even after he
had piled his clothes and an opossum-rug on top of the blankets, he
could not drop off again. He lay staring at the moonlit square of
the window, and thinking the black thoughts of night.</p>

<p>What if he could not manage to work up a practice?...found it
impossible to make a living? His plate had been on the door for
close on two months now, and he had barely a five-pound note to
show for it. What was to be done? Here Polly's words came back to
him with new stress. "Not nearly enough people know you've
started." That was it!&mdash;Polly had laid her finger on the
hitch. The genteel manners of the old country did not answer here;
instead of sitting twiddling his thumbs, waiting for patients to
seek him out, he ought to have adopted the screaming methods of
advertisement in vogue on Ballarat. To have had "Holloway's Pills
sold here!" "Teeth extracted painlessly!" "Cures guaranteed!"
painted man-high on his outside house-wall. To have gone up and
down and round the township; to have been on the spot when
accidents happened; to have hobnobbed with Tom, Dick and Harry in
bars and saloons. And he saw a figure that looked like his the
centre of a boisterous crowd; saw himself slapped on the back by
dirty hands, shouting and shouted to drinks. He turned his pillow,
to drive the image away. Whatever he had done or not done, the fact
remained that a couple of weeks hence he had to make up the sum of
over thirty pounds. And again he discerned a phantom self, this
time a humble supplicant for an extension of term, brought up short
against Ocock's stony visage, flouted by his cocksy clerk. Once
more he turned his pillow. These quarterly payments, which dotted
all his coming years, were like little rock-islands studding the
surface of an ocean, and telling of the sunken continent below:
this monstrous thousand odd pounds he had been fool enough to
borrow. Never would he be able to pay off such a sum, never again
be free from the incubus of debt. Meanwhile, not the ground he
stood on, not the roof over his head could actually be called his
own. He had also been too pushed for money, at the time, to take
Ocock's advice and insure his life.</p>

<p>These thoughts spun themselves to a nightmare-web, in which he
was the hapless fly. Putting a finger to his wrist, he found he had
the pulse of a hundred that was not uncommon to him. He got out of
bed, to dowse his head in a basin of water. Polly, only half awake,
sat up and said: "What's the matter, dear? Are you ill?" In
replying to her he disturbed the children, the door of whose room
stood ajar; and by the time quiet was restored, further sleep was
out of the question. He dressed and quitted the house.</p>

<p>Day was breaking; the moon, but an hour back a globe of polished
silver, had now no light left in her, and stole, a misty ghost,
across the dun-coloured sky. A bank of clouds that had had their
night-camp on the summit of Mount Warrenheip was beginning to
disperse; and the air had lost its edge. He walked out beyond the
cemetary, then sat down on a tree-stump and looked back. The houses
that nestled on the slope were growing momently whiter; but the
Flat was still sunk in shadow and haze, making old Warrenheip, for
all its half-dozen miles of distance, seem near enough to be
touched by hand. But even in full daylight this woody peak had a
way of tricking the eye. From the brow of the western hill, with
the Flat out of sight below, it appeared to stand at the very foot
of those streets that headed east&mdash;first of one, then of
another, moving with you as you changed position, like the eyes of
a portrait that follow you wherever you go.&mdash;And now the sky
was streaked with crimson-madder; the last clouds scattered,
drenched in orange and rose, and flames burned in the glass of
every window-pane. Up came the tip of the sun's rim, grew to a
fiery quarter, to a half; till, bounding free from the horizon, it
began to mount and to lose its girth in the immensity of the
sky.</p>

<p>The phantasms of the night yielded like the clouds to its power.
He was still reasonably young, reasonably sound, and had the better
part of a lifetime before him. Rising with a fresh alacrity, he
whistled to his dog, and walked briskly home to bath and
breakfast.</p>

<p>But that evening, at the heel of another empty day, his nervous
restlessness took him anew. From her parlour Polly could hear the
thud of his feet, going up and down, up and down his room. And it
was she who was to blame for disturbing him!</p>

<p>"Yet what else could I do?"</p>

<p>And meditatively pricking her needle in and out of the
window-curtain, Polly fell into a reverie over her husband and his
ways. How strange Richard was...how difficult! First, to be able to
forget all about how things stood with him, and then to be twice as
upset as other people.</p>

<p>John demanded the immediate delivery of his young son,
undertaking soon to knock all nasty tricks out of him. On the day
fixed for Johnny's departure husband and wife were astir soon after
dawn. Mahony was to have taken the child down to the coach-office.
But Johnny had been awake since two o'clock with excitement, and
was now so fractious that Polly tied on her bonnet and accompanied
them. She knew Richard's hatred of a scene.</p>

<p>"You just walk on, dear, and get his seat," she said, while she
dragged the cross, tired child on her hand to the public-house,
where even at this hour a posse of idlers hung about.</p>

<p>And she did well to be there. Instantly on arriving Johnny set
up a wail, because there was talk of putting him inside the
vehicle; and this persisted until the coachman, a goat-bearded
Yankee, came to the rescue and said he was darned if such a plucky
young nipper shouldn't get his way: he'd have the child tied on
beside him on the box-seat&mdash;be blowed if he wouldn't! But even
this did not satisfy Johnny; and while Mahony went to procure a
length of rope, he continued to prance round his aunt and to tug
ceaselessly at her sleeve.</p>

<p>"Can I dwive, Aunt Polly, can I dwive? Ask him, can I dwive!" he
roared, beating her skirts with his fists. He was only silenced by
the driver threatening to throw him as a juicy morsel to the gang
of bushrangers who, sure as blazes, would be waiting to stick the
coach up directly it entered the bush.</p>

<p>Husband and wife lingered to watch the start, when the champing
horses took a headlong plunge forward and, together with the coach,
were swallowed up in a whirlwind of dust. A last glimpse discovered
Johnny, pale and wide-eyed at the lurching speed, but sitting
bravely erect.</p>

<p>"The spirit of your brother in that child, my dear!" said Mahony
as they made to walk home.</p>

<p>"Poor little Johnny," and Polly wiped her eyes. "If only he was
going back to a mother who loved him, and would understand."</p>

<p>"I'm sure no mother could have done more for him than you,
love."</p>

<p>"Yes, but a real mother wouldn't need to give him up, however
naughty he had been."</p>

<p>"I think the young varmint might have shown some regret at
parting from you, after all this time," returned her husband, to
whom it was offensive if even a child was lacking in good feeling.
"He never turned his head. Well, I suppose it's a fact, as they
say, that the natural child is the natural barbarian."</p>

<p>"Johnny never meant any harm. It was I who didn't know how to
manage him," said Polly staunchly.&mdash;"Why, Richard, what
<i>is</i> the matter?" For letting her arm fall Mahony had dashed
to the other side of the road.</p>

<p>"Good God, Polly, look at this!"</p>

<p>"This" was a printed notice, nailed to a shed, which announced
that a sale of frontages in Mair and Webster Streets would shortly
be held.</p>

<p>"But it's not our road. I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, don't you see that if they're there already, they'll
be out with us before we can say Jack Robinson? And then where
shall I be?" gave back Mahony testily.</p>

<p>"Let us talk it over. But first come home and have breakfast.
Then...yes, then, I think you should go down and see Mr. Henry, and
hear what he says."</p>

<p>"You're right. I must see Ocock.&mdash;Confound the fellow! It's
he who has let me in for this."</p>

<p>"And probably he'll know some way out. What else is a lawyer
for, dear?"</p>

<p>"Quite true, my Polly. None the less, it looks as if I were in
for a run of real bad luck, all along the line."</p>

<h3><a name="ch-1-3-4" id="ch-1-3-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>One hot morning some few days later, Polly, with Trotty at her
side, stood on the doorstep shading her eyes with her hand. She was
on the look-out for her "vegetable man," who drove in daily from
the Springs with his greenstuff. He was late as usual: if Richard
would only let her deal with the cheaper, more punctual Ah Sing,
who was at this moment coming up the track. But Devine was a
reformed character: after, as a digger, having squandered a fortune
in a week, he had given up the drink and, backed by a hard-working,
sober wife, was now trying to earn a living at market-gardening. So
he had to be encouraged.</p>

<p>The Chinaman jog-trotted towards them, his baskets a-sway, his
mouth stretched to a friendly grin. "You no want cabbagee to-day?
Me got velly good cabbagee," he said persuasively and lowered his
pole.</p>

<p>"No thank you, John, not to-day. Me wait for white man."</p>

<p>"Me bling pleasant for lilly missee," said the Chow; and
unknotting a dirty nosecloth, he drew from it an ancient lump of
candied ginger. "Lilly missee eatee him...oh, yum, yum! Velly good.
My word!"</p>

<p>But Chinamen to Trotty were fearsome bogies, corresponding to
the swart-faced, white-eyed chimney-sweeps of the English nursery.
She hid behind her aunt, holding fast to the latter's skirts, and
only stealing an occasional peep from one saucer-like blue eye.</p>

<p>"Thank you, John. Me takee chowchow for lilly missee," said
Polly, who had experience in disposing of such savoury morsels.</p>

<p>"You no buy cabbagee to-day?" repeated Ah Sing, with the catlike
persistence of his race. And as Polly, with equal firmness and
good-humour, again shook her head, he shouldered his pole and
departed at a half-run, crooning as he went.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the bottom of the road another figure had come into
view. It was not Devine in his spring-cart; it was some one on
horseback, was a lady, in a holland habit. The horse, a piebald,
advanced at a sober pace, and&mdash;"Why, good gracious! I believe
she's coming here."</p>

<p>At the first of the three houses the rider had dismounted, and
knocked at the door with the butt of her whip. After a word with
the woman who opened, she threw her riding-skirt over one arm, put
the other through the bridle, and was now making straight for
them.</p>

<p>As she drew near she smiled, showing a row of white teeth. "Does
Dr. Mahony live here?"</p>

<p>Misfortune of misfortunes!&mdash;Richard was out.</p>

<p>But almost instantly Polly grasped that this would tell in his
favour. "He won't be long, I know."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said the lady, "if he would come out to my house
when he gets back? I am Mrs Glendinning&mdash;of Dandaloo."</p>

<p>Polly flushed, with sheer satisfaction: Dandaloo was one of the
largest stations in the neighbourhood of Ballarat. "Oh, I'm certain
he will," she answered quickly.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you think so," said Mrs. Glendinning. "A mutual
friend, Mr. Henry Ocock, tells me how clever he is."</p>

<p>Polly's brain leapt at the connection; on the occasion of
Richard's last visit the lawyer had again repeated the promise to
put a patient in his way. Ocock was one of those people, said
Richard, who only remembered your existence when he saw
you.&mdash;Oh, what a blessing in disguise had been that
troublesome old land sale!</p>

<p>The lady had stooped to Trotty, whom she was trying to coax from
her lurking-place. "What a darling! How I envy you!"</p>

<p>"Have you no children?" Polly asked shyly, when Trotty's
relationship had been explained.</p>

<p>"Yes, a boy. But I should have liked a little girl of my own.
Boys are so difficult," and she sighed.</p>

<p>The horse nuzzling for sugar roused Polly to a sense of her
remissness. "Won't you come in and rest a little, after your ride?"
she asked; and without hesitation Mrs. Glendinning said she would
like to, very much indeed; and tying the hone to the fence, she
followed Polly into the house.</p>

<p>The latter felt proud this morning of its apple-pie order. She
drew up the best armchair, placed a footstool before it and herself
carried in a tray with refreshments. Mrs. Glendinning had taken
Trotty on her lap, and given the child her long gold chains to play
with. Polly thought her the most charming creature in the world.
She had a slender waist, and an abundant light brown chignon, and
cheeks of a beautiful pink, in which two fascinating dimples came
and went. The feather from her riding-hat lay on her neck. Her eyes
were the colour of forget-me-nots, her mouth was red as any rose.
She had, too, so sweet and natural a manner that Polly was soon
chatting frankly about herself and her life, Mrs. Glendinning
listening with her face pressed to the spun-glass of Trotty's
hair.</p>

<p>When she rose, she clasped both Polly's hands in hers. "You dear
little woman...may I kiss you? I am ever so much older than
you."</p>

<p>"I am eighteen," said Polly.</p>

<p>"And I on the shady side of twenty-eight!"</p>

<p>They laughed and kissed. "I shall ask your husband to bring you
out to see me. And take no refusal. <i>au revoir</i>!" and riding
off, she turned in the saddle and waved her hand.</p>

<p>For all her pleasurable excitement Polly did not let the grass
grow under her feet. There being still no sign of Richard&mdash;he
had gone to Soldiers' Hill to extract a rusty nail from a child's
foot&mdash;Ellen was sent to summon him home; and when the girl
returned with word that he was on the way, Polly dispatched her to
the livery-barn, to order the horse to be got ready.</p>

<p>Richard took the news coolly. "Did she say what the matter
was?"</p>

<p>No, she hadn't; and Polly had not liked to ask her; it could
surely be nothing very serious, or she would have mentioned it.</p>

<p>"H'm. Then it's probably as I thought. Glendinning's failing is
well known. Only the other day, I heard that more than one medical
man had declined to have anything further to do with the case. It's
a long way out, and fees are not always forthcoming. <i>he</i>
doesn't ask for a doctor, and, womanlike, she forgets to pay the
bills. I suppose they think they'll try a greenhorn this time."</p>

<p>Pressed by Polly, who was curious to learn everything about her
new friend, he answered: "I should be sorry to tell you, my dear,
how many bottles of brandy it is Glendinning's boast he can empty
in a week."</p>

<p>"Drink? Oh, Richard, how terrible! And that pretty, pretty
woman!" cried Polly, and drove her thoughts backwards: she had seen
no hint of tragedy in her caller's lovely face. However, she did
not wait to ponder, but asked, a little anxiously: "But you'll go,
dear, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Go? Of course I shall! Beggars can't be choosers." "Besides,
you know, you <i>might</i> be able to do something where other
people have failed."</p>

<p>Mahony rode out across the Flat. For a couple of miles his route
was one with the Melbourne Road, on which plied the usual motley
traffic. Then, branching off at right angles, it dived into the
bush&mdash;in this case a scantly wooded, uneven plain, burnt
tobacco-brown and hard as iron.</p>

<p>Here went no one but himself. He and the mare were the sole
living creatures in what, for its stillness, might have been a
painted landscape. Not a breath of air stirred the weeping
grey-green foliage of the gums; nor was there any bird-life to
rustle the leaves, or peck, or chirrup. Did he draw rein, the
silence was so intense that he could almost hear it.</p>

<p>On striking the outlying boundary of Dandaloo, he dismounted to
slip a rail. After that he was in and out of the saddle, his way
leading through numerous gateless paddocks before it brought him up
to the homestead.</p>

<p>This, a low white wooden building, overspread by a broad
verandah&mdash;from a distance it looked like an elongated
mushroom&mdash;stood on a hill. At the end, the road had run
alongside a well-stocked fruit and flower-garden; but the hillside
itself, except for a gravelled walk in front of the house, was
uncultivated&mdash;was given over to dead thistles and brown
weeds.</p>

<p>Fastening his bridle to a post, Mahony unstrapped his bag of
necessaries and stepped on to the verandah. A row of French windows
stood open; but flexible green sun-blinds hid the rooms from view.
The front door was a French window, too, differing from the rest
only in its size. There was neither bell nor knocker. While he was
rapping with the knuckles on the panel, one of the blinds was
pushed aside and Mrs. Glendinning came out.</p>

<p>She was still in hat and riding-habit; had herself, she said,
reached home but half an hour ago. Summoning a station-hand to
attend to the horse, she raised a blind and ushered Mahony into the
dining-room, where she had been sitting at lunch, alone at the head
of a large table. A Chinaman brought fresh plates, and Mahony was
invited to draw up his chair. He had an appetite after his ride;
the room was cool and dark; there were no flies.</p>

<p>Throughout the meal, the lady kept up a running fire of
talk&mdash;the graceful chitchat that sits so well on pretty lips.
She spoke of the coming Races; of the last Government House Ball;
of the untimely death of Governor Hotham. To Mahony she
instinctively turned a different side out, from that which had
captured Polly. With all her well-bred ease, there was a womanly
deference in her manner, a readiness to be swayed, to stand
corrected. The riding-dress set off her figure; and her delicate
features were perfectly chiselled. ("Though she'll be florid before
she's forty.")</p>

<p>Some juicy nectarines finished, she pushed back her chair. "And
now, doctor, will you come and see your patient?"</p>

<p>Mahony followed her down a broad, bare passage. A number of
rooms opened off it, but instead of entering one of these she led
him out to a back verandah. Here, before a small door, she listened
with bent head, then turned the handle and went in.</p>

<p>The room was so dark that Mahony could see nothing. Gradually he
made out a figure lying on a stretcher-bed. A watcher sat at the
bedside. The atmosphere was more than close, smelt rank and sour.
His first request was for light and air.</p>

<p>It was the wreck of a fine man that lay there, strapped over the
chest, bound hand and foot to the framework of the bed. The
forehead, on which the hair had receded to a few mean grey wisps,
was high and domed, the features were straight with plenty of bone
in them, the shoulders broad, the arms long. The skin of the face
had gone a mahogany brown from exposure, and a score of deep
wrinkles ran out fan-wise from the corners of the closed lids.
Mahony untied the dirty towels that formed the bandages&mdash;they
had cut ridges in the limbs they confined&mdash;and took one of the
heavy wrists in his hand.</p>

<p>"How long has he lain like this?" he asked, as he returned the
arm to its place.</p>

<p>"How long is it, Saunderson?" asked Mrs. Glendinning. She had
sat down on a chair at the foot of the bed; her skirts overflowed
the floor.</p>

<p>The watcher guessed it would be since about the same time
yesterday.</p>

<p>"Was he unusually violent on this occasion?&mdash;for I presume
such attacks are not uncommon with him," continued Mahony, who had
meanwhile made a superficial examination of the sick man.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say they are only too common, doctor," replied
the lady. &mdash;"Was he worse than usual this time, Saunderson?"
she turned again to the man; at which fresh proof of her want of
knowledge Mahony mentally raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"To say trewth, I never see'd the boss so bad before," answered
Saunderson solemnly, grating the palms of the big red hands that
hung down between his knees. "And I've helped him through the jumps
more'n once. It's my opinion it would ha' been a narrow squeak for
him this time, if me and a mate hadn't nipped in and got these
bracelets on him. There he was, ravin' and sweatin' and cursin' his
head off, grey as death. Hell-gate, he called it, said he was
devil's-porter at hell-gate, and kept hollerin' for napkins and his
firesticks. Poor ol' boss! It <i>was</i> hell for him and no
mistake!"</p>

<p>By dint of questioning Mahony elicited the fact that Glendinning
had been unseated by a young horse, three days previously. At the
time, no heed was paid to the trifling accident. Later on, however,
complaining of feeling cold and unwell, he went to bed, and after
lying wakeful for some hours was seized by the horrors of
delirium.</p>

<p>Requesting the lady to leave them, Mahony made a more detailed
examination. His suspicions were confirmed: there was internal
trouble of old standing, rendered acute by the fall. Aided by
Saunderson, he worked with restoratives for the best part of an
hour. In the end he had the satisfaction of seeing the coma pass
over into a natural repose.</p>

<p>"Well, he's through this time, but I won't answer for the next,"
he said, and looked about him for a basin in which to wash his
hands. "Can't you manage to keep the drink from him?&mdash;or at
least to limit him?"</p>

<p>"Nay, the Almighty Himself couldn't do that," gave back
Saunderson, bringing forward soap and a tin dish.</p>

<p>"How does it come that he lies in a place like this?" asked
Mahony, as he dried his hands on a corner of the least dirty towel,
and glanced curiously round. The room&mdash;in size it did not
greatly exceed that of a ship's-cabin&mdash;was in a state of
squalid disorder. Besides a deal table and a couple of chairs, its
main contents were rows and piles of old paper-covered magazines,
the thick brown dust on which showed that they had not been moved
for months&mdash;or even years. The whitewashed walls were
smoke-tanned and dotted with millions of fly-specks; the dried
corpses of squashed spiders formed large black patches; all four
corners of the ceiling were festooned with cobwebs.</p>

<p>Saunderson shrugged his shoulders. "This was his den when he
first was manager here, in old Morrison's time, and he's stuck to
it ever since. He shuts himself up in here, and won't have a female
cross the threshold &mdash;nor yet Madam G. herself."</p>

<p>Having given final instructions, Mahony went out to rejoin the
lady.</p>

<p>"I will not conceal from you that your husband is in a very
precarious condition."</p>

<p>"Do you mean, doctor, he won't live long?" She had evidently
been lying down: one side of her face was flushed and marked.
Crying, too, or he was much mistaken: her lids were red-rimmed, her
shapely features swollen.</p>

<p>"Ah, you ask too much of me; I am only a woman; I have no
influence over him," she said sadly, and shook her head.</p>

<p>"What is his age?"</p>

<p>"He is forty-seven."</p>

<p>Mahony had put him down for at least ten years older, and said
so. But the lady was not listening: she fidgeted with her
lace-edged handkerchief, looked uneasy, seemed to be in debate with
herself. Finally she said aloud: "Yes, I will." And to him:
"Doctor, would you come with me a moment?"</p>

<p>This time she conducted him to a well-appointed bedchamber, off
which gave a smaller room, containing a little four-poster draped
in dimity. With a vague gesture in the direction of the bed, she
sank on a chair beside the door.</p>

<p>Drawing the curtains Mahony discovered a fair-haired boy of some
eight or nine years old. He lay with his head far back, his mouth
wide open&mdash;apparently fast asleep.</p>

<p>But the doctor's eye was quick to see that it was no natural
sleep. "Good God! who is responsible for this?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Glendinning held her handkerchief to her face. "I have
never told any one before," she wept. "The shame of it, doctor...is
more than I can bear."</p>

<p>"Who is the blackguard? Come, answer me, if you please!"</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor, don't scold me...I am so unhappy." The pretty face
puckered and creased; the full bosom heaved. "He is all I have. And
such a bright, clever little fellow! You will cure him for me,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"How often has it happened?"</p>

<p>"I don't know...about five or six times, I think...perhaps more.
There's a place not far from here where he can get it...an old
hut-cook my husband dismissed once, in a fit of temper&mdash;he has
oh such a temper! Eddy saddles his pony and rides out there, if
he's not watched; and then...then, they bring him back...like
this."</p>

<p>"But who supplies him with money?"</p>

<p>"Money? Oh, but doctor, he can't be kept without pocket-money!
He has always had as much as he wanted.&mdash;No, it is all my
husband's doing,"&mdash;and now she broke out in one of those
shameless confessions, from which the medical adviser is never
safe. "He hates me; he is only happy if he can hurt me and
humiliate me. I don't care what becomes of him. The sooner he dies
the better!"</p>

<p>"Compose yourself, my dear lady. Later you may regret such hasty
words. &mdash;And what has this to do with the child? Come, speak
out. It will be a relief to you to tell me."</p>

<p>"You are so kind, doctor," she sobbed, and drank, with
hysterical gurglings, the glass of water Mahony poured out for her.
"Yes, I will tell you everything. It began years ago&mdash;when
Eddy was only a tot in jumpers. It used to amuse my husband to see
him toss off a glass of wine like a grown-up person; and it
<i>was</i> comical, when he sipped it, and smacked his lips. But
then he grew to like it, and to ask for it, and be cross when he
was refused. And then...then he learnt how to get it for himself.
And when his father saw I was upset about it, he egged him
on&mdash;gave it to him on the sly.&mdash;Oh, he is a bad man,
doctor, a <i>bad</i>, cruel man! He says such wicked things, too.
He doesn't believe in God, or that it is wrong to take one's own
life, and he says he never wanted children. He jeers at me because
I am fond of Eddy, and because I go to church when I can, and
says...oh, I know I am not clever, but I am not quite such a fool
as he makes me out to be. He speaks to me as if I were the dirt
under his feet. He can't bear the sight of me. I have heard him
curse the day he first saw me. And so he's only too glad to be able
to come between my boy and me...in any way he can."</p>

<p>Mahony led the weeping woman back to the dining-room. There he
sat long, patiently listening and advising; sat, till Mrs.
Glendinning had dried her eyes and was her charming self once
more.</p>

<p>The gist of what he said was, the boy must be removed from home
at once, and placed in strict, yet kind hands.</p>

<p>Here, however, he ran up against a weak maternal obstinacy. "Oh,
but I couldn't part from Eddy. He is all I have...And so devoted to
his mammy."</p>

<p>As Mahony insisted, she looked the picture of helplessness. "But
I should have no idea how to set about it. And my husband would put
every possible obstacle in the way."</p>

<p>"With your permission I will arrange the matter myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, how kind you are!" cried Mrs. Glendinning again. "But mind,
doctor, it must be somewhere where Eddy will lack none of the
comforts he is accustomed to, and where his poor mammy can see him
whenever she wishes. Otherwise he will fret himself ill."</p>

<p>Mahony promised to do his best to satisfy her, and declining,
very curtly, the wine she pressed on him, went out to mount his
horse which had been brought round.</p>

<p>Following him on to the verandah, Mrs. Glendinning became once
more the pretty woman frankly concerned for her appearance. "I
don't know how I look, I'm sure," she said apologetically, and
raised both hands to her hair. "Now I will go and rest for an hour.
There is to be opossuming and a moonlight picnic to-night at
Warraluen." Catching Mahony's eye fixed on her with a meaning
emphasis, she changed colour. "I cannot sit at home and think,
doctor. I <i>must</i> distract myself; or I should go mad."</p>

<p>When he was in the saddle she showed him her dimples again, and
her small, even teeth. "I want you to bring your wife to see me
next time you come," she sad, patting the horse's neck. "I took a
great fancy to her&mdash;a sweet little woman!"</p>

<p>But Mahony, jogging downhill, said to himself he would think
twice before introducing Polly there. His young wife's sunny,
girlish outlook should not, with his consent, be clouded by a
knowledge of the sordid things this material prosperity hid from
view. A whited sepulchre seemed to him now the richly appointed
house, the well-stocked gardens, the acres on acres of good
pasture-land: a fair outside when, within, all was foul. He called
to mind what he knew by hearsay of the owner. Glendinning was one
of the pioneer squatters of the district, had held the run for
close on fifteen years. Nowadays, when the land round was entirely
taken up, and a place like Ballarat stood within stone's-throw, it
was hard to imagine the awful solitude to which the early settlers
had been condemned. Then, with his next neighbour miles and miles
away, Melbourne, the nearest town, a couple of days' ride through
trackless bush, a man was a veritable prisoner in this desert of
paddocks, with not a soul to speak to but rough station-hands, and
nothing to occupy his mind but the damage done by summer droughts
and winter floods. No support or comradeship in the wife
either&mdash;this poor pretty foolish little woman: "With the
brains of a pigeon!" Glendinning had the name of being intelligent:
was it, under these circumstances, matter for wonder that he should
seek to drown doubts, memories, inevitable regrets; should be led
on to the bitter discovery that forgetfulness alone rendered life
endurable? Yes, there was something sinister in the dead stillness
of the melancholy bush; in the harsh, merciless sunlight of the
late afternoon.</p>

<p>A couple of miles out his horse cast a shoe, and it was evening
before he reached home. Polly was watching for him on the doorstep,
in a twitter lest some accident had happened or he had had a brush
with bushrangers.</p>

<p>"It never rains but it pours, dear!" was her greeting: he had
been twice sent for to the Flat, to attend a woman in
labour.&mdash;And with barely time to wash the worst of the ride's
dust off him, he had to pick up his bag and hurry away.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-3-5" id="ch-1-3-5"></a>Chapter V</h3>

<p>"A very striking-looking man! With perfect manners&mdash;and
beautiful hands."</p>

<p>Her head bent over her sewing, Polly repeated these words to
herself with a happy little smile. They had been told her, in
confidence, by Mrs. Glendinning, and had been said by this lady's
best friend, Mrs. Urquhart of Yarangobilly: on the occasion of
Richard's second call at Dandaloo, he had been requested to ride to
the neighbouring station to visit Mrs. Urquhart, who was in
delicate health. And of course Polly had passed the flattering
opinion on; for, though she was rather a good hand at keeping a
secret&mdash;Richard declared he had never known a better&mdash;yet
that secret did not exist&mdash;or up till now had not
existed&mdash;which she could imagine herself keeping from him.</p>

<p>For the past few weeks these two ladies had vied with each other
in singing Richard's praises, and in making much of Polly: the
second time Mrs. Glendinning called she came in her buggy, and
carried off Polly, and Trotty, too, to Yarangobilly, where there
was a nestful of little ones for the child to play with. Another
day a whole brakeful of lively people drove up to the door in the
early morning, and insisted on Polly accompanying them, just as she
was, to the Racecourse on the road to Creswick's Creek. And
everybody was so kind to her that Polly heartily enjoyed herself,
in spite of her plain print dress. She won a pair of gloves and a
piece of music in a philippine with Mr Urquhart, a jolly,
carroty-haired man, beside whom she sat on the box-seat coming
home; and she was lucky enough to have half-a-crown on one of the
winners. An impromptu dance was got up that evening by the merry
party, in a hall in the township; and Polly had the honour of a
turn with Mr. Henry Ocock, who was most affable. Richard also
looked in for an hour towards the end, and valsed her and Mrs.
Glendinning round.</p>

<p>Polly had quite lost her heart to her new friend. At the outset
Richard had rather frowned on the intimacy&mdash;but then he was a
person given to taking unaccountable antipathies. In this case,
however, he had to yield; for not only did a deep personal liking
spring up between the two women, but a wave of pity swept over
Polly, blinding her to more subtle considerations. Before Mrs.
Glendinning had been many times at the house, she had poured out
all her troubles to Polly, impelled thereto by Polly's quick
sympathy and warm young eyes. Richard had purposely given his wife
few details of his visits to Dandaloo; but Mrs. Glendinning knew no
such scruples, and cried her eyes out on Polly's shoulder.</p>

<p>What a dreadful man the husband must be! "For she really is the
dearest little woman, Richard. And means so well with every
one&mdash;I've never heard her say a sharp or unkind
word.&mdash;Well, not very clever, perhaps. But everybody can't be
clever, can they? And she's good&mdash;which is better. The only
thing she seems a teeny-weeny bit foolish about is her boy. I'm
afraid she'll never consent to part with him."&mdash;Polly said
this to prepare her husband, who was in correspondence on the
subject with Archdeacon Long and with John in Melbourne. Richard
was putting himself to a great deal of trouble, and would naturally
be vexed if nothing came of it.</p>

<p>Polly paid her first visit to Dandaloo with considerable
trepidation. For Mrs. Urquhart, who herself was happily
married&mdash;although, it was true, her merry, red-haired husband
had the reputation of being a <i>little</i> too fond of the ladies,
and though he certainly did not make such a paying concern of
Yarangobilly as Mr. Glendinning of Dandaloo&mdash;Mrs. Urquhart had
whispered to Polly as they sat chatting on the verandah: "Such a
<i>dreadful</i> man, my dear!...a perfect brute! Poor little Agnes.
It is wonderful how she keeps her spirits up."</p>

<p>Polly, however, was in honour bound to admit that to her the
owner of Dandaloo had appeared anything but the monster report made
him out to be. He was perfectly sober the day she was there, and
did not touch wine at luncheon; and afterwards he had been most
kind, taking her with him on a quiet little broad-backed mare to an
outlying part of the station, and giving her several hints how to
improve her seat. He was certainly very haggard-looking, and deeply
wrinkled, and at table his hand shook so that the water in his
glass ran over. But all this only made Polly feel sorry for him,
and long to help him.</p>

<p>"My dear, you <i>are</i> favoured! I never knew James make such
an offer before," whispered Mrs. Glendinning, as she pinned her
ample riding-skirt round her friend's slim hips.</p>

<p>The one thing about him that disturbed Polly was his manner
towards his wife: he was savagely ironic with her, and trampled
hobnailed on her timid opinions. But then Agnes didn't know how to
treat him, Polly soon saw that: she was nervous and
fluttery&mdash;evasive, too; and once during lunch even told a
deliberate fib. Slight as was her acquaintance with him, Polly felt
sure this want of courage must displease him; for there was
something very simple and direct about his own way of speaking.</p>

<p>"My dear, why don't you stand up to him?" asked little
Polly.</p>

<p>"Dearest, I dare not. If you knew him as I do, Polly...He
<i>terrifies</i> me.&mdash;Oh, what a lucky little woman you
are...to have a husband like yours."</p>

<p>Polly had recalled these words that very morning as she stood to
watch Richard ride away: never did he forget to kiss her good-bye,
or to turn and wave to her at the foot of the road. Each time she
admired afresh the figure he cut on horseback: he was so tall and
slender, and sat so straight in his saddle. Now, too, he had
yielded to her persuasions and shaved off his beard; and his
moustache and side-whiskers were like his hair, of an extreme,
silky blond. Ever since the day of their first meeting at Beamish's
Family Hotel, Polly had thought her husband the handsomest man in
the world. And the best, as well. He had his peculiarities, of
course; but so had every husband; and it was part of a wife's duty
to study them, to adapt herself to them, or to endeavour to tone
them down. And now came these older, wiser ladies and confirmed her
high opinion of him. Polly beamed with happiness at this juncture,
and registered a silent vow always to be the best of wives.</p>

<p>Not like&mdash;but here she tripped and coloured, on the
threshold of her thought. She had recently been the recipient of a
very distressing confidence; one, too, which she was not at liberty
to share, even with Richard. For, after the relief of a
thorough-paced confession, Mrs. Glendinning had implored her not to
breathe a word to him&mdash;"I could never look him in the face
again, love!" Besides, the affair was of such a painful nature that
Polly felt little desire to draw Richard into it; it was bad enough
that she herself should know. The thing was this: once when Polly
had stayed overnight at Dandaloo Agnes Glendinning in a sudden fit
of misery had owned to her that she cared for another person more
than for her own husband, and that her feelings were returned.</p>

<p>Shocked beyond measure, Polly tried to close her friend's lips.
"I don't think you should mention any names, Agnes," she cried.
"Afterwards, my dear, you might regret it."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Glendinning was hungry for the luxury of
speech&mdash;not even to Louisa Urquhart had she broken silence,
she wept; and that, for the sake of Louisa's children&mdash;and she
persisted in laying her heart bare. And here certain vague
suspicions that had crossed Polly's mind on the night of the
impromptu ball&mdash;they were gone again, in an instant, quick as
thistledown on the breeze&mdash;these suddenly returned, life-size
and weighty; and the name that was spoken came as no surprise to
her. Yes, it was Mr. Henry Ocock to whom poor Agnes was attached.
There had been a mutual avowal of affection, sobbed the latter;
they met as often as circumstances permitted. Polly was
thunder-struck: knowing Agnes as she did, she herself could not
believe any harm of her; but she shuddered at the thought of what
other people&mdash;Richard, for instance&mdash;would say, did they
get wind of it. She implored her friend to caution. She ought
never, never to see Mr. Ocock. Why did she not go away to Melbourne
for a time? And why had he come to Ballarat?</p>

<p>"To be near me, dearest, to help me if I should need
him.&mdash;Oh, you can't think what a comfort it is, Polly, to feel
that he <i>is</i> here&mdash;so good, and strong, and
clever!&mdash;Yes, I know what you mean...but this is quite, quite
different. Henry does not expect me to be clever, too&mdash;does
not want me to be. He prefers me as I am. He dislikes clever
women...would never marry one. And we <i>shall</i> marry, darling,
some day&mdash;when..."</p>

<p>Henry Ocock! Polly tried to focus everything she knew of him,
all her fleeting impressions, in one picture&mdash;and failed. He
had made himself very agreeable, the single time she had met him;
but...There was Richard's opinion of him: Richard did not like him
or trust him; he thought him unscrupulous in business, cold and
self-seeking. Poor, poor little Agnes! That such a misfortune
should befall just her! Stranger still that she, Polly, should be
mixed up in it.</p>

<p>She had, of course, always known from books that such things did
happen; but then they seemed quite different, and very far away.
Her thoughts at this crisis were undeniably woolly; but the gist of
them was, that life and books had nothing in common. For in stories
the woman who forgot herself was always a bad woman; whereas not
the harshest critic could call poor Agnes bad. Indeed, Polly felt
that even if some one proved to her that her friend had actually
done wrong, she would not on that account be able to stop caring
for her, or feeling sorry for her. It was all very uncomfortable
and confusing.</p>

<p>While these thoughts came and went, she half sat, half knelt, a
pair of scissors in her hand. She was busy cutting out a dress, and
no table being big enough for the purpose, had stretched the
material on the parlour floor. This would be the first new dress
she had had since her marriage; and it was high time, considering
all the visiting and going about that fell to her lot just now.
Sara had sent the pattern up from Melbourne, and John, hearing what
was in the wind, had most kindly and generously made her a present
of the silk. Polly hoped she would not bungle it in the cutting;
but skirts were growing wider and wider, and John had not reckoned
with quite the newest fashion.</p>

<p>Steps in the passage made her note subconsciously that Ned had
arrived&mdash;Jerry had been in the house for the past three weeks,
with a sprained wrist. And at this moment her younger brother
himself entered the room, Trotty throned on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Picking his steps round the sea of stuff, Jerry sat down and
lowered Trotty to his knee. "Ned's grizzling for tea."</p>

<p>Polly did not reply; she was laying an odd-shaped piece of paper
now this way, now that.</p>

<p>For a while Jerry played with the child. Then he burst out: "I
say, Poll!" And since Polly paid no heed to his apostrophe:</p>

<p>"Richard says I can get back to work to-morrow."</p>

<p>"That's a good thing," answered his sister with an air of
abstraction: she had solved her puzzle to within half a yard.</p>

<p>Jerry cast a boyishly imploring glance at her back, and rubbed
his chin with his hand. "Poll, old girl&mdash;I say, wouldn't you
put in a word for me with Richard? I'm hanged if I want to go back
to the claim. I'm sick to death of digging."</p>

<p>At this Polly did raise her head, to regard him with grave eyes.
"What! tired of work already, Jerry? I don't know what Richard will
say to that, I'm sure. You had better speak to him yourself."</p>

<p>Again Jerry rubbed his chin. "That's just it&mdash;what's so
beastly hard. I know he'll say I ought to stick to it."</p>

<p>"So do I."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd rather groom the horse than that."</p>

<p>"But think how pleased you were at first!"</p>

<p>Jerry ruefully admitted it. "One expects to dig out gold like
spuds; while the real thing's enough to give you the blight. As for
stopping a wages-man all my life, I won't do it. I might just as
well go home and work in a Lancashire pit."</p>

<p>"But Ned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ned! Ned walks about with his head in the clouds. He's
always blowing of what he's <i>going</i> to do, and gets his steam
off that way. I'm different."</p>

<p>But Jerry's words fell on deaf ears. A noise in the next room
was engaging Polly's whole attention. She heard a burr of
suppressed laughter, a scuffle and what sounded like a sharp slap.
Jumping up she went to the door, and was just in time to see Ellen
whisk out of the dining-room.</p>

<p>Ned sat in an armchair, with his feet on the chimney-piece. "I
had the girl bring in a log, Poll," he said; and looked back and up
at his sister with his cheery smile. Standing behind him, Polly
laid her hand on his hair. "I'll go and see after the tea." Ned was
so unconcerned that she hesitated to put a question.</p>

<p>In the kitchen she had no such tender scruples; nor was she
imposed on by the exaggerated energy with which Ellen bustled
about. "What was that noise I heard in the dining-room just now?"
she demanded.</p>

<p>"Noise? I dunno," gave back the girl crossly without facing
her.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Ellen! Do you think I didn't hear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, get along with you! It was only one of Ned's jokes." And
going on her knees, Ellen set to scrubbing the brick floor with a
hiss and a scratch that rendered speech impossible. Polly took up
the laden tea-tray and carried it into the dining-room. Richard had
come home, and the four drew chairs to the table.</p>

<p>Mahony had a book with him; he propped it open against the
butter-cooler, and snatched sentences as he ate. It fell to Ned to
keep the ball rolling. Polly was distraite to the point of going
wrong in her sugars; Jerry uneasy at the prospect of coming in
conflict with his brother-in-law, whom he thought the world of.</p>

<p>Ned was as full of talk as an egg of meat. The theme he dwelt
longest on was the new glory that lay in store for the Ballarat
diggings. At present these were under a cloud. The alluvial was
giving out, and the costs and difficulties of boring through the
rock seemed insuperable. One might hear the opinion freely
expressed that Ballarat's day as premier goldfield was done. Ned
set up this belief merely for the pleasure of demolishing it. He
had it at first hand that great companies were being formed to
carry on operations. These would reckon their areas in acres
instead of feet, would sink to a depth of a quarter of a mile or
more, raise washdirt in hundreds of tons per day. One such company,
indeed, had already sprung into existence, out on Golden Point; and
now was the time to nip in. If he, Ned, had the brass, or knew
anybody who'd lend it to him, he'd buy up all the shares he could
get. Those who followed his lead would make their fortunes. "I say,
Richard, it'ud be something for you."</p>

<p>His words evoked no response. Sorry though I shall be, thought
Polly, dear Ned had better not come to the house so often in
future. I wonder if I need tell Richard why. Jerry was on pins and
needles, and even put Trotty ungently from him: Richard would be so
disgusted by Ned's blatherskite that he would have no patience left
to listen to him.</p>

<p>Mahony kept his nose to his book. As a matter of principle. He
made a rule of believing, on an average, about the half of what Ned
said. To appear to pay attention to him would spur him on to more
flagrant over-statements.</p>

<p>"D'ye hear, Richard? Now's your chance," repeated Ned, not to be
done. "A very different thing this, I can tell you, from running
round dosing people for the collywobbles. I know men who are
raising the splosh any way they can to get in."</p>

<p>"I dare say. There's never been any lack of gamblers on
Ballarat," said Mahony dryly, and passed his cup to be
refilled.</p>

<p>Pig-headed fool! was Ned's mental retort, as he sliced a chunk
of rabbit-pie. "Well, I bet you'll feel sore some day you didn't
take my advice," he said aloud.</p>

<p>"We shall see, my lad, we shall see!" replied Mahony. "In the
meantime, let me inform you, I can make good use of every penny I
have. So if you've come here thinking you can wheedle something out
of me, you're mistaken." He could seldom resist tearing the veil
from Ned's gross hints and impostures.</p>

<p>"Oh no, Richard dear!" interpolated Polly, in her role of
keeper-of-the-peace.</p>

<p>Ned answered huffily: "'Pon my word, I never met such a fellow
as you, for thinking the worst of people."</p>

<p>The thrust went home. Mahony clapped his book to. "You lay
yourself open to it, sir! If I'm wrong, I beg your pardon. But for
goodness' sake, Ned, put all these trashy ideas of making a fortune
out of your mind. Digging is played out, I tell you. Decent people
turned their backs on it long ago."</p>

<p>"That's what I think, too," threw in Jerry.</p>

<p>Mahony bit his lip. "Come, come, now, what do you know about
it?"</p>

<p>Jerry flushed and floundered, till Polly came to his aid. "He's
been wanting to speak to you, Richard. He hates the work as much as
you did."</p>

<p>"Well, he has a tongue of his own.&mdash;Speak for yourself, my
boy!"</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Jerry made his appeal; and fearing lest Richard
should throw him, half-heard, into the same category as Ned, he
worded it very tersely. Mahony, who had never given much heed to
Jerry&mdash;no one did&mdash;was pleased by his straightforward
air. Still, he did not know what could be done for him, and said
so.</p>

<p>Here Polly had an inspiration. "But I think I do. I remember Mr.
Ocock saying to me the other day he must take another boy into the
business, it was growing so&mdash;the fourth, this will make. I
don't know if he's suited yet, but even if he is, he may have heard
of something else.&mdash;Only you know, Jerry, you mustn't mind
<i>what</i> it is. After tea I'll put on my bonnet and go down to
the Flat with you. And Ned shall come, too," she added, with a
consoling glance at her elder brother: Ned had extended his huff to
his second slice of pie, which lay untouched on his plate.</p>

<p>"Somebody has always got something up her sleeve," said Mahony
affectionately, when Polly came to him in walking costume. "None
the less, wife, I shouldn't be surprised if those brothers of yours
gave us some trouble, before we're done with them."</p>

<h3><a name="ch-1-3-6" id="ch-1-3-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>In the weeks and months that followed, as he rode from one end
of Ballarat to the other&mdash;from Yuille's Swamp in the west, as
far east as the ranges and gullies of Little Bendigo&mdash;it
gradually became plain to Mahony that Ned's frothy tales had some
body in them after all. The character of the diggings was changing
before his very eyes. Nowadays, except on an outlying muddy flat or
in the hands of the retrograde Chinese, tubs, cradles, and
windlasses were rarely to be met with. Engine-sheds and
boiler-houses began to dot the ground; here and there a tall
chimney belched smoke, beside a lofty poppet-head or an aerial
trolley-line. The richest gutters were found to take their rise
below the basaltic deposits; the difficulties and risks of
rock-mining had now to be faced, and the capitalist, so long held
at bay, at length made free of the field. Large sums of money were
being subscribed; and, where these proved insufficient, the banks
stepped into the breach with subsidies on mortgages. The
population, in whose veins the gold-fever still burned, plunged by
wholesale into the new hazard; and under the wooden verandahs of
Bridge Street a motley crew of jobbers and brokers came into
existence, who would demonstrate to you, a la Ned, how you might
reap a fortune from a claim without putting in an hour's work on
it&mdash;without even knowing where it was.</p>

<p>A temptation, indeed!...but one that did not affect him. Mahony
let the reins droop on his horse's neck, and the animal picked its
way among the impedimenta of the bush road. It concerned only those
who had money to spare. Months, too, must go by before, from even
the most promising of these co-operative affairs, any return was to
be expected. As for him, there still came days when he had not a
five-pound note to his name. It had been a delusion to suppose
that, in accepting John's offer, he was leaving money-troubles
behind him. Despite Polly's thrift, their improved style of life
cost more than he had reckoned; the patients, slow to come, were
slower still to discharge their debts. Moreover, he had not guessed
how heavily the quarterly payments of interest would weigh on him.
With as good as no margin, with the fate of every shilling decided
beforehand, the saving up of thirty odd pounds four times a year
was a veritable achievement. He was always in a quake lest he
should not be able to get it together. No one suspected what near
shaves he had&mdash;not even Polly. The last time hardly bore
thinking about. At the eleventh hour he had unexpectedly found
himself several pounds short. He did not close an eye all night,
and got up in the morning as though for his own execution. Then,
fortune favoured him. A well-to-do butcher, his hearty: "What'll
yours be?" at the nearest public-house waved aside, had settled his
bill off-hand. Mahony could still feel the sudden lift of the black
fog-cloud that had enveloped him&mdash;the sense of bodily
exhaustion that had succeeded to the intolerable mental strain.</p>

<p>For the coming quarter-day he was better prepared&mdash;if, that
was, nothing out of the way happened. Of late he had been haunted
by the fear of illness. The long hours in the saddle did not suit
him. He ought to have a buggy, and a second horse. But there could
be no question of it in the meantime, or of a great deal else
besides. He wanted to buy Polly a piano, for instance; all her
friends had pianos; and she played and sang very prettily. She
needed more dresses and bonnets, too, than he was able to allow
her, as well as a change to the seaside in the summer heat. The
first spare money he had should go towards one or the other. He
loved to give Polly pleasure; never was such a contented little
soul as she. And well for him that it was so. To have had a
complaining, even an impatient wife at his side, just now, would
have been unbearable. But Polly did not know what impatience meant;
her sunny temper, her fixed resolve to make the best of everything
was not to be shaken.</p>

<p>Well, comforts galore should be hers some day, he hoped. The
practice was shaping satisfactorily. His attendance at Dandaloo had
proved a key to many doors: folk of the Glendinnings' and
Urquharts' standing could make a reputation or mar it as they
chose. It had got abroad, he knew, that at whatever hour of the day
or night he was sent for, he could be relied on to be sober; and
that unfortunately was not always the case with some of his
colleagues. In addition his fellow-practitioners showed signs of
waking up to his existence. He had been called in lately to a
couple of consultations; and the doyen of the profession on
Ballarat, old Munce himself, had praised his handling of a
difficult case of version.</p>

<p>The distances to be covered&mdash;that was what made the work
stiff. And he could not afford to neglect a single summons, no
matter where it led him. Still, he would not have grumbled, had
only the money not been so hard to get in. But the fifty thousand
odd souls on Ballarat formed, even yet, anything but a stable
population: a patient you attended one day might be gone the next,
and gone where no bill could reach him. Or he had been sold off at
public auction; or his wooden shanty had gone up in a
flare&mdash;hardly a night passed without a fire somewhere. In
these and like accidents the unfortunate doctor might whistle for
his fee. It seldom happened nowadays that he was paid in cash.
Money was growing as scarce here as anywhere else. Sometimes, it
was true, he might have pocketed his fee on the spot, had he cared
to ask for it. But the presenting of his palm professionally was a
gesture that was denied him. And this stand-offishness drove from
people's minds the thought that he might be in actual need of
money. Afterwards he sat at home and racked his brains how to pay
butcher and grocer. Others of the fraternity were by no means so
nice. He knew of some who would not stir a yard unless their fee
was planked down before them&mdash;old stagers these, who at one
time had been badly bitten and were now grown cynically
distrustful. Or tired. And indeed who could blame a man for
hesitating of a pitch-dark night in the winter rains, or on a
blazing summer day, whether or no he should set out on a
twenty-mile ride for which he might never see the ghost of a
remuneration?</p>

<p>Reflecting thus, Mahony caught at a couple of hard, spicy,
grey-green leaves, to chew as he went: the gums, on which the old
bark hung in ribbons, were in flower by now, and bore feathery
yellow blossoms side by side with nutty capsules. His horse had
been ambling forward unpressed. Now it laid its ears flat, and a
minute later its master's slower senses caught the clop-clop of a
second set of hoofs, the noise of wheels. Mahony had reached a
place where two roads joined, and saw a covered buggy approaching.
He drew rein and waited.</p>

<p>The occupant of the vehicle had wound the reins round the empty
lamp-bracket, and left it to the sagacity of his horse to keep the
familiar track, while he dozed, head on breast, in the corner. The
animal halted of itself on coming up with its fellow, and
Archdeacon Long opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, good-day to you, doctor!&mdash;Yes, as you see, enjoying a
little nap. I was out early."</p>

<p>He got down from the buggy and, with bent knees and his hands in
his pockets, stretched the creased cloth of his trousers, where
this had cut into his flesh. He was a big, brawny, handsome man,
with a massive nose, a cloven chin, and the most companionable
smile in the world. As he stood, he touched here a strap, there a
buckle on the harness of his chestnut&mdash;a well-known trotter,
with which he often made a match&mdash;and affectionately clapped
the neck of Mahony's bay. He could not keep his hands off a horse.
By choice he was his own stableman, and in earlier life had been a
dare-devil rider. Now, increasing weight led him to prefer buggy to
saddle; but his recklessness had not diminished. With the reins in
his left hand, he would run his light, two-wheeled trap up any
wooded, boulder-strewn hill and down the other side, just as in his
harum-scarum days he had set it at felled trees, and, if rumour
spoke true, wire-fences.</p>

<p>Mahony admired the splendid vitality of the man, as well as the
indestructible optimism that bore him triumphantly through all the
hardships of a colonial ministry. No sick bed was too remote for
Long, no sinner sunk too low to be helped to his feet. The leprous
Chinaman doomed to an unending isolation, the drunken Paddy, the
degraded white woman&mdash;each came in for a share of his
benevolence. He spent the greater part of his life visiting the
outcasts and outposts, beating up the unbaptised, the unconfirmed,
the unwed. But his church did not suffer. He had always some fresh
scheme for this on hand: either he was getting up a tea-meeting to
raise money for an organ; or a series of penny-readings towards
funds for a chancel; or he was training with his choir for a sacred
concert. There was a boyish streak in him, too. He would enter into
the joys of the annual Sunday-school picnic with a zest equal to
the children's own, leading the way, in shirt-sleeves, at leap-frog
and obstacle-race. In doctrine he struck a happy mean between
low-church practices and ritualism, preaching short, spirited
sermons to which even languid Christians could listen without
tedium; and on a week-day evening he would take a hand at a rubber
of whist or ecarte&mdash;and not for love&mdash;or play a sound
game of chess. A man, too, who, refusing to be bound by the letter
of the Thirty-nine Articles, extended his charity even to persons
of the Popish faith. In short, he was one of the few to whom Mahony
could speak of his own haphazard efforts at criticising the
Pentateuch.</p>

<p>The Archdeacon was wont to respond with his genial smile: "Ah,
it's all very well for you, doctor!&mdash;you're a free lance. I am
constrained by my cloth.&mdash;And frankly, for the rest of us,
that kind of thing's too&mdash;well, too disturbing. Especially
when we have nothing better to put in its place."</p>

<p>Doctor and parson&mdash;the latter, considerably over six feet,
made Mahony, who was tall enough, look short and doubly
slender&mdash;walked side by side for nearly a mile, flitting from
topic to topic: the rivalry that prevailed between Ballarats East
and West; the seditious uprising in India, where both had
relatives; the recent rains, the prospects for grazing. The last
theme brought them round to Dandaloo and its unhappy owner. The
Archdeacon expressed the outsider's surprise at the strength of
Glendinning's constitution, and the lively popular sympathy that
was felt for his wife.</p>

<p>"One's heart aches for the poor little lady, struggling to bear
up as though nothing were the matter. Between ourselves,
doctor"&mdash;and Mr. Long took off his straw hat to let the air
play round his head&mdash;"between ourselves, it's a thousand
pities he doesn't just pop off the hooks in one of his bouts. Or
that some of you medical gentlemen don't use your knowledge to help
things on."</p>

<p>He let out his great hearty laugh as he spoke, and his
companion's involuntary stiffening went unnoticed. But on Mahony
voicing his attitude with: "And his immortal soul, sir? Isn't it
the church's duty to hope for a miracle?...just as it is ours to
keep the vital spark going," he made haste to take the edge off his
words. "Now, now, doctor, only my fun! Our duty is, I trust, plain
to us both."</p>

<p>It was even easier to soothe than to ruffle Mahony. "Remember me
very kindly to Mrs. Long, will you?" he said as the Archdeacon
prepared to climb into his buggy. "But tell her, too, I owe her a
grudge just now. My wife's so lost in flannel and brown holland
that I can't get a word out of her."</p>

<p>"And mine doesn't know where she'd be, with this bazaar, if it
weren't for Mrs. Mahony." Long was husband to a dot of a woman who,
having borne him half a dozen children of his own feature and
build, now worked as parish clerk and district visitor rolled in
one; driving about in sunbonnet and gardening-gloves behind a pair
of cream ponies&mdash;tiny, sharp-featured, resolute; with little
of her husband's large tolerance, but an energy that outdid his
own, and made her an object of both fear and respect. "And that
reminds me: over at the cross-roads by Spring Hill, I met your
young brother-in-law. And he told me, if I ran across you to ask
you to hurry home. Your wife has some surprise or other in store
for you. No, nothing unpleasant! Rather the reverse, I believe. But
I wasn't to say more. Well, good-day, doctor, good-day to you!"</p>

<p>Mahony smiled, nodded and went on his way. Polly's surprises
were usually simple and transparent things: some one would have
made them a present of a sucking-pig or a bush-turkey, and Polly,
knowing his relish for a savoury morsel, did not wish it to be
overdone: she had sent similar chance calls out after him before
now.</p>

<p>When, having seen his horse rubbed down, he reached home, he
found her on the doorstep watching for him. She was flushed, and
her eyes had those peculiar high-lights in them which led him
jokingly to exhort her to caution: "Lest the sparks should set the
house on fire!"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, Pussy?" he inquired as he laid his bag down
and hung up his wide-awake. "What's my little surprise-monger got
up her sleeve to-day? Good Lord, Polly, I'm tired!"</p>

<p>Polly was smiling roguishly. "Aren't you going into the surgery,
Richard?" she asked, seeing him heading for the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Aha! So that's it," said he, and obediently turned the handle.
Polly had on occasion taken advantage of his absence to introduce
some new comfort or decoration in his room.</p>

<p>The blind had been let down. He was still blinking in the
half-dark when a figure sprang out from behind the door, barging
heavily against him, and a loud voice shouted: "Boh, you old
beef-brains! Boh to a goose!"</p>

<p>Displeased at such horseplay, Mahony stepped sharply
back&mdash;his first thought was of Ned having unexpectedly
returned from Mount Ararat. Then recognising the voice, he
exclaimed incredulously: "<i>You</i>, Dickybird? You!"</p>

<p>"Dick, old man...I say, Dick! Yes, it's me right enough, and not
my ghost. The old bad egg come back to roost!"</p>

<p>The blind was raised; and the friends, who had last met in the
dingy bush hut on the night of the Stockade, stood face to face.
And now ensued a babel of greeting, a quick fire of question and
answer, the two voices going in and out and round each other,
singly and together, like the voices in a duet. Tears rose to
Polly's eyes as she listened; it made her heart glow to see Richard
so glad. But when, forgetting her presence, Purdy cried: "And I
must confess, Dick...I took a kiss from Mrs. Polly. Gad, old man,
how she's come on!" Polly hastily retired to the kitchen.</p>

<p>At table the same high spirits prevailed: it did not often
happen that Richard was brought out of his shell like this, thought
Polly gratefully, and heaped her visitor's plate to the brim. His
first hunger stilled, Purdy fell to giving a slapdash account of
his experiences. He kept to no orderly sequence, but threw them out
just as they occurred to him: a rub with bushrangers in the Black
Forest, his adventures as a long-distance drover in the Mildura,
the trials of a week he had spent in a boiling-down establishment
on the Murray: "Where the stink wa so foul, you two, that I vomited
like a dog every day!" Under the force of this Odyssey husband and
wife gradually dropped into silence, which they broke only by
single words of astonishment and sympathy; while the child Trotty
spooned in her pudding without seeing it, her round, solemn eyes
fixed unblinkingly on this new uncle, who was like a wonderful
story-book come alive.</p>

<p>In Mahony's feelings for Purdy at this moment, there was none of
the old intolerant superiority. He had been dependent for so long
on a mere surface acquaintance with his fellows, that he now felt
to the full how precious the tie was that bound him to Purdy. Here
came one for whom he was not alone the reserved, struggling
practitioner, the rather moody man advancing to middle-age; but
also the Dick of his boyhood and early youth.</p>

<p>He had often imagined the satisfaction it would be to confide
his troubles to Purdy. Compared, however, with the hardships the
latter had undergone, these seemed of small importance; and dinner
passed without any allusion to his own affairs. And now the chances
of his speaking out were slight; he could have been entirely frank
only under the first stimulus of meeting.</p>

<p>Even when they rose from the table Purdy continued to hold the
stage. For he had turned up with hardly a shirt to his back, and
had to be rigged out afresh from Mahony's wardrobe. It was decided
that he should remain their guest in the meantime; also that Mahony
should call on his behalf on the Commissioner of Police, and put in
a good word for him. For Purdy had come back with the idea of
seeking a job in the Ballarat Mounted Force.</p>

<p>When Mahony could no longer put off starting on his afternoon
round, Purdy went with him to the livery-barn, limping briskly at
his side. On the way, he exclaimed aloud at the marvellous changes
that had taken place since he was last in the township. There were
half a dozen gas-lamps in Sturt Street by this time, the gas being
distilled from a mixture of oil and gum-leaves.</p>

<p>"One wouldn't credit it if one didn't see it with one's own
peepers!" he cried, repeatedly bringing up short before the
plate-glass windows of the shops, the many handsome, verandahed
hotels, the granite front of Christ Church. "And from what I hear,
Dick, now companies have jumped the claims and are deep-sinking in
earnest, fortunes'll be made like one o'clock."</p>

<p>But on getting home again, he sat down in front of Polly and
said, with a businesslike air: "And now tell me all about old Dick!
You know, Poll, he's such an odd fish; if he himself doesn't offer
to uncork, somehow one can't just pump him. And I want to know
everything that concerns him &mdash;from A to Z."</p>

<p>Polly could not hold out against this affectionate curiosity.
Entrenching her needle in its stuff, she put her work away and
complied. And soon to her own satisfaction. For the first time in
her married life she was led to discuss her husband's ways and
actions with another; and, to her amazement, she found that it was
easier to talk to Purdy about Richard than to Richard himself.
Purdy and she saw things in the same light; no rigmarole of
explanation was necessary. Now with Richard, it was not so. In
conversation with him, one constantly felt that he was not speaking
out, or, to put it more plainly, that he was going on meanwhile
with his own, very different thoughts. And behind what he did say,
there was sure to lurk some imaginary scruple, some rather
far-fetched delicacy of feeling which it was hard to get at, and
harder still to understand.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-1-3-7" id="ch-1-3-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>Summer had come round again, and the motionless white heat of
December lay heavy on the place. The low little houses seemed to
cower beneath it; and the smoke from their chimneys drew black,
perpendicular lines on the pale sky. If it was a misery at this
season to traverse the blazing, dusty roads, it was almost worse to
be within doors, where the thin wooden walls were powerless to keep
out the heat, and flies and mosquitoes raged in chorus.
Nevertheless, determined Christmas preparations went on in dozens
of tiny, zinc-roofed kitchens, the temperature of which was not
much below that of the ovens themselves; and kindly, well-to-do
people like Mrs. Glendinning and Mrs. Urquhart drove in in hooded
buggies, with green fly-veils dangling from their broad-brimmed
hats, and dropped a goose here, a turkey there, on their less
prosperous friends. They robbed their gardens, too, of the summer's
last flowers, arum-lilies and brilliant geraniums, to decorate the
Archdeacon's church for the festival; and many ladies spent the
whole day beforehand making wreaths and crosses, and festoons to
encircle the lamps.</p>

<p>No one was busier than Polly. She wanted to give Purdy, who had
been on short commons for so long, a special Christmas treat. She
had willing helpers in him and Jerry: the two of them chopped and
stoned and stirred, while she, seated on the block of the
woodstack, her head tied up in an old pillow-case, plucked and
singed the goose that had fallen to her share. Towards four o'clock
on Christmas Day they drew their chairs to the table, and with
loosened collars set about enjoying the good things. Or pretending
to enjoy them. This was Mahony's case; for the day was no holiday
for him, and his head ached from the sun. At tea-time Hempel
arrived to pay a call, looking very spruce in a long black coat and
white tie; and close on his heels followed old Mr. Ocock. The
latter, having deposited his hat under his seat and tapped several
pockets, produced a letter, which he unfolded and handed to Polly
with a broad grin. It was from his daughter, and contained the news
of his wife's death. "Died o' the grumbles, I lay you! An' the
first good turn she ever done me." The main point was that Miss
Amelia, now at liberty, was already taking advice about the safest
line of clipper-ships, and asking for a reply <i>by return</i> to a
number of extraordinary questions. Could one depend on hearing
God's Word preached of a Sunday? Was it customary for
<i>females</i> to go armed as well as men? Were the blacks
<i>converted</i>, and what amount of clothing did they wear?</p>

<p>"Thinks she's comin' to the back o' beyond, does Mely!" chuckled
the old man, and slapped his thigh at the sudden idea that occurred
to him of "takin' a rise out of 'er." "Won't she stare when she
gits 'ere, that's all!"</p>

<p>"Well, now you'll simply <i>have</i> to build," said Polly,
after threatening to write privately to Miss Amelia, to reassure
her. Why not move over west, and take up a piece of ground in the
same road as themselves? But from this he excused himself, with a
laugh and a spit, on the score that no land-sales had yet been held
in their neighbourhood: when he <i>did</i> turn out of his present
four walls, which had always been plenty good enough for him, he
wanted a place he could "fit up tidy"; which it 'ud stick in his
throat to do so, if he thought it might any day be sold over his
head. Mahony winced at this. Then laughed, with an exaggerated
carelessness. If, in a country like this, you waited for all to be
fixed and sure, you would wait till Domesday. None the less, the
thrust rankled. It was a fact that he himself had not spent a sou
on his premises since they finished building. The thought at the
back of <i>his</i> mind, too, was, why waste his hard-earned income
on improvements that might benefit only the next-comer? The yard
they sat in, for instance! Polly had her hens and a ramshackle
hen-house; but not a spadeful of earth had been turned towards the
wished-for garden. It was just the ordinary colonial backyard,
fenced round with rude palings which did not match, and were mended
here and there with bits of hoop-iron; its ground space littered
with a medley of articles for which there was no room elsewhere:
boards left lying by the builders, empty kerosene-tins, a couple of
tubs, a ragged cane-chair, some old cases. Wash-lines, on which at
the moment a row of stockings hung, stretched permanently from
corner to corner; and the whole was dominated by the big round
galvanised-iron tank.</p>

<p>On Boxing Day Purdy got the loan of a lorry and drove a large
party, including several children, comfortably placed on straw,
hassocks and low chairs, to the Races a few miles out. Half
Ballarat was making in the same direction; and whoever owned a
horse that was sound in the wind and anything of a stepper had
entered it for some item on the programme. The Grand Stand, a bark
shed open to the air on three sides, was resorted to only in the
case of a sudden downpour; the occupants of the dust-laden buggies,
wagonettes, brakes, carts and drays preferred to follow events
standing on their seats, and on the boards that served them as
seats. After the meeting, those who belonged to the
Urquhart-Glendinning set went on to Yarangobilly, and danced till
long pastmidnight on the broad verandah. It was nearly three
o'clock before Purdy brought his load safely home. Under the round
white moon, the lorry was strewn with the forms of sleeping
children.</p>

<p>Early next morning while Polly, still only half awake, was
pouring out coffee and giving Richard who, poor fellow, could not
afford to leave his patients, an account of their doings&mdash;with
certain omissions, of course: she did not mention the glaring
indiscretion Agnes Glendinning had been guilty of, in disappearing
with Mr. Henry Ocock into a dark shrubbery&mdash;while Polly
talked, the postman handed in two letters, which were of a nature
to put balls and races clean out of her head. The first was in Mrs.
Beamish's ill-formed hand, and told a sorrowful tale. Custom had
entirely gone: a new hotel had been erected on the new road;
Beamish was forced to declare himself a bankrupt; and in a few days
the Family Hotel, with all its contents, would be put up at public
auction. What was to become of them, God alone knew. She supposed
she would end her days in taking in washing, and the girls must go
out as servants. But she was sure Polly, now so up in the world,
with a husband doing so well, would not forget the old friends who
had once been so kind to her &mdash;with much more in the same
strain, which Polly skipped, in reading the letter aloud. The long
and short of it was: would Polly ask her husband to lend them a
couple of hundred pounds to make a fresh start with, or failing
that to put his name to a bill for the same amount?</p>

<p>"Of course she hasn't an idea we were obliged to borrow money
ourselves," said Polly in response to Mahony's ironic laugh. "I
couldn't tell them that."</p>

<p>"No...nor that it's a perpetual struggle to keep the wolf from
the door," answered her husband, battering in the top of an egg
with the back of his spoon.</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard dear, things aren't quite so bad as that," said
Polly cheerfully. Then she heaved a sigh. "I know, of course, we
can't afford to help them; but I <i>do</i> feel so sorry for
them"&mdash;she herself would have given the dress off her back.
"And I think, dear, if you didn't mind <i>very</i> much, we might
ask one of the girls up to stay with us...till the worst is
over."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose that wouldn't be impossible," said Mahony. "If
you've set your heart on it, my Polly. If, too, you can persuade
Master Purdy to forgo the comfort of your good feather-bed. And
I'll see if I can wring out a fiver for you to enclose in your
letter."</p>

<p>Polly jumped up and kissed him. "Purdy is going anyhow. He said
only last night he must look for lodgings near the Police Station."
Here a thought struck her; she coloured and smiled. "I'll ask Tilly
first," said she.</p>

<p>Mahony laughed and shook his finger at her. "The best laid plans
o' mice and men! And what's one to say to a match-maker who is
still growing out of her clothes?"</p>

<p>At this Polly clapped a hand over his mouth, for fear Ellen
should hear him. It was a sore point with her that she had more
than once of late had to lengthen her dresses.</p>

<p>As soon as she was alone she sat down to compose a reply to Mrs.
Beamish. It was no easy job: she was obliged to say that Richard
felt unable to come to their aid; and, at the same time, to avoid
touching on his private affairs; had to disappoint as kindly as she
could; to be truthful, yet tactful. Polly wrote, and re-wrote: the
business cost her the forenoon.</p>

<p>She could not even press Tilly to pack her box and come at once;
for her second letter that morning had been from Sara, who wrote
that, having decided to shake the dust of the colony off her feet,
she wished to pay them a flying visit before sailing, "<i>pour
faire mes adieux</i>." She signed herself "Your affectionate sister
Zara," and on her arrival explained that, tired of continually
instructing people in the pronunciation of her name, she had
decided to alter the spelling and be done with it. Moreover, a
little bird had whispered in her ear that, under its new form, it
fitted her rather "<i>French</i>" air and looks a thousand times
better than before.</p>

<p>Descending from the coach, Zara eyed Polly up and down and vowed
she would never have known her; and, on the way home, Polly more
than once felt her sister's gaze fixed critically on her. For her
part, she was able to assure Zara that she saw no change whatever
in her, since her last visit&mdash;even since the date of the
wedding. And this pleased Zara mightily; for as she admitted, in
removing hat and mantle, and passing the damped corner of a towel
over her face, she dreaded the ageing effects of the climate on her
fine complexion. Close as ever about her own concerns, she gave no
reason for her abrupt determination to leave the country; but from
subsequent talk Polly gathered that, for one thing, Zara had found
her position at the head of John's establishment&mdash;"Undertaken
in the first place, my dear, at immense personal sacrifice!"
&mdash;no sinecure. John had proved a regular martinet; he had
countermanded her orders, interfered about the household
bills&mdash;had even accused her of lining her own pocket. As for
little Johnny&mdash;the bait originally thrown out to induce her to
accept the post&mdash;he had long since been sent to
boarding-school. "A thoroughly bad, unprincipled boy!" was Zara's
verdict. And when Polly, big with pity, expostulated: "But Zara, he
is only six years old!" her sister retorted with a: "My dear, I
know the world, and you don't," to which Polly could think of no
reply.</p>

<p>Zara had announced herself for a bare fortnight's stay; but the
man who carried her trunk groaned and sweated under it, and was so
insolent about the size of the coin she dropped in his palm that
Polly followed him by stealth into the passage, to make it up to a
crown. As usual Zara was attired in the height of fashion. She
brought a set of "the hoops" with her&mdash;the first to be seen on
Ballarat&mdash;and once more Polly was torn between an honest
admiration of her sister's daring, and an equally honest
embarrassment at the notice she attracted. Zara swam and glided
about the streets, to the hilarious amazement of the population;
floated feather-light, billowing here, depressing there, with all
the waywardness of a child's balloon; supported&mdash;or so it
seemed&mdash;by two of the tiniest feet ever bestowed on mortal
woman. Aha! but that was one of the chief merits of "the hoops,"
declared Zara; that, and the possibility of getting still more
stuff into your skirts without materially increasing their weight.
There was something in that, conceded Polly, who often felt hers
drag heavy. Besides, as she reminded Richard that night, when he
lay alternately chuckling and snorting at woman's folly, custom was
everything. Once they had smiled at Zara appearing in a hat: "And
now we're all wearing them."</p>

<p>Another practical consideration that occurred to her she
expressed with some diffidence. "But Zara, don't you...I
mean...aren't they very draughty?"</p>

<p>Zara had to repeat her shocked but emphatic denial in the
presence of Mrs. Glendinning and Mrs. Urquhart, both ladies having
a mind to bring their wardrobes up to date. They agreed that there
was much to be said in favour of the appliance, over and above its
novelty. Especially would it be welcome at those times when...But
here the speakers dropped into woman's mysterious code of nods and
signs; while Zara, turning modestly away, pretended to count the
stitches in a crochet-antimacassar.</p>

<p>Yes, nowadays, as Mrs. Dr. Mahony, Polly was able to introduce
her sister to a society worthy of Zara's gifts; and Zara enjoyed
herself so well that, had her berth not been booked, she might have
contemplated extending her visit. She overflowed with gracious
commendation. The house&mdash;though, of course, compared with
John's splendour, a trifle plain and poky&mdash;was a decided
advance on the store; Polly herself much improved: "You <i>do</i>
look robust, my dear!" And&mdash;though Zara held her peace about
this&mdash;the fact of Mahony's being from home each day, for hours
at a stretch, lent an additional prop to her satisfaction. Under
these conditions it was possible to keep on good terms with her
brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Zara's natty appearance and sprightly ways made her a favourite
with every one especially the gentlemen. The episcopal bazaar came
off at this time; and Zara had the brilliant idea of a bran-pie.
This was the success of the entertainment. From behind the
refreshment-stall where, with Mrs. Long, she was pouring out cups
of tea and serving cheesecakes and sausage-rolls by the hundred,
Polly looked proudly across the beflagged hall, to the merry group
of which her sister was the centre. Zara was holding her own, even
with Mr. Henry Ocock; and Mr. Urquhart had constituted himself her
right hand.</p>

<p>"Your sister is no doubt a most fascinating woman," said Mrs.
Urquhart from the seat with which she had been accommodated; and
heaved a gentle sigh. "How odd that she should never have
married!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Zara's too particular," said Polly. "It's not for
want of being asked."</p>

<p>Her eyes met Purdy's as she spoke&mdash;Purdy had come up laden
with empty cups, a pair of infants' boots dangling round his
neck&mdash;and they exchanged smiles; for Zara's latest <i>affaire
du coeur</i> was a source of great amusement to them.</p>

<p>Polly had assisted at the first meeting between her sister and
Purdy with very mixed feelings. On that occasion Purdy happened to
be in plain clothes, and Zara pronounced him charming. The next
day, however, he dropped in clad in the double-breasted blue
jacket, the high boots and green-veiled cabbage-tree he wore when
on duty; and thereupon Zara's opinion of him sank to null, and was
not to be raised even by him presenting himself in full dress:
white-braided trousers, red faced shell jacket, pill-box cap,
cartouche box and cavalry sword. "La, Polly! Nothing but a common
policeman!" In vain did Polly explain the difference between a
member of the ordinary force and a mounted trooper of the
gold-escort; in vain lay stress on Richard's pleasure at seeing
Purdy buckle to steady work, no matter what. Zara's thoughts had
taken wing for a land where such anomalies were not; where you were
not asked to drink tea with the well-meaning constable who led you
across a crowded thoroughfare or turned on his bull's eye for you
in a fog, preparatory to calling up a hackney-cab.</p>

<p>But the chilly condescension with which, from now on, Zara
treated him did not seem to trouble Purdy. When he ran in for five
minutes of a morning, he eschewed the front entrance and took up
his perch on the kitchen-table. From here, while Polly cooked and
he nibbled half-baked pastry, the two of them followed the progress
of events in the parlour.</p>

<p>Zara's arrival on Ballarat had been the cue for Hempel's
reappearance, and now hardly a day went by on which the lay-helper
did not neglect his chapel work, in order to pay what Zara called
his "<i>devoirs</i>." Slight were his pretexts for coming: a rare
bit of dried seaweed for bookmark; a religious journal with a
turned-down page; a nosegay. And though Zara would not nowadays go
the length of walking out with a dissenter&mdash;she preferred on
her airings to occupy the box-seat of Mr. Urquhart's
four-in-hand&mdash;she had no objection to Hempel keeping her
company during the empty hours of the forenoon when Polly was lost
in domestic cares. She accepted his offerings, mimicked his faulty
speech, and was continually hauling him up the precipice of
self-distrust, only to let him slip back as soon as he reached the
top.</p>

<p>One day Purdy entered the kitchen doubled up with laughter. In
passing the front of the house he had thrown a look in at the
parlour-window; and the sight of the prim and proper Hempel on his
knees on the woolly hearthrug so tickled his sense of humour that,
having spluttered out the news, back he went to the passage, where
he crouched down before the parlour-door and glued his eye to the
keyhole.</p>

<p>"Oh, Purdy, no! What if the door should suddenly fly open?"</p>

<p>But there was something in Purdy's pranks that a laughter-lover
like Polly could never for long withstand. Here, now, in feigning
to imitate the unfortunate Hempel, he was sheerly irresistible. He
clapped his hands to his heart, showed the whites of his eyes,
wept, gesticulated and tore his hair; and Polly, after trying in
vain to keep a straight face, sat down and went off into a fit of
stifled mirth&mdash;and when Polly did give way, she was apt to set
every one round her laughing, too. Ellen's shoulders shook; she
held a fist to her mouth. Even little Trotty shrilled out her tinny
treble, without knowing in the least what the joke was.</p>

<p>When the merriment was at its height, the front door opened and
in walked Mahony. An instant's blank amazement, and he had grasped
the whole situation&mdash;Richard was always so fearfully quick at
understanding, thought Polly ruefully. Then, though Purdy jumped to
his feet and the laughter died out as if by command, he drew his
brows together, and without saying a word, stalked into the surgery
and shut the door.</p>

<p>Like a schoolboy who has been caned, Purdy dug his knuckles into
his eyes and rubbed his hindquarters&mdash;to the fresh delight of
Trotty and the girl.</p>

<p>"Well, so long, Polly! I'd better be making tracks. The old
man's on the warpath." And in an undertone: "Same old grouser!
Never <i>could</i> take a joke."</p>

<p>"He's tired. I'll make it all right," gave Polly back.</p>

<p>&mdash;"It was only his fun, Richard," she pleaded, as she held
out a linen jacket for her husband to slip his arms into.</p>

<p>"Fun of a kind I won't permit in my house. What an example to
set the child! What's more, I shall let Hempel know that he is
being made a butt of. And speak my mind to your sister about her
heartless behaviour."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't do that, Richard. I promise it shan't happen again.
It was very stupid of us, I know. But Purdy didn't really mean it
unkindly; and he <i>is</i> so comical when he starts to imitate
people." And Polly was all but off again, at the remembrance.</p>

<p>But Mahony, stooping to decipher the names Ellen had written on
the slate, did not unbend. It was not merely the vulgar joke that
had offended him. No, what really rankled was the sudden chill his
unlooked-for entrance had cast over the group; they had scattered
and gone scurrying about their business, like a pack of naughty
children who had been up to mischief behind their master's back. He
was the schoolmaster &mdash;the spoilsport. They were all afraid of
him. Even Polly.</p>

<p>But here came Polly herself to say: "Dinner, dear," in her
kindest tone. She also put her arm round his neck and hugged him.
"Not cross any more, Richard? I know we behaved disgracefully." Her
touch put the crown on her words. Mahony drew her to him and kissed
her.</p>

<p>But the true origin of the unpleasantness, Zara, who in her
ghoulish delight at seeing Hempel grovel before her&mdash;thus
Mahony worded it&mdash;behaved more kittenishly than ever at table:
Zara Mahony could not so easily forgive; and for the remainder of
her stay his manner to her was so forbidding that she, too, froze;
and to Polly's regret the old bad relation between them came up
anew.</p>

<p>But Zara was enjoying herself too well to cut her visit short on
Mahony's account. "Besides, poor thing," thought Polly, "she has
really nowhere to go." What she did do was to carry her head very
high in her brother-in-law's presence; to speak at him rather than
to him; and in private to insist to Polly on her powers of
discernment. "You may say what you like, my dear&mdash;I can see
you have a <i>very great deal</i> to put up with!"</p>

<p>At last, however, the day of her departure broke, and she went
off amid a babble of farewells, of requests for remembrance, a
fluttering of pocket-handkerchiefs, the like of which Polly had
never known; and to himself Mahony breathed the hope that they had
seen the last of Zara, her fripperies and affectations. "Your
sister will certainly fit better into the conditions of English
life."</p>

<p>Polly cried at the parting, which might be final; then blew her
nose and dried her eyes; for she had a busy day before her. Tilly
Beamish had been waiting with ill-concealed impatience for Zara to
vacate the spare room, and was to arrive that night.</p>

<p>Mahony was not at home to welcome the new-comer, nor could he be
present at high tea. When he returned, towards nine o'clock, he
found Polly with a very red face, and so full of fussy cares for
her guest's comfort&mdash;her natural kindliness distorted to
caricature&mdash;that she had not a word for him. One look at Miss
Tilly explained everything, and his respects duly paid he retired
to the surgery, to indulge a smile at Polly's expense. Here Polly
soon joined him, Tilly, fatigued by her journey and by her
bounteous meal, having betaken herself early to bed.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Mahony, not without a certain mischievous
satisfaction at his young wife's discomfiture. "And with the
prospect of a second edition to follow!"</p>

<p>But Polly would not capitulate right off. "I don't think it's
very kind of you to talk like that, Richard," she said warmly.
"People can't help their looks." She moved about the room putting
things straight, and avoiding his eye. "As long as they mean well
and are good...But I think you would rather no one ever came to
stay with us, at all."</p>

<p>Fixing her with meaning insistence and still smiling, Mahony
opened his arms. The next moment Polly was on his knee, her face
hidden in his shoulder. There she shed a few tears. "Oh, isn't she
dreadful? I don't know <i>what</i> I shall do with her. She's been
serving behind the bar, Richard, for more than a year. And she's
come expecting to be taken everywhere and to have any amount of
gaiety."</p>

<p>At coach-time she had dragged a reluctant Purdy to the office.
But as soon as he caught sight of Tilly: "On the box, Richard,
beside the driver, with her hair all towsy-wowsy in the
wind&mdash;he just said: 'Oh, lor, Polly!' and disappeared, and
that was the last I saw of him. I don't know how I should have got
on if it hadn't been for old Mr. Ocock, who was down meeting a
parcel. He was most kind; he helped us home with her carpet-bag,
and saw after her trunk. And, oh dear, what do you think? When he
was going away he said to me in the passage&mdash;so loud I'm sure
Tilly must have heard him&mdash;he said: 'Well! that's something
like a figure of a female this time, Mrs. Doc. As fine a young
woman as ever I see!'"</p>

<p>And Polly hid her face again; and husband and wife laughed in
concert.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-3-8" id="ch-1-3-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>That night a great storm rose. Mahony, sitting reading after
everyone else had retired, saw it coming, and lamp in hand went
round the house to secure hasps and catches; then stood at the
window to watch the storm's approach. In one half of the sky the
stars were still peacefully alight; the other was hidden by a dense
cloud, which came racing along like a giant bat with outspread
wings, devouring the stars in its flight. The storm broke; there
was a sudden shrill screeching, a grinding, piping, whistling, and
the wind hurled itself against the house as if to level it with the
ground; failing in this, it banged and battered, making windows and
doors shake like loose teeth in their sockets. Then it swept by to
wreak its fury elsewhere, and there was a grateful lull out of
which burst a peal of thunder. And now peal followed peal, and the
face of the sky, with its masses of swirling, frothy cloud,
resembled an angry sea. The lightning ripped it in fierce zigzags,
darting out hundreds of spectral fangs. It was a magnificent
sight.</p>

<p>Polly came running to see where he was, the child cried, Miss
Tilly opened her door by a hand's-breadth, and thrust a red, puffy
face, framed in curl-twists, through the crack. Nobody thought of
sleep while the commotion lasted, for fear of fire: once alight,
these exposed little wooden houses blazed up like heaps of
shavings. The clock-hands pointed to one before the storm showed
signs of abating. Now, the rain was pouring down, making an
ear-splitting din on the iron roof and leaping from every gutter
and spout. It had turned very cold. Mahony shivered as he got into
bed.</p>

<p>He seemed hardly to have closed an eye when he was wakened by a
loud knocking; at the same time the wire of the night-bell was
almost wrenched in two. He sat up and looked at his watch. It
wanted a few minutes to three; the rain was still falling in
torrents, the wind sighed and moaned. Wild horses should not drag
him out on such a night! Thrusting his arms into the sleeves of his
dressing-gown, he threw up the parlour window. "Who's there?" The
hiss of the rain cut his words through.</p>

<p>A figure on the doorstep turned at the sound. "Is this a
doctor's? I wuz sent here. Doctor! for God's sake..."</p>

<p>"What is it? Stop a minute! I'll open the door."</p>

<p>He did so, letting in a blast of wind and a rush of rain that
flooded the oilcloth. The intruder, off whom the water streamed,
had to shout to make himself audible.</p>

<p>"It's me&mdash;Mat Doyle's me name! It's me wife, doctor; she's
dying. I've bin all night on the road. Ah, for the love
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is it?" Mahony put his hand to the side of his mouth, to
keep his words from flying adrift in the wind.</p>

<p>"Paddy's Rest. You're the third I've bin to. Not one of the
dirty dogs'ull stir a leg! Me girl may die like a rabbit for all
they care."&mdash;The man's voice broke, as he halloed
particulars.</p>

<p>"Paddy's Rest? On a night like this? Why, the creek will be
out."</p>

<p>"Doctor! you're from th' ould country, I can hear it in your
lip. Haven't you a wife, too, doctor? Then show a bit o' mercy to
mine!"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, man, none of that!" said Mahony curtly. "You should
have bespoken me at the proper time to attend your
wife.&mdash;Besides, there'll be no getting along the road
to-night."</p>

<p>The other caught the note of yielding. "Sure an' you'd go out,
doctor dear, without thinkin', to save your dog if he was drownin'.
I've got me buggy down there; I'll take you safe. And you shan't
regret it; I'll make it worth your while, by the Lord Harry I
will!"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!"&mdash;Mahony opened the door of the surgery and struck
a match. It was a rough grizzled fellow&mdash;a "cocky," on his own
showing&mdash;who presented himself in the lamplight. His wife had
fallen ill that afternoon. At first everything seemed to be going
well; then she was seized with fits, had one fit after another, and
all but bit her tongue in two. There was nobody with her but a
young girl he had fetched from a mile away. He had meant, when her
time came, to bring her to the District Hospital. But they had been
taken unawares. While he waited he sat with his elbows on his
knees, his face between his clenched fists.</p>

<p>In dressing, Mahony reassured Polly, and instructed her what to
say to people who came inquiring after him; it was unlikely he
would be back before afternoon. Most of the patients could wait
till then. The one exception, a case of typhoid in its second week,
a young Scotch surgeon, Brace, whom he had obliged in a similar
emergency, would no doubt see for him&mdash;she should send Ellen
down with a note. And having poured Doyle out a nobbler and put a
flask in his own pocket, Mahony reopened the front door to the howl
of the wind.</p>

<p>The lantern his guide carried shed only a tiny circlet of light
on the blackness; and the two men picked their steps gingerly along
the flooded road. The rain ran in jets off the brim of Mahony's
hat, and down the back of his neck.</p>

<p>Having climbed into the buggy they advanced at a funeral pace,
leaving it to the sagacity of the horse to keep the track. At the
creek, sure enough, the water was out, the bridge gone. To reach
the next bridge, five miles off, a crazy cross-country drive would
have been necessary; and Mahony was for giving up the job. But
Doyle would not acknowledge defeat. He unharnessed the horse, set
Mahony on its back, and himself holding to its tail, forced the
beast, by dint of kicking and lashing, into the water; and not only
got them safely across, but up the steep sticky clay of the
opposite bank. It was six o'clock and a cloudless morning when,
numb with cold, his clothing clinging to him like wet seaweed,
Mahony entered the wooden hut where the real work he had come out
to do began.</p>

<p>Later in the day, clad in an odd collection of baggy garments,
he sat and warmed himself in the sun, which was fast drawing up in
the form of a blankety mist the moisture from the ground. He had
successfully performed, under the worst possible conditions, a
ticklish operation; and was now so tired that, with his chin on his
chest, he fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>Doyle wakened him by announcing the arrival of the buggy. The
good man, who had more than one nobbler during the morning could
not hold his tongue, but made still another wordy attempt to
express his gratitude. "Whither me girl lives or dies, it'll not be
Mat Doyle who forgits what you did for him this night, doctor! An'
if iver you want a bit o' work done, or some one to do your lyin'
awake at night for you, just you gimme the tip. I don't mind
tellin' you now, I'd me shootin'-iron here" &mdash;he touched his
right hip&mdash;"an' if you'd refused&mdash;you was the third, mind
you,&mdash;I'd have drilled you where you stood, God damn me if I
wouldn't!"</p>

<p>Mahony eyed the speaker with derision. "Much good that would
have done your wife, you fathead! Well, well, we'll say nothing to
<i>mine</i>, if you please, about anything of that sort."</p>

<p>"No, may all the saints bless 'er and give 'er health! An' as I
say, doctor..." In speaking he had drawn a roll of bank-notes from
his pocket, and now he tried to stuff them between Mahony's
fingers.</p>

<p>"What's this? My good man, keep your money till it's asked for!"
and Mahony unclasped his hands, so that the notes fluttered to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Then there let 'em lay!"</p>

<p>But when, in clothes dried stiff as cardboard, Mahony was
rolling townwards&mdash;his coachman, a lad of some ten or twelve
who handled the reins to the manner born&mdash;as they went he
chanced to feel in his coat pocket, and there found five ten-pound
notes rolled up in a neat bundle.</p>

<p>The main part of the road was dry and hard again; but all dips
and holes were wells of liquid mud, which bespattered the two of
them from top to toe as the buggy bumped carelessly in and out.
Mahony diverted himself by thinking of what he could give Polly
with this sum. It would serve to buy that pair of gilt cornices or
the heavy gilt-framed pierglass on which she had set her heart. He
could see her, pink with pleasure, expostulating: "Richard! What
<i>wicked</i> extravagance!" and hear himself reply: "And pray may
my wife not have as pretty a parlour as her neighbours?" He even
cast a thought, in passing, on the pianoforte with which Polly
longed to crown the furnishings of her room&mdash;though, of
course, at least treble this amount would be needed to cover its
cost.&mdash;But a fig for such nonsense! He knew but one legitimate
use to make of the unexpected little windfall, and that was, to put
it by for a rainy day. "At my age, in my position, I <i>ought</i>
to have fifty pounds in the bank!"&mdash;times without number he
had said this to himself, with a growing impatience. But he had not
yet managed to save a halfpenny. Thrive as the practice might, the
expenses of living held even pace with it. And now, having got its
cue, his brain started off again on the old treadmill, reckoning,
totting up, finding totals, or more often failing to find them,
till his head was as hot as his feet were cold. To-day he could not
think clearly at all.</p>

<p>Nor the next day either. By the time he reached home he was
conscious of feeling very ill: he had lancinating pains in his
limbs, a chill down his spine, an outrageous temperature. To set
out again on a round of visits was impossible. He had just to
tumble into bed.</p>

<p>He got between the sheets with that sense of utter well-being,
of almost sensual satisfaction, which only one who is shivering
with fever knows. And at first very small things were enough to
fill him with content: the smoothness of the pillow's sleek linen;
the shadowy light of the room after long days spent in the dusty
glare outside; the possibility of resting, the knowledge that it
was his duty to rest; Polly's soft, firm hands, which were always
of the right temperature&mdash;warm in the cold stage, cool when
the fever scorched him, and neither hot nor cold when the dripping
sweats came on. But as the fever declined, these slight pleasures
lost their hold. Then he was ridden to death by black thoughts. Not
only was day being added to day, he meanwhile not turning over a
penny; but ideas which he knew to be preposterous insinuated
themselves in his brain. Thus, for hours on end he writhed under
the belief that his present illness was due solely to the proximity
of the Great Swamp, and lay and cursed his folly in having chosen
just this neighbourhood to build in. Again, there was the case of
typhoid he had been anxious about, prior to his own breakdown:
under his <i>locum</i>, peritonitis had set in and carried off the
patient. At the time he had accepted the news from Polly's lips
with indifference&mdash;too ill to care. But a little later the
knowledge of what it meant broke over him, and he suffered the
tortures of the damned. Not Brace; he alone would be held
responsible for the death; and perhaps not altogether unjustly.
Lying there, a prey to morbid apprehensions, he rebuilt the case in
memory, struggling to recall each slight variation in temperature,
each swift change for better or worse; but as fast as he captured
one such detail, his drowsy brain let the last but one go, and he
had to beat it up anew. During the night he grew confident that the
relatives of the dead woman intended to take action against him,
for negligence or improper attendance.</p>

<p>An attempt to speak of these devilish imaginings to wife and
friend was a failure. He undertook it in a fit of desperation, when
it seemed as if only a strong and well grounded opposition would
save his reason. But this was just what he could not get. Purdy,
whom he tried first, held the crude notion that a sick person
should never be gainsaid; and soothingly sympathised and agreed,
till Mahony could have cried aloud at such blundering stupidity.
Polly did better; she contradicted him. But not in the right way.
She certainly pooh-poohed his idea of the nearness of Yuille's
Swamp making the house unhealthy; but she did not argue the matter,
step by step, and <i>convince</i> him that he was wrong. She just
laughed at him as at a foolish child, and kissed him, and tucked
him in anew. And when it came to the typhoid's fatal issue, she had
not the knowledge needed to combat him with any chance of success.
She heard him anxiously out, and allowed herself to be made quite
nervous over a possible fault on his part, so jealous was she for
his growing reputation.</p>

<p>So that in the end it was he who had to comfort her.</p>

<p>"Don't take any notice of what I say to-day, wife. It's this
blessed fever...I'm light-headed, I think."</p>

<p>But he could hear her uneasily consulting with Purdy in the
passage.</p>

<p>It was not till his pulse beat normally again that he could
smile at his exaggerated fears. Now, too, reviving health brought
back a wholesome interest in everyday affairs. He listened with
amusement to Polly's account of the shifts Purdy was reduced to, to
enter the house unseen by Miss Tilly. On his faithful daily call,
the young man would creep round by the back door, and Tilly was
growing more and more irate at her inability to waylay him. Yes,
Polly was rather redly forced to admit, she <i>had</i> abetted him
in his evasions. ("You know, Poll, I might just as well tie myself
up to old Mother B. herself and be done with it!") Out of sheer
pique Tilly had twice now accepted old Mr. Ocock's invitation to
drive with him. Once, she had returned with a huge bag of lollies;
and once, with a face like a turkey-cock. Polly couldn't help
thinking...no, really, Richard, she could not!...that perhaps
something might <i>come</i> of it. He should not laugh; just wait
and see.</p>

<p>Many inquiries had been made after him. People had missed their
doctor, it seemed, and wanted him back. It was a real red-letter
day when he could snap to the catches of his gloves again, and
mount the step of a buggy.</p>

<p>He had instructed Purdy to arrange for the hire of this vehicle,
saddle-work being out of the question for him in the meantime. And
on his first long journey&mdash;it led him past Doyle's hut, now,
he was sorry to see, in the hands of strangers; for the wife, on
the way to making a fair recovery, had got up too soon, overtaxed
her strength and died, and the broken-hearted husband was gone off
no one knew where&mdash;on this drive, as mile after mile slid from
under the wheels, Mahony felt how grateful was the screen of a hood
between him and the sun.</p>

<p>While he was laid up, the eternal question of how to live on his
income had left him, relatively speaking, in peace. He had of late
adopted the habit of doing his scraping and saving at the outset of
each quarter, so as to get the money due to Ocock put by betimes.
His illness had naturally made a hole in this; and now the living
from hand to mouth must begin anew.</p>

<p>With what remained of Doyle's money he proposed to settle his
account at the livery-stable. Then the unexpected happened. His
reappearance&mdash;he looked very thin and
washed-out&mdash;evidently jogged a couple of sleepy memories.
Simultaneously two big bills were paid, one of which he had
entirely given up. In consequence, he again found himself fifty
pounds to the good. And driving to Ocock's office, on term day, he
resolved to go on afterwards to the Bank of Australasia and there
deposit this sum.</p>

<p>Grindle, set off by a pair of flaming "sideboards," himself
ushered Mahony into the sanctum, and the affair was disposed of in
a trice. Ocock was one of the busiest of men nowadays&mdash;he no
longer needed to invent sham clients and fictitious
interviews&mdash;and he utilised the few odd minutes it took to
procure a signature, jot down a note, open a drawer, unlock a tin
box to remark abstractedly on the weather and put a polite inquiry:
"And your good lady? In the best of health, I trust?"</p>

<p>On emerging from the inner room, Mahony saw that the places
formerly filled by Tom and Johnny were occupied by strangers; and
he was wondering whether it would be indiscreet to ask what had
become of the brothers, when Ocock cut across his intention. "By
the way, Jenkins, has that memorandum I spoke of been drawn up?" he
turned to a clerk.</p>

<p>With a sheet of foolscap in his hand, he invited Mahony with a
beck of the chin to re-enter his room. "Half a moment! Now, doctor,
if you happen to have a little money lying idle, I can put you on
to a good thing&mdash;a very good thing indeed. I don't know, I'm
sure, whether you keep an eye on the fluctuations of the
share-market. If so, you'll no doubt have noticed the...let me say
the extreme instability of 'Porepunkahs.' After making an excellent
start, they have dropped till they are now to be had at
one-twentieth of their original value."</p>

<p>He did not take much interest in mining matters was Mahony's
reply. However he knew something of the claim in question, if only
because several of his acquaintances had abandoned their shares, in
disgust at the repeated calls and the lack of dividends.</p>

<p>"Exactly. Well now, doctor, I'm in a position to inform you that
'Porepunkahs' will very shortly be prime favourites on the market,
selling at many times their original figure&mdash;their
<i>original</i> figure, sir! No one with a few hundreds to spare
could find a better investment. Now is the time to buy."</p>

<p>A few hundreds!...what does he take me for? thought Mahony; and
declined the transaction off-hand. It was very good of Mr. Ocock to
think of him; but he preferred to keep clear of that kind of
thing.</p>

<p>"Quite so, quite so!" returned Ocock suavely, and dry-washed his
hands with the smile Mahony had never learnt to fathom. "Just as
you please, of course.&mdash;I'll only ask you, doctor, to treat
the matter as strictly confidential."</p>

<p>"I suppose he says the same to everyone he tells," was Mahony's
comment as he flicked up his horse; and he wondered what the extent
might be of the lawyer's personal interest in the "Porepunkah
Company." Probably the number of shareholders was not large enough
to rake up the capital.</p>

<p>Still, the incident gave him food for thought, and only after
closing time did he remember his intention of driving home by way
of the Bank.</p>

<p>Later in the day he came back on the incident, and pondered his
abrupt refusal of Ocock's offer. There was nothing unusual in this:
he never took advice well; and, was it forced upon him, nine times
out of ten a certain inborn contrariness drove him to do just the
opposite. Besides, he had not yet learned to look with lenience on
the rage for speculation that had seized the people of Ballarat;
and he held that it would be culpable for a man of his slender
means to risk money in the great game. &mdash;But was there any
hint of risk in the present instance? To judge from Ocock's manner,
the investment was as safe as a house, and lucrative to a degree
that made one's head swim. "Many times their original figure!" An
Arabian-nights fashion of growing rich, and no mistake! Very
different from the laborious grind of <i>his</i> days, in which he
had always to reckon with the chance of not being paid at all. That
very afternoon had brought him a fresh example of this. He was
returning from the Old Magpie Lead, where he had been called to a
case of scarlet fever, and saw himself covering the same road daily
for some time to come. But he had learned to adjudge his patients
in a winking; and these, he could swear to it, would prove to be
non-payers; of a kind even to cut and run, once the child was out
of danger. Was he really justified, cramped for money as he was, in
rejecting the straight tip Ocock had given him? And he debated this
moot point&mdash;argued his need against his principles &mdash;the
whole way home.</p>

<p>As soon as he had changed and seen his suspect clothing hung out
to air, he went impetuously back to Ocock's office. He had altered
his mind. A small gift from a grateful patient: yes, fifty, please;
they might bring him luck.&mdash;And he saw his name written down
as the owner of half a hundred shares.</p>

<p>After this, he took a new interest in the mining sheet of the
<i>Star</i>; turned to it, indeed, first of all. For a week, a
fortnight, "Porepunkahs" remained stationary; then they made a
call, and, if he did not wish to forfeit, he had to pay out as many
shillings as he held shares. A day or two later they sank a trifle,
and Mahony's hopes with them. There even came a day when they were
not mentioned; and he gave up his money for lost. But of a sudden
they woke to life again, took an upward bound, and within a month
were quoted at five pounds&mdash;on rumour alone. "Very sensitive
indeed," said the <i>Star</i>. Purdy, his only confidant, went
about swearing at himself for having let the few he owned lapse;
and Mahony itched to sell. He could now have banked two hundred and
fifty pounds.</p>

<p>But Ocock laughed him out of countenance&mdash;even went so far
as to pat him on the shoulder. On no account was he to think of
selling. "Sit tight, doctor...sit tight! Till I say the word."</p>

<p>And Mahony reluctantly obeyed.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-3-9" id="ch-1-3-9"></a>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>In the course of the following winter John Turnham came to stand
as one of two candidates for the newly proclaimed electoral
district of Ballarat West.</p>

<p>The first news his relatives had of his intention was gleaned
from the daily paper. Mahony lit on the paragraph by chance one
morning; said: "Hullo! Here's something that will interest you, my
dear," and read it aloud.</p>

<p>Polly laid down her knife and fork, pushed her plate from her,
and went pink with pleasure and surprise. "Richard! You don't mean
it!" she exclaimed, and got up to look over his shoulder. Yes,
there it was&mdash;John's name in all the glory of print. "Mr. John
Millibank Turnham, one of the foremost citizens and most highly
respected denizens of our marvellous metropolis, and a staunch
supporter of democratic rights and the interests of our people."
Polly drew a deep breath. "Do you know, Richard, I shouldn't wonder
if he came to live on Ballarat&mdash;I mean if he gets
in.&mdash;Does Trotty hear? This is Trotty's papa they're writing
about in the papers.&mdash;Of course we must ask him to stay with
us." For this happened during an interregnum, when the spare room
was temporarily out of use.</p>

<p>"Of course we must do nothing of the kind. Your brother will
need the best rooms Bath's can give him; and when he's not actually
on the hustings, he'll be hobnobbing in the bar, standing as many
drinks as there are throats in the crowd," gave back Mahony, who
had the lowest possible opinion of colonial politics.</p>

<p>"Well, at least I can write and tell him how delighted we are,"
said Polly, not to be done.</p>

<p>"Find out first, my dear, if there's any truth in the report. I
can hardly think John would have left us in the dark to this
extent."</p>

<p>But John corroborated the news; and, in the letter Polly read
out a week later, announced the opening of his campaign for the
coming month.</p>

<p>I SHALL FEEL MUCH OBLIGED TO YOUR HUSBAND IF HE WILL MEANWHILE
EXERT HIS INFLUENCE ON MY BEHALF. HE IS NO DOUBT ACQUAINTED
PROFESSIONALLY WITH MANY OF THE LEADING SQUATTERS ROUND BALLARAT,
WHOM HE CAN INDUCE TO SUPPORT MY CANDIDATURE.</p>

<p>"Umph!" said Mahony grumpily, and went on scooping out his egg.
"We're good enough to tout for him."</p>

<p>"Ssh!" warned Polly, with a glance at Trotty. "Think what it
means to him, Richard, and to us, too. It will do your practice
ever so much good if he gets in&mdash;to be the brother-in-law of
the member! We must help all we can, dear."</p>

<p>She was going driving to Yarangobilly that day with Archdeacon
Long to see a new arrival Richard had recently brought into the
world; and now she laid plans to kill two birds with one stone,
entering into the scheme with a gusto that astonished Mahony. "Upon
my word, wife, I believe you're glad to have something to do."</p>

<p>"Will my own papa gimme a dolly?...like Uncle Papa?" here piped
Trotty.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But you will have to be a <i>very</i> good girl, and
not talk with your mouth full or dirty your pinnies. Oh, here's a
postscript!" Polly had returned to the sheet, and was gloating over
it. "John writes:</p>

<p>"ESPECIALLY MUST HE ENDEAVOUR TO WIN LAWYER OCOCK OVER TO MY
SIDE. I LAY GREAT WEIGHT ON O.'S SUPPORT.</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, now <i>isn't</i> that unfortunate? I do hope it
won't make any difference to John's chances."</p>

<p>Polly's dismay had good grounds. A marked coolness had sprung up
between her husband and the lawyer; and on no account, she knew,
would Richard consent to approach Mr. Henry. Some very hot remarks
made by the latter had been passed on to her by Mrs. Glendinning.
She had not dared to tell Richard the worst.</p>

<p>The coolness dated from an afternoon when Tilly Beamish had
burst into the house in a state of rampant excitement. "Oh, Polly!
oh, I say! my dear, whatever do you think? That old cove&mdash;old
O.&mdash;'as actually had the cheek to make me a proposal."</p>

<p>"Tilly!" gasped Polly, and flushed to the roots of her hair.
"Oh, my dear, I <i>am</i> pleased!" For Polly's conscience was
still somewhat tender about the aid she had lent Purdy in his
evasions. The two women kissed, and Tilly cried a little. "It's
certainly her first offer," thought Mrs. Polly. Aloud, she asked
hesitatingly: "And do you...shall you...I mean, are you going to
accept him, Tilly?"</p>

<p>But this was just where Tilly could not make up her mind: should
she take him, or should she not? For two whole days she sat about
debating the question; and Polly listened to her with all the
sympathy and interest so momentous a step deserved.</p>

<p>"If you feel you could really learn to care for him, dear. Of
course it <i>would</i> be nice for you to have a house of your own.
And how happy it would make poor mother to see you settled!"</p>

<p>Tilly tore the last veil from her feelings, uttered gross
confidences. Polly knew well enough where her real inclination lay.
"I've hoped against hope, Poll, that a <i>certain person</i> would
come to the scratch at last." Yes, it was true enough, he had
nothing to offer her; but she wasn't the sort to have stuck at
that. "I'd have worked my hands to the bone for 'im, Poll, if 'e'd
<i>only</i> said the word." The one drawback to marriage with "you
know 'oo" would have been his infirmity. "Some'ow, Polly, I can't
picture myself dragging a husband with a gammy leg at my heels."
From this, Tilly's mind glanced back to the suitor who had
honourably declared himself. Of course "old O." hadn't a great deal
of the gentleman about him; and their ages were unsuitable. "'E
owns to fifty-eight, and as you know, Poll, I'm only just turned
twenty-five," at which Polly drooped her head a little lower over
the handkerchief she was hemming, to avoid meeting her friend's
eye. Poor dear Tilly! she would never see thirty again; and she
need hardly have troubled, thought Polly, to be insincere with her.
But in the same breath she took back the reproach. A woman herself,
she understood something of the fear, and shame, and heartburning
that had gone to the making of the lie. Perhaps, too, it was a
gentle hint from Tilly what age she now wished to be considered.
And so Polly agreed, and said tenderly: yes, certainly, the
difference was very marked. Meanwhile Tilly flowed on. These were
the two chief objections. On the other hand, the old boy was
ludicrously smitten; and she thought one might trust her, Tilly B.,
to soon knock him into shape. It would also, no doubt, be possible
to squeeze a few pounds out of him towards assisting "pa and ma" in
their present struggle. Again, as a married woman she would have a
chance of helping Jinny to find a husband: "Though Jinn's gone off
so, Polly, I bet you'd hardly know her if you met 'er in the
street." To end all, a bird in hand, etc.; and besides, what
prospects had she, if she remained a spinster?</p>

<p>So, when she was asked, Tilly accepted without further humming
and hawing an invitation to drive out in the smart dog-cart Mr.
Ocock had hired for the purpose; and Polly saw her off with many a
small private sign of encouragement. All went well. A couple of
hours later Tilly came flying in, caught Polly up in a bear's hug,
and danced her round the room. "My dear, wish me joy!&mdash;Oh,
lor, Polly, I <i>do</i> feel 'appy!" She was wearing a large
half-hoop of diamonds on her ring-finger: nothing would do "old O."
but that they should drive there and then to the finest jeweller's
in Sturt Street, where she had the pick of a trayful. And now Mr.
Ocock, all a-smirk with sheepish pride, was fetched in to receive
congratulations, and Polly produced refreshments; and healths were
drunk. Afterwards the happy couple dallied in the passage and
loitered on the doorstep, till evening was far advanced.</p>

<p>It was Polly who, in clearing away, was struck dumb by the
thought: "But now whatever is to become of Miss Amelia?"</p>

<p>She wondered if this consideration troubled the old man. Trouble
there was, of some sort: he called at the house three days running
for a word with Richard. He wore a brand-new pair of
shepherd's-plaid trousers, a choker that his work-stained hands had
soiled in tying, a black coat, a massive gold watch-chain. On the
third visit he was lucky enough to catch Mahony, and the door of
the surgery closed behind them.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Ocock sat on the extreme edge of a chair; alternately
crushed his wide-awake flat between his palms and expanded it
again, as though he were playing a concertina; and coughed out a
wordy preamble. He assured Mahony, to begin with, how highly he
esteemed him. It was because of this, because he knew doctor was as
straight as a pound of candles, that he was going to ask his advice
on an awkward matter&mdash;devilish awkward!&mdash;one nobody had
any idea of either&mdash;except Henry. And Henry had kicked up such
a deuce of a row at his wanting to marry again, that he was damned
if he'd have anything more to do with him. Besides, the doctor knew
what lawyers were&mdash;the whole breed of 'em! Sharp as
needles&mdash;especially Henry&mdash;but with a sort of squint in
their upper storey that made 'em see every mortal thing from the
point of view of law. And that was no good to him. What he needed
was a plain and honest, a...he hesitated for a word and repeated,
"a Honest opinion;" for he only wanted to do the right thing, what
was straight and above board. And at last out it came: did "doc."
think it would be acting on the square, and not taking a low-down
advantage of a female, if he omitted to mention to "the future Mrs.
O" that, up till six months back, he had been obliged to...well,
he'd spit it out short and say, obliged to report himself to the
authorities at fixed intervals? Women were such shy cattle, so
damned odd! You never knew how they'd take a thing like this. One
might raise Cain over it, another only laugh, another send him
packing. He didn't want to let a fine young woman like Matilda slip
if he could help it, by dad he didn't! But he felt he must either
win her by fair dealing or not at all. And having got the load off
his chest, the old colonist swallowed hard, and ran the back of his
hand over his forehead.</p>

<p>He had kept his eyes glued to the table-leg in speaking, and so
saw neither his hearer's involuntary start at the damaging
disclosure, nor the nervous tightening of the hand that lay along
the arm of the chair. Mahony sat silent, balancing a paper-knife,
and fighting down a feeling of extraordinary discomfort&mdash;his
very finger-tips curled under the strain. It was of little use to
remind himself that, ever since he had known him, Ocock had led a
decent, God-fearing life, respected both in his business relations
and by his brethren of the chapel. Nor could he spare more than a
glance in passing for those odd traits in the old man's character
which were now explained: his itch for public approval; his
unvarying harshness towards the pair of incorrigibles who weighed
him down. At this moment he discounted even the integrity that had
prompted the confession. His attitude of mind was one of: why the
deuce couldn't the old fool have held his tongue?</p>

<p>Oh, these unbidden, injudicious confidences! How they
complicated life! And as a doctor he was pestered with only too
many; he was continually being forced to see behind the scenes.
Now, outsiders, too, must needs choose him for the storehouse of
their privacies. Himself he never made a confidence; but it seemed
as though just this buttoned-upness on his part loosened people's
tongues. Blind to the flags of warning he hoisted in looks and
bearing, they innocently proceeded, as Ocock had done, to throw up
insurmountable barriers. He could hear a new tone in his own voice
when he replied, and was relieved to know the old man dull of
perception. For now Ocock had finished speaking, and sat perspiring
with anxiety to learn his fate. Mahony pulled himself together; he
could, in good faith, tender the advice to let the dead past bury
its dead. Whatever the original fault had been&mdash;no, no,
please!...and he raised an arresting hand&mdash;it was, he felt
sure, long since fully atoned. And Mr. Ocock had said a true word:
women were strange creatures. The revelation of his secret might
shipwreck his late-found happiness. It also, of course, might
not&mdash;and personally Mahony did not believe it would; for
Ocock's buisness throve like the green bay-tree, and Miss Tilly had
been promised a fine two-storeyed house, with bow-windows and a
garden, and a carriage-drive up to the door. Again, the admission
might be accepted in peace just now, and later on used as a weapon
against him. In his, Mahony's, eyes, by far the wisest course would
be, to let the grass grow over the whole affair.</p>

<p>And here he rose, abruptly terminating the interview. "You and
I, too, sir, if you please, will forget what has passed between us
this morning, and never come back on it. How is Tom getting on in
the drapery business? Does he like his billet?"</p>

<p>But none the less as he ushered his visitor out, he felt that
there was a certain finality about the action. It was&mdash;as far
as his private feelings were concerned&mdash;the old man's moral
exit from the scene.</p>

<p>On the doorstep Ocock hoped that nothing that had been said
would reach "your dear little lady." "To 'Enry, too, doc., if
you'll be so good, mum's the word! 'Enry 'ud never forgive me, nay,
or you eether, if it got to 'is 'ears I'd bin an' let the cat outer
the bag. An' 'e's got a bit of a down on you as it is, for it
'avin' bin your place I met the future Mrs. O. at."</p>

<p>"My good man!" broke from Mahony&mdash;and in this address,
which would previously never have crossed his lips, all his
sensations of the past hour were summed up. "Has your son Henry
the"&mdash;he checked himself; "does he suppose I&mdash;I or my
wife&mdash;had anything to do with it?"</p>

<p>He turned back to the surgery hot with annoyance. This, too! Not
enough that he must be put out of countenance by indiscreet
babbling; he must also get drawn into family squabbles, even be
held responsible for them: he who, brooking no interference in his
own life, demanded only that those about him should be as
intolerant as he.</p>

<p>It all came from Polly's indiscriminate hospitality. His house
was never his own. And now they had the prospect of John and his
electoral campaign before them. And John's chances of success, and
John's stump oratory, and the backstair-work other people were
expected to do for him would form the main theme of conversation
for many a day to come.</p>

<p>Mrs. Glendinning confirmed old Ocock's words.</p>

<p>She came to talk over the engagement with Polly, and sitting in
the parlour cried a little, and was sorry. But then "poor little
Agnes" cried so easily nowadays. Richard said her nerves had been
shattered by the terrible affair just before Christmas, when Mr.
Glendinning had tried first to kill her, and then to cut his own
throat.</p>

<p>Agnes said: "But I told Henry quite plainly, darling, that I
would not cease my visits to you on that account. It is both wrong
and foolish to think you or Dr. Mahony had anything to do with
it&mdash;and after the doctor was so kind, too, so <i>very</i>
kind, about getting poor Mr. Glendinning into the asylum. And so
you see, dear, Henry and I have had quite a disagreement"; and
Agnes cried again at the remembrance. "Of course, I can sympathise
with his point of view...Henry is so ambitious. All the same,
dearest, it's not quite so bad&mdash;is it?&mdash;as he makes out.
Matilda is certainly not very <i>comme il faut</i>&mdash;you'll
forgive my saying so, love, won't you? But I think she will suit
Henry's father in every way. No, the truth is, the old gentleman
has made a great deal of money, and we naturally expected it to
fall to Henry at his death; no one anticipated his marrying again.
Not that Henry really needs the money; he is getting on so well;
and I have...I shall have plenty, too, by and by. But you know,
love, what men are."</p>

<p>"Dearest Agnes!...don't fret about it. Mr. Henry thinks too much
of you, I'm sure, to be vexed with you for long. And when he looks
at it calmly, he'll see how unfair it is to make us responsible.
I'm like you, dear; I can't consider it a misfortune. Tilly is not
a lady; but she's a dear, warm-hearted girl and will make the old
man a good wife. I only hope though, Agnes, Mr. Henry won't say
anything to Richard. Richard is so touchy about things of that
sort."</p>

<p>The two women kissed, Polly with feelings of the tenderest
affection: the fact that, on behalf of their friendship, Agnes had
pitted her will against Mr. Henry's, endeared her to Polly as
nothing else could have done.</p>

<p>But when, vigilant as a mother-hen, she sought to prepare her
husband for a possible unpleasantness, she found him already
informed; and her well-meant words were like a match laid to his
suppressed indignation.</p>

<p>"In all my born days I never heard such impudence!"</p>

<p>He turned embarrassingly cool to Tilly. And Tilly, innocent of
offence and quite unskilled in deciphering subtleties, put this
sudden change of front down to jealousy, because she was going to
live in a grander house than he did. For the same reason he had
begun to turn up his nose at "Old O.," or she was very much
mistaken; and in vain did Polly strive to convince her that she was
in error. "I don't know anyone Richard has a higher opinion
of!"</p>

<p>But it was a very uncomfortable state of things; and when a
message arrived over the electric telegraph announcing the
dangerous illness of Mrs. Beamish, distressed though she was by the
news, Polly could not help heaving a tiny sigh of relief. For Tilly
was summoned back to Melbourne with all speed, if she wished to see
her mother alive.</p>

<p>They mingled their tears, Polly on her knees at the packing,
Tilly weeping whole-heartedly among the pillows of the bed.</p>

<p>"If it 'ad only been pa now, I shouldn't have felt it half so
much," and she blew her nose for the hundredth time. "Pa was always
such a rum old stick. But poor ma...when I <i>think</i> how she's
toiled and moiled 'er whole life long, to keep things going. She's
'ad all the pains and none of the pleasures; and now, just when I
was hoping to be able to give 'er a helping hand, <i>this</i> must
happen."</p>

<p>The one bright spot in Tilly's grief was that the journey would
be made in a private conveyance. Mr. Ocock had bought a smart gig
and was driving her down himself; driving past the foundations of
the new house, along the seventy odd miles of road, right up to the
door of the mean lodging in a Collingwood back street, where the
old Beamishes had hidden their heads. "If only she's able to look
out of the window and see me dash up in my own turn-out!" said
Tilly.</p>

<p>Polly fitted out a substantial luncheon-basket, and was keenest
sympathy to the last. But Mahony was a poor dissembler; and his
sudden thaw, as he assisted in the farewell preparations, could,
Polly feared, have been read aright by a child.</p>

<p>Tilly hugged Polly to her, and gave her kiss after kiss. "I
shall <i>never</i> forget 'ow kind you've been, Poll, and all
you've done for me. I've had my disappointments 'ere, as you know;
but p'raps after all it'll turn out to be for the best. One o' the
good sides to it anyhow is that you and me'll be next-door
neighbours, so to say, for the rest of our lives. And I'll hope to
see something of you, my dear, every blessed day. But you'll not
often catch me coming to this house, I can tell you that! For, if
you won't mind me saying so, Poll, I think you've got one of the
queerest sticks for a husband that ever walked this earth. Blows
hot one day and cold the next, for all the world like the wind in
spring. And without caring twopence whose corns 'e treads
on."&mdash;Which, thought Polly, was but a sorry return on Tilly's
part for Richard's hospitality. After all, it was his house she had
been a guest in.</p>

<p>Such were the wheels within wheels. And thus it came about that,
when the question rose of paving the way for John Turnham's
candidature, Mahony drew the line at approaching Henry Ocock.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-3-10" id="ch-1-3-10"></a>Chapter X</h3>

<p>John drove from Melbourne in a drag and four, accompanied by
numerous friends and well-wishers. A mile or so out of Ballarat, he
was met by a body of supporters headed by a brass band, and
escorted in triumph to the George Hotel. Here, the horses having
been led away, John at once took the field by mounting the box-seat
of the coach and addressing the crowd of idlers that had gathered
round to watch the arrival. He got an excellent hearing&mdash;so
Jerry reported, who was an eye and ear-witness of the
scene&mdash;and was afterwards borne shoulder-high into the
hotel.</p>

<p>With Jerry at his heels, Mahony called at the hotel that
evening. He found John entertaining a large impromptu party. The
table of the public dining-room was disorderly with the remains of
a liberal meal; napkins lay crushed and flung down among plates
piled high with empty nutshells; the cloth was wine-stained, and
bestrewn with ashes and breadcrumbs, the air heady with the fumes
of tobacco. Those of the guests who still lingered at the table had
pushed their chairs back or askew, and sat, some a-straddle, some
even with their feet on the cloth. John was confabbing with half a
dozen black-coats in a corner. Each held a wineglass in his hand
from which he sipped, while John, legs apart, did all the talking,
every now and then putting out his forefinger to prod one of his
hearers on the middle button of the waistcoat. It was some time
before he discovered the presence of his relatives; and Mahony had
leisure to admire the fashion in which, this corner-talk over, John
dispersed himself among the company; drinking with this one and
that; glibly answering questions; patting a glum-faced brewer on
the back; and simultaneously checking over, with an oily-haired
agent, his committee-meetings for the following days. His customary
arrogance and pompousness of manner were laid aside. For the nonce,
he was a simple man among men.</p>

<p>Then espying them, he hurried over, and rubbing his hands with
pleasure said warmly: "My dear Mahony, this is indeed kind! Jerry,
my lad, how do, how do? Still growing, I see! We'll make a fine
fellow of you yet.&mdash;Well, doctor!...we've every reason, I
think, to feel satisfied with the lie of the land."</p>

<p>But here he was snatched from them by an urgent request for a
pronouncement&mdash;"A quite informal word, sir, if you'll be so
good,"&mdash;on the vexed question of vote by ballot. And this
being a pet theme of John's, and a principle he was ready to defend
through thick and thin, he willingly complied.</p>

<p>Mahony had no further talk with him. The speech over&mdash;it
was a concise and spirited utterance, and, if you were prepared to
admit the efficacy of the ballot, convincing enough&mdash;Mahony
quietly withdrew. He had to see a patient at eleven. Polly, too,
would probably be lying awake for news of her brother.</p>

<p>As he threw back his braces and wound up his watch, he felt it
incumbent on him to warn her not to pitch her hopes too high. "You
mustn't expect, my dear, that your brother's arrival will mean much
to us. He is now a public man, and will have little time for small
people like ourselves. I'm bound to admit, Polly, I was very
favourably impressed by the few words I heard him say," he
added.</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, I'm <i>so</i> glad!" and Polly, who had been
sitting on the edge of the bed, stood on tiptoe to give him a
kiss.</p>

<p>As Mahony predicted, John's private feelings went down before
the superior interests of his campaign. Three days passed before he
found time to pay his sister a visit; and Polly, who had postponed
a washing, baked her richest cakes and pastries, and clad Trotty in
her Sunday best each day of the three: Polly was putting a good
face on the matter, and consoling herself with Jerry's descriptions
of John's triumphs. How she wished she could hear some of the
speechifying! But Richard would never consent; and electioneering
did certainly seem, from what Jerry said, a very rough-and-ready
business&mdash;nothing for ladies. Hence her delight knew no bounds
when John drove up unexpectedly late one afternoon, between a hard
day's personal canvassing and another of the innumerable dinners he
had to eat his way through. Tossing the reins to the gentleman who
sat next him, he jumped out of the wagonette&mdash;it was hung with
placards of "Vote for Turnham!"&mdash;and gave a loud rat-a-tat at
the door.</p>

<p>Forgetting in her excitement that this was Ellen's job, Polly
opened to him herself, and drew him in. "John! How pleased I am to
see you!"</p>

<p>"My dear girl, how are you? God bless me, how you've altered! I
should never have known you." He held her at arm's length, to
consider her.</p>

<p>"But you haven't changed in the least, John. Except to grow
younger.&mdash;Richard, here's John at last!&mdash;and Trotty,
John...here's Trotty!&mdash;Take your thumb out of your mouth,
naughty girl!&mdash;She's been watching for you all day, John, with
her nose to the window." And Polly pushed forward the scarlet,
shrinking child.</p>

<p>John's heartiness suffered a distinct check as his eyes lit on
Trotty, who stood stiff as a bit of Dresden china in her bunchy
starched petticoats. "Come here, Emma, and let me look at you."
Taking the fat little chin between thumb and first finger, he
turned the child's face up and kept it so, till the red button of a
mouth trembled, and the great blue eyes all but ran over. "H'm!
Yes...a notable resemblance to her mother. Ah, time passes, Polly
my dear&mdash;time passes!" He sighed. &mdash;"I hope you mind your
aunt, Emma, and are properly grateful to her?"</p>

<p>Abruptly quitting his hold, he swept the parlour with a glance.
"A very snug little place you have here, upon my word!"</p>

<p>While Polly, with Trotty pattering after, bustled to the larder,
Mahony congratulated his brother-in-law on the more favourable
attitude towards his election policy which was becoming evident in
the local press. John's persuasive tongue was clearly having its
effect, and the hostility he had met with at the outset of his
candidature was yielding to more friendly feelings on all sides.
John was frankly gratified by the change, and did not hesitate to
say so. When the wine arrived they drank to his success, and
Polly's delicacies met with their due share of praise. Then, having
wiped his mouth on a large silk handkerchief, John disclosed the
business object of his call. He wanted specific information about
the more influential of their friends and acquaintances; and here
he drew a list of names from his pocket-book. Mahony, his chin
propped on the flaxen head of the child, whom he nursed, soon fell
out of the running for Polly proved far the cleverer at grasping
the nature of the information John sought, and at retailing it. And
John complimented her on her shrewdness, ticked off names, took
notes on what she told him; and when he was not writing sat tapping
his thick, carnation-red underlip, and nodding assent. It was
arranged that Polly should drive out with him next day to
Yarangobilly, by way of Dandaloo; while for the evening after they
plotted a card-party, at which John might come to grips with
Archdeacon Long. John expected to find the reverend gentleman a
hard nut to crack, their views on the subject of a state aid to
religion being diametrically opposed. Polly thought a substantial
donation to the chancel-fund might smooth things over, while for
John to display a personal interest in Mrs. Long's charities would
help still more. Then there were the Ococks. The old man could be
counted on, she believed; but John might have some difficulty with
Mr. Henry&mdash;and here she initiated her brother into the
domestic differences which had split up the Ocock family, and
prevented Richard from approaching the lawyer. John, who was in his
most democratic mood, was humorous at the expense of Henry, and
declared the latter should rather wish his father joy of coming to
such a fine, bouncing young wife in his old age. The best way of
getting at Mr. Henry, Polly considered, would be for Mrs
Glendinning to give a luncheon or a bushing-party, with the lawyer
among the guests: "Then you and I, John, could drive out and join
them&mdash;either by chance or invitation, as you think best."
Polly was heart and soul in the affair.</p>

<p>But business over, she put several straight questions about the
boy, little Johnny&mdash;Polly still blamed herself for having
meekly submitted to the child's removal from her charge&mdash;and
was not to be fobbed off with evasions. The unfavourable verdict
she managed to worm out of John: "Incorrigible, my dear
Polly&mdash;utterly incorrigible! His masters report him idle,
disobedient, a bad influence on the other scholars," she met
staunchly with: "Perhaps it has something to do with the school.
Why not try another? Johnny had his good qualities; in many ways
was quite a lovable child."</p>

<p>For the first time Mahony saw his wife and her eldest brother
together and he could not but be struck by Polly's attitude.
Greatly as she admired and reverenced John, there was not a
particle of obsequiousness in her manner, nor any truckling to his
point of view; and she plainly felt nothing of the peculiar sense
of discomfort that invariably attacked him, in John's presence.
Either she was not conscious of her brother's grossly patronising
air, or, aware of it, did not resent it, John having always been so
much her superior in age and position. Or was it indeed the truth
that John did not try to patronise Polly? That his overbearing
nature recognised in hers a certain springy resistance, which was
not to be crushed? In other words, that, in a Turnham, Turnham
blood met its match.</p>

<p>John re-took his seat in the front of the wagonette, Trotty was
lifted up to see the rosettes and streamers adorning the horses,
the gentlemen waved their hats, and off they went again at a fine
pace, and with a whip-cracking that brought the neighbours to their
windows.</p>

<p>Polly had pink cheeks with it all, and even sought to excuse the
meagre interest John had shown in his daughter. "Trotty was only a
baby in arms when he saw her last. Besides, I think she reminded
him too much of her dear mother. For I'm sure, though he doesn't
let it be seen, John still feels his loss."</p>

<p>"I wonder!" said Mahony slowly and with a strong downward
inflection, as he turned indoors.</p>

<p>On the eve of the polling Polly had the honour of accompanying
her brother to a performance at the Theatre Royal. A ticket came
for Richard, too; but, as usual, he was at the last moment called
out. So Purdy took her on his arm and escorted her&mdash;not
exactly comfortably; for, said Polly, no one who had not tried it,
knew how hard it was to walk arm-in-arm with a lame person,
especially if you did not want to hurt his feelings&mdash;Purdy
took her to the theatre, helped her to unmuffle and to change her
boots, and bore her company till her brother arrived. They had
seats in the centre of the front row of the dress circle; all eyes
were turned on them as they entered; and Polly's appearance was the
subject of audible and embarrassing comment.</p>

<p>In every interval John was up and away, to shake a hand here,
pass the time of day there; and watching him with affectionate
pride, Polly wondered how Richard could ever have termed him
"high-handed and difficult." John had the knack, it seemed to her,
of getting on with people of every class, and of always finding the
right word to say. But as the evening advanced his seat remained
empty even while the curtain was up, and she was glad when, between
the fourth and fifth acts, her husband at last appeared.</p>

<p>On his way to her Mahony ran into his brother-in-law, and John
buttonholed him to discuss with him the prospects of the morrow. As
they talked, their eyes rested on Polly's glossy black chignon; on
the nape of her white neck; on the beautiful, rounded young
shoulders which, in obedience to the fashion, stood right out of
her blue silk bodice. Mahony shifted his weight uneasily from one
foot to the other. He could not imagine Polly enjoying her exposed
position, and disapproved strongly of John having left her. But for
all answer to the hint he threw out John said slowly, and with a
somewhat unctuous relish: "My sister has turned into a remarkably
handsome woman!"&mdash;words which sent the lightning-thought
through Mahony that, had Polly remained the insignificant little
slip of a thing of earlier days, she would not have been asked to
fill the prominent place she did this evening.</p>

<p>John sent his adieux and excuses to Polly. He had done what was
expected of him, in showing himself at a public entertainment, and
a vast mass of correspondence lay unsorted on his desk. So Mahony
moved forward alone.</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, there you are! Oh dear, what you've missed! I
never thought there could be such acting." And Polly turned her
great dark eyes on her husband; they were moist from the noble
sentiments of <i>the true Briton</i>.</p>

<p>The day of the election broke, a gusty spring day cut up by
stinging hail-showers, which beat like fusillades on the galvanised
iron roofs. Between the showers, the sun shone in a gentian-blue
sky, against which the little wooden houses showed up crassly
white. Ballarat made holiday. Early as Mahony left home, he met a
long line of conveyances heading townwards&mdash;spring carts,
dogcarts, double and single buggies, in some of which, built to
seat two only, five or six persons were huddled. These and similar
vehicles drew up in rows outside the public-houses, where the lean,
long-legged colonial horses stood jerking at their tethers; and
they were still there, still jerking, when he passed again toward
evening. On a huge poster the "Unicorn" offered to lunch free all
those "thinking men" who registered their vote for "the one and
only true democrat, the miners' friend and tyrants' foe, John
Turnham."</p>

<p>In the hope of avoiding a crush Mahony drove straight to the
polling-booth. But already all the loafers and roughs in the place
seemed to be congregated round the entrance, after the polite
custom of the country to chivy, or boo, or huzza those who went in.
In waiting his turn, he had to listen to comments on his dress and
person, to put up with vulgar allusions to blue pills and black
draughts.</p>

<p>Just as he was getting back into his buggy John rode up, flanked
by a bodyguard of friends; John was galloping from booth to booth,
to verify progress and put the thumbscrew on wobblers. He
beamed&mdash;as well he might. He was certain to be one of the two
members elected, and quite likely to top the poll by a respectable
majority.</p>

<p>For once Mahony did not grumble at his outlying patients; was
only too thankful to turn his back on the town. It was pandemonium.
Bands of music, one shriller and more discordant than the next,
marched up and down the main streets&mdash;from the fifes and drums
of the Fire Brigade, to the kerosene-tins and penny-whistles of
mere determined noise-makers. Straggling processions, with banners
that bore the distorted features of one or other of the candidates,
made driving difficult; and, to add to the confusion, the
schoolchildren were let loose, to overrun the place and fly
advertisement balloons round every corner.&mdash;And so it went on
till far into the night, the dark hours being varied by torchlight
processions, fireworks, free fights and orgies of drunkenness.</p>

<p>The results of the polling were promised for two o'clock the
following day.</p>

<p>When, something after this hour Mahony reached home, he found
Polly and the gentle, ox-eyed Jinny Beamish, who was the present
occupant of the spare room, pacing up and down before the house.
According to Jerry news might be expected now at any minute. And
when he had lunched and changed his coat, Mahony, bitten by the
general excitement, made his way down to the junction of Sturt
Street and the Flat.</p>

<p>A great crowd blocked the approaches to the hustings. Here were
the four candidates, who, in attending the issue, strove to look
decently unconcerned. John had struck a quasi-Napoleonic attitude:
his right elbow propped in the cup of his left hand, he held his
drooped chin between thumb and forefinger, leaving it to his
glancing black eyes to reveal how entirely alive he was to the
gravity of the moment. Standing on the fringe of the crowd, Mahony
listened to the piebald jokes and rude wit with which the people
beguiled the interim; and tried to endure with equanimity the
jostling, the profane language and offensive odours, by which he
was assailed. Half an hour elapsed before the returning officer
climbed the ladder at the back of the platform, and came forward to
announce the result of the voting: Mr. John Millibank Turnham
topped the poll with a majority of four hundred and fifty-two. The
crowd, which at sight of the clerk had abruptly ceased its fooling,
drowned his further statements in a roar of mingled cheers and
boos. The cheers had it; hats were tossed into the air, and loud
cries for a speech arose. John's advance to grip the railing led to
a fresh outburst, in which the weakening opposition was quashed by
the singing of: "When Johnny comes marching home!" and "Cheer,
boys, cheer, For home and mother country!"&mdash;an incongruity of
sentiment that made Mahony smile. And John, having repeatedly bowed
his thanks from side to side, joined in and sang with the rest.</p>

<p>The opening of his speech was inaudible to Mahony. Just behind
him stood one of his brother-in-law's most arrant opponents, a
butcher by trade, and directly John began to hold forth this man
produced a cornet-a-piston and started to blow it. In vain did
Mahony expostulate: he seemed to have got into a very wasps'-nest
of hostility; for the player's friends took up the cudgels and
baited him in a language he would have been sorry to imitate, the
butcher blaring away unmoved, with the fierce solemnity of face the
cornet demands. Mahony lost his temper; his tormentors retaliated;
and for a moment it looked as though there would be trouble. Then a
number of John's supporters, enraged by the bellowing of the
instrument, bore down and forcibly removed the musician and his
clique, Mahony along with them.</p>

<p>Having indignantly explained, and shaken coat and collar to
rights, he returned to his place on the edge of the crowd. The
speaker's deep voice had gone steadily on during the disturbance.
Indeed John might have been born to the hustings. Interruptions did
not put him out; he was brilliant at repartee; and all the stock
gestures of the public speaker came at his call: the pounding of
the bowl of one hand with the closed fist of the other; the
dramatic wave of the arm with which he plumbed the depths or
invited defiance; the jaunty standing-at-ease, arms akimbo; the
earnest bend from the waist when he took his hearers into his
confidence. At this moment he was gripping the rail of the platform
as though he intended to vault it, and asserting: "Our first cry,
then, is for men to people the country; our next, for independence,
to work out our own salvation. Yes, my friends, the glorious future
of this young and prosperous colony, which was once and most
auspiciously known as Australia Felix&mdash;blest, thrice-blest
Australia!&mdash;rests with ourselves alone. We who inhabit here
can best judge of her requirements, and we refuse to see her
hampered in her progress by the shackles of an ancient tradition.
What suits our hoary mother-country&mdash;God bless and keep her
and keep us loyal to her!&mdash;is but dry husks for us. England
knows nothing of our most pressing needs. I ask you to consider
how, previous to 1855, that pretty pair of mandarins, Lord John
Russell and Earl Grey, boggled and botched the crucial question of
unlocking the lands even yet, gentlemen, the result of their
muddling lies heavy on us. And the Land Question, though first in
importance, is but one, as you know, of many"&mdash;and here John,
playing on the tips of five wide-stretched fingers, counted them
off. He wound up with a flaming plea for the creation and
protection of purely national industries. "For what, I would ask
you, is the true meaning of democracy in a country such as ours?
What is, for us, the democratic principle? The answer, my friends,
is conservatism; yes, I repeat it&mdash;conservatism!"...and thus
to a final peroration.</p>

<p>In the braying and hurrahing that followed&mdash;the din was
heightened by some worthy mounting a barrel to move that "this yere
Johnny Turnham" was not a fit person to represent "the
constitooency," by the barrel being dragged from under him, and the
speaker rolled in the mud; while this went on Mahony stood silent,
and he was still standing meditatively pulling his whiskers when a
sudden call for a doctor reached his ear. He pushed his way to the
front.</p>

<p>How the accident happened no one knew. John had descended from
the platform to a verandah, where countless hands were stretched
out to shake his. A pile of shutters was leaning against the wall,
and in some unexplained fashion these had fallen, striking John a
blow that knocked him down. When Mahony got to him he was on his
feet again, wiping a drop of blood from his left temple. He looked
pale, but pooh-poohed injury or the idea of interfering with his
audience's design; and Mahony saw him shouldered and borne off.</p>

<p>That evening there was a lengthy banquet, in which all the
notables of the place took part. Mahony's seat was some way off
John's; he had to lean forward, did he wish to see his
brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Towards eleven o'clock, just as he was wondering if he could
slip out unobserved, a hand was laid on his arm. John stood behind
him, white to the lips. "Can I have a word with you upstairs?"</p>

<p>Here he confessed to a knife-like pain in his left side; the
brunt of the blow, it seemed, had met him slantways between rib and
hip. A cursory examination made Mahony look grave.</p>

<p>"You must come back with me, John, and let me see to you
properly."</p>

<p>Having expressed the chief guest's regrets to the company, he
ordered a horse and trap, and helping John into it drove him home.
And that night John lay in their bed, letting out the groans he had
suppressed during the evening; while Polly snatched forty winks
beside Jinny Beamish, and Mahony got what sleep he could on the
parlour sofa.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-3-11" id="ch-1-3-11"></a>Chapter XI</h3>

<p>There for some weeks John was a prisoner, with a fractured rib
encased in strips of plaster. "In your element again, old girl!"
Mahony chaffed his wife, when he met her bearing invalid trays.</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't all fall on me, Richard. Jinny's a great
help&mdash;sitting with John and keeping him company."</p>

<p>Mahony could see it for himself. Oftenest when he entered the
room it was Jinny's black-robed figure&mdash;she was in mourning
for her parents; for Mrs. Beamish had sunk under the twofold strain
of failure and disgrace, and the day after her death it had been
necessary to cut old Beamish down from a nail&mdash;oftenest it was
Jinny he found sitting behind a curtain of the tester-bed, watching
while John slept, ready to read to him or to listen to his talk
when he awoke. This service set Polly free to devote herself to the
extra cooking; and John was content. "A most modest and unassuming
young woman," ran his verdict on Jinny.</p>

<p>Polly reported it to her husband in high glee. "Who could ever
have believed two sisters would turn out so differently? Tilly to
get so...so...well, you know what I mean...and Jinny to improve as
she has done. Have you noticed, Richard, she hardly
ever&mdash;really quite seldom now&mdash;drops an h? It must all
have been due to Tilly serving in that low bar."</p>

<p>By the time John was so far recovered as to exchange bed for
sofa, it had come to be exclusively Jinny who carried in to him the
dainties Polly prepared&mdash;the wife as usual was content to do
the dirty work! John declared Miss Jinny had the foot of a fay;
also that his meals tasted best at her hands. Jinny even succeeded
in making Trotty fond of her; and the love of the fat, shy child
was not readily won. Entering the parlour one evening Mahony
surprised quite a family scene: John, stretched on the sofa, was
stringing cats'-cradles, Jinny sat beside him with Trotty on her
knee.</p>

<p>On the whole, though, the child did not warm to her father.</p>

<p>"Aunty, kin dat man take me away f'om you?"</p>

<p>"That man? Why, Trotty darling, he's your father!" said Polly,
shocked.</p>

<p>"Kin 'e take me away f'om you and Uncle Papa?"</p>

<p>"He could if he wanted to. But I'm sure he doesn't," answered
her aunt, deftly turning a well-rolled sheet of pastry.</p>

<p>And righting her dolly, which she had been dragging upside down,
Trotty let slip her fears with the sovereign ease of childhood.</p>

<p>From the kitchen Polly could hear the boom of John's deep bass:
it made nothing of the lath-and-plaster walls. Of course, shut up
as he was, he had to talk to somebody, poor fellow; and Richard was
too busy to spare him more than half an hour of an evening. Jinny
was a good listener. Through the crack of the door, Polly could see
her sitting humbly drinking in John's words, and even looking
rather pretty, in her fair, full womanliness.</p>

<p>"Oh, Polly!" she burst out one day, after being held thus
spellbound. "Oh, my dear, what a splendid man your brother is! I
feel sometimes I could sink through the floor with shame at my
ignorance, when 'e talks to me so."</p>

<p>But as time went on Mahony noticed that his wife grew decidedly
thoughtful; and if John continued to sing Jinny's praises, he heard
nothing more of it. He had an acute suspicion what troubled Polly;
but did not try to force her confidence.</p>

<p>Then one afternoon, on his getting home, she came into the
surgery looking very perturbed, and could hardly find words to
break a certain piece of news to him. It appeared that not an hour
previously, Jinny, flushed and tearful, had lain on her neck,
confessing her feelings for John and hinting at the belief that
they were returned.</p>

<p>"Well, I think you might have been prepared for something of
this sort, Polly," he said with a shrug, when he had heard her out.
"Convalescence is notoriously dangerous for fanning the
affections."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I never <i>dreamt</i> of such a thing, Richard! Jinny
is a dear good girl and all that, but she is <i>not</i> John's
equal. And that he can even <i>think</i> of putting her in poor
Emma's place!&mdash;What shall I say to him?"</p>

<p>"Say nothing at all. Your brother John is not the man to put up
with interference."</p>

<p>"He longs so for a real home again, Polly darling," said Jinny,
wiping her eyes. "And <i>how</i> 'appy it will make me to fulfil
'is wish! Don't let me feel unwelcome and an intruder, dear. I know
I'm not nearly good enough for 'im, and 'e could 'ave had the
choice of ever such handsome women. But 'e 'as promised to be
patient with me, and to teach me everything I ought to know."</p>

<p>Polly's dismay at the turn of events yielded to a womanly
sympathy with her friend. "It's just like poor little Agnes and Mr.
Henry over again," was her private thought. For she could not
picture John stooping to guide and instruct.</p>

<p>But she had been touched on a tender spot&mdash;that of
ambitious pride for those related to her&mdash;and she made what
Mahony called "a real Turnham attempt" to stand up to John. Against
her husband's express advice.</p>

<p>"For if your brother chooses to contract a mesalliance of this
kind, it's nobody's business but his own. Upon my word though,
Polly, if you don't take care, this house will get a bad name over
the matches that are made in it. You had better have your spare
room boarded up, my dear."</p>

<p>Mahony was feeling particularly rasped by John's hoity-toity
behaviour in this connection. Having been nursed back to health,
John went about with his chin in the air, and hardly condescended
to allude to his engagement&mdash;let alone talk it over with his
relatives. So Mahony retired into himself&mdash;after all, the
world of John's mind was so dissimilar to his own that he did not
even care to know what went on in it. "The fellow has been caught
on the hop by a buxom form and a languishing eye," was how he
dismissed the matter in thought.</p>

<p>"I raise my wife to my own station, Mary. And you will greatly
oblige me by showing Jane every possible attention," was the only
satisfaction Polly could get from John, made in his driest
tone.</p>

<p>Before the engagement was a week old Tilly reappeared&mdash;she
was to be married from their house on the hither side of Christmas.
At first she was too full of herself and her own affairs to let
either Polly or Jinny get a word in. Just to think of it! That old
cabbage-grower, Devine, had gone and bought the block of land next
the one Mr. O. was building on. She'd lay a bet he would put up a
house the dead spit of theirs. Did ever anyone hear such cheek?</p>

<p>At the news that was broken to her, the first time she paused
for breath, she let herself heavily down on a chair.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed!" was all she could ejaculate.
"Blowed!...that's what I am."</p>

<p>But afterwards, when Jinny had left the room, she gave free play
to a very real envy and regret. "In all my life I never did! Jinn
to be Mrs. John!...and, as like as not, the Honourable Mrs. John
before she's done. Oh, Polly, my dear, why <i>ever</i> didn't I
wait!"</p>

<p>On being presented to John, however, she became more reconciled
to her lot. "'E's got a temper, your brother has, or I'm very much
mistaken. It won't be all beer and skittles for 'er ladyship. For
Jinn hasn't a scrap of spunk in 'er, Polly. She got so mopey the
last year or two, there was no doing anything with 'er. Now it was
just the other way round with me. No matter how black things
looked, I always kept my pecker up. Poor ma used to say I grew more
like her, every day."</p>

<p>And at a still later date: "No, Polly, my dear, I wouldn't
change places with the future Mrs. T. after all, thank
you&mdash;not for Joseph! I <i>say!</i> she'll need to mind her p's
and q's." For Tilly had listened to John explaining to Jinny what
he expected of her, what she might and might not do; and had
watched Jinny sitting meekly by and saying yes to everything.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the way of the marriage; indeed, did it not
take place immediately, Jinny would have to look about her for a
situation of some kind; and, said John, that was nothing for
<i>his</i> wife. His house stood empty; he was very much in love;
and pressed for the naming of the day. So it was decided that Polly
should accompany Jinny to lodgings in Melbourne, help her choose
her trousseau and engage servants. Afterwards there would be a
quiet wedding&mdash;by reason of Jinny's mourning&mdash;at which
Richard, if he could possibly contrive to leave his patients, would
give the bride away. Polly was to remain in John's house while the
happy couple were on honeymoon, to look after the servants. This
arrangement would also make the break less hard for the child.
Trotty was still blissfully unconscious of what had befallen her.
She had learnt to say "new mamma" parrot-wise, without
understanding what the words meant. And meanwhile, the fact that
she was to go with her aunt for a long, exciting coach-ride filled
her childish cup with happiness. As Polly packed the little
clothes, she thought of the night, six years before, when the fat,
sleeping babe had been laid in her arms.</p>

<p>"Of course it's only natural John should want his family round
him again. But I <i>shall</i> miss the dear little soul," she said
to her husband who stood watching her.</p>

<p>"What you need is a little one of your own, wife."</p>

<p>"Ah, don't I wish I had!" said Polly, and drew a sigh. "That
would make up for everything. Still if it can't be, it can't."</p>

<p>A few days before the set time John received an urgent summons
to Melbourne, and went on ahead, leaving Mahony suspecting him of a
dodge to avoid travelling <i>en famille</i>. In order that his
bride-elect should not be put to inconvenience, John hired four
seats for the three of them; but: "He might just as well have saved
his money," thought Polly, when she saw the coach. Despite their
protests they were packed like herrings in a barrel&mdash;had
hardly enough room to use their hands. Altogether it was a trying
journey. Jinny, worked on by excitement and fatigue, took a fit of
hysterics; Trotty, frightened by the many rough strangers, cried
and had to be nursed; and the whole burden of the undertaking lay
on Polly's shoulders. She had felt rather timid about it, before
starting; but was obliged to confess she got on better than she
expected. A kind old man sitting opposite, for instance&mdash;a
splitter he said he was&mdash;actually undid Jinny's
bonnet-strings, and fetched water for her at the first
stoppage.</p>

<p>Polly had not been in Melbourne since the year after her
marriage, and was looking forward intensely to the visit. She went
laden with commissions; her lady-friends gave her a list as long as
her arm. Richard, too, had entrusted her to get him second-hand
editions of various medical works, as well as a new stethoscope.
Thirdly, she had promised old Mr. Ocock to go to William's Town to
meet Miss Amelia, who even now was tossing somewhere on the Indian
Ocean, and to escort the poor young lady up to Ballarat.</p>

<p>Having seen them start, Mahony went home to drink his coffee and
read his paper in a quiet that was new to him. John's departure had
already eased the strain. Then Tilly had been boarded out at the
Methodist minister's. Now, with the exit of Polly and her charges,
a great peace descended on the little house. The rooms lay white
and still in the sun, and though all doors stood open, there was
not a sound to be heard but the buzzing of the blowflies round the
sweets of the flytraps. He was free to look as glum as he chose of
a morning if he had neuralgia; or to be silent when worried over a
troublesome case. No longer would Miss Tilly's bulky presence and
loud-voiced reiterations of her prospects grate his nerves; or
John's full-blooded absorption in himself, and poor foolish Jinny's
quavering doubts whether she would ever be able to live up to so
magnificent a husband, offend his sense of decorum.</p>

<p>Another reason he was glad to see the last of them was that, in
the long run, he had rebelled at the barefaced way they made use of
Polly, and took advantage of her good nature. She had not only
cooked for them and waited on them; he had even caught her
stitching garments for the helpless Jinny. This was too much: such
extreme obligingness on his wife's part seemed to detract from her
personal dignity. He could never though have got Polly to see it.
Undignified to do a kindness? What a funny, selfish idea! The fact
was, there was a certain streak in Polly's nature that made her
more akin to all these good people than to him&mdash;him with his
unsociable leanings towards a hermit's cell; his genuine need of an
occasional hour's privacy and silence, in which to think a few
thoughts through to the end.</p>

<p>On coming in from his rounds he turned out an old linen jacket
that belonged to his bachelor days, and raked up some books he had
not opened for an almost equally long time. He also steered clear
of friends and acquaintances, went nowhere, saw no one but his
patients. And Ellen, to whose cookery Polly had left him with many
misgivings, took things easy. "He's so busy reading, he never knows
what he puts in his mouth. I believe he'd eat his boot-soles, if I
fried 'em up neat wid a bit of parsley," she reported over the back
fence on Doctor's odd ways.</p>

<p>During the winter months the practice had as usual fallen off.
By now it was generally beginning to look up again; but this year,
for some reason, the slackness persisted. He saw how lean his purse
was, whenever he had to take a banknote from it to enclose to
Polly; there was literally nothing doing, no money coming in. Then,
he would restlessly lay his book aside, and drawing a slip of paper
to him set to reckoning and dividing. Not for the first time he
found himself in the doctor's awkward quandary: how to be decently
and humanly glad of a rise in the health-rate.</p>

<p>He had often regretted having held to the half-hundred shares he
had bought at Henry Ocock's suggestion; had often spent in fancy
the sum they would have brought in, had he sold when they touched
their highest figure. Such a chance would hardly come his way
again. After the one fictitious flare-up, "Porepunkahs" had fallen
heavily&mdash;the first main prospect-drive, at a depth of three
hundred and fifty feet, had failed to strike the gutter&mdash;and
nowadays they were not even quoted. Thus had ended his single
attempt to take a hand in the great game.</p>

<p>One morning he sat at breakfast, and thought over his weekly
epistle to Polly. In general, this chronicled items of merely
personal interest. The house had not yet been burnt down&mdash;her
constant fear, when absent; another doctor had got the Asylum; he
himself stood a chance of being elected to the Committee of the
District Hospital. To-day, however, there was more to tell. The
English mail had come in, and the table was strewn with foreign
envelopes and journals. Besides the usual letters from relatives,
one in a queer, illiterate hand had reached him, the address
scrawled in purple ink on the cheapest note-paper. Opening it with
some curiosity, Mahony found that it was from his former assistant,
Long Jim.</p>

<p>The old man wrote in a dismal strain. Everything had gone
against him. His wife had died, he was out of work and penniless,
and racked with rheumatism&mdash;oh, it was "a crewl climat"! Did
he stop in England, only "the house" remained to him; he'd end in a
pauper's grave. But he believed if he could get back to a scrap of
warmth and the sun, he'd be good for some years yet. Now he'd
always known Dr. Mahony for the kindest, most liberal of gentlemen;
the happiest days of his life had been spent under him, on the
Flat; and if he'd only give him a lift now, there was nothing he
wouldn't do to show his gratitude. Doctor knew a bit about him,
too. Here, he couldn't seem to get on with folk at all. They looked
crooked at him, and just because he'd once been spunky enough to
try his luck overseas. Mahony pshawed and smiled; then wondered
what Polly would say to this letter. She it was who had been
responsible for packing the old man off.</p>

<p>Unfolding the <i>Star</i>, he ran his eye over its columns. He
had garnered the chief local news and was skimming the mining
intelligence, when he suddenly stopped short with an exclamation of
surprise; and his grip on the paper tightened. There it stood,
black on white. "Porepunkahs" had jumped to three pounds per share!
What the dickens did that mean? He turned back to the front sheet,
to find if any clue to the claim's renewed activity had escaped
him; but sought in vain. So bolting the rest of his breakfast, he
hurried down to the town, to see if, on the spot, he could pick up
information with regard to the mysterious rise.</p>

<p>The next few days kept him in a twitter of excitement.
"Porepunkahs" went on advancing&mdash;not by leaps and bounds as
before, but slowly and steadily&mdash;and threw off a dividend. He
got into bed at night with a hot head, from wondering whether he
ought to hold on or sell out; and inside a week he was off to
consult the one person who was in a position to advise him. Henry
Ocock's greeting resembled an embrace&mdash;"It evidently means a
fortune for him"&mdash;and all trifling personal differences were
forgotten in the wider common bond. The lawyer virtually ordered
Mahony to "sit in", till he gave the word. By this time
"Porepunkahs" had passed their previous limit, and even paid a
bonus: it was now an open secret that a drive undertaken in an
opposite direction to the first had proved successful; the lead was
scored and seamed with gold. Ocock spoke of the stone, specimens of
which he had held in his hand&mdash;declared he had never seen its
equal.</p>

<p>But when the shares stood at fifty-three pounds each, Mahony
could restrain himself no longer; and, in spite of Ocock's belief
that another ten days would see a <i>coup</i>, he parted with
forty-five of the half hundred he held. Leaving the odd money with
the lawyer for re-investment, he walked out of the office the
possessor of two thousand pounds.</p>

<p>It was only a very ordinary late spring day; the season brought
its like by the score: a pale azure sky, against which the distant
hills looked purple; above these a narrow belt of cloud, touched,
in its curves, to the same hue. But to Mahony it seemed as if such
a perfect day had never dawned since he first set foot in
Australia. His back was eased of its burden; and, like Christian on
having passed the wall known as Salvation, he could have wept tears
of joy. After all these years of pinching and sparing he was out of
poverty's grip. The suddenness of the thing was what staggered him.
He might have drudged till his hair was grey; it was unlikely he
would ever, at one stroke, have come into possession of a sum like
this.&mdash;And that whole day he went about feeling a little more
than human, and seeing people, places, things, through a kind of
beatific mist. Now, thank God, he could stand on his own legs
again; could relieve John of his bond, pay off the mortgage on the
house, insure his life before it was too late. And, everything
done, he would still have over a thousand pounds to his credit. A
thousand pounds! No longer need he thankfully accept any and every
call; or reckon sourly that, if the leakage on the roof was to be
mended, he must go without a new surtout. Best of all, he could now
begin in earnest to save.</p>

<p>First, though, he allowed himself two very special pleasures. He
sent Polly a message on the electric telegraph to say that he would
come down himself to fetch her home. In secret he planned a little
trip to Schnapper Point. At the time of John's wedding he had been
unable to get free; this would be the first holiday he and Polly
had ever had together.</p>

<p>The second thing he did was: to indulge the love of giving that
was innate in him; and of giving in a somewhat lordly way. He
enjoyed the broad grin that illumined Ellen's face at his
unlooked-for generosity; Jerry's red stammered thanks for the gift
of the cob the boy had long coveted. It did him good to put two
ten-pound notes in an envelope and inscribe Ned's name on it; he
had never yet been able to do anything for these poor lads. He
also, without waiting to consult Polly&mdash;fearing, indeed, that
she might advise against it&mdash;sent off the money to Long Jim
for the outward voyage, and a few pounds over. For there were
superstitious depths in him; and, at this turn in his fortunes, it
would surely be of ill omen to refuse the first appeal for help
that reached him.</p>

<p>Polly was so much a part of himself that he thought of her last
of all. But then it was with moist eyes. She, who had never
complained, should of a surety not come short! And he dropped
asleep that night to the happy refrain: "Now she shall have her
piano, God bless her!...the best that money can buy."</p>

<h3><a name="ch-1-4-1" id="ch-1-4-1"></a>Chapter I</h3>

<p>The new house stood in Webster Street. It was twice as large as
the old one, had a garden back and front, a verandah round three
sides. When Mahony bought it, and the piece of ground it stood on,
it was an unpretentious weather-board in a rather dilapidated
condition. The situation was good though&mdash;without being too
far from his former address&mdash;and there was stabling for a pair
of horses. And by the time he had finished with it, it was one of
those characteristically Australian houses which, added to wherever
feasible, without a thought for symmetry or design&mdash;a room
built on here, a covered passage there, a bathroom thrown out in an
unexpected corner, with odd steps up and down&mdash;have yet a
spacious, straggling comfort all their own.</p>

<p>How glad he was to leave the tiny, sunbaked box that till now
had been his home. It had had neither blind nor shutter; and, on
his entering it of a summer midday, it had sometimes struck hotter
than outside. The windows of his new room were fitted with green
venetians; round the verandah-posts twined respectively a banksia
and a Japanese honey-suckle, which further damped the glare; while
on the patch of buffalo-grass in front stood a spreading fig-tree,
that leafed well and threw a fine shade. He had also added a sofa
to his equipment. Now, when he came in tired or with a headache, he
could stretch himself at full length. He was lying on it at this
moment.</p>

<p>Polly, too, had reason to feel satisfied with the change. A
handsome little Broadwood, with a ruby-silk and carved-wood front,
stood against the wall of her drawing-room; gilt cornices
surmounted the windows; and from the centre of the ceiling hung a
lustre-chandelier that was the envy of every one who saw it: Mrs.
Henry Ocock's was not a patch on it, and yet had cost more. This
time Mahony had virtually been able to give his wife a free hand in
her furnishing. And in her new spare room she could put up no less
than three guests!</p>

<p>Of course, these luxuries had not all rained on them at once.
Several months passed before Polly, on the threshold of her
parlour, could exclaim, with an artlessness that touched her
husband deeply: "Never in my life did I think I should have such a
beautiful room!" Still, as regarded money, the whole year had been
a steady ascent. The nest-egg he had left with the lawyer had
served its purpose of chaining that old hen, Fortune, to the spot.
Ocock had invested and re-invested on his behalf&mdash;now it was
twenty "Koh-i-noors," now thirty "Consolidated Beehives"&mdash;and
Mahony was continually being agreeably surprised by the margins it
threw off in its metamorphoses. That came of his having placed the
matter in such competent hands. The lawyer had, for instance, got
him finally out of "Porepunkahs" in the nick of time&mdash;the reef
had not proved as open to the day as was expected&mdash;and pulled
him off, in the process, another three hundred odd. Compared with
Ocock's own takings, of course, his was a modest spoil; the lawyer
had made a fortune, and was now one of the wealthiest men in
Ballarat. He had built not only new and handsome offices on the
crest of the hill, but also, prior to his marriage, a fine
dwelling-house standing in extensive grounds on the farther side of
Yuille's Swamp. Altogether it had been a year of great and sweeping
changes. People had gone up, gone down&mdash;had changed places
like children at a game of General Post. More than one of Mahony's
acquaintances had burnt his fingers. On the other hand, old Devine,
Polly's one-time market-gardener, had made his thousands. There was
actually talk of his standing for Parliament, in which case his
wife bid fair to be received at Government House. And the pair of
them with hardly an "h" between them!</p>

<p>From the sofa where he lay, Mahony could hear the murmur of his
wife's even voice. Polly sat the further end of the verandah
talking to Jinny, who dandled her babe in a rocking-chair that made
a light tip-tap as it went to and fro. Jinny said nothing: she was
no doubt sunk in adoration of her&mdash;or rather
John's&mdash;infant; and Mahony all but dozed off, under the full,
round tones he knew so well.</p>

<p>In his case the saying had once more been verified: to him that
hath shall be given. Whether it was due to the better position of
the new house; or to the fact that easier circumstances gave people
more leisure to think of their ailments; or merely that money
attracted money: whatever the cause, his practice had of late made
giant strides. He was in demand for consultations; sat on several
committees; while a couple of lodges had come his way as good as
unsought.</p>

<p>Against this he had one piece of ill-luck to set. At the close
of the summer, when the hot winds were in blast, he had gone down
under the worst attack of dysentery he had had since the early
days. He really thought this time all was over with him. For six
weeks, in spite of the tenderest nursing, he had lain prostrate,
and as soon as he could bear the journey had to prescribe himself a
change to the seaside. The bracing air of Queenscliff soon picked
him up; he had, thank God, a marvellous faculty of recuperation:
while others were still not done pitying him, he was himself again,
and well enough to take the daily plunge in the Sea that was one of
his dearest pleasures.&mdash;To feel the warm, stinging fluid lap
him round, after all these drewthy years of dust and heat! He could
not have enough of it, and stayed so long in the water that his
wife, sitting at a decent distance from the Bathing Enclosure, grew
anxious, and agitated her little white parasol.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to equal it, Mary, this side Heaven!" he
declared as he rejoined her, his towel about his neck. "I wish I
could persuade you to try a dip, my dear."</p>

<p>But Mary preferred to sit quietly on the beach. "The dressing
and undressing is such a trouble," said she. As it was, one of her
elastic-sides was full of sand.</p>

<p>Yes, Polly was Mary now, and had been, since the day Ned turned
up again on Ballarat, accompanied by a wife and child. Mary was in
Melbourne at the time, at John's nuptials; Mahony had opened the
door himself to Ned's knock; and there, in a spring-cart, sat the
frowsy, red-haired woman who was come to steal his wife's name from
her. This invasion was the direct result of his impulsive
generosity. Had he only kept his money in his pocket!</p>

<p>He had been forced to take the trio in and give them house-room.
But he bore the storming of his hard-won privacy with a bad grace,
and Mary had much to gloss over on her return.</p>

<p>She had been greatly distressed by her favourite brother's
ill-considered marriage. For, if they had not held Jinny to be
John's equal, what <i>was</i> to be said of Ned's choice? Mrs. Ned
had lived among the mining population of Castlemaine, where her
father kept a public-house; and, said Richard, her manners were
accordingly: loud, slap-dash, familiar&mdash;before she had been
twenty-four hours under his roof she was bluntly addressing him as
"Mahony." There was also a peculiar streak of touchiness in her
nature ("Goes with hair of that colour, my dear!") which rendered
her extremely hard to deal with. She had, it seemed, opposed the
idea of moving to Ballarat&mdash;that was all in her favour, said
Mary&mdash;and came primed to detect a snub or a slight at every
turn. This morbid suspiciousness it was that led Mary to yield her
rights in the matter of the name: the confusion between them was
never-ending; and, at the first hint that the change would come
gracefully from her, Mrs. Ned had flown into a passion.</p>

<p>"It's all the same to me, Richard, what I'm called," Mary
soothed him. "And don't you think Polly was beginning to sound
<i>rather</i> childish, now I'm nearly twenty-four?"</p>

<p>But: "Oh, what <i>could</i> Ned have seen in her?" she sighed to
herself dismayed. For Mrs. Ned was at least ten years older than
her husband; and whatever affection might originally have existed
between them was now a thing of the past She tyrannised mercilessly
over him, nagging at him till Ned, who was nothing if not
good-natured, turned sullen and left off tossing his child in the
air.</p>

<p>"We must just make the best of it, Richard," said Mary. "After
all, she's really fond of the baby. And when the second
comes...you'll attend her yourself, won't you, dear? I think
somehow her temper may improve when that's over."</p>

<p>For this was another thing: Mrs. Ned had arrived there in a
condition that raised distressing doubts in Mary as to the dates of
Ned's marriage and the birth of his first child. She did not
breathe them to Richard; for it seemed to her only to make matters
of this kind worse, openly to speak of them. She devoted herself to
getting the little family under a roof of its own. Through
Richard's influence Ned obtained a clerkship in a carrying-agency,
which would just keep his head above water; and she found a tiny,
three-roomed house that was near enough to let her be daily with
her sister-in-law when the latter's time came. Meanwhile, she cut
out and helped to sew a complete little outfit ("What she had
before was no better than rags!"); and Mrs. Ned soon learned to
know on whom she could lean and to whom she might turn, not only
for practical aid, but also for a never failing sympathy in what
she called her "troubles."</p>

<p>"I vow your Mary's the kindest-hearted little soul it's ever
been me luck to run across," she averred one day to Mahony, who was
visiting her professionally. "So common-sense, too&mdash;no
nonsense about <i>her!</i> I shouldn't have thought a gaby like Ned
could have sported such trump of a sister."</p>

<p>"Another pensioner for your <i>caritas</i>, dear," said Mahony,
in passing on the verdict. What he did not grieve his wife by
repeating were certain bad reports of Ned lately brought him by
Jerry. According to Jerry&mdash;and the boy's word was to be relied
on&mdash;Ned had kept loose company in Castlemaine, and had
acquired the habit of taking more than was good for him. Did he not
speedily amend his ways, there would be small chance of him
remaining in his present post.</p>

<p>Here, Mahony was effectually roused by a stir on the verandah.
Jinny had entered the house to lay down her sleeping babe, and a
third voice, Purdy's, became audible. The wife had evidently
brought out a bottle of her famous home-brewed gingerbeer: he heard
the cork pop, the drip of the overflow on the boards, the clink of
the empty glass; and Purdy's warm words of appreciation.</p>

<p>Then there was silence. Rising from the sofa, Mahony inserted
himself between blind and window, and peeped out.</p>

<p>His first thought was: what a picture! Mary wore a pale pink
cotton gown which, over the light swellings of her crinoline,
bulged and billowed round her, and generously swept the ground.
Collar and cuffs of spotless lawn outlined neck and wrists. She
bent low over her stitching, and the straight white parting of her
hair intensified the ebony of the glossy bands. Her broad pure
forehead had neither line nor stain. On the trellis behind her a
vine hung laden with massy bunches of muscatelles.</p>

<p>Purdy sat on the edge of the verandah, with his back to Mahony.
Between thumb and forefinger he idly swung a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>Urged by some occult sympathy, Mary at once glanced up and
discovered her husband. Her face was lightly flushed from
stooping&mdash;and the least touch of colour was enough to give its
delicate ivory an appearance of vivid health. She had grown fuller
of late&mdash;quite fat, said Richard, when he wished to tease her:
a luxuriant young womanliness lay over and about her. Now, above
the pale wild-rose of her cheeks her black eyes danced with a
mischievous glee; for she believed her husband intended swinging
his leg noiselessly over the sill and creeping up to startle
Purdy&mdash;and this appealed to her sense of humour. But, as he
remained standing at the window, she just smiled slyly, satisfied
to be in communion with him over their unsuspecting friend's
head.</p>

<p>Here, however, Purdy brought his eyes back from the garden, and
she abruptly dropped hers to her needlework.</p>

<p>The scissors were shut with a snap, and thrown, rather than
laid, to the other implements in the workbox. "One 'ud think you
were paid to finish that wretched sewing in a fixed time, Polly,"
said Purdy cantankerously. "Haven't you got a word to say?"</p>

<p>"It's for the Dorcas Society. They're having a sale of
work."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn Dorcases! You're always slaving for somebody. You'll
ruin your eyes. I wonder Dick allows it. I shouldn't&mdash;I know
that."</p>

<p>The peal of laughter that greeted these words came equally from
husband and wife. Then: "What the dickens does it matter to you,
sir, how much sewing my wife chooses to do?" cried Mahony, and,
still laughing, stepped out of the window.</p>

<p>"Hello!&mdash;you there?" said Purdy and rose to his feet. "What
a beastly fright to give one!" He looked red and sulky.</p>

<p>"I scored that time, my boy!" and linking his arm in Mary's,
Mahony confronted his friend. "Afraid I'm neglecting my duties, are
you? Letting this young woman spoil her eyes?&mdash;Turn 'em on
him, my love, in all their splendour, that he may judge for
himself."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Richard," said Mary softly, but with an affectionate
squeeze of his arm.</p>

<p>"Well, ta-ta, I'm off!" said Purdy. And as Mahony still
continued to quiz him, he added in a downright surly tone: "Just
the same old Dick as ever! Blinder than any bat to all that doesn't
concern yourself! I'll eat my hat if it's ever entered your noddle
that Polly's quite the prettiest woman on Ballarat."</p>

<p>"Don't listen to him, Richard, please!" and: "Don't let your
head be turned by such fulsome flattery, my dear!" were wife and
husband's simultaneous exclamations.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think so," said Mary sturdily, and would have added
more, but just at this minute Jinny came out of the house, with the
peculiar noiseless tread she had acquired in moving round an
infant's crib; and Purdy vanished.</p>

<p>Jinny gazed at her sister-in-law with such meaning&mdash;that
Mary could not but respond.</p>

<p>"Did you get her safely laid down, dear?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, Mary! Without even the quiver of an eyelash. You
recollect, I told you yesterday when her little head touched the
pillow, she opened her eyes and looked at me. To-day there was
nothing of that sort. It was quite perfect"; and Jinny's voice
thrilled at the remembrance: it was as if, in continuing to sleep
during the transit, her&mdash;or rather John's&mdash;tiny daughter
had proved herself a marvellous sagacity.</p>

<p>Mahony gave an impatient shrug in Jinny's direction. But he,
too, had to stand fire: she had been waiting all day for a word
with him. The babe, who was teething, was plagued by various
disorders; and Jinny knew each fresh pin's-head of a spot that
joined the rash.</p>

<p>Mahony made light of her fears; then turning to his wife asked
her to hurry on the six-o'clock dinner: he had to see a patient
between that meal and tea. Mary went to make
arrangements&mdash;Richard always forgot to mention such things
till the last moment&mdash;and also to please Jinny by paying a
visit to the baby.</p>

<p>"The angels can't look very different when they sleep, I think,"
murmured its mother, hanging over the couch.</p>

<p>When Mary returned, she found her husband picking caterpillars
off the vine: Long Jim, odd man now about house and garden, was not
industrious enough to keep the pests under. In this brief spell of
leisure&mdash;such moments grew ever rarer in Richard's
life&mdash;husband and wife locked their arms and paced slowly up
and down the verandah. It was late afternoon on a breathless,
pale-skied February day; and the boards of the flooring gritted
with sandy dust beneath their feet.</p>

<p>"He <i>was</i> grumpy this afternoon, wasn't he?" said Mary,
without preamble. "But I've noticed once or twice lately that he
can't take a joke any more. He's grown queer altogether. Do you
know he's the only person who still persists in calling me by my
old name? He was quite rude about it when I asked him why. Perhaps
he's liverish, from the heat. It might be a good thing, dear, if
you went round and overhauled him. Somehow, it seems unnatural for
Purdy to be bad-tempered."</p>

<p>"It's true he may be a bit out of sorts. But I fear the evil's
deeper-seated. It's my opinion the boy is tiring of regular work.
Now that he hasn't even the excitement of the gold-escort to look
forward to...And he's been a rolling stone from the beginning, you
know."</p>

<p>"If only he would marry and settle down! I do wish I could find
a wife for him. The right woman could make anything of Purdy"; and
yet once more Mary fruitlessly scanned, in thought, the lists of
her acquaintance.</p>

<p>"What if it's a case of sour grapes, love? Since the prettiest
woman on Ballarat is no longer free..."</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, hush! Such foolish talk!"</p>

<p>"But is it?...let me look at her. Well, if not the prettiest, at
least a very pretty person indeed. It certainly becomes you to be
stouter, wife."</p>

<p>But Mary had not an atom of vanity in her. "Speaking of
prettiness reminds me of something that happened at the Races last
week&mdash;I forgot to tell you, at the time. There were two
gentlemen there from Melbourne; and as Agnes Ocock went past, one
of them said out loud: 'Gad! That's a lovely woman.' Agnes heard it
herself, and was most distressed. And the whole day, wherever she
went, they kept their field-glasses on her. Mr. Henry was
furious."</p>

<p>"If you'll allow me to say so, my dear, Mrs. Henry cannot hold a
candle to some one I know&mdash;to my mind, at least."</p>

<p>"If I suit you, Richard, that's all I care about."</p>

<p>"Well, to come back to what we were saying. My advice is, give
Master Purdy a taste of the cold shoulder the next time he comes
hanging about the house. Let him see his ill-temper didn't pass
unnoticed. There's no excuse for it. God bless me! doesn't he sleep
the whole night through in his bed?"&mdash;and Mahony's tone took
on an edge. The broken nights that were nowadays the rule with
himself were the main drawbacks to his prosperity. He had never
been a really good sleeper; and, in consequence, was one of those
people who feel an intense need for sleep, and suffer under its
curtailment. As things stood at present his rest was wholly at the
mercy of the night-bell&mdash;a remorseless instrument, given
chiefly to pealing just as he had managed to drop off. Its gentlest
tinkle was enough to rouse him&mdash;long before it had succeeded
in penetrating the ears of the groom, who was supposed to open. And
when it remained silent for a night, some trifling noise in the
road would simulate its jangle in his dreams. "It's a wonder I have
any nerves left," he grumbled, as the hot, red dawns crept in at
the sides of the bedroom-window. For the shortening of his sleep at
one end did not mean that he could make it up at the other. All
that summer he had fallen into the habit of waking at five o'clock,
and not being able to doze off again. The narrowest bar of light on
the ceiling, the earliest twitter of the sparrows was enough to
strike him into full consciousness; and Mary was hard put to it to
darken the room and ensure silence; and would be till the day came
when he could knock off work and take a thorough holiday. This he
promised himself to do, before he was very much older.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-4-2" id="ch-1-4-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>Mary sat with pencil and paper and wrinkled her brows. She was
composing a list, and every now and then, after an inward
calculation, she lowered the pencil to note such items as: three
tipsy-cakes, four trifles, eight jam-sandwiches. John Turnham had
run up from Melbourne to fetch home wife and child; and his
relatives were giving a musical card-party in his honour. By the
window Jinny sat on a low ottoman suckling her babe, and paying but
scant heed to her sister-in-law's deliberations: to her it seemed a
much more important matter that the milk should flow smoothly down
the precious little throat, than that Mary's supper should be a
complete success. With her free hand she imprisoned the two little
feet, working one against the other in slow enjoyment; or followed
the warm little limbs up inside the swaddling, after the fashion of
nursing mothers.</p>

<p>The two women were in the spare bedroom, which was dusk and cool
and dimity-white; and they exchanged remarks in a whisper; for the
lids had come down more than once on the big black eyes, and now
only lifted automatically from time to time, to send a last look of
utter satiation at the mother-face. Mary always said: "She'll drop
off sooner indoors, dear." But this was not the whole truth.
Richard had hinted that he considered the seclusion of the house
better suited to the business of nursing than the comparative
publicity of the verandah; for Jinny was too absorbed in her task
to take thought for the proprieties. Here now she sat&mdash;she had
grown very big and full since her marriage in the generous,
wide-lapped pose of some old Madonna.</p>

<p>Mary, thrown entirely on her own judgment, was just saying with
decision: "Well, better to err on the right side and have too much
than too little," and altering a four into a five, when steps came
down the passage and John entered the room. Jinny made him a sign,
and John, now Commissioner of Trade and Customs, advanced as
lightly as could be expected of a heavy, well-grown man.</p>

<p>"Does she sleep?" he asked.</p>

<p>His eyes had flown to the child; only in the second place did
they rest on his wife. At the sight of her free and easy bearing
his face changed, and he said stiffly: "I think, Jane, a little
less exposure of your person, my dear..."</p>

<p>Flushing to her hair-roots, Jinny began as hastily as she dared
to re-arrange her dress.</p>

<p>Mary broke a lance on her behalf. "We were quite alone, John,"
she reminded her brother. "Not expecting a visit from you." And
added: "Richard says it is high time Baby was weaned. Jinny is
feeling the strain."</p>

<p>"As long as this rash continues I shall not permit it," answered
John, riding rough-shod over even Richard's opinion. ("I shouldn't
agree to it either, John dear," murmured Jinny.) "And now, Mary, a
word with you about the elder children. I understand that you are
prepared to take Emma back&mdash;is that so?"</p>

<p>Yes, Mary was pleased to say Richard had consented to Trotty's
return; but he would not hear of her undertaking Johnny. At eleven
years of age the proper place for a boy, he said, was a Grammar
School. With Trotty, of course, it was different. "I always found
her easy to manage, and should be more than glad to have her"; and
Mary meant what she said. Her heart ached for John's motherless
children. Jinny's interest in them had lasted only so long as she
had none of her own; and Mary, who being childless had kept a large
heart for all little ones, marvelled at the firm determination to
get rid of her stepchildren which her sister-in-law, otherwise so
pliable, displayed.</p>

<p>Brother and sister talked things over, intuitively meeting
half-way, understanding each other with a word, as only blood
relations can. Jinny, the chief person concerned, sat meekly by, or
chimed in merely to echo her husband's views.</p>

<p>"By the way, I ran into Richard on Specimen Hill," said John as
he turned to leave the room. "And he asked me to let you know that
he would not be home to lunch."</p>

<p>"There...if that isn't always the way!" exclaimed Mary. "As sure
as I cook something he specially likes, he doesn't come in. Tilly
sent me over the loveliest little sucking-pig this morning. Richard
would have enjoyed it."</p>

<p>"You should be proud, my dear Mary, that his services are in
such demand."</p>

<p>"I am, John&mdash;no one could be prouder. But all the same I
wish he could manage to be a little more regular with his meals. It
makes cooking so difficult. To-morrow, because I shan't have a
minute to spare, he'll be home punctually, demanding something
nice. But I warn you, to-morrow you'll all have to picnic!"</p>

<p>However, when the day came, she was better than her word, and
looked to it that neither guests nor husband went short. Since a
couple of tables on trestles took up the dining-room, John and
Mahony lunched together in the surgery; while Jinny's meal was
spread on a tray and sent to her in the bedroom. Mary herself had
time only to snatch a bite standing. From early morning on, tied up
in a voluminous apron, she was cooking in the kitchen, very hot and
floury and preoccupied, drawing grating shelves out of the oven,
greasing tins and patty-pans, dredging flour. The click-clack of
egg-beating resounded continuously; and mountains of sponge-cakes
of all shapes and sizes rose under her hands. This would be the
largest, most ambitious party she had ever given&mdash;the guests
expected numbered between twenty and thirty, and had, besides,
carte blanche to bring with them anyone who happened to be staying
with them&mdash;and it would be a disgrace under which Mary, reared
in Mrs. Beamish's school, could never again have held up her head,
had a single article on her supper-table run short.</p>

<p>In all this she had only such help as her one maidservant could
give her &mdash;John had expressly forbidden Jinny the kitchen.
True, during the morning Miss Amelia Ocock, a gentle little elderly
body with a harmless smile and a prominent jaw, who was now an
inmate of her father's house, together with Zara, returned from
England and a visitor at the Ocock's&mdash;these two walked over to
offer their aid in setting the tables. But Miss Amelia, fluttery
and undecided as a bird, was far too timid to do herself justice;
and Zara spent so long arranging the flowers in the central
epergnes that before she had finished with one of them it was lunch
time.</p>

<p>"I could have done it myself while she was cutting the stalks,"
Mary told her husband. "But Zara hasn't really been any good at
flowers since her 'mixed bouquet' took first prize at the Flower
Show. Of course, though, it looks lovely now it's done."</p>

<p>Purdy dropped in during the afternoon and was more useful; he
sliced the crusts off loaf-high mounds of sandwiches, and tested
the strength and flavour of the claret-cup. Mary could not make up
her mind, when it came to the point, to follow Richard's advice and
treat him coldly. She did, however, tell him that his help would be
worth a great deal more to her if he talked less and did not always
look for an answer to what he said. But Purdy was not to be
quashed. He had taken it into his head that she was badly treated,
in being left "to slave" alone, within the oven's radius; and he
was very hard on Jinny, whom he had espied comfortably dandling her
child on the front verandah. "I'd like to wring the bloomin' kid's
neck!"</p>

<p>"Purdy, for shame!" cried Mary outraged. "It's easy to see
you're still a bachelor. Just wait, sir, till you have children of
your own!"</p>

<p>Under her guidance he bore stacks of plates across the yard to
the dining-room&mdash;where the blinds were lowered to keep the
room cool&mdash;and strewed these, and corresponding knives and
forks, up and down the tables. He also carried over the heavy
soup-tureen in which was the claret-cup. But he had a man's
slippery fingers, and, between these and his limp, Mary trembled
for the fate of her crockery. He made her laugh, too, and
distracted her attention; and she was glad when it was time for him
to return to barracks.</p>

<p>"Now come early to-night," she admonished him. "And mind you
bring your music. Miss Amelia's been practising up that duet all
the week. She'll be most disappointed if you don't ask her to sing
with you."</p>

<p>On the threshold of the kitchen Purdy set his fingers to his
nose in the probable direction of Miss Amelia; then performed some
skittish female twists and turns about the yard. "So hoarse,
love...a bad cold...not in voice!" Mary laughed afresh, and ordered
him off.</p>

<p>But when he had gone she looked grave, and out of an oddly
disquieting feeling said to herself: "I do hope he'll be on his
best behaviour to-night, and not tread on Richard's toes."</p>

<p>As it was, she had to inform her husband of something that she
knew would displease him. John had come back in the course of the
afternoon and announced, without ceremony, that he had extended an
invitation to the Devines for the evening.</p>

<p>"It's quite true what's being said, dear," Mary strove to soothe
Richard, as she helped him make a hasty toilet in the bathroom.
"Mr. Devine is going to stand for Parliament; and he has promised
his support, if he gets in, to some measure John has at heart. John
wants to have a long talk with him to-night."</p>

<p>But Richard was exceedingly put out. "Well, I hope, my dear,
that as it's your brother who has taken such a liberty,
<i>you'll</i> explain the situation to your guests. I certainly
shall not. But I do know there was no need to exclude Ned and Polly
from such an omnium-gatherum as this party of yours will be."</p>

<p>Even while he spoke there came a rat-a-tat at the front door,
and Mary had to hurry off. And now knock succeeded knock with the
briefest of intervals, the noise carrying far in the quiet street.
Mysteriously bunched-up figures, their heads veiled in the
fleeciest of clouds, were piloted along the passage; and: "I
<i>hope</i> we are not the first!" was murmured by each new-comer
in turn. The gentlemen went to change their boots on the back
verandah; the ladies to lay off their wraps in Mary's bedroom. And
soon this room was filled to overflowing with the large soft
abundance of crinoline; hoops swaying from this side to that, as
the guests gave place to one another before the looking-glass,
where bands of hair were smoothed and the catches of bracelets
snapped. Music-cases lay strewn over the counterpane; the husbands
who lined up in the passage, to wait for their wives, also bearing
rolls of music. Mary, in black silk with a large cameo brooch at
her throat, and only a delicate pink on her cheeks to tell of all
her labours, moved helpfully to and fro, offering a shoe-horn, a
hand-mirror, pins and hairpins. She was caught, as she passed Mrs.
Henry Ocock, a modishly late arrival, by that lady's plump white
hand, and a whispered request to be allowed to retain her mantle.
"Henry was really against my coming, dearest. So anxious...so
absurdly anxious!"</p>

<p>"And pray where's the Honourable Mrs. T. to-night?" inquired
"old Mrs. Ocock," rustling up to them: Tilly was the biggest and
most handsomely dressed woman in the room. "On her knees
worshipping, I bet you, up to the last minute! Or else not allowed
to show her nose till the Honourable John's got his studs
in.&mdash;Now then, girls, how much longer are you going to stand
preening and prinking?"</p>

<p>The "girls" were Zara, at this present a trifle <i>passee</i>,
and Miss Amelia, who was still further from her prime; and
gathering the two into her train, as a hen does its chickens, Tilly
swept them off to face the ordeal of the gentlemen and the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mary and Agnes brought up the rear. Mr. Henry was on the watch,
and directly his wife appeared wheeled forward the best armchair
and placed her in it, with a footstool under her feet. Mary planted
Jinny next her and left them to their talk of nurseries: for
Richard's sake she wished to screen Agnes from the vulgarities of
Mrs. Devine. Herself she saw with dismay, on entering, that Richard
had already been pounced on by the husband: there he stood,
listening to his ex-greengrocer's words&mdash;they were interlarded
with many an awkward and familiar gesture&mdash;on his face an
expression his wife knew well, while one small, impatient hand
tugged at his whiskers.</p>

<p>But "old Mrs. Ocock" came to his rescue, bearing down upon him
with an outstretched hand, and a howdee-do that could be heard all
over the room: Tilly had long forgotten that she had ever borne him
a grudge; she it was who could now afford to patronise. "I hope I
see you well, doctor?&mdash;Oh, not a bit of it...I left him at
'ome. Mr. O. has something wrong, if you please, with his leg or
his big toe&mdash;gout or rheumatiz or something of that
sort&mdash;and 'e's been so crabby with it for the last day or so
that to-night I said to 'im: 'No, my dear, you'll just take a glass
of hot toddy, and go early and comfortable to your bed.' Musical
parties aren't in his line anyhow."</p>

<p>A lively clatter of tongues filled the room, the space of which
was taxed to its utmost: there were present, besides the friends
and intimates of the house, several of Mahony's colleagues, a
couple of Bank Managers, the Police Magistrate, the Postmaster, the
Town Clerk, all with their ladies. Before long, however, ominous
pauses began to break up the conversation, and Mary was
accomplished hostess enough to know what these meant. At a sign
from her, Jerry lighted the candles on the piano, and thereupon a
fugue-like chorus went up: "Mrs. Mahony, won't you play
something?&mdash;Oh, do!&mdash;Yes, please, do...I should enjoy it
so much."</p>

<p>Mary did not wait to be pressed; it was her business to set the
ball rolling; and she stood up and went to the piano as
unconcernedly as she would have gone to sweep a room or make a
bed.</p>

<p>Placing a piece of music on the rack, she turned down the
corners of the leaves. But here Archdeacon Long's handsome,
weatherbeaten face looked over her shoulder. "I hope you're going
to give us the cannons, Mrs. Mahony?" he said genially. And so Mary
obliged him by laying aside the <i>morceau</i> she had chosen, and
setting up instead a "battle-piece," that was a general
favourite.</p>

<p>"Aha! that's the ticket," said Henry Ocock, and rubbed his hands
as Mary struck up, pianissimo, the march that told of the enemy's
approach.</p>

<p>And: "Boompity-boomp-boomp-boomp!" Archdeacon Long could not
refrain from underlining each fresh salvo of artillery; while:
"That's a breach in their walls for 'em!" was Chinnery of the
London Chartered's contribution to the stock of fun.</p>

<p>Mahony stood on the hearthrug and surveyed the assembly. His
eyes fled Mrs. Devine, most unfortunately perched on an ottoman in
the middle of the room, where she sat, purple, shiny and beaming,
two hot, fat, red hands clasped over her stomach ("Like a heathen
idol! Confound the woman! I shall have to go and do the polite to
her"), and sought Mary at the piano, hanging with pleasure on the
slim form in the rich silk dress. This caught numberless lights
from the candles, as did also the wings of her glossy hair. He
watched, with a kind of amused tenderness, how at each forte
passage head and shoulders took their share of lending force to the
tones. He never greatly enjoyed Mary's playing. She did well enough
at it, God bless her!&mdash;it would not have been Mary if she
hadn't&mdash;but he came of a musical family; his mother had sung
Handel faultlessly in her day, besides having a mastery of several
instruments: and he was apt to be critical. Mary's firm, capable
hands looked out of place on a piano; seemed to stand in a sheerly
business relation to the keys. Nor was it otherwise with her
singing: she had a fair contralto, but her ear was at fault; and he
sometimes found himself swallowing nervously when she attacked high
notes.</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor! your wife <i>do</i> play the pianner lovely," said
Mrs. Devine, and her fat front rose and fell in an ecstatic
sigh.</p>

<p>"Richard dear, will you come?" Mary laid her hands on his
shoulder: their guests were clamouring for a <i>duo</i>. Her touch
was a caress: here he was, making himself as pleasant as he knew
how, to this old woman. When it came to doing a kindness, you could
rely on Richard; he was all bark and no bite.</p>

<p>Husband and wife blended their voices&mdash;Mary had been at
considerable pains to get up her part&mdash;and then Richard went
on to a solo. He had a clear, true tenor that was very agreeable to
hear; and Mary felt quite proud of his attainments. Later in the
evening he might be persuaded to give them a reading from Boz, or a
recitation. At that kind of thing, he had not his equal.</p>

<p>But first there was a cry for his flute; and in vain did Mahony
protest that weeks had elapsed since he last screwed the instrument
together. He got no quarter, even from Mary&mdash;but then Mary was
one of those inconvenient people to whom it mattered not a jot what
a fool you made of yourself, as long as you did what was asked of
you. And so, from memory and unaccompanied, he played them the old
familiar air of <i>The Minstrel Boy</i>. The theme, in his
rendering, was overlaid by florid variations and cumbered with
senseless repetitions; but, none the less, the wild, wistful melody
went home, touching even those who were not musical to
thoughtfulness and retrospect. The most obstinate chatterers, whom
neither sham battles nor Balfe and Blockley had silenced, held
their tongues; and Mrs. Devine openly wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>O, THE MINSTREL BOY TO THE WARS HAS GONE!<br>
IN THE RANKS OF DEATH YOU'LL FIND HIM.</p>

<p>While it was proceeding, Mary found herself seated next John.
John tapped his foot in time to the tune; and under cover of the
applause at its close remarked abruptly: "You should fatten Richard
up a bit, Mary. He could stand it."</p>

<p>From where they sat they had Richard in profile, and Mary
studied her husband critically, her head a little on one side.
"Yes, he <i>is</i> rather thin. But I don't think he was ever meant
to be fat."</p>

<p>"Ah well! we are none of us as young as we used to be," was
John's tribute to the power of music. And throwing out his stomach,
he leaned back in his chair and plugged the armholes of his vest
with his thumbs.</p>

<p>And now, after due pressing on the part of host and hostess, the
other members of the company advanced upon the piano, either singly
or in couples, to bear a hand in the burden of entertainment. Their
seeming reluctance had no basis in fact; for it was an unwritten
law that every one who could must add his mite; and only those who
literally had "not a note of music in them" were exempt. Tilly took
a mischievous pleasure in announcing bluntly: "So sorry, my dear,
not to be able to do you a tool-de-rool! But when the Honourable
Mrs. T. and I were nippers we'd no time to loll round pianos, nor
any pianos to loll round!"&mdash;this, just to see her
brother-in-law's dark scowl; for no love&mdash;not even a
liking&mdash;was lost between her and John. But with this handful
of exceptions all nobly toed the line. Ladies with the tiniest
reeds of voices, which shook like reeds, warbled of Last Roses and
Prairie Flowers; others, with more force but due decorum, cried to
Willie that they had Missed Him, or coyly confessed to the presence
of Silver Threads Among the Gold; and Mrs. Chinnery, an old-young
woman with a long, lean neck, which she twisted this way and that
in the exertion of producing her notes, declared her love for an
Old Armchair. The gentlemen, in baritones and profundos, told the
amorous adventures of Ben Bolt; or desired to know what Home would
be Without a Mother. Purdy spiced the hour with a comic song, and
in the character of an outraged wife tickled the risibility of the
ladies.</p>

<p>Well, well, sir, so you've come at last!<br>
I thought you'd come no more.<br>
I've waited, with my bonnet on,<br>
From one till half-past four!</p>

<p>Zara and Mrs. Long both produced <i>Home They Brought Her
Warrior Dead!</i> from their portfolios; so Zara good-naturedly
gave way and struck up <i>Robert, Toi Que J'Aime!</i> which she had
added to her repertory while in England. No one could understand a
word of what she sang; but the mere fitting of the foreign
syllables to the appropriate notes was considered a feat in itself,
and corroborative of the high gifts Zara possessed.</p>

<p>Strenuous efforts were needed to get Miss Amelia to her feet.
She was dying, as Mary knew, to perform her duet with Purdy; but
when the moment came she put forward so many reasons for not
complying that most people retired in despair. It took Mary to
persevere. And finally the little woman was persuaded to the piano,
where, red with gratification, she sat down, spread her skirts and
unclasped her bracelets.</p>

<p>"Poor little Amelia!" said Mary to herself, as she listened to a
romantic ballad in which Purdy, in the character of a high-minded
nobleman, sought the hand of a virtuous gipsy-maid. "And he doesn't
give her a second thought. If one could just tell her not to be so
silly!"</p>

<p>Not only had Purdy never once looked near Amelia&mdash;for the
most part he had sat rather mum-chance, half-way in and out of a
French window, even Zara's attempts to enliven him falling
flat&mdash;but, during an extra loud performance, Tilly had
confided to Mary the family's plans for their spinster relative.
And: "The poor little woman!" thought Mary again as she listened.
For, after having been tied for years to the sick bed of a
querulous mother; after braving the long sea-voyage, which for such
a timid soul was full of ambushes and terrors, Miss Amelia had
reached her journey's end only to find both father and brother
comfortably wived, and with no use for her. Neither of them wanted
her. She had been given house-room first by her father, then by the
Henrys, and once more had had to go back to the paternal roof.</p>

<p>"It was nothing for Mossieu Henry in the long run," was his
stepmother's comment. But she laughed good-humouredly as she said
it; for, his first wrath at her intrusion over, Henry had more or
less become her friend; and now maintained that it was not a bad
thing for his old father to have a sensible, managing woman behind
him. Tilly had developed in many ways since her marriage; and Henry
and she mutually respected each other's practical qualities.</p>

<p>The upshot of the affair was, she now told Mary, that Miss
Amelia's male relatives had subscribed a dowry for her. "It was me
that insisted Henry should pay his share&mdash;him getting all the
money 'e did with Agnes." And Amelia was to be married off
to&mdash;"Well, if you turn your head, my dear, you'll see who.
Back there, helping to hold up the doorpost."</p>

<p>Under cover of Zara's roulades Mary cautiously looked round. It
was Henry's partner&mdash;young Grindle, now on the threshold of
the thirties. His side-whiskers a shade less flamboyant than of
old, a heavy watch-chain draped across his front, Grindle stood and
lounged with his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>Mary made round eyes. "Oh, but Tilly!...isn't it very risky?
He's so much younger than she is. Suppose she shouldn't be
happy?"</p>

<p>"That'll be all right, Mary, trust me. Only give 'er a handle to
'er name, and Amelia 'ud be happy with any one. She hasn't
<i>that</i> much backbone in 'er. Besides, my dear, you think,
she's over forty! Let her take 'er chance and be thankful. It isn't
every old maid 'ud get such an offer."</p>

<p>"And is...is <i>he</i> agreeable?" asked Mary, still
unconvinced.</p>

<p>Tilly half closed her right eye and protruded the tip of her
tongue. "You could stake your last fiver on it, he is!"</p>

<p>But now that portion of the entertainment devoted to art was at
an end, and the serious business of the evening began. Card-tables
had been set out&mdash;for loo, as for less hazardous games. In
principle, Mahony objected to the high play that was the order of
the day; but if you invited people to your house you could not ask
them to screw their points down from crowns to halfpence. They
would have thanked you kindly and have stayed at home. Here, at the
loo-table places were eagerly snapped up, Henry Ocock and his
stepmother being among the first to secure seats: both were keen,
hard players, who invariably re-lined their well-filled
pockets.</p>

<p>It would not have been the thing for either Mahony or his wife
to take a hand; several of the guests held aloof. John had
buttonholed old Devine; Jinny and Agnes were still lost in
domesticities. Dear little Agnes had grown so retiring of late,
thought Mary; she quite avoided the society of gentlemen, in which
she had formerly taken such pleasure. Richard and Archdeacon Long
sat on the verandah, and in moving to and fro, Mary caught a
fragment of their talk: they were at the debatable question of
table-turning, and her mental comment was a motherly and amused:
"That Richard, who is so clever, can interest himself in such
nonsense!" Further on, Zara was giving Grindle an account of her
voyage "home," and ticking off the reasons that had led to her
return. She sat across a hammock, and daintily exposed a very neat
ankle. "It was much too sleepy and dull for <i>me!</i> No, I've
<i>quite</i> decided to spend the rest of my days in the
colony."</p>

<p>Mrs. Devine was still perched on her ottoman. She beamed at her
hostess. "No, I dunno one card from another, dearie, and don' want
to. Oh, my dear, what a <i>lovely</i> party it 'as been, and 'ow
well you've carried it h'off!"</p>

<p>Mary nodded and smiled; but with an air of abstraction. The
climax of her evening was fast approaching. Excusing herself, she
slipped away and went to cast a last eye over her supper-tables, up
and down which benches were ranged, borrowed from the Sunday
School. To her surprise she found herself followed by Mrs.
Devine.</p>

<p>"<i>Do</i> let me 'elp you, my dear, do, now! I feel that stiff
and silly sittin' stuck up there with me 'ands before me. And jes'
send that young feller about 'is business."</p>

<p>So Purdy and his offers of assistance were returned with thanks
to the card-room, and Mrs. Devine pinned up her black silk front.
But not till she had freely vented her astonishment at the
profusion of Mary's good things. "'Ow <i>do</i> you git 'em to rise
so?&mdash;No, I never did! Fit for Buckin'am Palace and Queen
Victoria! And all by your little self, too.&mdash;My dear, I must
give you a good <i>'ug!</i>"</p>

<p>Hence, when at twelve o'clock the company began to stream in,
they found Mrs. Devine installed behind the barricade of cups,
saucers and glasses; and she it was who dispensed tea and coffee
and ladled out the claret-cup; thus leaving Mary free to keep an
argus eye on her visitors' plates. At his entry Richard had raised
expostulating eyebrows; but his tongue of course was tied. And Mary
made a lifelong friend.</p>

<p>And now for the best part of an hour Mary's sandwiches,
sausage-rolls and meat-pies; her jam-rolls, pastries and
lemon-sponges; her jellies, custards and creams; her blanc and
jaunemanges and whipped syllabubs; her trifles, tipsy-cakes and
charlotte-russes formed the theme of talk and objects of attention.
And though the ladies picked with becoming daintiness, the
gentlemen made up for their partners' deficiencies; and there was
none present who did not, in the shape of a hearty and well-turned
compliment, add yet another laurel to Mary's crown.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-4-3" id="ch-1-4-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>It had struck two before the party began to break up. The first
move made, however, the guests left in batches, escorting one
another to their respective house-doors. The Henry Ococks' buggy
had been in waiting for some time, and Mrs. Henry's pretty head was
drooping with fatigue before Henry, who was in the vein, could tear
himself from the card-table. Mahony went to the front gate with
them; then strolled with the Longs to the corner of the road.</p>

<p>He was in no hurry to retrace his steps. The air was balmy,
after that of the overcrowded rooms, and it was a fabulously
beautiful night. The earth lay steeped in moonshine, as in the
light of a silver sun. Trees and shrubs were patterned to their
last leaf on the ground before them. What odd mental twist made
mortals choose rather to huddle indoors, by puny candle-light, than
to be abroad laving themselves in a splendour such as this?</p>

<p>Leaning his arms on the top rail of a fence, he looked across
the slope at the Flat, now hushed and still as the encampment of a
sleeping army. Beyond, the bush shimmered palely grey&mdash;in his
younger years he had been used, on a night like this when the moon
sailed full and free, to take his gun and go opossuming. Those two
old woody gods, Warrenheip and Buninyong, stood out more imposingly
than by day; but the ranges seemed to have retreated. The light lay
upon them like a visible burden, flattening their contours, filling
up clefts and fissures with a milky haze.</p>

<p>"Good evening, doctor!"</p>

<p>Spoken in his very ear, the words made him jump. He had been
lost in contemplation; and the address had a ghostly suddenness.
But it was no ghost that stood beside him&mdash;nor indeed was it a
night for those presences to be abroad whose element is the
dark.</p>

<p>Ill-pleased at the intrusion, he returned but a stiff nod: then,
since he could not in decency greet and leave-take in a breath,
feigned to go on for a minute with his study of the landscape.
After which he said: "Well, I must be moving. Good night to
you."</p>

<p>"So you're off your sleep, too, are you?" As often happens, the
impulse to speak was a joint one. The words collided.</p>

<p>Instinctively Mahony shrank into himself; this familiar
bracketing of his person with another's was distasteful to him.
Besides, the man who had sprung up at his elbow bore a reputation
that was none of the best. The owner of a small chemist's shop on
the Flat, he contrived to give offence in sundry ways: he was
irreligious&mdash;an infidel, his neighbours had it&mdash;and of a
Sabbath would scour his premises or hoe potatoes rather than attend
church or chapel. Though not a confirmed drunkard, he had been seen
to stagger in the street, and be unable to answer when spoken to.
Also, the woman with whom he lived was not generally believed to be
his lawful wife. Hence the public fought shy of his nostrums; and
it was a standing riddle how he managed to avoid putting up his
shutters. More nefarious practices no doubt, said the relentless
<i>vox populi</i>.&mdash;Seen near at hand, he was a tall,
haggard-looking fellow of some forty years of age, the muscles on
his neck standing out like those of a skinny old horse.</p>

<p>Here, his gratuitous assumption of a common bond drew a cold:
"Pray, what reason have you to think that?" from Mahony. And
without waiting for a reply he again said good night and turned to
go.</p>

<p>The man accepted the rebuff with a meekness that was painful to
see. "Thought, comin' on you like this, you were a case like my
own. No offence, I'm sure," he said humbly. It was evident he was
well used to getting the cold shoulder. Mahony stayed his steps.
"What's the matter with you?" he asked. "Aren't you well? There's a
remedy to be found for most ills under the sun."</p>

<p>"Not for mine! The doctor isn't born or the drug discovered that
could cure me."</p>

<p>The tone of bragging bitterness grated anew. Himself given to
the vice of overstatement, Mahony had small mercy on it in others.
"Tut, tut!" he deprecated.</p>

<p>There was a brief silence before the speaker went on more
quietly: "You're a young man, doctor, I'm an old one." And he
looked old as he spoke; Mahony saw that he had erred in putting him
down as merely elderly. He was old and grey and
down-at-heel&mdash;fifty, if a day&mdash;and his clothes hung loose
on his bony frame. "You'll excuse me if I say I know better'n you.
When a man's done, he's done. And that's me. Yes,"&mdash;he grew
inflated again in reciting his woes&mdash;"I'm one o' your hopeless
cases, just as surely as if I was being eaten up by a cancer or a
consumption. To mend me, you doctors 'ud need to start me
afresh&mdash;from the mother-egg."</p>

<p>"You exaggerate, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"It's that&mdash;knowin' one's played out, with by rights still
a good third of one's life to run&mdash;that's what puts the sleep
away. In the daylight it's none so hard to keep the black thoughts
under; themselves they're not so daresome; and there's one's pipe,
and the haver o' the young fry. But night's the time! Then they
come tramplin' along, a whole army of 'em, carryin' banners with
letters a dozen feet high, so's you shan't miss rememberin' what
you'd give your soul to forget. And so it'll go on, et cetera and
ad lib., till it pleases the old Joker who sits grinnin' up aloft
to put His heel down&mdash;as you or me would squash a bull-ant or
a scorpion."</p>

<p>"You speak bitterly, Mr. Tangye. Does a night like this not
bring you calmer, clearer thoughts?" and Mahony waved his arm in a
large, loose gesture at the sky.</p>

<p>His words passed unheeded. The man he addressed spun round and
faced him, with a rusty laugh. "Hark at that!" he cried. "Just hark
at it! Why, in all the years I've been in this God-forsaken
place&mdash;long as I've been here&mdash;I've never yet heard my
own name properly spoken. You're the first, doctor. You shall have
the medal."</p>

<p>"But, man alive, you surely don't let that worry you? Why, I've
the same thing to put up with every day of my life. I smile at it."
And Mahony believed what he said, forgetting, in the antagonism
such spleen roused in him, the annoyance the false stressing of his
own name could sometimes cause him.</p>

<p>"So did I, once," said Tangye, and wagged his head. "But the day
came when it seemed the last straw; a bit o' mean spite on the part
o' this hell of a country itself."</p>

<p>"You dislike the colony, it appears, intensely?"</p>

<p>"You like it?" The counter question came tip for tap.</p>

<p>"I can be fair to it, I hope, and appreciate its good sides." As
always, the mere hint of an injustice made Mahony passionately
just.</p>

<p>"Came 'ere of your own free will, did you? Weren't crowded out
at home? Or bamboozled by a pack o' lying tales?" Tangye's voice
was husky with eagerness.</p>

<p>"That I won't say either. But it is entirely my own choice that
I remain here."</p>

<p>"Well, I say to you, think twice of it! If you have the chance
of gettin' away, take it. It's no place this, doctor, for the likes
of you and me. Haven't you never turned and asked yourself what the
devil you were doin' here? And that reminds me...There was a line
we used to have drummed into us at school&mdash;it's often come
back to me since. COELUM, NON ANIMUM, MUTANT, QUI TRANS MARE
CURRUNT. In our green days we gabbled that off by rote; then, it
seemed just one more o' the eel-sleek phrases the classics are full
of. Now, I take off my hat to the man who wrote it. He knew what he
was talkin' about&mdash;by the Lord Harry, he did!"</p>

<p>The Latin had come out tentatively, with an odd, unused
intonation. Mahony's retort: "How on earth do you know what suits
me and what doesn't?" died on his lips. He was surprised into
silence. There had been nothing in the other's speech to show that
he was a man of any education&mdash;rather the reverse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tangye went on: "I grant you it's an antiquated point
o' view; but doesn't that go to prove what I've been sayin'; that
you and me are old-fashioned, too&mdash;out-o'-place here,
out-o'-date? The modern sort, the sort that gets on in this
country, is a prime hand at cuttin' his coat to suit his cloth; for
all that the stop-at-homes, like the writer o' that line and other
ancients, prate about the Ethiopian's hide or the leopard and his
spots. They didn't buy their experience dear, like we did; didn't
guess that if a man <i>don't</i> learn to fit himself in, when he
gets set down in such a land as this, he's a goner; any more'n they
knew that most o' those who hold out here&mdash;all of 'em at any
rate who've climbed the ladder, nabbed the plunder&mdash;have found
no more difficulty in changin' their spots than they have their
trousers. Yes, doctor, there's only one breed that flourishes, and
you don't need me to tell you which it is. Here they lie"&mdash;and
he nodded to right and left of him &mdash;"dreamin' o' their
money-bags, and their dividends, and their profits, and how they'll
diddle and swindle one another afresh, soon as the sun gets up
to-morrow. Harder 'n nails they are, and sharp as needles. You ask
me why I do my walkin' out in the night-time? It's so's to avoid
the sight o' their mean little eyes, and their greedy, graspin'
faces."</p>

<p>Mahony's murmured disclaimer fell on deaf ears. Like one who had
been bottled up for months, Tangye flowed on. "What a life! What a
set! What a place to end one's days in! Remember, if you can, the
yarns that were spun round it for our benefit, from twenty thousand
safe miles away. It was the Land o' Promise and Plenty, topful o'
gold, strewn over with nuggets that only waited for hands to pick
'em up.&mdash;Lies!&mdash;lies from beginnin' to end! I say to you
this is the hardest and cruellest country ever created, and a man
like me's no more good here than the muck&mdash;the parin's and
stale fishguts and other leavin's&mdash;that knocks about a harbour
and washes against the walls. I'll tell you the only use I'll have
been here, doctor, when my end comes: I'll dung some bit o' land
for 'em with my moulder and rot. That's all. They'd do better with
my sort if they knocked us on the head betimes, and boiled us down
for our fat and marrow."</p>

<p>Not much in that line to be got from <i>your</i> carcase, my
friend, thought Mahony, with an inward smile.</p>

<p>But Tangye had paused merely to draw breath. "What I say is,
instead o' layin' snares for us, it ought to be forbid by law to
give men o' my make ship room. At home in the old country we'd find
our little nook, and jog along decently to the end of our days. But
just the staid, respectable, orderly sort I belonged to's neither
needed nor wanted here. I fall to thinkin' sometimes on the fates
of the hundreds of honest, steady-goin' lads, who at one time or
another have chucked up their jobs over there&mdash;for this. The
drink no doubt's took most: they never knew before that one
<i>could</i> sweat as you sweat here. And the rest? Well, just
accident...or the sun...or dysentery...or the bloody toil that goes
by the name o' work in these parts&mdash;you know the list, doctor,
better'n me. They say the waste o' life in a new country can't be
helped; doesn't matter; has to be. But that's cold comfort to the
wasted. No! I say to you, there ought to be an Act of Parliament to
prevent young fellows squanderin' themselves, throwin' away their
lives as I did mine. For when we're young, we're not sane. Youth's
a fever o' the brain. And I <i>was</i> young once, though you
mightn't believe it; I had straight joints, and no pouch under my
chin, and my full share o' windy hopes. Senseless truck these! To
be spilled overboard bit by bit&mdash;like on a hundred-mile tramp
a new-chum finishes by pitchin' from his swag all the needless
rubbish he's started with. What's wanted to get on here's somethin'
quite else. Horny palms and costive bowels; more'n a dash o' the
sharper; and no sickly squeamishness about knockin' out other men
and steppin' into their shoes. And I was only an ordinary young
chap; not over-strong nor over-shrewd, but honest&mdash;honest, by
God I was! That didn't count. It even stood in my way. For I was
too good for this and too mealy-mouthed for that; and while I
stuck, considerin' the fairness of a job, some one who didn't care
a damn whether it was fair or not, walked in over my head and took
it from me. There isn't anything I haven't tried my luck at, and
with everything it's been the same. Nothin's prospered; the money
wouldn't come&mdash;or stick if it did. And so here I am&mdash;all
that's left of me. It isn't much; and by and by a few rank weeds
'ull spring from it, and old Joey there, who's paid to grub round
the graves, old Joey 'ull curse and say: a weedy fellow that, a
rotten, weedy blackguard; and spit on his hands and hoe, till the
weeds lie bleedin' their juices&mdash;the last heirs of me...the
last issue of my loins!"</p>

<p>"Pray, does it never occur to you, you fool, that <i>flowers</i>
may spring from you?"</p>

<p>He had listened to Tangye's diatribe in a white heat of
impatience. But when he spoke he struck an easy tone&mdash;nor was
he in any hesitation how to reply: for that, he had played devil's
advocate all too often with himself in private. An unlovely
country, yes, as Englishmen understood beauty; and yet not without
a charm of its own. An arduous life, certainly, and one full of
pitfalls for the weak or the unwary; yet he believed it was no more
impossible to win through here, and with clean hands, than anywhere
else. To generalise as his companion had done was absurd.
Preposterous, too, the notion that those of their fellow-townsmen
who had carried off the prizes owed their success to some
superiority in bodily strength...or sharp dealing...or thickness of
skin. With Mr. Tangye's permission he would cite himself as an
example. He was neither a very robust man, nor, he ventured to say,
one of any marked ability in the other two directions. Yet he had
managed to succeed without, in the process, sacrificing jot or
tittle of his principles; and to-day he held a position that any
member of his profession across the seas might envy him.</p>

<p>"Yes, but till you got there!" cried Tangye. "Hasn't every
superfluous bit of you&mdash;every thought of interest that wasn't
essential to the daily grind&mdash;been pared off?"</p>

<p>"If," said Mahony stiffening, "if what you mean by that is, have
I allowed my mind to grow narrow and sluggish, I can honestly
answer no."</p>

<p>In his heart he denied the charge even more warmly; for, as he
spoke, he saw the great cork-slabs on which hundreds of moths and
butterflies made dazzling spots of colour; saw the sheets of pink
blotting-paper between which his collection of native plants lay
pressed; the glass case filled with geological specimens; his
Bible, the margins of which round Genesis were black with his
handwriting; a pile of books on the new marvel Spiritualism;
Colenso's <i>Pentateuch</i>; the big black volumes of the <i>Arcana
Coelestia</i>; Locke on Miracles: he saw all these things and more.
"No, I'm glad to say I have retained many interests outside my
work."</p>

<p>Tangye had taken off his spectacles and was polishing them on a
crumpled handkerchief. He seemed about to reply, even made a quick
half-turn towards Mahony; then thought better of it, and went on
rubbing. A smile played round his lips.</p>

<p>"And in conclusion let me say this," went on Mahony, not
unnettled by his companion's expression. "It's sheer folly to talk
about what life makes of us. Life is not an active force. It's we
who make what we will, of life. And in order to shape it to the
best of our powers, Mr. Tangye, to put our brief span to the best
possible use, we must never lose faith in God or our fellow-men;
never forget that, whatever happens, there is a sky, with stars in
it, above us."</p>

<p>"Ah, there's a lot of bunkum talked about life," returned Tangye
dryly, and settled his glasses on his nose. "And as man gets near
the end of it, he sees just <i>what</i> bunkum it is. Life's only
got one meanin', doctor; seen plain, there's only one object in
everything we do; and that's to keep a sound roof over our heads
and a bite in our mouths&mdash;and in those of the helpless
creatures who depend on us. The rest has no more sense or
significance than a nigger's hammerin' on the tam-tam. The lucky
one o' this world don't grasp it; but we others do; and after all
p'raps, it's worth while havin' gone through it to have got at
<i>one</i> bit of the truth, however, small. Good night."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel, and before his words were cold on the air
had vanished, leaving Mahony blankly staring.</p>

<p>The moonshine still bathed the earth, gloriously untroubled by
the bitterness of human words and thoughts. But the night seemed to
have grown chilly; and Mahony gave an involuntary shiver. "Some one
walking over my...now what would that specimen have called it? Over
the four by eight my remains will one day manure!"</p>

<p>"An odd, abusive, wrong-headed fellow," he mused, as he made his
way home. "Who would ever have thought, though, that the queer
little chemist had so much in him? A failure?...yes, he was right
there; and as unlovely as failures always are&mdash;at close
quarters." But as he laid his hands on the gate, he jerked up his
head and exclaimed half aloud: "God bless my soul! What he wanted
was not argument or reason but a little human sympathy." As usual,
however, the flash of intuition came too late. "For such a touchy
nature I'm certainly extraordinarily obtuse where the feelings of
others are concerned," he told himself as he hooked in the
latch.</p>

<p>"Why, Richard, where <i>have</i> you been?" came Mary's clear
voice&mdash;muted so as not to disturb John and Jinny, who had
retired to rest. Purdy and she sat waiting on the verandah. "Were
you called out? We've had time to clear everything away. Here,
dear, I saved you some sandwiches and a glass of claret. I'm sure
you didn't get any supper yourself, with looking after other
people."</p>

<p>Long after Mary had fallen asleep he lay wakeful. His foolish
blunder in response to Tangye's appeal rankled in his mind. He
could not get over his insensitiveness. How he had boasted of his
prosperity, his moral nicety, his saving pursuits&mdash;he to
boast!&mdash;when all that was asked of him was a kindly: "My poor
fellow soul, you have indeed fought a hard fight; but there
<i>is</i> a God above us who will recompense you at His own time,
take the word for it of one who has also been through the Slough of
Despond." And then just these...these hobbies of his, of which he
had made so much. Now that he was alone with himself he saw them in
a very different light. Lepidoptera collected years since were
still unregistered, plants and stones unclassified; his poor
efforts at elucidating the Bible waited to be brought into line
with the Higher Criticism; Home's levitations and fire-tests called
for investigation; while the leaves of some of the books he had
cited had never even been cut. The mere thought of these things was
provocative, rest-destroying. To induce drowsiness he went
methodically through the list of his acquaintances, and sought to
range them under one or other of Tangye's headings. And over this
there came moments when he lapsed into depths...fetched himself up
again&mdash;but with an effort...only to fall back...But he seemed
barely to have closed his eyes when the night-bell rang. In an
instant he was on his feet in the middle of the room, applying
force to his sleep-cogged wits.</p>

<p>He threw open the sash. "Who's there? What is it?"</p>

<p>Henry Ocock's groom. "I was to fetch you out to our place at
once, governor."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Is Mrs. Henry taken ill?"</p>

<p>"Not as I know of," said the man dryly. "But her and the boss
had a bit of a tiff on the way home, and Madam's excited-like."</p>

<p>"And am I to pay for their tiffs?" muttered Mahony hotly.</p>

<p>"Hush, Richard! He'll hear you," warned Mary, and sat up.</p>

<p>"I shall decline to go. Henry's a regular old woman."</p>

<p>Mary shook her head. "You can't afford to offend the Henrys. And
you know what he is so hasty. He'd call in some one else on the
spot, and you'd never get back. If only you hadn't stayed out so
long, dear, looking at the moon!"</p>

<p>"Good God! Mary, is one never to have a moment to oneself? Never
a particle of pleasure or relaxation?"</p>

<p>"Why, Richard!" expostulated his wife, and even felt a trifle
ashamed of his petulance. "What would you call to-night, I wonder?
Wasn't the whole evening one of pleasure and relaxation?"</p>

<p>And Mahony, struggling into shirt and trousers, had to admit
that he would be hard put to it to give it another name.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-4-4" id="ch-1-4-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>Hush, dolly! Mustn't cry, and make a noise. Uncle Richard's
cross.</p>

<p>Trotty sat on a hassock and rocked a china babe, with all the
appurtenant mother-fuss she had picked up from the tending of her
tiny stepsister. The present Trotty was a demure little maid of
some seven summers, who gave the impression of having been rather
rudely elongated. Her flaxen hair was stiffly imprisoned behind a
round black comb; and her big blue eyes alone remained to her from
a lovely infancy. ("Poor Emma's eyes," said Mary.)</p>

<p>Imitative as a monkey she went on&mdash;with a child's perfect
knowledge that it is all make-believe, yet with an entire credence
in the power of make-believe: "Naughty child&mdash;<i>will</i> you
be quiet? There! You've frown your counterpane off now. Wonder what
next you'll do. I declare I'll slap you soon&mdash;you make me so
cross."</p>

<p>Through the surgery-window the words floated out: "For goodness'
sake, don't bother me now with such trifles, Mary! It's not the
moment&mdash;with a whole string of people waiting in the other
room."</p>

<p>"Well, if only you'll be satisfied with what I do, dear, and not
blame me afterwards."</p>

<p>"Get Purdy to give you a hand with Ned's affair. He has time and
to spare." And wetting his finger-tip Mahony nervously flipped over
a dozen pages of the book that lay open before him.</p>

<p>"Well...if you think I should," said Mary, with a spice of
doubt.</p>

<p>"I do. And now go, wife, and remember to shut the door after
you. Oh, and tell that woman in the kitchen to stop singing. Her
false notes drive me crazy.&mdash;How many are there, this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Eight&mdash;no, nine, if that's another," replied Mary, with an
ear to the front door.</p>

<p>"Tch! I'll have to stop then," and Mahony clapped to the work he
had been consulting. "Never a minute to keep abreast of the times."
But: "That's a good, helpful wife," as Mary stooped to kiss him.
"Do the best you can, mavourneen, and never mind me."</p>

<p>"Take me with you, Auntie!" Trotty sprang up from her stool,
overturning babe and cradle.</p>

<p>"Not to-day, darling. Besides, why are you here? You know I've
forbidden you to be on the front verandah when the patients come.
Run away to the back, and play there."</p>

<p>Mary donned hat and shawl, opened her parasol and went out into
the sun. With the years she had developed into rather a stately
young woman: she held her head high and walked with a firm, free
step.</p>

<p>Her first visit was to the stable to find Long Jim&mdash;or Old
Jim as they now called him; for he was nearing the sixties. The
notice to leave, which he had given the day before, was one of the
"trifles" it fell to her to consider. Personally Mary thought his
going would be no great loss: he knew nothing about a garden, yet
resented instruction; and it had always been necessary to get
outside help in for the horses. If he went they could engage some
one who would combine the posts. But Richard had taken umbrage at
the old man's tone; had even been nervously upset over it. It
behoved her to find out what the matter was.</p>

<p>"I want a change," said Old Jim dourly in response to her
inquiry; and went on polishing wheel-spokes, and making the wheel
fly. "I've bin 'ere too long. An' now I've got a bit o' brass
together, an' am thinkin' I'd like to be me own master for a
spell."</p>

<p>"But at your age, Jim, is it wise?&mdash;to throw up a
comfortable home, just because you've laid a little past?"</p>

<p>"It's enough to keep me. I turned over between four and five
'undred last week in 'Piecrusts.'"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mary, taken by surprise. "Then that&mdash;that's your
only reason for wishing to leave?" And as he did not reply, but
went on swishing: "Come, Jim, if you've anything on your mind, say
it out. The doctor didn't like the way you spoke to him last
night."</p>

<p>At this the old man straightened his back, took a straw from
between his teeth, spat and said: "Well, if you must know, Mrs.
Mahony, the doctor's not the boss it pleases me to be h'under any
more&mdash;and that's the trewth. I'm tired of it&mdash;dog-tired.
You can slave yer 'ead off for 'im, and 'e never notices a thing
you do, h'or if 'e does, it's on'y to find fault. It h'ain't 'uman,
I say, and I'll be danged if I stand it h'any longer."</p>

<p>But people who came to Mary with criticism of Richard got no
mercy. "You're far too touchy, Jim. <i>you</i> know, if any one
does, how rushed and busy the doctor is, and you ought to be the
first to make allowance for him&mdash;after all he's done for you.
You wouldn't be here now, if it hadn't been for him. And then to
expect him to notice and praise you for every little job you
do!"</p>

<p>But Jim was stubborn. 'E didn't want to deny anything. But 'e'd
rather go. An' this day a week if it suited her.</p>

<p>"It's really dreadful how uppish the lower classes get as soon
as they have a little money in their pocket," she said to herself,
as she walked the shadeless, sandy road. But this thought was like
a shadow cast by her husband's mind on hers, and was ousted by the
more indigenous: "But after all who can blame him, poor old fellow,
for wanting to take life easy if he has the chance." She even
added: "He might have gone off, as most of them do, without a
word."</p>

<p>Then her mind reverted to what he had said of Richard, and she
pondered the antagonism that had shown through his words. It was
not the first time she had run up against this spirit, but, as
usual, she was at a loss to explain it. Why should people of Old
Jim's class dislike Richard as they did?&mdash;find him so hard to
get on with? He was invariably considerate of them, and treated
them very generously with regard to money. And yet...for some
reason or other they felt injured by him; and thought and spoke of
him with a kind of churlish resentment. She was not clever enough
to find the key to the riddle&mdash;it was no such simple
explanation as that he felt himself too good for them. That was not
the case: he was proud, certainly, but she had never known any one
who&mdash;under, it was true, a rather sarcastic manner&mdash;was
more broadly tolerant of his fellow-men. And she wound up her
soliloquy with the lame admission: "Yes, in spite of all his
kindness, I suppose he <i>is</i> queer...decidedly queer," and then
she heaved a sigh. What a pity it was! When you knew him to be, at
heart, such a dear, good, well-meaning man.</p>

<p>A short walk brought her to the four-roomed cottage where Ned
lived with wife and children. Or had lived, till lately. He had
been missing from his home now for over a week. On the last
occasion of his being in Melbourne with the carrying-van, he had
decamped, leaving the boy who was with him to make the return
journey alone. Since then, nothing could be heard of him; and his
billet in the Agency had been snapped up.</p>

<p>"Or so they say!" said his wife, with an angry sniff. "I don't
believe a word of it, Mary. Since the railway's come, biz has gone
to the dogs; and they're only too glad to get the chance of sacking
another man."</p>

<p>Polly looked untidier than ever; she wore a slatternly wrapper,
and her hair was thrust unbrushed into its net. But she suffered,
no doubt, in her own way; she was red-eyed, and very hasty-handed
with her nestful of babes. Sitting in the cheerless parlour, Ned's
dark-eyed eldest on her knee, Mary strove to soothe and encourage.
But: it has never been much of a home for the poor boy was her
private opinion; and she pressed her cheek affectionately against
the little black curly head that was a replica of Ned's own.</p>

<p>"What's goin' to become of us all, the Lord only knows," said
Polly, after having had the good cry the sympathetic presence of
her sister-in-law justified. "I'm not a brown cent troubled about
Ned&mdash;only boiling with 'im. 'E's off on the booze, sure
enough&mdash;and 'e'll turn up again, safe and sound, like loose
fish always do. Wait till I catch 'im though! He'll get it
hot."</p>

<p>"We never ought to have come here," she went on drying her eyes.
"Drat the place and all that's in it, that's what I say! He did
better'n this in Castlemaine; and I'd pa behind me there. But once
Richard had sent 'im that twenty quid, he'd no rest till he got
away. And I thought, when he was so set on it, may be it'd have a
good effect on 'im, to be near you both. But that was just another
shoot into the brown. You've been A1, Mary; you've done your level
best. But Richard's never treated Ned fair. I don't want to take
Ned's part; he's nothing in the world but a pretty-faced noodle.
But Richard's treated 'im as if he was the dirt under 'is feet. And
Ned's felt it. Oh, I know whose doing it was, we were never asked
up to the house when you'd company. It wasn't <i>yours</i>, my
dear! But we can't all have hyphens to our names, and go driving
round with kid gloves on our hands and our noses in the air."</p>

<p>Mary felt quite depressed by this fresh attack on her husband.
Reminding herself, however, that Polly was excited and
over-wrought, she did not speak out the defence that leapt to her
tongue. She said staunchly: "As you put it, Polly, it does seem as
if we haven't acted rightly towards Ned. But it wasn't Richard's
doing alone. I've been just as much to blame as he has."</p>

<p>She sat on, petting the fractious children and giving kindly
assurances: as long as she and Richard had anything themselves,
Ned's wife and Ned's children should not want: and as she spoke,
she slipped a substantial proof of her words into Polly's unproud
hand. Besides, she believed there was every chance now of Ned soon
being restored to them; and she told how they were going, that very
morning, to invoke Mr. Smith's aid. Mr. Smith was in the Police, as
Polly knew, and had influential friends among the Force in
Melbourne. By to-morrow there might be good news to bring her.</p>

<p>Almost an hour had passed when she rose to leave. Mrs. Ned was
so grateful for the visit and the help that, out in the narrow
little passage, she threw her arms round Mary's neck and drew her
to her bosom. Holding her thus, after several hearty kisses, she
said in a mysterious whisper, with her lips close to Mary's ear:
"Mary, love, may I say something to you?" and the permission
granted, went on: "That is, give you a bit of a hint, dearie?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course you may, Polly."</p>

<p>"Sure you won't feel hurt, dear?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. What is it?" and Mary disengaged herself, that she
might look the speaker in the face.</p>

<p>"Well, it's just this&mdash;you mentioned the name yourself, or
I wouldn't have dared. It's young Mr. Smith, Mary. My dear, in
future don't you have 'im quite so much about the house as you do
at present. It ain't the thing. People <i>will</i> talk, you know,
if you give 'em a handle." ("Oh, but Polly!" in a blank voice from
Mary.) "Now, now, I'm not blaming you&mdash;not the least
tiddly-wink. But there's no harm in being careful, is there, love,
if you don't want your name in people's mouths? I'm that fond of
you, Mary&mdash;you don't mind me speaking, dearie?"</p>

<p>"No, Polly, I don't. But it's the greatest nonsense&mdash;I
never heard such a thing!" said Mary hotly. "Why, Purdy is
Richard's oldest friend. They were schoolboys together."</p>

<p>"May be they were. But I hear 'e's mostly up at your place when
Richard's out. And you're a young and pretty woman, my dear; it's
Richard who ought to think of it, and he so much older than you.
Well, just take the hint, love. It comes best, don't it, from one
of the family?"</p>

<p>But Mary left the house in a sad flurry; and even forgot for a
street length to open her parasol.</p>

<p>Her first impulse was to go straight to Richard. But she had not
covered half a dozen yards before she saw that this would never do.
At the best of times Richard abominated gossip; and the fact of it
having, in the present case, dared to fasten its fangs in some one
belonging to him would make him doubly wroth. He might even try to
find out who had started the talk; and get himself into hot water
over it. Or he might want to lay all the blame on his own
shoulders&mdash;make himself the reproaches Ned's Polly had not
spared him. Worse still, he would perhaps accuse Purdy of
inconsiderateness towards her, and fly into a rage with him; and
then the two of them would quarrel, which would be a thousand
pities. For though he often railed at Purdy, yet that was only
Richard's way: he was genuinely fond of him, and unbent to him as
to nobody else.</p>

<p>But these were just so many pretexts put forward to herself by
Mary for keeping silence; the real reason lay deeper. Eight years
of married life had left her, where certain subjects were
concerned, with all the modesty of her girlhood intact. There were
things, indelicate things, which <i>could</i> not be spoken out,
even between husband and wife. For her to have to step before
Richard and say: some one else feels for me in the same way as you,
my husband, do, would make her ever after unable frankly to meet
his eyes. Besides giving the vague, cobwebby stuff a body it did
not deserve.</p>

<p>But yet again this was not the whole truth: she had another,
more uncomfortable side of it to face; and the flies buzzed
unheeded round her head. The astonishment she had shown at her
sister-in-law's warning had not been altogether sincere. Far down
in her heart Mary found a faint, faint trace of complicity. For
months past&mdash;she could admit it now&mdash;she had not felt
easy about Purdy. Something disagreeable, disturbing, had crept
into their relations. The jolly, brotherly manner she liked so well
had deserted him; besides short-tempered he had grown deadly
serious, and not the stupidest woman could fail altogether to see
what the matter was. But she had wilfully bandaged her eyes. And
if, now and then, some word or look had pierced her guard and
disquieted her in spite of herself, she had left it at an
incredulous: "Oh, but then...But even if...In that case..." She now
saw her fervent hope had been that the affair would blow over
without coming to anything; prove to be just another passing fancy
on the part of the unstable Purdy. How many had she not assisted
at! This very summer, for instance, a charming young lady from
Sydney had stayed with the Urquharts; and, as long as her visit
lasted, they had seen little or nothing of Purdy. Whenever he got
off duty he was at Yarangobilly. As it happened, however, Mr.
Urquhart himself had been so assiduous in taking his guest about
that Purdy had had small chance of making an impression. And, in
looking back on the incident, what now rose most clearly before
Mary's mind was the way in which Mrs. Urquhart&mdash;poor thing,
she was never able to go anywhere with her husband: either she had
a child in arms or another coming; the row of toddlers mounted up
in steps&mdash;the way in which she had said, with her pathetic
smile: "Ah, my dear! Willie needs some one gayer and stronger than
I am, for company." Mary's heart had been full of pity at the time,
for her friend's lot; and it swelled again now at the
remembrance.</p>

<p>But oh dear! this was straying from the point. Impatiently she
jerked her thoughts back to herself and her own dilemma. What ought
she to do? She was not a person who could sit still with folded
hands and await events. How would it be if she spoke to Purdy
herself?...talked seriously to him about his work?...tried to
persuade him to leave Ballarat. Did he mean to hang on here for
ever, she would say&mdash;never intend to seek promotion? But then
again, the mere questioning would cause a certain awkwardness.
While, at the slightest trip or blunder on her part, what was
unsaid might suddenly find itself said; and the whole thing cease
to be the vague, cloudy affair it was at present. And though she
would actually rather this happened with regard to Purdy than
Richard, yet...yet...Worried and perplexed, unable to see before
her the straight plain path she loved, Mary once more sighed from
the bottom of her heart.</p>

<p>"Oh if <i>only</i> men wouldn't be so foolish!"</p>

<p>Left to himself Mahony put away his books, washed his hands and
summoned one by one to his presence the people who waited in the
adjoining room. He drew a tooth, dressed a wounded wrist,
prescribed for divers internal disorders&mdash;all told, a baker's
dozen of odd jobs.</p>

<p>When the last patient had gone he propped open the door, wiped
his forehead and read the thermometer that hung on the wall: it
marked 102 degrees. Dejectedly he drove, in fancy, along the
glaring, treeless roads, inches deep in cinnamon-coloured dust. How
one learnt to hate the sun out here. What wouldn't he give for a
cool, grey-green Irish day, with a wet wind blowing in from the
sea?&mdash;a day such as he had heedlessly squandered hundreds of,
in his youth. Now it made his mouth water only to think of
them.</p>

<p>It still wanted ten minutes to ten o'clock and the buggy had not
yet come round. He would lie down and have five minutes' rest
before starting: he had been up most of the night, and on getting
home had been kept awake by neuralgia.</p>

<p>When an hour later Mary reached home, she was amazed to find
groom and buggy still drawn up in front of the house.</p>

<p>"Why, Molyneux, what's the matter? Where's the doctor?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know, Mrs. Mahony. I've hollered to Biddy half
a dozen times, but she doesn't take any notice. And the mare's that
restless...There, there, steady old girl, steady now! It's these
damn flies."</p>

<p>Mary hurried indoors. "Why, Biddy..."</p>

<p>"Sure and it's yourself," said the big Irishwoman who now filled
the kitchen-billet. "Faith and though you scold me, Mrs. Mahony, I
couldn't bring it over me heart to wake him. The pore man's
sleeping like a saint."</p>

<p>"Biddy, you ought to know better!" cried Mary peeling off her
gloves.</p>

<p>"It's pale as the dead he is."</p>

<p>"Rubbish. It's only the reflection of the green blind.
<i>Richard!</i> Do you know what the time is?"</p>

<p>But the first syllable of his name was enough. "Good Lord, Mary,
I must have dropped off. What the dickens...Come, help me, wife.
Why on earth didn't those fools wake me?"</p>

<p>Mary held his driving-coat, fetched hat and gloves, while he
flung the necessaries into his bag. "Have you much to do this
morning? Oh, that post-mortem's at twelve, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and a consultation with Munce at eleven&mdash;I'll just
manage it and no more," muttered Mahony with an eye on his watch.
"I can't let the mare take it easy this morning. Yes, a full day.
And Henry Ocock's fidgeting for a second opinion; thinks his wife's
not making enough progress. Well, ta-ta, sweetheart! Don't expect
me back to lunch." And taking a short cut across the lawn, he
jumped into the buggy and off they flew.</p>

<p>Mary's thoughts were all for him in this moment. "How proud we
ought to feel!" she said to herself. "That makes the second time in
a week old Munce has sent for him. But how like Henry Ocock," she
went on with puckered brow. "It's quite insulting&mdash;after the
trouble Richard has put himself to. If Agnes's case puzzles him, I
should like to know who will understand it better. I think I'll go
and see her myself this afternoon. It can't be <i>her</i> wish to
call in a stranger."</p>

<p>Not till some time after did she remember her own private
embarrassment. And, by then, the incident had taken its proper
place in her mind&mdash;had sunk to the level of insignificance to
which it belonged.</p>

<p>"Such a piece of nonsense!" was her final verdict. "As if I
could worry Richard with it, when he has so many really important
things to occupy him."</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-4-5" id="ch-1-4-5"></a>Chapter V</h3>

<p>Yes, those were palmy days; the rate at which the practice
spread astonished even himself. No slack seasons for him now;
winter saw him as busy as summer; and his chief ground for
complaint was that he was unable to devote the meticulous attention
he would have wished to each individual case. "It would need the
strength of an elephant to do that." But it was impossible not to
feel gratified by the many marks of confidence he received. And if
his work had but left him some leisure for study and an occasional
holiday, he would have been content. But in these years he was
never able to get his neck out of the yoke; and Mary took her
annual jaunts to Melbourne and sea-breezes alone.</p>

<p>In a long talk they had with each other, it was agreed that,
except in an emergency, he was to be chary of entering into fresh
engagements&mdash;this referred in the first place to confinements,
of which his book was always full; and secondly, to outlying
bush-cases, the journey to and from which wasted many a precious
hour. And where it would have been impolitic to refuse a new and
influential patient, some one on his list &mdash;a doubtful payer
or a valetudinarian&mdash;was gently to be let drop. And it was
Mary who arranged who this should be. Some umbrage was bound to be
given in the process; but with her help it was reduced to a
minimum. For Mary knew by heart all the links and ramifications of
the houses at which he visited; knew precisely who was related to
whom, by blood or marriage or business; knew where offence might
with safety be risked, and where it would do him harm. She had also
a woman's tact in smoothing things over. A born doctor's wife,
declared Mahony in grateful acknowledgment. For himself he could
not keep such fiddling details in his head for two minutes on
end.</p>

<p>But though he thus succeeded in setting bounds to his activity,
he still had a great deal too much to do; and, in tired moments, or
when tic plagued him, thought the sole way out of the impasse would
be to associate some one with him as partner or assistant. And once
he was within an ace of doing so, chance throwing what he
considered a likely person across his path. In attending a
coroner's inquest, he made the acquaintance of a member of the
profession who was on his way from the Ovens district&mdash;a coach
journey of well over two hundred miles&mdash;to a place called
Walwala, a day's ride to the west of Ballarat. And since this was a
pleasant-spoken man and intelligent&mdash;though with a somewhat
down-at-heel look&mdash;besides being a stranger to the town,
Mahony impulsively took him home to dinner. In the evening they sat
and talked. The visitor, whose name was Wakefield, was considerably
Mahony's senior. By his own account he had had but a rough time of
it for the past couple of years. A good practice which he had
worked up in the seaport of Warrnambool had come to an untimely
end. He did not enter into the reasons for this. "I was
unfortunate...had a piece of ill-luck," was how he referred to it.
And knowing how fatally easy was a trip in diagnosis, a slip of the
scalpel, Mahony tactfully helped him over the allusion. From
Warrnambool Wakefield had gone to the extreme north of the colony;
but the eighteen months spent there had nearly been his undoing.
Money had not come in badly; but his wife and family had suffered
from the great heat, and the scattered nature of the work had worn
him to skin and bone. He was now casting about him for a more
suitable place. He could not afford to buy a practice, must just
creep in where he found a vacancy. And Walwala, where he understood
there had never been a resident practitioner, seemed to offer an
opening.</p>

<p>Mahony felt genuinely sorry for the man; and after he had gone
sat and revolved the idea, in the event of Walwala proving
unsuitable, of taking Wakefield on as his assistant. He went to bed
full of the scheme and broached it to Mary before they slept. Mary
made big eyes to herself as she listened. Like a wise wife,
however, she did not press her own views that night, while the idea
bubbled hot in him; for, at such times, when some new project
seemed to promise the millennium, he stood opposition badly. But
she lay awake telling off the reasons she would put before him in
the morning; and in the dark allowed herself a tender, tickled
little smile at his expense.</p>

<p>"What a man he is for loading himself up with the wrong sort of
people!" she reflected. "And then afterwards, he gets tired of
them, and impatient with them&mdash;as is only natural."</p>

<p>At breakfast she came back on the subject herself. In her
opinion, he ought to think the matter over very carefully. Not
another doctor on Ballarat had an assistant; and his patients would
be sure to resent the novelty. Those who sent for Dr. Mahony would
not thank you to be handed over to "goodness knows who."</p>

<p>"Besides, Richard, as things are now, the money wouldn't really
be enough, would it? And just as we have begun to be a little easy
ourselves&mdash;I'm afraid you'd miss many comforts you have got
used to again, dear," she wound up, with a mental glance at the
fine linen and smooth service Richard loved.</p>

<p>Yes, that was true, admitted Mahony with a sigh; and being this
morning in a stale mood, he forthwith knocked flat the card-house
it had amused him to build. Himself he had only half believed in
it; or believed so long as he refrained from going into prosaic
details. There was work for two and money for one&mdash;that was
the crux of the matter. Successful as the practice was, it still
did not throw off a thousand a year. Bad debts ran to a couple of
hundred annually; and their improved style of living&mdash;the
expenses of house and garden, of horses and vehicles, the
men-servants, the open house they had to keep&mdash;swallowed every
penny of the rest. Saving was actually harder than when his income
had been but a third of what it was at present. New obligations
beset him. For one thing, he had to keep pace with his colleagues;
make a show of being just as well-to-do as they. Retrenching was
out of the question. His patients would at once imagine that
something was wrong&mdash;the practice on the downgrade, his skill
deserting him&mdash;and take their ailments and their fees
elsewhere. No, the more one had, the more one was forced to spend;
and the few odd hundreds for which Henry Ocock could yearly be
counted on came in very handy. As a rule he laid these by for
Mary's benefit; for her visits to Melbourne, her bonnets and gowns.
It also let her satisfy the needs of her generous little heart in
matters of hospitality&mdash;well, it was perhaps not fair to lay
the whole blame of their incessant and lavish entertaining at her
door. He himself knew that it would not do for them to lag a foot
behind other people.</p>

<p>Hence the day on which he would be free to dismiss the subject
of money from his mind seemed as far off as ever. He might indulge
wild schemes of taking assistant or partner; the plain truth was,
he could not afford even the sum needed to settle in a <i>locum
tenens</i> for three months, while he recuperated.&mdash;Another
and equally valid reason was that the right man for a <i>locum</i>
was far to seek. As time went on, he found himself pushed more and
more into a single branch of medicine&mdash;one, too, he had never
meant to let grow over his head in this fashion. For it was common
medical knowledge out here that, given the distances and the
general lack of conveniences, thirty to forty maternity cases per
year were as much as a practitioner could with comfort take in
hand. <i>his</i> books for the past year stood at over a hundred!
The nightwork this meant was unbearable, infants showing a perverse
disinclination to enter the world except under cover of the
dark.</p>

<p>His popularity&mdash;if such it could be called&mdash;with the
other sex was something of a mystery to him. For he had not one
manner for the bedside and another for daily life. He never sought
to ingratiate himself with people, or to wheedle them; still less
would he stoop to bully or intimidate; was always by preference the
adviser rather than the dictator. And men did not greatly care for
this arm's-length attitude; they wrote him down haughty and
indifferent, and pinned their faith to a blunter, homelier manner.
But with women it was otherwise; and these also appreciated the
fact that, no matter what their rank in life, their age or their
looks, he met them with the deference he believed due to their sex.
Exceptions there were, of course. Affectation or insincerity
angered him&mdash;with the "Zaras" of this world he had scant
patience&mdash;while among the women themselves, some
few&mdash;Ned's wife, for example&mdash;felt resentment at his very
appearance, his gestures, his tricks of speech. But the majority
were his staunch partisans; and it was becoming more and more the
custom to engage Dr. Mahony months ahead, thus binding him fast.
And though he would sometimes give Mary a fright by vowing that he
was going to "throw up mid. and be done with it," yet her
ambition&mdash;and what an ambitious wife she was, no one but
himself knew&mdash;that he should some day become one of the
leading specialists on Ballarat, seemed not unlikely of fulfilment.
If his health kept good. And...and if he could possibly hold
out!</p>

<p>For there still came times when he believed that to turn his
back for ever, on place and people, would make him the happiest of
mortals. For a time this idea had left him in peace. Now it haunted
him again. Perhaps, because he had at last grasped the unpalatable
truth that it would never be his luck to save: if saving were the
only key to freedom, he would still be there, still chained fast,
and though he lived to be a hundred. Certain it was, he did not
become a better colonist as the years went on. He had learnt to
hate the famous climate&mdash;the dust and drought and brazen
skies; the drenching rains and bottomless mud&mdash;to rebel
against the interminable hours he was doomed to spend in his buggy.
By nature he was a recluse&mdash;not an outdoor-man at all. He was
tired, too, of the general rampage, the promiscuous connexions and
slap-dash familiarity of colonial life; sick to death of the
all-absorbing struggle to grow richer than his neighbours. He
didn't give a straw for money in itself&mdash;only for what it
brought him. And what was the good of that, if he had no leisure to
enjoy it? Or was it the truth that he feared being dragged into the
vortex?...of learning to care, he, too, whether or no his name
topped subscription-lists; whether his entertainments were the most
sumptuous, his wife the best-dressed woman in her set? Perish the
thought!</p>

<p>He did not disquiet Mary by speaking of these things. Still less
did he try to explain to her another, more elusive side of the
matter. It was this. Did he dig into himself, he saw that his
uncongenial surroundings were not alone to blame for his restless
state of mind. There was in him a gnawing desire for change as
change; a distinct fear of being pinned for too long to the same
spot; or, to put it another way, a conviction that to live on
without change meant decay. For him, at least. Of course, it was
absurd to yield to feelings of this kind; at his age, in his
position, with a wife dependent on him. And so he fought
them&mdash;even while he indulged them. For this was the year in
which, casting the question of expense to the winds, he pulled down
and rebuilt his house. It came over him one morning on waking that
he could not go on in the old one for another day, so cramped was
he, so tortured by its lath-and-plaster thinness. He had difficulty
in winning Mary over; she was against the outlay, the trouble and
confusion involved; and was only reconciled by the more solid
comforts and greater conveniences offered her. For the new house
was of brick, the first brick house to be built on Ballarat (and oh
the joy! said Richard, of walls so thick that you could not hear
through them), had an extra-wide verandah which might be curtained
in for parties and dances, and a side-entrance for patients, such
as Mary had often sighed for.</p>

<p>As a result of the new grandeur, more and more flocked to his
door. The present promised to be a record year even in the annals
of the Golden City. The completion of the railway-line to Melbourne
was the outstanding event. Virtually halving the distance to the
metropolis in count of time, it brought a host of fresh people
capitalists, speculators, politicians&mdash;about the town, and
money grew perceptibly easier. Letters came more quickly, too;
Melbourne newspapers could be handled almost moist from the press.
One no longer had the sense of lying shut off from the world,
behind the wall of a tedious coach journey. And the merry
Ballaratians, who had never feared or shrunk from the discomforts
of this journey, now travelled constantly up and down: attending
the Melbourne race-meetings; the Government House balls and
lawn-parties; bringing back the gossip of Melbourne, together with
its fashions in dress, music and social life.</p>

<p>Mary, in particular, profited by the change; for in one of those
"general posts" so frequently played by the colonial cabinet, John
Turnham had come out Minister of Railways; and she could have a
"free pass" for the asking. John paid numerous visits to his
constituency; but he was now such an important personage that his
relatives hardly saw him. As likely as not he was the guest of the
Henry Ococks in their new mansion, or of the mayor of the borough.
In the past two years Mahony had only twice exchanged a word with
his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>And then they met again.</p>

<p>In Melbourne, at six o'clock one January morning, the Honourable
John, about to enter a saloon-compartment of the Ballarat train,
paused, with one foot on the step, and disregarding the polite
remarks of the station-master at his heels, screwed up his
prominent black eyes against the sun. At the farther end of the
train, a tall, thin, fair-whiskered man was peering disconsolately
along a row of crowded carriages. "God bless me! isn't that...Why,
so it is!" And leaving the official standing, John walked smartly
down the platform.</p>

<p>"My dear Mahony!&mdash;this is indeed a surprise. I had no idea
you were in town."</p>

<p>"Why not have let me know you proposed coming?" he inquired as
they made their way, the train meanwhile held up on their account,
towards John's spacious, reserved saloon.</p>

<p>("What he means is, why I didn't beg a pass of him.") And
Mahony, who detested asking favours, laid exaggerated emphasis on
his want of knowledge. He had not contemplated the journey till an
hour beforehand. Then, the proposed delegate having been suddenly
taken ill, he had been urgently requested to represent the Masonic
Lodge to which he belonged, at the Installation of a new Grand
Master.</p>

<p>"Ah, so you found it possible to get out of harness for once?"
said John affably, as they took their seats.</p>

<p>"Yes, by a lucky chance I had no case on hand that could not do
without me for twenty-four hours. And my engagement-book I can
leave with perfect confidence to my wife."</p>

<p>"Mary is no doubt a very capable woman; I noticed that afresh,
when last she was with us," returned John; and went on to tick off
Mary's qualities like a connoisseur appraising the points of a
horse. "A misfortune that she is not blessed with any family," he
added.</p>

<p>Mahony stiffened; and responded dryly: "I'm not sure that I
agree with you. With all her energy and spirit Mary is none too
strong."</p>

<p>"Well, well! these things are in the hands of Providence; we
must take what is sent us." And caressing his bare chin John gave a
hearty yawn.</p>

<p>The words flicked Mahony's memory: John had had an addition to
his family that winter, in the shape&mdash;to the disappointment of
all concerned&mdash;of a second daughter. He offered belated
congratulations. "A regular Turnham this time, according to Mary.
But I am sorry to hear Jane has not recovered her strength."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jane is doing very well. But it has been a real
disadvantage that she could not nurse. The infant is...well,
ah...perfectly formed, of course, but small&mdash;small."</p>

<p>"You must send them both to Mary, to be looked after."</p>

<p>The talk then passed to John's son, now a schoolboy in Geelong;
and John admitted that the reports he received of the lad continued
as unsatisfactory as ever. "The young rascal has ability, they tell
me, but no application." John propounded various theories to
account for the boy having turned out poorly, chief among which was
that he had been left too long in the hands of women. They had
overindulged him. "Mary no more than the rest, my dear fellow," he
hastened to smooth Mahony's rising plumes. "It began with his
mother in the first place. Yes, poor Emma was weak with the
boy&mdash;lamentably weak!"</p>

<p>Here, with a disconcerting abruptness, he drew to him a blue
linen bag that lay on the seat, and loosening its string took out a
sheaf of official papers, in which he was soon engrossed. He had
had enough of Mahony's conversation in the meantime, or so it
seemed; had thought of something better to do, and did it.</p>

<p>His brother-in-law eyed him as he read. "He's a bad colour. Been
living too high, no doubt."</p>

<p>A couple of new books were on the seat by Mahony; but he did not
open them. He had a tiring day behind him, and the briefest of
nights. Besides attending the masonic ceremony, which had lasted
into the small hours, he had undertaken to make various purchases,
not the least difficult of which was the buying of a present for
Mary&mdash;all the little fal-lals that went to finish a lady's
ball-dress. Railway-travelling was, too, something of a novelty to
him nowadays; and he sat idly watching the landscape unroll, and
thinking of nothing in particular. The train was running through
mile after mile of flat, treeless country, liberally sprinkled with
trapstones and clumps of tussock grass, which at a distance could
be mistaken for couched sheep. Here and there stood a solitary
she-oak, most doleful of trees, its scraggy, pine-needle foliage
bleached to grey. From the several little stations along the line:
mere three-sided sheds, which bore a printed invitation to
intending passengers to wave a flag or light a lamp, did they wish
to board the train: from these shelters long, bare, red roads,
straight as ruled lines, ran back into the heart of the burnt-up,
faded country. Now and then a moving ruddy cloud on one of them
told of some vehicle crawling its laborious way.</p>

<p>When John, his memoranda digested, looked up ready to resume
their talk, he found that Mahony was fast asleep; and, since his
first words, loudly uttered, did not rouse him, he took out his
case, chose a cigar, beheaded it and puffed it alight.</p>

<p>While he smoked, he studied his insensible relative. Mahony was
sitting uncomfortably hunched up; his head had fallen forward and
to the side, his mouth was open, his gloved hands lay limp on his
knee.</p>

<p>"H'm!" said John to himself as he gazed. And: "H'm," he repeated
after an interval.&mdash;Then pulling down his waistcoat and
generally giving himself a shake to rights, he reflected that, for
his own two-and-forty years, he was a very well preserved man
indeed.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-1-4-6" id="ch-1-4-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>"Oh, Richard!...and my dress is blue," said Mary distractedly,
and sitting back on her heels let her arms fall to her sides. She
was on her knees, and before her lay a cardboard box from which she
had withdrawn a pink fan, pink satin boots with stockings to match,
and a pink head-dress.</p>

<p>"Well, why the dickens didn't you say so?" burst out the
giver.</p>

<p>"I did, dear. As plainly as I could speak."</p>

<p>"Never heard a word!"</p>

<p>"Because you weren't listening. I told you so at the time. Now
what am I to do?" and, in her worry over the contretemps, Mary
quite forgot to thank her husband for the trouble he had been to on
her behalf.</p>

<p>"Get another gown to go with them."</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard...how like a man! After all the time and money this
one has cost me. No, I couldn't do that. Besides, Agnes Ocock is
wearing pink and wouldn't like it." And with a forehead full of
wrinkles she slowly began to replace the articles in their sheaths.
"Of course they're very nice," she added, as her fingers touched
the delicate textures.</p>

<p>"They would need to be, considering what I paid for them. I wish
now I'd kept my money in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Well, your mistake is hardly my fault, is it, dear?" But
Richard had gone off in a mood midway between self-annoyance and
the huff.</p>

<p>Mary's first thought was to send the articles to Jinny with a
request to exchange them for their counterparts in the proper
colour. Then she dismissed the idea. Blind slave to her nursery
that Jinny was, she would hardly be likely to give the matter her
personal supervision: the box would just be returned to the shop,
and the transfer left to the shop-people's discretion. They might
even want to charge more. No, another plan now occurred to Mary.
Agnes Ocock might not yet have secured the various small extras to
go with her ball-dress; and, if not, how nice it would be to make
her a present of these. They were finer, in better taste, than
anything to be had on Ballarat; and she had long owed Agnes some
return for her many kindnesses. Herself she would just make do with
the simpler things she could buy in town. And so, without saying
anything to Richard, who would probably have objected that Henry
Ocock was well able to afford to pay for his own wife's finery,
Mary tied up the box and drove to Plevna House, on the outer edge
of Yuille's Swamp.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I could never have got myself such beautiful things as
these, Mary," and Mrs. Henry let her hands play lovingly with the
silk stockings, her pretty face a-glow with pleasure. "Henry has no
understanding, dear, for the etceteras of a costume. He thinks, if
he pays for a dress or a mantle, that that is enough; and when the
<i>little</i> bills come in, he grumbles at what he calls my
extravagance. I sometimes wish, Mary, I had kept back just a
teeny-weeny bit of my own money. Henry would never have missed it,
and I should have been able to settle a small bill for myself now
and then. But you know how it is at first, love. Our one idea is to
hand over all we possess to our lord and master." She tried on the
satin boots; they were a little long, but she would stuff the toes
with wadding. "If I am <i>really</i> not robbing you, Mary?"</p>

<p>Mary reassured her, and thereupon a visit was paid to the
nursery, where Mr. Henry's son and heir lay sprawling in his
cradle. Afterwards they sat and chatted on the verandah, while a
basket was being filled with peaches for Mary to take home.</p>

<p>Not even the kindly drapery of a morning-wrapper could conceal
the fact that Agnes was growing stout&mdash;quite losing her fine
figure. That came of her having given up riding-exercise. And all
to please Mr. Henry. He did not ride himself, and felt nervous or
perhaps a little jealous when his wife was on horseback.</p>

<p>She was still very pretty of course&mdash;though by daylight the
fine bloom of her cheeks began to break up into a network of tiny
veins&mdash;and her fair, smooth brow bore no trace of the tragedy
she has gone through. The double tragedy; for, soon after the
master of Dandaloo's death in a Melbourne lunatic asylum, the
little son of the house had died, not yet fourteen years of age, in
an Inebriate's Home. Far was it from Mary to wish her friend to
brood or repine; but to have ceased to remember as utterly as Agnes
had done had something callous about it; and, in her own heart,
Mary devoted a fresh regret to the memory of the poor little
stepchild of fate.</p>

<p>The ball for which all these silken niceties were destined had
been organised to raise funds for a public monument to the two
explorers, Burke and Wills, and was to be one of the grandest ever
given in Ballarat. His Excellency the Governor would, it was hoped,
be present in person; the ladies had taken extraordinary pains with
their toilettes. and there had been the usual grumblings at expense
on the part of the husbands&mdash;though not a man but wished and
privately expected <i>his</i> wife "to take the shine out of all
the rest."</p>

<p>Mary had besought Richard to keep that evening free&mdash;it was
her lot always to go out to entertainments under some one else's
wing&mdash;and he had promised to do his utmost. But, a burnt child
in this respect, Mary said she would believe it when she saw it;
and the trend of events justified her scepticism. The night
arrived; she was on the point of adjusting her wreath of
forget-me-nots before her candle-lit mirror, when the dreaded
summons came. Mahony had to change and hurry off, without a
moment's delay.</p>

<p>"Send for Purdy. He'll see you across," he said as he banged the
front door.</p>

<p>But Mary despatched the gardener at a run with a note to Tilly
Ocock, who, she knew, would make room for her in her double-seated
buggy.</p>

<p>Grindle got out, and Mary, her bunchy skirts held to her, took
his place at the back beside Mrs. Amelia. Tilly sat next the
driver, and talked to them over her shoulder&mdash;a great big
jolly rattle of a woman, who ruled her surroundings
autocratically.</p>

<p>"Lor, no&mdash;we left 'im counting eggs," she answered an
inquiry on Mary's part. "Pa's got a brood of Cochin Chinas that's
the pride and glory of 'is heart. And 'e's built 'imself the
neatest little place for 'em you could meet on a summer's day: you
<i>must</i> come over and admire it, my dear &mdash;that'll please
'im, no end. It was a condition I made for 'is going on keeping
fowls. They were a perfect nuisance, all over the garden and round
the kitchen and the back, till it wasn't safe to put your foot down
anywhere&mdash;fowls <i>are</i> such messy things! At last I up and
said I wouldn't have it any longer. So then 'e and Tom set to work
and built themselves a fowl-house and a run. And there they spend
their days thinking out improvements."</p>

<p>Here Tilly gave the driver a cautionary dig with her elbow; as
she did this, an under-pocket chinked ominously. "Look out now,
Davy, what you're doing with us!&mdash;Yes, that's splosh, Mary. I
always bring a bag of change with me, my dear, so that those who
lose shan't have an excuse for not paying up." Tilly was going to
pass her evening, as usual, at the card-table. "Well, I hope you
two'll enjoy yourselves. Remember now, Mrs. Grindle, if you please,
that you're a married woman and must behave yourself, and not go in
for any high jinks," she teased her prim little stepdaughter, as
they dismounted from the conveyance and stood straightening their
petticoats at the entrance to the hall.</p>

<p>"You know, Matilda, I do not intend to dance to-night," said Mrs
Amelia in her sedate fashion: it was as if she sampled each word
before parting with it.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, bless you! and know why, too. If only it's not
another false alarm! Poor old pa' so like to have a grandchild 'e
was allowed to carry round. 'E mustn'n go near Henry's, of course,
for fear the kid 'ud swallow one of 'is dropped aitches and choke
over it." And Tilly threw back her head and laughed. "But you must
hurry up, Mely, you know, if you want to oblige 'im."</p>

<p>"Really, Tilly!" expostulated Mary. ("She sometimes <i>does</i>
go too far," she thought to herself. "The poor little woman!") "Let
us two keep together," she said as she took Amelia's arm. "I don't
intend to dance much either, as my husband isn't here."</p>

<p>But once inside the gaily decorated hall, she found it
impossible to keep her word. Even on her way to a seat beside Agnes
Ocock she was repeatedly stopped, and, when she sat down, up came
first one, then another, to "request the pleasure." She could not
go on refusing everybody: if she did, it would look as if she
deliberately set out to be peculiar&mdash;a horrible thought to
Mary. Besides, many of those who made their bow were important,
influential gentlemen; for Richard's sake she must treat them
politely.</p>

<p>For his sake, again, she felt pleased; rightly or wrongly she
put the many attentions shown her down to the fact of her being his
wife. So she turned and offered apologies to Agnes and Amelia,
feeling at the same time thankful that Richard had not Mr. Henry's
jealous disposition. There sat Agnes, looking as pretty as a
picture, and was afraid to dance with any one but her own husband.
And he preferred to play at cards!</p>

<p>"I think, dear, you might have ventured to accept the Archdeacon
for a quadrille," she whispered behind her fan, as Agnes
regretfully declined Mr. Long.</p>

<p>But Agnes shook her head. "It's better not, Mary. It saves
trouble afterwards. Henry <i>doesn't</i> care to see it." Perhaps
Agnes herself, once a passionate dancer, was growing a little too
comfortable, thought Mary, as her own programme wandered from hand
to hand.</p>

<p>Among the last to arrive was Purdy, red with haste, and making a
great thump with his lame leg as he crossed the floor.</p>

<p>"I'm beastly late, Polly. What have you got left for me?"</p>

<p>"Why, really nothing, Purdy. I thought you weren't coming. But
you may put your name down here if you like," and Mary handed him
her programme with her thumb on an empty space: she generally made
a point of sitting out a dance with Purdy that he might not feel
neglected; and of late she had been especially careful not to let
him notice any difference in her treatment of him. But when he gave
back the card she found that he had scribbled his initials in all
three blank lines. "Oh, you mustn't do that. I'm saving those for
Richard."</p>

<p>"Our dance, I believe, Mrs. Mahony?" said a deep voice as the
band struck up "The Rat Quadrilles." And, swaying this way and that
in her flounced blue tarletan, Mary rose, put her hand within the
proffered crook, and went off with the Police Magistrate, an
elderly greybeard; went to walk or be teetotumed through the
figures of the dance, with the supremely sane unconcern that she
displayed towards all the arts.</p>

<p>"What odd behaviour!" murmured Mrs. Henry, following Purdy's
retreating form with her eyes. "He took no notice of us whatever.
And did you see, Amelia, how he stood and stared after Mary? Quite
rudely, I thought."</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Grindle was forced to express an opinion of her
own&mdash;always a trial for the nervous little woman. "I think
it's because dear Mary looks so charming to-night, Agnes," she
ventured in her mouselike way. Then moved up to make room for
Archdeacon Long, who laid himself out to entertain the ladies.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>It was after midnight when Mahony reached home. He would rather
have gone to bed, but having promised Mary to put in an appearance,
he changed and walked down to the town.</p>

<p>The ball was at its height. He skirted the rotating couples,
seeking Mary. Friends hailed him.</p>

<p>"Ah, well done, doctor!"</p>

<p>"Still in time for a spin, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you seen my wife?"</p>

<p>"Indeed and I have. Mrs. Mahony's the belle o' the ball."</p>

<p>"Pleased to hear it. Where is she now?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Mahony, we've had a reg'lar dispute," cried Willie
Urquhart pressing up; he was flushed and decidedly garrulous.
"Almost came to blows we did, over whose was the finest pair o'
shoulders&mdash;your wife's or Henry O.'s. I plumped for Mrs. M.,
and I b'lieve she topped the poll. By Jove! that blue gown makes
'em look just like...what shall I say?...like marble."</p>

<p>"Does fortune smile?" asked Mahony of Henry Ocock as he passed
the card-players: he had cut Urquhart short with a nod. "So his
Excellency didn't turn up, after all?"</p>

<p>"Sent a telegraphic communication at the last moment. No, I
haven't seen her. But stay, there's Matilda wanting to speak to
you, I believe."</p>

<p>Tilly was making all manner of signs to attract his
attention.</p>

<p>"Good evening, doctor. Yes, I've a message. You'll find 'er in
the cloakroom. She's been in there for the last half-'our or so. I
think she's got the headache or something of that sort, and is
waiting for you to take 'er home."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank goodness, there you are, Richard!" cried Mary as he
opened the door of the cloakroom; and she rose from the bench on
which she had been sitting with her shawl wrapped round her. "I
thought you'd never come." She was pale, and looked distressed.</p>

<p>"Why, what's wrong, my dear?...feeling faint?" asked Mahony
incredulously. "If so, you had better wait for the buggy. It won't
be long now; you ordered it for two o'clock."</p>

<p>"No, no, I'm not ill, I'd rather walk," said Mary breathlessly.
"Only please let us get away. And without making a fuss."</p>

<p>"But what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you as we go. No, these boots won't hurt. And I can
walk in them quite well. Fetch your own things, Richard." Her one
wish was to get her husband out of the building.</p>

<p>They stepped into the street; it was a hot night and very dark.
In her thin satin dancing-boots, Mary leaned heavily on Richard's
arm, as they turned off the street-pavements into the unpaved
roads.</p>

<p>Mahony let the lights of the main street go past; then said:
"And now, Madam Wife, you'll perhaps be good enough to enlighten me
as to what all this means?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I will," answered Mary obediently. But her voice
trembled; and Mahony was sharp of hearing.</p>

<p>"Why, Polly sweetheart...surely nothing serious?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. I've had a very unpleasant experience this evening,
Richard &mdash;very unpleasant indeed. I hardly know how to tell
you. I feel so upset."</p>

<p>"Come&mdash;out with it!"</p>

<p>In a low voice, with downcast eyes, Mary told her story. All had
gone well till about twelve o'clock: she had danced with this
partner and that, and thoroughly enjoyed herself. Then came Purdy's
turn. She was with Mrs. Long when he claimed her, and she at once
suggested that they should sit out the dance on one of the settees
placed round the hall, where they could amuse themselves by
watching the dancers. But Purdy took no notice&mdash;"He was
strange in his manner from the very beginning" &mdash;and led her
into one of the little rooms that opened off the main body of the
hall.</p>

<p>"And I didn't like to object. We were conspicuous enough as it
was, his foot made such a bumping noise; it was worse than ever
to-night, I thought."</p>

<p>For the same reason, though she had felt uncomfortable at being
hidden away in there, she had not cared to refuse to stay: it
seemed to make too much of the thing. Besides, she hoped some other
couple would join them. But&mdash; "But, Mary...!" broke from
Mahony; he was blank and bewildered.</p>

<p>Purdy, however, had got up after a moment or two and shut the
door. And then&mdash;"Oh, it's no use, Richard, I can't tell you!"
said poor Mary. "I don't know how to get the words over my lips. I
think I've never felt so ashamed in all my life." And, worn out by
the worry and excitement she had gone through, and afraid, in
advance, of what she had still to face, Mary began to cry.</p>

<p>Mahony stood still; let her arm drop. "Do you mean me to
understand," he demanded, as if unable to believe his ears: "to
understand that Purdy...dared to...that he dared to behave to you
in any but a&mdash;" And since Mary was using her
pocket-handkerchief and could not reply: "Good God! Has the fellow
taken leave of his senses? Is he mad? Was he drunk? Answer me! What
does it all mean?" And Mary still continuing silent, he threw off
the hand she had replaced on his arm. "Then you must walk home
alone. I'm going back to get at the truth of this."</p>

<p>But Mary clung to him. "No, no, you must hear the whole story
first." Anything rather than let him return to the hall. Yes, at
first she thought he really had gone mad. "I can't tell you what I
felt, Richard...knowing it was Purdy&mdash;just Purdy. To see him
like that&mdash;looking so horrible&mdash;and to have to listen to
the dreadful things he said! Yes, I'm sure he had had too too much
to drink. His breath smelt so." She had tried to pull away her
hands; but he had held her, had put his arms round her.</p>

<p>At the anger she felt racing through her husband she tightened
her grip, stringing meanwhile phrase to phrase with the sole idea
of getting him safely indoors. Not till they were shut in the
bedroom did she give the most humiliating detail of any: how, while
she was still struggling to free herself from Purdy's embrace, the
door had opened and Mr. Grindle looked in. "He drew back at once,
of course. But it was awful, Richard! I turned cold. It seemed to
give me more strength, though. I pulled myself away and got out of
the room, I don't know how. My wreath was falling off. My dress was
crumpled. Nothing would have made me go back to the ballroom. I
couldn't have faced Amelia's husband&mdash;I think I shall never be
able to face him again," and Mary's tears flowed anew.</p>

<p>Richard was stamping about the room, aimlessly moving things
from their places. "God Almighty! he shall answer to me for this.
I'll go back and take a horsewhip with me."</p>

<p>"For my sake, don't have a scene with him. It would only make
matters worse," she pleaded.</p>

<p>But Richard strode up and down, treading heedlessly on the
flouncings of her dress. "What?&mdash;and let him believe such
behaviour can go unpunished? That whenever it pleases him, he can
insult my wife&mdash;insult my wife? Make her the talk of the
place? Brand her before the whole town as a light woman?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not the whole town, Richard. I shall have to explain to
Amelia...and Tilly...and Agnes&mdash;that's all," sobbed Mary in
parenthesis.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I ask if it's a dignified or decent thing for you to
have to do?&mdash;to go running round assuring your friends of your
virtue!" cried Richard furiously. "Let me tell you this, my dear:
at whatever door you knock, you'll be met by disbelief. Fate played
you a shabby trick when it allowed just that low cad to put his
head in. What do you think would be left of any woman's reputation
after Grindle Esquire had pawed it over? No, Mary, you've been
rendered impossible; and you'll be made to feel it for the rest of
your days. People will point to you as the wife who takes advantage
of her husband's absence to throw herself into another man's arms;
and to me as the convenient husband who provides the
opportunity"&mdash;and Mahony groaned. In an impetuous flight of
fancy he saw his good name smirched, his practice laid waste.</p>

<p>Mary lifted her head at this, and wiped her eyes. "Oh, you
always paint everything so black. People know me&mdash;know I would
never, never do such a thing."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately we live among human beings, my dear, not in a
community of saints! But what does a good woman know of how a
slander of this kind clings?"</p>

<p>"But if I have a perfectly clear conscience?" Mary's tone was
incredulous, even a trifle aggrieved.</p>

<p>"It spells ruin all the same in a hole like this, if it once
gets about."</p>

<p>"But it shan't. I'll put my pride in my pocket and go to Amelia
the first thing in the morning. I'll make it right
somehow.&mdash;But I must say, Richard, in the whole affair I don't
think you feel a bit sorry for me. Or at least only for me as your
wife. The horridest part of what happened was mine, not
yours&mdash;and I think you might show a little sympathy."</p>

<p>"I'm too furious to feel sorry," replied Richard with gaunt
truthfulness, still marching up and down.</p>

<p>"Well, I do," said Mary with a spice of defiance. "In spite of
everything, I feel sorry that any one could so far forget himself
as Purdy did to-night."</p>

<p>"You'll be telling me next you have warmer feelings still for
him!" burst out Mahony. "Sorry for the crazy lunatic who, after all
these years, after all I've done for him and the trust I've put in
him, suddenly falls to making love to the woman who bears my name?
Why, a madhouse is the only place he's fit for."</p>

<p>"There you're unjust. And wrong, too. It...it wasn't as sudden
as you think. Purdy has been queer in his behaviour for quite a
long time now."</p>

<p>"What in Heaven's name do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," said Mary staunchly, though she turned a
still deeper red. "Oh, you might just as well be angry with
yourself for being so blind and stupid."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me you were aware of something?" Mahony
stopped short in his perambulations and fixed her,
open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it.&mdash;Not that there was much to know,
Richard. And I thought of coming to you about it&mdash;indeed I
did. I tried to, more than once. But you were always so busy; I
hadn't the heart to worry you. For I knew very well how upset you
would be."</p>

<p>"So it comes to this, does it?" said Mahony with biting
emphasis. "My wife consents to another man paying her illicit
attentions behind her husband's back!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no! But I knew how fond you were of Purdy. And I
always hoped it would blow over without...without coming to
anything."</p>

<p>"God forgive me!" cried Mahony passionately. "It takes a woman's
brain to house such a preposterous idea."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not quite the fool you make me out to be, Richard. I've
got some sense in me. But it's always the same. I think of you, and
you think of no one but yourself. I only wanted to spare you. And
this is the thanks I get for it." And sitting down on the side of
the bed she wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"Will you assure me, madam, that till to-night nothing I could
have objected to has ever passed between you?"</p>

<p>"No, Richard, I won't! I won't tell you anything else. You get
so angry you don't know what you're saying. And if you can't trust
me better than that&mdash;Purdy said to-night you didn't understand
me...and never had."</p>

<p>"Oh, he did, did he? There we have it! Now I'll know every word
the scoundrel has ever said to you&mdash;and if I have to drag it
from you by force."</p>

<p>But Mary set her lips, with an obstinacy that was something
quite new in her. It first amazed Mahony, then made him doubly
angry. One word gave another; for the first time in their married
lives they quarrelled&mdash;quarrelled hotly. And, as always at
such times, many a covert criticism a secret disapproval which
neither had ever meant to breathe to the other, slipped out and
added fuel to the fire. It was appalling to both to find on how
many points they stood at variance.</p>

<p>Some half hour later, leaving Mary still on the edge of the bed,
still crying, Mahony stalked grimly into the surgery and taking pen
and paper scrawled, without even sitting down to do it:</p>

<p>YOU DAMNED SCOUNDREL! IF EVER YOU SHOW YOUR FACE HERE AGAIN,
I'LL THRASH YOU TO WITHIN AN INCH OF YOUR LIFE.</p>

<p>Then he stepped on to the verandah and crossed the lawn,
carrying the letter in his hand.</p>

<p>But already his mood was on the turn: it seemed as if, in the
physical effort of putting the words to paper, his rage had spent
itself. He was conscious now of a certain limpness, both of mind
and body; his fit of passion over, he felt dulled, almost
indifferent to what had happened. Now, too, another feeling was
taking possession of him, opening up vistas of a desert emptiness
that he hardly dared to face.</p>

<p>But stay!...was that not a movement in the patch of blackness
under the fig-tree? Had not something stirred there? He stopped,
and strained his eyes. No, it was only a bough that swayed in the
night air. He went out of the garden to the corner of the road and
came back empty handed. But at the same spot he hesitated, and
peered. "Who's there?" he asked sharply. And again: "Is there any
one there?" But the silence remained unbroken; and once more he saw
that the shifting of a branch had misled him.</p>

<p>Mary was moving about the bedroom. He ought to go to her and ask
pardon for his violence. But he was not yet come to a stage when he
felt equal to a reconciliation; he would rest for a while, let his
troubled balance right itself. And so he lay down on the surgery
sofa, and drew a rug over him.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, but could not sleep. His thoughts raced and
flew; his brain hunted clues and connections. He found himself
trying to piece things together; to fit them in, to recollect. And
every now and then some sound outside would make him start up and
listen...and listen. Was that not a footstep?...the step of one who
might come feeling his way...dim-eyed with regret? There were such
things in life as momentary lapses, as ungovernable
impulses&mdash;as fiery contrition...the anguish of remorse. And
yet, once more, he sat up and listened till his ears rang.</p>

<p>Then, not the ghostly footsteps of a delusive hope, but a hard,
human crunching that made the boards of the verandah shake. Tossing
off the opossum-rug, which had grown unbearably heavy, he sprang to
his feet; was wide awake and at the window, staring sleep-charged
into the dawn, before a human hand had found the night-bell and a
distracted voice cried:</p>

<p>"Does a doctor live here? A doctor, I say...?"</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-4-7" id="ch-1-4-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>The hot airless night had become the hot airless day: in the
garden the leaves on trees and shrubs drooped as under an invisible
weight. All the stale smells of the day before persisted&mdash;that
of the medicaments on the shelves, of the unwetted dust on the
roads, the sickly odour of malt from a neighbouring brewery. The
blowflies buzzed about the ceiling; on the table under the lamp a
dozen or more moths lay singed and dead. Now it was nearing six
o'clock; clad in his thinnest driving-coat, Mahony sat and watched
the man who had come to fetch him beat his horse to a lather.</p>

<p>"Mercy!...have a little mercy on the poor brute," he said more
than once.</p>

<p>He had stood out for some time against obeying the summons,
which meant, at lowest, a ten-mile drive. Not if he were offered a
hundred pounds down, was his first impetuous refusal; for he had
not seen the inside of a bed that night. But at this he trapped an
odd look in the other's eyes, and suddenly became aware that he was
still dressed as for the ball. Besides, an equally impetuous answer
was flung back at him: he promised no hundred pounds, said the
man&mdash;hadn't got it to offer. He appealed solely to the
doctor's humanity: it was a question of saving a life&mdash;that of
his only son. So here they were.</p>

<p>"We doctors have no business with troubles of our own," thought
Mahony, as he listened to the detailed account of an ugly accident.
On the roof of a shed the boy had missed his footing, slipped and
fallen some twenty feet, landing astride a piece of quartering.
Picking himself up, he had managed to crawl home, and at first they
thought he would be able to get through the night without medical
aid. But towards two o'clock his sufferings had grown unbearable.
God only knew if, by this time, he had not succumbed to them.</p>

<p>"My good man, one does not die of pain alone."</p>

<p>They followed a flat, treeless road, the grass on either side of
which was burnt to hay. Buggy and harness&mdash;the latter eked out
with bits of string and an old bootlace&mdash;were coated with the
dust of months; and the gaunt, long-backed horse shuffled through a
reddish flour, which accompanied them as a choking cloud. A swarm
of small black flies kept pace with the vehicle, settling on nose,
eyes, neck and hands of its occupants, crawling over the horse's
belly and in and out of its nostrils. The animal made no effort to
shake itself free, seemed indifferent to the pests: they were only
to be disturbed by the hail of blows which the driver occasionally
stood up to deliver. At such moments Mahony, too, started out of
the light doze he was continually dropping into.</p>

<p>Arrived at their destination&mdash;a miserable wooden shanty on
a sheep-run at the foot of the ranges&mdash;he found his patient
tossing on a dirty bed, with a small pulse of 120, while the right
thigh was darkly bruised and swollen. The symptoms pointed to
serious internal injuries. He performed the necessary
operation.</p>

<p>There was evidently no woman about the place; the coffee the
father brought him was thick as mud. On leaving, he promised to
return next day and to bring some one with him to attend to the
lad.</p>

<p>For the home-journey, he got a mount on a young and fidgety
mare, whom he suspected of not long having worn the saddle. In the
beginning he had his hands full with her. Then, however, she ceased
her antics and consented to advance at an easy trot.</p>

<p><i>How</i> tired he felt! He would have liked to go to bed and
sleep for a week on end. As it was, he could not reckon on even an
hour's rest. By the time he reached home the usual string of
patients would await him; and these disposed of, and a bite of
breakfast snatched, out he must set anew on his morning round. He
did not feel well either: the coffee seemed to have disagreed with
him. He had a slight sense of nausea and was giddy; the road swam
before his eyes. Possibly the weather had something to do with it;
though a dull, sunless morning it was hot as he had never known it.
He took out a stud, letting the ends of his collar fly.</p>

<p>Poor little Mary, he thought inconsequently: he had hurt and
frightened her by his violence. He felt ashamed of himself now. By
daylight he could see her point of view. Mary was so tactful and
resourceful that she might safely be trusted to hush up the affair,
to explain away the equivocal position in which she had been found.
After all, both of them were known to be decent, God-fearing
people. And one had only to look at Mary to see that here was no
light woman. Nobody in his senses&mdash;not even
Grindle&mdash;could think evil of that broad, transparent brow, of
those straight, kind, merry eyes.</p>

<p>No, this morning his hurt was a purely personal one. That it
should just be Purdy who did him this wrong! Purdy, playmate and
henchman, ally in how many a boyish enterprise, in the hardships
and adventures of later life. "Mine own familiar friend, in whom I
trusted, which did eat of my bread!" Never had he turned a deaf ear
to Purdy's needs; he had fed him and clothed him, caring for him as
for a well-loved brother. Surely few things were harder to bear
than a blow in the dark from one who stood thus deeply in your
debt, on whose gratitude you would have staked your head. It was,
of course, conceivable that he had been swept off his feet by
Mary's vivid young beauty, by over-indulgence, by the glamour of
the moment. But if a man could not restrain his impulses where the
wife of his most intimate friend was concerned...Another thing: as
long as Mary had remained an immature slip of a girl, Purdy had not
given her a thought. When, however, under her husband's wing she
had blossomed out into a lovely womanhood, of which any man might
be proud, then she had found favour in his eyes. And the slight
this put on Mary's sterling moral qualities, on all but her
physical charms, left the worst taste of any in the mouth.</p>

<p>Then, not content with trying to steal her love, Purdy had also
sought to poison her mind against him. How that rankled! For until
now he had hugged the belief that Purdy's opinion of him was
coloured by affection and respect, by the tradition of years.
Whereas, from what Mary had let fall, he saw that the boy must have
been sitting in judgment on him, regarding his peculiarities with
an unloving eye, picking his motives to pieces: it was like seeing
the child of your loins, of your hopes, your unsleeping care, turn
and rend you with black ingratitude. Yes, everything went to prove
Purdy's unworthiness. Only <i>he</i> had not seen it, only he had
been blind to the truth. And wrapped in this smug blindness he had
given his false friend the run of his home, setting, after the
custom of the country, no veto on his eternal presence. Disloyalty
was certainly abetted by just the extravagant, exaggerated
hospitality of colonial life. Never must the doors of your house be
shut; all you had you were expected to share with any sundowner of
fortune who chanced to stop at your gate.</p>

<p>The mare shied with a suddenness that almost unseated him: the
next moment she had the bit between her teeth and was galloping
down the road. Clomp-clomp-clomp went her hoofs on the baked clay;
the dust smothered and stung, and he was holding for all he was
worth to reins spanned stiff as iron. On they flew; his body
hammered the saddle; his breath came sobbingly. But he kept his
seat; and a couple of miles farther on he was down, soothing the
wild-eyed, quivering, sweating beast, whose nostrils worked like a
pair of bellows. There he stood, glancing now back along the road,
now up at the sky. His hat had gone flying at the first unexpected
plunge; he ought to return and look for it. But he shrank from the
additional fatigue, the delay in reaching home this would mean. The
sky was still overcast: he decided to risk it. Knotting his
handkerchief he spread it cap-wise over his head and got back into
the saddle.</p>

<p>Mine own familiar friend! And more than that: he could add to
David's plaint and say, my only friend. In Purdy the one person he
had been intimate with passed out of his life. There was nobody to
take the vacant place. He had been far too busy of late years to
form new friendships: what was left of him after the day's work was
done was but a kind of shell: the work was the meaty contents. As
you neared the forties, too, it grew ever harder to fit yourself to
other people: your outlook had become too set, your ideas too
unfluid. Hence you clung the faster to ties formed in the old,
golden days, worn though these might be to the thinness of a hair.
And then, there was one's wife, of course &mdash;one's dear, good
wife. But just her very dearness and goodness served to hold
possible intimates at arm's length. The knowledge that you had such
a confidante, that all your thoughts were shared with her, struck
disastrously at a free exchange of privacies. No, he was alone. He
had not so much as a dog now, to follow at heel and look up at him
with the melancholy eyes of its race. Old Pompey had come at
poison, and Mary had not wished to have a strange dog in the new
house. She did not care for animals, and the main charge of it
would have fallen on her. He had no time&mdash;no time even for a
dog!</p>

<p>Better it would assuredly be to have some one to fall back on:
it was not good for a man to stand so alone. Did troubles come,
they would strike doubly hard because of it; then was the time to
rejoice in a warm, human handclasp. And moodily pondering the
reasons for his solitariness, he was once more inclined to lay a
share of the blame on the conditions of the life. The population of
the place was still in a state of flux: he and a mere handful of
others would soon, he believed, be the oldest residents in
Ballarat. People came and went, tried their luck, failed, and
flitted off again, much as in the early days. What was the use of
troubling to become better acquainted with a person, when, just as
you began really to know him, he was up and away? At home, in the
old country, a man as often as not died in the place where he was
born; and the slow, eventless years, spent shoulder to shoulder,
automatically brought about a kind of intimacy. But this was only a
surface reason: there was another that went deeper. He had no
talent for friendship, and he knew it; indeed, he would even invert
the thing, and say bluntly that his nature had a twist in it which
directly hindered friendship; and this, though there came moments
when he longed, as your popular mortal never did, for close
companionship. Sometimes he felt like a hungry man looking on at a
banquet, of which no one invited him to partake, because he had
already given it to be understood that he would decline. But such
lapses were few. On nine days out of ten, he did not feel the need
of either making or receiving confidences; he shrank rather, with a
peculiar shy dread, from personal unbosomings. Some imp housed in
him&mdash;some wayward, wilful, mocking Irish devil&mdash;bidding
him hold back, remain cool, dry-eyed, in face of others' joys and
pains. Hence the break with Purdy was a real calamity. The
associations of some five-and-twenty years were bound up in it;
measured by it, one's marriage seemed a thing of yesterday. And
even more than the friend, he would miss the friendship and all it
stood for: this solid base of joint experience; this past of common
memories into which one could dip as into a well; this handle of
"Do you remember?" which opened the door to such a wealth of
anecdote. From now on, the better part of his life would be a
closed book to any but himself; there were allusions, jests without
number, homely turns of speech, which not a soul but himself would
understand. The thought of it made him feel old and empty; affected
him like the news of a death.&mdash;But <i>must</i> it be? Was
there no other way out? Slow to take hold, he was a hundred times
slower to let go. Before now he had seen himself sticking by a
person through misunderstandings, ingratitude, deception, to the
blank wonder of the onlookers. Would he not be ready here, too, to
forgive...to forget?</p>

<p>But he felt hot, hot to suffocation, and his heart was pounding
in uncomfortable fashion. The idea of stripping and plunging into
ice-cold water began to make a delicious appeal to him. Nothing
surpassed such a plunge after a broken night. But of late he had
had to be wary of indulging: a bath of this kind, taken when he was
over-tired, was apt to set the accursed tic a-going; and then he
could pace the floor in agony. And yet...Good God, how hot it was!
His head ached distractedly; an iron band of pain seemed to
encircle it. With a sudden start of alarm he noticed that he had
ceased to perspire&mdash;now he came to think of it, not even the
wild gallop had induced perspiration. Pulling up short, he fingered
his pulse. It was abnormal, even for him...and feeble. Was it
fancy, or did he really find a difficulty in breathing? He tore off
his collar, threw open the neck of his shirt. He had a sensation as
if all the blood in his body was flying to his head: his face must
certainly be crimson. He put both hands to this top-heavy head, to
support it; and in a blind fit of vertigo all but lost his balance
in the saddle: the trees spun round, the distance went black. For a
second still he kept upright; then he flopped to the ground,
falling face downwards, his arms huddled under him.</p>

<p>The mare, all her spirit gone, stood lamb-like and waited. As he
did not stir she turned and sniffed at him, curiously. Still he lay
prone, and, having stretched her tired jaws, she raised her head
and uttered a whinny&mdash;an almost human cry of distress. This,
too, failing in its effect, she nosed the ground for a few yards,
then set out at a gentle, mane-shaking trot for home.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Found, a dark conspicuous heap on the long bare road, and carted
back to town by a passing bullock-waggon, Mahony lay, once the
death-like coma had yielded, and tossed in fever and delirium. By
piecing his broken utterances together Mary learned all she needed
to know about the case he had gone out to attend, and his desperate
ride home. But it was Purdy's name that was oftenest on his lips;
it was Purdy he reviled and implored; and when he sprang up with
the idea of calling his false friend to account, it was as much as
she could do to restrain him.</p>

<p>She had the best of advice. Old Dr. Munce himself came two and
three times a day. Mary had always thought him a dear old man; and
she felt surer than ever of it when he stood patting her hand and
bidding her keep a good heart; for they would certainly pull her
husband through.</p>

<p>"There aren't so many of his kind here, Mrs. Mahony, that we can
afford to lose him."</p>

<p>But altogether she had never known till now how many and how
faithful their friends were. Hardly, for instance, had Richard been
carried in, stiff as a log and grey as death, when good Mrs. Devine
was fumbling with the latch of the gate, an old sunbonnet perched
crooked on her head: she had run down just as she was, in the midst
of shelling peas for dinner. She begged to be allowed to help with
the nursing. But Mary felt bound to refuse. She knew how the
thought of what he might have said in his delirium would worry
Richard, when he recovered his senses: few men laid such weight as
he on keeping their private thoughts private.</p>

<p>Not to be done, Mrs. Devine installed herself in the kitchen to
superintend the cooking. Less for the patient, into whom at first
only liquid nourishment could be injected, than: "To see as your
own strength is kep' up, dearie." Tilly swooped down and bore off
Trotty. Delicate fruits, new-laid eggs, jellies and wines came from
Agnes Ocock; while Amelia Grindle, who had no such dainties to
offer arrived every day at three o'clock, to mind the house while
Mary slept. Archdeacon Long was also a frequent visitor, bringing
not so much spiritual as physical aid; for, as the frenzy reached
its height and Richard was maddened by the idea that a plot was
brewing against his life, a pair of strong arms were needed to hold
him down. Over and above this, letters of sympathy flowed in;
grateful patients called to ask with tears in their eyes how the
doctor did; virtual strangers stopped the servant in the street
with the same query. Mary was sometimes quite overwhelmed by the
kindness people showed her.</p>

<p>The days that preceded the crisis were days of keenest anxiety.
But Mary never allowed her heart to fail her. For if, in the small
things of life, she was given to building on a mortal's good sense,
how much more could she rely at such a pass on the sense of the One
above all others. What she said to herself as she moved tirelessly
about the sick room, damping cloths, filling the ice-bag,
infiltering drops of nourishment, was: "God is good!" and these
words, far from breathing a pious resignation, voiced a confidence
so bold that it bordered on irreverence. Their real meaning was:
Richard has still ever so much work to do in the world, curing sick
people and saving their lives. God must know this, and cannot now
mean to be so foolish as to <i>waste</i> him, by letting him
die.</p>

<p>And her reliance on the Almighty's far-sighted wisdom was
justified. Richard weathered the crisis, slowly revived to life and
health; and the day came when, laying a thin white hand on hers, he
could whisper: "My poor little wife, what a fright I must have
given you!" And added: "I think an illness of some kind was
due&mdash;overdue&mdash;with me."</p>

<p>When he was well enough to bear the journey they left home for a
watering-place on the Bay. There, on an open beach facing the
Heads, Mahony lay with his hat pulled forward to shade his eyes,
and with nothing to do but to scoop up handfuls of the fine coral
sand and let it flow again, like liquid silk, through his fingers.
From beneath the brim he watched the water churn and froth on the
brown reefs; followed the sailing-ships which, beginning as mere
dots on the horizon, swelled to stately white waterbirds, and
shrivelled again to dots; drank in, with greedy nostrils, the mixed
spice of warm sea, hot seaweed and aromatic tea-scrub.</p>

<p>And his strength came back as rapidly as usual. He soon felt
well enough, leaning on Mary's arm, to stroll up and down the sandy
roads of the township; to open book and newspaper; and finally to
descend the cliffs for a dip in the transparent, turquoise sea. At
the end of a month he was at home again, sunburnt and hearty, eager
to pick up the threads he had let fall. And soon Mary was able to
make the comfortable reflection that everything was going on just
as before.</p>

<p>In this, however, she was wrong; never, in their united lives,
would things be quite the same again. Outwardly, the changes might
pass unnoticed&mdash;though even here, it was true, a certain name
had now to be avoided, with which they had formerly made free. But
this was not exactly hard to do, Purdy having promptly disappeared:
they heard at second-hand that he had at last accepted promotion
and gone to Melbourne. And since Mary had suffered no inconvenience
from his thoughtless conduct, they tacitly agreed to let the matter
rest. That was on the surface. Inwardly, the differences were more
marked. Even in the mental attitude they adopted towards what had
happened, husband and wife were thoroughly dissimilar. Mary did not
refer to it because she thought it would be foolish to re-open so
disagreeable a subject. In her own mind, however, she faced it
frankly, dating back to it as the night when Purdy had been so
odious and Richard so angry. Mahony, on the other hand, gave the
affair a wide berth even in thought. For him it was a kind of
Pandora's box, of which, having once caught a glimpse of the
contents, he did not again dare to raise the lid. Things might
escape from it that would alter his whole life. But he, too, dated
from it in the sense of suddenly becoming aware, with a throb of
regret, that he had left his youth behind him. And such phrases as:
"When I was young," "In my younger days," now fell instinctively
from his lips.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Deep down in Mary's soul there slumbered a
slight embarrassment; one she could not get the better of: it
spread and grew. This was a faint, ever so faint a doubt of
Richard's wisdom. Odd she had long known him to be, different in
many small and some great ways from those they lived amongst; but
hitherto this very oddness of his had seemed to her an outgrowth on
the side of superiority&mdash;fairer judgment, higher motives. Just
as she had always looked up to him as rectitude in person, so she
had thought him the embodiment of a fine, though somewhat unworldly
wisdom. Now her faith in his discernment was shaken. His treatment
of her on the night of the ball had shocked, confused her. She was
ready to make allowance for him: she had told her story clumsily,
and had afterwards been both cross and obstinate; while part of his
violence was certainly to be ascribed to his coming breakdown. But
this did not cover everything; and the ungenerous spirit in which
he had met her frankness, his doubt of her word, of her good
faith&mdash;his utter unreasonableness in short&mdash;had left a
cold patch of astonishment in her, which would not yield. She lit
on it at unexpected moments. Meanwhile, she groped for an epithet
that would fit his behaviour. Beginning with some rather vague and
high-flown terms she gradually came down, until with the sense of
having found the right thing at last, she fixed on the adjective
"silly"&mdash;a word which, for the rest, was in common use with
Mary, had she to describe anything that struck her as queer or
extravagant. And sitting over her fancywork, into which, being what
Richard called "safe as the grave," she sewed more thoughts than
most women: sitting thus, she would say to herself with a half
smile and an incredulous shake of the head: "<i>so</i> silly!"</p>

<p>But hers was one of those inconvenient natures which trust
blindly or not at all: once worked on by a doubt or a suspicion,
they are never able to shake themselves free of it again. As time
went on, she suffered strange uncertainties where some of Richard's
decisions were concerned. In his good intentions she retained an
implicit belief; but she was not always satisfied that he acted in
the wisest way. Occasionally it struck her that he did not see as
clearly as she did; at other times, that he let a passing whim run
away with him and override his common sense. And, her eyes thus
opened, it was not in Mary to stand dumbly by and watch him make
what she held to be mistakes. Openly to interfere, however, would
also have gone against the grain in her; she had bowed for too long
to his greater age and experience. So, seeing no other way out, she
fell back on indirect methods. To her regret. For, in watching
other women "manage" their husbands, she had felt proud to think
that nothing of this kind was necessary between Richard and her.
Now she, too, began to lay little schemes by which, without his
being aware of it, she might influence his judgment, divert or
modify his plans.</p>

<p>Her enforced use of such tactics did not lessen the admiring
affection she bore him: that was framed to withstand harder tests.
Indeed, she was even aware of an added tenderness towards him, now
she saw that it behoved her to have forethought for them both. But
into the wife's love for her husband there crept something of a
mother's love for her child; for a wayward and impulsive, yet
gifted creature, whose welfare and happiness depended on her alone.
And it is open to question whether the mother dormant in Mary did
not fall with a kind of hungry joy on this late-found task. The
work of her hands done, she had known empty hours. That was over
now. With quickened faculties, all her senses on the alert, she
watched, guided, hindered, foresaw.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-4-8" id="ch-1-4-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>Old Ocock failed in health that winter. He was really old now,
was two or three and sixty; and, with the oncoming of the rains and
cold, gusty winds, various infirmities began to plague him.</p>

<p>"He's done himself rather too well since his marriage," said
Mahony in private. "After being a worker for the greater part of
his life, it would have been better for him to work on to the
end."</p>

<p>Yes, that, Mary could understand and agree with. But Richard
continued: "All it means, of course, is that the poor fellow is
beginning to prepare for his last long journey. These aches and
pains of his represent the packing and the strapping without which
not even a short earthly journey can be undertaken. And his is into
eternity."</p>

<p>Mary, making lace over a pillow, looked up at this, a trifle
apprehensively. "What things you do say! If any one heard you,
they'd think you weren't very...very religious." Her fear lest
Richard's outspokenness should be mistaken for impiety never left
her.</p>

<p>Tilly was plain and to the point. "Like a bear with a sore back
that's what 'e is, since 'e can't get down among his blessed birds.
He leads Tom the life of the condemned, over the feeding of those
bantams. As if the boy could help 'em not laying when they
ought!"</p>

<p>At thirty-six Tilly was the image of her mother. Entirely gone
was the slight crust of acerbity that had threatened her in her
maiden days, when, thanks to her misplaced affections, it had
seemed for a time as if the purple prizes of life&mdash;love,
offers of marriage, a home of her own &mdash;were going to pass her
by. She was now a stout, high-coloured woman with a roar of a
laugh, full, yet firm lips, and the whitest of teeth. Mary thought
her decidedly toned down and improved since her marriage; but
Mahony put it that the means Tilly now had at her disposal were
such as to make people shut an eye to her want of refinement.
However that might be, "old Mrs. Ocock" was welcomed
everywhere&mdash;even by those on whom her bouncing manners grated.
She was invariably clad in a thick and handsome black silk gown,
over which she wore all the jewellery she could crowd on her
person&mdash;huge cameo brooches, ear-drops, rings and bracelets,
lockets and chains. Her name topped subscription-lists, and, having
early weaned her old husband of his dissenting habits, she was a
real prop to Archdeacon Long and his church, taking the chief and
most expensive table at tea-meetings, the most thankless stall at
bazaars. She kept open house, too, and gave delightful parties,
where, while some sat at loo, others were free to turn the rooms
upside-down for a dance, or to ransack wardrobes and presses for
costumes for charades. She drove herself and her friends about in
various vehicles, briskly and well, and indulged besides in many
secret charities. Her husband thought no such woman had ever
trodden the earth, and publicly blessed the day on which he first
set eyes on her.</p>

<p>"After the dose I'd 'ad with me first, 'twas a bit of a risk,
that I knew. And it put me off me sleep for a night or two
before'and. But my Tilly's the queen o' women&mdash;I say the
queen, sir! I've never 'ad a wrong word from 'er, an' when I go she
gits every penny I've got. Why, I'm jiggered if she didn't stop at
'ome from the Races t'other day, an' all on my account!"</p>

<p>"Now then, pa, drop it. Or the doctor'll think you've been
mixing your liquors. Give your old pin here and let me poultice
it."</p>

<p>He had another sound reason for gratitude. Somewhere in the
background of his house dwelt his two ne'er-do-well sons; Tilly had
accepted their presence uncomplainingly. Indeed she sometimes stood
up for Tom, against his father. "Now, pa, stop nagging at the boy,
will you? You'll never get anything out of 'im that way. Tom's
right enough if you know how to take him. He'll never set the
Thames on fire, if that's what you mean. But I'm thankful, I can
tell you, to have a handy chap like him at my back. If I 'ad to
depend on your silly old paws, I'd never get anything done at
all."</p>

<p>And so Tom, a flaxen-haired, sheepish-looking man of something
over thirty, led a kind of go-as-you-please existence about the
place, a jack-of-all-trades&mdash;in turn carpenter, whitewasher,
paper-hanger&mdash;an expert fetcher and carrier, bullied by his
father, sheltered under his stepmother's capacious wing. "It isn't
his fault 'e's never come to anything. 'E hadn't half a chance. The
truth is, Mary, for all they say to the opposite, men are harder
than women&mdash;so unforgiving-like. Just because Tom made a slip
once, they've never let 'im forget it, but tied it to 'is
coat-tails for 'im to drag with 'im through life. Littleminded I
call it.&mdash;Besides, if you ask me, my dear, it must have been a
case of six of one and half a dozen of the other. Tom as
sedoocer!&mdash;can you picture it, Mary? It's enough to make one
split." And with a meaning glance at her friend, Tilly broke out in
a contagious peal of laughter.</p>

<p>As for Johnny&mdash;well...and she shrugged her shoulders. "A
bad egg's bad, Mary, and no amount o' cooking and doctoring 'll
sweeten it. But he didn't make 'imself, did 'e?&mdash;and my
opinion is, parents should look to themselves a bit more than they
do."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she threw open the door of the little room where
Johnny housed. It was an odd place. The walls were plastered over
with newspaper-cuttings, with old prints from illustrated journals,
with snippets torn off valentines and keepsakes. Stuck one on
another, these formed a kind of loose wallpaper, which stirred in
the draught. Tilly went on: "I see myself to it being kept
cleanish; 'e hates the girl to come bothering round. Oh, just
Johnny's rubbish!" For Mary had stooped curiously to the table
which was littered with a queer collection of objects: matchboxes
on wheels; empty reels of cotton threaded on strings; bits of wood
shaped in rounds and squares; boxes made of paper; dried seaweed
glued in patterns on strips of cardboard. "He's for ever pottering
about with 'em. What amusement 'e gets out of it, only the Lord can
tell."</p>

<p>She did not mention the fact, known to Mary, that when Johnny
had a drinking-bout it was she who looked after him, got him
comfortably to bed, and made shift to keep the noise from his
father's ears. Yes, Tilly's charity seemed sheerly
inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Again, there was the case of Jinny's children.</p>

<p>For in this particular winter Tilly had exchanged her black silk
for a stuff gown, heavily trimmed with crepe. She was in mourning
for poor Jinny, who had died not long after giving birth to a third
daughter.</p>

<p>"Died <i>of</i> the daughter, in more senses than one," was
Tilly's verdict.</p>

<p>John had certainly been extremely put out at the advent of yet
another girl; and the probability was that Jinny had taken his
reproaches too much to heart. However it was, she could not rally;
and one day Mary received a telegram saying that if she wished to
see Jinny alive, she must come at once. No mention was made of
Tilly, but Mary ran to her with the news, and Tilly declared her
intention of going, too. "I suppose I may be allowed to say
good-bye to my own sister, even though I'm not a Honourable?"</p>

<p>"Not that Jinn and I ever really drew together," she continued
as the train bore them over the ranges. "She'd too much of poor pa
in 'er. And I was all ma. Hard luck that it must just be her who
managed to get such a domineering brute for a husband. You'll
excuse me, Mary, won't you?&mdash;a domineering brute!"</p>

<p>"And to think I once envied her the match!" she went on
meditatively, removing her bonnet and substituting a kind of
nightcap intended to keep her hair free from dust. "Lauks, Mary,
it's a good thing fate doesn't always take us at our word. We don't
know which side our bread's buttered on, and that's the truth. Why,
my dear, I wouldn't exchange my old boy for all the Honourables in
creation!"</p>

<p>They were in time to take leave of Jinny lying white as her
pillows behind the red rep hangings of the bed. The bony parts of
her face had sprung into prominence, her large soft eyes fallen in.
John, stalking solemnly and noiselessly in a long black coat,
himself led the two women to the bedroom, where he left them; they
sat down one on each side of the great fourposter. Jinny hardly
glanced at her sister: it was Mary she wanted, Mary's hand she
fumbled for while she told her trouble. "It's the children, Mary,"
she whispered. "I can't die happy because of the children. John
doesn't understand them." Jinny's whole existence was bound up in
the three little ones she had brought into the world.</p>

<p>"Dearest Jinny, don't fret. I'll look after them for you, and
take care of them," promised Mary wiping away her tears.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said the dying woman, relieved, but without
gratitude: it seemed but natural to her, who was called upon to
give up everything, that those remaining should make sacrifices.
Her fingers plucked at the sheet. "John's been good to me," she
went on, with closed eyes. "But...if it 'adn't been for the
children...yes, the children...I think I'd 'a' done better&mdash;"
her speech lapsed oddly, after her years of patient
practice&mdash;"to 'ave taken...to 'a' taken"&mdash;the name
remained unspoken.</p>

<p>Tilly raised astonished eyebrows at Mary. "Wandering!" she
telegraphed in lip-language, forming the word very largely and
distinctly; for neither knew of Jinny having had any but her one
glorious chance.</p>

<p>Tilly's big heart yearned over her sister's forlorn little ones;
they could be heard bleating like lambs for the mother to whom till
now they had never cried in vain. Her instant idea was to gather
all three up in her arms and carry them off to her own roomy,
childless home, where she would have given them a delightful,
though not maybe a particularly discriminating upbringing. But the
funeral over, the blinds raised, the two ladies and the elder babes
clad in the stiff, expensive mourning that befitted the widower's
social position, John put his foot down: and to Mary was extremely
explicit: "Under no circumstances will I permit Matilda to have
anything to do with the rearing of my children excellent creature
though she be!"</p>

<p>On the other hand, he would not have been unwilling for Mary to
mother them. This, of course, was out of the question: Richard had
accustomed himself to Trotty, but would thank you, she knew, for
any fresh encroachment on his privacy. Before leaving, however, she
promised to sound him on the plan of placing Trotty as a weekly
boarder at a Young Ladies' Seminary, and taking the infant in her
place. For it came out that John intended to set Zara&mdash;Zara,
but newly returned from a second voyage to England and still
sipping like a bee at the sweets of various situations&mdash;at the
head of his house once more. And Mary could not imagine Zara
rearing a baby.</p>

<p>Equally hard was it to understand John not having learnt wisdom
from his two previous failures to live with his sister. But, in
seeking tactfully to revive his memory, she ran up against such an
ingrained belief in the superiority of his own kith and kin that
she was baffled, and could only fold her hands and hope for the
best.</p>

<p>"Besides, Jane's children are infinitely more tractable than
poor Emma's," was John's parting shot.&mdash;Strange, thought Mary,
how attached John was to his second family.</p>

<p>He had still another request to make of her. The reports he
received of the boy Johnny, now a pupil at the Geelong Grammar
School, grew worse from term to term. It had become clear to him
that he was unfortunate enough to possess an out-and-out dullard
for a son. Regretfully giving up, therefore, the design he had
cherished of educating Johnny for the law, he had resolved to waste
no more good money on the boy, but to take him, once he was turned
fifteen, into his own business. Young John, however, had proved
refractory, expressing a violent antipathy to the idea of
office-life. "It is here that I should be glad of another
opinion&mdash;and I turn to you, Mary, my dear. Jane was of no use
whatever in such matters, none whatever, being, and very properly
so, entirely wrapped up in her own children." So Mary arranged to
break her homeward journey at Geelong, for the purpose of seeing
and summing up her nephew.</p>

<p>Johnny&mdash;he was Jack at school, but that, of course, his
tomfools of relations couldn't be expected to remember&mdash;Johnny
was waiting on the platform when the train steamed in. "Oh, what a
bonny boy!" said Mary to herself. "All poor Emma's good looks."</p>

<p>Johnny had been kicking his heels disconsolately: another of
these wretched old women coming down to jaw him! He wished every
one of them at the bottom of the sea. However he pulled himself
together and went forward to greet his aunt: he was not in the
least bashful. And as they left the station he took stock of her,
out of the tail of his eye. With a growing approval: this one at
any rate he needn't feel ashamed of; and she was not so dreadfully
old after all. Perhaps she mightn't turn out quite such a wet
blanket as the rest; though, from experience, he couldn't connect
any pleasure with relatives' visits: they were nasty pills that had
to be swallowed. He feared and disliked his father; Aunt Zara had
been sheerly ridiculous, with her frills and simpers&mdash;the boys
had imitated her for weeks after&mdash;and once, most shameful of
all, his stepmother had come down and publicly wept over him. His
cheeks still burnt at the remembrance; and he had been glad to hear
that she was dead: served her jolly well right! But this Aunt Mary
seemed a horse of another colour; and he did not sneak her into
town by a back way, as he had planned to do before seeing her.</p>

<p>Greatly as Mary might admire the tall fair lad by her side, she
found herself at a loss how to deal with him, the mind of a
schoolboy of thirteen being a closed book to her. Johnny looked
demure and answered "Yes, Aunt Mary," to everything she said; but
this was of small assistance in getting at the real boy inside.</p>

<p>Johnny had no intention, in the beginning, of taking her into
his often-betrayed and badly bruised confidence. However a happy
instinct led her to suggest a visit to a shop that sold
brandy-snaps and gingerbeer; and this was too much for his strength
of mind. Golly, didn't he have a tuck-in! And a whole pound of
bull's-eyes to take back with him to school!</p>

<p>It was over the snaps, with an earth-brown moustache drawn round
his fresh young mouth, the underlip of which swelled like a ripe
cherry, that he blurted out: "I say, Aunt Mary, <i>don't</i> let
the pater stick me in that beastly old office of his. I...I want to
go to sea."</p>

<p>"Oh, but Johnny! Your father would never consent to that, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>"I don't see why not," returned the boy in an aggrieved voice.
"I hate figures and father knows it. I tell you I mean to go to
sea." And as he said it his lip shot out, and suddenly, for all his
limpid blue eyes and flaxen hair, it was his father's face that
confronted Mary.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't think it respectable enough, dear. He wants you to
rise higher in the world, and to make money. You must remember who
he is."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" said Johnny. "Look at Uncle Ned...and Uncle Jerry...and
the governor himself. He didn't have to sit in a beastly old hole
of an office when he was my age."</p>

<p>"That was quite different," said Mary weakly. "And as for your
Uncle Jerry, Johnny&mdash;why, afterwards he was as glad as could
be to get into an office at all."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd sooner be hanged!" retorted young John. But the next
minute flinging away dull care, he inquired briskly: "Can you play
tipcat, Aunt Mary?" And vanquished by her air of kindly interest,
he gave her his supreme confidence. "I say, don't peach, will you,
but I've got a white rat. I keep it in a locker under my bed."</p>

<p>A NICE FRANK HANDSOME BOY, wrote Mary. DON'T BE TOO HARD ON HIM,
JOHN. HIS GREAT WISH IS TO TRAVEL AND SEE THE WORLD&mdash;OR AS HE
PUTS IT, TO GO TO SEA. MIGHTN'T IT BE A GOOD THING TO HUMOUR HIM IN
THIS? A TASTE OF THE HARDSHIPS OF LIFE WOULD SOON CURE HIM OF ANY
SUCH FANCIES.</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" said John the father, and threw the letter
from him. "I didn't send Mary there to let the young devil get
round her like that." And thereupon he wrote to the Headmaster that
the screw was to be applied to Johnny as never before. This was his
last chance. If it failed, and his next report showed no
improvement, he would be taken away without further ado and planked
down under his father's nose. No son of his should go to sea, he
was damned if they should! For, like many another who has yielded
to the wandering passion in his youth, John had small mercy on it
when it reared its head in his descendants.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-4-9" id="ch-1-4-9"></a>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>Henry Ocock was pressing for a second opinion; his wife had been
in poor health since the birth of her last child. Mahony drove to
Plevna House one morning between nine and ten o'clock.</p>

<p>A thankless task lay before him. Mrs. Henry's case had been a
fruitful source of worry to him; and he now saw nothing for it but
a straight talk with Henry himself.</p>

<p>He drove past what had once been the Great Swamp. From a bed of
cattle-ploughed mud interspersed with reedy water-holes; in summer
a dry and dust-swept hollow: from this, the vast natural depression
had been transformed into a graceful lake, some three hundred acres
in extent. On its surface pleasure boats lay at their moorings by
jetties and boatsheds; groups of stiff-necked swans sailed or
ducked and straddled; while shady walks followed the banks, where
the whiplike branches of the willows, showing shoots of tenderest
green, trailed in the water or swayed like loose harp-strings to
the breeze.</p>

<p>All the houses that had sprung up round Lake Wendouree had
well-stocked spreading grounds; but Ocock's outdid the rest. The
groom opening a pair of decorative iron gates which were the
showpiece of the neighbourhood, Mahony turned in and drove past
exotic firs, Moreton Bay fig-trees and araucarias; past cherished
English hollies growing side by side with giant cacti. In one
corner stood a rockery, where a fountain played and goldfish swam
in a basin. The house itself, of brick and two-storeyed, with
massive bay-windows, had an ornamental verandah on one side. The
drawing-room was a medley of gilt and lustres, mirrors and glass
shades; the finest objects from Dandaloo had been brought here,
only to be outdone by Henry's own additions. Yes, Ocock lived in
grand style nowadays, as befitted one of the most important men in
the town. His old father once gone&mdash;and Mahony alone knew why
the latter's existence acted as a drag&mdash;he would no doubt
stand for Parliament.</p>

<p>Invited to walk into the breakfast-room, Mahony there found the
family seated at table. It was a charming scene. Behind the urn
Mrs. Henry, in be-ribboned cap and morning wrapper, dandled her
infant; while Henry, in oriental gown and Turkish fez, had laid his
newspaper by to ride his young son on his foot. Mahony refused tea
or coffee; but could not avoid drawing up a chair, touching the
peachy cheeks of the children held aloft for his inspection, and
meeting a fire of playful sallies and kindly inquiries. As he did
so, he was sensitively aware that it fell to him to break up the
peace of this household. Only he knew the canker that had begun to
eat at its roots.</p>

<p>The children borne off, Mrs. Henry interrogated her husband's
pleasure with a pretty: "May I?" or "Should I?" lift of the brows;
and gathering that he wished her to retire, laid her small, plump
hand in Mahony's, sent a graceful message to "dearest Mary," and
swept the folds of her gown from the room. Henry followed her with
a well-pleased eye&mdash;his opinion was no secret that, in figure
and bearing, his wife bore a marked resemblance to her Majesty the
Queen&mdash;and admonished her not to fail to partake of some light
refreshment during the morning, in the shape of a glass of sherry
and a biscuit. "Unless, my love, you prefer me to order cook to
whip you up an egg-nog.&mdash;Mrs. Ocock is, I regret to say,
entirely without appetite again," he went on, as the door closed
behind his wife. "What she eats is not enough to keep a sparrow
going. You must prove your skill, doctor, and oblige us by
prescribing a still more powerful tonic or appetiser. The last had
no effect whatever." He spoke from the hearthrug, where he had gone
to warm his skirts at the wood fire, audibly fingering the while a
nest of sovereigns in a waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>"I feared as much," said Mahony gravely; and therewith took the
plunge.</p>

<p>When some twenty minutes later he emerged from the house, he was
unaccompanied, and himself pulled the front door to behind him. He
stood frowning heavily as he snapped the catches of his gloves, and
fell foul of the groom over a buckle of the harness, in a fashion
that left the man open-mouthed. "Blow me, if I don't believe he's
got the sack!" thought the man in driving townwards.</p>

<p>The abrupt stoppage of Richard's visits to Plevna House
staggered Mary. And since she could get nothing out of her husband,
she tied on her bonnet and went off hotfoot to question her friend.
But Mrs. Henry tearfully declared her ignorance she had listened in
fear and trembling to the sound of the two angry voices&mdash;and
Henry was adamant. They had already called in another doctor.</p>

<p>Mary came home greatly distressed, and, Richard still wearing
his obstinate front, she ended by losing her temper. He knew well
enough, said she, it was not her way to interfere or to be
inquisitive about his patients; but this was different; this had to
do with one of her dearest friends; she must know. In her ears rang
Agnes's words: "Henry told me, love, he wouldn't insult me by
repeating what your husband said of me. Oh, Mary, isn't it
dreadful? And when I liked him so as a doctor!"&mdash;She now
repeated them aloud.</p>

<p>This was too much for Mahony. He blazed up. "The confounded
mischiefmonger&mdash;the backbiter! Well, if you will have it,
wife, here you are...here's the truth. What I said to Ocock was: I
said, my good man, if you want your wife to get over her next
confinement more quickly, keep the sherry-decanter out of her
reach."</p>

<p>Mary gasped and sank on a chair, letting her arms flop to her
side. "Richard!" she ejaculated. "Oh, Richard, you never did!"</p>

<p>"I did indeed, my dear.&mdash;Oh well, not in just those words,
of course; we doctors must always wrap the truth up in silver
paper.&mdash;And I should feel it my duty to do the same again
to-morrow; though there are pleasanter things in life, Mary, I can
assure you, than informing a low mongrel like Ocock that his wife
is drinking on the sly. You can have no notion, my dear, of the
compliments one calls down on one's head by so doing. The case is
beyond my grasp, of course, and I am cloaking my own shortcomings
by making scandalous insinuations against a delicate lady, who
'takes no more than her position entitles her to'&mdash;his very
words, Mary!&mdash;'for the purpose of keeping up her strength.'"
And Mahony laughed hotly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but was it&mdash;I mean...was it really necessary to say
it?" stammered Mary still at sea. And as her husband only shrugged
his shoulders: "Then I can't pretend to be surprised at what has
happened, Richard. Mr. Henry will <i>never</i> forgive you. He
thinks so much of everything and every one belonging to him."</p>

<p>"Pray, can I help that?...help his infernal pride? And, good
God, Mary, can't you see that, far more terrible than my having had
to tell him the truth, is the fact of there being such a truth to
tell?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, indeed I can," and the warm tears rushed to Mary's
eyes. "Poor, poor little Agnes!&mdash;Richard, it comes of her
having once been married to that dreadful man. And though she
doesn't say so, yet I don't believe she's really happy in her
second marriage either. There are so many things she's not allowed
to do&mdash;and she's afraid of Mr. Henry, I know she is. You see
he's displeased when she's dull or unwell; she must always be
bright and look pretty; and I expect the truth is, since her
illness she has taken to taking things, just to keep her spirits
up." Here Mary saw a ray of light, and snatched at it. "But in that
case mightn't the need for them pass, as she grows stronger?"</p>

<p>"I lay no claim to be a prophet, my dear."</p>

<p>"For it does seem strange that I never noticed anything," went
on Mary, more to herself than to him. "I've seen Agnes at all hours
of the day...when she wasn't in the least expecting
visitors.&mdash;Yes, Richard, I do know people sometimes eat things
to take the smell away. But the idea of Agnes doing anything
so...so low&mdash;oh, isn't it <i>just</i> possible there might be
some mistake?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you're going to imitate Ocock and try to teach me
my business!" gave back Mahony with an angry gesture, and sitting
down at the table, he pulled books and papers to him.</p>

<p>"As if such a thing would ever occur to me! It's only
that...that somehow my brain won't take it in. Agnes has always
been such a dear good little soul, all kindness. She's never done
anybody any harm or said a hard word about any one, all the years
I've known her. I simply <i>can't</i> believe it of her, and that's
the truth. As for what people will say when it gets about that
you've been shown the door in a house like Mr. Henry's&mdash;why,
I'm afraid even to think of it!" and powerless any longer to keep
back her tears, Mary hastened from the room.</p>

<p>But she also thought it wiser to get away before Richard had
time to frame the request that she should break off all intercourse
with Plevna House. This, she could never promise to do; and the
result might be a quarrel. Whereas if she avoided giving her word,
she would be free to slip out now and then to see poor Agnes, when
Richard was on his rounds and Mr. Henry at business. But this was
the only point clear to her. In standing up for her friend she had
been perfectly sincere: to think ill of a person she cared for,
cost Mary an inward struggle. Against this, however, she had an
antipathy to set that was almost stronger than herself. Of all
forms of vice, intemperance was the one she hated most. She lived
in a country where it was, alas! only too common; but she had never
learnt to tolerate it, or to look with a lenient eye on those who
succumbed: and whether these were but slaves of the nipping habit;
or the eternal dram-drinkers who felt fit for nothing if they had
not a peg inside them; or those seasoned topers who drank their
companions under the table without themselves turning a hair; or
yet again those who, sober for three parts of the year, spent the
fourth in secret debauches. Herself she had remained as rigidly
abstemious as in the days of her girlhood. And she often mused,
with a glow at her heart, on her great good fortune in having found
in Richard one whose views on this subject were no less strict than
her own. Hence her distress at his disclosure was caused not alone
by the threatened loss of a friendship: she wept for the horror
with which the knowledge filled her.</p>

<p>Little by little, though, her mind worked round to what was,
after all, the chief consideration: Richard's action and its
probable consequences. And here once more she was divided against
herself. For a moment she had hoped her husband would own the
chance of him being in error. But she soon saw that this would
never do. A mistake on his part would be a blow to his reputation.
Besides making enemies of people like the Henrys for nothing. If he
had to lose them as patients, it might as well be for a good solid
reason, she told herself with a dash of his own asperity. No, it
was a case of either husband or friend. And though she pitied Agnes
from the bottom of her heart, yet there were literally no lengths
she would have shrunk from going to, to spare Richard pain or even
anxiety. And this led her on to wonder whether, granted things were
as he said, he had approached Mr. Henry in the most discreet way.
Could he not have avoided a complete break? She sat and pondered
this question till her head ached, finding herself up against the
irreconcilability of the practical with the ideal which complicates
a man's working life. What she belatedly tried to think out for her
husband was some little common-sense stratagem by means of which he
could have salved his conscience, without giving offence. He might
have said that the drugs he was prescribing would be nullified by
the use of wine or spirits; even better, have warned Agnes in
private. Somehow, it might surely have been managed. Mr. Henry had
no doubt been extremely rude and overbearing; but in earlier years
Richard had known how to behave towards ill-breeding. She couldn't
tell why, but he was finding it more and more difficult to get on
with people nowadays. He certainly had a very great deal to do, and
was often tired out. Again, he did not need to care so much as
formerly whether he offended people or not&mdash;ordinary patients,
that was; the Henrys, of course, were of the utmost consequence.
Still, once on a time he had been noted for his tact; it was sad to
see it leaving him in the lurch. Several times of late she had been
forced to step in and smooth out awkwardnesses. But a week ago he
had had poor little Amelia Grindle up in arms, by telling her that
her sickly first-born would mentally never be quite like other
children. To every one else this had been plain from the outset;
but Amelia had suspected nothing, having, poor thing, no idea when
a babe ought to begin to take notice or cut its teeth. Richard said
it was better for her to face the truth betimes than to spend her
life vainly hoping and fretting; indeed, it would not be right of
him to allow it. Poor dear Richard! He set such store by truth and
principle&mdash;and she, Mary, would not have had him otherwise.
All the same, she thought that in both cases a small compromise
would not have hurt him. But compromise he would not...or could
not. And as, recalled to reality by the sight of the week's
washing, which strained, ballooned, collapsed, on its lines in the
yard &mdash;Biddy was again letting the clothes get much too
dry!&mdash;as Mary rose to her feet, she manfully squared her
shoulders to meet the weight of the new burden that was being laid
on them.</p>

<p>With regard to Mahony, it might be supposed that having
faithfully done what he believed to be his duty, he would enjoy the
fruits of a quiet mind. This was not so. Before many hours had
passed he was wrestling with the incident anew; and a true son of
that nation which, for all its level-headedness, spends its best
strength in fighting shadows, he felt a great deal angrier in
retrospect than he had done at the moment. It was not alone the
fact of him having got his conge&mdash;no medico was safe from
<i>that</i> punch below the belt. His bitterness was aimed at
himself. Once more he had let himself be hoodwinked; had written
down the smooth civility it pleased Ocock to adopt towards him to
respect and esteem. Now that the veil was torn, he saw how poor the
lawyer's opinion of him actually was. And always had been. For a
memory was struggling to emerge in him, setting strings in
vibration. And suddenly there rose before him a picture of Ocock
that time had dimmed. He saw the latter standing in the dark,
crowded lobby of the court-house, cursing at him for letting their
witness escape. There it was! There, in these two scenes, far apart
as they lay, you had the whole man. The unctuous blandness, the
sleek courtesy was but a mask, which he wore for you just so long
as you did not hinder him by getting in his way. That was the
unpardonable sin. For Ocock was out to succeed&mdash;to succeed at
any price and by any means. In tracing his course, no goal but this
had ever stood before him. The obligations that bore on your
ordinary mortal&mdash;a sense of honesty, of responsibility to
one's fellows, the soft pull of domestic ties&mdash;did not trouble
Ocock. He laughed them down, or wrung their necks like so many
pullets. And should the poor little woman who bore his name become
a drag on him, she would be tossed on to the rubbish-heap with the
rest. In a way, so complete a freedom from altruistic motives had
something grandiose about it. But those who ran up against it, and
could not fight it with its own weapons, had not an earthly
chance.</p>

<p>Thus Mahony sat in judgment, giving rein for once to his
ingrained dislike for the man of whom he had now made an enemy. In
whose debt, for the rest, he stood deep. And had done, ever since
the day he had been fool enough, like the fly in the nursery rhyme,
to seek out Ocock and his familiars in their grimy little "parlour"
in Chancery Lane.</p>

<p>But his first heat spent he soon cooled down, and was able to
laugh at the stagy explosiveness of his attitude. So much for the
personal side of the matter. Looked at from a business angle it was
more serious. The fact of him having been shown the door by a
patient of Ocock's standing was bound, as Mary saw, to react
unfavourably on the rest of the practice. The news would run like
wildfire through the place; never were such hotbeds of gossip as
these colonial towns. Besides, the colleague who had been called in
to Mrs. Agnes in his stead, was none too well disposed towards
him.</p>

<p>His fears were justified. It quickly got about that he had made
a blunder: all Mrs. Henry needed, said the new-comer, was change of
air and scene; and forthwith the lady was packed off on a trial
trip to Sydney. Mahony held his head high, and refused to notice
looks and hints. But he knew all about what went on behind his
back: he was morbidly sensitive to atmosphere; could tell how a
house was charged as soon as he crossed the threshold. People were
saying: a mistake there, why not here, too? Slow recoveries asked
themselves if a fresh treatment might not benefit them; lovers of
blue pills hungered for more drastic remedies. The disaffection
would blow over, of course; but it was painful while it lasted; and
things were not bettered by one of his patients choosing just this
inconvenient moment to die&mdash;an elderly man, down with the
Russian influenza, who disobeyed orders, got up too early and was
carried off by double pneumonia inside a week.&mdash;Worry over the
mishap robbed his poor medical attendant of sleep for several
nights on end.</p>

<p>Not that this was surprising; he found it much harder than of
old to keep his mind from running on his patients outside
working-hours. In his younger days he had laid down fixed rules on
this score. Every brainworker, he held, must in his spare time be
able to detach his thoughts from his chief business, pin them to
something of quite another kind, no matter how trivial: keep fowls
or root round gardens, play the flute or go in for carpentry. Now,
he might have dug till his palms blistered, it would not help.
Those he prescribed for teased him like a pack of spirit-presences,
which clamour to be heard. And if a serious case took a turn for
the worse, he would find himself rising in a sweat of uncertainty,
and going lamp in hand into the surgery, to con over a prescription
he had written during the day. And one knew where <i>that</i> kind
of thing led!</p>

<p>Now, as if all this were not enough, there was added to it the
old, evergreen botheration about money.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-1-4-10" id="ch-1-4-10"></a>Chapter X</h3>

<p>Thus far, Ocock had nursed his mining investments for him with a
fatherly care. He himself had been free as a bird from
responsibility. Every now and again he would drop in at the office,
just to make sure the lawyer was on the alert; and each time he
came home cheerful with confidence. That was over now. As a first
result of the breach, he missed&mdash;or so he
believed&mdash;clearing four hundred pounds. Among the shares he
held was one lot which till now had proved a sorry bargain. Soon
after purchase something had gone wrong with the management of the
claim; there had been a lawsuit, followed by calls unending and
never a dividend. Now, when these shares unexpectedly swung up to a
high level&mdash;only to drop the week after to their standing
figure&mdash;Ocock failed to sell out in the nick of time. Called
to account, he replied that it was customary in these matters for
his clients to advise him; thus deepening Mahony's sense of
obligation. Stabbed in his touchiness, he wrote for all his scrip
to be handed over to him; and thereafter loss and gain depended on
himself alone. It certainly brought a new element of variety into
his life. The mischief was, he could get to his study of the
money-market only with a fagged brain. And the fear lest he should
do something rash or let a lucky chance slip kept him on
tenter-hooks.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Mary, seated one evening in face of
her husband, found herself reflecting: "When one comes to think of
it, how seldom Richard ever smiles nowadays."</p>

<p>For a wonder they were at a soiree together, at the house of one
of Mahony's colleagues. The company consisted of the inner circle
of friends and acquaintances: "Always the same people&mdash;the old
job lot! One knows before they open their mouths what they'll say
and how they'll say it," Richard had grumbled as he dressed. The
Henry Ococks were not there though, it being common knowledge that
the two men declined to meet; and a dash of fresh blood was present
in the shape of a lady and gentleman just "out from home." Richard
got into talk with this couple, and Mary, watching him fondly,
could not but be struck by his animation. His eyes lit up, he
laughed and chatted, made merry repartee: she was carried back to
the time when she had known him first. In those days his natural
gravity was often cut through by a mood of high spirits, of boyish
jollity, which, if only by way of contrast, rendered him a
delightful companion. She grew a little wistful, as she sat
comparing present with past. And loath though she was to dig deep,
for fear of stirring up uncomfortable things, she could not escape
the discovery that, in spite of all his success&mdash;and his
career there had surpassed their dearest hopes&mdash;in spite of
the natural gifts fortune had showered on him, Richard was not what
you would call a happy man. No, nor even moderately happy. Why this
should be, it went beyond her to say. He had everything he could
wish for: yes, everything, except perhaps a little more time to
himself, and better health. He was not as strong as she would have
liked to see him. Nothing radically wrong, of course, but enough to
fidget him. Might not this...this&mdash;he himself called it "want
of tone"&mdash;be a reason for the scant pleasure he got out of
life? And: "I think I'll pop down and see Dr. Munce about him one
morning, without a word to him," was how she eased her mind and
wound up her reverie.</p>

<p>But daylight, and the most prosaic hours of the twenty-four,
made the plan look absurd.</p>

<p>Once alive though to his condition, she felt deeply sorry for
him in his patent inability ever to be content. It was a thousand
pities. Things might have run so smoothly for him, he have got so
much satisfaction out of them, if only he could have braced himself
to regard life in cheerier fashion. But at this Mary stopped...and
wondered...and wondered. Was that really true? Positively her
experiences of late led her to believe that Richard would be less
happy still if he had nothing to be unhappy about.&mdash;But dear
me! this was getting out of her depth altogether. She shook her
head and rebuked herself for growing fanciful.</p>

<p>All the same, her new glimpse of his inmost nature made her
doubly tender of thwarting him; hence, she did not set her face as
firmly as she might otherwise have done, against a wild plan he now
formed of again altering, or indeed rebuilding the house; although
she could scarcely think of it with patience. She liked her house
so well as it stood; and it was amply big enough: there was only
the pair of them...and John's child. It had the name, she knew, of
being one of the most comfortable and best-kept in Ballarat. Brick
for solidity, where wood prevailed, with a wide snowy verandah up
the posts of which rare creepers ran, twining their tendrils one
with another to form a screen against the sun. Now, what must
Richard do but uproot the creepers and pull down the verandah, thus
baring the walls to the fierce summer heat; plaster over the brick;
and, more outlandish still, add a top storey. When she came back
from Melbourne, where she had gone a-visiting to escape the
upset&mdash;Richard, ordinarily so sensitive, had managed to endure
it quite well, thus proving that he <i>could</i> put up with
discomfort if he wanted to&mdash;when she saw it again, Mary hardly
recognised her home. Personally she thought it ugly, for all its
grandeur; changed wholly for the worse. Nor did time ever reconcile
her to the upper storey. Domestic worries bred from it: the servant
went off in a huff because of the stairs; they were at once obliged
to double their staff. To cap it all, with its flat front unbroken
by bay or porch, the house looked like no other in the town. Now,
instead of passing admiring remarks, people stood stock-still
before the gate to laugh at its droll appearance.</p>

<p>Yet, she would gladly have made the best of this, had Richard
been the happier for it. He was not&mdash;or only for the briefest
of intervals. Then his restlessness broke out afresh.</p>

<p>There came days when nothing suited him; not his fine consulting
room, or the improved furnishings of the house, or even her cookery
of which he had once been so fond. He grew dainty to a degree; she
searched her cookery-book for piquant recipes. Next he fell to
imagining it was unhealthy to sleep on feathers, and went to the
expense of having a hard horsehair mattress made to fit the bed.
Accustomed to the softest down, he naturally tossed and turned all
night long, and rose in the morning declaring he felt as though he
had been beaten with sticks. The mattress was stowed away in a
lean-to behind the kitchen, and there it remained. It was not
alone. Mary sometimes stood and considered, with a rueful eye, the
many discarded objects that bore it company. Richard&mdash;oddly
enough he was ever able to poke fun at himself&mdash;had christened
this outhouse "the cemetery of dead fads." Here was a set of Indian
clubs he had been going to harden his muscles with every morning,
and had used for a week; together with an india-rubber gymnastic
apparatus bought for the same purpose. Here stood a patent
shower-bath, that was to have dashed energy over him after a bad
night, and had only succeeded in giving him acute neuralgia; a
standing-desk he had broken his back at for a couple of days; a
homoeopathic medicine-chest and a phrenological head&mdash;both
subjects he had meant to satisfy his curiosity by looking into, had
time not failed him. Mary sighed, when she thought of the waste of
good money these and similar articles stood for. (Some day he would
just have them privately carted away to auction!) But if Richard
set his heart on a thing he wanted it so badly, so much more than
other people did, that he knew no peace till he had it.</p>

<p>Mahony read in his wife's eyes the disapproval she was too wise
to utter. At any other time her silent criticism would have galled
him; in this case, he took shelter behind it. Let her only go on
setting him down for lax and spendthrift, incapable of knowing his
own mind. He would be sorry, indeed, for her to guess how matters
really stood with him. The truth was, he had fallen a prey to utter
despondency, was become so spiritless that it puzzled even himself.
He thought he could trace some of the mischief back to the
professional knocks and jars Ocock's action had brought down on
him: to hear one's opinion doubted, one's skill questioned, was the
tyro's portion; he was too old to treat such insolence with the
scorn it deserved. Of course he had lived the affair down; but the
result of it would seem to be a bottomless <i>ennui</i>, a
<i>tedium vitae</i> that had something pathological about it. Under
its influence the homeliest trifles swelled to feats beyond his
strength. There was, for instance, the putting on and off one's
clothing: this infinite boredom of straps and buttons&mdash;and all
for what? For a day that would be an exact copy of the one that had
gone before, a night as unrefreshing as the last. Did any one
suspect that there were moments when he quailed before this job,
suspect that more than once he had even reckoned the number of
times he would be called on to perform it, day in, day out, till
that garment was put on him that came off no more; or that he could
understand and feel sympathy with those faint souls&mdash;and there
were such&mdash;who laid hands on themselves rather than go on
doing it: did this get abroad, he would be considered ripe for
Bedlam.</p>

<p>Physician, heal thyself! He swallowed doses of a tonic
preparation, and put himself on a fatty diet.</p>

<p>Thereafter he tried to take a philosophic view of his case. He
had now, he told himself, reached an age when such a state of mind
gave cause neither for astonishment nor alarm. How often had it not
fallen to him, in his role of medical adviser, to reassure a
patient on this score. The arrival of middle age brought about a
certain lowness of spirits in even the most robust: along with a
more or less marked bodily languor went an uneasy sense of coming
loss: the time was at hand to bid farewell to much that had
hitherto made life agreeable; and for most this was a bitter pill.
Meanwhile, one held a kind of mental stocktaking. As often as not
by the light of a complete disillusionment. Of the many glorious
things one had hoped to do&mdash;or to be&mdash;nothing was
accomplished: the great realisation, in youth breathlessly chased
but never grasped, was now seen to be a mist-wraith, which could
wear a thousand forms, but invariably turned to air as one came up
with it. In nine instances out of ten there was nothing to put in
its place; and you began to ask yourself in a kind of horrific
amaze: "Can this be all?...<i>this</i>? For this the pother of
growth, the struggles, and the sufferings?" The soul's climacteric,
if you would, from which a mortal came forth dulled to resignation;
or greedy for the few physical pleasures left him; or prone to that
tragic clinging to youth's skirts, which made the later years of
many women and not a few men ridiculous. In each case the motive
power was the same: the haunting fear that one had squeezed life
dry; worse still, that it had not been worth the squeezing.</p>

<p>Thus his reason. But, like a tongue of flame, his instinct leapt
up to give combat. By the gods, this cap did <i>not</i> fit him!
Squeezed life try?...found it not worth while? Why, he had never
got within measurable distance of what he called life, at all!
There could be no question of him resigning himself: deep down in
him, he knew, was an enormous residue of vitality, of untouched
mental energy that only waited to be drawn on. It was like a buried
treasure, jealously kept for the event of his one day catching up
with life: not the bare scramble for a living that here went by
that name, but Life with a capital L, the existence he had once
confidently counted on as his&mdash;a tourney of spiritual
adventuring, of intellectual excitement, in which the prize striven
for was not money or anything to do with money. Far away, thousands
of miles off, luckier men than he were in the thick of it. He, of
his own free will, had cut himself adrift, and now it was too
late.</p>

<p>But was it? Had the time irretrievably gone by? The ancient idea
of escape, long dormant, suddenly reawoke in him with a new force.
And, once stirring, it was not to be silenced, but went on sounding
like a ground-tone through all he did. At first he shut his ears to
it, to dally with side issues. For example, he worried the question
why the breaking-point should only now have been reached and not
six months, a year ago. It was quibbling to lay the whole blame on
Ocock's shoulders. The real cause went deeper, was of older growth.
And driving his mind back over the past, he believed he could pin
his present loss of grip to that fatal day on which he learnt that
his best friend had betrayed him. Things like that gave you a crack
that would not mend. He had been rendered suspicious where he had
once been credulous; prone to see evil where no evil was. For,
deceived by Purdy, in whom could he trust? Of a surety not in the
pushful set of jobbers and tricksters he was condemned to live
amongst. No discoveries he might make about them would surprise
him.&mdash;And once more the old impotent anger with himself broke
forth, that he should ever have let himself take root in such
detestable surroundings.</p>

<p>Why not shake the dust of the country off his feet?&mdash;From
this direct attack he recoiled, casting up his hands as if against
the evil eye. What next? But exclaim as he might, now that the idea
had put on words, it was by no means so simple to fend it off as
when it had been a mere vague humming at the back of his mind. It
seized him; swept his brain bare of other thoughts. He began to
look worn. And never more so than when he imagined himself taking
the bull by the horns and asking Mary's approval of his wild-goose
scheme. He could picture her face, when she heard that he planned
throwing up his fine position and decamping on nothing a year. The
vision was a cold douche to his folly. No, no! it would not do. You
could not accustom a woman to ease and luxury and then, when you
felt <i>you</i> had had enough and would welcome a return to
Spartan simplicity, to an austere clarity of living, expect her to
be prepared, at the word, to step back into poverty. One was
bound...bound...and by just those silken threads which, in
premarital days, had seemed sheerly desirable. He wondered now what
it would be like to stand free as the wind, answerable only to
himself. The bare thought of it filled him as with the rushing of
wings.</p>

<p>Once he had been within an ace of cutting and running. That was
in the early days, soon after his marriage. Trade had petered out;
and there would have been as little to leave behind as to carry
with him. But, even so, circumstances had proved too strong for
him: what with Mary's persuasions and John's intermeddling, his
scheme had come to nothing. And if, with so much in his favour, he
had not managed to carry it out, how in all the world could he hope
to now, when every thing conspired against him. It was, besides,
excusable in youth to challenge fortune; a very different matter
for one of his age.</p>

<p>Of his age!...the words gave him pause. By their light he saw
why he had knuckled under so meekly, at the time of his first
attempt. It was because then a few years one way or another did not
signify; he had them to spare. Now, each individual year was
precious to him; he parted with it lingeringly, unwillingly. Time
had taken to flashing past, too; Christmas was hardly celebrated
before it was again at the door. Another ten years or so and he
would be an old man, and it would in very truth be too late. The
tempter voice&mdash;in this case also the voice of
reason&mdash;said: now or never!</p>

<p>But when he came to look the facts in the face his heart failed
him anew, so heavily did the arguments against his taking such a
step&mdash;and, true to his race, it was these he began by
marshalling&mdash;weigh down the scales. He should have done it, if
done it was to be, five...three...eve a couple of years ago. Each
day that dawned added to the tangle, made the idea seem more
preposterous. Local dignities had been showered on him: he sat on
the Committees of the District Hospital and the Benevolent Asylum;
was Honorary Medical Officer to this Society and that; a trustee of
the church; one of the original founders of the Mechanics'
Institute; vice-president of the Botanical Society; and so on,
<i>ad infinitum</i>. His practice was second to none; his
visiting-book rarely shewed a blank space; people drove in from
miles round to consult him. In addition, he had an extremely
popular wife, a good house and garden, horses and traps, and a sure
yearly income of some twelve or thirteen hundred. Of what stuff was
he made, that he could lightly contemplate turning his back on
prizes such as these?</p>

<p>Even as he told them off, however, the old sense of hollowness
was upon him again. His life there reminded him of a gaudy
drop-scene, let down before an empty stage; a painted sham, with
darkness and vacuity behind. At bottom, none of these distinctions
and successes meant anything to him; not a scrap of mental pabulum
could be got from them: rather would he have chosen to be poor and
a nobody among people whose thoughts flew to meet his half-way. And
there was also another side to it. Stingy though the years had been
of intellectual grist, they had not scrupled to rob him of many an
essential by which he set store. His old faculty&mdash;for good or
evil&mdash;of swift decision, for instance. It was lost to him now;
as witness his present miserable vacillation. It had gone off
arm-in-arm with his health; physically he was but a ghost of the
man he had once been. But the bitterest grudge he bore the life was
for the shipwreck it had made of his early ideals. He remembered
the pure joy, the lofty sentiments with which he had returned to
medicine. Bah!&mdash;there had been no room for any sentimental
nonsense of that kind here. He had long since ceased to follow his
profession disinterestedly; the years had made a hack of
him&mdash;a skilled hack, of course&mdash;but just a hack. He had
had no time for study; all his strength had gone in keeping his
income up to a certain figure; lest the wife should be less well
dressed and equipped than her neighbours; or patients fight shy of
him; or his confreres wag their tongues.&mdash;Oh! he had adapted
himself supremely well to the standards of this Australia,
so-called Felix. And he must not complain if, in so doing, he had
been stripped, not only of his rosy dreams, but also of that
spiritual force on which he could once have drawn at will. Like a
fool he had believed it possible to serve mammon with impunity, and
for as long as it suited him. He knew better now. At this moment he
was undergoing the sensations of one who, having taken shelter in
what he thinks a light and flimsy structure, finds that it is built
of the solidest stone. Worse still: that he has been walled up
inside.</p>

<p>And even suppose he <i>could</i> pull himself together for the
effort required, how justify his action in the eyes of the world?
His motives would be double-dutch to the hard-headed crew around
him; nor would any go to the trouble of trying to understand. There
was John. All John would see was an elderly and not over-robust man
deliberately throwing away the fruits of year-long toil&mdash;and
for what? For the privilege of, in some remote spot, as a stranger
and unknown, having his way to make all over again; of being free
to shoulder once more the risks and hazards the undertaking
involved. And little though he cared for John or any one else's
opinion, Mahony could not help feeling a trifle sore, in advance,
at the ridicule of which he might be the object, at the zanyish
figure he was going to be obliged to cut.</p>

<p>But a fig for what people thought of him! Once away from here he
would, he thanked God, never see any of them again. No, it was Mary
who was the real stumbling-block, the opponent he most feared. Had
he been less attached to her, the thing would have been easier; as
it was, he shrank from hurting her. And hurt and confuse her he
must. He knew Mary as well &mdash;nay, better than he knew his own
unreckonable self. For Mary was not a creature of moods, did not
change her mental envelope a dozen times a day. And just his
precise knowledge of her told him that he would never get her to
see eye to eye with him. Her clear, serene outlook was attuned to
the plain and the practical; she would discover a thousand
drawbacks to his scheme, but nary a one of the incorporeal benefits
he dreamed of reaping from it. There was his handling of money for
one thing: she had come, he was aware, to regard him as incurably
extravagant; and it would be no easy task to convince her that he
could learn again to fit his expenses to a light purse. She had a
woman's instinctive distrust, too, of leaving the beaten track.
Another point made him still more dubious. Mary's whole heart and
happiness were bound up in this place where she had spent the
flower-years of her life: who knew if she would thrive as well on
other soil? He found it intolerable to think that she might have to
pay for his want of stability.&mdash;Yes, reduced to its
essentials, it came to mean the pitting of one soul's welfare
against that of another; was a toss-up between his happiness and
hers. One of them would have to yield. Who would suffer more by
doing so &mdash;he or she? He believed that a sacrifice on his part
would make the wreck of his life complete. On hers&mdash;well,
thanks to her doughty habit of finding good everywhere, there was a
chance of her coming out unscathed.</p>

<p>Here was his case in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Still he did not tackle Mary. For sometimes, after all, a
disturbed doubt crept upon him whether it would not be possible to
go on as he was; instead of, as she would drastically word it,
cutting his throat with his own hand. And to be perfectly honest,
he believed it would. He could now afford to pay for help in his
work; to buy what books he needed or fancied; to take holidays
while putting in a <i>locum</i>; even to keep on the <i>locum</i>,
at a good salary, while he journeyed overseas to visit the land of
his birth. But at this another side of him&mdash;what he thought of
as spirit, in contradistinction to soul&mdash;cried out in alarm,
fearful lest it was again to be betrayed. Thus far, though by
rights coequal in the house of the body, it had been rigidly kept
down. Nevertheless it had persisted, like a bright cold little
spark at dead of night: his restlessness, the spiritual malaise
that encumbered him had been its mute form of protest. Did he go on
turning a deaf ear to its warnings, he might do himself irreparable
harm. For time was flying, the sum of his years mounting, shrinking
that roomy future to which he had thus far always postponed what
seemed too difficult for the moment. Now he saw that he dared delay
no longer in setting free the imprisoned elements in him, was he
ever to grow to that complete whole which each mortal aspires to
be.&mdash;That a change of environment would work this miracle he
did not doubt; a congenial environment was meat and drink to him,
was light and air. Here in this country, he had remained as utterly
alien as any Jew of old who wept by the rivers of Babylon. And like
a half-remembered tune there came floating into his mind words he
had lit on somewhere, or learnt on the school-bench&mdash;Horace,
he thought, but, whatever their source, words that fitted his case
to a nicety. COELUM, NON ANIMUM, MUTANT, QUI TRANS MARE CURRUNT.
"Non animum"? Ah! could he but have foreseen this&mdash;foreknown
it. If not before he set sail on what was to have been but a swift
adventure, then at least on that fateful day long past when, foiled
by Mary's pleadings and his own inertia, he had let himself be
bound anew.</p>

<p>Thus the summer dragged by; a summer to try the toughest. Mahony
thought he had never gone through its like for heat and discomfort.
The drought would not break, and on the great squatting-stations
round Ballarat and to the north, the sheep dropped like flies at an
early frost. The forest reservoirs dried up, displaying the red mud
of their bottoms, and a bath became a luxury&mdash;or a
penance&mdash;the scanty water running thick and red. Then the bush
caught fire and burnt for three days, painting the sky a rusty
brown, and making the air hard to breathe. Of a morning his first
act on going into his surgery was to pick up the thermometer that
stood on the table. Sure as fate, though the clock had not long
struck nine, the mercury marked something between a hundred and a
hundred and five degrees. He let it fall with a nerveless gesture.
Since his sunstroke he not only hated, he feared the sun. But out
into it he must, to drive through dust-clouds so opaque that one
could only draw rein till they subsided, meanwhile holloaing off
collisions. Under the close leather hood he sat and stifled; or,
removing his green goggles for the fiftieth time, climbed down to
enter yet another baked wooden house, where he handled prostrate
bodies rank with sweat, or prescribed for pallid or fever-speckled
children. Then home, to toy with the food set before him, his mind
already running on the discomforts of the afternoon.&mdash;Two bits
of ill-luck came his way this summer. Old Ocock fell, in
dismounting from a vehicle, and sustained a compound fracture of
the femur. Owing to his advanced age there was for a time fear of
malunion of the parts, and this kept Mahony on the rack. Secondly,
a near neighbour, a common little fellow who kept a jeweller's shop
in Bridge Street, actually took the plunge: sold off one fine day
and sailed for home. And this seemed the unkindest cut of all.</p>

<p>But the accident that gave the death-blow to his scruples was
another. On the advice of a wealthy publican he was treating, whose
judgment he trusted, Mahony had invested&mdash;heavily for him,
selling off other stock to do it&mdash;in a company known as the
Hodderburn Estate. This was a government affair and ought to have
been beyond reproach. One day, however, it was found that the
official reports of the work done by the diamond drill-bore were
cooked documents; and instantly every one connected with the
mine&mdash;directors, managers, engineers&mdash;lay under the
suspicion of fraudulent dealings. Shares had risen as high as ten
pounds odd; but when the drive reached the bore and, in place of
the deep gutter-ground the public had been led to expect, hard rock
was found overhead, there was a panic; shares dropped to
twenty-five shillings and did not rally. Mahony was a loser by six
hundred pounds, and got, besides, a moral shaking from which he
could not recover. He sat and bit his little-finger nail to the
quick. Was he, he savagely asked himself, going to linger on until
the little he had managed to save was snatched from him?</p>

<p>He dashed off a letter to John, asking his brother-in-law to
recommend a reliable broker. And this done, he got up to look for
Mary, determined to come to grips with her at last.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-1-4-11" id="ch-1-4-11"></a>Chapter XI</h3>

<p>How to begin, how reduce to a few plain words his subtle tangle
of thought and feeling, was the problem.</p>

<p>He did not find his wife on her usual seat in the arbour. In
searching for her, upstairs and down, he came to a rapid decision.
He would lay chief stress on his poor state of health.</p>

<p>"I feel I'm killing myself. I can't go on."</p>

<p>"But Richard dear!" ejaculated Mary, and paused in her sewing,
her needle uplifted, a bead balanced on its tip. Richard had run
her to earth in the spare bedroom, to which at this time she often
repaired. For he objected to the piece of work she had on
hand&mdash;that of covering yards of black cashmere with minute jet
beads&mdash;vowing that she would ruin her eyesight over it. So,
having set her heart on a fashionable polonaise, she was careful to
keep out of his way.</p>

<p>"I'm not a young man any longer, wife. When one's past
forty..."</p>

<p>"Poor mother used to say forty-five was a man's prime of
life."</p>

<p>"Not for me. And not here in this God-forsaken hole!"</p>

<p>"Oh dear me! I do wonder why you have such a down on Ballarat.
I'm sure there must be many worse places in the world to live in",
and lowering her needle, Mary brought the bead to its appointed
spot. "Of course you have a lot to do, I know, and being such a
poor sleeper doesn't improve matters." But she was considering her
pattern sideways as she spoke, thinking more of it than of what she
said. Every one had to work hard out here; compared with some she
could name, Richard's job of driving round in a springy buggy
seemed ease itself. "Besides I told you at the time you were wrong
not to take a holiday in winter, when you had the chance. You need
a thorough change every year to set you up. You came back from the
last as fresh as a daisy."</p>

<p>"The only change that will benefit me is one for good and all,"
said Mahony with extreme gloom. He had thrown up the bed-curtain
and stretched himself on the bed, where he lay with his hands
clasped under his neck.</p>

<p>Tutored by experience, Mary did not contradict him.</p>

<p>"And it's the kind I've finally made up my mind to take."</p>

<p>"Richard! How you do run on!" and Mary, still gently incredulous
but a thought wider awake, let her work sink to her lap. "What is
the use of talking like that?"</p>

<p>"Believe it or not, my dear, as you choose. You'll
see&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>At her further exclamations of doubt and amazement, Mahony's
patience slipped its leash. "Surely to goodness my health comes
first...before any confounded practice?"</p>

<p>"Ssh! Baby's asleep.&mdash;And don't get cross, Richard. You can
hardly expect me not to be surprised when you spring a thing of
this sort on me. You've never even dropped a hint of it
before."</p>

<p>"Because I knew very well what it would be. You dead against it,
of course!"</p>

<p>"Now I call that unjust. You've barely let me get a word in
edgeways."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know by heart everything you're going to say. It's
nonsense...folly...madness...and so on: all the phrases you women
fish up from your vocabulary when you want to stave off a
change&mdash;hinder any alteration of the <i>status quo</i>. But
I'll tell you this, wife. You'll bury me here, if I don't get away
soon. I'm not much more than skin and bone as it is. And I confess,
if I've got to be buried I'd rather lie elsewhere&mdash;have good
English earth atop of me."</p>

<p>Had Mary been a man, she might have retorted that this was a
very woman's way of shifting ground. She bit her lip and did not
answer immediately. Then: "You know I can't bear to hear you talk
like that, even in fun. Besides, you always say much more than you
mean, dear."</p>

<p>"Very well then, if you prefer it, wait and see! You'll be sorry
some day."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me, Richard, you're in earnest, when you
talk of selling off your practice and going to England?"</p>

<p>"I can buy another there, can't I?"</p>

<p>With these words he leapt to his feet, afire with animation. And
while Mary, now thoroughly uneasy, was folding up her work, he
dilated upon the benefits that would accrue to them from the
change. Good-bye to dust, and sun, and drought, to blistering hot
winds and <i>papier mache</i> walls! They would make their new home
in some substantial old stone house that had weathered half a
century or more, tangled over with creepers, folded away in its own
privacy as only an English house could be. In the flower-garden
roses would trail over arch and pergola; there would be a lawn with
shaped yews on it; while in the orchard old apple-trees would
flaunt their red abundance above grey, lichened walls.</p>

<p>("As if there weren't apples enough here!" thought Mary.)</p>

<p>He got a frog in his throat as he went on to paint in greater
detail for her, who had left it so young, the intimate charm of the
home country&mdash;the rich, green, dimpled countryside. And not
till now did he grasp how sorely he had missed it. "Oh, believe me,
to talk of 'going home' is no mere figure of speech, Mary!" In
fancy he trod winding lanes that ran between giant hedges: hedges
in tender bud, with dew on them; or snowed over with white
mayflowers; or behung with the fairy webs and gossamer of early
autumn, thick as twine beneath their load of moisture. He followed
white roads that were banked with primroses and ran headlong down
to the sea; he climbed the shoulder of a down on a spring morning,
when the air was alive with larks carolling. But chiefly it was the
greenness that called to him&mdash;the greenness of the greenest
country in the world. Viewed from this distance, the homeland
looked to him like one vast meadow. Oh, to tread its grass
again!&mdash;not what one knew as grass here, a poor annual, that
lasted for a few brief weeks; but lush meadow-grass, a foot high;
or shaven emerald lawns on which ancient trees spread their shade;
or the rank growth in old orchards, starry with wild flowers, on
which fruit-blossoms fluttered down. He longed, too, for the
exquisite finishedness of the mother country, the soft tints of
cloud-veiled northern skies. His eyes ached, his brows had grown
wrinkled from gazing on iron roofs set against the hard blue
overhead; on dirty weatherboards innocent of paint; on
higgledy-piggledy backyards and ramshackle fences; on the
straggling landscape with its untidy trees&mdash;all the unrelieved
ugliness, in short, of the colonial scene.</p>

<p>He stopped only for want of breath. Mary was silent. He waited.
Still she did not speak.</p>

<p>He fell to earth with a bump, and was angry. "Come...out with
it! I suppose all this seems to you just the raving of a
lunatic?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, no. But a little...well, a little unpractical. I
never heard before of any one throwing up a good income because he
didn't like the scenery. It's a step that needs the greatest
consideration."</p>

<p>"Good God! Do you think I haven't considered it?&mdash;and from
every angle? There isn't an argument for or against, that I haven't
gone over a thousand and one times."</p>

<p>"And with never a word to me, Richard?" Mary was hurt; and
showed it. "It really is hardly fair. For this is my home as well
as yours.&mdash;But now listen. You're tired out, run down with the
heat and that last attack of dysentery. Take a good
holiday&mdash;stay away for three months if you like. Sail over to
Hobart Town, or up to Sydney, you who'er so fond of the water. And
when you come back strong and well we'll talk about all this again.
I'm sure by then you'll see things with other eyes."</p>

<p>"And who's to look after the practice, pray?"</p>

<p>"Why, a <i>locum tenens</i>, of course. Or engage an
assistant."</p>

<p>"Aha! you'd agree to that now, would you? I remember how opposed
you were once to the idea."</p>

<p>"Well, if I have to choose between it and you giving up
altogether...Now, for your own sake, Richard, don't go and do
anything rash. If once you sell off and leave Ballarat, you can
never come back. And then, if you regret it, where will you be?
That's why I say don't hurry to decide. Sleep over it. Or let us
consult somebody&mdash;John perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No you don't, madam, no you don't!" cried Richard with a grim
dash of humour. "You had me once...crippled me...handcuffed
me&mdash;you and your John between you! It shan't happen
again."</p>

<p>"I crippled you? I, Richard! Why, never in my life have I done
anything but what I thought was for your good. I've always put you
first." And Mary's eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"Yes, where it's a question of one's material welfare you
haven't your equal&mdash;I admit that. But the other side of me
needs coddling too&mdash;yes, and sympathy. But it can whistle for
such a thing as far as you're concerned."</p>

<p>Mary sighed. "I think you don't realise, dear, how difficult it
sometimes is to understand you...or to make out what you really do
want," she said slowly.</p>

<p>Her tone struck at his heart. "Indeed and I do!" he cried
contritely. "I'm a born old grumbler, mavourneen, I
know&mdash;contrariness in person! But in this case...come, love,
do try to grasp what I'm after; it means so much to me." And he
held out his hand to her, to beseech her.</p>

<p>Unhesitatingly she laid hers in it. "I am trying, Richard,
though you mayn't believe it. I always do. And even if I sometimes
can't manage it &mdash;well, you know, dear, you generally get your
own way in the end. Think of the house. I'm still not clear why you
altered it. I liked it much better as it was. But I didn't make any
fuss, did I?&mdash;though I should have, if I'd thought we were
only to occupy it for a single year after. &mdash;Still, that was a
trifle compared with what you want to do now. Though I lived to a
hundred I should never be able to approve of this. And you don't
know how hard it is to consent to a thing one disapproves of. You
couldn't do it yourself. Oh, what <i>was</i> the use, Richard, of
toiling as you have, if now, just when you can afford to charge
higher fees and the practice is beginning to bring in
money&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mahony let her hand drop, even giving it a slight push from him,
and turned to pace the floor anew. "Oh, money, money, money! I'm
sick of the very sound of the word. But you talk as if nothing else
mattered. Can't you for once, wife, see through the letter of the
thing to the spirit behind? I admit the practice <i>has</i> brought
in a tidy income of late; but as for the rest of the splendours,
they exist, my dear, only in your imagination. If you ask me, I say
I lead a dog's life&mdash;why, even a navvy works only for a fixed
number of hours per diem! My days have neither beginning nor end.
Look at yesterday! Out in the blazing sun from morning till
night&mdash;I didn't get back from the second round till nine. At
ten a confinement that keeps me up till three. From three till dawn
I toss and turn, far too weary to sleep. By the time six o'clock
struck&mdash;you of course were slumbering sweetly&mdash;I was in
hell with tic. At seven I could stand it no longer and got up for
the chloroform bottle: an hour's rest at any price&mdash;else how
face the crowd in the waiting-room? And you call that
splendour?&mdash;luxurious ease? If so, my dear, words have not the
same meaning any more for you and me."</p>

<p>Mary did not point out that she had said nothing of the kind, or
that he had set up an extreme case as typical. She tightened her
lips; her big eyes were very solemn.</p>

<p>"And it's not the work alone," Richard was declaring, "it's the
place, wife&mdash;the people. I'm done with 'em, Mary&mdash;utterly
done! Upon my word, if I thought I had to go on living among them
even for another twelvemonth..."</p>

<p>"But <i>people</i> are the same all the world over!" The protest
broke from her in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"No, by God, they're not!" And here Richard launched out into a
diatribe against his fellow-colonists: "This sordid riff-raff!
These hard, mean, grasping money-grubbers!" that made Mary stand
aghast. What could be the matter with him? What was he thinking of,
he who was ordinarily so generous? Had he forgotten the many
kindnesses shown him, the warm gratitude of his patients, people's
sympathy, at the time of his illness? But he went on: "My demands
are most modest. All I ask is to live among human beings with whom
I have half an idea in common&mdash;men who sometimes raise their
noses from the ground, instead of eternally scheming how to line
their pockets, reckoning human progress solely in terms of l.s.d.
No, I've sacrificed enough of my life to this country. I mean to
have the rest for myself. And there's another thing, my
dear&mdash;another bad habit this precious place breeds in us. It
begins by making us indifferent to those who belong to us but are
out of our sight, and ends by cutting our closest ties. I don't
mean by distance alone. I have an old mother still living, Mary,
whose chief prayer is that she may see me once again before she
dies. I was her last-born&mdash;the child her arms kept the shape
of. What am I to her now?...what does she know of me, of the hard,
tired, middle-aged man I have become? And you are in much the same
box, my dear; unless you've forgotten by now that you ever had a
mother."</p>

<p>Mary was scandalised. "Forget one's mother?...Richard! I think
you're trying what dreadful things you can find to say...when I
write home every three months!" And provoked by this fresh piece of
unreason she opened fire in earnest, in defence of what she
believed to be their true welfare. Richard listened to her without
interrupting; even seemed to grant the truth of what she said. But
none the less, even as she pleaded with him, a numbing sense of
futility crept over her. She stuttered, halted, and finally fell
silent. Her words were like so many lassos thrown after his vagrant
soul; and this was out of reach. It had sniffed freedom&mdash;it
<i>was</i> free; ran wild already on the boundless plains of
liberty.</p>

<p>After he had gone from the room she sat with idle hands. She was
all in a daze. Richard was about to commit an out-and-out folly,
and she was powerless to hinder it. If only she had had some one
she could have talked things over with, taken advice of! But
no&mdash;it went against the grain in her to discuss her husband's
actions with a third person. Purdy had been the sole exception, and
Purdy had become impossible.</p>

<p>Looking back, she marvelled at her own dullness in not
fore-seeing that something like this might happen. What more
natural than that the multitude of little whims and fads Richard
had indulged should culminate in a big whim of this kind? But the
acknowledgment caused her fresh anxiety. She had watched him tire,
like a fickle child, of first one thing, then another; was it
likely that he would now suddenly prove more stable? She did not
think so. For she attributed his present mood of pettish aversion
wholly to the fact of his being run down in health. It was quite
true: he had not been himself of late. But, here again, he was so
fanciful that you never knew how literally to take his ailments:
half the time she believed he just imagined their existence; and
the long holiday she had urged on him would have been enough to
sweep the cobwebs from his brain. Oh, if only he could have held on
in patience! Four or five years hence, at most, he might have
considered retiring from general practice. She almost wept as she
remembered how they had once planned to live for that day. Now it
was all to end in smoke.</p>

<p>Then her mind reverted to herself and to what the break would
mean to her; and her little world rocked to its foundations. For no
clear call went out to Mary from her native land. She docilely said
"home" with the rest, and kept her family ties intact; but she had
never expected to go back, except on a flying visit. She thought of
England rather vaguely as a country where it was always raining,
and where&mdash;according to John&mdash;an assemblage of old
fogies, known as the House of Commons, persistently intermeddled in
the affairs of the colony. For more than half her life&mdash;and
the half that truly counted&mdash;Australia had been her home.</p>

<p>Her home! In fancy she made a round of the house, viewing each
cosy room, lingering fondly over the contents of cupboards and
presses, recollecting how she had added this piece of furniture for
convenience' sake, that for ornament, till the whole was as perfect
as she knew how to make it. Now, everything she loved and
valued&mdash;the piano, the wax-candle chandelier, the gilt
cornices, the dining-room horsehair&mdash;would fall under the
auctioneer's hammer, go to deck out the houses of other people.
Richard said she could buy better and handsomer things in England;
but Mary allowed herself no illusions on this score. Where was the
money to come from? She had learnt by personal experience what slow
work building up a practice was. It would be years and years before
they could hope for another such home. And sore and sorry as
<i>she</i> might feel at having to relinquish her pretty things, in
Richard's case it would mean a good deal more than that. To him the
loss of them would be a real misfortune, so used had he grown to
luxury and comfort, so strongly did the need of it run in his
blood.</p>

<p>Worse still was the prospect of parting from relatives and
friends. The tears came at this, freely. John's children!&mdash;who
would watch over them when she was gone? How could she, from so far
away, keep the promise she had made to poor Jinny on her death-bed?
She would have to give up the baby of which she had grown so
fond&mdash;give it back into Zara's unmotherly hands. And never
again of a Saturday would she fetch poor little long-legged Trotty
from school. She must say good-bye to one and to all&mdash;to John,
and Zara, and Jerry&mdash;and would know no more, at close
quarters, how they fared. When Jerry married there would be no one
to see to it that he chose the right girl. Then Ned and
Polly&mdash;poor souls, poor souls! What with the rapid increase of
their family and Ned's unsteadiness&mdash;he could not keep any job
long because of it&mdash;they only just contrived to make ends
meet. How they would do it when she was not there to lend a helping
hand, she could not imagine. And outside her brothers and sisters
there was good Mrs. Devine. Mary had engaged to guide her friend's
tottery steps on the slippery path of Melbourne society, did Mr.
Devine enter the ministry. And poor little Agnes with her terrible
weakness...and Amelia and her sickly babes...and Tilly, dear, good,
warm-hearted Tilly! Never again would the pair of them enjoy one of
their jolly laughs; or cook for a picnic; or drive out to a
mushroom hunt. No, the children would grow up anyhow; her brothers
forget her in carving out their own lives; her friends find other
friends.</p>

<p>For some time, however, she kept her own counsel. But when she
had tried by hook and by crook to bring Richard to reason, and
failed; when she saw that he was actually beginning, on the quiet,
to make ready for departure, and that the day was coming on which
every one would have to know: then she threw off her reserve. She
was spending the afternoon with Tilly. They sat on the verandah
together, John's child, black-eyed, fat, self-willed, playing,
after the manner of two short years, at their feet. At the news
that was broken to her Tilly began by laughing immoderately,
believing that Mary was "taking a rise out of her." But having
studied her friend's face she let her work fall, slowly opened
mouth and eyes, and was at first unequal to uttering a word.</p>

<p>Thereafter she bombarded Mary with questions.</p>

<p>"Wants to leave Ballarat? To go home to England?" she echoed,
with an emphasis such as Tilly alone could lay. "Well! of all
the...What for? What on earth for? 'As somebody gone and left 'im a
fortune? Or 'as 'e been appointed pillmonger-in-ordinary to the
Queen 'erself? What is it, Mary? What's up?"</p>

<p>What indeed! This was the question Mary dreaded, and one that
would leap to every tongue: why was he going? She sat on the horns
of a dilemma. It was not in her to wound people's feelings by
blurting out the truth&mdash;this would also put Richard in a bad
light&mdash;and, did she give no reason at all, many would think he
had taken leave of his senses. Weakly, in a very un-Maryish
fashion, she mumbled that his health was not what it should be, and
he had got it into his head that for this the climate of the colony
was to blame. Nothing would do him but to return to England.</p>

<p>"I never! No, never in my born days did I hear tell of such a
thing!" and Tilly, exploding, brought her closed fist heavily down
on her knee. "Mary!...for a mere maggot like that, to chuck up a
practice such as 'e's got. Upon my word, my dear, it looks as if 'e
was touched 'ere,"&mdash;and she significantly tapped her forehead.
"Ha! Now I understand. You know I've seen quite well, love, you've
been looking a bit down in the mouth of late. And so 'as pa noticed
it, too. After you'd gone the other day, 'e said to me: 'Looks
reflexive-like does the little lady nowadays; as if she'd got
something on 'er mind.' And I to him: 'Pooh! Isn't it enough that
she's got to put up with the cranks and crotchets of one o'
<i>your</i> sect?'&mdash;Oh Mary, my dear, there's many a true word
said in jest. Though little did I think what the crotchet would
be." And slowly the rims of Tilly's eyes and the tip of her nose
reddened and swelled.</p>

<p>"No, I can't picture it, Mary&mdash;what it'ull be like 'ere
without you," she said; and pulling out her handkerchief blew snort
after snort, which was Tilly's way nowadays of having a good cry.
"There, there, Baby, Auntie's only got the sniffles.&mdash;For just
think of it, Mary: except that first year or so after you were
married, we've been together, you and me, pretty much ever since
you came to us that time at the 'otel&mdash;a little black midget
of a thing in short frocks. I can still remember 'ow Jinn and I
laughed at the idea of you teaching us; and 'ow poor ma said to
wait and make sure we weren't laughing on the wrong side of our
mouths. And ma was right as usual. For if ever a clever little kid
trod the earth, it was you."</p>

<p>Mary pooh-poohed the cleverness. "I knew very little more than
you yourselves. No, it was you who were all so kind to me. I had
been feeling so lonely&mdash;as if nobody wanted me&mdash;and I
shall never forget how mother put her arms round me and cuddled me,
and how safe and comfortable I felt. It was always just like home
there to me."</p>

<p>"And why not, I'd like to know!&mdash;Look 'ere, Mary, I'm going
to ask you something, plump and plain. 'Ave you really been happy
in your marriage, my dear, or 'ave you not? You're such a loyal
little soul, I know you'd never show it if you weren't; and
sometimes I've 'ad my doubts about you, Mary. For you and the
doctor are just as different as chalk and cheese."</p>

<p>"Of course I have&mdash;as happy as the day's long!" cried Mary,
sensitive as ever to a reflection on her husband. "You mustn't
think anything like that, Tilly. I couldn't imagine myself married
to anyone but Richard."</p>

<p>"Then that only makes it harder for you now, poor thing, pulled
two ways like, as you are," said Tilly, and trumpeted afresh. "All
the same, there isn't anything I'd stick at, Mary, to keep you
here. Don't be offended, my dear, but it doesn't matter half so
much about the doctor going as you. There's none cleverer than 'im,
of course, in 'is own line. But 'e's never fitted in properly
here&mdash;I don't want to exactly say 'e thinks 'imself too good
for us; but there is something, Mary love, and I'm not the only one
who's felt it. I've known people go on like anything about 'im
behind 'is back: nothing would induce them to have 'im and 'is
haughty airs inside their doors again, etcetera."</p>

<p>Mary flushed. "Yes, I know, people do sometimes judge Richard
very unkindly. For at heart he's the most modest of men. It's only
his manner. And he can't help that, can he?"</p>

<p>"There are those who say a doctor ought to be able to, my
dear.&mdash;But never mind him. Oh, it's you I feel for, Mary,
being dragged off like this. Can't you <i>do</i> anything, dear?
Put your foot down?"</p>

<p>Mary shook her head. "It's no use. Richard is so...well, so
queer in some ways, Tilly. Besides, you know, I don't think it
would be right of me to really pit my will against his."</p>

<p>"Poor little you!&mdash;Oh! men are queer fish, Mary, aren't
they? Not that I can complain; I drew a prize in the lucky-bag when
I took that old Jawkins in there. But when I look round me, or
think back, and see what we women put up with! There was poor old
ma; she 'ad to be man for both. And Jinn, Mary, who didn't dare to
call 'er soul 'er own. And milady Agnes is travelling the selfsame
road&mdash;why, she 'as to cock 'er eye at Henry nowadays before
she trusts 'erself to say whether it's beef or mutton she's eating!
And now 'ere's you, love, carted off with never a with-your-leave
or by-your-leave, just because the doctor's tired of it and thinks
'e'd like a change. There's no question of whether you're tired or
not&mdash;oh, my, no!"</p>

<p>"But he has to earn the money, Tilly. It isn't quite fair to put
it that way," protested her friend.</p>

<p>"Well! I don't know, Mary, I'm sure," and Tilly's plump person
rose and sank in a prodigious sigh. "But if I was 'is wife 'e
wouldn't get off so easy&mdash;I know that! It makes me just
boil."</p>

<p>Mary answered with a rueful smile. She could never be angry with
Richard in cold blood, or for long together.</p>

<p>As time went on, though, and the break-up of her home
began&mdash;by the auctioneer's man appearing to paw over and
appraise the furniture&mdash;a certain dull resentment did
sometimes come uppermost. Under its sway she had forcibly to remind
herself what a good husband Richard had always been; had to tell
off his qualities one by one, instead of taking them as hitherto
for granted. No, her quarrel, she began to see, was not so much
with him as with the Powers above. Why should <i>her</i> husband
alone not be as robust and hardy as all the other husbands in the
place? None of <i>their</i> healths threatened to fail, nor did any
of them find the conditions of the life intolerable. That was
another shabby trick Fate had played Richard in not endowing him
with worldly wisdom, and a healthy itch to succeed. Instead of
that, he had been blessed with ideas and impulses that stood
directly in his way.&mdash;And it was here that Mary bore more than
one of her private ambitions for him to its grave. A new expression
came into her eyes, too&mdash;an unsure, baffled look. Life was
not, after all, going to be the simple, straightforward affair she
had believed. Thus far, save for the one unhappy business with
Purdy, wrongs and complications had passed her by. Now she saw that
no more than anyone else could she hope to escape them.</p>

<p>Out of this frame of mind she wrote a long, confidential letter
to John: John must not be left in ignorance of what hung over her;
it was also a relief to unbosom herself to one of her own family.
And John was good enough to travel up expressly to talk things over
with her, and, as he put it, to "call Richard to order." Like every
one else he showed the whites of his eyes at the latter's flimsy
reasons for seeking a change. But when, in spite of her warning, he
bearded his brother-in-law with a jocose and hearty: "Come, come,
my dear Mahony! what's all this? You're actually thinking of giving
us the slip?" Richard took his interference so badly, became so
agitated over the head of the harmless question that John's airy
remonstrance died in his throat.</p>

<p>"Mad as a March hare!" was his private verdict, as he shook down
his ruffled plumes. To Mary he said ponderously: "Well, upon my
soul, my dear girl, I don't know&mdash;I am frankly at a loss what
to say. Measured by every practical standard, the step he
contemplates is little short of suicidal. I fear he will live to
regret it."</p>

<p>And Mary, who had not expected anything from John's
intervention, and also knew the grounds for Richard's
heat&mdash;Mary now resigned herself, with the best grace she could
muster, to the inevitable.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-1-4-12" id="ch-1-4-12"></a>Chapter XII</h3>

<p>House and practice sold for a good round sum; the brass plates
were removed from gate and door, leaving dirty squares flanked by
screw-holes; carpets came up and curtains down; and, like rats from
a doomed ship, men and women servants fled to other situations. One
fine day the auctioneer's bell was rung through the main streets of
the town; and both on this and the next, when the red flag flew in
front of the house, a troop of intending purchasers, together with
an even larger number of the merely curious, streamed in at the
gate and overran the premises. At noon the auctioneer mounted his
perch, gathered the crowd round him, and soon had the sale in full
swing, catching head-bobs, or wheedling and insisting with, when
persuasion could do no more, his monotonous parrot-cry of:
"Going...going...gone!"</p>

<p>It would have been in bad taste for either husband or wife to be
visible while the auction was in progress; and, the night before,
Mary and the child had moved to Tilly's, where they would stay for
the rest of the time. But Mahony was still hard at work. The job of
winding up and getting in the money owed him was no light one. For
the report had somehow got abroad that he was retiring from
practice because he had made his fortune; and only too many people
took this as a tacit permission to leave their bills unpaid.</p>

<p>He had locked himself and his account-books into a small back
room, where stood the few articles they had picked out to carry
with them: Mary's sewing-table, his first gift to her after
marriage; their modest stock of silver; his medical library. But he
had been forced to lower the blind, to hinder impertinent noses
flattening themselves against the window, and thus could scarcely
see to put pen to paper; while the auctioneer's grating voice was a
constant source of distraction&mdash;not to mention the rude
comments made by the crowd on house and furniture, the ceaseless
trying of the handle of the locked door.</p>

<p>When it came to the point, this tearing up of one's roots was a
murderous business&mdash;nothing for a man of his temperament. Mary
was a good deal better able to stand it than he. Violently as she
had opposed the move in the beginning, she was now, dear soul,
putting a cheery face on it. But then Mary belonged to that happy
class of mortals who could set up their Lares and Penates inside
any four walls. Whereas he was a very slave to associations. Did
she regret parting with a pretty table and a comfortable chair, it
was soley because of the prettiness and convenience: as long as she
could replace them by other articles of the same kind, she was
content. But to him each familiar object was bound by a thousand
memories. And it was the loss of these which could never be
replaced that cut him to the quick.</p>

<p>Meanwhile this was the kind of thing he had to listen to.</p>

<p>"'Ere now, ladies and gents, we 'ave a very fine pier
glass&mdash;a very chaste and tasty pier glass indeed&mdash;a red
addition to any lady's drawin'room.&mdash;Mrs. Rupp? Do I
understand you aright, Mrs. Rupp? Mrs. Rupp offers twelve bob for
this very 'andsome article. Twelve bob...going twelve...Fifteen?
Thank you, Mrs. Bromby! Going
fifteen...going&mdash;going&mdash;Eighteen? Right you are, my
dear!" and so on.</p>

<p>It had a history had that pier glass; its purchase dated from a
time in their lives when they had been forced to turn each shilling
in the palm. Mary had espied it one day in Plaistows' Stores, and
had set her heart on buying it. How she had schemed to scrape the
money together!&mdash;saving so much on a new gown, so much on
bonnet and mantle. He remembered, as if it were yesterday, the
morning on which she had burst in, eyes and cheeks aglow, to tell
him that she had managed it at last, and how they had gone off arm
in arm to secure the prize. Yes, for all their poverty, those had
been happy days. Little extravagances such as this, or the trifling
gifts they had contrived to make each other had given far more
pleasure than the costlier presents of later years.</p>

<p>"The next article I draw your attention to is a sofer," went on
the voice, sounding suddenly closer; and with a great trampling and
shuffling the crowd trooped after it to the adjoining room. "And a
very easy and comfortable piece o' furniture it is, too. A bit
shabby and worn 'ere and there, but not any the worse of that. You
don't need to worry if the kids play puff-puffs on it; and it fits
the shape o' the body all the better.&mdash;Any one like to try it?
Jest the very thing for a tired gent 'ome from biz, or 'andy to pop
your lady on when she faints&mdash;as the best of ladies will! Any
h'offers? Mr. de la Plastrier"&mdash;he said "Deelay
plastreer"&mdash;"a guinea? Thank you, mister. One guinea! Going a
guinea!&mdash;Now, <i>come</i> on, ladies and gen'elmen! D'ye think
I've got a notion to make you a present of it? What's that?
Two-and-twenty? Gawd! Is this a tiddlin' match?"</p>

<p>How proud he had been of that sofa! In his first surgery he had
had nowhere to lay an aching head. Well worn? Small wonder! He
would like to know how many hundreds of times he had flung himself
down on it, utterly played out. He had been used to lie there of an
evening, too, when Mary came in to chat about household affairs, or
report on her day's doings. And he remembered another time, when he
had spent the last hours of a distracted night on it...and how,
between sleeping and waking, he had strained his ears for footsteps
that never came.</p>

<p>The sofa was knocked down to his butcher for a couple of pounds,
and the crying&mdash;or decrying&mdash;of his bookcases began. He
could stand no more of it. Sweeping his papers into a bag, he
guiltily unlocked the door and stole out by way of kitchen and back
gate.</p>

<p>But once outside he did not know where to go or what to do.
Leaving the town behind him he made for the Lake, and roved
aimlessly and disconsolately about, choosing sheltered paths and
remote roads where he would be unlikely to run the gauntlet of
acquaintances. For he shrank from recognition on this particular
day, when all his domestic privacies were being bared to the public
view. But altogether of late he had fought shy of meeting people.
Their hard, matter-of-fact faces showed him only too plainly what
they thought of him. At first he had been fool enough to scan them
eagerly, in the hope of finding one saving touch of sympathy or
comprehension. But he might as well have looked for grief in the
eyes of an undertaker's mute. And so he had shrunk back into
himself, wearing his stiffest air as a shield and leaving it to
Mary to parry colonial inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>When he reckoned that he had allowed time enough for the
disposal of the last pots and pans, he rose and made his
way&mdash;well, the word "home" was by now become a mere figure of
speech. He entered a scene of the wildest confusion. The actual
sale was over, but the work of stripping the house only begun, and
successful bidders were dragging off their spoils. His
glass-fronted bookcase had been got as far as the surgery-door.
There it had stuck fast; and an angry altercation was going on, how
best to set it free. A woman passed him bearing Mary's girandoles;
another had the dining-room clock under her arm; a third trailed a
whatnot after her. To the palings of the fence several carts and
buggies had been hitched, and the horses were eating down his
neatly clipped hedge&mdash;it was all he could do not to rush out
and call their owners to account. The level sunrays flooded the
rooms, showing up hitherto unnoticed smudges and scratches on the
wall-papers; showing the prints of hundreds of dusty feet on the
carpetless floors. Voices echoed in hollow fashion through the
naked rooms; men shouted and spat as they tugged heavy articles
along the hall, or bumped them down the stairs. It was pandemonium.
The death of a loved human being could not, he thought, have been
more painful to witness. Thus a home went to pieces; thus was a
page of one's life turned.&mdash;He hastened away to rejoin
Mary.</p>

<p>There followed a week of Mrs. Tilly's somewhat stifling
hospitality, when one was forced three times a day to over-eat
oneself for fear of giving offence; followed formal presentations
of silver and plate from Masonic Lodge and District Hospital, as
well as a couple of public testimonials got up by his medical
brethren. But at length all was over: the last visit had been paid
and received, the last evening party in their honour sat through;
and Mahony breathed again. He had felt stiff and unnatural under
this overdose of demonstrativeness. Now&mdash;as always on sighting
relief from a state of things that irked him&mdash;he underwent a
sudden change, turned hearty and spontaneous, thus innocently
succeeding in leaving a good impression behind him. He kept his
temper, too, in all the fuss and ado of departure: the running to
and fro after missing articles, the sitting on the lids of
overflowing trunks, the strapping of carpet-bags, affixing of
labels. Their luggage hoisted into a spring-cart, they themselves
took their seats in the buggy and were driven to the railway
station; and to himself Mahony murmured an
all's-well&mdash;that-ends-well. On alighting, however, he found
that his greatcoat had been forgotten. He had to re-seat himself in
the buggy and gallop back to the house, arriving at the station
only just in time to leap into the train.</p>

<p>"A close shave that!" he ejaculated as he sank on the cushions
and wiped his face. "And in more senses than one, my dear. In
tearing round a corner we nearly had a nasty spill. Had I pitched
out and broken my neck, this hole would have got my bones after
all.&mdash;Not that I was sorry to miss that cock-and-hen-show,
Mary. It was really too much of a good thing altogether."</p>

<p>For a large and noisy crowd had gathered round the door of the
carriage to wish the travellers god-speed, among them people to
whom Mahony could not even put a name, whose very existence he had
forgotten. And it had fairly snowed last gifts and keepsakes.
Drying her eyes, Mary now set to collecting and arranging these.
"Just fancy so many turning up, dear. The railway people must have
wondered what was the matter.&mdash;Oh, by the way, did you
notice&mdash;I don't think you did, you were in such a
rush&mdash;who I was speaking to as you ran up? It was Jim, Old
Jim, but so changed I hardly knew him. As spruce as could be, in a
black coat and a belltopper. He's married again, he told me, and
has one of the best-paying hotels in Smythesdale. Yes, and he was
at the sale, too&mdash;he came over specially for it&mdash;to buy
the piano."</p>

<p>"He did, confound him!" cried Mahony hotly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't look at it that way, Richard. As long as he has
the money to pay for it. Fancy, he told me had always admired the
'tune' of it so much, when I played and sang. My dear little
piano!"</p>

<p>"You shall have another and a better one, I promise you, old
girl&mdash;don't fret. Well, that slice of our life's over and done
with," he added, and laid his hand on hers. "But we'll hold
together, won't we, wife, whatever happens?"</p>

<p>They had passed Black Hill and its multicoloured clay and gravel
heaps, and the train was puffing uphill. The last scattered huts
and weatherboards fell behind, the worked-out holes grew fewer,
wooded rises appeared. Gradually, too, the white roads round Mount
Buninyong came into view, and the trees became denser. And having
climbed the shoulder, they began to fly smoothly and rapidly down
the other side.</p>

<p>Mahony bent forward in his seat. "There goes the last of old
Warrenheip. Thank the Lord, I shall never set eyes on it again.
Upon my word, I believe I came to think that hill the most tiresome
feature of the place. Whatever street one turned into, up it bobbed
at the foot. Like a peep-show...or a bad dream...or a prison
wall."</p>

<p>In Melbourne they were the guests of John&mdash;Mahony had
reluctantly resigned himself to being beholden to Mary's relatives
and Mary's friends to the end of the chapter. At best, living in
other people's houses was for him more of a punishment than a
pleasure; but for sheer discomfort this stay capped the climax.
Under Zara's incompetent rule John's home had degenerated into a
lawless and slovenly abode: the meals were unpalatable, the
servants pert and lazy, while the children ran wild&mdash;you could
hardly hear yourself speak for the racket. Whenever possible,
Mahony fled the house. He lunched in town, looked up his handful of
acquaintances, bought necessaries&mdash;and unnecessaries&mdash;for
the voyage. He also hired a boat and had himself rowed out to the
ship, where he clambered on board amid the mess of scouring and
painting, and made himself known to the chief mate. Or he sat on
the pier and gazed at the vessel lying straining at her anchor,
while quick rain-squalls swept up and blotted out the Bay.</p>

<p>Of Mary he caught but passing glimpses; her family seemed
determined to make unblushing use of her as long as she was within
reach. A couple of days prior to their arrival, John and Zara had
quarrelled violently; and for the dozenth time Zara had packed her
trunks and departed for one of those miraculous situations, the
doors of which always stood open to her.</p>

<p>John was for Mary going after her and forcing her to admit the
error of her ways. Mary held it wiser to let well alone.</p>

<p>"<i>Do</i> be guided by me this time, John," she urged, when she
had heard her brother out: "You and Zara will never hit it off,
however often you try."</p>

<p>But the belief was ingrained in John that the most suitable head
for his establishment was one of his own blood. He answered
indignantly. "And why not pray, may I ask? Who <i>is</i> to hit it
off, as you put it, if not two of a family?"</p>

<p>"Oh, John..."&mdash;Mary felt quite apologetic for her brother.
"Clever as Zara is, she's not at all fitted for a post of this
kind. She's no hand with the servants, and children don't seem to
take to her&mdash;young children, I mean."</p>

<p>"Not fitted? Bah!" said John. "Every woman is fitted by nature
to rear children and manage a house."</p>

<p>"They should be, I know," yielded Mary in conciliatory fashion.
"But with Zara it doesn't seem to be the case."</p>

<p>"Then she ought to be ashamed of herself, my dear
Mary&mdash;ashamed of herself&mdash;and that's all about it!"</p>

<p>Zara wept into a dainty handkerchief and was delivered of a
rigmarole of complaints against her brother, the servants, the
children. According to her, the last were naturally perverse, and
John indulged them so shockingly that she had been powerless to
carry out reforms. Did she punish them, he cancelled the
punishments; if she left their naughtiness unchecked, he accused
her of indifference. Then her housekeeping had not suited him: he
reproached her with extravagance, with mismanagement, even with
lining her own purse. "While the truth is, John is mean as dirt! I
had literally to drag each penny out of him."</p>

<p>"But what ever induced you to undertake it again, Zara?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what indeed!" echoed Zara bitterly. "However, once bitten,
Mary, twice shy. <i>never</i> again!"</p>

<p>But remembering the bites Zara had already received, Mary was
silent.</p>

<p>Even Zara's amateurish hand thus finally withdrawn, it became
Mary's task to find some worthy and capable person to act as
mistress. Taking her obligations seriously, she devoted her last
days in Australia to conning and penning advertisements, and
interviewing applicants.</p>

<p>"Now no one too attractive, if you please, Mrs. Mahony!&mdash;if
you don't want him to fall a victim," teased Richard. "Remember our
good John's inflammability. He's a very Leyden jar again at
present."</p>

<p>"No, indeed I don't," said Mary with emphasis. "But the children
are the first consideration. Oh, dear! it does seem a shame that
Tilly shouldn't have them to look after. And it would relieve John
of so much responsibility. As it is, he's even asked me to make it
plain to Tilly that he wishes Trotty to spend her holidays at
school."</p>

<p>The forsaking of the poor little motherless flock cut Mary to
the heart. Trotty had dung to her, inconsolable. "Oh, Auntie,
<i>take</i> me with you! Oh, what shall I do without you?"</p>

<p>"It's not possible, darling. Your papa would never agree. But I
tell you what, Trotty: you must be a good girl and make haste and
learn all you can. For soon, I'm sure, he'll want you to come and
be his little housekeeper, and look after the other children."</p>

<p>Sounded on this subject, however, John said dryly: "Emma's
influence would be undesirable for the little ones." His prejudice
in favour of his second wife's children was an eternal riddle to
his sister. He dandled even the youngest, whom he had not seen
since its birth, with visible pleasure.</p>

<p>"It must be the black eyes," said Mary to herself; and shook her
head at men's irrationality. For Jinny's offspring had none of the
grace and beauty that marked the two elder children.</p>

<p>And now the last night had come; and they were gathered, a
family party, round John's mahogany. The cloth had been removed;
nuts and port were passing. As it was a unique occasion the ladies
had been excused from withdrawing, and the gentlemen left their
cigars unlighted. Mary's eyes roved fondly from one face to
another. There was Tilly, come over from her hotel&mdash;("Nothing
would induce me to spend a night under his roof, Mary")&mdash;Tilly
sat hugging one of the children, who had run in for the almonds and
raisins of dessert. "What a mother lost in her!" sighed Mary once
more. There was Zara, so far reconciled to her brother as to
consent to be present; but only speaking at him, not to him. And
dear Jerry, eager and alert, taking so intelligent a share in what
was said. Poor Ned alone was wanting, neither Richard nor John
having offered to pay his fare to town. Young Johnny's seat was
vacant, too, for the boy had vanished directly dinner was over.</p>

<p>In the harmony of the evening there was just one jarring note
for Mary; and at moments she grew very thoughtful. For the first
time Mrs. Kelly, the motherly widow on whom her choice had fallen,
sat opposite John at the head of the table; and already Mary was
the prey of a nagging doubt. For this person had doffed the neat
mourning-garb she had worn when being engaged, and come forth in a
cap trimmed with cherry coloured ribbons. Not only this, she smiled
in sugary fashion and far too readily; while the extreme humility
with which she deferred to John's opinion, and hung on his lips,
made another bad impression on Mary. Nor was she alone in her
observations. After a particularly glaring example of the widow's
complaisance, Tilly looked across and shut one eye, in an
unmistakable wink.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men's talk had gradually petered out: there came
long pauses in which they twiddled and twirled their wine-glasses,
unable to think of anything to say. At heart, both John and Mahony
hailed with a certain relief the coming break. "After all I dare
say such a queer faddy fellow <i>is</i> out of his element here.
He'll go down better over there," was John's mental verdict.
Mahony's, a characteristic: "Thank God, I shall not have to put up
much longer with his confounded self-importance, or suffer under
his matrimonial muddles!"</p>

<p>When at a question from Mary John began animatedly to discuss
the tuition of the younger children, Mahony seized the chance to
slip away. He would not be missed. He never was&mdash;here or
anywhere.</p>

<p>On the verandah a dark form stirred and made a hasty movement.
It was the boy Johnny&mdash;now grown tall as Mahony
himself&mdash;and, to judge from the smell, what he tried to
smuggle into his pocket was a briar.</p>

<p>"Oh well, yes, I'm smoking," he said sullenly, after a feeble
attempt at evasion. "Go in and blab on me, if you feel you must,
Uncle Richard."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. But telling fibs about a thing does no good."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it does; it saves a hiding," retorted the boy. And
added with a youthful vehemence: "I'm hanged if I let the governor
take a stick to me nowadays! I'm turned sixteen; and if he dares to
touch me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, come. You know, you've been something of a disappointment
to your father, Johnny&mdash;that's the root of the trouble."</p>

<p>"Glad if I have! He hates me anyway. He never cared for my
mother's children," answered Johnny with a quaint dignity. "I think
he couldn't have cared for her either."</p>

<p>"There you're wrong. He was devoted to her. Her death nearly
broke his heart.&mdash;She was one of the most beautiful women I
have ever seen, my boy."</p>

<p>"Was she?" said Johnny civilly, but with meagre interest. This
long dead mother had bequeathed him not even a memory of
herself&mdash;was as unreal to him as a dream at second hand. From
the chilly contemplation of her he turned back impatiently to his
own affairs, which were burning, insistent. And scenting a vague
sympathy in this stranger uncle who, like himself, had drifted out
from the intimacy of the candle-lit room, he made a clean breast of
his troubles.</p>

<p>"I can't stand the life here, Uncle Richard, and I'm not going
to&mdash;not if father cuts me off with a shilling! I mean to see
the world. <i>this</i> isn't the world&mdash;this dead-and-alive
old country!...though it's got to seem like it to the governor,
he's been here so long. And <i>he</i> cleared out from his before
he was even as old as I am. Of course there isn't another blessed
old Australia for me to decamp to; he might be a bit sweeter about
it, if there was. But America's good enough for me, and I'm off
there&mdash;yes, even if I have to work my passage out!"</p>

<p>Early next morning, fully equipped for their journey, the
Mahonys stood on the William's Town pier, the centre of the usual
crowd of relatives and friends. This had been further swelled by
the advent of Mrs. Devine, who came panting up followed by her
husband, and by Agnes Ocock and Amelia Grindle, who had contrived
to reach Melbourne the previous evening. Even John's children were
tacked on, clad in their Sunday best. Everybody talked at once and
laughed or wept; while the children played hide-and-seek round the
ladies' crinolines. Strange eyes were bent on their party, strange
ears cocked in their direction; and yet once again Mahony's dislike
to a commotion in public choked off his gratitude towards these
good and kindly people. But his star was rising: tears and
farewells and vows of constancy had to be cut short, a jaunt
planned by the whole company to the ship itself abandoned; for a
favourable wind had sprung up and the captain was impatient to
weigh anchor. And so the very last kisses and handclasps exchanged,
the travellers climbed down into a boat already deep in the water
with other cuddy-passengers and their luggage, and were rowed out
to where lay that good clipper-ship, the <i>Red Jacket</i>. Sitting
side by side husband and wife watched, with feelings that had
little in common, the receding quay, Mary fluttering her damp
handkerchief till the separate figures had merged in one dark mass,
and even Tilly, planted in front, her handkerchief tied flagwise to
the top of Jerry's cane, could no longer be distinguished from the
rest.</p>

<p>Mahony's foot met the ribbed teak of the deck with the liveliest
satisfaction; his nostrils drank in the smell of tarred ropes and
oiled brass. Having escorted Mary below, seen to the stowing away
of their belongings and changed his town clothes for a set of
comfortable baggy garments, he returned to the deck, where he
passed the greater part of the day tirelessly pacing. They made
good headway, and soon the ports and towns at the water's edge were
become mere whitey smudges. The hills in the background lasted
longer. But first the Macedon group faded from sight; then the
Dandenong Ranges, grown bluer and bluer, were also lost in the sky.
The vessel crept round the outside of the great Bay, to clear
shoals and sandbanks, and, by afternoon, with the sails close
rigged in the freshening wind, they were running parallel with the
Cliff &mdash;"<i>The</i> Cliff!" thought Mahony with a curl of the
lip. And indeed there was no other; nothing but low scrub-grown
sandhills which flattened out till they were almost level with the
sea.</p>

<p>The passage through the Heads was at hand. Impulsively he went
down to fetch Mary. Threading his way through the saloon, in the
middle of which grew up one of the masts, he opened a door leading
off it.</p>

<p>"Come on deck, my dear, and take your last look at the old
place. It's not likely you'll ever see it again."</p>

<p>But Mary was already encoffined in her narrow berth.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me even to lift my head from the pillow, Richard.
Besides, I've seen it so often before."</p>

<p>He lingered to make some arrangements for her comfort, fidgeted
to know where she had put his books; then mounted a locker and
craned his neck at the porthole. "Now for the Rip, wife! By God,
Mary, I little thought this time last year, that I should be
crossing it to-day."</p>

<p>But the cabin was too dark and small to hold him. Climbing the
steep companion-way he went on deck again, and resumed his
flittings to and fro. He was no more able to be still than was the
good ship under him; he felt himself one with her, and gloried in
her growing unrest. She was now come to the narrow channel between
two converging headlands, where the waters of Hobson's Bay met
those of the open sea. They boiled and churned, in an eternal
commotion, over treacherous reefs which thrust far out below the
surface and were betrayed by straight, white lines of foam. Once
safely out, the vessel hove to to drop the pilot. Leaning over the
gunwale Mahony watched a boat come alongside, the man of oilskins
climb down the rope-ladder and row away.</p>

<p>Here, in the open, a heavy swell was running, but he kept his
foot on the swaying boards long after the last of his
fellow-passengers had vanished&mdash;a tall, thin figure, with an
eager, pointed face, and hair just greying at the temples. Contrary
to habit, he had a word for every one who passed, from mate to
cabin-boy, and he drank a glass of wine with the Captain in his
cabin. Their start had been auspicious, said the latter; seldom had
he had such a fair wind to come out with.</p>

<p>Then the sun fell into the sea and it was night&mdash;a fine,
starry night, clear with the hard, cold radiance of the south.
Mahony looked up at the familiar constellations and thought of
those others, long missed, that he was soon to see
again.&mdash;Over! This page of his history was turned and done
with; and he had every reason to feel thankful. For many and many a
man, though escaping with his life, had left youth and health and
hope on these difficult shores. He had got off scot-free. Still in
his prime, his faculties green, his zest for living unimpaired, he
was heading for the dear old mother country&mdash;for home. Alone
and unaided he could never have accomplished it. Strength to will
the enterprise, steadfastness in the face of obstacles had been
lent him from above. And as he stood gazing down into the black and
fathomless deep, which sent crafty, licking tongues up the vessel's
side, he freely acknowledged his debt, gave honour where honour was
due.&mdash;FROM THEE COMETH VICTORY, FROM THEE COMETH WISDOM, AND
THINE IS THE GLORY AND I AM THY SERVANT.</p>

<p>The last spark of a coast-light went out. Buffeted by the rising
wind, the good ship began to pitch and roll. Her canvas rattled,
her joints creaked and groaned as, lunging forward, she cut her way
through the troubled seas that break on the reef-bound coasts of
this old, new world.</p>

THE WAY HOME</h1>

<hr>

<h2>PROEM</h2>

<p>When, having braved the bergs and cyclones of the desolate South
Pacific, and rounded the Horn; having lain becalmed in the
Doldrums, bartered Cross for Plough, and snatched a glimpse of the
Western Isles: when the homeward-bound vessel is come level with
Finisterre and begins to skirt the Bay, those aboard her get the
impression of passing at one stroke into home waters. Gone alike
are polar blasts and perfumed or desert-dry breezes; gone
opalescent dawns, orange-green sunsets, and nights when the very
moon shines warm, the black mass of ocean sluggish as pitch. The
region the homing wanderer now enters is quick with associations.
These tumbling crested marbled seas, now slate-grey, now of a cold
ultramarine, seem but the offings of those that wash his native
shores; and they are peopled for him by the saltwater ghosts of his
ancestors, the great navigators, who traced this road through the
high seas on their voyages of adventure and discovery. The fair
winds that belly the sails, or the head winds that thwart the
vessel's progress, are the romping south-west gales adrip with
moisture, or the bleak north-easters which scour his island home
and make it one of the windy corners of the world. Not a breath of
balmy softness remains. There is a rawness in the air, a keener,
saltier tang; the sad-coloured sky broods low, or is swept by scud
that flies before the wind; trailing mists blot out the horizon.
And these and other indelible memories beginning to pull at his
heartstrings, it is over with his long patience. After tranquilly
enduring the passage of some fifteen thousand watery miles, he now
falls to chafing, and to telling off the days that still divide him
from port and home.</p>

<p>On an autumn morning in the late 'sixties that smart clipper the
<i>Red Jacket</i>, of some seven hundred tons burden, entered the
English Channel, and having rolled about for a while, for want of a
breeze to steady her, picked up a fine free following wind and
forged ahead at a speed of eight and a half knots an hour.</p>

<p>At the eagerly awaited cry of "Land ho!" from the foretop, an
excited bunch of cuddy-passengers and their ladies, all markedly
colonial in dress and bearing, swarmed to the side of the vessel,
and set to raking and probing the distance. Telescopes and
spy-glasses travelled from hand to hand, arms were silhouetted,
exclamations flew, the female gaze, adrift in space, was gallantly
piloted to the sober level of the horizon. And even the most
sceptical convinced that the dusky shadow on the water's rim was,
in truth, the goal of their journeying, three cheers were called
for and given, the gentlemen swung their hats with an "England for
ever!" the ladies blew kisses and fluttered their kerchiefs. But,
their feelings eased, they soon had their fill of staring at what
might equally well have been a cloud or a trail of smoke; and
having settled the wagers laid on this moment, and betted anew on
the day and hour of casting anchor, they accepted the invitation of
a colonial Croesus, and went below to drink a glass to the Old
Country.</p>

<p>Richard Mahony alone remained, though warmly bidden.</p>

<p>"The pleasure of your company, Mr. Mahony, sir!"</p>

<p>"Mayn't we hope, doctor, for a few words befitting the
occasion?"</p>

<p>He had on the whole been a fairly popular member of the ship's
party. This was thanks to the do-nothing life. Here, on board ship,
he had actually known what it was to feel time hang heavy on his
hands. In consequence, he had come out of his shell, turned
sociable and hearty, taking an interest in his fellow-travellers, a
lead in the diversions of the voyage. And the golden weeks of
sunshine and sea air having made a new man of him&mdash;in looks he
resembled a younger brother of the lean and haggard individual who
had climbed the ship's ladder&mdash;he was able for once harmlessly
to enjoy the passing hour. Again, a genuine sea-lover, he had found
not one of the ninety odd days spent afloat unbearable; and in
refusing to be daunted&mdash;either by the poor, rough food, or the
close quarters; or during a hurricane, when the very cabins were
awash; or again in the tropics, when the ship lay motionless on a
glassy sea, the cruel sun straight overhead&mdash;by making light
of inconvenience and discomfort, he had helped others, too, to put
a brave face on them. Nobody guessed how easy it came to him. His
cheerfulness was counted to him for a virtue, and set him high in
general favour; people fell into the way of running to him not only
with their ailments but their troubles; looked to him to smooth out
the frictions that were the crop of this overlong voyage. So
unusual a state of things could not last. And, indeed, with the
vessel's first knot in northern waters, he had become sensitively
aware of a cooling-off. Let but a foot meet the shore, and the
whole ill-mixed company would scatter to the winds, never to
reassemble. Well, he, for one, would not feel that his ties with
the colony were broken beyond repair until this had happened, and
he had seen the last of all these boisterous, kindly, vulgar
people.</p>

<p>The liking was chiefly on their part. For though, since setting
sail, he had been rid of the big-mouthed colonial boaster, and
among runaways like himself, men who were almost as glad as he to
turn their backs on Australia&mdash;but a single one of the thirty
cabin-passengers contemplated returning&mdash;this was far from
saying that he had found in them congenial spirits. They chafed him
in ways they did not dream of. The Midases of the party&mdash;it
was ruled sharply off into those who had amassed a fortune and
those who patently had not; none went "home" but for one or other
reason; he himself was the only half tint on the
palette&mdash;these lucky specimens were for ever trumpeting the
opinion that the colonies were a good enough place in which to fill
your money-bags; but to empty them, you repaired to more civilised
climes. And to hear his case&mdash;or at least what had once been
his intention&mdash;put thus crudely made Mahony wince. The
speakers reminded him of underbred guests, who start belittling
their entertainment before they are fairly over their host's
door-sill. At the same time he had to laugh in his sleeve. For
where, pray, could Monsieur le Boucher and Monsieur l'Epicier undo
their purse-strings to better effect, find a society more exactly
cut to their shape, than in the Antipodes, where no display was too
showy, no banquet too sumptuous, no finery too loud; and where the
man who could slap a well-filled pocket was anyone's
equal?&mdash;Even less to his taste was the group of lean kine.
With nothing to show for themselves but broken health and shattered
illusions, these men saw the land of their exile through the smoked
glasses of hate, and had not a single good word to say for it.
Which of course was nonsense.</p>

<p>And so it came about that Mary was sometimes agreeably surprised
to hear Richard, if not exactly standing up for the colony, at
least not helping to swell the choir of its detractors. This was
unending, went round and round like a catch. People outdid one
another in discovering fresh grounds for their aversion. Besides
the common grievances&mdash;the droughts and floods, the dust winds
and hot winds, the bare, ugly landscape, the seven plagues of
winged and creeping things&mdash;many a small private grudge was
owned to, and by the most unlikely lips. Here was a burly tanner
who had missed the glimmer of twilight, been vexed at the sudden
onrush of the dark. Another grumbler bemoaned the fact that, just
when you looked for snow and holly-berries: "Hanged if there ain't
the pitches and appricoats ripe and ready to tumble into your
mouth!"</p>

<p>"An onnatcheral country, and that's the truth."</p>

<p>"The wrong side of the world, say I&mdash;the under side."</p>

<p>Quaint home-sicknesses cropped up, too. On board was a skinny
little colonist from the Moreton Bay district, with, as the Irish
wit of the company had it, "the face of his own granddad upon his
shoulders"&mdash;who was, that is to say, more deeply wrinkled than
the bewrinkled rest. Where this man came from, dirt was not: the
little weatherboard houses were as clean when they dropped to
pieces as when first run up. He it was who now confessed to an odd
itch to see again the grime and squalor of London town: the shiny
black mud that served as mortar to the paving-stones; the beds of
slush into which, on a rainy day, the crossing-sweepers
voluptuously plunged their brooms; the smoke-stained buildings;
monuments tarred with the dirt of ages. He wanted to feel his cheek
stung by the mixture of flying fodder and dry ordure that whirls
the streets, does the east wind go; to sniff the heavy smell of
soot and frost that greets the Londoner's nose on a winter
morning&mdash;even to choke and smother in a London fog.</p>

<p>No one smiled.</p>

<p>"Aye, it's what one's born to that tells; what one comes back to
in the end," nodded a pursy builder, whose gold watch-chain, hung
with seals and coins, was draped across his waistcoat like a line
of gala bunting. "I knew a man, gents&mdash;it's a fact I'm tellin'
you!&mdash;who could 'a bought out the up-country township he lived
in twice and three times over; and yet I'm blessed if this old
Johnny-bono didn't as good as turn on the waterworks when he spoke
o' the pokey old cottage down Devon way, where he'd been young.
Seemed as if all the good smells o' the rest o' the world couldn't
make up to him for a bit o' peat burnin' on a still winter's
evenin'; or new thatch smellin' in the rains or the softish stink
o' the milch-cows' dung in long wet meadow grass."</p>

<p>That white raven, "the man who was going back," held aloof from
the sentimentalists. Was he however present at such a sitting, he
kept silence, an ambiguous expression on his face. Once only, in a
conversation engineered by Mahony out of curiosity, did he speak
up. And then it was with a disagreeable overbearing. "I left
England, sir, six years since, because man isn't a sprite to live
on air alone. My father went half-starved all his days&mdash;he was
a farmhand, and reared a family o' nine on eleven bob a week. He
didn't taste meat from one year's end to another. Out yon
"&mdash;and he pointed with his cutty-pipe over his
shoulder&mdash;" I've ate meat three times a day. I've a snug
little crib of me own and a few acres o' land, and I've come home
to fetch out me old mother and the young fry. They shall know what
it is to eat their fill every day of the seven, and she'll drive to
chapel of a Sabbath in her own trap and a black silk
gown.&mdash;Nay, be sure I haven't loafed around, nor sat with me
hands before me. There's not much anyone can learn me in the way of
work. But the old country wouldn't either gimme anything to do, nor
yet keep me free, gratis and for nothing."&mdash;And so on, in a
strain dear to the tongues of the lower orders.</p>

<p>These things flitted through Mahony's mind as he stood, chin in
hand, elbow on gunwale, gazing over the last stretch of dividing
sea. Before him lay an aquarelle of softest colouring, all pale
light and misty shadow; and these lyric tints, these shades and
half shades, gripped his heart as the vivid hues of the south never
had. Their very fleetingness charmed. But a little ago and the day
had been blue and sunny, with just a spice of crispness in the air
to remind one that it was autumn. A couple of white bales of cloud,
motionless overhead, had flung gigantic purple shadows, which lay
like painted maps of continents on the glittering sea. But, the
breeze freshening, the clouds had been set in motion; and
simultaneously the shadow-continents, losing their form, had begun
to travel the surface of the water. A rain-shower was coming up
from the west: it drew a curtain over the sky, and robbed the sea
of its colour. Only in the east did a band of light persist, above
which the fringes of the storm cloud hung, sending down straight
black rays. And now the squall was upon them; wind and rain hunted
each other over the waves; the deck slanted, masts and spars
whistled, sails smacked and shrilled.</p>

<p>In the course of that day the vessel was taken in tow, and when,
towards evening, the downpour ceased and Mahony again climbed the
companion-way, a very different scene met his eye. They now drove
through a leaden sea, which the rain had beaten flat, reduced to a
kind of surly quiescence. Above them was an iron-grey sky, evenly
spread and of a fair height, the lower clouds having withdrawn to
the horizon where, in a long, cylinder-like roll, they hung poised
on the water's rim. But this cold and stony aspect of things was
more than made up for. Flush with the ship, looking as though it
had just risen from the waves, was land&mdash;was the English
shore.</p>

<p>At sight of it Mahony had a shock of surprise&mdash;that
thrilled surprise that England holds for those of her sons who
journey back, no matter whence, across the bleak and windy desert
of the seas. Quite so lovely as this, one had not dared to remember
the homeland. There it lay, stretched like an emerald belt against
its drab background, and was as grateful to sun-tired eyes as a
draught of mountain water to a climber's parched throat. Not a rood
of this earth looked barren or unkempt: veritable lawns ran down to
the brink of the cliffs; hedges ruled bosky lines about the
meadows; the villages were bowers of trees &mdash;English trees.
Even the rain had favoured him: his first glimpse of all this
beauty was caught at its freshest, grass and foliage having emerged
from the clouds as if new painted in greenness.</p>

<p>Another aspect of it struck Mary who mounted in his wake,
gloved, shawled and hatted against the evening chills. With an
exclamation of pleasure she cried: "Oh, Richard&mdash;how pretty!
How...how tidy! It looks like...like"&mdash;she hesitated,
searching her memory for the trimmest spot she knew; and
ended&mdash;"doesn't it?...just like the Melbourne Botanic
Gardens."</p>

<p>"It looks too good to be true, my dear."</p>

<p>But he understood what she was trying to say. If the landscape
before them was lovely as a garden, it had also something of a
garden's limitations. There was an air of arrangedness about it; it
might have been laid out according to plan, and on pleasing, but
rather finikin lines; it was all exquisite, but just a trifle
overdressed. And as he followed up the train of thought started by
Mary's words, he was swept through by a sudden consciousness of
England's littleness, her tiny, tight compactness, the narrow
compass that allowed of so intensive a cultivation. These fair
fields in miniature!&mdash;after the wide acreage of the colonial
paddock. These massy hedgerows cutting up the good pasture-land
into chequerboard squares!&mdash;after the thready rail-and-post
fences that offered no hindrance to the eye. These diminutive
clusters of houses huddled wall to wall&mdash;compared with the
sprawling townships set, regardless of ground-space, at the four
corners of immense cross-roads. These narrow, winding lanes and
highways that crawled their mile or so from one village to the near
next&mdash;after the broad, red, rectilinear Australian roads, that
dashed ahead, it might be for the length of a day's journey,
without encountering human habitation. These duly preserved morsels
of woodland, as often as not guarded, they too, by a leafy wall
where songsters trilled-compared with the immense and terrible
bush, bare alike of bird and man: all these forcible contrasts
worked in him as he stood gazing on the fair natural garden of
southern England; and a sensation that was half wonder, half a kind
of protective tenderness, called at the same time a smile to his
lips and tears to his eyes. In face of this adorable littleness,
this miniature perfection, his feelings were those of the nomad son
who, weary of beating up and down the world, turns home at last to
rest on the untravelled heart of his mother. Here the familiar
atmosphere of his childhood laps him round; and he breathes it
greedily &mdash;even while he marvels how time has stood still for
the home-keepers, and asks himself if he can ever again be one of
them. All the tempestuous years of his youth lie between. He has
fought fire-spueing dragons, suffered shipwreck in Sargasso, bent
the knee at strange shrines. And the sense of an older, tireder
wisdom, which makes of him the ancient, of them the young and
untried, completes the breach. How, knowing what he knows, can he
placidly live through the home day, with its small, safe monotony?
How give up for ever the excitement of great risks taken and met,
on grander shores, under loftier skies?</p>

<p>But a truce to such vapourings! Did the man exist that had it in
him to fret and go unhappy, feel pinioned, and a prisoner while,
round the cliffs of England, now grey, now white, now red, danced
and beckoned the English sea? For who, native to these coasts,
would renounce, once having drawn on it, that heritage of vagrancy
which has come down to him through the ages? Amphibian among the
peoples, has he not learnt to adjust his balance to the sea's
tumblings, his sight to its vast spaces?&mdash;so that into the
English eye has, with time, come a look of remoteness: the
sailor-look, which, from much scouring of horizons, seems to focus
on near objects only with an effort.&mdash;And musing thus, Mahony
believed he knew why, for all its smallness, on this little speck
of an island rising green and crumbly from the waves, there should
have bred a mighty race. It was not in spite of its size, but
because of it. Just because the span of the land was so narrow,
those whose blood ran high could shove off on the unruly element
from their very doorsteps, and whether these looked north or south,
faced sunrise or sunset: the deep-sea fishers, the great
traffickers, the navigators and explorers, the fighting men of the
deep. And with them, so it pleased him to think, no matter for what
point they headed, they bore tidings of the mother-country, and of
her struggles towards a finer liberty, a nicer justice, that should
make of her sons true freemen; for her a difficult task because she
lay isolate, shut off by barriers of foam, a prey to hoary
traditions, and with no land-frontier across which seditious
influences might slip; and yet for her most needful, seeing that
the hearts of her people were restless, indomitable&mdash;had in
them something of the unruliness of her seas. And just as these
rovers carried out news of England, so, homing again, either for a
breathing-space in the great tourney, or, old and feeble, to lay
their bones in English earth, they brought back their quota of
things seen, heard, felt on their Odyssey; a fruity crop of
experience; so that even the chimney-dwellers in England came by a
certain bigness of vision: through the eyes of son or brother they
explored outlandish parts, were present at exotic happenings. And
now, his thoughts turning inward, he asked himself whether even he,
Richard Mahony, in his small way, was not carrying on the great
tradition. Having fared forth in his youth, endured in exile, then
heard and obeyed the home-call, did not he, too, return the richer
for a goodly store of spiritual experience&mdash;<i>his</i>
treasure-trove of life-wisdom&mdash;which might serve to guide
others on their road, or go before them as a warning? And the idea
grew, under his pondering. He saw his race as the guardian of a
vast reserve fund of spiritual force, to which all alike
contributed&mdash;; as each was free at will or at need to draw on
it&mdash;a hoard, not of the things themselves, but of their
ghostly sublimates: the quintessence of all achievement, all
endeavour; of failure, suffering, joy and pain. And, if this image
held, it would throw light on the obscure purpose of such a
seemingly aimless life as his had been; a life ragged with broken
ends. Only in this way, he must believe, had it been possible to
distil the precious drop of oil that was <i>his</i> ultimate
essence. Not ours to judge of the means, or in what our puny
service should consist: why to one should fall the bugles and the
glory&mdash;the dying in splendour for a great cause, or the living
illustriously to noble issues&mdash;to another, a life that was one
long blind stumble, with, for finish, an inglorious end. Faith bid
us believe that, in the sight of the great Foreordainer, all
service was equal. But this we could not know. The veil&mdash;a web
of steel despite its tenuity&mdash;was lowered, and would not rise
on the mystery until that day dawned towards which all our days had
headed, for which no man had ever waited in vain. And then, pinched
of nostril and marble-cold, earth's last little posy in our
gripless hands, we should lie supine and&mdash;such was the irony
of things&mdash;no longer greatly care to know.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-1" id="ch-2-1-1"></a>Chapter I</h3>

<p>The ancient little town of Buddlecombe, originally pressed down
the mouth of a narrow valley to the sea, from which it is protected
by rampart and breakwater, has, in the course of the centuries,
scaled the nearer of the two hills that confine it. Nowadays its
streets go everywhere up and down. A precipitous lane is climbed by
the ridge-like steps of an Italian donkey-path; the old town
gardens, massively walled, are built in tiers, so that the
apple-trees on the higher levels scatter their blossoms on the
gardens beneath. Coming from the upland, three driving-roads drop
into the town at a bold gradient; and vehicles, whether they mount
or descend, creep like snails. Halfway down the sheerest of the
three, the quaint little old houses, that set in oddly enough just
where the road is steepest, appear to cling shoulder to shoulder,
each a storey or a half-storey lower than the last, their lines all
out of drawing with age and the insecurity of their foothold; while
those at the bottom of the hill, seen from this point but as a
dimpling cluster of gables, dormers, chimneys, look, till you are
virtually upon them, as if they were standing in the sea. The roofs
of one and all are silvered with the mortar of innumerable repairs,
some of their ancient tiles flying off afresh in every rowdy
equinox.</p>

<p>The sea-front is crescent-shaped; and a high, wooded cliff,
which leaves room for no more than a footpath between it and the
surf-rolled shingle, cuts the town in two. The smaller half,
grouped about the harbour, includes the old custom-house, a couple
of ramshackle magazines and their yards, an ancient inn or two, all
bustling places once on a time, when elephants' teeth and gold dust
were unshipped here, and the stuffs and linens of England arrived
on pack-horses for transit to France; when, too, much lucrative
wine and spirit-running went on with the French coast. Now, there
is little doing, either here or in the tiny antiquated storehouses
and weighing-sheds out on the famous old stone quay that crooks
round the harbour. In these sheds children play or visitors shelter
while peeping forth at the great waves which, in stormy weather,
toss up over the breakwater; and the storehouses are closed and
deserted. A claim to notice, though, they still have. More than one
of them is tinted a delicate pink; and the rays of the setting
summer sun, catching this, reflect it like a rose in the harbour;
which sometimes, half full, lies a pool of melted turquoise;
sometimes, during the spring-tides, when the moored boats ride
level with the quay, has no more colour in it than an empty glass,
or a pure sky before dawn.</p>

<p>To get the best view of the town you must row out beyond harbour
and mole, or, better still, swim out, on one of those dead-calm
days that every summer brings&mdash;days when the yellow cliffs
across the bay send down perfect golden shadows in the blue mirror
of the sea. Then, lying pillowed on this saltest, most buoyant
water, glance back to where, grouped in that perfect symmetry that
seems the lost secret of old town-builders, the little place on its
gun-cliffs lies curved to the bay. Viewed thus, it looks like a
handful of grey shells clustered on a silver shingle&mdash;pearl,
not stone grey&mdash;for there is no dourness about Buddlecombe:
light and graceful of aspect, it might have suffered bodily
transport at the hands of some giant Ifrit, from the French coast
over the way. Its silveriness is dashed only by the creeper on the
square church-tower&mdash;perched, this, too, on the very cliff
edge&mdash;a creeper which betimes in summer the salt air dyes a
blood-red; and by an old jet-black house, tarred and pitched
against the breakers which, in a south-west gale, beat to its
topmost windows, and hurl roots and branches of seaweed up the
slope of the main street.</p>

<p>Above the town the green hillsides are dotted with goodly
residences, in which officers on half-pay, and Anglo-Indians in
search of clemency, lie snug for the rest of their dormouse days.
The houses are as secluded as a foliage of almost tropical
luxuriance or walls well over man's height, with great hedges atop
of these, can make them; and the loveliness of their jealously
hidden gardens is only to be guessed at from peeps through a door
left ajar by a careless errand-boy; from the bold application of an
eye to a keyhole; or, in midsummer, from the purple masses of
buddleia and the wealth of climbing-roses&mdash;pink and crimson,
yellow and white&mdash;that toss over the walls in a confusion of
beauty.</p>

<p>In this pleasant spot Richard Mahony had made his home. Here,
too, he had found the house of his dreams. It was built of
stone&mdash;under a tangle of creeper&mdash;was very old, very
solid: floors did not shake to your tread, and, shut within the
four walls of a room, voices lost their carrying power. But its
privacy was what he valued most. To the steep road on which it
abutted the house turned a blank face&mdash;or blank but for
entrance-door and one small window&mdash;while, in a line with it,
up-hill and down, to conceal respectively flower and
kitchen-gardens, ran two arms of massy wall. In addition to this,
the front door was screened by a kind of sentry-box porch, open
only on one side. In this porch was set a tiny glass oval; and here
one could stand, secure from rough weather or the curiosity of an
occasional passer-by, and watch for mounting postman or expected
guest; just as no doubt fifty odd years before, through this very
peep-hole, anxious eyes had strained for news-carrier or outrider
bringing tidings of sailor son or soldier husband, absent on
foreign service in the Great War.</p>

<p>On stepping over the threshold you found yourself at once on the
upper floor; for so abruptly did the ground on the farther side
fall away that the house was one storey to the road, two to the
garden. The living-rooms were on the higher level, with a fine view
over town and bay&mdash;all but one, a snug little oak-panelled
parlour on the ground floor; and here it was that, one autumn
morning between eight and nine o'clock, the Mahonys sat at
breakfast. Although the air of the young day was mild in the
extreme, a generous fire burned in the grate and roared up the
chimney, entirely putting to shame, with its scarlet vigour, the
wraith-like patch of sunshine that lay across the table.</p>

<p>Mary, seated behind the urn, looked very thoughtful; and this
was the more marked because, in obedience to the prevailing
fashion, she had swept the heavy bands of her hair off cheeks and
forehead, and now wore it braided high in a crown. The change threw
up the fine, frank lines of her head and brow; and atoned for the
youthful softness it robbed her of, by adding to the dignity and
character of her face.</p>

<p>More than once during the meal she had made as if to speak. But
as certainly as she opened her lips, Richard, who was deep in The
<i>Times</i> of the day before, would either absently hold out his
cup to her; or attack the muffin-dish anew; or, in turning a richly
crackling sheet of the paper, exclaim: "Ha! Here we have it! Mr.
Disraeli threatens to resign. The poor Queen will be forced to send
for that turncoat Gladstone." And Mary did not wish to spoil his
appetite or interrupt his reading.</p>

<p>But when he had pushed cup and saucer from him, wiped his
moustache, and driven back his chair, fleetly to skim the less
important columns, she felt justified in claiming his
attention.</p>

<p>"Richard, dear&mdash;I want to tell you something. What we
suspected is true. The Burroughs <i>have</i> called in Mr.
Robinson. Selina says his gig stood outside their house yesterday
for quite a time."</p>

<p>She paused, waiting for a rejoinder that did not come.</p>

<p>"And that's not the most annoying thing, either. He has been
sent for to 'Toplands' as well."</p>

<p>After this she was no longer in doubt whether he heard her. For
though he went on reading, his face changed in a way she well knew.
To herself she called it "going wrong"&mdash;"his face went wrong"
was how she put it &mdash;and in the year they had been in England,
she had watched what was formerly a casual occurrence turn to
almost a habit. Now Richard had always been a very transparent
person, showing anger, pride, amusement, all too plainly. But this
was something different. It was not so much an expression as a loss
of expression; and it happened when anyone laid a chance finger on
some sensitive spot he had believed securely hidden. Put thus out
of countenance he wore an oddly defenceless, even a hapless air;
and it distressed her to see him give himself away in front of
strangers. Hence, she had a fresh reason for trying to be
beforehand with news of a disagreeable nature. In the old days, she
had wished to hinder him feeling hurt; now it was to hinder him
showing that he was hurt&mdash;which, of the two, she believed he
minded more.</p>

<p>In the present case his sole response was a curt: "Well!...fools
will be fools," as he turned a page of the paper. A moment later,
however, he did what she expected: laid the <i>Times</i> down and
stalked out of the room.</p>

<p>She threw a motherly glance after him, and sighed. Poor old
Richard! She had been bound to tell him, of course; but by doing so
she had furnished him with a worry for the whole day. It was clear
he had set his heart on keeping "Toplands"; and now, after
consulting him on and off for a couple of months, the silly people
seemed to be going back to that red-nosed, ungentlemanly Mr.
Robinson. She couldn't understand it. Still, in Richard's place,
she would have taken it calmly. Ten to one turncoats like these
would soon come running to him again. Time was needed for people
here to find out how clever he was.</p>

<p>Having cleared the breakfast-table, she rang the bell for the
servant to take away the tray. But neither her first ring nor a
second was answered. For at this moment the girl, her skirts
bunched high above a pair of neat prunellas, stood ruefully eyeing
the condition of the lower lawn, wondering how she could make her
master hear without soiling her boots or indecently raising her
voice.</p>

<p>From the dining-room Mahony had stepped out into the garden.
This was saturated with moisture. During the night a sea fog had
crept up and enmuffled the land; and though by now a watery sun was
dissipating the mists&mdash;they lingered only about remote
objects, like torn handfuls of cotton wool&mdash;they had left
everything drenched and sodden. As he crossed the grass of the
upper lawn, the water came in over the tops of his carpet-slippers;
bushes and shrubs against which he brushed delivered showers of
drops; and gossamer-webs, spun by the thousand in lovely geometrics
that hung whitey-grey and thick as twine, either shattered
themselves on his shoulders, or laid themselves fillet-wise round
his brow. At the foot of the garden he traversed a second lawn, in
which his feet sank and stuck, and climbed three wooden steps set
against a side wall. He had hammered these steps together himself,
that he might have a view to seaward. A small cutting, in the end
wall, as well as all the windows of the house, looked to the town
and the row of yellow cliffs beyond. They dated from a time when a
land view of any kind was preferred to that of the bare and open
sea.</p>

<p>Here he now stood and stared at the palely glittering water. But
he did not see it. His mind was busy with the uncomfortable
impression left on it by Mary's last statement. At a stroke this
had laid waste the good spirits in which he had got up that
morning; even if, for the moment, it had done no more than pull him
up short, as one is pulled up by a knot in a needleful of
pack-thread, or a dumb note on a keyboard. For the feeling roused
in him was no such simple one as mere mortification at the rumoured
loss of the big house known as "Toplands"; though the dear soul
indoors put it down to this, and he should continue to let her
think so. No; there was more behind. But only now, when alone with
himself, did he mutter under his breath: "Good Lord! What if this
place should prove to be Leicester over again!"</p>

<p>He got no further; for here was it that Selina's prim voice
broke on his ear. The girl had followed in his steps to say that
Jopson, the liveryman, was at the back door and wished to speak to
him. A patient also waited in the passage.</p>

<p>Jopson, who was a short man of enormous bulk, had been
accommodated with a chair, after his drag uphill. He rose at
Mahony's approach, but continued to ease his weight against the
doorpost.</p>

<p>"Sarry, surr, but I ca'an't let 'ee 'ave the mare to-day. 'Er's
arff 'er feed. Sarry, surr. T'others is every one bespoke. No,
surr, mine's t' only livery in the town. One o' the inns
<i>might</i> let 'ee 'ave a turn-out, of a sart; but I dunno as I'd
advise 'ee to go to they. They's almighty partiklar, surr, 'ow
their 'arses is drove. 'Twouldn't do to bring one o' they whoam
along, winded and h'all of a sweat."</p>

<p>"You surely don't mean to insinuate I've been overdriving the
mare?"</p>

<p>"Well, surr, and since you mention it yourself, Allfred did say
yesterday as 'ow you took 'er h'up ovurr Brandlebury 'Ill faster
than 'er 'dd anny mind to go. The 'ills is steep 'ereabouts, surr,
and cruel 'aard on the 'arses. An' 'tis naat the furst time
neether. If you'll excuse me sayin' so, surr, them 'oove seen it do
tell as 'ow you be rather a flash 'and with the reins."</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word, Jopson, this is something new! I drive for
show?...I overwork a horse? Why, my man, where I come from, it used
to be dinned into me on all sides that I was far too easy with
them."</p>

<p>"Ca'an't say, surr, I'm sure." Jopson was perfectly civil, but
equally non-committal.</p>

<p>"But I can!" gave back Mahony, with warmth. "I had two of my own
there, let me tell you, and no beasts were ever better treated or
cared for. They certainly hadn't to be walked up every slope for
fear they'd lose their wind. They took their honest share of the
day's work. For where I come from..." At the repetition of the
phrase he bit his lip.</p>

<p>"Aye, surr, ahl very well, I dessay, for such a
place&mdash;Australy, as I unnerstand," answered Jopson unmoved.
"But 'twouldn't do 'ere, surr&mdash;in England. Thic's a civilised
country." And so on to a somewhat acid wrangle, in which Mahony,
galled by the doubt cast on his compassion for dumb brutes, was
only restrained by the knowledge that, in this matter of
conveyance, he was wholly in Jopson's power.</p>

<p>"Really, my dear, if it weren't that the fellow kept his hat in
his hand and scattered his 'sirs' broadcast, it might just have
been old Billy de la Poer himself I was talking to. <i>Do</i> you
remember Billy? And how, in his palmy days, one had to wheedle a
mount out of him, if he wasn't in the vein to hire? The very same
uppish independence! I don't know, I'm sure, what this country's
coming to. Though I will say, with all his shortcomings Billy never
had the impudence to tell me I couldn't drive."</p>

<p>The woman who was waiting for him brought a summons to one of
the lonely little farms that dotted the inland hills.</p>

<p>"Three miles out and only shanks' ponies to get me there just my
luck! Imagine, Mary, a place with but a single horse for hire!
To-night I must go thoroughly into the money question again. I
shan't be satisfied now, my dear, till I am independent of Jopson
and his great fat pampered quadruped. Stable with him? Not I! Not
if I have to build on here myself!"</p>

<p>His first visit led him down the main street of Buddlecombe.</p>

<p>It was between nine and ten o'clock, the hour of day at which
the little town was liveliest. Shopkeepers had opened their
shutters, saw-dusted and sprinkled their floors, picked over their
goods, unlocked their tills and tied on clean white aprons. They
might now be seen sunning themselves in their doorways, exchanging
the time of day with their neighbours, or shooing off the dogs
which, loosed from chain and kennel, frolicked, yapped and sprawled
over the pavement. Mounted butcher-boys trotted smartly to and fro.
A fisherman, urging a sluggish horse and laden cart uphill, cried
mackerel at two a penny. And, from big houses and little, women
were emerging, on foot or in donkey and pony-chaises, to do their
marketing, chat with one another, glean the news that had
accumulated overnight. For every one knew everybody else in
Buddlecombe, and was almost more interested in his neighbour's
business than in his own. You could not, vowed Mahony, enter a shop
for a penn'orth of tin-tacks&mdash;the selling of which was
conducted as if you had all eternity to spare for it; what with the
hunting up of a small enough bit of paper, the economical
unravelling of a tangled length of twine&mdash;without learning
that Mr. Jones's brindled cow had calved at last, or that the
carrier had delivered to Mr. Du Cane still another hogshead of
brandy-wine. This, together with many a sly inquiry as to where you
yourself might be bound for, or the trend of your own affairs.
Alongside the rampart stood half a dozen ancient men of the sea,
discussing, with vigour, God knew what. A bottle-nosed constable,
stationed in the middle of the road to superintend a traffic that
did not exist, gossiped with the best.</p>

<p>Down this street Mahony walked, in the surtout, light trousers
and bell-topper which he still preferred to the careless attire of
a country doctor. He was greeted with bows and bobs and touched
forelocks. But the fact of his appearing on foot brought him many a
quizzing glance; and there were also shoppers who came at a trot to
the door to see and stare after him. Or perhaps, he thought with a
grimace, the more than common interest he roused this morning was
due to his ill-treatment of Jopson's mare, the tale of which had no
doubt already been buzzed abroad. He was really only now, after
several months' residence in Buddlecombe, beginning to understand
the seven days' wonder with which he must have provided the
inhabitants by settling in their midst&mdash;he, who bore with him
the exotic aroma of the Antipodes! At the time, being without
experience of little English country places, he had failed to
appreciate it.</p>

<p>His visits in the town paid, he chose to leave it by the
sea-front and climb the steeper hill at the farther end, rather
than retrace his steps and present himself anew to all these
curious and faintly hostile eyes.</p>

<p>Thus began for him a day of fatigue and discomfort. The promise
of the early morning was not fulfilled: the sun failed; down came
the mist again; and the tops of the hills and the high roads that
ran along them were lost in a bank of cloud. He was for ever
opening and shutting his umbrella, as he passed from rain to fog
and fog to rain. Not a breath of air stirred. His greatcoat hung a
ton-weight on his shoulders.</p>

<p>He walked moodily. As a rule on his country rounds, he had the
distraction of the reins: his eye, too, could range delightedly
over the shifting views of lovely pastoral country, fringed by the
belt of blue sea. To-day, even had the weather allowed of it, he
could have seen nothing, on foot between giant hedgerows that
walled in the narrow lanes leading from one cottage and one village
to the next. Plodding along he first tried, without success, to
visualise the pages of his passbook; then fell back on the deeper,
subtler worry that was in him. This, sitting perched hobgoblinlike
on his neck, pricked and nudged his memory, and would not let him
rest. So that, on coming out of a house and starting his tramp
anew, he would murmur to himself: "Where was I?...what was it? Oh,
yes, I know: just suppose this should turn out to be Leicester over
again!"</p>

<p>For the present was not his first bid for a practice in England.
That had been made under very different circumstances.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-2" id="ch-2-1-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>It was at another breakfast-table, something over a year
previously, that Mary, having opened and read it, handed him a
letter bearing the Leicester postmark.&mdash;"From my mother."</p>

<p>This ran:</p>

<p>NOW MY DARLINGS I DON'T WANT TO HURRY YOU AWAY FROM ALL THE
GRANDEURS AND GAIETIES OF THE METROPOLIS, AND HAVE YOU GRUMBLING OH
BOTHERATION TAKE THAT OLD MOTHER OF OURS; BUT I DO LONG TO SEE YOU
BOTH, MY CHILDREN, AND TO GET MY ARMS ROUND YOU. YOUR ROOM IS
READY, THE BED MADE AND AIRED&mdash;LISBY HAS ONLY TO RUN THE
BED-WARMER OVER THE SHEETS FOR THE LAST TIME. MY HOME IS SMALL AS
YOU KNOW, POLLY, BUT YOU SHALL HAVE A ROYAL WELCOME, MY DEARS, AND
I HOPE WILL MAKE IT YOURS TILL YOU HAVE ONE OF YOUR OWN AGAIN.</p>

<p>"A royal welcome indeed, Mary!...one may say our first genuine
welcome to England," declared Mahony; and threw, in thought, a
caustic side-glance at the letters he had received from his own
people since landing: Irish letters, charming in phrase and
sentiment, but&mdash;to his own Irish eyes&mdash;only partially
cloaking the writers' anxiety lest, as a result of his long absence
from the country, he should take Irish words at their face value,
take what was but the warm idea of an invitation for the thing
itself, and descend to quarter himself upon them. "Now what do you
say, love? Shall we pack our traps and be off? Yes, yes, I suppose
I shall have to gulp down another cup of these dregs...that
masquerade as coffee."</p>

<p>"Ssh, Richard!...not so loud." Mary spoke huskily, being in the
grip of a heavy cold and muffled to the chin. "I should like it, of
course. But remember, in engaging these rooms you mentioned a
month&mdash;if not six weeks."</p>

<p>"I did, I know. But...Well, my dear, to speak frankly the sooner
I walk out of them for the last time the better I'll be pleased.
How the deuce that hotel we stopped at had the effrontery to
recommend them staggers me!" And with aversion Mahony let his eye
skim the inseparable accompaniments of a second class London
lodging: the stained and frayed table linen, cracked, odd china,
dingy hangings; the cheap, dusty coal, blind panes, smut-strewn
sills. "Fitzroy Square indeed! By hanging out of the window till I
all but over-reach myself, to catch a glimpse of a single sooty
tree branch. And the price we're asked to pay for the privilege! I
assure you, Mary, though we had fork out rent for the full six
weeks, we should save in the end by going. The three we've been
here have made a sad hole in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Yes. But of course we've done some rather extravagant things,
dear. Cabs everywhere&mdash;because of your silly prejudice against
me using the omnibus. Then that concert...the Nightingale, I forget
her name...and the Italian Opera, and Adelina Patti. I said at the
time you should have left me at home; you could have told me all
about it afterwards. What with gloves and bouquet and head-dress,
it must have cost close on five pounds."</p>

<p>"And pray are we to be here at last, in the very heart of
things, with twenty years' rust&mdash;oh, well! very nearly
twenty&mdash;to rub off, and yet go nowhere and hear nothing? No,
wife, that's not the money I begrudge. All the same, just let me
tell you what our stay in London has run to&mdash;I totted it up at
three A.M. when those accursed milk-wagons began to rattle
by"&mdash;and here he did aloud for Mary's benefit a rapid sum in
mental arithmetic. "What do you say to that?&mdash;No, I know I
haven't," he answered another objection on her part. "But on second
thoughts, I've decided to postpone seeing over hospitals and
medical schools till I'm settled in practice again, and have a
fixed address on my pasteboards. I shall then get a good deal more
deference shown me than I should at present, a mere nobody, sprung
from the dickens knows where."</p>

<p>He had lighted the after-breakfast pipe he could now allow
himself, and pacing the room with his hands in his dressing-gown
pockets went on: "This sense of insignificance regularly haunts me.
I'm paying, I expect, for having lived so long in a place like
Ballarat, where it was easy to imagine oneself a personage of
importance. Here, all such vanity is soon crushed out of one. The
truth of the matter is, London's too big for me; I don't feel equal
to it&mdash;I believe one can lose the habit of great cities, just
like any other. And sometimes, especially since you've been laid
up, Mary&mdash;for which I hold myself mainly responsible, my dear,
running you off your legs as I did at first..."</p>

<p>"Still we can say, Richard, can't we, we've seen all there is to
be seen?" threw in Mary with a kind of cheerful inattention. Risen
meanwhile from the breakfast-table, she had opened the door of the
chiffonier; and her thoughts were now divided between Richard's
words and the fresh depredations in her store of provisions that
had taken place overnight.</p>

<p>Mahony snorted. "A fiftieth part of it would be nearer the
mark!&mdash;Well, as I was saying...if you'll do me the kindness to
listen...this last week or so, since I've been mooning about by
myself&mdash;Gad! to think how I once looked forward to treading
these dingy old streets again&mdash;half silly with the noise of
the traffic...upon my word, wife, that begins to get on my nerves,
too: it goes on like a wave that never breaks; I find myself
eternally waiting for a crash that doesn't come. Well, as I say,
when I push my way through all these hard, pale, dirty London
faces&mdash;yes, my dear, even the best of 'em look as though they
needed a thorough scrub with soap and water...as for me, if I wash
my hands once, I wash 'em twenty times a day; I defy any one to
keep clean in such an atmosphere. All strange faces, too; never one
you recognise in the whole bunch; while out there, of course, the
problem was, to meet a person you did <i>not</i> know. Well, there
come times, if you'll believe me, when I've caught myself feeling
I'd hail with pleasure even a sight of old
What-was-his-name?&mdash;you know, Mary, that vulgar old jackanapes
on board who was for ever buttonholing me...my particular <i>bete
noire</i>&mdash;yes, or even sundry other specimens of the
<i>omnium gatherum</i> we were blessed with."</p>

<p>"Well, I never! And me who thought you were only too glad to ged
rid of them."</p>

<p>"Faith and wasn't I?...at the time. Indeed, yes." And Mahony
smiled; for at Mary's words a picture rose before him of his
fellow-passengers as he had last seen them, standing huddled
together like frightened sheep on the platform of the great railway
terminus: an outlandish, countrified, colonial-looking set if ever
there was one, with their over-bushy hair and whiskers, their
overloud shepherds'-plaids and massy watch-chains, the ladies'
bonnets (yes, Mary's too!) seeming somehow all wrong. Even the most
cocksure of the party had been stunned into a momentary silence by
the murk of fog and steam that filled the space under the lofty
roofing; by the racket of whistling, snorting, blowing engines; the
hoarse shouts of cabbies and porters. But the first shock over,
spirits had risen in such crescendo that with a hasty: "Come, love,
let <i>us</i> get out of this!" he had torn Mary from voluminous
embraces, bundled her into a four-wheeler and bidden the driver
whip up. A parting glance through the peep-hole showed the group
still gesticulating, still vociferating, while crowns and
half-crowns rained on grinning porters, who bandied jokes about the
givers with expectant Jehus and a growing ring of onlookers. Their
very luggage, rough, makeshift, colonial, formed a butt for
ridicule.</p>

<p>Lost in such recollections&mdash;they included the whole dirty,
cold, cheerless reality of arrival; included the first breath drawn
of an air that smells and tastes like no other in the world; the
drive in a musty old growler reeking of damp straw, and pulled by
something "God might once have meant for a horse!" to an hotel, the
address of which he had kept to himself: "Or we should have the
whole lot of 'em trapesing after us!"&mdash;sunk in these memories,
Mahony let a further remark of Mary's pass unheeded. But when, with
a raucous cry, a butcher's boy stumped down the area steps, bearing
in his wooden tray the very meat, red and raw, that was to be
dished up on their table later on, he swung abruptly round, turning
his back on a sight he could not learn to tolerate. "Was there
<i>ever</i> such a place for keeping the material needs of the body
before one?...meat, milk, bread!...they're at it all day long. My
dear, I think I've heard you say your mother's house is not cursed
with a basement? Come, love, let us accept her invitation and go
down into the country. The English country, Mary! Change of air
will soon put you right again, and I could do, I assure you, with a
few nights' uninterrupted sleep. Besides, once I'm out of London,
it will be easier to see how the land lies with regard to that
country practice I've set my heart on."</p>

<p>This last reason would, he knew, appeal to Mary, whose chief
wish was to see him back at work. And sure enough she nodded and
said, very well then, they would just arrange to go.</p>

<p>For her part Mary saw that Richard's mind was as good as made
up: to oppose him would only be to vex him. Of course, it went
against the grain in her to be so fickle: to take lodgings for six
weeks and abandon them at the end of three! (Vainly had she tried,
at the time, to persuade Richard to a weekly arrangement. Richard
had <i>bought</i> the smile on their landlady's grim face; and she
felt certain did not regret it.) But though she hadn't shown it,
she had been shocked to hear the sum total of their expenses since
landing. Nor was there anything to keep them in London. They had
fitted themselves out from top to toe, in order to lose what
Richard persisted in calling "the diggers' brand"; and, say what he
might to the contrary, they had seen and heard enough of London to
last them for the rest of their lives. Museums, picture galleries,
famous buildings: all had been scampered through and they
themselves worn out, before the first week was over: her
ship-softened feet still burned at the remembrance. Yes, for
herself, she would be well pleased to get away. Privately she
thought London not a patch on Ballarat; thought it cold,
comfortless, dreary; a bewildering labyrinth of dirty streets. And
the longer she stayed there the more she regretted the bright,
clean, sunny land of her adoption.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that before the third week was over, they
were in the train bound for Leicester.</p>

<p>It was a wet day. Rain set in at dawn, and continued to fall
hour after hour, in one of those steady, sullen, soulless downpours
that mark the English autumn. Little could be seen by the two
travellers who sat huddled chillily in wraps and rugs, the soles of
their feet burning or freezing on tin foot-warmers&mdash;seen
either of the cast-iron sky, over which drifted lower, looser
bulges of cloud, or of the bare, flattish country through which the
train ran. On the one side the glass of the narrow window was
criss-crossed with rain stripes; on the other, the flying puffs of
steam, unwinding from the engine like fleecy cardings, wearisomely
interposed between their eyes and the landscape. Now and then
Mahony, peering disconsolately, caught a glimpse of a low-lying
meadow which, did a brook meander through it, was already half
under water. Here and there on a rise he distinguished a melancholy
spinney or copse: in its rainy darkness, trailed round by wreaths
of mist, it looked as fantastic as a drawing by Dore. On every
station at which they halted stood rows of squat, ruddy-faced
figures, dripping water from garments and umbrellas, the rich mud
of the countryside plastered over boots and leggings. They made
Mahony think of cattle, did these sturdy, phlegmatic
country-people&mdash;the soaked and stolid cattle that might be
seen in white-painted pens beside the railway, or herded in trucks
along the line. And both men and beasts alike seemed insensitive to
the surrounding gloom.</p>

<p>On the platform at Leicester, reached towards five o'clock, so
many muddied feet had passed and repassed that, even under cover,
not a clean or a dry spot was left. And still the rain fell,
hissing and spitting off the edges of the roof, lying as
chocolate-coloured puddles between the rails. In the station-yard
the wet cabs and omnibuses glistened in the dusk; and every hollow
of their leather aprons held its pool of water. The drivers,
climbing down from their boxes, shook themselves like dogs; the
patient horses drooped their heads and stood weak-kneed, their
coats dark and shiny with moisture.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!...what weather!" grumbled Mahony, and having got
Mary into the little private omnibus that was to bear them to their
destination, he watched a dripping, beery-faced coachman drag and
bump their trunks on to the roof of the vehicle, and stack the
inside full with carpet-bags and hand-portmanteaux. "Yet I suppose
this is what we have got to expect for the rest of our
days.&mdash;Keep your mouth well covered, my dear."</p>

<p>Behind her mufflings Mary vented the opinion that they would
have done better to time their landing in England for earlier in
the year.</p>

<p>"Yes; one forgets out there what an unspeakable climate this is.
The dickens! Look at the mould on the floor! I declare to you the
very cushions are damp." Having squeezed into the narrow space left
vacant for him, Mahony vehemently shut the door against the
intruding rain. And the top-heavy vehicle set to trundling over the
slippery cobbles.</p>

<p>But the discomfort of the journey was forgotten on arrival.</p>

<p>The omnibus drew up in a side street before a little red-brick
house&mdash;one of a terrace of six&mdash;standing the length of a
broom-handle back from the road. A diminutive leaden portico
overhung the door. Descending a step and going through a narrow
passage, they entered what Mahony thought would be but a dingy
sitting-room. But although small, and as yet unlit by candles, this
room seemed all alive with brightness. A clear fire burned in a
well-grate; a copper kettle on the hob shone like a great orange;
the mahogany of the furniture, polished to looking-glass splendour,
caught and gave back the flames, as did also, on the table spread
for tea, a copper urn and the old dented, fish-back silver. On the
walls twinkled the glass of the family portraits; even the
horsehair had high lights on it. A couple of armchairs faced the
blaze. And to this atmosphere of cosy comfort came in, chill and
numb, two sun-spoiled colonials, who were as much out of place in
the desolate, rain-swept night as would have been two lizards, but
lately basking on a sun-baked wall.</p>

<p>"Come, this is really <i>very</i> jolly, Mary!"</p>

<p>Thus Mahony, toasting his coat-tails before the fire, while
their hosts were absent on the last ceremonies connected with tea.
And went on, warmed through now, both in mind and body: "I fear
you've had a shocking old grizzler at your side of late, love. But
I've felt like a fish out of water. Idleness doesn't agree with me,
Mary. I must get back to work, my dear. I want a house of my own
again too. When I see a snug little place like this, after those
unspeakable lodgings, why, upon my word it makes me feel inclined
to jump at the first vacancy that offers."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would never do," said Mary with a smile. And their
hands, which had met, fell apart at the sound of footsteps.</p>

<p>It was also a cheerful evening; one that opened with jest and
laughter. For barely were they seated at the tea-table when sister
Lisby, who towered head and shoulders above her stout little dot of
a mother&mdash;Lisby shamelessly betrayed a secret, telling how,
while the travellers were upstairs removing their wraps, mother had
seized her and danced her round, exclaiming as she did: "Oh, my
dear, aren't we grand?...aren't we grand? Which I may mention was
not intended for you, Polly&mdash;I would say Mary. For I feel
sure, if you could see inside my mother's heart, you would find
yourself there no more than fourteen&mdash;the age you were when
last she saw you."</p>

<p>They all laughed; and Mother covered her old confusion by
picking up the sugar-tongs and dropping an extra lump into Mahony's
cup.</p>

<p>"Now give over, miss, will you?" she said affectionately. "Any
one but such a pert young thing as you would make allowance for an
old woman's pleasure at getting a son again. Ready-made,
too&mdash;without any bother. Eight of 'em, Richard my dear, have I
brought into this world in my day &mdash;a baker's dozen all told,
boys and girls together&mdash;and not one is left to their poor old
mother but this forward young party here. And she'd be off if she
could."</p>

<p>"My mother," said Lisby&mdash;having filled and handed round the
cups, she was now engaged in apportioning a pork pie, performing
the task with a nicety that made Mahony think of Shylock and his
bond: not a crumb was spilt or wasted&mdash;"My mother would have
me sit all day at the parlour window, on the watch for some Prince
Charming. To him she would gladly resign me. But because I wish to
go out into the world and stand on my own feet..."</p>

<p>"Lisby! Not woman's rights, I hope?" interposed Mary. And
reassured: "Then, mother, I should let her try it. Especially now
you've got me to look after you. Lisby, my dear, if you had been in
the colony with us in the early days&mdash;" and here Mary dilated
on some of the hard and incongruous jobs she had seen women put
their hands to.</p>

<p>"Now, did you ever?" ejaculated Lisby&mdash;with force, but a
divided mind. At present she was carving a cold chicken with the
same precision as the pie. (Mahony laughed afterwards when, sunk
deep in the feathers, he lay watching the gigantic shadows flung by
a single candle on the white ceiling, and Mary braided her hair;
laughed and said, Lisby's carving made him think of a first-year
medical performing on a frog.) "<i>Never</i> did I hear tell of
such things! I declare, my dear, I am reminded of Miss Delauncey of
Dupew. You will remember her, Polly&mdash;I would say Mary." ("I
think I do just remember the name," from Mary.) "Well, my dear,
what must she do but leave home&mdash;against her father's
will&mdash;to go and be a governess in Birmingham." And now Lisby
in her turn held forth on the surprising adventures of Miss
Delauncey, who, finding herself in a post that did not suit her,
was obliged to take another.</p>

<p>This kind of thing happened more than once during the meal: the
ball of talk, glancing aside from the guests' remoter experiences,
was continually coming back to Lisby and the world she knew. Her
old mother, it seemed to Mahony, was shyer, more retiring. But
though she did not say much, it was she who peeped into cups to see
if the bottoms were showing; who put titbits on Mary's plate when
Mary was not looking; pressed Mahony to a dish of cheesecakes with
a smile that would have won any heart. He returned the smile,
accepted the cakes, but otherwise, finding no point of contact, sat
silent. Mary, with an eye to him through all Lisby's chat, feared
her relatives would think him stiff and dull.</p>

<p>But tea over, chairs drawn to the fire, feet planted on the
fender, Mother turned her pretty old pink-and-white face framed in
lisse cap and bands to Mahony, and seeing him still sit meditative,
laid her plump little hand over his long thin one, which rested on
the arm of his chair. And as he did not resist, she made it a
prisoner, and carried it to her shiny old black silk lap. Sitting
in this way, hand in hand with him, she began to put gentle
questions about the lives and fates of those dearest to her: John,
John's two families of children, and his wives, neither of whom,
not the lovely Emma, nor yet soft, brown-eyed Jinny&mdash;to whom,
through her letters, she had grown deeply attached&mdash;could she
now ever hope to know on earth. Next Zara, whom she called Sarah:
"For the name I chose for her at her baptism I still think good
enough for her," with a stingless laugh at her eldest daughter's
elegancies. Steady Jerry, who would never set the Thames on fire.
Ned, poor dear unfortunate Ned, who had been a source of anxiety to
her since his birth&mdash;"Ah, but I was troubled when I carried
him, Richard!"&mdash;from whom she had not heard directly for many
a long day. Inquiring thus after her brood, and commenting on what
she heard with a rare good sense, she gradually lured Mahony into a
talking-fit that subdued even Lisby, and kept them all out of their
beds till two o'clock in the morning. Once started, Richard proved
regularly in the vein; and Mary no longer needed to fear lest he be
thought dull or stand-off. Indeed, she found herself listening with
interest. For he told things&mdash;gave reasons for throwing up his
Ballarat practice, described sensations on the homeward voyage and
in London&mdash;which were new even to her. At some of them she
rather opened her eyes. She didn't want to insinuate that Richard
was inventing them on the spur of the moment; but she did
think&mdash;and on similar occasions had thought before
now&mdash;that certain ideas occurred to him only when he got
fairly wound up: he was like a fisher who didn't always know what
he was going to catch.&mdash;Besides, there was this odd
contradiction in Richard: he who was usually so reserved could, she
had noticed, sometimes speak out more frankly, unbosom himself more
easily, to people he was meeting for the first time, than to those
he lived his life with. It was as if he said to himself, once
didn't count.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-3" id="ch-2-1-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>The next-door house, the first in the row, stood at right angles
to the rest, and faced two diverging streets of shops and stores.
Further, the little leaden rain-shield over the front door was
supported by a pair of pillars coloured to resemble marble, between
which hung a red lamp. This lamp had burned there, night for night,
for over half a Century: the stone of the doorstep was worn to a
hollow by the countless feet that had rubbed and scraped and
shuffled, under its ruby glow. For the house belonged to old Mr.
Brocklebank the surgeon, who was one of the original landmarks of
the neighbourhood. He had, in fact, lived there so long that none
was old enough to remember his coming&mdash;with the possible
exception, said Mother, of old Joe Dorgan, for sixty years past,
ostler at the "Saddlers' Arms." Joe was now in his dotage, and his
word did not count for much; but in earlier life he had been heard
to tell of the slim and elegant figure young Brocklebank had once
cut, in redingote, choker and flowered gilet; and of how people had
thought twice before summoning him, owing to his extreme youth.
This defect time had remedied; and so effectually that it soon
passed belief to connect youth and slimness with the heavy and
corpulent old man. When, for instance, mother came there as a
bride, he had seemed to her already elderly; the kind of doctor a
young wife could with propriety consult.</p>

<p>The practice had flourished till it was second to none; and he
was reported, being a bachelor and very thrifty, not to say
close-fisted, to have laid by the thousands which in this town were
commonly associated only with leather or hose. But now he had all
but reached the eighties; and despite one of those marvellous
country-bred English constitutions&mdash;founded on ruddy steaks,
and ale, and golden cheddars&mdash;the infirmities of age began to
vex him. For some time past his patients had hesitated to call him
out by night, or in bad weather, or for what he might consider too
trifling a cause; though they remained his faithful adherents,
preferring any day a bottle of Mr. B.'s good physic to treatment by
a more modish doctor. Recently, however, he had let two
comparatively simple cases slip through his fingers; while the
habit was growing on him of suddenly nodding off at a bedside; what
time the patient had to lie still until the old gentleman came to
himself again. A blend, too, of increasing deafness and obstinacy
led him to shout people down. So that altogether something like a
sigh of relief went up when one fine day a great-nephew appeared,
and the rumour ran that Mr. B. was retiring: was being carried off
to end his honourable and useful career under another's tutelage;
to be wheeled to the grave-brink in the humiliating bath-chair to
which he had condemned many a sufferer. And house and practice were
for sale.</p>

<p>Lisby came primed with the news&mdash;brought by the milkman on
his early round&mdash;to the breakfast-table. And Mother, her first
shock over and her eyes dried, fell into a reminiscent mood.</p>

<p>"Dear oh deary me! Old Mr. B. laid on the shelf! Why, it seems
only like the other day I saw him for the first time...when Johnny
was born. Yet it must be nigh on five-and-forty years; Johnny will
be forty-five come March. In walks Mr. B.&mdash;I'd never needed a
doctor till then&mdash;and says to me&mdash;me, poor young ignorant
thing thankful to have escaped with my life&mdash;in he comes:
'Here's a fine fish we've landed to-day, madam! Here's a new
recruit for the Grenadier Guards! Twelve pounds if an ounce, and a
leg like a three-year-old!' I up on my elbow to see, and he quite
gruffly: 'Lie down you villainous young mother, you! Do you want to
make an orphan of the brat?' He had always to have his joke had Mr.
B. and we were good friends from that day. One after another he
brought the whole batch of you into the world.&mdash;Deary me, I
shall miss him. Many and many's the time he's stepped over the
railing with his weekly news-sheet: 'Here's a murder case to make
you ladies' blood run cold,' he would say. Or: 'Another great
nugget found on the goldfields!'&mdash;for he knew the ties I had
with the colony. And the last sound I used to hear at night was him
knocking out his pipe on the chimney-piece. It was such a comfort
to me&mdash;after your father went and the boys scattered&mdash;to
know we'd a man so close. Especially in '59, when those dreadful
burglaries took place."</p>

<p>"Now, mother, give over trying to make yourself engaging," was
Lisby's comment. "You know the truth is, no one troubled less about
the burglars than you. Before my mother went to bed she would lay
out all the silver and plate and her rings and brooches, in neat
piles on the table, so as to save the robbers trouble should they
come."</p>

<p>"So as to save my own skin, you saucy girl!&mdash;Well,
well!...what's past is past. To be sure it wouldn't have done for
him to go on doctoring till he lost his memory, and perhaps mixed
his drugs and poisoned us all."</p>

<p>"It would not indeed. And for the rest, my dear mother, I tell
you what: Mary and I will take up our abode next door and look
after you," said Mahony.</p>

<p>At the moment, the words passed as the jest they were meant for.
But they sowed their seed. Mahony ate his toast and drained his cup
with an absent air; and as soon as breakfast was over made Mary a
private sign to follow him upstairs. There, while she sat on the
edge of the bed, he fidgeted about the room, fingering objects and
laying them down again in a manner that told of a strong inner
excitement.</p>

<p>"I spoke without reflection but, upon my soul, it does look
rather like the finger of Providence. An opening to crop up in this
way at my very elbow!...one that's not to be despised either, if
report speaks true. Really, wife, I don't know what to think. It
has quite unsettled me. Here have I been expecting to have to
travel the country, visiting this place and that, answering
advertisements that lead to nothing, or myself advertising and
receiving no replies&mdash;all so much nerve and shoe
wear&mdash;and a dreary business at best. You see, my dear, what I
need first of all is English experience. I mean"&mdash;he made an
airy gesture&mdash;"I must be able to say, when I find the
perfectly suitable position I'm looking for: 'I've been practising
in such and such a place for so and so many years, and have had a
first-class connection there.'&mdash;You notice, I hope, I have no
intention&mdash;should I take the chance offered me, that is, and
pop in here&mdash;of the making it a permanency. It remains my
ambition to live in the country. But if only half what they say of
old Brocklebank's affairs is to be believed, a few years here
wouldn't hurt me. There are <i>pots</i> of money to be made in
these manufacturing towns, once a practice is set going&mdash;and
this has existed for over half a century. Besides, it might even
improve under my hands...why not, indeed? Such a Methuselah must
have been entirely out of date in medicine. I confess it isn't
exactly the spot I would have chosen, even to start in, were money
and time no object. But considering, Mary, what our expenses have
been...the lateness of the season, too! Why, it's virtually winter
already, and the worst possible time of year to travel about in."
And so on, with much more in the same strain, and a final bait of:
"Another point we mustn't lose sight of is that here, you, love,
would have the company of your mother and sister. And I think I
know what a pleasure that would be to you."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course, as far as that's concerned," said Mary,
who had not interrupted by a word.</p>

<p>"Well, and the rest?" he asked a trifle querulously. "Don't I
convince you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," she said again, but slowly. "In one way. I agree it
might be worth considering. But I wouldn't be in <i>too</i> great a
hurry, Richard. Look about you. See some other places first."</p>

<p>"Yes, and while I hum and haw and think myself too good for it,
some one else snaps it up. The profession is in very different case
here, my dear, from what it was in the colonies. It's
overcrowded...worked to death. I can't afford to be too particular.
Must just find a modest corner, slip into it and be
thankful.&mdash;And let me give you a piece of advice, Mary," he
went on more warmly, with the waxing impatience of a man who longs
to see his own hesitation overthrown. "It's no earthly use your
comparing everything that turns up on this side of the globe, with
Ballarat. A practice like that won't come my way again; or at least
not in the meantime. <i>Try</i>, love, not to let yourself be
influenced by the size of a house and the width of a street. I
assure you once more, you have no conception what these provincial
concerns are worth. If I step into old Brocklebank's shoes, you may
drive in your carriage yet, my dear!"</p>

<p>Mary had run through so many considerations in listening, that
she had really listened more to herself than to him. Of course,
much of what he said was sound. Did he settle here, it would save
time and money&mdash;and one of her standing fears about the new
venture had been that Richard would prove too hard to please. But
for him now to rush to the other extreme! Nor was she one to stand
out for showiness and style; or rather, she would not be, were
Richard a different man. But he, with his pernickitiness! And it
was all very well for him to say, don't draw comparisons; how could
one help it? To have flung up a brilliant practice, a big house and
garden, a host of congenial friends...for this a pokey house in a
small dull street, in a dull, ugly, dirty town. As for what
<i>she</i> stood to gain by it, the living door by door with mother
and sister, fond as she was of them she could see, even here,
drawbacks that were invisible to his man's eye.</p>

<p>However, since the one way to deal with Richard was to give him
his head, and only by degrees deftly trickle in doubts and
scruples, Mary smothered her own feelings for the time being.
Perhaps he was right, said she: the place might do for a start; and
she was certainly against him going travelling in winter with the
objection he had to flannel. Mr. Brocklebank's advisers might, of
course, ask a stiff price for the goodwill of the practice; still,
if he got on well for two or three years, that would soon be
covered. Thus Mary, trusting to a certain blind common sense that
<i>did</i> exist in Richard for all his flightiness, if he was
neither badgered nor opposed. ("Just the Irish way of getting at a
thing backwards!" was how he himself described it.) One point
though she insisted on; and that was, he should take an outside
opinion on the practice before entering into negotiations.</p>

<p>Entirely pacified, Mahony kissed her and together they went
downstairs. According to Mother, who had now to be drawn into
confidence, the person to consult would be Bealby the chemist; he
had dispensed for Mr. B. ever since the old man grew too
comfortable to do it for himself. So Mahony on with his hat and off
to Bealby's shop, well content to leave Mary to damp the
exasperating flutter into which the news had thrown her relatives.
Well, no, he wouldn't say that: in Mother even this was bearable.
It was true, declaring you might knock her down with a feather, she
had seated herself heavily in her chair by the fire, to think and
talk over the plan in detail. But her cheery old mind saw only the
bright side of it; while her kindly, humorous smile took the sting
from fuss and curiosity. Lisby was harder to repress. She threw up
her hands. "No! <i>Never</i> did I hear tell of such a thing,
Polly&mdash;I would say Mary! Going off to buy a practice, my dear,
for all the world as if it were a tooth-brush or a cravat!" Richard
safely out of the house, Mary felt constrained to come to his
defence.</p>

<p>"You must remember, Lisby, it doesn't seem <i>quite</i> such an
important affair to Richard as it does to you. With all his
experience. Living in the colony, too, one learnt to make up one's
mind quickly. You had to. Think of shares, for instance. They might
be all right when you went to bed, and by the morning have sunk
below par; so that you had to decide there and then whether to sell
out or risk holding on." The mild amusement with which Richard's
behaviour provided Lisby was apt to jar on Mary.</p>

<p>From the chemist Mahony got all the information he
wanted&mdash;and more. The object of his visit grasped, he was led
into a dingy little parlour behind the shop, where, amid an
overflow of jars and bottles and drawer-cases, Bealby carried on
his ex-business life. And both doors noiselessly closed to ensure
their privacy, the chemist&mdash;a rubicund, paunchy old man, with
snow-white hair and whiskers&mdash;himself grew so private that he
spoke only in a whisper, and accompanied his words with a
forefinger laid flat along his nose. This mysterious air gave the
impression that he was divulging dark secrets; though he had no
secret to tell, nor would his hearer have thanked him for any.
Plainly he was a rare old gossip, and as such made the most both of
his subject and the occasion. Mahony could neither dam nor escape
from his flow of talk. However, his account of the practice was so
favourable that the rest had just to be swallowed&mdash;even
disagreeable tittle-tattle about the old surgeon's mode of life. At
the plum kept to the last&mdash;Brocklebank, it appeared, had
actually been called in professionally to the great house of the
district, Castle Bellevue&mdash;Mahony could not repress a smile;
Bealby alluding to it with a reverence that would have befitted a
religious rite. Of more practical importance was the information
that there were already two candidates for the practice in the
field; but that to these, he, Mahony, would no doubt be preferred;
for both were young men, just about to start. And: "We want no
fledglings, no young sawbones in a position such as this, sir! Now
with an elderly man like yourself..." Wincing, Mahony contrived
soon after to let slip the fact that he was but a couple of years
over forty.</p>

<p>"His eyes almost jumped out of his head when I said it, Mary.
The fellow had evidently put me down for sixty or thereabouts," he
came back on the incident that night. "It made me feel I must be
beginning to look a very old man."</p>

<p>"Not old, Richard. Only rather delicate. And the people here are
all so rosy and sturdy that they don't understand any one being
pale and thin."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm positive he thought me a contemporary, if not just of
old B.'s, at least of his own."</p>

<p>What he did not mention to Mary was the impression he saw he
left Bealby under, that lack of success had been the reason of his
quitting Australia. Were he only more skilled at blowing his own
trumpet! Actually the old fool seemed to think he, Mahony, would be
bettering himself by settling in Leicester!</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I can promise you, you will find an old-established,
first-class practice, such as this, a very different thing from
those you have been used to. England, doctor, old England! There's
no place like it." At which Mahony, who had himself, aloud and in
secret, rung changes on this theme, regarded the speaker&mdash;his
paunch, due to insufficient exercise; his sheeplike, inexperienced
old face; his dark little living-room, and darker still,
mysterious, provincial manner&mdash;looked, and knew that he did
not, in the very least, mean the same thing any more.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>"Come, give over, Mary!" said Mother affectionately.</p>

<p>Mother sat by the fire in the twilight, her hands folded
placidly in her lap. She was neither a sewer nor a knitter. If not
nimbly trotting about the house, in aid of the rheumaticky old
servant, she liked best to sit still and do nothing; which Richard
said made her a most soothing companion. Her words were addressed
to Mary, who was rattling a sewing-machine as if her life depended
on it. They also referred to a remark passed in a pause of her
handle-twirling. This had constituted a criticism of
Richard&mdash;or as much of a criticism as Mary could rise to.
Which, here, she felt quite safe in making, so surely did she know
Richard nested in Mother's heart.</p>

<p>That afternoon&mdash;it was December, and night now soon after
three o'clock&mdash;he had&mdash;and not for the first
time&mdash;stepped over the low railing that separated the
garden-plots to say: "Come, Lisby, let us go a-gallivanting!"
Nothing loath, Lisby, also not for the first time, laid aside her
needle, tied on bonnet and tippet, and off they went arm-in-arm, to
prowl round the lighted shops of the town.</p>

<p>Mary's objection was: "But if he's wanted, mother! I shouldn't
know where to send for him."</p>

<p>"My dear, Eliza would find him for you in less than half an
hour.&mdash;Besides, Mary, it's very unlikely anyone would want him
in such a hurry as all that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. It's me that's silly. But you see, in
Ballarat he never dreamt of going out without leaving word just
where he was to be found. Indeed, he seldom went out for pleasure
at all. He was much too busy."</p>

<p>Mother did not put the question that would have leapt, under
similar conditions, to Lisby's lips: "Then, why, in the name of
fortune, did he leave it?" She only said: "You must have patience,
my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not me&mdash;it's him I'm afraid of. Patience is one
of the things Richard hasn't got."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. Then: "You have a very good husband,
Mary. Value him, my dear, at his true worth.&mdash;Nay, child, let
the lamp be. Can't you sit idle for half an hour?"</p>

<p>She stirred the fire to a blaze which lit up their faces, and
the many-folded drapery of their gowns.</p>

<p>"I know that, mother. But he doesn't get easier to manage as he
grows older. In some ways Richard is most difficult&mdash;very,
very queer."</p>

<p>"And pray, doesn't the old tree get knobby and gnarled?...Take a
hint from your mother, my dear&mdash;for though, Mary, you've been
so long away from me, I know my own flesh and blood as no one else
can. Be glad, child, not sorry, if Richard has his little faults
and failings&mdash;even if you can't understand 'em. They help to
bind him. For his roots in this world don't go deep, Mary. He
doesn't set proper store on the prizes other men hanker
after&mdash;money and position and influence, and such like." She
paused again, to add: "It's a real misfortune, my dear, you have no
children."</p>

<p>"Yes, and me so fond of them, too. But I'm not sure about
Richard. He's got used, now, to being without them, to having only
himself to consider. I'm afraid he'd find them in the way."</p>

<p>"And yet it was of Richard I was thinking," said the old lady
gently.</p>

<p>"You say he's hard to manage, Mary," she went on. "But la!
child, what does that matter? He's kind, generous, straight as a
die&mdash;I'm sure I'm right in believing he's never done a mean
action in his life?"</p>

<p>"Never! It isn't in him."</p>

<p>"Well, then!" said Mother: and her cheerful old tone was like a
verbal poke in the ribs. "He might be easier to manage,
Mary&mdash;and thoughtless...or stingy...or attentive to other
women. You little know what you're spared, child, in not having
that to endure. There are some poor wives would think you like the
princess in the fairytale, who couldn't sleep for the pea." She
fell into a reverie over this, sat looking into the heart of the
fire. "Men?&mdash;ah, my dear! to me even the best of 'em seem only
like so many children. We have to be mothers to 'em as well as
wives, Mary; watch over them the same as over those we've borne;
and feel thankful if their nature is sound, behind all the little
surface tricks and naughtinesses. Men may err and stray, my dear,
but they must always find us here to come back to, and find us
forgiving and unchanged.&mdash;But tut, tut, what a sermon your old
mother's preaching you! As if you weren't the happiest of wives,"
and she laid her soft old hand on Mary's. "I got led into it, I
suppose, because of the strong tie between us: you're more like me,
Mary, than any of the rest. Another thing, too: I'm a very old
woman, my dear, and shan't live to see the end of the day's
business. So always remember, love, Mother's advice to you was
this: not to worry over small things&mdash;the big ones will need
all your strength. And you can't do Richard's experiencing for him,
Mary, however much you'd like to spare him the knocks and jars of
it.&mdash;But I do declare, here they come. Now what will they say
to finding us gossiping in the dark?"</p>

<p>The shoppers' steps echoed down the quiet street&mdash;really
sounding like one rather heavy footfall&mdash;and turned in at the
gate. And then there were voices and laughter and the sound of
rustling paper and snipped string in the little room, where Mary
lit the lamp, and Lisby displayed her presents&mdash;sweetmeats, a
piece of music she had coveted, a pair of puce-covered gloves, a
new net for her chignon&mdash;while Mother tried to prevent the
great round pork pie Mahony deposited on her lap, from sliding into
the grate.</p>

<p>"You dear naughty spendthrift of a man! Why, the girl's head
will be turned."</p>

<p>"Come, mother, let me give her a little pleasure."</p>

<p>"You give yourself more, or I'm much mistaken."</p>

<p>"Pooh! Such trifles! I shouldn't otherwise know what to do with
my small change," retorted Mahony. And Mary laughed and said:
"Wait, mother, till the practice really begins to move, and then
you'll see!"</p>

<p>This nudged Mahony's memory. "Has any one been?"</p>

<p>"They hadn't when I came over. And Mary Ann has not knocked at
the wall.&mdash;Oh yes, the boy called with an account from Mr.
Bealby."</p>

<p>The news of the empty afternoon, together with Mary's
colonialism, grated on Mahony. "<i>Do</i> knight him, my dear,
while you're about it," he said snappishly.</p>

<p>"Oh well, Bealby then. Though, I really can't see what it
matters. And out there, if I <i>hadn't</i> said Mr. Chambers, Mr.
Tangye, you would have been the one to suffer."</p>

<p>"And I can assure you, my dears, Bealby won't think any the
worse of you for turning him into a gentleman," soothed Mother.</p>

<p>"Oh! but Richard is very correct&mdash;aren't you, dear?"</p>

<p>Here Lisby had also to put in her spoke.</p>

<p>"And Bellvy Castle, pray?&mdash;what of Bellvy Castle? Has still
no groom come riding post-haste to summon you?"</p>

<p>Heartily tired of this jest, which he himself had innocently
started, Mahony picked up a book and stuck his nose in it. "No, nor
ever will."</p>

<p>"Come, Lisby," said Mother, "the kettle's boiling its head
off.&mdash;Richard, my dear, draw up your chair; you must be cold
and famished.&mdash;Nay, Mary, I'll not let you go home. We're
going to drink a cosy cup together. And afterwards Richard shall
tell us more adventures of the early days. I've looked forward to
it all the afternoon. It's as good as any book."</p>

<p>Mahony had more than once said to his wife: "Before I knew your
mother, Mary, I used to think <i>you</i> the warmest-hearted
creature under the sun. But now that I know her, love, and can draw
comparisons, I declare you sometimes seem to me quite a hard and
reasonable young woman."</p>

<p>And then he would fall to musing on the subject of wisdom inborn
and acquired. Here was this little old lady, who knew nothing of
the world, had never, indeed, travelled fifty miles from her native
place, and yet was richer in wisdom&mdash;intuitive wisdom, the
wisdom of the heart&mdash;than any second mortal he had met. He
could not picture to himself the situation, however tangled, that
Mary's mother would fail to see through, and, seeing, to judge
soundly and with loving kindness. Yes, his acquaintance with and
affection for her was the one thing that helped him over the blank
disappointment of these early weeks.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-4" id="ch-2-1-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>The surgery was a small, darkish room on the ground floor, a
step or two below street level; and the window behind which Mahony
spent the greater part of his first English winter was screened
from the curiosity of passers-by, by an attorney's brown gauze
shade. Across this blind he saw people move like shadows; or like
bodies immersed in water, only the tops of whose crowns shewed
above the surface. There went the hooded tray and crooked arm of
the tinkling muffin-man; and the wares of the buy-a-brooms. There,
also, to the deep notes of his bigger bell and his insistent: "To
all whom it may concern!" passed the shiny black hat of the town
crier. Regularly, too, at dusk, through fog or silvery rain, the
lamp-lighter's ladder and torch rose into Mahony's field of vision,
flicking alive the little gas flame that set his own brass plates
a-glitter.</p>

<p>About this surgery hung a disagreeable, penetrating
smell&mdash;a kind of blend of the countless drugs that had been
housed and mixed there for over half a century&mdash;and, air as
you might, it was not to be got rid of. It gave even Mary, who was
not sensitive to smells, the headache. Otherwise, during Richard's
absences she might have used this room, which held a comfortable
armchair. As it was, she found herself fairly crowded out. The
passage was so narrow that two people were a tight fit in it; and,
were more than two in waiting, they had to be furnished with seats
in the little parlour to the back, pokier, this, than even the
surgery, and very dark&mdash;Richard called it the "Black
Hole"&mdash;giving as it did on a walled-in yard no bigger than a
roofless prison cell. Altogether, the accommodation was so cramped
that it was like living in a mouse-trap. Still, it would have been
folly in the beginning to separate house from practice, when the
two had hung together for so long. Time enough later on to make
changes. Mary's own idea was to turn the first-floor bedroom into a
drawing-room. Richard talked of moving; of knocking two houses into
one; even of building for himself. In the meantime he had taken the
house on a short lease, preferring to pay a higher rent for a few
years than to bind himself for the mystic seven. And so it was
mainly in the bedroom that Mary spent her first winter; sewing,
sheerly to kill time, garments she did not need, or which she might
just as well have "given out." Sitting bent over her needle in the
half daylight, she could sometimes almost have smiled did she think
of the sacrifices they had made&mdash;all for this. But for the
most part she felt troubled and anxious. Richard had tied himself
down for three years; but not a month had passed before her
constant, nagging worry was: how long will he hold out?</p>

<p>Mahony, too, was offended by the atmosphere of his room: though
not so much by the drugs, to which his nose was seasoned, as by the
all-pervading reek of stale tobacco. This hung about and
persisted&mdash;though a carpenter speedily prised open the
hermetically sealed window&mdash;and only became bearable when a
good fire burned and the room was thoroughly warm. Cooled off, it
had a cold, flat, stagnant smell that turned you sick. His old
forerunner must have kept his pipe going like a furnace; have
wadded it, too, with the rankest of weeds. Even had the practice
been shaping satisfactorily this smell might have ended by driving
him from the room; which would also have meant from the house. As
things stood, however, it was not worth his while to think of
moving. Before a month was up he suspected what two months showed,
and three made plain as the nose on his face: the whole affair had
been of the nature of a gross take-in.</p>

<p>There he sat, with the last numbers of the medical journals, new
books on medicine before him, and was too unsettled to read, or, if
he did, to make sense of what he read. The mischief was not only
that the practice didn't move properly: what came was of entirely
the wrong sort. He had not had half a dozen calls to good houses
since starting. The patients who had thus far consulted him were
the servant-girls and petty tradesmen of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In fits of exasperation, he knew what it was to feel convinced
that the entries in the books laid before him at purchase, the rosy
tales of Brocklebank's receipts, had been invented for his
decoying. If not, what in the name of fortune had become of the
practice? In calmer moments, he absolved those about him from the
charge of wilful fraud: they had acted according to their
lights&mdash;that was all. That their way of looking at things was
not his, was constantly being brought home to him anew. And how,
indeed, could he expect them, who had passed their whole lives
fixed as vegetables on the selfsame spot, to know his touchstone
for a practice? For example, the visit, famous in local history,
paid by old Brocklebank to Bellevue Castle. On closer scrutiny this
dwindled into the bandaging of a turned ankle, an ankle belonging
to one of the under-servants who had slipped on a greasy cobble
while at market. Never had old B. set foot in the Castle: or, at
most&mdash;little more than a servant himself&mdash;had entered it
but by the back door. Chagrin was not the only feeling this
incident roused in Mahony: he found insufferable the obsequious
attitude of mind it spoke to in those concerned. Long residence in
a land where every honest man was the equal of his neighbour had
unfitted him for the genuflexions of the English middle-classes
before the footstools of the great. But he had given up trying to
make himself or his views intelligible. For all that those about
him understood, he might as well have been speaking Chinese; while
any reference to the position and income he had turned his back on,
called to their eyes a look of doubt, and even disbelief. They
considered him a supremely lucky man to have stepped into old
Brocklebank's shoes; and at his door alone would the blame be laid,
if he failed to succeed.</p>

<p>And failing he was! So far, he had booked the magnificent sum of
slightly over a couple of pounds weekly. Two pounds! It reminded
him of his first struggle-and-starve campaign on taking up practice
after his marriage. Only under one condition could he have faced
the present situation with equanimity; and that, paradoxically
enough, was, if he had not seen the colour of the money, and it had
stood on account to some of the big houses round about. As it was,
it dribbled in, a few shillings here, a few there; which meant that
his spending had also to be done in driblets&mdash;a habit it was
easier to lose than to recapture. Yes! if the handful of shares he
had left invested in the colony were not bringing in what they did,
he and Mary would at this moment have been reduced to living on
their capital.</p>

<p>Talking of Mary: her position here was another bite he could not
swallow. It had really not been fair of him to foist this kind of
thing on Mary. To begin with, the house&mdash;possibly the
neighbourhood, too, dark, crowded, airless did not suit her. She
looked pale and thin, and had never quite lost the cough she had
arrived with. How could she, indeed, when she sat for hours at a
stretch stooped over her needle? She had no society worth the
name&mdash;never a drive, a party, a bazaar. Her sole diversion was
tending her mother; undertaking the countless odd jobs the old lady
and her rheumaticky maidservant had need of. In one way, of course,
this was right and proper; and he did not begrudge her to the
mother from whom she had so long been parted. His grudge was aimed
at another quarter. Soon after Christmas Lisby had made good her
escape, and was now established as resident mistress at a Young
Ladies' Seminary, near Leeds. Which wormed, in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>No complaint crossed Mary's lips; she sacrificed herself as
cheerfully as usual. None the less, he owed one of his chief
worries during these weeks to Mary. For he could <i>feel</i> that
she did not expect him to hold fast, and lived in suspense lest he
should throw up the sponge. The consciousness of this galled
him&mdash;got on his nerves. Yet never had he felt so averse from
breaking silence. It was not only self-annoyance at the foolishness
he had been guilty of; or anticipation of a resigned, I-told-you-so
attitude on Mary's part&mdash;she <i>had</i> told him so, of
course; but it wouldn't be Mary if, when the crisis came, she
twitted him with it. No, what tied his tongue was his own
disinclination to face the future.</p>

<p>The result was that Mary, too, grew fidgety: it was so unlike
Richard to bottle himself up in this fashion. She began to be
afraid he was afraid of her and of what she might say. So, one
evening, as they sat together over book and needle, she herself
broke the ice by asking him point-blank whether he regretted having
settled in Leicester. "For I can see the practice is not doing much
in the meantime. Still...if you otherwise like the place..."</p>

<p>At her first word the torrent burst.</p>

<p>"<i>Like</i> it? I wish to God I'd never set foot in its hideous
red-brick streets! As for the practice not doing much&mdash;my
dear, it has melted into thin air, and that's all there is to say
about it. The great majority of that old horse-doctor's patients
have given me the go-by&mdash;what on earth has become of the
wealthy shoemakers, etc., whose names stood on his books, Heaven
alone knows! It can't be that they disapprove of my treatment, for
they've never even tried it. Upon my word, Mary, I sometimes think
the whole thing was a fake and a swindle. But I can tell you this:
if I stop here, I'm on the high road to becoming a sixpenny doctor
for the masses. And I will confess to feeling myself a little too
good for that."</p>

<p>"I should think so! It's really most unfortunate, Richard. But
what's to be done?"</p>

<p>"The only course I can see, is to get out of it. I've made a big
mistake, my dear, and the shortest and cheapest way in the end will
be to admit it and tot up the balance. I could curse myself now,
for not having taken your advice. Over hasty as always! The only
excuse for me is, I honestly believed there was money to be made
here. And was in a panic at the rate our funds were running
away."</p>

<p>"Well, it's no use crying over spilt milk. But since you own you
did rush rather blindly into this, be warned and don't, for
goodness sake, do the same thing in getting out of it. Give it a
year's trial."</p>

<p>But the bare idea turned him cold. Now, too, that he had had his
say, he felt doubly resolute. Aloud, he declared that another three
months spent in these dark quarters, among this stickiest
provinciality, in the mud, wind and rain of this dirty, wet, dismal
town, would drive him crazy. "The very smell of the place does for
me. Leather and corn and horses&mdash;horses and leather and corn!
A population of ostlers and grooms and commercial gentlemen, and
cattle-dealers and bull-necked farmers. No, thank you, my dear, no
more of it for me! Naturally I shall sell at a loss; but the sooner
the better, Mary, before the practice falls to pieces altogether."
And from this decision he was not to be moved.</p>

<p>The question of what next brought them to another deadlock. Mary
had got it into her head that, if he went from here, it should only
be to London&mdash;and was dumbfounded by the moody silence into
which he fell at London's very name.&mdash;"It's society you've
missed, Richard. Even had you got on well, you couldn't have put up
with the lack of that. But if you persist in sticking to your
original plan and going to live in some miserable little village,
it will be worse than ever. You used to say you felt cut off in
Ballarat. But since we've..."</p>

<p>"And you?...what about you, pray?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for me it's been different"&mdash;dear Mary!&mdash;"living
next door to my mother and all that."</p>

<p>"Well, I can tell you this, wife. I've grown more attached to
your mother, her kind heart and sound sense, than I was to any one
in all Australia. And certainly more than I am to my own."</p>

<p>"Surely it's time you proved that? What must they be thinking of
you?" ("They? Oh? they'll understand. You forget they're Irish,
too, love.") "Well, Richard, my advice is...if you're quite
determined to move from here...go and pay some visits and travel
about a bit, as you ought to have done at first."</p>

<p>Than this, no suggestion could have jumped better with Mahony's
mood: his cramped soul longed to stretch its wings. Spring was at
the door, too: that English spring the marvels of which he had seen
so often in imagination&mdash;and in imagination continued to catch
his only glimpse of them, shut up between brick walls as he was. At
Mary's words he had a sudden vision of all the
loveliness&mdash;green downs rolling to the sea, orchards in
blossom, dewy old bird-haunted gardens&mdash;that he had missed, in
flinging himself hugger-mugger on the business of money-making in
this sordid town. And so, overthrowing in his haste his original
plan of waiting till he was in more prosperous circumstances to
present himself, he packed his carpet-bag and went off to visit his
relatives and renew his acquaintance with his <i>alma mater</i>,
putting the practice up for sale, and leaving a <i>locum</i> to
hold together what remained of it. According to the innate
perversity of things, he had no sooner done this than it showed
signs of betterment. His substitute was called in to one of the
hosier kings, bespoken by the wife of a wealthy tanner. Mere
chance, of course, but it did look as though fate had a special
down on him.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The nominal goal of his journey was Dublin; and after that
Edinburgh. But when he looked back on the weeks that followed, he
saw them solely in the light of a journey into the past. And now,
too, he grasped why he had so long postponed embarking on it. He
was, he discovered, one of those who have a nervous aversion from
returning on their traces.</p>

<p>Alighting from his car at a corner of the square, he stood, bag
in hand, and gazed at his old home. It was very early on a gusty,
grey, spring morning; and he himself was cold and unslept. Already,
too, the spiritual depression that is Ireland's first gift to her
homing sons was invading him: looking about him he saw only
stagnation and decay. Here now he stood, a worn and elderly
wayfarer, over whose head thirty odd years had passed since, as a
boy, he light-heartedly trod this pavement. Thirty years! Yet it
might have been yesterday. For nothing was changed&mdash;or nothing
but himself. And, as he moved towards the house, he had&mdash;in
self-defence as it were&mdash;a moment of vision, in which the long
trail of his life swept past the eye of his mind: his rich, motley
life, with all its blanks and prizes, its joys, pains and
compensations, let alone the multitude of other lives with which it
had made contact. And to think there had been moments when he
counted it a failure!</p>

<p>In the bulging glass flower-case outside the ground-floor
window, a familiar collection of ferns and green things pursued
their morbid growth. Down in the area stood the empty saucer,
placed there full, of a night, for any thirsty beast that passed.
Here was the well-known dent in the brass knocker; the ugly crack
in the stone coping. As of old, the balcony showed green and
mildewed with the water that leaked from a pair of flower-tubs;
just as he remembered it, the white carriage step was split
asunder&mdash;a trap for delicate feet. With this difference, that
the mould was thicker, the split wider, the cracks more
pronounced.</p>

<p>It was the same with his relatives; they, too, had made giant
strides along the road of decay: throats had sagged, eyes grown
smaller, knuckles bonier. Of the three, the older generation had
worn best. His mother carried herself erectly, was
slender&mdash;slender to emaciation&mdash;and, an inveterate enemy
of crinoline, wore clinging, trailing black garments of a style all
her own, she and his sisters moving like lank, heavily draped
maypoles, where other women bulged and billowed and swam. ("Good
Lord, what frights!" was his verdict on this deviation from the
norm.) With their ivory faces, long, finely pointed noses, straight
Irish eyebrows and pretty, insincere Irish mouths, the three of
them looked like replicas of the one cameo (as did also he, could
he but have seen himself); and since, in age, there was less than a
score of years between the trio, the relationship might have been
that of sisters rather than mother and daughters.</p>

<p>Thus dispassionately, and Irishly, he viewed them. As they him.
"My beloved son, colony life is disastrous. It ruins the soul...as
it ruins the body."&mdash;From the way they looked at him, as this
was said, he saw that they found him unnaturally withered&mdash;old
for his age. Still, his greying temples and wrinkled brows touched
them little. compared with the burning question whether he had come
home in time to save this soul of his alive. For they were even
more deeply rapt than of old in the mysteries and ecstasies of
religion. On its conduct they lavished their remaining vitality;
while the mother faith, which flourished so abundantly around them,
supplied them with an outlet for the bitter hatred which life's
hardships had engendered in them. Popery was an invention of the
Arch-Fiend; its priests were the "men of sin." &mdash;To Mahony,
who had learnt to regard all sects and denominations as branches of
the one great tree, such an attitude was intolerable.</p>

<p>He stayed with them but for three days; longer he could not have
borne the lifeless atmosphere of his old home. But...seventeen
years, and for three days! There was, however, another reason.
Their poverty was such that it wrung his heart to have to watch
their shifts and makeshifts. In this big house not a single servant
moved; his sisters' thin, elderly hands were hard and seamy with
work. The two women rose at daybreak to clean the steps and polish
the knocker. Themselves they washed and ironed the finely darned
damask; kept bright the massive bits of silver, than which there
was little else on the oval surface of a dinner-table built to seat
a score of people. They did their scanty shopping in distant
neighbourhoods where they were not known, creeping out with their
baskets early in the morning, while others of their class were
still between the sheets. No! the food they set before him stuck in
his throat; it was so much taken from them, who looked so
bloodless. Yet, though he grudged himself each mouthful, he did not
dare either to refuse what was offered him, or to add to it by a
gift of money or eatables&mdash;anything that might have shown them
he saw how matters stood. Banknotes slipped, unmentioned, into a
letter from far Australia had been a different thing. These could
be politely ignored&mdash;as indeed they had always remained
unacknowledged. He imagined the fine gesture with which his mother
let them flutter through her fingers, in saying airily to Sophy and
Lucinda: "Some nonsense of poor Richard's!" He ventured no more
than to buy her a bouquet of cut flowers and a vellum-bound book of
devotions. Even hothouse grapes might have exuded a utilitarian
flavour. But all he felt went into his gift; and he knew just the
nerve in the proud old heart that would be satisfied by it. For
though he did not warm to them, yet like spoke to like, blood to
blood, directly they met again. He could read their private
thoughts, their secret feelings. At a glance he saw through the
inventions and excuses, the tricks and stratagems with which they
bolstered up their lives; while yet retaining their dignity as
great ladies. Again, the flashes of mordant humour, which not your
godliest Irishman can ever wholly subdue; or the sudden, caustic,
thumb-nail sketch of friend or foe: these were so familiar to him
as to seem his own: while the practical Irish habit of stripping
things of false sentiment was homely and refreshing. Thus, with
regard to Mary's childlessness, his mother queried briskly: "Has
fretted for lack of a family? Nonsense! In such a climate she was
much better without." Again: "Her relatives will miss you. No doubt
they placed great faith in your skill. Besides, your visits cost
them nothing." Or her description of a neighbour's state as: "A
demi-fortune &mdash;cab and one horse!"</p>

<p>Many were the inquiries made after Mary, the regrets expressed
at her absence; but he in his heart (as probably they in theirs)
felt relieved that she had not accompanied him. For Mary would
certainly have put her foot in it. There would have been no keeping
out of her face the pity she burned with; she would have made
presents where presents were an injury; have torn down veils that
were sacred, even between the women themselves; would, in short,
have come hopelessly to grief amid the shoals and quicksands
through which it was necessary to steer a course. Whereas to him
the task was second nature. He took leave of them without regret.
Once away, however, he was conscious of a feeling of something like
guilt towards them. For he understood now, only too plainly, what
the withdrawal of the ninety to a hundred pounds yearly, which in
his later, palmy days he had been able to allow them-what the
abrupt stoppage of this sum must have meant to them. It had no
doubt made all the difference between comparative ease and their
present dire poverty. Yet never by so much as a word had they
hinted at this. There was surely something great about them,
too&mdash;for all their oddity.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Did this experience give him the sensation of a dream in which
he, who was alive, went down among those who had ceased to live,
his return to Edinburgh and its well-known scenes had exactly the
opposite effect: made <i>him</i> feel like a shade permitted to
revisit the haunts of men. For here was life in all its pristine
vigour, life bubbling hot from the source&mdash;and aeons divided
him from it. Here he found again his own youth&mdash;eager,
restless, passionate-though encased now in other forms. Other keen
young spirits swept from hospital to theatre, and from theatre to
lecture-room, as he once had done; and were filled to the brim,
they, too, with high purpose and ambition. Never before had it been
made so clear to him of what small worth was the individual: of
what little account the human moulds in which this life-energy was
cast. Momentous alone was the presence of the great Breath: the
eternal motor impulse. Each young soul had its hour, followed a
starry trail, dreamed a kingship; then passed&mdash;vanishing in
the ranks of the mediocre, the disillusioned, the
conquered&mdash;to make room for the new company of aspirants
thronging on behind. Many of these lads would, no doubt, in looking
back, find as little in their lives to feel proud of as he found in
his: nothing accomplished of all they now so surely anticipated.
And one or other of them might also, when his time came, hover as
an elderly ghost, eyed with a flagrant curiosity by this insolently
young throng&mdash;how contemptuously would not he himself in old
days have stared at the apparition!&mdash;hover round the
precincts, the real old middle-aged hack, returned for a glimpse at
the scenes of his youth.&mdash;Such were his feelings, the
experience being one that drove his years home to him with a cruel
stab.</p>

<p>The result was, he fell into an elegiac mood; and not having
Mary at his elbow to nudge his attention to realities, he let day
after day slip by without calling on, or otherwise making himself
known to distinguished members of the profession. He shirked the
necessary explanations. The one attempt he did make turned out
poorly. Spelt, too, a good dose of patronage for this untrumpeted
doctor from the backwoods.</p>

<p>To Mary he wrote: "I do not see much advancement in physick."
But this was in self-excuse. Of a truth new ideas were in the air.
The shining lights of his own day, now but a pair of crabbed old
invalids, waited each for his mortal release. The man of the
hour&mdash;or so rumour had it &mdash;was a young surgeon in
Glasgow; which "Godforsaken" city British and foreign physicians
were actually travelling to and settling in, to see demonstrated a
new means for hindering germ-putrefaction. At first he himself
inclined to side with his old chief, who turned a cold shoulder on
young Lister and his experimenting. But after reading up the
subject in the Medical Library he changed his mind. Pasteur's
theory of the existence of certain spores in the atmosphere might
not yet be proved to every one's satisfaction; but the examples
published by this Dr. Lister, illustrating the successful
employment of the new method, could not but make a deep impression.
In the end, he would for two pins have taken rail himself to
Glasgow, where in even the most insanitary hospital wards pyaemia,
erysipelas and hospital gangrene had been well nigh stamped
out.</p>

<p>It was while he still lingered, ruminating these things, that he
saw advertised for sale a practice on the south coast of England,
in a locality which was described as lovely, sheltered, salubrious.
Something in the wording of the paragraph took his fancy and he
wrote for particulars. The reply was so favourable that, instead of
either travelling to Glasgow or going back to Leicester, he set out
by way of Bristol for the south. To see the place was straightway
to lose his heart to it; here, for once was a dream come true. The
advertiser turned out to be as young as Brocklebank had been
old&mdash;a practitioner of but a year's standing. But to the hardy
old surgeon as a reed to an oak. For even the soft air of this
sheltered nook had not been mild enough for a congenital
throat-weakness; and the young man was hieing him to the Cape,
where he proposed to settle. Such was his eagerness to be gone that
he came a considerable way to meet Mahony in the matter of
price.&mdash;And now letters passed and telegrams flew between
husband and wife; till, even the electric wire proving too
circumstantial for Richard's impatience, Mary was bidden to pack
her bag and join him there. She came, and was herself charmed with
the spot &mdash;as, indeed, how could she help being, cried
Richard, who was as elated as a child. You might search England
through, and not find its equal.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty was to get a house. Young Philips, as a
bachelor, had lived in furnished apartments; which of course was
impossible for them. But it was literally a case of Hobson's
choice. For most people owned their houses&mdash;had been born and
would die in them like their fathers before them&mdash;and in all
the place only two were vacant. One was of a type that disfigures
many a seaside town: a high, gloomy house &mdash;in a terrace of
three&mdash;standing right on the pavement of a side street. With
no garden of its own, it was darkened by the foliage of the big
trees in the gardens opposite. Still worse, it turned its back on
the sea. A lawyer had lived there; the ground-floor windows bore
the hated shades. His widow, planning to move from the
neighbourhood, was willing to let the house on lease. But Mahony
took a furious dislike to it; and even Mary thought it dull, and
rather large for the two of them. The second, much smaller and
older&mdash;some hundred and fifty years, said report&mdash;was, on
the other hand, bright and cheerful, and had a charming old-world
garden and a magnificent view across the Bay. But it was for sale.
Nor was the position it occupied so suitable as that of the
lawyer's: it stood above the town, half-way up a steep hill. Still,
distances were surely negligible, argued Mahony, in so small a
place; and whoever really needed a doctor would summon him, whether
it meant fifty yards further or no.</p>

<p>None the less the decision cost him his sleep of a night. Mary
was all in favour of the one to be rented: his inclinations leaned
to the other. He walked past this a dozen times a day, and went
over it so often that the agent suggested him keeping the keys
until he had made up his mind. It was ridiculous, he told himself,
to think of buying a house before he had sampled the practice; yet
seldom had he been so torn. And once again Mary, pitying his
distraction, came to the rescue and said, well, after all, perhaps
he should just buy and be done with it. For she saw what would
happen if he didn't: he would never cease to bemoan his loss, and
to find fault with the house he was in. Better for his peace of
mind that he should take the monetary risk&mdash;and though this
meant using up the last remainder of their available ready money.
But there was also another unspoken thought at the back of Mary's
mind. The knowledge that he had thus involved himself might help
him to sit firm, if&mdash;and with a person like Richard the
contingency <i>had</i> to be allowed for&mdash;if he afterwards
tired of the place.</p>

<p>So he bought; and not for a second had he regretted it&mdash;any
more than he regretted having pitched his tent in this loveliest of
spots. On the contrary he counted himself a remarkably lucky
man.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>And thus to Buddlecombe.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-5" id="ch-2-1-5"></a>Chapter V</h3>

<p>The practice bore out its reputation. The huckster, the publican
and the ostler were in the minority here; Mahony's visiting-list
was studded with good names. This change for the better, together
with the pride he took in his pretty house and garden, sent his
spirits up sky-high. And, as was natural, he read his own
satisfaction into others. "If I'm not much mistaken, Mary, people
here are well pleased to have a medical man of a reasonable age in
their midst again." It fell to Mary to keep him gently damped; to
prevent him skipping off the earth altogether, in his new-found
lightness of heart.</p>

<p>At first, though, even she had to admit there was nothing to
complain of.</p>

<p>For if Mahony here felt himself restored to his own level
professionally, on the social side&mdash;which was important,
too&mdash;things also promised to run smoothly. Of course, English
people were notoriously slow to take you to their hearts; and, even
after they had found out all about you, would still go walking
round you looking you up and down. Once, however, these sticklers
were sure with whom they had to deal, they made rich amends. And so
Mary had numerous callers of the right kind; and invitations
followed the calls. The vicar's wife took her up&mdash;a due
appearance at church having been made, and a pew hired&mdash;and
she joined a circle that sat twice a week to sew for the heathen.
Further, she was asked to help in visiting and distributing tracts
among the lower orders; in getting up a Penny Reading to raise
funds for the promulgation of the Gospel; to take a table at the
annual Sunday School Feast: was, in short, made free of all the
artless diversions of the parish.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the month was April; and the thousand and
one beauties of an exceptionally fine spring unrolled before their
eyes. Declared Mahony: to be present at this budding and bursting,
this sprouting and flowering, more than made up for the
disappointments he had suffered since landing in England. What a
feast of tender green, of changing colours, was here spread for
eyes sore with the harshness and aridity of the Australian
landscape, the eternal grey-green of its skimpy foliage! When he
first arrived, every sheltered slope and sunny bank was yellow with
primroses; the lesser celandine bedecked the meadow-grass, violets
were mauve and purple in the hedgerows; and no sooner did these
show signs of fading than the ground became blue with myriads of
bells, which, taken in the mass, looked like patches of sky dropped
to earth. And the blue in its turn yielded to the ruby-pink of the
red campion. Against a background of starry blackthorn blazed the
golden gorse. The cliffs were covered with the comical little
striped brown pokers of the horsetails, which soon branched out
into bristly brooms; and piercing the rust-red carpet of last
year's growth, up sprang the straight nimble spears of the bracken.
In the high hedges the ruddy cane of the willows was smothered by
the succulent green tips of hawthorn and bramble; and on the
rolling countryside that belle of trees, the larch, stood out among
the copperish buds of the beeches and the first tightly folded
leaves of the chestnuts, with a pale green feathery loveliness all
its own.</p>

<p>But with the onset of summer, when gardeners were busy netting
strawberry-beds and currant-bushes against the greedy thrush; and
the blackbird, his wooing done, was omitting the topnotes at the
end of his call: by this time, in spite of Mahony's liking for the
moderate but sympathetic practice, sly doubts had begun to invade
him whether things were really at bottom as satisfactory as they
seemed, or whether both in his professional and their twofold
social life, there was not a fly in the ointment. In his own case,
the suspicion soon deepened to a certainty.&mdash;Robinson was that
fly.</p>

<p>Of the person who bore his name he had naturally heard nothing
at the time of buying. Only by degrees did Robinson come within his
ken. A surgeon some years his junior, the fellow had originally, it
now turned out, held the whole practice of the place for miles
round in his hands. Then, three years previously, he had married a
rich widow&mdash;report credited her with eight to ten thousand a
year&mdash;bought a fine property and retired. Since
then&mdash;again according to rumour&mdash;he had spent more time
than was fitting in the company of the bottle. However that might
be, his former wide professional connection, his wife's money and
social standing, combined to make him <i>persona grata</i> in all
the best houses; while among the townspeople and villagers, slow of
wit and opposed to change as only English country-people could be,
the memory, or rather the habit of him, had persisted, to the
tribulation no doubt of his successors. For there came moments when
Mahony mistrusted the throat-weakness alleged by young Philips; or
at least wondered whether this was his sole reason for quitting so
promising a place after a bare year's trial. And who had preceded
Philips? At first what he, Mahony, had to meet was no more than a
casual mention of Robinson's name. "Mr. Robinson said this, or
would have done that"; and, at the outset, he had been simple
enough to believe it a slip of the tongue for Philips. He soon
learned better. A question put, a scrap of gossip retailed by Mary,
taught him that Robinson was still a power in the place. For yet a
while, however, he ascribed what was going on to hard-dying custom,
which might be overcome. The first time he scented actual danger
was when one of two spinsters he was attending complained of her
sister's slow progress, and said she would ask Mr. Robinson to look
in, he understanding their constitutions better than any one
else.</p>

<p>"If you do that, my good woman, you see no more of me!" was
Mahony's quick retort. And so he lost a patient.</p>

<p>Thereafter on his rounds he himself began to catch glimpses of
the bottle-nosed surgeon&mdash;sitting perched in a high gig beside
a groom in livery; altogether a very smart turn-out&mdash;and this
went on until it positively looked as if the fellow intended taking
up practice again...filching it back from under his very nose. A
pretty thing that would be to happen, now he had staked his all on
it! A shabby trick and no mistake!&mdash;one, too, that ran counter
to every known rule of medical etiquette.</p>

<p>The mischief was&mdash;with a brain like his&mdash;let the door
open to one such suspicion, and straightway a dozen others seized
the chance of inserting themselves. He next fell to questioning the
apparent ease with which Mary and he had entered the polite society
of the town. For, the longer he lived there, the more plainly he
saw just what a wasps' nest of caste and prejudice they had fallen
into. Social life in Buddlecombe was the most complicated affair
under the sun: was divided into innumerable grades; made up of a
series of cliques, rising one above the other and fitting as
exactly as a set of Japanese boxes. No such simple matter, and that
was a fact, for a pair of newcomers to find themselves to rights in
it. But they in their ignorance had pranced boldly in, where those
who knew better, walked warily and with discretion. The vicar's
wife had taken Mary up: yes; but by now Mahony had come to see that
she would be equally attentive to any one who might prove useful in
helping to run the parish, or in slaving for foreign missions. And
he began to doubt whether, often as Mary went to the vicarage, she
was invited to the really select parties there given. She had
never, for instance, met the Blakeneys of "The Towers," people he
knew to be hand-in-glove with the vicaress. Mary either did not
notice or, noticing, heed such trivial details she just laughed and
said: "Rubbish!" or "You <i>are</i> fanciful, Richard!"&mdash;but
he most emphatically did, and thanked you for being put off with
the second best. And besides her insensitiveness to slights, she
was hopelessly obtuse when it came to observing the invisible but
cast-iron barriers with which the various cliques hedged themselves
round, to keep those a step lower in the scale from coming too
near.</p>

<p>"Not shake hands with that nice old Mr. Dandy just because he
was once in trade? I never heard such a thing!" In Ballarat Mary
had been used to feel flattered did her grocer&mdash;rich,
influential, a trustee of the church, a member of the Horticultural
Society&mdash;emerge from behind the counter specially to chat with
her. "I think we should just make a beginning."</p>

<p>"Indeed and you'll put your foot in it with a vengeance, my
dear, if you try anything of that kind here...when I'm still
struggling to get a stand."</p>

<p>"Oh well, of course, if you look at it that way...But all the
same...when I think..." Her sentence tailed off into a speaking
silence.</p>

<p>He understood. "<i>Tempi passati</i>, love! Nowadays, we must do
as Rome does. &mdash;Recollect, too, my dear, these things may seem
trifling enough to you...and me...who have knocked about the world;
but to people here they're the very A B C of good
breeding&mdash;have been sucked in with their mother's milk. We
mustn't let ourselves appear ignoramuses of the first water."</p>

<p>"But I've <i>got</i> to be friendly with your patients, Richard,
whoever they are."</p>

<p>"True. But even you must draw the line somewhere, you know."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't; I'm not clever enough. It doesn't seem
human either. For we're all the same flesh and blood."</p>

<p>Yes, for the countless niceties and distinctions of social
etiquette, Mary had, as she confessed, little aptitude. It
sometimes seemed that, if a mistake was possible, she made it.</p>

<p>The two chief houses in Buddlecombe, the "Hall" and the "Court,"
were closed when the Mahonys settled there, the families being
respectively abroad and in residence in London. During their
absence the temporary leader, who gave the sign and set the key,
and to whom the vicar deferred with his treacliest smile, was the
owner of "Toplands." This was a Mrs. Challoner, a widow with two
sons, and a person of great wealth and importance&mdash;"Toplands"
was really the biggest and most up-to-date place in the
neighbourhood, both Hall and Court being cramped by comparison and
mouldy with age. But let the Trehernes or the Saxeby-Corbetts show
so much as the tips of their noses, and this lady subsided with
extraordinary swiftness, collapsed like a jack-in-the-box; for,
though her husband's antecedents were irreproachable, there was, on
her own side, some shadowy connection with "malt" which could never
be forgotten or forgiven her; or at least "only by the grace of
God...or of the Saxeby-Corbetts."</p>

<p>Mrs. Challoner was a member of the vicarage sewing-circle; and
here she met Mary, to whom she seemed to take a liking; for she
called, asked her to "Toplands," and, as a special mark of favour,
drove her out in her carriage; Mahony being simultaneously summoned
to attend the younger of the two sons, a delicate lad of seventeen.
Thus, when, in Mary's opinion, the time had come to return the
various invitations they had received, by herself sending out cards
for a party, she felt justified in including Mrs. Challoner. And,
sure enough, had in reply a graceful note of acceptance. So far
good. But now it was that Mary let her hospitable impulses outride
her discretion. At the vicarage she had made a further
acquaintance, in the shape of a Mrs. Johnston-Perkes, a very
charming lady who had been settled in Buddlecombe not much longer
than they themselves. And having it from this person's own lips
that she came of a good Oxfordshire family, besides meeting her
where she did&mdash;Mrs. Dandy, for example, was not made free of
the sewing-club&mdash;how was Mary to guess that the
Johnston-Perkes were not "in the swim"? Nor could Richard have
helped her. For the dark fact, unknown to either, was that in his
day the husband's father had had some Connection with a publishing
firm; and though Mr. Perkes himself had never soiled his hands
thus, yet the business stigma &mdash;pray, did not the issuing of
books imply the abhorred counter?&mdash;clung to him and his
lady-wife and tracked them from place to place. What followed
proved&mdash;according to Mahony&mdash;that, though good enough for
God and His works&mdash;witness the lady's presence at the
vicarage!&mdash;the Johnston-Perkes were not by any means good
enough for the upper crust of Buddlecombe; and the consequence was,
Mary's party was a failure. There was no open contretemps; Mrs.
Challoner and her satellites behaved with perfect civility. But it
was impossible, to Mahony's mind, to misread the crippling surprise
writ big on these people's faces; and the atmosphere of the
drawing-room remained icy&mdash;would not thaw.</p>

<p>Another thing that sent people's eyebrows up was the supper to
which Mary sat them down as the clock struck ten. At this date she
had not been long enough in Buddlecombe to know it for an
unalterable rule that, unless the invitation was to dinner, a
heavy, stodgy dinner of one solid course after another, from which,
if you happened to be a peckish eater, you rose feeling as though
you could never look on food again; except in this case, the
refreshment offered was of the lightest and most genteel: a
biscuit; a jug of barley-water for the gouty, or lemon-water for
the young&mdash;at most, a glass of inferior sherry, cellars not
being tapped to any extent on such occasions. But Mary had gone at
her supper in good old style, giving of her best. And Mahony was so
used to leaving such matters entirely to her that it had never
entered his head to inferfere. Not until the party was squeezed
into the little dining-room, round a lengthened dinner-table on
which jellies twinkled, cold fowls lay trussed, sandwiches were
piled loaf-high&mdash;not till then and till he saw the amazed
glances flying between the ladies, did he grasp how wrong Mary had
gone. A laden supper-table was an innovation: and who were these
newcomers, hailing from God knew where, to attempt to improve on
the customs of Buddlecombe? It was also a trap for the
gouty&mdash;and all were gouty more or less. Thirdly, such
profusion constituted a cutting criticism on the meagre
refreshments that were here the rule. He grew stiff with
embarrassment; felt, if possible, even more uncomfortable than did
poor Mary, at the refusals and head-shakings that went down one
side of the table and up the other. For none broke more than the
customary Abernethy, or crumpled a sandwich. Liver-wings and slices
of breast, ham patties and sausage-rolls made the round, in vain.
Mrs. Challoner gave the cue; and even the vicar, a hearty eater,
followed her lead, the only person to indulge being the worthy
gentleman who had caused half the trouble&mdash;and <i>him</i>
Mahony caught being kicked by his wife under the table.</p>

<p>He felt so sore on Mary's behalf that, by the time he had
escorted the last guest through the sentry-box porch, he was fairly
boiling over. Flinging downstairs to the dining-room, where he
found his wife disconsolately regarding her table&mdash;it looked
almost as neat as when she first arranged it&mdash;he flashed out:
"Well, you've done it now! What in heaven's name possessed you to
sit people down to a spread like this?"</p>

<p>Mary had begun to collect her tartlets&mdash;dozens of
them&mdash;on one large dish, and was too preoccupied to lend him
more than half an ear. To herself she said: "What <i>shall</i> I do
with them?"</p>

<p>"Do? Bury 'em, my dear, in a corner of the garden&mdash;hide 'em
away out of sight! I wish you could get the memory out of people's
minds as easily. <i>our</i> supper-party will be the talk of
Buddlecombe for many a day to come!"</p>

<p>"Just because I tried to make it as nice as I knew how? I think
you judge every one by yourself, Richard. Because you didn't enjoy
it..."</p>

<p>"Then why was nothing touched?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they didn't feel hungry. I oughtn't to have had it till
an hour later."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort! Though you had given it to 'em at five in
the morning, they would still have walked home on empty stomachs.
This kind of thing isn't done here, and the sooner you get that
into your head the better!"</p>

<p>"Never will I descend to their starvation-diet!" cried Mary
warmly.</p>

<p>"Another thing: what in heaven's name induced you to mix those
Perkeses up with Mrs. Challoner and her set? That was <i>faux
pas</i> of the first water."</p>

<p>"I do declare I never seem to do anything right! But you said
nothing: you didn't know. For if it comes to that, Richard, you
make mistakes, too."</p>

<p>"Indeed and I should like to know how?"&mdash;Mahony was huffed
in a second.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to say anything about it. But it appears the
vicar took it very badly, the other Sunday, that you went to hear
that London preacher at the Methodist Chapel. I overheard something
that was said at the last sewing-party&mdash;about your perhaps
being really a dissenter."</p>

<p>"Well, of all the...objects to my going to hear a well-known
preacher, just because he belongs to another sect?
Preposterous!"</p>

<p>"Yes, if it's anything to do with yourself, it's preposterous.
But when it's me, it's mistakes, and <i>faux pas</i>, and all the
rest of it. Sometimes I really feel quite confused. To remember I
mustn't shake hands here or even bow there. That in some quarters I
must only say 'Good afternoon,' and not 'How do you do?'&mdash;and
then the other way round as well. That nice Mrs. Perkes is not the
thing and ought to be cold-shouldered; and when I have company I'm
not to give them anything to eat. Oh, Richard, it all seems to me
such <i>fudge!</i> How grown-up people can spend their lives being
so silly, I don't know. Out <i>there</i>, you had to forget what a
person's outside was like&mdash;I mean his table-manners and
whether he could say his aitches&mdash;as long as he got on and was
capable...or rich. But here it's always: '<i>Who</i> is he? How far
back can he trace his pedigree?'&mdash;and nothing else seems to
matter a bit. I do believe you might be friends with a swindler or
a thief, as long as his family-tree was all right. And the disgrace
trade seems to be! Why, looked at this way there wasn't any one in
Ballarat who was fit to know. Just think of Tilly and old Mr.
Ocock. Here they would be put down as the vulgarest of the vulgar.
One certainly wouldn't be able even to <i>bow</i> to them! And then
remember all they were to us, and how fond I was of Tilly, and what
a splendid character she had. No, this kind of thing goes against
the grain in me. I'm afraid the truth is, I like them vulgar best.
And I'm too old, now, to change."</p>

<p>"You too old!" cried Mahony, amazed to hear this, his own dirge,
on his wife's lips. "Why, Mary love,"&mdash;and from where he sat
he held out his hand to her across the table, over the creams and
jellies standing like flowers in their cups. "You but a couple of
months over thirty, and far and away the best-looking woman in the
place! Candidly, my dear, never did I set eyes on such a pack of
scarecrows&mdash;from the vicaress with her wolf's teeth, up the
scale and down."</p>

<p>"You don't feel very happy or at home here, love&mdash;I see
that," he went on. "And I sometimes doubt, my dear, whether I did
right to uproot you from your adopted country."</p>

<p>"I certainly liked being there better than here. Still I'm quite
ready, as you know, to put up with things. Only you mustn't scold
me, Richard, when I make mistakes I do my best, dear, but..."</p>

<p>"We'll lay our heads together, love, and so avoid them. And as a
beginning, Mary, we'll stifle the natural feelings of friendliness
and goodwill we have always had for our fellow-mortals&mdash;no
matter what their rank in life. We'll forget that we're all, as you
say, the sons of Adam, and are placed on this earth-ball but for a
very brief period, in which it would certainly be to our advantage
to love our neighbours as ourselves. And we'll learn to be narrow,
and bigoted, and snobbish, and mean with our grub...eh, Mary?
Joking apart, my dear, you see how it is. We've either got to adapt
ourselves to the petty outlook of those about us, or be regarded as
a pair of boors who've brought home with them the manners and
habits of the backwoods. And that means turning out again, love.
For I won't stay here to be looked down on...when I feel every whit
as good as anybody else."</p>

<p>"Now when you talk like that, Richard...You know I'm willing to
put up with any mortal thing, as long as I can feel sure you're
happy and contented. But when I think, dear, of the down <i>you</i>
used to have on narrowness and snobbishness...And this is even
worse."</p>

<p>"All the same, I felt I could stand no more of the rough
diamonds we had to hobnob with out there."</p>

<p>"Still, some were diamonds, weren't they?"</p>

<p>"What we need, you and I, Mary, is a society that would take the
best from both sides. The warm-heartedness of our colonial friends,
their generosity and hospitality; while we could do without the
promiscuity, the worship of money, the general loudness and want of
refinement.&mdash;You wonder if I shall be happy here? I like the
place, love; it's an ideal spot. I like this solid old house, too:
and so far the climate has suited me. I seem to be getting on
fairly well with the people; and though the practice is still
nothing extraordinary, it has possibilities."</p>

<p>"Yes; but..."</p>

<p>"But? Well, I undoubtedly miss the income I used to have;
there's little money to be made&mdash;compared with Ballarat, it's
the merest niggling. And besides that, there was a certain breadth
of view&mdash;that we'd got used to, you and I. Here, things
sometimes seem atrociously cramped and small. But we must remember
good exists everywhere and in every one, wife, if we only take the
trouble to look for it. And since the fates have pitched us here,
here we must stay and work our vein until we've laid the gold bare.
We've got each other, love, and that's the chief thing."</p>

<p>"Of course it is."</p>

<p>And now they were up and doing, he helping her to stow away her
feast that it should not meet Selina's eye in the morning. And over
this there was a good deal of merriment: they had to eat up some of
the more perishable things themselves, which they did to a
confession from Mary that she really had not meant to make
<i>quite</i> so much, but had been lured on from one thing to
another, by the thought of how nice it would look on the table.
They packed away a decent amount in the larder, for appearance
sake; the rest in a cupboard in the surgery.</p>

<p>But afterwards, Mary as she took down her hair, Mahony as he
went round the house locking up, each dedicated the matter a
further and private refection. She said to herself, astonished: "I
do believe Richard is turning radical," and then went on to muse, a
little wryly, that the "fates" to which he so jauntily referred
were, after all, but another name for his own caprices. He, on the
other hand, after justifying an omission to himself with: "No use
worrying the poor little soul about that dam fool Robinson!" sent
her a thought so warm that it resembled a caress. For at heart his
whole sympathy was with Mary and Mary's ineradicable generosity.
Alone, and his irritation cooled, he ranged himself staunchly on
her side, against the stiff, uncharitable little world into which
they were fallen.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-6" id="ch-2-1-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>Entering the house late one summer afternoon, his pockets bulged
with scraps of weed and wild-flower&mdash;the country people still
gaped at sight of their doctor descended from his trap, a round
glass in one eye, poking and prying in the hedgerows&mdash;Mahony
was turning these specimens out on the hall table when Mary called
to him from the dining-room. "Richard! A great surprise!"</p>

<p>He went downstairs to her, pulling off his gloves. "What?...the
mail in already? I calculated it wasn't due for another week at
least."</p>

<p>"And such a big one!"</p>

<p>Mary sat in an armchair, her lap full of envelopes, a closely
written sheet of foreign note in her hand. Mahony picked up the
several letters bearing his name, and ran his eye over the
superscriptions. Their English post-bag was a lean one; but the
arrival of the Australian mail more than atoned for it; and the
deciphering of the crossed and recrossed pages, the discussing of
news from the old home occupied the pair of them for days. Among
his pile Mahony found a letter from Chinnery of the London
Chartered, another from Archdeacon Long, a third from an old
fellow-practitioner; while a bulky envelope promised a full
business statement from the agent whom he had left in charge of his
affairs. Taking off his greatcoat he sat down to read at his
ease.</p>

<p>First, though, he had to hear from Mary the gist of those she
had fleetly skimmed, prior to going back and reading them over
again, word by word, with a brooding seriousness.</p>

<p>"Just fancy, John writes he's been forced to shut up his house
and go and live at the Melbourne Club. <i>What</i> a state of
things! That lovely house left to go to rack and ruin. It seems the
last housekeeper turned out worst of all. She didn't set her cap at
him, like Mrs. Perry, but he discovered that she was carrying on
improperly with men. To think of a woman like that looking after
poor Jinny's children! Now John has put all three to
boarding-school. And Josey still the merest baby. How he expects
them to thrive, I don't know&mdash;with never a proper home, or a
mother's care. Then, here's Trotty...or Emma as he will persist in
calling her...accused of being idle and flighty. Trotty flighty! If
ever there was a dear, good-hearted little soul...easy to manage
and open as the day. But John still seems to have his old down on
Emma's children. And that brings me to some bad news. Johnny has
run away. Listen to this.</p>

<p>"AND NOW I PASS TO THE DOINGS OF MY SON AND HEIR. AFTER KEEPING
THE BOY TO HIS DESK UNDER MY OWN EYE FOR THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS,
AND ENDEAVOURING BY PRECEPT AND SEVERITY TO MAKE AN HONEST MAN OF
HIM&mdash;IN VAIN, MARY, FOR NEVER A MOMENT'S GRATIFICATION OR
SATISFACTION HAVE I HAD FROM HIM; NEVER A THANK-YOU HAS HE GIVEN ME
FOR ALL THE MONEY SPENT ON HIM&mdash;HE WAS LAZY, DECEPTIVE, AND
FREQUENTED LOOSE COMPANY...Richard! At seventeen!...NEGLECTED HIS
DUTIES, TOOK MORE WINE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM, PLAYED CARDS FOR
MONEY, AND IN THE END WENT SO FAR AS TO ABSTRACT HIS LOSSES FROM MY
PRIVATE DRAWER.&mdash;Isn't it dreadful?&mdash;WHEN I TAXED HIM
WITH IT, AND THREATENED HIM WITH EXPOSURE, HE AS GOOD AS WHISTLED
IN MY FACE; THEN ACTUALLY HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASSERT HE OWED ME NO
GRATITUDE, SINCE I HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING FOR HIM; AND THE NEXT
MORNING HE WAS MISSING&mdash;HIS BED HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT IN. WHEN
AFTER THE LAPSE OF SEVERAL WEEKS I CONTRIVED TO TRACK HIM, I
LEARNED, TO MY SHAME AND DISGRACE, THAT HE HAD SHIPPED BEFORE THE
MAST TO THAT ELDORADO OF THIEVES AND SCOUNDRELS, AMERICA. NOW HE
MAY SHIFT FOR HIMSELF; I WASH MY HANDS OF HIM. I HAVE CUT HIM OUT
OF MY WILL AND SHALL DO THE SAME BY EMMA, UNLESS SHE MENDS HER
WAYS. YOU WILL SCARCELY CREDIT IT, MY DEAR MARY, BUT HER
SCHOOLMISTRESS WRITES ME THAT THE GIRL&mdash;NOT YET FIFTEEN YEARS
OF AGE, MARK YOU!&mdash;HAS HAD TO BE 'PUBLICLY REBUKED' FOR
COQUETTING WITH MEMBERS OF THE OTHER SEX IN A PLACE OF
WORSHIP.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, stuff and nonsense, John! Never will I believe such a thing
of Trotty. I know the child a great deal better than you. If I were
only there, to find out what it all means He winds up with the
usual: THANK GOD, JANE'S CHILDREN ARE OF ANOTHER DISPOSITION. I AM
CONFIDENT I SHALL NEVER BE DISGRACED BY THEM. No, my dear John,
they haven't the spirit. But...well, I never did!" and Mary let her
hand fall flop on the table. "Just listen to this! A
postscript&mdash;I didn't see it before. He says: YOUR SISTER ZARA
SEEMS ABOUT TO MAKE A FOOL OF THE FIRST WATER OF HERSELF. SHE IS, I
HEAR&mdash;FOR I HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF HER, I AM THANKFUL TO
SAY&mdash;CONTEMPLATING MATRIMONY.&mdash;Richard! And he doesn't
even say who to. Isn't that like a man? Can it...could it be...But
there! I believe I saw a letter from Zara herself."</p>

<p>Dropping John's, Mary picked on one of the envelopes in her lap,
slit it open and began to fly the lines. "Mm...a tirade against
John, of course...how those two do bicker! They seem to get worse
as they grow older. Now where can it be? Mm...NO ONE CAN PUT UP
WITH HIM ANY LONGER...HAS HAD TO CLOSE HIS HOUSE, THUS
PROVING&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hullo, my dear, here's news!" cried Mahony and slapped his
thigh. He had waited patiently for John's Jeremiad to end. In
Zara's pursuit of matrimony he took no interest whatever. "Well,
upon my word!...who would have dreamt of this? Those <i>Australia
Felixes</i>...you remember, Mary, I bought them rather as a pig in
a poke; and they've done nothing but make calls ever since. Now
here they are declaring a three-pound dividend. My highest
expectations did not exceed thirty shillings and even that would
have been handsome. Think what it will be when they get in ten more
stamps. Fifty pounds a month, for certain! My dear! we shall end by
being moneyed people after all."</p>

<p>"Indeed I hope so," said Mary; and resumed her search for Zara's
plum. "It looks as if she's not going to mention it. This is all
about her pupils. They dote on her as usual, and she drives out
every day in the carriage. Zara is certainly lucky in her
employers.&mdash;Oh, here it is&mdash;tucked away in a postscript.
OTHER AND FAIRER PROSPECTS BECKON, MY DEAR MARY, THAN THOSE OF
ETERNALLY IMPROVING THE MINDS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN. AT
PRESENT I CAN SAY NO MORE. BUT YOUR CLEVERNESS WILL NO DOUBT ENABLE
YOU TO DIVINE WHAT I LEAVE UNSAID. And that's all. Now I suppose I
must wait another three months to hear who it is and how it
happened. Oh dear, how <i>out</i> of everything we do seem
here!"</p>

<p>"They've got the money for the chancel at last," threw in
Mahony. "I must write and congratulate Long. Splendid work! They've
had the laying ceremony, too, and hope twelve months hence that the
Bishop will be up consecrating. The last Fancy Bazaar did the job.
Here's a message to you. Mrs. Long's warm love, and she missed your
help sadly at the refreshment-stall.&mdash;What? Well, I'm hanged!
Old Higgins in my place as Trustee. Ha, ha! Listen to this. AND NOW
AN ITEM, DOCTOR, AFTER YOUR OWN HEART. WE RECENTLY HAD WITH US A
DISCIPLE AND FOLLOWER OF SPURGEON&mdash;ONE OF THE FAITHFUL WHO
SECEDED WITH THE GREAT MAN FROM THE EVANGELICAL ALLIANCE. HE
PREACHED A FIRST TIME IN THE BAPTIST CHAPEL, BUT THIS PROVED TOO
SMALL TO HOLD A QUARTER OF THOSE WHO WISHED TO HEAR HIM. AND SO THE
SECOND TIME, ON A SUNDAY EVENING, HE APPEARED ON THE PLATFORM OF
THE NEW ALFRED HALL. THIS WAS PACKED TO THE DOORS. THE CONSEQUENCE
WAS I PREACHED TO EMPTY BENCHES. WELL! BELIEVING THAT THE WORD OF
GOD REMAINS THE WORD OF GOD, NO MATTER UNDER WHAT GUISE IT IS
PRESENTED, I CUT MY DISCOURSE SHORT, DOFFED MY CASSOCK AND WENT
HOME TO BED. THE WORTHY FELLOW CALLED ON ME NEXT DAY; WISHED TO
EXCHANGE BIBLES&mdash;HIS, I AM TOLD, DEEPLY UNDER-SCORED&mdash;BUT
I DID NOT FEEL JUSTIFIED IN GOING SO FAR AS THAT."</p>

<p>"Oh, Polly's lost her baby, poor thing!" cried Mary, whom the
doings of Spurgeon's follower interested but mildly. "I do feel
sorry for her. Not but what she takes it very sensibly. And if you
think...six children and that teeny-weeny house. Still, it's rather
sad. She says: OF COURSE NOBODY MISSES IT OR CARED ANYTHING ABOUT
IT BUT ME. BUT IT WAS RATHER A NICE LITTLE KID MARY, AND WELL
FORMED. I HAD IT AT THE BREAST FOR A DAY, AND FELT ITS LITTLE
FINGERS, AND IT HAD BLUE EYES. Now fancy that!&mdash;and the rest
of them so dark. Polly would think it belonged all the more to her,
because of it. She says Ned's keeping a little steadier&mdash;that
will be good news for Mother. He's clerk in a coal merchant's
office now, and brings home his wages pretty regularly. Poor old
Ned!" and Mary sighed.</p>

<p>But a message in Mr. Chinnery's made her smile. TELL MRS. MAHONY
HOW MUCH SHE IS MISSED IN SOCIETY HERE. THOSE PLEASANT EVENINGS WE
USED TO SPEND AT YOUR HOUSE, DOCTOR, AND HER FAMOUS SUPPERS ARE
STILL TALKED OF, AND WILL LONG BE REMEMBERED. "There, my dear!
that's a feather in your cap, and should console you for recent
happenings."</p>

<p>With this Mahony's budget was exhausted, and he rose to go to
the surgery, where he proposed to make a few calculations in
connection with his little windfall. But Mary held him back for yet
a moment.</p>

<p>"I declare marrying's in the air. Now here's Jerry gone and got
engaged. Who to? He writes: THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN ALL THE WORLD AND
THE BEST AS WELL. Let us only hope that's true. Dear old Jerry! He
deserves a good wife, if ever anyone did. But, oh dear me! she's
only sixteen&mdash;barely a year older than Trotty. That's too
young."</p>

<p>"Is it indeed? I know somebody who was once of a different
opinion."</p>

<p>"But I was old for my age. Dear Jerry! He's so sensible in other
things. If only he has not let his feelings run away with him
here!"</p>

<p>"Poor old Mary wife! If only you were there to look after them
all, eh? Better as it is, love. You'd have the burden of Atlas on
your shoulders again."</p>

<p>"What atlas?" asked Mary absently, having passed to her next
correspondent.</p>

<p>But the letter she spent longest over was the one she kept till
the last&mdash;till Richard had retired to his room. For only to
Tilly did she write nowadays with anything approaching frankness;
and in this reply, oddly written, indifferently spelt, there might
be private references to things she had said, besides the plain
truth about all and any it touched on. Afterwards Richard would
get, in her own words, all he needed to hear.</p>

<p>BEAMISH HOUSE,<br>
LAKE WENDOUREE,<br>
BALLARAT.</p>

<p>MY DARLING MARY,&mdash;YOURS OF 19TH WAS A RARE OLD TREAT. JOB
BROUGHT IT WHEN I WASN'T AT HOME&mdash;I'D DRIVEN OUT TO HAVE A
LOOK AT THE MARE ZOE, WHO'S IN FOAL AND AT GRASS IN A PADDOCK OF
WILLY URQUHART'S. DIDN'T I POUNCE ON IT WHEN I FOUND IT. I READ IT
THROUGH TWICE WITHOUT STOPPING, MY DEAR. AND DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER TO
BE GLAD OR SORRY WHEN I'D DONE. YOU WRITE CHEERY ENOUGH, MARY, BUT
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME YOU CAN BE REALLY HAPPY IN A PLACE LIKE YOU
SAY LEICESTER IS&mdash;ALL DAMP AND DREARY, AND NO GARDEN OR SPACE,
AND SO LITTLE COMPANY. I'M GLAD IT ISN'T ME &mdash;THAT'S ALL.
AUSTRALY FOR EVER, FOR THIS CHICKEN. YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE RAINY
SEASON MAKES ME GET COLD SHIVERS DOWN MY SPINE. GIVE ME THE SUN,
THANK YOU, AND HORSES AND A GARDEN, AND EVERYTHING JUST AS JOLLY AS
CAN BE. FINE FEATHERS AND BLUE BLOOD AREN'T IN MY LINE ANYHOW.</p>

<p>NOW FOR MY BUDGET. I'M STILL THE GAY OLD WIDDER I WAS WHEN YOU
HEARD LAST, AND HAVEN'T FELT TEMPTED TO CHANGE MY STATE. TO TELL
THE TRUTH, MARY, THOUGH I GAD ABOUT AS USUAL AND DON'T SIT AT HOME
AND PULL A LONG FACE, I STILL MISS DEAR OLD PA. IT WAS SO HOMEY TO
HEAR HIM SAY: "NOW THEN, WHAT'S MY GIRL BEEN UP TO TO-DAY?"
WHENEVER I CAME IN, AND THE JOY OF MY LIFE TO HELP HIM SET HIS WILL
AGAINST MONSEER H.'S. WELL, HE CAN'T SAY HE'S FORGOTTEN. I'VE PUT
HIM UP THE GRANDEST MONUMENT IN ALL THE NEW CEMETERY. PA IN A SORT
OF NIGHTSHIRT, MARY, WITH WINGS ATTACHED, FLYING OFF, AND A FEMALE
FIGURE ALL BOWED UP AND WEEPING ON THE GROUND. THIS IS ALL RIGHT
FOR ME, BUT SOMETIMES I THINK PA WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN TOOK JUST
SITTING ON A LOG AND SMOKING HIS PIPE. BUT HENRY AND THE MAN AS
DONE IT WOULDN'T HEAR OF SUCH A THING, SAID IT WOULDN'T BE
IDEEL.</p>

<p>THE CHIEF NEWS OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS THAT TOM AND JOHNNY HAS
MOVED OUT. I WAS FOR KEEPING THEM ON&mdash;WE'RE NONE OF US
CHICKENS ANY MORE&mdash;BUT HENRY PECKED AND NAGGED AT ME ABOUT
PROPRIETY, TILL I GAVE IN FOR SHEER PEACE SAKE. THEY'RE BOARDED
OUT, POOR BOYS, AND TOM COMES OVER EVERY MORNING TO SEE AFTER THE
FOWLS. ONE OF THESE DAYS I SHALL HAVE TO PUT MY FOOT DOWN AND
SQUASH HENRY&mdash;I SEE THAT. FOR IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE WEEDS.
PA USED TO SAY: "WEAR NO WEEPERS FOR ME, TILDA!"&mdash;MEANING
VEILS AND HANGERS AND ALL THAT&mdash;"YOU'VE NOTHING TO GRIEVE FOR,
OLD GIRL." AND I TO COMFORT HIM: "RIGHT YOU ARE, OLD JO! IF MY
MEMORY LASTS SO LONG, THAT IS, FOR YOU'LL BEAT METHUSELAH YET!" BUT
WHEN HENRY HEARD OF IT, HE ALL BUT STOOD ON HIS HEAD&mdash;MY DEAR,
HE HAS AGNES GOING ROUND WITH A FLOUNCE OF CREPE A YARD WIDE ON HER
SKIRTS. AND INDEED, MARY, I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE FACED WALKING
UP THE AISLE OF A SUNDAY WITHOUT A BLACK BONNET AND ALL COMPLETE;
THOUGH BETWEEN OURSELVES IT MAKES ME FEEL A PROPER CROW. DON'T
TELL, BUT WHEN I DRIVE OUT INTO THE BUSH I STUFF A SHADY OLD HAT IN
A BASKET UNDER THE SEAT, AND AS SOON AS I GET FAR ENOUGH, I OFF
WITH THE BONNET AND ON WITH THE HAT. THE WEEPERS DO DRAW THE FLIES
SO. AYE, AND FLIES OF ANOTHER COLOUR TOO, MARY, IF YOU'LL BELIEVE
ME. BUT THEY COME TO THE WRONG SHOP HERE; NONE OF YOUR LONG-NOSED
FORTUNE-SNUFFLERS FOR ME. AND THAT REMINDS ME&mdash;WHAT DO YOU
THINK HENRY'S LATEST IS? SAYS I OUGHT TO HAVE SOME ONE TO LIVE WITH
ME&mdash;THAT IT ISN'T COMMY FAUT FOR AN ATTRACTIVE YOUNG
WIDDER-WOMAN TO LIVE ALL ALONE! HA HA! DO YOU SEE ANY GREEN IN THIS
CHILD'S EYE? I THINK I CAN BE TRUSTED, DON'T YOU, MARY, TO LOOK
AFTER MYSELF. BUT I ENJOY KEEPING MOSSIEU HENRY ON THE QUAKE. WHAT
HE'S AFRAID OF IS THAT ALL I GOT FROM POOR OLD PA WON'T FALL TO HIS
AND AGNES'S KIDS WHEN I HOP THE TWIG. TALKING OF AGNES, I DON'T SEE
MILADI ONCE IN A BLUE MOON NOWADAYS. I HEAR SHE'S "NOT AT ALL
WELL." IT'S MY PRIVATE BELIEF SOMETHING'S WRONG THERE, MARY.
THEY'VE CHANGED DOCTORS THREE TIMES, TELL YOUR HUSBAND, SINCE HE
LEFT. LOUISE URQUHART'S PRESENTED HER HUSBAND WITH THE ELEVENTH.
HOW SHE KEEPS IT UP SO REGULAR BEATS ME. BUT THERE'S RUCTIONS IN
THAT FAMILY AT PRESENT. WILLY'S BEEN UNUSUAL GAY. THIS TIME IT WAS
A GOVERNESS, A REAL YOUNG SPARK THEY HAD UP TO YARANGOBILLY TO
TEACH THE KIDS.</p>

<p>SHE GOT BUNDLED OUT DOUBLE-QUICK AT THE END, AND WILLY'S LOOKED
MEEK AS A SUCKING-LAMB EVER SINCE. I DROP IN TO SEE NED'S POLLY NOW
AND AGAIN&mdash;YOU'VE HEARD I SUPPOSE SHE LOST HER LAST. AND A
GOOD THING TOO. SHE'S GOT MORE THAN SHE CAN MANAGE AS IT IS. I
HEARD FROM HER, YOUNG JERRY'S THE NEWEST CANDIDATE FOR THE HOLY
ESTATE. THEY DO SAY THE BRIDE ELECT STILL PLAYS WITH DOLLS. LOR,
MARY! WHAT WILL THESE INFANTS BE UP TO NEXT? ANOTHER PIECE OF NEWS
IS THAT THAT OBSTINATE OLD BRUTE IN MELBOURNE HAS GONE AND PUT ALL
POOR FINN'S BLESSED LITTLE NIPPERS TO BOARDING-SCHOOL. THAT DOES
HIT ME HARD, MARY. BUT I GET EVEN WITH HIM IN ANOTHER WAY, MY DEAR.
I'VE WON OVER THE OLD VINAIGRETTE HERE&mdash;SHE NEEDED NEW GLOBES,
ETC. FOR HER SCHOOLHOUSE&mdash;AND WE HAVE A KIND OF AGREEMENT, ALL
UNBEKNOWNST TO THE HONOURABLE, THAT THE KID TROTTY CAN COME HOME
WITH ME OF A SATURDAY AFTERNOON INSTEAD OF SPENDING THE DAY ON THE
BACKBOARD. SHE'S A NICE LITTLE KID, FULL OF LIFE, THOUGH YOUNG
ENOUGH FOR HER AGE, AND I TRY TO GIVE HER A GOOD TIME. BUT WHAT SHE
LIKES BEST IS TO MAKE BUTTER, SO I PIN AN APRON ON HER AND TURN HER
INTO THE DAIRY WITH MARTHA, AMONG THE MILK-PANS AND CHURNS. BUT LET
ME TELL YOU THIS, MY DEAR. THE HONOURABLE JOHN NEEDN'T INDULGE ANY
FOOL IDEAS ABOUT ECONOMISING IN HOUSEKEEPERS WHEN HER SCHOOLING'S
OVER&mdash;AS OLD PRUNES AND PRISMS TELLS ME. SOME ONE A GREAT DEAL
YOUNGER AND HANDSOMER THAN HIM WILL WHIP HER OFF. SHE'S MUCH TOO
PRETTY FOR THE SINGLE LIFE.</p>

<p>I THINK THAT'S ALL MY NEWS. WE HAD GREAT CHURCH FESTIFICATIONS
LATELY AND LOOK FORWARD TO MORE WHEN THE CHANCEL'S BUILT. I SAY,
THE DOCTOR HAD SOME "AUSTRALIA FELIXES," HADN'T HE? I HEAR THEY'VE
STRUCK THE REEF. BUT THIS IS A FEARFUL LONG SCRAWL, AND YET NOT
HALF SO COMFORTABLE AS EVEN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR'S GOOD YARN WOULD
BE. WHEN SHALL WE HAVE THAT AGAIN, MARY DARLING? I DON'T LOSE HOPES
FOR SOMEDAY. AND AS YOU KNOW I'VE SWORN NEVER TO CROSS THE WATER,
IT MUST MEAN THE OTHER WAY ABOUT. YES, I STILL BELIEVE I SHALL SEE
YOU BACK AGAIN: AND WHEN YOU DO COME, YOU'LL FIND YOU ARE NOT
FORGOTTEN BY YOUR DEVOTED OLD CRONY&mdash;TILLY.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-7" id="ch-2-1-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>The end of September brought day after day of soft, steamy
mists, which saturated everything with moisture, and by night fell
as a fine rain that turned low-lying parts of the garden to a bog.
Did you mount to the roads on the high level you were in the clouds
themselves; they trailed past you like smoke. There was no horizon
seaward. At a little distance from the shore the grey water became
one with a bank of vapour; the yellow cliffs vanished; suns neither
rose nor set.</p>

<p>It was exasperating weather. These eternal sea fogs, which never
a puff of wind came to chase away, seemed literally to bury you
alive. They brought out the sweat on the flagged floors and
passages of the old, old house; a crop of mould sprang up in the
corners of the dining-room; the bread mildewed in the bin. Did the
back door stand open, frogs took advantage of it to hop in and
secrete themselves; slugs squeezed through cracks and left their
silvery trail over the carpets. Mary began to fear the house would
prove but sorry winter quarters; and she had ample leisure to
indulge such reflections, the bad weather confining her almost
wholly within doors. Here was no kind friend with buggy or
shandrydan to rout her out and take her driving; and ladies did not
walk in Buddlecombe: the hilly roads were too steep, the flat roads
too muddy. So, once more, she sat and sewed, faced by the prospect
of a long, dull, lonely winter. Calls and invitations had rather
dropped off, of late...as was not unnatural...and she would have
been for seeing nothing peculiar in it, had she not connected it in
some obscure way with Richard and the practice. This had also
declined; was failing, it was plain, to live up to its early
promise.</p>

<p>She was unaware that no sooner had the "Court" reopened for the
winter than the tale&mdash;in a garbled version&mdash;of the
innovations attempted by the "new doctor's wife" had been carried
to the ears of its mistress. And Mrs. Archibald Treherne pinched a
pair of very thin lips and further arched already supercilious
eyebrows. That was all; but it was enough. And, in consequence,
from the choicest entertainments of the autumn the Mahonys found
themselves conspicuously omitted.</p>

<p>Their only personal connection with the big house was due to an
unhappy contretemps of the kind that was given to rankling for ever
after in Mahony's mind.</p>

<p>On learning of the family's arrival, both he and Mary privately
thought an exchange of courtesies would follow. Hence when one day
a footman was found to have handed in cards during Mary's
absence&mdash;his mistress keeping her seat in her carriage at the
foot of the hill&mdash;the visit did not take them by surprise.
Within the week Mary drove out in a hired vehicle to return it.</p>

<p>A bare half-hour later she was home again, looking flushed and
disturbed.</p>

<p>"Richard!...a most <i>awkward</i> thing has happened. Those
cards were not meant for us at all. It was the footman's mistake.
He ought to have left them at the next house down the
road&mdash;that little thatched cottage at the corner. They were
for a Mrs. Pigott, who's staying there."</p>

<p>"What? Well, upon my word!"</p>

<p>Leaning back in his chair Mahony stared at his wife, while he
took in the significance of her words. "And does that mean to say
the woman doesn't intend to call on you...as well?"</p>

<p>"Evidently not." Mary was crestfallen.</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i> But will call on this Mrs. Pigott?&mdash;living in
a farmer's thatched cottage?" And Mary not replying, he burst out:
"You will never, with my consent, set foot in that house
again!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I don't want to," said Mary, and sitting down untied
her bonnet-strings and threw them over her shoulders. "I don't know
<i>when</i> I've felt so uncomfortable. I was ushered into the
drawing-room&mdash;it seemed crowded with people&mdash;and there
she sat, holding our cards and looking from them to me and back
again. I heard something about 'the new doctor's wife' as I went
in. Then she asked to what she owed my visit, said she hadn't the
pleasure and so on&mdash;all in front of these other
people&mdash;the Brookes of 'Shirley' I think they were&mdash;that
retired old General...you met him once, you know, and thought him
very stuck-up. I had to explain how it had happened; I felt my face
getting as red as fire. I didn't know whether to walk out again or
what, and she didn't help me&mdash;didn't get up, or shake hands,
or anything. Fortunately a very nice person&mdash;a sort of
companion, I think &mdash;asked me to rest a little after my drive,
and I thought it would make things less awkward for everybody if I
did so; so I just sat down for a minute and said a word or two, and
then bowed and left. She came with me to the door&mdash;the
companion, I mean."</p>

<p>White with anger Mahony shuffled and re-shuffled the papers that
lay before him on the writing-table. "We've never been treated like
this in our lives before, Mary, and I for one won't put up with it!
Damn the woman and her insolence! Talk about breeding and blue
blood&mdash;give me ordinary decent feelings and a little kindness,
and you can keep the blood, thank you! I snap my fingers at it." In
imagination he saw his Mary, faced by a like predicament, doing her
utmost to smooth over the embarrassment of the moment and set the
unfortunate intruder at ease.</p>

<p>And time did not lessen his resentment. Rudeness to
Mary&mdash;such a thing had never before come within the range of
his experience&mdash;stung him, he found, almost more than rudeness
to himself. But was the thrust not actually aimed at him...through
her? What had the object of it been but to drive home to him the
galling fact that, on this side of the world, the medical
profession carried with it no standing whatever? In the colonies,
along with the Parson and the Police Magistrate, he had helped to
constitute the upper ten of a town. Here the doctor&mdash;and quite
especially the country doctor&mdash;stood little higher in the
social scale than did the vet. and the barber. Oh, those striped
poles! Tradition died so hard in this slow-thinking, slow-moving
country. Ingrained in people, not to be eradicated, was a memory of
the day when the surgeon had been but the servant, the attendant
lackey of the great house.</p>

<p>Grimly cogitating, he prepared in advance for further snubs and
slights by going about with his chin in the air, looking to the
last degree stiff and unapproachable. For, that Mary's misadventure
would remain a secret, he did not for a moment believe. There were
all too many mouths in Buddlecombe agape for gossip&mdash;it would
be threshed out over every tabby's tea-table&mdash;and those
already inclined to look down their noses at him and Mary would
have a fresh excuse for so grimacing. Anything was possible in such
a petty-minded, tittle-tattling place. Hence, it did not surprise
him to hear that Robinson had been called to the "Court." The
trouble was, of course, that the townspeople and lesser folk were
faithful in imitation of their betters; and soon it began to seem
to him that he was not occasionally, but everlastingly getting out
of Robinson's way. And as he sat at home over the fire&mdash;Mary
kept fires going to drive the damp out; though, in order to
breathe, you had to leave the windows wide open to mist and
fog&mdash;his thoughts were anything but cheerful. There was not
work enough for two &mdash;or money either. As it was, he was
having to depend more than he cared for on his Australian
dividends.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that the report reached his ears of
illness at "Toplands," where the younger son lay prostrate with
gastric fever. But his services were not requisitioned.</p>

<p>Then came that morning when Mary, grave and worried, broke the
news to him that Robinson's gig had been seen at the gates of
"Toplands"; the morning when, unable to hire a horse for his
rounds, he was tormented, as he trudged the country lanes, by the
idea that, like the last, this practice also was threatening to
peter out.</p>

<p>Late that evening as he sat reading, there came a loud
rat-tatting at the front door. The doctor in him pricked up his
ears at the now unfamiliar sound: it was like an old-time call to
action&mdash;in the land of cruel accident and sudden death. The
visitor admitted, an excited voice was heard in the passage, and
Mary's in reply; after which Mary herself entered the surgery,
shutting the door behind her and looking irresolute and
uncomfortable. The elder of the two Challoner boys had, it seemed,
come driving down post-haste from "Toplands." His brother lay
dying. Would Dr. Mahony come back with him&mdash;the dogcart was at
the door&mdash;and meet Mr. Robinson?</p>

<p>"Meet <i>Robinson?</i> Not if I know it!"</p>

<p>"I told him I couldn't be sure. But, Richard, there's nobody
else&mdash;unless he rides all the way to Brixeter. And there and
back would take him at least four hours. His brother might be dead
by then. Their mother is almost out of her mind, poor thing."</p>

<p>"Poor thing, indeed! After the way she's treated us. But you
haven't a scrap of pride in you."</p>

<p>"Not when it's a case of life or death I haven't. Dear, don't
you think you could manage to overlook what's happened?...not stand
on etiquette? If the boy should die, you'd reproach yourself
bitterly for not having gone."</p>

<p>"You never will understand these things, Mary!&mdash;and though
you live to be a hundred. Little did I dream," he said with
violence, as he slapped his book to and ungraciously rose to his
feet, "when I settled here, that I should ever come down to playing
second fiddle in this fashion."</p>

<p>"It may be your chance to play first again&mdash;if you cure
him."</p>

<p>Mahony pshawed.</p>

<p>Off he drove though, as she had known all along he would; and
did not get back till four in the morning. Then, half a glance was
enough to show her that he was in a state of extreme nervous
exasperation. So she asked only a single question: did the lad
still live? But Richard could not contain himself; and as he moved
about the bedroom, winding up his watch and letting his collar fly,
he burst out: "Nothing on earth will induce me to stop in this
place, Mary, to be insulted as I have been to-night! This is
worse&mdash;a hundred times worse!&mdash;than the colony."</p>

<p>From under her lashes Mary shot him a swift look he did not see:
a look full of motherly tenderness&mdash;and yet triumphant. Aloud
she merely said: "But think what a feather in your cap it will be,
if the boy recovers,...the prestige you will gain."</p>

<p>"Prestige? Pah! Robinson will say he did the curing, and I
stepped in and took the credit. A fat lot of prestige to be got
from that! Mary, there's been a dead set made against me
here&mdash;I've felt it now for some time, though why, I knew no
more than Adam. To-night I believe I got a clue. It's Australia if
you please!&mdash;the fact of my having practised in Australia is
against me." And at Mary's vigorously expressed disbelief: "Well!
just listen to this, my dear, and judge for yourself. First of all,
they prefer Robinson <i>fuddled</i>, to me sober. Yes, it's the
truth. When I get to 'Toplands' I find him tight&mdash;stupidly
tight&mdash;standing by the bed staring like an owl. Quite devoid
of shame he evidently is not though, for no sooner did he see me
than off he bolted&mdash;leaving me as much in the dark as ever. I
tried to get some information from the womenfolk about the earlier
stages of the complaint; but not one was capable of giving a
connected answer...I'd sent the other young fellow off for leeches
and the barber. Young Leonard lay convulsed and insensible. And
yet, if you'll believe me, Robinson had been telling them it was
gastric, and plying him with brandy. Inflammation of the membranes
of the brain, Mary!&mdash;and the fool killing him with stimulants.
While I was making mustard poultices for his feet and legs, back
comes Robinson and attempts to feel his pulse. I said: 'Now look
here, my good man, if you don't give me some particulars of this
case, I shall proceed to treat it without you.' He answered not a
word. Then I turned to her. 'Now, madam,' said I, 'I'm not going to
stand this. Either he or I must leave the room&mdash;or indeed the
house&mdash;and, until you decide which, I go downstairs.' She
followed, all but clawing at my coat. He lurches after us, shouting
abuse...for the whole house to hear. And what, pray, do you think
he said?...amongst other scurrilous trash. 'Very well, if you
prefer the opinion of this old quack to mine, take it and abide by
the consequences. Australia! We all knows what <i>that</i> means.
Ask him what other trades he's plied there. Make him turn out his
credentials.' It was as much as I could do to keep from knocking
him down. Only the thought of the lad upstairs restrained me.
<i>She</i> was very humble and apologetic, of course; besought me
to take no notice; almost grovelled to me to save her son, etc.
etc. I made short work of her, though."</p>

<p>"Besides, you can surely afford to smile at such nonsense,
Richard?" Mary strove to soothe him. "It would be beneath your
dignity to notice it. Especially as he wasn't himself." Distressed
though she felt at this return for Richard's kindness, Mary was
also unpleasantly worked on by his interlarded "My good man!" and
the general hoity-toity air of his narration. What a peppery fellow
he was! How could he ever expect to succeed and be popular? That
kind of tone would not go down here.</p>

<p>"I make allowance for his condition...of course I do...but all
the same it does not incline me, my dear...If such are the tales
that are going the round about me, Mary&mdash;charlatan and quack,
a colonial ne'er-do-well trading on a faked diploma and so on; if
it's a blot on my reputation to have lived and practised in the
colonies, instead of mouldering my life away in this miserable
village &mdash;then much is explained that has been dark to me.
Anyhow, it came over me with a rush to-night: I go from here. They
don't want me; I'm not good enough for them&mdash;a man who has
held a first-class practice in the second city of Victoria not good
enough for the torpid livers of Buddlecombe! Very well, let them
get some one else...I'm done with 'em. Really, Mary, I sometimes
feel so sick and tired of the struggle that I fancy throwing up
medicine altogether. What would you say, love, to taking a small
cottage somewhere and living modestly on the little we have?"</p>

<p>Now what <i>would</i> he say next? wondered Mary with an inward
sigh. But the present was not the moment to combat such vagaries.
Richard was sore and smarting; and in this mood he just tossed off
suggestions without thinking; letting his anger out in them as the
hole in the lid of a kettle lets out steam. So she only said: "Let
us first see what happens here. Is there any chance of Lenny
Challoner recovering?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, I don't think there is. I give him till the coming
midnight. He'll probably die between then and dawn."</p>

<p>But this prediction was not fulfilled. The boy weathered the
night; and after sixty hours' unconsciousness spoke to those about
him, though with wandering wits.</p>

<p>Buddlecombe was all a-twitter and agog: the affair was discussed
over counters by tradesmen and goodwives; at mahogany
dinner-tables; in the oaken settles of inns. Every one knew to a T
everything that had happened...and a good deal more: were for and
against the two doctors in their feud. "'Tis a'anyway little
better'n boo'tchers a hoald t'lot of un," thus Raby, the town
crier, summed up the matter to his cronies of the "Buddlecombe
Arms." "Bu'ut if us was ca'alves, 'tis the ha'and us knows as us
'ud ra'ather die by."</p>

<p>Yes, chiefly against him, felt Mahony: and it screwed him stiff
as a rod. The majority sided with the townsman who had lived among
them for years; who was rich enough to spend freely in their shops,
subscribe heavily to their charities; besides being an expert in
the right admixture of joviality and reserve necessary to make his
failings go down.</p>

<p>Mary fought this idea with all her might. Richard was just
reading his own feelings into other people, as usual. She herself
clung to the belief that the sick boy would pull through, now he
had held out so long. Which would be a veritable triumph for
Richard. If only he did not spoil things by his uncompromising
behaviour! For he was in a most relentless frame of mind. More than
one of Robinson's patients subsequently sent for him. But he,
riding the high horse, declined to touch a single other of the
enemy's cases. They should apply for relief, said he, to Mr. Jakes
of Brixeter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, of course, he did not spare himself over the patient
he had taken in hand. But eventually, in spite of his care, the boy
died, killing Mary's hopes, and enabling Robinson to go about
cockahoop, boasting that wrong treatment had finished him off. It
<i>had</i> been "gastric," after all!</p>

<p>And now, as he stalked his way or drove his gig about the hilly
roads and narrow streets, Mahony felt himself indeed a marked
man.</p>

<p>"Till Christmas...not a day longer! I was never built for this."
And as he said it, his thoughts flew back to a time when the merest
hint that his skill was doubted had shaken his roots to their
depths. Here, where he had as yet hardly put out a sucker, the
wrench was easier, and at the same time a hundredfold more
destructive.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-1-8" id="ch-2-1-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>But before Christmas came, Mary's hope that things would somehow
right themselves burned up anew&mdash;if hope that could be called
which ran so counter to her own inclinations, and to the possible
issue she now thought she descried.</p>

<p>With the onset of November it was the turn of "Buddlecombe Hall"
to reopen. And now a wave of new life seemed to run through the
sluggish little town. The Saxeby-Corbetts, returning, as it were
took possession of the place; and they had this advantage over the
Trehernes&mdash;a childless couple&mdash;that they counted a
baker's dozen in family all told. Their arrival was after the
fashion of crowned heads. First came dragloads of servants, male
and female, and of varying ages&mdash;from the silver-headed butler
down to young scullery and laundry-maids&mdash;after which the
windows of the great house were flung up, the chimneys belched
smoke, hammerings and beatings resounded; while various elderly
women in the town tied on rusty black and went off to give
obsequious aid. Footmen in livery lounged about the inns; grooms
rode swathed horses out to exercise. The tradespeople wellnigh lost
their wits with excitement. One heard of nothing, now, on entering
a shop, but "the family," its needs and preferences.</p>

<p>"I've never seen anything to equal it!" cried Mahony
exasperated. "The way these poor creatures burn to prostrate
themselves."</p>

<p>The list of young people would not be full till the holidays
began; but donkey and pony-carts were met with containing the
smaller children, their attendant governesses and nursemaids. The
squire himself, a ruddy-faced man in early middle age, mounted on a
fine chestnut, might be observed confabbing with the farmers; and
lastly came his lady, driving herself in a low chaise: a
bony-jawed, high-nosed woman, whose skin told of careless exposure
to all weathers. Dressed anyhow, too, said Mary, who had once seen
her in the town with an old garden-hat perched on her head, a red
flannel spencer thrown over her bodice.</p>

<p>And now, at the sound of wheels, grocer and butcher would prick
up their ears and pop from their respective doors, merely on the
off chance of pulling their forelocks, and (as likely as not)
receiving in return a snub from the lady of the "Hall." For in
spite of what Mahony called their "piteous desire" to please, she
was never satisfied, and hurled at their heads, in vigorous
language, her frank opinion of their wares.</p>

<p>"Now, Johnson, this will not do! That last meat you supplied to
the servants hall was tough as my boot. If the next is no better, I
shall come and superintend the slaughtering myself. It's my belief,
my man, you don't know a heifer from a leather-gutted
milch-cow!"</p>

<p>And Johnson, doubled in two with relish of her "ladyship's"
joke, could be heard right down the street vowing there should be
no further ground for complaint; though a visit from her "ladyship"
to his humble establishment would at any time be reckoned as an
honour&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p>To mark his disapproval of this fawning, and for fear any hint
of patronage or condescension might come his way, Mahony had all
his armour on, all his spines out, when he was unexpectedly
summoned to the "Hall" to attend one of the children, sick of a
feverish cold. Mary saw him go, with many misgivings; but it
actually seemed as if, for once, his lordly manner went down. By
his own account he successfully faced the imperious dame: "Who, if
you please, was for herself pronouncing on the ailment&mdash;it
turns out to be chicken-pox&mdash;and had nurses and maids dancing
like puppets to a string. I soon let her see that kind of thing
wouldn't do with me, Mary. And she took the hint fast enough,
changed her tone, and behaved like any other decently bred
woman.&mdash;I had certainly rather though," he added, "have her
for a friend than an enemy."</p>

<p>Oh, if this could only be, thought Mary. It might alter
everything. And it was here, with him daily at the "Hall," where
the nursery in a body succumbed to the pox, that her confidence
bloomed anew. For in a way Richard even became a kind of protege of
its mistress: she would keep him, after his professional visit was
paid, to chat about the colonies and hear his impressions of
England. Even Mary herself received a call, and though it was one
of a somewhat quizzing inspection and Madam was "not at home" when
she returned it, yet Richard was pleased, which was the main thing.
He himself was twice bidden to dinner&mdash;a little informal
dinner, at which only another man or two was present; a state of
things that seemed to mark as true the report that the dame had
small liking for the company of her own sex.</p>

<p>Yes, Richard's fortunes seemed at last to have taken a definite
turn for the better, when of a sudden the blow fell which put an
end to hopes and fears alike. What was behind it Mary did not know,
and never learned. But one morning at breakfast he blurted out in
summary fashion that he had resolved, overnight, to shake the dust
of Buddlecombe off his feet. And before she had recovered from the
shock of this announcement, the house was up for sale, and she hard
at work sorting and packing. Coming as it did on top of her renewed
confidence, the decision hit Mary hard. It also gave a further push
to her tottering faith in Richard's judgment. Of course, it was
clear something unpleasant had happened at the last dinner-party.
But she could get nothing out of Richard&mdash;absolutely
nothing&mdash;except that he was done "for all eternity" with place
and people. In vain she reasoned, argued, pleaded...and even lost
her temper. He remained obstinately silent, leaving her to her own
conjectures&mdash;which led nowhere. Leicester?...well, compared
with this, his bolting from Leicester had been as easy to
understand as A B C&mdash;an ugly town with no practice worth
speaking of, and the little there was, of the wrong kind. But here
where she had thought his first irate "Till Christmas!" was
gradually being overlaid; here she could only put his abrupt
determination down to one of his most freakish and wayward
impulses.</p>

<p>Mahony saw her trouble; saw, too, how rudely her trust in him
was shaken. But he did not enlighten her&mdash;he would rather have
cut his tongue out. For what had happened concerned Mary first of
all; and though there was a chance she might have taken it less
tragically than he&mdash;in real "Mary-ish" fashion&mdash;yet he
felt as averse to bringing the words over his lips as to letting
her see how deeply it had mortified him.</p>

<p>Another informal invitation to dine at the "Hall" had reached
him&mdash;at least, he took it to be such, since Mary was not
included. At the entrance to the great house, however&mdash;six
o'clock of a frosty December evening&mdash;he ran into old Barker,
a retired Anglo-Indian, just dismounting from his hired fly; and to
his amazement saw that, this time, Barker had his ladies with him.
Becoming involved in their entrance, he was waiting with the
Colonel for wife and daughters to rejoin them, when the old
valetudinarian found that he had left his jujubes in the pocket of
his greatcoat. Standing thus alone, close to the half-open
drawing-room door, Mahony suddenly heard his own name spoken and in
the harsh, grating voice of their hostess.&mdash;"Yes, from the
colonies. I can tell you I <i>was</i> put out, when I came back and
found what had happened. I wrote off at once to that sheep, young
Philips, and gave him a sound rating for letting himself be
frightened away, after the trouble I had been to, to get him here."
At this a gentler voice murmured a query; to which the answer rang
shrill and dear: "Oh, well, <i>he</i> is quite presentable!"</p>

<p>This it was that stuck in Mahony's throat. And on getting home
shortly after midnight he did not go down the passage to the
bedroom, but turned into the surgery, which faced the hall-door. No
sound came from Mary; she was evidently asleep.</p>

<p>He did not strike a match: feeling his way to the window, he
raised the blind and leaned his forehead on the glass. The sea lay
still and black as ink, under a starlit sky&mdash;as starlight went
here. Presently the moon, now entered on her last quarter, would
come up from behind the diffs and throw a lurid light&mdash;lurid,
because the light of decay&mdash;over the cold sea and sleeping
town, picking out the line of silvery shingle that edged the beach,
and making the odd old curved breakwater look as though it were
built of marble.</p>

<p>He had been at white heat all the evening. Again and again amid
the desultory talk, both at the dinner-table and afterwards in the
drawing-room, the rasping voice had rung in his ears: "<i>He</i> is
quite presentable!"&mdash;while he could imagine, though he had not
seen, the impudent shrug that accompanied the stressing of the
pronoun. Thus wantonly did mortals glance at, sum up and dismiss
one another. The jar to his pride was a rude one. For, ingrained in
him, and not to be eradicated was the conviction that he was
gentleman first, doctor second: slights might be aimed at his
profession, but not at him in person.&mdash;And yet, in comparison,
the patronising "presentable" affixed to himself left him cold. It
was the sneer at Mary that stung him to the quick. That was
something he would never be able either to forget or forgive. Did
he contemplate this great heart, full to the brim of charity, of
human kindness; this mine of generous impulse; this swift begetter
of excuse and explanation for everything in others that was not as
fair and honest as in himself; did he consider that, to assist in
their need any of these purblind souls who sat so lightly in
judgment on her, she would have stripped the clothing from her
back: then he burned with a wrath too deep for words. He did not
know one of them worthy to tie up her shoe-lace. And yet, such a
worm for truth existed in him, so plaguy an instinct to get to the
root of a matter, that even as he burned, he found himself looking
Mary up and down, viewing her from every angle, and with a purely
objective eye. He saw her at home, in church, in the company of
others; saw her gestures, her movements, her smile; heard her
laughter, the tones of her voice and her way of speaking: all
these, for the first time, as things for themselves, detached from
the true, sound core of her. And as he did so, he was forced to own
that, in a way, these people were justified of their criticism: she
<i>was</i> different. But not as they meant it. Her manner had a
naturalness, her gestures a spontaneity, which formed only too
happy a contrast to their ruled and measured restraint. Indeed as
he studied her, it began to seem to him that into all Mary did or
said there had crept something large and free&mdash;a dash of the
spaciousness belonging to the country that had become her true
home. She needed elbow-room. Her voice was deeper, fuller, more
resonant than theirs; she fixed a straight, simple gaze on people
and things; walked with a freer step, was franker in her speech,
readier with her tongue; she stood up to members of the other sex
as women emphatically did <i>not</i> do here, an they did not
belong to the class of "Madam of the Hall." No connection between
Mary and the pursed-up mouth, the downcast, unroving, unintelligent
eye, the hands primly folded at the waist, the short, sedate steps,
of the professing English lady. For that, the net of her experience
had been too widely cast. She had rubbed shoulders with all sorts;
had been unable to afford the "lady's" privilege of shutting an eye
to evil or wrong-doing and pretending it did not exist. And if, in
the process, she had come to be a shade too downright in her
opinions, too blunt for the make-believe of antique
conventions...well, he thought he might safely leave it to Him who
had broken bread with publicans and sinners, to adjudge which was
the worthier attitude of the two.</p>

<p>Thus he reasoned; but ever and again his mind veered back to the
personal thrust. Mary vulgar!...Mary, of whom he had felt so fondly
proud, having grown to middle age hearing on all sides that she had
not her equal in those attributes that make a woman blessed. "Out
there" he had seen her courted, made much of; none had approached
her in popularity. And from this happy state he had torn her
away...for what? For the privilege of being looked down on as not
quite a lady...had uprooted her from the country she loved best and
fitted best into, to make her a stranger on the face of the earth.
So much for Mary. But did he himself feel any more at home here
than she? Not a bit of it! Nor had he been a jot apter at adjusting
himself. They stood out, the pair of them, like over-large figures
on a miniature background. The truth was they had lost the knack of
running in a groove: life, in its passage, had hammered them out
into citizens of the world. So that, by now, an indelible stamp was
on them. And, with this as their dower, cured for ever of an
excessive insularity, they had come back to find an England that
had not budged by an inch; where people's outlook, habits, opinions
were just what they had always been &mdash;inelastic, uninspired.
Worse, these islanders seemed to preen themselves on their very
rigidity, their narrow-mindedness, their ignorance of any life or
country but their own; waving aside with an elegant flutter of the
hand, everything of which they themselves had no cognisance. And
into this closed circle he and Mary&mdash;especially Mary&mdash;had
come blundering, trampling on prejudice, surrounded by an aura of
adventure...and unsuccessful adventure at that! Was it indeed any
wonder they found themselves outside the pale?</p>

<p>Well, this ended it. He could not picture himself going on
living there with a nervous eye eternally cocked at Mary to see how
she was comporting herself, or how what she did struck the wretched
group of snobs he had been fool enough to dump her down amongst;
the while he winced at idiosyncrasies he yet grudged to admit. No,
the wider the distance he could put between himself and Buddlecombe
the better he would be pleased. But where to go?...what next? Back
to some sordid manufacturing town, with its black mud and slippery
cobble-stones, to act as medical adviser to a handful of grooms and
servant girls? Or to another village to see exclusive country-folk
turn up their noses at your wife, and watch the practice in which
you had invested your hard-earned hundreds melting away, filched by
one whose chief merit was never having been out of England? Not if
he knew it!&mdash;There now remained only London to
consider&mdash;Mary would no doubt harp anew on the openings to be
found there. But at the mere thought of London he shrank into
himself, as he had shrunk under his first physical impression of
it. What he had then suspected he now felt sure of. Great cities
were not for him: he was too old to stand the strain of their wear
and tear. And therewith the list of possibilities on this side of
the globe was exhausted. Would he had stayed on the other! CIVIS
BRITANNICUS SUM&mdash;that knowledge should have been enough for
him. Instead of which, burning to prove his citizenship, he had
chased back, with, in his heart, the pent-up feelings of his long,
long absence. He laughed did he now recall the exultation with
which he had descried the outlines of the English coast. "Out
there," he had seen this old country through the rose-red
spectacles of youthful memory. Now he knew that the thrill he had
experienced on again beholding it&mdash;his pleasure in its radiant
greenness&mdash;was the sum total of the satisfaction he would ever
get from it. No sooner ashore&mdash;and not even Mary had fathomed
his passionate desire to stand well here&mdash;than he had felt
himself outsider and alien. England had no welcome for her homing
sons, or any need of them: their places were long since filled.</p>

<p>But stay! let him be frank with himself. Had he liked the
motherland any better than it liked him? He had not. Indeed his
feelings were a great deal more active than any want of liking. He
hated it&mdash;yes! hate was not too strong a word&mdash;and had
done, from the first moment of landing. His attempt at
transplanting himself had been a sad and sorry failure. Returning
full of honours and repute, he found that the mere fact of his
having lived and practised in Australia cast a slur on his good
name. Again, he had come back on what he believed to be but the
threshold of middle age&mdash;and without being greatly troubled by
it; for, "out there," men of his own years had kept pace, gone
along with him&mdash;and everywhere had been made to feel himself
well over his prime, if not indeed&mdash;thanks to Australian
pallor and wrinkles&mdash;an old man: one of those broken-down
adventurers who limp home, at long last, to eke out the remainder
of a wasted life.</p>

<p>But what next?&mdash;what in all the world next? To this
question he could find no answer. Nor was he helped by staring at
the sea, or the golden, lemon-shaped moon that now came up on its
back from behind the dark mass of the cliffs. The purchase of a
third practice was beyond him: if he went from here he went
empty-handed. Possibly he might get for the house what he had given
for it&mdash;though he had discovered that it was both damp and in
need of repair&mdash;but this sum would not suffice to set him up
anew. No, the outlook was darker than, a moment before, the night
had been; no moon rose for him. And he lay long wakeful, grappling
in a cold sweat with the many small practical details of the
break&mdash;details which it is so easy to overlook in the taking
of sweeping decisions, yet which afterwards rise up like
mountains&mdash;and following the square of silver that flooded in
through the uncurtained window, and slowly moved across the bed on
its passage from wall to wall. With the glimmer of the material
dawn, however&mdash;red behind those cliffs that had delivered up
the moon, great Jupiter hanging like a globe of silver above
them&mdash;there came to him, too, the dawning of a possible
solution. But at the first hint of it he flung restlessly over on
his side, unable to bear its weight. A bolder hand than his was
needed, to sweep away the cobwebs of prejudice and nervous aversion
in which he had spun himself. It took Mary to do it; and she did;
though not till she had talked herself hoarse in an attempt to make
him see reason, begging him to hold the field and show fight; till
her head swam with listening to his monotonous: "What now? Where
can I go?" Then, abruptly determined, she cut the knot by facing
him and answering squarely: "Why, home again!"&mdash;words which
first made Mahony wince, then snort with contempt. But he had no
other suggestion to offer&mdash;or none but the fatuous one Mary
had already smiled at, that, he having given up practice, they
should retire to some tiny cottage, do without domestic help, see
no company, and live on the slender sum that came to them from
Australia. "I think we could be very happy and content, love,
living so&mdash;just you and I." If a soul can be said to laugh,
then, in spite of her trouble, Mary's soul rocked with laughter at
this fresh sample of Richard's fantasy. Oh, was there ever such an
unpractical old dreamer?...such an inability to see things as they
were. No doubt he pictured a show cottage, wreathed in roses and
honeysuckle, where they would pass idyllic days. The slow
death-in-life of such an existence, the reaction of his haughty
pride against the social position&mdash;or want of
position&mdash;that would be forced upon them, was hidden from him.
Perhaps mercifully hidden...and Mary sighed.</p>

<p>But she did not falter...either at his first disdainful sniff,
or, later on, when his eyes came stealing back to hers; came tamed,
all the scorn gone out of them. "Only do not call it home," was his
unspoken request. Short of a miracle that name would never, he
believed, cross his lips again. No place could now be "home" to him
as long as he lived. He was once more an outcast and a wanderer;
must go back in humiliation to the land that had eaten up his
prime, and there make the best of the years that were left him.</p>

<p>As time wore on, however, and their preparations for departure
advanced; as, too, the prospect of a change of scene hoisted its
pirate flag again, this sense of bitterness subsided; the acute
ache turned to a dull pain that was almost a relief. And worked on
by this, as by the joy which, for all her anxieties, Mary could not
quite conceal, the relief also imperceptibly changed its character,
and grew to be a warm spot in his heart.</p>

<p>And one evening, when the supper dishes had been pushed aside to
make room for Mary's desk&mdash;she was methodically noting the
contents of a tin trunk&mdash;Mahony in watching her and thinking
how the frequent coughs and colds she had suffered from, since
landing in England, had thinned her down, spoke his thought aloud.
"Well, love, whatever happens, you at least will grow fat and well
again, and be the healthy woman you always were."</p>

<p>"Now don't start to worry about me. I'm all right," said Mary.
"It takes time to get used to a strange climate." She entered a few
more items in her clean, pointed writing, then laid her pen down
and put her chin on her hand. "The thing I like to think of,
Richard, is how soon I shall be seeing them all again&mdash;Ned and
Jerry and Tilly, and the dear children. I can hardly believe it. I
<i>have</i> missed them so."</p>

<p>"Poor little wife! And shall I tell you what I dwell most on?
'Pon my soul, Mary, it's of getting my teeth into a really sweet
apple again&mdash;instead of a specimen that's red on one side
only. I believe England will stick in my mind, for the rest of my
days, as the land where the fruit doesn't ripen."</p>

<p>"And yet costs so much to buy."</p>

<p>"And if I know you, my dear, it's the Abernethy biscuit and thin
lemon-water you won't forget. Well, well, madam! you'll soon be
able to pamper your guests once more to your heart's content."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But I shall at least see who it is Jerry thinks of
marrying."</p>

<p>"See?...yes. But don't hug the belief you'll be able to
influence him in his choice."</p>

<p>"I may not want to. And then there's Johnny to try and find out
about, poor boy, and to keep Zara from making a goose of herself.
Oh! now that we're going home, I feel how dreadfully cut off from
them all I have been here."</p>

<p>"And they'll every one hail you joyfully, my dear, rest assured
of that!...be literally foaming with impatience to make use of you
again. I should only like to know how they've got on without you."
Mahony had risen from his chair and was standing on the hearthrug
with his back to the fire. Having meditatively warmed his
coat-tails for a moment he added: "There's another thing, Polly, I
don't mind telling you I look forward to, and that is seeing a real
sunrise and sunset again. On this side of the world...well, as
often as not the sun seems just to slip in or out of a bank of
clouds. There's none of that sense of a coming miracle...that
uplifting effect of space...or splendour of colouring. Why, I've
still in my memory evenings when half the field of the sky was one
pink flush&mdash;with a silver star twinkling through&mdash;or a
stretch of unreal green deepening into yellow &mdash;or mauve...And
the idea has come to me that it must have been from glories of this
kind that the old Greek scribe drew his picture of the New
Jerusalem...Yes, I must say, things here&mdash;colouring,
landscape, horizon&mdash;have all seemed very dull and
cramped...like the souls of the people themselves."</p>

<p>Again he fell into thought. Then warmed by these confidences,
went further. "Mary, love, let me confess it: I realise what a sad
fool I've made of myself over this whole business. My ever leaving
Ballarat was a fatal mistake. If I'd only had the sense to take
your advice! I was run down&mdash;at the end of my
tether&mdash;from years of overwork. A twelve-month out of harness
would have set me right again: a voyage to this side; fresh
surroundings and associations&mdash;and no need to stint with the
money either, for we should now have been going back to our old
ample income. Instead of having to face another start on as good as
nothing...eat humble pie before them all, too. For they will
certainly grasp what has happened.&mdash;No, I can see it now; I
was too old for such a drastic break. One's habits stiffen with
one's joints. You've noticed I've been hurt by people here implying
I'm out-of-date, old-fashioned&mdash;good enough for the colonies
but not for the home-country&mdash;but, upon my word, Mary, I don't
know if there isn't some truth in it. I stopped too long in the one
place, my dear; with the result that I ought to have stopped there
altogether.&mdash;Well, well!...there's only this about it: fiasco
though it has proved, it has not hit me as hard as it might have
done, considering the exaggerated expectations I came home with.
Which in itself is enough to show me age is rendering me
indifferent. Actually, my dear, I believe much of the sting is
taken from what has happened by the sight of your satisfaction at
returning. Never should I have brought you here&mdash;never! I
thought to find myself among a different set of people altogether.
In memory, I confused good breeding with tact and kindliness.
Whereas, now, if it comes to a choice between blue blood and inborn
goodness of heart, then what I say is: give me nature's gentlefolk
all the time. There's as little likeness between them as between
this eternal clammy drizzle and some of those cloudless winter days
we knew on the Flat."</p>

<p>"Richard! Don't forget how you hated the climate there. And how
poorly the sun made you feel."</p>

<p>"Nor do I. And in spite of the mizzle, and damp, and want of
sun, I've thriven in this country. But one can't live on climate
alone. And when I let my mind dwell on the way
I&mdash;we&mdash;have been treated here; the stodgy lack of
goodwill...animosity even...the backbiting and gossip, I tell you
this, love: there's but one person I shall regret when I leave; one
only of whom I shall carry away a warm remembrance; and that's, as
you know, your dear old mother. But can you guess why? Upon my
word, I believe it's because there's something in her
warm-heartedness and generosity, her overflowing hospitality, that
reminds me of the people we lived among so long."</p>

<p>"Well! it's late...we must to bed," he went on, after a silence
which Mary did not break, there seeming really nothing left for her
to say. "I've no plans, my dear, nor have I at present the spirit
to make any. It seems best at this moment to leave the future in
the laps of the gods. I know this much though: I'm cured of
castle-building for ever."</p>

<p>Mary nodded and acquiesced; or at least again said nothing; and
she kept to this attitude in the weeks that followed, when, as was
only natural, Richard's mind, far too active and uneasy to rest,
began to play round the plans he <i>might</i> have made, had he not
forsworn the habit. These included settling somewhere by the sea;
either near Melbourne or at one of the watering-places on the
Bay&mdash;Dromana or Schnapper Point. Mary let him talk. She
herself was persuaded that the only rational thing for him to do
was to return to Ballarat. It was of no use his riding the high
horse: feelings of pique and pride must yield to practical
considerations. He was known from one end of Ballarat to the other;
and the broken threads could there be picked up more swiftly and
with greater ease than anywhere else. It would, of course, no
longer be a case of Webster Street&mdash;unless the doctor to whom
he had sold the practice had failed, or proved otherwise
unsatisfactory. But Richard would find room somewhere; even if it
had to be on the Redan, or at Sebastopol, or out at Buninyong. And
though he could now never hope to occupy the position he had
wilfully abandoned&mdash;oh, the unspeakable folly of
man!&mdash;never hope to give up general practice for that of
consultant or specialist, yet with care something might still be
saved from the wreck of the past. And nursing these schemes, Mary
set her lips and frowned with determination. Never again in the
years to come, should he be able to say he repented not having
taken her advice. This time she would set her will through, cost
what it might.</p>

<p>The good ship <i>Florabella</i>, eighty-four days out from

<p>Coming up from below to catch a whiff of it, her passengers
blinked dazzled eyes at the gaudy brilliancy of light and
colouring. Here were no frail tints and misty trimmings; everything
stood out hard, clear, emphatic. The water was a crude sapphire;
the surf that frothed on the reefs white as milk. As for the sky,
Mahony declared it made him think of a Reckitt's bluebag; while a
single strip of pearly cloud to the east looked fixed,
immovable&mdash;solid as those clouds on which, in old paintings,
cherubs perch or lean.</p>

<p>Outside the "Rip" the vessel hove to, to take up the pilot; and
every neck was craned to watch his arrival; for with him would come
letters and news&mdash;the first to reach the travellers since
their departure from England. Hungrily was the unsealing of the
mail-bag awaited.</p>

<p>Mary's lap would hardly hold the envelopes that bore her name.
They were carried to her by the grizzled old Captain himself, who
dealt them out, one by one, cracking a joke to each. Mary laughed;
but at the same time felt a touch of embarrassment. For her to
receive so large a share of the good things&mdash;under the very
noses, too, of those unfortunates who got none&mdash;seemed not in
the best of taste. So, the tale told, she retired with her budget
to the cabin; and Mahony, having seen her below, went back to read
his own correspondence on deck.</p>

<p>But she had done no more than finish John's note of welcome and
break the seal of Tilly's, when a foot came bounding through the
saloon, off which the cabin opened, and there was Richard
again&mdash;Richard with rumpled hair, eyes alight, red of face,
looking for all the world like a rowdy schoolboy. Seizing her by
the hands he pulled her to her feet, and would have twirled her
round. But Mary, her letters strewing the floor,
protested&mdash;stood firm.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the matter?"</p>

<p>"Mary! Wife! Here's news for us!...here's news. A letter
from&mdash;" and he flourished a sheet of paper at her. "I give you
three guesses, love. But nonsense!&mdash;you couldn't...not if you
guessed till Doomsday. No more pinching and scraping for us, Mary!
No more underpaid drudgery for me! My fortune's made. I am a rich
man...at last!"</p>

<p>"Richard dear! What is it now?"</p>

<p>Mary spoke in the lightly damping tone which Mahony was wont to
grumble she reserved for him alone. But to-day it passed
unnoticed.</p>

<p>"Here you are, madam&mdash;read for yourself!" and he pushed a
crumpled letter into her hand. "It's those <i>Australia Felixes</i>
we have to thank for it. What a glorious piece of luck, Mary, that
I should have stuck to them and gone on paying their wretched
calls, when every one else let them lapse in despair. John will be
green with envy. And this is only the beginning, my dear. There's
no telling what they'll do when they get the new plant in&mdash;old
Simmonds says so himself, and he's not given to superlatives as you
know.&mdash;Yes, it's good-bye to poverty!"&mdash;and forgetting in
his excitement where he was, Mahony flung round to pace the floor.
Baulked by the narrow wall of the cabin, he had just to turn to the
right-about. "It means I can now pick and choose, Mary&mdash;put up
my plate in Collins Street East&mdash;hold my head as high as the
best."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, how glad I am!...for your sake." The tears sprang to
Mary's eyes; she had openly to wipe them away. "But it's so sudden.
I can hardly believe it. Are you sure it's <i>really</i> true?" And
now she stroked the page smooth, to read for herself.</p>

<p>"You for my sake...I for yours! What haven't you had to put up
with, my poor love, through being tied to a rolling old stone like
me? But now, I promise you, everything will be different. There's
nothing you shall not have, my Mary&mdash;nothing will be too good
for you. You shall ride in your own carriage&mdash;keep half a
dozen servants. And when once you are free of worries and troubles
you'll grow fat and rosy again, and all these little lines on your
forehead will disappear."</p>

<p>"And perhaps you won't dislike the colony so much...and the
people...if you can feel independent of them," said Mary hopefully.
Could he have promised her from this day forth a tranquil and
contented mind, it would have been the best gift of any.</p>

<p>When he had danced out&mdash;danced was the word that occurred
to her to describe the new spring in his step, which seemed
intolerant of the floor&mdash;had gone to consult the steward about
the purchase of a special brand of champagne, which that worthy was
understood to hold in store for an occasion such as this: when Mary
sat down to collect her wits, she indulged in a private reflection
which neither then nor later did she share with Richard. It ran:
"Oh, how thankful I am we didn't get the letter till we were safely
away from that...from England. Or he might have taken it into his
head to stop there."</p>

<p>Mahony felt the need of being alone, and sought out a quiet spot
to windward where he was likely to be undisturbed. But news of the
turn of his fortunes had run like wildfire through the ship,
started by the steward, to whom in the first flush he had
garrulously communicated it. And now came one after another of his
fellow-passengers to wring his hand and wish him joy. It was well
meant; he could not but answer in kind. But then they, too, had
changed. From mere nondescripts and undesirables they were
metamorphosed into kindly, hearty folk, generous enough, it seemed,
to feel almost as elated at a fellow-mortal's good luck as if it
were their own. His hedge of spines went down: he turned frank,
affable, easy of approach; though any remaining standoffishness was
like to have been forgiven him, who at a stroke had become one of
the wealthiest men on board.</p>

<p>He could see these simple souls thought he took his windfall
very coolly. Well!...in a way he did. Just for the moment he had
been carried off his feet&mdash;as indeed who could fail to be,
when by a single lucky chance, one spin of fate's wheel, all that
had become his which half a lifetime's toil had failed to give him?
Yet ingrained in him was so lively a relish, so poignant a need for
money and the ease of mind money would bring, that the stilling of
the want had something almost natural about it&mdash;resembled the
payment of an overdue debt. Yes, affluence would fit him like a
second skin. The beggardom of early days, the push and scramble for
an income of later life&mdash;these had been the travesty.</p>

<p>Next came a sense of relief&mdash;relief unspeakable. Alone by
now in his windy corner, he could afford to let his eyes grow
moist; and the finger he passed round inside his collar trembled.
From what a nightmare of black care, a horde of petty anxieties,
did the miracle of this day not set him free! To take but a single
instance: the prospect of having to explain away his undignified
return to the colony had cost him many a night's sleep. Now he was
the master of circumstance, not its playball. And into the delights
of this sensation he plunged as into a magic water; laved in it,
swam, went under; and emerged a new man. The crust of indifference,
the insidious tiredness, the ennui that comes of knowing the end of
a thing before you have well begun it, and knowing it not worth
while: all such marks of advancing age fell away. Youthfully he
squared his shoulders; he was ready to live again, and with zest.
And under the influence of this revival there stirred in him, for
the first time, a more gracious feeling for the land towards which
he was heading. What he had undergone there in his day, none but
himself knew; but, if his sufferings had been great, great, too,
was the atonement now made him. Indeed the bigness of the reward
had in it something of the country's own immensity&mdash;its
far-flung horizons.</p>

<p>"And perhaps, after all...who knows, who knows!...I myself...the
worm that was in me...that ceaseless hankering for&mdash;why,
happiness, of course...the goal of man's every venture...the belief
in one's <i>right</i> to it...the fixed idea that it must be
waiting for one somewhere...remains but to go in search of it. So,
it is not conceivable...thus made wiser...all fear for the future
stilled, too&mdash;<i>how</i> fear lames and
deadens!&mdash;independent, now...beholden to nobody"&mdash;such
were some of the loose tags of thought that drifted through his
brain.</p>

<p>Till one or other touched a secret spring, and straightway he
was launched again on those dreams and schemes with which he
believed his last unhappy experience had for ever put him out of
conceit. Oh, the house he would build!...the grounds he would lay
out...the books he would buy...and buy...till he had a substantial
library of his own. All the rare and pretty things that should be
Mary's. The gifts they would make her dear old mother. The
competency that should rescue his own people from their obscure
indigence. The deserving strugglers to whom he would lend a hand.
Even individuals he disliked or was fretted by&mdash;Zara, Ned,
Ned's encumbrances&mdash;sipped from his overflow. Indeed he
actually caught himself thinking of people &mdash;poor devils,
mostly&mdash;who had done him a bad turn, and of how he could now
requite them.</p>

<p>Over these imaginings the hours flew by&mdash;hours not divided
off each from the next, but fusing to form one single golden day:
of a kind that does not come twice in a lifetime. Meanwhile the
vessel was well advanced up the great Bay, and familiar landmarks
began to rise into view. He had sometimes wondered, on the voyage
out, what his feelings would be, when he saw these familiar places
again and knew that the pincer of the "Heads" had snapped behind
him. Now, he contemplated them with a vacant eye; did not take up
the thread of a personal relationship. Or once only: at sight of a
bare old clump of hills behind Geelong. Then he impulsively went
below to fetch Mary&mdash;Mary was packing the cabin furniture,
sewing up mattresses in the floor-carpeting, the mirror in the
blankets&mdash;and she, good-naturedly rising from her knees, for
to-day she had not the heart to refuse him anything, tied on her
bonnet and accompanied him on deck. There, standing arm-in-arm,
they thought and spoke of a certain unforgettable evening, now
years deep in the past.</p>

<p>"What greenhorns we were then, love, to be sure! So mercifully
ignorant of all the ups and downs in store for us."&mdash;But his
tone was light, even merry; for to-day the ups had it.</p>

<p>"Yet you seemed to me very old and wise, Richard. I suppose it
came of you wearing that horrid beard."</p>

<p>"And what a little sprite you were!&mdash;so shy and elusive.
There was no catching you...or getting a word in
edgeways&mdash;thanks to that poor old chattering Mother B and her
two bumpkins."</p>

<p>"Whom you couldn't tell apart...how that did make me laugh!"
said Mary To add with a sigh: "Poor Jinny! Little did we think she
would have to go so much sooner than the rest."</p>

<p>"My dear, a good half of that party is dust by now."</p>

<p>But no melancholy tinged the reflection. In his present mood,
Mahony accepted life, and the doom life implied, with cheerfullest
composure.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Hardly a letter received by Mary that morning but had besought
them to regard the writer's house as their own: they had only to
make their choice. "Yes, and give umbrage to all the rest.
Nonsense, Mary! We'll just slip off quietly to a hotel. We don't
need to consider the expense now, and shall be much freer and more
comfortable than if we tied ourselves down to stay with
people."</p>

<p>But Mahony's plan miscarried.</p>

<p>What a home-coming that was! No sooner had the ship cast anchor
than rowing-boats began to push off from the pier; while one that
had been lying on its oars made for them with all speed. Mary,
standing hatted and shawled for landing, looked, looked again,
rubbed her eyes and exclaimed: "Why, I do declare if it isn't
Tilly! Oh, <i>Richard</i>, what a difference the weeds make!" And
sure enough a few minutes later Tilly's head came bobbing up over
the side, and the two women lay in each other's arms half laughing,
half crying, drawing back, first one, then the other, the better to
fix her friend. Certainly Tilly had never shown to more advantage.
In old days her hats had been flagrant, her silks over-sumptuous,
her jewellery too loud. Now, the neat widow's bonnet with its white
frill and black hangings formed a becoming frame for her
yellow-brown hair, tanned skin and strong white teeth; the chains,
lockets and brooches of twenty-two-carat Ballarat gold had given
way to decorous jet; the soft black stuff of the dress moulded and
threw up every good point in the rich, full-bosomed figure.
Silently Mary noted and rejoiced. But Tilly, one glance snatched,
blurted out: "Well, I must say England 'asn't done much for you, my
dear! In all my days, Mary, never did I see you look so peaked and
pasty. Seasickness? Not it! It's that <i>horrible</i> climate
you've 'ad to put up with. I declare your very letters&mdash;with
their rain, rain, and fog, fog&mdash;used to gimme the blue devils.
Well! you've come back 'ere to the finest climate in the world.
We'll 'ave you up to the mark again in a brace o' shakes."</p>

<p>Further she did not get, for here now was John arriving&mdash;a
somewhat greyer and leaner John than they had left, but advancing
upon one, thought Mahony, with the same old air of: I am here; all
is well. Having cordially embraced his sister, John wrung his
brother-in&mdash;law's hand: "It would be false to pretend
surprise, my dear Mahony, at your decision to return to us." On his
heels came none other than Jerry and his wife: a fair, fragile slip
of a girl this&mdash;Australian-born and showing it, in a skin pale
as a white flower. Mary put her arms round the child&mdash;she was
scarcely more&mdash;and kissed her warmly; while in one breath the
little wife, who was all a-flutter and a-tremble, confided to her
how very, very much afraid she had felt of this meeting, knowing
Mary to be dear "Harry's" favourite sister; and how she hoped dear
Mary, please, wouldn't mind her calling him Harry, but she had once
had a dog named Jerry, a white dog with a black patch over one eye;
and it seemed so droll, didn't it? to call your husband by the same
name as a dog, especially such a funny-looking dog; although if
dear Mary wished it very, very much...all this gabbled off like a
lesson got by heart. Mary promptly reassured her: it was her good
right to call her husband by whatever name she chose, so long as he
did not mind; and that&mdash;with a loving glance at
Jerry&mdash;she would guarantee he didn't. Then she turned to her
brother. The same steady old sober-sides; but now grown quite the
man: broad of shoulder, richly whiskered, and, as could be seen at
a glance, the most devoted of husbands. Did his young wife speak to
some one, he tried to overhear what she was saying; watched the
effect of her words on the other; smiled in advance at her little
jokes, to incite the listener to smile, too&mdash;for all the world
after the fashion of a fond mother playing off her child. And when,
sprite-like, the girl ran to the other side of the ship, he took
the opportunity before following her to squeeze his sister's hand
and murmur: "<i>what</i> do you say to my little Fanny, Mary? Isn't
she perfect?"</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Jerry! If she's only half as good as she's
pretty...and I can see she is," said Mary returning the
squeeze.</p>

<p>Meanwhile quite a crowd had collected on the wharf, to which the
party was rowed in a boat so laden that, at moments, the ladies
instinctively held their breaths to lighten the load, and the
little bride shrank into the crook of her husband's arm. Here stood
Zara fluttering a morsel of cambric: she had feared an attack of
<i>mal de mer</i>, she whispered, did she embark on so choppy a
sea. ("We could hardly, I think, love, expect Zara to consider us
worth the half-guinea the boatmen were charging!" was Mahony's
postprandial comment.) Here were Agnes Ocock and Amelia Grindle
with sundry of their children, and the old Devines, and Trotty,
advanced to a hair-net, and John's three youngest in charge of
their schoolmistress; besides many a lesser friend and acquaintance
who had made light of the journey to the port. Hand after hand was
thrust forth with: "I trust I see you in prime health, ma'am?"
"Dear, dearest Mary! <i>How</i> we have missed you!" or: "Thought
you'd never hold it out over there, sir." "Delighted, doctor, I'm
sure, to welcome you back to our little potato-patch!" And those
who could not get near enough for more, along with a sprinkling of
curious strangers, enjoyed just forming the fringe of the crowd. It
was a pleasant break in the monotony of colonial life to catch a
glimpse of arrivals from overseas; to note the latest fashion in
hair and dress; to hear news and pick up gossip.</p>

<p>Mary had just stooped to the youngest of the children,
marvelling at its growth, when her ear caught an oddly familiar
sound, an uneven, thumping footfall, and turning quickly, whom in
all the world should she see but Purdy, out of breath and red in
the face, but otherwise looking just the same as of old, or at
least "not very different"&mdash;a phrase with which Mary had
already covered a marked change in more than one present: John's
singular spareness of rib, Zara's greying front, Agnes's florid
cheeks, the wizened-apple aspect of Amelia Grindle. In Purdy's case
it cloaked a shining-through of the cranium, did he bare his head;
more than a hint of coming stoutness; a cheap and flashy style of
dress. First, though, she shot a lightning glance at Richard: how
would he take this sudden apparition? The look reassured her: he
was to-day uplifted above all ordinary prejudice. There was just an
instant's hesitation, and then he himself stepped forward, both
hands outheld, one to grasp Purdy's right, the other to clap on his
shoulder; while his: "Dickybird, my boy! How are you?...how are
you?" came simultaneously with Purdy's: "Dick, old man, I heard
your tub was in. I thought I'd just trot along and give you a
pawshake."&mdash;And thus the old bond was cemented anew.</p>

<p>Thought Mary: was there any end to the good things with which
this day was full?</p>

<p>Drawn to the group, Purdy came in for his share of the welcome.
For he had not been back to Ballarat since his abrupt departure
some years previously; and his former friends and acquaintances
hailed him with the lively interest and curiosity peculiar to
people who see but few fresh faces, and never forget an old
one.</p>

<p>He shook hands all round. When it came to Tilly: "I need hardly
introduce you two, I think!" said Mary slyly.</p>

<p>Tilly burst into a roar. "I should say not, indeed! Why, my
dear, I can remember 'im when 'e was only <i>so</i>
'igh,"&mdash;and she measured a foot from the ground.</p>

<p>Purdy capped her fiction. "Is that all? Why, you lisped your
first prayer at my knee."</p>

<p>But the children grew peevish; it was time to make a move. At
the first breathing of the word hotel, however, such a chorus of
dissent broke out that Mahony's plan had there and then to be let
drop. Not a guest-chamber, it seemed, but had been swept and
dressed for them&mdash;John's excepted, John still leading a
bachelor life at the Melbourne Club. Even Jerry and his bride had
made ready their tiny weatherboard; and here Jerry put his lips to
Mary's ear to say how inconsolable little Fanny would be if they
went elsewhere: she had sat stitching till past midnight at
wonderful bows for bed and window-hangings&mdash;a performance
which, in the young husband's eyes, far outweighed the fact of
their living miles out, at Heidelberg, to which place a coach ran
but at ten of a morning; so that the present night would have to be
spent in Melbourne, under the bride's father's roof. Had Mary been
free to please herself, she would have waived all other
considerations rather than disappoint the youthful pair. But
Richard! She could hear his amused and sarcastic ha-ha, at the idea
of "camping out" with utter strangers for the pleasure of next
morning being "carted off" to Heidelberg. Meanwhile, on her other
side Fanny was whispering: just fancy, Harry hadn't been able to
tell her what dear Mary's complexion was, whether blonde or
brunette. She had chosen pink for her bows, because pink suited
most people, and she had clapped her hands on finding she was
right; but she thought she would have sunk through the floor, had
she hit on blue. And when Mary laughingly declared that blue was
one of her favourite colours, and that even in yellow or green the
trimmings would have been equally appreciated, little Fanny bit her
lip and looked as if she were going to cry.&mdash;All this in a
rapid aside.</p>

<p>The Devines won the day&mdash;after a heated discussion in which
everybody spoke at once. These good people had actually a
carriage-and-pair in waiting, that the travellers might be spared
the brief railway journey from port to town; as well as a
spring-cart for the baggage. There was no standing out against Mrs.
Devine's persuasions, seconded as they were by the M.L.C. himself,
who from a modest place in the background threw in, whenever he got
the chance: "My 'ouse is entirely at your disposal, sir. We beg you
and your good lady will do us the honour."</p>

<p>"Indeed and I'll <i>not take no</i>!" declared his wife; and,
under a pair of nodding, hearse-like plumes, her fat, rosy face
beamed on those about her, after the manner of a big red sun. "'Tis
a great hempty barn, that's what it is, and I've looked to this day
to fill it. Why, dearie, so's not to 'ear quite so much of me own
footsteps, I've been and taken in one o' Jake's sister's 'usband's
sister's children."</p>

<p>Thus the Mahonys found themselves rolling townwards in the
Devines' well-hung landau, on their knees a picnic-basket
containing port wine and sandwiches with which to refresh and
sustain the inner man.</p>

<p>Mahony fell silent as the wheels revolved; a smile played round
his lips. He was laughing at himself for having imagined that it
would be necessary to explain away his reappearance in these
people's midst. One and all had followed John's lead in finding his
return to Australia&mdash;Australia <i>facile
princeps</i>!&mdash;the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>At South Yarra they became the occupants of the largest
guest-chamber in a brand-new mansion, which counted every comfort
and luxury the upholsterers had known how to cram into it, and now
only needed really to be lived in. Its stiff formality reminded
Mary, the homemaker, of the specimen rooms set out in a great
furniture warehouse; rooms in which no living creature has yet left
a trace. Her fingers itched to break up the prim rows of chairs
ranged against the walls; lightly to disarrange albums; to leave on
antimacassars the impress of a head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Devine having finally satisfied herself that they had
everything they had everything they required&mdash;; down to a
plump and well-studded pincushion on which the pins wrote
"Welcome!"&mdash;for: "I've no faith in them giddy girls,
dearie,"&mdash;husband and wife were at last alone together.</p>

<p>"Whew!" breathed Mahony, and sinking into an armchair he fanned
himself with his handkerchief. "Well! I sincerely hope you're
satisfied, Mary. Royalty itself could not ask for a warmer welcome
than you have had, my dear." But he smiled again as he spoke; and
the usual edge to his words was wanting.</p>

<p>"You, too," said Mary, who was fighting the lock of a carpetbag.
Then she laughed. "As if royalty ever got hugged, and kissed, and
slapped on the back! But indeed, Richard, I shall never, never
forget the kindness that's been shown us. And what a lovely house
this is! I mean, could be made."</p>

<p>"My dear, you shall have as good&mdash;and better. Rather much
oilcloth here for my taste. The grounds, too, struck me as
stiffish, what I saw of them." Rising to take another look through
a raised slat of the venetian, he turned and beckoned his wife.
"What do you say to this, Mary?" Peeping over his shoulder she saw
their host, in comfortable corduroys, without his coat, his
shirt-sleeves rolled up above his elbows, trundling a loaded
wheelbarrow. Said Mahony: "Seems to have turned into a very decent
sort of fellow indeed, does our good Cincinnatus."</p>

<p>"Who?...Mr. Devine? Yes, hasn't he? I thought it most tactful of
him to be quiet in the carriage, when he saw you didn't want to
talk."</p>

<p>Below, on a dinner-table built to accommodate a score, a
veritable banquet had been spread. They sat down to it at six
o'clock, a large family party. For on the wharf Mrs. Devine, as
winner, had scattered her invitations broadcast, even insisting on
Tilly exchanging her hotel for the second-best spare room. Zara was
there, together with Jerry and his wife, and John, and Trotty, who
hung on one of Aunt Mary's arms as did pretty Fanny on the other;
and the health of the home-comers and the happy change in Mahony's
fortunes were drunk to in bumpers of champagne. By every one but
the master of the house; before whose plate stood a jug of
barley-water. In the intervals of signalling to the servants where
to put the dishes, and whose glass or plate stood empty, Mrs.
Devine, purply moist with gratification and excitement, drew
Mahony's attention to this jug with a nudge and a wink.</p>

<p>"Your doin', doctor...all thanks to you. Jake took the pledge
that time you know of, and never 'as 'e broke it since, no matter
where 'e is or in 'oos company." She actually laid her pudgy hand
on Mahony's and gave it a warm squeeze.</p>

<p>"Very creditable...very creditable indeed," murmured Mahony,
stiff with embarrassment lest his host should overhear what was
being said.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Devine had already telegraphed to her husband down the
length of the table; and the good man smiled and nodded, and sipped
his barley-water in Mahony's direction.</p>

<p>The ladies withdrawing and Jerry sidling out soon after, the
three men pulled their chairs closer; and now colonial affairs took
the place of family gossip and perfunctory inquiries about "home."
As fellow-members of the Legislative Council, John and Devine had
become fast friends. It was also in the wind, it seemed, that
Devine might be called on to form a ministry. Puzzled by the many
changes, the new men and new names that had come up during his
absence, Mahony acted chiefly the listener; but the interested
listener, for it was gratifying to find himself once more at the
fountain-head. His companions' talk, ranging over a great variety
of topics, harked back yet and again to the great natural
catastrophe in the face of which legislation was
powerless&mdash;the unprecedented drought which, already in its
fourth year, was ruining the squatters, compelling them to part
with thousands on thousands of dying sheep, for the price of the
skins alone.</p>

<p>In listening Mahony eyed the two men up and down. His bearded
host looked sound as a bell. But it was otherwise with
John&mdash;"He's a shocking bad colour,"&mdash;and knowing his
brother-in-law to be of temperate habits, he resolved to have a
word with him in private.</p>

<p>It grew late: for over an hour John's horses had pawed the
gravel of the drive. Finally Mahony excused himself on grounds of
fatigue and ran upstairs. But he might have saved his haste. For
Mary had taken her hairbrush and gone to Tilly's room. There, a
fresh log having been thrown on the whitewashed hearth, the two
women sat and talked far into the night.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-2" id="ch-2-2-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>Mahony's first lightning plan of putting up his plate at the top
of Collins Street, among the bigwigs of the profession, was not
carried out. For when, the day after landing, he went to interview
Simmonds, his man of business, he found his affairs in even more
brilliant condition than Simmonds' letter&mdash;written a fortnight
back to await the ship's arrival&mdash;had led him to believe. That
had put the sum lying to his credit at between ten and eleven
thousand pounds. By now, however&mdash;a second company in which he
was interested choosing the self-same moment to look
up&mdash;combined dividends were flowing in at the rate of twelve
to fifteen hundred pounds a month. And this, despite the enormous
outlay incurred by the Australia Felix Company in sinking a fourth
shaft, lighting the mine throughout with gas, erecting the heaviest
plant yet seen on the goldfields.</p>

<p>In the conveyance that left Collins Street at midday for South
Yarra, Mahony sat feeling mildly stunned by the extent of his good
fortune, as by Simmonds' confident prediction of still grander
things to come; sat with far-away eyes, absently noting the velvety
black shadows that accompanied vehicles and pedestrians up and down
the glaring whiteness of the great street. He had already drawn
attention to himself by smiling broadly at thought of the news he
was taking home to Mary. Now, as a fresh idea struck him, he
uttered a smothered exclamation and tried to slap his knee a
gesture that entangled him with a stout party whose crinoline
overflowed him, and gave a pimply faced youth sitting opposite a
chance to exercise his wit.</p>

<p>"Fy, matey, fy! What 'ud our missis say?"</p>

<p>The vehicle&mdash;a kind of roofless omnibus&mdash;started with
a lunge that sent the two rows of passengers toppling like ninepins
one against another. Mahony alone raised his voice in apology: he
had lain on the shoulder of the fat woman. The man on her farther
side angrily bade her take her danged feathers out of his eye. The
greater number recovered their balance by thrusting forth an elbow
and lodging it firmly in a neighbour's rib.</p>

<p>Even in his present holiday mood this promiscuity was too much
for Mahony. He regretted not having accepted Devine's offer of a
buggy; and half-way to his destination dismounted, and covered the
rest of the distance on foot.</p>

<p>This was better. In the outlying district where he found
himself, no traffic moved. Roads and paths were sandy and
grass-edged. The scattered houses lay far back in their gardens,
screened by rows of Scotch firs. He met no one, could think in
peace; and over a knotty point he stopped short and dug with his
stick in the sand.</p>

<p>The brilliant idea that had flashed through his mind in the
omnibus was: why go back into harness at all? Retire!...retire and
live on his dividends...here was the solution. From now on be free
to devote himself to the things that really mattered, in which he
had hitherto had no share.</p>

<p>He threshed the scheme out as he went, and was plain-spoken with
himself. I am now a middle-aged man: forty-three and a quarter to
be exact in point of time, but a good ten years older with regard
to bodily health...and disillusionment: considerably more than
halfway, that is, on my journey to the green sod. And what have I
so far had of life? It has been but one long grind: firstly to keep
my head above water, and then, to live up to my neighbours; while
every attempt to free myself has failed, the last great wild-goose
chase most completely of any. Yes, the real trouble has always been
want of money &mdash;of money and time&mdash;or of money enough to
have time. Now that the one has fallen to me, should I not be a
fool beyond compare if I failed to master the other? Think of all
the wonders of this world I shall die without knowing&mdash;the
books I shall not have read, the scientific discoveries, the
intellectual achievements I shall never have heard of. Oh! the joy
of devoting one's remaining years to a congenial occupation. One
cannot love one's work, the handle one grinds by&mdash;the notion
that such a thing is possible belongs to a man's green and salad
days. Though perhaps if one climbed to the top of the tree...But
for the majority of us, the fact that we labour to earn our bread
by a certain handiwork wears all liking for it threadbare. It
becomes a habit&mdash;like the meals one eats...the clothes one
puts on of a morning.&mdash;Ambitions to be sacrificed? But are
there? I had them once; in plenty. Where are they now? Blown into
thin air&mdash;spent like smoke. The fag of living was too much for
them. And so, in following my bent, I should sacrifice
nothing&mdash;or nothing but the possibility of fresh
humiliations...and much unnecessary pother...an infinitude of
business...Thus he reasoned, thus justified himself to himself,
arriving at the house with his arguments marshalled ready to be
laid before Mary. The walk, however, had taken longer than he
expected; the afternoon was now far advanced and he footsore and
hungry. But though he could hear the servants chattering in the
kitchen, none came to offer him so much as a cup of tea. They would
of course suppose him to have lunched; or else Madam D. had the
keys of the larder in her petticoat pocket. The big house yawned
inhospitably still and empty&mdash;but for a common-looking child
in copper-toed boots and oilcloth apron, which he unexpectedly ran
across: it fled from him like a startled cat. Mary was out driving
with her hostess and did not get back till close on dinner-time.
There was another party that night; they sat down fifteen to table
and went to bed only in the small hours. He could do no more than
skim the cream off his interview for her benefit, before
retiring.</p>

<p>His chance came next morning.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock had struck, but Mary was still in bedgown and
slippers, her hair tied in its nightly bunch of half a dozen little
plaits on the crown of her head. This state of undress did not,
however, imply that she had newly risen&mdash;as a matter of fact
she had been up and doing for a couple of hours. But it was one of
the rules of this extraordinary house that visitors did not
breakfast till after ten; the longer after, the better, but at any
moment <i>past</i> the hour, provided that the servants did not
know beforehand what it would be: they must be kept up to the mark,
hover perpetually alert for the ringing of the dining-room bell:
and many and scathing were Richard's comments on the practice of
using your guests as the stick with which to belabour your slaves.
Mrs. Devine herself, clad in a voluminous paisley gown, her
nightcap bound under her chin, was early astir: she gave her
husband, who rose at dawn to work among his flowers&mdash;as he had
once worked among his market produce&mdash;breakfast at eight,
before he left for town. But if you belonged to the elite, were
truly <i>bon ton</i>, you did not descend till the morning was half
over, and even then must appear "stifling elegant yawns, which show
the effort it has been to tear your high-born limbs from the
feathers!"&mdash;so ran another of Richard's glosses. The first
morning he and Mary had blundered in this respect; on the second
they were wiser; and now loitered chilly and hungry above-stairs.
Chafing at the absurdity and fretting for his breakfast, Mahony
grumbled: "Was there ever such a fudge? As if the woman didn't know
I used to have to be up at daybreak, if necessary...was in my
consulting-room hours before this."</p>

<p>Mary, who had been writing letters and sewing, began to dress
her hair. "Do try not to fuss so, dear. After all, it's only a
little thing. It pleases her to imagine she's up in the ways of
good society. Besides, every house has its peculiarities."</p>

<p>"Then give me my own, thank you. But what absurd nonsense you do
talk, Mary! I'm sure, when you had 'em, you never tyrannised over
guests in this stark fashion. You were their drudge, my dear;
danced to their tune. But I believe you'd sacrifice the last scrap
of your personal comfort to pander to the foibles of other
people."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Mary stoutly. "But we can't possibly let her
see we don't like it."</p>

<p>She had unbound her hair: freed from its plaits, it hung all
crinks and angles. Now she set, with long, smooth sweeps, to
brushing it to its customary high gloss.</p>

<p>Mahony pulled a chair to the window, threw up the sash and leant
his elbow on the sill. The morning was warm and balmy, after a
bitterly cold night. By midday the sun would have gained almost
summer strength, gradually to fade through the autumn of the
afternoon till, with darkness, you were back in a wintry spring.
The orange-blossom scent of the pittosperums, now everywhere in
flower, filled the air. Sunning himself thus, he fell to informing
Mary yet once again what he had made up his mind to; spoke shortly
and impatiently and with decision. For this time at least he knew
that his planning involved his wife in no hardships: he was not
asking her to shoulder fresh burdens.</p>

<p>Practised hand though she was at concealing surprise, and
rightly attributing Richard's snappishness to the want of a good
hot cup of coffee, Mary could not help echoing his words, her
hairbrush suspended in the air. "Give up practice altogether?" And,
at his emphatic affirmation: "But, Richard, you'd soon get tired of
having nothing to do."</p>

<p>"Nothing to do indeed! I, who all my life have longed for a
little leisure to follow my own pursuits! Haven't I told you, Mary,
again and again, that if I were to read from sunrise to sundown,
for the rest of my days, I shouldn't get through a quarter of the
books that are waiting for me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, don't talk such rubbish. As if you could spend all
the rest of your life reading! Why, I've often heard you say, after
sitting with your head in a book for even a few hours running, that
it felt like a boiled turnip."</p>

<p>"But, good God!...I shall have a garden, I suppose?...and a
decent horse to ride?"</p>

<p>"Now, Richard, it's no use mincing words: you do tire easily of
things &mdash;much more easily than other people. And I'm sure
you'd tire of idleness as well. After working as you have."</p>

<p>"Oh, go on acting the brake on the coach. I suppose that, too,
is a mission in life."</p>

<p>"How you do snap one up! There's this about it, of course, you
<i>could</i> go back into practice at any time if you wanted to."
("Thank you, never again for me!") "You only say that now, Richard.
In a couple of years you may have completely changed your mind. No,
it's not a bit of good getting angry. I think it's a step that
requires most careful consideration. Besides you promised,
remember, not so <i>very</i> long ago, to be guided next time by
what I thought."</p>

<p>"So I did. But here the case is different&mdash;entirely
different. Not twopenceworth of risk is entailed. I have no
intention of speculating further, as you ought to know&mdash;if you
know anything at all about me&mdash;and, well invested, this money
that has fallen to us is enough to keep us in comfort to our lives'
end."</p>

<p>But Mary refused to be rushed into a decision.</p>

<p>The long, elaborate breakfast over: they had to eat their way
through chops and steaks, eggs and rissoles, barracouta and
garfish, fruit, hot rolls, preserves, tea and coffee: breakfast
coped with, Mary waited, dressed for driving, for the carriage to
come round, and for her hostess to cease goading on her several
maidservants and tracking down their misdeeds. Propping her chin in
her hand and poking with the tip of her parasol at one of the
fruit-and-flower baskets enworked in the maroon ground of the
Brussels carpet, Mary wrestled with the problem of their future.
Richard's present project called for a readjustment of all her
private plans for his benefit. These had never wavered; remained
those she had hatched on the morrow of the Buddlecombe fiasco; and
throughout the voyage she had listened in silence to his fluid
plannings and imaginings what he was going to do next&mdash;had
just listened and let him talk. Ballarat had seen his beginnings;
seen his rise to one of its most popular medical men: it should
also, she was resolved, learn to know him as the moneyed consultant
who could afford to see as few patients as he wished. It was
ridiculous for him to think of starting all over again in a strange
place, when there, in Ballarat, was his old reputation waiting for
him. What was the point of success either, if it did not come to
you among the friends of your less palmy days?</p>

<p>But his intention to retire into private life cut clean through
these aspirations. And yet, for the first time, Mary hesitated. The
difference was, what he now proposed made a subtle appeal to her.
For, to be nothing, to have neither trade nor profession, to fold
one's hands and live on one's income&mdash;that was the <i>ne plus
ultra</i> of colonial society, the ideal tirelessly to be striven
after. Work brought neither honour nor glory where all too many had
been manual labourers, the work itself of a low or disreputable
kind. And the contingency of Richard ending as the private
gentleman, the leisured man of means, had never been wholly absent
from Mary's mind&mdash;or wouldn't have been, had he not so
quixotically cut his career in half.</p>

<p>There was another point, too: was anybody better fitted than he
to live as the gentleman? Where so many floundered like fish out of
water, he would be entirely in his element. If <i>only</i> she
could have felt surer of him! But thanks to Buddlecombe she knew
that, no matter how fixed he seemed, at the first trifling
unpleasantness&mdash;a hint, for example, that medically he was on
the shelf&mdash;he would be up and off to prove the contrary;
perhaps again, as on the last occasion, not even condescending to
tell her where the trouble lay. Oh dear! it <i>would</i> be nice to
have a husband who saw things sensibly and practically&mdash;as one
did oneself. How the two of them could then have put their heads
together. Instead of her always having to make allowance for
unreckonable impulses.</p>

<p>One comfort: there was no more talk on his part of going "home"
with his fortune. The old foolish idea that he would be happier in
England had been knocked on the head. At considerable expense, and
much worry and trouble, poor old Richard! Still, if he <i>would</i>
buy his experience in this costly fashion...Here, however, her
musings were cut short by the entrance of Mrs. Devine in shawl and
bonnet, and struggling to button a magenta kid glove across a palm
not built for such a covering: it bulged through the opening,
creased and rolled with fat. The good lady was keyed up to a high
pitch with domestic disasters&mdash;a chipped wineglass, a scrap of
flue found under a bed&mdash;"Liars and deceivers every one,
dearie!" But the great red face beamed with goodwill. No malice was
in it; only the delights of the chase; so that the onlooker was
reluctantly driven to conclude that Mrs. Devine heartily enjoyed
her slave-driving.</p>

<p>And her private doubts and scruples notwithstanding, Mary could
not but feel pleased and proud, for Richard's sake, at the stir
caused by the announcement that he had no further need to practise
medicine. Congratulations showered on him. Himself, he laughed, in
his new, happy fashion. "I declare, so much fuss they make, I might
have discovered the North Pole." And having got him safely away
from the tyrannic rules Mrs. Devine considered essential to his
comfort&mdash;or the comfort of his blue blood&mdash;and settled in
a furnished house near the Carlton Gardens, Mary prepared to guide
him gently and imperceptibly along the road she thought it for his
good he should go. In doing this, however, she found herself up
against a stone wall, in the shape of a hitherto unsuspected trait
in Richard: a violent aversion from returning on his traces. When
it dawned on him that she was still hankering after Ballarat, he
lost his temper, and vowed with the utmost vehemence that
<i>when</i> he was done with a place he <i>was</i> done, and wild
horses shouldn't drag him back to it.</p>

<p>"Good God, Mary! one's dead self would confront one at every
turn. Here one did this, there that. You don't stock-take, my dear,
when you're going on living in a place; but a break&mdash;and even
a brief one&mdash;forces you to it...in murderous fashion. I should
thank you for the constant reminder how life is flying, and how
little one has made of it, and what a fool one was in the past, and
yet how full of hopes and aspirations."&mdash;With cobwebby stuff
such as this, there was no coming to grips.</p>

<p>No, it was to be Melbourne this time. What was more, he had
resolved to build his own house. He was sick to death of suiting
his needs to those of other people.</p>

<p><i>Build?</i>...well yes, there was something to be said for it:
Mary hastily swallowed her dismay, seeing his feathers rise in
earnest. Build?...before he knew anything about a locality? Why, a
neighbour's fowls only needed to cackle or crow too early of a
morning, railway-whistles or church-bells sound too plainly, and
all his peace and pleasure would be gone. She was not going to risk
any such contingency as that, thank you! And having wormed the
information out of him that he leaned to the district lying between
St. Kilda and Brighton, she took John into confidence, and John and
she laid their heads together to circumvent his harebrained scheme.
A string or two was pulled; and one day, while Richard and she were
driving round looking for a site, they happened, as if by chance,
on the very house to suit them. One, too, that was not yet in the
public market. As John had foreseen, Richard lost his heart to it
on the spot, and before the week was out had become its
owner.&mdash;Well! buying offhand was bad enough; but a good deal
less risky than building.</p>

<p>Houses in Melbourne were of two types: either spacious, white,
two-storeyed buildings almost as broad as they were long, with
balcony and verandah to the front, and needing but to stand in a
sandy compound to advertise their origin; or low, sprawly villas a
single storey high, Covering much ground space, and wearing their
circlet of verandah like a shady hat. Mahony's purchase was of this
latter kind.</p>

<p>Built some ten years previously, by a wealthy squatter who was
now about to become a permanent absentee, it stood within half an
hour's walk of the Brighton beach, on a quiet, sandy road the edges
of which were fringed with grass and capeweed. The grounds, running
to between four and five acres, were well stocked and fully grown;
and included kitchen and flower-gardens, a couple of croquet lawns
and a fair-sized orchard. From the gates, no glimpse of the house
could be caught, so thick were the protecting shrubberies, so
closely set the Scotch firs. These grounds turned the scales for
Mahony. To get a garden&mdash;and such a garden!&mdash;ready-made,
instead of having to wait for it to grow. In the house itself the
only alteration he planned was a large study to be thrown out on
the orchard side. Otherwise it suited them to a nicety.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-3" id="ch-2-2-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>While Richard haunted his new property and egged on the workmen,
or sat drawing up a list of books for dispatch to an Edinburgh
bookseller, Mary devoted herself to unravelling the knots and
tangles into which the several members of her family had tied
themselves. And after for two years having had to deal exclusively
with a difficult, faddy person like Richard, she found this a
comparatively simple job. Those to whose aid she now came saw
things from the same angle as herself, and they spoke a common
language.</p>

<p>Zara had first innings. Seated in the drawing-room of the
Carlton house, Zara poured out her woes, with much drying of eyes
and the old, old recriminations against John. Never, she wept, had
she met any one so hard, so self-centred. He was also too stingy to
lift a finger to help you; and, in her opinion, richly deserved the
misfortunes that had befallen him&mdash;Emma's untimely death, and
the loss of Jinny; the disgrace of Johnny's flight and Trotty's
misdemeanours. Who could wonder at it, if he treated wives and
children as he was now treating her?</p>

<p>"But, Zara..."</p>

<p>Oh, John had the influence, could do it <i>easily</i> if he
chose. But for that, he was too down on the match. As if his own
second marriage had been anything to boast of! Pray, who was Jinny?
A publican's daughter...and, if the truth were told, common as
dirt. But&mdash; "I'm still utterly in the dark, Zara. Who is it
John objects to...that you want to marry?"</p>

<p>"Not I want to marry, if you please, Mary!" Zara's tone was acid
as a lemon. "It's <i>quite</i> the other way about. If it only
rested with me..."</p>

<p>"Yes, but <i>who?</i>"</p>

<p>"Haven't you wits enough to guess, my dear? Who is it that has
followed me and pestered&mdash;yes, <i>pestered!</i>&mdash;me with
his attentions, ever since my first visit to Ballarat?"</p>

<p>Ballarat? Her first visit? "Zara! You surely don't mean..."</p>

<p>"My dear, I have not a heart of <i>stone</i>&mdash;like
<i>some</i> people I could mention! I can stand out no longer
against his prayers and persuasions. Year after year, year after
year&mdash;not <i>many</i> women, Mary, can boast of having
inspired such devotion. He worships the very ground I
tread&mdash;and has done ever since those early days...though I was
then little more than a child. Of course, I am aware he is not my
equal..."</p>

<p>"Oh, good gracious, what does that matter if you really care for
him? I've no patience with nonsense of that kind."</p>

<p>Mary spoke with a robust heartiness; but her thoughts were
elsewhere, and travelled swiftly. In the two years that had elapsed
since last she saw her, Zara had crossed a subtle boundary, and,
from being a youngish person who looked a trifle worn and tired,
had turned into an elderly person who looked young for her age:
which made all the difference in the world. For, alas! Zara's
features were not of that well-boned type, whose cameo outlines
show up even better in the middle years than under the plump
padding of youth. Short, irregular, piquant, they had depended on
freshness and round contours for their charm. Now that the dimples
had run to lines, the cheeks hollowed, the skin sagged, Zara wore
the pathetic aspect of a faded child. When she drooped her fine
eyes, it was really sad, to one who loved her, to see how haggard
and old she looked. Poor Zara! All her choice offers and good
chances come to nothing. She had dangled them too long; been over
fastidious; and now it was too late. Mary could read this out of
what she said: this and more. Even the posts open to her as
finishing-governess were not, it appeared, what they had once been.
Younger women, competent to teach the new&mdash;fangled
"callisthenics," and dull, dry pieces by "Mosar" instead of the
tuneful <i>Morceaux</i> in which Zara excelled, were now getting
the plums. It did seem a shame, considering Zara's talents, and her
long experience but so it was. Perhaps she had grown a trifle
"scratchy" with the years. Her elegant sprightliness was certainly
deserting her, giving place to a kind of fixed pettishness. And so,
having turned the matter over, Mary soothed her by promising to do
all she could to further the marriage. She would beard John in his
den, and urge him to use his influence&mdash;according to Zara he
was on friendly terms with a prominent member of the Baptist
Union&mdash;to procure for her intended, who was still but an
unsalaried "helper," the pastorate that would enable them to
wed.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, you must bring Hemp...Mr. Hempel to see us."</p>

<p>As visiting John at the Melbourne Club was out of the question,
Mary took the only slightly less bold step of calling at the great
warehouse in Flinders Lane. And having climbed a dark, steep stair
to the first storey, and passed through various rooms where clerks,
perched on high stools, stole curious glances at the apparition of
a silk-and-velvet-clad lady whispered to be the senior partner's
sister: this ordeal behind her, she arrived, a trifle pink and
confused, at the door of John's sanctum.</p>

<p>John himself emerged to meet her.</p>

<p>"Yes, John, quite alone...I hope you won't mind. But I wanted
very much to see you." And having regained breath and composure,
Mary lost no time in going straight to the core of Zara's
business.</p>

<p>John listened, with a patience he would have shown no one else,
his dark eyes, so like Mary's own, yet so much older in worldly
wisdom, turned intently on her.&mdash;"Objections to her marrying?
My dear girl, as far as I personally am concerned, my sister Zara
may wed a navvy if she chooses&mdash;always provided he has the
means to support her, once the knot is tied. But this
Methody-fellow now...have you seen him? No? Then pray do so,
without delay. After which, let me hear if you are still of the
same mind."</p>

<p>"Your sister Zara," he went on, "admits to having laid by, in
the course of her governessing, some five hundred pounds: knowing
her as we do, seven or eight hundred would, I make no doubt, be
nearer the mark. This sum, well invested, will ensure her yearly
some eighty or ninety pounds&mdash;not a princely income, I dare
say, but sufficient for the requirements of an unmarried female.
Should she, however, fritter away her savings on this
what's-his-name, it would, in the event of his decease, fall to her
relatives to support her. Which I for one am not disposed to
do."</p>

<p>Mary had refrained from interrupting. Now, nothing daunted, she
insisted on John viewing the case from Zara's standpoint: the very
natural desire of an ageing woman for a home and a husband; the
dreaded stigma of old-maidism; the weariness and monotony of going
on teaching other people's children year after year; the
mortification of seeing younger women chosen over your head, and
your salary steadily decreasing as you grew older. And finally, by
dint of what she afterwards described to Richard as "this, that,
and the other thing," she got John so far as to promise that if,
after seeing the bridegroom-elect, she still thought the marriage
should go forward, he would do what lay in his power to procure for
Hempel the pastorate in the little up-country township of
Wangawatha, on which Zara had set her heart.</p>

<p>This accomplished, Mary drew on her gloves, which she had
removed for the sherry and biscuits brought forth by John from a
cupboard, with a "Both dry unfortunately, my dear girl, since I am
not often honoured by visits from the sweet-toothed sex."</p>

<p>"And does business flourish, John?"</p>

<p>"It does, Mary. Yes, on that score I have nothing to complain
of&mdash;nothing whatever. As you will have observed, we have
recently made considerable additions to the premises, and young
MacDermott has been definitely taken into partnership. Still, as
far as I myself am concerned, I confess there come moments when in
spite of everything I look round me and ask: <i>cui bono</i>? For
whom do I build?...since there is no one to step into my shoes when
I am gone."</p>

<p>John and <i>cui bono</i>!...John to talk of being "gone"! Mary's
eyes widened and darkened. But she did not let the opportunity
slip. "Look here, John, what I have always been meaning to say: I
firmly intend to try and find out what has become of
Johnny&mdash;and if possible get him home again. It seems dreadful
to me that a boy of that age, and one I was so fond of, too, should
just disappear and perhaps never be heard of again. I feel
convinced there was nothing radically wrong; and can't help
thinking he'd be ready to come back after this taste of hardship,
and settle down, and make you proud of him."</p>

<p>Was it fancy, or did a new expression flit over John's face at
her words?&mdash;a kind of hope look out of his eyes? If so, it was
gone again at once, drowned in the harsh expression he seemed to
reserve for poor Emma's children. "Nay, I have washed my hands of
him, Mary. He has publicly disgraced me. And from all I hear, I
fear his sister is about to follow the example he has set her."</p>

<p>At this Mary laughed outright. "Really, John! I'm surprised at
you: letting yourself be imposed on by the tales of some prim old
school-marm. You wait; I mean to have Trotty down to stay with me;
and then I'll very soon find out the truth about her. Besides, you
know you <i>can't</i> wash your hands of your children like this;
it's unnatural. I wish to goodness I could see you comfortably
settled in your own house once more, with them all about you. This
is very well, but it <i>isn't</i> home."&mdash;And Mary's glance
swept the leaded windows, the cobwebbed corners, the white dust on
books and papers, the dimness of the office furniture; to end with
John himself. To her eye he had a rather uncared-for appearance
nowadays; looked unbrushed, much less spruce than of old.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" John, his elbows on the arms of his chair, lightly
met his ten fingers and tipped them, to a shrug of the shoulders.
"Ah! had it pleased the Almighty to make women other than they
are&mdash;yourself excepted, my dear Mary, always excepted. But
that reminds me. I have been intending for some time past to ask
you to drive out and go over the house, and report to me on its
condition. The last person I placed in charge proved as
untrustworthy as the rest."</p>

<p>Stowing away the key in her petticoat pocket, Mary gladly
undertook the commission. And as she jogged homewards in a
wagonette, she felt well satisfied with what she had achieved; and
not on Zara's score alone. "Poor old John! He doesn't <i>know</i>
how lonely and uncomfortable he is. Or how, in his heart of hearts,
he's fretting for that boy."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after considerable shilly-shallying, Zara had
introduced Hempel afresh, in what proved an exceedingly painful
visit.</p>

<p>"I declare," said Mary afterwards, "every time I spoke, I seemed
to put my foot in it."</p>

<p>To begin with, it was plain at once what John had meant by his:
wait till you have seen him! Hempel was now but the shadow of his
former self, shrunken, emaciated, with over-bright eyes, and a dry
cough that took him in paroxysms, at the end of which he withdrew a
spotted handkerchief from his lips.</p>

<p>Zara looked so annoyed when this happened that Mary tried to
seem unobservant. But after one particularly violent explosion, the
words: "Oh, what do you do for it?" escaped her in spite of
herself.</p>

<p>"It's <i>nothing</i> in the world but dust," cut in Zara
smartly. "I vow Carlton to be the dustiest suburb in all Melbourne.
How you came to select it amazes me&mdash;positively it does!"</p>

<p>"I look upon it as a righteous affliction, ma'am," said Hempel
loudly and slowly, and as though Zara had not spoken. "Such things
are sent to try us. 'Oom the Lord loveth 'e chasteneth."</p>

<p>"Besides he is perfectly well able to control it if he
chooses."&mdash;Zara was so caustic that Mary hurriedly made a
diversion by inviting her upstairs. And curiosity to hear a
detailed account of the interview with John got the better of
Zara's patent reluctance to leave the two men alone together.</p>

<p>"He looks dreadfully delicate, Zara," said Mary dubiously, when
the bedroom door had shut behind them.</p>

<p>"My dear Mary, a change of climate is <i>all</i> that is
necessary. We have taken the very <i>best</i> medical advice. I
truly hope Richard will not go putting any far-fetched notions into
his head." And overriding Mary's delicate inquiries with a
dramatic: "The happiness of my life is at stake!" Zara declined a
chair, swept her crinoline about the room, and having greedily
extracted the gist of John's promises, knew no peace till they
returned to the parlour.</p>

<p>Hempel&mdash;he now wore a short, woolly beard round face and
throat&mdash;had certainly improved in his way of speaking. Still
he did have lapses; and these Zara accentuated and underlined in
distressing fashion. Throughout the visit she sat bolt upright on
the extreme edge of her chair, almost prompting the words into
Hempel's mouth; while, at every misplaced or unaccomplished "h,"
she half-closed her eyes and drew in her breath with a semi-audible
groan, as if the aspirate were a missile that had struck her.
Hempel alone remained undisturbed by her behaviour. Richard, Mary
knew, would be fuming inwardly at such tactlessness; and her own
discomfiture was so acute that she trebled the warmth of her manner
towards the unfortunate man.</p>

<p>"And what are we to call you?" she asked, as Zara rose to go.
"Mister sounds too stiff altogether for a relation."</p>

<p>Instantly she saw that, with this well-meant question, she had
made another mistake. Zara turned a dark red, and flashing a
warning glance at Hempel began a hurried babble of adieux. But
Hempel was either too dense or too obstinate to see.</p>

<p>"My name, ma'am, is Ebenezer." ("Edgar, Mary, Edgar is what I
call him!") "Yes, Miss Turn'am 'ere"&mdash;and so saying, Hempel
signified Zara, without looking at her, by an odd little outward
jerk of the elbow and a smile that struck even Mary as
malicious&mdash;"Miss Turn'am don't cotton to it, and wants to
persuade me to fancy names. But I say the one as my parents chose
for me in the name of the Lord is good enough for me. So I'll be
obleeged by Ebenezer, if you please."</p>

<p>"It's in the Bible, too, isn't it?" threw in Mary, feeling, if
she did not see, the silent laughter with which Richard was
shaking. And to herself she thought: "Oh dear, won't he catch it
when he gets outside!"</p>

<p>"Ha ha! Serves her right...serves her very well right. Mrs.
Ebenezer! Why, of course, it comes back to me now." ("I felt sure
it was Edward&mdash;or I shouldn't have asked," said Mary ruefully.
"And now I shan't know what to call him.") "But I can tell you
this, my dear: Zara is about to commit a monstrous folly. The
fellow is far gone in phthisis. If she wants a job as sick-nurse,
she'll get it&mdash;and upon my word, Mary, I don't know that she
won't be better employed in seeing the poor chap decently and
comfortably into his coffin, than in grafting her insincerities and
affectations on the young. A more lukewarm bridegroom, though, it
has seldom been my lot to meet."</p>

<p>"How hard on her you are! Yes, both you and John. Every woman
<i>naturally</i> wants a husband...and a good thing, too, or where
would the world be? Besides if she doesn't marry, you men are the
first to twit her with being an old maid. But if she shows any
inclination for it, it's considered matter for a joke...or not
quite nice."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear! Why, love, at this rate we shall soon have you clad
in bloomers and spouting on a platform for women's rights."</p>

<p>"Richard! Don't speak to me of such horrors. But we're talking
about Zara. I must say, after seeing Hempel I agree with John, it's
a ridiculous match. He really doesn't seem to care <i>that</i> much
for her..."</p>

<p>"Which is but natural. At his stage of the disease a man is
entirely occupied with his own health...and his God."</p>

<p>"And I thought Zara most cutting with him. No, I'm afraid she's
taking him just to be married."</p>

<p>But, even as she said it, Mary had a glimpse into depths that
were closed to her menkind. Just to be married! It meant that
solace of the woman who was getting on in years&mdash;the plain
gold band on the ring finger. It meant no longer being shut out
from the great Society of Matrons; no longer needing to look the
other way were certain subjects alluded to; or pretending not to
notice the nods and winks, the silently mouthed words that went on
behind your back. It was all very well when you were young; when
your very youth and innocence made up for it: as you grew older, it
turned to a downright mortification&mdash;like that of going in to
dinner after the bride of eighteen.</p>

<p>"Besides we <i>can't</i> dictate to Zara as if she were still a
child. She has a right to buy her own experience...even if it's
only with a poor creature like Hempel."</p>

<p>Another unspoken thought that lurked comfortably at the back of
Mary's mind was of the more than liberal pin-money Richard was now
giving her. He had said expressly, too, she need render no account
of how she spent it. Thus, should the worst happen, she would be
able to see to it that neither he nor John had to put hand to
pocket.</p>

<p>A last attempt to bring Zara to reason, however, she made. And
having only succeeded in fanning the flames&mdash;sister-wise, Zara
took interference less well from her than from any one&mdash;Mary
tilted her chin, and sighing: "Well, we must just make the best of
it!" forthwith requested John to do his share.</p>

<p>One thing, though, she did not yield in: she went off by herself
to town and bought the stuff for Zara's wedding-dress. For Zara,
she could see, was meditating satin and orange-blossoms; and
against this all Mary's common sense rose in arms. "For a place
like Wangawatha! And with not even a Bishop to entertain...I mean,
Hempel being a Baptist." So she chose Madras muslin&mdash;finest
Madras, which cost a good deal more than satin&mdash;and a neat
bonnet trimmed with lilac.</p>

<p>"For these you can wear to chur&mdash;to chapel, Zara, you know,
when the hot weather comes." But Zara was so angry that she forgot
to thank Mary for the gift, and tried the texture of the muslin
between thumb and finger as if it were a bit of print.</p>

<p>And so a quiet wedding was celebrated at the Carlton house, a
ceremony in which the only hitch was a somewhat lengthy pause for
the bridegroom to recover his breath after a fit of coughing; a
glass of champagne was drunk to the health of the newly wedded; and
off they went in a shower of rice which Mary took care was thick
enough to satisfy even Zara. Nor was a satin slipper forgotten for
the back of the carriage-and-pair, all flowers and favours, which
Mahony had provided to drive the happy couple to the steamboat on
which they would sail to Sorrento.</p>

<p>The very last thing, upstairs in the bedroom, Mary pressed a
small wad of notes into Zara's hand. "A bit of my wedding present
to you, dear Zara. Now don't stint on your honeymoon. Put up at the
best hotel and enjoy yourselves. Remember, one is only married
once."</p>

<p>"<i>Merci, ma bonne Marie, merci!</i>" said Zara: in the course
of the past hour she had gradually taken on the allures of an elder
married woman towards her junior. "But I should have done so in any
case."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The rice swept up, the hundred and one boxes of wedding cake
dispatched which should intimate to even the least of Zara's
acquaintances that she had quitted the single state, Mary turned to
her next job, and drove one morning to St. Kilda to inspect John's
house. She went by herself, for she thought John would thank you to
have other eyes than hers quizzing his neglected home. And she was
glad indeed no one else was present when, the coachman having
unlocked the front door and drawn up the blinds for her, she was
free to wander through the deserted rooms. The house had stood
empty almost as long as she had been absent from the colony; and,
in such a climate as this, two years spelt ruin. No window or door
had fitted tightly enough, when hot winds and their accompanying
dust-storms swept the town. The dust crunched gritty underfoot; lay
in a white layer over all tables and polished surfaces; made it
impossible to look out of the windows. The cobwebs that hung from
the corners of the ceilings, and festooned the lustred chandeliers,
were thick as string with it. You could hardly see yourself in the
mirrors for fly-specks, or see the wax flowers under their shades.
Everywhere, in hundreds, flies and blowflies lay dead. Moths had
ravaged each single woollen article she laid hands on. The
beautiful Brussels carpets were eaten into holes, as were also
curtains and bed-hangings, table-covers and the backs of
wool-worked chairs. It was truly a scene of desolation.</p>

<p>In John's bedroom she chanced to open a leaf of the great
triple-fronted mahogany wardrobe, to look if any clothes had been
left hanging to share in the general dilapidation; and there, the
first thing she lighted on was a shawl of "poor Jinny's"&mdash;or
what had once been a shawl, for it was now riddled like a colander,
and all but fell to pieces as she touched it. For a moment Mary
stood lost to her surroundings. What memories that shawl called up!
Of softest white cashmere, with a handsome floral border, it had
been John's present to Jinny on the birth of their first child:
"And if the next's a boy, Jane, I promise you one of richest India
silk, my love!" But, even so, this gift had filled Jinny's cup to
the brim. Mary could only remember it tied up with ribbons in
tissue paper, and smelling of camphor to knock you down&mdash;Jinny
had hardly dared to wear it for fear the dust should discolour it,
or the sun fade the bordering. There had been quite a quarrel one
day, when John and she were staying with them in Ballarat, because
Jinny had visited the Ococks in her second-best. "Far from me be
it, Mary, to inculcate an extravagant spirit in Jane, or encourage
her to run up bills at the milliner's. But she is now my wife, and
it is her duty to dress accordingly," had been John's way of
putting it. Well, poor Jinny, she might just as well have worn her
finery and worn it out...as only have had it on her back some dozen
times in all. She was gone where no shawls were needed.</p>

<p>"It's really a lesson not to hoard one's clothes, but to use and
enjoy them while you can. Not to get anything too grand, either,
which makes it seem a pity to wear."</p>

<p>"John ought to have given all such things away," she aid to
herself a few minutes later. For a nudge of memory had drawn her to
a lumber-room, where four zinc-and-wood saratogas were lined up in
a row. These held all that remained to mortal eyes of "poor Emma."
For Jinny had once soon after marriage confessed to a wild fit of
jealousy, in which she had packed away every scrap of her
predecessor's belongings.&mdash;Fifteen years dead! The things were
now, no doubt, mere rags and tatters, for the box-lid was not made
that could keep out the moth. Some day she, Mary, must make it her
business to run through them, to see if no little enduring thing
was left that could be handed on to Trotty, as a memento of her
long-dead mother.</p>

<p>"Regular Bluebeard's chambers," was Richard's comment, when she
told him of her discoveries.</p>

<p>But Mary had on her thinking-cap, and sat wondering how she
could best reduce John's affairs to order. The house must be opened
up without loss of time, scrubbers and cleaners turned in, painters
and paperhangers and then...A few days later she came home
radiant.</p>

<p>"I've got the very <i>person</i> for John!" and undoing her
bonnet-strings, she threw them back with an air of triumph. It was
a hot November afternoon.</p>

<p>"What!...yet again?" and having kissed her, Mahony laid his book
face downwards and prepared to listen. "Tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"Quite one of the most sensible women I've ever met."</p>

<p>"Then, my dear, you do <i>not</i> mean pretty Fanny!"</p>

<p>For Mary had been out spending a couple of days with the young
pair at Heidelberg, to pay her overdue respects to the cottage of
which she had heard so much.</p>

<p>"It really is a dear little place. And kept in apple-pie
order."</p>

<p>She had soon discovered, though, that the prevailing neatness
and nicety were not the result of any brilliant housewifely
qualities in the little bride. The good genius proved to be an
aunt&mdash;"Auntie Julia"&mdash;who had had charge of the
motherless girl since birth.</p>

<p>"One of those neat, brisk little women, Richard, who do
everything well they put their hands to. Her hair's grey, but she
is not really old. What struck me first was when she said: 'Now
please don't imagine I'm a fixture here, Mrs. Mahony. I just came
to help my little Fan over her first troubles in setting up house.
I don't hold with old aunts&mdash;or mothers
either&mdash;quartering themselves upon the newly wed. Young people
should be left to their own devices. No, poor old Auntie Julia's
job is done; she's permanently out of work.'"</p>

<p>It was here Mary thought she saw a light in John's darkness.
Taking the bull by the horns, she there and then told Miss Julia
the story of her brother's two marriages, and of his vain attempts
to live in peace and harmony with Zara.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow, poor fellow! Dear Mrs. Mahony, I agree with you:
relatives are not the easiest people in the world to get on with.
They are either so much alike that each knows all the time just
what the other is thinking&mdash;and that is fatal; for, if you
won't mind my saying so, the private thoughts we indulge in, even
of our nearest, are not of a fit kind to be made public." ("But
with such a merry twinkle in her eye, Richard, that it took away
anything that might have sounded sharp or biting.") "Or else
brothers and sisters are so different that they might have been
born on different planets."</p>

<p>Mary next enumerated the long line of housekeepers who had
wandered in their day through John's establishment. "In at one
door, and out at the next!"</p>

<p>"Aha! You needn't tell me where the shoe pinched there. I see, I
see. Each of 'em in turn thought she was <i>the</i> one chosen by
fate to fill your poor sister-in-law's place. May I speak frankly?
If I take the post, you may make your mind perfectly easy on that
score. I'm not of the marrying sort. Some men are born to be
bachelors; some women, bless 'em, what's known as old maids. I can
assure you, my dear Mrs. Mahony, I am happiest in the single life.
Nor have I missed a family of my own, for my little Fan here has
been as much mine as though I had borne her." Here, however, seeing
Mary's rather dubious air, she laid a hand on her arm and added
reassuringly: "But don't be afraid, my dear. I do not noise these
views abroad. They're just between you, me and the tea-caddy."</p>

<p>"It was really said very nicely, Richard&mdash;not at all
indelicately."</p>

<p>"All the same, I should give her a hint that such radical ideas
would be fatal to her prospects with his lordship," said Mahony,
who had recently smarted anew under his brother-in-law's
heavy-handed patronage.</p>

<p>"She won't talk like that to a <i>man</i>. And I feel sure I'm
right; she's the very person."</p>

<p>And so she was. No sooner had John, on Mary's recommendation,
made definite arrangements with Miss Julia than tangles seemed to
straighten of themselves. Hers was a master mind. In less than no
time the house was cleaned, renovated, repaired; efficient servants
were engaged; John was transferred from his uncomfortable Club
quarters to a comfortable domesticity. And Miss Julia proved
herself of an exquisite tact in running the establishment, in
meeting John's wishes, in agreeing with him without yielding a jot
of her own convictions. And thereafter John &mdash;"He couldn't, of
course, let the credit for the changed state of affairs go out of
the family!"&mdash;John went about singing Mary's praises, and
congratulating himself on being the possessor of so capable a
sister.</p>

<p>Next, Jinny's three mites were brought home from boarding
school; and together Mary and Miss Julia stripped them of their
"uniforms," undid their meagre little rats'-tails, and freed their
little bodies from the stiff corsets in which even the infant
Josephine was encased. Three pleasant-faced, merry-eyed little
girls emerged, who soon learned to laugh and play again, and filled
the dead house with the life it needed. They adored Auntie Julia:
and were adored by their father as of old.</p>

<p>There remained only Trotty&mdash;or Emmy, as she was now called.
Mary had confabbed with Miss Julia, and they had shaken their heads
in unison over John's extraordinary attitude towards his first
family. But, on meeting the girl, Miss Julia struck her palms
together and cried: "What! stand out against <i>that?</i>...my
dear, have <i>no</i> fear! Just let your brother grow used to
seeing such a daughter opposite him at breakfast, and he'll soon
miss her if she chances to be absent. <i>Exactly</i> what he needs
to preside over his dinner-table. It shall be my task to train her
for the post."</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, Mary kept Emmy at her own side, in
order to renew acquaintance with one she had known so well as a
child.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-4" id="ch-2-2-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>Emmy also served to fill a gap.</p>

<p>As always when forced to live at haphazard, without a fixed
routine, Mahony was restless and ill at ease. He had not even a
comfortable room to retire to: his present den was the dull little
back parlour of a town house. Books, too, he came very short in; it
did not seem worth while unpacking those he had brought out with
him; and the newly ordered volumes could not be expected to arrive
for months to come. Nor did he see much of Mary: what time she had
to spare from her relatives was spent in endless discussions with
decorators and upholsterers.</p>

<p>The company of his young niece was thus a real boon to him. Emmy
had no obligations, was free to go with him when and where he
chose. What was more, with neither the cares of a family nor of
house-furnishing on her mind, her thoughts never strayed. And a
sound friendship sprang up between the oddly matched pair. No
longer afraid of her uncle, Emmy displayed a gentle, saucy,
laughing humour. Mahony hired a little horse for her and they rode
out together, she pinned up in Mary's old habit; rode out early of
a morning while other people were still fast asleep. Their
destination was invariably the new house, to see what progress had
been made since the day before: holding her habit high, Emmy would
run from room to room, exclaiming. Thence they followed quiet,
sandy tracks that led through stretches of heath and gorse to the
sea. Or they strolled on foot, Emmy hanging on her uncle's arm and
chattering merrily: a simple-hearted, unaffected girl, as natural
as she was pretty, which was saying a good deal, for she promised
to be a regular beauty. "Strawberries and cream" was Mahony's name
for her. She had inherited her mother's ripe-corn fairness and
limpid, lash-swept eyes; but the wildrose complexion of the
English-born woman had here been damped to palest cream, in which,
as a striking contrast, stood out two lovely lips of a vivid
carnation-red&mdash;a daring touch on the part of nature that
already drew men's eyes as she passed. In person, she was soft and
round and womanly. But the broad little hands with their slyly
bitten nails were still half a child's. She was childishly
unconscious too, of her attractions, innocent in the use to which
she put them; and blushed helplessly did any one remark on her
appearance&mdash;as the outspoken people who surrounded her were
only too apt to do. Without being in the least clever, she had a
bright open mind, and drank in with interest all Mahony could give
her: tales of his travels or of the early days; descriptions of
books and plays; little homilies on the wonders of nature. If he
had a fault to find with her, it was that she seemed just as
sweetly grateful for, say, "Auntie Julia's" enjoinders how to hold
her crotchet-needle, or hints on dress and deportment, as to him
for his deeper lore. Yes, the child had an artless and inborn
desire to please, and dissipated her favours in a manner that
belonged very surely to her age...and her sex. For he might say
"child," but let him remember that his own little Polly-Mary had
been but a couple of months older, when he ran her off from among
her playmates and friends.</p>

<p>Altogether there was much about John's daughter&mdash;no! not
thus would he put it&mdash;about Mary's niece, that reminded him of
Mary herself, as a little mouse of a bride long years ago. And not
the least striking point of resemblance was this whole-hearted
surrender of attention. It would, of course, be unreasonable to
expect the faculty to persist: life in its course brought, to even
the fondest of wives, distractions, cares and interests of her own.
But there was no denying it, this lack of preoccupation it was,
this freedom&mdash;even emptiness if you would&mdash;of mind, into
which oneself poured the contents, that rendered a very young woman
so delightful a companion.</p>

<p>And when, at length, the move to the new house was made, and
Mahony set about unpacking, arranging and cataloguing the books he
had, and planning where those to come should be shelved, Emmy was
still his right hand. Mary, busy with strange servants, with the
stocking of kitchen and larder, could do no more than occasionally
look in to see how the two of them were getting on, and keep them
supplied with refreshment. Good-naturedly she yielded Emmy entirely
to Richard, who now passed to overhauling his minerals, plants and
butterflies, all of which had made the journey to England with him
and back. And glass cases, stacks of blotting-paper and sheets of
cork were set up afresh in this big, pleasant room, the windows of
which looked down a vista cut through spreading oleanders to where,
in the orchard, peach and almond-blossom vied in pinkness against a
pale blue sky.</p>

<p>But it was not very long before Emmy was spirited away to grace
her father's table. Then, his own affairs in order, domestic
appointments running smoothly, Mahony drove out with Mary in the
neat brougham he had given her, to return some of the visits that
had been paid them. Later on, too, he accompanied her to dinners,
balls and soirees; or played the host at his own table, which Mary
soon filled with guests.</p>

<p>The society in which they here found themselves had a variety
and a breadth about it that put it on a very different footing from
either the narrow Ballarat circle of earlier years, or the medieval
provincialism into which they had stumbled overseas. And moments
came when, squarely facing the facts, Mahony admitted to himself he
might go farther and fare worse: in other words, that he could now
never hope to know anything better. The most diverse tastes were
catered for. There was the ultra-fashionable set that revolved
round Government House and the vice-regal entertainments; that
covered the lawns at Flemington and Caulfield; drove out in
splendid four and six-in-hands to champagne picnics at Yan Yean;
overflowed the dress circle at the Theatre Royal, where Bandmann
was appearing in his famous roles; the ladies decked for all
occasions&mdash;lawn, theatre, picnics, dusty streets
alike&mdash;in the flimsiest and costliest of robes. At the head of
this aristocracy of wealth stood those primitive settlers the great
squatter-kings, owners of sheep-runs that counted up to a hundred
thousand acres: men whose incomes were so vast that they hardly
knew how to dispense them, there existing here no art treasures to
empty the purse, nor any taste to buy them had they existed.
Neither did travel tempt these old colonists, often of humble
origin, whose prime had been spent buried in the bush; while it had
not yet become the fashion to educate sons and daughters "at
home."</p>

<p>Since, however, fortunes were still notoriously
precarious&mdash;flood or fire could ruin a man overnight&mdash;and
since, too, the sense of uncertainty that characterised the early
days had bitten too deep ever to be got out of the blood, "spend
while you may" remained the motto men lived by. And this led to a
reckless extravagance that had not its equal. Women lavished money
on dress, which grew to be a passion in this fair climate; on
jewellery with which to behang their persons; on fantastic
entertainments; men drank, betted, gambled; while horse-racing had
already become, with both sexes, the obsession it was to remain.
This stylish set&mdash;it also included fabulously lucky
speculators, as well as the great wool-buyers&mdash;Mahony did not
do much more than brush in passing. His sympathies inclined rather
to that which revolved round the trusty prelate who, having guided
the destinies of the Church through the ups and downs of its
infancy, now formed a pivot for the intellectual interests of the
day&mdash;albeit of a somewhat non-progressive, anti-modern kind.
Still, the atmosphere that prevailed in the pleasant rooms at
Bishopscourt was the nearest thing to be found to the urbane,
unworldly air of English university or cathedral life. Next in
order came the legal luminaries, Irishmen for the most part, with
keen, ugly faces and scathingly witty tongues; men whose enormous
experience made them the best of good company. And to this clique
belonged also the distinguished surgeons and physicians of the
eastern hill; the bankers, astutest of financiers; with, for spice,
the swiftly changing politicians of the moment, here one day, gone
the next, with nothing but their ideas or their energy to recommend
them, and dragging with them wives married in their working
days...well, the less said of the wives the better.</p>

<p>Such was the society in which Mahony was now called on to take
his place. And the result was by so much the most vivid expression
of his personality he had yet succeeded in giving, that it became
<i>the</i> one that imprinted itself on men's minds, to the
confusion of what had gone before and was to come after: became the
reality from which his mortal shadow was thrown.&mdash;"Mahony?"
would be the query in later years. "Mahony? Ah yes, of course, you
mean Townshend-Mahony of 'Ultima Thule,'" this being the name he
had bestowed on his new house.&mdash;Mary regarded him fondly and
with pride. Certain it was, no matter in what circle she moved,
whose dinner-table he sat at, whose hearthrug he stood on, he was
by far the most distinguished-looking man in the room. And not only
this: a kind of mellowness now descended on him, a new tolerance
with his fellowmen. The lines of work and worry disappeared; he
filled out both in face and figure, and loved to tease Mary by
declaring he was on the high road to growing fat. He brushed up his
musical accomplishments, too; and his pleasant tenor, his skill as
a flute-player, brought him into fresh demand. Miss Timms-Kelly,
Judge Kelly's daughter, who had quite the finest amateur voice in
Melbourne, was heard to say she preferred Richard's second in a
duet to any other; and many an elaborate aria, full of shakes and
trills, did she warble to his <i>obbligato</i> on the flute.</p>

<p>How happy all this made Mary, she could not have told. To know
Richard even moderately contented would have satisfied her; to see
him actually taking pleasure in life caused her Cup to run over.
She had now not a care left, hardly a wish unfulfilled. And she
showed it. The eclipse in health and good looks she had suffered by
reason of her transplantation was past: never had she felt better
than at present; while in appearance she bloomed anew&mdash;enjoyed
a kind of Indian summer. At thirty-two, an age when, in the trying
climate of the colony, a woman was, as often as not, hopelessly
faded, Mary did not need to fear comparison with ladies ten years
her junior. Her skin was still flawless, eye as brilliant, her hair
as glossy as of old. In figure she inclined to the statuesque,
without being either too tall or too full: arms and shoulders were
unsurpassed in their rounded whiteness. A certain breadth of brow
alone prevented her, at this stage of her life, from being classed
among the acknowledged beauties of her sex: it lent her a
thoughtful air, where she should have been merely
pleasing.&mdash;But, after all, what did this matter? Her real
beauty, as Richard often reflected, consisted in the warmth and
loving-kindness that beamed from her eyes, illuminating a face
which never a malicious thought had twisted or deformed. Her
expression was, of course, no more one of utter
unsuspicion&mdash;experience had seen to that&mdash;just as her
mind was no longer afflicted with the adorable blindness that had
been its leading trait in girlhood. Mary now knew very well that
evil existed, and that mortals were prone to it. But she would not
allow that it could be inborn; held fast to her unconquerable
belief in the innate goodness of every living soul; and was never
at a loss to exonerate the sinner. "No wonder he's what he is,
after the life he has been forced to lead. We mightn't have turned
out any better ourselves, with his temptations." Or: "She has never
had a chance, poor thing! Circumstances have always been against
her."</p>

<p>With her anxieties on Richard's behalf, Mary's ambitions for
him&mdash;that he should climb the tree, make a name&mdash;also
gradually sank to rest. Her mind was thus at liberty to follow its
own bent. Fond though she was of her fellow-creatures, the formal
round of social life had never made a very deep appeal to her: she
liked to see people merry and enjoying themselves, but she herself
needed something more active to engross her. Her house, well
staffed, well run, claimed only a fraction of her attention. Hence
she had plenty of time to devote herself to what Richard called her
true mission in life: the care of others&mdash;especially of the
poor and suffering, the unhappy and unsure. And many a heart was
lightened by having Mary to lean on, her strong common sense for a
guide. Her purse, too, was an unending solace. Even in the latter
years in Ballarat, she had had to dispense her charities carefully,
balancing one against another. Now her income was equal to all the
calls made on it...and more...Richard generously bidding her add to
her own pin-money anything left over from the handsome cheque he
gave her for housekeeping expenses. And since he, mindful of his
promise, never inquired what she did with it, she was at last free
to give as royally as she chose...in any direction. But if he did
not ask to see her pass-book, neither did she see his: he would not
have her troubling her head, he said, about their general
expenditure. At first she rather demurred at this: she would have
liked to know how their outlay per month tallied with the sum at
their disposal; and she missed the talks they had been used to
have, about how best to portion out their income. But Richard said
those days were over and done with: she would lose her way, he
teased her, among sums of four figures&mdash;for, in a twinkling,
his late-found affluence had thrown him back on the traditional
idea that money affairs were the man's province, not the woman's.
For her comfort, he stressed once more the fact that he did not
intend to speculate; also that at long last, he would, despite the
enormous premium, be able to insure his life. In the event of
anything happening to him, she would be well provided for, and thus
might spend what he gave her freely and without scruple. Yielding
to these persuasions, Mary acquiesced in the new arrangement, and
gradually slipped into the delightful habit of taking money for
granted. After all, the confidence was mutual: he trusted her not
to run up bills at milliner's or jeweller's; she, too, had to trust
in her turn. She valued his faith in her, and was careful not to
abuse it. Her own accounts were scrupulously kept: just as in the
old days, she wrote down every shilling she spent, and knitted her
brows over the halfpennies; with the result that she soon began to
accumulate a tidy little nest-egg.</p>

<p>Her charities were her sole extravagance, her personal wants
remaining few and simple. Besides, Richard was for ever making her
presents. It could not be said of him that his tastes did not
expand with his purse. He put his men-servants into livery, stocked
his cellars, bought silver table-appliances and egg-shell china,
had his crest stamped wherever it could find a place. And the
things he bought for her were of the same costly nature. In
addition to the carriage, which she had to admit was both useful
and necessary, his gifts included jewellery (which she wore more to
please him than because she had any real liking for it)&mdash;rings
and chains, brooches and bracelets&mdash;all things <i>his</i> wife
ought to have and never had had: curling ostrich feathers for hat
and fan; gold-mounted mother-of-pearl opera-glasses; hand-painted
fans; carved ivory card-cases; ivory-backed brushes and silver
vinaigrettes: any fal-lal, in short, that struck his eye or caught
his fancy.</p>

<p>There came a day on which he fairly outdid himself. Soon after
inscribing their names in the visiting-book at Government House,
they received invitations to a ball there, in honour of two
men-of-war that were anchored in the Bay&mdash;a very select affair
indeed: none of your promiscuous May Day crushes! As it would be
their first appearance in style, Mahony&mdash;a trifle uncertain
whether Mary would do the thing handsomely enough&mdash;insisted on
fitting her out. The pale blue silk he chose for her gown was
finest Lyons, the cost of which, without making, ran to thirty
pounds: Mary had never seen a silk like it. It was got privatim
through John, who had it direct from the French factory. John, too,
was responsible for the crowning glory of Mary's attire. For after
Richard had added a high, pearl-studded Spanish comb for her hair,
John one day showed him a wonderful shawl that had just come into
the warehouse, suggesting it would look well on Mary. And for once
Mahony found himself in agreement with his brother-in-law. Of
softest cashmere, supple as silk&mdash;and even softer to the
touch&mdash;the scarlet ground of the shawl was well-nigh hidden by
a massive white Indian embroidery; so that the impression gained
was one of sumptuous white silk, broken by flecks of red. It was
peaked, burnous-like, to form a hood, and this and the corners were
hung with heavy white silk tassels. So magnificent an affair was it
that Mary had severe qualms about wearing it: in her heart she
considered it far too showy and elaborate. But Richard had no doubt
paid an enormous price for it, and would be hurt into the bargain
if she said what she thought.</p>

<p>He himself was charmed with the effect, when she draped it over
the sky-blue of the gown. "Upon my word, my dear, you'll put every
other woman in the shade!"</p>

<p>But even he was not prepared for the stir that ran through the
ballroom on their arrival. In among the puces and magentas, the
rose-budded pinks and forget-me-notted blues came Mary, trailing a
bit of oriental splendour, and wearing it, as only she could, with
a queenly yet unconscious air. Seated on a dais among the
matrons&mdash;for nowadays she danced only an occasional "square,"
leaving round dances to the young&mdash;Mary drew the fire of all
eyes.</p>

<p>And it was not the opera-cloak alone.</p>

<p>"A skin like old Florentine ivory!" declared an Englishman fresh
from "home." The guest of the Governor, he was wandering through
this colonial assembly much as a musical connoisseur might wander
through a cattle-yard. Till Mary caught his eye...And when she
dropped the cloak, for the honour of a quadrille with his
Excellency, this same visitor was heard to dilate on the tints cast
by the blue on the ivory...to murmur of Goya...Velasquez.</p>

<p>Subsequently he was introduced, and sat by her side for the
better part of an hour.</p>

<p>At two o'clock, when Mahony handed her to the carriage, it was
with something of the lover-like elan that even the least fond
husband feels on seeing his wife the centre of attraction.</p>

<p>"Now, madam!...wasn't I right? Who was the success of the
evening I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard...Put up the window, dear, it's cold. If there can
be any talk of a success...then it's the cloak you mean, not
me."</p>

<p>"It took you to carry it off, love. Not another woman in the
room could have done it. Made it seem very well worth the price I
had to pay for it."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me, you haven't yet told me what that was."</p>

<p>"My business, sweetheart! Yours to play the belle and get
compared to the old masters by admiring strangers."</p>

<p>"<i>Really</i>, Richard!" Mary made the deprecating movement of
the chin with which she was wont to rebuke extravagances. "Why,
dear, he was so high-falutin I didn't know half the time what he
was talking about." Then fearing she had been too severe, she
added: "Of course I'm very glad you were pleased,"&mdash;and hoped
that was the end of it. Compliments, even from one's husband, were
things to be evaded if possible. "Well, I must remember poor Jinny
and not hoard it up for the moths to get at." But there was more
than a dash of doubt in Mary's tone, and she sighed. Not merely for
Jinny. She did not know when another opportunity so splendid as
this evening's would arise. For an ordinary one, such finery would
certainly be out of place.</p>

<p>"Wear it or not as you please, love. It has served its
end...stamped itself on a moment of time," said Mahony; and fell
therewith into a brown study.</p>

<p>But as he helped her from the carriage he stooped and kissed
her...which Mary was very much afraid the coachman saw.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-5" id="ch-2-2-5"></a>Chapter V</h3>

<p>Than queening it at balls, she felt more in her element seated
in a rather dingily furnished drawing-room, holding poor Agnes
Ocock's hand. Although it had struck five and the worst heat of the
day was over, Agnes was still in her bedgown&mdash;she had been
lying down with the headache, she said&mdash;nor could Mary
persuade her to exchange this for bonnet and shawl, and drive out
with her in the brougham that stood at the door.</p>

<p>"Another time, dearest, if you do not mind. To-day I have no
fancy for it."</p>

<p>Mary was shocked by the change the past six months had worked in
her friend; and disagreeably impressed by the common-featured house
in which she found her: it had no garden, but stood right on the
dusty St. Kilda Parade. Agnes was growing very stout; her fine skin
looked as creased as her robe, her cheek was netted with veins, her
hair thin, under a cap set awry. Mary knew the rumours that were
current; and her heart swelled with pity.</p>

<p>"Just as you like, dear. And how are the children? Are they in?
May I see them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, the children. Why...the truth is, dearest Mary, I
haven't...they are not with me. Henry thought...he thought..."</p>

<p>Agnes's voice broke, and after a painful struggle to compose
herself she hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Leaning forward Mary laid an arm round her shoulders. "Dearest
Agnes, won't you tell me your trouble? Is it the little one
you...you lost, you are fretting over?"</p>

<p>And now there was no sound in the room but that of
crying&mdash;and such crying! It seemed difficult to connect these
heavy nerve-racking sobs with the lovely, happy little Agnes of
former days. Holding her close, Mary let her weep unstintedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, Mary! I am the most miserable creature alive."</p>

<p>Yes, it was the loss of the child that was breaking her
heart...or rather the way in which she had lost it.</p>

<p>"It was the finest baby you ever saw, Mary&mdash;neither of the
others could compare with it. They were all very well; but this
one...His tiny limbs were so round and smooth&mdash;it was like
kissing velvet. And dimples everywhere. And he was born with a head
of golden hair. I never knew Henry so pleased. He said such a child
did me credit...and this used rather to make me wonder, Mary; for
Baby wasn't a bit like Henry...or like the other two. He took after
my family and had blue eyes. But do you know who he reminded me of
most of all? It was of Eddie, Mary...and through Eddie of Mr.
Glendinning. When Eddie was born he used to lie in my lap, just as
soft and fair...and sometimes I think I forgot, and imagined this
baby <i>was</i> Eddie over again...and that made me still fonder of
him; for one's first is one's first, love, no matter how many come
after. And then...then...He was five months old, and beginning to
try to grasp things and take notice&mdash;oh, such a happy babe!
And then one morning, I wasn't feeling well, Mary&mdash;the doctor
said the nursing of such a hearty child was a great strain on me;
then a giddy fit took me&mdash;I had been giving him the breast and
got up to lay him down&mdash;nurse wasn't there. I must have been
dizzy with sitting so long stooped over him&mdash;and he was heavy
for his age. I got up and came over faint all of a sudden&mdash;the
doctor says so...and I tottered, Mary, and Baby fell&mdash;fell out
of my arms...on his little head&mdash;I heard the thud&mdash;yes,
the thud...but not a cry or a sound...nothing...nothing...he never
cried again."</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor Agnes! Oh, you poor, poor thing!"</p>

<p>Mary was weeping, too; the tears ran down her cheeks. But she
made no attempt to palliate or console; did not speak of an
accident for which it was impossible to blame yourself; or of God's
will, mysterious, inscrutable: she just grieved, with an intensity
of feeling that made her one with the bereft. Things of this kind
went too deep for words; were hurts from which there could be no
recovery. Time might grow its moss over them...hide them from
mortal sight...that was all.</p>

<p>As she drove home she reflected, pitifully, how strange it was
that so soft and harmless a creature as Agnes should thus be
singled out for some of life's hardest blows. Agnes had so surely
been born for happiness&mdash;and to make others happy. Misfortunes
such as these ought to be kept for people of stronger, harder
natures and with broader backs; who could suffer and still carry
their heads high. Agnes was merely crushed to earth by them...like
a poor little trampled flower.</p>

<p>But before she reached the house, a fearful suspicion crossed
her mind.</p>

<p>Tilly nodded confirmingly.</p>

<p>"The plain English of it is, she was squiffy."</p>

<p>And went on: "It was hushed up, my dear, you bet!&mdash;kept
dark as the grave...doctor changed, etc. etc. They actually 'ad the
face to put it down to the nurse's carelessness: said nurse being
packed off at once, <i>handsomely remunerated</i>, mind you, to
hold 'er tongue. An' a mercy the child died; the doctor seemed to
think it might 'ave been soft, 'ad it lived&mdash;after such a
knock on the pate&mdash;and can you see Henry dragging the village
idiot at 'is heels? <i>never</i> was a man in such a fury, Mary.
Ugh! that white face with those little pitch-black eyes rolling
round in it&mdash;it gave me the fair shakes to look at 'im. 'Pon
my word I believe, if 'e'd dared, 'e'd 'ave slaughtered Agnes there
and then. His child, <i>his</i> son!&mdash;you know the tune of it.
'E'll never forgive 'er, mark my words he won't!...the disgrace and
all that&mdash;for of course everybody knew all about it and a good
deal more. She was odd enough beforehand, never going anywhere. Now
she's taking the sea-air at St. Kilda, and, if you ask me, she'll
go on taking it...till Doomsday."</p>

<p>"The very way to drive her to despair!" cried Mary; and
burned.</p>

<p>Tilly shrugged. "It's six of one and 'alf a dozen of the other
to my mind. I'd almost rather be put away to rot like a poisoned
rat in a hole, than live under the whip of Mossieu Henry's
tongue&mdash;not to mention 'is eye!"</p>

<p>"Agnes shall not die like a rat in a hole if I can help it."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you can't, my dear!...don't make any mistake about
that. You might as well try to bend a bar of iron as
'Enry.&mdash;And I must say, Mary, it does sometimes seem a good
deal of fuss to make over one small kid. She can 'ave more for the
asking."</p>

<p>"<i>Tilly!</i>" Mary looked up from her sewing&mdash;the two
women sat on the verandah of Tilly's house in Ballarat, where Mary
was visiting&mdash;in reproof and surprise at a speech so unlike
her friend. It was not the first either; Tilly often wore a mopy,
world-weary air nowadays, which did not sit naturally on her. "Each
child that lives is just itself," added Mary. "That's why one loves
it so."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I s'pose so. And as you know, love, I'd 'ave 'ad a
dozen if I could. It wouldn't 'ave been one too many to fill this
'ouse."</p>

<p>Mary believed she read the answer to the riddle. "Look here,
Tilly, you're lonely...that's what's the matter with you."</p>

<p>And Tilly nodded, dumpily&mdash;again unlike herself.</p>

<p>"Fact is, Mary, I want something to <i>do</i>. As long as dear
old Pa lived, and I 'ad the boys to look after, it was all
right&mdash;I never knew what it was to be dull. But now...P'r'aps
if they'd let me keep Tom and Johnny...or if I could groom my own
'orses or ride 'em at the stakes...No, no, of course, I know it
wouldn't do&mdash;or be <i>commy faut</i>. It's only my gab."</p>

<p>"I wonder, Tilly," said Mary, "I wonder if...have you never
thought, dear, at times like these that...that perhaps you might
some day marry again?" She put the question very tentatively,
knowing Tilly's robust contempt for the other sex.</p>

<p>But Tilly answered pat: "Why, that's just what I 'ave,
Mary."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mary. And to cover up her amazement, added: "I think
it would be the very best thing that could happen."</p>

<p>There followed a pause of some length. Mary did not know what to
make of it. Tilly was humming and hawing: she fidgeted, coloured,
shifted her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," she said at length, in answer to Mary's
invitation to speak out: "I <i>Have</i> something on my
chest...something I want to say to you, Mary, and yet don't quite
know, 'ow. Fact is, I want you to do me a good turn, my dear. No,
now just you wait a jiff, till you 'ear what it is. Tell you what,
Mary, I've found meself regularly down in the mouth of
late&mdash;off me grub&mdash;and that sort of thing. No, Pa's death
has nothing whatever to do with it. I was getting on
famously&mdash;right as a trivet&mdash;till...well, till I went to
town&mdash;yes, that time, you know, to meet you and the doctor."
And as Mary still sat blank and uncomprehending, she blurted out:
"Oh, well...till I saw...oh, <i>you</i> know!&mdash;till I met a
<i>Certain Person</i> again."</p>

<p>"A certain person? Do you...Tilly! Oh, Tilly, do you
<i>really?</i> Purdy?"</p>

<p>Tilly nodded, heavily, gloomily, without the ghost of a smile.
"Yes, it's a fact&mdash;and not one I'm proud of either, as you can
guess. And yet again I ask meself why not? I need some one to look
after, Mary...and that's the truth. 'E'S down on <i>his</i> luck,
as always; can't get the money to stick; and I've more than I know
what to do with. And to see 'im there, lookin' so poor and shabby,
and yet keeping 'is pecker up as 'e did&mdash;why, I dunno, but it
seemed some'ow to 'urt me <i>'ere!</i>"&mdash;and Tilly, her
aitches scattering more wildly than usual under the stress of her
emotion, laid her hands, one over the other, on her left
breast.</p>

<p>"But Tilly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! now don't go and but me, Polly, like the dear good soul you
are and always 'ave been. If you mean, am I going to let 'im make
ducks and drakes of poor old Pa's money, I can truly say
no&mdash;no fear! Not this child. But...well...look 'ere, Mary, I
'aven't spit out the whole truth yet. You'll laugh at what I'm
going to tell you, and well you may do; it sounds rum enough. But
you know they do say old folks fall to playing again with toys,
cuddling dolls and whittling chips. Well, a <i>Certain Person</i>
'ad a bit of hair, Poll, that used to curl behind 'is
ear&mdash;many and many's the time in the old spoony days I've sat
and twiddled it round me finger. Now, 'is hair's wearing thin on
top, but the curl's still there&mdash;and I...would you believe
it?...yes, I'm blessed if my finger didn't itch to be at it again.
And what's worse, <i>has</i> itched ever since. 'Ere I go, properly
in the dumps and the doldrums, and feeling as if nothing 'ull ever
matter much any more if I can't. Oh, there's no fool like an old
fool, Mary love!...and nobody knows that better than the old fool
'im&mdash;herself."</p>

<p>"Oh come, Tilly, you're not quite so ancient as you try to make
out! As to what you say...it's been the living alone and all that,
it's come of."</p>

<p>But though she spoke in a reassuring tone, Mary was none the
less genuinely perturbed: her robust, sensible Tilly reduced to
such a foolish state! Why, it was like seeing one's dearest friend
collapse under a sudden illness.</p>

<p>"P'r'aps. And p'r'aps not. But what I want you to do for me, old
girl, is this. Ask me down to stop for a bit, and ask him to the
house while I'm there. The rest I'll manage for myself. Only you
won't let on to the doctor, will you, love, what I've told you? I
don't want the doctor to know. 'E'd look down 'is nose at me with
that queer look of his&mdash;no, I couldn't stand it, Poll! Henry,
too&mdash;I shall keep 'Enry in the dark till it's too late. 'E'd
raise Cain. For, of course 'e thinks what Pa left's safe to come to
his brats. While, if I fix things up as I want 'em"&mdash;she
lowered her voice&mdash;"I may 'ave kids of my own yet."</p>

<p>"Indeed and I hope so...from the bottom of my heart."</p>

<p>Tell Richard? No, indeed! As that same afternoon Mary drove in
Tilly's double buggy down the dusty slope of Sturt Street, and out
over the Flat, she imagined to herself what Richard would
say&mdash;and think&mdash;did she make him partner in Tilly's
confidences. What?...try to trap a man, and an old friend to boot,
into a loveless marriage, merely because you want to twist a bit of
hair round your finger? He would snort with disgust at such
folly...besides thinking it indelicate into the bargain. As she was
afraid she, Mary, did a little, too. The difference was: she saw,
as he never would, that loneliness was at the bottom of it;
loneliness, and the want of some one to care for, or, as Tilly put
it, of something to do. It might also be that the old girlish
inclination had never quite died out, but only slumbered through
all these years. Not that that would count with Richard; indeed, it
might count in just the opposite way. For he was more than
straitlaced where things of this kind were in question; had a
constitutional horror of them; and he would not consider it at all
nice for the seeds of an old attachment to have stayed alive in
you, while you were happily married to some one else. Another
point: if Purdy yielded to the temptation and took Tilly and her
money, Richard might always think less well of him for doing so;
which would be a thousand pities, now a first move towards a
reconciliation had been made. Whereas if the engagement seemed to
come about of itself...And in this respect there was really
something to be said for it. Purdy once married and settled, the
foolish barrier that had grown up between the two men would fall
away, and they again become the friends they had been of old.</p>

<p>Reasoning thus, Mary arrived at a row of mean little
weatherboard houses, in one of which Ned lived. She did not knock,
but stepped across the verandah, turned the door-knob and went down
the passage. It was a Monday, and washing day. The brick floor of
the kitchen overflowed with water, in which the young fry played.
Polly, turning from the tubs, ran her hands down her arms to sluice
off the lather, before extending them, all moist and crinkled, in
an embrace. By the copper sat Ned&mdash;poor Ned&mdash;convalescent
from the attack of acute bronchitis which had brought Mary in hot
haste to Ballarat a few weeks previously. Ned's chest and shoulders
were wrapped up in an old red flannel petticoat, pinned under the
chin; his feet, well out of the damp's way on an upturned
sugar-box, were clad in down-at-heel felt slippers. His thick
ringletty hair and curly beard hung long and unkempt above the
scarlet drapery, forming a jet-black aureole from which his face,
chastened to a new delicacy, looked out beautiful as a cameo.</p>

<p>Pouncing on Mary he talked volubly, in the hoarse whisper that
was all the voice his illness had left him. It was the same old
Ned, holding forth in the same old way: on the luck that had always
been against him, the fair chance he had never yet had; man and
theme lit up by the same unquenchable optimism. He had to-day a
yarn to tell of the fortune he might have made, not three months
back, had he only at the critical moment been able to lay hands on
the needful: men had gone in and won who had not a quarter of his
flair. How much of this was truth and how much imagination, Mary
did not know or greatly care&mdash;unlike Polly who, rasped beyond
measure, clicked an angry tongue and lashed out at Ned's "atrocious
lies."</p>

<p>Striving to keep the peace by dropping in soothing words, Mary
sat and pondered how best these poor souls could be helped. On the
voyage out, she had seriously considered adopting one&mdash;perhaps
even two&mdash;of the black-haired brood. But again Polly made
short work of the suggestion. Not even to Mary whom she dearly
loved, would she give up her children.</p>

<p>"They're me own and I'll stick to 'em, come what may! For
they're all I've got, dearie...all I'll ever get from the whole
galumphing galoot." With which Mary was forced to agree; and though
seven lived and a ninth was on the way.</p>

<p>Nor could Polly be induced to part from them even for the
benefit of their education.</p>

<p>"Ta, love, you mean it kindly, but I'll not have 'em brought up
above their station. They're a working-man's kids, and such they'll
remain. Besides, you may be sure there'll be <i>some</i> of Ned's
blowfly notions in some of their heads. And the State School's the
best place to knock such nonsense out of 'em." Which, duly reported
by Mary, Richard said was a gross example of parental selfishness.
What right had a mother to stand in the way of her offspring? No
child with any true affection would grow up to despise his parents.
On the contrary, as he understood the sacrifice they had made for
him, his love for them would deepen and increase. But this was just
Richard's high-flown way of looking at things.</p>

<p>No, what Ned and Polly wanted was money, and money alone. This
piece of knowledge was accompanied, however, by so disagreeable a
sensation that Mary was thankful Richard was not there to share it.
Not only were they ready to take every shilling offered...poor
things, no one could blame them for that, pinched and straitened as
they were...it was their manner of accepting that wounded Mary.
They pocketed what Richard sent them almost as a matter of course,
frankly inspecting the amount, and sometimes even going so far as
to wrinkle their noses over it. Which was really hardly fair; for
Richard was very generous to them; considering they were no blood
relations of his, and he felt they didn't like him. Nor did they:
there was no getting away from that; they showed it even to the
extent of begrudging him his good luck...without which he would
have been unable to do anything for them! Poor Ned's eye was hot
with envy whenever Richard's rise in the world was mentioned. While
Polly alluded to it with an open sneer.</p>

<p>"I say, <i>infra dig.</i> isn't it and no mistake, for a heavy
swell like he is, to have such low-down connections...people who
take in other people's washing!"</p>

<p>Mary could not bring herself to sit in judgment on them: for all
his tall talk, Ned had never harmed a fly; and Polly's was just a
generous nature warped and twisted by poverty and an imprudent
marriage. All the same she took great pains not to let Richard know
how the wind blew. Her letters to him, on Ned and Polly's behalf,
were full of the warm gratitude she herself would have felt had she
stood in their shoes.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-6" id="ch-2-2-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>For the first time in his life Mahony found himself in
possession of all the books he wanted: rare books hard to get;
expensive books he had till now never felt justified in buying. And
Mary, his social conscience, being absent, he fell into depths of
abstraction from which there was nothing to rouse him.</p>

<p>His two old arch-enemies time and money&mdash;or rather the lack
of them&mdash;had definitely ceased to plague him. His leisure was
unbounded, the morrow well provided for, and the material comfort
of his present surroundings such as he had hitherto known only in
dreams. No domestic sounds rasped his ear, scattered his attention;
his spacious study, book-lined from ceiling to floor, stood apart
from the rest of the house, and was solidly built. Was cool and
airy, too; even in the heat of midday he caught a whiff of the sea.
The garden with its shrubberies and lawns of buffalo-grass, its
spreading figtrees and dark firs, rested and refreshed the eye. His
meals appeared on the table as by clockwork, served as he liked
them, cooked to a turn. And so greatly did the hermit's life he now
led jump with his mood, that invitations to social functions grew
fly-spotted on the chimney-shelf, or were swept up by the housemaid
from the floor.</p>

<p>He first undertook to examine the great moderns: those
world-famous scientists and their philosophic spokesmen who
dominated the intellectual life of the day. So far he had read
their works only in snatches, and at random. He now re-read them
systematically; followed step by step the presentment of their
monumental theories&mdash;the idea of evolution, the origin of
species, the antiquity of man&mdash;as well as the constructive or
subversive conclusions deduced therefrom.</p>

<p>Thus weeks passed. At the end of this time&mdash;Mary being
still from home &mdash;he emerged heavy-eyed and a trifle dazed,
from sittings protracted late into the night, and paused to take
his bearings. And it was now, on looking back over what he had
read, that he became aware of a feeling of dissatisfaction. Chiefly
with regard to the mental attitude of the writers themselves. So
sound were their arguments that they might well, he thought, have
refrained from the pontifical airs they saw fit to adopt; having
been a shade less intolerant of views and beliefs that did not
dovetail with their own. Riding on the crest of the highest wave of
materialism that had ever broken over the world, they themselves
were satisfied that life and its properties could be explained, to
the last iota, in terms of matter; and, dogmatically pronouncing
their interpretation of the universe to be the only valid one, they
laid a crushing veto on any suggestion of a possible spiritual
agency. Here it was, he parted company with them. For the same
thing had surely happened before, in the world's history, bodies of
learned men arising at various epochs in divers lands, and claiming
to have solved the great riddle once and for all? Over and above
this, did Huxley's inflamed outbursts against the "cosmogony of the
semi-barbarous Hebrew"; his sighs that the "myths of Paganism, dead
as Osiris or Zeus," had not been followed to their graves by the
"coeval imaginations current among the rude inhabitants of
Palestine"; his bald definition of science as "trained and
organised common sense"&mdash;<i>did</i> Huxley's type of mind, or
yet that of another well-known savant, who declared that one should
decide beforehand what was possible and what not, incline you to
trust these men's verdict on the spiritual issues of human
existence? In his own case, certainly not. He believed and would
continue to believe it impossible wholly to account for life and
its phenomena, in terms of physiology, chemistry and physics.</p>

<p>Another thing that baffled him was: why, having advanced to a
certain point, should they suddenly stop short, with a kingly
gesture of: "Thus far and no farther"? Devoting decades of
laborious research to the <i>origin</i> of life on this globe, its
age, its evolution, why should they leave untouched two questions
of still more vital import: life's ultimate goal, and the moral
mysteries of the soul of man? Yes, the chief bone he had to pick
with them was that they had no will to fathom such deeps; plumed
themselves instead on cold-shouldering them; flaunted as their
device: <i>ignoramus et ignorabimus</i>. Arrogantly sure of
themselves, carried away by a passion for facts, they covered with
ridicule those&mdash;the seers, the poets, the childlike in
heart&mdash;who, over and above the rational and knowable, caught
glimpses of what was assumed to be unknowable; declaring, with a
fierce and intolerant unimaginativeness, that the assertion which
outstripped the evidence was not only a blunder, but a crime.
Strange, indeed, was it to watch these masters toiling to interpret
human life, yet denying it all hope of a further development, any
issue but that of eternal nothingness. For his part, he could not
see why the evolution-formula should be held utterly to rule out
the transcendental-formula. But so it was; every line of their
works confirmed it...confirmed, too, the reader's opinion that, in
their bigoted attitude of mind, they differed not so very markedly
from those hard-and-fast champions of orthodoxy who, in the rising
flood of enlightenment, remained perilously clinging to the
vanishing rock of dogma and tradition. On the one hand, for all
answer to the burning needs and questions of the hour, the tale of
Creation as told in Genesis, the Thirty-nine Articles, the
intolerable Athanasian Creed; on the other, as bitterly stubborn an
agnosticism&mdash;each surely, in the same degree, stones for
bread. One would have liked to call to them: Fear not to turn the
light of research on the conception of that immortality which you
affirm...which you deny.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that, little by little, Mahony found himself
drifting away from the barren conclusions of science: just as in
earlier years he had cast loose from a too rigid orthodoxy. Occult
subjects had always had a strong fascination for him, and he now
turned back to them; read ancient screeds on alchemy and astrology;
the writings of Paracelsus and Apollonius of Tyana. Thence he dived
into mysticism; studied the biographies of Saint Theresa, Joseph
Glanvill, Giordano Bruno; and pondered anew the trance history of
Swedenborg. Men and women like these, living their lives as a kind
of experiment, and an arduous and painful experiment at that, were
yet supported and uplifted by the consciousness of a mighty power
outside, and at the same time within themselves: a bottomless well
of spiritual strength. Out of this inspiration they taught
confidently that all life emanated from God (no matter what form it
assumed in its progress), to God would return, and in Him continue
to exist. Yes, spirituality outstripped intellect; there were
mysteries at once too deep and too simple for learned brains to
fathom. Actually, the unlettered man who said: "God is, and I am of
God!" came nearest to reading the riddle of the universe. How cold
and comfortless, too, the tenet that this one brief span of being
ended all. Without faith in a life to come, how endure, stoically,
the ills that here confronted us?...the injustices of human
existence, the evil men did, the cruelty of man to his brothers, of
God to man? Postulate a Hereafter, and the hope arose that, some
day, the ultimate meaning of all these apparent contradictions
would be made plain: the endless groping, struggling, suffering
prove but rungs in the ladder of humanity's upward climb. Not for
him the Byzantine Heaven of the churches, with its mental
stagnation, its frozen immobility, wherein a jealous God, poorer in
charity than the feeble creatures built in His image, spent
Eternity damning those who had failed to propitiate Him. Nor yet
the doctrine of the Fall of a perfect man from grace. Himself he
held this present life to be but a portal, an antechamber, where
dwelt an imperfect but wholly vital creation, which, growing more
and more passionately aware with the passing of the ages of its
self-contained divinity, would end by achieving, by being
reabsorbed in, the absolute consciousness of the Eternal.</p>

<p>Yes, old faiths lay supine, stunned by the hammer blows of
science; and science had nothing soul-satisfying to offer in their
place. Surely now, if ever, the age was ripe for a new revelation:
racked by doubts, or cut to the heart by atheistic denial, it cried
aloud for a fresh proof of God's existence, and of God's concern
with man.&mdash;Restlessly feeling his way, Mahony set himself to
take the measure, where he had so far only dabbled in it, of the
new movement spiritualism, which, from its rise in a tiny American
hamlet, had run like a wildfire over Europe. If what its followers
claimed for it was true&mdash;and among them were men of standing
whose words could not be dismissed with a shrug&mdash;if the
spirits of those who had crossed the bourne were really able...as
in the days of Moses and the prophets...to return and speak with
their loved ones&mdash;then it meant that a new crisis had arisen
in man's relation to the Unseen, with which both science and
religion would eventually have to reckon. Unlike the majority, he
was not put off by the commonplace means of communication
employed&mdash;the rappings and the tappings, the laborious telling
over of the alphabet&mdash;nor yet by the choice, as agents, or the
illiterate and immature. He recalled the early history of
Christianity: the Chaldean shepherds; the Judean carpenter's shop;
the unlettered fishermen; the sneers and gibes of Roman society.
God's ways had never been, never would be man's ways. Why, even as
it was, some found the practice of conventional Christianity none
too easy, thanks to the frailty of the human channels through which
the great message had to pass: the supercilious drawl of a
ritualistic parson; one's inability to admit that a bad priest
might read a true Mass; the fact that the celebrant from whom you
received the Eucharist was known to be, in his spare hours, drinker
and gambler, or one of those who systematically hunted small
animals to death. Measured by such stumbling-blocks as these, the
spiritualists' sincere faith and homely conduct of their seances
did not need to shirk comparison. Indeed, there would sometimes
seem to be more genuine piety at their meetings than at many an
ordinary church service. But, however one looked at it, the
question to be answered remained: was it possible to draw from this
new movement proofs of the knowledge one's soul craved&mdash;the
continuity of existence; the nearness, the interwovenness, of the
spiritual world to the material; the eternal and omnipotent
presence of the Creator?</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-7" id="ch-2-2-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>"My papeh dotes on music. Positively, I have known my papeh to
say he would rather go without his port at dinner than his music
after dinner. My papeh has heard all the most famous singers. In
his opinion, no one could compare with Malibran." Thus Miss
Timms-Kelly; and at his cue the chubby, white-haired old Judge,
surreptitiously snatching forty winks in a dark corner of the
drawing-room, would start, open his eyes, and, like a well-trained
parrot, echo his daughter's words.</p>

<p>"Malibran?...ah, now there was a voice for you!&mdash;Pasta
could not hold a candle to her. As a young man I never missed an
opera when she sang. Great nights, great nights! The King's Theatre
packed to suffocation. All of us young music-lovers burning with
enthusiasm...our palms tingling from applause." Here however, at
some private sign, the speaker abruptly switched off his
reminiscences, which threatened to carry him away, and got to the
matter in hand.&mdash;"My dear, give us, if you please, <i>casta
diva</i>. Though I say so myself, there is something in my
daughter's rendering of that divine air that recalls Malibran in
her prime."</p>

<p>A musical party at the Timms-Kellys' tempted even Mahony forth.
On such evenings, in company with other devotees, he would wander
up Richmond Hill and through the wooden gates of Vaucluse, where a
knot of houses stood sequestered in a grove. The French windows of
the Timms-Kellys' drawing-room were invariably set wide open; and
guests climbing the hill could hear, while still some way off, the
great voice peal out&mdash;like a siren-song that urged and
cajoled.</p>

<p>Miss Timms-Kelly herself bore the brunt of the entertainment;
occasionally mingling in a duo with some manly second, or with the
strains of Mahony's flute; but chiefly in solo. For the thin little
tones of the other ladies, their tinkly performances of "Maiden's
Prayers" and "Warblings at Eve," or the rollicking strains of a sea
ballad (which was mostly what the gentlemen were good for) stood
none of them an earthly chance against a voice like hers. It was a
contralto, with, in its middle and lower registers, tones of a
strange, dark intensity which made of it a real <i>voix sombre</i>;
yet of such exceptional compass that it was also equal to <i>or sai
chi l'onore</i> and <i>non mi dir, bell' idol mio</i>. Mahony used
to say there was something in its lower notes that got at you,
"like fingers feeling round your heart." Ladies, while admitting
its volume and beauty, were apt to be rendered rather uncomfortable
by it; and under its influence would fall to fidgeting in their
seats.</p>

<p>In person Miss Timms-Kelly matched her voice: though not over
tall she was generously proportioned, with a superb bust and
exquisitely sloping shoulders. Along with this handsome figure went
piquantly small hands and feet&mdash;she boasted a number three
shoe&mdash;white teeth, full lips, a fresh complexion. But her
chief charm lay in her animation of manner: she was alive with
verve and gesture; her every second word seemed spoken in italics.
Amazing, thought and said all, that one so fascinating should have
reached the brink of the thirties without marrying; society had
known her now for twelve years, and during this time the marvellous
voice had rung out night for night, her old father faithfully
drawing attention to its merits, the while he grew ever whiter and
sleepier in his corner of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>But the little court that surrounded Miss Timms-Kelly consisted
chiefly of married men and bachelors well past marrying age:
greybeards who, in listening to the strains of <i>Norma</i> or
<i>Semiramide</i>, re-lived their youth. Eligible men fought a
little shy of the lady and after a couple of visits to the house
were apt to return no more. Happily, Miss Timms-Kelly did not take
this greatly to heart. Indeed she even confessed to a relief at
their truancy. "All my life, love, I have preferred the company of
<i>elderly</i> gentlemen. They make one feel so <i>safe</i>."</p>

<p>In process of dressing for such an evening, Mary remarked: "Of
course, it's very nice of Lizzie to say that...and most sensible.
But all the same it <i>is</i> odd&mdash;I mean the fact of her
never having married. Not only because of her voice&mdash;one
doesn't just marry a voice. But she really is a dear, warm-hearted
creature. And so generous." At which Mahony stopped shaving his
chin to throw in: "That's precisely it. Your marriageable man
instinctively fears not being able to live up to the fair singer's
generosity."</p>

<p>"<i>Really</i>, Richard!...it takes you to say queer things. Now
I believe it comes of Lizzie never having had a mother to go about
with. She's been obliged to put herself too much forward."</p>

<p>But for all his two-edged comments, let Miss Timms-Kelly but
open her mouth to sing, and Mahony was hopelessly her slave. His
natural instinct for music had outlived even the long years of
starvation in this country, where neither taste nor performance was
worth a straw. Under the present stimulus, his dormant feelings
awoke to new life: when the great voice rang forth he would sit
rapt...absorbed. And where others, but faintly responsive to the
influence, listened with only half an ear, the while they followed
their own trains of thought, musing, gently titillated: "How fine
the moon to-night!" or "I shall certainly succeed, if I carry
through that deal," or "Perhaps after all Julia will hear my suit,"
he surrendered thought for emotion, and climbed the ladder of sound
to a world built wholly of sound, where he moved light-footedly and
at ease.</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, I would walk ten miles to hear her rendering of
an aria by Mozart or Verdi!"</p>

<p>This was all very well in its way&mdash;its musical way. But now
something happened which brought him with a bump to earth. And,
ever after, he twitted and blamed himself with having been the
innocent cause of a most unnecessary complication.</p>

<p>Towards the close of her stay in Ballarat, Mary had a second
meeting&mdash;a chance one, this time&mdash;with Mr. Henry Ocock.
And Ocock, in his new role of friend and adviser, let fall a hint
with regard to a certain mining company in which he believed Mahony
held shares. This was not the case; but Mary rather thought John
did, begged Richard to find out, and if so, to let him know what
was being said. As Mr. Henry's information had been <i>sub
rosa</i>, Mahony thought it wise to pass it on by word of mouth,
and wrote John saying he would drop in for a moment the following
evening, on his way to Richmond: he was bound with his flute for
Vaucluse. In the morning, however, John's groom brought a note
asking him to take pot-luck with the family at six o'clock. Such
things were possible in John's house nowadays, under the fairy rule
of Miss Julia. And so he found himself that night at John's
dinner-table.</p>

<p>As usual at this stage, when he had not seen his brother-in-law
for a time, Mahony's chief sensation on meeting John was one of
discomfort. Without doubt, some great change was at work in John.
Lean as a herring, yellow as a Chinaman, he had been for months
past. But the change in his manner was even more striking. Gone was
much of the high-handedness, the pompous arrogance it had once been
so hard to stomach; gone the opulent wordiness of his
pronunciamentos. He was now in point of becoming a morose and
taciturn sort of fellow; prone, too, to fits of blankness in which,
staring straight before him, he seemed to forget your very
presence. So much at least was plain: John was not taking the
universe by any means so much for granted, as of old.</p>

<p>Money troubles?...such was the first thought that leapt to
Mahony's mind. Then he laughed at himself. John's business
flourished like the green baytree: you never heard of it but it was
putting forth a fresh shoot in a fresh direction. No lack of money
there!&mdash;the notion was just a telling example of how one
instinctively tried to read into another, what had been one's own
chief bogey. Besides, the warning passed on by Mary left John cold:
he waved it aside with a gesture that said: a few thousands more or
less signified nothing to him. Could the wife's idea that he was
fretting over the loss of his boy be the right one? Again, no: that
was just a woman's interpretation: <i>he</i> jumped to money, she
to the emotional, the personal. Then after all it must be John's
health that was causing him anxiety. But a tactful question on this
score called forth so curt a negative that he could not press
it.</p>

<p>Not till the nuts and port were on the table did John shake off
his abstraction. Then his trio of little girls ran into the
room&mdash;with the playful antics of so many tame white
mice&mdash;ran in and rubbed their sleek little comb-ringed heads
against their father's, and climbed over him with their thin little
white-stockinged legs. And John became solely the fond parent,
gathering his children to him, taking the youngest on his knee and
holding her to his watered-silk waistcoat, letting them play with
the long gold chain from which depended his <i>pince-nez</i>, count
his studs with their little fingers, disarrange the ends of his
tie. At the lower end of the table Emmy, who had presided over the
meal a radiant vision in white muslin and blue ribbons, flushed,
drooped her head, and looked as though she were going to cry. For
though the lovely girl had throughout dinner hung distractingly on
her father's lips, he had never so much as glanced in her
direction.</p>

<p>In watching her, Mahony fell into a reverie, so vividly did she
remind him of her dead mother, and the one&mdash;the
only&mdash;time he had seen John's first wife. It was here, in this
very room, that the gracious Emma, the picture of all that was
comely, had dandled her babes. One of the two, like herself, had
vanished from mortal eyes. The other, a full-grown woman in her
turn, was now ripe for her fate.</p>

<p>When Emmy shepherded the little girls to their nursery, he
turned to John. "Upon my soul, it makes a man realise his age, to
see the young ones come on as they do."</p>

<p>Something in this reflection seemed to flick John. His response
was more in his old style. "You say so? For my part I cannot admit
to feeling a day older than I did ten years back. I am not aware of
any decrease of vigour. I still rise at six, take a cold
shower-bath, and attend to business for a couple of hours before
breakfast. I have needed neither to diet myself for a gouty
constitution, nor to coddle myself in flannel. Age? Bah! At
forty-six a man is in the prime of his life!"</p>

<p>After this one outburst, however, he relapsed into his former
moody silence; and they sat smoking, with scant speech, till Mahony
rose to leave. Then it turned out that John had forgotten the
existence of a previous engagement on Mahony's side, and now made a
lame attempt to overthrow it. ("Looks as if he didn't want to be
left to his own thoughts!") This being impossible, Mahony suggested
that John should accompany him, and undertook to guarantee him a
hearty welcome: it would be well worth his while to hear Miss
Timms-Kelly sing. At first John pooh-poohed the suggestion; musical
evenings were not in his line; and though he had knocked up against
old Timms-Kelly at the Club, he had never met the daughter.
However, in the end he allowed himself to be persuaded; and off
they went, in company.</p>

<p>"And that, my dear, was how it came about in the first place. I
dragged him with me, like the fool I was. And, once there, the game
was up. From the moment John entered the drawing-room, your friend
Lizzie made what I can only describe as a dead set at him. She
never took her eyes off him. She talked to him, she talked at him;
she sang for him, asked his opinion of her selections; and there
sat John, who doesn't know doh from re, or a major key from a
minor, tapping his foot to the tune and looking as if he had been a
judge of music all his life. On two occasions afterwards, I found
him there. Mind you, only two. Then came that unfortunate evening
at <i>Ernani</i>. It's no use asking <i>me</i>, Mary, how the
muddle occurred. I can't tell you; I had nothing to do with it. All
I know is, after the opera Mrs. Vance had to be escorted back to
North Melbourne; and this job naturally fell to me, John not being
the man to shoulder unpleasant duties if he can, with propriety,
put them off on some one else. Well, we hired a wagonette and drove
away&mdash;in a violent thunder-shower&mdash;leaving the other
three outside the theatre. But it appears that somehow or other,
what with the rain and the crush, the two of them lost sight of the
old man. According to John's account they stood waiting for him to
turn up till Miss Lizzie's teeth were chattering with cold. There
seemed nothing for it but for him to call a cab and drive her home.
He did so, and the next morning I'm hanged if he doesn't get a
furious letter from the father, accusing them of having slipped off
alone on purpose. John heads straight for Vaucluse to apologise;
and when he gets there the old man hammers the table, declares his
daughter has been compromised, and ends by demanding to know John's
intentions. Now I ask you, what could John&mdash;what could any man
with the feelings of a gentleman&mdash;do, but offer the only
reparation in his power and at once propose for her hand?
Therewith, of course the old boy cools down...becomes amiability
itself. I don't know, my dear, whether John was really guilty of an
indiscretion&mdash;that's his affair. But if you want my candid
opinion, I think the whole thing was a put-up job. Your friend
Lizzie is a veritable Leyden jar."</p>

<p>Mary, whom the news of John's engagement had brought flying home
from Ballarat, here uttered a disclaimer. "Tch! There you go,
Richard...jumping to conclusions...as usual. Still, I must
say...I'm confident, as far as John was concerned, he had no idea
of marrying again. I really don't know what to think."</p>

<p>"Ah! but such a dear, kind, generous creature..."</p>

<p>"Why, so she is. But..."</p>

<p>"But it's another story, eh, when John the Great comes in
question?"</p>

<p>"Don't be sarcastic! You know quite well I'm very fond of
Lizzie. But poor John was so comfortably settled&mdash;I mean with
Miss Julia to look after him. It seemed as if he was going to have
peace at last. And then, think of the upset again for those poor
dear children."</p>

<p>"Indeed and I do. Though, on the other hand...stepmother to two
families...I shouldn't care, love, to take on the job. But there's
another thing, Mary. Your brother is decidedly queer just
now&mdash;I mean in his manner...and appearance. He looks a tired
man. My own opinion is, he's seen the best of his health. Of
course, he's lived a strenuous life&mdash;like all the rest of
us&mdash;and isn't as young as he was. But that's not
enough...doesn't account for everything. And makes what has
happened very disturbing. If only I'd let well alone that
evening...he'd probably never have set eyes on the woman. It is
certainly a lesson to mind one's own business&mdash;even when it's
a question of doing a kindness...or what one thinks a
kindness."&mdash; "My dehling Mary! So we are to be sisters,
love&mdash;actually sisters! I cannot say how overjoyed I am. Never
have I had such a surprise, dehling, as when my papeh informed me
your brother had declared himself. I said: 'Papeh, are you
<i>sure</i> you are not mistaken?' For never had I imagined, love,
that such a clever and accomplished man as your brother would
select <i>me</i>, from all the ladies of his acquaintance. My heart
still flutters when I think of it. I walk on air.&mdash;Yes,
dehling! Though how I shall ever manage to leave my dear papeh, I
do not know."</p>

<p>"Dear Lizzie! I, too, am very glad.&mdash;But what about the
children? Have you thought if it will suit you to be a stepmother?
Emmy is a grown girl now&mdash;turned seventeen."</p>

<p>"Mary! The dehlings! The poor neglected lambs! Why, I yearn,
dearest, simply yearn to show them a mother's love."</p>

<p>But on Emmy being presented, Lizzie's fervour suffered a visible
abatement. Even to Mary's eye. And an embrace given and received,
her stepmother-to-be looked the girl up and down, with a coolness
which not even her extreme warmth of manner could conceal.</p>

<p>"My dehling! Why, Mary, love, I had no idea&mdash;positively I
had not...I declare it will be like having a younger
sister.&mdash;My dehling girl! And I will show you how to dress
your hair, love&mdash;two puffs, one on each side of the
parting&mdash;it will be a <i>great</i> improvement to your
appearance. That will please papeh, won't it? His dear <i>pet</i>,
I feel sure. Who will be able to tell me <i>all</i> his little
ways."</p>

<p>Emmy wept.</p>

<p>"I <i>hate</i> the way she does her hair, Aunt Mary. I wouldn't
wear mine like that&mdash;not for anything! And I'm <i>not</i>
going to show her how papa likes things done.&mdash;Oh, couldn't I
come and live with you and Uncle Richard? I shall never be happy
here, any more. Why does papa want to get married? Auntie Julia
always promised me I should keep house for him, and he would learn
to like me in time. And now...now..."</p>

<p>It was not for a daughter to sit in judgment on her father, and
Mary gently rebuked Emmy, even while she reflected that the girl
had really a great deal of John's own spirit in her. Lizzie would
not find her new position a bed of roses. For neither did the
little ones take to her. They clung to Auntie Julia's hands and
skirts&mdash;although, to these children who were without personal
beauty, their future mother was still more gracious than to Emmy.
At first, that was. Afterwards, remarked Mahony who was present at
the introduction: afterwards when she saw that they were not to be
cozened into friendliness, she made him think of a pretended animal
lover, who, on a dog failing to respond to his advances, looks as
though he will presently kick it on the sly. But then Richard had
flown to the other extreme, and become both prejudiced and unfair,
not being able to get over the march that had been stolen on
him.</p>

<p>But to such a bagatelle as the likes or dislikes of a parcel of
children Miss Timms-Kelly paid small heed. She had other and more
important fish to fry. The engagement was to be as brief as
propriety admitted; and she was hard put to it to get her trousseau
bought, furniture chosen, the affairs of her maidenhood set in
order. Through the apartments of her new home she swept like a
whirlwind...like a whirlwind, too, overthrowing and destroying.
Painters and paperhangers were already hard at work. For much
company would be seen there after the wedding, great receptions
held: as the Honourable Mrs. Turnham she would move not only in
musical circles, but in the wider world of politics. John's
prospects were of the best: it was an open secret that, for his
services in the Devine ministry, he would probably receive a
knighthood. And small wonder, thought Mary, that Lizzie found the
house shabby and antiquated. Nothing had been done to it since the
day on which John, in his first ardour, had dressed it for his
first bride.</p>

<p>Now, drastic changes were in progress. The old mahogany
four-poster with its red rep curtains&mdash;"Jinny's bed," as it
persisted in Mary's mind&mdash;was to be replaced by one of the new
French testers, with canopy and curtains at the head only. (A
rather risky innovation at John's age!) Oval plate-glass mirrors in
gilt frames, with bunches of candelabra attached, were hung round
the drawing-room walls: a splendid Collard and Collard ousted the
old piano; bouquets of wax flowers and fruit under glass shades
topped the whatnots; horsehair gave way to leather. And the
nursery, which stood next John's own bedroom, was requisitioned by
Lizzie as a boudoir, the children being relegated to the back of
the house.</p>

<p>And John?&mdash;To the four eyes that watched him, with
curiosity and a motherly anxiety, John's attitude came as a
surprise and a relief. He was regularly caught up in the whirl;
and, for once leaving both business and politics in the lurch,
danced attendance on his affianced from morning till night. Though
he still had a haggard air, and certainly nowadays looked what he
was, an elderly man, yet a wave of new life ran through him. In his
attire he grew almost as dapper as of old. It seemed as if he was
determined to carry the affair off with a high hand. He spared no
expense, baulked at no alteration; and the ring that sparkled on
Lizzie's plump finger was, even in this land of showy jewellery, so
costly and magnificent as to draw all eyes. Nor would he have been
human, had he not at heart felt proud of the fine figure cut by his
bride-elect. He <i>was</i> proud, and showed it. More: when he
returned from his wedding-trip to Sydney and the Blue Mountains,
every one could see that he was very much in love.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-8" id="ch-2-2-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>It was a promise of long standing that, once fairly settled in
her new house, Mary should invite to stay with her those of her
friends to whom she lay under an obligation. She had plenty of room
for them, plenty of time; all that remained to do was to fix the
order of their coming.</p>

<p>First, though, she charged herself with Emmy and the children:
to get them out of the workpeople's way, and after the
wedding&mdash;it was celebrated at All Saints, Brighton, and proved
a very swell affair indeed, John's four daughters following the
bride up the aisle&mdash;to leave Miss Julia free to give the final
touches to the house. Emmy cried bitterly when the day came to
return to it: all Mary's reasoning and persuading had not succeeded
in plucking from the girl's heart the sting this third marriage of
her father's had implanted there. A great hope had been dashed in
Emmy; and she went back hot with resentment against the intruder.
The young ones were easier to manage. The excitement of the
wedding, new frocks, new dolls, helped them over the break. For
them, too, this would not be so complete. Miss Julia proposed to
open a select school for the daughters of gentlemen, at which the
three little girls were to be day-pupils.</p>

<p>Not a word had passed between Mary and Miss Julia in criticism
of John's marriage. Their eyes just met for a moment in a look of
complete understanding ("Oh, these men...these men!"). Then with a
nod and a sigh they set resolutely to making the best of
things&mdash;a task, said Mahony, in which the wife had at last
found her peer.</p>

<p>John's affairs having thus once more slipped from her grasp,
Mary devoted herself to the long line of visitors who now crossed
the threshold of "Ultima Thule."</p>

<p>Louisa Urquhart headed the list. Louisa arrived one afternoon at
Spencer Street railway station, and was drawn from the train, her
bonnet askew, her cheeks scarlet with excitement at having
undertaken without escort the four-hour journey from Ballarat. And
after Louisa, who far outstayed her welcome, came Agnes Ocock and
her children and her children's nurses; came Zara and her husband,
in search of expert medical advice; Jerry and his Fanny, the latter
in a delicate state of health; a couple of Ned's progeny; Amelia
Grindle and a sickly babe; came Mrs. Tilly: not to speak of other,
less intimate acquaintances.</p>

<p>Mahony groaned. It was all very well for Mary to say that, if he
wished to be alone, he had only to go into his study and shut the
door. He could and did retire there. But, like other doors, this,
too, had a handle; and since Mary could never get it into her head
that to be busy among your books was to be seriously busy, the
petty interruptions he suffered were endless. Take, for example,
the case of Louisa Urquhart. This was by no means exhausted with
the stitching of a rose in a drab bonnet. Louisa had lived so long
in semi-invalid retirement that she was little better than a cretin
with regard to the small, practical affairs of life. She did not
know how to stamp a letter or tie up a newspaper for the post;
could not buy a pair of gloves or cross a crowded street without
assistance. They had to accompany her everywhere. She also lived in
a perpetual nervous flutter lest some accident should happen at
Yarangobilly while she was absent: the house catch fire, or one of
the children take a fit. "That Willy will not do a bolt with a less
dismal party than she, it would be rash indeed to assume! Of all
the woebegone wet-blankets..." Mahony was disgruntled: it spoilt
his appetite for breakfast to listen to Louisa's whining, did she
learn by the morning post that one of her infants had the
stomach-ache; or to look on at the heroic efforts made by Mary to
disperse the gloom. (The wife's tender patience with the noodles
she gathered round her invariably staggered him afresh.) Then
parties must needs be given in Louisa's honour&mdash;and the honour
of those who came after; the hours for meals disarranged, put
backwards or forwards to suit the home habits of the particular
guest.</p>

<p>Even more disturbing was the visit of Mrs. Henry which followed.
Here, he could not but share Mary's apprehensions lest something
untoward should happen which might give servants or acquaintances
an inkling of how matters stood. As for poor Mary, she grew quite
pale and peaked with the strain; hardly dared let Agnes out of her
sight. At dinner-parties&mdash;and the best people had to be asked
to meet the wife of so important a personage as Mr. Henry&mdash;her
eye followed the decanters their rounds with an anxiety painful to
see. (Between-times, she kept the chiffonier strictly locked.)
During this visit, too, the servants made difficulties by refusing
to wait on the strange nursemaids, who gave themselves airs; while,
to cap all, a pair of the rowdiest and worst-behaved children ever
born romped in the passage, or trampled the flower-beds in the
garden. No walls were thick enough to keep out their noise; any
more than the fact of being in a stranger's house could improve
their manners. The walls were also powerless against Zara's
high-pitched, querulous voice, or the good Ebenezer's fits of
coughing, which shook the unfortunate man till his very bones
seemed to rattle. Later on, for variety, they had the shrill
screaming of Amelia Grindle's sick babe (with Mary up and down at
night, preparing bottles); had Ned's children to be tamed and
taught to blow their noses; pretty Fanny tumbling into faints half
a dozen times a day. Of course, there was no earthly reason why all
these good people should not make his home theirs&mdash;oh dear no!
If Jerry got a fortnight's holiday, what more natural than that he
should choose to spend it in his sister's comfortable,
well-appointed house, rather than in his own poky weatherboard? If
Mrs. Devine wanted to take sea-air ("And, really, Richard, one
<i>has</i> to remember how extraordinarily kind she was to us on
landing"), the least one could do was to beg her to exchange Toorak
for Brighton-on-Beach. Only the fact of John's house being but a
paltry half-hour's walk distant, and the ozone both families
breathed of the same brand, saved them from having John and Lizzie
quartered on them as well.</p>

<p>Yes, Mary's hospitality was rampageous&mdash;no other word would
describe it. He had given her <i>carte blanche</i> and he kept to
his bond; but as time went on his groans increased in volume, he
was sarcastic at the expense of "Mrs. Mahony's Benevolent Asylum,"
and openly counted the days till he should have his house to
himself again. A quiet evening was a thing of the past; he was
naturally expected to escort the ladies to their various
entertainments. Besides, he was "only reading." What selfishness to
shut yourself up with a book, when a visitor's amusement was in
question! For, as usual, Mary's solicitude was all for others. Much
less consideration was shown him personally than in the old
Ballarat days. Then, he had been the breadwinner, the wage-earner,
and any disturbance of his life's routine meant a corresponding
disturbance in their income. Here, with money flowing in without
effort, and abundantly&mdash;as it continued to do-there was no
such practical reason to respect his privacy. And so it was:
"Richard, will you answer these cards for me?" "See to the
decanting of the port?" "Leave an order at the fruiterer's?" "Book
seats for <i>East Lynne</i>, or <i>Maritana?</i>"</p>

<p>In this hugger-mugger fashion week after week, month after month
ran away. Then, however, things seemed to be tailing off, and he
was just congratulating himself that he had bowed the last guest
out, when Tilly arrived, and back they fell into the old atmosphere
of fuss and flutter. Tilly had originally stood high on Mary's
list. Then, for some reason which was not made clear to him, her
visit had been postponed; and he had comfortably forgotten all
about it.</p>

<p>Once she was there, though, it was impossible to forget Tilly,
even for an hour. Her buxom, bouncing presence filled the house.
There was no escape from her strident voice, her empty, noisy
laugh. The very silk of her gowns seemed to rustle more loudly than
other women's; and she had a foot like a grenadier. The truth was,
his old aversion to Tilly, and the type she represented, broke out
anew directly she crossed his door-sill. And three times a day he
was forced to sit next her at meals, attend to her wants, and
listen, as civilly as he might, to her crude comments on people and
things.</p>

<p>In vain did Mary harp on Tilly's sterling qualities. Before a
week was out, Mahony swore he would prefer fewer virtues and more
tact. Goodness of heart could be rated too highly. Why should not
quick-wittedness, and sensitiveness to your neighbour's tender
places, also be counted to your credit? Why must it always be the
blunt-tongued, the hob-nailed of approach, who got all the
praise?</p>

<p>It was at the dinner-table where, in the course of talk, the
burning question of spirits and spirit-phenomena had come up; and
Mary &mdash;Mary, not he: it would never have occurred to him to
dilate on the theme before such as Tilly!&mdash;had told of the
raps and movements of furniture that were taking place at the house
of a Mrs. Phayre, a prominent member of Melbourne society. Now
Tilly knew very well he did <i>not</i> belong to those who
dismissed such happenings with a smile and a shrug. Yet the mere
mention of them was enough to send her off into an unmannerly
guffaw.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!...ha, ha, ha! To see your furniture jumping about the
room! I'D pretty soon nab the slavey&mdash;you take my word for it,
Mary, it's the slavey&mdash;who played such tricks on me. I'D
bundle 'er off with a flea in 'er ear."</p>

<p>A glance at Richard showed him black as thunder. Mary adroitly
changed the subject. But afterwards she came back on it.</p>

<p>"It's all very well, Richard, but you can't expect a
common-sense person like Tilly <i>not</i> to be amused by that sort
of thing."</p>

<p>"And pray do you mean to imply that every one who does not mock
and jeer is devoid of sense?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. Besides, I didn't say sense; I said common
sense."</p>

<p>"Well, since you yourself bring in the 'common,' I'll quote you
the dictum of a famous man. 'Commonplace minds usually condemn
everything that is beyond the scope of their understanding.'"</p>

<p>"How sweeping! And so conceited. But Tilly is <i>not</i>
commonplace. In many ways, she's just as capable as her mother was.
But I don't think we ought to be discussing her. While she's our
visitor."</p>

<p>"Good God! Is one to go blind and dumb because a fool is under
one's roof?"</p>

<p>"Well, really! I do wonder what you'll say next." Mary was hurt
and showed it.</p>

<p>But Mahony did not try to conciliate her. He had a further
ground for annoyance. Ever since Tilly had come to the house, that
side of Mary's nature had prevailed with which he was least in
sympathy. Never had she seemed so deadly practical, and lacking in
humour; so instinctively antagonistic to the imaginative and
speculative sides of life. Her attitude, for example, to the
subject under discussion. At bottom, this was no whit different
from Tilly's. "<i>That</i> sort of thing," said as Mary said it,
put her opinion of the new movement in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Out of this irritation he now demanded: "Tell me: are we never
in this world to have our house to ourselves again?"</p>

<p>"But, Richard, Tilly <i>had</i> to come!...after the time I
stayed with her. And now she's here&mdash;even though you despise
her so&mdash;we've got to do all we can to make her visit a
success. I should hate her to think we didn't consider her good
enough to introduce to our friends."</p>

<p>"Among whom she fits about as well as a porpoise in a basin of
goldfish."</p>

<p>"As if a porpoise could get inside a basin! How wildly you do
talk! Besides you don't mean it. For if ever there was a person
particular about paying debts, it's you."</p>

<p>Late one afternoon he came in from the garden, where he had been
superintending the laying out of a new shrubbery. Only the day
before he had found, to his dismay, that a gap in the screening
hedge of lauristinus and pittosporums allowed of errand-boys and
nursemaids spying on a privacy he had believed absolute. The
thought was unbearable. But the change had cost him a fierce tussle
with his pig-headed Scot of a gardener, who held there were already
too many shrubs about the place. Now he felt hot and tired.</p>

<p>As he crossed the verandah Mary came rustling out of the
dining-room. She looked mysterious, but also, if he knew his Mary,
a trifle uncomfortable. "Richard! I've got a surprise for you. I
want you in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose it will keep till I've washed the dust off."
The drawing-room spelt visitors; and he had looked forward to pipe
and book.</p>

<p>In course of making a hasty toilet, however, he pricked up his
ears. Down the passage came the tones of a voice that seemed
strangely familiar. And, sure enough, when he entered the room he
found what he expected: the visitor Tilly was entertaining with
such noisy gusto was no other than Purdy.</p>

<p>Purdy sat on the circular yellow-silk ottoman, in the easiest of
attitudes. With one leg stuck straight out before him, he hugged
the other to him by the knee, rocking his body backwards and
forwards as he told what was evidently a capital story&mdash;to
judge by his own roars of laughter and Tilly's purple face and
moist eyes, at which she made feeble dabs with her
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>The shock of the encounter drove the semblance of a hearty
greeting out of Mahony. But with this he had exhausted himself;
Purdy and he could find no points of contact; and after a few
halting remarks and awkward pauses, Purdy faced round to Tilly
again and took up the broken thread of his yarn. And from now on,
both there and at the high tea to which Mary presently led them,
Mahony sat silent and constrained. For one thing, he disdained
competition with Tilly in her open touting for Purdy's notice.
Again, as he looked and listened, he understood Mary's discomfort
and embarrassment. On the occasion of last seeing Purdy, they had
both been giddy with excitement. Now the scales fell from his eyes.
This, his former intimate and friend? This common, shoddy little
man, already pot-bellied and bald?&mdash;whose language was that of
the tap-room and the stable; who sat there bragging of the shady
knowledge he had harvested in dark corners, blowing to impress the
women; one of life's failures and aware of it, and, just for this
reason, cocksure, bitter, intolerant&mdash;a self-lover to the Nth
degree. In the extravagant fables they were asked to swallow, he,
Purdy, had seen the best of everything, the worst of everything,
had always been in the thick of a fray and in at the finish.</p>

<p>Well! one person present seemed to enjoy the tasteless
performance, and that was Tilly, who hung on his lips. She even
urged him to repeat some of his tallest stories, for the benefit of
Mary who had been out of the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, love, you <i>must</i> 'ear that yarn of the splitter and
the goanna. I've laughed to burst my sides. Go on, Purd, tell it
again. It was a regular corker." And, belonging to the class of
those who pre-indulge, Tilly hee-hawed at full lung-strength in
anticipation of the coming joke. After which Mahony had to listen
for the second time to some witless anecdote, the real point of
which was to show Purdy in his role of top dog.</p>

<p>Was it possible that he had ever enjoyed, or even put up with
this kind of thing? Had Purdy always been a vainglorious braggart,
or had the boasting habit grown on him as he went downhill? Of
course he himself had not become more tolerant as the years went
by; and he could afford to yield to his antipathies, now that no
business reasons made civility incumbent. But there was more in it
than this. In earlier days a dash of the old boyish affection had
persisted, to blind him to Purdy's failings; just as the memory of
their boyhood's standing&mdash;he the senior, Purdy the
junior&mdash;had caused Purdy to look up to him and defer to his
opinion. Now, nothing of this remained. On either side.
Long-suffering, deference, affection had alike been flung on time's
scrap-heap&mdash;at least, during the two distasteful hours spent
in Purdy's company, not even the ghosts of such feelings stirred.
Then what had brought him back? Mere tuft-hunting? Where, too, in
the name of Christendom had Mary fished him up, who would have been
so much better left in obscurity? Had she really fancied she would
give him, Mahony, a pleasure thereby? <i>Poor Mary!</i></p>

<p>But the thin smile of amusement that curled his lips at the
thought faded, when he heard her pressing Purdy to come again. And
the first time he got her alone&mdash;it was not till
bedtime&mdash;he took her soundly to task.</p>

<p>"Your surprise this afternoon was a surprise indeed&mdash;in
more ways than one. But what possessed you, Mary, to ask him to
repeat the visit? My dear, you must surely see for yourself we
cannot have the eyesore he has become, about this house?"</p>

<p>Mary paused in the act of slipping the rings off her fingers and
on the branches of her ring-tree, and looked surprised.
"<i>What</i>, Richard? Your <i>oldest</i> friend?" But Mahony,
versed in every lightest expression that flitted across the candid
face before him, felt the emphasis to be overdone. Like himself it
was plain Mary had suffered something of a shock.</p>

<p>So he swallowed a caustic rejoinder, and said dryly: "I know
your intentions were of the best. But...well, frankly, my dear, I
think it's bad enough if you fill the house with <i>your</i> old
friends."</p>

<p>He was right. Her discomfiture showed in the way she now flared
up. "Fill the house?...with only one person here at a time, and
never more than two? But&mdash;since you put it that way,
Richard&mdash;I think it's rather a good thing I do. If we are ever
to see anyone at all!"</p>

<p>"Give me books and I don't want people."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've no patience with such a selfish standpoint. Whatever
would be the good of all this&mdash;I mean the nice house, and our
not needing to worry about expense&mdash;if we didn't ask other
people to share it with us?"</p>

<p>"Pray, have I hindered you from doing so?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly. But why start to grumble now, when it's a
question of your best friend?"</p>

<p>At the repetition his patience failed him. "Best friend! Oldest
friend! Good heavens, Mary! do think what you are saying. How can
one continue to be friends with a person one never sees or hears
of? Surely the word implies somebody with whom one has at least
<i>half</i> an idea in common? People don't stand still in this
world. They're always growing and changing&mdash;up or down or off
at a tangent. <i>Panta rei</i> is the eternal truth: <i>Semper
idem</i> the lie we long to see confirmed. And to hug a sentimental
memory of what a mortal once was to you, and go on trying to
bolster up an intimacy on the strength of it&mdash;why, that's to
drag a dead carcase behind you, which impedes your own
progress.&mdash;No, the real friend is one you pick up at certain
points in your life, whose way runs along with yours&mdash;for a
time. A time only. A milestone on your passage&mdash;no more. Few
or none march together the whole way."</p>

<p>"Milestones? Why not tombstones while you're about it?" cried
Mary hotly, repudiating a theory that seemed to her wholly perverse
"Of course, you're able to use words I don't understand; but I say,
once a friend, always a friend. I know I'D be sorry to forget
anyone I had ever liked&mdash;even if I didn't find much to talk to
them about. But you must always have your own ideas. I declare
you're going on now about people just as you do about places, about
not wanting to see them again once you've left."</p>

<p>"Yes, places and people&mdash;one as the other. Let me face
forward&mdash;not back. But to return to the matter in hand: I
don't mind telling you I'd gladly <i>pay</i> our visitor of this
afternoon to stop away...and drink his tea elsewhere."</p>

<p>"I never heard such a thing!" Then, however, another thought
struck her. "You're not letting that silly old affair in Ballarat
still prejudice you against him?"</p>

<p>Mahony laughed out loud. "Good Lord, no! The grass has been
green over that for what seems like half a century."</p>

<p>"Then it's because he drank his tea out of his saucer&mdash;and
things like that."</p>

<p>"Tch!" On the verge of letting his temper get away with him,
Mahony pulled up. "Well, my dear...well, perhaps you're not
altogether wrong. I'll put it even more plainly though. Mary, it's
because he spoke and looked like what I veritably believe him to
be: an ostler in some stable. Horsey checks, dirty nails, sham
brilliants; and a mind and tongue to match. No, I stick to what
I've said: I'd offer him a ten-pound note to stop away."</p>

<p>"I never knew anyone so hard on people as you."</p>

<p>"Come, <i>do</i> I need to mix with ostlers at my time of
life?...and in my present position. It's not my fault that I've
gone up in the world and he down."</p>

<p>"No, but all the more reason not to turn your back on somebody
who hasn't had your luck."</p>

<p>"I deny that I'm a snob. I'd invite my butcher or my baker to
the house any day, so long as he had decent manners and took an
interest in what interests me."</p>

<p>"My dear Richard, you only say that because you know you'll
never have to! And if you did, you wouldn't like them a bit better
than you do Purdy. But I'm sure I sometimes don't know what's
coming over you. You used to be such a stickler for remembering old
friends and old kindnesses, and hadn't bad enough to say about
people who didn't. I believe it was the going home that changed
you. Yet when you were in England, how you railed at people there
for letting themselves be influenced by a person's
outside&mdash;how he ate peas, or drank his soup, and things like
that."</p>

<p>"England had nothing whatever to do with it. But it was a very
different thing in Ballarat, Mary, where my practice brought me up
against all sorts of people to whom I was forced to be civil. Now,
there's no such obligation. And so I decline, once and for all, to
exhibit the specimen we saw to-day to our social circle. If you're
absolutely bent on befriending him&mdash;and I know doing good is,
to you, the temptation strong drink is to others&mdash;although in
my opinion, my dear, you'll end by <i>over</i>doing it: you've not
looked yourself for weeks past. If you must have Purdy here, kindly
let it be when no one else is present, and if possible when I, too,
am out of the way. What you're to say about me? Anything you like.
He won't miss me so long as your friend Tilly is at hand to drink
in his words. You certainly hit the bull's-eye this time, my dear,
in providing her with entertainment. Purdy's egregious lying was
pabulum after her own heart."</p>

<p>With which Richard slung a towel round his neck and retired to
the bathroom, leaving Mary to the reflection that, if ever there
was a person who knew how to complicate the doing of a simple
kindness, it was Richard. Here he went, detesting Tilly with all
his old fervour and dead set from the start against Purdy and his
coming to the house. (It was true Purdy had got rather loud and
bumptious; but a sensible woman like Tilly might be trusted soon to
knock the nonsense out of him.) Meanwhile she, Mary, had somehow to
propitiate all three; and in particular to hinder Richard from
showing what he felt. For if the match came off, Purdy would become
a rich and important personage to whom every door would open. And
then Richard, too, would come round&mdash;would have to. If, that
was, she could meanwhile contrive to keep him from making lifelong
enemies of the happy pair.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-2-9" id="ch-2-2-9"></a>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>Tilly said:</p>

<p>"My dear! the minute I set eyes on 'er, I knew she was a fraud.
And I thinks to myself: 'Just you wait, milady, till the lights go
out, and I'll cook your goose for you!' Well, sure enough, there we
all sat 'and-in-hand in the dark, like a party of kids playing
'unt-the-slipper. And by-and-by one and another squeals: 'I'm
touched!' What do I do, Mary? Why, I gradually work the hand I'm
'olding in me right, closer to me left, till I'd got <i>them</i>
joined and me right 'and free. (It's as easy as Punch if you know
'ow to do it.) And when the man next me&mdash;oh, 'e <i>was</i> a
solemn old josser!&mdash;when 'e said in a voice that seemed to
come from 'is boots: 'The spirits 'ave deigned to touch
me'&mdash;as if 'e'd said: 'God Almighty 'as arrived and is
present!'&mdash;I made one grab, and got 'old of&mdash;now what do
you think? I'm danged if it wasn't 'er false chignon I found in my
hand. I thought she was going to give me the slip then, after all:
she wriggled like an eel. But I held on like grim death and,
luckily for me, she'd a few 'airs left still clinging to her
cranium. She squeals like a pig. 'Up with the lights,' says I;
'I've got 'er!' 'Turn up the lights if you dare,' cries she: 'it'll
kill me.' Over goes a chair in the scrimmage, and then they did
turn 'em up, and there was she squirming on the floor, bald like an
egg, with I don't know how many false gloves and feathers and
things pinned on to 'er body!"</p>

<p>Tilly sat by the fire in Mary's bedroom, her black silk skirts
turned back from the blaze. She was in high feather, exhilarated by
her own acumen as by the smartness with which she had conducted the
exposure. Opposite her Mary, her head tied up in red flannel,
crippled by the heavy cold and the face-ache that had confined her
to the house, listened with a sinking heart. It was all very well
for Tilly to preen herself on what she had done: Richard would see
it in a very different light. He had gone straight to his study on
entering; and hurrying out in her dressing-gown to learn what had
brought the two of them home so early, Mary had caught a glimpse of
his face. It was enough. When Richard looked like that, all was
over. His hatred of a scene in public amounted to a mania.</p>

<p>It was most discouraging. For a fortnight past she had done
everything a friend could do, to advance Tilly's suit; plotting and
planning, always with an anxious ear to the study-door, in a
twitter lest Richard should suddenly come out and complain about
the noise. For the happy couple, to whom she had given up the
drawing-room, conversed in tones that were audible throughout the
house: a louder courtship Mary had never heard; it seemed to
consist chiefly of comic stories, divided one from the next by
bursts of laughter. Personally she thought the signs and portents
would not be really favourable till the pair grew quieter: every
wooing <i>she</i> had assisted at had been punctuated by long, long
silences, in which the listener puzzled his brains to imagine what
the lovers could be doing. However, Tilly seemed satisfied. After
an afternoon of this kind she went into the seventh heaven, and
leaning on Mary's neck shed tears of joy: it <i>was</i> a case of
middle-aged lovesickness and no mistake! True, she also knew
moments of uncertainty, when things seemed to hang fire, under the
influence of which she would vehemently declare: "Upon my soul,
Mary love, if <i>he</i> doesn't, I shall! I feel it in my bones." A
state of mind which alarmed Mary and made her exclaim: "Oh no,
don't, Tilly!&mdash;don't do that. I'm sure you'd regret it. You
know, later on he might cast it up at you."</p>

<p>And now Tilly had probably spoilt everything, by her hasty,
ill-considered action.</p>

<p>Fortunately for her she didn't realise how deeply she had
sinned; though even she could see that Richard was angry. "Of
course, love, the doctor's in a bit of a taking. I couldn't get a
word out of 'im all the way 'ome.&mdash;Lor', Mary, what geese men
are, to be sure!...even the best of 'em. Not to speak of the
cleverest. To see all those learned old mopokes sitting there
to-night, solemn as hens on eggs...it was enough to make a cat
laugh. But even if 'e <i>does</i> bear me a bit of a grudge, it
can't be helped. I'm not a one, love, to sit by and see a cheat and
keep my mouth shut. A fraud's a fraud, and even if it's the Queen
'erself."</p>

<p>"Of course it is. I feel just the same as you. It makes my blood
boil to watch Richard, with all his brains, letting himself be
duped by some dishonest creature who only wants to make money out
of him. But...when he once gets an idea in his head...And he's not
a bit <i>grateful</i> for having his eyes opened."</p>

<p>Grateful, indeed! When, after an hour's solitude which might
really have been expected to cool him down, he came into the
bedroom, his very first words were: "Either that woman leaves the
house, or I go myself!"</p>

<p>For all Mary's firm resolve to act as peacemaker, this was more
than she could swallow. "Richard, don't be so absurd! We can't turn
a visitor out. Decency forbids."</p>

<p>"It's <i>my</i> house, and for me to say whom I'll have in
it."</p>

<p>"Tilly's <i>my</i> friend, and I'm not going to have her
insulted." Mary's tone was as dogged as his own.</p>

<p>"No! but she is at liberty to insult mine...and make me a
laughing-stock into the bargain. Such a scandalous scene as
to-night's, it has never been my lot to witness."</p>

<p>"However did it happen that you held a seance? The invitation
only said cards and music. I'd have kept her at home if I'd
guessed, knowing her opinion of that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I wish to God you had! You talk of decency? You need hardly
worry, I think, in the case of a person who has so few decent
feelings of her own. If you could have heard her! 'I got 'er! Up
with the gas! I'm 'olding 'er&mdash;by 'er false
'air!'"&mdash;Mahony gave the imitation with extravagant emphasis.
"I leave it to you to imagine the rest. That voice...the scattered
aitches...the gauche and vulgar manner...the medium weeping and
protesting...your friend parleying and exclaiming&mdash;at the top
of her lungs, too&mdash;glorying in what she had done as if it was
something to be proud of, and blind as a bat to the thunder-glances
that were being thrown at her...no! I shall never forget it. She
has rendered me impossible&mdash;in a house where till now I have
been an honoured guest."</p>

<p>The exaggeration of this statement nettled Mary. She clicked her
tongue. "Oh, <i>don't</i> be so silly! Surely you can write and
explain? Mrs. Phayre will understand...that you had nothing to do
with it."</p>

<p>"Who am I that I should have to explain and apologise?&mdash;and
for the behaviour of a person she did us the courtesy to
invite."</p>

<p>"But considering the woman <i>was</i> a fraud? Tilly vows she
had all sorts of contrivances pinned to her body."</p>

<p>"There you go! Ready, as usual, to believe any one rather than
me! She was no more a fraud than I am. She came to us well attested
by circles of the highest standing. Yet in spite of this, an
ignorant outsider, who is present at a sitting for the first time
in her life, has the insolence to set herself up as a
judge.&mdash;Mary! I've put up with the job lot you call your
friends for more than a twelvemonth. But this is the last straw.
Out she goes, and that's the end of it!"</p>

<p>But this flicked Mary on the raw. "You seem to forget
<i>some</i> of the job lot were my own relations."</p>

<p>"Oh, now get touchy, do! You know very well what I mean. But
enough's enough. I can stand no more."</p>

<p>"You talk as if you were the sole person to be considered. As
usual, think of nobody but yourself."</p>

<p>"Ha! I like that," cried Mahony, exasperated. "I think I'm
possessed of the patience of Job, if you ask me. For there's never
been a soul among them with whom I had two ideas in common."</p>

<p>"No, you prefer these wretched mediums and the silly people who
are taken in by them. I wish spiritualism had never been
invented!"</p>

<p>"Don't talk about what you don't understand!"</p>

<p>"I <i>do</i>. I know nearly every time we go out now, I have to
sit by and watch you letting yourself be humbugged. And then I'm
not to open my mouth, or say what I see, or have any opinion of my
own."</p>

<p>"No! I should leave that to the superior wits of your
friend."</p>

<p>"I think it's abominable the way you sneer at Tilly! But if you
do it just to get her out of the house, you're on the wrong tack.
She's <i>not</i> going just now, and that's all about it. Any one
but you would understand what's happening. But you're so taken up
with yourself that you never see a thing&mdash;not if it's under
your very nose!"</p>

<p>"Pray what do you mean by that? <i>What</i> is happening?"
Pierced by a sudden suspicion Mahony swung round and faced her.
"Good Lord, Mary!"...his voice trailed off in a kind of incredulous
disgust. "Good Lord! You don't want to tell me you're trying to
bolster up a match between this woman and...and Purdy?"</p>

<p>Mary tightened her lips and did not reply.</p>

<p>Mahony's irritation burst its bounds. "Well, upon my
soul!...well, of all the monstrous pieces of folly!" After which he
broke off, to throw in caustically: "Of course if it comes to that,
I 'll allow they're well matched...in manners and appearance. But
the fellow's an incorrigible waster. He'll make ducks and drakes of
old Ocock's hard-earned pile. Besides, has he shown the least
desire for matrimony? Are you not lending yourself to a vulgar
intrigue on the woman's part? If so, let me tell you that it's
beneath your dignity&mdash;your dignity as my wife&mdash;and I for
one decline to permit anything so offensive to go on under my roof.
Not to speak of having to see you bear the blame, should things go
wrong."</p>

<p>"No, really, Richard! this is too much," cried Mary, and bounced
up from her seat. "For <i>goodness</i> sake, let me manage my own
affairs! To hear you talk, any one would think I was still a child,
to be told what I may and mayn't do&mdash;instead of a middle-aged
woman. I'm quite able to judge for myself; yes! and take the
consequences, too. But you blow me up just as if I wasn't a person
for myself at all, but only your wife. Besides, I think you might
show a <i>little</i> confidence in me. I shan't disgrace you, even
if I am fool enough to bring two people together again who were
once so fond of each other. Which you seem to have quite forgotten.
Though your own common sense might tell you. Tilly's alone in the
world, and has more money than she knows what to do with. And he
has none. I think you can safely leave it to her to look after her
own interests. She's a good deal sharper than any of us, you
included. And Purdy, too. You sneer at him for an ostler and a
ne'er-do-well. He's nothing of the sort. For six months now he's
worked hard as a traveller in jewellery." ("Ha!...<i>that</i>
explains the sham diamonds, the rings, the breastpins.") "There you
go!...sneering again. And here am I, struggling and striving to
keep the peace between you, till I don't know whether I'm standing
on my head or my heels. And as far as you're concerned, it's not
the least bit of good. I think you grow more selfish and perverse
day by day. You ought to have lived on a desert island, all by
yourself. Oh, I'm tired...sick and tired...of it and of
everything!"&mdash;and having said her say, passionately and at top
speed, Mary suddenly broke down and burst out crying.</p>

<p>Mahony's anger was laid on the instant. "Why, my dear!...why,
Mary...what's all this about? Come, come, love!"&mdash;as her sobs
increased in violence&mdash;"this will never do. There's nothing to
upset yourself over. The fact is, as you say, you're tired out. We
shall be having you ill in earnest if this goes on. And small
wonder, I'm sure. I declare, as soon as you're rid of your cold I
shall shut this place up and take you away from everybody, on a
trip to Sydney and the Blue Mountains."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go to Sydney. I only want to be left alone, and
not have my friends insulted and turned out of the house."</p>

<p>"Good God, wife!...surely you can give me credit for some small
degree of tact? But now, enough. You lie still and go to sleep. Or
as I say, we shall have you really ill."</p>

<p>"Oh, leave me out of it, do. I shall be all right in the
morning."</p>

<p>But this was not the case. Mary coughed and tossed, and went
from hot to cold and cold to hot, for the greater part of the
night. In the morning her head felt a ton weight on the pillow. It
was no good chafing; in bed she had to stay. Mahony and Tilly faced
each other in glum silence across the length of the
breakfast-table.</p>

<p>The next few days bringing no improvement, Tilly had the good
sense to pack her trunks and return to Ballarat. And it was one
crumb of comfort to Mary that, thanks to her indisposition, this
departure was accomplished without further unpleasantness.</p>

<p>Leaning over the bed for a farewell embrace, Tilly answered her
friend's hoarse whisper with a shake of the head. "But don't you
bother, love. My dear, you'll see what you do see! I'm no chicken,
Mary, nor any mealy-mouthed schoolgirl to lose me chance for want
of opening me mouth. But whatever happens, I'll never forget how
you tried to pull it off for me, old girl&mdash;never!...not so
long as I live."</p>

<p>And now, the nervous strain she had been under of lying
listening for sounds of strife and warfare&mdash;this removed, Mary
was left at peace in her dimity-white bed, and gave herself up to
the luxury of feeling thoroughly out of sorts. Richard found plenty
to say in admonition, as the days went by and she continued low and
languid, unable to shake off what seemed but a heavy cold. He also
laid down many a stringent rule to safeguard her, in future, from
the effects of her inexhaustible hospitality.</p>

<p>Then, however, the words died on his lips.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>When the truth dawned on them that Mary's illness could be
ascribed to a purely natural cause, and that, at long last, she was
to bear a child, husband and wife faced the fact as diversely as
they now faced all vital issues. In Mahony's feelings, bewilderment
and dismay had the upper hand. For though, at one time, Mary's
childlessness had been a real grief to him, so many years had
passed since then that he had long ceased either to hope or to
regret. And when you had bowed thus to the inevitable, and arranged
your life accordingly, it was disquieting, to say the least of it,
to see your careful structure turned upside down. Rudely
disquieting.</p>

<p>And this sense of inexpediency persisted long after Mary was up
and about again, her old blithe self, and the two of them had more
or less familiarised themselves with the idea of the drastic change
that lay in store for them. The truth was: he no longer wished for
children. One needed to be younger than he, still in the early
years of married life, to accept their coming unconcernedly. (Nor
was he enough of a self-lover to crave to see himself
re-duplicated, and thus assured of an earthly immortality.) He felt
old; <i>was</i> old: too late, now, to conjure up any of the dreams
that belonged by rights to the coming of a child. His chief
sensation was one of fear: he shrank from the responsibility that
was being thrust upon him. A new soul to guide, and shield, and
make fit for life!...when he himself was so unsure. How establish
the links that should bind it to the world around it?&mdash;as to
the world unseen. How explain evil?...and sin?...the doctrine of
reward and punishment?&mdash;and reconcile these with the idea of a
tender, all-powerful Creator. For though one might indulge in
theory and speculation for one's own edification, one dare not risk
them on a child. Another more selfish point of view was that he
looked forward with real apprehension to the upheaval of his little
world: the inroads on, the destruction of that peace and solitude
with which he had fallen so deeply in love.</p>

<p>A bright side to the affair was that they were now, for the
first time in their united lives, really able to afford the outlay
involved. They could make comfortable, even extravagant preparation
for the new arrival; and only too gladly did he bid Mary spend what
she chose. For though his own pleasure in the prospect of
fatherhood was severely tempered, it warmed his heart to see her
joy. "Radiant" was the only word that described Mary. No irksome
thoughts of responsibility bore her down. She would have laughed at
the notion in regard to a child of her own. But then, there never
was less of a doubter than Mary: no hypercritical brooding over
man's relation to God, or God's to the world, had ever robbed her
of an hour's sleep. She accepted things as they were with a kind of
simple, untroubled faith. Or was it perhaps just the
reverse&mdash;the absence of any religious spirit? Sometimes he
half believed it&mdash;believed there existed in Mary more than a
dash of the pagan. Well, however that might be, the coming of a
babe would set the crown on a life which, in spite of its
happiness, had so far lacked the supreme gift. For women's arms,
like their bodies, were built to cradle and enfold the young of the
race.</p>

<p>Mary wrinkled her brow over none but the most practical
considerations. Enough to occupy her was the burning question which
rooms to take for nurseries, in a house where all rooms had long
ago had their use allotted them.</p>

<p>Mahony laughed at her worried air. "Why, build 'em, my dear, and
as many as you choose! I'll not grudge the expense, I promise
you."</p>

<p>But this was just one of Richard's harebrained schemes. The
house was amply big enough as it stood; and any additions would
spoil its shape. Time enough, too, to think of extra accommodation
when all was happily over. Thus Mary: deciding eventually that the
guestrooms were those that must be sacrificed: they were large,
cool, airy; and once the baby was there, she would have scant
leisure for entertaining. At least, in the beginning. And with this
resolution, which was at once put into effect, Mary's overdone and
tiresome hospitality found its natural end.</p>

<p>Next came the question of furnishing. And here Richard proved to
have ultra-queer notions about what would be good for a
child&mdash;his child&mdash;and what wouldn't. The nurse was not
even to share a room with it&mdash;and this, when most nurses slept
with their charges in the same bed! Then he tabooed carpets as
dust-traps, so that there was no question of just covering the
floor with a good Brussels; and curtains must be of thinnest
muslin&mdash;not rep. In the end Mary had the floors laid in
polished wood, on which were spread loose strips of bamboo matting;
and dark green sunblinds were affixed to the outsides of the
windows. The walls were distempered a light blue. In place of the
usual heavy mahogany the furniture was of a simple style, and
painted white. The little crib&mdash;it had to be made to order,
for Richard would have none of the prevalent rocking-cradles,
which, he declared, had rocked many a babe into
convulsions&mdash;was white as well. When all was finished the
effect was quite fairylike, and so novel that tales of the
nurseries got abroad, and visitors invariably asked before leaving
if they might be allowed a peep at them. Meanwhile, Mahony did his
share by hunting up pictures on which the infant eye might rest
with pleasure. He also bought toys; and would arrive home with his
pocket bulging. Mary bore with him as long as he confined his
purchases to woolly balls and rag dolls. But when it came to his
ordering in an expensive rocking-horse, she put her foot down.</p>

<p>"<i>Really</i>, Richard! Just suppose anything...I mean it will
be more than time enough for things like these a year or two from
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, the doctor expects <i>his</i> kid to come into the world
able to walk and talk...like a foal or a calf. Never will such a
miracle have trod this old earth!"</p>

<p>And as Tilly&mdash;she had come down on her own initiative,
solely to be near Mary over her confinement&mdash;as she drove back
to the hotel at which she was putting up, she hummed the popular
refrain:</p>

<p>Oh, la, la!<br>
What fools men are!</p>

<p>For besides making a donkey of himself over his purchases,
Mahony was haunted, now the end drew nigh, by a memory, by the fear
of another disappointment. He hardly trusted Mary out of his sight;
hardly let her put one foot before another,&mdash;"As jumpy as a
Persian cat! You'd never think 'e'd 'elped hundreds of brats into
the world in 'is day!"</p>

<p>Mary sat in a rocking-chair on the shady side of the verandah,
and waved a palm-leaf fan to keep the flies off. More often she was
surrounded by yards of muslin, real India muslin, which she
fashioned into robes and petticoats, on which she frilled and
tucked and embroidered, sewing every stitch by hand.</p>

<p>"A regular trousseau!" said Tilly; and enviously fingered the
piles of gossamer garments.</p>

<p>On the ordeal that lay before her, Mary herself was not given to
brooding: for one thing, she was much stronger than she had been as
a girl. And the first discomforts of her state over, her health was
well maintained. But when December, with its livid heat, had
slipped into the greater heats of January and her time came, she
gave birth as hardly as on that first occasion long years ago; all
but paying with her own for the new life she was bringing into the
world. Well-known specialists, hastily summoned, performed a
critical operation, Mahony's trust in his own skill deserting him
as usual where Mary was in question. And though the operation was
successful and the child born alive, days of acute anxiety followed
before it was certain that Mary would pull through. Tilly and
Mahony buried the hatchet in the long hours they spent together in
that darkened bedchamber, where Mahony moved a pale, distraught
shadow, and Tilly sat weeping silently, her handkerchief to her
eyes. In the dining-room John and Jerry strayed aimlessly to and
fro among the furniture; and outsiders like Mrs. Devine would drive
up early, and remain sitting in their carriages to hear the latest
bulletin. In the end Mary's sound constitution triumphed, and she
was gradually won back to life; but over a week passed before she
even asked to see her child. Then, in sudden impatience, she tried
to raise herself on her elbow&mdash;a movement that sent Tilly and
the nurse flying to lay her flat again. Tilly it was who, going to
the crib, carried to her on a pillow one of the tiniest babies ever
seen: a waxen doll, with black hair an inch long, and the large
black eyes of Mary's own family.</p>

<p>It was a boy. At his baptism, where John, Jerry and Lizzie stood
sponsors, he received the name of Cuthbert&mdash;in full was to be
known as Cuthbert Hamilton Townshend-Mahony.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-1" id="ch-2-3-1"></a>Chapter I</h3>

<p>These unlooked-for children&mdash;the following year twin girls
were born, thus rounding off a trio&mdash;came too late to form the
bond between their parents they might once have done. For that, the
attitudes adopted towards them by father and mother, themselves now
branched so far apart, were too dissimilar. In Mahony's case, once
his children were there in the flesh before him, all his puny fears
of personal upset and mental pother fell away. He had only to feel
tiny soft fingers straying over his face, to become the tenderest
of fathers, loving his babies wholeheartedly. Now he feared only
for them, in their frailty and helplessness. Did he wake in the
night and think he heard a cry, he was out of bed in an instant;
and the nurse, entering from the next room to make sure of her
charges, would find her master there before her&mdash;a tall,
dressing-gowned figure, shading a candle with his hand. Often, too,
when wakeful, he would rise and steal into the night-nursery to
take a peep at his little ones, lying relaxed in sleep. Yes, he was
passionately solicitous for them&mdash;and not for their bodily
health alone. He would have wished to shield their little plastic
minds from all impressions that might pain or harm; have had them
look only at beautiful and pleasant things, hear soft voices and
kind words; on no child of his might hand be laid in anger. The
result was that the children, dimly conscious of his perpetual
uneasiness, were rendered uneasy by it in their turn, and, for all
the deep affection from which it sprang, never really warmed
towards their father.</p>

<p>Instead, they sunned themselves in their mother's love, which
knew nothing of fears or apprehensions. Mary laughed at Richard's
exaggerated anxiety; though she rejoiced to see him so fond. A
self-centred person like him might well have found children a
nuisance and in the way.</p>

<p>To her they were all in all; and on them she lavished that great
hoard of mother-love which, till now, she had spent on the world at
large. Had they been born shortly after her marriage, she, who was
then little more than a child herself, would have been a child
along with them; and the four would have grown up together in a
delightful intimacy. Of this there was now no question. Coming when
they did, the children stood to her only for possessions&mdash;her
most precious possessions&mdash;but still, something absolutely her
own, to do with just as she thought good. Through them, too, she
believed she would some day gratify those ambitions which, where
Richard was concerned, had proved so stark a failure. He had had no
desire to walk the high paths she had mapped out for him. Her
children would&mdash;and should. In the meantime, however, ambition
lay fallow in love; and it was to their mother the babies ran with
their pains and pleasures, their discoveries and attainments. She
alone gave them that sense of warmth and security in which very
young things thrive.</p>

<p>Their devotion to her was the one feature the three had in
common. The twins&mdash;they soon earned the nickname of "the
Dumplings"&mdash;were mere rolypoly bundles of good nature and
jollity, who rarely cried, and were as seldom ill as naughty. Mary
boasted: the most docile children in the world. Passionately
attached to each other said Mahony, it was as though a single soul
had been divided between two bodies&mdash;they toddled through
babyhood hand in hand; faithfully sharing all good things that came
their way; sleeping in the same crib, face to face, each with an
arm flung protectively about the other's neck. To look at they were
as like as two peas, blue-eyed, fair-haired, dimpled, lovely to
handle in their baby plumpness, and the most satisfying of armfuls.
Their development, too, kept equal pace they walked late, owing to
the burden of their little rotundities and long remained content
with inarticulate sounds for speech.</p>

<p>The boy was of quite another fibre: as hard to manage as they
were easy; as quick as they were slow. Tilly early said of him:
"Lor', Mary! the doctor 'imself in frocks and petticoats." But this
referred chiefly to little physical tricks and similarities: a
certain faddiness about his food, his clothes, his belongings. A
naughty child he was not&mdash;at first. He, too, began life as a
placid infant, who slept well, did not cry, and accepted
philosophically the bottle&mdash;substitute that was put to his
lips. This meant that, in spite of his midget-size at birth, he was
sound and healthy&mdash;in a fragile, wiry way. He continued small,
but was neatly formed. To his mother's colouring he added his
father's straight features; and even in babyhood had the latter's
trick of carrying his head well back, and a little to one side. He
walked before he was a year old, talked soon after; and, to his
parents' pride, was able to pick out a given letter from a
play-alphabet before he either walked or talked.</p>

<p>His precocity showed itself in other ways as well. For a year
and a quarter he was King of the House, the pivot of his little
world, sole occupant of his mother's knee. Then came the sudden
apparition of his sisters. In the beginning, Cuffy&mdash;thus he
named himself&mdash;did not pay much heed to this pair of animated
dolls, who moved their legs and arms when bathed, and rode out in a
carriage beside his, but for the most part lay asleep and
negligible. Only gradually did it dawn on him that his privileges
were being invaded; that not only, indeed, was his reign as sole
ruler at an end, but that the greater favours were falling to the
newcomers' share. And one day the full knowledge of what had
happened burst through, with disastrous results, Cuffy being then
something over two years old. Dressed for driving Mary entered the
nursery; and Cuffy clamoured to be set upon her knee.</p>

<p>"Not now, darling, I've no time. You must wait till Mamma comes
back."</p>

<p>But the nurses appearing at this moment with the babies, all
warm and fragrant from their afternoon nap, Mary was not able to
resist holding out her arms for them. She even lingered, fondling
them, after the carriage was announced.</p>

<p>Cuffy had docilely retreated to a corner, where he played with a
stuff elephant. But on seeing this&mdash;seeing his mother, who had
been too busy for him, petting the twins who had not even
<i>asked</i> to be nursed&mdash;at this he planted himself before
her and regarded her with his solemn black eyes. ("I do declare,
Master Cuffy seems to look right through you and out behind, when
he stares so," was a saying of Nannan's.)</p>

<p>Relinquishing her babies Mary stooped to him. "Say good-bye to
Mamma."</p>

<p>To her amazement, instead of putting up his face for a kiss,
Cuffy darted at her what she described to Richard as "a dreadfully
naughty look," and going over to his rocking-horse, which, though
he was not yet allowed to mount it, was his dearest treasure,
started to beat it with both hands, and with such force that the
patient effigy swung violently to and fro.</p>

<p>Shocked at this fit of temper, Nannan and Mary exclaimed in
chorus: "Master Cuffy! Well, I never did! Such tantrums!"</p>

<p>"Cuffy! What <i>are</i> you doing? If you are so naughty, Mamma
will never take you on her knee again."</p>

<p>The child's back being towards her, she did not see how at these
words the little face flushed crimson, the eyes grew round with
alarm. Cuffy at once left off hitting the horse; just stood
stock-still, as if letting what his mother had said sink in. But he
did not turn and come to her. Mary told Richard of the incident as
she buttoned her gloves. And Richard had Cuffy brought to him.
Laying aside his book he lifted the child to his knee.</p>

<p>"Papa is sorry to hear Cuffy has been naughty. Will Cuffy tell
Papa why?"</p>

<p>Unwinkingly the great eyes regarded him. But there was no
response.</p>

<p>"Fy, fy! To hit poor horsey...when it had done nothing to
deserve it."</p>

<p>"Cuffy's 'orsey&mdash;own norsey."</p>

<p>"But, just because it is Cuffy's&mdash;Cuffy's very own&mdash;he
must be kind...all the kinder...to it. Never wreak your temper or
your vengeance, my little son, on a person or thing that is in your
power. It's ungenerous. And I want my Cuffy to grow up into a good,
kind man. As careful of the feelings of others as he is of his
own."</p>

<p>Something in his father's voice&mdash;grave, measured,
tender&mdash;got at the baby, though the words went over his head.
And then Mahony saw what he long remembered: a fight for
self-control extraordinary in one so young. The black eyes filled;
the little mouth twitched and trembled. But the child swallowed
hard in an attempt to keep back his tears. And when at last they
broke through, he turned and hid his face against his father's
coat. Not, Mahony felt sure, seeking there either comfort or
sympathy. Merely that his distress might be unobserved. Taking in
his own the two little hands, which were locked in each other,
Mahony drew them apart. Both palms were red and sore-looking, and
no doubt still tingled hotly. The child had hurt himself most of
all.</p>

<p>But Cuffy's tears soon dried. After a very few seconds he raised
his face, and, this having been patted with his father's
handkerchief, slid to the floor and trotted back to the nursery.
And then, said Nannan, what a to-do there was! Master Cuffy dragged
his little chair up beside the horse, climbed on the chair and put
his arms round the animal's neck, talking to it for all the world
as if it was a live creature and could talk back.</p>

<p>"Wos 'oo 'urt, dea' 'orsey?&mdash;poor 'ickle 'orsey! Cuffy
didn't mean to. Wot 'oo say, 'orsey? 'Orsey 'oves Cuffy
double-much? Dea' 'orsey! Cuffy 'oves 'orsey, too&mdash;much more
better zan Effalunt."</p>

<p>And having deposited horsey's rival upside-down in a dark
cupboard, he begged a lump of sugar from Eliza the under-nurse, and
rammed it in between the steed's blood-red jaws; where it remained,
until a trail of white ants was discovered making a straight line
for it from the window.</p>

<p>To Mary, Mahony said: "If I were you, my dear, I should be
careful to distribute my favours equally. Don't let the little
fellow feel that his nose has been put out of joint. He's
jealous&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"Jealous? Of his own sisters? Oh, Richard!...I don't think that
augurs very well for him.&mdash;And surely he can't learn too soon
that it's for him to give way to them&mdash;as little girls?"</p>

<p>For almost the first time in his knowledge of her, Mahony seemed
to sense a streak of hardness in Mary; for the first time she did
not excuse a wrongdoer with a loving word. And this her own
child!</p>

<p>"He's but a baby himself. Don't ask too much of him," he soothed
her. And added: "Of course, I only give you my idea. Do as you
think best." &mdash;For Mary had proved as capable as a mother as
at everything else: she solved problems by sheer intuition, where
he would have fretted and fumbled. Even the children's early
religious training had, when the time came, fallen to her. Here
again she had no bothersome theories: just the simplest practice.
The question whether Cuffy and his sisters should be taught to pray
or not to pray, to invoke a personal or an impersonal Deity, never
entered her head. As soon as they could lisp their first syllables,
they knelt night and morning at her knee to repeat their "Gentle
Jesus!" and "Jesus, tender Shepherd!" And as long as the great
First Cause was set forth in this loving and protective guise,
Mahony saw no reason to interfere. He contented himself with
forbidding the name of God ever to be used as a threat, or in
connection with punishment: the children were taught that the worst
that could befall a sinner was a temporary withdrawal of God's
love. Nor would he have the THOU GOD SEEST ME! fallacy&mdash;this
reduction of the Omnipotent and Eternal to the level of spyer and
peeper&mdash;instilled into their young minds; while such a purely
human invention as the Devil&mdash;"That scapegoat on which man
piles the blame for the lapses in his own nature!"&mdash;was never
to be so much as mentioned in the nursery.</p>

<p>These few simple rules laid down, he retired into the
background. The comfortable knowledge that his children were in the
best of hands left his mind free.</p>

<p>Until now it had been plain sailing. Now...well, Mary invariably
dated the beginning of the real trouble with Cuffy from the day on
which he flew into such a naughty passion with his horse. Exactly
an easy child to manage he had never been; he was too fanciful for
that. There was no need for Richard to fuss and fidget about
keeping ugly things from him. Cuffy himself would have none of
them. Before he was a twelve-month old, did he, in looking at his
"Queen of Hearts" story-book, draw near the picture of the thieving
knave, you saw his eyes getting bigger and bigger. And if he could
not contrive, with his baby hands, to turn two pages at
once&mdash;and nobody else might do it for him &mdash;he would
avert his eyes altogether, or lay his palm flat over the wretch's
ugly face. The Dore illustrations to his big fairy-book had a kind
of horrid fascination for him. There he would sit staring at these
dense and gloomy forests, these ruined, web-hung castles surrounded
by their stagnant moats&mdash;and then, when bedtime came, he
turned frightened. It was of no use trying to shame him with: "A
great boy like you! Why, the Dumplings aren't a bit afraid." Or
cheerily assuring him: "There are no such things, darling, as
witches and giants. They're only made up to amuse little
children."</p>

<p>Cuffy knew better&mdash;when the lamp was out and Nannan had
left the nursery. Then the picture he feared most: Hop-o'-my-Thumb,
a creature in petticoats, no bigger than himself, leading a long
string of brothers and sisters into a forest black as ink: this
picture <i>would</i> rise up before him. Not only so, but he
himself must join the tail, fall in after Hop-o' and follow into
that dreadful wood, where the ogre lived. Since he could not resist
its attraction, the book had to be locked away.</p>

<p>The eldest, and a boy, to be such a baby! Mary felt quite
abashed for Cuffy, and lost no chance of poking fun at his fears.
But it did not help; and eventually she saw that she must leave it
to time to drive this nonsense out of him. There were other, more
actively disturbing traits in his nature, on which time might have
the opposite effect. For example, for such a little child he was
far too close and reserved; he kept his thoughts and feelings
buttoned up inside himself. He had a passionate
temper&mdash;"Cuffy's temper" it was called, as though of a special
brand that belonged to him alone&mdash;but he did not often give it
play. Was he hurt or offended or angry, he would retire to a
corner, and stay there by himself. If he had to cry, he cried in a
corner; he did not want to be petted or comforted; and he would
also in nine cases out of ten not say&mdash;Richard declared would
perhaps not be able to say &mdash;why he cried. Mary saw him
growing up very unfrank and secretive; which, to her, spelt
deceitful.</p>

<p>Again, it wormed in her that he was not a friendly or a trusting
child &mdash;one of those who indiscriminately hold out their arms,
or present a cheek. Cuffy would not go to strangers or always give
his kiss when bidden. Nor was he generous; he did not willingly
share his toys, or his picture-books, or his lollipops. The things
that belonged to him belonged absolutely. Really, he seemed to look
upon them as bits of himself, and hence not to be parted with. His
favourite animals&mdash;horse and elephant&mdash;might be touched
by no one. Was there a children's party in the nursery special
playthings had to be provided, or only those used that were the
Dumplings' property. To Mary, bound by but gossamer threads to all
things material, her little son's attitude was something of a
mystery; and many a time did she strive with him over the head of
it. His inability to share with others stood to her for sheer
selfishness. She trembled, too, lest the Dumplings should learn to
copy him in this, and cease to be the open-hearted, open-handed
little mortals they were. For they looked up to Cuffy with adoring
eyes&mdash;Cuffy who walked while they still drove; was present at
dessert in the evening, while they were put to bed; wore
knickerbockers instead of skirts. But, try as she might, by
teaching and example, she could not influence the boy, let alone
master him; while the usual nursery proceeding of making a child's
naughty fit end with an expression of contrition shattered on
Cuffy's obstinacy. If he did not feel sorry, he would not say he
was; and in the battle royal that ensued he generally came off
victor. The fact was, in the dark-eyed mite she had now to deal
with, Mary ran up against more than a dash of her own resolute
spirit; and naturally enough failed to recognise it.</p>

<p>"He's got a shocking will of his own. And what troubles me,
Richard, is, if he's as set as all this when he's not much more
than a baby, whatever will he be when he grows up?"</p>

<p>"Set? Nonsense, my dear! The child's got character. Give it
scope to expand. Try to influence him and work on his good feelings
instead of bullying him."</p>

<p>"It's all very well for you. You don't have to deal with him a
dozen times a day. I must say, I sometimes think you might help a
little more than you do." It was a sore point with Mary that
Richard would not rise to his responsibilities as a father, but
went on leading the life of a bookworm and a recluse. "Especially
as the child takes more notice of you than of any one else."</p>

<p>But Mahony was not to be bought. "My dear, you've the knack and
I haven't. Now don't worry. As long as he's honest and truthful,
he'll be all right."</p>

<p>Honest?...truthful? That went without saying! It was only that
Mary wanted her first-born to be so much more: sunny, lovable,
transparent, brave&mdash;and a hundred other things besides. He was
Nurse's darling though. You had only, said Nannan, to beware of
knocking up against any of his funny little fads, such as
undressing him before people, or asking him to eat with any but his
own silver fork and spoon.</p>

<p>"What Master Cuffy needs is just a bit of managing. I can twist
him round my little finger." But it did not tally with Mary's ideas
that a child of that age should have to be "managed" at all.</p>

<p>Turning from these traits in her son of which she could not
approve, she dwelt with pleasure on his marked quickness and
cleverness. Cuffy had sure fingers and a retentive memory. At an
early age he could catch a ball and trundle a hoop; could say his
prayers without prompting; learn nursery rhymes at a single
hearing; could eat nicely, keep himself clean, button up those of
his buttons which were within reach: in short do everything in this
line that could be expected of so young a mortal.</p>

<p>And in addition he had one genuine talent. For some reason or
other&mdash;"a throwback to his grandmother," supposed
Mahony&mdash;Cuffy had been dowered with a natural gift for music.
He learnt tunes more easily than he learnt his letters; could hum
"Rock of Ages" and "Sun of my Soul" before he uttered a word. His
ear was extraordinarily good, his little voice sweet and true. And
knowing that Mary's intonation was but faulty, that of the nursery
faultier still, Mahony here put in his single spoke in Cuffy's
education. He had the boy brought to his dressing-room of a
morning; and there, while he dressed, Cuffy with his elephant would
sit perched on a corner of the table, singing songs old and new.
Together Mahony and his son practised "Oft in the Stilly Night" and
"The Land o' the Leal," and with such success that, was there
company to dinner, Cuffy in his best velvet tunic would be stood on
a chair at dessert, to perform to the guests. And as he gave forth,
in baby language, such ditties as:</p>

<p>A temple to friendship,<br>
Cried Laura, enchanted,<br>
I'll build in my garden<br>
The thought is divine!</p>

<p>The ladies uttered rapturous exclamations; while the gentlemen,
mostly without a note of music in them, declared: "'pon my word,
very remarkable, very remarkable indeed!" and Aunt Lizzie, from
whom cuffy had picked up this song by ear, hailed him as an infant
prodigy, and painted for him a future that made Mary's heart swell
with pride.</p>

<p>Such were Mahony's children.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-2" id="ch-2-3-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>Mrs. Marriner, the youngish widow whose acquaintance Mary had
made while visiting on the Urquharts' station, was a person of
character. In the matter of dress, for example, she defied the
prevailing fashion; wore her light brown hair swept straight back
from her brow (which was classic), and, employing neither net nor
comb, twisted it in a Grecian knot on the nape of her neck. She
also eschewed crinoline, and wandered a tall, willowy form, the
eyed of all beholders.</p>

<p>"Out and away too conspicuous!" was Mahony's verdict. "The woman
must <i>want</i> people to stare at her. Though I will say, Mary,
it's something of a treat to behold the natural female figure
again, after the unnatural bulgings we've put up with. And a very
fine figure, too!"</p>

<p>For this he had to admit: there was nothing unfeminine or
forbidding about the lady. She was as handsome as she was striking.
A full eye, a Grecian nose, a slim waist: such were her charms; to
say nothing of a white, dimpled hand, and a well-turned ankle. And
yet every one who knew her agreed that she captivated less by
reason of her comeliness, than by the ease and elegance of her
manner.</p>

<p>She was just as popular with her own as with the sterner sex.
Which said a good deal; for, wherever she went, she was run after
by "the gentlemen." And small wonder, thought Mary. For Gracey was
up in any subject, however dry; had brains really equal to
"gentlemen's conversation."</p>

<p>Richard said: "It's not the least piquant thing about her that
after she has been holding forth, supremely well, on one of those
learned themes ladies as a rule fight shy of, she will suddenly
lapse into some delightful feminine inconsequence. That, my dear,
gives us men back, for a finish, the sense of superiority we need."
But here you just had one of the satirical remarks Richard was so
apt at making&mdash;especially in the early stages of an
acquaintance. Afterwards he generally had to eat his words, or at
least water them down.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marriner rented a villa within easy driving distance of
"Ultima Thule." This was in the early days of the nursery, while
the twins were still babies in arms, and Mary went out but little.
It fell to the newcomer to pick up the threads; and she did so with
a will, calling frequently and entering wholeheartedly into Mary's
interests. She was devoted to children; and sometimes, as they sat
on the verandah, Nannan would bring Cuffy out to them. And then it
was a pretty sight to see the tall, handsome woman on her knees
before the little child, rolling his woolly ball to him, or playing
at peek-a-bo.</p>

<p>The merry voices lured even Mahony forth from his den. And
having tossed his son in the air, he lingered for a word with his
wife's guest. This happened more than once; after which, as Mary
had foreseen, his sarcasms died away. Mrs. Marriner had travelled
widely, and owned a large collection of photographs of famous
beauty-spots; and the first time Mahony went to her house was when
he and Mary drove over one evening to view these through a
stereoscope. Dotted about the rooms they found many another
interesting memento of her travels. On the chimney-piece were
candelabra of Dresden china. Coloured prints of Venice by night and
the blue grotto of Capri adorned the walls. A statuette of Christ
by a Danish sculptor stood on the lid of the piano. She had a very
fair assortment of books&mdash;serious works, too: essays, poetry,
history&mdash;both old and of the newest; and Mahony carried away
with him a couple of volumes by a modern writer of verse named
Browning.</p>

<p>In addition she was musical. Not in sister Lizzie's superb,
almost professional fashion; but singing in a clear, correct voice,
and playing the pianoforte with neatness and skill. Her performance
of Mendelssohn's <i>Songs Without Words</i> was most enjoyable. And
now it was Mahony's turn to suggest inviting her; after which he
went back to sing duets, and listen to her execution of a sonata by
Haydn. He relished, too, a conversation that for once rose above
the affairs of the nursery.</p>

<p>For, the piano closed, the lady and he dropped into talk. And
having skimmed the surface of various subjects on which they found
themselves in marvellous accord, they came round to the one which
still engrossed Mahony's attention. Of spiritualism Mrs. Marriner
was ignorant; she begged the doctor to enlighten her. And the rough
sketch he gave her interested her so much that she expressed a
strong wish to know more. He promised to bring her an armful of
literature; and then, if her interest still held, to procure her
the entree to a sitting at the house of that arch-spiritualist,
Mrs. Phayre, where remarkable phenomena took place. Weird noises
might be heard there at dead of night: furniture was moved by
unseen hands from its place against the wall.</p>

<p>The next day he carried over the books; and Mrs. Marriner read
them with what seemed to him a rare and unfeminine insight: that is
to say, she was neither alarmed, nor derisive, nor stupidly
obstinate: and, so far, except for members of the inner circle, he
had known no woman whose state of mind towards the question was not
one of these three. She also jumped at his offer of introducing her
at a seance. Later on, learning that he was eager to find an
unprofessional medium with whom he might experiment in private, and
on whom no shadow of suspicion could be held to rest, she herself
proposed sitting at a small table in her drawing-room. And after a
few fruitless hours, during which he had every reason to admire her
patience, they met with success: the table tilted under their hands
and a pencil, delicately sustained by the lady's fingers, wrote
words that could be read. It was plain she was possessed of the
power.</p>

<p>He went home to Mary in high feather.</p>

<p>"Now, perhaps, you'll believe there's something in it!"</p>

<p>"I never said there wasn't <i>something</i>. It's only
that..."</p>

<p>"You can hardly suspect your friend of being an impostor?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious no! The idea!"</p>

<p>And Mary meant it. Gracey was no more capable of downright fraud
than she herself. And yet...yet...say what you liked, there was a
part of you that simply would not accept the conclusions you were
asked to draw. To think, because a table stood on two legs, or a
pencil wrote: "I am here," that dead people&mdash;people who lay
mouldering in their graves!&mdash;were speaking to you...no, that
she would never be able to believe, not if she lived to be
Methusalah. Why, you might just be leaning a little too heavily on
your side of the table without knowing it. Or your hand write
things down in a kind of dream, and you imagine somebody or
something else was doing it. And still be the most truthful person
alive. Like Richard. Who again and again let himself be imposed
on.&mdash;The truth was: if people wanted to believe such things,
believe they would: the wish was father to the thought. Well, at
least this new hobby of Richard's had one advantage: it gave him
something to do. Which was just what he needed. Instead of always
sitting humped up over his books.</p>

<p>Under the stimulus he began to look more like his old self. He
spruced up his dress; and the daily ride to Gracey's gave him
beneficial exercise. As time went on, their sittings proved so
satisfactory that he began to think of publishing a small pamphlet,
embodying the results. And though Mary would rather it had been on
a less outlandish subject, she hailed the idea and encouraged it.
For looking after Richard became, year by year, more like minding a
fidgety child, who had always to be kept on the go. He had been
such a worker in his day. And the old fear could still wake in her
at times that, being without active employment, he might all of a
sudden turn restless and declare himself tired of their lovely
home.</p>

<p>But then came that afternoon when Lizzie let drop an item of
news which successfully routed Mary's peace of mind.</p>

<p>They did not see much of Lizzie nowadays; she and John were
always in society; out night after night at concerts, dinners,
balls. Or else entertaining lavishly in their own home. It was an
open secret that the longed-for knighthood would very soon set the
crown on John's labours for the colony.</p>

<p>Stateliness in person, gauzes and laces floating from arms and
shoulders, trinkets and chains a-jingle, Lizzie swept through the
hall, a majestic figure indeed. No wonder John was still unable to
refuse her anything.</p>

<p>Then, just about to step into her carriage, she paused. "Mary,
dehling...I vow I all but forgot it! I have something to tell you,
love, that I think will interest you. Mary! I met a gentleman on
Friday who was once acquainted with our friend&mdash;the charmin'
Gracey. And <i>what</i> do you think? My dear, she is not a widow
at all."</p>

<p>Mary was thunderstruck. "Not a widow? Lizzie! Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dehling, her husband is still alive. He left her,
love&mdash;deserted her for another woman...the lowest of the low!
At this very moment he lives with the creature...in his lawful
wife's stead."</p>

<p>As always, Mary's first impulse was to protect...defend. "Oh,
poor Gracey!...how terrible for her!"</p>

<p>"Well, love...I thought you ought to know. Since dear Richard is
so friendly there. And considering the ultra-strict views he
holds."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. But, Lizzie, it's not her fault, is it?
<i>She</i> can't help the man she married turning out a
scoundrel."</p>

<p>But though she spoke up thus, Mary was greatly perturbed and her
mind became a sea of doubts where no doubts had been. She found
herself looking at Gracey with other eyes. The fact was, a divorced
or legally separated woman&mdash;even one who was just living apart
from her husband&mdash;was by no means the same as a widow...and
never could be. Gracey knew that well enough; else why, to a close
friend like herself, had she made a mystery of her state? And
though not a shadow of blame should rest on her (and Mary was sure
it didn't), it meant, none the less, that she had been through all
sorts of unpleasant matrimonial experiences, which a properly
married or widowed woman would know nothing about. Something of
them might have remained clinging to her...the old saw about
touching pitch would run in Mary's head. It was dreadful. Such a
dear, nice woman as Gracey. And yet...deep down in Mary's heart
there dwelt the obstinate conviction that once married was always
married, and that as long as your husband lived you belonged at his
side. Did you sit firm and hold fast to your rights as a wife, it
seemed incredible that another woman could ever usurp your place.
Had Gracey perhaps gone off in a tantrum, leaving the coast clear?
Yes, doubts would up, and the result was, she found herself
considering, with a more critical eye, the friendship that had
sprung up between Richard and Grace over their table-tilting. Never
before had she known Richard so absorbed by any one outside his
home. Now suppose, just suppose Gracey, thanks to her wretched
married life, had come to regard things&mdash;serious things,
sacred things&mdash;more lightly than she ought? What if, because
of her own unhappy past, she should not hold the marriage-tie to be
binding? Why was she so attractive to gentlemen? Did they know or
suspect anything? In reply to which there flashed through Mary's
mind a memory of her last visit to Yarangobilly: Willy Urquhart's
infatuation and the state poor Louisa had worked herself into. Of
course there was really no comparison between the two
cases&mdash;none whatever! Willy was a notorious flirt: Richard a
gentleman. And poor Louisa's morbid, distorted outlook would never
be hers.</p>

<p>Richard...The question that teased Mary was, should she tell him
what she had heard, or keep it to herself? In one way she agreed
with Lizzie that he ought to know, he being so fastidious in his
views. Besides, if he heard it from some other source, he might
feel aggrieved that she had held back. On the other hand, his
knowing would probably curtail, if not put a stop altogether to his
and Gracey's experiments: he wouldn't want to give people food for
talk. And that would be a pity. Would it be disloyal to say
nothing? Disloyal to Gracey to tell what she so plainly wished to
keep dark? But Richard came first.&mdash;And here again, unlike
poor Louisa, Mary felt she could weigh the matter very calmly; for
in her was a feeling nothing could shake: the happily married
woman's sense of possession. It was not only the fact of Richard
being what he was. Their life together rested on the surest of
foundations: the experiences of many, how many years; the trials
and tribulations they had been through together; the joys they had
shared; the laughs they had had over things and people; a complete
knowledge of each other's prejudices and antipathies&mdash;who else
could unlock, with half a word, the rich storehouse of memories
they had in common? Homelier things, too, there were in plenty,
which bound no less closely: the airing and changing of your
underlinen; how sweet or how strong you drank your coffee; how you
liked your bed made; your hatred of the touch of steel on fruit; of
a darn in a sock.&mdash;Deeper down though, pushed well below the
topmost layer of her consciousness, just one unspoken fear
<i>did</i> lurk. If she told Richard what she had heard, and he did
not take it in the spirit he had hitherto invariably shown towards
irregularities of this kind, Mary knew she would feel both hurt and
humiliated. Not for herself&mdash;but for him.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The sitting at an end, the table was put back in its place
against the wall.</p>

<p>"You will smoke, doctor? Nay, please do...I like it. Here are
matches.&mdash;Down, Rover! Not yet, Fitz!" For at her movement a
red setter had sprung up from a corner, and now stood, his front
paws on her knee, ingratiatingly wagging his tail; while observing
his comrade's advance an immense black cat, which had been dozing
in an arm-chair, rose and dropped a kind of bob-curtsey with its
hind quarters. "Behold my two tyrants! They think it time for a
run.&mdash;Oh, yes, Mr. Fitz comes too."</p>

<p>"You are very fond of animals?"</p>

<p>"I should be lost without them. They are such dear companions,
in their dumb way." As she spoke Mrs. Marriner fondled a silky ear,
letting it slip through a pretty, dimpled hand.</p>

<p>"Well do I know it. In my bachelor days, living in a bark-hut
the whole of which would have gone into this room, I kept no less
than three." And casting the net of his memory Mahony told of his
long-forgotten pets, and of their several untimely
ends.&mdash;"After that I took no more."</p>

<p>"You had not the heart?" Now could any but a genuine
animal-lover have put this question?</p>

<p>"Not exactly. But as a hard-worked medico, with a growing
practice...the burden of them, you see, would have fallen on my
wife. And she does not much care for animals."</p>

<p>"Dear Mary. And now, of course, she has her babies."</p>

<p>"Yes, and all a mother's fears for them, with regard to the
four-footed race."</p>

<p>"That is but natural. While they are so tiny." In the kindly
indulgence of her tone, the speaker seemed to take all mothers and
their weaknesses under her wing. "And yet, doctor, if I had been
blessed with little ones, I think I should have brought up babies,
puppies and kittens <i>en masse</i>...as one family party. Correct
me though, if I speak foolishly. Perhaps, when children come, they
are all in all."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> amazing how the little beggars twine themselves
round one's heart. Before my boy was born, my chief feeling was a
sense of the coming responsibility. I can laugh at myself now. For
my wife has shouldered everything of that sort...I leave the
children entirely to her."</p>

<p>"I think dear Mary quite the most capable person I know."</p>

<p>What a handsome creature she was, to be sure, full-bosomed yet
slender, her neat waist held by a silver girdle, her face alight
with sympathy and understanding! Mahony answered heartily: "There
have, indeed, been few situations in life Mary has not proved equal
to."</p>

<p>The words set a string of memories vibrating; and a silence
fell. Unlike many of her sex, who would have babbled on, the lady
just smiled and waited; and even her waiting was perfect in
tact.</p>

<p>Mahony felt drawn to unbosom himself. "Talking of my
children...it is sometimes a sorry thought to me that my
acquaintance with them can only be a brief one. I mean, the
probability is I shall see them but to the threshold of their adult
life&mdash;no further. And would like so well to know what they
make of it."</p>

<p>His meaning was grasped...and with ease. "I understand
that...especially in the case of such a gifted child as your sweet
little Cuffy."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do think the boy is quick beyond the common run."</p>

<p>"Without doubt he is. Look at his musical ability."</p>

<p>"Ah, there you mention the one bit of his education I take a
hand in. For Mary has no ear for music. Nor even any particular
liking for it."</p>

<p>"And it is so important, is it not, that the ear should be well
trained from the first? The spadework done before the child is even
aware of it." (Here spoke your true musician.) "But, doctor, if our
findings are correct, you may still have the joy of watching over
your little brood from the other side...<i>n'est-ce-pas?</i>"</p>

<p>"Ah!...if that might be. If one could be sure of that." And on
the instant Mahony mounted his hobby-horse and was carried away.
"With this, my dear lady, you put your finger on what seems to me
one of the vital points of the whole question. Have you ever
reflected what a difference it would make, did we mortals
<i>seriously</i> believe in a life to come?...I don't mean the
Jewish-Byzantine state of petrified adoration that the churches
offer us...I mean a life such as we know it: a continuation of the
best of this earthly existence&mdash;mental striving, spiritual
aspiration, love for our neighbour. If we did so believe, our every
perspective would alter. And the result be a marked increase in
spirituality. For the orthodox Christian's point of view is too
often grossly materialistic&mdash;and superstitious. The tenacity
with which he clings to a resurrection of the flesh&mdash;this poor
cankered flesh!...after countless years deep in its
grave&mdash;that grave on which he dwells with so morbid a
pleasure. Or his childish fear of death&mdash;despite the glories
that are promised him on the other side...do these not remind you
of the sugar-candy with which an infant is bribed to take its pill?
Against all this, set the belief that in dying we pass but from one
room to another of the house of life&mdash;Christ's 'many
mansions.' The belief that an invisible world exists around
us&mdash;the spirit counterpart of this we know. That those we have
lost still live and love and await us...on the other side of a veil
which already a few, of rarer perceptions than the rest, have
pierced.&mdash;But forgive me! When once I get going on this
subject I know no measure. And I confess...so few opportunities to
talk of it arise. My wife has scant sympathy with the movement;
sees, I fear, only its shady side."</p>

<p>"Dearest Mary. She is so practically minded."</p>

<p>"Yes. She is often genuinely uneasy at the hours I spend over my
books; would rather have me up and doing&mdash;and though but
riding for pleasure along the seashore. Books to her are only a
means of killing time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Marriner turned the full weight of a grave, sweet smile
upon him. "While we book-lovers...well! as far as I am concerned,
doctor, my life would be a blank indeed, without the company of the
printed page."</p>

<p>"And what of me?...whose dearest dream it was, while I slaved
for a living, to be able to end my days in a library. I declare to
you, it is still a disturbing thought that I shall die leaving so
many books unread."</p>

<p>"Let me comfort you. My dear father, who lived to a ripe old
age, was given to complaining towards the end that he had 'read all
the books'&mdash;or at least all that were worth reading."</p>

<p>"Of course; as one grows older; and harder to please...Myself
though, I seem still far from that. The lists I send my bookseller
grow longer, not shorter. And it's not the unread books only. While
we're on these ghost-thoughts&mdash;we all have them, I
suppose&mdash;let me confess to another, and that is that I shall
probably need to go, having seen all too few of the grandeurs and
beauties of this world. Pass on to the next without knowing what
the Alps or the Andes are like, or the torrents of the Rhine."</p>

<p>"But doctor...what hinders you? I don't mean the
Andes,"&mdash;and Mahony was the recipient of a roguish smile. "But
travel is so easy nowadays. One packs one's trunks, books one's
berth&mdash;<i>et voila</i>! What hinders you?"</p>

<p>Ah! what...what, indeed? Mahony hesitated for a moment before
replying. "The truth is, the years we spent in England were
thoroughly uncongenial...to us both. We were glad, on getting back
to the colony, to settle down. And having once settled..."</p>

<p>Yes, that was it: of his own free will he had saddled himself
with a big, expensive house, and all that belonged to its upkeep:
men-servants and maid-servants, horses and carriages. Mary had
taken root immediately; and now the children...their tender
age...But darker than all else loomed Mary's attitude...or what
might he expect this to be, if&mdash;"The truth is, my wife does
not...I mean she has gone through so many upheavals already, on my
account, that I should hardly feel justified...again...so
soon...Still there's no denying it: I do sometimes feel like an old
hulk which lies stranded. But there! All my days I've been gnawed
by the worm of change&mdash;change of any sort. As a struggling
medico I longed for leisure and books. Pinned to the colony, I
would be satisfied with nothing but the old country. Now that I
have ample time, and more books than I can read, I could wish to be
up and out seeing the world. And my dear wife naturally finds it
difficult to keep pace with such a weathercock."</p>

<p>"I think it is with you as the German poet sings: 'There, where
thou art not, there alone is bliss!'"</p>

<p>"Indeed and that hits my nail squarely on the head. For I can
assure you it's no mere spirit of discontent&mdash;as some suppose.
It's more a kind of...well, it's like reaching out after&mdash;say,
a dream one has had and half forgotten, and struggles to recapture.
That's baldly put. But perhaps you will understand."</p>

<p>A lengthy silence followed. The clock ticked; the dog sighed
gustily. Then, feeling the moment come, the lady rose and swept her
skirts to the piano. "Let me play to you," said she.</p>

<p>Mahony gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>Once the music had begun, however, he fell back on his own
reflections; they were quickened rather than hampered by the
delicate tinkling of the piano. He felt strangely elated: not a
doubt of it, a good talk was one of the best of medicines,
particularly for such a dry, bottled-up old fogy as he was on the
verge of becoming. Of course, did you open your heart you must
have, for listener, one who was in perfect tune with you; who could
pick up your ideas as you dropped them; take your meaning at a
word. And mortals of this type were all too rare; in respect of
them, his life had been a sandy waste. Which had told heavily
against him. Looking down the years he saw that, all through, his
most crying need had been for spiritual companionship; for the balm
of tastes akin to his own. It was a crippling reflection that never
yet had he found the person to whom he could have blurted out his
thoughts without fear of being misunderstood...or disapproved...or
smiled at for an oddity. Here, having unexpectedly tapped a woman's
quick perception, a woman's lively sympathy, he had a swift vision
of what might have been&mdash;that misty picture that inhabits the
background of most minds. To know his idiosyncrasies fondly
accepted&mdash;his mental gropings accompanied, his roving spirit
gauged and condoned...not as any fault of his own, but as an innate
factor in his blood! Ah! but for that to come to pass, one would
need to leave choosing one's fellow-traveller on the long
life-journey until one's own mind and character had formed and
ripened. How could one tell, in the twenties, what one would be on
nearing the fifties?&mdash;in which direction one would have
branched out, and set, and stiffened? At twenty all was glamour and
romance; and it seemed then to matter little whether or no a heart
was open to the sufferings of the brute creation; whether the
written word outweighed the spoken; in how far the spiritual
mysteries made appeal&mdash;questions which gradually, with time,
came to seem more vital than all else. In youth one's nature cried
aloud for companionship...one's blood ran hot...the mysteries
played no part. And then the years passed and passed, and one
drifted...drifted...slowly, but very surely...until...well, in many
a case, he supposed the fact that you <i>had</i> drifted never came
to your consciousness at all. But should anything happen to pull
you up with a jerk, force you to cast the plummet; should you get
an inkling of something rarer and finer: then, the early flames
being sunk to a level glow, you stood confounded by your
aloofness...by the distance you had travelled...the isolation of
your state. But had he, in sooth, ever felt other than lonely, and
alone? Mary was&mdash;had always been&mdash;dearest and best of
wives...yet...yet...had they, between them, a single idea in
common?...Did they share an interest, a liking, a point of
view?&mdash;with the one exception of an innate sobriety and
honesty of purpose. No, for more years than he cared to count, Mary
had done little, as far as he was concerned, but sit in judgment:
she silently censured, mentally condemned all those things in life
which he held most worth while: his needs, his studies, his
inclinations&mdash;down to his very dreams and hopes of a
hereafter.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Lizzie said: "My dear, our lady friend is in hoops now, if you
please! Nothing extreme, of course, considering from whom she takes
her present cue. <i>Just</i> the desired
<i>soupcon!</i>&mdash;Mary, she went about as a Slim Jane only
because the <i>cavalier</i> of the moment approved the simplicity
of the human form divine. To-day she is a rapping and tapping
medium&mdash;as we very well know. To-morrow, love, the wind will
shift to another quarter, and we shall hear of the fair lady
running to matins and communicating on an empty stomach. Or
visiting in a prison cell got up as a nursing sister, <i>A la</i>
Elizabeth Fry."</p>

<p>Hoops...nothing extreme...considering from whom she takes her
present cue. At these words, and even while she was standing up for
Gracey's sincerity, there leapt to Mary's mind, with a stab of real
pain, Richard's nervous hatred of the exaggerated&mdash;the
bizarre. And whether it was hoops, or hooplessness.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-3" id="ch-2-3-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>These rather waspish comments&mdash;Lizzie never seemed able to
resist having a thrust at Gracey&mdash;were made in the
drawing-room at "Ultima Thule," where the two wives sat waiting for
their husbands to rejoin them. John and Lizzie were dining there at
John's express request: the groom had ridden over after lunch with
a line from John, asking if he and Lizzie might take pot-luck with
them that evening. Richard said: "Wonders will never cease," and a
refusal was not to be thought of; but Cook had been very put out by
the shortness of the notice; so much so that Mary had driven to
town to fetch delicacies; thinking as she went, how in the old days
<i>she</i> would have run up a dinner for four, and one well worth
eating, too, in less than an hour. Her hands did sometimes itch to
show such a fair-weather worker as Cook what could be done.</p>

<p>By now the evening was more than half gone, and still the
gentlemen lingered; though Lizzie had sung all Richard's favourite
songs and pieces, some of them more than once. To pass the time,
she had also sung to Cuffy; for&mdash;as had happened ere this when
she was dining there &mdash;Nannan had knocked to say Master Cuffy
could not be got to sleep, for thinking his Auntie might sing to
him. Cuffy as audience was better than none, so Lizzie begged for
the child to be brought in; and thereupon Cuffy appeared on
Nannan's arm in his little red flannel nightgown, his feet swathed
in a crib&mdash;blanket, his eyes alight with expectation. Seated
on his mother's knee he drank in: "There was a Friar of Orders
Grey," and the sad ditty of "Barbara Allan," himself rendering "Sun
of my Soul" before, soundly kissed and cosseted by his aunt, who
had a great liking for the little man, he was carried back to
bed.</p>

<p>Towards ten o'clock, Lizzie could no longer conceal her yawns.
Mary and she had talked themselves out: and where she had first
surreptitiously peeped, she now openly drew her watch from her
belt. This, John's latest present to her, was a magnificent affair,
crusted back and front with diamonds, while tiny brilliants
sprinkled the long gold chain on which it hung. Unlike most women,
Lizzie could wear any quantity of jewellery without looking
overloaded. At the present moment a little heap of rings and
bracelets lay on the lid of the piano; for, in despair, she had
re-seated herself at the keys and begun anew to sing.</p>

<p>At the best of times Mary found it hard to fix her mind on music
for five minutes together; and on this evening she had had more
than enough of it, and could now let her thoughts stray in comfort.
She wondered what could be keeping the two men...it was certainly
rather impolite of Richard...wondered if Nannan had at last got
Cuffy to sleep. The dinner had been very nice; Cook needn't have
made so much fuss beforehand. But there! When they undertook
anything of this kind, it usually went off well. The house, of
course, had something to do with it. This room, for instance, how
well it lighted up! Richard declared he much preferred it to
John's, and Mary's eyes wandered lovingly round walls and
furniture, lingering on the great gilt-edged mirror, which reached
to the ceiling; the lovely girandoles, a present from Richard; the
lustred chandelier; the glass-shaded ormolu clock. The carpet, too,
was of a most uncommon lemon colour; the suite, in a brocade to
match, had a pattern of French lilies on it. She loved every inch
of the place. <i>What</i> a happy ending to all their ups and
downs!...to be settled at last in such a home. Did she look back on
the "Black Hole," or the snails and damp of Buddlecombe, she felt
she did not always fully appreciate her present good fortune.</p>

<p>But Lizzie here striking up a tune Mary knew, her thoughts came
back with a jerk. She eyed the singer in listening, and: "Handsomer
than ever" was her mental comment; although by now Lizzie was
embarked on that adventure which, more than any other, steals from
a woman's good looks. What with her full, exquisitely sloping
shoulders&mdash;they stood out of the low-cut bertha as out of a
cup&mdash;her dimpled arms and hands, the fingers elegantly curled
on the notes of the piano; her rich red lips, opening to show the
almond-white teeth; her massive throat, swelling and beating as she
sang...yes, Lizzie had indeed thriven on matrimony. It was
otherwise with John. One had grown gradually used, as time passed,
to the loss of that air of radiant health, of masterful assertion,
which had formerly distinguished him. But since his marriage he had
turned almost into an old man. Thin as a lath, he walked with a
slight stoop, and hair and beard were grey. His face seemed to have
grown longer, too, more cadaverous; his eye had an absent, inturned
expression. At dinner he had been very silent. He had just sat
there listening to Lizzie, hanging on her lips&mdash;really, if he
went on like this when the two of them were at a stranger's house,
it would not be quite the thing.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in the drawing-room, Lizzie had made open complaint
of his inertia; discussing him in that barefaced way of hers which
plumed itself on calling a spade a spade.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is growing stodgy, dehling&mdash;stodgy and slow! I
said to him the other day, I said: 'John, love! this will
<i>never</i> do. <i>Where</i> is the man I married?' Will you
believe it, Mary, he actually wished to stop at home from
Government House Ball last night? While this evening, if you
please, he throws up an important dinner-party at Sir Joshua
Dent's, to come here. Not but what it has been a <i>charmin'</i>
evening, dehling. But a man in John's position has not the right to
pick and choose."</p>

<p>"Are you sure he is quite well, Lizzie? He looks very thin to
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, yes! Perfectly well. John was never made to be
fat."</p>

<p>The laggards at length appearing, Lizzie crashed out a chord and
rose from the piano-stool to hail and reproach them. "A pretty pair
to be sure," cried she playfully yet not without malice, the while
she slid on rings and clicked the catches of bracelets; a pretty
pair of husbands to prefer the society of their pipes to that of
their wives! She had been so looking forward to a duo with Richard.
It was evident she had reckoned without her host! Richard made one
lame attempt to fall in with her tone, John none at all. He seemed
only in haste to go; asked for the carriage to be brought round at
once; himself rang the bell and gave the order.</p>

<p>Lizzie might be too full of her own grievances to notice how the
wind blew; but Mary had eyes in her head. She saw that something
was seriously amiss the moment the two men entered the room.
Richard looked pale and distracted&mdash;and as for John! Whatever
could be the matter? Had they quarrelled?...had a scene?</p>

<p>Then, in coming along the passage from the bedroom, with Lizzie
enshawled at her side, she caught a murmured word of Richard's that
was evidently meant only for John's ear. And when she had seen her
guests off she did not re-enter the house, but stood on the
verandah, anxiously awaiting Richard who had gone to open the
gate.</p>

<p>At the crunch of his feet on the gravel, she moved forward,
exclaiming impetuously before she was level with him: "What's the
matter? What was wrong with John to-night?"</p>

<p>"Matter? What on earth do you mean?" He stooped to pick up
something; was exaggeratedly casual and indifferent.</p>

<p>"Now, dear, you needn't put on that tone to me. I saw directly
you came into the room...have you and he fallen out?"</p>

<p>"Good God, no! What have you got in your head now?"</p>

<p>"Well, then what is it? You can't deceive me, Richard...you
don't look like that for nothing."</p>

<p>"Who wants to deceive you, I'd like to know?" He was very short
and gruff.</p>

<p>"Is John ill?"</p>

<p>"My dear Mary, don't try and <i>pump</i> me, if you please! You
know my aversion to that kind of thing."</p>

<p>"Richard, I heard with my own ears what you said to him in the
hall...about a possible loophole. What did you mean? Oh,
<i>don't</i> be so obstinate!&mdash;Very well, then! I shall go
over and see John myself, the first thing in the morning."</p>

<p>"Indeed and you'll do nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"He's my brother. I've a right to know what's happened."</p>

<p>"A confidence is a confidence; and I'm hanged if I'll be
hectored into betraying it."</p>

<p>"Anyone would think I was asking out of mere curiosity," cried
Mary; and tears of vexation rose to her eyes. "I know&mdash;I have
the feeling&mdash;there's something wrong. And you go on talking
about confidences...and your own pride in not betraying them...when
John looked to me as if he'd got his death sentence."</p>

<p>Richard's start did not escape her. He retorted, though less
surely: "But it is at his own urgent request, Mary, that I hold my
tongue!"</p>

<p>"Then he <i>did</i> come to consult you about his health? Oh,
Richard, please!...don't keep me in suspense. What is it?"</p>

<p>"My dear, if you had gone through what I did to-night! I suppose
I may as well out with it; for as usual with your wild shot you
have hit the bull's-eye. The fact of the matter is, what I had to
tell John did amount to a sentence of death."</p>

<p>"Then...then it is..."</p>

<p>"The worst. I examined him. A growth in the liver. No, too late
now, for anything of that kind. My private opinion is he hasn't
more than six months to live."</p>

<p>"<i>Richard!</i>...though I think I've been afraid of something
like this...it's just as if, inside me, I had felt what was
coming."</p>

<p>"And I suspected it. But you know, Mary, what John is...so
unapproachable. I must say this though: I was moved this evening to
a profound admiration for him. He took the verdict like a
man...without flinching."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. But what does that matter now? The thing is, you've
let him go home alone&mdash;with this on his mind&mdash;and only
Lizzie beside him...who cares for no one but herself." Mary had not
known she thought this of Lizzie; it just popped out.</p>

<p>"A great spider!...that's what the woman is, if you want my
opinion," cried Mahony angrily. "But what could I
do?&mdash;Besides, at heart, I'm one with him. There are crises in
a man's life that are best fought through alone."</p>

<p>"Not while I'm here. Where I'm going? Why, to him, of
course!"</p>

<p>"At this hour of night? Indeed I advise you very strongly, Mary,
to do nothing of the kind. Not only will he resent&mdash;and
rightly too&mdash;my having broken my word, but he won't thank you
either for intruding.&mdash;And he'll have gone to bed. How can you
knock him up? What excuse have you?"</p>

<p>Mary reached for a wrap and threw it over her shoulders. "John
won't be in bed. And I'll make it all right about you; don't be
afraid.&mdash;No, no, I'll just walk over. As for intruding...I've
always understood John better than any of you. Besides, I don't see
how people can care whether they do or not at a time like
this."</p>

<p>"Well, at least put on a pair of sound walking-boots and take a
shawl. Of course I am. If you must go, I go with you."</p>

<p>Stepping out of the gate they plodded through the sand of the
road that led past now a large garden, now a wild, open space
covered with gorse and heath. Masses of firs stood out black and
forbidding. In the distance could be heard the faint lapping of the
sea.</p>

<p>They walked in silence. Once only did Mary exclaim aloud, out of
the many conflicting thoughts that were going round in her head:
"Lizzie, of course, must know nothing. The last thing John will
want is for her to be worried or upset."</p>

<p>And Mahony: "It will not be long now before she and every one
else has to know."</p>

<p>"When I think...how...how proud she has been of it all&mdash;I
mean John's position...and their entertainments...and his
future&mdash;how she has looked forward to the title coming...Oh
dear, oh dear! If only Jinny were beside him now...or poor dear
Emma."</p>

<p>On reaching the house they unlatched the gate with care, and
crept like a pair of conspirators over the grass, to avoid the
noise their steps would have made on the gravel. The venetian
blinds were down, but bars of light filtered through them in
Lizzie's bedroom on the one side, and in John's sanctum on the
other. Mary tiptoed round the verandah, and tapped on her brother's
window-pane.</p>

<p>"It is I, John...Mary."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, then the French window was
noiselessly opened, and she disappeared inside the room.</p>

<p>On the front verandah a rocking-chair had been left standing.
Mahony sat down in it and waited...and waited. Time passed; an
hour...two hours...and still Mary did not return. Lizzie's light
had long ago gone out; not a sound came from the house; nor did any
living thing move in garden or road. So absolute was the stillness
that, more than once as he sat, he heard a petal drop from a
camellia in the central bed. John had a fine show of these stiff,
scentless flowers. They stood out, white and waxen, against the
dark polish of their leaves.</p>

<p>It was spring, and a night warm enough to release the scents of
freesia and boronia; though as usual the pittosporums outdid all
else. There was no moon; but the stars made up for that; the sky
was powdered white with them&mdash;was one vast field of glittering
silver. Leaning back in his chair Mahony lay looking up at them and
thinking the old, well-worn thoughts that besiege a mortal at sight
of the Creator's prodigality. Pigmy man's insignificance in face of
these millions of worlds; the preposterousness of the claim that
his tiny existence can engage the personal notice of Him who has
strewn the Milky Way; and yet the bitter reality of his small, mad
miseries, the bottomless depths of his mental anguish: pain, as the
profoundest of life's truths, the link by which man is bound up
with the Eternal...pain that bites so much deeper than pleasure,
outlasting pleasure's froth and foam as granite outlasts
thistledown.</p>

<p>And now John's link was being forged...his turn had come to
taste pain's bitterness&mdash;John who, all his days, had looked
haughtily down on weakness and decay, as touching others, not
himself. The material things of this world had been his pride and
his concern. His soul, that poor soul which Mary, once more the
comforter, was standing by in its black hour, had gone needy and
untended. Now he was being called on to leave everything he prized:
marriage and happiness, wealth, a proud standing, ambition crowned.
Never, in his forward march, had John looked deeper; though in his
own way he had walked according to his lights: a man of enterprise
and energy, upright in business, grappling with the hardships of a
new country, a pathfinder for those who would come after.&mdash;Yet
for all this, a strangely unsympathetic nature! It was not alone
the absence of the spiritual in him. It was the cold, proud, narrow
fashion in which he had lived enclosed in his earthy shell, keeping
the door rigidly shut on intruders. No one had really known
John&mdash;known what manner of man housed within. Perhaps he had
acted thus out of fear; had been afraid of the strange fears that
might be found in him. Afraid of his fellows discovering that he
was hollow, a sham and a pretence, where they had imagined
wonderful strength and lovely virtues.</p>

<p>Well!...be that as it might. The time was past for probing and
conjecturing. John's hour had struck; and the phantom which had
thus far borne his name, striding confident and alert through the
world of men, would soon be blotted out. However one looked at it,
it was a melancholy business. The swiftness of the blow made one
realise, anew, on the edge of what an abyss one walked. Life was
like a procession that trooped along this perilous margin, brimful
of hope and vigour, gay, superbly unthinking; and then of a sudden
there was a gap in the ranks, and one of the train had vanished,
had pitched head-foremost into the depths, to be seen no
more&mdash;by mortal eyes at least. Such a disaster must surely
say&mdash;to those who had pinned their hearts to this world, with
no more than a conventional faith in one to come (which amounted to
little or none)&mdash;must surely seem to say: take all you can get
while there is still time! A little while and it may be too late.
Even in himself, who had won through to the belief that life was a
kind of semi-sleep, death the great awakening, it called up the old
nervous fear of being snatched away before he was ready to go. One
lived on...<i>he</i> lived on...inactive as a vegetable...and at
any moment the blow might fall, and his chance be gone for
ever&mdash;of doing what he had meant to do, of seeing what he had
meant to see. And now, sitting there under the multitudinous stars,
Mahony let the smothered ache for movement, the acute longing for
change of scene that was smouldering in him, come to full
consciousness. Yes, there was no denying it: the old restlessness
was strong on him again; he was tired of everything he
knew&mdash;tired of putting on his clothes in the morning and
taking them off at night; tired of nursery talk and the well-known
noises about the house, and the faces he saw every day. Tired of
his books, too, and of his own familiar company. He wanted fresh
scenes and people; wanted to open his eyes on new surroundings; be
on the move again&mdash;feel a deck under his feet, and the rigours
of a good head wind&mdash;all this, while health and a semblance of
youth were left him. Another few years and he would be past
enjoying it. Now was the time to make the break...cut his
bonds...front Mary's grief and displeasure.</p>

<p>Mary. At her name the inner stiffening, the resistance, with
which his mind had approached her, yielded; and in its place came a
warm uprush of feeling. Her behaviour this very night&mdash;how
surely and fearlessly she had come to the stricken man's aid,
without a single hampering thought of self! There was nobody like
Mary in a crisis: happy the mortal who, when his end came, had her
great heart to lean on. That was worth all else. For of what use,
in one's last hour, would be the mental affinity, the ties of
intellect he had lately so pitied himself for having missed? One
would see these things then for the earth-trimmings they were. A
child faced with the horrors of the dark does not ask for his fears
to be shared, or to have their origin explained to him. He cries
for warm, enfolding arms with which to keep his terrors at bay; or
which, if met these must be, alone can help him through the ordeal.
Man on his death-bed was little more than such a child; and it was
for the mother-arms he craved, to which he clung in passing, until,
again like a child, he had dropped to sleep. Hope, faith and love,
these three...yes, but needed was a love like Mary's, compounded of
utter selflessness, and patience, and infinite forbearance&mdash;a
love which it was impossible to sin against or overthrow...which
had more than a touch of the divine in it; was a dim image of that
infinite tenderness God Himself might be assumed to bear towards
the helpless beings He had created. Measured by it, all other human
experience rang hollow.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-4" id="ch-2-3-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>Mamma and Papa were going away; Master Cuffy would need to be a
<i>very</i> good boy and do everything he was told; so that Mamma
would be pleased with him when she came back. Thus Nannan, while
Eliza and she gave the three children their morning bath; and four
blue and two black eyes were turned on her in curiosity and
wonderment. Cuffy, extending his arm to have the raindrops rubbed
off it, echoed her words: "Mamma and Papa goin' away!" It sounded
exciting.</p>

<p>After breakfast he broke the news to Effalunt, who, though now
in his old age, hairless, and a leg short, was still one of the
best beloveds; for Cuffy had a faithful heart.</p>

<p>Going away? What would it be like? Hi-spy-hi in the garden?...or
a pitchnick?...or Mamma putting on a pretty dress wif beads round
her neck?</p>

<p>He played at it during the morning: he got under an opossum-rug
and was a bear to the Dumplings, and go'ed away. Later on, he was
allowed to crawl inside a leather trunk that stood in Mamma's
bedroom, and have the lid <i>nearly</i> shut over him.</p>

<p>The carriage came round after lunch; the trunk was hoisted to
the roof; Mamma and Papa had their bonnets on.</p>

<p>There stood Nannan, a Dumpling's hand in each of hers. The
babies, though o-eyed, were serene; but Cuffy by now was not so
sure. He had watched Mamma's dresses being put into the trunk and
Eliza sitting on it, to make it shut; and the thing that worried
him was, how Mamma could get up in the morning if her clothes were
locked inside the big box. He began to feel uncomfortable. And so,
now the moment had come, he was busy being a horse, capering up and
down the verandah, stamping, tossing his head.</p>

<p>The Dumplings obediently put up their faces and offered their
bud-mouths. Cuffy had to be called to order.</p>

<p>Said Mary: "Why, darling, aren't you coming to kiss Mamma and
Papa good-bye? Or be a little sorry they're going?"</p>

<p>Sorry? Why? He hadn't been naughty! Perfunctorily Cuffy did what
was required of him, but his heart went on being a horse.</p>

<p>It was not till night that the trouble broke. Then, as often as
Nannan entered the nursery, he was sitting bolt upright and
wide-eyed in his crib, his little face looking each time wanner and
whiter as he piped: "Is Cuffy's Mamma and Papa tum 'ome yet,
Nannan?"</p>

<p>"There you have it!" said Nurse to Eliza. "This is what happens
when gentlemen get to interfering in things they don't understand.
If the doctor 'ud just 'ave let me say they were gone to a party,
there'd 'ave been none of this. Master Cuffy knows well enough what
a party is, and though it 'ad lasted for weeks it wouldn't 'ave
made any difference to him, bless 'is little heart! It's the things
they <i>don't</i> understand that worries children. This fad now
that they must 'ave nothing but the truth told 'em. Lord bless you!
If we did that, there soon wouldn't be any more children
left...nothing but little old men and women."</p>

<p>And to mark her disapproval of Mahony's methods, Nannan kept the
forbidden lamp alight, and sat by the cribside with Cuffy's hand in
hers till he fell asleep.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mary and Richard had taken the afternoon train to
Ballarat. For the date set for Tilly's marriage had come right in
the middle of the trouble about John.</p>

<p>Seated in a saloon carriage Mary undid her bonnet-strings and
put her feet up on the cushions. Off at last! And opposite her sat
Richard&mdash;a morose and unamiable Richard, it was true, who made
it abundantly plain that he was being dragged to Ballarat against
his will. Still, there he was, and that was the main thing. Up to
the last minute she hadn't felt sure of him.</p>

<p>She had early determined that it was his duty to be present at
Tilly's wedding, and had spared no pains to win him over. Hadn't it
to a certain extent been his fault that Tilly's plans had failed,
the time she stayed with them before Cuffy was born? If he had not
been so down on her, the plot she was hatching might then and there
have come to a head. As it was, one thing after another had
happened to delay the issue. Misunderstanding Tilly's abrupt
departure, Purdy had disappeared up-country again, on his
commercial rounds. Then, still up-country somewhere, he had been in
a frightful buggy-accident, pitching out head-foremost, and all but
breaking his neck. For months nothing could be heard of him, he
lying at death's door with concussion and broken bones, in a little
bush hospital. When Tilly did finally contrive to run him to earth,
he was literally at his last farthing, and a sick and broken man.
Tilly had behaved like her own splendid self: waiving any false
pride, she had journeyed straight to see him; and at their very
first meeting they had arrived at an understanding (Mary could make
a shrewd guess how) and were now to be man and wife. An even more
urgent reason why Richard should appear at the wedding was, it
would greatly improve Purdy's social standing, if it became known
that Dr. Mahony had travelled all the way from Melbourne to be
present. And Purdy, poor fellow, could well do with such a lift.
Even she, Mary, who had known him in so many a tight fit, had felt
shocked at his condition after his last adventure.</p>

<p>Thus she reflected as she watched the landscape slip past:
yellowish-grey flats, or stone-strewn paddocks tufted with clumps
of brown grass, all of which she had seen too often before to pay
much heed to them. Still she never wanted to read in a train. So
unlike Richard, whose idea of a journey was to bury himself in a
book from start to finish. At the present moment he was deep in a
pamphlet entitled: "The Unity, Duality or Trinity of the
Godhead?"&mdash;Tch, what questions he did vex his head with!...he
must always be trying to settle the universe. If only he would
sometimes give his poor brains a rest.</p>

<p>He was looking pale and washed out, too, not by any means his
best...for meeting all the old friends. But what could you expect
if he <i>would</i> spend his life cooped up indoors?&mdash;never
leaving the house except to attend long, hot seances; or sittings
with Gracey. And these had rather fallen off of late. Mary didn't
know why, and he said nothing; but Lizzie as usual was prolific in
hints. Poor old Richard! She did hope things would go smoothly for
him during the next three days. She would feel relieved when they
were over.</p>

<p>But no sooner did they reach Ballarat than the trouble began. On
the platform stood Tilly, wreathed in smiles, open-armed in
welcome, but gone, alas, was the decent and becoming black to
which, as "old Mrs. Ocock," she had been faithful for so long. In
its stead...well, there was no mincing the fact: she looked fit for
<i>Punch!</i> Her dress, of a loud, bottle-green satin, was in the
very latest mode, worn entirely without crinoline, so that her full
form was outlined in unspeakable fashion; her big capable hands
were squeezed into lemon-coloured kid gloves, tight to bursting,
and on her head perched a monstrous white hat, turned up at the
side and richly feathered.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear!"</p>

<p>For Mary knew very well that neither the genuine sincerity of
Tilly's greeting, nor her multitudinous arrangements for their
comfort, would suffice to blot from Richard's mind the figure she
cut this day.</p>

<p>Climbing to the driver's seat of an open buggy, all her feathers
afloat, Tilly trotted a pair of cream ponies in great style up
Sturt Street. Of course everybody in Ballarat knew her, so it
didn't matter for herself what she looked like. It was Richard who
was to be pitied.</p>

<p>The next thing to provoke him was the arbitrary way in which she
disposed of his personal liberty. She had it all fixed and settled
that, directly supper was over, he should go back to town, to
"Moberley's Hotel," and there spend the evening with the
bridegroom-elect.</p>

<p>"She wants them to be seen in public together," thought Mary as
she helped Richard on with his overcoat and muffled him up in a
comforter; for the air on this tableland struck cold, after
Melbourne's sea-level. "And for that, of course, there's no better
place than Moberley's Coffee Room."&mdash;Aloud she said
reprovingly: "Ssh! She'll hear you. You know, dear, you needn't
stop long." But Richard, chilly and tired from the railway journey,
looked as though he could cheerfully have consigned Tilly and her
nuptials to Hades.</p>

<p>"And now you and I can 'ave a real cosy evening, love, while the
lords of creation smoke and jaw about early days," said dear blind
old Tilly. Or perhaps she was not quite so blind as she seemed; and
just wanted to be rid of Richard and the atmosphere of glacial
politeness that went out from him. Anyhow off he set, with a very
bad grace, and the two women retired to Tilly's bedroom. Here a
great log fire burned on the whitewashed hearth; and Tilly kept the
poker in her hand with which to thump the logs, did the blaze
threaten to fail. This dyed the dimity-hangings of the fourposter;
made ruddy pools in the great mahogany wardrobe.</p>

<p>Said Tilly: "Well, here we are again, Poll, you and me, like so
often before...and the day after to-morrow's me wedding-day. 'Pon
my word it's hard to believe; and yet...I don't know, dearie, but
somehow it seems no time since us three bits of girls used to sit
over the fire and gas about all the grand things that was going to
happen to us. That's ages back, and yet, except that we're grown a
bit hulkier you and me, it might be only yesterday. I don't feel a
day older and that's the truth; which is odd when you come to think
of it...with pa and ma and Jinn and poor old Pa all gone, these
ever so many years! I say, <i>do</i> you remember, Poll, how Purd
used to ride down from Melbourne? And how, when 'e'd gone, I 'd
count the days off on me fingers till 'e'd come again?"</p>

<p>"I think you're a very lucky woman, Tilly, to get your heart's
wish like this. I do hope it will bring you every happiness."</p>

<p>"I think it will, Poll. I'm not going into it with my eyes shut,
or any of the flighty notions one has as a young girl&mdash;heaven
on earth and bunkum of that sort. But now, listen to me, dearie,
there's things I want to say to you. First of all, Mary, I've
fixed, once we're spliced, for Tom and Johnny to come back to this
house&mdash;which they never ought to 'ave left. I won't say it
'asn't taken a bit of managing. But my mind was quite made up. It's
gone to my heart, all these years, to see how badly those poor lads
were cared for. Enough to make poor old Pa turn in 'is grave."</p>

<p>But Mary had raised her eyebrows. For all its kindness, she
thought the plan a most unwise one. Just suppose Purdy should turn
nasty! In subtle connection the question sprang to her lips: "What
about the money side of it&mdash;settlements, and all that?"</p>

<p>Tilly nodded. "Ah! I can see what you're thinking,
love&mdash;writing me down a lovesick old fool who's going to let
Pa's good money be made ducks and drakes of. It's true, most of
what I've got <i>will</i> pass to Purd, to do as 'e likes with. But
somehow I don't believe 'e'll be a waster. A man who's gone short
as long as him...However, just in case, Poll"&mdash;here Tilly sank
her voice to a mysterious hiss&mdash;"the fact is, love, I've got a
reserve fund of my own, a nest-egg so to speak, which I don't mean
to let on one word about...no, not to anybody. Except you. I've
laid something by, my dear, in the last few years, made a bit at
the races; sold out of <i>Blazing Diamonds</i> in the nick of time;
and the long and the short of it is, Mary, I've between seven and
eight thousand by me at this very minute. What's more, I intend to
keep it; just let it lie, have it to draw on, in case of trouble.
One never knows. I've got a small tin box, my dear, and out in the
dairy, going down the ladder into the cellar, a flag's come loose,
which just leaves room for it. There's no chance there of fire, or
thieves either&mdash;no one but myself even sets foot in the place.
And if anything happens to me, it's there you'll find it. The boys
are to have it, if I go first. For as you can see, love, with no
blood-tie between them and me, there wouldn't be much call on Purd,
would there, to support 'em after my death?"</p>

<p>Indeed that was true; nor could Purdy be blamed, if he failed to
recognise the obligation. It said a good deal for him that he was
willing to accept, as inmates of his house, these two middle-aged
men, one of whom was a confirmed drunkard with lucid intervals, the
other little more than an overgrown child. As for Tilly's plan of
keeping a large sum of money on the premises, risky though it
seemed, Mary faltered in her criticism of it. For she knew too well
the advantage of a private purse into which you could dip at will.
Instead of having to run to your husband with all the little extra
expenses that <i>would</i> crop up, spare as you might. These were
never kindly greeted. Richard, too, had been the most generous of
husbands, and she a fairly good manager. Tilly on the other hand
was lavish and lordly with money, Purdy still a dark horse in
respect of it.</p>

<p>Another thing, as long as Purdy and Mr. Henry knew nothing,
Tilly could neither be wheedled out of her savings nor bullied into
reinvesting them.</p>

<p>When at the end of an hour the two women kissed good-night,
Tilly uttered her usual request: "Now mind, not a word to the
doctor!"</p>

<p>Oh dear no! (<i>How</i> Richard would have jeered!) Besides,
when he got home some half-hour later, he was so full of a new
grudge against Tilly that every word had to be weighed, for fear of
fanning the flames. It seemed that on reaching Moberley's, he had
found Purdy the centre of a rowdy party, whose noise and laughter
could be heard even before he entered the hotel. More: his
appearance was totally unexpected. Purdy looked as if he couldn't
believe his eyes; ejaculated: "What, Dick? You here already?" and
then turned back to his companions&mdash;the motley collection of
commercial travellers and bar-haunters he had gathered round him.
Ten minutes of this were enough for Mahony; he slipped unobserved
from the room. Recognising, however, that the appointment had been
a ruse on Tilly's part to get rid of him, he did not come back to
the house, but took a long walk round the lake in the dark. There,
at least, he could be sure of not meeting any one he knew.</p>

<p>He seemed to have this idea of dodging familiar faces on the
brain. Did ever any one hear the like?...on his return, for the
first time, to the place where he had spent a third of his
life...where he had been so well known and sought after. But really
<i>just</i> how odd Richard had become, Mary did not grasp till
now. And before the following day was out, she was heartily sorry
she had not left him at home. One of his worst bad nights did not
help to mend matters. He vowed he had not missed the striking of a
single hour; but had tossed and turned on a too hard bed, in a too
light room, listening to the strange noises of a strange house, and
wakened for good and all long before dawn, by the crowing of "a
thousand infernal roosters." Before any one else stirred he was up
and out, on a long tramp bushwards.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done with him. Summoned to the
drawing-room to greet Amelia Grindle and Agnes Ocock, who drove
over immediately after breakfast "for a glimpse of our darling
Mary," he was so stiff and found so little to say that poor Amelia,
timid and fluttery as ever, hardly dared to raise her eyes from her
boots. Thereafter Mary left him in peace on the back verandah, and
sought to waylay Tilly, whose main idea of hospitality&mdash;poor
old Tilly!&mdash;was continually to be bothering him with something
to eat.</p>

<p>The person who did not look near was Purdy; and this was an
additional source of offence. The least he could have done, said
Richard, was to ride out and make up for his offensive behaviour of
the night before. Didn't the fellow grasp that he, Mahony, had come
to Ballarat solely with the object of doing him a good turn?
Privately Mary thought it very unlikely that Purdy, or Tilly
either, saw Richard's presence in this light. Aloud she observed
that he must know it would not be considered proper for the
bridegroom to hang about the house, the day before the wedding. But
Richard said: propriety be hanged!</p>

<p>He also flouted her suggestion that he should himself pay some
visits&mdash;look up the Archdeacon, or Chinnery of the National,
or those colleagues on hospital or asylum with whom he had once
been intimate.</p>

<p>"Not I! If they want to see me, let <i>them</i> make the
overture."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. Of course they'd like to see you again."</p>

<p>"I know better."</p>

<p>"Then why, if you're so sure of it, feel hurt because they don't
come? For that's what you are," said Mary bluntly. She wore a large
cooking-apron over her silk gown, and looked tired but content. She
had helped to set the wedding-breakfast on long trestle-tables
running the length of the hall; had helped to pack and strap the
bride's trunks for the journey to Sydney; had baked some of her
famous cakes, and laid the foundation for the more elaborate cream
dishes that were to be whipped up the first thing next morning.</p>

<p>She went on: "Personally, I don't see how you can expect people
to run after you, when you've never troubled to keep up with
them...written a line or sent a message." And just because she
herself thought <i>some</i> of Richard's old friends might have
done him the compliment of calling, Mary spoke very warmly. Adding:
"Well, at least you'll take a stroll round the old place now you're
here, and see how it's grown."</p>

<p>"Indeed and I'll do nothing of the sort!...now don't start
badgering me, Mary. Why on earth should I go to the trouble of
soldering old links, for the sake of a single day? I'll never be
here again."</p>

<p>"Tch, tch!" said Mary. "With you it's always yourself...nothing
but I, I, I!"</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word!...I like that. After me dragging all this
way...not to speak of being perched up to-morrow before a churchful
of people, for them to stare at!"</p>

<p>At this Mary laughed aloud. "Oh, Richard! As if they would ever
think of looking at anybody but the bride!...or bridegroom."</p>

<p>But Richard, it seemed, suffered from an intense nervous
conviction that he would be a target for all eyes.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Something before three o'clock the following afternoon, Mary
stood on the front verandah, which was white and scrunchy with
flowers and rice, and watched him, carpet-bag in hand, make a dash
for gate, trap, and the train that was to carry him back to town.
Indoors the guests still lingered: you could hear a buzz of talk,
the clink of glasses, the rustle of silk; and she herself was not
leaving till next day, having promised Tilly first to see the house
restored to order. But nothing would persuade Richard to stop a
moment longer than was necessary. He fled.</p>

<p>Tossing hat and bag on the cushions of the railway carriage,
Mahony fell into a seat and wiped his forehead. Doors slammed; a
bell rang; they were off. Well, <i>that</i> was over, thank
God!...and never, no, never! would he let himself be trapped into
this kind of thing again. To begin with, he had been inveigled here
on false pretences. It no doubt buttered Tilly's vanity to see his
name topping the list of her wedding-guests. But as far as all else
was concerned, he might have stayed comfortably at home. Purdy had
not cared a threepenny-bit one way or the other. As for it ever
dawning on the fellow that he was being given a leg-up&mdash;a
social safe-conduct, so to speak&mdash;all such rubbish originated
in Mary's confounded habit of reading her own ideas into other
people. At his expense.</p>

<p>But while he could dismiss Tilly and her folly with a smile,
Purdy's bovine indifference roused a cold resentment in him.
Consciously he had washed his hands of the connection long since.
And yet it seemed as if a part of him still looked for
gratitude&mdash;or at least a show of gratitude&mdash;did he exert
himself on Purdy's behalf. Which was absurd.&mdash;And anyhow Purdy
had never been famous for delicacy of feeling&mdash;a graceless,
thankless beggar from the start. In his heyday, a certain debonair
blitheness had cloaked his shortcomings. Now, time having robbed
him of every charm, he stood revealed in all his crudity: obese,
loose-mouthed, with an eye grown shifty from overreaching his
fellow-men: <i>how</i> he plumed himself on his skill as a Jeremy
Diddler! Oh, this insufferable exaggeration!&mdash;this eternal
bragging...even while they were waiting in church for the arrival
of the bride, he had been unable to refrain. Mary said: "Do have
patience. Mark my words, Tilly will knock him into shape." But
Mahony doubted it. Once a boaster, always a boaster!&mdash;besides,
the fair fat Tilly was too far gone in love to wish to chip and
change her chosen. Her face had been oily with bliss as she stood
with her groom before the altar, he in a check the squares of which
could have been counted from across the road, draped in a
watch-chain on which he might have hanged himself; she, puce-clad,
in a magenta bonnet topped with roses the size of peonies, which
sat crooked over one ear. (Mary, cool and pale in silver grey,
looked as though sprung from a different branch of the human
race.)</p>

<p>What a farce the whole thing had been!...from beginning to end.
The congratulations he had had to smirk a response to on "his
friend's" marriage, "his friend's" good fortune. Then old Long's
flowery periods, which would have well befitted a dewy damsel of
eighteen, but bordered on the ludicrous when applied to Tilly, who
would never see forty again, and had been through all this before.
Henry Ocock "giving away" his mature stepmother and her money-bags,
his father's money-bags, those bags that should by rights have
descended to <i>his</i> son: in spite of his sleek suavity, it was
not hard to imagine the wrath that burned behind Henry's chalky
face and boot-button eyes. He was ageing, was Henry; white hairs
showed in his jetty beard and the creasing of his lids made him
look foxier than ever. But so it was with all of them. Those he had
left young were now middle-aged the middle-aged had grown old. Like
Henry's, their faces had not improved in the process. Time seemed
to show up the vacancy that had once been overlaid by rounded
cheeks and a smooth forehead. Or else the ugly traits in a nature,
ousting the good, had been bitten in as by an etcher's acid. He
wondered what secrets his own phiz held, for those who had eyes to
see. The failures and defeats his prime had been spent in
enduring&mdash;had each left its special mark, in the shape of
hollow, or droop, or wrinkle? Oh, his return to this hated place
called up bitter memories from their graves: raised one obscene
ghost after another, for his haunting. Here, he was to have
garnered the miraculous fortune that would lift him for ever out of
the mud of poverty; here had dreamt the marriage that was to be
like no other on earth; here turned back, with a big heart, to the
profession that should ensure him ease and renown&mdash;even the
cutting himself loose, when everything else had miscarried, was to
have heralded the millennium.&mdash;No! one's past simply did not
bear thinking about. Looking back was wormwood and a wound. It
meant remembering all the chances you had not taken; the gaudy
soap-bubble schemes that had puffed out at a breath; meant an
inward writhing at the toll of the years flown by, empty of
achievement&mdash;at the way in which you had let him get the
better of you. Time, which led down and down, with a descent ever
steeper and more rapid, till it landed you...in who knew what
Avernus?&mdash;Nervously Mahony unclasped his bag and rummaged a
book from its depths. To lose himself in another's thoughts was the
one anodyne left him.</p>

<p>The train was racing now. They had passed Navigator, white and
sweet with lucerne; and the discomforts and absurdities of the past
forty-eight hours were well behind him.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Cuffy, playing that evening on the front verandah, was surprised
by the sudden advent of his father, who caught him up, tossed and
soundly kissed him with a: "And how is my little man? How is my
darling?" But at three years old even a short absence digs a
breach. Cuffy had had time to grow shy. He coloured, hung his head,
looked sideways along the floor; and as soon as he was released
pattered off to Nannan and the nursery.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-5" id="ch-2-3-5"></a>Chapter V</h3>

<p>The old mahogany fourposter with the red rep hangings had been
brought out from among the lumber, and set up afresh in John's
study. And soon after his interview with Mahony John shifted his
quarters to this room, on the pretence of sleeping poorly and
disturbing his wife. Lizzie raised fierce objections to the change.
It took Mary to mollify her, and to insist that she must now place
her own health and comfort above everything. Save in this one
point, it was true, Lizzie needed small persuasion. The household
danced to her whims.</p>

<p>Emmy's room was only a trifle nearer the study than the other
bedrooms; but in everything that touched her father the girl's
senses were preternaturally acute. And so it happened that she
started out of her first sleep, wakened she did not know by what,
but conscious, even as she opened her eyes, of sounds coming from
her father's room&mdash;the strange, heart-rending sounds of a man
crying. Sitting up in bed, her hands pressed to her breast, Emmy
listened till she could bear it no longer: stealthily unlatching
the door, she crept down the passage to the study. And there, on
this and many another night, she lay crouched on the mat, her heart
bursting with love and pity; while John, believing himself alone
with his Maker, railed and rebelled, in blind anguish, against his
fate. Yes, Emmy knew before any one else that some disaster had
come upon her father. And in the riot of emotion the knowledge
stirred in her, there was one drop of sweetness: she alone shared
his secret.</p>

<p>The feeling of intimacy this engendered did much to help her
over the days of suspense that followed; when she waited from hour
to hour for the unknown blow to fall. She confided in no
one&mdash;not even Aunt Mary. Her father himself she dared not
approach. Papa was so stern with her. Once, after a night when she
really thought her heart would break, she ventured a timid: "Papa,
if there is anything...I mean, Papa...if I could..." But he stared
so angrily at her that she turned and ran from the room, for fear
of bursting out crying&mdash;as much at the sound of her own words
and the feeling of self-pity they roused in her, as at his cold
repulse. She did not see the look he threw after her as she went.
"Her mother's daughter," was his muttered comment; and long past
days rose before him, when there had been one at his side from whom
nothing was hid. Tatting and crocheting, crocheting and tatting,
Emmy gave her imagination free play. A failure in business, even
bankruptcy was the solution she favoured&mdash;being still too
young to face of herself the destructive thought of death. And did
this happen, and Papa lose all his money, then would come
<i>her</i> chance. He would learn that he had one faithful soul at
his side, one shoulder to lean on. Together they would go away, he
and she, right into the bush if necessary, and start life afresh.
But again there were moments when she indulged an even dearer hope:
at last, perhaps, Papa was beginning to see what a dreadful mistake
his marriage had been.</p>

<p>For Emmy hated her stepmother; hated her, and sat in judgment on
her, with the harshness of the young creature who has been wounded
in her tenderest susceptibilities. Thus, though for the most part
she rejoiced to know Lizzie among the uninitiated, she could also
burn with a furious, unreasoning anger against her for living on,
so blindly, so selfishly, without noticing that something was
amiss. At sight of the big woman lying stretched on her <i>chaise
longue</i>, idly fanning herself, book and vinaigrette at her
elbow; or Papa bathing her temples for her with lavender-water, or
running errands for her like a servant&mdash;at things like these
Emmy clenched her fist, and averted her tell-tale eyes. She hated,
too, Lizzie's vigorous, exaggerated manner of speaking; hated the
full red lips that went in and out and up and down when she talked;
her affected languor...her unwieldy figure...the baby that was on
the way.</p>

<p>But with the crash came also the chance of revenge. Then it was
Emmy's turn; and she could say in all good faith: "Oh, <i>don't</i>
let her&mdash;don't let...Mamma go in to him, Aunt Mary! She
worries him so." As always, there was just the suspicion of a
pause&mdash;a kind of intake of the breath&mdash;before she got the
"Mamma" out; a name here bestowed for the third time, and only
after a severe inward struggle, because <i>he</i> had wished
it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile John's serene and dignified existence had shattered to
its foundations; carrying with it, in its fall, the peace and
security of those lesser lives that depended on it. For close on
six months, he had kept his own counsel. With his once full lips
pinched thin in his old, greying face, he went doggedly to and from
the warehouse in Flinders Lane, as he had done every day for
five-and-twenty years: driving off at nine of a morning, and
returning as the clock struck six to escort Lizzie to any
entertainment she still cared to patronise: and this, though his
skin had gone the colour of dry clay or a dingy plaster, and he was
so wasted that his clothes seemed to flap scarecrow-like on his
bones. Mary's heart bled for him; and even Richard was moved to
remark that what John must be suffering, both mentally and
physically, God alone knew. But they could only pity in silence;
open compassion was not to be thought of: after the one terrible
night Mary had spent with John, the subject of his illness was
taboo, even to her. Alone, sheathed in his impenetrable reserve, he
prepared for his departure; bade farewell, behind locked doors, to
a life of surpassing interest, now cut short in mid-career. In
politics, his place would not be hard to fill. But of the great
business he had built up he was still the mainspring; and, in a
last spurt of his stiff pride, he laboured to leave all that
concerned it in perfect order.&mdash;And yet, watching him with her
heart in her eyes, Mary sometimes wondered...wondered whether the
unquenchable optimism that had made him the man he was had even yet
wholly deserted him. He had had so little experience of illness,
and was, she knew, still running privily from doctor to specialist;
giving even quacks and their remedies a trial. Did he nurse a hope
that medical opinion, right in ninety-nine cases, might prove wrong
in his, and he have the hundredth chance? One thing at least she
knew: he intended, if humanly possible, to bear up till the child
was born and Lizzie better able to withstand the blow.</p>

<p>But this was not to be. The morning came when, in place of
rising and tapping at his wife's door, solicitously to inquire how
she had passed the night, John, beaten at last, lay prostrate in
his bed...from which he never rose again.</p>

<p>A scene of the utmost confusion followed. Mary, summoned just as
she was sitting down to breakfast, found Lizzie in hysterics, John
writhing in an agony he could no longer conceal. The scared
servants scuttled aimlessly to and fro; the children, but half
dressed, cried in a corner of the nursery. Emmy alone had her wits
about her&mdash;though she, too, shook as with the ague.</p>

<p>Meeting Mary at the front door, she held out two clasped hands
imploringly. "Oh...what is it? Aunt Mary! what is the matter with
Papa?"</p>

<p>"Emmy...your poor, dear father&mdash;my darling, I look to you
to be brave and help me&mdash;he will need all our help now."</p>

<p>Long prepared for some such emergency, Mary took control.
Dispatching the groom at a gallop for the doctor, she mixed a
soothing-draught for Lizzie ("See to her first," was John's
whispered request) and gave John the strongest opiate she dared.
The children were put in the carriage, and sent to "Ultima Thule."
Then, as Richard had directed, Mary cleared the sickroom of
superfluous furniture; while Emmy bore a note to Miss
Julia&mdash;Mary's sole confidante. And faithful to a promise, Miss
Julia was back with Emmy inside an hour. Without her aid she at
once saw to Lizzie, and brought the servants to their
senses&mdash;without this sane, calm presence, Mary did not know
how she would have managed, John from the start obstinately
refusing to let her out of his sight. Or for that matter without
Emmy either...Emmy was her right hand. Nimble, yet light-footed as
a cat; tireless; brave; Emmy now proved her mettle. Nothing was
beneath her: she performed the most menial duties of the sickroom
with a kind of fiery, inner gratitude. And, these done, would sit
still as a mouse, a scrap of needlework in her hand, just waiting
for the chance of springing up afresh. Her young face grew thin and
peaked, and the life went out of her step; but she never
complained, or sought to obtrude her own feelings. Only one person
knew what she was suffering. It was on Auntie Julia's neck that she
had had her single breakdown, and wept out her youthful passion of
love and despair.</p>

<p>"What shall I do! Oh, what <i>shall</i> I do?"</p>

<p>And Auntie Julia, knowing everything, understanding everything,
wisely let her cry and cry till she could cry no more. "There,
there, my little one! There, there!" But after this Emmy did not
again give way. Indeed, thought Mary, there was something in her of
John's own harsh self-mastery: a trait that sat oddly on her soft
and lovely girlhood.</p>

<p>Lizzie was the sorest trial. But then, poor thing, was it to be
wondered at in her condition, and after the shock John had given
her? For when, that first morning he failed to present himself at
her bedside, Lizzie passed in a twinkling from a mood of pettish
surprise to one of extreme ungraciousness. The housemaid was
peremptorily bidden to go knock at the master's door and ask the
reason of his negligence. The girl's confused stammerings throwing
no light on this, Emmy was loudly rung for. "Pray, my love, be so
good as to find out if your Papeh, who has evidently
<i>forgotten</i> to wish me a good-morning, does not intend going
to town to-day!" And when Emmy, sick and trembling, yet with a kind
of horrific satisfaction, returned bearing John's brutal reply:
"No, not to-day, nor ever again!" Lizzie, now thoroughly roused,
threw on a wrapper and swept down the passage to her husband's
room.</p>

<p>On discovering the true state of things she dropped to the floor
in a swoon. Restored to consciousness and got back to bed, she fell
to screaming in hysterical abandonment&mdash;on his arrival the
doctor had more to do for her than for John, and pulled a long
face. And even when the danger of a premature confinement was over,
and the worst of the hysteria got under, she would lie and sob and
cry, breaking out, to whoever would listen, in wild
accusations.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary, love! When I think <i>how</i> I have been
deceived!...the trick that has been played on me...me who ought to
have known before any one else. John and his secrecy!&mdash;he has
made a fool of me, even in the eyes of the servants."</p>

<p>"My poor, dear Lizzie! Do believe me, he only wanted to spare
you...as long as he could. Consider him now, and his sufferings,
and don't make it harder for him than you can help. Think, too, of
your baby."</p>

<p>But she might as well have talked to a post: Lizzie continued
stormily to weep and to rail. The two older women bore patiently
with her, even coming to consider it a good thing that she was thus
able to vent her emotion. It remained for Emmy, Emmy with the hard
and unyoung look her face assumed when she spoke of her stepmother,
to make the bitter comment: "She's not really <i>sorry</i> for
Papa&mdash;she's <i>savage</i>, Aunt Mary, that's what she
is!"&mdash;a point of view which Mary herself was so rigidly
suppressing that it received but scant quarter. "Emmy, Emmy! You
must <i>not</i> say such things of your Mamma." But Richard
declared the girl had hit the nail on the head. It was herself and
herself alone Lizzie grieved for.</p>

<p>"And is it so unnatural? Has Fate not played her a shabby trick?
She took John, as we all know, because he was by far the best catch
that had ever come her way. Now, after a few brief years of glory,
and when her main ambition was about to materialise, the Lady
Turnham-to-be sees herself doomed to a widow's dreary existence:
all weepers and seclusion: with, for sole diversion, the care of an
unwanted infant. Not to speak of the posse of stepdaughters she has
loaded herself up with."</p>

<p>"It <i>does</i> sound harsh...the way you put it," said Mary,
and re-tied her bonnet-strings; she had run home one evening for a
peep at her children.</p>

<p>However, if he and Emmy were right about Lizzie and her
feelings, then what a blessing it was that John, in his illness,
made no demands on her, asking neither for nor after her. With his
one request on the morning of his collapse, that she should receive
first attention, all thought for her seemed exhausted: just as, in
the brutal answer he returned her by Emmy, had evaporated his love
and care. From the sound of her pitiless crying he turned with
repugnance away. Did she enter his room, with a swish of the
skirts, either forgetting to lower her voice or hissing in a
melodramatic whisper, he was restless till she withdrew. Except for
Mary&mdash;and he fretted like a child if Mary were long
absent&mdash;John asked only to be alone.</p>

<p>On taking to his bed he had severed, at one stroke, every link
with the outside world: and soon he was to lie drug-sodden and
mercifully indifferent even to the small world of his sickroom. But
before this happened he expressed one wish&mdash;or rather gave a
last order. The nature of his illness was not to be made known
beyond the family circle.</p>

<p>"Trying to keep his Chinese Wall up to the end," said Mahony.
"His death&mdash;like his life&mdash;is to be nobody's business but
his own. Well, well...as a man lives so he shall die!"</p>

<p>But Mary was much perturbed. A dying man's whim&mdash;and as
such, of course, it had to be respected. But what <i>could</i> it
hurt now whether people knew what was the matter with him or not?
Concealing the truth meant all sorts of awkward complications. But
Emmy, overhearing this, flushed sensitively and looked distressed.
"Oh, Aunt Mary, don't you <i>see</i>? Papa is...is <i>ashamed</i>
of having a cancer."</p>

<p>Ashamed?...ashamed of an illness?...Mary had never heard of such
a thing. But Richard, struck afresh by Emmy's acumen, declared:
"That's it! The girl is right. You call it a sick man's fancy, I
the exaggerated reserve of a lifetime, but Emmy knows better, sees
deeper than any of us." And added a moment later: "It strikes me,
my dear, that if instead of hankering after that impossible
scapegrace of a son, just because he <i>was</i> a son, your brother
had had a little more eye for the quick wits and understanding of
his daughter, he might have been a happier man."</p>

<p>News of the serious illness of the Honourable John Millibank
Turnham, M.L.C., brought an endless string of callers and inquirers
to the door: the muffled knocker thudded unceasingly. People came
in their carriages, on horseback, on foot; and included not merely
John's distracted partners, and his colleagues on the Legislative
Council, but many a lesser man and casual acquaintance&mdash;Mary
herself marvelled to see how widely known and respected John had
been. And those who could not come in person wrote letters of
condolence, sent gifts of luscious fruit and choice flowers and
out-of-season delicacies&mdash;anything in short of which kindly
people could think, to prove their sympathy. It was one person's
while to receive the visitors, answer the letters, acknowledge the
gifts. Fortunately this very person was at hand in the shape of
Zara. Zara's elegant manners and her ease in expressing herself on
paper were exactly what was wanted.</p>

<p>She and Hempel were staying in lodgings at Fitzroy, prior to
setting out on the forlorn hope of a sea voyage. For, after
numerous breakdowns, poor Hempel&mdash;he looked as if the first
puff of wind would blow him overboard; Richard called him: "The
next candidate for the Resurrection!"&mdash;had been obliged
definitely to abandon his pastorate. In the meantime he was resting
in bed from the fatigues of the train journey, before undertaking
the fresh fatigues to which Zara, in her wilful blindness,
condemned him.</p>

<p>At John's, Zara received in the dining-room among horsehair and
mahogany, as better befitting the occasion than the gilt and satin
of the drawing-room. Lugubriously clad, she spoke with the pious
and resigned air of one about to become a mourner. "My poor
brother," "Our great grief," "God's will be done!" But of an
evening when the rush was over, she carried to Lizzie a list of
names and gifts and a sheaf of letters.</p>

<p>Her sibilant tones were audible through the half-closed door.
"Yes, Judge O'Connor&mdash;yes, yes, my dear, himself in
person!...with his own and his lady's compliments...desires to be
kept informed of our dear John's progress."</p>

<p>And Lizzie's rich, fruity tones: "Major Grenville, did you
say?...on behalf of his Excellency? Very gratifying...very
gratifying indeed!"</p>

<p>Mary was never one to jib at trifles. But as often as Emmy heard
them at it, she clenched her fist and ground her teeth. <i>How</i>
she hated them!...hated them. To be able to care who called and who
didn't call, when Papa lay dying! In her passionate young egoism
she demanded that there should be no room in any mind but for this
single thought.</p>

<p>But, as week added itself to week, and John still lay prostrate,
and since, too, the most heartfelt inquiries evoked none but the
stereotyped response: "No improvement," the press of sympathisers
visibly declined. People ceased to call daily; came but once a
week; then at still wider intervals. And at length even the
hardiest dropped off, and a great stillness settled round the dying
man. John was forgotten; was reckoned to the dead before he was
actually of them. Only once more on earth would he, for a brief
hour, play a leading part.</p>

<p>The flawless constitution that had been so great an asset to him
in life stood him now in ill stead. His dying was arduous and
protracted. Behind the red rep hangings there went on one of those
bitter struggles with death that wring from even the least
sensitive an amazed: "Wherefore? To what end?" Cried Mahony,
watching John's fruitless efforts: "The day will come, I'm sure of
it, when we shall agree to the incurable sufferer being put
painlessly away. We need a lethal chamber, and not for dumb brutes
alone." At which Mary looked apprehensive, and wished he wouldn't.
A good job he was no longer in practice. Or what <i>would</i> his
patients have thought?</p>

<p>"Ah, thank God, the muzzle of medical etiquette is off my
jowl!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thought his wife, he was in his element, all
tenderness and consideration for John&mdash;he went to endless
trouble in procuring for him the newest make of
water-bed&mdash;which was just what one would expect of Richard.
Nor would he have him teased about religious questions or his
approaching end. On the other hand, had John shown the least desire
for religious consolation, Richard would have been the person to
see that he got it.</p>

<p>But this John did not. At those rare moments when he was awake
to his surroundings and tolerably free from pain, he lay exhausted
and inert, his eyes closed, and with little to distinguish him from
one already dead. What his innermost thoughts were, what his hopes
and fears of a hereafter, remained his own secret. The single wish
that crossed his lips seemed to point to his mind still occupying
itself with earthly things.</p>

<p>Mary, sewing beside the bed, looked up one day to find his
sunken eyes open and fastened on her.</p>

<p>She rose and leaned over him. "What is it, John? Do you want
anything?"</p>

<p>He signified yes with his lids, sparing himself any superfluous
word for fear of rousing up his enemy. Then, in a thick, raucous
whisper: "I should like...to see...the boy. Yours."</p>

<p>Thus it came about&mdash;greatly against the wish of Mahony, who
held that illness and suffering were evil sights for childish
eyes&mdash;that Cuffy was one day lifted into the carriage beside
Nannan, where he sat his little legs a-dangle, clad in his best
velvet tunic and with his Scotch cap on his head. He looked pale
and solemn. Nannan and Eliza had made such funny faces at each
other, and had whispered and whispered. And while she was dressing
him Nannan had talked about nothing but how good and quiet he must
be, and what would happen to him if he wasn't. In consequence,
directly he was set down from the carriage Cuffy started walking on
the tips of his toes; and on tiptoe, holding fast to his nurse's
hand, crept laboriously up the gravel path to the house.</p>

<p>At the front door stood Cousin Emmy, who kissed him and led him
in. Like Nannan she, too, said: "Now you must be a <i>very</i> good
boy, Cuffy, and not make the least noise." Cuffy's heart began to
thump with anxiety: he walked more gingerly than before. The house
felt like the nursery when the Dumplings were asleep. Emmy opened a
door into a room that was quite dark. It had also a very nasty
smell. Someone was snoring. Cuffy tried to pull back.</p>

<p>"Now, be good, Cuffy!"</p>

<p>Then he was at his mother's knee, mechanically holding out his
hands to have his little gloves peeled off. But his thoughts were
with his eyes &mdash;pinned to some one lying in a bed...a man with
a dark yellow face and a grey beard, who was asleep and
snoring&mdash;like Nannan did. Cuffy did not associate this
funny-looking person with his uncle; he just stood and stared
stupidly. Nevertheless, something very disturbing began to go round
inside him; and he swallowed hard.</p>

<p>Then two big black shiny eyes were awake and looking at him.
They looked and looked. Cuffy stood transfixed, his lips apart, his
breath coming unevenly, his own eyes round with a growing fear.</p>

<p>A yellow hand like a claw came over the bedclothes towards him,
and some one tried to speak; and only made a funny sound&mdash;and
tried again.</p>

<p>"...does you credit. But...at his age...John...a finer...child."
After which the eyes shut and the snoring began anew.</p>

<p>Then, though he had only just come, somebody said: "Kiss your
uncle good-bye, Cuffy."</p>

<p>This was too much. As he was lifted up Cuffy made protest,
wildly working his arms and legs. "No, no!"</p>

<p>But his lips had brushed something cold and clammy before, his
clothes all twisted round him, he was put back on the floor. And by
then the face on the bed had changed: the eyes were all wrinkles
now; the mouth like a big black hole. Somebody screamed. And now
people were scurrying about, and there came Aunt Lizzie running in
her dressing-gown, and she was naughty and cried, making the noise
he had been told not to. His own tears flowed; but true to his
promise he did not utter a sound.</p>

<p>Then some one took his hand and ran him out of the room to the
dining-room, where, his eyes wiped and his nose blown, Cousin Emmy
gave him a nectarine, which she peeled for him and cut up in
quarters, because it was "nicer so." He was also allowed to eat it
messily, and not scolded for letting the juice drip down his
tunic.</p>

<p>But at home again, he felt the need of blowing out his shrunken
self-esteem. It was a chance, too, of making himself big in the
eyes of his playfellow Josey, the youngest of his three cousins, a
long-legged girl of seven, who domineered over him, smacked him and
used his toys without asking. There she came along the verandah,
dragging his best horse and cart&mdash;with her nasty big black
eyes, and the hair that stuck straight out behind her round
comb.</p>

<p>Under seal of secrecy and with an odd sense of guilt, as if he
was doing something he ought not to, Cuffy confided to her his
discovery that big people could cry, too. "I seed your Mamma do
it."</p>

<p>But in place of being impressed Josey was very angry. Grabbing
the secretmonger's silky topknot, she shook him soundly. "That's a
storwy, Cuffy Mahony, and you're a howwid storwy-teller! Gwownup
people <i>never</i> cwy!" The fact that she spoke with a strong
lisp, while a baby like Cuffy would talk plainly, always rendered
Josey very emphatic. Moreover in the present case, she still burned
with shame at the disgraceful knowledge that not only Mamma could
cry, but Papa, too.</p>

<p>John died five days later at midnight.</p>

<p>The afternoon before, an odd thing happened. Mary and Emmy were
alone with him, he lying drugged and comatose, and Mary had been
fanning him, for it was very warm. Outside, beneath a
copper-coloured sky, a scorching north wind blew; the windows of
the room were shut against swirling clouds of dust. There was no
sound but John's laboured breathing, and, exhausted, Mary thought
she must have dropped into a doze. For when, warned by a kind of
instinct she started up, she saw that John's eyes were open: he was
gazing with a glassy stare at the foot-end of the bed. And as she
watched, an extraordinary change came over the shrunken, jaundiced
face. The eyes widened, the pin-hole pupils dilated; while the
poor, burst lips, on which were black sores that would not heal,
parted and drew back, disclosing the pallid flesh of the gums. John
was trying to smile.</p>

<p>A second later and the whole face was transfigured&mdash;lit by
an expression of rapturous joy. John even made an abortive effort
to raise himself&mdash;to hold out his arms. His breath came
sobbingly.</p>

<p>"Emma! Oh, <i>Emma!</i>...<i>Wife!</i>"</p>

<p>At first sound of her name, Emmy sprang from her seat behind the
curtains and threw herself on her knees at the bedside, close to
John's groping hand. "Papa!...yes, oh yes? Oh,
papa...<i>darling!</i>"</p>

<p>But John did not hear her. All the life left him was centred in
his eyes, which hung, dazed with wonder, on something visible to
them alone. Bending over the passionately weeping girl Mary
whispered: "Hush, hush, Emmy! Hush, my dear! He sees...he thinks he
sees your mother."</p>

<p>Mahony knew nothing of this occurrence till long after. By the
time he got there that evening, the death-agony had begun; and now
the one thought of those gathered round John's bed was to ease and
speed his passing. It was a murderous business. For the drug that
had thus far blunted the red-hot knives that hacked at his vitals
suddenly lost its power: injections now gave relief but for a few
moments on end; and, hour after hour, hour after hour, his
heart-breaking cry for help beat the air. "Morphia...morphia! For
God's sake, morphia!"</p>

<p>But the kindly, bearded physician who sat with a finger on
John's wrist remained impassive: the dose now necessary to reduce
the paroxysms would be more than the weakened heart could bear. And
so, livid, drenched in sweat, John fought his way to death through
tortures indescribable.</p>

<p>At the end of the afternoon those present felt that the limits
of human endurance had been reached. All eyes hung on the doctor's,
with the same mute appeal. The two men, Mahony and the other,
exchanged a rapid glance. Then, bending over the writhing anguished
thing that had once been John Turnham, the doctor addressed it by
name. "Mr. Turnham; you are in your right mind...and fully aware of
what you are saying. Do you take the injection necessary to relieve
you, of your own free will and at your own risk?"</p>

<p>"For the love of God!"</p>

<p>A moment's stir and business, and the blessed sedative was
running through the quivering veins, the last excruciating pangs
were throbbing with hammer-strokes to their end: upwards from the
feet crept the blissful numbness...rising higher...higher...higher.
And, as peace descended and the heavy lids fell to, Mahony stepped
forward, and taking one of the dying hands in his said in a loud,
clear voice: "Have no fear of death, John!"</p>

<p>Already floating out on the great river, John yet heard these
words and was arrested by them. Slowly the lids rolled back once
more, and for the fraction of a second the broken eyes met
Mahony's. In this, their last, living look, not a trace was left of
the man who had been. They were now those of one who was about to
be&mdash;fined and refined; rich in an experience that transcended
all mortal happenings; wise with an ageless wisdom. And as they
closed for ever to this world, there came an answer to Mahony's
words in ever so faint a flattening of the lips, an almost
imperceptible intake at the corners of the mouth, which, on the
sleeping face, had the effect of a smile: that lurking smile,
remote with peace, and yet touched with the lightest suspicion of
amused wonder, that sometimes makes the faces of the dead so good
to see.</p>

<p>John did not wake again. Towards midnight his breathing grew
more stertorous, the intervals between the breaths longer. And at
last the moment came when the watchers waited for the next...and
waited...in vain.</p>

<p>All was over; the poor weeping, shattered women were led from
the room. Mary, despite her grief, kept her presence of mind, and
Miss Julia with her. But Lizzie was convulsed; and poor little
Emmy, her long service ended, broke down utterly and had to be
carried to bed, and chafed, and dosed with restoratives. Zara was
bidden see to the children, John's three, who had been brought over
during the afternoon in case their father should ask for them:
forgotten, hungry, tired, they had cried themselves to sleep, and
now lay huddled in a tear-stained group on the dining-room sofa.
Mahony and the doctor busied themselves for yet a while in the
death-chamber; after which, decently composed and arranged, John
formed no more than a sheet-draped rising on the bed's smooth
plain. Mahony locked the door behind him and took the key. The
dogcart had come round, and Jerry, who was to drive back to town
with the doctor, stood, his collar turned up, all of a fidget to
get home to Fanny and his children. Mahony went out with them and,
having watched them drive off, paused to breathe the night air,
which was fresh and welcome after the fetid odours of the sickroom.
And standing there under the stars he sent, like an arrow of
farewell, a parting thought to the soul that might even now be
winging its way to freedom, and to whom soon all mysteries would be
plain. John had made a brave end. There had been no whining for
pity or pardon: on his own responsibility he had lived, and he died
by the same rule&mdash;the good Turnham blood had come out in him
to the last. And as he re-entered the house, where, by now, the
last exhausted watcher was sinking into unconsciousness, Mahony
murmured half-aloud to himself: "Well done, John...well done!"</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-6" id="ch-2-3-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>Some six months later the Mahonys set out on their second voyage
to England. They sailed by the clipper-ship <i>Atrata</i> and
travelled in style, accompanied by a maid to attend to Mary and
both nurses.&mdash;And "Ultima Thule" passed into other hands.</p>

<p>It had proved easier to persuade Mary to the break than Mahony
had dared to hope. John's illness and death paved the way. For, by
the time her long vigil at his bedside was over, and Lizzie seen
safely through a difficult confinement, Mary's own health was
beginning to suffer. A series of obstinate coughs and colds plagued
her; and a thorough change of air was advisable. A change of scene,
too. Though Mary was not given to moping and, at the time, had
thankfully accepted John's release, yet when it came to taking up
her ordinary life again the full sense of her loss came home to
her. And not to her alone but to every one. John's had been such a
vigorous personality. Its withdrawal left a gap nothing could
fill.</p>

<p>None the less, the sacrifice she was now called on to make was a
bitter one, and cost her much heartburning: when she first grasped
the <i>kind</i> of change Richard was tentatively proposing, she
burst into heated exclamation. What, break up their home
again?...their lovely home? Leave all the things they had collected
round them? Leave intimates and friends and their assured
position?...to go off no one knew where...and where nobody knew
them? Oh, he couldn't mean it!&mdash;And what about the
children?...still mere babies&mdash;"For though you talked till you
were black in the face, Richard, you would never get me to leave
them behind!"&mdash;and the drawbacks of ship-life for them at
their tender age?...the upset in their habits...not to speak of
having to watch them grow spoilt and fractious: winding up with her
dread of the sea, his antipathy to England and English life.</p>

<p>But Mahony, though he spoke soothingly, stuck to his guns. It
was only to be a visit this time, he urged. It could hardly hurt
the house to be let for a year or so. A good tenant would take good
care of it; and it would be there, just as it stood, for them to
come back to. Then both nurses would go with them; and as for the
darlings being too young for a voyage, that was the sheerest
nonsense: on the contrary, it would do them a world of good;
perhaps even turn Cuffy into a sturdy boy. The same could be said
for her own ailments: there was nothing like the briny for laying
coughs and colds; while the best cabin in the ship would go far
towards lessening the horrors of sea-sickness. As for England, they
would not know it for the same country, travelling as they did
to-day. Plenty of money, introductions to good people, going
everywhere, seeing everything; and ending up, if she felt disposed,
with a jaunt to the Paris Exhibition and a tour of the Continent.
"It isn't every wife, my dear, has such an offer made her."</p>

<p>But his words fell flat: Mary only shrugged her shoulders in
reply. Tours and exhibitions meant nothing to her. She hadn't the
least desire to travel&mdash;or at any rate to go farther afield
than Sydney or Tasmania. She had been so happy here...so perfectly
happy! Why, oh why, could Richard not be content? And that he could
forget so easily how he had hated England...and disliked the
English...well, no, she must be fair to him. As he said, life over
there would be a very different thing now they had money. (Though
all the money in the world wouldn't stop it raining!) He might also
be right about the voyage doing the chicks good; and it would
certainly give them, tiny tots though they were, just that
something which colonial-bred children lacked. But oh, her
home!...her beautiful home. To have to hand it over to strangers,
have strangers tramping on your best carpets, sleeping in your
beds, using your egg-shell china&mdash;even the best of tenants
would not care for the things as she did. She had asked nothing
better than to spend the rest of her life at "Ultima Thule"; and
here now came Richard, for whom even a few years of it had proved
too many. Luxury and comfort, or poverty and hard work, it did not
seem to matter which: the root of the evil lay in himself. On the
other hand she mustn't forget how splendidly he had behaved over
John's illness: never grumbling at her long absences, or at being
left to the tender mercies of the servants. Many another husband
might have said: let them hire some one to do their nursing, and
not wear out my wife over it! But Richard wasn't like that.</p>

<p>And her first heat cooled, wiser counsels prevailed; the end of
which was a sturdy resolve to smother her own feelings and think
only of him. Two considerations finally turned the scale. One was
that when, with Lizzie's convalescence, she was free to return
home, she had a nasty shock at the state in which she found
Richard. Without her to nag at him and rout him out, he had let
himself go as never before: he had forgotten to change his
under-clothing or have his hair cut; had neglected his meals,
neglected the children&mdash;lost interest even in his beloved
garden. And for all this they had to thank that horrid
spiritualism! During the last few months it had come to be a
perfect obsession with him; and from a tolerably clear-headed
person he had turned into a bundle of credulous superstition. He
actually sat for as long as an hour at a time, with a pencil in his
hand, waiting for it to write by itself&mdash;write messages from
the dead...and wasn't he angry when she laughed at him!</p>

<p>This was one thing&mdash;the chance for him of a complete break
with all such nonsense. Again, coming back to him as it were with
fresh eyes, she saw that he was beginning to look very elderly. He
seemed to be growing downwards, losing his height, through always
sitting crouched over books; and the fair silky hair at his temples
was quite silvery now, did you peer closely at it. It was hard to
think of Richard as old...and him still well under fifty. Yet the
coming on of age might account for much. Elderly people did settle
into ruts; and, once fixed in them, were impossible to move.
Perhaps his present morbid hankering after change was a kind of
warning from something inside him to shake himself up and get out
of his groove before it was too late. In which case it would be
folly and worse than folly, on her part, to try to prevent him.</p>

<p>For his sake then and for his alone. When it came to a question
of Richard's welfare, all other considerations went by the board.
One condition, though, she did stand out for, and that was, the
house should not be let to any one, no matter whom, for longer than
a year. By then, she was positive, Richard would have had his fill
of travelling, with the varied discomforts it implied, and be
thankful to get back to his own dear home.</p>

<p>Thus it came that "Ultima Thule" was put into an agent's hands,
and Mary fell to sorting and packing and making her preparations
for the long sea voyage. Not the least of these was fitting the
three children out anew from top to toe. Richard had forbidden them
even an armband as mourning for their uncle&mdash;he was never done
railing at Lizzie for having turned John's three into little
walking mountains of bombazine and crepe. So Mary was free to
indulge her love for dainty stuffs and pretty colours. And, thought
she, if ever children paid for dressing hers did. The Dumplings
were by now lovely, fair-haired, blue-eyed three-year-olds, with
serious red mouths and firm chubby legs. They prattled the livelong
day; loved and were loved by every one. Cuffy, dark, slim,
retiring, formed just the right contrast. People often stopped
nurse to ask whose children they were. And on this, their first
excursion into the big world, nobody should be able to say they
were not the best-dressed, best-cared-for children on the ship!</p>

<p>Before, however, a suitable tenant for the house had been
found&mdash;Richard turned up his nose at every one who had so far
looked over it (when it came to the point he was the fastidious one
of the two)&mdash;before anything had been fixed, a note came from
Tilly saying she and Purdy had travelled down from Ballarat
overnight, and were putting up at "Scott's." So after breakfast
Mary on with her bonnet and drove to town.</p>

<p>She found Tilly in a fine sitting-room on the first floor of the
hotel, looking very, very prosperous...all silk and bugles. Purdy
was out, on the business that had brought him to town: "So we two
have all the morning, love, to jaw in." As she spoke, Tilly whipped
off Mary's bonnet and mantle and carried them to the bedroom,
supplying Mary meanwhile with one of her own caps, lest any one
should enter the room and find her with a bare pate. Then, a second
chair having been drawn up for her to put her feet on, a table with
cake and wine set at her elbow, they were free to fall to work.
They had not met since Tilly's wedding; and Mary had now to tell
the whole sad story of John's illness and death, starting from the
night on which he had unexpectedly come to consult Richard, and not
omitting his queer hallucination the day before he died (an
incident she had so far religiously kept from Richard, as only too
likely to encourage his present craze). Next they discussed Lizzie,
her behaviour during John's illness, her attitude to the children
and the birth of her boy&mdash;a peevish, puny infant to whom, much
against her inclination, she thinking the world of her own family
and little of any other, she had been induced to give John's name.
And then John's will, "John's infamous will!" as Richard called it,
by which Lizzie was left sole executrix, and trustee of Emmy and
the little girls' money (five thousand apiece), with free use of
the interest so long as she provided a home for them under her
roof. "Which, as you can see, Tilly, is about as foolish a
condition as the poor fellow could well have made."</p>

<p>Tilly nodded; but suppressed the: "Yes, but oh how like 'im!"
that jumped to her lips, on the principle of not picking holes in
the dead. "But what about if Madam marries again...eh, Mary? How
then?"</p>

<p>Mary nodded ruefully. "Why, then it's the usual thing: she's cut
off with a penny; most of her money goes to the boy; and Richard
and Jerry become trustees in her stead." But, extenuating where
Tilly had suppressed, Mary added: "You must remember the will was
drawn up directly after marriage, when John was still very much in
love."</p>

<p>"Lor', Mary, <i>what</i> a picnic!" said Tilly, and sagely
wagged her head. "My dear, can't you see 'em? Madam, gone sour as
curds, clinging like grim death to 'er posse of old maids! Poor old
Jinn! Poor little kids! Caught like fishes in a net."</p>

<p>"Yes, well, except that...as Richard says...it's very
unlikely..."</p>

<p>Their eyes met.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I suppose it is," said Tilly dryly.</p>

<p>Thence they passed to their own affairs; and Mary told of the
fresh uprootal that was in store for her&mdash;and, over the
telling, let out some of the exasperation that burned in her at the
prospect. Tilly was the one person who would understand what it
meant; to whom she could utter a word of complaint. To the world at
large Richard and she must, and would, always present a united
front.</p>

<p>Said she: "Oh, I <i>did</i> think this time, Tilly, he would be
content; when he'd got everything he could possibly wish for. It
was a different matter him leaving Ballarat&mdash;and I couldn't
blame him myself for not wanting to settle permanently in England.
But here...our nice house...his library...the garden...And the
stupid part of it is I know he'll regret it...tire of being on the
move long before we can get back into the house. I'm making up my
mind to <i>that</i>, before I start."</p>

<p>"Poor old girl! You do have a tough time of it."</p>

<p>"Besides, there are the chicks to think of now as well. Their
father says the voyage will do them good, and he may be right. But
the voyage isn't everything. What about the change of climate for
them while they're so small?&mdash;going over into the cold as we
shall do. Then, travelling isn't the thing for little
children&mdash;you know what an excitable child Cuffy
is.&mdash;Besides, just think what it's going to cost us, with
three servants, renting a furnished house in London, making a tour
of the Continent and all the rest of it. Richard has such grand
notions nowadays. Economy's a word that has ceased to exist for
him. The money's there and it's to be spent, and that's the end of
it. But it does sometimes seem...I mean I can't help feeling it
would be better if I had some idea what we've got and how it
goes."</p>

<p>But having opened her heart thus, Mary came to a stop: there
were things she drew the line at touching on, and though her hearer
was only Tilly. You did not, even to your dearest friend, belabour
the point that your husband was growing old and rusty, stiff in
body and in mind. You locked the knowledge up, with a pang, inside
your own heart. Again, Tilly had always made such game of
spiritualism. Did she now hear that, from an interested inquirer,
Richard had become an out-and-out adherent, accepting as gospel the
rubbish its devotees talked, attending sittings which opened with
prayers and hymns, just as if they were trying to take the place of
going to church&mdash;why, at this, Tilly would certainly tap her
forehead and make significant eyes, imagining goodness only knew
what. So Mary kept a wifely silence.</p>

<p>Besides, it was Tilly's turn now to talk. Tilly had brought a
rare budget of gossip with her from the old home; and no one could
give this in racier, more entertaining fashion than she. Mary
listened and laughed, throwing in a reproving: "Now, <i>really</i>,
Tilly!" at some of the speaker's most daring shots; growing
grave-eyed were the tragedies alluded to that underlay many a
prosperous exterior.</p>

<p>Not till all the old friends had been asked after, did she press
nearer home. "And now, Tilly, how about yourself, my dear? Are
you...has it...come! you know what I mean!"</p>

<p>Tilly laughed out loud. "Indeed and it has, old girl!&mdash;and
no apologies needed. Yes, love, the very best of husbands. But I
was right as rain, Mary, in what I said beforehand&mdash;no
spendthrift as I'm alive! Why, 'e even goes to the other extreme,
love, and holds the purse-strings a bit tighter than yours truly
'as been used to. Though it's not for me to complain, my dear,
considering 'ow he handles money. I'm still a bit dazed by it
myself. A born knack with the shekels, and that's the truth! I
declare to you, old Pa's leavings have almost <i>doubled</i> in
these six months. Purd's got a sort of second-sight, which tells
'im to the minute what o'clock it is. All that was wrong with him,
Mary, was never having enough of the needful to show what 'e was
made of."</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>am</i> glad to hear that&mdash;I am indeed!"</p>

<p>She went home full of the news. "We were both wrong, you
see."</p>

<p>But it would not have been Richard if he hadn't made ironical
remarks. Wait till the bloom was off the grapes, said he, and then
see how the land lay. For, if Purdy had started speculating
already..."Ah, but Tilly says he has a kind of sixth sense for the
ups and downs of the market."</p>

<p>"Many a wife thinks the same, till the crash comes. But you know
<i>my</i> opinion of the national vice."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll be able to judge for yourself. I've asked them to
dinner this evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, deuce take it! Have we really got to have them here?"</p>

<p>"Now, Richard...when Tilly's in town for the first time since
her wedding. Certainly we have. Besides, I know you'll be
interested to see what marriage has done for Purdy."</p>

<p>"Oh Lord, Mary! Am I not at my time of life allowed to know what
interests me and what doesn't?"</p>

<p>"Well, I shan't see Tilly again for ever so long. I do beg you
to be nice to her, dear...to both of them," said Mary.</p>

<p>And when the time came he was...of course he was: with the near
prospect of escape from people, Richard invariably found it easy to
be charming to them. Another thing, she had pandered to his weak
side by preparing a very choice little dinner; and she wore one of
his favourite dresses&mdash;a black velvet gown, with jet
trimmings, cut square at the neck.</p>

<p>But without a doubt, the main reason for his amiability was the
immense improvement that had taken place in Purdy: it was
noticeable even as the latter entered the drawing-room. In
appearance he would, it was true, never be very much, what with his
limp, and so on; and his lack of distinction was doubly remarkable
when Richard was present, who was so slender and
aristocratic-looking. But his aggressiveness had gone; he was no
longer up in arms against the world. Gone, too, was the dreadful
boasting that had so set Richard against him; and he had quite
given over telling tiresome stories...thanks, thought Mary, to
having married one of the most sensible of women. At the single
threatened lapse into his old tone, she distinctly felt Tilly seek
and find his foot beneath the table.</p>

<p>"Didn't I say she'd pull him into shape?" and: "Upon my word,
wife, if ever there was an exploded notion, it is that the
possession of this world's goods makes for evil. Why, there was
actually a trace of his old self about the fellow to-night."</p>

<p>The ormolu clock on the drawing-room mantelpiece had just chimed
eleven. Mary was giving her toes a final toast before retiring,
Richard securing the hasps and bolts of shutters and French
windows.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," agreed Mary; but with an absent air. She was
thinking of Tilly&mdash;dear old Tilly&mdash;in whom the change had
been no less marked. Looking very buxom and rather handsome in
magenta velvet, Tilly had sat smiling broadly, but with less to say
for herself than ever in her life before. Instead of paying
attention to Richard, as she ought to have done, she had all the
time been listening to Purdy, drinking in his words, and signing to
Mary to listen, too, by many a private tilt of the brows. So
palpably eager was she for him to shine that she had been unable to
resist breaking in with a: "Oh, come now, Purd, take a
<i>leetle</i> bit of the credit to yourself!&mdash;it was his doing
really, Mary, and no one else's, though 'e tries now to make out it
was Blake's." And at Purdy's: "Forgive my old woman's dotage, you
two...it's still kissing-time with us, you know!"&mdash;at this
Tilly had smirked and blushed like a sixteen-year-old.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Richard was saying from the hearthrug, where he stood
nursing his coat-tails: "...an interesting chat after you had left
the room, my dear. I was hearing all about the Mitcham case from
within&mdash;the big mining suit, you know, that has created such a
scandal in Ballarat...you must remember old Grenville of Canterbury
Station, his deafness and his expletives, and those enormous black
cigars&mdash;he always had one stuck in the corner of his mouth
when he drove his four-in-hand to town."</p>

<p>"Of course I do. A very kind old gentleman I thought him."</p>

<p>"Yes...he had rather a way with the ladies.&mdash;Well, as I was
saying, this fellow Blake Purdy swears by was one of the partners
in the company formed after old G. had sold his mine&mdash;at a
dead loss, mind you, and on the express advice of his confidential
manager, who, directly after, became a promoter of the new company.
When the output suddenly redoubled and the shares began to soar,
old Grenville, naturally enough, thought he had been done, and sued
them for fraud. The jury could not agree. Now, there's rumour of a
settlement. If it takes place, it is calculated that the shares
will rise in value by two to three hundred per cent. Purdy stands
to make his fortune&mdash;thanks to having some one at his elbow
who is in the swim."</p>

<p>But Mary pursed her lips and looked dubious. "Well, I don't
know, Richard...I must say it sounds to me rather shady."</p>

<p>"Hm...well, myself I prefer to keep clear of that sort of thing.
All the same, Mary, I couldn't help thinking what a terrible
slowcoach old Simmonds is, compared with these modern brokers one
hears of. One never gets any inside information from him&mdash;for
the very good reason that he doesn't know it himself."</p>

<p>"But so honest and trustworthy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there's that about it," said Richard, a trifle
morosely Mary thought.</p>

<p>"And what do you say to the house? Wasn't it a funny thing Purdy
tumbling across some one, like that?" she hastened to add, in an
attempt to divert his mind from old Simmonds's shortcomings.</p>

<p>"A stroke of luck of the first order!"</p>

<p>For amongst other news Purdy had had a titbit for them. Only
that very day, it seemed, in the coffee-room of the hotel, he had
run up against a squatter from Darumbooli who was on the look-out
for a furnished house, standing in its own grounds and not too far
from the sea, where he could settle wife and daughters while the
latter attended a finishing school. Purdy had at once thought of
"Ultima Thule" and extolled its beauties: its lawns and shrubberies
and fruit gardens, its proximity to the sea. The squatter had
pricked up his ears and, if they agreed, would come out to see it
early next morning.</p>

<p>Whereupon the last trace of Mahony's starchedness had melted, in
a glow of gratitude and content.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Mary, it sounds the very thing, at last!"</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-7" id="ch-2-3-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>That night he could not sleep. To begin with, he had been unused
of late to an evening's talk: bits and scraps of it went on buzzing
round his brain, long after he lay abed. Then, something he had
eaten had disagreed with him: Cook's short-crust must have been too
rich, or the pears over-ripe. He tossed and turned, to the
disturbance of poor Mary; tried lying high, lying low, counting
sheep and other silly tricks, all to no purpose: before an hour had
passed, the black thoughts of the night&mdash;those sinister
imaginings born of darkness and immobility&mdash;had him in their
grip.</p>

<p>Their approach was stealthy. For he had gone to bed in high
feather at the prospect of at last securing a tenant. Weeks had
dragged by, and the house was still unlet. He fumed as often as he
thought of it. To put a house like his on the market and get no
offers for it! Sell?...yes; he could have sold three times over.
But the idea of renting a place ready furnished seemed not to enter
the colonial mind. Now, however, if Purdy was to be trusted...A
rich squatter, too...willing no doubt to pay a good price for a
good thing&mdash;though this condition was not, God be thanked, the
<i>sine qua non</i> it would once have been. Still, money was
money; you could not have too much of it...especially here. Give a
man means and you gave him friends and favours, and a rank second
to none. To take a petty instance: what had money not done for the
very person they had had before their eyes that evening? From the
seedy little down-at-heel of a year back, Purdy had been
metamorphosed into...well, at least rendered presentable enough to
bid to your table. Money had restored his shrunken self-respect. It
had also brought out in him talents which not his oldest friends
had guessed at. That Purdy, of all people, should prove a dabster
in the share-market!&mdash;exchange to such good purpose
bar-parlour for "Corner." No doubt the years he had spent
hobnobbing with every variety of individual had sharpened his wits.
You saw something of that in the shrewd choice he had made of a
broker. For, three parts of the game, did you enter the big gamble,
depended on having a wide-awake adviser at your elbow. And this man
Blake, of whom they had heard so much that night, did actually seem
to be one in a thousand.</p>

<p>One in a thousand...one in a thousand...a thousand...Mahony was
on the point of dropping off, to the rhythm of these words, when a
vague uneasiness began to stir in him; more exactly, when he became
abruptly aware that, deep down in him, a nagging anxiety had for
some time been at work. Coming to with a jerk, he sent his thoughts
back over the evening. What was it?...what had happened to prick
him, when all had seemed to go so smoothly? He groped and groped.
Then...ha!...he had it. Simmonds. The name whizzed into his mind
like a dart; like a dart stuck there, and was not to be plucked
out. And no sooner had he found this clue than, with a rush, a
swarm of vexatious thoughts and impressions was upon him. His
apparent good spirits were all humbug; at heart he had been
depressed by the tale of Purdy's successes. They had made him feel
a back number, an old fossil, who had to learn from some one he had
always looked down on as his inferior, what was actually happening
in the financial world. And for this he held Simmonds to blame.
What was the use of a confidential agent who did not keep you up to
the mark?&mdash;Not that he wanted to speculate; or at least not as
the word was here understood. But he wished to feel that he
<i>could</i> have done so, and with as much aplomb as anybody, did
the fit take him. And brooding over the chances he had no doubt
missed and even at this moment might be missing: at a picture of
himself lying high and dry, while one and another&mdash;mere
whipper-snappers like Purdy &mdash;floated easily out to fortune,
an acute irritation mastered him.</p>

<p>He turned his pillow, and, even as he did so, told himself that
the fault had been not Simmonds's, but his own. Yes, the truth was,
he had had no ambition. Otherwise, why have laid his affairs in the
hands of such a humdrum?&mdash;and, what was worse, have left them
there. Honest?&mdash;yes: but so was many a noodle honest: and in
these new countries honesty alone, unbacked by any more worldly
qualities, stood not an earthly chance. And again a vision danced
before his closed lids. He saw the thousands he had failed to
make&mdash;thousands that grew to hundreds of thousands as he
watched&mdash;fluttering just beyond <i>his</i> grasp, though
within easy reach of others. And now, to sting him, the earlier
bitterness returned...in the form of a galling envy. To see Purdy,
the foolish harum-scarum, the confessed failure, the mean little
<i>commis voyageur</i>&mdash;to see such a one about to pass,
surpass him, in means and influence: this was surely one of the
bitterest mouthfuls he had ever had to swallow.</p>

<p>And here, seizing its chance, a further fear insinuated itself.
What if it should not end with this? Simmonds being what he was,
might he not fail in other ways as well?&mdash;let what he already
held slip through his fingers, and he, Mahony, wake one morning to
find himself a poor man? A shiver ran down his spine at the
thought, and he made a feverish movement: he would have liked to
throw off the bedclothes, and go hotfoot to call Simmonds to
account. Since he was condemned to lie like a log, his imagination
did the work for him, running riot in a series of pictures...till
cold drops stood out on his forehead.</p>

<p>Sitting up he fumbled for a handkerchief. The change of position
brought him a moment's calmness. Good Lord, what was he
doing...working himself into such a state. It was like those bad
old times when he had had to worry himself half to death about
money...or the lack of it. He drank a glass of water, and rolled
over on his other side.</p>

<p>Scarcely, however, had his head touched the pillow when he was
off again, stabbed by yet another nightmare thought. What if it
should be a case of fraud on Simmonds's part? Might not the
lethargy, the stolid honesty be but a pose?&mdash;the cloak to
cover a rascally activity? Like the confidential agent whose
double-dealing they had heard of that night, it would be child's
play for Simmonds, just because he appeared so straight and
aboveboard, to fleece his clients&mdash;or at least such among them
as gave him the open chances he, Mahony, had. Careless, distraught,
interested in everything rather than in money, he had ambled along
unthinking as a babe, leaving Simmonds to his own devices for
months, nay, years, at a time. Now, he could not wait for daylight
to get his affairs back into his own hands. If only he were not too
late!&mdash;And thus on and on, ever deeper into the night, his
suspicions growing steadily more sinister, till there was no crime
of which he was not ready to suspect his man of business. A dozen
times he had trapped him, unmasked him, brought him to justice,
before he fell into a feverish doze, in which not Simmonds but
himself was the fugitive, hunted by two monstrous shadow policemen
who believed him criminal before the law. Waking with a terrific
start he pulled himself together, only at once to sink back in
dream. This time, he was being led by Purdy and some one strangely
resembling that bottle-nosed Robinson who had played him a dirty
trick over an English practice, to a cemetery, where stood a
tombstone bearing Simmonds's name. Why, good Lord! the fellow's
dead...dead?...and what of me? "Who's got my money? Where is it?
Where am I?" cried Mahony aloud&mdash;and woke at the sound of his
own voice to see pale lines of light creeping in at the sides of
the windows. His pulse was bounding, Mary sleepily murmuring: "Oh
dear, oh dear, what <i>is</i> the matter?"&mdash;Rising, he opened
a window and stuck his hot head out in the morning air.</p>

<p>At breakfast-time he emerged pale and peevish, to a day that
proved hardly less wearing than the night had been. One, too, that
called for a clear brain and prompt decisions. For the owner of
Darumbooli, Baillie by name, put in an appearance as
arranged&mdash;an elderly Scot, tanned, sun-wrinkled,
grey-whiskered, with a bluff yet urbane manner&mdash;a self-made
man, it was plain, and wholly unlettered, but frank, generous,
honourable: one of nature's gentlemen, in short, and of a type
Mahony invariably found it easy to do business with. Better still,
he turned out to be one of your genuine garden-lovers: as the pair
of them walked the grounds of "Ultima Thule," none of the details
and improvements Mahony felt proudest of but was observed and
bespoken: the white-strawberry bed, the oleander grove, the
fernery, the exquisitely smooth buffalo-grass lawns on which sprays
were kept playing. A good garden was, it seemed, a desideratum with
Baillie. And he fell in love with Mahony's at first sight.</p>

<p>But...yes, yes! now came the fly in the ointment...he wished not
to rent but to buy: had never, he averred, had any idea of renting
a house: it was entirely "that fellow Smith's mistake" ("all
Purdy's muddle!"). The schooling proved another bit of fiction. His
daughters were past their school years; of an age to be launched in
society. Darumbooli was up for sale&mdash;Baillie had already
refused a bid of ninety thousand&mdash;and planned from now on to
settle in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Having thus cleared the air and added that, only the day before,
he had seen a house at Toorak which, though not a patch on this,
would serve his purpose, he offered a sum for "Ultima Thule," just
as it stood, with all its contents, which sent Mahony's eyebrows
half-way up his forehead.</p>

<p>Mary was speechless when she heard the upshot of the interview;
when, too, she saw that Richard's mind&mdash;that mind which seemed
unable to hold fast to any mortal thing for long together&mdash;was
more than three parts made up to accept Baillie's offer. And too
discomfited to meet this Irish fluidity with her usual wily
caution, she no sooner found her voice than she cried: "Oh,
Richard, <i>no!</i>&mdash;that we <i>can't</i> do...we really
can't! Think of all the things we got specially out from home...the
French tapestry...the carpets...and...and everything!"</p>

<p>Tch! now he had this to go through...on top of his bad night,
and his own burning irresolution. His nerves felt like the frayed
ends of a rope. But as usual opposition spurred him on.</p>

<p>"But, my dear, with such a sum at our disposal, we shall be able
to furnish our <i>next</i> house ten times as well. Look here,
Mary, I tell you what we'll do. We'll bring every atom of stuff out
with us, from London or Paris: the very newest of
everything&mdash;there won't be a house in the colony like it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard!...oh, I <i>do</i> think&mdash;" For an instant
bitterness choked Mary. Then, she could not resist pricking him
with a: "And have <i>you</i> decided to let all your books go, as
well?"</p>

<p>"My books? Most certainly not! I made that clear on the
spot.&mdash;But how absurd, Mary! What would a man whose whole life
has been spent among sheep and cattle do with my volumes of physic
and metaphysics?" But Mary put on her obstinate face. "Well, my
things mean just as much to me as yours to you."</p>

<p>"Now for goodness sake, my dear, be reasonable!" cried Richard,
growing excessively heated. "I suppose even a squatter can use a
chair or a sofa; needs a bed and a table; but what, I ask you,
would he make of Lavater?...or the Church Fathers?"</p>

<p>"It's always the same. I'm to give up everything, you
nothing.&mdash;But if my wishes and feelings can be trampled on,
don't you care about the children?...I mean about them all having
been born here?"</p>

<p>"Indeed and I do not! I would no more have them tie their
feelings to the shell of a house than I'd have mourners hang round
a grave."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no talking to you nowadays, your head's so full of
windy stuff. But I tell you this, Richard, I refuse to have my
children dragged from place to place...as I've been. It's not as if
it's ever helped a bit either, our giving up home after home.
You're always wild, at the moment, to get away, but afterwards
you're no happier than you were before. And then, what makes me so
angry, you let yourself be influenced by such silly, trivial
things. I believe you're ready to sell this house just because you
<i>like</i> the man who wants to buy it, or because he's praised up
the garden. But you'll be sorry for it, I know you will, before
three months are out. I haven't lived with you all these years for
nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh well, my dear," said Mahony darkly, "I'm an old man now, and
you won't be troubled with me much longer. When I'm gone you'll be
able to do just as you please."</p>

<p>Mary's black eyes flashed, and her lips opened to a sharp
retort; then she snapped them to, and said nothing. For to this
there could be no real reply; and Richard knew it.</p>

<p>The bargain struck&mdash;for struck of course it was, as she had
seen from the first it would be: thereafter it only remained for
Mary to apply her age-old remedy, and make the best of a very bad
job. But the present was by so much the most unreasonable thing
Richard had ever done, and she herself felt so sore and exasperated
over it, that not for several days was she cool enough to discuss
the matter with him. Then, however, each coming half-way to meet
the other, they had a long talk, in the course of which Mahony
sought to make amends by letting her into some of his money
secrets, and she extracted a solemn promise that, except for a mere
fringe&mdash;a couple of thousand, say, for travelling and other
immediate expenses&mdash;the sum he was receiving (it ran to five
figures) should be kept for the purpose of setting them up anew on
their return to the colony. Mahony bade her make her mind easy.
They ought to be able to live as comfortably on their dividends in
England, as here; and the price paid for "Ultima Thule" should be
faithfully laid by for the purpose of building, when they came
back, the house that would form their permanent home. "For by then
my travelling days will be over. We'll plan it together, love,
every inch of it; and it will be more our own than any house we've
lived in."</p>

<p>"Yes, I dare say." But Mary's tone lacked warmth, was rich in
incredulity.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-8" id="ch-2-3-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>And now for Simmonds.</p>

<p>As he made ready to go to town Mahony recalled, with a smile,
his grotesque imaginings of two nights back. What a little hell the
mind could create for a man's undoing! But none the less, though he
now ridiculed them, his nightmares had left a kind of tingling
disquietude in their train. He felt he would do well to have a
straight talk with Simmonds, go carefully through his share-list,
and arrange in detail for the conduct of his affairs during his
absence.</p>

<p>He went off jauntily enough. "Don't expect me till about
six."</p>

<p>But not a couple of hours later, as Mary was on her knees before
a drawer of the great wardrobe she was beginning to dismantle, she
heard his foot on the verandah, and the next moment his voice,
sharp, querulent, distracted, cried: "Mary! Mary, where are
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear? I'm coming. Why, Richard, whatever is wrong now?"
For with a despairing gesture Mahony had tossed his hat on the
hall-table, and himself dropped heavily on a chair.</p>

<p>"You may well ask. Here's a pretty kettle of fish! It's all over
now with our getting away."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? But not here. The servants...Come into the
bedroom. Well, you do look hot and tired."</p>

<p>She brought him a glass of water, and while he sat and sipped
this, she listened to his story; listened, and put two and two
together. Arrived at his agent's office in Great Bourke Street, he
had found to his surprise and annoyance that Simmonds was absent
from business. Worse still, had been, for over two months. He was
ill, bedridden&mdash;yes, seriously ill. "Confound the fellow! I
believe he means to die, just to inconvenience me. Mary! my dream
the other night...it flashed across me as I walked home. Depend
upon it, one doesn't dream that kind of thing for nothing."
Richard's tone was full of gloomiest foreboding.</p>

<p>"What nonsense, dear! How can you be so silly!"</p>

<p>In place of Simmonds he had been met by a...well, by a sort of
clerk, who was in charge&mdash;at least he presumed so: he had
never set eyes on the fellow before, and never meant to again, if
he could help it! "To find a par to his behaviour, Mary, you would
need to go back to the early days, when every scoundrelly Tom, Dick
and Harry thought himself your equal."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>Say? Well, first, it was plain to Mary, he had not known from
Adam who Richard was. Without getting up from his chair, not
troubling to take his head out of a newspaper, he had asked the
intruder's pleasure in the free-and-easy colonial fashion which,
long as he had lived there, Richard had never learned to swallow.
Besides, not to be recognised in a place he honoured with his
patronage was in itself a source of offence. Haughtily presenting
his card (which, she could see, had lamentably failed to produce an
effect), he demanded to speak to Simmonds, with whom he had
important business.</p>

<p>"Pray, what answer do you think I got? In a voice, my dear, the
twang of which you could have cut with a knife, I was informed:
'Well, in that case, doc., I guess you'll have to keep it
snug&mdash;locked up in your own bosom, so to say! For the boss
lies sick abed, and all the business in the world wouldn't get him
up from it.' Whereupon I clapped on my hat and walked out of the
place! In which, as long as Simmonds is away, I shall not set foot
again. But now, as you can see, we're in a pretty fix. All our
plans knocked on the head! The house sold, the agreement
signed&mdash;or as good as signed...it's utterly impossible to draw
back. Why the deuce was I in such a hurry? We shall have to go into
apartments, Mary&mdash;take the children into common lodgings. Good
God! Such a thing is not to be contemplated for a moment."</p>

<p>Mary let him talk; listened to this and much more before she
threw in a mild: "We'll take a furnished house. There'd be nothing
common about that.&mdash;All the same, I don't believe Simmonds,
who has always been so straight, would put any one in to look after
things who wasn't honest, too&mdash;in spite of uncouth behaviour.
And you can't refuse to deal with a person just because he has no
manners...and doesn't know how to address you."</p>

<p>"My dear Mary, it has been a one-man show all these years; and
the probability is, when the old fellow broke down he had no one to
turn to. But I can assure you, if I left my investments in such
hands I shouldn't know a moment's peace all the time I was away.
Besides, if he does die, the whole concern will probably go
smash."</p>

<p>Oh, the fuss and the flutter! As if it wasn't bad enough to have
your house sold over your head, without this fresh commotion on top
of it. There must surely be something very slipshod and
muddle-headed about the way Richard managed his affairs. She didn't
say so, but, had she been in his shoes, she would have known long
ago of Simmonds's illness. As it was, this clerk might have been
cheating the clients right and left. But anything to do with money
(except, of course, the spending of it!) had of late years become
anathema to Richard.</p>

<p>Now he went about with a hand pressed to an aching head; and
after putting up with this for some days and herself feeling wholly
at a loss, Mary made a private journey to town to visit Tilly. She
would see what that practical, sagacious woman thought of the
situation. Tilly, of course, at once laid her finger on the weak
spot by asking bluntly: "But whyever doesn't the doctor take advice
of some of 'is friends?&mdash;the big-bow-wow ones, I mean. They'd
be able to tell 'im, right enough."</p>

<p>"Why, the fact is, Richard hasn't got...I mean his friends are
not business men, any more than he is. If only John were alive!
He'd have been the one."</p>

<p>"Well, look here, Poll, I can ask Purd about it if you like. He
may know, and if e doesn't, 'e can easily find out&mdash;I mean
whether old S. is really going to hop the twig or what. Purd has
strings 'e can pull."</p>

<p>Mary went home intending to keep silence about her
intermeddling&mdash;at any rate till she saw what came of it. But
Richard was regularly in the doldrums: he had to be comforted
somehow. At first, as she had expected, he was furious; and abused
her like a pickpocket for discussing his private affairs with an
outsider. "You <i>know</i> how I hate publicity! As for telling
them in that quarter...why, I might as well go out and shout them
from the housetop."</p>

<p>"Richard...you can't afford...if you re really set on getting
away...to mind now who knows and who doesn't."</p>

<p>But on this point, as always, they joined issue. He accused her
of lacking personal dignity; she said that his ridiculous secrecy
over money matters would end by leading people to believe there was
something fishy about them.</p>

<p>"Let them! What does it matter to me what they think?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know anyone who'd resent it <i>more</i>&mdash;so
proud and touchy as you are! And since home truths were the order
of the day," she added: "You know, dear, its just this: you've only
yourself to thank for the fix you're in. You've cut yourself off
from every one, and now, when you need help, you haven't a soul to
turn to. And because I have, and make use of them, then your
pride's hurt."</p>

<p>Which was the very truth. He had let slip friends and
acquaintances who at this juncture might have been useful to him;
but...could one nurse people, the inner impulse to friendship
failing, solely from motives of opportunism? The idea revolted him.
True, also, was what she said about the damage to his pride. Not,
however, because they were <i>her</i> friends as she supposed, but
because they were the friends they were. Again, he shrank in
advance from the silly figure he was going to cut, did the story
get about town how he had sold his house and packed his
portmanteaux, while, all unknown to him, the chief spoke in his
wheel had collapsed. What a fool he would look! Though the fact
was, Simmonds had handled his affairs without supervision for so
long, that he had come to look on the fellow as a kind of fixture
in his life.</p>

<p>And, in spite of everything, his determination to get away did
not weaken. In mind, he had already started&mdash;was out on the
high seas. Impossible now to call his thoughts home. And the
feeling that such a course might be expected of him&mdash;that Mary
would expect it&mdash;only served to throw him into a frenzy of
impatience; make him more blackly intolerant of each fresh obstacle
that blocked his path.</p>

<p>Then Tilly appeared: he saw her from the window, all furbelows
and flounces, and wearing an air at once important and mysterious.
She and Mary retired to the drawing-room; and there he could hear
them jabbering, discussing <i>him</i> and his concerns, as he sat
pretending to read. This went on and on&mdash;would they never end?
Even when plainer tones, and the opening and shutting of doors
seemed to herald Tilly's departure, all that followed was a sheerly
endless conversation on the step of the verandah. By the time Mary
came in to him, he was nervily a-shake. And her news was as bad as
it could be. Old Simmonds was doomed; was in the last stages of
Bright's disease; his place of business would know him no more.
Most of his clients had already transferred to other agents; and
Purdy's advice to Richard was, to lose no time in following their
example.</p>

<p>"Huh! All very well...very easily said! But to whom am I to
turn, I'd like to know?...when there isn't one honest broker in a
thousand. Swindlers&mdash;damned swindlers!&mdash;that's what they
are, every man-jack of 'em. And here am I, just going out of the
colony, and with all this fresh money to invest."</p>

<p>Said Mary: "I've been thinking" (which, of course, meant
tittle-tattling with Tilly), "why not write to Mr. Henry and
consult him? He's such a good business man, and knows so many
people. He might be able to recommend some one to you." But with
this suggestion she only added fuel to the inordinate, unreasonable
grudge which Richard still bore every one connected with the old
life. "Nothing would induce me!...to eat humble pie before that
crew!"</p>

<p>"Well then, <i>do</i> let us postpone our journey...if only for
six months."</p>

<p>He was equally stubborn. "Sooner than that&mdash;if it comes to
that!&mdash;I'll sell right out and take every penny I possess to
the other side. And never set foot in the colony again."</p>

<p>"Now, for goodness sake, Richard!..." cried Mary; then bit her
lip. He was quite capable of carrying out his threat, did she make
the least show of opposition.</p>

<p>However, on this occasion his rashness took another form. After
spending the whole of the next day in town, where he had gone to
visit his banker, to settle with his wine merchant, arrange for the
storing of his books and so on, he came home to dinner looking a
different man. On her, who had gone about all day with a crease
between her brows, not knowing whether to pack for a voyage or for
the removal to another house, he burst in, and catching her by the
waist kissed her and swung her round. "Here's your bear come home.
But cheer up, Mary, cheer up, my love, and make your mind easy! All
will yet be well."</p>

<p>"What? Do you mean to say you've actually&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank the Lord, I have!"</p>

<p>Over the dinner-table he gave her particulars. At the end of a
bothersome, wasted morning he had dropped into "Scott's," and
there, in the coffee-room, had tumbled across Purdy.
("What!&mdash;<i>Purdy?</i>" was Mary's amazed inner comment, she
being as usual hard at work drawing inferences.) Purdy had met him
in friendliest fashion: "I've come to the conclusion, my dear, I've
sometimes been rather hard on the boy of late." They had lunched
together, over a chop and a bottle of claret had got talking, and
had sat for the better part of an hour. Naturally the subject of
Simmonds's collapse had come up, and the fix it had put him into.
Purdy&mdash;"'Pon my word, Mary, I saw to-day he's got his head
screwed on the right way!"&mdash;had given him various useful tips
how to deal with the modern broker, which an innocent old sheep
like himself would never have dreamt of. And then just at the end,
as they were making a move, Purdy had scratched his head and
believed he knew some one who might&mdash; "<i>Not</i> Blake?"</p>

<p>"Blake? Absurd! Good Lord, no!...Blake needs watching." (Richard
knew all about it to-night.) No, no: this was no flashy dare-devil,
but a steady-going, cautious sort of fellow, who could be trusted
to "look after your interests during your absence, and transmit
<i>the</i> interest...ha, ha!&mdash;Oh, and I must tell you this,
Mary. When he said&mdash;Purdy, I mean&mdash;'I believe I know some
one who'd suit you, Dick,' where do you suppose my thoughts flew?
They went back, love, to a day more years ago than I care to count,
when he used the self-same words. We were riding to Geelong
together, he and I, two carefree young
men&mdash;heigh-ho!&mdash;and not many hours after, I had the
honour of meeting a certain young lady...Well, wife, if this
introduction turns out but half as well as that, I shall have no
cause to complain. Anyway, I took it as a good omen. We hadn't time
then to go further into the matter; but I am to meet him again
to-morrow and hear all details."</p>

<p>He rattled on in the highest spirits, seeing everything fixed
and settled; and Mary had not the heart to damp him by putting
inconvenient, practical questions. And having said his say and
refilled her glass and his own, he sent for the children&mdash;they
had been hushed back into the nursery for the past three days,
while Papa had a headache. Now, setting his girlies on his knees,
with Cuffy standing before him, he told the trio of the big ship
that was coming to take them away, and on which they were to
live&mdash;for weeks, and weeks, and weeks to come.</p>

<p>The Dumplings' eyes grew round. "An' s'all us 'ave bekspup on ze
big s'ip?" asked Lallie, the elder of the twins.</p>

<p>"Bekspup on ze big s'ip?" echoed her sister.</p>

<p>"Breakfast <i>and</i> dinner, <i>and</i> tea, and go to sleep in
little beds like boxes built on to the wall, and look out of little
windows just big enough for your little heads, and see nothing,
wherever you look, but the great, wide sea."</p>

<p>"Ooo! Bekfast, <i>an'</i> dinner, <i>an'</i> tea!"&mdash;Cuffy
had to cut a few capers about the room to let off steam, before he
could listen to more.</p>

<p>Mary took no part in the merry chatter. And when Nannan had
fetched the children, she abruptly came back to the subject of her
thoughts. "Of course you'll see this person Purdy speaks of, see
what you think of him yourself, before actually deciding on
anything?"</p>

<p>"Of <i>course</i>, my dear, of course!"</p>

<p>"It seems rather...I mean, it seems strange Purdy didn't...And
as he is doing the recommending, I can't very well ask Tilly's
opinion."</p>

<p>"And who wants you to? I'll be very much obliged if you
<i>don't</i> interfere! Surely, Mary, I can be trusted to attend to
some of my own business? I'm not quite on the shelf yet, I
hope?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Richard. After all...I mean it's not so very long ago
and nothing would have induced you to take Purdy's advice."</p>

<p>"And pray who was it brought home glowing tales of how
splendidly he had got on, thanks to his acuteness and financial
genius, etc., etc., etc.?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But still..."</p>

<p>"But as soon as I come into it, or because I come into it, you
lose every atom of faith. I wonder if all wives are as distrustful
of their husbands' capabilities. A bad look-out for them if they
are."</p>

<p>Mary did not deny the charge. Doubtful she was, and doubtful she
remained: an attitude of mind that severely tried Mahony's temper,
he having more than one private scruple of his own.</p>

<p>For his second meeting with Purdy, in which he had planned to be
very cautious and to throw out wily feelers, was a failure. On
getting to the hotel he found that Purdy could spare him but a few
moments, himself having an urgent appointment to keep. They did not
sit down, and their talk was scampered through at lightning speed.
However, Purdy supplied him with a list of people for whom this man
Wilding had acted &mdash;well-known names they were too!&mdash;and
himself undertook to put in a word on Mahony's behalf. In the
meantime it would be as well for him to write and summon Wilding to
town.&mdash;Write? Yes; for now it turned out that Wilding's
business was carried on, not in Melbourne but in Ballarat. Purdy
vowed he had mentioned this fact the day before; but if so, Mahony
had failed to hear him. Not that it mattered much, seeing that he
himself was about to leave Melbourne. It might even, he agreed, the
majority of his investments being in Ballarat mines, prove a
benefit to have an agent who was on the spot.</p>

<p>Still, the conversation left him visibly less jubilant. While
from the interview he had some days later with Wilding himself, he
returned tired and headachy&mdash;always a bad sign where Richard
was concerned. He met Mary with a: "Well, my dear, all our troubles
are now over!"&mdash;which was true in so far as the business side
of the affair had gone off smoothly. The transfer had been
effected, power of attorney given, new investments arranged for,
his existing share-list overhauled and revised. But...well, he had
not been very favourably impressed by the man himself. He could
find no likeness in him to the portrait drawn by Purdy&mdash;and
probably amplified by his own mind, which looked for a second
Simmonds&mdash;of a staid and dignified man of affairs. No, Wilding
was again one of your rough diamonds: over-familiar, slangy, a
back-slapper, and, like every one else here, in a tearing hurry: he
hardly bothered to listen to what you said, knew everything you
were going to say beforehand, and better than you. His appearance,
too, was against him&mdash;at least to one who set store by the
fleshly screen. Wilding had a small, oblique eye; fat, pursed lips;
fat, grubby fingers on which flashy rings twinkled; a diamond pin
that took your breath away. Also, from an injudicious word he let
drop, the idea leapt at Mahony...well, it might be pure fancy on
his part...or owing to these unlovely looks...besides it was only a
fleeting impression...vaguely troubling. But come! it would not do
to let a personal antipathy to the man's appearance prejudice you
against him...as Mary was never tired of preaching. What though
Wilding was no beauty? Whose hands here <i>were</i> impeccably
clean? Was this not just the type of your modern broker, as
compared with one of the old school? The main thing, the only thing
that really mattered was that he should prove alert and up-to-date.
And in this respect his credentials were of the first water. What
was more, it leaked out, in something he said, that Purdy had
already been in correspondence with him over the affair. Might one
not safely assume a hint on Purdy's part that he himself meant to
keep an eye on things, during his friend's absence from the
colony?</p>

<p>And now, at last, nothing stood in the way of their departure;
and preparations were rushed forward that they might sail by the
vessel of their choice. Mahony superintended the sorting and
packing of his books, and saw them carted to a depository; then
rearranged the furniture and bought fresh pieces to fill the bare
walls where the bookcases had stood. Next he conveyed the
luggage&mdash;it filled a lorry&mdash;to the wharf, saw it aboard
and stowed away between hold and cabins. Of these, they had three
of the largest amidships; and the best warehouse in Melbourne had
carpeted, furnished, curtained them. No need, this time, for Mary
to toil and slave. Like a queen she had only to step aboard and
take possession.</p>

<p>They spent the last couple of days at an hotel. And one morning,
having received word overnight that the <i>Atrata</i> was ready to
sail, they packed into two landaus and were driven to William's
Town. There they found a pretty crowd assembled. Everybody they
knew, or had ever met, had turned out to see them off, headed by
dear old Sir Jake and Lady Devine, the Bishop and Mrs. Moreton,
Baron von Krause the famous botanist, old Judge Barmore and many
another, not to speak of Mary's intimate personal friends,
Richard's spiritualist circle, relatives and members of the family.
For a full half-hour they were hard at it, shaking hands and
exchanging greetings and farewells. Richard, in his new travelling
rig, spruce from top to toe, was urbanity itself: as indeed how
should he fail to be when, within cooee, rode the good ship that
was to carry him off? There was also a generous sprinkling of
children present, the colonial youngster never being denied the
chance of an outing. And to Cuffy, standing stiff and important in
red gloves and a tasselled sash, came Cousin Josephine to hiss in
his ear: "Ooo...aren't I glad I'M not going? Our servant, Mawy Ann,
says you'll pwobably <i>all</i> go to the bottom of the sea!" and
then to laugh maliciously at Cuffy's chalk-white face.</p>

<p>Rowed on board, they found the cabins hardly big enough to house
the masses of flowers that had been deposited in them&mdash;great
stately bouquets in lace or silver holders; lavish sprays; purple
and white arrangements shaped like anchors and inscribed "For
remembrance." And beside the flowers were piled cases of fruit and
delicacies, as well as other more endurable keepsakes: scent, and
fans, and cushions, and books. Nor were the children forgotten.
Over-excited, the despair of their nurses, Cuffy and his sisters
rushed to and fro, their arms full of wonderful new toys.</p>

<p>Said Mary in tears: "I think they're the dearest, kindest people
in all the world."</p>

<p>The last to leave the ship were Jerry, Tilly and Emmy. Emmy,
looking lovely as ever in her deep, becoming mourning, broke down
over the parting and cried bitterly. Mary&mdash;and Richard
too&mdash;would have liked to take the girl with them; both as a
companion for Mary, and in order that foreign travel might give a
fitting polish to John's eldest daughter. But Lizzie vehemently
opposed the plan. Nor was Emmy's own heart in it. For, since John's
death, she had taken upon herself the entire charge of her little
brother, heaping on his infant head all the love that had once been
her father's. Hence she could not tear herself away.</p>

<p>Jerry, a bank manager now, the father of a family, and hailing
from the township of Bummaroo, had stayed the night with them at
their hotel; and, John being no more, Mary had seized this chance
of unburdening herself to her staid, younger brother, of some of
the doubts that haunted her with regard to Richard's present
flighty management of his affairs. Bummaroo was not very far from
Ballarat; and Jerry promised indirectly to find out and keep her
informed of what was going on. "Don't worry, old girl. I can easily
run over from time to time and see how the land lies."</p>

<p>Tilly sat on the edge of a bunk and was very down in the mouth.
"Upon my word, Poll, I seem to feel it more this time than
last&mdash;which is just what a silly old Noah's Ark like me
<i>would</i> do, considering it was for always then, and here
you'll be back before the kids 'ave cut their second teeth."</p>

<p>But the last bell went; the ship was cleared, the ladder hauled
up; and all the din and bustle of weighing anchor began. The wind
being favourable, the Captain undertook to reach the "Heads" before
night; and he was as good as his word. They made a record voyage
down the Bay; and, catching the tide before it turned, headed
straight for the Bight. Mahony, in his old sea-mood of rare
expansiveness, went below to announce their whereabouts. But by
now, thanks to a freshening wind and the criss-cross motion of the
ship, all was confusion in the cabins. The Dumplings, very sick,
were being hurriedly undressed; Mary and the nurses staggered
about, their hands to their dizzy heads. Cuffy alone was
unconcerned: his father found him playing in the saloon, twirling
to and fro on one of the revolving chairs. Here was a chip of the
old block! Wrapping the child in a rug he bore him aloft, to watch
the passage through the "Rip."</p>

<p>Perched on a capstan, Cuffy followed the proceedings with a
lively interest, and to a running fire of questions. Why was the
sea so white and bubbly? Where was it running away to? What were
reefs? Why were light-houses? Why was a pilot? <i>How</i> did he
know? Why did he have such a big boat all to himself? Why didn't he
have a staircase? Did he have his own skin on under the oil? When
was the sea <i>shut?</i>...and many another. But gradually the
little voice ceased its piping and a silence fell&mdash;unnoticed
by Mahony, who himself was carried away once more by a splendid
inner exultation, at dancing in the open, leaving land behind. He
stood lost in his own feelings, till suddenly he felt the little
body his arm enclosed give a great shiver.</p>

<p>He looked down. "What is it, dear? Are you cold?"</p>

<p>But Cuffy just nestled closer into the crook of his father's arm
and did not reply. He had no words at his disposal to tell what he
felt at sight of nightfall on these wild, grey, desolate seas. Nor
did he dare to resolve the more actual fear of Cousin Josey's
implanting, and put the question that burned on his lips: "How far
is it to the bottom?"...For perhaps Papa did not know that was
where they were all sure to go.</p>

<p>"Come, it's long past bedtime."&mdash;And lifting the child from
his perch, Mahony carried him below.</p>

<p>In the gloom of the cabin the hanging-lamp swayed from side to
side, with a slow, rhythmical movement; timbers creaked and
groaned; from the pantries came the noise of shifting, slithering
china&mdash;sounds that were as music in Mahony's cars, telling as
they did of a voyage begun.</p>

<p>Mary turned a feeble head.</p>

<p>"Where <i>have</i> you been? The child will be perished. Well,
you'll have to see to him yourself now. We're all much too
ill."</p>

<p>And thereafter, between convulsive fits of retching, she heard
from the cabin opposite, where Mahony was undoing little buttons
and untying tapes, the voices of father and son raised in
unison:</p>

<p>Rocked in the cradle of the deep,<br>
I lay me down...in peace to sleep.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-9" id="ch-2-3-9"></a>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>The house they took for the winter was in Kensington Gore, and
the children walked every day with their nurses in Kensington
Gardens. When first they arrived, the great trees, with branches
that grew almost low enough to be pulled (if you jumped), were
thick with leaves, and shady like houses. Then the leaves tumbled
off and lay on the ground, and, when Nannan didn't see you, you
shuffled your feet through them, kicking up a dust and making a
noise like crackly paper. Afterwards, men brought brooms and swept
the leaves into heaps and burned them in little bonfires; and then
what fun it was to run like blind men, with eyes tight shut,
through the clouds of smoke. You trundled your hoop up and down
these paths, but didn't go far away, because you couldn't see where
they ended for mist; and Nannan said you might get lost, or fall
into a round pond. And one day a strange, thick, yellow mist came
down, and hid even the path you were walking on, and made your
throat tickle and your eyes sting; and Nannan and Eliza, talking
about pea-soup, rushed for home, feeling frightened, big as they
were, and having to be helped across the road by a policeman, who
made light with what Eliza said was a "bull's-eye."</p>

<p>After this, Cuffy got a cough and had to take tablespoonfuls of
cod-liver oil, and to stay indoors while the Dumplings walked. It
was dull work. The nursery was so high up that you couldn't see
anybody but trees from the windows, which were barred; and you were
not allowed to look out at all, if they were open. Nannan said
looking over made her poor old head dizzy; and she lived in fear of
seeing one of them "land on the pavement." So Cuffy hammered with
his knuckles on the panes, making tunes for himself, or beat them
out on his drum or xylophone, till Nannan, sewing by the fire, said
her poor old head was like to split.</p>

<p>Cuffy gave her his gravest attention. "Are you so <i>very</i>
old, Nannan?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, not so very," said Nannan with a queer laugh: she was
buxom, and in her prime.</p>

<p>"How old?"</p>

<p>"As old as my tongue and a little older than my teeth," was the
cryptic reply, which, far from ending the conversation, led on
through a tangle of question and answer&mdash;why tongues grew
before teeth, what made teeth, where they came from&mdash;to the
eternal wonder: "Was I born, too?" and "How?"</p>

<p>"A caution, that child, if ever there was one!" said Nannan, in
relating this "poser" and how she had queered it&mdash;"Only
<i>naughty</i> little boys ask things like that, Master
Cuffy!"&mdash;to Eliza and Ann over tea. This was drunk in a kind
of cubby-hole off the night nursery, the three colonials having
failed to fraternise with the posse of English servants who had
been taken over with the house: a set of prim, starched pokers
these, ran the verdict; and deceitful, too, with their "sirs" and
"madams" to your face, and all the sneery backbiting that went on
below-stairs.</p>

<p>In regard to Cuffy, however, Nannan's opinion was general: an
awkward child to deal with. You never knew what fresh fad was going
to get the whiphand of him. For instance his first fear, of Cousin
Josey's suggesting that they would all be drowned, which had preyed
on him during the voyage: this allayed, he was haunted by the dread
of being lost, or at least overlooked&mdash;like a bag or an
umbrella&mdash;in this great, strange, bewildering place. Even at
the pantomime at Drury Lane, he suffered torments lest, when it was
over, Nannan and Eliza should suddenly forget that he and the
Dumplings were there and go home without them; and from the close
of the first scene on, he inquired regularly every few minutes
throughout the afternoon: "Is this the end?" till Nannan's patience
gave way, and she roundly declared that never would she bring him
to a theatre again. It was the same at Madame Tussaud's&mdash;the
same, plus an antipathy that amounted to a horror of all these
waxen people with their fixed, glassy eyes; and a fantastic fear
that he might be mistaken for one of them and locked in among them,
did he not keep perpetually on the move. His hot little hand tugged
mercilessly at Eliza's baggy glove. Yes! more bother than half a
dozen children put together. Just a walking bundle, said Nannan, of
whims and crotchets.</p>

<p>Chief of these, and most tiresome of all, was the idea that he
could not&mdash;or must not&mdash;sleep of a night, as long as his
father and mother were out. Did they attend an evening party, he
tossed restless till their return. And if in spite of himself he
dozed off, it was only to start up with the cry: "Is my Papa and
Mamma come home yet?" Nannan was at her wits' end what to do with
him; and more than once boldly transgressed her instructions about
absolute truth in the nursery. For it was not as if Master Cuffy
really wanted his parents, or even wanted to see them. No sooner
did he know they were back, under the same roof with him again,
than he turned over and slept like a top.</p>

<p>The mischief was: they were out almost every night. For, in
violent contrast to the hermit's life he had been leading, Mahony
was now never happy unless he was on the go. An itch for
distraction plagued him; books and solitude had lost their charm;
and an evening spent in his own society, in this large, dark,
heavily furnished house, sent his spirits down to zero. They had
brought many an excellent letter of introduction with them; a
carriage-and-pair stood at their disposal; and so, except for an
occasional party of their own, they went out night after night, to
dinners, balls and card-parties; to soirees, conversaziones and
lectures; to concerts and plays. They heard Tietjens sing, and
Nilsson, and Ilma di Murska; Adelina Patti with Nicolini; and a
host of lesser stars. Richard said they must make the most of their
time; since it was unlikely they would ever be on this side of the
world again. To which, however, Mary now secretly demurred: or not
till the children are grown up. For, though foreign travel meant
little to her, she was already determined that her children should
not miss it&mdash;it, or anything else in life that was worth
having.</p>

<p>In the beginning, she was heartily glad of the change in
Richard's habits, and followed him without a grumble wherever he
wished: he wouldn't budge a step without her. But, as week after
week went by, she did occasionally long for an hour to herself; to
prowl round the shops; see something of the children; write her
letters in peace. As things stood, it was a ceaseless rush from one
entertainment to another, not to mention all the dressing and
re-dressing this implied. Done, too, with Richard standing
irritable and impatient in the hall, watch in hand, calling: "Now
<i>do</i> come along, Mary!&mdash;can't you hear, my dear? We shall
certainly be late."</p>

<p>She comforted herself with the thought that it was not for long:
they had taken the house only for a twelvemonth; and there was
talk, as soon as the weather improved, of a trip to Ireland to see
Richard's sisters, and to the Midlands to visit Lisby, now
Headmistress of a Young Ladies' Seminary. So, in the meantime, Mary
went without her tea to sit through interminable political debates;
or struggled to keep her eyes open at meetings of learned
societies, where old greybeards droned on by the hour, without you
being able to hear the half of what they said. "I suppose it does
<i>somebody</i> some good!" thought she. Richard, for instance, who
had read so many clever books and enjoyed teasing his brains.
Herself, she felt a very fish out of water.</p>

<p>Nowhere more so than at the spiritualist seances, which, for
peace' sake&mdash;and also because everybody was doing it&mdash;she
now regularly attended. London was permeated with spiritualism; you
hardly met a person who was not a convert to the craze. The famous
medium Home had already retired, on his marriage, into private
life, much to Richard's disappointment, but he had left scores of
imitators behind, who were only too well versed in his tricks and
stratagems. The miracles you could see performed! Through the
ceiling came apports of fresh flowers with the dew on them, or
roots with the soil still clinging; great dinner-tables rose from
the floor; lights flitted; apparitions appeared, spoke to you, took
you by the hand. But nothing that happened could shake Mary's
convinced unbelief. She was of those who maintained that so-called
"levitation" was achieved by standing on your toes; the "fire-test"
by your having previously applied chemicals to the palm of your
hand; while the spirits that walked about were just so much drapery
on a broomstick. And it invariably riled her anew, to see Richard
sitting solemnly accepting all this nonsense as if it heralded a
new revelation. Of course, many clever men besides him were the
dupes of their own imagination. Learning and common sense did not
seem to go together. <i>She</i> preferred, thank you, to trust the
evidence of her own eyes and ears.</p>

<p>However, she kept these thoughts to herself, patiently doing all
that was required of her in the way of linking hands in dark rooms,
hymn-singing and the rest, with only an occasional silent chuckle
at the antics of the believers. But then came an evening when
circumstances forced her hand. Well, yes...that was partly true.
They were at a sitting with a medium of whom she had long had her
doubts; and, on this night, the evidence for fraud seemed to her so
glaring that she determined to put it to the test. For once,
Richard was not beside her. Instead, on her right, she had a lady
who fell into raptures at each fresh proof of the "dear spirits'"
presence. Stealthily bringing her two hands together (as Tilly had
long ago instructed her), Mary freed one from this person's hold;
and, when "spirit-touches" were again proclaimed by her neighbour
(they never visited <i>her!</i>) she made a grab, and just as she
expected, found the medium easily recognisable by her
bulk&mdash;crouched on her knees inside the circle, with a long
feather whisk in her hand. In the dark, and in utter silence, a
struggle went on between them, she holding fast, the medium
wriggling this way and that, and ultimately, by lying almost flat
on the floor, contriving to wrench herself free. Not a word did
Mary say. But at the end, when the lights were turned up, it was
announced that the "spirits" complained of an unsympathetic
presence in the circle; and after some hocus-pocus with
slate-writing, etc., she, Mary, was designated and asked to
withdraw.</p>

<p>Richard, pale and extremely haughty, made the best of the
situation in face of all these strangers, none of whom but eyed
Mary as if she were a moral pariah. Inwardly he was raging; and he
freely vented his anger in the carriage going home.</p>

<p>"There you have it! Your mulish obstinacy...your intolerable
lack of imagination...your narrow, preconceived notions of what can
and cannot happen!" Till Mary, too, lost her temper, and blurted
out the plain facts of the case. "I knew her by her figure. What's
more, I distinctly felt the big wart she has on the side of her
chin."</p>

<p>But with this, it seemed, she merely displayed her ignorance.
For the spirit body, in manifestation, was but the ethereal shadow
cast by the physical, and its perfect duplicate. Richard also went
on to crush her with St. Paul's "terrestrial and celestial";
harangued her on the astounding knowledge of the occult possessed
by the early Christians. It was no good talking. Everything she
said could be turned against her.</p>

<p>As she brushed her hair for the night, however, she could not
resist remarking, in a final tone: "Well! all I know is, if these
really <i>are</i> spirits who come back, it doesn't make me think
much of heaven. That the dead can still take an interest in such
silly, footling things!"</p>

<p>"Quite so, my dear. You keep your traditional fancy picture of
semi-birds and harps and crowns. It best suits a mind like yours to
make its heaven as remote and unreal as possible. For the truth is,
you no more believe in it than you do in the tale of
Cinderella."</p>

<p>"<i>Really</i>, Richard!...what next, I wonder?&mdash;Though I
must say, I don't think there's much to choose between harps and
things, and playing concertinas and tilting tables. One's as stupid
as the other."</p>

<p>"Well, how else...can you perhaps suggest a better way for a
discarnate being to make its presence known? Every beginning is
crude&mdash;and always has been. Though, for that matter, what is
the Morse alphabet they use on the electric telegraph, but a series
of transmitted raps?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not clever enough to argue about these things. But I
know this: if I go to heaven, I hope at least to find there'll be
something something really useful&mdash;<i>to do</i>."</p>

<p>But when the light was out and they lay composing themselves for
sleep, she heard Richard mutter to himself: "There may be...there
probably <i>is</i>...fraud. And why not?...do not rogues ofttimes
preach the gospel? But that there's truth in it&mdash;a truth
greater than any yet dreamed of&mdash;on that I would stake my
soul. Ours the spadework...God alone knows what the end will
be."</p>

<p>The result of this affair was that Mary no longer frequented
seances. On such nights Richard went out alone, and she sat
comfortably by the fire, her feet on the fender, her needlework or
the children at hand.</p>

<p>But not for long. As suddenly as Richard had thrown himself into
the whirl, so suddenly he tired of it, and at the first hint of
spring&mdash;it was early February; birds had begun to twitter in
the parks, the spikes of the golden crocus to push up through the
grass, and Richard petulantly to discard his greatcoat&mdash;on one
of these palely sunny days he came home restless to the
finger-tips, and before the evening ended was proposing to start,
then and there, for the Continent. Why should they not shut up the
house, send the children to the seaside, and jaunt off by
themselves, hampered only by the lightest of luggage, and moving
from place to place as their fancy led them?</p>

<p>Why not? There was, nowadays, no practical reason why he should
scruple to satisfy any and every whim. And so his roughly sketched
plan was carried out. With the sole difference that they took Cuffy
with them. For, as soon as Nannan heard what was in the wind, she
marched downstairs and said bluntly, she did not choose to shoulder
the entire charge of Master Cuffy. The child was anyhow but poorly,
what with the colds and things he had had since getting here; a
walking mass of the fidgets besides; and if now his papa and mamma
were going away as well, she guaranteed he'd worry himself, and
everybody else, into a nervous fever. Mahony cut short the argument
that followed by saying curtly: "We'll take the youngster with us,"
and pooh-poohed Mary's notion that travelling would be bad for the
child. Much less harmful, said he, than staying behind and fretting
his heart out. Besides, Ann would be there. Ann could look after
him.</p>

<p>And so it came about that Cuffy journeyed in foreign parts,
bearing with him, snail-like, all that stood to him for home.</p>

<p>Of these early travels, the most vivid memory he retained was,
oddly enough, the trifling one of being wrapped in an opossum-rug
and carried in some one's arms from a train to a ship, and back to
a train. But in those buried depths of his mind to which he had
normally no access, a whole galaxy of pictures lay stored; and,
throughout his life, was the hidden spring that released them
touched, one and another would abruptly flash into consciousness.
As a small boy they put him in many an awkward fix; for he could
never prove what he said, or even make it sound probable; and, at
school, among companions whose horizon was bounded north, south,
east and west by the bush, they harvested him a lively crop of
ridicule and opprobrium. ("A tarnation liar...that young Cuffs
<i>Mahony!</i>") But there <i>were</i> houses built in
water&mdash;somehow he knew it&mdash;and bridges with shops on
them. Boats with hoods, too, and men who stood up in them to row
with a single oar. There <i>was</i> a statue so big that you could
climb into its nose and sit there, and look out of its eyes:
rivers, not red and muddy but apple green; a tower that leaned
right over to one side; long-legged birds that built their nests on
chimney-tops.&mdash;But then again, on the heel of such bold
assertions, a sudden doubt would invade the speaker; a doubt
whether he had not, after all, only <i>dreamt</i> these things.
With no one to whom he could turn for confirmation, with every
object that related to them lost or destroyed, Cuffy, throughout
his later boyhood, swung like a pendulum between fact and dream,
and was sadly torn in consequence.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-2-3-10" id="ch-2-3-10"></a>Chapter X</h3>

<p>Travelling from Dover to Calais and thence to Paris, the party
set off on what, in thought, Mary ever after dubbed: "that mad race
across Europe."</p>

<p>For, the Channel behind them, Richard's restlessness broke out
in a new form: it seemed impossible for him to be content in any
place they visited for more than a day or two on end. In vain did
Mary protest: "But, Richard, we're not seeing anything!" Within a
few hours of his arrival in a town, he had had enough of it, sucked
it dry; and was fidgeting to be off to the next on their line of
route. Nor was this itch for movement all. The strange food did not
suit him: he either liked it too well and ate too heartily of it,
or turned from it altogether. Then the noisiness of foreign
cities&mdash;the cobbled streets, the rattling of the loosely hung
vehicles, the loud foreign voices, the singing, the
tambourining&mdash;got on his nerves, and, together with the
unshaded windows of hotel bedrooms, kept him awake half the night:
him spoilt, for how many a year, by the perfectly darkened sashes,
the ordered silence of his sleeping-room at "Ultima Thule." And all
the beauties in the world could not make up to Richard for lack of
sleep. Or, to turn it round: rob him of his sleep, and you robbed
him of all power to enjoy fine scenery or handsome monuments. And
so they sometimes arrived at a place and left it again, without
having really seen very much more of it than the four walls of a
room.</p>

<p>Before they had got any distance, it became clear to Mary that
Richard's travelling-days were...well, one could hardly say over,
when they had only just begun. The truth was, they had come too
late. He was no longer able to enjoy them.</p>

<p>It was not the physical discomforts alone that defeated him. The
fancies he went in for, as soon as he set foot on foreign soil,
made his life a misery to him. In Paris, for instance, he was
seized by a nervous fear of the street traffic; actually felt
afraid he was going to be run over. If he had to cross one of the
vast squares, over which vehicles dashed from all directions, he
would stand and hesitate on the kerb, looking from side to side,
unable to resolve to take the plunge; and wasn't he angry with her,
if she tried to make a dash for it! His own fears rendered him
fussy about Cuffy and the maid's safety, too. He wouldn't hear of
them going out alone; and insisted every morning on shepherding
them to their walk in the Public Gardens. If he was prevented, they
must drive there in a <i>fiacre</i>. Which all helped to make the
stay in Paris both troublesome and costly. Then there was that time
in Strasbourg, when they set out to climb the tower of the
cathedral. It was certainly a bad day to choose, for it had rained
in the night and afterwards frozen over, and even the streets were
slippery. But Richard was bent on seeing the Rhine, and the Vosges,
and the Black Forest from the top of the steeple; so up they went.
As far as the platform, it was plain sailing. But on the tower
proper, when they were mounting the innumerable stone
steps&mdash;all glassy with ice, and very tricky to keep a footing
on&mdash;which led to the spire, he turned pale, and confessed to
giddiness...it was true you looked through the wide-open stonework
right down to the street below, where people crawled like ants. And
after another bend in the stair, he clinging fast to the iron
hand-rail, he had ignominiously to give in and descend again:
backwards, too! "I felt I should either fall through one of the
openings or throw myself out. Great heights are evidently not for
me."</p>

<p>And this was not wholly due to imagination. For, after going up
the Leaning Tower of Pisa and taking a peep over the side, he felt
so sick on reaching the ground that he had to go back to the hotel
and lie down.</p>

<p>Again a beautiful city like Munich was ruined for him, by the
all-pervading smell of malt from its many breweries. The whole time
they were there he went about with his nose in the air, sniffing;
and he never ceased to grumble. Next, as the Tyrolese mountains
were so close, they took train and went in among them; but this
didn't suit him either. The nearness of these drear, dark masses
wakened in him, he said, an overpowering sense of oppression; made
him feel as if he <i>must</i> climb them; get to their summits in
order to be able to breathe. One moment abjuring heights, another
hankering after them!...who could keep pace with such
inconsistencies?</p>

<p>Of course there were times when he smiled at himself; saw the
humour of the situation; especially when he had just escaped from
one of his bugbears. But then came the next (he was never prepared
for them) and hit him equally hard. The thing he <i>couldn't</i>
laugh at was his&mdash;their&mdash;"infernal ignorance of foreign
lingos." Not to be able to express himself properly, make himself
fully understood, riled and fretted him; though less, perhaps, than
did her loud and unabashed efforts to say what she wanted. And
because he couldn't argue, or expostulate, with porters, waiters,
cabbies and the like, he constantly suspected these people of
trying to do him. The queer thing was, he preferred being diddled,
putting up with it in gloomy silence, to trying, in broken French,
German or Italian, to call the cheats to account. Many an extra
franc and taler and lira did this hypersensitiveness cost him. But
his dread of being laughed at was stronger than himself.</p>

<p>Yes! there was always something. He never let himself have any
real peace or enjoyment. Or so thought Mary at the time. It was not
till afterwards, when he fell to re-living his travels in memory,
that she learned how great was the pleasure he had got out of them.
Inconveniences and annoyances were by then sunk below the horizon.
Above, remained visions of white cities, and slender towers, and
vine-clad hills; of olive groves bedded in violets; fine music
heard in opera and oratorio; coffee-drinking in shady gardens on
the banks of a lake; orchards of pink almond-blossom massed against
the misty blue of far mountain valley.</p>

<p>Of all the towns they touched, even including Naples and Rome,
Venice suited him best; and this, she firmly believed, because he
went there with the idea that, having neither streets nor wheeled
traffic, it must of necessity be a quiet and restful place. Herself
she noticed nothing of this. Dozens of people walked the narrow
alleys&mdash;you could really go everywhere on foot&mdash;and the
cries of the gondoliers, the singing and mandoline-playing lasted
far into the night. But Richard throve on it; though it was June
now, and very hot, and alive with mosquitoes. He bathed daily on
the Lido, and for the rest of the day kept cool in
picture-galleries and churches, of which he never seemed to tire.
Whereas she, after half an hour of screwing up her eyes and craning
her neck at ceilings, had had more than enough.</p>

<p>They had been there for a whole fortnight, and there was still
no talk of their moving on, when something happened which cut their
stay through as with a knife. The smallest details of that July
afternoon&mdash;it started with one of Cuffy's outbreaks&mdash;were
burnt into Mary's brain.</p>

<p>Richard had gone after lunch to the British Consul's, to fetch
their Australian mail: Mary was anxiously waiting for news of the
birth of Tilly's child. She wrote at her own home budget while
expecting his return, sitting in the cool hotel bedroom with Cuffy
playing on the floor beside her. Deep in her letter, she did not
notice that the child had strayed to the balcony. How long he had
been there, still as a mouse, she did not know; but she was
suddenly startled by hearing him give a shrill cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, no...<i>no</i>!"</p>

<p>Laying down her pen, she stepped through the window. "What's the
matter with <i>you?</i>"</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the canal some men were engaged in
drowning a puppy. They had tied a weight to the little animal's
neck before throwing it into the water, but this was not heavy
enough to keep it down; and again and again, in a desperate
struggle for breath, it fought its way to the surface, only to be
hit at with sticks did it come within arm's reach. Finally, amid
the laughter of the crowd, the flat side of an oar caught it full
on its little panting snout and terrified eyes. With a shriek that
was almost human, it sank, not to rise again.</p>

<p>"Run inside, Cuffy. Don't stay here watching those nasty cruel
men," said Mary, and took him by the arm. But Cuffy tore it away
and remained standing with dilated eyes and open lips, breathing
rapidly. The last blow struck, he burst into a passion of tears
and, running to a corner of the room, threw himself face downwards
on the floor.</p>

<p>There followed one of those dreadful exhibitions of rage or
temper which Mary found it so hard to reconcile with her little
son's usual docility. Cuffy kicked and screamed and wouldn't be
touched, like the naughtiest of children; and at the same time was
shaken from head to foot by sobs about which there was nothing
childish.</p>

<p>She was still bending over him, still remonstrating, when the
door opened and Richard came in. One glance at his face was enough
to make her forget Cuffy and spring to her feet.</p>

<p>"Richard! Why, my dear...why, <i>whatever</i> is the matter?"
For he had gone out, not an hour earlier, in the best of spirits;
and here he came back white as a ghost, with dazed-looking eyes and
shuffling feet. "Are you ill? Has the sun...?"</p>

<p>Midway in a sob Cuffy stopped to listen...held his breath.</p>

<p>Pouring himself out a glass of water and spilling it as he
poured, Richard drank, in a series of gulps. Then, from a bundle of
newspapers and letters he was carrying, he drew forth a folded
sheet and handed it to Mary.</p>

<p>"Read this."</p>

<p>In deep apprehension she took the paper. As she read she, too,
went pale. It was a telegram from Jerry, forwarded by their London
banker, and ran: RETURN IMMEDIATELY. MOST URGENT. WILDING ABSCONDED
AMERICA.</p>

<p>Mary could not all at once take in the full sense of the
words.</p>

<p>"But how...what does it mean, Richard? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Mean? Ruin, I suppose. In all probability I am a ruined man."
And dropping heavily on a chair, Mahony buried his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>Cuffy sat up, and peeped furtively at his father and mother,
with round eyes.</p>

<p>"Ruin? But how?...why? Oh dear, <i>can't</i> you speak? No, no,
Richard! What are you thinking of? Remember the child." From under
his hands tears were dripping on the table.&mdash;"Go to Ann,
Cuffy. She shall take you out or give you your tea. Run away,
dear...quickly!&mdash;Now, Richard, pull yourself together. It's no
good breaking down. <i>What</i> has happened? What do you intend to
do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what am I to do? Oh, help me, help me, Mary!"</p>

<p>"Of course, dear, of course I will."</p>

<p>Stifling her own alarm, Mary sat down at his side and took his
hand in hers. It was plain he had had a severe shock. He admitted
as much himself: the thing had come so suddenly. He told how, out
of the dazzling sunshine he had stepped into the cool office at the
consulate, had passed the time of day with a clerk, had been
chatting with the fellow when the telegram was handed him.</p>

<p>"This has just come for you, sir. I was about to send it on to
your hotel."</p>

<p>Yes, he had not even stopped talking as he tore it open. The
next moment the room had started to swing round him; he had been
obliged to take a seat, every one staring at him, eyeing him
askance. How he managed to get out of the place and home, he didn't
know. His mind seemed to have escaped control: felt like a child's
puzzle that had been rudely jolted into hundreds of pieces, and had
now all to be re-set. "Which I don't feel equal to, Mary&mdash;and
that's the truth. Something seems to have broken inside me."</p>

<p>Oh, how like a bad dream, the remainder of that day! For the
practical side of the matter could not wait&mdash;not for a single
hour. Richard half-way restored to composure, they had to set to
work in cold blood to discuss the situation. It was clear to both
that he must return to Melbourne with the least possible delay.
Till then, he would not know how he stood. Things might not, urged
Mary, be quite so black as they looked at first glance, Wilding's
absence yet prove capable of a rational explanation. But Richard,
she could see, feared the worst...had no real hope of this. (And in
her heart even she thought the tone of Jerry's message belied it.
Oh, where would they have been, had she not had that private confab
with Jerry the night before sailing!) No, the conclusion Richard
had jumped to at first reading, he still maintained: after the
fashion of many a dishonest broker, Wilding had sold the scrip he
held from his clients and bolted with the proceeds. Now, the only
question was: what was left; what could be saved from the
wreck.&mdash;A mail steamer was due to leave Venice some time
during the week; and on this Richard must, if humanly possible,
secure a berth. And the rest of the day passed in running from
wharf to agent, from consul to banker. The money question had also
to be gone into: what he still had in hand; how much remained on
his letters of credit; what balance lay in the London bank. Then
they had to think of the furniture, the curios and pictures they
had bought on their travels, and sent back to England. The London
house would have to be got rid of; the servants paid off, and so
on. Before evening Mary's brain was reeling with all the details it
was necessary for her to take in. But this rush and flurry was
exactly what Richard needed. And she kept him at it, kept him on
the go till late at night, with the result that he went to bed
dog-tired&mdash;too worn out to think.</p>

<p>But he had hardly dozed off, when they were roused by Cuffy
starting up in his sleep, screaming: "No, no!...don't hit him...oh,
<i>Doggy!</i>"</p>

<p>Hastily informed what had happened, Mahony struck a light and
rose; and forgetting himself over a trouble even more pressing than
his own, he lifted Cuffy out of bed and set him on his knee There
he talked to him as, thought Mary, only Richard could talk. He went
through the scene of the afternoon, made the child, amid tears and
frantic sobs, live through it afresh; then fell to work to dispel
the brooding horror that lay over it. Such things as this were
often to be met with in life; Cuffy must be a brave little man and
face them squarely. Somehow, they all fitted into a great scheme on
God's part, which our poor brains were too puny to understand. To
be pitied was not only poor doggy, whose struggles had soon ceased,
but also the men who could act so cruelly towards their little
brother&mdash;no less a brother because he had not the gift of
speech. Cuffy must try to feel sorry for them, too; they had
probably never had any one to teach them the difference between
right and wrong. And he must make up for their want of love, by
being doubly kind himself to all dumb creatures.&mdash;And so on
and on, in a quiet, soothing voice, till the child's terror was
allayed and he slept, his arms clasped like a vice round his
father's neck.</p>

<p>Forty-eight hours later Richard, with for luggage a single
portmanteau, boarded the Overland Mail for Egypt&mdash;and thus
ended a two days' nightmare in which he had never ceased to torture
himself with the bitterest reproaches. "It is all my fault...my own
fault...I alone am to blame. If <i>only</i> I had not been so
headstrong...had listened to you!" The last glimpse Mary had of him
showed him standing at the taffrail of the tender that carried
passengers to the steamer; standing very erect, and even making a
brave attempt to smile, as he waved his hat in farewell; for, when
the time came, his chief thought was of her, and how he could ease
the parting.</p>

<p>Till now Mary had kept up; had had, indeed, not a moment to
think of herself, so busy had she been consoling, supporting,
encouraging. But now that everything was over and she sat alone in
the hotel bedroom, all she had gone through, all the conflicting
emotions of these two past days&mdash;not the least of which were
self-reproaches every whit as bitter as Richard's own&mdash;took
toll of her. Behind locked doors she broke down and wept
bitterly.</p>

<p>The thought of her coming loneliness appalled her. For over
twenty years she had never been absent from Richard for more than a
few weeks at a time...had never been parted from him by more than a
couple of hundred miles. Now, this violent abrupt separation, with
all the seas between, made her feel as if she had been roughly torn
in two. For months and months to come she would have no one to lean
on, no one to consult&mdash;oh, <i>What</i> if one of the children
should fall ill and Richard not be there? She also shrank, with the
timidity of unuse, from the prospect of having to emerge from her
womanly seclusion and rub shoulders with the world. Her work had
invariably been carried on in the background. When it came to a
personal contact with business and business people, Richard had
always been there, to step forward and bear the brunt. Now she, who
had travelled but the briefest of distances unescorted, was called
on to undertake by herself, not only the far journey across the
Continent, but the infinitely more trying one of a two to three
months' sea-voyage round the Cape. And until she got on board! To
be faced, before that, were railway officials, porters,
house-agents, shipping companies, bankers; the drawing of cheques
and the paying of bills; the dismissing of servants; the packing
and transport of baggage and furniture, the embarking, the long,
long voyage with but one nurse for the children, and nobody at all
to look after her. But hardest of anything was the knowledge that
she would have to remain in her present state of ignorance and
uncertainty, knowing nothing of what had actually happened, or of
how Richard was bearing up, and whether he was well or ill, until
she herself landed in Melbourne more than six months hence.</p>

<p>But the barest hint of illness in connection with Richard was
enough to make her mind swerve, with a sudden jerk, from herself
and her own troubles, to him. Desperately as she would miss him,
and need him, yet she had small doubt&mdash;something within told
her so&mdash;that, when she stood face to face with things, she
would contrive to get on somehow. But he!&mdash;how would he ever
manage without her?...to nerve him and to soothe him, and to listen
to his outpourings&mdash;away from her, he quite literally would
not have a soul to speak to. She saw him on the outward voyage,
eternally pacing the deck, a prey to blackest anxiety&mdash;and the
last thought of self went under, in a fierce uprush of pity for
him, so solitary, so self&mdash;centred, so self-tormented. Oh,
that he might be spared the worst! He was old for his age; much too
old to have to begin life afresh&mdash;life which, with every
caprice satisfied, had yet become so hard for him: an hourly tussle
with flimsy, immaterial phantoms, whose existence other people
never so much as dreamed of. And to know him pinched for money
again, going short, denying himself, fretting over the straits to
which he had brought her and the children...no! Mary felt there was
nothing, absolutely nothing she would not do, to help him, to spare
him.</p>

<p>Well!...sitting crying wasn't the way to begin. That was a
fool's job. She must just set her teeth and make the best of
things&mdash;separation, uncertainty,
responsibility&mdash;endeavouring, when it came to business, to
stand her ground, even though she was but an inexperienced woman.
And as a first step she got up, dried her eyes, and bathed her
face. After which she had trunks and saratogas brought out, and
fell to packing.</p>

<p>But more and more, as the day wore on, did a single thought take
possession of her&mdash;and, in this thought, Mary came as near as
she ever would, to a conscious reflection on the aim and end of
existence. It began with her suddenly becoming aware how she longed
to hug her babies to her again, and how much she had missed them; a
feeling until now resolutely repressed...for Richard's sake. Now,
as, in imagination, she gathered her little ones to her
heart&mdash;and gathered Richard with them, he, too, just an adored
and absent child&mdash;it came over her like a flash that, amid
life's ups and downs, to be able to keep one's little flock about
one, to know one's dearest human relationships safe and unharmed,
was, in good truth, all that signified. Compared with this,
hardships and misfortune weighed no more than feathers in the
balance.</p>

<p>"As long as we can be together...as long as I have him and my
children...nothing really matters. I can bear anything...put up
with anything...if only they are spared me!"</p>

<p>When for the third time, Richard Mahony set foot in Ausralia, it
was to find that the fortune with which that country but some six
years back had so airily invested him no longer existed. He was a
ruined man; and at the age of forty-nine, with a wife and children
dependent on him, must needs start life over again.</p>

<p>Twice in the past he had plucked up his roots from this soil, to
which neither gratitude nor affection bound him. Now, fresh from
foreign travel, from a wider knowledge of the beauties of the old
world, he felt doubly alien; and, with his eyes still full of
greenery and lushness, he could see less beauty than ever in its
dun and and landscape.&mdash;It was left to a later generation to
discover this: to those who, with their mother's milk, drank in a
love of sunlight and space; of inimitable blue distances and
gentian-blue skies. To them, the country's very shortcomings were,
in time, to grow dear: the scanty, ragged foliage; the unearthly
stillness of the bush; the long, red roads, running inflexible as
ruled lines towards a steadily receding horizon...and engendering
in him who travelled them a lifelong impatience with hedge-bound
twists and turns. To their eyes, too, quickened by emotion, it was
left to descry the colours in the apparent colourlessness: the
upturned earth that showed red, white, puce, gamboge; the blue in
the grey of the new leafage; the geranium red of young scrub; the
purple-blue depths of the shadows. To know, too, in exile, a rank
nostalgia for the scent of the aromatic foliage; for the honey
fragrance of the wattle; the perfume that rises hot and heavy as
steam from vast paddocks of sweet, flowering lucerne&mdash;even for
the sting and tang of countless miles of bush ablaze.</p>

<p>Of ties such as these, which end by drawing a man home, Richard
Mahony knew nothing. He returned to the colony at heart the
stranger he had always been.</p>

<p>Landing in Melbourne one cold spring day in the early seventies,
he tossed his belongings into a hansom, and without pausing to
reflect drove straight to his old club at the top of Collins
Street. But his stay there was short. For no sooner did he learn
the full extent of his losses, than he was ripe to detect a marked
reserve, not to say coolness, in the manner of his former friends
and acquaintances. More than one, he fancied, deliberately shunned
him. Bitterly he regretted his overhasty intrusion on this, the
most exclusive club in the city; to which wealth alone was the
passport. (He had forgotten, over his great wanderings, how small a
world he had here come back to. Within the narrow clique of
Melbourne society, anything that happened to one of its members was
quickly known to all; and the news of his crash had plainly
preceded him.) Well! if this was a foretaste of what he had to
expect&mdash;snubs and slights from men who would once have been
honoured by his notice&mdash;the sooner he got out of people's way
the better. And bundling his clothes back into his trunk, he drove
off again, choosing, characteristically enough, not a quiet hotel
in a good neighbourhood, but a second-class boarding-house on the
farther side of the Victoria Parade. Here, there was no earthly
chance of meeting any one he knew. Or, for that matter, of meeting
any one at all! For these outlying streets, planned originally for
a traffic without compare&mdash;the seething mob of men, horses,
vehicles that had once flowed, like a living river, to the
goldfields&mdash;now lay as bare as they had then been thronged. By
day an occasional spindly buggy might amble along their vast width,
or a solitary bullock-wagon take its tortoise way; but after dark,
feebly lit by ill-trimmed lamps set at enormous distances one from
another, they turned into mere desolate, wind-swept spaces. On
which no creature moved but himself.</p>

<p>It was here that he took his decisions, laid his plans. His days
resembled a blurred nightmare, in which he sped from one dingy
office to the next, or sat through interviews with lawyers and
bankers&mdash;humiliating interviews, in the course of which his
unbusiness-like conduct, his want of <i>nous</i> in money matters
was mercilessly dragged to light. But in the evening he was free:
and then he would pace by the hour round these deserted streets,
with the collar of his greatcoat turned up to his ears, his hands
clasped at his back, his head bent against the icy south winds; or,
caught by a stinging hail-shower, would seek shelter under the lee
of an old, half dismantled "Horse, Cow and Pig-Market," of which
the wild wind rattled and shook the loose timbers as if to carry
them sky-high.</p>

<p>Of the large fortune he had amassed&mdash;the fortune so happily
invested, so carefully husbanded&mdash;he had been able to recover
a bare three thousand pounds. The unprincipled scoundrel in whose
charge he had left it&mdash;on Purdy's equally unprincipled
advice&mdash;had fleeced him of all else. On this pitiful sum, and
a handful of second-rate shares which might bring him in the
equivalent of what he had formerly spent in the year on books, or
Mary on her servants and the running of the nurseries, he had now
to start life anew: to provide a home, to feed, clothe, educate his
children, pay his way. One thing was clear: he must set up his
plate again with all dispatch; resume the profession he had once
been so heartily glad to retire from. And his first bitterness and
resentment over, he was only too thankful to have this to fall back
on.</p>

<p>The moot question was, where to make the start; and in the
course of the several anxious debates he had with himself on this
subject, he became ever more relieved that Mary was not with him.
Her absence gave him a freer hand. For, if he knew her, she would
be all in favour of his settling up-country, dead against his
trying to get a footing in Melbourne. Now he was as ready as any
man could be, to atone to her for the straits to which he had
brought her. But&mdash;he must be allowed to meet the emergency in
his own way. It might not be the wisest or the best way; but it was
the only one he felt equal to.</p>

<p>Bury himself alive up-country, he could and would not!...not if
she talked till all was blue. He saw her points, of course: they
were like herself...entirely practical. There were, she would
argue, for every opening in Melbourne ten to be found in the bush,
where doctors were scarce, and twice and three times the money to
be made there. Living-expenses would be less, nor would he need to
keep up any style. Which was true enough...as far as it went. What,
womanlike, she would overlook, or treat as of slight importance,
was the fact that he had also his professional pride to consider.
He with his past to condemn himself to the backwoods! Frankly, he
thought he would be doing not only himself, but his children after
him, an injury, did he agree to anything of the kind. No! he was
too good for the bush.</p>

<p>But the truth had still another facet. Constrained, at his age,
to buckle to again, he could only, he believed, find the necessary
courage under conditions that were not too direly repellent. And
since, strive as he might, he could not break down Mary's imagined
disapproval, he threw himself headlong into the attempt to get
things settled&mdash;irrevocably settled&mdash;before she arrived;
took to scouring the city and its environs, tramping the inner and
outer suburbs, walking the soles off his boots and himself to a
shadow, to find a likely place. Ruefully he turned his back on the
sea at St. Kilda and Elsternwick, the pleasant spot of earth in
which he once believed he had found a resting place; gave the green
gardens of Toorak a wide berth&mdash;no room there for an elderly
interloper!&mdash;and, stifling his distaste, explored the outer
darkness of Footscray, Essendon, Moonee Ponds. But it was always
the same. If he found what he thought a suitable opening, there was
certain not to be a house within coo-ee fit for them to live
in.</p>

<p>What finally decided him on the pretty little suburb of
Hawthorn&mdash;after he had thoroughly prowled and nosed round, to
make sure he would have the field to himself&mdash;was not alone
the good country air, but the fact that, at the junction of two
main streets&mdash;or what would some day be main streets, the
place being still in the making&mdash;he lit on a capital building
lot, for sale dirt-cheap. For a doctor no finer position could be
imagined&mdash;and in fancy he ran up the house that was to stand
there. Of brick, two storeys high, towering above its neighbours,
it would face both ways, be visible to all comers. The purchase of
the land was easily effected&mdash;truth to tell, only too easily!
He rather let himself be blarneyed into it. The house formed the
stumbling-block. He sped from firm to firm; none would touch the
job under a couple of thousand. In vain he tried to cut down his
requirements. Less than two sitting-rooms they could not possibly
do with, besides a surgery and a waiting-room. Four bedrooms, a
dressing-room or two, a couple of bathrooms were equally necessary;
while no house of this size but had verandah and balcony to keep
the sun off, and to serve as an outdoor playroom for the
children.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it, in the long run, but to put his pride
in his pocket and take the advice given him on every hand: to
build, as ninety-nine out of a hundred did here, through one of the
numerous Building Societies that existed to aid those short of
ready money. But it was a bitter pill for a man of his former
wealth to swallow. Nor did it, on closer acquaintance, prove by any
means the simple affair he had been led to believe. In the
beginning, a thousand was the utmost he felt justified in laying
down. But when he saw all that was involved he contrived, after
much anxious deliberation, to stretch the thousand to twelve
hundred, taking out a mortgage at ten per cent, with regular
repayment of capital.</p>

<p>It was at this crisis that he felt most thankful Mary was not
with him. <i>How</i> she would have got on his nerves!...with her
doubts and hesitations, her aversion to taking risks, her fears
lest he should land them all in Queer Street. Women paid dearly for
their inexperience: when it came to a matter of business, even the
most practical could not see beyond the tips of their noses. And,
humiliating though the present step might be, there was absolutely
no cause for alarm. These things were done&mdash;done on every
hand&mdash;his eye had been opened to that, in his recent
wanderings. By men, too, less favourably placed than he. But even
suppose, for supposing's sake, that he did not succeed to the top
of his expectations&mdash;get, that was, the mortgage paid off
within a reasonable time&mdash;where would be the hardship in
treating the interest on the loan as a rental, in place of living
rent-free? (And a very moderate rent, too, for a suitable house!)
But Mary would never manage to forget the debt that lay behind. And
it was here the temptation beset him to hold his tongue, to say
nothing to her about the means he had been forced to employ. Let
her believe he had built out of the resources left to him. For
peace' sake, in the first place; to avoid the bother of explanation
and recrimination. (What a drag, too, to know that somebody was
eternally on the <i>qui vive</i> to see whether or no you were able
to come up to the mark!) Yet again, by keeping his own counsel, he
would spare her many an hour's anxiety&mdash;a sheerly needless
anxiety. For any doubts he might have had himself, at the start,
vanished like fog before a lifting breeze as he watched the house
go up. Daily his conviction strengthened that he had done the right
thing.</p>

<p>It became a matter of vital importance to him that the walls
should be standing and the roof on, before Mary saw it: Mary needed
the evidence of her senses: could grasp only what she had before
her eyes. Then, pleasure at getting so fine a house might help to
reconcile her to his scheme...God alone knew what the poor soul
would be expecting. And so, in the belief that his presence
stimulated the workpeople, he spent many an hour in the months that
followed watching brick laid to brick, and the hodmen lumber to and
fro; or pottering about among clay and mortar heaps: an elderly
gentleman in a long surtout, carrying gloves and a cane; with
greyish hair and whiskers, and a thin, pointed face.</p>

<p>Again, he cooled his heels there because he had nothing better
to do. Once bitten, twice shy, was his motto; and he continued
rigidly to give friends and relatives the go-by: time enough to
pick up the threads when he could step out once more in his true
colours. Besides, the relatives were Mary's; the friends as well.
The consequence was, he now fell into a solitariness beyond
compare: got the habit of solitude, and neither missed nor wanted
the company of his fellows.</p>

<p>Since, however, every man who still stands upright needs some
star to go by, he kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the coming of
wife and children. This was to be his panacea for every ill. And as
the six months' separation drew to an end, he could hardly contain
himself for anxiety and impatience. Everything was ready for them:
he had taken a comfortably furnished house in which to instal them
till their own was built; had engaged a servant, moved in himself.
Feverishly he scanned the shipping-lists. Other boats made port
which had left England at the same time...and even later...despite
gales, and calms, and contrary winds. But it was not till the
middle of December that the good ship <i>Sobraon</i>, ninety odd
days out, was sighted off Cape Otway; and he could take train to
Queenscliffe for a surprise meeting with his dear ones, and to sail
with them up the Bay.</p>

<p>In his hand he carried a basket of strawberries&mdash;the first
to come on the market.</p>

<p>Standing pointing out to the children familiar landmarks on the
shores of their new-old home, Mary suddenly stopped in what she was
saying and rubbed her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why! I do declare...if it's not&mdash;Look, children,
<i>look</i>, there's your Papa! He's waving his handkerchief to
you. Wave back! Nod your heads! Throw him a kiss!"</p>

<p>"Papa!...dere's Papa!" the twins told each other, and obediently
set to wagging like a pair of china mandarins; the while with their
pudgy hands they wafted kisses in the direction of an approaching
boat-load of men.</p>

<p>"Where's he? I don't see!" opposed Cuffy, in a spirit to which
the oneness of his sisters&mdash;still more, of sisters and
mother&mdash;often provoked him. But this time he had a grievance
as well. Throughout the voyage there had been ever such lots of
laughing and talking and guessing, about who would reckernise Papa
first: and he, as the eldest, had felt quite safe. Now Mamma, who
had joined in the game and guessed with them, had spoilt
everything, not played fair.</p>

<p>But for once his mother did not heed his pouting. She was gazing
with her heart in her eyes at the Health Officer's boat, in which,
by the side of the doctor coming to board the ship, sat Richard in
a set of borrowed oilskins, ducking his head to avoid the spray,
and waving and shouting like an excited schoolboy. In a very few
minutes now the long, slow torture of the voyage would be over, and
she would know the worst.</p>

<p>Here he came, scrambling up the ladder, leaping to the deck.</p>

<p>"Richard!...my dear! Is it really you? But <i>oh</i>, how thin
you've got!"</p>

<p>"Yes, here I am, safe and sound! But you, wife...how are
you?&mdash;<i>and</i> the darlings? Come to Papa, who has missed
you more than he can say!&mdash;Good day, good day, Eliza! I hope I
see you well!&mdash;But <i>how</i> they've grown, Mary! Why, I
hardly know them."</p>

<p>The Dumplings, pink and drooping with shyness but docile as
ever, dutifully held up their bud mouths to be kissed; then,
smiling adorably, wriggled back to Mamma's side, crook'd finger to
lip. But Cuffy did not smile as his father swung him aloft, and
went pale instead of pink. For, at sight of the person who came
jumping over, he had been seized by one of his panicky fears. The
Dumplings, of course, didn't remember Papa, they couldn't, they
were only four; but he did...and somehow he remembered him
<i>diffrunt</i>. Could it be a mistake? Not that it wasn't him...he
didn't mean that...he only meant...well, he wasn't sure what he did
mean. But when this new-old Papa asked: "And how's my big boy?" a
fresh spasm of distrust shot through him. Didn't he know that
everybody always said "small for his age"?</p>

<p>But, dumped down on the deck again, he was forgotten, while over
his head the quick, clipped voice went on: "Perfectly well!...and
with nothing in the world to complain of, now I've got you again. I
thought you'd <i>never</i> come. Yes, I've been through an
infernally anxious time, but that's over now, and things aren't as
bad as they might be. You've no need to worry. But let's go below
where we can talk in peace." And with his arm round her shoulders
he made to draw Mary with him...followed by the extreme silent
wonder of three pairs of eyes, whose owners were not used any more
to seeing Mamma taken away like this without asking. Or anybody's
arm put round her either. When she belonged to them.</p>

<p>But at the head of the companion-way Mahony paused and slapped
his brow.</p>

<p>"Ha!...but wait a minute...Papa was forgetting. See here!" and
from a side pocket of the capacious oilskins he drew forth the
basket of strawberries. These had suffered in transit, were bruised
and crushed.</p>

<p>"What, strawberries?&mdash;already?" exclaimed Mary, and eyed
the berries dubiously. They were but faintly tinged.</p>

<p>"The very first to be had, my dear! I spied them on my way to
the train.&mdash;Come, children!"</p>

<p>But Mary barred the way...stretched out a preventing hand. "Not
just now, Richard. Later on, perhaps...when they've had their
dinners. Give them to me, dear."</p>

<p>Jocularly he eluded her, holding the basket high, out of her
reach. "No, this is <i>my</i> treat!&mdash;Now who remembers the
old game? 'Open your mouths and shut your eyes and see what Jacko
will send you!'"</p>

<p>The children closed in, the twins displaying rosy throats, their
eyes faithfully glued to.</p>

<p>But Mary peremptorily interposed. "No, no, they mustn't! I
should have them ill. The things are not half ripe."</p>

<p>"What? Not let them eat them?...after the trouble I've been to,
to buy them and lug them here? Not to speak of what I paid for
them."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Richard, but&mdash;ssh, dear! surely you must
see..." Mary spoke in a low, persuasive voice, at the same time
frowning and making other wifely signals to him to lower his. (And
thus engrossed did not feel a pull at her sleeve, or hear Cuffy's
thin pipe: "<i>I'll</i> eat them, Mamma. I'd <i>like</i> to!" Now
he knew it was Papa all right.) For several of their fellow
passengers were watching and listening, and there stood Richard
looking supremely foolish, holding aloft a single strawberry.</p>

<p>But he was too put out to care who saw or heard. "Well and good
then, if they're not fit to eat&mdash;not even <i>after</i>
dinner!&mdash;there's only one thing to be done with them.
Overboard they go!" And picking up the basket he tossed it and its
contents into the sea. Before the children...Eliza...everybody.</p>

<p>With her arm through his, Mary got him below, to the privacy and
seclusion of the cabin. The same old Richard! touchy and
irascible...wounded by any trifle. But she knew how to manage him;
and, by appealing to his common sense and good feelings, soon
talked him round. Besides, on this particular day he was much too
happy to see them all again, long to remain in dudgeon. Still, his
first mood of pleasure and elation had fizzled out and was not to
be recaptured. The result was, the account he finally gave her of
the state of his finances, and their future prospects, was not the
rose-coloured one he had intended and prepared. What she now got to
hear bore more relation to sober fact.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-3-1-2" id="ch-3-1-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>A neighbour's cocks and hens wakened him before daybreak. The
insensate creatures crew and cackled, cackled and crew; and, did
they pause for breath, the sparrows took up the tale. He could not
sleep again. Lying stiff as a log so as not to disturb Mary, he
hailed each fresh streak of light that crept in at the sides of the
blinds or over the tops of the valances; while any bagatelle was
welcome that served to divert his thoughts and to bridge the gap
till rising-time. The great mahogany wardrobe, for instance. This
began as an integral part of the darkness, gradually to emerge, a
shade heavier than the surrounding gloom, as a ponderous mass; only
little by little, line by line, assuming its true shape. Faithfully
the toilet-glass gave back each change in the room's visibility.
Later on there were bars to count, formed by unevenness in the
slats of the venetians, and falling golden on the whitewashed
walls.</p>

<p>Yes, whitewash was, so far, the only covering the walls knew.
The papering of them had had to be indefinitely postponed. And
gaunt indeed was the effect of their cold whiteness on eyes used to
rich, dark hangings. This was one reason why he preferred the
penance of immobility, to getting up and prowling about downstairs.
Never did the house look more cheerless than on an early morning,
before the blinds were raised, the rooms in order. One realised
then, only too plainly, what a bare barn it was; and how the task
of rendering it cosy and homelike had baffled even Mary. He would
not forget her consternation on first seeing it; her cry of: "But
Richard!...how shall we <i>ever</i> fill it?" Himself he stood by
dumbfounded, as he watched her busy with tape and measure: truly,
he had never thought of this. She had toiled, dear soul, for weeks
on end, stitching at curtains and draperies to try to clothe the
nakedness&mdash;in vain. If they had not had his books to fall back
on, the place would have been uninhabitable. But he had emptied the
whole of his library into it, with the result that books were
everywhere: on the stair-landings, in the bedrooms; wherever they
could with decency stop a gap. Another incongruity was the
collection of curios and bric-a-brac garnered on their travels.
This included some rare and costly objects, which looked odd, to
say the least of it, in a room where there were hardly chairs
enough to go round. For he had had everything to buy, down to the
last kitchen fork and spoon. And by the time he had paid for a
sideboard that did not make too sorry a show in the big
dining-room; a dinner-table that had some relation to the
floor-space; a piano, a desk for his surgery and so on, he was bled
dry. Nor did he see the smallest prospect, in the meantime, of
finishing the job. They had just to live on in this half-baked
condition, which blazoned the fact that funds had given out; that
he had put up a house it was beyond his means to furnish. How he
writhed when strangers ran an appraising glance over it!</p>

<p>No: unrested, and without so much as a cup of tea in him, he
could not bring himself to descend and contemplate the evidences of
his folly. Instead, the daylight by now being come, he lay and
totted up pound to pound until, for sheer weariness, he was ready
to drop asleep again. But eight o'clock had struck, there could be
no lapsing back into unconsciousness. He rose and went down to
breakfast.</p>

<p>They had the children with them at table now. And good as the
little things were by nature, yet they rose from ten hours' sound
sleep lively as the sparrows: their tongues wagged without a stop.
And though he came down with the best intentions, he soon found his
nerves jarred. Altering the position of his newspaper for the tenth
time, he was pettishly moved to complain: "Impossible! <i>How</i>
can I read in such a racket?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, you can't expect children to sit and never say a
word."</p>

<p>But she hushed them, with frowns and headshakes, to a bout of
whispering, or the loud, hissing noise children make in its stead;
under fire of which it was still harder to fix his thoughts.</p>

<p>Retired to the surgery he was no better off; for now the
thrumming of five-finger exercises began to issue from the
drawing-room, where the children were having their music-lessons.
This was unavoidable. With the arrival of the patients all noise
had to cease; later on, Mary was too busy with domestic duties to
sit by the piano; and that the youngsters must learn music went
without saying. But the walls of the house had proved mere
lath-and-plaster; and the tinkle of the piano, the sound of
childish voices and Mary's deeper tones, raised in one-two-threes
and one-two-three-fours, so distracted him that it took him all his
time to turn up and make notes on his cases for the day. By rights,
this should have been his hour for reading, for refreshing his
memory of things medical. But not only silence failed him; equally
essential was a quiet mind; and as long as his affairs remained in
their present uncertain state, that, too, was beyond his reach.
Before he got to the foot of a page, he would find himself adding
up columns of figures.</p>

<p>The truth was, his brain had reverted to its ancient and
familiar employment with a kind of malicious glee. He was powerless
to control it. Cark and care bestrode him; rode him to death; and
yet got him nowhere; for all the calculations in the world would
not change hard facts. Reckon as he might, he could not make his
dividends for the past six months amount to more than a hundred and
fifty pounds: a hundred and fifty! Nor was this wretched sum a
certainty. It came from shares that were to the last degree
unstable&mdash;in old days he had never given them a thought. And
against this stood the sum of eight hundred pounds. Oh! he had
grossly over-estimated his faculty for self-deception. Now that he
was in the thick of things, it went beyond him to get this debt out
of his mind. Suppose anything should happen to him before he had
paid it off? What a legacy to leave Mary! Out and away his sorest
regret was that, in the good old days now gone for ever, he had
failed to insure his life. Thanks to his habitual dilatoriness he
had put it off from year to year, always nursing the intention,
shirking the effort. Now, the premium demanded would be sheerly
unpayable.</p>

<p>At present everything depended on how the practice panned out.
The practice...Truth to tell, after close on a six months' trial,
he did not himself know what to make of it. Had he been less
pressed for time and money, he might have described it as not
unpromising. As matters stood, he could only say that what there
<i>was</i> of it was good: the patients of a superior class, and so
on. But from the first it had been slow to move&mdash;there seemed
no sickness about&mdash;the fees slower still to come in. If, by
the end of the year, things did not look up, he would have to write
down his settling there as a bad job. It was an acute
disappointment that he had only managed to secure two paltry
lodges. Every general practitioner knew what <i>that</i> meant. He
had built on lodge-work: not only for the income it assured, but
also to give a fillip to the private practice. Again, not expecting
what work there was to be so scattered, he had omitted to budget
for horse hire, or the hire of a buggy. This made a real hole in
his takings. He walked wherever he could; but calls came from
places as far afield as Kew and Camberwell, which were not to be
reached on foot. Besides, the last thing in the world he could
afford to do was to knock himself up. Even as it was, he got back
from his morning round tired out; and after lunch would find
himself dozing in his chair. Of an evening, he was glad to turn in
soon after ten o'clock; the one bright side to the general
slackness being the absence of night-work. Of course, such early
hours meant giving the go-by to all social pleasures. But truly he
was in no trim for company, either at home or abroad. How he was
beginning to rue the day when he had burdened himself with a house
of this size, merely that he might continue to make a show among
his fellow-men. When the plain truth was, he would not turn a hair
if he never saw one of them again.</p>

<p>Yes, his present feeling of unsociableness went deeper than mere
fatigue: it was a kind of deliberate turning-in on himself. Mary no
doubt hit the mark, when she blamed the months of morbid solitude
to which he had condemned himself on reaching Melbourne. He had,
declared she, never been the same man since.</p>

<p>"I ought to have known better than to let you come out
alone."</p>

<p>She spoke heartily; but doubts beset her. It was one thing to
put your finger on the root of an ill; another to cure it. Yet a
failure to do so might cost them dear. Here was Richard with his
way and his name to make, a practice to build up, connections to
form; and, instead of taking every hand that offered, he kept up
his "Ultima Thule" habits of refusing invitations, shirking
introductions; and declined into this "let me alone and don't
bother me" state, than which, for a doctor, she could imagine none
more fatal.</p>

<p>Of course, having to start work again at his age was no light
matter, and he undoubtedly felt the strain; found it hard also,
after all the go-as-you-please latter years, to nail himself down
to fixed hours and live by the clock. He complained, too, that his
memory wasn't what it used to be. Names, now. If he didn't write
down a name the moment he heard it, it was bound to escape him; and
then he could waste the better part of a morning in struggling to
recapture it.</p>

<p>"You're out of the way of it, dear, that's all," she resolutely
strove to cheer him, as she brushed his hat and hunted for his
gloves. "Now have you your case-book? And is everything in your
bag?" More than once he had been obliged to tramp the whole way
home again, for a forgotten article.</p>

<p>The reminder annoyed him. "Yes, yes, of course. But my
thermometer...now where the dickens have I put that?" And testily
he tapped pocket after pocket.</p>

<p>"Here...you've left it lying. Oh, by the way, Richard, I wonder
if you'd mind leaving an order at the butcher's as you go
past?"</p>

<p>But at this he flared up. "Now, Mary, <i>is</i> it fair to
bother me with that kind of thing, when I've so much else to think
of?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's only...the shop's so far off, and I can't spare
cook. You've just to hand in a note as you pass the door."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. A thousand and one reasons!"</p>

<p>"Oh well, never mind. Eliza and the children must go that way
for their walk&mdash;though it does take them down among the
shops."</p>

<p>"And why not? Are the children everlastingly to be spared at my
expense?"</p>

<p>He went off, banging the gate behind him. The latch did not
hold; Mary stepped out to secure it. And the sight of him trudging
down the road brought back her chief grievance against him. This
was his obstinate refusal to keep a horse and trap. It stood to
reason: if he would only consent to drive on his rounds, instead of
walking, he would save himself much of the fatigue he now endured;
and she be spared his perpetual grumbles. Besides, it was not the
thing for a man of his age and appearance to be seen tramping the
streets, bag in hand. But she might as well have talked to a post.
The only answer she got was that he couldn't afford it. Now this
was surely imagination. She flattered herself she knew something
about a practice, and could tell pretty well what the present one
was likely to throw off...if properly nursed. To the approximate
three hundred a year which Richard admitted to drawing from his
dividends, it should add another three; and on six, with her
careful management, they could very well pull through to begin
with. It left no margin for extravagances, of course; but the
husbanding of Richard's strength could hardly be put down under
that head. Since, however, he continued obdurate, she went her own
way to work; with the result that, out of the money he allowed her
to keep house on, she contrived at the end of three months to hand
him back a tidy sum.</p>

<p>"Now if you don't feel you want to <i>buy</i> a horse and buggy,
you can at least give a three months' order at the
livery-stable."</p>

<p>But not a bit of it! More, he was even angry. "Tch! <i>Do</i>,
for goodness' sake, leave me to manage my own affairs! I don't want
a horse and trap, I tell you. I prefer to go on as I am." And, with
that, her economics just passed into and were swallowed up in the
general fund. She wouldn't do it again.</p>

<p>"Mamma!"</p>

<p>This was Cuffy, who had followed her out and climbed the gate at
her side. He spoke in a coaxy voice; for as likely as not Mamma
would say: "Run away, darling, and don't bother me. I've no time."
But Cuffy badly wanted to know something. And, since Nannan left,
there had never been any one he could ask his questions of: Mamma
was always busy, Papa not at home.</p>

<p>"Mamma! Why does Papa poke his head out so when he walks?"</p>

<p>"That's stooping. People do it as they grow older." Even the
child, it seemed, could see how tiresome Richard found walking.</p>

<p>"What's it mean growing old&mdash;really, truly?"</p>

<p>"Why, losing your hair and your teeth, and not being able to get
about as well as you used to."</p>

<p>"Does it hurt?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, little silly!"</p>

<p>"Does Papa lose his teeth? Does Eliza? And why has he always got
a bag in his hand now?"</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> an inquisitive little boy! He carries things in it
to make people well with."</p>

<p>"Why does he want to make them well?"</p>

<p>"To get money to buy you little folks pretty clothes and good
things to eat. But come...jump down! And run and tell Eliza to get
you ready for your walk."</p>

<p>"I don't <i>like</i> going walks with Eliza," said Cuffy and,
one hand in his mother's, reluctantly dragged and shuffled a foot
in the gravel. "Oh, I do wis' I had my little pony again."</p>

<p>"So do I, my darling," said Mary heartily, and squeezed his
hand. "I'm afraid you'll be forgetting how to ride. I must talk to
Papa. Then perhaps Santa Claus...or on your birthday..."</p>

<p>"Ooh! Really, truly, Mamma?"</p>

<p>"We'll see."&mdash;At which Cuffy hopped from side to side up
the length of the path.</p>

<p>And Mary meant what she said. It was unthinkable that <i>her</i>
children should come short in any of the advantages other children
enjoyed. And not to be able to ride, and ride well, too, in a
country like this, might prove a real drawback to them in after
life. Now she had pinched and screwed for Richard's sake, to no
purpose whatever. The next lump sum she managed to get together
should go to buying a pony.</p>

<p>But this was not all. Besides riding, the children ought to be
having dancing-lessons. She did so want her chicks to move prettily
and gracefully; to know what to do with their hands and feet; to be
able to enter a room without awkwardness; and they were just at
their most impressionable age: what they now took in they would
never forget, what they missed, never make good. But she could hope
for no help from Richard; manlike, he expected graces and
accomplishments to spring up of themselves, like wild flowers from
the soil. Everything depended on her. And she did not spare
herself. Thanks to her skill with her needle, they were still, did
they go to a party, the best-dressed children in the room; and the
best-mannered, too, Nannan's strict upbringing still bearing fruit.
None of her three ever grabbed, or gobbled, or drank with a full
mouth; nor were they either lumpishly shy or over-forward, like the
general ruck of colonial children.</p>

<p>But they were getting big; there would soon be more serious
things to think of than manners and accomplishments. If only
Richard did not prove too unreasonable! So far, except for
music-lessons, they had had no teaching at all, one of his odd
ideas being that a child's brain should lie fallow till it was
seven or eight years old. This meant that she had sometimes to
suffer the mortification of seeing children younger than Cuffy and
his sisters able to answer quite nicely at spelling and geography,
while hers stood mutely by. In the Dumplings' case it did not
greatly matter: they were still just Dumplings in every sense of
the word; fat and merry play-babies. But Cuffy was sharp for his
age; he could read his own books, and knew long pieces of poetry by
heart. It seemed little short of absurd to hold such a child back;
and, after she had once or twice seen him put publicly to shame,
Mary took, of a morning, when she was working up a flake-crust or
footing her treadle-machine, to setting him a copy to write, or
giving him simple lessons in spelling and sums. (Which little
incursions into knowledge were best, it was understood, not
mentioned to Papa.)</p>

<p>Her thoughts were all for her children. Herself she needed
little; and was really managing without difficulty to cut her coat
to suit her cloth. In the matter of dress, for instance, she still
had the rich furs, the sumptuous silks and satins she had brought
with her from home &mdash;made over, these things would last her
for years&mdash;had all her ivory and mother-o'-pearl ornaments and
trifles. True, she walked where she had driven, hired less
expensive servants, rose betimes of a morning, but who shall say
whether these changes were wholly drawbacks in Mary's eyes, or
whether the return to a more active mode of life did not, in great
measure, outweigh them? It certainly gave her a feeling of
satisfaction to which she had long been a stranger, to know that
not a particle of waste was going on in her kitchen; that she was
once more absolute monarch in her own domain. Minor pleasures
consisted in seeing how far she could economise the ingredients of
pudding or cake and yet turn it out light and toothsome. Had
Richard wished to entertain, she would have guaranteed to hold the
floor with anyone, at half the cost.</p>

<p>But there was no question of this. They lived like a pair of
hermit crabs; and, in spite of the size of the house, might just as
well have been buried in the bush. For, having talked herself
hoarse in pointing out the harm such a mode of life would do the
practice, she had given way and made the best of things; as long,
that was, as Richard's dislike of company had only to do with the
forming of new acquaintances. When he began his old grumbles at the
presence of her intimate friends and relatives, it was more than
she could stand. In the heated argument that followed her
perplexed: "Not ask Lizzie? Put off the Devines?" she discovered,
to her amazement, that it was not alone his morbid craving for
solitude that actuated him: the house, if you please, formed the
stumbling-block! Because this was still unpapered and rather
scantily furnished, he had got it into his head that it was not fit
to ask people to; that he would be looked down on, because of it.
Now did <i>anyone</i> ever hear such nonsense? Why, half the houses
in Melbourne were just as bare, and nobody thought the worse of
them. People surely came to see you, not your furniture! But he had
evidently chafed so long in silence over what he called the
"poverty-stricken aspect of the place," that there was now no
talking him out of the notion. So Mary shrugged and sighed; and,
silently in her turn, took the sole way left her, which was an
underground way; so contriving matters that her friends came to the
house only when Richard was out of it...a little shift it was again
wiser not to mention to Papa. She also grew adept at getting rid of
people to the moment. By the time the gate clicked at Richard's
return, all traces of the visit had been cleared away.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-1-3" id="ch-3-1-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>Thus she bought peace.&mdash;But when the day came for putting
up a guest in the house, for making use of the unused spare room,
finesse did not avail; and a violent dispute broke out between
them. To complicate matters, the guest in question was Richard's
old bugbear, Tilly.</p>

<p>Tilly, whose dearest wish had been fulfilled some six months
back by the birth of a child, but who since then had remained
strangely silent, now wrote, almost beside herself with grief and
anxiety, that she was bringing her infant, which would not thrive,
to town, to consult the doctors there. And Mary straightway forgot
all her schemes and contrivances, forgot everything but a friend in
need, and wrote off by return begging Tilly, with babe and nurse,
to make their house her own.</p>

<p>Mahony was speechless when he heard of it. He just gave her one
look, then stalked out of the room and shut himself up in the
surgery, where he stayed for the rest of the evening. While Mary
sat bent over her needlework, with determined lips and stubborn
eyes.</p>

<p>Later on, in the bedroom, his wrath exploded in bitter abuse of
Purdy, ending with: "No one belonging to that fellow shall ever
darken <i>my</i> doors again!"</p>

<p>At this she, too, flared up. "Oh...put all the blame for what
happened on somebody else. It never occurs to you to blame
yourself, and your own rashness and impatience. Who but you would
ever have trusted a man like Wilding?&mdash;But Tilly being Purdy's
wife is nothing but an excuse. It's not only her. You won't let a
soul inside the doors."</p>

<p>"Why should my wishes alone be disregarded? The very children's
likes and dislikes are taken more account of. You consider every
one...only not me!" "And you consider no one but yourself!"</p>

<p>"Well, this is my house, and I have the right to say who shall
come into it."</p>

<p>"It's no more yours than mine. And Tilly's my oldest friend, and
I'm not going to desert her now she's in trouble. I've asked her to
come here, and come she shall!"</p>

<p>"Very well then, if she does, I go!"&mdash;And so on, and
on.</p>

<p>In the adjoining dressing-room, the door of which stood ajar,
Cuffy sat up in his crib and listened. The loud voices had wakened
him and he couldn't go to sleep again. He was frightened; his heart
beat pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat. And when he heard somebody begin to cry,
he just couldn't help it, he had to cry, too. Till a door went and
quick steps came running; and then there were Papa's hands to hold
to, and Papa's arms round him; and quite a lot of Hambelin Town and
Handover City to make him go to sleep.</p>

<p>The knot was cut by Tilly choosing, with many, many thanks, to
stay at an hotel in town. There Mary sought her out one late autumn
afternoon, when the white dust was swirling house-high through the
white streets, and the south wind had come up so cold that she
regretted not having worn her sealskin. Alighting from the train at
Prince's Bridge, she turned a deaf ear to the shouts of: "Keb,
Keb!" and leaving the region of warehouses&mdash;poor John's among
them&mdash;made her way on foot up the rise to Collins Street. This
was her invariable habit nowadays, if she hadn't the children with
her: was one of the numerous little economies she felt justified in
practising...and holding her tongue about. Richard, of course,
would have snorted with disapproval. <i>His</i> wife to be tramping
the streets! But latterly she had found her tolerance of his
grandee notions about what she might and might not do, wearing a
little thin. In the present state of affairs they seemed, to say
the least of it, out of place. She had legs of her own, and was
every bit as well able to walk as he was. If people looked down on
her for it...well, they would just have to, and that was all about
it!</p>

<p>These brave thoughts notwithstanding, she could not but
wish&mdash;as she sat waiting in a public coffee-room, the door of
which opened and shut a dozen times to the minute, every one who
entered fixing her with a hard and curious stare&mdash;wish that
Tilly had picked on a quieter hotel, one more suitable to a lady
travelling alone. She was glad when the waiter ushered her up the
red-carpeted stairs to her friend's private sitting-room.</p>

<p>Tilly was so changed that she hardly knew her. Last seen in the
first flush of wifehood, high-bosomed, high-coloured,
high-spirited, she seemed to have shrunk together, fallen in. Her
pale face was puffy; her eyes deeply ringed.</p>

<p>"You poor thing! What you must have suffered!"</p>

<p>Mary said this more than once as she listened to Tilly's tale.
It was that of a child born strong and healthy&mdash;"As fine a boy
as ever you saw, Mary!"&mdash;with whom all had gone well until,
owing to an unfortunate accident, they had been forced to change
the wet-nurse. Since then they had tried one nurse after another;
had tried handfeeding, goat's milk, patent mixtures; but to no
purpose. The child had just wasted away. Till he was now little
more than a skeleton. Nor had he ever sat up or taken notice. The
whole day long he lay and wailed, till it nearly broke your heart
to hear it.</p>

<p>"And me...who'd give my life's blood to help 'im!"</p>

<p>"Have you seen MacMullen? What does he say?"</p>

<p>Tilly answered with a hopeless lift of her shoulders. "'E calls
it by a fine name, Mary&mdash;they all do. And 'as given us a new
food to try. But the long and short of it is, if the wasting isn't
stopped, Baby will die." And, the ominous word spoken, Tilly's
composure gave way: the tears came with a gush and streamed down
her cheeks, dropping even into her lap, before she managed to fish
a handkerchief from her petticoat pocket.</p>

<p>"There, there, you old fool!" she rebuked herself. "Sorry, love.
It comes of seeing your dear old face again. For weeping and
wailing doesn't help either, does it?"</p>

<p>"Poor old girl, it <i>is</i> hard on you...and when you've so
wanted children."</p>

<p>"Yes, and'm never likely to 'ave another. Other people can get
'em by the dozen&mdash;as 'ealthy as can be."</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't give up hope of pulling him through&mdash;no
matter what the doctors say. You know, Tilly...it may seem an odd
thing to come from me...but I really haven't <i>very</i> much faith
in them. I mean&mdash;well, you know, they're all right if you
break your leg or have something definite the matter with you, like
mumps or scarlet fever&mdash;or if you want a tumour cut out. But
otherwise, well, they never seem to allow enough...I mean, for
<i>common-sense</i> things. Now what I think is, as the child has
held out so long, there must be a kind of toughness in him. And
there's always just a chance you may still find the right
thing."</p>

<p>But when, leaning over the cot, she saw the tiny, wizened
creature that lay among its lace and ribbons: ("Hardly bigger than
a rabbit, Richard...with the face of an old, old man&mdash;no, more
like a poor starved little monkey!") when, too, the feather-weight
burden was laid on her lap, proving hardly more substantial than a
child's doll: then, Mary's own heart fell.</p>

<p>Sitting looking down at the little wrinkled face, her mother
eyes full of pity, she asked: "What does Purdy say?"</p>

<p>"<i>'Im</i>.?" Again Tilly raised her shoulders, but this time
the gesture bespoke neither resignation nor despair. "Oh, Purd's
sorry, of course."</p>

<p>"I should think so, indeed."</p>

<p>"<i>Sorry!</i> Does being sorry <i>help?</i>" And now her words
came flying, her aitches scattering to the winds. "The plain truth
is, Mary, there's not a man living who can go on 'earing a child
cry, cry, cry, day and night and night and day, and keep 'is
patience and 'is temper. And Purd's no different to the rest. When
it gets too bad, 'e just claps on 'is 'at and flies out of the
'ouse&mdash;to get away from it. Men are like that. Only the rosy
side of things for them! And, Purd, 'e must be free. The smallest
jerk of the reins and it's all up. As for a sick child...and even
though it's 'is own&mdash;oh, I've learnt <i>something</i> about
men since I married 'im, Mary! Purd's no good to lean on, not an
'apporth o good. 'E's like an air-cushion&mdash;goes in where you
lean and puffs out somewhere else. And 'ow can 'e 'elp
it?&mdash;when there isn't anything <i>but</i> air in 'im. No, 'e's
nothing in the world but fizzle and talk...a bag of chaff&mdash;an
'ollow drum."</p>

<p>Mary heard her sadly and in silence. This, too. Oh, the gilt was
off poor Tilly's gingerbread in earnest.</p>

<p>But, in listening, she had also cocked an attentive ear, and now
she said: "Tilly, there's something about that child's
cry...there's a tone in it&mdash;a..."</p>

<p>"'Ungry...!" said Tilly fiercely. "'E's starving&mdash;that's
what it is."</p>

<p>"Of course, hungry, too. But I must say it sounds to me more
<i>angry</i>. And then look how he beats the air with his little
fists. He's not trying to suck them or even get them near his
mouth. What I'm wondering is...Richard can't, of course, touch the
case, now it's in MacMullen's hands. But I'm going home to tell him
all about it. He used to have great luck with children in the old
days. There's no saying. He <i>might</i> be able to suggest
something. In the meantime, my dear, keep a good heart. Nothing is
gained by despairing."</p>

<p>"Bless you, Mary! If any one can put spunk into a mortal it's
you."</p>

<p>"Starving?" said Mahony on hearing the tale. "I shouldn't wonder
if starving itself was not nearer the mark."</p>

<p>"But Richard, such a <i>young</i> child...do you really
think...Though &mdash;I must say when I heard that
<i>exasperated</i> sort of cry..."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Who's to say where consciousness begins?...or ends.
For all we know, the child in the womb may have its own dim
sentience. Now I don't need to give <i>you</i> my opinion of the
wet-nurse system. None the less, if the case were mine, I should
urge the mother to leave no stone unturned to find the person who
first had it at the breast. A woman of her class will still be
nursing."</p>

<p>"Mary! I'll give 'er the 'alf of what I 'ave. I'll make a
spectacle of myself&mdash;go on me knees down Sturt Street if need
be; but back she comes!" were Tilly's parting words as she stepped
into the train.</p>

<p>And sure enough, not a week later a letter arrived to say that,
by dint of fierce appeals to her motherhood and unlimited promises
("What it's going to cost me, Purd will <i>never</i> know!"), the
woman had been induced to return. A further week brought a second
communication to the breakfast-table, scrawled in a shaky hand and
scrappily put together, but containing the glad news that the child
had actually gained a few ounces in weight, and, better still, had
ceased its heartrending wail. Tilly's joy and gratitude were of
such a nature that Mary did not dare to deliver the message she
sent Richard, as it stood. She just translated the gist of it into
sober English.</p>

<p>And a good job, too, that she had watered it down. For Richard
proved to be in one of his worst, early-morning moods; and was loud
in scorn of even the little she passed on.</p>

<p>He ended by thoroughly vexing her. "Never did I know such a man!
Things have come to such a pass that people can't even feel
grateful to you, without offending you. Your one desire is to hold
them at arm's length. You ought to have been born a mole."</p>

<p>In speaking she had hastily reinserted Tilly's letter in its
envelope. A second letter was lying by her plate. This she read
with wrinkled brows, an occasional surreptitious glance at Richard,
and more than one smothered: "Tch!" She also hesitated for some
time before deciding to hand it, past three pairs of inquisitive
young eyes, over the table.</p>

<p>"Here! I wonder what you'll say to this? It's not my fault this
time, remember."</p>

<p>Mahony incuriously laid aside his newspaper, took the sheet,
frowned at the writing, and tilted it to the correct angle for his
eyes, which were "not what they used to be."</p>

<p>The letter ran:</p>

<p>MY DEAR MRS. MAHONY,</p>

<p>MY DEAR WIFE HAS BEEN ORDERED A SEA-VOYAGE FOR THE BENEFIT OF
HER HEALTH, AND BEFORE SAILING, WISHES, AS LADIES WILL, TO VISIT
THE MELBOURNE EMPORIUMS AND MAKE SOME ADDITIONS TO HER WARDROBE. IT
IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO ACCOMPANY HER, THOUGH I SHALL HOPE TO BID
HER "AU REVOIR" BEFORE SHE SAILS, A FORTNIGHT HENCE. MAY I TRESPASS
UPON YOUR GOODNESS, AND REQUEST YOU TO BE AGNES'S CICERONE AND
ESCORT, WHILE IN MELBOURNE FOR THE ABOVE OBJECT? I NEED NOT DWELL
ON HER PREFERENCE FOR YOU IN THIS ROLE, OVER EVERY ONE ELSE.</p>

<p>GIVE MY DUE REGARDS TO YOUR HUSBAND, AND, BELIEVE ME,<br>
VERY TRULY YOURS,<br>
HENRY OCOCK.</p>

<p>"In plain English, I presume, it's to be your duty to keep her
off the bottle."</p>

<p>"<i>Richard!</i>...ssh! How <i>can</i> you?" expostulated Mary,
with a warning headshake; which was justified by Cuffy at once
chiming in: "Do ladies have bottles too, Mamma, as well as babies?"
(Cuffy had been deeply interested in the sad story of Aunt Tilly's
little one and its struggle for life.) "Now, you chicks, Lallie
untie Lucie's bib and all three run out and play.&mdash;<i>not</i>
before the children, Richard! That boy drinks in every word. You'll
have him repeating what you say in front of Agnes. For I suppose
what Mr. Henry really means is that we are to invite her here?"</p>

<p>"The hint is as plain as the nose on your face."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm afraid it is," and Mary sighed. "I wonder what we
should do. I'm very fond of Agnes; but I've got the children to
think of. I shouldn't like <i>them</i> to get an inkling...On the
other hand, we can't afford to offend an influential person like
Mr. Henry."</p>

<p>"I know what I can't afford&mdash;and that's to have this house
turned into a dumping-ground for all the halt and maimed of your
acquaintance. The news of its size is rapidly spreading. And if
people once get the idea they can use it as they used 'Ultima
Thule,' God help us! There'll be nothing for it but to move...into
a four-roomed hut."</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, if you would only tell me how we really stand,
instead of making such a mystery of it. For we can't go on living
without a soul ever entering our doors."</p>

<p>"We may be glad if we manage to live at all."</p>

<p>"There you go! One exaggeration after the other."</p>

<p>"Well, well! I suppose if Ocock has set his mind on us
dry-nursing his wife again, we've got to truckle to him. Only don't
ask me to meet <i>him</i> over the head of it. I've no intention of
being patronised by men of his type, now that I've come down in the
world."</p>

<p>"<i>Patronised?</i> When I think how ready people were to take
us up again when we first came out! But you can't expect them to go
on asking and inviting for ever, and always being snubbed by a
refusal."</p>

<p>Agnes. Sitting opposite her old friend in the wagonette that
bore them from the station, watching the ugly tic that convulsed
one side of her face, Mary thought sorrowfully of a day, many a
year ago, when, standing at the door of her little house, she had
seen approach a radiant vision in riding-habit, curls and feathers.
What a lovely creature Agnes had been!...how full of kindliness and
charm...and all to end in this: a poor little corpulent, shapeless,
red-faced woman, close on fifty now, but with the timid uncertain
bearing of a cowed child. Never should she have married Mr. Henry.
With another man for a husband, everything might have turned out
differently.</p>

<p>The first of a series of painful incidents occurred when, the
cab having drawn up at the gate, the question of paying the
driver's fare arose. Formerly, the two of them would have had a
playful quarrel over it, each disputing the privilege with the
other. Now, Agnes only said: "If you will be so good, love?...my
purse so hard to get at," in a tone that made Mary open her eyes.
It soon came out that she had been shipped to Melbourne literally
without a penny in her pocket. Wherever they went, Mary had to be
purse-bearer, Agnes following meekly and shamelessly at her heels.
An intolerable position for any man to put his wife in! It was true
she had <i>carte blanche</i> at the big drapery stores; but all she
bought&mdash;down to the last handkerchief&mdash;was entered on a
bill for Mr. Henry's scrutiny. Did she wish to make a
present&mdash;and she was just as generous as of old&mdash;she had
so to contrive it (and she certainly showed a lamentable want of
dignity, the skill of a practised hand, in arranging matters with
the shopman) that, for instance, one entry on the bill should be a
handsome mantle, which she never bought. The result was a sweet
little ivory-handled parasol for "darling Mary;" a box of
magnificent toys and books for the children, of whom she made
much.</p>

<p>From her own she was completely divorced, both boy and girl
having been put to boarding-school at a tender age. But Agnes was
fond of children; and, of a morning, while Mary was shaking up the
beds or baking pastry, she would sit on the balcony watching the
three at play; occasionally running her fingers through the twins'
fair curls, which were so like the goldilocks of the child she had
lost.</p>

<p>She never referred to her own family; had evidently long ceased
to have any motherly feelings for them. She just lived on dully and
stupidly, without pride, without shame&mdash;so long, that was, as
she was not startled or made afraid. The company of the children
held no alarms for her; but early in the visit Mary found it
necessary to warn Richard: "Now whatever you do, dear, don't be
short and snappy before her. It throws her into a perfect
twitter."</p>

<p>And Richard, who, for all his violence of expression, would not
have harmed a fly, was thereafter gentleness itself in Mrs. Henry's
presence, attending to her wants at table, listening courteously to
her few diffident opinions, till the little woman's eyes filled
with tears and she ceased to spill her tea or mess her front with
her egg. "The doctor...so nice, love...so very, very kind!"</p>

<p>"She has evidently been bullied half out of her wits."</p>

<p>Throughout the fortnight she stayed with them, Mary was the
faithfullest of guardians, putting her own concerns entirely on one
side to dog her friend's footsteps. And yet, for all her vigilance,
she could sometimes have sworn that Agnes's breath was tainted;
while on the only two occasions on which she let her out of her
sight...well! what then happened made her look with more lenience
on Mr. Henry's precautions. Once, Lucie had a touch of croup in the
night and could not be left, so that Agnes must needs go alone to
her dressmaker; and once came an invitation to a luncheon-party in
which Mary was not included. Each time a wagonette was provided for
Mrs. Henry from door to door, and paid to wait and bring her home;
while Richard even condescended to give the driver a gentle hint
and a substantial tip. And yet, both times, when she returned and
tried to get out of the cab...oh dear! there was nothing for it but
to say in a loud voice, for the servants' benefit: "I'm so sorry
you don't feel well, dear. Lean on me!" to get the door of the
spare room shut on her and whip her into bed.</p>

<p>"Jus' like a <i>real</i> baby!" thought Cuffy, who had not
forgotten the remark about the bottle. Running into the spare room
in search of his mother, he had found Aunt Agnes sitting on the
side of the bed, with only her chemise on and a very red face,
while Mamma, looking funny, rummaged in a trunk. Going to bed in
the daytime? Why? Had she been naughty? And was Mamma cross with
her, too? She was with him. She said: "Go away at once!" and
"Naughty boy!" before he was hardly inside. But Aunt Agnes was
funny altogether. Cook and Eliza thought so, too. They laughed and
whispered things he didn't ought to hear. But he did once. And that
night at the supper-table curiosity got the better of him, and he
asked out loud: "Where's Auntie Agnes too tight, Mamma?"</p>

<p>"Too tight? Now whatever do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>Mary's tone was jocosely belittling. But Cuffy was not deceived
by it. Instinctively he recognised the fond pride that lurked
beneath the depreciation&mdash;the amused interest in "what in all
the world the child would say next." He was also spurred on by the
attention of the Dumplings, who, remembering sad affairs of too
much cake and tight pinny-bands, sat eager and expectant, turning
their eyes from Mamma to him and back again.</p>

<p>"Why, Eliza said...she said Auntie Agnes was tight&mdash;too
tight."</p>

<p>Above his head the eyes of husband and wife met; and Mahony
threw out his hands as if to imply: "There you have it!"</p>

<p>But Mamma was <i>drefully</i> angry. "How dare you repeat such a
nasty, vulgar thing! I'm <i>ashamed</i> of you&mdash;you naughty
boy!"</p>

<p>Besides really "wanting to know," Cuffy had thought his question
a funny one, which would call forth laughter and applause. He was
dumbfounded, and went red to the roots of his hair. What had he
said? Why was Mamma so cross? Why was it more wrong for Auntie
Agnes to be tight than Lallie or Lucie?&mdash;And now he had made
Mamma and Papa cross with each other again, too.</p>

<p>"It's not <i>repeating</i> kitchen talk that matters, Mary; but
that the child should be in the way of hearing it at all."</p>

<p>"Pray, how can I help it? I do my best; but it's quite
impossible for me never to let the children out of my sight. I've
told you over and over again they need a governess."</p>

<p>As the time approached for Mr. Henry's arrival, Agnes grew more
and more ill at ease: her tic redoubled in violence; she could
settle to nothing, and wandered aimlessly from room to room; while,
on receipt of the letter fixing the day, she began openly to shake
and tremble. "You won't mention to Henry, Mary...I mean...oh, love,
you understand?" and all Mary's tactful assurances did not quieten
her. Her fear of her husband was painful to see; almost equally
painful her barefaced relief when, at the eleventh hour, important
business cropped up which made it impossible for Mr. Henry to get
away.</p>

<p>"Of course, if things have come to this pass between them, then
it's much better they should be separated for a while. But that he
can let <i>any</i> business interfere with seeing her off on so
long a journey&mdash;well, all I can say is..." said Mary; and left
the rest of her wrath to the imagination.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!...when he's got some one here to do his dirty work
for him. He probably never had any intention of coming."</p>

<p>So the two women drove to Sandridge and boarded a sailing-vessel
bound for the Cape. The best cabin amidships had been engaged for
Agnes, and tastefully furnished. There were flowers in it, and
several boxes of biscuits and oranges for the voyage. But Agnes did
not so much as look round; she only cried and cried; and, when the
time for parting came, threw her arms about Mary and clung to her
as if she would never let go. It was, said Mary afterwards, just
like seeing a doomed creature off for perdition.</p>

<p>"I don't believe she'll ever come back. Oh, it's a burning
shame! Why couldn't he have put her in a Home?"</p>

<p>"My dear, that would publish his disgrace to the world. He has
chosen the one polite and irreproachable way of getting rid of
her...without a scandal."</p>

<p>"You mean...? But surely she won't be able to get it on board
ship?"</p>

<p>"If you think that, Mary, you still know next to nothing of the
tricks a tippler is up to!"&mdash;And how right he was, was shewn
when the cook, in turning out the spare room, came upon a regular
nest of bottles&mdash;empty medicine bottles, the dregs of which
bespoke their contents&mdash;tucked away inside the first bend of
the chimney.</p>

<p>Mary wrote to Mr. Henry informing him of Agnes's departure, also
that the visit had passed off <i>without contretemps</i>: and
shortly after, she received the gift of a photograph-album, bound
in vellum and stamped in gold with her initials. It was a handsome
and costly present. But Mahony waxed bitterly sarcastic over the
head of it.</p>

<p>"An album!...a photograph-album!...as sole return for the
expense we've been put to&mdash;why, cab-hire alone must have run
into pounds&mdash;over <i>his</i> wife, whom we did not invite and
had no wish to see. Not to speak of the strain the visit has been
on you, my dear."</p>

<p>"But Richard, you wouldn't have had him send us money?&mdash;ask
for our <i>Bill?</i>" Mary spoke heatedly to hide her own feelings,
which were much the same as his. Richard singled out cab-fares; but
these were but one item of many. In the course of a long day's
shopping Agnes and she had needed lunch and
refreshment&mdash;manlike he no doubt imagined them living on
air!&mdash;and not infrequently Agnes had fancied some article in a
shop where no account was run: none of which extras had been
mentioned to him. The truth was, what with this, that and the other
thing, Mary had been forced to make a sad hole in her savings.</p>

<p>"We certainly don't need Ocock's assistance in going down-hill,"
was Richard's parting shot.</p>

<p>It was true, a very hearty note accompanied the album; the pith
of which was: IF AT ANY TIME, MY DEAR MRS. MAHONY, AN OPPORTUNITY
TO RETURN YOUR GREAT KINDNESS TO MY DEAR WIFE SHOULD ARISE, I TRUST
YOU WILL LET ME HEAR OF IT.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-3-1-4" id="ch-3-1-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>To-morrow was the Dumplings' birthday, and they were having a
big party. But it was his, Cuffy's, party, too; for when he had
first got six, they didn't have a house yet, and there was no room
for a party. It was really <i>most</i> his, 'cos he was the oldest:
his cake would be six storeys high, and have six lighted candles
round it, and his chair be trimmed with most green leaves. Mamma
said he might cut the cake his very own self, and make the pieces
big or little just as he liked. She stopped in the kitchen all day,
baking jam tarts and sausage-rolls, and men had taken the
drawing-room carpet off and sprinkled the floor with white dust,
so's you could slide on it. All his cousins were coming, and Cousin
Emmy, and lots and lots of other children. But it was not of these
grandeurs Cuffy thought, as he sat on the edge of the verandah,
and, for sheer agitation, rocked himself to and fro. The truth was,
in spite of the glorious preparations he felt anything but happy.
Guiltily and surreptitiously he had paid at least a dozen visits to
the outhouse at the bottom of the yard, to steal a peep inside.
First, Mamma had said "soon" for the pony, and then "someday," and
then his birthday: so to-morrow was his last hope. And this hope
was growing littler and littler. If <i>only</i> he hadn't told! But
he had, had whispered it in a secret to the Dumplings, and to that
horrid tease, Cousin Josey, as well. And promised them rides, and
let the twins draw lots who should be first; and they'd guessed and
guessed what colour it would be; all in a whisper so's Mamma
shouldn't hear.</p>

<p>"I fink it'll be black," said Lallie; and Lucie nodded: "Me,
too! An' wiv a white tail."</p>

<p>"But I <i>know</i> it'll be brown!"</p>

<p>"He knows it'll be bwown!" buzzed one Fatty to the other.</p>

<p>"Huh! I wouldn't <i>have</i> a pony with a white tail."</p>

<p>But peep as he might, no little horse appeared in the shed; and
Cuffy went about with a strange, empty, sinking feeling inside
him&mdash;a sense of having been tricked. Nor did the several
handsome presents he found beside his bed make up to him for this
disappointment. He early kicked over a giraffe belonging to the
giant Noah's Ark and broke its neck; flew into a tantrum when
rebuked; was obstreperous about being dressed, and snarly to his
sisters; till Mary said, if he didn't behave he'd go to bed
instead. How he dreaded the display of the presents! Cousin Josey
with her sneery laugh would be sure to blurt out in front of
everybody: "He said he was going to get a pony! Ho! Where's your
pony now?" The Dumplings were easier to deal with. In answer to
their round-eyed wonder he just said, in airy fashion: "He says he
can't come quite to-day. He didn't get born yet."</p>

<p>"Have you seed him?"</p>

<p>"Course I have!" Which left the twins more dazzled than would
have done the animal's arrival.</p>

<p>But it proved as lovely a party as they had ever
had&mdash;lasted till past eleven, and the whole house, with the
exception of the surgery, was turned upside down for it. Quite
twenty children came, and nearly as many grown-ups. The
drawing-room was stripped bare of its furniture but for a line of
chairs placed round the walls. Verandah and balcony were hung with
Chinese lanterns and dozens of coloured balloons. In the
dining-room a long table, made up of several smaller tables put
together, was laden with cakes and creams and jellies; and even the
big people found the good things "simply delicious." And though, of
course, Mary could not attempt to compete with some of the lavish
entertainments here given for children&mdash;the Archie Whites had
actually had a champagne supper for their five-year-old, the
Boppins had hired a <i>chef</i> from a caterer's&mdash;yet she had
spared no pains to make her children's party unique in its way. And
never for an instant did she allow the fun to flag. Even the quite
little tots, who soon tired of games and dancing, were kept amused.
For their benefit a padded see-saw had been set up on the verandah,
as well as a safe nursery swing. On the stair-landings stood a bran
pie and a lucky bag; while Emmy superintended the fishing for
presents that went on, with rod and line, over the back of the
drawing-room sofa.</p>

<p>In a pause between the games Mary walked through the
drawing-room, her black silk skirts trailing after her, the hands
of two of the smallest children in hers; one of them John's
baby-boy, a bandy-legged mite, still hardly able to toddle. Mary
was enjoying herself almost as much as the children; her cheeks
were rose-pink with satisfaction, her eyes a-sparkle. At this
moment, however, her objective was Cuffy, who, his black eyes not a
whit less glittery than her own, his topknot all askew&mdash;he was
really getting too big for a topknot; but she found it hard to
forgo the morning pleasure of winding the silky curl about her
finger&mdash;Cuffy was utilising the pause to skate up and down the
slippery floor. He was in wild spirits: Cousin Josey had contented
herself with making a hidjus face at him and pinching him on the
sly: the titbit of the evening, the cutting of the cake, was still
to come; and he had played his piece&mdash;"Home Sweet Home" "with
runs"&mdash;which had earned him the usual crop of praise and
applause. Now there was no holding him.</p>

<p>"Cuffy! Cuffy <i>dear</i>, don't romp like that! You <i>must</i>
behave, and set a good example to your visitors. Listen! I think I
heard Papa. Run and tell him to slip on another coat, and come in
and see the fun."</p>

<p>But Cuffy jerked his arm away: Mamma was not so easily forgiven.
"Shan't!...don't want to!" and was off again like a flash.</p>

<p>"Tch! He's so excited.&mdash;Emmy, you go to your uncle; you can
usually get round him. He really ought to put in an appearance. It
will do him good, too...and amuse him."</p>

<p>Emmy hesitated. "Do you think so, Aunt Mary?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course."</p>

<p>"I'll take Baby, then. Perhaps Uncle will let me lay him down on
his sofa. It's time he had a nap; he screams so at night if he gets
over-tired."</p>

<p>"You're wonderful with that child, Emmy," said Mary, watching
the girl cuddle her little stepbrother in her arms, where he curled
up and shut his eyes, one little hand dangling limp and sleepy over
her shoulder. "I'm sure Lizzie ought to be very grateful to
you."</p>

<p>"I don't know what I'd do without him."</p>

<p>Emmy tapped at the surgery door. "May I come in?"</p>

<p>The blind was down; she could just make her uncle out, sitting
hunched and relaxed in his armchair. He gave a violent start at her
entrance, exclaiming: "Yes, yes? What is it?&mdash;Oh, you, Emmy!
Come in, my dear, come in. I think I must have dropped off." And
passing a fumbly hand over his forehead, he crossed to the window
and drew up the blind.</p>

<p>What! with all that noise? thought Emmy wonderingly. Aloud she
said: "May I stay here a little with Jacky? I want him to have a
nap."</p>

<p>"Surely." And Mahony cleared the end of the sofa that she might
find a place with her burden. "And how is the little man
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, doing finely! He has hardly been afraid of anything this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"We must examine him again," said Mahony kindly, laying a finger
on the child's sweat-damp hair, and noting the nervous pucker of
the little brows.</p>

<p>There was a pause, Emmy gazing at her nursling, Mahony at her.
Then: "How vividly you do remind me of your mother, my dear! The
first time I ever saw her&mdash;she could have been little older
than you are now&mdash;she held you on her lap...just as you hold
Jacky."</p>

<p>"Did she?" Emmy played meditatively with a tassel on the child's
shoe. "People are always saying that...that I'm like her. And
sometimes, Uncle, I think it would be nicer just to be like
oneself. Instead of a kind of copy."</p>

<p>To no one else would she have confided so heretical a sentiment.
But Uncle Richard always understood.</p>

<p>And sure enough: "I can see your point, Emmy," said he. "You
think: to a new soul why not a brand-new covering? All the same,
child, do not begrudge a poor wraith its sole chance of cheating
oblivion."</p>

<p>"I only mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can assure you, you've nothing to fear from the comparison,
nothing at all!" And Mahony patted his niece's hand, looking fondly
at her in her white, flounced tarlatan, a narrow blue ribbon round
her narrow waist, a wreath of forget-me-nots in her ripe-corn hair.
There was no danger to Emmy in letting her know what you thought of
her, so free from vanity was she. Just a good, sweet, simple
creature.</p>

<p>But here the girl bethought herself of her errand. "Oh yes, Aunt
Mary sent me to tell you...I mean she thought, Uncle, you might
like to come and see what fun the children are having."</p>

<p>On the instant Mahony lost his warmth. "No, no. I'm not in the
mood."</p>

<p>"Uncle, the Murdochs and the Archie Whites are here...people
who'd very much like to see you," Emmy gently transposed Mary's
words.</p>

<p>"Entirely your aunt's imagination, child! In reality she knows
as well as I do that it's not so. In the course of a fairly long
life, my dear, I have always been able to count on the fingers of
one hand, those people&mdash;my patients excepted, of
course&mdash;who have cared a straw whether I was alive or dead.
No, Emmy. The plain truth is: my fellow-men have little use for
me&mdash;or I for them."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle..." Emmy was confused, and showed it. Talk of this
kind made her feel very shy. She could not think of anything to say
in response: how to refute ideas which she was sure were not true.
Positively sure. For they opened up abysses into which, young
girl-like, she was afraid to peer. An awkward pause ensued before
she asked timidly: "Do you feel very tired to-night?"</p>

<p>"To the depths of my soul, child!" Then, fearing lest he had
startled her with his violence, he added: "I've had&mdash;and still
have&mdash;great worries, my dear...business worries."</p>

<p>"Is it the practice, Uncle? Doesn't it do well?"</p>

<p>"That, too. But I have made a sad fool of myself, Emmy&mdash;a
sad fool. And now here I sit, puzzling how to repair the
mischief."</p>

<p>Alone again, he let himself fall back into the limp attitude in
which she had surprised him. It was well-being just to lie back,
every muscle relaxed. He came home from tramping the streets
dog-tired, and all of a sweat: as drained of strength as a squeezed
lemon.</p>

<p>No one else appeared to disturb him. Emmy, bless her! had done
her work well, and Mary might now reasonably be expected to leave
him in peace. Let them jig and dance to the top of their bent,
provided he was not asked to join in. He washed his hands of the
whole affair. From the outset, the elaborate preparations for this
party had put his back up. It was not that he wanted to act the
wet-blanket on his children's enjoyment. But the way Mary went
about things stood in absolutely no relation to his shrunken
income. She was striving to keep pace with people who could reckon
theirs by the thousand. It was absurd. Of course she had grown so
used, in the latter years, to spending royally, that it was hard
for her now to trim her sails. Just, too, when the bairns were
coming to an age to appreciate the good things of life. Again, his
reason nudged him with the reminder that any ultra-extravagance on
her part was due, in the first place, to her ignorance of his
embarrassments. He had not enlightened her...he never would. He
felt more and more incapable of standing up to her incredulous
dismay. In cold blood, it seemed impossible to face her with the
tidings: "The house we live in is not our own. I have run
myself&mdash;run you and the children&mdash;into debt to the tune
of hundreds of pounds!" At the mere thought of it he might have
been a boy once more, standing before his mother and shaking in his
shoes over the confession of some youthful peccadillo. A still
further incentive to silence was the queer way his gall rose at the
idea of interference. And it went beyond him to imagine Mary
<i>not</i> interfering. If he knew her, she would at once want to
take the reins: to manage him and his affairs as she managed house
and children. And to what was left of his freedom he clung as if
his life depended on it.</p>

<p>Excuse enough for meddling she would have; he had regularly
played into her hands. Had he only never built this accursed house!
It, and it alone, was the root of all the trouble. Had he contented
himself with a modest weatherboard, they might still have been
upsides with fate. Mary would not have been led to entertain beyond
their means&mdash;for the very good reason that she would not have
had room for it&mdash;and he have enjoyed the fruits of a quiet
mind. Instead of which, for the pleasure of sitting twirling his
thumbs in a house that was far too large for him, he had condemned
himself to one of the subtlest forms of torture invented by man:
that of being under constraint to get together, by given dates,
fixed sums of money. The past three months had been a nightmare.
Twenty times a day he had asked himself: shall I be able to do it?
And when, by the skin of his teeth, he had contrived to foot his
bill and breathe more freely, behold! the next term was at the
door, and the struggle had all to begin anew. And so it would go
on, month after month; round and round in the same vicious circle.
Or with, for sole variety, a steadily growing embarrassment. As it
was, he could see the day coming when he would be able to pay no
more than the bare interest on the loan. And the humiliation this
spelt for him only he knew. For, on taking up the mortgage, he had
airily intimated that he intended, <i>for a start</i>, making
quarterly repayments of fifty pounds: while later on...well, only
God knew what hints he had dropped for later on: his mind had been
in haste to forget them. Did he now fall into arrears, his
ignominious financial situation would be known to every one, and he
become a marked man.</p>

<p>Who could have thought this place would turn out so
poorly?&mdash;become a jogtrot little suburban affair that just
held together, and no more. Such an experience was something new to
him, and intolerable. In the early days it was always he who had
given up his practices, not they him. He had abandoned them, one
after the other, no matter how well they were doing. Here, the
pages of his case-book remained but scantly filled. A
preternaturally healthy neighbourhood. Or was that just a polite
fiction of his own making? More than once recently it had flashed
through his mind that, since putting up his plate, he had treated
none but the simplest cases. Only the A B C of doctoring had been
required of him. The fact was, specialists were all too easy to get
at. But no! that wouldn't hold water either. Was it not rather he
himself who, at first hint of a complication, was ready to refer a
patient?...to shirk undue worry and responsibility? Yes, this was
his own share in the failure; this, and the fact that his heart was
not in the work. But indeed how should it be? When he recalled the
relief with which, the moment he was able, he had forsaken
medicine...where <i>could</i> the joy come in over taking it up
again, an older, tireder man, and, as it were, at the point of the
sword? And with the heart went the will, the inclination. Eaten up
by money-troubles, he had but faint interest to spare for the
physicking of petty ailments. Under the crushing dread lest he
should find himself unable to pay his way, he had grown numb to all
else. Numb...cold...indifferent.</p>

<p>What did <i>not</i> leave him cold but, on the contrary, whipped
him to a fury of impatience and aversion, was the thought of going
on as he was: of continuing to sit, day after day, as it were
nailed to the spot, while his brain, the only live part of him,
burnt itself out in maddening anxieties and regrets. Oh, fool that
he had been!...fool and blind. To have known himself so ill!
<i>Never</i> was he the man to have got himself into this pitiable
tangle...with its continual menace of humiliation...disgrace. What
madness had possessed him? Even in his youth, when life still
seemed worth the pother, he had avoided debt like the plague. And
to ask himself now, as an old man and one grown weary of effort, to
stand the imposition of so intolerable a strain, was nothing short
of suicidal. Another half-year like the last, and he would not be
answerable for himself.</p>

<p>He began to toy with the idea of flight. And over the mere
imagining of a possible escape from his torments, he seemed to wake
to life again, to throw off the deadly lethargy that paralysed him.
Change...movement...action: this it was he panted after! It was the
sitting inactive, harried by murderous thoughts over which he had
lost the mastery, that was killing him. If once he was rid of
these, all might again be well. And now insidious fancies stole
upon him: fancies which, disregarding such accidents of the day as
money and the lack of money, went straight to the heart of his most
urgent need. To go away&mdash;go far away&mdash;from everything and
every one he had known; so that what happened should happen to him
only&mdash;be nobody's business but his own! Away from the crowd of
familiar faces, these cunning, spying faces, <i>which knew all</i>,
and which Mary could yet not persuade herself to forbid the house.
Somewhere where she would be out of reach of the temptations that
here beset her, and he free to exist in the decent poverty that was
now his true walk in life. Oh, for privacy!&mdash;privacy and
seclusion...and freedom from tongues. To be once more a stranger
among strangers, and never see a face he knew again!</p>

<p>He had not yet found courage, however, for the pitched battle he
foresaw, when something happened that fairly took his breath away.
As it were, overnight, he found himself the possessor of close on
two hundred and fifty pounds. Among the scrip he still held were
some shares called "Pitman's," which till now had been good for
nothing but to make calls. Now they took a sudden upward bound,
and, at a timely hint from a grateful patient who was in the swim,
Mahony did a little shuffle&mdash;selling, buying and promptly
re-selling&mdash;with this result. True, a second venture, unaided,
robbed him of the odd fifty. None the less there he stood, with his
next quarter's payments in his hand. He felt more amazed than
anything else by this windfall. It certainly did not set his mind
at rest; it came too late for that. Try as he would, he could not
now face the idea of remaining at Hawthorn. He had dwelt too much
by this time on the thought of change; taken too fixed an aversion
to this room where he had spent so many black hours; to the house,
the practice, the neighbourhood. Something within him, which would
not be silenced, never ceased to urge: free yourself...escape
&mdash;while there is still time.</p>

<p>In these days Mary just sighed and went about her work. Richard
had hardly a word even for the children: on entering the house he
retired at once to the surgery and shut himself in. What he did
there, goodness only knew. But it was not possible nowadays for her
to sit and worry over him, or to take his moods as seriously as she
would once have done. And any passing suspicion of something being
more than ordinarily amiss was apt, even as it crossed her mind, to
be overlaid by, say, the size of the baker's bill, or the fact that
Cuffy had again outgrown his boots. But she had also a further
reason for turning a blind eye. Believing, as she truly did, that
Richard's moroseness sprang mainly from pique at having to take up
work again, she was not going to risk making matters worse by
talking about them. Richard was as suggestible as a child. A word
from her might stir up some fresh grievance, the existence of which
he had so far not imagined.&mdash;But when the crash came, it
seemed as if a part of her had all along known and feared the
worst.</p>

<p>None the less it was a shattering blow: one of those that left
you feeling ten years older than the moment before. And in the
scene that followed his blunt announcement and lasted far into the
night, she strove with him as she had never yet striven, labouring
to break down his determination, to bring him back to sanity. For
more, much more than themselves and their own prosperity was now at
stake. What happened to them happened equally to the three small
creatures they had brought into the world.</p>

<p>"It's the children, Richard! Now they're there, you haven't the
<i>right</i> to throw up a fixed position, as the fancy takes
you...as you used to do. It didn't matter about me. But it's
different now&mdash;everything's different. <i>only</i> have
patience! Oh! I can't believe you really mean it. It seems
incredible...impossible."</p>

<p>Mahony was indignant. "And do you think no one considers the
children but you? When their welfare is more to me than anything on
earth?"</p>

<p>"But if that's true, how can you even <i>think</i> of giving up
this place?...the house&mdash;our comfortable home! You know quite
well you're not a young man any more. The openings would be so few.
You'd never get a place to suit you better."</p>

<p>"I tell you I <i>cannot</i> stop here!"</p>

<p>"But why? Give me a single convincing reason.&mdash;As to the
idea of going up-country...that's madness pure and simple. How
often did you vow you'd never again take up a country practice,
because of the distances...and the work? How will you be able to
stand it now?...when you're getting on for fifty. You say there's
nothing doing here; but, my opinion is, there's just as much as
you're able for."</p>

<p>This was so exactly Mahony's own belief that he grew violently
angry. "Good God, woman! is there no sympathy in you?...or only
where your children are concerned? I tell you, if I stop here I
shall end by going demented!"</p>

<p>"I never heard such talk. The practice may be slow to
move&mdash;I think a town-practice always would be&mdash;but it'll
come right, I'm sure it will, if you'll <i>only</i> give it the
chance." Here, however, another thought struck her. "But what I
don't understand is, <i>why</i> we're not able to get on. What
becomes of the money you make? There must be something very wrong
somewhere. Hand over the accounts to me; let me look into your
books. With no rent to pay, and three or four hundred coming
in...besides the dividends...oh, would any one else&mdash;any one
but you&mdash;want to throw up a certainty and drag us off
up-country, just when the children are getting big and need decent
companions...and schooling&mdash;what about their
education?&mdash;have you thought of that?...or thought of anything
but your own likes and dislikes?" And as he maintained a stony
silence, she broke out: "I think men are the most impossible
creatures God ever made!" and pressing her face into the pillow
burst into tears.</p>

<p>Mahony set his teeth. If she could not see for herself that it
was a case, for once, of putting him and his needs first, then he
could not help her. To confide in her still went beyond him. Mary
had such a heavy hand. He could hope for no tenderness of approach;
no instinctive understanding meeting him half-way. She would pounce
on his most intimate thoughts and feelings, drag them out into
daylight and anatomise them; would put into words those phantom
fears, and insidious evasions, which he had so far managed to keep
in the twilight where they belonged. He shuddered at the
thought.</p>

<p>But Mary had not finished. Drying her eyes she returned to the
charge. "You say this place is a failure. I deny it, and always
shall. But if it hasn't done as well as it might, there's a reason
for it. It's because you haven't the way with you any longer.
You've lost your manner&mdash;the good, doctor's manner you used to
do so much with. You're too short with people nowadays; and they
resent it; and go to some one who's pleasanter. I heard you just
the other day with that lawyer's wife who called...how you blew her
up! <i>she'll</i> never come again.&mdash;A morbid hypochondriac? I
daresay. But in old days you'd never have told a patient to her
face that she was either shamming or imagining."</p>

<p>"I'm too old to cozen and pander."</p>

<p>"Too old to care, you mean.&mdash;Oh, for God's sake, think what
you're doing! Try to stop on here a little longer, and if it's only
for six months. Listen! I've got an idea." She raised herself on
her elbow. "Why shouldn't we take in boarders?...just to tide us
over till things get easier. This house is really much too big for
us. One nursery would be enough for the children; and there's the
spare room, and the breakfast-room...I could probably fill all
three; and make enough that way to cover our living expenses."</p>

<p>"<i>Boarders?</i>...<i>you?</i> Not while <i>I'm</i> above the
sod!"</p>

<p>The children wilted...oh, it was a dreadful week! Papa never
spoke, and slammed the doors and the gate whenever he went out.
Mamma sat in the bedroom and cried, hastily blowing her nose and
pretending she wasn't, if you happened to look in. And Cook and
Eliza made funny faces, and whispered behind their hands. Cuffy,
mooning about the house pale and dejected, was&mdash;as usual when
Mamma and Papa quarrelled&mdash;harassed by the feeling that
somehow or other he was the guilty person. He tried cosseting
Mamma, hanging round her: he tried talking big to the Dumplings of
what he meant to do when he was a man; he even glanced at the idea
of running away. But none of these things lightened the weight that
lay on his chest. It felt just as it had done the night Luce had
the croup and crowed like a cock.</p>

<p>And then one afternoon Mahony came home transfigured. His bang
of the gate, his very step, as it crunched the gravel, told its own
tale. He ran up the stairs two at a time, calling for Mary; and,
the door of the bedroom shut on them, broke into excited talk. It
appeared that in a chance meeting that day with a fellow-medico
("Pincock, that well-known Richmond man!") he had heard of what
seemed to him "an opening in a thousand," a flourishing practice to
be had for the asking, at a place called Barambogie in the Ovens
District.</p>

<p>"A rising township, my dear, half mining, half agricultural, and
where there has never been but one doctor. He's an old friend of
Pincock's, and is giving up&mdash;after ten years in the
place&mdash;for purely personal reasons...nothing to do with the
practice. It arose through Pincock asking me if I knew of any one
who would like to step into a really good thing. This Rummel wants
to retire, but will wait on of course till he hears of a successor.
Nor is he selling. Whoever goes there has only to walk in and
settle down. Such a chance won't come my way again. I should be mad
to let it slip."</p>

<p>This news rang the knell of any hopes Mary might still have
nursed of bringing him to his senses. She eyed him sombrely as he
stood before her, pale with excitement; and such a wave of
bitterness ran through her that she quickly looked away again,
unable to find any but bitter words to say. In this glance,
however, she had for once really seen him &mdash;had not just
looked, without seeing, after the habit of those who spend their
lives together&mdash;and the result was the amazed reflection: "But
he's got the eyes of a child!...for all his wrinkles and grey
hairs."</p>

<p>Mahony did not notice her silence. He continued to dilate on
what <i>he</i> had said and the other had replied, till, in alarm,
she burst out: "I hope to goodness you've not committed yourself in
any way?...all in the dark as you are."</p>

<p>"Come, come now, my dear!" he half cozened, half fell foul of
her. "Give me credit for at least a ha'p'orth of sense. You surely
don't imagine I showed Pincock my cards? I flatter myself I was
thoroughly off-hand with him...so much so, indeed, that before
night he'll no doubt have cracked the place up to half a dozen
others.&mdash;Come, Mary, come! I'm not quite the fool you imagine.
Nor do I mean to be unreasonable. But I confess my inclination is,
just to slip off and see the place, and make a few confidential
inquiries. There can surely be nothing against that&mdash;can
there?"</p>

<p>There could not. Two days later, he took the early morning train
to the north.</p>

</p>

<p>THE SUN HOTEL,<br>
BARAMBOGIE.</p>

<p>MY OWN DEAR WIFE,</p>

<p>I HOPE YOU GOT MY NOTE ANNOUNCING MY SAFE ARRIVAL. I COULD NOT
WRITE MORE; THE TRAIN WAS LATE AND I TIRED OUT. THE JOURNEY TOOK
EIGHT HOURS AND WAS MOST FATIGUING. ABOUT NOON A NORTH WIND CAME
UP, WITH ITS USUAL EFFECT ON ME OF HEADACHE AND LASSITUDE. THE
CARRIAGE WAS LIKE A BAKING-OVEN. AS FOR THE DUST, I'VE NEVER SEEN
ITS EQUAL. BALLARAT IN SUMMER WAS NOTHING TO IT. IT ROSE IN
WHIRLWINDS TO THE TOPS OF THE GUMS. WE WERE SIMPLY SMOTHERED. BUT
WHAT A COUNTRY THIS OF OURS IS FOR SIZE! YOU HAVE ONLY TO GET AWAY
FROM THE SEA-BOARD AND TRAVEL ACROSS IT, TO BE STAGGERED BY ITS
VASTNESS.&mdash;AND EMPTINESS. MILE AFTER MILE OF BUSH, WITHOUT THE
TRACE OF A SETTLEMENT. AND ANY TOWNSHIPS WE COULD SEE FOR DUST,
VERY SMALL AND MEAN. OF COURSE EVERYTHING LOOKS ITS WORST JUST NOW.
THERE HAVE BEEN NO RAINS HERE YET, AND THEY ARE SADLY NEEDED. GRASS
BURNT TO A CINDER, CREEKS BONE-DRY AND SO ON. HOWEVER AS IT WAS ALL
QUITE NEW TO ME, I FOUND PLENTY TO INTEREST ME. THE LANDSCAPE
IMPROVED AS WE GOT FURTHER NORTH, GREW HILLIER AND MORE WOODED: AND
BEYOND BENALLA WE HAD A FINE VIEW OF THE HIGH RANGES.</p>

<p>SO MUCH FOR THE JOURNEY. AS I MENTIONED, RUMMEL MET ME AT THE
STATION, WALKED TO THE HOTEL WITH ME AND STOPPED FOR A CHAT. HE IS
A MOST AFFABLE FELLOW, WELL UNDER FORTY I SHOULD SAY, TALL AND
HANDSOME AND QUITE THE GENTLEMAN&mdash;I SHALL FIND CONSIDERABLE
DIFFICULTY IN COMING AFTER HIM. I WAS TOO TIRED THAT NIGHT TO GET
MUCH IDEA OF THE PLACE, BUT NOW THAT I HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF DAYS TO
LOOK ABOUT ME, I CAN HONESTLY SAY I AM DELIGHTED WITH IT. TO BEGIN
WITH, I AM MOST COMFORTABLY LODGED; MY BED IS GOOD, THE TABLE
PLENTIFUL, LANDLADY VERY ATTENTIVE. IT IS A LARGER AND MORE
SUBSTANTIAL TOWNSHIP THAN THOSE WE PASSED ON THE WAY UP; THE HOUSES
ARE MOSTLY OF BRICK&mdash;FOR COOLNESS IN SUMMER&mdash;AND ALL HAVE
LUXURIANT GARDENS. THERE IS A VERY PRETTY LITTLE LAKE, OR LAGOON AS
THEY CALL IT HERE, SKIRTED BY TREES AND PLEASANT PATHS; AND WE ARE
SURROUNDED BY WOODED RANGES. VINEYARDS COVER THE PLAINS.</p>

<p>AS TO THE INFORMATION I HAD FROM PINCOCK, IT WAS RATHER UNDER
THAN ABOVE THE MARK. BARAMBOGIE IS UNDOUBTEDLY A RISING PLACE. FOR
ONE THING, THERE'S A GREAT MINE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, THAT HAS ONLY
BEEN PARTIALLY WORKED. THIS IS NOW ABOUT TO BE REORGANISED: AND
WHEN STARTED WILL EMPLOY NO FEWER THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN.
EVERY ONE IS SANGUINE OF IT PAYING.&mdash;I WAS OUT AND ABOUT ALL
YESTERDAY AND AGAIN THIS MORNING, INTRODUCING MYSELF TO PEOPLE. I
HAVE MET WITH THE GREATEST COURTESY AND CIVILITY&mdash;THE BANK
MANAGER WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY I SHOULD BE A REAL ACQUISITION. I
THINK I CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES THAT SOME WILL NOT BE DISPLEASED
TO SEE THE LAST OF RUMMEL. HE IS BY NO MEANS THE UNIVERSAL
FAVOURITE I SHOULD HAVE IMAGINED. BETWEEN OURSELVES, I FANCY HE
TAKES A DROP TOO MUCH. HE IS STILL SEEING PATIENTS, BUT INTENDS
LEAVING IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. THE CHEMIST SAYS I SHOULD EASILY DO
EIGHT HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND PER ANNUM. AND RUMMEL HIMSELF TOLD ME
HE HAS HAD AS MANY AS A HUNDRED MIDWIFERY EASES IN A YEAR. THERE
ARE THREE OR FOUR NICE FAMILIES, SO YOU, MY DEAR, WILL NOT BE
ENTIRELY CUT OFF FROM SOCIETY. IT IS SAID TO BE A SPLENDID WINTER
CLIMATE. EVEN NOW, IN LATE AUTUMN, WE HAVE CLEAR BLUE SKIES AND
BRACING WINDS FROM THE SOUTH. AND WE SHOULD CERTAINLY SAVE. NO ONE
HERE KEEPS MORE THAN ONE SERVANT, AND GRAND ENTERTAINMENTS ARE
UNKNOWN. NO CLUBS EITHER, THANK GOD! YOU KNOW WHAT A DRAWBACK
THEY...OR RATHER THE LACK OF THEM HAS BEEN TO ME AT HAWTHORN.
THEY'RE ALL VERY WELL IF YOU HOLD THEM YOURSELF, BUT PLAY THE
DICKENS WITH A PRACTICE IF YOU DON'T. I SHOULD ONLY BE TOO GLAD TO
SETTLE SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY'RE NON-EXISTENT.</p>

<p>THE DIFFICULTY IS GOING TO BE TO FIND A HOUSE. THERE ARE ONLY
TWO VACANT IN ALL BARAMBOGIE. ONE OF THESE IS IN POOR REPAIR, AND
THE OWNER &mdash;THE LEADING DRAPER&mdash;DECLINES TO DO ANYTHING
TO IT. BESIDES HE WANTS A RENTAL OF EIGHTY POUNDS P.A., ON A FOUR
YEARS' LEASE&mdash;WHICH OF COURSE PUTS IT OUT OF THE QUESTION. THE
OTHER IS SO SMALL THAT NONE OF OUR FURNITURE WOULD GO INTO IT. BUT
WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY; AND I HAVE AN IDEA&mdash;AND I
THINK A BRILLIANT ONE. THERE'S A FINE OLD ODDFELLOWS' HALL HERE,
WHICH IS IN DISUSE AND UP FOR AUCTION. IT'S OF BRICK&mdash;LOOKS
LIKE A CHAPEL&mdash;AND IS SIXTY FEET LONG BY TWENTY BROAD. WELL,
MY PLAN IS TO BUY THIS, AND CONVERT IT INTO A DWELLING-HOUSE. THE
BODY OF THE HALL WILL GIVE US SIX SPLENDID ROOMS, WITH A PASSAGE
DOWN THE MIDDLE, AND WE CAN ADD KITCHEN, SCULLERY, OUTHOUSES, ETC.
I WOULD ALSO THROW OUT A VERANDAH. THERE'S A FAIR PIECE OF LAND
WHICH WE WOULD TURN INTO A GARDEN. THE ALTERATIONS WILL BE EASY TO
MAKE AND NOT COST MUCH; AND THERE WE ARE, WITH OUT AND AWAY THE
BEST HOUSE IN THE TOWN!&mdash;I FEAR, THOUGH, EVEN UNDER THE MOST
FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO USE ALL OUR
FURNITURE HERE. I HAVEN'T YET SEEN A ROOM THAT WOULD HOLD YOUR
WARDROBE, OR THE DINING-ROOM SIDEBOARD.</p>

<p>IF I DECIDE TO STAY, I SHALL LOSE NO TIME IN CONSULTING A
BUILDER. YOU FOR YOUR PART MUST AT ONCE SEE AN AGENT AND PUT THE
HAWTHORN HOUSE IN HIS HANDS. I FEEL SURE WE SHALL HAVE NO
DIFFICULTY IN LETTING IT.</p>

<p>AND NOW I MUST BRING THIS LONG SCRAWL&mdash;IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN
AT VARIOUS ODD MOMENTS&mdash;TO A CLOSE. I HAVE APPOINTED TO SEE
RUMMEL AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON, TO HAVE ANOTHER PARLEY WITH HIM. NOT
THAT I SHALL DEFINITELY FIX ON ANYTHING TILL I HEAR FROM YOU. FROM
NOW ON I INTEND TO TAKE YOUR ADVICE. BUT I DO TRUST THAT WHAT I
HAVE TOLD YOU WILL PROVE TO YOU THAT THIS IS NO WILDGOOSE CHASE,
BUT THE VERY OPENING OF WHICH I AM IN SEARCH. IT DISTRESSES ME MORE
THAN I CAN SAY, WHEN YOU AND I DO NOT SEE EYE TO EYE WITH EACH
OTHER. NOW TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR DEAR SELF, AND KISS THE CHICKS
FOR ME. FORGIVE ME, TOO, ALL MY IRRITABILITY AND BAD TEMPER OF THE
PAST SIX MONTHS. I HAVE HAD A VERY GREAT DEAL TO WORRY ME
&mdash;FAR MORE THAN YOU KNEW, OR THAN I WANTED YOU TO KNOW. IT IS
ENOUGH FOR ONE OF US TO BEAR THE BURDEN. BUT THIS WILL PASS AND
EVERYTHING BE AS OF OLD, IF I CAN ONCE SEE THE PROSPECT OF EARNING
A DECENT INCOME AGAIN. WHICH I AM PERFECTLY SURE I SHALL DO
HERE.</p>

<p>YOUR OWN<br>
R.T.M.</p>

</p>

<p>THE SUN HOTEL,<br></p>

<p>BARAMBOGIE.</p>

<p>MY DEAR MARY,</p>

<p>I MUST SAY YOU ARE THE REVERSE OF ENCOURAGING. YOUR LETTER THREW
ME INTO SUCH A FIT OF LOW SPIRITS THAT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO
ANSWER IT TILL TO-DAY. IT'S BAD ENOUGH BEING ALL ALONE, WITH NEVER
A SOUL TO SPEAK TO, WITHOUT YOU POURING COLD WATER ON EVERYTHING I
SUGGEST. OF COURSE, AS YOU ARE SO DOWN ON MY SCHEME OF REBUILDING
THE ODDFELLOWS' HALL, I WILL LET THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR A
BARGAIN SLIP, AND DISMISS THE IDEA FROM MY MIND. PERHAPS, THOUGH,
YOU WILL TELL ME WHAT WE ARE TO DO&mdash;WITH NOT ANOTHER HOUSE IN
THE PLACE VACANT&mdash;OR AT LEAST NOTHING BIG ENOUGH TO SWING A
CAT IN. AS YOU ARE SO SCATHING ABOUT MY POOR PLANS, YOU HAD BETTER
EVOLVE SOME OF YOUR OWN.</p>

<p>I HAD THE NEWS ABOUT THE MINE ON RELIABLE AUTHORITY; IT WAS NOT,
AS YOU TRY TO MAKE OUT, A MERE WILD RUMOUR. NOR IS WHAT I SAID
ABOUT PEOPLE BEING GLAD TO GET RID OF RUMMEL A PRODUCT OF MY OWN
IMAGINATION. I RECEIVED MORE THAN ONE PLAIN HINT TO THAT EFFECT, IN
THE COURSE OF MY VISITS.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, SINCE I WROTE LAST, I HAVE BEGUN TO DOUBT THE WISDOM OF
SETTLING HERE. IT'S NOT THE HOUSE-QUESTION ALONE. I'VE SEEN
GREATOREX THE DRAPER AGAIN, AND HE HAS SO FAR COME ROUND AS TO
AGREE TO RE-FLOOR THE VERANDAH AND WHITEWASH THE ROOMS, IF I TAKE
THE HOUSE ON HIS TERMS. I REPEAT ONCE MORE, IT IS THE BEST HOUSE IN
BARAMBOGIE. SIX LARGE ROOMS, ALL NECESSARY OUTHOUSES, A SHED FITTED
WITH A SHOWER-BATH, AND A FINE GARDEN&mdash;WE MIGHT INDEED
CONSIDER OURSELVES LUCKY TO GET IT. RUMMEL LIVES IN A REGULAR
HOVEL; THE PARSON IN A FOUR-ROOMED HUT WITH NOT A FOOT OF GROUND TO
IT, NOR ANY VERANDAH TO KEEP OFF THE SUN. GREATOREX'S IS A PALACE
IN COMPARISON. OF COURSE THOUGH, AS YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF SO
STRONGLY AGAINST THE FOUR&mdash;YEARS' LEASE, I SHALL GIVE UP ALL
IDEA OF COMING TO AN AGREEMENT WITH HIM.</p>

<p>BESIDES, AS I SAID ABOVE, I HAVE PRACTICALLY DECIDED NOT TO
REMAIN. YOUR LETTER IS CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. I CAN SEE YOU
HAVE MADE UP YOUR MIND BEFOREHAND NOT TO LIKE THE PLACE. AND IF YOU
WERE UNHAPPY I SHOULD BE WRETCHED, TOO, AND REPROACH MYSELF FOR
HAVING DRAGGED YOU AND THE CHILDREN INTO SO OUTLANDISH AN EXILE. I
QUITE AGREE IT WOULD BE HARD WORK FOR YOU WITH BUT A SINGLE
SERVANT&mdash;BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU, WE SHOULD BE EYED ASKANCE IF WE
TRIED TO KEEP MORE. IN A PLACE LIKE THIS, WHERE THERE IS ONLY ONE
STANDARD OF LIVING, IT WOULD RENDER US MOST UNPOPULAR. BUT EVEN
SHOULD YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, MY ADVICE WOULD BE, NOT TO COME FOR AT
LEAST THREE MONTHS. BY THAT TIME I SHOULD KNOW BETTER HOW THE
PRACTICE WAS SHAPING. OF COURSE THINGS MAY LOOK BRIGHTER FOR ME
WHEN RUMMEL GOES, AND I BEGIN TO GET SOMETHING TO DO. I'VE BEEN
HERE NEARLY A FORTNIGHT NOW, AND HE SHOWS NO MORE SIGNS OF LEAVING
THAN AT FIRST. HE IS STILL ATTENDING PATIENTS; THE PEOPLE RUN AFTER
HIM IN THE STREETS. HE HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY POPULAR; WHICH IS
NOT TO BE WONDERED AT, WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS AND INGRATIATING
MANNERS. ONLY A FEW TRIFLING CASES HAVE COME MY WAY. IT IS VERY
DISHEARTENING. TO ADD TO THIS, I HAVE BEEN FEELING ANYTHING BUT
WELL. THE CHANGE OF WATER HAS UPSET ME. THEN MY BEDROOM IS DARK AND
AIRLESS; AND THE NOISE IN THE HOTEL ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE CRAZY. IT
GOES ON TILL LONG PAST MIDNIGHT AND BEGINS AGAIN BEFORE SIX.</p>

<p>ANOTHER THING THAT WORRIES ME IS THE FACT THAT I SHOULD BE ALONE
OF THE PROFESSION HERE, IF I STAYED. I DARESAY I SHOULD GET USED TO
IT IN TIME; BUT JUST NOW, IN MY POOR STATE, IT WOULD BE AN
ADDITIONAL STRAIN, NEVER TO HAVE A SECOND OPINION TO FALL BACK
ON.&mdash;I DON'T NEED YOU TO TELL ME, MY DEAR, THAT A HUNDRED
CONFINEMENTS IN THE YEAR WOULD BE STIFF WORK. BUT THEY WOULD ALSO
MEAN A PRINCELY INCOME. HOWEVER, I HAVE NO INTENTION OF DRAGGING
YOU HERE AGAINST YOUR WILL: AND SHALL NOW CAST ABOUT FOR SOMETHING
ELSE. I HEARD TO-DAY OF A PLACE CALLED TURRAMUNGI, WHERE THERE IS
ONLY ONE DOCTOR AND HE A BIT OF A DUFFER. I WILL GO OVER BY COACH
ONE MORNING AND SEE HOW THE LAND LIES.</p>

<p>BUT DO TRY AND WRITE MORE CHEERFULLY. I AM SURE YOU HAVE NO NEED
TO BE SO DEPRESSED&mdash;IN OUR PLEASANT HOME, AND WITH THE
CHILDREN TO BEAR YOU COMPANY. I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU HAVE HEARD OF
NO LIKELY TENANTS. WE OUGHT TO GET A RENT OF AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED,
WITHOUT TAXES. AS I SAID BEFORE, YOUR WARDROBE AND THE SIDEBOARD
WILL HAVE TO BE SOLD. PERHAPS THE INCOMING TENANT WILL TAKE
THEM.</p>

<p>THE FLIES ARE VERY TROUBLESOME TO-DAY. I HAVE CONSTANTLY TO FLAP
MY HANDKERCHIEF WHILE I WRITE.</p>

<p>SHALL HOPE TO SEND YOU BETTER NEWS OF MYSELF NEXT TIME.</p>

<p>THE SUN HOTEL,<br>
BARAMBOGIE.</p>

<p>MY DEAR WIFE,</p>

<p>A LINE IN GREAT HASTE. I HAVE JUST SEEN AN ADVERTISEMENT IN THE
"ARGUS" CALLING FOR APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAL OFFICER TO THE
BOORANDOORA LODGE, AND HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO APPLY. I HAVE
WRITTEN OFF POSTHASTE FOR FURTHER PARTICULARS, IN ORDER TO GET MY
APPLICATION IN BEFORE FRIDAY. AFTER SPENDING CLOSE ON THREE WEEKS
HERE, I HAVE DECIDED ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT IT WOULD BE INFINITELY
MORE SATISFACTORY TO MAKE AN EXTRA COUPLE OF HUNDRED A YEAR AT
HAWTHORN, WITH A DECENT HOUSE BEHIND US, THAN TO BURY OURSELVES IN
THIS WILD BUSH. A THIRD LODGE WOULD GIVE A TREMENDOUS FILLIP TO THE
PRACTICE. AND THE MORE I SEE OF THIS PLACE, THE LESS I LIKE IT.</p>

<p>OF COURSE, MY APPLICATION MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED. LAMBERT, WHO
HAD THE BOORANDOORA LAST, HELD IT AT TWENTY-ONE SHILLINGS A HEAD,
AND FOUND MEDICINE. I MEAN TO TENDER SEVENTEEN-AND-SIX, WITHOUT
PHYSIC. GRAVES, I KNOW, WON'T LOOK AT THEM UNDER TWENTY. SO I THINK
I OUGHT TO STAND A VERY GOOD CHANCE. DON'T TAKE ANY FURTHER STEPS
ABOUT THE HOUSE IN THE MEANWHILE.</p>

<p>SINCE I WROTE LAST I HAVE HAD A LITTLE MORE TO DO. I WAS CALLED
OUT SEVERAL MILES YESTERDAY. AND THE PEOPLE I WENT TO TOLD ME THAT
IF I HAD NOT BEEN HERE, THEY WOULD HAVE SENT FOR THE MAN AT
TURRAMUNGI. SO YOU SEE RUMMEL IS NOT PERSONA GRATA EVERYWHERE. HE
IS STILL ABOUT, AND AS MUCH IN MY WAY AS EVER; FOR AS LONG AS HE IS
ON THE SPOT, PEOPLE WON'T CONSULT ANY ONE ELSE. I WISH TO GOD I HAD
NOT BEEN IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME. HOWEVER, ONE THING MAKES ME MORE
HOPEFUL: THE DATE OF HIS AUCTION IS FIXED AT LAST, FOR MONDAY
NEXT.</p>

<p>YOUR OWN</p>

<p>THE SUN HOTEL,<br>
BARAMBOGIE.</p>

<p>MY DARLING MARY,</p>

<p>SO YOU APPROVE, DO YOU, OF MY IDEA OF PUTTING IN FOR THE
BOORANDOORA? I GOT THE INFORMATION I WANTED FROM THE SECRETARY OF
THE LODGE; AND IF I RESOLVE TO OFFER MY SERVICES, SHALL DO SO FOR
THE SUM I NAMED. IT IS ALL VERY WELL, MY DEAR, TO TALK ABOUT IT
BEING BENEATH MY DIGNITY TO UNDERBID OTHERS, AND TO ASK HOW I
MYSELF SHOULD ONCE HAVE CHARACTERISED SUCH A PROCEEDING.
(PERSONALLY, I THINK YOU MIGHT KEEP REMARKS OF THIS KIND TO
YOURSELF.) WHAT I DO IS DONE FOR YOUR SAKE. IF I COULD GET THIS
THIRD LODGE, IT MIGHT SAVE YOU HAVING TO TURN OUT AND PART WITH
YOUR FURNITURE; AND TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE I AM READY TO SACRIFICE
MY PROFESSIONAL PRIDE. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHERS, YOUNGER MEN THAN
I, WHO ARE ONLY TOO READY TO STEP IN. AND I LOOK ON IT AS MY SOLE
REMAINING CHANCE TO EARN A DECENT LIVELIHOOD WITHIN REACH OF
CIVILISATION.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, I MUST CONFESS, I HAVE AGAIN BECOME SOMEWHAT UNDECIDED.
THE FACT IS, RUMMEL HAS GONE AT LAST: AND HE GAVE ME HIS WORD, ON
LEAVING, THAT HE WOULD NEVER COME BACK. THE AUCTION TOOK PLACE AS
ARRANGED; HOUSE AND GROUND SELLING FOR A HUNDRED AND NINETY POUNDS.
SINCE HE WENT, I HAVE BEEN GENUINELY BUSY. THE PARSON IS ILL WITH
INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER; AND I WAS CALLED OUT YESTERDAY A
DISTANCE OF FIVE MILES. THE HIRE OF A BUGGY COSTS
SEVEN-AND-SIX&mdash;LESS THAN HALF WHAT I HAD TO PAY IN HAWTHORN.
THIS AFTERNOON I GO BY TRAIN TO MIRRAWARRA, AND SHALL WALK BACK. IT
BECOMES DAILY MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THERE IS A VERY FINE PRACTICE
TO BE DONE HERE. AND EVERY ONE I MEET IMPLORES ME TO STAY. SOME,
INDEED, GROW QUITE PLAINTIVE AT THE IDEA OF LOSING ME.</p>

<p>I HAVE ALSO HAD A PLEASANT SURPRISE ABOUT THE HOUSE. GREATOREX
NOW SAYS HE IS WILLING TO LET FOR THREE YEARS INSTEAD OF FOUR, IF I
PAY THE FIRST YEAR'S RENT IN ADVANCE. THIS SEEMS TO ME AN EXTREMELY
FAIR OFFER. YOU SEE IT WOULD ONLY BE LIKE PAYING A SMALL SUM DOWN
FOR THE PRACTICE. I AM GOING OVER THE HOUSE WITH HIM AGAIN
TO-MORROW, AND WILL THEN LET YOU KNOW WHAT I DECIDE. THE POINT AT
ISSUE IS, SHOULD I NOT DO BETTER TO ACCEPT THIS CERTAIN OPENING,
WITH ALL ITS DRAWBACKS, THAN TAKE THE UNCERTAIN CHANCE OF HAWTHORN
WITH A THIRD LODGE...IF I GET IT!</p>

<p>YOUR VERY OWN</p>

<p>R.T.M.</p>

</p>

<p>THE SUN HOTEL,<br>
BARAMBOGIE.</p>

<p>MY OWN DEAR WIFE,</p>

<p>WELL! THE DIE IS EAST; I HAVE FINALLY MADE UP MY MIND TO REMAIN
IN BARAMBOGIE. I DID NOT PUT IN FOR THE LODGE AFTER ALL, BUT
RESOLVED TO GIVE THIS PLACE A FURTHER TEN DAYS' TRIAL. AND WELL
THAT I DID! FOR THE PRACTICE HAS LOOKED UP WITH A VENGEANCE: IT IS
NOW AS PLAIN AS A PIKESTAFF THAT I HAVE CAPITAL PROSPECTS HERE, AND
SHOULD BE A FOOL INDEED TO LET THEM SLIDE. IF I HAD NOT POPPED IN
WHEN I DID, THERE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN OTHERS&mdash;AND, FOR
THAT MATTER, I AM STILL NOT QUITE SURE THERE MAY NOT BE ANOTHER
SETTLING. IN THE MEANTIME I AM SEEING FRESH PATIENTS DAILY, AND
HAVE NOT HAD MY CLOTHES OFF FOR THE PAST TWO NIGHTS. THE DAY BEFORE
YESTERDAY I WAS CALLED TEN MILES OUT TO ATTEND A CASE WHICH GUTHRIE
OF COORA HAS NEGLECTED: AND I HAVE BEEN BESPOKEN FOR THREE FUTURE
EVENTS. THIS MORNING I DROVE SEVEN MILES INTO THE BUSH; FOR WHICH I
SHALL CHARGE FIVE GUINEAS. IN THE MONTH I HAVE BEEN HERE&mdash;TEN
DAYS WITHOUT RUMMEL&mdash;I HAVE TAKEN FIFTEEN POUNDS AND BOOKED
CLOSE ON FIFTY. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? I FEEL QUITE SURE I
SHALL EASILY TOUCH A THOUSAND A YEAR. OF COURSE IT WILL MEAN HARD
WORK, BUT THE MERE PROSPECT OF SUCH A THING KEYS ME UP. IT WAS THE
DOING NOTHING AT HAWTHORN THAT PREYED SO ON MY MIND. IF ONLY I CAN
EARN A GOOD INCOME, AND PROVIDE FOR YOU AND THE DARLINGS IN THE
STYLE TO WHICH YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED, I SHALL BE A HAPPY MAN ONCE
MORE.</p>

<p>THE PEOPLE HERE ARE OVERJOYED AT THE PROSPECT OF KEEPING ME.
THEY CONTINUE TO DECLARE I CANNOT FAIL TO SUCCEED. EVERYBODY IS
MOST CIVIL, AND ALL INVITE ME TO DRINK WITH THEM. I HAVE
CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN MAKING THEM UNDERSTAND THAT I DO NOT GO
IN FOR THAT KIND OF THING. IT SOMETIMES NEEDS A GOOD DEAL OF TACT
TO PUT THEM OFF WITHOUT GIVING OFFENCE: BUT SO FAR I HAVE MANAGED
PRETTY WELL. FROM ALL I NOW HEAR, RUMMEL MUST HAVE BEEN A SEASONED
DRINKER&mdash;A REGULAR TOPER. I SAW THE BANK MANAGER TO-DAY. HE
WAS VERY QUEER. HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN TAKING NOBBLERS. HE HAS BEEN IN
CHARGE OF THE BANK HERE FOR OVER TWENTY-YEARS, AND THINKS THERE IS
NO PLACE LIKE BARAMBOGIE. VOWS I SHALL MAKE MY FORTUNE.</p>

<p>GREATOREX PROMISES TO SET ABOUT THE REPAIRS WITHOUT DELAY. MY
PRIVATE OPINION IS, HE'S IN HIGH FEATHER AT SECURING SUCH GOOD AND
CAREFUL TENANTS. I WENT OVER THE HOUSE WITH HIM AGAIN YESTERDAY.
THE ROOMS ARE NOT QUITE AS LARGE AS I THOUGHT&mdash;I WILL SEND YOU
THE EXACT MEASUREMENTS IN A DAY OR TWO&mdash;BUT ALL HAVE FRENCH
WINDOWS AND ARE FITTED WITH VENETIAN BLINDS. THE GARDEN IS WELL
STOCKED WITH FRUIT, FLOWERS AND VEGETABLES. I SHALL KEEP A MAN TO
LOOK AFTER IT. I THINK YOU HAD BETTER TRY AND INDUCE ONE OF THE
SERVANTS FROM HOME TO ACCOMPANY YOU. PERHAPS ELIZA WOULD COME; AS
THE CHILDREN ARE USED TO HER. HERE THERE IS LITTLE OR NOTHING IN
THAT LINE TO BE HAD. SLIPSHOD DOLLOPS DEMAND TEN SHILLINGS A WEEK.
THE PARSON KEEPS NONE; HAS NO ROOM FOR ANY.</p>

<p>ARCHDEACON COOTE OF TARALGA CALLED YESTERDAY, AND MADE QUITE A
FUSS OVER ME. I HAVE ALSO BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE WIFE OF ONE OF THE
LEADING SQUATTERS. LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE, SHE SAYS IT WILL BE A
RED-LETTER DAY FOR THE PLACE IF WE COME, AND LOOKS EAGERLY FORWARD
TO MAKING YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.</p>

<p>NOW, IF ONLY WE CAN LET THE HOUSE! THE MERE POSSIBILITY OF THIS,
AND OF OUR BEING ALL TOGETHER ONCE MORE MAKES ME WILDLY HAPPY. TELL
THE CHICKS THERE IS A SPLENDID SUMMERHOUSE IN THE NEW GARDEN, AND I
WILL SEE TO IT THAT A SWING IS PUT UP FOR THEM. THEY SHALL HAVE
EVERYTHING THEY WANT HERE.</p>

<p>YOUR OWN OLD HUSBAND,<br></p>

<p>RICHARD TOWNSHEND MAHONY.</p>

</p>

<p>THE SUN HOTEL,<br>
BARAMBOGIE.</p>

<p>MY DEAR MARY,</p>

<p>I AM SORRY YOU WRITE IN SUCH LOW SPIRITS. I AGREE WITH YOU, IT
IS MOST UNFORTUNATE THAT WE ARE OBLIGED TO BREAK UP OUR HOME; BUT
IT WAS BLACKEST FOLLY ON MY PART EVER TO BUILD THAT HOUSE, AND NOW
I AM PUNISHED FOR IT. I CANNOT SAY HOW DEEPLY I REGRET HAVING TO
ASK YOU AND THE LITTLE ONES TO PUT UP WITH BUSH LIFE; AND YOU MAY
REST ASSURED I SHOULD NOT DO SO, IF I SAW ANY OTHER WAY OUT. BUT IT
IS THIS OR NOTHING.</p>

<p>IT DOESN'T MEND MATTERS TO HAVE YOU CARPING AT THE CLASS OF
PERSON WE SHALL NEED TO ASSOCIATE WITH. FOR GOODNESS' SAKE, DON'T
GO PUTTING IDEAS OF THAT KIND INTO THE CHILDREN'S HEADS! WE ARE ALL
GOD'S CREATURES; AND THE SOONER WE SHAKE OFF THE INCUBUS OF A FALSE
AND SNOBBISH PRIDE, THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR US. THERE ARE GOOD
AND WORTHY PEOPLE TO BE FOUND IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE.</p>

<p>YOU ARE UTTERLY WRONG IN YOUR SUSPICIONS THAT I AM LETTING
MYSELF BE FLATTERED AND BAMBOOZLED INTO STAYING. BUT THERE!...YOU
NEVER DO THINK ANYONE BUT YOURSELF HAS A PARTICLE OF JUDGMENT.</p>

<p>NO, THERE'S NOTHING IN THE WAY OF A SCHOOL&mdash;EXCEPT, OF
COURSE, THE STATE SCHOOL. YOU HAD BETTER FIND OUT WHAT A GOVERNESS
WOULD COST. ABOUT THE HOUSE, I AM AFRAID IT IS REALLY NOT VERY MUCH
BIGGER THAN OUR FIRST COTTAGE IN WEBSTER ST&mdash;THE WOODEN
ONE&mdash;BEFORE WE MADE THOSE ADDITIONS TO IT. I ENCLOSE THE
MEASUREMENTS OF THE ROOMS. YOU WILL SEE THAT THE DRAWING-ROOM AND
CHIEF BEDROOM ARE THE SAME SIZE&mdash;12 BY 13&mdash;THE OTHERS
SOMEWHAT SMALLER. IT WILL BE AS WELL TO SELL THE PIERGLASS AND THE
DRAWING-ROOM CHIFFONIER. AND IT'S NO GOOD BRINGING THE DINING-ROOM
TABLE, OR THE BIG SOFA...OR THE TALL GLASS BOOKCASE. OR THE THREE
LARGE WARDROBES EITHER; THEY WOULDN'T GO IN AT THE DOORS. BUT DO
TRY AND NOT FRET TOO MUCH OVER SACRIFICING THESE THINGS. A FEW
YEARS HERE, AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO REPLACE THEM; AND THEN WE WILL
PITCH OUR TENT SOMEWHERE MORE TO YOUR LIKING.</p>

<p>I RECKON THE MOVE WILL COST US ABOUT A HUNDRED POUNDS.</p>

<p>I AM STILL BUSY. BARAMBOGIE IS ANYTHING BUT THE DEAD-AND-ALIVE
PLACE YOU IMAGINE. NO LESS THAN SIX COACHES A DAY DRAW UP AT THIS
HOTEL. THE WEATHER CONTINUES FINE. I HAVE A GOOD APPETITE: IT SUITS
ME TO BE SO MUCH IN THE OPEN AIR, INSTEAD OF COOPED UP IN THAT DULL
SURGERY. I WISH I SLEPT BETTER THOUGH. THE NOISE IN THE HOTEL
CONTINUES UNABATED. I HAVE THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY IN GETTING TO
SLEEP, OR IN REMAINING ASLEEP WHEN I DO. THE LEAST SOUND DISTURBS
ME&mdash;AND THEN I AM INSTANTLY WIDE AWAKE. THE OTHER NIGHT,
THOUGH, I HAD A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. SOMETHING VERY QUEER
HAPPENED TO ME. I DROPPED OFF TOWARDS THREE AND HAD BEEN ASLEEP FOR
ABOUT AN HOUR&mdash;FAST ASLEEP&mdash;WHEN SOME NOISE OR OTHER, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT, WAKENED ME WITH A TERRIFIC START...ONE OF THOSE
FEARFUL JERKS AWAKE WHICH THE NIGHTBELL USED TO GIVE ME. EXCEPT
THAT IN THOSE DAYS, I WAS ALL THERE IN AN INSTANT. HERE, I COULDN'T
FOR THE LIFE OF ME COME BACK, AND WENT THROUGH A FEW MOST AWFUL
SECONDS, ABSOLUTELY INCAPABLE OF RECOLLECTION. THERE I SAT, BOLT
UPRIGHT, MY HEART BEATING LIKE A SLEDGEHAMMER, POWERLESS TO
REMEMBER WHO I WAS, WHERE I WAS OR WHAT I WAS DOING. MY BRAIN
SEEMED LIKE AN EMPTY SHELL...OR A WATCH WITH ALL THE WORKS GONE OUT
OF IT. OR IF YOU CAN IMAGINE A KIND OF MENTAL SUFFOCATION, A HORRID
STRUGGLE FOR BREATH ON THE PART OF THE BRAIN. AND WHEN, BY SHEER
FORCE OF WILL, I HAD SUCCEEDED IN FIGHTING BACK TO A CONSCIOUSNESS
OF MY PERSONAL IDENTITY, I STILL COULD NOT LOCATE MYSELF, BUT
IMAGINED I WAS AT HOME, AND FUMBLED FOR THE MATCHES ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THE BED! IT WAS MOST UNPLEASANT&mdash;A REAL DISSOCIATION
FOR THE TIME BEING&mdash;AND I DID NOT SLEEP AGAIN, DREADING A
RETURN. I THINK IT CAME FROM WORRY&mdash;I HAVE BEEN MUCH UPSET.
YOUR LETTER...AND ALL YOU SAID IN IT...YOUR GRIEF AND
DISAPPOINTMENT. ADD TO THIS THAT I HAD NO PROPER REST THE NIGHT
BEFORE, HAVING BEEN UP WITH A PATIENT TILL THREE. I SHALL BE MORE
CAREFUL IN FUTURE.</p>

<p>YOUR OWN<br>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-1-6" id="ch-3-1-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>It was nearing eleven, and a chilly, cloudy night, when the
little party, flanked by Eliza, alighted on the platform at
Barambogie where for nearly an hour Mahony had paced to and fro.
They were the only passengers to leave the train; which straightway
puffed off again; and since the man hired by Mahony to transport
the baggage was late in arriving, there was nothing for it but to
wait till he came. The stationmaster, having lingered for a time,
turned out the solitary lamp and departed; and there they stood, a
forlorn little group, round a tumulus of luggage. It was pitch
dark; not a single homely light shone out, to tell of a human
settlement; not the faintest sound broke the silence. To Mary it
seemed as if they had been dumped down in the very heart of
nowhere.</p>

<p>But now came the man wheeling a truck; and straightway a wordy
dispute broke out between him and Richard, in which she had to act
as peacemaker. Boxes and portmanteaux were loaded up; carpet-bags,
baskets, bundles counted and arranged: all by the light of a
lantern. Richard, agog with excitement, had to be kept from waking
the twins, who had dropped asleep again on top of the trunks. And
all the while an overtired and captious Cuffy plucked at her
sleeve. "Is this the bush, Mamma?...is <i>this</i> the bush?
<i>Where?</i> I don't see it!"</p>

<p>The little procession started, headed by the man with truck and
lantern, the Dumplings riding one in Richard's arms, one in
Eliza's, she and Cuffy bringing up the rear. Leaving the station
behind them, they walked on till they came to a broad road,
flour-soft to the feet, Cuffy kicking and shuffling up the dust to
the peevish whine of: "What <i>sort</i> of a bush, Mamma?" and
passed in single file down a long narrow right-of-way, between two
paling fences.</p>

<p>On emerging, they faced something flat and black and mysterious.
Mary started. "Whatever's that?"</p>

<p>"The Lagoon, my dear, the Lagoon! The house fronts it, you know.
Has the best outlook of any in the town."</p>

<p>(For the children to fall into!...<i>and</i> mosquitoes.)</p>

<p>Long after every one else was asleep Mary lay and listened...and
listened. It was years since she had lived anywhere but in a town;
and this house seemed so lonely, so open to intruders. The leaves
rustling in the garden, each fresh flap of the venetians startled
her afresh; and in spite of the long, tiring journey, and the
arduous days that had preceded it, she could not compose herself to
sleep. And when at last she did fall into an uneasy doze, she was
jerked back to consciousness in what seemed the minute after, by a
shrill and piercing scream&mdash;a kind of prolonged shriek, that
rent and tore at the air.</p>

<p>"Richard!...oh, Richard, what in the world is that?"</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, my dear. It's only the mill whistle."</p>

<p>"A mill? So close?"</p>

<p>"It's all right, Mary; you'll soon get used to it. Myself I
hardly notice it now. And it doesn't last long. There! you see, it
has stopped already."</p>

<p>His attempt to make light of the appalling din had something
pathetic about it. Mary bit back her dismay.</p>

<p>And it was the same in the morning, when he led her round house
and garden: he skimmed airily over the drawbacks&mdash;the distance
of the kitchen from the house; the poor water-supply; the wretched
little box of a surgery; the great heat of even this late autumn
day&mdash;to belaud the house's privacy, separated as it was from
the rest of the township by the width of the Lagoon; the thickness
of the brick walls; the shade and coolness ensured by an all-round
verandah. And though daylight, and what it shewed up, only served
to render Mary more and more dubious, she had not the heart on this
first morning to damp him by saying what she really thought.
Instead, her tour of inspection over, she buckled to her mammoth
job of bringing comfort out of chaos: putting up beds and dressers;
unpacking the crockery; cutting down curtains and carpets, and
laying oilcloth; working dusty and dishevelled, by the light of a
candle, till long past midnight for many a night. While Richard,
his professional visits over, undertook to mind and amuse the
children, who were sadly in her way, dashing about helter-skelter,
pale with the excitement of the new.</p>

<p>For, oh what a lovely house this was!&mdash;Long before any one
else was astir, Cuffy had pattered out barefoot to explore; and,
all his life after, he loved an empty house for its sake. It had
nothing but doors, which spelt freedom: even the windows were
doors. There were no stairs. A passage went right down the middle,
with a door at each end which always stood open, and three
room-doors on each side. You could run out of any of the windows
and tear round the verandah, to play Hide-and-Seek or Hi-spy-hi.
And not even Eliza was there to say: "Don't!" or "You mustn't!" She
was in the far-away kitchen, scrubbing or washing up. They had
breakfast off a packing-case, which was great fun; and Papa was so
nice, too. The very first morning he explained what the bush meant;
and took them all out walking to find it; and then Cuffy learnt
that it was not <i>one</i> bush he had come to see but lots of
bushes; with trees so high that, even if you almost broke your neck
bending back, you couldn't see the end of them.</p>

<p>Dancing ahead of Papa, who held hands with the Dumplings, and
sometimes walking backwards to hear better, Cuffy fired question
after question. How did the bush get there? Why did nobody live in
it? What were all the holes full of water? Why were they abandoned?
Why did people dig for gold? How did they do it? Why was
money?&mdash;a fusillade of questions, to which on this day he got
full and patient answers. Papa gave them each a threepenny bit,
too, to spend as they liked. The twins carried theirs squeezed
tight to show Mamma; but he put his in his pocket.</p>

<p>On the way home they went along a street where there were lots
of little shops. Men were leaning against the verandah posts,
smoking and spitting; and other men came to the doors and stared.
Papa was very polite to them, and said "Good morning!" to everybody
with a little bow, and whether they did or not. And sometimes he
said as well: "Yes, these are my youngsters! Don't you think I've
reason to be proud of them?"...and as often as this happened, Cuffy
felt uncomfortable. For these weren't the sort of men you stopped
and talked to: you just said good morning and went home. Besides,
they didn't seem as if they <i>wanted</i> to speak to you. They
didn't take their pipes out; and some of them looked as if they
thought Papa was funny...or silly. Two winked at each other when
they thought he wasn't looking&mdash;made eyes like Cook and Eliza
used to do.</p>

<p>Then at a hotel they met a fat, red-faced man&mdash;the
landlord, Papa said &mdash;who seemed at first to be going to be
nicer. When Papa pushed them forward and said: "My young fry
arrived at last, you see!" he smiled back and said: "And a very
jolly little set of nippers, too! Pleased to know you, missies! How
do, sir, how do! Now what will yours be?"</p>

<p>"Cuthbert Hamilton Townshend-Mahony," replied Cuffy,
lightning-quick and politely. He was dumbfounded by the roar of
laughter that went up at his words; not only the landlord laughed,
but lots of larrikins, who stood round the bar. Even Papa laughed a
little, in a funny, tight way.</p>

<p>Mamma didn't though. Cuffy heard them talking, and she sounded
cross. "Surely, Richard, you needn't drag the children in as
well?"</p>

<p>Papa was snappy. "I don't think, Mary, you quite realise how
necessary it is for me to leave no stone unturned."</p>

<p>"I can't help it. I'm not going to have my children mixed up in
the affair." When Mamma was cross she always said "<i>my</i>
children."</p>

<p>Cuffy didn't wait to hear more. He ran down the garden, where he
mooned about till dinner-time. He wouldn't ever&mdash;no, he
wouldn't!&mdash;go down the street where those horrid men were
again. And if he saw them, he'd stamp his feet at them and call
them nasty names. And he'd tell Papa not to&mdash;he wouldn't let
him; he'd hold on to his coat. For they didn't like Papa
either.</p>

<p>"Ooo...tum on! Us'll dance, too," cried the twins. And taking
hands they hopped and capered about the drawing-room, their little
starched white petticoats flaring as they swung. For Papa was
dancing with Mamma. He had seized her by the waist and polked her
up the passage, and now was whirling her round, she trying to get
loose and crying: "Stop, Richard, stop! You'll make me sick." But
Papa just laughed and twirled on, the Dumplings faithfully
imitating him, till, crash, bang! a vase of Parian marble on the
big centre table lost its balance, toppled over and was smashed to
atoms.</p>

<p>"There!...that's just what I expected. There's no room here for
such goings-on," said Mary as she stooped to pick up the
fragments.</p>

<p>It came of her having called Richard in to view the
drawing-room, where for over a week she had stitched and hammered,
or sat perched on the top rung of a step-ladder. Herself she was
not displeased with her work; though she mourned the absence of the
inlaid secretaire, the card-table, the ottoman. These things were
still in the outhouse, in their travelling-cases; and there they
would have to remain. The Collard and Collard took up nearly the
whole of one wall; the round rosewood table devoured the
floor-space; everything was much too large. And the best bits, the
Parisian gilt-legged tables and gilt-framed mirrors, made
absolutely no show, huddled together as they were.</p>

<p>But Richard went into ecstasies. "They'll never have seen a room
like it!&mdash;the people here. We'll show them what's what, wife,
eh?...make 'em open their eyes. Mary! I prophesy you'll have the
whole township come trooping over the Lagoon to call. We shall need
to charge 'em admission."&mdash;and therewith he had seized and
swung her round. So undignified...before Eliza. Besides egging the
children on to do likewise.</p>

<p>But there was no damping Richard just now. Though a fortnight
had passed, he was still in the simmer of excitement into which
their coming had thrown him. While she stitched, even while she
turned the handle of the sewing-machine, he would stand at her side
and talk, and talk, in a voice that was either pitched just a shade
too high, or was husky and tremulous. The separation had plainly
been too much for him. His joy at getting them again was not to be
kept within bounds.</p>

<p>"You're absolutely all I've got, you know...you and the
children."</p>

<p>Which was quite literally true: so true that, at times, Mary
would find herself haunted by the unpleasant vision of a funeral at
which it was not possible to fill a single coach with mourners.
Richard&mdash;to be followed to his grave by the doctor who
had-attended him, the parson who was to bury him...and not a soul
besides. Her heart contracted at the disgrace of the thing: the
shame of letting the world know how little he had cared for anyone,
or been cared for in return.</p>

<p>Impatiently she shook her head and turned to listen to voices in
the passage. They were those of Richard and a patient; but chiefly
Richard's. For he had carried his talkative fit over to strangers
as well...and Mary sometimes wondered what they thought of him:
these small shopkeepers and farmers and vinegrowers and licensed
publicans. Well, at any rate, they wouldn't be able to bring the
usual accusation against him, of stiff-necked reserve. The truth
was, they just came in for their share of his all-pervading good
humour. The children, too. Had he always made so much of the
children, they would have felt more at home with him, and he have
had less cause for jealous grumbles. He even unearthed his old
flute, screwed the parts together, and to Cuffy's enchantment
played them his one-time show-piece, <i>The Minstrel Boy</i>. And
it was the same with everything. He vowed the Barambogie bread to
be the best, the butter the sweetest he had ever tasted: going so
far as to compliment the astonished tradespeople on their
achievements. And Mary, watching in silence, thought how pleasant
all this was...and how unnatural...and waited for the moment to
come when he would drop headlong from the skies.</p>

<p>In waiting, her head with its high Spanish comb bent low over
her work, she gave the rein to various private worries of her own.
For instance she saw quite clearly that Eliza's stay with them
would not be a long one. Forgetful of past favours, of the expense
they had been at in bringing her there, Eliza was already darkly
hinting her opinion of the place; of the detached kitchen; the
dust, the solitude. Again, the want of a proper waiting-room for
patients was proving a great trial. The dining-room seemed never
their own. More serious was the risk the children thereby ran of
catching some infectious illness. Then, she sometimes felt very
uneasy about Richard. In spite of his exuberance, he looked
anything but well. The bout of dysentery he had suffered from, on
first arriving, had evidently been graver than he cared to admit.
His colour was bad, his appetite poor; while as for sleep, if he
managed four consecutive hours of a night he counted himself lucky.
And even then it wasn't a restful sleep; for he had got the absurd
idea in his head that he might not hear the nightbell&mdash;in this
tiny house!&mdash;and at the least sound was awake and sitting up.
Again, almost every day brought a long trudge into the bush, from
which he came home too tired to eat. And Mary's old fear revived.
Would he ever be able at his age to stand the wear and tear of the
work? especially as the practice grew, and he became more widely
known.</p>

<p>But, even as she asked herself the question, another doubt flew
at her. Was there any real prospect of the practice growing, and
him retrieving his shattered fortunes? Or had he, in burying
himself in this wild bush, committed the crowning folly of his
life? And, of the two, this fear ate the deeper. For she thought he
<i>might</i> have so husbanded his strength as to carry on for a
few years; but, the more she saw of place and people, the slenderer
grew her belief that there was money to be made there. How anybody
in his five senses could have professed to see in Barambogie what
Richard did&mdash;oh! <i>No</i> one but Richard could have so
deceived himself. Of all the dead-and-alive holes she had ever been
in, this was the deadest. Only two, trains a day called there, with
eight hours between. The railway station was mostly closed and
deserted, the stationmaster to be found playing euchre at the
"Sun." Quite a quarter of the shops in the main street were boarded
up; the shafts round the township had all been worked out or
abandoned. As for the tale of the big mine...well, she considered
that had been just a bait with which to hook a simple fish. How she
did wish she had somebody to talk to! Richard was no use at
all...in his present mood. To the few feelers she threw out, he
declared himself exaggeratedly well content. Though the number of
patients was still not great, his calls into the bush were royally
paid. It was five guineas here, ten there; as compared with the
petty fees he had commanded at Hawthorn. "Surely, my dear, if money
flows in at this rate, we can put up with a few slight
drawbacks?"</p>

<p>Such as the flour mill, thought Mary grimly. This dreadful mill!
Would any but a man so complacently have planked them down next
door to it? It entirely spoilt the garden, with its noise and dust.
Then, the mill-hands who passed to and fro, or sat outside the
fence, were a very rough lot; and five times a day you had to stop
in what you were saying and wait for the shriek of the
steam-whistle to subside. Except for the railway station, their
house and the mill stood alone on this side of the Lagoon, and were
quite five minutes' walk from the township. Richard hugged himself
with his privacy, and it certainly was nicer to be away from shops
and public-houses. But, for the practice, their seclusion was a
real disadvantage. Rummel had lived in the main street; and his
surgery had been as handy for people to drop into for, say, a cut
finger or a black eye, as was now the chemist's shop. Then, the
Lagoon itself...this view of which Richard had made so much! After
the rains, when there was some water in it, it might be all right;
but just now it was more than three parts dry, and most unsightly.
You saw the bare cracked earth of its bottom, not to speak of the
rubbish, the old tins and boots and broken china, that had been
thrown into it when full. And the mosquitoes! She had been obliged
to put netting round all their beds; and what it would be like in
summer passed imagining.</p>

<p>From such reflections, in the weeks and months that followed,
she had nothing but work to distract her. The society airily
promised her by Richard failed to materialise. She received just
three callers. And only one of these&mdash;the Bank Manager's wife,
a young thing, newly wed&mdash;was worth considering. The
stationmaster's...the stationmaster himself was an educated man,
with whom even Richard enjoyed a chat; but he had married beneath
him...a dressmaker, if report spoke true. Mrs. Cameron, wife of the
Clerk of the Court, had lived so long in Barambogie that she had
gone queer from it. Nor was it feasible to ask the old couple over
of an evening, for cards or music; for by then old Cameron was so
fuddled that he couldn't tell a knave from a king. The parson was
also an odd fish, and a widower without family; the Presbyterian
minister unmarried. The poor children had no playfellows, no
companions. Oh, not for herself, but for those who were more to her
than herself, Mary's heart, was often very hot and sore.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she put her shoulder to the wheel with all her old
spirit; rising betimes to bath and dress the children, cutting out
and making their clothes, superintending the washing and ironing,
cooking the meals; and, when Eliza passed and a young untrained
servant took her place, doing the lion's share towards keeping the
house in the spotless state Richard loved and her own sense of
nicety demanded. But the work told on her. And not alone because it
was harder. In Hawthorn, she had laboured to some end; Richard had
had to be re-established, connections formed, their own nice house
tended. All of which had given her mind an upward lift. Here, where
no future beckoned, it seemed just a matter of toiling for toil's
sake. The consequence was, she tired much more readily; her legs
ached, her feet throbbed, and the crow's-feet began to gather round
her eyes. She was paying of course, she told herself, for those
long years of luxury and idleness, in which Richard had been
against her lifting a finger. And it was no easy thing to buckle to
again, now that she was "getting on," "going downhill": Mary being
come to within a twelve-month of her fortieth year.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-3-1-7" id="ch-3-1-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>"Cousin Emmy, tell about little Jacky."</p>

<p>"Little Jacky what died."</p>

<p>"No, <i>don't</i>! Tell what the gumtrees talk."</p>

<p>Cuffy hated the tale of Baby Jacky's illness and death; for
Cousin Emmy always cried when she told it. And to see a grown-up
person cry wasn't proper.</p>

<p>The four of them were out for their morning walk, and sat
resting on a fallen tree.</p>

<p>"Well, dears, poor little Jacky was so often ill that God
thought he would be happier in heaven. His back teeth wouldn't come
through; and he was so feverish and restless that I had to carry
him about most of the night. The last time I walked him up and down
he put his little arms round my neck and said: 'Ting,
Memmy!'&mdash;he couldn't say 'sing' or 'Emmy' properly, you
know"&mdash;a detail which entranced the Dumplings, who had endless
difficulties with their own speech. "And those were the very last
words he said. In the middle of the night he took convulsions
&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> c'nvulshuns, Cousin Emmy?" The question came
simultaneously, none of the three being minded, often as they had
heard the story, to let the narrator skip this, the raciest bit of
it.</p>

<p>"Why, poor darling, he shivered and shook, and squinted and
rolled his eyes, and went blue in the face, and his body got stiff,
and he turned up his eyes till you could only see the whites. And
then he died, and we dressed him in his best nightgown, and he lay
there looking like a big wax doll&mdash;with white flowers in his
hands. And his little coffin was lined with white satin, and
trimmed with the most <i>beautiful</i> lace..." And here sure
enough, at mention of her nursling's last costly bed, Emmy began to
cry. The three children, reddening, smiled funny little embarrassed
smiles and averted their eyes; only occasionally taking a
surreptitious peep to see what Cousin Emmy looked like when she did
it.</p>

<p>With the heel of his boot Cuffy hammered the ground. He knew
something else...about Cousin Emmy...something naughty. He'd heard
Mamma and Papa talking; and it was about running away and Aunt
Lizzie being most awfully furious. And then Cousin Emmy had come to
stay with them. He was glad she had; he liked her. Her hair was
yellow, like wattle; her mouth ever so red. And she told them
stories. Mamma could only read stories. And never had time.</p>

<p>To-day, however, there would be no more. For round a bend of the
bush track, by which they sat, came a figure which the children
were growing used to see appearing on their walks. It was the
Reverend Mr. Angus. He wore a long black coat that reached below
his knees and a white tie. He had a red curly beard and pink
cheeks. (Just like a lady, thought Cuffy.) At sight of the lovely
girl in deep mourning, bathed in tears, these grew still pinker.
Advancing at a jogtrot, their owner seated himself on the tree and
took Emmy's hand in his.</p>

<p>The children were now supposed to "run away and play." The twins
fell to building a little house, with pieces of bark and stones;
but Cuffy determined to pick a <i>beeyutiful</i> nosegay, that
Cousin Emmy would like ever so much, and say "How pretty!" to, and
"How kind of you, Cuffy!" Mr. Angus had a face like a cow; and when
he spoke he made hissing noises through his teeth. The first time
he heard them, Cuffy hadn't been able to tear his eyes away, and
had stood stockstill in front of the minister till Cousin Emmy got
quite cross. And Mr. Angus said, in <i>his</i> opinion, little
people should not only be seen and not heard, but not even
seen.</p>

<p>All right then! Whistling his loudest Cuffy sauntered off. He
would be good, and not go near any of the old, open shafts; quite
specially not the one where the old dead donkey had tumbled in and
floated. You weren't allowed to look down this hole, not even if
somebody held your hand...like Mr. Angus did Cousin Emmy's. (Why
was he? She couldn't fall off a <i>log</i>.) It had a nasty smell,
too. Cousin Emmy said only to think of it made her sick. And Mamma
said they were to hold their noses as they passed. Why was the
donkey so nasty because it was dead? What did a dead donkey
<i>do?</i></p>

<p>But first he would pick the flowers. It wouldn't take long,
there were such lots of them. Papa said we must thank the rains for
the flowers; and it had rained every day for nearly a month. The
Lagoon was quite full, and the tank, too; which made Mamma
glad.&mdash;And now Cuffy darted about, tearing up bits of running
postman, and pulling snatches of the purple sarsaparilla that
climbed the bushes and young trees, till he had a tight, close
bunch in his hot little hand. As he picked, he sniffed the air,
which smelt lovely...like honey...Cousin Emmy said it was the
wattle coming out. To feel it better he shut his eyes, screwed them
up to nothing, and kept them tight. And when he opened them again,
everything looked <i>new</i>...as if he'd never seen it
before...all the white trees, tall like poles, that went up and up
to where, right at the top, among whiskery branches, were bits of
blue that were the sky.</p>

<p>With the elastic of his big upturned sailor-hat between his
teeth&mdash;partly to keep it on; partly because he loved chewing
things: elastic, or string, or the fingers of kid
gloves&mdash;Cuffy ran at top speed to the donkey-hole. But a
couple of yards from the shaft his courage all but failed him. What
was he going to see? And ooh!...it <i>did</i> smell. Laying his
flowers on the ground, he went down on his hands and knees and
crawled forward till he could just peep over. And then, why, what a
sell! It wasn't a donkey at all&mdash;just water&mdash;and in it a
great lump that stuck out like a 'normous boiled pudding...oh, and
a million, no, two million and a half blowflies walking on it, and
a smell like&mdash;ooh, yes! just exactly like...But before he
could put a name to the odour, there was a great shouting and
cooee-ing, and it was him they were calling...and calling. In his
guilty fright Cuffy gave a jerk, and off went his hat with its
pulped elastic&mdash;went down, down, down, while the blowflies
came up. He just managed to wriggle a little way back, but was
still on all fours (squashing the flowers) when they found him, Mr.
Angus panting and puffing with tears on his forehead, Cousin Emmy
pressing her hand to her chest and saying, oh dear oh dear! Then
Mr. Angus took him by the shoulder and shook him. Little boys who
ran away in the bush <i>always</i> got lost, and never saw their
Mammas and Papas again. They had nothing to eat and starved to
death, and not till years afterwards were their skeletons found,
Cuffy, who knew quite well where he was, and hadn't meant to run
away, thought him very silly...and rude.</p>

<p>It was the loss of the hat that was the tragedy. This made ever
so many things go wrong, and ended with Cousin Emmy having to go
back to live with Aunt Lizzie again, and them getting a real
<i>paid</i> governess to teach them.</p>

<p>Hatless, squeezed close up to Cousin Emmy to be under her
parasol, Cuffy was hurried through the township. "Or people will
think your Mamma is too poor to buy you a hat."</p>

<p>The children's hearts were heavy. It infected them with fear to
see Cousin Emmy so afraid, and to hear her keep saying: "What
<i>will</i> Aunt Mary say?"</p>

<p>Not only, it seemed, had the hat cost a lot of money&mdash;to
get another like it Mamma would have to send all the way to
Melbourne. But it also leaked out that not a word was to have been
said about Mr. Angus meeting them, and sitting on the log and
talking.</p>

<p>"Why not? Is it naughty?"</p>

<p>"Of <i>course</i> not, Cuffy! How can you be so silly!
But&mdash;" But...well, Aunt Mary would certainly be dreadfully
cross with her for not looking after him better. How <i>could</i>
he be so dishonourable, the first moment she wasn't watching, to go
where he had been strictly forbidden to...such a <i>dirty</i>
place!...and where he might have fallen head-foremost down the
shaft and never been seen again.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a very crestfallen, guilt-laden little party that
entered the house.</p>

<p>Mamma came out of the dining-room, a needle in one hand, a long
thread of cotton in the other. And she saw at once what had
happened, and said: "Where's your hat?&mdash;<i>lost</i> it? Your
nice, new hat? How? Come in here to me." The twins began to sniff,
and then everything was up.</p>

<p>Yes, Mamma was very cross...and sorry, too; for poor Papa was
working his hardest to keep them nice, and then a careless little
boy just went and threw money into the street. But ever so much
crosser when she heard where the hat had gone: she scolded and
scolded. And then she put the question Cuffy dreaded most: "Pray,
what were you doing there...by yourself?" In vain he shuffled and
prevaricated, and told about the nosegay. Mamma just fixed her eyes
on him, and it was no good; Mr. Angus had to come out. And now it
was Cousin Emmy's turn. She went scarlet, but she answered Mamma
back quite a lot, and was angry, too; and only when Mamma said she
wouldn't have believed it of her, it was the behaviour of a common
nursegirl, and she would have to speak to her uncle about
her&mdash;at that Cousin Emmy burst out crying, and ran away and
shut herself in her room.</p>

<p>Then Mamma went into the surgery to tell Papa. She shut the
door, but you could hear their voices through it; and merely the
sound of them, though he didn't know what they were saying, threw
Cuffy into a flutter. Retreating to the furthest corner of the
verandah, he sat with his elbows on his knees, the palms of his
hands pressed against his ears.</p>

<p>And while Emmy, face downwards on her pillow, wept: "I don't
care...let them fall down mines if they want to...he's very
nice...Aunt Mary isn't fair!" Mary was saying: "I did think she
could be trusted with the children&mdash;considering the care she
took of Jacky."</p>

<p>"Other people's children, my dear&mdash;other people's children!
He might have been her own."</p>

<p>Mary was horrified. "Whatever you do, don't say a thing like
that before Cuffy! It would mean the most awkward questions. And
surely <i>we</i> are not 'other people?' If Emmy can't look after
her own little cousins...The child might have been killed, while
she sat there flirting and amusing herself."</p>

<p>"It's not likely to happen again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. When I tackled her with it, she got on the
high horse at once, and said it wasn't a very great crime to have a
little chat with somebody: life was so dull here, and so on."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure that's true enough."</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> a weak spot you have for the girl! But that's not
all. It didn't take me long to discover she'd been trying to make
the children deceive me. They were to have held their tongues about
this Angus meeting them on their walks...Cuffy went as near as he
could to telling a fib over it. Now you must see I can't have that
sort of thing going on...the children taught fibbing and
deceiving!"</p>

<p>"No, that certainly wouldn't do."</p>

<p>"Then, imagine a girl of Emmy's birth and upbringing plotting to
meet, on the sly, a man we don't invite to the house! She'll be the
talk of the place. And what if she got herself into some
entanglement or other while she's under our care? John's eldest
daughter and an insignificant little dissenter, poor as a church
mouse, and years older than she is! <i>Think</i> what Lizzie would
say!"</p>

<p>"My dear, Lizzie's sentiments would be the same, and were it
Croesus and Adonis rolled into one."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I suppose they would.&mdash;But Emmy is far too
extravagant for a poor man's wife. She changes her underclothing
every day of the week. You should hear Maria grumble at the
washing! Besides, she's everlastingly titivating, dressing her hair
or something. She does none of the jobs one expects from a
nursery&mdash;governess. And if I venture to find fault...I don't
know, but she seems greatly changed. I think first her father's
death, and then Jacky's have thoroughly spoiled her."</p>

<p>"Well! to have the two mortals you've set your heart on snatched
from you, one after the other, isn't it enough to dash the
stoutest?...let alone an innocent young girl. Emmy has been through
a great spiritual experience, and one result of it might very well
be to mature her...turn her into a woman who feels her power. It
will probably be the same wherever she goes, with a face like hers.
In her father's house, she would of course have met more eligible
men than we, in our poor circumstances, can offer her. Still, my
advice would be, such as they are, ask 'em to the house. Let
everything be open and aboveboard."</p>

<p>"What! invite that little Angus? Nonsense! It would only be
encouraging him. Besides, it's all very well for you to theorise; I
have to look at it from the practical side. And it surely isn't
what one has a governess for?...to smooth the way for her
flirtations. I may as well tell you everything. When she first
came, I used to send her running up to the station&mdash;if I
needed stamps, or small change, or things like that&mdash;Mr.
Pendrell is always so obliging. But I had to stop it. She took to
staying away an unconscionable time, and his wife must have got
wind of it, she began to look so queerly at Emmy and to drop hints.
Most uncomfortable. And then you've surely noticed how often old
Thistlethwaite comes to see us now, compared with what he used to,
and how he sits and stares at Emmy. He looks at her far too much,
too, when he's preaching, and I've heard him pay her the most
outrageous compliments. A clergyman and a widower, and old enough
to be her <i>Grand</i>father! But Emmy just drinks it in. Now, mind
you, if there were any question of a decent match for her, I'd do
what I could to help...for I don't believe Lizzie will ever let her
say how-do-you-do to an eligible. But I <i>cannot</i> have her
getting into mischief here&mdash;why, even the baker tries to
snatch a word with her when he delivers the bread!&mdash;and being
branded as forward, and a common flirt. No, the truth is, she's
just too pretty to be of the least practical use."</p>

<p>Mahony made no reply.</p>

<p>"Are you <i>listening</i>, Richard?...to what I say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hear."</p>

<p>"I thought you were asleep. Well, perhaps you'll rouse yourself
and tell me what I ought to do."</p>

<p>"I suppose there's nothing for it: Emmy must go."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then?"</p>

<p>"I mean about the children. Who's to give them their lessons and
their music-lessons?...and take them out walking?"</p>

<p>"My dear, <i>can</i> you not teach them yourself for a bit?"</p>

<p>"No, Richard, I <i>cannot!</i> At the age they're at now, they
need one person's undivided attention. They've simply <i>got</i> to
have a governess."</p>

<p>"Oh well! I suppose if you must you must...and that's all about
it."</p>

<p>The implication in these words exasperated Mary.</p>

<p>"If I must? I'm not asking anything for myself! You've never
heard me utter a word of complaint. But I can't do more than I am
doing. Any one but you would see it. But you're as blind as a
bat!"</p>

<p>"Not so blind as you think, my dear. One thing I see is that you
never hesitate to load me up with a fresh expense."</p>

<p>"No, that's out-and-away unfair," cried Mary, thoroughly roused.
"I, who slave and toil...and when I'm not even convinced that it's
necessary, either. For you're always saying you're satisfied with
the practice, that the fees come in well and so on; and yet to get
anything out of you nowadays is like drawing blood from a stone. I
don't care a rap about myself; I'll put up with whatever you like;
but I can't and won't sit by and see my children degenerate. I
think that would break my heart. I shall fight for them to my last
breath."</p>

<p>"Yes, for them. But for me, never a trace of
understanding!"&mdash;And now the quarrel began in earnest.</p>

<p>Cuffy, sitting hunched up on the verandah, squeezed his ears
until they sang.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-1-8" id="ch-3-1-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>The day began at six...with the pestilential screech of the
mill-whistle. This also started the children off. Birdlike sounds
began to issue from their room across the passage: there was no
muting these shrill, sweet trebles. And soon Miss Prestwick's thin
voice made itself heard, capped by Mary's magisterial tones, and
the dashing and splashing of bath-water, and small feet scampering,
and Maria thudding up and down, clattering her brooms.</p>

<p>There was no more chance of sleep. He, too, rose.</p>

<p>The water of the shower-bath was tepid and unrefreshing. It had
also to be sparingly used. Then came breakfast&mdash;with mushy
butter, the pat collapsing on its way from the cellar; with sticky
flies crawling over everything, a soiled cloth, the children's
jabber, Miss Prestwick's mincing airs, and Mary checking,
apportioning, deciding. Mahony ate hastily, and, there being here
no morning paper or early post to engage him, retired to the
surgery. His cases written up, his visits for the day arranged, he
sat and waited, and listened. This was the time when a
walking-patient or two might call for treatment; and the footsteps
of any one nearing the house could be heard a long way off,
crunching the gravel of the path by the Lagoon, coming up the
right-of-way. And as he sat, idly twirling his thumbs, it became a
matter of interest to speculate whether approaching steps would
halt at his door or move on towards the railway station. In
waiting, he could hear Cuffy's voice proclaiming loudly and
unnaturally: JER SUISE URN PETTY GARSONG, DE BUN FIGOOR.</p>

<p>After a couple of false alarms there was a knock at the door;
and Maria introduced a working-man with a foreign body in his eye.
A grain of mortar extracted and the eye bathed, Mahony washed,
stitched and bandaged a child's gashed knee, and drew a tooth for a
miner's wife. Mary's aid was needed here, to hold the woman's
hands. It was Mary, too, who applied restoratives and helped to
clean up the patient. After which she brushed yesterday's dust from
his wide-awake, held a silk coat for him to slip his arms into and
checked the contents of his bag.</p>

<p>He set off on his morning round, following the path that ran
alongside the Lagoon. Here and there the shadow of a fir-tree fell
across it, and, though the season was but late spring, the shade
was welcome. Emerging from the Lagoon enclosure, he entered the
single street that formed the township of Barambogie. This was
empty but for a couple of buggies which stood outside a
public-house, their hoods white with the dust of innumerable bush
journeys.</p>

<p>But the sound of his foot on the pavement, his shadow on the
glass of the shop-windows, made people dart to their doors to see
who passed. Huh! it was only "the new doctor"; and out of
<i>him</i> nothing was to be got...in the shape of a yarn, or a
companionable drink.</p>

<p>One or two threw him a "Mornin'!" The rest contented themselves
with a nod. But all alike regarded his raised hat and courteous
"Good day to you!" "Good morning, sir!" with the colonial's inborn
contempt for form and ceremony. By the Lord Harry! slapdash was
good enough for them.</p>

<p>On this particular day Mahony had three calls to make.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Anglican parsonage&mdash;a shabby brick cottage
standing on a piece of ground that had never been fenced
in&mdash;he took up the knocker, which, crudely repaired with a
headless nail and a bit of twine, straightway came off in his hand.
He rapped with his knuckles, and the Reverend Thistlethwaite, in
nightshirt and trousers and with bare feet, appeared from his back
premises, where he had been feeding fowls. Re-affixing the knocker
with a skill born of long practice, he opened the door of the
parlour, into which there was just room to squeeze. On the table,
writing-materials elbowed the remains of a mutton-chop breakfast.
Blowflies crawled over the fatted plates.</p>

<p>An unsightly carbuncle lanced and dressed, the reverend
gentleman&mdash;he was a fleshy, red-faced man, of whom unkind
rumour had it that there were times when his tongue tripped over
his own name&mdash;laid himself out to detain his visitor. He was
spoiling for a chat.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, doctor, hard at work...hard at work!"&mdash;with an
airy wave of the hand at pens, ink and paper. "Must always have
something fresh, you know, of a Sunday morning, to tickle 'em up
with. Even the minor prophets are racked, I can assure you, in the
search for a rousing heading."</p>

<p>Mahony replaced lancet and lint in silence. It was common
knowledge that old Thistlethwaite had not written a fresh sermon
for years; but had used his stale ones again and again, some even
said reading them backwards, for the sake of variety. The
implements littering the table were set permanently out on
view.</p>

<p>Insensitive to Mahony's attitude, he ran on. "Talking of rummy
texts now...did y'ever hear the story of the three curates, out to
impress the Bishop with their skill at squeezing juice from a dry
orange, who, each in turn, in the different places he visited on
three successive Sundays, held forth on the theme: 'Now Peter's
wife's mother lay sick of a fever'? You have?...capital, isn't it?
But I'll warrant you don't know the yarn of old Minchin and the
cow. It was at Bootajup in the Western District, and his first
up-country cure; and Minch, who was a townbird born and bred, was
officiating for the first time at Harvest Festival. The farmers had
given liberally, the church was full, Minch in the reading-desk
with his back to a side door that had been left open for coolness.
All went well till in the middle of the Psalms, when he saw the
eyes of his congregation getting rounder and rounder. Old Minch,
who was propriety in person, thought his collar had come undone, or
that he'd shed a private button...ha, ha! Whereas, if you please,
it was a cow which had strayed to the door, and was being agreeably
attracted by the farm produce. Minch looked round just as the
animal walked in, lost his head, dropped his book and bolted;
taking the altar rails at a leap, with cassock and surplice bunched
up round him. Ha, ha! Capital...capital! It was Minchin, too, who
was once preaching from the text: 'And God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes,' when he found himself forced to sneeze some
dozen times running. Ha, ha, ha! His own eyes poured
tears&mdash;ran with water. Out it came: a-tischoo, a-tischoo! The
congregation rocked with laughter.&mdash;What?...you must be
toddling? Well, well! we know you doctors are busy men.
Hot?&mdash;call this hot? I wonder what you'll say to our summers!
Well, good day, doctor, good day!"</p>

<p>"'Except ye become as little children'...'for of such is the
kingdom of heaven.' <i>My</i> God!...then give me earth."</p>

<p>Striking off on a bush track Mahony trudged along, leaving a low
trail of dust in his wake. His goal was a poor outlying wooden
shanty, to treat a washerwoman's severely scalded leg and foot. The
wound, some days old, was open, dirty, offensive; the woman, who
sat propped up before her tubs, struggling to finish her week's
work, loud-mouthed with pain.</p>

<p>"She don't half holler'n screech if oner the kids knocks up
against it," volunteered a foxy-looking girl who stood by, sucking
her thumb, and watching, with an unholy interest, the sponging off
of the foul rags, the laying bare of the raw flesh.</p>

<p>Mahony's impatient "Why on earth didn't you send for me sooner?"
brought no coherent response; but his prescription of complete rest
in a horizontal position effectually loosed the sufferer's tongue.
"Didn't I know you'd be after orderin' me some such foolery? Who's
to kape us? I've no man. I'm a poor lone widder..."</p>

<p>"Apply to your priest for aid."</p>

<p>"The praste? A fat lot o' good that 'ud be&mdash;the great lazy
louse! We cud all starve afore <i>he'd</i> lift a finger."</p>

<p>"Well, I've warned you, I can do no more." And cutting further
discussion short, Mahony put on his hat and walked out of the
house.</p>

<p>As, however, the foxy child, thumb in mouth, lolloped after him,
he took a sovereign from his pocket. "Here, my girl, here's
something to tide you over. Now see that your mother lies up.
You're old enough to lend a hand."</p>

<p>But before he had gone a hundred yards he turned on his heel,
recalling the low, cunning look that had leapt into the girl's eyes
at sight of the gold piece. "Fool that I am!...the mother will
never see it."</p>

<p>Caught in the act of secreting the coin in her stocking, the
girl went livid with fury. "What d'you mean? D'you think I was
goin' to pinch it? Ma!...d'you hear, Ma?...what he says? Ma! he's
callin' me a thief."</p>

<p>"A thief, indeed! My child a thief?&mdash;And you, you pesky
young devil, you hand that chip over or I'll wring your neck!"</p>

<p>Thence to the shop of Ah Sing, the Chinese butcher, where a
rachitic infant lay cramped with the colic. Mahony looked with pity
on the little half-breed, slit of eye and yellow of skin, and was
very short with the mother, a monstrously fat woman who stood, her
arms a-kimbo, answering his questions with an air of sulky
defiance. No she didn't know, not she, what had caused the colic:
she'd done 'nothing. But here espying an empty tin dish that had
been thrust under the bed, Mahony picked it up and sniffed it. "Ha!
here we have it. What filthy messes has your husband been feeding
the child on now? Haven't I told you her stomach will not stand
them?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ah Sing" bit back the abusive rejoinders that were given
to escaping her at any reference to her child's mixed origin:
"Doctor's" were Sing's best customers. But the visit over, she
flounced into the shop and, seizing a knife, let loose her spleen
in hacking down some chops, while she vociferated for all to hear:
"Filthy mess, indeed...I'll mess him! Let him look to his own kids,
say I! That boy brat of his is as white as a sheet and thin as a
lizard.&mdash;Here, you Sing, weigh this and look sharp about it,
you crawling slug, you!"</p>

<p>"Malia! me give lil baby powder&mdash;you no sendee more for
doctorman, Malia!" said the soft-voiced, gentle Chinaman who owned
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell take the kid!&mdash;and you along with it," gave back
Maria.</p>

<p>On the way home Mahony overtook his children and the governess,
returning from their morning walk. The twins' short fag legs were
weary. Entrusting his bag to Cuffy, who forthwith became "the
doctor," bowing graciously to imaginary patients, and only waggling
the bag just the least little bit to hear the things inside it
rattle, their father took his little girls by the hand. Poor mites!
They were losing their roses already. Somehow or other he must make
it possible to send them away when the real hot weather came. This
was no place for children in summer; he heard it on every side. And
his, reared to sea-breezes, would find it doubly hard to
acclimatise themselves. Stung by these reflections he unthinkingly
quickened his pace, and strode ahead, a gaunt figure, dragging a
small child at a trot on either hand. Miss Prestwick gave up the
chase.</p>

<p>Dinner over, out he had to turn again. Back to the main street
and the hotel, where a buggy should have been in waiting. It was
not. He had to stand about in the sun while the vehicle was dragged
out, the horse fetched, harnessed, and backed between the shafts. A
strap broke in the buckling; the ostler, whistling between his
teeth, leisurely repaired the damage with a bit of string.</p>

<p>Stiffly Mahony jerked himself up into the high vehicle and took
the reins. He had a ten-mile drive before him, over the worst
possible roads; it would be all he could do to reach home by dark.
The horse, too, was unfresh. In vain he urged and cajoled; the
animal's pace remained a dilatory amble. And the heat seemed to
accumulate under the close black hood, which weighed on his
shoulders like a giant hat. Yet, if he alighted to slip a rail, it
was so much hotter outside that he was glad to clamber back beneath
its covering. Still he did not complain. These bush visits were
what brought the shekels in: not the tinkering with rachitic
infants or impecunious Irish, whom, as this morning, he sometimes
paid for the privilege of attending. (Ha, ha!...capital!...as that
fool Thistlethwaite would have said.) And to-day promised to be
more than ordinarily remunerative; for he had another long drive
before him that evening, in an opposite direction. He could count
on clearing a ten-pound note.</p>

<p>But when, towards six o'clock, he reached home, the summons he
was expecting had not come. There was time for a bath, a change, a
rest; and still the trap that should have fetched him had not
appeared. He began to grow fidgety. The case was one of diphtheria.
On the previous day he had given relief by opening the windpipe; it
was essential for him to know the result of the operation. What
could the people be thinking of? Or had the child died in the
meantime...the membrane spread downwards, causing obstruction below
the tube? "Surely in common decency they would have let me
know?"</p>

<p>He wandered from room to room, nervously snapping his fingers.
Or sat down and beat a tattoo on chair-arm or table, only to spring
up at an imaginary sound of wheels.</p>

<p>Mary dissuaded him from hiring a buggy and driving out to see
what had happened. She also pooh-poohed his idea of an accident to
the messenger. The father, a vinegrower, had several men and more
than one horse and buggy at his disposal. The likelihood was, he
would have come himself, had the child been worse. <i>unless</i>,
of course...well! it wasn't death <i>she</i> thought of. But the
township of Mittagunga was not much farther than Barambogie from
the patient's home; and there was another doctor at Mittagunga. She
did not speak this thought aloud; but it haunted her; and, as the
evening wore eventlessly away, the question escaped her in spite of
herself: "Can you have offended them?...in any way?"</p>

<p>"<i>Offended</i> them? I?&mdash;Well, if it's offensive to leave
one's bed in the middle of the night for an eight-mile drive on
these abominable roads, to perform a ticklish operation!" And very
bitterly: "What extraordinary ideas you do have, Mary! What on
earth do you mean now?"</p>

<p>But Mary, repenting her slip, was not prepared to stir up the
heated discussion that would inevitably follow.</p>

<p>She went into the dining-room and sat down to her sewing; while
he fell to pacing the verandah. But though she, too, never ceased
to keep her ears pricked for the noise of wheels, no sound was to
be heard but that of Richard's feet tramping to and fro
("<i>How</i> tired he will be to-morrow!") and the peevish whine of
a little nightwind round the corners of the house. Sorry as she
felt for him, she did not again try to reason with him or console
him. For when in one of his really black moods, he seemed to retire
where words could not get at him. And these moods were growing on
him. Nowadays, any small mishap sufficed to throw him into a state
of excitement, the aftermath of which was bottomless depression.
How would it all end?&mdash;Letting her work fall, Mary put her
chin in her hand, and sat staring into the flame of the kerosene
lamp. But she did not see it. She seemed to be looking through the
light at something that lay beyond...something on the farther side,
not only of the flame, but of all she had hitherto known of life;
to be looking, in visionary fashion, out towards those shadowy
to-morrows, for the first of which Richard was so surely
incapacitating himself...an endless line of days, that would come
marching upon her, with never a break, never a respite, each fuller
of anxiety than the one that went before.</p>

<p>Till, with a shiver, she resolutely shook herself free.
"Tch!...it comes of listening to that silly, dismal wind."</p>

<p>Yet when, on the clock striking eleven, she stepped out on the
verandah, her first words were: "Oh, what a lovely night!"</p>

<p>For the little wind whistled and piped out of a clear sky; and
the moon, at full, drenched the earth with its radiance. Before the
house the Lagoon lay like a sheet of beaten silver. Trees and
bushes, jet-black on one side, were white as if with hoar frost on
the other. The distant hills ran together with the sky in a silver
haze. All was peace...except for the thudding of Richard's
feet.</p>

<p>"My dear, I'm sure it's no use waiting up any longer. They won't
come now. Do go to bed."</p>

<p>"I'm too worried. I couldn't sleep."</p>

<p>"But at least it would rest you. As it is, you're wearing
yourself out."</p>

<p>"Very easy for you to talk! But if anything should happen...the
responsibility...my practice here&mdash;I can't afford it, Mary,
and that's the truth...not yet."</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done. With a sigh that was like a little
prayer for patience, Mary turned away.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-1-9" id="ch-3-1-9"></a>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>The postman handed in a letter with a mourning border fully an
inch wide: there was barely room for name and address, which were
squeezed in anyhow. It was from Mr. Henry; and opening it in some
trepidation Mary read the sad news of Agnes's death. Mr. Henry was
kind enough to give her full particulars. Agnes had, it seemed,
stood the voyage out well. But on landing at the Cape she had met
with an accident; had caught her foot in a rope and fallen heavily;
and the shock had brought on an apoplexy from which she never
rallied. Mr. Henry wrote as one bereft of all he held dear; as the
fond father whose pious duty it would henceforth be, to fill a
mother's place to his orphaned children. In reading the letter
aloud, Mary swallowed hard; then veiled her discomfort with an
apologetic: "Oh well, you know...poor man,...I daresay&mdash;" by
which she meant to imply that, with death's entry on the scene, the
realities were apt to get overlaid. Mr. Henry saw himself and his
situation, not as they were, but as he would have wished them to
be.</p>

<p>Richard, of course, sniffed at Ocock's layman-ish account of his
wife's end. And he was right. For Tilly's gloss on the affair ran:
PURD HEARD FROM A MAN WHO WAS ON BOARD THE SAME SHIP. IT'S TRUE SHE
DID TRIP OVER A ROPE AND COME A CROPPER (AND NOT THE FIRST TIME
NEITHER, AS WE KNOW) AND THIS BROUGHT ON A VIOLENT ATTACK OF D.T.'S
WHICH CARRIED HER OFF: HENRY HASN'T LOOKED THE SAME MAN SINCE. HIS
RELIEF IS IMMENSE&mdash;SIMPLY IMMENSE.</p>

<p>But Mary's faithful stubborn heart rebelled. For Agnes's own
sake, her death was perhaps, pitifully enough, the best solution.
But that, of all who had known her, none should mourn her passing;
that even among her nearest it should stir only a sense of good
riddance and relief: the tragedy of such a finish moved Mary to the
depths. Tenderly she laid away the keepsake Mr. Henry sent her for
remembrance: a large cameo-brooch, at the back of which, under
glass, was twined a golden curl, cut from the head of the little
child whose untimely end had cost Agnes her bitterest tears.</p>

<p>A day or two later there came into her possession a still more
pathetic memento: a letter from the dead, which had to be opened
and read though the hand that wrote it was lying cold at the bottom
of a grave. It had been found by Mr. Henry amongst his wife's
belongings&mdash;found sealed and addressed but never
posted&mdash;a blotted and scrawled production and more than a
little confused, but full of love and kindness; though written with
the firm conviction that they would never meet again. Poor thing,
poor thing! And having read, Mary hid it away at the back of a
drawer, where no eyes but her own would ever see it. She could not
have borne Richard's sarcastic comments on Agnes's poor spelling
and poorer penmanship.</p>

<p>But there was nothing new in this secretiveness: she was falling
more and more into the way of keeping Richard in the dark. A smash
of china by the clumsy servant; Miss Prestwick's airs and
insufficiencies; the exorbitant price of the children's new boots;
disturbing gossip retailed by the girl: of vexations such as these,
which were her daily portion, he heard not a word. It left her, of
course, much freer to deal with things. But it also spared him the
exhaustion of many a towering rage (under the influence of which he
was quite capable of writing to the bootmaker and calling him a
thief); saved him, too, from going off into one of his fits of
depression when he imagined the whole world in league against him.
The real truth was, he hadn't enough to occupy him; and not a soul
to speak to...except his dreadful patients. Nor did he ever write
or receive a letter. In coming here he seemed to have had but one
desire: to forget and be forgotten.</p>

<p>She it was who sat up at night, spinning out the letters
necessary to make people remember you. And it fell to her to write
the note of welcome when Baron von Krause, the well-known botanist,
proposed to break his journey from Sydney to Melbourne, solely to
pay them a visit. &mdash;Though putting up a visitor nowadays meant
considerable inconvenience: they had to turn out of their own room,
she going in with the children, Richard making shift with the
dining-room sofa. Still, in this case she thought the upset worth
while: for Richard's sake. He had been as friendly with the Baron
as it was in his nature to be with anybody; and the latter had once
spoken to her, in warm terms, of Richard's intimate knowledge of
the native flora, and lamented the fact that he should not have
found time to systematise his studies.</p>

<p>The next morning, while Richard was out, she climbed the
step-ladder and unearthed the glass cases that contained his
collections of plants, minerals and butterflies: for the first time
on moving into a new house, he had not set them up in his room. But
she wasn't going to let people think that, because he had come to
live up-country, he was therefore running to seed. And having
dusted and rubbed and polished, she ranged the cases along the
walls of the passage and on the dining-room sideboard. To the
delight of the children.</p>

<p>But she might have spared her pains. As far as Richard was
concerned, the visit was a failure.</p>

<p>Baron von Krause arrived during the forenoon. Richard was on his
rounds, and did not reach home till they were half through dinner.
And then he tried to get out of coming to table! Going in search of
him on his non-appearance, she found him sunk in his armchair, from
which he vowed he was too tired to stir...let alone exert himself
to entertain strangers.</p>

<p>"Strangers? There's only him! And he's just as nice as he always
was. We're getting on capitally. The children, too."</p>

<p>The Baron was a short, sturdy little man, bronzed brown with the
sun&mdash;beside him Richard, who never tanned, looked almost
transparent&mdash;dark of hair and beard, and with a pair of kindly
blue eyes that beamed at you from behind large gold spectacles.
Veteran colonist though he was, he still spoke a jargon all his
own, coupled with a thick, foreign accent. He also expressed
himself with extreme deliberation, using odd, archaic words ("Like
the Bible," thought Cuffy); and, could he not at once find the word
he sought, he paused in what he was saying and scoured his mind
till he had captured it. This, added to the fact that he did things
at table that were strictly forbidden them, made him an object of
enormous interest to the children; and three pairs of eyes hung
entranced on him as he ate and spoke, to the detriment of their
owners' own table-manners. In waiting, too, for him to be delivered
of a word, three little faces went pink with a mixture of
embarrassment and anticipation. In vain did Mary privately frown
and shake her head. A knifeful of peas, "me<i>lan</i>choly" for
melancholy, and all three were agog again. It was a real drawback,
at a time like this, to have such <i>noticing</i> children.</p>

<p>But with their father's entry a change came over their
behaviour. Cuffy kept his eyes fixed on his plate and minded what
he was doing, and Lallie and Lucie faithfully followed suit. The
fun was at an end. For it wasn't at all the same when Papa forgot,
in the middle of a sentence, what he was going to say (because
Mamma interrupted him with a potato) and tried and tried his
hardest to remember and couldn't, and got very cross with himself.
Mamma thought it was funny though, for she laughed and said she
believed he'd forget his head if it weren't screwed on; and then
she told a story about Papa nearly going out without his collar,
and how she had rushed after him and saved him...which made Papa
cross with her as well.</p>

<p>It was too hot to go walking. And after dinner, Mahony having
been called back to the surgery, the Baron strayed to the
drawing-room, opened the piano, and put his hairy, knuckly hands on
the keys. Mary thought this an excellent chance to slip away and
"see to things"; but Richard, the patient gone, first set his door
ajar, then came along the passage and sat down in an armchair by
the drawing-room window. Cuffy, at ball on the verandah, also crept
in and took up his position close to the piano, leaning against it
and staring fixedly at the player&mdash;listening, that is to say,
after the fashion of children, as much with the eyes as with the
ears (as if only by keeping the maker of the sounds in view can
they grasp the sounds themselves)&mdash;the while he continued
mechanically to tip his ball from hand to hand.</p>

<p>The Baron was playing something hard and ugly...like five-finger
exercises but with more notes, oh! <i>lots</i> of notes in it...and
to and fro went the ball, to and fro. This lasted a long time, and
the Baron was hot when he'd finished, and had to wipe his neck and
clean his glasses. Then he did some more; and this time it was
prettier, with a tune to it, and it danced in little squirts up the
piano; and Cuffy was obliged to smile...he didn't know why, his
mouth just smiled by itself. He also left off fiddling with the
ball. By now the Baron had become aware of his small listener.
Musician-wise had noted, too, the child's instinctive response to
the tripping scherzo. Pausing, he peered at Cuffy through his large
round spectacles; and before putting his fingers in place for the
third piece, leant over and patted the boy's cheek, murmuring as he
did: "Let us see then...yes, let us see!" To Cuffy he said:
"Hearken now, my little one...hearken well to this. Here I shall
give you food for the heart as well as for the head."&mdash;And
then he began to play music that was quite, quite different to that
before...and wasn't <i>like</i> music any more. It whispered in the
bass, and while it whispered it growled; but the treble didn't
growl: it cried.</p>

<p>And now something funny happened to Cuffy. He began to feel as
if he'd like to run away; he didn't <i>want</i> to listen...and his
heart started to beat fast. Like if he <i>had</i> run. The Baron 'd
said he was playing to it...perhaps that was why...for it seemed to
be getting bigger...till it was almost too tight for his chest.
Letting his ball fall, he pressed his fists close to where he
thought his heart must be. Something hurt him in there...he didn't
<i>like</i> this music, he wanted to call out to it to stop. But
the piano didn't care: it went on and on, and though it tried once
to be different, it always came back and did the same thing over
again...a dreadful thing...oh! something <i>would</i> burst in him
if it didn't leave off...he felt all swollen...yes, he was going to
burst...Then, without so much as taking his fingers off the keys,
the Baron began to make a lot of little notes that sounded just
like a wind, and throwing back his head and opening his mouth wide,
he sang funny things...in ever such a funny voice.</p>

<p>UBER'M GARTEN DURCH DIE LUFTE<br>
HORT' ICH WANDERVOGEL ZIEH'N,<br>
DAS BEDEUTET FRUHLINGSDUFTE,<br>
UNTEN FANGT'S SCHON AN ZU BLUH'N!</p>

<p>The relief, the ecstatic relief that surged through Cuffy at
these lovely sounds, was too much for him. His eyes ran over and
tears ran down his cheeks; nor could he help it, or stop them, when
he found what they were doing.</p>

<p>Mamma&mdash;she had come back&mdash;made ever such big eyes at
him.</p>

<p>"<i>Cuffy!</i> What on earth...Is <i>this</i> how you say
thank-you for the pretty music?" (If only he was not going off
before a visitor into one of his tantrums!)</p>

<p>"Nay, chide him not!" said the Baron, and smiled as he spoke: a
very peculiar smile indeed, to Mary's way of thinking. And then he
took no more notice of her, but bent over Cuffy and asked, in quite
a <i>polite</i> voice: "Will you that I play you again, my little
one?"</p>

<p>"No...<i>no</i>!" As rude as the Baron was polite, Cuffy gave a
great gulp and bolted from the room to the bottom of the garden;
where he hid among the raspberry-bushes. He didn't know what the
matter was; but he felt all sore; humiliated beyond the
telling.</p>

<p>When he went back, aggressively sheepish and ashamed, Papa had
gone. But Mamma and the Baron were talking, and he heard Mamma say:
"...without the least difficulty...ever since he was a tiny
tot.&mdash;Oh, here we are, are we?&mdash;Now, Baron, he shall play
to you."</p>

<p>Something turned over in Cuffy at these words. "<i>No!</i> I
won't!"</p>

<p>But Mamma threw him a look which he knew better than to disobey.
Besides, she already had his music-book on the rack, the stool
screwed up, and herself stood behind it to turn the pages.
Ungraciously Cuffy climbed to the slippery leather top, from which
his short legs dangled. Very well then if he must play, he must, he
didn't care; but he wouldn't look at his notes, or listen to what
he did. Instead, he'd count how many flies he could see in front of
him, on the wall and the ceiling. One...two...The piece&mdash;it
dated from Mary's own schooldays&mdash;at an end, his mother waited
in vain for the customary panegyric.</p>

<p>But the Baron merely said: "H'm," and again: "H'm!" Adding as a
kind of afterthought: "Habile little fingers."</p>

<p>When he turned to Cuffy, however, it was with quite a different
voice. "Well, and how many were then the flies on the
<i>plafond</i> my little one?"</p>

<p>Colouring to his hair-roots (<i>Now</i> he was going to catch
it!) Cuffy just managed to stammer out: "Twelve blowflies and
seventeen little flies."</p>

<p>But the Baron only threw back his head and laughed, and laughed.
"Ha-ha, ha-ha! Twelve big and seventeen little! That is good...that
is very good!" To add mysteriously: "Surely this, too, is a
sign...this capacity for to escape!&mdash;But now come hither, my
son, and let us play the little game. The bad little boy who counts
the flies, so long he plays the bad piece, shall stand so, with his
face to the wall. I strike the notes&mdash;<i>so</i>!&mdash;and he
is telling me their names&mdash;if Mr. G or Mrs. A&mdash;yes? List
now, if you can hear what is this."</p>

<p>"Huh, that's easy! That's C."</p>

<p>"And this fellow, so grey he?"</p>

<p>"A-E-B." Cuffy liked this: it was fun.</p>

<p>"And now how many I strike? D, F...right! B, D sharp...good! And
here this&mdash;an ugly one, this fellow! He agree not with his
neighbour."</p>

<p>"That's two together...close, I mean. G and A."</p>

<p>"<i>Ach, Himmel!</i>" cried the Baron. "The ear, it, too, is
perfect." And swiftly crossing the room, he took Cuffy's face in
his hands and turned it up. For a moment he stood looking down at
it; and his brown, bearded face was very solemn. Then, stooping, he
kissed the boy on the forehead. "May the good God bless you, my
child, and prosper His most precious gift!"&mdash;And this, just
when Cuffy (after the fly episode) had begun to think him rather a
nice old man!</p>

<p>Then he was free to run away and play; which he did with all his
might. But later in the afternoon when it was cool enough to go
walking, it was Cuffy the Baron invited to accompany him. "Nay, we
leave the little sisters at home with the good Mamma, and make the
promenade alone, just we both!"</p>

<p>Cuffy remembered the flies, forgave the kiss, and off they set.
They walked a long way into the bush, further than they were
allowed to go with Miss Prestwick; and the Baron told him about the
trees and poked among the scrub, and used a spyglass like Papa, and
showed him things through it. It <i>was</i> fun.</p>

<p>Then they sat down on a log to rest. And while they were there,
the Baron suddenly picked up his right hand and looked at it, as if
it was funny, and turned it over to the back, and stretched out the
fingers and felt the tips, and where the thumb joined on. And when
he had done this he didn't let it go, but kept hold of it; and
putting his other hand on Cuffy's shoulder said: "And now say, my
little man, say me why you did weep when I have played?"</p>

<p>Cuffy, all boy again, blushed furiously. He didn't like having
his hand held either. So he only looked away, and kicked his heels
against the tree so hard they hurt him. "I dunno."</p>

<p>Mamma would have said: "Oh, yes, you do." But the Baron wasn't
cross. He just gave the hand a little squeeze, and then he began to
talk, and he talked and talked. It lasted so long that it was like
being in church, and was very dull, all about things Cuffy didn't
know. So he hardly listened. He was chiefly intent on politely
wriggling his hand free.</p>

<p>But the Baron looked so nice and kind, even when he'd done this,
that he plucked up courage to ask something he wanted very much to
know; once before when he had tried it everybody had laughed at
him, and made fun.</p>

<p>"What does music <i>say?</i>"</p>

<p>But the Baron wasn't like that. He looked as solemn as church
again, and nodded his head. "Aha! It commences to stir itself...the
inward apperception. The music, it says what is in the heart, my
little one, to each interprets the <i>own</i> heart. That is, as
you must comprehend, if the one who is making it is the
<i>genie</i>, and has what in his own heart to say. That bad piece
you have played me have said nothing&mdash;nothing at all...oh, how
wise, how wise to count the little flies! But that what you have
flowed tears for, my child, that were the sufferings of a so
unhappy man&mdash;the fears that are coming by night to devour the
peace &mdash;oh, I will not say them to one so tender!...but these,
so great were they, so unhappy he, that at the last his brain has
burst" (There! he <i>knew</i> he had been going to burst) "and he
have become mad. But then, see, at once I have given you the
consolation. I have sung you of the nightingale, and moonshine, and
first love...all, all of which the youth is full. Our dear madman
he has that made, too. His name was Schumann. Mark that, my little
one...mark it well!"</p>

<p>"Shooh man.&mdash;What's mad?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ach!</i> break not the little head over such as this. Have
no care. The knowledge will soon enough come of pain and
suffering."</p>

<p>Cuffy's legs were getting <i>very</i> tired with sitting still.
Sliding down from the log, he jumped and danced, feeling now
somehow all glad inside. "I will say music, too, when I am
big."</p>

<p>"<i>Ja ja!</i> but so easy is it not to shake the music out of
the sleeve. Man must study hard. It belongs a whole lifetime
thereto...and much, much courage. But this I will tell you, my
little ambitious one! Here is lying"&mdash;and the Baron waved his
arm all round him&mdash;"a great, new music hid. He who makes it,
he will put into it the thousand feelings awoken in him by this
emptiness and space, this desolation; with always the serene blue
heaven above, and these pale, sad, so grotesque trees that weep and
rave. He puts the golden wattle in it when it blooms and reeks, and
this melancholy bush, oh, so old, so old, and this silence as of
death that nothing stirs. No birdleins will sing in his Musik. But
will you be that one, my son, you must first have given up all else
for it...all the joys and pleasures that make the life glad. These
will be for the others not for you, my dear...you must only go
wizout...renounce...look on.&mdash;But come, let us now home, and I
will speak...yes, I shall speak of it to the good Mamma and
Papa!"</p>

<p>"Preposterous, I call it!" said Mary warmly and threw the letter
on the table. The Baron's departure was three days old by now, and
the letter she had just read was written in his hand. "Only a man
could propose such a thing. Why don't you say something, Richard?
Surely you don't..."</p>

<p>"No, I can see it's out of the question."</p>

<p>"I should think so! At <i>his</i> age!...why, he's a mere baby.
How the Baron could think for a moment we should let a tot like
that leave home...to live among strangers&mdash;with these Hermanns
or Germans or whatever he calls them&mdash;why, it's almost too
silly to discuss. As for his offer to defray all expenses out of
his own pocket...no doubt he means it well...but it strikes me as
very tactless. Does he think we can't afford to pay for our own
children?"</p>

<p>"I'll warrant such an idea never entered his head. My dear, you
don't understand."</p>

<p>"It's you I don't understand. As a rule you flare up at the mere
mention of money. Yet you take this quite calmly."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Mary! the man means it for a compliment. He not only
took a liking to the boy, but he's a connoisseur in music, a
thoroughly competent judge. Surely it ought to flatter you, my
dear, to hear his high opinion of our child's gift."</p>

<p>"I don't need an outsider to tell me that. If any one knows
Cuffy is clever it's me. I ought to: I've done everything for
him."</p>

<p>"This has nothing to do with cleverness."</p>

<p>"Why not? What else is it?"</p>

<p>"It's music, my dear!" cried Mahony, waxing impatient. "Music,
and the musical faculty...ear, instinct, inborn receptivity."</p>

<p>"<i>Well?</i>"</p>

<p>"Good God, Mary!...it sometimes seems as if we spoke a different
language. The fact of the matter is, you haven't a note of music in
you."</p>

<p>Mary was deeply hurt. "I, who have taught the child everything
he knows? He wouldn't even be able to read his notes yet, if it had
been left to you. Haven't I stood over him, and drummed things into
him, and kept him at the piano? And all the thanks I get for it is
to hear that I'm not capable of judging...haven't a note of music
in me! The truth is, I'm good enough to work and slave to make ends
meet. But when it comes to anything else, anything
<i>cleverer</i>...then the first outsider knows better than I do.
Thank God, I've still got my children. They at least look up to me.
And that brings me back to where I started. I've got them, and I
mean to keep them. Nothing shall part me from them. If Cuffy goes,
I go too!"</p>

<p>On the verandah the three in question played a game of their own
devising. They poked at each other round a corner of the house,
with sticks for swords, advancing and retreating to the cry of
"Shooh, man!" from the army of the twins, to which Cuffy made
vigorous response: "Shooh, woman!"</p>

<p>And this phrase, which remained in use long after its origin was
forgotten, was the sole trace left on Cuffy's life by the Baron's
visit.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-3-1-10" id="ch-3-1-10"></a>Chapter X</h3>

<p>The almond-trees that grew in a clump at the bottom of the
garden had shed their pink blossom and begun to form fruit. At
first, did you slily bite one of the funny long green things in
two, you came to a messy jelly...bah! it <i>was</i> nasty...you
spat it out again as quick as you could. But a little later, though
you could still get your teeth through the green shell, which was
hairy on your tongue and sourer than ever, you found a delicious
white slippery kernel inside. Cuffy made this discovery one
afternoon when Mamma had gone to the Bank to tea, and Miss
Prestwick was busy writing letters. He ate freely of the delicacy;
and his twin shadows demanded to eat, too. Their milk teeth being
waggly, he bit the green casing through for them; and they fished
out the kernels for themselves.</p>

<p>That night, there were loud cries for Mamma. Hurrying to them,
candle in hand, Mary found the children pale and distressed, their
little bodies cramped with grinding, colicky pains. Green
almonds?&mdash;"Oh, you naughty, <i>naughty</i> children! Haven't I
told you never to touch them? Where was Miss
Prestwick?&mdash;There! I've always said it: she isn't <i>fit</i>
to have charge of them. I shall pack her off in the morning."</p>

<p>Followed a time of much pain and discomfort for the
almond-eaters; of worry and trouble for Mary, who for several
nights was up and down. All three paid dearly for their indulgence;
but recovery was not in order of merit. Cuffy, who had enjoyed the
lion's share, was the first to improve: remarkable, agreed Richard,
the power of recuperation possessed by this thin, pale child. The
twins, for all their sturdiness, were harder to bring round.</p>

<p>But at last they, too, were on their feet again, looking very
white and pulled down, it was true; still, there they were, able to
trot about; and their father celebrated the occasion by taking the
trio for a walk by the Lagoon. The world was a new place to the
little prisoners. They paused at every step to wonder and
exclaim.</p>

<p>What happened no one knew. At the time it seemed to Mary that,
for a first walk, Richard was keeping them out too long. However
she said nothing; for they came back in good spirits, ate their
supper of bread and milk with appetite, and went cheerily to
bed.</p>

<p>Then, shortly after midnight, Lallie roused the house with
shrill cries. Running to her, Mary found the child doubled up with
pain and wet with perspiration. By morning she was as ill as
before. There was nothing for it but to buckle down to a fresh bout
of nursing.</p>

<p>Of the two lovely little blue-eyed, fair-haired girls, who were
the joy of their parents' lives as Cuffy was the pride: of these,
Mahony's early whimsy that a single soul had been parcelled out
between two bodies still held good. Not an act in their six short
years but had, till now, been a joint one. Hand in hand, cheek to
cheek, they faced their tiny experiences, turning to each other to
share a titbit, a secret, a smile. But if, in such oneness, there
could be talk of a leader, then it was Lallie who led. A quarter of
an hour older, a fraction of an inch taller, half a pound heavier,
she had always been a thought bolder than her sister, a hint
quicker to take the proffered lollipop, to speak out her baby
thoughts. Just as Cuffy was their common model, so Lucie patterned
herself on Lallie; and, without Lallie, was only half herself; even
a temporary separation proving as rude a wrench as though they had
been born with a fleshly bond.&mdash;And it was a real trial, in
the days that followed, to hear the bereft Lucie's plaintive wail:
"Where's Lallie? I want Lallie...I want Lallie." "Surely, Cuffy,
you can manage to keep her amused? Play with her, dear. Let her do
just as she likes," said Mary&mdash;with a contorted face, in the
act of wringing a flannel binder out of all but boiling water.</p>

<p>She spoke briskly; was cheerful, and of good heart. For, in the
beginning, no suspicion of anything being seriously amiss crossed
her mind. It was just a relapse, and as such needed carefullest
nursing and attention. In the course of the fifth day, however, one
or two little things that happened stirred a vague uneasiness in
her. Or rather she saw afterwards that this had been so: at the
moment she had let the uncomfortable impressions escape her with
all speed. It struck her that the child's progress was very slow.
Also she noticed that Richard tried another remedy. However, this
change seemed to the good; towards evening Lallie fell into a
refreshing sleep. But when next morning after a broken night she
drew up the blind, something in the child's aspect brought back,
with a rush and intensified, her hazy disquiets of the previous
day. Lallie was oddly dull. She would not open her eyes properly or
answer when spoken to; and she turned her face from the cooling
drink that was held to her lips.</p>

<p>"She doesn't seem so well this morning."</p>

<p>Mary's voice was steady as she uttered these words&mdash;this
commonplace of the sickroom. But even as she spoke, she became
aware of the cold fear that was laying itself round her heart. It
seemed to sink, to grow strangely leaden, as she watched Richard
make the necessary examination...ever so gently...she had never
really known how tender his hands were, till she saw them used on
the shrinking body of his own child.&mdash;"Papa's darling...Papa's
good little girl."&mdash;But the sheet drawn up again he avoided
meeting her eyes. As if that would help him! She who could read his
face as if it were a book...how did he hope to deceive
<i>her?</i>&mdash;and where one of her own babies was
concerned.</p>

<p>"Richard, what is it? Do you..."</p>

<p>"Now, my dear, don't get alarmed. There's bound to be a certain
amount of prostration...till the dysentery is checked. I shall try
ipecac."</p>

<p>But neither ipecacuanha nor yet a compound
mixture&mdash;administered in the small doses suited to so young a
patient&mdash;had any effect. The inflammation persisted, racking
the child with pain, steadily draining her of strength. It was a
poor limp little sweat-drenched body, with loosely bobbing head,
that Mary, had she to lift it, held in her arms. Throughout this
day too, the sixth, she was forced to listen, sitting helplessly
by, to a sound that was half a wail and half a moan of utter
lassitude. And towards evening a more distressing symptom set in,
in the shape of a convulsive retching. On her knees beside the bed,
her right arm beneath Lallie's shoulders, Mary suffered, in her own
vitals, the struggle that contorted the little body prior to the
fit of sickness. Hers, too, the heartrending task of trying to
still the child's terror&mdash;the frightened eyes, the arms
imploringly outheld, the cries of "Mamma, Mamma!" to the person who
had never yet failed to help&mdash;as the spasms began anew.</p>

<p>"It's <i>all</i> right, my darling, my precious! Mamma's
here&mdash;here, close beside you. There, there! It'll soon be
better now."&mdash;And so it went on for the greater part of the
night.</p>

<p>In the intervals between the attacks when the exhausted child
dozed heavily, Mary, not venturing to move from her knees, laid her
face down on the bed, and wrestled with the One she held
responsible. "Oh, God, be merciful! She's such a little child,
God!...to have to suffer so. Oh, spare her!...spare my baby."</p>

<p>By morning light she was horrified to find that the little
tongue had turned brown. The shock of this discovery was so great
that it drove over her lips a thought that had come to her in the
night...had haunted her...only to be thrust back into the limbo
where it belonged. What if Richard...if perhaps some new remedy had
been invented since last he was in practice, which he didn't know
of?&mdash;he had been out of the way of things so long.</p>

<p>Now, a wild fear for her child's life drowned all lesser
considerations. "What...what about getting a second opinion?"</p>

<p>Mahony looked sadly at her and laid his hand on her shoulder.
"Mary...dear wife&mdash;" he began; then broke off: too well he
knew the agonies of self-reproach that might await her. "Yes,
you're right. I tell you what I'll do. I'll run up to the station
and get Pendrell to telegraph to Oakworth. There's a man there...I
happen to know his name."</p>

<p>Never a moment's hesitation over the expense it would put him
to: never a sign of hurt at the doubt cast on his own skill. From
where she sat, Mary watched him go: he took a short-cut up the back
yard, past kitchen and henhouse. Oh! but he had no hat on...had
gone out without one...had <i>forgotten</i> to put his hat
on&mdash;he who was so afraid of the sun! As she grasped what the
omission meant, at the lightning-flash it gave her into his own
state of mind, she clenched her hands till her nails cut her
palms.</p>

<p>At earliest the doctor could not arrive before five o'clock. All
through the long hours of that long, hot day, she sat and waited
for his coming: pinning her faith to it&mdash;as one who is
whirling down a precipitous slope snatches at any frail root or
blade of grass that offers to his hand. Something&mdash;some
miracle would...<i>must</i>...happen&mdash;to save her child. She
was quite alone. Richard had to attend his patients, and in the
afternoon to drive into the bush: other people could not be put
off, or neglected, because his own child lay ill. The wife of the
Bank Manager, hearing of their trouble, came and took away the
other children. And there Mary sat, heedless of food or rest,
conscious only of the little tortured body on the bed before her;
sat and fanned off the flies, and pulled up or turned down the
sheet, according as fever or the rigors shook the child, noting
each creeping change for the worse, snatching at fantastic changes
for the better. Her lips were thin and dogged in her haggard face;
her eyes burned like coals: it was as if, within her, she was
engaged in concentrating a store of strength, with which to invest
her child.&mdash;But on going out to the kitchen to prepare fresh
rice-water, she became aware that, for all the broiling heat of the
day, her hands were numb with cold.</p>

<p>Richard came rushing home to meet the train. To warn, too, the
stranger to caution. "Not a word, I beg of you, before my wife. She
is breaking her heart over it."</p>

<p>But one glimpse of the man who entered the room at Richard's
side brought Mary's last hope crashing about her ears; and in this
moment she faced the fact that Lallie must die. The newcomer was
just an ordinary country doctor&mdash;well she knew the
type!&mdash;rough, burly, uncouth. Into the ordered stillness of
the sickroom he brought the first disturbance. He tripped over the
mat, his boots creaked, his hands were clumsy&mdash;or seemed so,
compared with Richard's. Oh! the madness of calling in a man like
this, when she had Richard at her side. Fool, fool that she was!
Now, her only desire was to be rid of him again. She turned away,
unable to look on while he handled Lallie,
disarranged&mdash;hurt&mdash;her, in pulling back the sheet and
exposing the distended drum-like little body. ("Um...just so.") His
manner to Richard, too, was galling; his tone one of patronage. He
no doubt regarded him as some old hack who had doddered his life
away up-country, and could now not treat even a case of dysentery
without the aid of a younger man. And for this, which was all her
doing, Richard would have to sit with him and listen to him till
the down train went at ten. It was too much for Mary. The tears
that had obstinately refused to flow for the greater grief rose to
her eyes, and were so hot and angry that they scorched the back of
her lids.</p>

<p>That night, in the stillness that followed his departure, the
last torment was inflicted on the dying child in the shape of a
monstrous hiccough. It started from far, far down, shot out with
the violence of an explosion, and seemed as if it would tear the
little body in two. Under this new blow Mary's courage all but
failed her. In vain did Mahony, his arm round her bent shoulders,
try to soothe her. "My darling, it sounds worse than it is. We feel
it more than she does...now." Each time it burst forth an
irrepressible shudder ran through Mary, as if it were she herself
who was being racked. And on this night her passionate prayer ran:
"Take her, God!...take her if You must. I give her back to You. But
oh! let it be soon...stop her suffering...give her peace." And as
hour after hour dragged by without respite, she rounded on Him and
fiercely upbraided Him. "It is cruel of You...cruel! No earthly
father would torture a child as You are doing...You, all-powerful,
and called Love!"</p>

<p>But little by little, so stealthily that its coming was
imperceptible, the ultimate peace fell: by daybreak there was
nothing more to hope or fear. Throughout the long day that
followed&mdash;it seemed made of years, yet passed like an
hour&mdash;Lallie lay in coma, drawing breaths that were part
snores, part heavy sighs. Time and place ceased to exist for Mary,
as she sat and watched her child die. Through noon and afternoon
and on into the dark, she tirelessly wiped the damp brow and matted
curls, fanned off the greedy flies, one little inert hand held
firmly in her own: perhaps somehow, on this, her darling's last,
fearsome journey, the single journey in her short life that she had
taken unattended, something would tell her that her mother was with
her, her mother's love keeping and holding her. On this day Richard
did not leave the house. And their kind friend again fetched away
the other children.</p>

<p>The <i>other</i> children?...what need now of this word!
Henceforth, there would always and for ever be only two. Never
again, if not by accident, would the proud words, "My three," cross
her lips. There she sat, committing to oblivion her mother-store of
fond and foolish dreams, the lovely fabric of hopes and plans that
she had woven about this little dear one's life; sat bidding
farewell to many a tiny endearing feature of which none but she
knew: in the spun-glass hair the one rebellious curl that would not
twist with the rest; secret dimples kneaded in the baby body; the
tiny birthmark below the right shoulder; the chubby, dimpled
hands&mdash;Richard's hands in miniature&mdash;all now destined to
be shut away and hidden from sight. Oh, of what was use to create
so fair a thing, merely to destroy it! (They say He knows all, but
never, never can He have known what it means to be a mother.)</p>

<p>Midnight had struck before Mahony could half lead, half carry
her from the room. Her long agony of suspense over, she collapsed,
broke utterly down, in a way that alarmed him. He ran for
restoratives; bathed her forehead; himself undressed her and got
her to bed. Only then came the saving tears, setting free the
desperate and conflicting emotions, till now so rigorously held in
check, in a storm of grief of which he had never known the like.
There was something primitive about it, savage even. For in it Mary
wept the passion of her life&mdash;her children. And over the
sacrifice she was now called on to make, her heart bled, as raw, as
lacerated, as once her body had lain in giving them birth.</p>

<p>For long Mahony made no attempt to soothe or restrain. Well for
her that she could weep! A nature like Mary's would not be
chastened by suffering: never would she know resignation; or
forgive the injury that had been done her. This physical outlet was
her sole means of relief.</p>

<p>But the moment came when he put out his hand and sought hers.
"Wife...my own dearest!...it is not for ever. You...we...shall see
our child again."</p>

<p>But Mary would have none of it. Vehemently she tore her hand
away. "Oh, what does that help?...help <i>me!</i> I want her
now...and here. I want to hold her in my arms...and feel her...and
hear her speak. She will never speak to me again. Oh, my baby, my
baby!...and I loved you so."</p>

<p>"She knew it well. She still does."</p>

<p>"How do <i>you</i> know?...how do you <i>know?</i> Those are
only words. They may do for you...But I was her mother. She was
mine; my very own. And do you think she wanted to die...and leave
me? They tore her away&mdash;and tortured her&mdash;and frightened
her. They may be frightening her still...such a little child, alone
and frightened...and me not able to get to her!&mdash;Oh,
<i>why</i> should this just happen to us? Other people's children
grow up...grow old. And we are so few...why, <i>why</i> had it to
be?"</p>

<p><i>Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa</i>! "If only I had never brought
you to this accursed place!"</p>

<p>There was an instant's pause, a momentary cessation of her
laboured breathing, as the bed shook under the shudders that stand
to a man for sobs, before she flung round and drew him to her.</p>

<p>"Mary, Mary!...I meant it for the best."</p>

<p>"I know you did, I know. I <i>won't</i> have you blame yourself.
It might have happened anywhere." (Oh, my baby, my baby!)</p>

<p>Now they clung to each other, all the petty differences they
laboured under obliterated by their common grief. Till suddenly a
sound fell on their ears, driving them apart to listen: it was
little Lucie, waking from sleep in an empty bed and crying with
fear. Rising, her father carried her over and laid her down in his
own warm place; and Mary, recalled from her profitless weeping by a
need greater than her own, held out her arms and gathered the child
in. "It's all right, my darling. Mamma's here."</p>

<p>This, the ultimate remedy. Half an hour later when he crept back
to look, mother and child slept, tear-stained cheek to cheek.</p>

<p>His hand in his father's, Cuffy was led into the little room
where Lallie lay.&mdash;"I want them to have no morbid fear of
death."</p>

<p>On waking that morning&mdash;after a rather jolly day spent at
the Bank...or what would have been jolly, if Lucie hadn't been such
a cry-baby...where he had been allowed to try to lift a bar of gold
and to step inside the great safe: on waking, Cuffy heard the
amazing news that Lallie had gone away: God had taken her to live
with Him. His eyes all but dropped out of his head, a dozen
questions jumped to his tongue; but he did not ask one of them; for
Mamma never stopped crying, and Papa looked as he did when you
didn't talk to him, but got away and tried not to remember. So
Cuffy sat on the edge of the verandah and felt most awfully
surprised. What had happened was too strange, too far removed from
the range of his experience, too "interesting," to let any other
feeling come up in him. He wondered and wondered...why God had done
it...and why He had just wanted Lallie. Now he himself...well, Luce
<i>had</i> got so whiny!</p>

<p>But the darkened room and a sheet over the whole bed did
something funny to him...inside. And, as his father turned the
slats of the venetian so that a pale daylight filtered in, Cuffy
asked&mdash;in a voice he meant to make whispery and small, but
which came out hoarse like a crow: "What's she covered up like that
for?"</p>

<p>For answer Mahony drew back the double layer of mosquito
netting, and displayed the little sister's face. "Don't be afraid,
Cuffy. She's only asleep." And indeed it might well have been so.
Here were no rigidly trussed limbs, no stiffly folded arms: the
heave of the breath alone was missing. Lallie lay with one little
hand under her cheek, her curls tumbling naturally over her
shoulder. The other hand held a nosegay, a bit of gaudy red
geranium tied up with one of its own leaves&mdash;the single poor
flower Mahony had found still a-bloom in the garden.</p>

<p>"Kiss her Cuffy."</p>

<p>Cuffy obeyed&mdash;and got a shock. "Why's she so cold?"</p>

<p>"Because her spirit is flown. This dear little body, that we
have known and loved, was only the house of the spirit; and now is
empty and must fade. But though we shall not see her, our Lallie
will go on living and growing...in a grace and beauty such as earth
cannot show." And more to himself than to the boy beside him Mahony
murmured:</p>

<p>Not as a child shall we again behold her,<br>
For when, with raptures wild,<br>
In our embraces we again enfold her,<br>
She will not be a child,<br>
But a fair maiden in her father's mansions...</p>

<p>"Will she...do you mean...be grown up?" And Cuffy fixed wide,
affrighted eyes on his father. For in listening to these words, he
had a sudden vision of a Lallie who looked just like Miss Prestwick
or Cousin Emmy, with a little small waist, and bulgings, and tight,
high, buttoned boots. And against this picture especially the
boots&mdash;something in him rose and screamed with repugnance. He
wanted Lallie's fat little legs in socks and strapped shoes, as he
had always known them. He <i>would</i> not have her different!</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no...<i>no</i>!" And with this, his habitual defence
against the things he was unwilling to face, Cuffy tore his hand
away and escaped to his sanctuary at the bottom of the garden.</p>

<p>Here for the first time a sense of loss came over him. (It was
the boots had done it.) What, never see Lallie any more?...as his
little fat sister? It couldn't be true...it couldn't! "I don't
believe it...I <i>don't</i> believe it!" (Hadn't they told him that
very morning that God had taken her away, when all the time she was
in there lying on the bed?) And this attitude of doubt persisted;
even though, when he got back the next afternoon from a long walk
with Maria, God had kept His word and she was gone. But many and
many a day passed before Cuffy gave up expecting her to re-appear.
Did he go into an empty room, or turn a corner of the verandah, it
seemed to him that he <i>must</i> find Lallie there: suddenly she
would have come back, and everything be as it was before. For
since, by their father's care, all the sinister ceremonials and
paraphernalia of death were kept from them, he was free to go on
regarding it solely in the light of an abrupt disappearance...and
if you could be spirited away in this fashion, who was to say if
you mightn't just as easily pop up again? Also by Mahony's wish,
neither he nor Lucie ever set foot in the outlying bush cemetery,
where in due time a little cross informed the curious that the
small mound before them hid the mortal remains of Alicia Mary
Townshend-Mahony, aged five and a half years. Providing people, at
the same time, with a puzzle to scratch their heads over. For, in
place of the usual reference to lambs and tender shepherds, they
found themselves confronted by the words: DANS L'ESPOIR. And what
the meaning of this heathenish term might be, none in Barambogie
knew, but all were suspicious of.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>"We've simply <i>got</i> to afford it," was Mary's grim
reply.&mdash;There she stood, her gaunt eyes fixed on Richard, the
embodiment of a mother-creature at bay to protect her young.</p>

<p>Christmas had come and gone, and the fierce northern summer was
upon them in earnest. Creeks and water-holes were dry now, rivers
shrunk to a trickling thread; while that was brown straw which had
once been grass. And Mary, worn down by heat and mental suffering,
was fretting her heart out over her remaining baby, little Lucie,
now but the ghost of her former self. Coming on top of Lucie's own
illness, her twin-sister's death had struck her a blow from which
she did not seem able to recover. And to see the child droop and
fade before her very eyes rendered Mary desperate. This was why, to
Richard's procrastinating and undecided: "I must see if I can
afford it," she had flung out her challenge: "We've <i>got</i>
to!"</p>

<p>"I suppose you're right."</p>

<p>"I know I am!"</p>

<p>Many and heartfelt had been the expressions of sympathy from
those friends and acquaintances who had read the brief notice on
the front page of the <i>Argus</i>. Outsiders, too, people Mary had
almost forgotten, showed that they still remembered her, by
condoling with her in her loss. But it was left to dear old Tilly
to translate sentiment into practical aid.</p>

<p>HOW I FEEL FOR YOU, MY DARLING, WORDS WOULDN'T TELL. IT'S THE
CRUELLEST THING EVER HAPPENED. BUT OH, THE BLESSING, MARY, THAT
YOU'VE STILL GOT YOUR OTHER TWO. YOU MUST JUST REMEMBER HOW MUCH
THEY NEED YOU, LOVE, WHILE THEY'RE SO SMALL, AND HOW MUCH YOU ARE
TO THEM.&mdash;AND NOW HARK TO ME, MY DEAR. I'D BEEN PLANNING
BEFORE THIS TO TAKE A SHANTY AT LORNE FOR THE HOT WEATHER; AND WHAT
I WANT IS FOR YOU TO COME AND SHARE IT WITH ME&mdash;SHARE
EXPENSES, IF YOU LIKE, ME KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE. BUT GET THE CHICKS
AWAY FROM THAT WICKED HEAT YOU MUST.&mdash;BESIDES, HELPING TO LOOK
AFTER BABY'LL BE THE BEST OF MEDICINES FOR THAT POOR FORLORN LITTLE
MITE, WHO IT MAKES MY HEART ACHE EVEN TO THINK OF.</p>

<p>Too great were the odds&mdash;in this case the welfare, perhaps
the very life, of his remaining children&mdash;against him. Mahony
bowed his head. And when Mary had gone he unlocked a private drawer
of his table, and drew out a box in which lay several rolls of
notes, carefully checked and numbered. Once more he counted them
through. For weeks, nay, for months he had been laboriously adding
pound to pound. In all there were close on forty of them. He had
fully intended to make it fifty by New Year. Now there was no help:
it would have to go. First, the doctor's fare from Oakworth; then
the costs of the funeral...with a five-pound note to the parson.
What was left after these things were paid must be sacrificed to
Mary and the children. They would need every penny of it...and more
besides.</p>

<p>To come back to the empty house, having watched the train carry
them off ("Kiss papa good bye!...good bye...good bye, my darlings!
Come back with rosy cheeks.&mdash;Try to forget, Mary...my poor old
wife!"): to come back to the empty house was like facing death
anew. All the doors, three on each side of the central passage,
stood open, showing unnatural-looking rooms. Mary had done her best
to leave things tidy, but she had not been able to avoid the last
disorder inevitable on a journey. Odd sheets of newspaper lay
about, and lengths of twine; the floors were unswept, the beds
unmade; one of the children had dropped a glove...Mahony stooped to
it...Cuffy's, for a wager, seeing that the middle finger was chewed
to pulp. And as he stood holding it, it seemed as if from out these
yawning doors, these dismal rooms, one or other of his little ones
must surely dart and run to him, with a cry of "Papa...Papa!" But
not a sound broke the silence, no shadow smudged the whitewash of
the walls.</p>

<p>The first shock over, however, the litter cleared up, the rooms
dressed, he almost relished the hush and peace to which the going
of wife and children had left him. For one thing, he could rest on
the knowledge that he had done for them all that was humanly
possible. In return, he would, for several weeks to come, be spared
the mute reproach of two wan little faces, and a mother's haggard
eyes. Nor need he crack his brains for a time over the problem of
an education for the children in this wilderness, or be chafed by
Mary's silent but pregnant glosses on the practice. In a word he
was <i>free</i>...free to exist unobserving and unobserved.</p>

<p>But his satisfaction was short-lived: by the end of the second
day the deathlike stillness had begun to wear him down. Maria was
shut off in the detached kitchen; and on getting home of a late
afternoon he knew that, but for the final mill-screech, and the
distant rumble of the ten-o'clock train, no mortal sound would
reach his ears the long night through. The silence gathered,
descended and settled upon him, like a fog or a cloud. There was
something ominous about it, and instead of reading he found himself
listening...listening. Only very gradually did the thought break
through that he had something to listen for. Dark having fallen,
might not a tiny ghost, a little spirit that had not yet found rest
afar from those it loved, flit from room to room in search of them?
What more likely indeed? He strained his ears. But only his pulses
buzzed there. On the other hand, about eleven o'clock one night, on
coming out of the surgery to cross to the bedroom, he could have
sworn to catching a glimpse of a little shape...vague, misty of
outline, gone even as he saw it, and yet unmistakable...vanishing
in the doorway of the children's room. His heart gave a great leap
of joy and recognition. Swiftly following, he called a name; but on
the empty air: the room had no occupant. For two nights after he
kept watch, to waylay the apparition should it come; but, shy of
human eyes, it did not show itself again. Not to be baulked, he
tried a fresh means: taking a sheet of paper he let his hand lie
lightly along the pencil. And, lo and behold! at the second trial
the pencil began to move, seemed to strive to form words; while by
the fourth evening words were coming through. HER MAMMA...HER
LUCE...WANTS HER MAMMA.</p>

<p>The kitchen clock had stopped: Maria, half undressed, stealing
tiptoe into the house to see the time, a tin lamp with a reflector
in her hand, was pulled up short, half-way down the passage, by the
sound of voices. Hello! who was Doctor talking to? A patient at
this hour? But nobody had knocked at the door. And what...oh,
crikey! whatever was he saying? The girl's eyes and mouth opened,
and her cheeks went pale, as the sense of what she heard broke on
her. Pressing herself against the wall, she threw a terrified
glance over her shoulder into the inky shadows cast by the
lamp.&mdash; "Ma! I was fair skeered out of me senses. To hear 'im
sitting there a-talkin' to that pore little kid, what's been dead
and buried this month and more! An' him calling her by her name,
and saying her Ma would soon be back, and then she wouldn't need to
feel lonely any more&mdash;why, I tell yer, even this mornin' in
broad daylight I found meself lookin' behind me the whole
time.&mdash;Go back? Stop another night there? Not me! I couldn't,
Ma. I'm <i>skeered</i>."</p>

<p>"You great ninny, you! What could 'urt yer, I'd like to
know?...as long as you say yer prayers reg'lar and tells the troof.
Ghosts, indeed! I'll ghost you!"&mdash;But Maria, more
imaginatively fibred, was not to be won over.</p>

<p>Mahony listened to the excuses put forward by her mother on his
reaching home that evening: listened with the kindly courtesy he
kept for those beneath him who met him civilly and with respect.
Maria's plea of loneliness was duly weighed. "Though I must say I
think she has hardly given the new conditions a fair trial.
However, she has always been a good girl, and the plan you propose,
Mrs. Beetling, will no doubt answer very well during my wife's
absence."</p>

<p>It not only answered: it was an improvement. Breakfast was
perhaps served a little later than usual, and the cooking proved
rather coarser than Maria's, who was Mary-trained. But it was all
to the good that, supper over, Mrs. Beetling put on her bonnet and
went home, leaving the place clear. His beloved little ghost was
then free to flit as it would, without fear of surprise or
disturbance. He continually felt its presence&mdash;though it did
not again materialise&mdash;and message after message continued to
come through. Written always by a third person, in an unfamiliar
hand...as was only to be expected, considering that the twins still
struggled with pothooks and hangers...they yet gave abundant proof
of their authorship.</p>

<p>Such a proof, for instance, as the night when he found that his
script ran: HER BABY...NOSE...KITCHEN FIRE.</p>

<p>For a long time he could make nothing of this, though he twisted
it this way and that. Then, however, it flashed upon him that the
twins had nursed large waxen dolls clad as infants; and straightway
he rose to look for the one that had been Lallie's. After a lengthy
search by the light of a single candle, in the course of which he
ransacked various drawers and boxes, he found the object in
question...tenderly wrapped and hidden away in Mary's wardrobe. He
drew it forth in its white trappings and, upon his soul, when he
held it up to the candle to examine it, he found that one side of
the effigy's nose had run together in a kind of
blob...<i>melted</i>...no doubt through having been left lying in
the sun, or&mdash;yes, <i>or</i> held too close to a fire! Of a
certainty he had known nothing of this: never a word had been said,
in <i>his</i> hearing, of the accident to so expensive a plaything.
At the time of purchase he had been wroth with Mary over the
needless outlay. Now...now...oh! there's a divinity that shapes our
ends...now it served him as an irrefragable proof.</p>

<p>In his jubilation he added a red-hot postscript to his daily
letter. I HAVE GREAT&mdash;GREAT AND JOYFUL&mdash;NEWS FOR YOU, MY
DARLING. BUT I SHALL KEEP IT TILL YOU COME BACK. IT WILL BE
SOMETHING FOR YOU TO LOOK FORWARD TO, ON YOUR RETURN TO THIS
DREADFUL PLACE.</p>

<p>To which Mary replied: YOU MAKE ME VERY CURIOUS, RICHARD. CAN
NORTH LONG TUNNELS HAVE STRUCK THE REEF AT LAST?</p>

<p>And he: SOMETHING FAR, FAR NEARER OUR HEARTS, MY DEAR, THAN
MONEY AND SHARES. I REFER TO NEWS COMPARED WITH WHICH EVERYTHING
EARTHLY FADES INTO INSIGNIFICANCE.</p>

<p>Alas! he roused no answering enthusiasm. NOW, RICHARD, DON'T
DELUDE YOURSELF...OR LET YOURSELF BE DELUDED. OF COURSE YOU KNEW
ABOUT THAT DOLL'S NOSE. LALLIE CRIED AND WAS SO UPSET. I'M SURE
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS ALL YOUR OWN IMAGINATION. I DO THINK ONE CAN
GROSSLY DECEIVE ONESELF&mdash;ESPECIALLY NOW YOU'RE QUITE ALONE.
BUT OH DON'T TRIFLE WITH OUR GREAT SORROW. I COULDN'T BEAR IT. IT'S
STILL TOO NEAR AND TOO BITTER.</p>

<p>Of his little ghostly visitant he asked that night: HOW SHALL WE
EVER PROVE, LOVE, TO DEAR MAMMA THAT YOU ARE REALLY AND TRULY HER
LOST DARLING?</p>

<p>To which came the oddly disconcerting, matter-of-fact reply:
USELESS. OTHER THINGS TO DO. COME NATURAL TO SOME. NOT TO HER. But
Mahony could not find it in his heart to let the matter rest there.
So fond a mother, and to be unwilling...not to dare to TRUST
herself...to believe!</p>

<p>And believe what, too? Why, merely that their little one, in
place of becoming a kind of frozen image of the child they had
known, and inhabiting remote, fantastic realms to which they might
some day laboriously attain: that she was still with them, close to
them, loving and clinging, and as sportive as in her brief earthly
span. It was no doubt this homely, <i>undignified</i> aspect of the
life-to-come that formed the stumbling-block: for people like Mary,
death was inconceivable apart from awfulness and majesty: in this
guise alone had it been rung and sung into them. For him, the very
lack of dignity was the immense, consoling gain. Firmly convinced
of the persistence of human individuality subsequent to the great
change, he had now been graciously permitted to see how thin were
the walls between the two worlds, how interpenetrable the states.
And he rose of a morning, and lay down at night, his heart warm
with gratitude to the Giver of knowledge.</p>

<p>But a little child-ghost, no longer encased in the lovely
rounded body that had enhanced its baby prattle and, as it were,
decked it out: a little ghost had, after all, not very much to say.
A proof of identity given, assurances exchanged that it still loved
and was loved, and the talk trickled naturally to an end. You could
not put your arms round it, and hold it to you in a wordless
content. Also, as time passed and Lallie grew easier in her new
state, it was not to be denied that she turned a trifle freakish.
She would not always come when called, and, pressed as to where she
lingered, averred through her mentor that she was "fossicking." An
attempt to get at the meaning of this involved Mahony in a long,
rambling conversation with the elder ghost, that was dreary in the
extreme. For it hinged mainly on herself and her own affairs. And,
grateful though he was to her for her goodness to his child, he
took no interest in her personally; and anything in the nature of a
discussion proved disastrous. For she had been but a seamstress in
her day, and a seamstress she remained; having, it would seem,
gained nothing through her translation, either in knowledge or
spirituality.</p>

<p>He flagged. To grip him, an occupation needed to be
meaty&mdash;to give him something with which to tease his brains.
And his present one, supplying none, began little by little to
pall, leaving him to the melancholy reflection that, for all their
aliveness, our lost ones were truly lost to us, because no longer
entangled in the web called living. Impossible for those who had
passed on to continue to grieve for a broken doll; to lay weight on
the worldly triumphs and failures that meant so much to us; to
concern themselves with the changing seasons, the rising up and
lying down, the palaver, pother and ado that made up daily life.
Though the roads to be followed started from a single point, they
swiftly branched off at right angles, never to touch again while we
inhabited our earthly shell...and in this connection, he fell to
thinking of people long dead, and of how out of place, how <i>in
the way</i> they would be, did they now come back to earth. We
mortals were, for worse or better, ever on the move. Impossible for
us to return to the stage at which <i>they</i> had known us.</p>

<p>And so it came about that one evening when, with many a silent
groan, he had for close on half an hour transcribed the
seamstress's platitudes (if it was himself who wrote, as Mary
averred, then God help him!...he was in, beyond question, for
cerebral softening) with never a word or a sign from Lallie: on
this evening he abruptly threw the pencil from him, pushed back his
chair and strode out on the verandah. He needed air, fresh air; was
ravenous for it...to feel his starved lungs fill and expand. But
the December night was hotter even than the day had been; and what
passed for air was stale and heavy with sunbaked dust. The effort
of inhaling it, the repugnance this smell roused in him brought him
to. Like a man waking from a trance, he looked round him with dazed
eyes, and ran a confused hand over his forehead. And in this moment
the dreams and shadows of the past two weeks scattered, and he
faced reality: it was near midnight, and he stood alone on the
ramshackle verandah, with its three broken steps leading down to
the path; with the drooping, dust-laden shrubs of the garden before
him; the bed of dust that formed the road beyond. He had come to
earth again&mdash;and with a bump.</p>

<p>A boundless depression seized him: a sheerly intolerable
flatness, after the mood of joyous elation that had gone before. He
felt as though he had been sucked dry: what remained of him was but
an empty shell. Empty as the house which, but for a single lamp,
lay dark and tenantless, and silent as the grave. Since the first
night of Mary's departure, he had not visualised it thus. Now he
was dismayed by it&mdash;and by his own solitude. To rehearse the
bare facts: wife and children were a hundred and fifty miles away;
his other little child lay under the earth; even the servant had
deserted: with the result that there was now not a living creature
anywhere within hail. This miserable Lagoon, this shrunken pool of
stagnant water, effectually cut him off from human company. If
anything should happen to him, if he should be taken ill, or break
a limb, he might lie where he fell till morning, his calls for help
unheard. And the thought of this utter isolation, once admitted,
swelled to alarming proportions. His brain raced
madly&mdash;glancing at fire...murder...sudden death. Why, not a
soul here would be able even to summon Mary back to him...no one so
much as knew her address. Till he could bear it no longer: jumping
out of bed, he ran to the surgery and wrote her whereabouts in
large letters on a sheet of paper, which he pinned up in a
conspicuous place.</p>

<p>The first faint streaks of daylight, bringing relief on this
score, delivered him up to a new&mdash;and anything but
chimerical&mdash;anxiety. What was happening...what in the name of
fortune was happening to the practice? Regarding for the first time
the day and the day's business other than as something to be
hurried through, that he might escape to his communion with the
unseen, he was horrified to see how little was doing, how scanty
the total of patients for the past fortnight. And here Mary was
writing that she would shortly need more money.</p>

<p>Nobody at all put in an appearance that morning&mdash;though he
sat out his consulting-hour to the bitter end. By this time he had
succeeded in convincing himself that the newcomer, Mrs. Beetling,
was to blame for the falling-off. Untrained to the job, she had
very probably omitted to note, on the slate provided for the
purpose, the names of those who called while he was absent. Either
she had trusted to her memory and forgotten; or had been out when
she ought to have kept the house; or had failed to hear the bell.
The dickens! What would people think of him, for neglecting them
like this?</p>

<p>By brooding over it, he worked himself into a state of nervous
agitation; and directly half-past ten struck pushed back his chair
and stalked out, to take the culprit to task.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beetling was scrubbing the verandah, her sleeves rolled up
above her elbows, arms and hands newborn-looking from hot water and
soda. At Mahony's approach, she sat back on her heels to let him
by; then, seeing that he intended to speak to her, scrambled to her
feet and dried her hands on her apron.</p>

<p>"I wish to have a word with you, Mrs. Beetling."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>She was civil enough, he would say that for her. In looking up
at him, too, she smiled with a will: a pleasant-faced woman, and
ruddy of cheek...another anomaly in this pale country.</p>

<p>But he fronted her squarely for the first time: at their former
interview he had been concerned only to cut her wordiness short.
And this broad smile of hers advertised the fact that she had gums
bare almost as a babe's; was toothless, save for a few black and
rotten stumps in the lower jaw.</p>

<p>Now Mahony was what Mary called a "fad of the first water" with
regard to the care of the mouth. He never tired of fulminating
against the colonial habit of suffering the untold agonies of
toothache, letting the teeth rot in the head rather than have them
medically attended. And the sight here presented to him so
exasperated him that he clean forgot what he had come out to say,
his irritation hurling itself red-hot against this fresh object of
offence.</p>

<p>As though he had a meek and timid patient before him, he now
said sternly: "Open your mouth...wide!"</p>

<p>"<i>Sir!</i>" Mrs. Beetling's smile faded in amazement.
Instinctively pinching her lips, she blinked at Mahony, turned red,
and fell to twiddling with a corner of her apron. (So far she had
turned a deaf ear to the tales that were going the round about "the
ol' doctor." Now...she wondered.)</p>

<p>"Your mouth...open your mouth!" repeated Mahony, with the same
unnecessary harshness. Then, becoming vaguely aware of the
confusion he was causing, he trimmed his sails. "My good woman...I
have only this moment noticed the disgraceful state of your teeth.
Why, you have not a sound one left in your head! What have you been
about?...never to consult a dentist?"</p>

<p>"Dentist, sir? Not me! Not if I was paid for it! No one'll ever
get me to any dentist."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, you fool!" He snapped his fingers; and went on
snapping them, to express what he thought of her. And Mrs.
Beetling, growing steadily sulkier and more aggrieved, was now
forced to stand and listen to a fierce tirade on the horrors of a
foul mouth and foul breath, on the harm done to the digestive
system, the ills awaiting her in later life. Red as a peony she
stood, her apron still twisting in her fingers, her lips glued
tight; once only venturing a protest. "I never bin ill in me life!"
and still more glumly: "I suppose me teeth's me own. I kin do what
I like with 'em." To and fro paced Mahony, his hands clasped behind
his back, his face aflame; thus ridding himself, on his bewildered
hearer, of his own distractedness, the over-stimulation of his
nerves; and ending up by vowing that, if she had a grain of sense
in her, she would come to the surgery and let him draw from her
mouth such ruins as remained. At which Mrs. Beetling, reading this
as a threat, went purplish, and backed away in real
alarm.&mdash;Not till he was some distance off on his morning
round, did it occur to him that he had forgotten his original
reason in seeking her out. Never a word had he said of her
carelessness in writing up the patients! The result was another
wild bout of irritation&mdash;this time with himself&mdash;and he
had to resist an impulse to turn on his heel. What the deuce would
he do next? What tricks might his failing memory not play him?</p>

<p>On her side also, Mrs. Beetling yielded to second thoughts. Her
first inclination had been to empty her bucket on the garden-bed,
let down her skirts, tie on her bonnet and bang the gate behind
her. But she bit it back. The place was a good one: it 'ud be
lunatic not to keep it warm for Maria. No sooner, though, did she
see Mahony safely away, than she let her indignation fly, and at
the top of her voice. "Well, I'm blowed...blowed, that's what I am!
Wants to pull out all me teef, does he?...the <i>butcher!</i>
Blackguardin' me like that. Of all the lousy ol' ranters..."</p>

<p>"Eh, ma?" said a floury young mill-hand, and leant in passing
over the garden gate. "What's up with you? Bin seein' one of the
spooks?"</p>

<p>"You git along with you, Tom Dorrigan. And take yer arms off
that gate."</p>

<p>"They do say Maria seed one widout a head and all. Holy Mother
o' God protect us!"&mdash;and the lad crossed himself fearfully as
he went.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Beetling, still blown with spite and anger, gathered
her skirt in both hands, and charging at a brood of Brahmapootras
that had invaded the garden to scratch up a bed, scuttled them back
into the yard.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-3-2-2" id="ch-3-2-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>His way led him through the main street. The morning was drawing
towards noon, and the overheated air, grown visible, quivered and
flimmered in wavy lines. He wore nankeen trousers, which looked a
world too wide for him, and flapped to and fro on his bony shanks.
His coat, of tussore, was creased and unfresh, there being no Mary
at hand daily to iron it out. On his head he had a sun-hat hung
with puggaree and fly-veil: he also carried a sun-umbrella,
green-lined; while a pair of dark goggles dimmed for him the
intolerable whiteness of sky, road, iron roofs. Thus he went: an
odd figure, a very figure of fun, in the eyes of the little
township. And yet for all his oddity wearing an air...an air of
hauteur, of touch-me-not aloofness...which set him still further
apart. The small shopkeepers and publicans who made up the bulk of
the population had never known his like; and were given vigorously
to slapping their legs and exclaiming: "By the Lord Harry!...goes
about with his head as high as if he owned the place."</p>

<p>On this day though he passed unnoticed. In the broad,
sun-stricken street, none moved but himself. The heat, however, was
not the sole reason for its emptiness. He who ran might read that
the place was thinning out. With the abandonment of the project to
reorganise the great mine&mdash;the fairy-tale of which had helped
to settle <i>him</i> there&mdash;all hope of a fresh spurt of life
for Barambogie was at an end. The new Bank that was to have been
opened to receive the gold, the crew of miners and engineers who
should have worked the reefs, had already faded into the <i>limbus
fatuorum</i> where, for aught he knew, they had always belonged.
What trade there was, languished: he counted no less than four
little shops in a row which had recently been boarded up.</p>

<p>Pluff went his feet in the smothery dust of the bush
road&mdash;his black boots might have been made of white
leather&mdash;the flies buzzed in chorus round his head. Of the two
visits he had to pay, one was a couple of miles off. Two miles
there and two back...on a morning when even the little walk along
the Lagoon had fagged him. Oh! he <i>ought</i> to have a buggy. A
country practice without a horse and trap behind it was like trying
to exist without bread...or water.&mdash;And now again, as if on
this particular day there was to be no rest or peace for him, a
single thought, flashing into his brain, took entire possession of
it and whizzed madly round. He plodded along, bent of back, loose
of knee, murmuring distractedly: "A buggy...yes, God knows, I ought
to have a buggy." But the prospect of ever again owning one seemed
remote; at present it was as much as he could do to afford the
occasional hire of a conveyance. What must the townspeople think,
to see him eternally on the tramp? For nobody walked here. A buggy
stood at every door...but his. They would soon be beginning to
suspect that something was wrong with him; and from that to
believing him unable to pay his way was but a step. In fancy he saw
himself refused credit, required to hand over cash for what he
purchased...he, Richard Mahony!...till, in foretasting the shame of
it, he groaned aloud.</p>

<p>And the case he had come all this way to attend would not profit
him. His patient was a poor woman, lying very sick and quite alone
in a bark hut, her menfolk having betaken themselves to work. He
did what he could for her; left her more comfortable than he found
her: he also promised medicines by the first cart that went by her
door. But he knew the class: there was no money in it; his bill
would have to be sent in time after time. And the older he grew,
the more it went against the grain to badger patients for his fees.
If they were too mean, or too dishonest, to pay for his services,
he was too proud to dun them. And thus bad debts accumulated.</p>

<p>On the road home, the great heat and his own depression overcame
him. Choosing a shady spot he lowered himself to the burnt grass
for a rest; or what might have been a rest, had not the sound of
wheels almost immediately made him scramble to his feet again: it
would never do for him to be caught sitting by the roadside. In his
haste, he somehow pressed the catch of his bag, which forthwith
opened and spilled its contents on the ground. He was on his knees,
fumbling to replace these, when the trap hove in sight.</p>

<p>It was a single buggy, in which three people, a young man and
two young women, sat squeezed together on a seat built for two.
None the less, the man jerked his horse to a stand, and with true
colonial neighbourliness called across: "Like a lift?"&mdash;to
receive, too late to stop him, a violent dig in the ribs from his
wife's elbow.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, my good man! But you are full already."
Provoked at being caught in his undignified position, Mahony
answered in a tone short to ungraciousness.</p>

<p>"Devil a bit! Bess 'ere can sit by the splashboard."</p>

<p>"<i>No</i>, sir! I should not dream of inconveniencing the lady
on my account."</p>

<p>"O.K.!" said the man. "Ta-ta, then!" and drove on.</p>

<p>"The <i>lady!</i> Did you hear 'im? Oh, Jimminy Gig!...ain't he
a cure?" cried Bess, and bellowed out a laugh that echoed back to
where Mahony stood.</p>

<p>"Bill, you great <i>Goff</i>, didn't you feel me poke you? Don't
you know '<i>Oo</i> that was? We don't want him up here along of
us...not for Joe!"</p>

<p>Bill spat. "Garn! It's a goodish step for th' ol' cove, and a
regular roaster into the bargain."</p>

<p>"Garn yerself, y'ol' mopoke!&mdash;I say! what was 'e doin'
there's what I'd like to know. Did you see him, kneelin' with all
them things spread out around him? Up to some shady trick or other
I'll be bound."</p>

<p>Bess nodded darkly. "Nobody 'ull go near the house any more
after dark. Maria Beetling sor a black figger in the passage one
night, with horns and all, and heard 'im talkin' to it. She tore
home screamin' like mad for her ma."</p>

<p>"Ah, git along with yer bunkum! You wimmin's mouths is allers
full o' some trash or other. I never <i>heard</i> such
talk,"&mdash;and Bill ejected a fresh stream of juice over the
side.</p>

<p>His wife made a noise of contempt. "It's gospel truth. I heard
ol' Warnock the other day talkin' to Mrs. Ah Sing. An' they both
said it was a crying shame to have a doctor here who went in for
magic and such-like. Nor's that all. A fat lot o' good his
doctoring kin be. To go and let his own kid die. If he couldn't
cure <i>it</i>, what kin <i>we</i> hope for, 'oo he hates like
poison?"</p>

<p>"They do say he <i>boiled</i> her," said Bess mysteriously.
"Made her sit in water that was too hot for her, till her skin all
peeled off and she was red and raw. She screeched like blue murder:
Maria heard her. They had to rush out and send for another doctor
from Oakworth. But it was too late. He couldn't save her.&mdash;An'
then just look at his pore wife. So pale an' woebegone! Shaking in
her shoes, I guess, what he'll be doing to her next."</p>

<p>"He ought to be had up for it. Instead of being let streel round
with his highty-tighty airs."</p>

<p>"No, gorblimey, you two!...of all the silly, clatterin' hens!"
and leaning forward Bill sliced his horse a sharp cut on the belly.
In the cloud of dust that rose as the buggy lurched forward, they
vanished from sight.</p>

<p>"Ha! didn't I know it? their butt&mdash;their laughing-stock,"
chafed Mahony in answer to the girl's guffaw; and his hands
trembled so that he could hardly pick up his scattered belongings.
In his agitation he forgot the rest he had intended to allow
himself, and plodded on anew, the sweat trickling in runnels down
his back, mouth and nostrils caked dry. Meanwhile venting his
choler by exclaiming aloud, in the brooding silence of the bush:
"What next?...what next, I wonder! Why, the likelihood is, they'll
boggle at my diagnoses...doubt my ability to dose 'em for the
d.t.'s or the colic." And this idea, being a new one, started a new
train of thought, his hungry brain pouncing avidly upon it.
Thereafter he tortured himself by tracking it down to its last and
direst issues; and thus engrossed was callous even to his passage
along the main street, for which, after what had just happened, he
felt a shrinking distaste, picturing eyes in every window, sneers
behind every door.</p>

<p>Safe again within the four walls of his room, he tossed hat and
bag from him and sank into the armchair, where he lay supine, his
taut muscles relaxed, his tired eyes closed to remembrance. And in
a very few minutes he was fast asleep: a deep, sound sleep, such as
night and darkness rarely brought him. Dinner-time came and went;
but he slept on; for Mrs. Beetling, still nursing her injuries, did
not as usual put her head in at the door to say that dinner was
ready; she just planked the dishes down on the dining-room table
and left them there. And soon the pair of chops, which dish she
served up to him day after day, lay hard and sodden in their own
fat.</p>

<p>Hunched in his chair, his head on his chest, his mouth open,
Mahony drew breaths that were more than half snores. His carefully
brushed hair had fallen into disarray, the lines on his forehead
deepened to grooves; on his slender hands, one of which hung
between his knees, the other over an arm of the chair, the veins
stood out blue and bold.</p>

<p>No sound broke the stillness but that of the clock striking the
hours and half-hours. Only very gradually did the sleeper come up
from those unfathomed depths, of which the waking brain keeps no
memory, to where, on the fringe of his consciousness, a disturbing
dream awaited him. It had to do with a buggy, a giant buggy, full
of people; and, inverting the real event of the day on which it was
modelled, he now longed with all his heart to be among them. For it
seemed to him that, if he could succeed in getting into this buggy,
he would hear somthing&mdash;some message or tidings&mdash;which it
was important for him to know. But though he tried and tried again,
he could not manage to swing himself up; either his foot missed the
step, or the people, who sat laughing and grimacing at him, pushed
him off. Finally he fell and lay in the dust, which, filling eyes,
nose, mouth, blinded and asphyxiated him. He was still on his back,
struggling for air, when he heard a voice buzzing in his ear:
"You're wanted! It's a patient come. Wake up, wake up!"&mdash;and
there was Mrs. Beetling leaning over him and shaking him by the
arm, while a man stood in the doorway and gaped.</p>

<p>He was out of his chair and on his feet in a twinkling; but he
could not as easily collect his wits, which were still dreambound.
His hands, too, felt numb, and as if they did not belong to him. It
took him the space of several breaths to grasp that his caller, a
farmer, was there to fetch him to attend his wife, and had a trap
waiting at the gate. He thought the man looked at him very queerly.
It was the fault of his old poor head, which was unequal to the
strain of so sudden a waking. Proffering an excuse, he left the
room to plunge it in water. As he did this it occurred to him that
he had had no dinner. But he was wholly without appetite; and one
glance at the fatty mess on the table was enough. Gulping down a
cup of tea, he ate a couple of biscuits, and then shouldering his
dustcoat, declared himself ready. It was a covered buggy: he leant
far back beneath the hood as they drove. This time, people should
<i>not</i> have the malicious pleasure of eyeing him.</p>

<p>I SEND YOU WHAT I CAN, MY DEAR, BUT I ADVISE YOU TO SPIN IT OUT
AND BE CAREFUL OF IT, MARY, FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHEN MORE
WILL BE FORTHCOMING. THINGS ARE VERY, VERY SLACK HERE. THERE IS NO
SICKNESS AND NO MONEY. I COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED A PRACTICE WOULD
COLLAPSE LIKE THIS, FROM OVER SEVENTY POUNDS A MONTH TO AS GOOD AS
NOTHING. IN THIS PAST WEEK I HAVE ONLY HAD FOUR PATIENTS...AND THEY
ALL POORISH PEOPLE. I FEEL TERRIBLY WORRIED, AND SIT HERE
CUDGELLING MY BRAINS WHAT IT WILL BE BEST TO DO. THE TRUTH IS THIS
PLACE IS FAST DYING OUT&mdash;EVERY ONE BEGINS TO SEE NOW THAT IT
HAS HAD ITS DAY AND WILL NEVER RECOVER. TWO OF THE TRADES-PEOPLE
HAVE BECOME INSOLVENT SINCE YOU LEFT, AND OTHERS TOTTER ON THE
BRINK.</p>

<p>THE HEAT IS UNBELIEVABLE. THE DROUGHT CONTINUES...NO SIGN YET OF
IT BREAKING, AND THE THERMOMETER ETERNALLY UP BETWEEN 90 AND 100.
(AND EVEN SO, NO SICKNESS.) I AM GETTING VERY ANXIOUS, TOO, ABOUT
THE WATER IN THE TANK, WHICH IS LOW AND DIRTY. IF RAIN DOES NOT
SOON COME, WE SHALL BE IN A PRETTY PLIGHT.</p>

<p>I SLEEP WRETCHEDLY; AND TIME HANGS VERY HEAVY. THE PEACHES ARE
RIPENING, GRAPES TWOPENCE A POUND; BUT BUTTER IS HARD TO GET, AND
UNLESS IT RAINS THERE WILL SOON BE NONE TO BE HAD.</p>

<p>I DO NOT SEE THAT WE CAN INCUR THE EXPENSE OF ANOTHER GOVERNESS.
THE CHILDREN WILL EITHER HAVE TO ATTEND THE STATE SCHOOL, OR YOU
MUST TEACH THEM YOURSELF.</p>

<p>I DO NOT LIKE YOUR LINED PAPER. I DETEST COMMON NOTEPAPER. GO TO
BRADLEY'S WHEN YOU ARE IN TOWN, AND ORDER SOME GOOD CREAM-LAID.
THEY HAVE THE DIE FOR THE CREST THERE.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear, he's at it again!" sighed Mary; and let the
letter fall to her knee.</p>

<p>"Whatever is it now?" asked Tilly.</p>

<p>In the shadow cast by the palings that separated a little
weatherboard house from the great golden-sanded beach, the two
women, in large, shady hats, sat and watched their children play.
Lucie, at her mother's side, was contentedly sorting a heap of
"grannies and cowries"; but Cuffy had deserted to the water's edge
directly he spied the servant-girl bringing out the letter. He
<i>hated</i> these letters from Papa; they always made Mamma
cross...or sorry...which spoilt the day. And it <i>was</i> so
lovely here! He wished the postman would never, never come.</p>

<p>"Oh, the usual Jeremiad," said Mary; and dropped her voice to
keep the child from hearing. "No sickness, weather awful, the water
getting low, people going bankrupt&mdash;a regular rigmarole of
grumbles and complaints."</p>

<p>"Determined to spoil your holiday for you, my dear, or so it
looks to me."</p>

<p>"I agree, it's a <i>dreadful</i> place; never should we have
gone there. But he would have it, and now he's got to make the best
of it. Why, the move cost us over a hundred. Besides, it would be
just the same anywhere else."</p>

<p>"Well, look here, Mary, my advice is&mdash;now Lucie, be a good
child and run away and play with your brother, instead of sitting
there drinking everything in. Feeling as you do about it my dear
you must just be firm and stick to your guns. You've given in to
'im your whole life long, and a fat lot of thanks you've ever 'ad
for it. It's made me <i>boil</i> to see you so meek...though one
never dared say much, you always standing up for him, loyal as
loyal could be. But time's getting on, Mary; you aren't as young as
you were; and you've got others now to think of besides 'im. I just
shouldn't stand any more of 'is nonsense."</p>

<p>"Yes, I daresay it <i>was</i> bad for him, always having his own
way. But now he's got to learn that the children come first. They
have all their lives before them, and I won't sit by and see him
beggar them. He says we can't afford another governess; that they
must either go to the State School&mdash;my children,
Tilly!&mdash;or I teach them myself. When my hands are so full
already that I could do with a day twice as long. And then he's so
unreasonable. Finds fault with my notepaper, and says I am to go to
Bradley's and order some expensive cream-laid. Now I ask you!"</p>

<p>"Unreasonable?" flamed Tilly, and blew a gust from mouth and
nose. "There's some people, Mary, 'ud call it by another name, my
dear!"</p>

<p>Mary sighed anew, and nodded. "I'm convinced from past
experience that this idea of the practice failing is just his own
imagination. He's lonely, and hasn't any one to talk to, and so he
sits and broods. But it keeps me on the fidget; for it's almost
always been something imaginary that's turned him against a place
and made him want to leave it. And if he once gets an idea in his
head, I might as well talk to the wind. Indeed, what I say only
makes matters worse. Perhaps some one else might manage him better.
Really I can't help wondering sometimes, Tilly, if I've been the
right wife for him, after all. No one could have been fonder of
him. But there's always something in him that I can't get at; and
when things go badly, and we argue and argue...why, then the
thought will keep cropping up that perhaps some one else...somebody
cleverer than I am...Do you remember Gracey Marriner, who he was so
friendly with over that table-rapping business? She was so quick at
seeing what he meant...and why he did things...and they found so
much to talk about, and they read the same books and played the
piano together. Well, I've sometimes felt that perhaps she..." But
here the tears that had gathered in Mary's eyes threatened to run
over, and she had to grope for her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"<i>Her!</i> Lor, Mary!...he'd have tired of 'er and her
la-di-da airs inside three months," ejaculated Tilly, and fiercely
blew her own nose in sympathy. "If ever there's been a good wife,
my dear, it's you. But a fig for all the soft sawder that's talked
about marriage! The long and the short of it is, marriage is sent
to <i>try</i> us women, and for nothin' on earth besides."</p>

<p>The children reacted in distinctive fashion to the sight of
their mother crying. Little Lucie, who had heard, if not grasped,
all that passed, hung her head like a dog scolded for some fault it
does not understand. Cuffy, casting furtive backward glances,
angrily stamped his feet so that the water splashed high over his
rolled-up knickerbockers. This not availing, he turned and
deliberately waded out to sea.</p>

<p>Ah! then Mamma <i>had</i> to stop crying and to notice him.
"Cuffy! Come back!"</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> a naughty boy!" sermonised Aunt Tilly. "When his
poor mother is so worried, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, my great fear is, Richard's heading for another move.
Really, after a letter like this I feel I ought just to pack up and
go home."</p>

<p>"What? After you come down 'ere looking like a ghost, and as
thin as thin?...I won't <i>hear</i> of it, Mary."</p>

<p>"You see, last time he took me completely by surprise. I'm
resolved <i>that</i> shan't happen again."</p>

<p>"Hush! hark!...was that Baby?" And Tilly bent an ardent ear
towards the verandah, where her infant lay sleeping in a
hammock.</p>

<p>"I heard nothing.&mdash;There's another reason, too, why I want
to stay there, wretched place though it is. It's the...I don't feel
I <i>can</i> go off and leave the...the little grave, with nobody
to care for it. It's all I've got left of her."</p>

<p>"The blessed little angel!"</p>

<p>"Later on...it may be different. But to go away now would tear
me in two. Though it may and probably will mean row after row."</p>

<p>"Yes, till he wears you down. That's always been 'is
way.&mdash;Ah! but that <i>is</i> Baby sure enough." And climbing
to her feet, Tilly propelled her matronly form up the sandy
path.</p>

<p>She returned in triumph bearing the child, which but half awake
whined peevishly, ramming two puny fists into sleep-charged eyes;
on her face the gloating, doting expression with which she was wont
to follow its every movement. For her love, waxing fat on care and
anxiety, had swelled to a consuming passion, the like of which had
never before touched her easy-going life.</p>

<p>Mary rose and shook the sand from her skirts. "I must see what I
can find to say to him, to cheer him up and keep him quiet."</p>

<p>"And our good little Lucie here, and Cuffy, too, shall mind
darling Baby for Auntie, whilst she makes his pap."</p>

<p>But the children hung back. Minding Baby meant one long fight to
hinder him from putting things&mdash;everything: sand, shells, your
hand, your spade&mdash;in his mouth, and kicking and screaming if
you said no; and Aunt Tilly rushing out crying: "What are they
<i>doing</i> to my precious?"&mdash;Lucie had already a firm
handful of her mother's dress in her grasp.</p>

<p>"Now, Mary! you can't possibly write with that child hanging
round you."</p>

<p>"Oh, she won't bother...she never does," said Mary, who could
not find it in her heart to drive her ewe-lamb from her.</p>

<p>"Oh, well then!" said Tilly, with a loveless glance at the
retreating Cuffy. "Muvver's jewel must just tum <i>wif</i> 'er, and
see its doody-doody dinner cooked."&mdash;And smothering the little
sallow face, the overlarge head in kisses, she, too, sought the
house.</p>

<p>("Really Tilly is <i>rather</i> absurd about that baby!")</p>

<p>("How Mary <i>does</i> spoil those children!")</p>

<p>With which private criticism, each of the other, Tilly fell to
stirring a hasty-pudding, and Mary sat her down before pen and
paper. And thus ended what, little as they knew it, was to be the
last of their many confidential talks on the subject of Richard,
his frowardness and crabbedness, his innate inability to fit
himself to life. From now on, Mary's lips were in loyalty
sealed.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-2-3" id="ch-3-2-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>Under the heat-veiled January skies Mahony saw his worst fears
realised. His few remaining patients dropped off, no others
appeared to take their place; and, with this, the practice in
Barambogie virtually came to an end.</p>

<p>There he sat, with his head between his hands, cudgelling his
brains. For it staggered credulity that every form of sickness,
that the break-neck casualties inseparable from bush life, should
one and all fade out in so preposterous a fashion. In the unhealthy
season, too, compared with the winter months in which he had
settled there. What were the people up to? What cabal had they
formed against him? That some shady trick was being played him, he
did not for a moment doubt. Suspiciously he eyed Mrs. Beetling when
she came to her job of a morning. <i>She</i> knew what was going
on, or he was much mistaken: she looked very queerly at him, and
often gave him the impression of scuttling hurriedly away. But he
had never been any hand at pumping people of her class: it took
Mary to do that. And so he contented himself, did he chance upon
the woman, with fixing her in silence; and otherwise treating her
with the contempt she deserved. He had more important things to
occupy him. These first days of blank, unbroken idleness were spent
in fuming about the house like a caged animal: up the passage, out
on the verandah, round this and back to the passage. Again and
again he believed he heard the front gate click, and ran to seat
himself in the surgery. But it was always a false alarm. And after
a few seconds' prickling suspense, in which every nerve in his body
wore ears, he would bound up from his seat, hardly master of
himself for exasperation. These infamous people! Why, oh why had he
ever set foot among them?...ever trodden the dust of this accursed
place! A man of his skill, his experience, wilfully to put himself
at the mercy of a pack of bush-dwellers...Chinese
coolies...wretched half-castes!&mdash;And, striding ever more
gauntly and intolerantly, he drove his thoughts back and salved his
bleeding pride with memories of the past. He saw himself in his
heyday, on Ballarat, famed alike for his diagnoses and sureness of
hand; saw himself called in to perform the most delicate
operations; robbed of his sleep by night, on the go the livelong
day, until at last, incapable of meeting the claims made on him,
there had been nothing left for him to do but to fly the place. And
spurred by the exhilaration of these memories, he quickened his
steps till the sweat poured off him.</p>

<p>But he was not to be done. He'd shew these numskulls whom they
had to deal with...make them bite the dust. Ha! he had it: that
case of empyema and subsequent operation for <i>paracentesis
thoracis</i>, which he had before now contemplated writing up for
the <i>Australian Medical Journal</i>. Now was the time: he would
set to work straightway, dash the article off, post it before the
sun went down that night. It would appear in the March issue of the
journal; and these fools would then learn, to their eternal
confusion, that they had among them one whose opinions were of
weight in the selectest medical circles. With unsteady hands he
turned out a drawer containing old notes and papers, and having
found what he wanted, spread them on the table before him. But,
with his pen inked and poised ready to begin, he hesitated. In
searching, he had recalled another, rarer case: one of a hydatid
cyst in the subcutaneous tissue of the thigh. This would be more
telling; and going on his knees before a wooden chest, in which he
stored old memoranda, he rummaged anew. Again, however, after a
lengthy hunt, he found himself wavering. His notes were not as full
as he had believed: there would be finicking details to verify,
books to consult which he could no longer get at. So this scheme,
too, had to be let drop. Ah! but now he had really hit it. What
about that old bone of contention among the medical profession,
homoeopathy? Once on a time he had meant to bring out a pamphlet on
the subject, and, if he remembered rightly, had made voluminous
notes for it. Could he find these, he would be spared all
brain-fag. And again he made his knees sore and his head dizzy over
a mass of dusty, yellowing papers. After which, re-seating himself
with an air of triumph, he ruled a line in red ink on a sheet of
foolscap, and wrote above it, in his fine, flowing hand: Why I do
not practise Homoeopathy.</p>

<p><i>If, as is so often asserted, the system of homoeopathy as
practised by Hahnemann and his followers...</i>
</p>

<p>But having got thus far he came to a standstill, re-dipped a pen
that was already loaded, bit the end of it, wrinkled his brows.
What next?...what did he want to say?...how to end the sentence?
And when he did manage to catch a glimpse of his thought, he could
not find words in which to clothe it...the right words. They would
not come at his beck; or phrases either. He floundered, tried one,
then another; nothing suited him; and he grew more and more
impatient: apparently, even with his notes before him, it was going
to be beyond him to make a decent job of the thing. He had been
silent too long. Nor could he, he now found, work up the heat, the
orthodox heat with which he had once burnt: the points he had
formerly made against this quack and his system now seemed flat or
exaggerated. So indifferent had he grown with the years that his
present attitude of mind was almost one of: let those who choose
adopt Hahnemann's methods, those who will, be allopaths. And, as he
sat there struggling to bring his thoughts to heel, to re-kindle
the old fire, the tardy impulse to express himself died out. He
threw his pen from him. <i>cui bono</i>? Fool, fool! to think of
blistering his brains for the benefit of these savages among whom
his present lot was cast. What would they understand of it, many of
whom were forced to set crosses where their names should have
stood? And when he was so tired, too, so dog-tired physically, with
his feverish runnings to and fro, and exhausted mentally with
fretting and fuming. Much too tired (and too rusty) to embark on a
piece of work that demanded utmost care and discrimination...let
alone cope with the labour of writing it down. Suddenly, quite
suddenly, the idea of exertion, of any effort whatever, was become
odious to him...odious and unthinkable. He put his arms on the
table and hid his face in them; and, lying there, knew that his
chief desire was fulfilled: to sit with his eyes screened, darkness
round him, and to think and feel just as little as he saw. But, a
bundle of papers incommoding him, he raised his hand, and with a
last flash of the old heat crumpled notes and jottings to balls and
tossed them to the floor. There they lay till, next morning, Mrs.
Beetling swept them up and threw them on the kitchen fire.</p>

<p>And now silence fell anew&mdash;a silence the more marked for
the stormy trampling that had preceded it. Said Mrs. Beetling to
her crony, the ostler's wife: "I do declare, 'e's that mousy quiet,
you never c'd tell there was a livin' creatur' in the
'ouse&mdash;not no more'n a triantelope nor a centipede!" No longer
had she to spend time dodging her master: shrinking behind open
doors to avoid crossing his path, waiting her opportunity to reach
bedroom or dining-room unobserved. He never left the surgery; and
she could work with a good grace, scrubbing floors that were not
trodden on, cooking food the lion's share of which it fell to her
to eat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a burning February ran its course. To step off the
verandah now was like stepping into a furnace. The sky was white
with heat: across its vast pale expanse moved a small,
copper-coloured sun. Or the hot winds streaked it with livid trails
of wind-smitten cloud. The very air was white with dust. While, did
a windstorm rise, the dust-clouds were so dense that
everything&mdash;trees, Lagoon, township, the very garden
itself&mdash;was blotted out. Dust carpeted the boards of the
verandah, drove into the passage, invaded the rooms. But never a
drop of rain fell. And then the fires started: in all the country
round, the bush was ablaze: the sky hung dark as with an overhead
fog; the rank tang of burning wood smarted the lungs.</p>

<p>In the little oven of a house the green blinds were lowered from
early morning on. Behind them, in a bemusing twilight, behind the
high paling-fence that defended house from road, Mahony sat
isolate&mdash;sat shunned and forgotten. And as day added itself to
day the very sound of his own voice grew strange to him, there
being no need for him ever to unclose his lips. Even his old trick
of muttering died out&mdash;went the way of his pacing and
haranguing. For something in him had yielded, had broken, carrying
with it, in its fall, the black pride, the bitter resentment, the
aggressive attitude of mind which had hitherto sustained him. And
this wholesale collapse of what he had believed to be his ruling
traits made him feel oddly humble...and humiliated...almost as if
he had shrivelled in stature. Hence he never went out. For the
single road led through the street of malicious eyes: and now
nothing would have prevailed on him to expose himself to their
fire. More and more the four walls of his room began to seem to him
haven and refuge. And gradually he grew as fearful of the sound of
footsteps approaching the door as he had formerly been eager for
them. For they might mean a summons to quit his lair.</p>

<p>But no steps came.</p>

<p>Had he had but a dog to lay its moist and kindly muzzle on his
knee, or a cat to arch its back under his hand, the keenest edge
might have been taken off his loneliness. But for more years than
he could count, he had been obliged to deny himself the company of
those dumb friends who might now have sought, in semi-human
fashion, to relieve the inhuman silence that had settled round him.
Nothing broke this&mdash;or only what was worse than the silence
itself: the awful mill-whistle, which, five times a day, marked the
passage of the empty hours with its nerve-shattering shriek. He
learnt to hate this noise as if it had been a live and malignant
thing; yet was constrained to wait for it, to listen to
it&mdash;even to count the seconds that still divided him from its
blast. His books lay unopened, withdrawn into their primary state
of so much dead paper. And it was not books alone that lost their
meaning and grew to seem useless, and a burden. He could forget to
wind up his watch, to pare his nails; he ceased to care whether or
no his socks were worn into holes. The one task to which he still
whipped himself was the writing of the few lines necessary to keep
Mary from fretting. (To prepare her, too. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
DOING...INCREDIBLE...HEARTBREAKING.) Otherwise he would sit, for an
hour at a time, staring at some object on the table before him,
till it, the table, the room itself, swam in a grey mist. Or he
followed, with all the fixity of inattention, the movements of a
fly...or the dance of dust motes laddering a beam.</p>

<p>But this inertia, this seemingly aimless drifting, was yet not
wholly irrational. It formed a kind of attempt, a threefold
attempt, on the part of his inmost self, to recover from...to nerve
himself anew for...to avoid rousing a whit sooner than need
be...the black terrors that stalked those hours when he had not
even the light of day to distract him.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>To wake in the night, and to know that, on this side of your
waking, lies no ray of light or hope...only darkness and fear. To
wake in the night: be wide awake in an instant with all your
faculties on edge: to wake, and be under compulsion to set in,
night for night, at the same point, knowing, from grim experience,
that the demons awaiting you have each to be grappled with in turn,
no single one of them left unthrown, before you can win through to
the peace that is utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>Sometimes he managed to get a couple of hours' rest beforehand.
At others, he would start up from a profound sleep believing the
night far advanced; only to find that a bare ten or fifteen minutes
had elapsed since he closed his eyes. But, however long or short
the period of oblivion, what followed was always the same; and
after a very few nights he learnt wisdom, and gave up struggling to
escape the unescapable. Rising on his pillow he drew a long breath,
clenched his fists, and thrust off.</p>

<p>The order in which his thoughts swept at him was always the
same. The future...what of the future? With the practice gone, with
nothing saved on which to start afresh, with but the slenderest of
sums in hand for living expenses and the everlasting drain of the
mortgage, he could see no way out of his present impasse but
through the bankruptcy court. And in this country even an unmerited
insolvency, one brought about by genuine misfortunes, spelt
disgrace, spelt ruin. And not for oneself alone. To what was he
condemning Mary...and the children?...his tenderly reared children.
Poverty...charity...the rough and ready scramble of colonial life.
Oh, a man should indeed take thought and consider, before he gave
such hostages to fortune!&mdash;And here, as he tossed restlessly
from side to side, there came into his mind words he had read
somewhere or heard some one say, about life and its ultimate
meaning. Stripped of its claptrap, of the roses and false sentiment
in which we loved to drape it, it had actually no object but this:
to keep a roof over the heads and food in the mouths of the
helpless beings who depend on us.&mdash;Burns, too...Bobbie
Burns.&mdash;Oh, God!...there it was again. This accursed
diminutive! Night for night he vowed he would not use it, and night
for night his tongue slipped and it was out before he could help
himself. Had he then no longer the power to decide what he would or
would not say? Preposterous!...preposterous and infuriating! For
the whole thing&mdash;both the slip and his exasperation&mdash;was
but a ruse on the part of his mind, to switch him off the main
issue. And to know this, and yet be constrained, night after night,
to the mechanical repetition of so utter a futility...his cold rage
was such that several minutes had invariably to pass before he was
calm enough to go on.</p>

<p>A way out!...there <i>must</i> be a way out. Hoisting himself on
the pillow, till he all but sat erect, and boring into the dark
with eyes hot in their sockets, he fell feverishly to telling over
his affairs; though by now this, too, had become a sheerly
automatic proceeding: his lips singsonging figures and sets of
figures, while his brain roved elsewhere. What he could <i>not</i>
avoid was the recital of them: it formed another of the obstacles
he was compelled nightly to clamber over, on the road to sleep.
Bills and bad debts, shares and dividends and calls, payments on
the mortgage, redemption of the capital: these things danced a
witches' sabbath in his head. To them must now be added the rent of
the house they lived in. He had reckoned on covering this with the
rental from the house at Hawthorn. But they had had no luck with
tenants: were already at their second; and the house was said to be
falling into bad repair. In the Bank in Barambogie there stood to
his credit, stood between him and beggary, the sum of not quite one
hundred pounds. When this was done, God help them!</p>

<p><i>Why</i> had he ever left Melbourne What evil spirit had
entered into him and driven him forth? What <i>was</i> that in him
over which he had no power, which proved incapable of adhesion to
any soil or fixed abode? For he might arm himself, each time anew,
with another motive for plucking up his roots: it remained mere
ratiocination, a sop flung to his reason, and in no wise got at the
heart of the matter. Wherein lay the fault, the defect that had
made of him throughout his life a hunted man?...harried from place
to place, from country to country. Other men set up a goal,
achieved it, and remained content. He had always been in
flight.&mdash;But from what? Who were his pursuers? From what
shadows did he run?&mdash;And in these endless nights, when he lay
and searched his heart as never before, he thought he read the
answer to the riddle. Himself he was the hunter and the hunted: the
merciless in pursuit and the panting prey. Within him, it would
seem, lodged fears...strange fears. And at a given moment one of
these, hitherto dormant and unsuspected, would suddenly begin to
brew, and go on growing till he was all one senseless panic, blind
flight the only catholicon. No matter what form it
took&mdash;whether a morbid anxiety about his health, or alarm at
the swiftness with which his little day was passing&mdash;its aim
was always the same: to beat him up and on. And never yet had he
succeeded in defying it. With the result that, well on in years and
loaded with responsibilities, he stood face to face with ruin.
Having dragged with him those who were dearer to him than his own
life.&mdash;But stay! Was that true?...and not just one of those
sleek phrases that dripped so smoothly off the tongue. <i>Were</i>
they dearer? In this moment of greater clarity he could no longer
affirm it. He believed that the instinct of self-preservation had,
in his case, always been the primary one. And digging deeper still,
he got, he thought, a further insight into his motives. If this
were so, then what he fled must needs be the reverse of the
security he ran to seek: in other words, annihilation. The plain
truth was: the life-instinct had been too strong for him. Rather
than face death and the death-fear, in an attempt to flee the
unfleeable he had thrown every other consideration to the winds,
and ridden tantivy into the unknown.</p>

<p>But now all chance of flight was over. He sat here as fast a
prisoner as though chained to a stake&mdash;an old and weary man,
with his fiftieth birthday behind him.&mdash;<i>old</i>, did he
say? By God! not as a man's years were reckoned elsewhere. In this
accursed country alone. Only here were those who touched middle age
regarded as decrepit, and cumberers of the soil. Wisdom and
experience availed a man nothing, where only brawn had value. As
for the three-score years and ten&mdash;But no!...no use, no
use!...words would not help him. Not thus could it be shirked. He
had to fight through, to the last spasm, the paroxysm of terror
which at this point shook him like a palsy, at the knowledge that
he would never again get free; that he was caught, trapped, pinned
down...to be torn asunder, devoured alive. His pulses raced, his
breath came hard, the sweat that streamed off him ran cold. Night
after night he had the same thing to undergo; and from bitter
experience he knew that the fit would gradually exhaust itself,
leaving him spent, inert.&mdash;But this was all. With this, his
compliance ceased, and there came a block. For, below the surface
here, under a lid which he never lifted, which nothing would have
induced him to raise by a hair's-breadth, lurked a darker fear than
any, one he could not face and live; even though, with a part of
his mind, a watchful part, a part that it was impossible to
deceive, he <i>knew</i> what it was.</p>

<p>Swerving violently, he laid the onus of his terror on a side
issue: the confession that stood before him, the confession to Mary
of his ruinous debt. As he pictured this, and as the borrowed
emotion swelled it out, it turned to something
horrible...monstrous...the performance of which surpassed his
strength. How could he ever break the news to her, all
unsuspecting, who shrank from debt as other women from fire or
flood? What would she say?...hurl what bitter words at him, in her
first wrath and distress? She being what she was, he believed the
knowledge would well-nigh break her heart...as it almost broke his,
to think of the anguish he must inflict on her.&mdash;And once
again the years fell away, and he was a little velvet-suited lad,
paling and quivering under the lash of a caustic Irish tongue. But
there also came times when some such vividly recalled emotion
proved the way out. Then, one or other episode from the
forty-year-old past would rise before him, with so amazing a
reality that he re-lived it to its flimsiest details, hearing the
ominous tick of the clock on the chimney-piece, smelling the scent
of lavender that went out from his mother's garments. At others,
the past failing in its grip, there was nothing for it but to fight
to a finish. And so he would lie, and writhe, and moan, and beat
the pillow with his hands, while tears that felt thick as blood
scalded his cheeks.</p>

<p>But gradually, very gradually this last convulsion spent itself:
and, as at the approach of soft music from a distance, he was aware
of the coming end...of the peace advancing, at which all the labour
of the night had been directed. Peace at last!...for his raw
nerves, his lacerated brain. And along with it a delicious
drowsiness, which stole over him from his finger-tips, and up from
his feet, relaxing knotted muscles, loosening his hands, which now
lay limp and free. He sank into it, letting himself go...as into a
pond full of feathers...which enveloped him, closed downily about
him...he sinking deeper...ever deeper...Until, angry and menacing,
shattering the heavenly inertia, a scream.&mdash;Who screamed? A
child? What was it? Who was hurt?&mdash;Oh God! the shock of it,
the ice-cold shock! He fell back on the pillow, his heart thudding
like a tom-tom. Would he <i>never</i> grow used to it?...this awful
waking!...and though he endured it day after day. For...as
always...the sun was up, the hour six of a red-hot morning, and the
mill-whistle flayed the silence. In all he had slept for not quite
three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>Thereafter he lay and stared into the dusty light as he had
stared into the darkness. Needle-like pulses beat behind his lids;
the muscles round eyes and mouth were a-twitch with fatigue. From
the sight of food he turned with a sick man's disrelish. Swallowing
a cup of milkless tea, he crossed to the surgery and shut himself
in. But on this particular day his habit of drowsing through the
empty hours was rudely broken through. Towards midday he was
disturbed by the door opening. It was Mrs. Beetling who, without so
much as a knock, put her head in to say that the stationmaster had
hurt his foot and wanted doctor to come and bandage it.</p>

<p>The stationmaster?&mdash;He had been far away, on high cliffs
that sloped to the sea, gathering "horsetails"...and for still an
instant his brain loitered over the Latin equivalent. Then he was
on his feet, instinctively fingering the place where his collar
should have been. But neither coat nor collar...and: "My boots, my
good woman, my boots!" The dickens! Was that he who was shouting?
Tut, tut! He must pull himself together, not let these spying eyes
note his fluster. But there was another reason for the
deliberateness with which he sought the bedroom. His knees felt
weak, and he could hardly see for the tears that would keep
gathering. Over three weeks now close on a month&mdash;since any
one had sent for him. <i>All</i> were not dead against him then!
Oh, a good fellow, this Pendrell!...a good fellow!...a man after
his own heart, and a gentleman.&mdash;And throwing open drawers and
cupboards, he made many an unnecessary movement, and movements that
went wide of their mark.</p>

<p>In putting arnica and lint in his bag he became aware that his
hands were violently a-shake. This wouldn't do. Impossible to
appear before a patient in such a state. He clenched his fists and
stiffened his arms; but the tremor was stronger than his will, and
persisted. As a last resource he turned to the sideboard, poured
some sherry into a tumbler, and gulped it down.</p>

<p>Quitting the house by the back door, he went past the kitchen,
the woodstack, the rubbish-heap, a pile of emptied kerosene-tins,
the pigsties (with never a pig in them), the fowls sitting moping
in the shrinking shade. His eyes ran water anew at the brassy
glare; and phew!...the heat. In his haste he had forgotten to put a
handful of vine-leaves in the crown of his wideawake. The sun bore
down on him with an almost physical weight: he might have had a
loaded sack lying across neck and shoulders. And as soon as he let
the hasp of the gate fall, he was in the dust of the road; and then
his feet were weighted as well.</p>

<p>But his thoughts galloped. Oh, that this summons might be the
start of a new era for him!...the awful stagnation of the past
month prove to have been but a temporary lull, a black patch, such
as any practice was liable to; the plot he had believed hatched
against him prove to have existed only in his own imagination; and
everything be as before...he still able to make a living, pay his
way.&mdash;"Mercy!...dear God, a little mercy!"&mdash;But if that
were so, then he, too, would need to do his share. Yes, he would
make a point from now on of meeting the people here on their own
level. He would ask after their doings...their wives and
children...gossip with them of the weather and the
vines...hobnob&mdash;no, drink with them he could and would not!
But he knew another way of getting at them. And that was through
their pockets. Fees! Quite likely he had set his too high. He would
now come down a peg...halve his charges. They'd see then that it
was to their advantage to call him in, rather than send elsewhere
for a stranger. It might also be policy on his part&mdash;in the
meantime at any rate&mdash;to treat trivial injuries and ailments
free of charge. (Once the practice was set going again, he'd make
them pay through the nose for all the worry and trouble they'd
caused him.) If <i>only</i> he could get the name of being
freehanded...easygoing&mdash;could ingratiate himself...become
popular.</p>

<p>So rapt was he that though, at the level crossing, his feet
paused of themselves, he could not immediately think why he had
stopped, and gazed absently round. Ha! the trains, of course. But
there <i>were</i> no trains at this hour of day: the station was
shut up, deserted. A pretty fool he would look was he seen standing
there talking to himself. He must hurry in, too, out of the sun.
The heat was beginning to induce giddiness; the crown of his head
felt curiously contracted. But he had still some distance to go. He
spurred himself on, more quickly than before; his feet keeping time
with his wingy thoughts.</p>

<p>Mary was hard put to it not to alarm the children. Every few
minutes her anxiety got the better of her, and dropping her work
she would post herself at a corner of the verandah, where she could
see down the road. She had been on the watch ever since the postman
handed in Richard's letter that morning, for the telegram that was
to follow. Her first impulse had been to start for home without
delay; and, despite Tilly's reasonings and persuasions, she had
begun to sort out the children's clothes. Then she wavered. It
would be madness to go back before the heat broke. And, if the
practice was as dead as Richard averred, there was no saying when
the poor mites would get another change of air.</p>

<p>Still...Richard needed her. His letter ran: I AM AFRAID WHAT I
HAVE TO TELL YOU WILL BE A GREAT SHOCK TO YOU. I WAS UP AT THE
STATIONMASTER'S JUST NOW AND FOUND MYSELF UNABLE TO ARTICULATE. I
COULD NOT SAY WHAT I WANTED. I LAY DOWN, AND THEY BROUGHT ME WATER.
I SAID I THOUGHT IT WAS A FAINT&mdash;THAT I HAD BEEN OUT TOO LONG
IN THE SUN. I FEAR IT IS SOMETHING WORSE. I AM VERY, VERY UNEASY
ABOUT MYSELF. I HAVE BEEN SO DISTRESSED ABOUT THE PRACTICE. I THINK
THAT MUST HAVE UPSET ME. INTENSE MENTAL DEPRESSION...AND THIS AWFUL
HEAT&mdash;WHAT WITH SOLITUDE AND MISFORTUNES I HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY
PUT ABOUT. ALL THE SAME I SHOULD NOT WORRY YOU, IF IT WERE NOT FOR
MY DREAD OF BEING TAKEN ILL ALONE. I AM MOST UNWILLING TO BRING YOU
AND THE CHILDREN BACK IN THE MEANTIME. THE HEAT BAFFLES
DESCRIPTION. I SHOULD NEVER SPEND ANOTHER FEBRUARY HERE&mdash;IT
WOULD BE AS MUCH AS MY LIFE IS WORTH. PERHAPS THE BEST THING TO DO
WILL BE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW I AM. I WILL TELEGRAPH YOU ON MONDAY
MORNING EARLY. TAKE NO STEPS TILL YOU HEAR.</p>

<p>But to this a postscript had been added, in a hand it was hard
to recognise as Richard's: OH MARY WIFE COME HOME, COME
HOME!&mdash;BEFORE I GO QUITE MAD.</p>

<p>Down by the water's edge Cuffy played angrily. He didn't know
what he loved best: the seaweed, or the shells, or the little cave,
or the big pool on the reef, or the little pool, or bathing and
lying on the sand, or the smell of the ti-trees. And now&mdash;oh,
<i>why</i> had Papa got to go and get ill, and spoil everything?
<i>He'd</i> seen Mamma beginning to pack their things, and it had
made him feel all hot inside. Why must just <i>his</i> clothes be
packed? He might get ill, too. Perhaps he would, if he drank some
sea. Aunt Tilly said it made you mad. (Like Shooh man.) All right
then, he would get mad...and they could see how they liked it! And
so saying he scooped up a palmful of water and put it to his mouth.
It ran away so fast that there was hardly any left; but it was
enough: ugh! wasn't it nasty? He spat it out again, making a
'normous noise so that everybody should hear. But they didn't take
a bit of notice. Then a better idea struck him. He'd give Mamma the
very nicest things he had: the two great big shells he had found
all by himself, which he kept hidden in a cave so that Luce
shouldn't even touch them unless he said so. He'd give them to
Mamma, and she'd like them so much that she'd never want to go
home&mdash;oh well! not for a long, long time. Off he raced,
shuffling his bare feet through the hot, dry, shifty sand.</p>

<p>But it was no good: she didn't care. Though he made her shut her
eyes tight and promise not to look, while he opened her hand and
squeezed the shells into it and shut it again, like you did with
big surprises. She just said: "What's this? Your pretty shells? My
dear, what should I do with them? No, no!...you keep them for
yourself,"&mdash;and all the while she wasn't <i>really</i>
thinking what she said. And he couldn't even tell her why, for now
Aunt Tilly shouted that the telegram-boy was coming at last; and
Mamma just pushed the shells back and ran out into the road, and
tore open the telegram like anything, and smiled and waved it at
Aunt Tilly, and they both laughed and talked and wiped their eyes.
But then everything was all right again; for it was from Papa, and
he had telegrammed: AM BETTER, DO NOT HURRY HOME.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-2-4" id="ch-3-2-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>In spite, however, of this reassurance Mary could not rest. And
one fine morning not long after, the trunks were brought out again,
and she and Tilly fell to packing in earnest.</p>

<p>Cuffy's resentment at being torn from the sea a whole fortnight
too soon did not stand before the excitements of a journey: first
in a coach and then in a train. Besides, Mamma had given him a
little box to himself, to pack his shells in. Importantly he
carried this, while she and Aunt Tilly ran about counting the other
luggage. There was so much &mdash;portmanteaux and bundles, and
baskets and bonnet-boxes, and beds and mattresses, and buckets and
spades and the perambulator&mdash;that they were afraid there
wouldn't be room for it in the coach. But there was: they had it
all to themselves. And di<i>RECK</i>ly the door was shut the
lunch-basket was opened; for one of the most 'squisite things about
a journey was that you could eat as much as you liked and whenever
you liked. Mamma was so nice, too, and didn't scold when you and
Luce rushed to look first out of one window and then the other. But
Aunt Tilly said you trod on her feet and knocked against Baby, and
you were a perfect nuisance; in all her born days she'd never known
such fidgets. But Mamma said it was only high spirits, and you
couldn't be always carping at children, wait till Baby got big and
she'd see! And Aunt Tilly said she'd take care he wasn't brought up
to be a nuisance to his elders. Cuffy was afraid they were going to
get cross, so he sat down again, and only waggled his legs. He
didn't like Aunt Tilly much. He didn't like fat people. Besides,
when Baby squawked she thought it was lovely, and gave him
everything he wanted to put in his mouth. They were in the train
now, and <i>wouldn't</i> it be fun to pinch his leg! But he
couldn't, 'cos he wasn't sitting next him. But he stuck his boot
out and pressed it as hard as ever he could against Baby's foot,
and Aunt Tilly didn't see but Baby did, and opened his eyes and
looked at him...just horrid!</p>

<p>Then came Melbourne and a fat old lady in a carriage and two
horses, who called Mamma my dearie. She lived in a very big house
with a nice old gentleman with a white beard, who took his hand and
walked him round "to see the grounds" (just as if he was grown up).
He was a very funny man, and said he owed (only he said it
"h'owed") everything to Papa, which made Cuffy wonder why, if so,
he didn't pay him back. For Papa was always saying he hadn't enough
money. But Mamma had told them they must be specially good here,
and not pass remarks about <i>anything</i>. So he didn't. One night
they went to a Pantomime called <i>Goody Two-shoes</i>&mdash;not
Mamma, she was still too sorry about Lallie being dead &mdash;and
once to hear music and singing in a theatre. The old Sir and Lady
took them both times, and at the music Luce was a donkey and went
to sleep, and had to be laid down on a coat on the floor. He
didn't! He sat on a chair in the front of a little room like a
balcony, and listened and listened to a gipsy singing in a voice
that went up and up, and made you feel first hot and then cold all
over. Afterwards people made a great noise clapping their hands,
and he did it, too, and made more noise than anybody. And the gipsy
came by herself and bowed her head to every one, and then she
looked at him, and smiled and blew him a kiss. He didn't much care
for that, because it made people laugh; and he didn't know her.
They all laughed again when they got home, till he went red and
felt more like crying. He didn't, though; he was too big to cry
now; everybody said so. The funny thing was, lots of big people did
cry here; there seemed always to be some one crying. Aunt Zara came
to see them all dressed in black, with black cloths hanging from
her bonnet and a prickly dress that scratched&mdash;like Papa's
chin when he hadn't shaved. This was because she was a widder. She
had a black streak on her handkerchief, too, to cry on, and felt
most awfly sorry about writing to Mamma on paper that hadn't a
"morning border," but what with one thing and another...Cuffy hoped
Mamma wouldn't mind, and asked what a morning border was, but was
only told to run away and play. He didn't. He stopped at the window
and pretended to catch flies, he wanted so much to hear. Aunt Zara
said she lit'rally didn't know where to turn, and Mamma looked
sorry but said if you made beds you must lie on them. (That
<i>was</i> rummy!) And Aunt Zara said she thought she had been
punished enough. Mamma said as long as she had a roof over her head
she wouldn't see any one belonging to her come to want, and there
<i>were</i> the children, of course, and she was at her wits' end
what to do about them, but of course she'd have to consult Richard
first, and Aunt Zara knew what he was, and Aunt Zara said, only too
well, but there was nothing she wouldn't do, she'd even scrub
floors and wash dishes.</p>

<p>"Maria always scrubs our floors!"</p>

<p>It just jumped out of him; he did so want her to know she
wouldn't have to. But then she said the thing about little pitchers
and Mamma got cross as well, and told him to go out of the room at
<i>once</i>, so he didn't hear any more.</p>

<p>Then Cousin Emmy came, and she cried too&mdash;like anything. He
felt much sorrier for her than Aunt Zara. He had to sniffle
himself. She was so nice and pretty, but when she cried her face
got red and fat, and Mamma said if she went on like this she'd soon
lose her good looks. But she said who'd she got to be good-looking
for, only a pack of kids, which made him feel rather uncomfortable
and he thought she needn't have said that. But it was very
int'resting. She told about somebody who spent all her time
dressing in "averdipoy," and was possessed by a devil (like the
pigs in the Bible). He longed to ask what she meant, but this time
was careful and didn't let anything hop out of him, for he was
going to hear just <i>everything</i>. Mamma seemed cross with
Cousin Emmy, and said she was only a very young girl and must put
up with things, and one day Mister Right would come along and it
would be time enough, when that happened, to see what could be
done. And Cousin Emmy got very fierce and said there'd never be any
Mister Right for her, for a man was never allowed to show so much
as his nose in the house. (Huh! <i>That</i> was funny. Why not his
nose?) Mamma said she'd try and make <i>her</i> see reason, and
Cousin Emmy said it'd be like talking to a stone statue, and it
would always be herself first and the rest nowhere, and the plain
truth was, she was simply crazy to get married again and there'd
never be any peace till she had found a husband. And Mamma said,
then she'd have to look out for some one with lots of money, your
Papa's will being what it was. And Cousin Emmy said she was so sick
and tired of everything that sometimes she thought she'd go away
and drown herself. And then she cried again, and Mamma said she was
a very wicked girl, even to <i>think</i> of such a thing. He had to
wink his own eyes hard when she said that, and went on getting
sorrier. And when she was putting on her hat to say good-bye he ran
and got his shells, and when he was allowed to go to the gate with
her he showed her them, and asked if she'd like to have them "for
keeps." And Cousin Emmy thanked him most awfly but couldn't think
of robbing him of his beautiful shells...oh well then, if he wanted
it <i>so</i> much, she would, but only one, and he should keep the
other and it would be like a philippine, and they wouldn't tell
anybody; it would just be their secret. Which it was.</p>

<p>Next day they went to see Aunt Lizzie, where Cousin Emmy lived
with "John's cousins"...no, he meant "John's children." They
couldn't see John, for he was dead. In the wagonette Mamma told him
all about the 'squisite songs Aunt Lizzie used to sing him when he
was quite a young child, and he hoped she would again; but when he
asked her, when she had finished kissing, she clapped her hands and
said law child, her singing days were over. It was Aunt Lizzie who
was averdipoy&mdash;he knew now it meant fat, and not putting on
something, for he had asked Mamma at dinner and Mamma had told him;
but she had been cross, too, and said it was a nasty habit and he
must get out of it, to listen to what his elders said, especially
if you repeated it afterwards. He didn't like Aunt Lizzie much. She
had a great big mouth to sing with, and she opened it so wide when
she talked you could have put a whole mandarin in at once; and she
had rings on her fingers that cut you when she squeezed.</p>

<p>And then Mamma and her wanted to talk secrets, and they were
told to go and play with their cousins. Cousin Emmy took them. Two
of them were nearly grown-up, with their hairs in plaits, and they
didn't take much notice of them but just said, what a funny little
pair of kids to be sure, and whatever was their Mamma thinking of
not to put them in "morning" for their sister. They all had great
big staring black eyes and it made him sorry he had. Cousin Josey
was as horrid as ever. She said she guessed he was going to be a
dwarf and would have to be shown at an Easter Fair, and Luce looked
a reg'lar cry-baby. Cousin Emmy told her not to be so nasty, and
she said her tongue was her own. Cousin Josey was only ten, but
ever so big, with long thin legs in white stockings and black
garters which she kept pulling up; and when she took off her round
comb and put it between her teeth, her hair came over her face till
she looked like a gorilla. When she said that about the cry-baby he
took hold of Luce's hand to pertect her, and squeezed it hard so's
she shouldn't cry. But then Cousin Josey came and pinched Luce's
nose off between her fingers and showed it to her, and she pinched
so hard that Luce got all red and screwed up her eyes like she
really was going to cry. Cousin Emmy said she was not to take any
notice what such a rude girl did, and then Cousin Josey stuck out
her tongue, and Cousin Emmy said she'd box her ears for her if she
didn't take care. And then Cousin Josey put her fingers to her nose
and waggled them&mdash;which was most awfly wicked&mdash;and Cousin
Emmy said no it was too much and tried to catch her, and she ran
away and Cousin Emmy ran too, and they chased and chased like mad
round the table, and the big girls said, go it Jo, don't let her
touch you, and first a chair fell over and then the tablecloth with
the books on it and the inkstand, and it upset on the carpet and
there was an awful noise and Aunt Lizzie and Mamma came running to
see what was the matter. And Aunt Lizzie was furious and screamed
and stamped her foot, and Cousin Josey had to come here, and then
she boxed her ears on both sides fit to kill her. And Mamma said oh
Lizzie don't and something about drums, and Aunt Lizzie said she
was all of a shake, so she hardly knew what she was doing, but this
was just a specimen, Mary, of what she had to put up with, they
fought like turkey-cocks, and Cousin Emmy wasn't a bit of good at
managing them but just as bad as any of them, and there was never a
moment's peace, and she wished she'd seen their father at Jericho
before she'd had anything to do with him or his spoilt brats. And
the other two winked at each other, but Cousin Emmy got wild and
said she couldn't wish it more than she did, and she wouldn't stand
there and hear her father ubbused, and Aunt Lizzie said for two
pins and if she'd any more of her sauce she'd box <i>her</i> ears
as well though she <i>did</i> think herself so grand. And Cousin
Emmy said she dared her to touch her, and it was <i>dreadful</i>.
He was ever so glad when Mamma said it was time to go home, and he
put on his gloves in a hurry. And when they got home Mamma told the
Lady about it and said it was a "tragedy" for everybody concerned.
He didn't like Cousin Emmy quite so well after this. And that night
in bed he told Luce all about the shells and the philippine, and
Luce said if he'd given it her she'd have given it him back and
then he'd still have had two. And he was sorry he hadn't.</p>

<p>Uncle Jerry was a nice man...though he didn't have any whiskers.
Mamma said he looked a perfect sketch, and he'd only cut them off
to please Aunt Fanny who must always be ahlamode. Mamma said he had
to work like a nigger to make money, she spent such a lot, but he
gave him and Luce each a shilling. At first it was only a penny,
and first in one hand, then in the other, but at the end it was a
shilling, to spend <i>exactly</i> as they liked.</p>

<p>And then they had to go home, and got up ever so early to catch
the train. This time it wasn't so jolly. It was too hot: you could
only lie on the seat and watch the sky run past. Mamma took off
their shoes and said, well, chicks, we shall soon be seeing dear
Papa again now, won't that be lovely? And he said, oh yes, won't
it. But inside him he didn't feel it a bit. Mamma had been so nice
all the time at the seaside and now she'd soon be cross and sorry
again...about Lallie and Papa. She looked out of the window, and
wasn't thinking about them any more...thinking about
Papa.&mdash;Well, he <i>was</i> glad he hadn't spent his shilling.
He nearly had. Mamma said what fun it would be if he bought
something for Papa with it. But he hadn't. For Papa wrote a letter
and said for God's sake don't buy me anything, but Mamma did...a
most beautiful silver fruit knife. Luce had bought her doll new
shoes...perhaps some day he'd buy a kite that 'ud fly up and up to
the sky till you couldn't see a speck of it...much higher than a
swing...high like a...Good gracious! he must have gone to sleep,
for Mamma was shaking his arm saying come children, wake up. And
they put on their shoes again and their hats and gloves and stood
at the window to watch for Papa, but it was a long, long time till
they came to Barambogie. Papa was on the platform, and when he saw
them he waved like anything and ran along with the train. And then
he suddenly felt most awfly glad, and got out by himself
di<i>RECK</i>ly the door was open, and Mamma got out too, but as
soon as she did she said oh Richard, what <i>have</i> you been
doing to yourself? And Papa didn't say anything, but only kissed
and kissed them, and said how well they looked, and he was too
tired to jump them high, and while he was saying this he suddenly
began to cry. And the luggage-man stared like anything and so did
the stationmaster, and Mamma said, oh dear whatever is it, and not
before everybody Richard, and please just send the luggage after
us, and then she took Papa's arm and walked him away. And Luce and
him had to go on in front...so's not to see. But he did, and went
all hot inside, and felt most awfly ashamed.</p>

<p>And Papa cried and cried...he could hear him through the surgery
door.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-2-5" id="ch-3-2-5"></a>Chapter V</h3>

<p>When Mary came out of the surgery and shut the door behind her,
she leaned heavily up against it for a moment, pressing her hand to
her throat; then, with short steps and the blank eyes of a
sleepwalker, crossed the passage to the bedroom and sat stiffly
down. She was still in bonnet and mantle, just as she had got out
of the train: it had not occurred to her to remove them. And she
was glad of the extra covering, for in spite of the heat of the day
she felt very cold. Cold...and old. The scene she had just been
through with Richard seemed, at a stroke, to have added years to
her age. It had been a dreadful experience. With his arms on the
table, his head on his arms, he had cried like a child, laying
himself bare to her, too, with a child's pitiful abandon. He told
of his distraction at the abrupt stoppage of the practice; of his
impression of being deliberately shunned; of his misery and
loneliness, his haunting dread of illness&mdash;and, on top of
this, blurted out pell-mell, as if he could keep nothing back, as
if, indeed, he got a wild satisfaction out of making it, came the
confession of his mad folly, the debt, the criminal debt in which
he had entangled them, and under the shadow of which, all unknown
to her, they had lived for the past year. Oh! well for him that he
could not see her face as he spoke; or guess at the hideous
pictures his words set circling in her brain; the waves of wrath
and despair that ran through her. After her first spasmodic gasp
of: "<i>Richard!</i> <i>Eight</i> hundred pounds!" the only outward
sign of her inner commotion had been a sudden stiffening of her
limbs, an involuntary withdrawal of the arm that had lain round his
shoulders. Not for a moment could she afford to let her real
feelings escape her: her single exclamation had led to a further
bout of self-reproaches. Before everything, he had to be calmed,
brought back to his senses, and an end put to this distressing
scene. What would the children think, to hear their father behave
like this?...his hysterical weeping...his loud, agitated tones. And
so, without reflection, she snatched at any word of comfort that
offered; repeated the old, threadbare phrases about things not
being as black as he painted them; of everything seeming worse if
you were alone; of how they would meet this new misfortune side by
side and shoulder to shoulder&mdash;they still had each other,
which was surely half the battle? With never a hint of censure;
till she had him composed.</p>

<p>But as she sat in the bedroom, with arms and legs like stone,
resentment and bitterness overwhelmed her...oh, a sheerly
intolerable bitterness! Never! not to her dying day, would she
forgive him the trick he had played on her...the deceit he had
practised. On her...his own wife. So <i>this</i> was why he had
left Hawthorn!&mdash;why he had not been able to wait to let the
practice grow&mdash;<i>this</i> the cause of his feverish alarm
here, did a single patient drop off. Now she understood&mdash;and
many another thing besides. Oh, what had he done...so recklessly
done!...to her, to his children? For there had been no real need
for this fresh load of misery: they could just as easily&mdash;more
easily&mdash;have rented a house. His pride alone had barred the
way. It wouldn't have been good enough for him; nothing ever
<i>was</i> good enough; he was always trying to outshine others. No
matter how she might suffer over it, who feared debt more than
anything in the world. But with him it had always been self first.
Look at the home-coming he had prepared for her! He had hardly let
her step inside before he had sprung his mine. Of course he had
lost his head with excitement at their arrival...had hardly known
what he was saying. Yes! but no doubt he had also thought to
himself: at the pass to which things were come, the sooner his
confession was made, the better for him. <i>What</i> a
home-coming!</p>

<p>Further than this, however, she did not get. For the children,
still in their travelling clothes and hot, tired and hungry, were
at the door, clamouring for attention. With fumbly hands she took
off her bonnet, smoothed her hair, pinned on her cap, tied a little
black satin apron round her waist; and went out to them with the
pinched lips and haggard eyes it so nipped Cuffy's heart to
see.</p>

<p>Her pearl necklace would have to go: that was the first clear
thought she struck from chaos. It was night now: the children had
been fed and bathed and put to bed, the trunks unpacked, drawers
and wardrobes straightened, the house&mdash;it was dirty and
neglected&mdash;looked through, and Richard, pale as a ghost but
still pitifully garrulous, coaxed to bed in his turn. She sat alone
in the little dining-room, her own eyes feeling as if they would
never again need sleep. Her necklace...even as the thought came to
her she started up and, stealing on tiptoe into the bedroom,
carried her dressing-case back with her...just to make sure: for an
instant she had feared he might have been beforehand with her. But
there the pearls lay, safe and sound. Well! as jewellery she would
not regret them: she hadn't worn them for years, and had never
greatly cared for being bedizened and behung. Bought in those palmy
days when money slid like sand through Richard's fingers, they had
cost him close on a hundred pounds. Surely she ought still to get
enough for them&mdash;and for their companion brooches, rings,
chains, ear-rings and bracelets&mdash;to make up the sums of money
due for the coming months, which he admitted not having been able
to get together. For consent to let the mortgage lapse she never
would: not if she was forced to sell the clothes off her back, or
to part, piece by piece, with the Paris ornaments, the table
silver...Richard's books. It would be sheer madness; after having
paid out hundreds and hundreds of pounds. Besides, the knowledge
that you had this house behind you made all the difference. If the
worst came to the worst they could retire to Hawthorn, and she take
in boarders. She didn't care a rap what she did, so long as they
contrived to pay their way.</p>

<p>How to dispose of the necklace was the puzzle. To whom could she
turn? She ran over various people but dismissed them all. Even
Tilly. When it came to making Richard's straits public, she was
hedged on every side. Ah! but now she had it: <i>Zara!</i> If, as
seemed probable, Zara came to take up her abode with them to teach
the children, she would soon see for herself how matters stood.
(And at least she was one's own sister.) Zara...trailing her
weeds&mdash;why yes, even these might be turned to account. Widows
did not wear jewellery; and were often left poorly off. People
would pity her, perhaps give more, because of it.</p>

<p>And so, having fetched pen, ink and paper, Mary drew the
kerosene lamp closer and set to writing her letter.</p>

<p>It wasn't easy; she made more than one start. Not even to Zara
could she tell the unvarnished truth. She shrank, for instance,
from admitting that only now had she herself learnt of Richard's
difficulties. Zara might think strange things...about him and her.
So she put the step she was forced to take, down to the expenses of
their seaside holiday. Adding, however, that jewellery was useless
in a place like this where you had no chance of wearing it; and
even something of a risk, owing to the house standing by itself and
having so many doors.</p>

<p>The letter written she made a second stealthy journey, this time
to the surgery, where she ferreted out Richard's case-books. She
had a lurking hope that, yet once more, he might have been guilty
of his usual exaggeration. But half a glance at the blank pages
taught her better. Things were even worse than he had admitted.
What <i>could</i> have happened during her absence? What had he
done, to make people turn against him? Practices didn't die out
like this in a single day&mdash;somehow or other he must have been
to blame. Well! it would be her job, henceforth, to put things
straight again: somehow or other to re-capture the patients. And if
Richard really laid himself out to conciliate people&mdash;he
<i>could</i> be so taking, if he chose&mdash;and not badger
them...Let him only scrape together enough for them to live on, and
she would do the rest: her thoughts leapt straightway to a score of
petty economies. The expenses of food and clothing might be cut
down all round; and they would certainly go on no more long and
costly holidays: had she only known the true state of affairs
before setting out this summer! But she had been so anxious about
the children...oh! she was forgetting the children. And here,
everything coming back to her with a rush, Mary felt her courage
waver. Merciless to herself; with only a half-hearted pity for
Richard, grown man that he was and the author of all the trouble;
she was at once a craven and wrung with compassion where her
children were concerned.</p>

<p>At the breakfast-table next morning she sat preoccupied; and
directly the meal was over put the first of her schemes into action
by sending for the defaulting Maria and soundly rating her. But she
could get no sensible reason from the girl for running
away&mdash;or none but the muttered remark that it had been "too
queer" in the house with them all gone. After which, tying on her
bonnet Mary set out for the township, a child on either hand. Lucie
trotted docilely; but Cuffy was restive at being buttoned into his
Sunday suit on a week-day, and dragged back and shuffled his feet
in the dust till they were nearly smothered. Instead of trying to
help Mamma by being an extra good boy!</p>

<p>"But I don't <i>feel</i> good."</p>

<p>Once out of sight of the house, Mary took two crepe bands from
her pocket and slipped them over the children's white sleeves.
Richard's ideas about mourning were bound to give...had perhaps
already given offence. People of the class they were now dependent
on thought so much of funerals and mourning. But he never stopped
to consider the feelings of others. She remembered how he had
horrified Miss Prestwick, with his heathenish ideas about the
children's prayers. All of a sudden one day he had declared they
were getting too big to kneel down and pray "into the void," or to
"a glorified man"; and had had them taught a verse which said that
loving all things big and little was the best kind of prayer and so
on; making a regular to-do about it when he discovered that Miss
Prestwick was still letting them say their "Gentle Jesus" on the
sly.</p>

<p>Here she righted two hats and took Cuffy's elastic out of his
mouth; for they were entering the township; and for once the main
street was not in its usual state of desertedness, when it seemed
as if the inhabitants must all lie dead of the plague...or be gone
<i>en masse</i> to a fairing. The butcher's cart drove briskly to
and fro; a spring-cart had come in from the bush; buggies stood
before the Bank. The police-sergeant touched his white helmet;
horses were being backed between the shafts of the coach in front
of the "Sun." Everybody of course eyed her and the children very
curiously, and even emerged from their shops to stare after them.
It was the first time she had ever walked her own children out, and
on top of that she had been absent for over two months. (Perhaps
people imagined she had gone for good! Oh, could <i>that</i>
possibly be a reason?) However she made the best of it: smiled, and
nodded, and said good-day; and in spite of their inquisitive looks
every one she met was very friendly. She went into the butcher's to
choose a joint, and took the opportunity of thanking the butcher
for having served the doctor so well during her absence The man
beamed: and showed the children a whole dead pig he had hanging in
the shop. She gave an order to the grocer, who leaned over the
counter with two bunches of raisins, remarking "A fine little pair
of nippers you have there, Mrs. Mahony!" To the baker she praised
his bread, comparing it favourably with what she had eaten in
Melbourne; and the man's wife pressed sweets on the children. At
the draper's, which she entered to buy some stuff for pinafores,
the same fuss was made over them...till she bade them run outside
and wait for her there. For the drapery woman began putting all
sorts of questions about Lallie's illness, and what they had done
for her, and how they had treated it...odd and prying questions,
and asked with a strange air. Still, there was kindness behind the
curiosity. "We did all feel that sorry for <i>you</i>, Mrs.
Mahony...losing such a fine sturdy little girl!" And blinking her
eyes to keep the tears back, Mary began to think that Richard must
have gone <i>deliberately</i> out of his way, to make enemies of
these simple, well-meaning souls. Bravely she re-told the tale of
her loss, being iron in her resolve to win people round; but she
was thankful when the questionnaire ended and she was free to quit
the shop. To see what the children were doing, too. She could hear
Cuffy chattering away to somebody.</p>

<p>This proved to be the Reverend Mr. Thistlethwaite, who had
engaged the pair in talk with the super-heartiness he reserved for
what he called the "young or kitchen fry" of his parish. In his
usual state of undress &mdash;collarless, with unbuttoned vest, his
bare feet thrust in carpet slippers&mdash;he was so waggish that
Mary could not help suspecting where his morning stroll had led
him.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Madam, good morning to you! Back again, back
again? <i>And</i> the little Turks! Capital...quite capital!"</p>

<p>He slouched along beside them, his paunch, under its grease
spots, a-shake with laughter at his own jokes. The children of
course were all ears; and she would soon have slipped into
anothershop and so have got rid of him&mdash;you never knew what he
was going to say next&mdash;if a sudden bright idea had not flashed
into her mind.</p>

<p>It came of Mr. Thistlethwaite mentioning that the Bishop was
shortly expected to visit the district; and humorously bemoaning
his own lot. For, should his Lordship decide to break his journey
at Barambogie on his way home, he, Thistlethwaite, would be obliged
to ask him to share his bachelor quarters. "Which are all very well
for hens and self, Mrs. Mahony...hens and self! But for his
Lordship? Oh dear, no!"</p>

<p>Privately Mary recognised the ruse. The piggery in which
Thistlethwaite housed had stood him in good stead before now: never
yet had the parsonage been in fit state to receive a brother
cleric. But at the present crisis she jumped at the handle it
offered her.</p>

<p>"But he must come to us!" cried she. "The doctor and I would be
only too delighted. And for as long as he likes. Another thing: why
not, while he <i>is</i> here, persuade him to give us a short
lecture or address? We might even get up a little concert to
follow, and devote the money to the fencing fund."&mdash;For the
church still stood on open ground. In the course of the past year
but a meagre couple of pounds had been raised towards enclosing it;
and what had become of these, nobody knew.</p>

<p>And now Mary's ideas came thick and fast; rising even to the
supreme labour of a "Tea-meeting." And while Thistlethwaite hummed
aloud in ever greater good humour, mentally cracking his fingers to
the tune of: "That's the ticket...women for ever! The work for
them, and the glory for us," Mary was telling herself that to
secure the Bishop as their guest would go far towards restoring
Richard's lost prestige. He would be reinstated as the leading
person in the township; and the fact of his Lordship staying with
them would bring people about the house again, who <i>might</i>
turn to patients. At any rate Richard and he would be seen in the
street together, and at concert or lecture it would naturally fall
to Richard to take the chair.</p>

<p>Striking while the iron was hot, she offered her services to
mend the altarcloth; to darn and "get up" a surplice; to over-sew
the frayed edges of a cassock. She would also see, she promised,
what could be done to hide a hole in the carpet before the lectern,
in which the Bishop might catch his foot. For this purpose they
entered the church. It was pleasantly cool there, after the blazing
heat out of doors; and having made her inspection Mary was glad to
rest for a moment. The children felt very proud at being allowed
inside the church when it wasn't Sunday; and Thistlethwaite
actually let Cuffy mount the pulpit-steps and repeat: "We are but
little children weak," so that he could see what it felt like to
preach a sermon. Cuffy spoke up well, and remembered his words, and
Mr. Thistlethwaite said they'd see him in the cloth yet; but all
the time he, Cuffy, wasn't <i>really</i> thinking what he was
saying. For he spied a funny little cupboard under the ledge of the
pulpit, and while he was doing his hymn he managed to finger it
open, and inside he saw a glass and a water-jug and a
medicine-bottle. And next Sunday he watched the water Mr.
Thistlethwaite drank before he preached, and saw he put medicine in
it first. But when he asked Mamma if he was ill, and if not, why he
took it, she got cross and said he was a very silly little boy, and
he was to be sure and not say things like that before people.</p>

<p>There was still Richard to talk over on getting home. And he was
in a bad temper at their prolonged absence. "All this time in the
township? What for? Buying your own eatables? What on <i>earth</i>
will people think of you?&mdash;Not to speak of dragging the
children after you like any nursemaid."</p>

<p>"Oh, let me go my own way to work."</p>

<p>To reconcile him to the Bishop's visit was a tough job. Gloomily
he admitted that it might serve a utilitarian end. But the
upset...to think of the upset! "It means the sofa for me again.
While old M., who's as strong as a horse, snores on my pillow. The
sofa's like a board; I never sleep a wink on it; it sets every bone
in my body aching."</p>

<p>"But only for one night...or at most two. Surely you can endure
a few aches for the good that may come of it? Oh, Richard,
<i>don't</i> go about thinking what obstacles you can put in my
way! I'm quite sure I can help you, if you'll give me a free
hand."</p>

<p>And she was right...as usual. The mere rumour that so important
a visitor was expected&mdash;and she took care it circulated
freely&mdash;brought a trickle of people back to the house. By the
end of the week, Richard had treated four patients.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-2-6" id="ch-3-2-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>They were at breakfast when the summons came&mdash;breakfast,
the hardest meal of any to get through without friction. Richard
invariably ate at top speed and with his eyes glued to his plate;
in order, he said, not to be obliged to see Zara's dusty crepe and
bombazine, the mere sight of which on these hot mornings took away
his appetite. But he also hoped by example to incite Zara to haste:
now she was there, the meals dragged out to twice their usual
length. For Zara had a patent habit of masticating each mouthful
so-and-so many times before swallowing; and the children forgot to
eat, in counting their aunt's bites. With their ears cocked for the
click at the finish. Mamma said it was her teeth that did it, and
it was rude to listen. Aunt Zara called her teeth her
<i>mashwar</i>. Why did she, and why did they click? But it was no
good asking <i>her</i>. She never told you anything...except
lessons.</p>

<p>Yes, Mary had got her way, and for a couple of weeks now, Zara
had been installed as governess. As a teacher she had not her
equal. She also made a very good impression in the township,
looking so much the lady, speaking with such precision and all
that. But&mdash;well, it was a good job nothing had been said to
Richard of her exaggerated offer to wash dishes and scrub floors.
How he would have crowed! Apart from this, she had landed them in a
real quandary by arriving with every stick of furniture she
possessed: her bed, her mahogany chest of drawers, a night-commode.
In the tiny bedroom which was all they had to offer her, there was
hardly room to stand; while still unpacked portmanteaux and
gladstone-bags lined the passage, Zara having turned nasty at a
hint of the outhouse. And directly lessons were over, she shut
herself up among her things with a bottle of French polish.</p>

<p>Of course, poor soul, they were all that was left her of her own
home: you couldn't wonder at her liking to keep them nice. And the
main thing was, the children were making headway. Reward enough for
her, Mary, to hear them gabbling their French of a morning, or
learning their steps to Zara's: "One, two, <i>chassez</i>, one!"
Such considerations didn't weigh with Richard though. Just as of
old, everything Zara said or did exasperated him. He was furious
with her, too, for grumbling at the size of her room.&mdash;But
there! It wasn't only Zara who grated on his nerves. It was
everybody and everything.</p>

<p>On this particular day all her tact would be needed. For the
message Maria had looked in during breakfast to deliver was a
summons to Brown's Plains; and if there was one thing he disliked
more than another, it was the bush journeys he was being called on
to face anew. "What!...again? Good God!" he looked up from his
gobbling to ejaculate. Which expression made Zara pinch her lips
and raise her eyebrows; besides being so bad for the children to
hear. She, Mary, found his foot under the table and pressed it but
that irritated him, too, and he was nasty enough to say: "What are
you kicking me for?" Breakfast over, she sent Maria to the "Sun" to
bespeak a buggy; looked out his driving things, put likely
requisites in his bag&mdash;as usual the people hadn't said what
the matter was&mdash;and, her own work in the house done, changed
her dress and tied on a shady hat. Now that Zara was there to mind
the children, she frequently made a point of accompanying Richard
on these drives.</p>

<p>The buggy came round: it was another of her innovations to have
it brought right to the door; he had nothing to do but to step in.
But at the gate they found Cuffy, who began teasing to be allowed
to go, too. He had no one to play with; Lucie was asleep and Maria
was busy, and Aunt Zara shut up in her room; and he was <i>so</i>
tired of reading. Thus he pouted, putting on his special unhappy
baby face; and as often as he did this it got at something in his
mother, which made her weak towards her first-born. So she said,
oh, very well then, if he wanted to so much, he might; and sent him
in to wash his hands and fetch his hat. Richard, of course, let
loose a fresh string of grumbles: it would be hot enough with just
the pair of them, without having the child thrown in. But Mary,
too, was cross and tired, and said she wasn't going to give way
over every trifle; and so Cuffy, who had shrunk back at the sharp
words, was hoisted up and off they set.&mdash;And soon the three of
them, a tight fit in the high, two-wheeled, hooded vehicle, had
left the township behind them, and were out on bush tracks where
the buggy rocked and pitched like a ship on the broken waters of a
rough sea.</p>

<p>Cuffy had never before been so far afield, and his spirits were
irrepressible. He twisted this way and that, jerked his legs and
bored with his elbows, flinging round to ask question after
question. It fell to Mary to supply the answers; and she had scant
patience with the curiosity of children, who hardly listened to
what you told them in their eagerness to ask anew. But her "I
wonder!" "How do I know?" and "Don't bother me!" failed to damp
Cuffy, who kept up his flow till he startled her by exclaiming with
a vigorous sigh: "Ugh! I <i>do</i> feel so hot and funny." His
small face was flushed and distressed.</p>

<p>"That's what comes of so much talking," said Mary, and without
more ado whisked off his sailor-hat, with its cribbing
chin-elastic, undid his shoes, slid his feet out of his socks.</p>

<p>Thus much Cuffy permitted. But when it came to taking off his
tunic, leaving him to sit exposed in his little vest, he fought her
unbuttoning hands.</p>

<p>"<i>Don't</i>, Mamma&mdash;I won't!"</p>

<p>"But there's nobody to see! And it wouldn't matter if they
did&mdash;you're only a little boy. No, you <i>would</i> come. Now
you must do as I tell you."</p>

<p>And when she knew quite well how he felt! Why, not even Lucie
was allowed to see him undressed. Since they had slept in the same
room she had always to go to bed first, and turn her face to the
wall, and shut her eyes tight, while he flew out of his clothes and
into his nightshirt. To have to sit in broad daylight with naked
arms, and his neck, too, and his braces showing! All his pleasure
in the drive was spoiled. At each turn in the road he was on thorns
lest somebody should be there who'd see him. Oh, <i>why</i> must
Mamma be like this? Why didn't she take her own clothes off? His
belonged to him. (He <i>hated</i> Mamma.)</p>

<p>Nursing this small agony, he could think of nothing else. And
now there was silence in the buggy, which lurched and jolted,
Richard taking as good as no pains to avoid the foot-deep,
cast-iron ruts, the lumpy rocks and stones. Over they went
sideways, then up in the air and down again with a bump. "Oh,
gently, dear! <i>Do</i> be careful." He wasn't the driver for this
kind of thing. She never felt really safe with him.&mdash;And here
there came to her mind a memory of the very first time they had
driven together: on their wedding journey from Geelong to Ballarat.
How nervous she had been that day...how home-sick and lonely,
too!...beside some one who was little more than a stranger to her,
behind a strange horse on an unknown road, bound for a place of
which she knew nothing. Ah well, it was perhaps a wise arrangement
on the part of Providence that you <i>didn't</i> know what lay
ahead...or you might never set out at all. Could <i>she</i> have
foreseen all that marriage was to mean: how Richard would change
and the dance he would lead her; all the nagging worry and the
bitter suffering; then, yes then, poor young inexperienced thing
that she was, full of romantic ideas, and expecting only happiness
as her lot, she might have been excused for shrinking back in
dismay.&mdash;Her chief objection nowadays to driving was the waste
of time. To make up for having to sit there with her hands before
her, she let her mind run free, and was deep in her usual
reckonings&mdash;reducing grocer's and butcher's bills, making over
her old dresses for the children&mdash;when a violent heave of the
buggy all but threw her from her seat: she had just time to fling a
protective arm round Cuffy, to save the child from pitching clean
over the dashboard. Without warning, Richard had leant forward and
dealt the horse a vicious cut on the neck. The beast, which had
been ambling drearily, started, stumbled, and would have gone down,
had he not tugged and sawed it by the mouth. For a few seconds they
flew ahead, rocking and swaying, she holding to the child with one
hand, to the rail with the other.&mdash;"Do you want to break our
necks?"</p>

<p>Mahony made no reply.</p>

<p>Gradually the rough canter ceased, and the horse fell back on
its former jog-trot. It was a very poor specimen, old and lean; and
the likelihood was, had been in harness most of the morning.</p>

<p>Again they crawled forward. The midday heat blazed; the red dust
enveloped them, dimming their eyes, furring their tongues; there
was not an inch of shade anywhere. Except under the close black
hood, where they sat as if glued together.</p>

<p>Then came another savage lash from Richard, another leap on the
part of the horse, more snatching at any hold she could find, the
buggy toppling this way and that. Cuffy was frightened and clung to
her dress, while she, outraged and alarmed, made indignant
protest.</p>

<p>"Are you crazy? If you do that again, I shall get out."</p>

<p>For all answer Richard said savagely: "Oh, hold your tongue,
woman!" Before the child, too!</p>

<p>But her hurt and anger alike passed unheeded. Mahony saw
nothing&mdash;nothing but the tremulous heat-lines, which caused
the whole landscape to quiver and swim before him. His head ached
to bursting: it might have had a band of iron round it, the screws
in which were tightened, with an agonising twist, at each lurch of
the vehicle, at Cuffy's shrill pipe, Mary's loud, exasperated
tones. Inside this circlet of pain his head felt swollen and
top-heavy, an unnatural weight on his shoulders: the exact reverse
of an unpleasant experience he had had the night before. Then, as
he went to lay it on the pillow it had seemed to lose its solidity,
and, grown light as a puff-ball, had gone clean through pillow,
bolster, mattress, drawing his shoulders after it, down and down,
head-foremost, till he felt as if he were dropping like a stone
through space. With the bed-curtain fast in one hand, a bed-post in
the other, he had managed to hold on while the vertigo lasted, his
teeth clenched to hinder himself from crying out and alarming Mary.
But the fear of a recurrence had kept him awake half the night, and
to-day he felt very poorly, and disinclined for any exertion. He
would certainly have jibbed at driving out all this distance, had
it not been for Mary and her hectoring ways. He was unable to face
the fuss and bother in which a refusal would involve him.</p>

<p>If only they could reach their destination! They seemed to have
been on the road for hours. But&mdash;with the horse that had been
fobbed off on him...old, spiritless, and stubborn as a mule...And
there he had to sit, hunched up, crushed in, with no room to
stir...with hardly room to breathe. One of Mary's utterly mistaken
ideas of kindness, to dog his steps as she did. To tack the child
on, too...Because <i>she</i> liked company...But his needs had
never been hers. Solitude...solitude was all he asked...to be left
alone the greatest favour anyone could now do him. Seclusion had
become as essential as air or water to the act of living. His brain
refused its work were others present Which reminded him, there was
something he had been going to think over on this very drive:
something vital, important. But though he ransacked his mind from
end to end, it remained blank. Or mere disconnected thoughts and
scraps of thought flitted across it, none of which led anywhere.
Enraged at his powerlessness he let the horse taste the whip; but
the relief the quickened speed afforded him was over almost as soon
as begun, and once more they ambled at a funeral pace. Damnation
take the brute! Was he, because of it, to sit for ever on this
hard, narrow seat, chasing incoherencies round an empty brain?...to
drive for all eternity along these intolerable roads?...through
this accursed bush, where the very trees grimaced at you in
distorted attitudes, like stage ranters declaiming an exaggerated
passion&mdash;or pointed at you with the obscene gestures of the
insane...obscene, because so wholly without significance.&mdash;And
again he snatched up the whip.</p>

<p>But the prolonged inaction was doing its work: a sense of
unreality began to invade him, his surroundings to take on the
blurred edges of a dream: one of those nightmare-dreams in which
the dreamer knows that he is bound to reach a certain place in a
given time, yet whose legs are weighed down by invisible
weights...or which feel as if they are being dragged through water,
tons of impeding water...or yet again the legs of
elephantiasis...swollen, monstrous, heavy as lead: all this, while
time, the precious time that remains <i>before</i> the event, is
flying. Yes, somewhere...far away, out in the world...life and time
were rushing by: he could hear the rhythm of their passing in the
beat of his blood. He alone lay stranded&mdash;incapable of
movement. And, as always at the thought of his lost freedom madness
seized him: dead to everything but his own need, he rose in his
seat and began to rain down blows on the horse: to beat it
mercilessly, hitting out where ever the lash found place&mdash;on
head, neck, ears, the forelegs, the quivering undersides. In vain
the wretched creature struggled to break free, to evade the cut of
the thong: it backed, tried to rear, dragged itself from side to
side, ducked its defenceless head, the white foam flying. But for
it, too, strapped down, buckled in, there was no chance of escape.
And the blows fell...and fell.</p>

<p>"<i>Richard!</i> Oh, <i>don't</i>!&mdash;don't beat the poor
thing like that! How can you? What are you doing?" For, cruellest
of all, he was holding the animal in to belabour it, refusing to
let it carry out its pitiful attempts to obey the lash. "You who
pretend to be so fond of animals!" There was no anger now in Mary's
voice: only entreaty, and a deep compassion.&mdash;And in the mad
race that followed, when they tore along, in and out of ruts, on
the track and off, skimming trees and bushes, always on the edge of
capsizing, blind with dust: now, frightened though she was, she
just set her teeth and held fast and said never a word...though she
saw it was all Richard could do to keep control: his lean wrists
spanned like iron.</p>

<p>Brought up at length alongside a rail-and-post fence, the horse
stood shaking and sweating, its red nostrils working like bellows,
the marks of the lash on its lathered hide. And Richard was
trembling too. His hand shook so that he could hardly replace the
whip in its socket.</p>

<p>With an unspoken "Thank God!" Mary slid to the ground, dragging
Cuffy after her. Her legs felt as if they were made of pulp.</p>

<p>"I think this must be the place...I think I see a house...No,
no, you stop here. I'll go on and find out." (Impossible for him to
face strangers in the state he was in.) "Hush, Cuffy! It's all
right now." Saying this she made to draw the child under a bush; he
was lying sobbing just as she had dropped him.</p>

<p>But Cuffy pushed her away. "Leave me alone!" He only wanted to
stop where he was. And cry. He felt so <i>dread</i>fully miserable.
For the poor horse...it couldn't cry for itself...only run and
run&mdash;and it hadn't <i>done</i> anything...'cept be very old
and tired...prayeth best who loveth best...oh! everything was
turned all black inside him. But for Papa, too, because...he didn't
know why...only...when Mamma had gone and Papa thought nobody would
see him, he went up to the horse's neck and stroked it. And that
made him cry more still.</p>

<p>But when he came and sat down by him and said "Cuffy," and put
out his arms, then he went straight into them, and Papa held him
tight, so that he could feel the hard sticking-out bone that was
his shoulder. And they just sat and never spoke a word, till they
heard Mamma coming back; and then Papa let him go, and he jumped up
and pretended to be looking at something on the ground.</p>

<p>Marry carried a dipper of water.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is it right enough. There's been an
accident&mdash;the son&mdash;they're afraid he's broken his leg.
Oh, <i>why</i> can't people send clearer messages! Can you rig up
some splints? A man's bringing a bucket for the horse. Come, let me
dust you down. No, I'll wait here I'd rather."</p>

<p>Richard went off bag in hand: she watched him displacing and
replacing slip-rails, walking stiffly over the rough ground. Just
before he vanished he turned and waved, and she waved back. But
this last duty performed, she sat heavily down, and dropped her
head in her hands. And there she sat, forgetful of where she was,
of Cuffy, the heat, the return journey that had to be faced: just
sat, limp and spent, thinking things from which she would once have
shrunk in horror.</p>

<p>All the way home Cuffy carried in his pocket half one of the
nicest sugar-biscuits the people had sent him out by Papa. It was a
present for the horse. But when the moment came to give it, his
courage failed. Everybody else had forgotten: the horse, too: it
was in a great hurry to get back to its stable. He didn't like to
be the only one to remember, to make it look as if he was still
sorry. So, having feebly fingered the biscuit&mdash;the sugary top
had melted and stuck to his pocket&mdash;he ate it up himself.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-2-7" id="ch-3-2-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>For some time after this, Cuffy fought shy of his father; and
tried never, if he could help it, to be alone with him. It wasn't
only embarrassment at having been nursed and petted like a baby.
The events of the drive had left a kind of fear behind them: a fear
not of his father, but for him: he was afraid of having to see what
Papa was feeling. If he was with him, he didn't seem able not to.
And he didn't <i>like</i> it. For he wanted so awf'ly much to be
happy&mdash;in this house that he loved, with the verandah, and the
garden, and the fowls, and the Lagoon&mdash;and when he saw Papa
miserable, he couldn't be. So he gave the end of the verandah on
which the surgery opened a wide berth; avoiding the dining-room,
too...when it wasn't just meals. For there was no sofa in the
surgery, and if Papa had a headache he sometimes went and lay down
in the dining-room.</p>

<p>But he couldn't <i>always</i> manage it.</p>

<p>There was that day Mamma sent him in to fetch her scissors, and
Papa was on the sofa with the blind down and his eyes shut, and his
feet sticking over the end. Cuffy walked on the tips of his toes.
But just when he thought he was safe, Papa was watching him. And
put his hand out and said: "Come here to me, Cuffy. There's
something I wish to say to you."</p>

<p>The words struck chill. With resistance in every limb, Cuffy
obeyed.</p>

<p>"Pull up the hassock; sit down." And there he was, alone in the
dark with Papa, his heart going pit-a-pat.</p>

<p>Papa took his hand. And held on to it. "You're getting a big boy
now; you'll soon be seven years old...when I was not much older
than that, my dear, I was being thrashed because I could not turn
French phrases into Latin."</p>

<p>"What's Latin?" (Oh, perhaps after all it was just going to be
about when Papa was little.)</p>

<p>"Latin is one of the dead languages."</p>

<p>"How can it...be dead? It isn't a...a man."</p>

<p>"Things perish, too, child. A language dies when it is no longer
in common use; when it ceases to be a means of communication
between living people."</p>

<p>This was too much for Cuffy. He struggled with the idea for a
moment, then gave it up, and asked: "Why did you have to? And why
did your Mamma let you be thrashed?" (Lots and lots of questions.
Papa always told.)</p>

<p>"Convention demanded it...convention and tradition...the slavish
tradition of a country that has always rated the dead lion higher
than the live dog. And thralls to this notion were those in whose
hands at that time lay the training of the young. The torturing
rather! A lifetime lies between, but I can still feel something of
the misery, the hopelessness, the inability to understand what was
required of you, the dread of what awaited you was your task ill
done or left undone. A forlorn and frightened child...with no one
to turn to, for help or advice. That most sensitive, most delicate
of instruments&mdash;the mind of a little child! Small wonder that
I vowed to myself, if ever I had children of my own...to let the
young brain lie fallow...not so much as the alphabet...the A B
C..." Thus, forgetful of his little hearer, Mahony rambled on. And
Cuffy, listening to a lot more of such talk (nasty talk!) kept
still as a broody hen, not shuffling his feet, or sniffling, or
doing anything to interrupt, for fear of what might come next.</p>

<p>Then Papa stopped and was so quiet he thought he'd gone to sleep
again. He hoped so. He'd stay there till he was <i>quite</i> sure.
But through his trying too hard not to make a noise, a button
squeaked, and Papa opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"But...this wasn't what I brought you here to say." He looked
fondly at the child and stroked his rough, little-boy hand.
"Listen, Cuffy. Papa hasn't felt at all well lately, and is
sometimes very troubled...about many things. And he wants you, my
dear, to promise him that if anything should...I mean if I
should"&mdash;he paused, seeking a euphemism&mdash;"if I should
have to leave you, leave you all, then I want you to promise me
that you will look after Mamma for me, take care of her in my
place, and be a help to her in every way you can. Will you?"</p>

<p>Cuffy nodded: his throat felt much too tight to speak. Dropping
his head he watched his toe draw something on the carpet. To hear
Papa say things like this made him feel like he did when he had to
take his clothes off.</p>

<p>"Your little sister too, of course, but Mamma most of all. She
has had so much to bear...so much care and trouble. And I fear
there's more to come. Be good to her, Cuffy!&mdash;And one other
thing. Whatever happens, my little son...and who knows what life
may have in store for you...I want you never to forget that you are
a gentleman&mdash;a gentleman first and foremost&mdash;no matter
what you do or where you go, or who your companions may be.
<i>noblesse oblige</i>. With that for your motto you cannot go far
wrong."</p>

<p>"What a lot of little hairs you've got on your hand, Papa!"
Cuffy blurted this out, hardly knowing what he said. Nobody...not
even Papa...had the right to speak such things to him. They
<i>hurt</i>.</p>

<p>Free at last he ran to the garden, where he fell to playing his
wildest, merriest games. And Mahony, lying listening to the
childish rout, thought sadly to himself: "No use...too young."</p>

<p>That Papa might be going away stayed Cuffy's secret: he didn't
even tell Lucie. Or at least not till she got a secret, too. He saw
at once there was something up; and it didn't take him half a jiffy
to worm it out of her. They sat on the other side of the
fowl-house; but she whispered, all the same. "I fink Mamma's going
away."</p>

<p>Cuffy, leaning over her with his arm round her neck, jerked
upright, eyes and mouth wide open. <i>What?</i>...Mamma, too? Oh,
but that couldn't be true...it couldn't! He laughed out loud, and
was very stout and bold in denial because of the fright it gave
him. "Besides, if she did, she'd take us with her."</p>

<p>But his little sister shook her head. "I heard her tell Papa
yesterday, one of vese days she'd just pack her boxes an' walk
outer the house an' leave bof him an' the child'en. An' then he
could see how he liked it." And the chubby face wrinkled
piteously.</p>

<p>"Hush, Luce! they'll hear you&mdash;don't cry, there's a good
girl. I'll look after <i>you</i>...always! An' when I'm a big man
I'll...I'll marry you. So there! Won't that be nice?"</p>

<p>But Cuffy's world tottered. Papa's going would be bad
enough...though...yes...<i>he'd</i> take care of Mamma so well that
she'd never be worried again. But that <i>she</i> should think of
leaving them was not to be borne. Life without Mamma! The nearest
he could get to it was when he had once had to stop alone at a big
railway station to mind the luggage, while Mamma and Luce went to
buy the tickets. It had taken so long, and there were so many
people, and he was so sure the train would go without them...or
else they might forget him, forget to come back...or get into a
wrong train and he be left there...standing there for always. His
heart had thumped and thumped...and he watched for them till his
eyes got so big they almost fell out...and the porters were running
and shouting...and the doors banging...oh dear, oh dear!</p>

<p>He knew what the row had been about&mdash;a picture Cousin Emmy
had painted quite by herself, and sent as a present to Mamma. Mamma
thought it was a lovely picture, and so did he: all sea and rocks,
with little men in red caps sitting on them. But Papa said it was a
horrible dorb, and he wouldn't have it in <i>his</i> house. And
Mamma said that was only because it was made by a relation of hers,
and if it had been one of his, he would have liked it; and it was
an oil painting, and oil paintings were ever so hard to do; and
when she thought of the time it must have taken Emmy, and the work
she had put into it...besides, she'd always believed he was fond of
the girl. And Papa said, Good God, so he was, but what had that to
do with "heart"? And Mamma said, well he might talk himself hoarse,
but she meant to hang the picture in the drawing-room, and Papa
said he forbade it...and then he'd run away so as not to hear any
more, but Luce didn't, and it was then she heard.</p>

<p>He hated Aunt Zara. Aunt Zara said, with them quarrelling as
they did, the house wasn't fit to live in. He went hot all over
when she said this. And that night he got a big pin and stuck it in
her bed with the point up, so it would run into her when she lay
down. And it must have; because she showed it to Mamma next day and
was <i>simply furious</i>. And he had to say yes he'd done it, and
on purpose. But he wouldn't say he was sorry, because he wasn't;
and he stopped naughty, and never did say it at all.</p>

<p>For then the Bishop came to stay, and every one was nice and
smiley again.</p>

<p>The Bishop was the same genial, courtly gentleman as of old.
Tactfulness itself, too: in the three days he was with them never,
by word or by look, did he show himself aware of their changed
circumstances. He admired house and garden, complimented Mary on
her cooking, and made much of the children. Especially Lucie. "I
shall steal this little maid before I'm finished, Mrs. Mahony. Pop
her in my pocket and take her home as a present to my wife!" And
the chicks were on their best behaviour&mdash;they had had it well
dinned into them beforehand not to comment on the Bishop's attire.
But even if it had been left to his own discretion, Cuffy would in
this case have held his tongue. For, truth to tell, he thought the
Bishop's costume just a <i>little rude</i>. To wear your legs as if
you were still a little boy, and then...to have something hanging
down in front. Mamma said it was an apron and all Bishops
did&mdash;even a "sufferin'" Bishop like this one. But
surely...surely...if you were a grown-up gentleman...Zara, too, did
her share. At table, what with looking after Maria and the dishes,
keeping one eye on the children, the other on the Bishop's plate,
Mary's own attention was fully occupied. Richard sat for the most
part in the silence that was now his normal state; he was, besides,
so out of things that he had little left to talk about. Hence it
fell to Zara, who was a fluent conversationalist and very well
read, to keep the ball rolling. The Bishop and she got on
splendidly (Zara had by now, of course, returned to the true fold.)
Afterwards, he was loud in her praises. "A very charming woman,
your sister, Mrs. Mahony...very charming, indeed!" And falling,
manlike, under the spell of the widow's cap, he added: "How bravely
she bears up, too. So sad, so <i>very</i> sad for her losing her
dear husband as she did. Still!...God's ways are not our ways. His
Will, not ours, be done!"</p>

<p>At which Mary winced. For he had used the self-same words about
their own great grief, had worn the same sympathetic face,
dispensed a like warm pressure of the hand. And this rankled. It
was true she did not parade her loss in yards of crepe. But that
any one who troubled to think could compare the two cases! A little
child, cut prematurely off, and Hempel, poor old Hempel, Zara's
<i>pis aller</i>, who had had one foot in the grave when she
married him, whom she had badgered and bullied to the end. But
these pious phrases evidently formed the Bishop's stock-in-trade,
which he dealt out indiscriminately to whoever suffered loss or
calamity. And now her mind jumped back to the afternoon of his
arrival, when after tea Richard and he had withdrawn to the
surgery. "A most delightful chat," he subsequently described the
hour spent in there; though she, listening at the door, knew that
Richard had hardly opened his mouth. At the time, she had thought
it most kind of the Bishop so to make the best of it. Now,
however...And when, later on, he returned from a visit to church
and parsonage, and still professed himself well content, she began
to see him with other eyes. It was not so much tact and civility on
his part, as a set determination not to scratch below the surface.
He didn't want to spoil his own comfort by being forced to see
things as they really were.</p>

<p>Of course this turn of mind made him the pleasantest of guests.
(Fancy, though, having to live perpetually in such a simmer of
satisfaction!) And even here his wilful blindness had its
drawbacks. Had he been different, the kind of man to say: "Your
husband is not looking very well," or: "Does Dr. Mahony find the
climate here try him?" or otherwise have given her an opening, she
might have plucked up courage to confide in him, to unburden
herself of some of her worries&mdash;oh! the relief it would have
been to speak freely to a person of their own class. As it was, he
no doubt firmly refused to let himself become aware of the
slightest change for the worse in Richard.</p>

<p>Well, at least her main object was achieved: if wanted, the
Bishop had to be sought and found at "Doctor's." She also so
contrived it that Richard and he were daily seen hobnobbing in
public. Each morning she started them off together for the
township: the short, thickset, animated figure, the tall, lean,
bent one.</p>

<p>And now the crown was to be set on her labours by a public
entertainment. First, a concert of local talent; after which his
Lordship had promised to give them a short address.</p>

<p>But at the very last minute, if Richard didn't threaten to undo
all her work! For, if he did not take the chair at this meeting,
she would have laboured in vain. Just to think of seeing that fool
Thistlethwaite in his place! Or old Cameron, who as likely as not
would be half-seas over.</p>

<p>But Richard was as obstinate as a mule. "I <i>can't</i>,
Mary,"&mdash;very peevishly&mdash;"and what's more, I won't! To be
stuck up there for all those yokels to gape at. For God's sake, let
me alone!"</p>

<p>She could cheerfully have boxed his ears. But she kept her
temper. "All you've got to do, dear, is to sit there...at most to
say half-a-dozen words to introduce his Lordship. You, who're such
a dab hand at that sort of thing!"&mdash;Until, by alternate
wheedling and bullying, she had him worn down.</p>

<p>But when the evening came she almost doubted her own wisdom. By
then he had worked himself up into a sheerly ridiculous state of
agitation: you might have thought he had to appear before the
Queen. His coat was too shabby, his collar was frayed; he couldn't
tie his cravat or get his studs in&mdash;she had everything to do
for him. She heard him, too, when he thought no one was listening,
feverishly rehearsing the reading which the Bishop, at a hint from
her, had duly persuaded him into giving. No, she very much feared
Richard's day for this kind of thing was over.</p>

<p>The hall at the "Sun" was packed. From a long way round, from
Brown's Plains and the Springs, farmers and vinegrowers had driven
in with their families: the street in front of the hotel was
blocked with buggies, with wagonettes, spring-cars, shandrydans and
drays. And the first part of the evening went off capitally. There
was quite a fund of musical talent in the place: the native-born
sons and daughters of tradesmen and publicans had many of them
clear, sweet voices, and sang with ease. It was not till the turn
came of the draperess, Miss Mundy, that the trouble
began&mdash;they hadn't ventured to leave her out, for she was one
of the main props of the church and head teacher in the Sunday
School. But she had no more voice than a peahen; and what there was
of it was not in tune. Then, though elderly and very scraggy, she
had dressed herself up to the nines. She sang <i>Comin' Thro' the
Rye</i> with what she meant to be a Scotch accent...said jin for
gin, boody for buddy...and smirked and sidled like a nancified
young girl. To the huge delight of the audience, who had her out
again and again, shouting "Brave-o!" and "Enkor!"</p>

<p>And the poor silly old thing drank it all in, bowed with her
hand on her heart, kissed the tips of her gloves&mdash;especially
in the direction of the Bishop&mdash;then fluttered the pages with
her lavender kids and prepared to repeat the song. This was too
much for Richard, who was as sensitive to seeing another person
made a butt of, as to being himself held up to ridicule. From his
seat in the front row he hissed, so loudly that everybody sitting
round could hear: "Go back, you fool, go back! Can't you see
they're laughing at you?"</p>

<p>It was done out of sheer tenderheartedness, but...For one thing,
the Bishop had entered into the fun and applauded with the rest; so
it was a sort of snub for him, too. As for Miss Mundy, though she
shut her music-book and retired into the wings, she glared at
Richard as if she could have eaten him; while the audience,
defrauded of its amusement, turned nasty, and started to boo and
groan. There was an awkward pause before the next item on the
programme could be got going. And when Richard's own turn
came&mdash;he was reading selections from <i>Out of the
Hurly-burly</i>&mdash;people weren't very well disposed towards
him. Which he needed. For he was shockingly nervous; you could see
the book shaking in his hands. Then, too, the light was poor, and
though he rubbed and polished at his spectacles and held the pages
up this way and that, he couldn't see properly, and kept reading
the wrong words and having to correct himself, or go
h'm...h'm...while he tried to decipher what came next. And through
his stumbling so, the jokes didn't carry. Nobody laughed; even
though he had picked out those excruciatingly funny bits about the
patent combination step-ladder and table, that performed high jinks
of itself in the attic at night; and the young man who stuck to the
verandah steps when he went a-courting: things that usually made
people hold their sides.</p>

<p>If only he would just say he couldn't see, and apologise and
leave off...or at least cut it short. But he was too proud for
that; besides, he wouldn't think it fair, to fail in his share of
the entertainment. And so he laboured on, stuttering and stumbling,
and succeeding only in making a donkey of himself. Suppressed
giggles were audible behind Mary: yes, people were laughing now,
but not at the funny stories. Of course at the finish, the audience
didn't dare not to clap; for the Bishop led the way; but the next
minute everybody broke out into a hullabaloo of laughing and
talking; in face of which the Bishop's "Most humorous! Quite a
treat!" sounded very thin.</p>

<p>The exertion had worn Richard out: you could see the
perspiration trickling down his face. The result was, having
immediately to get on his feet again to introduce the Bishop, he
clean forgot what he had been going to say. Nothing came. There was
another most embarrassing pause, in which her own throat went hot
and dry, while he stood clearing his and looking helplessly round.
But, once found, his words came with a rush&mdash;too much of a
rush: they tumbled over one another and got all mixed up: he
contradicted himself, couldn't find an end to his sentences, said
to-morrow when he meant to-day, and <i>visa versa</i>; which made
sad nonsense. The Bishop sat and picked his nose, or rather pinched
the outside edge of one nostril between thumb and middle finger,
looking, as far as a man of his nature could, decidedly
uncomfortable. Behind her, a rude voice muttered something about
somebody having had "one too many."</p>

<p>And things went from bad to worse; for Richard continued to
ramble on, long after the Bishop should have been speaking. There
was no one at hand to nudge him, or frown a hint. His subject had
of course something to do with it. For the Bishop had elected to
speak on "Our glorious country: Australia," and that was too much
for Richard. How could he sing a <i>te deum</i> to a land he so
hated? The very effort to be fair made him unnecessarily wordy, for
his real feelings kept cropping up and showing through. And then,
unluckily, just when one thought he had finished, the words
"glorious country" seized on his imagination; and now the fat was
in the fire with a vengeance. For he went on to say that any
country here, wonderful though it might be, was but the land of our
temporary adoption; the true "glorious country" was the one for
which we were bound hereafter: "That land of which our honoured
guest is one of the keepers of the keys." Until recently this
Paradise had been regarded as immeasurably distant...beyond earthly
contact. Now the barriers were breaking down.&mdash;"If you will
bear with me a little, friends, I will tell you something of my own
experiences, and of the proofs&mdash;the irrefragable
proofs&mdash;which I myself have received, that those dear ones who
have passed from mortal sight still live, and love us, and take an
interest in our doings."&mdash;And here if he didn't give
them...didn't come out in front of all these scoffing people, with
that foolish, ludicrous story of the doll...Lallie's doll! Mary
wished the floor would open and swallow her up.</p>

<p>The giggling and tittering grew in volume. ("Sit down, Richard,
oh, sit down!" she willed him. "<i>Can't</i> you see they're
laughing at you?") People could really hardly be blamed for
thinking he had had a glass too much; he standing there staring,
with visionary eyes, at the back of the hall. But by now he had
worked himself into such a state of exaltation that he saw
nothing...not even the Bishop's face, which was a study, his
Lordship belonging to those who held spiritualism to be of the
devil.</p>

<p>"Where's dolly?" "Want me mammy!" "Show us a nose!" began to be
heard on all sides. The audience was getting out of hand. The
Bishop could bear it no longer: rising from his seat he tapped
Richard sharply on the arm. Richard gave a kind of gasp, put his
hand to his forehead, and breaking off in the middle of a sentence
sat heavily down.</p>

<p>Straightway the Bishop plunged into his prepared discourse; and
in less than no time had his audience breathlessly engrossed, in
the splendid tale of Australia's progress.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-2-8" id="ch-3-2-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>Wept Mary, his Lordship's visit having ended in strain and
coolness: "How could you!...how <i>could</i> you? Knowing what he
thinks&mdash;and him a guest in the house! And then to hold our
poor little darling up to derision&mdash;for them to laugh and mock
at&mdash;oh! it was cruel of you...cruel. I shall never forget
it."</p>

<p>"Pray would you have me refuse, when the opportunity offers, to
bear witness to the faith that is in me? Who am I to shrink from
gibes and sneers? Where would Christianity itself be to-day, had
its early followers not braved scorn and contumely?"</p>

<p>"But <i>we're</i> not early Christians! We're just ordinary
people. And I think it's perfectly dreadful to hear you make such
comparisons. Talk about blasphemy..."</p>

<p>"It's always the same. Try to tell a man that he has a chance of
immortality...that he is not to be snuffed out at death like a
candle...and all that is brutal and ribald in him comes to the
surface."</p>

<p>"Leave it to the churches!...it's the churches' business. You
only succeed in making an utter fool of yourself."</p>

<p>Immortality...and a doll's nose! Oh, to see a man of Richard's
intelligence sunk so low! For fear of what she might say next, Mary
flung out of the room, leaving him still haranguing, and put the
length of the passage between them. At the verandah door she stood
staring with smouldering eyes into the garden. Telling herself
that, one day, it would not be the room only she quitted, but the
house as well. She saw a picture of herself, marching with defiant
head down the path and out of the gate, a child on either hand.
(Oh! the children went, too: she'd take good care of that.) Richard
should be left to the tender mercies of Zara: Zara who, at first
sound of a raised voice, vanished behind a locked door. That might
bring him to his senses. For things could not go on as they were.
Never a plan did she lay for his benefit but he somehow crossed and
frustrated it. And as a result of her last effort, they were
actually in a worse position than before. Not only was the practice
as dead as a doornail again, but a new load of contempt rested on
Richard's shoulders.</p>

<p>The first hint that something more than his spiritistic rantings
might be at work, in frightening people off, came from Maria. It
was a couple of weeks later. Mary was in the kitchen making pastry,
dabbing blobs of lard over a rolled-out sheet of paste, and tossing
and twisting with a practised hand, when Maria, who stood slicing
apples, having cast more than one furtive glance at her mistress,
volunteered the remark: "Mrs. Mahony, you know that feller with the
broke leg? Well, they do say his Pa's bin and fetched another
doctor, orl the way from Oakworth."</p>

<p>"What boy? Young Nankivell? Nonsense! He's out of splints by
now."</p>

<p>"Mike Murphy told the grocer so."</p>

<p>"Now, Maria, you know I won't listen to gossip. Make haste with
the fruit for this pie."</p>

<p>But it was not so easy to get the girl's words out of her head.
Could there possibly be any truth in them? And if so, did Richard
know? He wouldn't say a word to her, of course, unless his hand was
forced.</p>

<p>At dinner she eyed him closely; but could detect no sign of a
fresh discomfiture.</p>

<p>That afternoon, though, as she sat stitching at warm
clothing&mdash;with the end of March the rains had set in, bringing
cooler weather&mdash;as she sat, there came a knock at the front
door, and Maria admitted what really seemed to be a patient again
at last, a man asking imperiously for the doctor. He was shown into
the surgery, and even above the whirring of her sewing-machine Mary
could hear his voice&mdash;and Richard's, too&mdash;raised as if in
dispute, and growing more and more heated. She went into the
passage and listened, holding her breath. Then&mdash;oh! what was
that?...who?...what?...<i>a horse-whipping?</i> Without hesitation
she turned the knob of the surgery door and walked in.</p>

<p>"What is it? What's the matter?" With fearful eyes she looked
from one to the other. In very fact the stranger, a great
red-faced, burly fellow, held a riding-whip stretched between his
hands.</p>

<p>And Richard was cowering in his chair, his grey head sunk
between his shoulders. Richard...<i>cowering?</i> In an instant she
was beside him, her arm about his neck. "Don't mind him!...don't
take any notice of what he says."</p>

<p>Roughly Mahony shook himself free. "Go away...go out of the
room, Mary. This is none of your business."</p>

<p>"And have him speak to you like that? I'll do nothing of the
sort. Why don't you turn him out?" And as Richard did not answer,
and her blood was up, she rounded on the man with: "How dare you
come here and insult the doctor in his own house? You great bully,
you!"</p>

<p>"<i>Mary!</i>&mdash;for God's sake!...don't make more trouble
for me than I've got already."</p>

<p>"Now, now, madam, I'll trouble you to have a care what you're
saying!" &mdash;and the network of veins on the speaker's cheeks
ran together in a purplish patch. "None of your lip for me, if you
please! As for insults, me good lady, you'll have something more to
hear about the rights o' that. You've got a boy of your own,
haven't you? What would you say, I'd like to know, if a bloody
fraud calling himself a doctor had been and made a cripple of him
for life?"</p>

<p>(<i>That</i> hit. Cuffy?...a cripple? Oh, Richard, Richard, what
<i>have</i> you done?)</p>

<p>"As fine a young chap as ever you see, tall and upstanding. And
now 'tis said he'll never walk straight again, but'll have to
hobble on crutches, with one leg four inches shorter than the
other, for the rest of his days.&mdash;But I'll settle you! I'll
cork your chances for you! I'll put a stop to your going round
maiming other people's children. I'll have the lor on you, that's
what I'll do. I'll take it into court, by Jesus I will!"</p>

<p>"You'll ruin me."</p>

<p>"I'll never stop till I have...so help me, God!...as you've
ruined me boy. You won't get the chance to butcher no one
else&mdash;you damned, drunken old swine, you!"</p>

<p>Richard sat motionless, head in hand, and the two fingers that
supported his temple, and the skin on which they lay, looked as
though drained of every drop of blood. But he said not a
word&mdash;let even the last infamous accusation pass unchallenged.
Not so Mary. With eyes so fierce that the man involuntarily
recoiled before them, she advanced upon him. "How dare you?...how
<i>dare</i> you say a thing like that to my husband? You!...with a
face which shows everybody what your habits are...to slander some
one who's never in his life been the worse for drink? Go
away...we've had enough of you...go away, I say!"&mdash;and
throwing open the door she drove him before her.&mdash;But on the
garden path he turned and shook his fist at the house.</p>

<p>Richard had not stirred; nor did he look up at her entry. And to
her flood of passionate and bewildered questions, he responded only
by a toneless: "It's no use, Mary; what he says may be true. A case
of malunion. Such things do happen. And surgery has never been one
of my strong points." Try as she would, there was nothing more to
be got out of him.</p>

<p>In despair she left him, and went to the bedroom. Her brain was
spinning like a Catherine wheel. Yet something must be done. They
could not&mdash;oh, they <i>could</i> not!&mdash;sit meekly there,
waiting for this new and awful blow to fall. She must go out, track
the man, follow him up; and snatching her bonnet from the drawer
she tied it on&mdash;it had a red rose on a stalk, which nodded at
her from the mirror. She would go on her knees to him not to take
proceedings. He had a wife. <i>She</i> might understand...being a
woman, be merciful. But...Cuffy...a cripple...would <i>she</i> have
had mercy? What would <i>her</i> feelings have been, had she had to
see her own child go halt and lame? No, Richard was right, it was
no good: there was nothing to be done. And tearing off her wraps
she threw herself face downwards on the bed, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>She did not hear the door open, or see the small face that
peered in. And a single glimpse of the dark mass that was his
mother, lying shaking and sobbing, was enough for Cuffy: he turned
and fled. Frightened by the angry voices, the children had sought
their usual refuge up by the henhouse. But it got night, and nobody
came to call them or look for them, and nobody lit the lamps; and
when they did come home the table wasn't spread for supper. Cuffy
set to hunting for Mamma. But after his discovery his one desire
was not to see anything else. In the dark drawing-room, he hid
behind an armchair. Oh, <i>what</i> was the matter now? What
<i>had</i> they done to her? It could only be Papa that hurt her
so. <i>Why</i> did he have to do it? Why couldn't he be nice to
her? Oh, If only Papa&mdash;yes, if...if only Papa <i>would</i> go
away, as he said, and leave them and Mamma together! Oh, pray God,
let Papa go away!...and never, never come back.</p>

<p>But that night&mdash;after a sheerly destructive evening, in
which Mary had never ceased to plead with, to throw herself on the
mercy of, an invisible opponent: I give you my word for it, he
wasn't himself that day...what with the awful heat...and the length
of the drive...and the horse wouldn't go...he was so upset over it.
And then the loss of our little girl...that was a blow he has never
properly got over. For he's not a young man any more. He's not what
he was...<i>anyone</i> will tell you that! But they'll tell you,
too, that he has never, never neglected a patient because of it.
He's the most conscientious of men...has always worked to the last
ounce of his strength, put himself and the state of his own health
last of all...I have known him tramp off of a morning when anybody
with half an eye could see that he ought to be in bed. And so
kindhearted! If a patient is poor, or has fallen on evil days, he
will always treat him free of charge. Oh, surely people would need
to have hearts of stone, to stand out against pleas such as
these?&mdash;Or she lived through, to the last detail, the horrors
of a lawsuit: other doctors giving evidence against Richard,
hundreds of pounds having to be paid as damages, the final crash to
ruin of his career. And when it came to the heritage of shame and
disgrace that he would thus hand on to his children, her heart
turned cold as ice against him. But that night every warring
feeling merged and melted in a burning compassion for the old,
unhappy man who lay at her side; lay alarmingly still, staring with
glassy eyes at the moonlit window. Feeling for his hand she pressed
it to her cheek. "Don't break your heart over it, my darling. Trust
me, I'll win him round...<i>somehow!</i> And then we'll go
away&mdash;far away from here&mdash;and start all over again. No
one need ever know."</p>

<p>But she could not get at him, could not rouse him from the
torpor in which this last, unmerited misfortune had sunk him. And
there they lay, side by side, hand in hand, but far as the poles
apart.</p>

<p>The court, airless and fetid, was crowded to the last place.
With difficulty he squeezed into a seat on a hard, backless
bench...though he was too old and stiff nowadays to sit for long
without a support. The judge&mdash;why, what was this? He knew that
face...had surely met him somewhere?...had dined with him perhaps,
or tilted a table in his company&mdash;the judge held a large gold
toothpick in his hand, and in the course of the proceedings must
have picked in turn every tooth he had in his head. Foul teeth...a
foul breath...out of such a mouth should judgment come? He felt in
his pocket to see if, in a species of prevision, he had brought his
forceps with him; and sharply withdrew his hand from a mess of
melting jujubes. (The children of course...oh, devil take those
children! They were always in his way.) Believing himself unseen,
he stealthily deposited the sticky conglomerate on the floor. But
his neighbour, a brawny digger, with sleeves rolled high above the
elbow and arms behaired like an ape's, espied him, and made as if
to call the attention of the usher to his misdeed. To escape
detection he rose and moved hurriedly to the other side of the
court; where, oddly enough, there seemed after all to be plenty of
room.</p>

<p>Here he was seated to much better advantage; and pulling himself
together, prepared to follow the case. But...again he was baffled.
Plaintiff's counsel was on his feet; and once more the striking
likeness of the fellow to somebody he had known distracted him.
Hang it all! It began to look as if every one present was more or
less familiar to him. Secretly he ran his eye over the assembly,
and found that it was so...though he could not have put a name to a
single manjack of them. However, since nobody seemed to recognise
him, he cowered down and trusted to pass unobserved. But, from now
on, he was aware of a sense of mystery and foreboding; the court
and its occupants took on a sinister aspect. And even as he felt
this, he heard two rascally-looking men behind him muttering
together. "Are you all right?" said one. To which the other made
half-audible reply: "We are, if that bloody fool, our
client&mdash;" Ha! there was shady work in hand; trouble brewing
for somebody. But what was <i>he</i> doing here? What had brought
him to such a place?</p>

<p>Wild to solve the riddle, he made another desperate attempt to
fix his thoughts. But these haunting resemblances had unnerved him;
he could do nothing but worry the question where he had met
plaintiff's counsel. The name hung on the very tip of his tongue;
yet would not out. A common, shoddy little man, prematurely bald,
with a protruding paunch and a specious eye&mdash;he wouldn't have
trusted a fellow with an eye like that farther than he could see
him. Most improperly dressed, too; wearing neither wig nor gown,
but a suit of a loud, horsey check, the squares of which could have
been counted from across a road.</p>

<p>This get-up it was, which first made it plain to him that the
case under trial had some secret connection with himself. Somehow
or other he was involved. But each time, just as he thought he was
nearing a due, down would come a kind of fog and blot everything
out.</p>

<p>Through it, he heard what sounded like a scuffle going on. It
seemed that the plaintiff was drunk, not in a fit state to give
evidence...though surely that was his voice protesting vehemently
that he had never been the worse for drink in his life? The two
cut-throats in the back seat muttered anew; others joined in; and
soon the noise from these innumerable throats had risen to an
ominous roar. He found himself shouting with the rest; though only
later did he grasp what it was all about: they were calling for the
defendant to enter the witness-box. Well, so much the better! Now
at last, he would discover the hidden meaning.</p>

<p>The defendant proved to be an oldish man, with straggly grey
hair and whiskers, and a round back: he clambered up the steps to
the witness-box, which stood high, like a pulpit, with a palpable
effort. This bent back was all that could be seen of him at first,
and a very humble back it looked, threadbare and shiny, though
brushed meticulously free of dust and dandruff. Surely to goodness,
though, he needn't have worn his oldest suit, the one with the
frayed cuffs?...his second-best would have been more the
thing...even though the coat did sag at the shoulders. Edging
forward in his seat he craned his neck; then half rose, in his
determination to see the fellow's face&mdash;and, having caught a
single glimpse of it, all but lost his balance and fell, with
difficulty restraining a shriek that would have pealed like the
whistle of a railway-engine through the court, and have given him
away...beyond repair. For it was himself he saw, himself who stood
there perched aloft before every eye, holding fast, with veined and
wrinkled hands, to the ledge of the dock: himself who now suddenly
turned and looked full at him, singling him out from all the rest.
His flesh crawled, his hairs separated, while something cold and
rapid as a ball of quicksilver ran from top to bottom of his
spine.&mdash;Two of him? God in heaven! But this was madness.
<i>Two</i> of him? The thing was an infamy...devilish...not to be
borne. <i>Which was he?</i></p>

<p>And yet, coeval with the horror of it, ran an obscene curiosity.
So <i>this</i> was what he looked like! <i>This</i> was how he
presented himself to his fellow-men. Smothering his first wild
fear, he took in, coldly and cruelly, every detail of the
perched-up figure, whose poverty-stricken yet sorrily dandified
appearance had been the signal for a burst of ribald mirth. He
could hear himself laughing at the top of his lungs; especially
when, after a painful effort to read a written slip that had been
handed to him, his double produced a pair of horn-rimmed
spectacles, and shakily balanced them on the tip of his long thin
nose. Ha, ha! This was good...was very good. Ha, ha! A regular
owl!...exactly like an old owl. A zany. A figure of fun.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, his laughter died in his throat. For
hark!...what was this?...what the...! God above! he was pleading
now&mdash;<i>pleading?</i> nay, grovelling!&mdash;begging abjectly
for mercy. He whined "Me Lud, if the case goes against me I'm a
ruined man. And he has got his knife in me, me Lud!...he's made up
his mind to ruin me. A hard man...a cruel man!...if ever there was
one. Oh, spare me, me Lud!...have pity on my poor wife and my two
little children!" The blood surged to his head, and roared in neck
and temples till he thought they would burst. <i>Never!</i>...no,
never in all his days had he sought either pity or mercy. And
never, no matter what his plight, would he sink so low. The
despicable sniveller! The unmanly craven!...he disowned
him&mdash;loathed him&mdash;spat at him in spirit: his whole being
swam in hatred. But even as, pale with fury, he joined in the
hyaena-like howl against clemency that was raised, a small voice
whispered in his ear that his time was running short. He must get
out of this place...must escape...save himself...from the wrath to
come. Be up and away, head high, leaving his ghost to wring its
hands...and wail...and implore. Long since he had lifted his hat to
his face, where he held it as if murmuring a prayer. But it was no
longer the broad-brimmed wideawake he had brought with him into
court; it had turned into a tall beaver belltopper, of a mode at
least twenty years old, and too narrow to conceal his face. He
tossed it from him as, frantic with the one desire, he pushed and
struggled to get out, treading on people's feet, crushing past
their knees&mdash;oh! was there no end to their number, or to the
rows of seats through which he had to fight his way?...his legs
growing heavier and heavier, more incapable of motion. And
then...just when he thought he was safe...he heard his own name
spoken: heard it said aloud, not once but many times, and,
damnation take it! by none other than old Muir the laryngologist,
that pitiful old fossil, that infernal old busybody, dead long
since, who it seemed had been in court throughout the proceedings
and now recognised him, and stood pointing at him. Again a shout
rose in unison, but this time it was his name they called, and
therewith they were up and on his heels, and the hue and cry had
begun in earnest. He fled down Little Bourke Street, and round and
up Little Collins Street, running like a hare, but with steadily
failing strength, drawing sobbing breaths that hurt like blows; but
holding his left hand fast to his breast-pocket, where he had the
knife concealed. His ears rang with that most terrifying of mortal
sounds: the wolf-like howl of a mob that chases human game and sees
its prey escaping it. For he was escaping; he would have got clean
away if, of a sudden, Mary and the children had not stood before
him. In a row...a third child, too. He out with his
knife...<i>now</i> he knew what it was for! But a shrill scream
stayed his hand...who screamed? who screamed?...and with such
stridency. Mary...it could <i>only</i> be Mary who would so
deliberately foul his chances. For this one second's delay was his
undoing. Some one dashed up behind and got him by the shoulder, and
was bearing his down, and shaking, shaking, shaking...while a
fierce voice shrieked in his ear: "Richard!...oh, <i>Richard</i>,
do wake up! You'll terrify the children. Oh, what dreadful dream
have you been having?"</p>

<p>And it was broad daylight, the mill-whistle in full blast, and
he sitting up in bed shouting, and drenched in sweat. The night was
over, a new day begun, in which had to be faced, not the lurid
phantasmagoria of a dream-world that faded at a touch, but the
stern, bare horrors of reality, from which there was no
awakening.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-2-9" id="ch-3-2-9"></a>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>The facts of the case, brought to light by vigorous action on
Mary's part, were these. The boy had been removed to the Oakworth
hospital, where he was to be examined. Only when this was done
could the surgeon in charge say whether there was any possibility
of correcting the malunion, by re-breaking and re-setting the limb;
or whether the patient would have to remain in his present degree
of shortness. He hoped to let them know in about three days' time.
It might, of course, be less.</p>

<p>"There's nothing for it; we must have patience," said Mary
grimly and with determination, as she re-folded the telegram and
laid it back on the table.</p>

<p>Patience? Yes, yes; that went without saying; and Mahony
continued to feign busyness with pencil and paper till the door had
shut behind her.</p>

<p>Alone, he fell limply back in his chair. So this was it...this
was what it had come to! His fate had passed out of his own
keeping. Another&mdash;a man his junior by several
years&mdash;would sit in judgment on him, decide whether or no he
was competent to continue practising the profession to which he had
given up the best years of his life. In the course of the next
three days.&mdash;Three days. What <i>were</i> three days?...in a
lifetime of fifty years. A flea-bite; a single tick of time's
clock. An infinitesimal fragment chipped off time's plenty, and for
the most part squandered unthinkingly. In the ecstasy of
happiness&mdash;or to the prisoner condemned to mount the
scaffold&mdash;a breath, a flash of light, gone even as it
came.&mdash;<i>three days</i>! To one on the rack to learn whether
or no he was to be found guilty of professional negligence, with
its concomitants of a court of law, publicity, disgrace; to such a
one, three days were as unthinkable as infinity: a chain of hours
of torture, each a lifetime in itself.</p>

<p>For long he sat motionless, wooden as the furniture around him;
sat and stared at the whitewashed walls till he felt that, if he
did not get out from between them, they might end by closing in on
him and crushing him. Pushing back his chair he rose and left the
house, heading in the direction of the railway station: never again
would he cross the Lagoon path to show his face in the township.
From the station he struck off on a bush track. This was heavy with
mud; for it had rained in torrents towards morning: the hammering
of the downpour on the iron roof no doubt accounted for some of the
sinister noises of which his dream had been full. Now, the day was
fine: a cool breeze swung the drooping leaves; the cloudless sky
had deepened to its rich winter blue. But to him the very freshness
and beauty of the morning seemed a mockery, the blue sky cruel as a
pall. For there was a blackness under his lids, which gave the lie
to all he saw.</p>

<p>He trudged on, with the sole idea of somehow getting through the
day...of killing time. And as he went he mused ironically, on the
shifts mortals were put to, the ruses they employed, to rid
themselves of this precious commodity, which alone stood between
them and an open grave.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, he stopped, and uttering an exclamation swung
round and made for home. <i>It might, of course, be less</i>. Who
knew, who knew? By this time it was just possible that another
telegram had arrived, and that he was tormenting himself
needlessly. Was he not omitting to allow for the fellow-feeling of
a brother medico, who, suspecting something of what he was
enduring, might hasten to put him out of suspense? (How his own
heart would have bled for such a one!) And so he pushed forward,
covering the way back in half the time, and only dropping his speed
as he neared the gate. For the children sat at lessons in the
dining-room, and three pairs of eyes looked up on his approach. At
the front door he paused to dry his forehead, before stepping into
the passage where the life-giving message might await him. But the
tray on the hall-table was empty; empty, too, the table in the
surgery. His heart, which had been palpitating wildly, sank to
normal; and simultaneously an immense lassitude overcame him. But
without a moment's hesitation he turned on his heel and went out
again...with stealthy, cat-like tread. The last thing he wanted to
do was to attract Mary's attention.</p>

<p>He retraced his steps. But now so tired was he that every
hundred yards or so he found himself obliged to sit down, in order
to get strength to proceed. But not for long: there was a demon in
him that would not let him rest; which drove him up and on till, in
the end, he was seized and spun by a fit of the old vertigo, and
had to throw his arms round a tree-trunk to keep from falling.
"Drunk again!...drunk again."</p>

<p>He was done for...played out. Home he dragged once more, sitting
by the wayside when the giddy fits took him, or holding fast to the
palings of a fence. It was one o'clock and dinner-time when he
reached the house. Well! in any case, he would not have dared to
absent himself from the table. (Oh God, on such a day to have been
free and unobserved!)</p>

<p>But he had over-rated his powers of endurance. The children's
prating, Mary's worried glances in his direction, the clatter of
the dishes, Zara's megrims: all this, the ordinary humdrum of a
meal, proved more than his sick nerves could bear. His usual weary
boredom with the ritual of eating turned to loathing: of every word
that was said, every movement of fork to mouth, of the very
crockery on the table. Half-way through, he tossed his napkin from
him, pushed his chair back, and broke from the room.</p>

<p>To go out again was beyond him. Entering the surgery, he took
his courage in both hands; and, not with his nerves alone, but with
every muscle at a strain, braced himself to meet the slow torture
that awaited him, the refined torture of physical inaction; the
trail of which may be as surely blood-streaked as that from an open
wound. With his brain on fire, his body bound to the rack, he sat
and watched the hands of the clock crawl from one to two, from two
to three and three to four; and the ticking of the pendulum, and
the beat of his own pulses, combined to form a rhythm&mdash;a
conflicting rhythm&mdash;which well-nigh drove him crazy. As the
afternoon advanced, however, there came moments when, with his head
bedded on his arms, he lapsed into a kind of coma; never so deeply
though, but what his mind leapt into awareness at the smallest
sound without. And all through, whether he waked or slept,
something in him, inarticulate as a banshee, never ceased to weep
and lament...to wail without words, weep without tears.</p>

<p>Later on, a new torture threatened; and this was the coming
blast of the mill-whistle. For a full hour beforehand he sat
anticipating it: sat with fingers stiffly interlocked, temples
a-hammer, waiting for the moment when it should set in. Nor was
this all. As the minute-hand ticked the last hour away, stark
terror seized him lest, when the screech began, he, too, should not
be able to help shrieking; but should be forced to let out, along
with it, in one harsh and piercing cry, the repressed, abominable
agony of the afternoon. At two minutes to the hour he was on his
feet, going round the table like a maddened animal, wringing his
hands and moaning under his breath: it is too much...I am not
strong enough...my God, I implore Thee, let this cup pass! And now,
so sick and dazed with fear was he, that he could no longer
distinguish between the murderous din that was about to break
loose, and the catastrophe that had befallen his life. When,
finally, the hour struck, the whistle discharged, and the air was
all one brazen clamour, he broke down and wept, the tears dripping
off his face. But no sound escaped him.</p>

<p>Supper time.&mdash;He wanted none; was not hungry; asked only to
be left in peace. And since Mary, desperate, too, after her own
fashion, could not make up her mind to this, but came again and yet
again, bringing the lamp, bringing food to tempt him, he savagely
turned the key in the lock.</p>

<p>Thereafter, all was still: the quiet of night descended on the
house. Here, in this blissful silence, he took his decision. Numbed
to the heart though he was&mdash;over the shrilling of the siren
something in him had cracked, had broken&mdash;he knew what he had
to do. Another day like this, and he would not be answerable for
himself. There was an end to everything...and his end had come.</p>

<p>Mary, stealing back to remind him that it was close on midnight,
found him stooped over a tableful of books and papers. "Don't wait
for me. I'm busy...shall be some time yet."</p>

<p>Relieved beyond the telling to find his door no longer shut
against her, and him thus normally employed, she put her arm round
his shoulders and laid her head against his. "But not too late,
Richard. You must be so tired." Herself she felt sick and dizzy
with anxiety, with fatigue. It was not only what had happened, but
the way Richard was taking it...his secrecy...his morbid
self-communing. God help him!...help them all.</p>

<p>Desperately Mahony fought down the impulse to throw off her
hampering arm, to cry out, to her face, the truth: go away...go
away! I have done with you! And no sooner had the bedroom door shut
behind her than he brushed aside his brazen pretence at
work&mdash;it would have deceived no one but Mary&mdash;and fell to
making the few necessary preparations. Chief of these was the
detaching of a couple of keys from his bunch of keys, and laying
them in a conspicuous place. After which he sat and waited, for
what he thought a reasonable time, cold as a stone with fear lest
she, somehow sensing his intention, should come back to hinder him.
But nothing happened; and cautiously unlatching the door, he
listened out into the passage. Not a mouse stirred. Now was the
time! Opening the French window he stepped on to the verandah. But
it had begun to rain again; a soft, steady rain; and some obscure
instinct drove him back to get his greatcoat. This hung in the
passage; and had to be fetched in jerks&mdash;a series of jerks and
pauses. But at last he had it, and could creep up the yard and out
of the back gate.</p>

<p>His idea was, to get as far from the house as possible...perhaps
even to follow the bush track he had been on that morning. (That
morning only? It seemed more like a century ago.) But the night was
pitch dark: more than once he caught his foot, tripped and
stumbled. So, groping his way along outside the palings of the
fence, and the fence of the mill yard, he skirted these, and
doubled back on the Lagoon. To the right of the pond stood a clump
of fir-trees, shading the ruins of what had once been an arbour. It
was for these trees he made: an instinctive urge for shelter again
carrying the day.</p>

<p>Arrived there, he flung himself at full length on the wet and
slimy ground. (No need now, to take thought for tic or rheumatism,
or the other bodily ills that had plagued him.) And for a time he
did no more than lie and exult in the relief this knowledge brought
him&mdash;this sense of freedom from all things human. <i>Fear no
more the heat of the sun</i>, nor the strangle-coils in which money
and money-making had wound him, nor Mary's inroads on his life, nor
the deadening responsibilities of fatherhood. Now, at long last, he
was answerable to himself alone.</p>

<p>But gradually this feeling died away, and an extraordinary
lucidity took its place. And in his new clearness of vision he saw
that his bloodiest struggle that day had been, not with the thing
itself, but with what hid it from him. Which was Time. He had set
up Time as his bugbear, made of it an implacable foe, solely to
hinder his mind from reaching out to what lay beyond. That, he
could not face and live. He saw it now, and was dying of it: dying
of a mortal wound to the most vital part of him&mdash;his
pride...his black Irish pride. That he, who had held himself so
fastidiously aloof from men, should be forced down into the
market-place, there to suffer an intolerable notoriety; to know his
name on people's lips...see it dragged through the mud of the daily
press...himself branded as a bungler, a botcher! God! no: the mere
imagining of it nauseated him. Dead, infinitely better dead, and
out of it all! Life and its savagery put off, like a garment that
had served its turn. Then, let tongues wag as they might, he would
not be there to hear. In comparison, his death by his own hand
would make small stir. A day's excitement, and he would pass for
ever into limbo; take his place among those pale ghosts of whose
earth-life every trace is lost. None would miss him, or mourn his
passing&mdash;thanks to his own <i>noli me tangere</i> attitude
towards the rest of mankind. For there had been no real love in
him: never a feeler thrown out to his fellow-men. Such sympathy as
he felt, he had been too backward to show: had given of it only in
thought, and from afar. Pride, again!&mdash;oh! rightly was a pride
like his reckoned among the seven capital sins. For what <i>was</i>
it, but an iron determination to live untouched and
untrammelled...to preserve one's liberty, of body and of mind, at
the expense of all human sentiment. To be sufficient unto oneself,
asking neither help nor regard, and spending none. A fierce,
Lucifer-like inhibition. Yes, this...but more besides. Pride also
meant the shuddering withdrawal of oneself, because of a
rawness...a skinlessness...on which the touch of any rough hand
could cause agony; even the chance contacts of everyday prove a
source of exquisite discomfort.</p>

<p>Thus he dug into himself. To those, on the contrary, whose
welfare had till now been his main solicitude, he gave not a
thought. For this was <i>his</i> hour; the hour between himself and
his God: the end of the old life, the dawn, so he surely believed,
of the new. And now that release was in sight&mdash;port and haven
made, after the desolate, windswept seas&mdash;he marvelled at
himself for having held out so long. At the best of times small joy
had been his: while for many a year never a blink of hope or
gladness had come his way. Weary and unslept, he had risen, day
after day, to take up the struggle; the sole object of which was
the grinding for bread. The goal of a savage: to one of his turn of
mind, degradation unspeakable. A battle, too, with never a
respite&mdash;interminable as time itself. (Why, the most famous
Agony known to history had lasted but for three hours, and a sure
Paradise awaited the great Martyr.) Even the common soldier knew
that the hotter the skirmish, the sooner it would be over, with,
did he escape with his life, stripes and glory for a finish. Ah!
but with this difference, that the soldier was under duress to
fight to the end: for those who flung down their muskets and ran,
crying, hold! enough! the world had coined an evil name. And at
this thought, and without warning, such a red-hot doubt transfixed
him, such a blazing host of doubts, that he fell to writhing, like
one in the grip of insufferable physical anguish. These doubts
brought confusion on every argument that he had used to bolster up
his deed. What was he doing?...what was he about to do? He, a
coward?...a deserter?...abandoning his post when the fire was
hottest?&mdash;leaving others to bear the onus of his flight, his
disgrace?...and those others the creatures he had loved best? Oh,
where was here his pride!</p>

<p>Besides: no Lethe awaits me, but the judgment seat. How shall I
face my Maker?&mdash;The phrasing was that of his day; the question
at issue one with which men have tortured themselves since the
world began. Have I the right to do this thing? Is my life my own
to take?&mdash;And in the fierce conflict of which he now tossed
the helpless prey, he dug his left hand into the earth until what
it grasped was a compact mass of mud and gravel. (His right,
containing the precious phial, was under him, held to his breast.)
Only little by little, with pangs unspeakable, did the death-throes
of his crucified pride cease, and he emerge from the struggle,
spent and beaten, but seeing himself at last in his true colours.
Too good...too proud to live? Then, let him also be too proud to
die: in this ignominious fashion...this poltroon attempt to sneak
out of life by a back door. Should it be said of him, who had
watched by so many a deathbed, seen the humblest mortals rise
superior to physical suffering, that, when his own turn came, he
was too weak to endure?&mdash;solely because the torments he was
called on to face were not of the body but the mind?
Pain...anguish...of body or of mind...individual pain...the pangs
of all humanity. Pain, a state of being so interwoven with
existence that, without it, life was unthinkable. For, take
suffering from life, and what remained? Surely, surely, what was so
integral a part of creation could not spring from blind
chance?...be wholly evil?...without value in the scheme of things?
A test!&mdash;God's acid test...failing to pass which, a man might
not attain to his full stature. And if this were so, what was
<i>he</i> doing to brush the cup from his lips, to turn his back on
the chance here offered him? But oh! abhorrent to him was the pious
Christian's self-abasement: the folded hands, the downcast eyes,
the meek "God wills it!" that all too often cloaked a bitter and
resentful spirit. Not thus, not thus! God would not be God, did He
demand of men grovelling and humiliation. Not the denial of self
was called for, but the affirmation: a proud joy (here, surely, was
the bone for his own pride to gnaw at?) at being permitted to aid
and abet in the great Work, at coupling, in full awareness, our
will with His. So, then, let it be! And with a movement so
precipitate that it seemed after all more than half involuntary, he
lifted his hand and threw far from him the little bottle of
chloroform, which he had clutched till his palm was cut and sore.
It was gone: was lost, hopelessly lost, in rain and darkness. He
might have groped till morning without finding it.</p>

<p>But such a thought did not cross his mind. For now a strange
thing happened. In the moment of casting the poison from him, he
became aware &mdash;but with a sense other than that of sight, for
he was lying face downwards, with fast closed eyes, his forehead
bedded on the sleeve of his greatcoat&mdash;became suddenly aware
of the breaking over him of a great light: he was lying, he found
in a pool of light; a radiance thick as milk, unearthly as
moonlight. And this suffused him, penetrated him, lapped him round.
He breathed it in, drew deep breaths of it; and, as he did so, the
last vestiges of his old self seemed to fall away. All sense of
injury, of mortification, of futile sacrifice was wiped out. In its
place there ran through him the beatific certainty that his pain,
his sufferings&mdash;and how infinitesimal these were, he now saw
for the first time&mdash;had their niche in God's Scheme (pain the
bond that linked humanity: not in joy, in sorrow alone were we
yoke-fellows)&mdash;that all creation, down to the frailest
protoplasmic thread, was one with God; and he himself, and
everything he had been and would ever be, as surely contained in
God, as a drop of water in a wave, a note of music in a mighty
cadence. More: he now yearned as avidly for this submergedness,
this union of all things living, as he had hitherto shrunk from it.
The mere thought of separation became intolerable to him: his soul,
ascending, sang towards oneness as a lark sings its way upwards to
the outer air. For, while the light lasted, he <i>understood:</i>
not through any feat of conscious perception, but as a
state&mdash;a state of being&mdash;a white ecstasy, that left mere
knowledge far behind. The import of existence, the mysteries hid
from mortal eyes, the key to the Ultimate Plan: all now were his.
And, rapt out of himself, serene beyond imagining, he touched the
hem of peace at last...eternal peace...which passeth
understanding.</p>

<p>Then, as suddenly as the light had broken over him, it was gone,
and again night wrapped him heavily round; him, by reason of the
miracle he had experienced, doubly dark, doubly destitute. (But I
have <i>known...nothing</i> can take it from me!) And he had need
of this solace to cling to, for his awakening found his brain of an
icy clearness, in which no jot or tittle of what awaited him was
veiled from him. As if to test him to the utmost, even the hideous
spectre of his blackest nights took visible form, and persisted,
till, for the first time, he dared to look it in the
face.&mdash;And death seemed a trifle in comparison.</p>

<p>But he struggled no more. Caked in mud, soaked to the skin, he
climbed to his feet and staggered home.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>What a funny noise!...lots of noises...people all talking at
once; and ever so loud. Cuffy sat up, rubbing his eyes, for there
were lights in them. Stars...no, <i>lanterns!</i> Huh!
<i>Chinese</i> latterns? But it wasn't Christmas! He jumped out of
bed and ran to the door, opened it and looked out; and it was two
strange men with lanterns walking up and down the passage and round
the verandah. And Mamma was there as well, in her red dressing-gown
with the black spots on it, and her hair done for going to bed, and
she was crying, and Aunt Zara (oh! she <i>did</i> look funny when
she went to bed) was blowing her nose and talking to the men. And
when she saw him, she was most awfully angry and said: "Go back to
bed at once, you naughty boy!" And Mamma said: "Be good,
Cuffy...for I can bear no more." And so he only just peeped out, to
see what it was. And it was Papa that was lost. <i>papa...lost?</i>
(How <i>could</i> grown-up people be lost?) in the middle of the
night...it was dark as dark...and he might never come back. Oh no!
it couldn't be true. Only to think of it made him make such a funny
noise in his throat that Luce woke up, and wanted to know, and
cried and said: "Oh dear Papa, come back!" and was ever so
frightened. And they both stopped out of bed and sat on the floor
and listened. And the men with the lanterns&mdash;it was the
sergeant and the constable&mdash;went away with them, and you could
only hear Mamma and Aunt Zara talking and crying. And he waited
till it seemed nearly all night, and his toes were so cold he
didn't feel them. Luce went to sleep again, but he couldn't. And
all the time his heart thumped like a drum.</p>

<p>Then he thought he saw a monkey in a wood, and was trying to
catch it, when somebody shouted like anything; and first it was
Maria on the verandah, and then Aunt Zara in the passage, and she
called out: "It's all right, Mary! They've got him...he's coming!"
And then Mamma came running out and cried again, and kept on
saying: "I must be brave...I must be brave." And then one's heart
almost jumped itself dead, for there was Papa, and he couldn't
walk, and the police were holding him up, and he had no hat on, and
was wet, the water all running out of him, and so muddy, the mud
sticking all over his greatcoat and in his face and hair&mdash;just
like the picture of Tomfool in the "King of Lear." And Mamma began
to say dreadfully: "Oh, <i>Richard!</i> How <i>could</i>&mdash;"
and then she stopped. For as soon as Papa saw her he pulled himself
away and ran to her, and put his arms round her neck and said: "Oh,
Mary, my Mary!...I couldn't do it...I couldn't do it." And then he
nearly fell down, and they all ran to hold him up, and put him in
the bedroom and shut the door. And he didn't see him again, but he
saw Maria and Aunt Zara carrying in the bath, and hot water and
flannels. And Papa was found. He tried to tell Luce but she was too
sleepy, and just said: "I fought he would." But he was so cold he
couldn't go to sleep again. And then something in him got too big
and he had to cry, because Papa was found. But&mdash;What did it
mean he said he <i>couldn't</i> be lost? Why not?</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-2-10" id="ch-3-2-10"></a>Chapter X</h3>

<p>On one of the numerous packing-cases that strewed the
rooms&mdash;now just so much soiled whitewash and bare
boards&mdash;Mary sat and waited for the dray that was to transport
boxes and baggage to the railway station. Her heart was heavy: no
matter how unhappy you had been in it, the dismantling of a home
was a sorry business, and one to which she never grew accustomed.
Besides, this time when they left, one of them had to stay behind.
As long as they lived here, her child had not seemed wholly gone;
so full was the house of memories of her. To the next, to any other
house they occupied, little Lallie would be a stranger.</p>

<p>Except for this, she was as thankful as Richard to turn her back
on Barambogie&mdash;and he had fled like a hunted man, before he
was really fit to travel. For the first time in their lives, the
decision to leave a place had come from her; she had made up her
mind to it while he was still too ill to care what happened. By the
next morning the tale of his doings was all over the town: he would
never have been able to hold up his head there again. For it wasn't
as if he had made a <i>genuine</i> attempt...at...well, yes, at
suicide. To the people here, his going out to take his life and
coming back without even having <i>tried</i> to, would have
something comic about it...something contemptible. They would laugh
in their sleeves; put it down to want of pluck. When what it really
proved&mdash;fiercely she reassured herself&mdash;was his fondness
for her, for his children. When the moment came he couldn't find it
in his heart to deal them such a blow.</p>

<p>But for several days she did no more than vehemently assert to
herself: we go!...and if I have to beg the money to make it
possible. Richard paid dearly for those hours of exposure: he lay
in a high fever, moaning with pain and muttering light-headedly. As
soon, however, as his temperature fell and his cough grew easier,
she made arrangements for a sale by auction, and had a board with
"To let!" on it erected in the front garden.</p>

<p>Then, his keys lying temptingly at her disposal, she seized this
unique opportunity and, shutting herself up in the surgery, went
for and by herself into his money-affairs; about which it was
becoming more and more a point of honour with him to keep her in
the dark. There, toilfully, she grappled with the jargon of the
law: premiums, transfers, conveyances, mortgagor and mortgagee (oh,
<i>which</i> was which?), the foreclosing of a mortgage, rights of
redemption. Grappled, too, with the secrets of his pass-book. And
it was these twin columns which gave her the knock-out blow. As far
as ready money went, they were living quite literally from hand to
mouth&mdash;from the receipt of one pound to the next. In
comparison, the deciphering of his case and visiting-books was
child's play. And here, taking the bull by the horns, she again
acted on her own initiative. Risking his anger, she sent out yet
once more the several unpaid bills she came across, accompanying
them by a more drastic demand for settlement than he would ever
have stooped to.</p>

<p>For the first time, she faced the possibility that they might
have to let the mortgage lapse. Already she had suspected Richard
of leaning towards this, the easier solution. But so far she had
pitted her will against his. And, even yet, something stubborn rose
in her and rebelled at the idea. As long as the few shares he held
continued to throw off dividends, at least the interest on the loan
could be met. While the rent coming in from the house at Hawthorn
(instead of being a source of income!) would have to cover the rent
of the house they could no longer live in, but had still to pay
for. Oh! it sounded like a bad dream&mdash;or a jingle of the
House-that-jack-built order.</p>

<p>None the less, she did not waver in her resolution: somehow to
cut Richard free from a place that had so nearly been his undoing.
And, hedge and shrink as she might, fiercely as her native
independence, her womanish principles&mdash;simple, but still the
principles of a lifetime&mdash;kicked against it, she had gradually
to become reconciled to the prospect of loading them up with a
fresh burden of debt. The matter boiled down to this: was any
sacrifice too great to make for Richard? Wasn't she really, at
heart, one of those women she sometimes read of in the newspapers,
who, rather than see their children starve, <i>stole</i> the bread
with which to feed them?</p>

<p>Yet still she hesitated. Until one night, turning his poor old
face to her Richard said: "It's the sea I need, Mary. If I could
just get to the sea, I should grow strong and well again.&mdash;But
there!...what's the use of talking? As the tree falls, so it must
lie!" On this night casting her scruples to the winds, Mary sat
down to pen the hated appeal.</p>

<p>FOR RICHARD'S SAKE, TILLY, AND ONLY BECAUSE I'M DESPERATE ABOUT
HIM, I 'M REDUCED TO ASKING YOU IF YOU COULD POSSIBLY SEE YOUR WAY
TO LEND ME A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS. I SAY "LEND" AND I MEAN IT,
THOUGH GOODNESS KNOWS WHEN I SHALL BE ABLE TO REPAY YOU. BUT
RICHARD HAS BEEN SO ILL, THE PRACTICE HAS ENTIRELY FAILED, AND IF I
CAN'T GET HIM AWAY FROM HERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN.</p>

<p>Tilly's answer, received by return, ran: OH, MARY LOVE, I FEEL
THAT SORRY FOR YOU I CAN'T SAY. BUT THANKS BE I CAN "DO" MY DEAR,
AND I NEEDN'T TELL YOU THE MONEY IS YOURS FOR THE ASKING. AS FOR
"LENDING"&mdash;WHY, IF IT MAKES YOUR POOR MIND EASIER PUT IT THAT
WAY BUT IT WON'T WORRY ME IF I NEVER SEE THE COLOUR OF THE OOF
AGAIN, REMEMBER THAT. ALL I HOPE IS, YOU'LL MAKE TRACKS LIKE ONE
O'CLOCK FROM THAT AWFUL PLACE, AND THAT THE DOCTOR'LL SOON BE ON
HIS LEGS AGAIN.&mdash;BUT MARY! AREN'T I GLAD I KEPT THAT NEST-EGG
AS YOU KNOW OF! YOU WERE A BIT DOUBTFUL AT THE TIME, LOVE, IF YOU
REMEMBER. BUT IF I HADN'T, WHERE SHOULD I BE TO-DAY? SOMETHING MUST
HAVE WARNED ME, I THINK: SIT UP, YOU LOVESICK OLD FOOL YOU, AND
TAKE THOUGHT FOR THE TIME WHEN IT'LL BE ALL CALLS AND NO DIVIDENDS.
WHICH, MARY, IS NOW. THE PLAIN TRUTH BEING, HIS LORDSHIP KEEPS ME
THAT TIGHT THAT IF I DIDN'T HAVE WHAT I DO, I MIGHT BE SITTING IN
PENTRIDGE. AND HE, THE GREAT LOON, IMAGINES I COME OUT ON WHAT HE
GIVES ME!&mdash;OH, MEN ARE FOOLS, MY DEAR, I'LL SAY IT AND SING IT
TO MY DYING DAY&mdash;AND IF IT'S NOT A FOOL, THEN YOU CAN TAKE IT
FROM ME IT'S A KNAVE. THERE OUGHT TO BE A BOARD UP WARNING US SILLY
WOMEN OFF.&mdash;EXCEPT THAT I'VE GOT MY BLESSED BABE. WHICH MAKES
UP FOR A LOT. BUT OH! IF ONE COULD JUST GET CHILDREN FOR THE
WISHING, OR PICK 'EM LIKE FRUIT FROM THE TREES, WITHOUT A THIRD
PERSON HAVING TO BE MIXED UP IN IT. (I DO THINK THE LORD MIGHT HAVE
MANAGED THINGS BETTER.) AND I WON'T DENY, MARY, THE THOUGHT HAS
COME TO ME NOW AND THEN JUST TO TAKE BABY AND MY BIT OF SPLOSH, AND
VAMOOSE TO SOMEWHERE WHERE A PAIR OF TROUSERS'LL NEVER DARKEN MY
SIGHT AGAIN.</p>

<p>And now, for several mornings running, the postman handed in a
couple of newspapers, the inner sheets of which contained the
separate halves of a twenty-pound note: this being Tilly's idea of
the safest and quickest means of forwarding money.</p>

<p>"Just something I'd managed to lay past for a rainy day," Mary
lied boldly, on handing Richard his fare to town and ten pounds
over for expenses. And pride, scruples, humiliation, all faded into
thin air before the relief, the burning gratitude, her gift let
loose in him. "Wife! you don't...you <i>can't</i> know what this
means to me!" And then he broke down and cried, clinging like a
child to her hand.</p>

<p>Restored to composure, he burst into a diatribe against the
place, the people. What it had done to him, what they had made of
him...him, whose only crime was that of being a gentleman. "Because
I wouldn't drink with them, descend to their level. Oh, these
wretched publicans!...these mill-hands, and Chinese
half-castes...these filthy Irish labourers! Mary, I would have done
better to go to my grave, than ever to have come among them. And
then the climate...and this water-hole they call a Lagoon...and the
mill-whistle&mdash;that accursed whistle! It alone would have ended
by driving me mad. But let me once shake the dust of the place off
my feet, and Richard will be himself again. A kingdom for a horse?
Mine&mdash;no kingdom, but a cesspool&mdash;for the sea! The
sea!...elixir of life...to me and my kind. Positively, I begin to
believe I'm one of those who should never live out of earshot of
its waves."</p>

<p>This new elation held up to the very end (when the thought of
being recognised or addressed by any of those he was fleeing from
threw him into a veritable fever). In such a mood he was
unassailable: insensitive alike to pain or pleasure. Hence, the
report that finally reached them from the Oakworth hospital didn't
touch him as it ought to have done...considering that the affair
had all but killed him. He really took it very queerly. The surgeon
wrote that the operation had been successful; there was now every
hope that, the overlapping corrected, perfect union would be
obtained; which, as the lad's father also professed himself
satisfied, would no doubt lift a weight from Dr. Mahony's mind. But
Richard only waxed bitterly sarcastic. "Coming to their senses at
last, are they?...now it's too late. Beginning to see how a
gentleman ought to be treated?" Which somehow wasn't like him...to
harp on the "gentleman."</p>

<p>He even came back on it, in a letter describing an acquaintance
he had made (Richard and chance acquaintances!) in sailing down the
Bay to Shortlands Bluff. This was a fellow medico: LIKE MYSELF A
GENTLEMAN WHO HAS HAD MISFORTUNES, AND IS NOW OBLIGED TO RESUME
PRACTICE. STILL MORE DISCONCERTING WAS IT TO READ: I TOLD HIM ABOUT
BARAMBOGIE AND MENTIONED THE HOUSE BEING TO LET AND THE SALE OF THE
FURNITURE, AND SAID THERE WAS A PRACTICE READY TO HAND. RATHER
QUIET JUST NOW, BUT CERTAIN TO IMPROVE. IF HE TOOK IT, ALL I SHOULD
ASK WOULD BE A CHEQUE FOR FIFTY POUNDS AT THE END OF THE YEAR. I
PUT OUR LEAVING DOWN ENTIRELY TO THE CLIMATE. SHOULD HE WRITE TO
YOU, BE SURE AND DO NOT PUT HIM OFF. At which Mary
winced.&mdash;And yet...Another man might get on quite well here;
some one who understood better how to deal with the people. So she
answered guardedly; being loath to vex him and spoil his holiday,
which really seemed to be doing him good. He boasted of sound
nights and improved appetite: AS USUAL THE SEA MAKES ME RAVENOUS.
And so it went on, until the time came when it was no longer
possible to shirk the question: what next? Then, at once, they were
at loggerheads again.</p>

<p>In passing through Melbourne, Mahony had seen an advertisement
calling for tenders for a practice at a place named Narrong; and
with her approval had written for particulars. To Mary this opening
seemed just the thing. More than three times the size of
Barambogie, Narrong stood in a rich, squatting district, not very
far north of Ballarat. The practice included several clubs; the
climate was temperate: if Richard could but get a footing
there&mdash;the clubs alone represented a tidy income&mdash;the
future might really begin to look more hopeful.</p>

<p>And at first he was all in favour of it. Then, overnight as it
were, he changed his mind, and, without deigning to give her a
single reason, wrote that he had abandoned the idea of applying. It
was the sea that had done it; she could have sworn it was: this sea
she so feared and hated! Besides, the usual thing was happening: no
sooner did Richard get away from her than he allowed himself to be
influenced by every fresh person he met. And taking advantage of
his credulity, people were now, for some obscure purpose of their
own, making him believe he could earn three or four hundred a year
at Shortlands' Bluff...though it was common knowledge that such
seaside places lay dead and deserted for nine months out of the
twelve. Besides, there was a doctor at Shortlands already; though
now close on seventy, and unwilling to turn out at night.</p>

<p>The one valuable piece of information he gave her was that the
billet of Acting Health Officer, with a yearly retaining-fee and an
additional couple of guineas for each boarding, was vacant. All
else, she felt sure, was mere windy talk. Thus, people were
advising him, if he settled there, not only to keep a horse and
ride round the outlying districts, but also to cross twice or
thrice weekly to the opposite side of the Bay, and open
consulting-rooms at some of the smaller places. WITH MY LOVE OF
SAILING THIS WOULD BE NO TOIL TO ME...SHEERLY A PLEASURE. It was
true, old Barker intended to hang on to the two clubs in the
meanwhile; but by Christmas he might hope to have these in his own
hands. He had found the very house for them&mdash;a great piece of
good luck this, for private houses were few. She would do well,
though, to part with some of the heavier furniture; for the rooms
were smaller than those they were leaving. Also to try to find a
purchaser for the "Collard and Collard"&mdash;since coming here he
had learned that an "Aucher Freres" was better suited to withstand
the sea air. The climate, of course, was superb&mdash;though very
cold in winter&mdash;the bathing excellent: IN SUMMER I SHALL GO
INTO THE SEA EVERY DAY. Best of all they were within easy reach of
Melbourne...and that meant civilisation once more. I FEEL VERY
HAPPY AND HOPEFUL, MY DEAREST. QUITE SURE MY LUCK IS ABOUT TO
TURN.</p>

<p>Angry and embittered, Mary made short work of his fallacies. And
now high words passed between them: she believing their very
existence to be at stake; he fighting, but with considerable
shuffling and hedging (or so it seemed to her), to defend his
present scheme. And neither would give way.</p>

<p>Till one morning she held the following letter in her hand.</p>

<p>I SEE IT'S NO USE MY BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH ANY LONGER&mdash;YOU
FORCE ME, WRITING AS YOU DO, TO TELL YOU WHAT I DID NOT MEAN TO
WORRY YOU WITH. THE TRUTH IS, I HAVE NOT BEEN AT ALL WELL AGAIN. MY
OLD ENEMY, FOR ONE THING&mdash;REQUIRING THE MOST CAREFUL
DIETING&mdash;THE OLD HEADACHES AND FITS OF VERTIGO. I HAVE ALSO
FALLEN BACK ON VERY POOR NIGHTS; NO SLEEP TILL FOUR OR FIVE...FOR
WHICH HOWEVER I MUST SAY YOUR LETTERS ARE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE.
FEELING VERY LOW THE OTHER DAY, I WENT TO GEELONG AND SAW
BOWES-SMITH WHO VISITS THERE; AND IT WAS HIS OPINION THAT I SHOULD
BE TOTALLY UNFIT TO COPE WITH THE WORK AT NARRONG. WHICH BUT
CONFIRMS MY OWN. OF COURSE, AS YOU ARE SO SET ON IT, I MIGHT TRY IT
FOR THREE MONTHS&mdash;ALONE. BUT I CANNOT DO IMPOSSIBILITIES, AND
IF EEL MORE AND MORE THAT I AM AN OLD AND BROKEN MAN. (ANOTHER
THING, I SHOULD AGAIN HAVE NO ONE TO CONSULT WITH&mdash;AND...AS
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BY NOW...I AM NOT WELL UP IN SURGERY.) MY POOR
HEAD HAS NEVER RECOVERED THE SHOCK IT GOT LAST SUMMER...WHEN YOU
WERE AWAY. NO DOUBT I HAD A KIND OF FIT. AND THOUGH I HAVE SAID
NOTHING ABOUT IT, I HAVE BEEN SENSIBLE OF SOME UNPLEASANT SYMPTOMS
OF A RETURN OF THIS, ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION SINCE. MY AFFECTION,
WHICH WAS APHASIA, MAY COME ON AGAIN AT ANY TIME. IT MAY ALSO END
IN...WELL, IN MY BECOMING A HELPLESS BURDEN...TO YOU AND EVERY ONE.
NOTHING CAN BE DONE; THERE IS NO TREATMENT FOR IT BUT A TOTAL
ABSENCE OF WORRY AND EXCITEMENT. SO IF YOU REGRET NARRONG, YOU MUST
FORGIVE ME; IT WAS DONE FOR YOUR SAKE.</p>

<p>ONE OTHER THING. EVERY ONE HERE TAKES BOARDERS DURING THE
SEASON: THERE IS NO DISGRACE ATTACHED TO IT. YOU COULD PROBABLY
FILL THE HOUSE...AND IN THAT WAY I SHOULD NOT FEEL THAT I WAS
LEAVING YOU ENTIRELY UNPROVIDED FOR. THERE IS NO DUST OR DIRT HERE
EITHER: WHEREAS AT NARRONG I SHOULD NEED TO KEEP TWO HORSES AND A
MAN AND BUGGY.</p>

<p>SEND ME SOME WARMER UNDERCLOTHING, THE CONTINUAL BLOW OF THE
EQUINOCTIAL GALES.</p>

<p>THERE IS SURE TO BE PLENTY OF SICKNESS WHEN THE VISITORS COME.
SHORTLANDS WILL LEAD TO STRENGTH, NARRONG TO THE BENEVOLENT
ASYLUM.</p>

<p>YOUR LOVING HUSBAND,<br>
R.T.M.</p>

<p>P.S. I AM SO WORRIED I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I AM WRITING FOR GOD'S
SAKE CHEER UP.</p>

<p>At which Mary threw the letter on the table and laughed aloud.
Hear how ill I am, but be sure not to take it to heart! Oh! it
wasn't fair of him...it wasn't fair. He had her down and beaten,
and he knew it: to such a letter there could be but one reply.
Picking it up she re-read it, and for a moment alarm riddled her.
Then with a jerk she pulled herself together. How often Richard
had...yes! over and over again. Besides, you could just as easily
deceive yourself with bad dreams as with rosy ones. HOW MUCH OF
WHAT HE WROTE WAS TRUE? His health had certainly suffered; but that
was all due to this place. He'd said so himself. Let him once get
away from here...Places. And if she now insisted on his going to
Narrong, even on his definitely applying for the practice, there
would be more swords held over her head, more insidious hints and
threats. He complained of not being able to find his words: well,
would any one think that surprising, did they know the life he had
led here?...how he never went out, never spoke to a soul, but sat,
for days on end, gloomily sunk in himself.</p>

<p>His airy suggestion that she should open the house to boarders
stung and aggrieved her...coming from him. The idea was her own:
she had mooted it long ago. <i>Then</i>, it had outraged his
feelings. "Not as long as I live!" Which attitude, bereft of common
sense though it was, had yet something very soothing in it. Now,
without a word of excuse, he climbed down from his perch and thrust
the scheme upon her...as his own! Blown into thin air was his
pride, his thoughts for her standing, his care for the children's
future. Her heart felt dark and heavy. Of course if the worst
<i>should</i> come to the worst...but then she would be doing it
for <i>them</i>, not for him...or rather, not just in order that he
might somehow get his own way. Oh, he had cried wolf too often. And
a desperate bitterness; the sensation of being "had"; of him
baulking at no means to achieve his end, was upon her again,
clouding her judgment. She simply did not know what to think.</p>

<p>And this attitude of doubt accompanied her through all the
dreary weeks of uprootal; down to the day when the bellman went up
and down the main street crying the sale; when the auction-flag
flew from the roof; and rough, curious, unfriendly people swarmed
the house, to walk off with her cherished belongings. And as she
worked, watched, brooded, a phrase from Tilly's letter kept ringing
and buzzing through her head. SOMETIMES THE THOUGHT HAS COME TO ME,
JUST TO TAKE BABY AND MY BIT OF SPLOSH AND GO OFF SOMEWHERE
WHERE...</p>

<p>For nothing in the world would she have her children defrauded
of their piano. Every toy they possessed, too, went with them; she
saw to that. (<i>He</i> never thought of parting with his books!)
While the Paris ornaments were her share of the spoils. (But anyhow
it would have been casting pearls before swine, to offer them for
sale here).&mdash;As, one by one, she took apart the gilt-legged
tables, the gilt candelabra, to lay the pieces between soft layers
of clothing, memories of the time when they were bought came
crowding in on her. She saw the Paris shops again, the salesman
bowing and smirking, the monkey-like little courier who had acted
as interpreter. But most vividly of all she saw Richard himself.
The very clothes he had worn were plain to her: there he stood,
erect and handsome, a fine and dignified figure. And then, in
pitiful contrast, a vision of him as, a few weeks back, he had
slunk up to the railway station: a shamed and humiliated old man.
Dear God!...these passionate angers he roused in her, the
unspeakable irritations she was capable of feeling with him, were
things of the surface only. Dig deeper, and nothing
mattered...<i>but</i> him. Aye, dig only deep enough, and her heart
was raw with pity for him. Let what might, happen to her; let the
children go short, run wild; let him drag them at his heels the
whole world over: she would submit to everything, endure
everything, if she could only see him&mdash;Richard, her own dear
husband&mdash;hold up his head once more, carry himself with the
old confidence, fear to meet no one's eye, knowing that he had
never yet wilfully done any man hurt or wrong.</p>

<p>"Papa, papa&mdash;the flag! The flag's just <i>this</i> minnit
gone up."</p>

<p>"The flag! Papa's this minnit gone up."</p>

<p>The children came rushing in with the news, Lucie in her zeal to
echo Cuffy bringing out her words the wrong way round. But
<i>how</i> funny! Papa was fast asleep in his chair, and at first
when he waked up couldn't tell where he was. He called out quite
loud: "Where am I? Where the dickens am I?" and looked as if he
didn't know them. But as soon as he did, he ran to the window.
"Quite right! Splendid! So it is.&mdash;Now who saw it first?"</p>

<p>"Lucie," said Cuffy stoutly; for he had seen first <i>all</i>
the times; Luce never would, not if she was old as old. And so
Lucie received the hotly coveted penny, her little face, with the
fatly hanging cheeks that made almost a square of it, pink with
pleasure. But also with embarrassment. Would God be <i>very</i>
angry with Cuffy for tellin' what wasn't true? (She thought God
must look just like Papa when he was cross.)</p>

<p>Papa scuttled about. Shouting.</p>

<p>"Mary! Where are you? The flag's gone up. Quick! My greatcoat.
My scarf."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I'm coming.&mdash;But...why...you haven't even got
your boots on! Whatever have you been doing since breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Surely to goodness, I can call a little time my own?...for
reading and study?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right. But fancy you having to go out again to-day.
With such a sea running! And when you got so wet yesterday."</p>

<p>"It's those second-hand oilskins. I told you I ought to have new
ones. &mdash;Now where are my papers?&mdash;Oh, these confounded
laces! They <i>would</i> choose just this moment to break. It's no
good; I can't stoop, it sends the blood to my head."</p>

<p>"Here...put up your foot!" And going on her knees, Mary laced
his boots. <i>Till</i> she got him off! The fuss&mdash;the
commotion!</p>

<p>Standing in the doorway Cuffy drank it all in. This <i>was</i>
an exciting place to live. To have to rush like mad as soon as ever
a flag went up. If only someday Papa would take him with him. To go
down to the beach with Papa, and row off from the
jetty&mdash;Papa's own jetty!&mdash;and sit in the boat beside him,
and be rowed out by Papa's own sailors, to the big ship that was
waiting for him. Waiting just for Papa. When he was a big man he'd
be a doctor, too, and have a jetty and a boat of his own, and be
rowed out to steamers and ships, and climb on board, and say if
they were allowed to go to Melbourne.&mdash;But how <i>funny</i>
Papa was, since being here. When his voice got loud it sounded like
as if he was going to scream. And then...he'd said he was
busy...when he was really asleep. He believed Papa was afraid...of
Mamma. Knew she'd be cross with him for going to sleep again
directly after breakfast. It made him want to say: Oh, <i>don't</i>
be afraid, Papa, big men never do be...only little children like
Lucie. (Specially not one's Papa.)</p>

<p>Slamming the driving-gate behind him&mdash;with such force that
it missed the latch, and swinging out went to and fro like a
pendulum&mdash;Mahony stepped on to the wide, sandy road, over
which the golden-flowered capeweed had spread till only a narrow
track in the centre remained free. It was half a mile to the beach,
and he covered the ground at a jog-trot; for his fear of being late
was on a par with his fear that he might fail to see the signal:
either through a temporary absence of mind, or from having dozed
off (the sea air was having an unholy effect upon him) at the wrong
moment. Hence his bribe to the children to be on the
look-out.&mdash;Now on, past neat, one-storeyed weatherboards, past
Bank and church and hotels he hurried, breathing heavily, and with
a watchful eye to his feet. For his left leg was decidedly
stiffish; and, to spare it, his pace had to be a long, springing
step with the right, followed by a shorter one with the left: a
gait that had already earned him the nickname in Shortlands of "Old
Dot-and-go-one."</p>

<p>Taking the Bluff, with its paths, seats and vivid grass-carpet,
in his stride, he scrambled down the loose sand of the cliff,
through the young scrub and the ragged, storm-bent ti-trees, which
were just bursting into pearly blossom. And the result of this
hurry-scurry was that he got to the beach too soon: his men had
only just begun to open up the boat-shed. Fool that he was! But it
was always the same...and would be to-morrow, and the day after
that: when his fears seized him, he was powerless against them.
Having irritably snapped his fingers and urged on the crew with an
impatient: "Come, come, my good men, a little more haste, if you
please!" he retired to the jetty, where he paced to and fro.</p>

<p>But at last the boat was launched, the sailors had grasped their
oars: he, too, might descend the steps and take his seat.&mdash;And
now he knew that all the press and fluster of the past half-hour
had been directed towards this one, exquisite moment: in which they
drew out to ride the waves. Of the few pleasures left him, it was
by far the keenest: he relived it in fancy many a night when his
head lay safe on the pillow. To-day was a day, too, after his own
heart. A high sea ran, and the light boat dived, and soared, and
fell again, dancing like a cockleshell. The surface of the water
was whipt by a wind that blew the foam from the wave-crests in
cloudlets of steam or smoke. The salt spray was everywhere: in your
eyes, your mouth, your hair. Overhead, between great bales of snowy
cloud, the sky was gentian-blue; blue were the hills behind the
nestling white huts of the quarantine station on the other side of
the Bay; indigo-blue the waters below. Intoxicated by all this
light and colour, at being one again with his beloved element, he
could have thrown back his head and shouted for joy; have sent out
cries to match the lovely commotion of wind and sea. But there was
no question of thus letting himself go: he had perforce to remain
as dumb as the men who rowed him. Above all, to remember to keep
his eyes lowered. For the one drawback to his pleasure was that he
was not alone. He had a crew of six before him, six pairs of
strange eyes to meet; and every time he half-closed his own and
expanded his nostrils, the better to drink in the savour of the
briny, or, at an unusually deep dip, let fly a gleeful exclamation,
they fixed him stonily, one and all. There was no escaping them,
pinned to his seat as he was: nor any room for his own
eyes...nowhere to rest them...except on the bottom of the boat.
Only so could he maintain his privacy.&mdash;Eyes...human eyes.
Eyes...<i>spies</i>, ferreting out one's thoughts...watchdogs on
the qui vive for one's smallest movement...spiders, sitting over
their fly-victims, ready to pounce. Eyes. Slits into the soul;
through which you peered, as in a twopenny peepshow, at clandestine
and unedifying happenings. A mortal's outside the <i>ne plus
ultra</i> of dignity and suavity...and then the eyes, disproving
all. Oh! it ought not to be possible, so to see into another's
depths; it was indecent, obscene: had he not more than once, in a
woman's comely countenance, met eyes that were hot, angry,
malignant?...unconscious betrayers of an unregenerate soul. None
should outrage him in like fashion: he knew the trick and guarded
against it, by keeping his own bent rigidly on the boards at his
feet...on the boot-soles of the men in front of him. But smiles and
chuckles were not so easily subdued: they would out...and out they
came.</p>

<p>As the boat drew nearer the vessel that lay to, awaiting them, a
new anxiety got the upper hand. Wrinkling his brows, he strained to
see what was in store for him. Ha! he might have known it: another
of those infernal rope ladders to be scaled. He trembled in
advance. For you needed the agility of an ape to swing yourself
from the tossing boat to the bottom rung of the ladder; the
strength of a navvy to maintain your hold, once you were there,
before starting on the precarious job of hoisting yourself, rung by
rung, up the ship's steep side. And to-day, with this wild sea
running, it was worse than ever&mdash;was all the men could do to
bring the boat close enough, yet not too close, alongside, for him
to get a grip on the rope. The seat he stood on was slippery, his
oilskins encumbered him: he made one attempt after another. Each
time, before he had succeeded in jerking himself across, the gulf
opened anew. Finally, in most undignified fashion, he was laid hold
of, and pushed and shoved from behind; and thereafter came a
perilous moment when he hung over the trough of sea, not knowing
whether his muscles would answer to the strain, or whether he would
drop back into the water. Desperately he clung to the swaying rope;
what seemed an eternity passed before he could even straighten
himself, let alone climb out of reach of the waves.&mdash;Deuce
take it! you needed to be at least twenty years younger for
acrobatics of this kind.</p>

<p>Hanging over the side, the ship's crew followed his doings with
the engrossed and childish interest of men fresh from the high
seas. As he came within reach, however, willing hands were thrust
forth to help him. But he was shattered by his exertions, the deck
was wet, and no sooner did he set foot on it than his legs shot
from under him, and he fell heavily and awkwardly on his back. And
this was too much for the onlookers, just suited their elephantine
sense of humour, already tickled by his un-seamanlike performance
on the ladder: one and all burst into a loud guffaw. Bruised and
dazed he scrambled to his feet, and, hat and bag having been
restored him, was piloted by a grinning seaman to the captain's
cabin.</p>

<p>There had been no single case of sickness on the outward voyage:
the visit was a mere formality; and the whole affair could have
been settled inside five minutes&mdash;had he not been forced to
ask the captain's leave to rest a little, in order to recover
before undertaking the descent: his hips ached and stung, his hand
shook so that he had difficulty in affixing his signature. He
thought the captain, a shrewd-eyed, eagle-nosed Highlander, whose
conversation consisted of a series of dry: "Aye, aye's!" looked
very oddly at him on his curt refusal of the proffered bottle.
"Thank you, I never touch stimulants."</p>

<p>As he hobbled home wet and chilled, his head aching from its
contact with the deck, arm and shoulder rapidly stiffening: as he
went, he had room in his mind for one thought only: I've taken on
more than I can manage. I'm not fit for the job&mdash;or shan't
be...much longer. And then?...my God!...<i>and then</i>?&mdash;But
hush! Not a word to Mary.</p>

<p>Entering the dining-room he pettishly snatched off the
dish-cover. "<i>What?</i>...hash again? I declare of late we seem
to live on nothing else!"</p>

<p>Mary sighed. "If I serve the meat cold, you grumble; if I make
it up, you grumble, too. I can't throw half a joint away. What am I
to do?"</p>

<p>He suppressed the venomous: "Eat it yourself!" that rose to his
lips. "I've surely a right to expect something fresh and appetising
when I get back after a hard morning's work? You know I loathe
twice-cooked meat!"</p>

<p>"I thought you'd bring such an appetite home with you that you'd
be equal to anything. Other times you do. But you don't know your
own mind from one day to the next."</p>

<p>"If <i>that's</i> all you have to say, I won't eat
anything!"&mdash;And despite her expostulations and entreaties:
"Richard! come back, dear, don't be so silly," he banged out of the
room.</p>

<p>Instantly Cuffy pushed his plate away. "I don't like it either,
Mamma."</p>

<p>Glad of a scapegoat, Mary rounded on the child with a: "Will
<i>you</i> kindly hold your tongue, sir?" letting out not only her
irritation with Richard, but also the exhaustion of a morning's
governessing: a task for which she was wholly unfitted by nature.
"You'll not leave the table till you've eaten every scrap on your
plate."</p>

<p>And Cuffy, being really very hungry&mdash;he had only said like
Papa to try and make Mamma think Papa wasn't quite so
bad&mdash;obeyed without a further word.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he had to go to the butcher's with a basket to buy a
chop&mdash;a big one and not too fat, Papa didn't eat fat&mdash;and
then, when the whole house smelt good with frying, to go in and say
to Papa that dinner was ready.</p>

<p>But Papa was asleep and snoring; and he didn't like to wake him.
He fidgeted about and made a noise for a bit, and then went out and
said so.</p>

<p>But Mamma sent him back: the chop was cooked and had to be
eaten. So he put his hand on Papa's arm and shook it. But Papa
knocked it off, and jumped up calling out: "What is it?...what is
it now?" And very angry: "<i>can't</i> you let me be?&mdash;Oh,
it's you, my dear?&mdash;What? Not I! Tell your mother I want
nothing."</p>

<p>And then Mamma came marching in herself, and was furious. "And
when I've sent out specially to get it! I never heard such
nonsense. Going the whole day without food just to spite me!"</p>

<p>She was quite close up to Papa when she talked this; and they
were both dreadfully angry; and then...then Cuffy dis<i>tinkly</i>
saw Papa's foot fly out and hit her...on her knee. And she said:
"<i>Ooh</i>!" and stooped down and put her hand to it, and looked
at him, oh! so fierce...but she didn't say any more, not a word
(and he knew it was because he was there), but turned on her back
and walked out of the room. And he felt frightened, and went away,
too; but not before he'd seen Papa put his face in his hands, just
as if he was going to cry.</p>

<p>They kept a goat now: it was chained up in the back yard to eat
the grass and things, which would have smothered them if it hadn't.
Well, he went out to the goat&mdash;it was tied up and couldn't run
away&mdash;and kicked it. It maa-ed and tore round like mad: but he
just didn't care; he kicked again. Till Luce came out and saw him
and made awful eyes, and said: "Oh, Cuffy! Oh, poor little Nanny!
Oh, you bad, wicked boy! I'll go wight in and tell Mamma what
you're doin'."</p>

<p>But Mamma could not be got at. She was in the bedroom with the
door locked; and she wouldn't come out, though you called and
called, and rattled the handle. (But she wasn't dead, 'cos you
could hear them talkin'.)</p>

<p>With his arms round her, his face on her shoulder, Richard
besought her: "Mary, Mary, what is it? What's the matter with me?
Why am I like this?&mdash;oh, why?"</p>

<p>"God knows! You seem not to have an atom of self-control left.
When it comes to kicking me...and in front of the children..." Her
heart full to bursting, Mary just stood and bore his weight, but
neither raised her arms nor comforted him.</p>

<p>"I know, I know. But it isn't only temper&mdash;God knows it
isn't! It's like a whirlpool...a whirlwind...that rises in me.
Forgive me, forgive me! I didn't mean it. I had a nasty fall on the
deck this morning. I think that knocked the wits out of me."</p>

<p>"A fall? How? Were you hurt?" Mary asked quickly. At any hint of
bodily injury, and was it but a bruise, she was all sympathy and
protection.</p>

<p>Meekly now, but with only the ghost of an appetite, Mahony sat
down to the congealed chop, which he sliced and swallowed
half-chewed, while Mary moved about the room, her lids red-rimmed
and swollen. And the children, having snatched one look at her,
crept away with sinking hearts. Oh, Mamma dear, dear,
don't...<i>don't</i> be unhappy!</p>

<p>In telling of his fall and making it answerable for his
subsequent behaviour, Mahony failed to mention one thing: the
uneasiness his leg was causing him. Some perverse spirit compelled
him to store this trouble up for his own tormenting&mdash;that
night when he lay stiff as a corpse, so as not to deprive Mary of
her well-earned rest. This numbness...this fatal numbness...He
tried to view himself in the light of a patient: groped,
experimented, investigated. What! cutaneous anaesthesia as well?
For he now found he could maltreat the limb as he would; there was
little or no answering sensation. Positively he believed he could
have run a pin into it. Sick with apprehension he put his hand down
to try yet once more, by running his finger-nails into and along
the flesh&mdash;and was aghast to hear a shrill scream from Mary.
"<i>Richard!</i> What <i>are</i> you doing? Oh, how you have hurt
me!"</p>

<p>He had drawn blood on her leg instead of on his own.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-3-2" id="ch-3-3-2"></a>Chapter II</h3>

<p>Mary waited, as for the millennium, for the opening of the
summer season. In the meantime Shortlands lay dead to the rest of
the world: the little steamer neither brought nor took off
passengers: the big ships all went by. But on every hand she heard
it said: let the season once begin and there would be work for
every one; the life of a year was crowded into three brief months.
If only they could manage to hold out till then! For December was
still two months off, and of private practice there was as good as
none. The place was so healthy for one thing (oh, there must surely
be something very wrong about a world in which you had to feel
<i>sorry</i> if people weren't ill!) and the poorer classes all
belonged to the clubs, which Richard hadn't got. His dreams of
keeping a horse and riding round the district, of opening
consulting-rooms on the other side, had, as she had known they
would, ended in smoke: the twice he had crossed the Bay he had not
even covered his fare. She wondered, sometimes, if such sickness as
there was did not still find its way to Dr. Barker, retired though
the old man professed to be. It was certainly owing to him that
nightwork had become extinct here. Through him refusing to leave
his bed, the inhabitants had simply got out of the way of being
taken ill at night.</p>

<p>And Richard did nothing to mend matters. On the contrary. At
present, for instance, he was going about in such a simmer of
indignation at what he called the trick that had been played on
him&mdash;the misleading reports of the income to be made
here&mdash;that he was apt to let it boil over on those who did
approach him. Then, too, the dreadful habit he had fallen into, of
talking to himself as he walked, put people off. (From something
the servant-girl let drop, she could see that he was looked on as
<i>very</i> odd.) But when she taxed him with it he flared up, and
vowed he had never in his life been guilty of such a thing; which
just shewed he didn't know he was doing it. If he had, he would
have been more careful; for he liked the place (hardly a day passed
on which he did not sigh: "If I can <i>only</i> make a living
here!") in spite of its deadness...and also of the cold, which
found out his weak spots. And for once in their lives they were in
agreement: she liked it, too. They were among people of their own
class again by whom she had been received with open arms. Though,
as she could see, this very friendliness might have its drawbacks.
For Richard had been quite wrong (as usual): the members of this
little clique did not let lodgings, most emphatically not; they
drew, indeed, a sharp line between those who did and those who
didn't. Well! she would just have to see...when the time came. If
the practice did <i>not</i> look up.&mdash;But oh! how she hoped
and prayed it would: she could hardly trust herself to think what
might happen if it did not.</p>

<p>One afternoon as they sat at tea&mdash;it was six o'clock on a
blustery spring day&mdash;they heard the click of the gate, and
looking out saw some one coming up the path: a short, stoutish man
in a long-skirted greatcoat, who walked with a limp.</p>

<p>Mary rubbed her eyes. "Why...why, Richard!"</p>

<p>"What is it?...who is it?" cried Mahony, and made as if to fly:
he was in one of those moods when the thought of facing a stranger
filled him with alarm.</p>

<p>"Why...I..."</p>

<p>"He's walking right in," announced Cuffy.</p>

<p>"An' wavin' his hand, Mamma."</p>

<p>Sure enough, the newcomer came up the verandah steps and
unceremoniously tapped on the window-pane. "Hullo, good people
all!...how are you?" And <i>then</i>, of course, he with his hat
off, shewing a head innocent of hair, there was no mistaking
him.</p>

<p>With one eye on Richard, who was still capable of trying to do a
bolt, one on the contents of her larder-shelves, Mary exclaimed in
surprise. "Well, of all the...Purdy! Where have you sprung from? Is
Tilly with you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Tilly?</i> Mrs. P. Smith? God bless my soul, no! My dear,
this wind 'ud give 'is Majesty the bellyache for a month; we'd hear
tell of nothing else. Lord bless you, no! We never go out if it
blows the least little tiddly-wink, or if there's a cloud in the
sky, or if old Sol's rays are too strong for us. We're a hothouse
plant, <i>we</i> are. What do you say to that, you brawny young
nippers, you?"</p>

<p>It was the same old Purdy: words just babbled out of him. And
having taken off his coat and chucked the children under the
chin&mdash;after first pretending not to know them because of their
enormous size, and then to shake in his shoes at such a pair of
giants&mdash;he drew in his chair and fell to, with appetite, on
the toothsome remains of a rabbit-pie and the home-baked jam tarts
that Mary somehow conjured up to set before him. "These sea-voyages
are the very devil for makin' one peckish. I've a thirst on me,
too...your largest cup, Polly, if you please, will just about suit
my measure."&mdash;As she listened to his endless flow, Mary
suspected him of already having tried to quench this thirst on the
way there.</p>

<p>In eating, he told of the business that had brought him to
Shortlands; and at greater length than was either necessary or
desirable; for there was a lot in it about "doing" a person, in
revenge for having been "done" by him, and the children of course
drank it all in. Mary did her best to edge the conversation round,
knowing how strongly Richard disapproved of their being initiated,
before their time, into the coarse and sordid things of life. But
what followed was even worse. For now Purdy started indulging in
personalities. "I say, you two, isn't this just like old
times...eh?" he said as he munched. "Just like old times...except
of course that we're all a good bit thicker in the tummy and
thinner on the thatch than we were, ha, ha!...your humb. serv. in
partic.! <i>Also</i>"&mdash;and he winked his right eye at the room
at large&mdash;"excepting for the presence of the young couple I
observe sitting opper<i>site</i>, who were <i>not</i> on the
tappis, or included in the programme, in those far-off
days&mdash;eh, Poll? Young people who insisted on putting in an
appearance at a later date, unwanted young noosances that they
were!" (At which Cuffy, flaming scarlet, looked anxiously at his
mother for a denial: she had told him over and over again how
enjoyed she and Papa had been to see him.) "Well, well! such little
accidents will happen. But far from us was it to think of
such...all those many...now <i>how</i> many years was it ago?
Thirty&mdash;for a cert! Ah! no hidin' your age from me, Mrs.
Poll...after the manner of ladies when they come to the sere and
yellow leaf. I've got you nailed, me dear!"</p>

<p>Colouring slightly (she thought talk of this kind in sorry taste
before the children), Mary was just about to say she didn't mind
who knew how old she was, when Richard, who till now had sat like a
death's-head, brought his fist down on the table with a bang. "And
I say, not a day over twenty-five!" He did make them jump.</p>

<p>Purdy, so jovial was he, persisted in taking this to refer, not
to the date, but to her age, and bantered harder than ever,
accusing Richard of trying to put his wife's clock back. And what
with Richard arguing at the top of his voice to set him right, and
Purdy waggishly refusing to see what was meant, it looked for a
moment as if it might come to an open quarrel between them.</p>

<p>"Richard!...hush, dear!" frowned Mary, and surreptitiously shook
her head. "What can it matter? Oh, don't be so silly!" For he was
agitatedly declaring that he would fetch out his old case-books and
prove the year, black on white. She turned to Purdy: "You've told
me nothing at all yet about Tilly and the boy."</p>

<p>But Purdy had plainly no wish to talk of wife or child, and
refused to let himself be diverted from the course of reminiscence
on which he had embarked. To oblige her, he dropped his mischievous
baiting with a: "Well, well, then, so be it! I suppose I'm getting
soft in the uppers," but continued to draw on his memories of the
old days, spinning yarns of things that had happened to him, and
things she was quite sure hadn't, egged on by the saucer eyes of
the children. "Remember this, Poll?...remember that?" she vainly
endeavouring to choke him off with a dry: "I'm afraid I don't." She
sat on pins and needles. If only he wouldn't work Richard up again.
But it almost seemed as if this was his object; for he concluded
his tale of the Stockade and his flight from Ballarat, with the
words: "And so afeared for his own skin was our friend old Sawbones
there, that he only ventured out of an evening, after dark; and so
the wound got mucky and wouldn't heal. And that's the true story,
you kids, of how I came to be the limping-Jesus I am and ever shall
be, world without end, amen!"</p>

<p>Of all the wicked falsehoods! (Or had he <i>really</i> gone
about nursing this belief?) Such expressions, too!...before the
children. Thank goodness, Richard hadn't seemed to hear: otherwise
she would have expected him to fly out of his chair. A stolen
glance shewed him sitting, head on chest, making patterns on the
tablecloth with the point of his knife. And having failed thus to
draw him, if Purdy didn't now dish up, with several unsavoury
additions, the old, old story of the foolish bet taken between the
two of them as young men, that Richard wouldn't have the pluck to
steal a kiss from her at first meeting; and how, in the darkness of
the summer-house, he had mistaken one girl for the other and
embraced Jinny instead. "Putting his arms round her
middle&mdash;plump as a partridge she was too, by gum!&mdash;and
giving 'er a smack that could have been heard a mile off. Killing
two birds with one stone I call it!...gettin' the feel of a second
gal under his hands, free, gratis and for nothing."</p>

<p>At such indelicacy Mary held her breath. But what was this?
Instead of the furious outburst for which she waited, she heard
a...chuckle. Yes, Richard was laughing&mdash;his head still sunk,
his eyes fixed on the tablecloth&mdash;laughing and nodding to
himself at the memory Purdy had called up. And then&mdash;oh, no!
it was incredible: to her horror, Richard himself added a detail,
the grossness of which sent the blood to her cheeks.</p>

<p>What was more, he was going on. "Run away and play, children. At
once! Do you hear?" For Cuffy was listening open-mouthed, and
laughing, too, in an odd, excited way. She had them off their
chairs and out of the room in a twinkling. Herself she stood for a
moment in the passage, one hand pressed to her face. Oh! by fair
means or foul&mdash;"You're wanted, Richard! Yes,
immediately!"&mdash;And after that it was not hard to get Purdy up
from the table and sent about his business.</p>

<p>But as soon as the children were in bed she went into the
surgery, and there, shutting fast the door, let out her smothered
wrath, making a scene none the less heated because it had to be
carried on under her breath. To her stupefaction Richard flatly
denied the charge. What was she talking about? No such words had
ever crossed <i>his</i> lips! "Before my children? Whose every hair
is precious to me?" He was as perturbed as she, at the bare idea.
Oh, what was to be done with a person whose memory was capable of
playing him such tricks? In face of his indignation, his patent
honesty, you couldn't just rap out the word "liar!" and turn on
your heel.</p>

<p>Yes, a disastrous visit from start to finish. The children alone
got pleasure from it. Purdy took a great liking to them&mdash;he
who hadn't a word to say for his own child&mdash;and on the
verandah next morning the trio were very merry together. Cuffy's
laugh rang out again and again.</p>

<p>For Cuffy thought Mr. Purdy a <i>very</i> nice man...even if his
head <i>was</i> shiny like an egg, and he was nearly as fat as that
ol' Sankoh in the big book with the pictures. (Papa, he was like
Donk Quick Shot, who tried to kill the windmills.) He had two
beautiful big diamond rings on his fingers, and a watch that struck
like a clock, and a whole bunch of things, little guns and swords
and seals, hanging on his chain. He gave them each half-a-crown and
said not to tell Mamma, and rode Luce to market on his foot, and
sang them a lovely song that went:</p>

<p>A man whose name was Johnny Sands<br>
Had married Betty Hague,<br>
And though she brought him gold and lands,<br>
She proved a terrible plague;<br>
for o she was a scolding wife<br>
Full of caprice and whim,<br>
He said that he was tired of life,<br>
And she was tired of him.</p>

<p>Ever so much of it, all about these people, till she fell into
the river and asked him to pull her out, and Johnny Sands would
have, but:</p>

<p>I can't, my dear, tho' much I wish,<br>
For you have tied my hands!</p>

<p>He and Luce jumped about and sang it, too. Oh, wasn't it nice
when somebody was happy and jolly and funny?&mdash;instead of
always being sorry, or cross. He thought he could <i>nearly</i>
have asked Mr. Purdy what it meant when you said: the female
nobleman obliges. It belonged to him, Papa had said it did; but he
hadn't ever dared ask anybody about it; people like Aunt Zara
laughed so, when you didn't understand. But he was going to...some
day.&mdash; The climax came next morning when, the front door
having closed behind the guest, the children came running out of
the dining-room crying gleefully: "Look, Mamma! Look what he's left
on the table!" For an instant Richard stood and stared
incredulously at the five-pound note Cuffy was holding aloft; the
next, with a savage exclamation he had snatched it from the child's
hand, and was through the porch and down the path, shouting at the
top of his voice: "Here you, sir, come back! How dare you! Come
back, I say! Do you take my house for an hotel?"</p>

<p>But Purdy, already on the other side of the gate and limping off
as hard as he could go, only made a half-turn, waved one arm in a
gesture that might have meant anything, and was out of sight. Short
of running down the street in pursuit, or of mixing one of the
children up in it...Beside himself with rage, Richard threw the
note to the ground and stamped on it, then plucking it up, tore it
to bits.</p>

<p>Taking him by the arm, Mary got him indoors. But for long she
could not calm him. (Oh, was there <i>ever</i> such a tactless fool
as Purdy? Or was this just another of those spikey thrusts at
Richard which he seemed unable to resist?)</p>

<p>"Does he think because he's gone up in the world and I've come
down that it gives him the right to insult me in this
way?&mdash;him, the common little ragamuffin I once picked out of
the gutter? (Oh no, Richard!) To come here and offer me alms!...for
that's what it amounts to...pay his few shillingsworth of food with
a present of pounds? Why, I would rather rot in my grave than be
beholden to him!" (Oh, how Richard did at heart despise him!)
"<i>Charity!</i>&mdash;from <i>him</i> to <i>me!</i>"</p>

<p>"He shall never come again, dear." (Though how were you to help
it, if he just walked in?)</p>

<p>Behind the locked door (she seemed always to be locking doors
now) she sat, wide-lapped in her full skirts; and, when Richard had
railed himself tired, he knelt down before her and laid his face on
her dress. Her hands went to and fro over the grey head, on which
the hair was wearing so thin. What could she do for him?...what was
to become of him?...when every small mischance so maddened, so
exasperated him. That a stupid, boorish act like Purdy's could so
shatter his self-control! Her heart wept over him; this heart
which, since the evening before, had lain under the shadow of a new
fear; a fear so ominous that she still did not dare to put it into
words; but against which, for her children's sake, she might need
to take up arms...to lock, so to speak, yet another door.</p>

<p>The upshot of the matter was that she had to replace the
destroyed note by one from her jealously guarded store. This
Richard haughtily sealed up and posted back, without a single
covering word.</p>

<p>There was, however, one bright side to the affair. And again it
was the children who benefited.</p>

<p>In running them out after breakfast to buy some lollipops, Purdy
had got permission from the postmaster, an old friend of his, to
take them up the lighthouse; and so the three of them went up and
up and up a staircase that twisted like a corkscrew, hundreds of
steps, till they came to where the great lamp was that shone at
night; and then, tightly holding hands, they walked round the
little narrow platform outside and looked down at the sea, all
bubbly and frothy, and the white roofs of the houses. They found
their own, and it didn't look any bigger than a doll's-house.
Afterwards they were asked inside the post office&mdash;right
inside!&mdash;and they peeped through the little window where the
stamps were sold, and saw the holes where the letters were kept;
and the two tel'graph machines that went click, click; and how tape
ran away on wheels with little dots and dashes on it, that the
postmaster said were words. And then he took them into his house
behind to see his Mamma and his four grown-up sisters, who were
ever so nice, and asked their names, and said Cuffy <i>was</i> a
big boy for his age, and Luce was a cuddly darling; and they cut a
cake specially for them, and showed them a ship their Papa had made
all by himself, even the little wooden men that stood on the decks.
They laughed and joked with Mr. Purdy, and they had the most lovely
teeth, and sang songs for them till Cuffy was wild with
delight.</p>

<p>Thus, through Purdy's agency, a house was opened to the children
the like of which they had never known: a home over which no shadow
brooded; in which the key was set to laughter and high spirits, and
the nonsensical gaiety that children love. Cuffy and Lucie, petted
and made much of, completely lost their hearts to their new
friends, and talked so much of them, teasing to be allowed to visit
them, that Mary felt it incumbent on her to tie on her bonnet and
pay a call in person. She came back entirely reassured. The
daughters, one and all Australian-born, were charming and
accomplished girls; while in old Mrs. Spence, the widow of an
English university man who in the early days had turned from
unprofitable gold-digging to Government service, she found one who,
in kindliness and tolerance, in humour and common sense, reminded
her vividly of her own mother, long since dead.</p>

<p>To the children this old lady early became "Granny"; and even
Cuffy, who had begun to fight shy of his mother's knee, was not
above sitting on hers. A Granny was diffrunt...didn't make you feel
such a baby. And it was of her kind old face that he eventually
succeeded in asking his famous question.</p>

<p>"Bless the child!...now what can he mean?" Then, noting the
sensitive flush that mounted, Granny cried: "Pauline, come you
here!&mdash;Pauline will know, my dear. She's ever so much cleverer
than a silly old woman like me."</p>

<p>And pretty Pauline&mdash;they were all four so pretty and so
nice that Cuffy couldn't tell which he liked best&mdash;knelt down
before him, he sitting on Granny's lap, and, with her dress
bunching out round her and her hands on his knees, explained,
<i>without laughing a bit</i>. <i>Noblesse oblige</i> didn't mean
the obliging female nobleman at all: he had got it mixed up with
poet and poetess. "What it says, Cuffy dear, is that people who are
born to a high rank...like Kings and Queens...must always remember
who they are and act accordingly. Little gentlemen must always
behave <i>like</i> gentlemen, and never do anything low or mean. Do
you see?"</p>

<p>And Cuffy nodded...and nodded again. Yes, now he knew. And he
never would!&mdash;But he knew something else, too. He loved
Pauline more'n anybody in the world.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-3-3" id="ch-3-3-3"></a>Chapter III</h3>

<p>"There you go...tripping again. You keep one in a perfect
fidget," sighed Mary.</p>

<p>"It's these confounded shoes. They're at least two sizes too
big."</p>

<p>"I told you so! But you were so set on having them easy."</p>

<p>Entering the surgery Mahony kicked the inoffensive slippers from
his feet, and drew on his boots. After which, having opened the
door by a crack, to peer and listen, he stole into the passage to
fetch hat and stick.</p>

<p>But Mary, in process of clearing the breakfast-table, caught him
in the act. "What?...going out already? I declare your consulting
hours become more of a farce every day. Well, at least take the
children with you."</p>

<p>"No, that I can't. They're such a drag."</p>

<p>And therewith he whipped out of the house and down the path, not
slackening his pace till he had turned a corner: Mary was quite
capable of coming after him and hauling him back. And escape he
must&mdash;from the prison cell that was his room; from the laming
surveillance to which she subjected him. Only out of doors, with
the wind sweeping through him, the wild expanse of sea tossing in
the sunlight, could he for a little forget what threatened; forget
her dogging and hounding; enjoy a fictitious peace...dream of
safety...forget&mdash;forget.</p>

<p>He made for the Bluff where, for an hour or more, he wandered to
and fro: from the old grey lighthouse and flagstaff at one end, to
pier and township at the other. He carried his hat in his hand, and
the sea wind played with his fine, longish hair till it stood up
like a halo of feathers round his head. That no chance passer-by
should use them as spy-holes, he kept his eyes glued to the ground;
but at the same time he talked to himself without pause; no longer
mumbling and muttering as of old, but in a clear voice for any to
hear, and stressing his words with forcible gestures: throwing out
an open palm; thumping a closed fist in the air; silencing an
imaginary listener with a contemptuous outward fling of the
hand.</p>

<p>He was obliged to be energetic, for it was Mary he argued with,
Mary he laboured to convince; and this could only be done by means
of a tub-thumper's over-emphasis. Where he was in question. She
believed others readily enough. But he never had her wholly with
him; invariably she kept back some thought or feeling; was very
woman in her want of straightness and simplicity. Even here, while
shouting her down with: "I tell you once for all that it <i>is</i>
so!" he felt that he was not moving her.&mdash;But stay! What was
it he sought to convince her of? Confound the thing! it had slipped
the leash and was gone again: grope as he might, standing
stockstill the while in the middle of the path and glaring
seawards, he could not recapture it. Not that this was anything
new. Nowadays his mind seemed a mere receptacle for disjointed
thoughts, which sprang into it from nowhere, skimmed across it and
vanished...like birds of the air. Birds. Of Paradise.
Parrakeets...their sumptuous green and blue and rosy plumage. You
caught one, clasped it round, and, even as you held it, felt its
soft shape elude you, the slender tail-feathers glide past till but
the empty hole of your curled hand remained. A wonderful flight of
parrakeets he had once seen at...at...now <i>what</i> was the name
of that place?&mdash;a Y and a K, and a Y. Damnation take it! this,
too, had flown; and though he scoured and searched, working letter
by letter through the alphabet: first the initial consonants, then
the companion vowels...fitting them together
&mdash;mnemonics&mdash;artificial memory...failing powers...proper
names went first&mdash;gone, gone!...everything was gone now, lost
in a blistering haze.</p>

<p>Such a frenzied racking of his poor old brain invariably ended
thus...with a mind empty as a drum. And though he crouched, balled
like a spider, ready to pounce on the meagrest image that shewed,
nothing came: the very tension he was at held thought at bay. His
senses on the other hand were strung to a morbid pitch; and little
by little a clammy fear stole over him lest he should never again
know connected thought; be condemned eternally to exist in this
state of vacuity. Or the terror would shift, and resolve itself
into an anticipation of what would, what <i>must</i> happen, to end
the strain. For there was nothing final about it: the blood roared
in his ears, his pulses thudded like a ship's engines, the while he
waited: for a roar fit to burst his eardrums; for the sky to topple
and fall upon his head, with a crash like that of splitting beams.
Thunder&mdash;thunder breaking amid high mountains...echoing and
reechoing...rolling to and fro. Or oneself, with closed eyes and a
cavernous mouth, emitting a scream: a mad and horrid scream that
had nothing human left in it, and the uttering of which would
change the face of things for ever. This might escape him at any
moment; here and now: wind and sea were powerless against
it&mdash;he could feel it swelling...mounting in his throat. He
fought it down: gritted his teeth, balled his fists, his breath
escaping him in hoarse, short jerks. Help, help!...for God's sake,
help!</p>

<p>And help approached...in the shape of a middle-aged woman who
came trapesing along, dragging a small child by the hand.</p>

<p>Swaying round his stick, which he dug into the gravel for a
support, Mahony blocked her way, blurting out incoherencies; in a
panic lest she should pass on, abandon him. "Good morn'g, my good
woman...good morn'g. A pleasant morn'g. Cool breeze. A nice lil
girl you have there. A fine child. Know what I'm saying, speak from
exp'rience...a father myself. Yes, yes, two little girls...golden
curls, healthy, happy. Like criteks...chirking. A boy, too.
Porridge for rickets...you've let yours walk too soon. Nothing like
porridge for forming bone. The Highlanders...main
sustenance...magnif'cent men.&mdash;Eh? What? Well, good day...good
day!"</p>

<p>For, having edged round and past him, the woman grabbed her
child and made off. Not till she had put a safe distance between
them did she stop to look round. "Well, I'm blowed! Of all the rum
ol' cusses!" There he went, without a hat, his hair standing up
anyhow, and talking away nineteen to the dozen. The whole time he'd
spoke to her, too, he'd never so much as took his eyes off the
ground.</p>

<p>In his wake Mahony left a trail of such open mouths. Espying a
man digging a garden, he crossed the road to him and leaned over
the fence. A painter was at work on the beach, re-painting a boat:
he headed for him, wading ankle-deep through the loose, heavy
sand.</p>

<p>Of these, the former spoke up sturdily. "Can't say as I
understand what you're drivin' at, mister, with them sissyfass
stones you tork of. But this I do know: any one who likes can have
<i>my</i> job! An' to-day rather'n to-morrow."</p>

<p>The painter knew the "ol' doctor" by sight and stopped his work
to listen, not impolitely, to certain amazing confidences that were
made him. After which, watching the departing figure, he thrust his
fingers under his cap and vigorously scratched his head. "Crikey!
So <i>that's</i> him, is it? Well, they do say...and dang me! I
b'lieve they're not far wrong."</p>

<p>Dog-tired, footsore, Mahony limped home, his devils exorcised
for the time being. At the gate a little figure was on the watch
for him&mdash;his youngest, his lovely one, towards whom his heart
never failed to warm: her little-girl eyes had nothing of the boy's
harassing stare. Holding her to him he walked up the path. Then:
"Good God! but I said I had two. What...what came over me? The
creature will think I was lying...boasting!" Where should he find
her to put things right?...by explaining that one of the two no
longer wore bodily form; but had been snatched from them amid pain
and distress, the memories of which, thus rudely awakened, he
now&mdash;in the twenty odd yards that divided gate from
door&mdash;re-lived to their last detail, and so acutely that he
groaned aloud.</p>

<p>Hot with the old pity, he laid a tender hand on Mary's shoulder;
and following her into the dining-room ate, meekly and
submissively, what she set before him: without querulous carping,
or fastidious demands for the best bits on the dish. And this
chastened mood holding, he even offered in the course of the
afternoon to walk the children out for her.</p>

<p>Bidden to dress himself, Cuffy obeyed with the worst possible
grace. It was dull enough walking with Mamma, who couldn't tell
stories because she was always thinking things; but when it came to
going out with Papa...well, Mamma never did it herself, and so she
didn't know what it was like. But he couldn't ask to be let stop at
home, because of Luce. He <i>had</i> to be there to pertect Luce,
who was so little and so fat. Mamma was always saying take care of
her.</p>

<p>Papa held their hands and they started quite nice; but soon he
forgot about them, and walked so quick that they nearly had to run
to keep up, and could look at each other across behind him. And
they went round by the bay at the back, where the mussels were, and
heaps of mud, and no waves at all. Luce got tired direckly. Her
face hung down, very red. <i>Somehow</i> he'd got to make Papa go
slower.</p>

<p>"Tell us a story."&mdash;He said it twice before Papa heard.</p>

<p>"A story? Child, I've no stories left in me."</p>

<p>("You ask him, Luce.")</p>

<p>"Tell 'bout when you was a little boy, Papa," piped Lucie, and
trotted a few steps to draw level.</p>

<p>"No, tell 'bout when you first saw Mamma." Luce, she loved to
hear how Papa's big sisters had smacked him and put him to bed
without his supper; but he liked best the story of how Papa had
seen nothing, only Mamma's leg in a white stocking and a funny
black boot, when he saw her first; and it was jumping out of a
window. He'd jumped out, too, and chased her; but then he let her
go and went away; but as soon as he got home he slapped his leg and
called himself a donkey, and hired a horse and galloped ever and
ever so many miles back again, to ask her if she'd like to marry
him. And first she said she was too young, and then she did. He'd
heard it a million times; but it was still exciting to listen
to...how in a hurry Papa had been.</p>

<p>But to-day everything went wrong. Papa began all right; but so
loud that everybody who was passing could hear. But then he got
mixed, and left out the best part, and said the same thing over
again. And then he couldn't remember Aunt Tilly's name, and didn't
listen when they told him, and got furious with himself. He said
he'd be forgetting his own name next, and that would be the end of
everything. And then he jumped on to the funny bit in the arbour
that Mr. Purdy had teased him about, where he'd kissed somebody
called Miss Jinny instead of Mamma...and this really truly
<i>was</i> funny, because Mamma was so little and spindly and Miss
Jinny was fat. But when he came to this he forgot to go on, and
that he was telling them a story, and that they were there, and
everything. He said: "My God! how could I have done such an idiotic
thing?...have made such an unspeakable fool of myself. Took her in
my arms and kissed her&mdash;the wrong girl...the wrong girl. I can
hear them still&mdash;their ribald laughter, their jeers and
guffaws...their rough horseplay. And how she shrank before
them...my shy little Polly!...my little grey dove. I to make her
the butt of their vulgar mirth!" And then he made a noise as if
something hurt him, and talked about pain-spots one shouldn't ever
uncover, but shut up and hide from everybody. And then some more,
in a dreadful hoarse voice, about a scream, and somebody who'd soon
have to scream out loud if he didn't keep a hold on himself.</p>

<p>Cuffy couldn't bear it any longer; he pulled his hand away (Papa
didn't notice) and let Papa and Luce go on alone. He stayed behind
and kicked the yellow road-flowers till all their heads fell off.
But then Luce looked back, and he could see she was crying. So he
had to gallop up and take her hand. And then he called out&mdash;he
simply shouted: "Papa! Lucie's tired. She wants to go home to
Mamma."</p>

<p>"Tired?...my poor little lamb! Such short leggykins! See...Papa
will carry her." And he tried to lift her up, and first he
couldn't, she was so heavy, and when he did, he only staggered a
few steps and then put her down again. Luce had to walk home with
their hands, and all the way back he made haste and asked questions
hard, about the yellow flowers and why they grew on the road, and
why the wind always sang in the treble and never in the bass, and
always the same tune; till they got to the gate. But you didn't
tell how Papa had been...not a word! You were too ashamed.</p>

<p>Shame and fear.</p>

<p>If you were coming home from Granny's, walking nicely, holding
Luce's hand and taking care of her, and if you met a lot of big,
rough, rude boys and girls coming from the State School, what did
you do? Once, you would have walked past them on the other side of
the road, sticking your chin up, and not taking any notice. Now you
still kept on the other side (if you didn't run like mad as soon as
you saw them), but you looked down instead of up, and your face got
so red it hurt you.</p>

<p>For always now what these children shouted after you was: "Who'd
have a cranky doctor for a father?...who'd have a cranky doctor for
a father!" and they sang it like a song, over and over, till you
had gone too far to hear. And you couldn't run away; you
<i>wouldn't</i> have! You squeezed Luce's hand till you nearly
squeezed it off, and whispered: "<i>don't</i> cry, Luce...don't let
them see you cry." And Luce sniffed and sniffed, trying not to.</p>

<p>You didn't tell this either; nor even speak to Luce about it.
You just tried to pretend to yourself you didn't know. Like once
when Miss Prestwick was new and had taken them too long a walk at
Barambogie, and Luce hadn't liked to ask, and had had an accident:
he'd been ever so partic'lar then not to look at her; he'd kept his
head turned right round the other way. That was "being a
gentleman." But this about Papa...though you tried your hardest to
be one here, too, you couldn't help it; it was always there. Like
as if you'd cut your finger and a little clock ticked inside. And
being good didn't help either; for it wasn't your <i>fault</i>, you
hadn't <i>done</i> anything. And yet were ever so ashamed...about
somebody...who wasn't you...yet belonged to you. Somebody people
thought silly and had to laugh at...for his funny walk...and the
way he talked.&mdash;Oh, <i>why</i> had one's Papa got to be like
this? Other children's Papas weren't. They walked
about...properly...and if they met you they said: "Hullo!" or "How
do you do?"</p>

<p>Something else wormed in him. Once in Barambogie he had seen a
dreadful-looking boy, with his mouth open and his tongue hanging
out, and bulgy eyes like a fish. And when he'd asked Maria she
said, oh, he was just cranky and an idjut. But Papa wasn't like
<i>that!</i> The thought that any one could think he was, was too
awful to bear.</p>

<p>"What's it really mean, Bridget, cranky?" he asked, out of this
pain, of the small servant-girl.</p>

<p>And Bridget, who was little more than a child herself, first
looked round to make sure that her mistress was not within hearing,
then mysteriously put her mouth to his ear and whispered: "It
means...<i>what your pa is.</i>"</p>

<p>Granny, on whose knee he sat, held him from her for an instant,
then snatched him close. "Why bother your little head with such
things?"</p>

<p>"I just want to know."</p>

<p>As usual Granny turned to Pauline for aid; and Pauline came over
to them and asked "Who's been saying things to you, my dear? Take
no notice, Cuffy. Oh, well, it just means...different&mdash;yes,
that's what it means: different from other people." But he saw her
look at Granny and Granny at her; and his piece of cake was extra
big that day, and had more currants in it than Luce's.</p>

<p>But a "diffrunt doctor" didn't mean anything at all.</p>

<p>But now you and Luce never stopped running all the way home, and
you went a long way round, so as not to have to go down the street
where the State School was. And when Papa took you for a walk, you
<i>chose</i> the hidjus way at the back. When all the time you
might have gone on the real beach, by the real sea.</p>

<p>For what a lovely place this would have been, if it hadn't been
for Papa. There wasn't any wattle here to shut your eyes and smell
and smell at and you couldn't smell the sun either, like in
Barambogie. But the beach and the sea made up for everything. You
could have played on the beach till you died. The sand was hot and
yellow and so soft that it felt like a silk dress running through
your fingers; and there were big shells with the noise of the sea
in them, and little ones with edges like teeth; and brown and green
and red and pink seaweed; and pools to paddle in; and caves to
explore when the tide went out. And soon lots of little boys and
girls&mdash;<i>nice</i> ones&mdash;who you could have played with
if you had been allowed, came to the seaside, too. But Mamma always
said: keep to yourselves. Which meant there was only him and Luce.
And then you learned to swim. The bathing-woman said you were a
born fish; and you wished you were: then you could have stopped in
the water for ever&mdash;and never have needed to go home
again&mdash;or for walks with Papa.</p>

<p>Fear. All sorts of fears.</p>

<p>One was, when he lay in bed at night and listened to the wind,
which never stopped crying. Mamma said it was because the room was
at a corner of the house, and the corner caught the wind; but
Bridget said it was dead people: the noise people made when they
were dead. "But my little sister Lallie's dead!" "Well, then, it's
her you hear." (But Lallie had never cried like that.) But Bridget
said it was the voice of her soul in torment, hot in hell; and
though he <i>knew</i> this wasn't true, because Lallie was in
heaven, he couldn't help thinking about it at night, when he was
awake in the dark. Then it did sound like a voice&mdash;lots of
voices&mdash;and as if they were crying and sobbing because they
were being hurt. Other times it seemed as if the wind was
screeching just at him, very angry, and getting angrier and
angrier, till he had to sit up in bed and call out (not too loud
because of Luce): "Oh! what's the matter?" But it didn't stop: it
just went on. And even if you stuffed your fingers in both your
ears, you couldn't shut it out; it was too treble. Till you
couldn't stand it any longer, and jumped out of your own bed and
went to Luce's, and lifted the blankets and got in beside
her&mdash;she was always fast asleep&mdash;and held on to her
little fat back. And then you went to sleep, too.</p>

<p>But Mamma was cross in the morning when she came in and found
you: she said it wasn't nice to sleep two in one bed.</p>

<p>"But you and Papa do!"</p>

<p>"That's quite different. A big double bed."</p>

<p>"Couldn't Luce and me have a double bed, too?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Mamma; and was ashamed of him for being
afraid of the dark. Which he wasn't.</p>

<p>Worse still were those nights when he had to lie and think about
what was going to happen to them when all their money was done.
Mamma didn't know; she often said: "What is to become of us?" And
it was Papa's fault. They never ought to have come to live here;
they ought to have gone to a place called Narrong, where there was
plenty of money; but Papa wouldn't; so now they hadn't enough, and
quite soon mightn't have any at all. Perhaps not anything to eat
either. His mind threw up a picture of Luce crying for bread, which
so moved him that he had to hurry on. Maria's mother had taken in
washing. But you couldn't think of Mamma doing that: standing at
the tubs and mangling and ironing, and getting scolded if the
buttons came off. No, he wouldn't ever let her! He'd hold her
hands, so that she couldn't use the soap. Or else he'd pour the
water out of the tubs.</p>

<p>But <i>quite</i> the most frightening thing was, when no more
money was left, Mamma and Papa might have to go to prison. Once,
when he was little, he'd heard them talking about somebody who
couldn't pay his debts, and so had cheated people and been put in
gaol. And this dim memory returning now to torture him, he rolled
and writhed, in one of childhood's hellish agonies. <i>what</i>
would he and Luce do? How could they get up in the morning and have
breakfast, and know what to put on, or what they were to practise,
without Mamma and&mdash;no! <i>just</i> without Mamma. And though
he might talk big and say he wouldn't let her be a washerwoman, yet
inside him he knew quite well he was only a little boy, and not a
bit of use, <i>really</i>. If the sergeant came and said she had to
go to prison, nothing he could do would stop her. Oh,
Mamma...Mamma! She alone, her dear, substantial presence, stood
guard between him and his shadowy throng of fears. And now, when he
and Lucie raced home hand in hand of an afternoon, their first
joint impulse was to make sure of Mamma: to see that she was still
there...hadn't gone out, or...been taken away. Only close up to
where she stood, radiating love and safety, a very pillar of
strength, was it possible for their fragile minds to sustain,
uninjured, the grim tragedy that overhung their home, darkening the
air, blotting out the sun, shattering to ruin all accustomed
things; in a fashion at once monstrous and incredible.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-3-3-4" id="ch-3-3-4"></a>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>As if struck by a beneficent blindness, Mary, alone unseeing,
alone unsuspecting, held to her way. And, in excuse of her wilful
ignoring of many a half-thought and passing impression, her care to
keep these from coming to consciousness, there was this to be said:
she knew Richard so well. Who but she had endured, for the better
part of a lifetime, his whimsies, his crotchets? When had she ever
thought of him, or spoken of him, but as queer, freakish,
eccentric? Hence, was it now to be wondered at that, as age crept
on and added its quota, his peculiarities should wax rather than
wane? The older, the odder seemed but natural to her, who had never
looked for anything else.</p>

<p>Meanwhile October passed into November, November into December;
and one day&mdash;overnight, as it seemed&mdash;the season was upon
them. The houses on either side were full of new faces; there was
hardly a spare seat in church on Sunday; you had to wait your turn
for a cabin at the baths. And the deck of the little steamer, which
came daily, was crowded with lively, white-clad people. Now was the
time...if ever...for Richard's fortunes to turn.</p>

<p>But the days dragged by in the old monotony; not a single new
patient knocked at the door. Instead, by the end of the week Mary
had definite information that old Barker was being called out
again. Yes, people were actually preferring this antediluvian old
man to Richard. And could one altogether blame them? Who would want
to consult a doctor who went about talking to himself, and without
a hat?...who omitted to brush his hair or brush the fluff off his
coat-collar, and thought nothing of appearing in public with a
two-days' growth on his chin? She could imagine landladies and
hotel-keepers advising their guests: "Oh, I shouldn't have
<i>him</i>, if I were you. Extremely queer! Goes nowhere."</p>

<p>Boarders. It was boarders or nothing now...and not a moment to
lose either, with a season that lasted for a bare three months.
Like the majority of people in Shortlands, she would have to seize
the chance and make money while she could, by throwing open her
house to strangers. Grimly she tied on her bonnet and went down
into the township, to hang out her name and her terms as a
boarding-housekeeper; to face the curious looks, the whispers and
raised eyebrows: what?...the grand Mrs. Mahony?...reduced to taking
in lodgers? Not till she got home again did she know how high she
had carried her head, how rigidly set her jaw, over the taking of
this step which would once have seemed like the end of the world to
her. But, true to herself, she refused to allow her strength to be
sapped by vain regrets. Instead, she turned with stubborn energy to
the re&mdash;arrangement of her house. If Richard and she moved
into the children's bedroom, and the children slept in a small
inner room lit by a skylight, she would have two good-sized
bedrooms to let, in which she could put up as many as four to five
people. At two guineas a head this would bring in ten a week. Ten
guineas a week for three months!...of which not a penny should pass
out of her own hands.</p>

<p>On the day this happened&mdash;and in the swiftness and secrecy
of her final decision there was something that resembled a dash of
revenge&mdash;on this day, Richard was out as usual all the
morning, strolling about on cliffs or beach. And though he came
home to dinner, he was in one of his most vacant moods, when he
just sat and ate&mdash;ravenously&mdash;noticing nothing of what
went on around him.&mdash;But anyhow she would not at this eleventh
hour have started to thresh the matter out with him. Better, first
to get everything irrevocably fixed and settled.</p>

<p>Perhaps, though, she had a dim foreboding of what awaited her.
For the next time he came back he was wider awake, and took in the
situation at a glance. And then there was a scene the like of which
she had never known. He behaved like a madman, stamping and
shouting about the house, abusing her, and frightening the poor
children out of their wits. In vain she followed him, reasoning,
arguing, throwing his own words in his teeth: had the idea not been
his, originally? Besides, what else was left for her to do, with no
patients, no money coming in, and old Barker resuming practice? He
would not listen. Frenzy seized him at the thought of his
threatened privacy: strangers to occupy his bedroom, hang their
hats in the passage, go in and out of his front door. Not as long
as <i>he</i> lived! "My mother...my sisters...the old home in
Dublin&mdash;<i>they</i> would sooner have starved!" And as he
spoke he sent hat and stick flying across the hall table, and the
brass card-tray clattering to the floor. He kicked it to one side,
and with an equally rough push past Mary, who had stooped to
recover it, banged into the surgery and locked the door. And there
he remained. She could neither get at him nor get a word out of
him.</p>

<p>Late that night the children, their parents' neighbours now, sat
miserably huddled up together. Lucie had been fast asleep; but
Cuffy had so far only managed to doze uneasily, in this funny room
where the window was in the roof instead of the wall: he was quite
sure something would look in at him through it, or else fall down
on his head. Now they sat and clung to each other,
listening...listening...their little hearts pounding in their
chests. "Oh, <i>don't</i>, Papa! Oh, what's he doing to her?" To
which Cuffy gave back sturdily: "I don't hear anything, Luce, truly
I don't!" "Oh, yes, you do! And now I'll know she go away...Mamma
will...and leave us." "No, she won't. She told me so
yesterday&mdash;promised she wouldn't ever!" Though his teeth were
chattering with fear.</p>

<p>For Mary had at last reached what seemed the limits of human
endurance. After pleading and imploring; after reasoning, as with a
little child: after stabbing him with bitter words, and achieving
nothing but to tear and wound her own heart, she gave it up, and,
turning bodily from him, as she had already turned in mind and
deed, she crushed her face into the pillow and gave way, weeping
till she could weep no more; as she had not wept since the death of
her child. But on this night no loving arms reached out to her, to
soothe and console. Richard might have been made of stone: he lay
stockstill, unmoved, staring with glassy eyes into the
moonlight.</p>

<p>From sheer exhaustion she thought she must have sunk into a
momentary unconsciousness; for, coming to with a start, she found
the place beside her empty. Throwing back the sheet she jumped to
the floor, her temples a-throb, and ran into the hall. There, among
the lines and squares of greenish moonshine that filtered through
the open doors of the rooms, stood Richard, a tall white figure,
just as he had got out of bed. He was at the front door, fingering
the lock, plainly on the point of leaving the house. Abominably
frightened, but mindful of the sleeping children, she called to him
under her breath: "<i>Richard!</i> What are you doing?"</p>

<p>He did not answer: she had to go up to him and shake his arm.
"What's the matter? Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To find peace."</p>

<p>So gaunt and old...the ribbed neck and stooping shoulders...the
poor thin shanks: and once, he, too, had been young, and handsome,
and upstanding. As always, did she compare present with past, an
immense compassion swept through Mary, driving every smaller,
meaner feeling before it. She put out her arms, put them round him,
to hold, to protect. "Oh, but not like this...and at this hour.
Wait till morning. Come back and try to sleep. Come, my dear,
come!"</p>

<p>But he resisted her. Only by dint of half pushing, half pulling,
did she manage to get him back to bed. He seemed dazed; as if he
were moving in a dream. And though, during the hours that followed,
she sometimes believed he slept, she herself did not dare to close
her eyes, so great was the fright he had given her.</p>

<p>But Mahony slept as little as she did. With his back to her,
withdrawn from any chance contact, he merely put into practice an
art learned in scores of wakeful nights: that of lying taut as the
dead, while the long hours ticked away. Let her think what she
chose...think him asleep&mdash;<i>or</i> dead...as long as she held
her cruel tongue. His hatred of her passed imagining: his mind was
a seething cauldron of hate and fury. Fury with himself. For he had
been within an ace of deliverance, of getting through that door;
beyond which lay everything his heart desired:
space...freedom...peace. One and all drenched in the moon's serene
light. This light it was that drew him; affecting him as do certain
scenes or people which, on seeing them for the first time, you feel
you have known long since...in dreams, in a dream life. The sea,
too, lay without. Seas...silvered masses...leaping and tumbling
under a great round moon. And then, at the last moment, he had been
baulked of his freedom by the knowledge that he was grown too tall
for the doorway. To pass through it he would have needed to risk
knocking his head against the doorpost, or to stoop; and to-night
either alternative was beyond him. His poor head felt so queer...so
queer. Top-heavy, yet weightless as a toy balloon. Already on first
laying it down, he had had the old sensation of sinking through the
pillow; of falling head-foremost into nothingness. Hence he dared
not risk a blow; or the dizzy fit stooping would entail. And so he
had been caught and dragged back; made a prisoner of...yet once
more. But this time should be the last. Revenge!...revenge is
sweet. Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord: I will repay. Fill the
house with strangers, would she?&mdash;<i>his</i> house? Cut the
ground from under his feet? &mdash;deprive him of his only
haven?...why! even a rabbit had its burrow. To be without covert;
to know no place to creep to for hiding, when the fit, the burning
need of escape seized him?&mdash;And then his eyes. What in God's
name should he do with his eyes? Strangers at his table? On your
p's and q's with strangers; aye, and on the watch, too, lest they
should find you out. And for all this he had only Mary to
thank&mdash;Mary, who might have been expected to show mercy. She?
As well ask blood of a stone.&mdash;And now such a paroxysm of
hatred shook him: the outcome, solidified, intensified, of
thousands of conflicts; of the ceaseless clash and war of their
opposing temperaments: that it was all he could do to master the
itch his fingers felt to close round her throat. But he would be
even with her yet!...somehow...somehow...though he did not yet know
how. But...<i>it would have to do with money</i>! For it was money
she was after: with her it had always been money, from first to
last. What new tricks was she hatching this time? Was it going to
<i>cost</i> money to take these lodgers in? Or was she doing it to
<i>make</i> money? He was so confused to-night; his poor brain
seemed smothered in cobwebs. But it didn't matter, either way would
do. As long as he remembered that <i>it had to do with money</i>.
And surely, surely, the long night would now soon end, and day
break, and he be free to get up and set about what had to be done.
(His home, his poor home, his sole refuge...eyes...greenish eyes in
the moonlight, coming towards him, and, most horribly, without any
accompanying face.) First, though, he would have to pull himself
together to endure in silence, without an answering shriek, the
blast of the mill-whistle&mdash;that thrice-accursed, infernal din!
Not much more than an hour now, till it was due to sound.</p>

<p>At breakfast he sat silent, seemed lost in thought. And Mary, to
whom the dark hours had brought no clearness&mdash;every way she
turned seemed barred to her&mdash;watched him, the passion of pity
that had been wakened by the sight of his poor old scraggy form at
the door in the moonlight, trying to escape from her&mdash;from
<i>her!</i>&mdash;still hot in her.</p>

<p>But the meal over, he roused to a kind of life. Taking his
little favourite on his knee, he caressed her. And then, of a
sudden, he grew solicitous about the children: their morning walk,
their daily dip in the sea. "Or"&mdash;to Lucie this, as he rocked
her to and fro&mdash;"we shall not have them growing up tall and
sturdy!" (If only he could hold on to the fact that <i>it had to do
with money</i>.)</p>

<p>"Trust me to look after them," said Mary shortly, at a third
repetition. Her own thoughts ran: If I can't talk to some one I
shall go crazy. Something will have to be done. I know. There's old
Mrs. Spence. She is so wise.</p>

<p>Would he never be rid of them? It seemed this morning as if Mary
deliberately invented jobs to detain them. He fell to pacing the
dining-room, his arms a-swing...and each time he came to the window
he lifted his eyes in alarm, lest the flag should have run up the
flagstaff. A ship at this moment would ruin everything.</p>

<p>But...softly! Mary was growing suspicious. "Are you stopping at
home then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I'm staying in. I'll look after the house." (Ha,
ha!)</p>

<p>And at last gowns and towels, spades and buckets were collected,
the children's hats and her bonnet tied on, and off they went. It
was a radiant summer morning, with a light breeze playing, but Mary
saw nothing of it: her brain continued its feverish work, in the
hope of finding some way out. Suppose I induced him to leave home
for a time?&mdash;to go away for a holiday?...and so get the house
to myself. Or even persuaded him to put up at an hotel. But before
she had gone any distance, she became aware of such a strange inner
excitement that it was only with difficulty she mastered an impulse
to turn and go back to the house. Why had he been so anxious to get
rid of them? Why this sudden odd concern for the
children?&mdash;and here there leapt in her mind a story she had
once read, or heard, of somebody who had sent his wife and his
children out for a walk, and then deliberately hanged himself on a
nail behind the scullery-door. But, this half-born apprehension
spoken out, she fell righteously foul of herself: her reason, her
common sense, that part of her which had waged a life-long war with
the fantastic, the incorporeal, rose in arms. Such <i>nonsense</i>
Really...if one once began to let oneself go...(Besides, wasn't
Bridget constantly in and out of the scullery?) Imaginings like
these came solely from want of sleep. How angry Richard would be,
too, if she reappeared!</p>

<p>So she went on, as usual making Cuffy the scapegoat for her
nervous perplexity. "Don't eat your bathing-dress, you naughty boy!
How often am I to tell you..."</p>

<p>"I'm <i>not</i> eating it! Only smelling."&mdash;He did though,
some times. (And his sponge, too.)</p>

<p>"Well, that's not nice either."</p>

<p>"It <i>is!</i> It's scrumptious," cried Cuffy warmly. How did
Mamma know?...she never bathed. The salty smell&mdash;and the
taste&mdash;of damp blue serge when it was hot with the
sun&mdash;ooh! too lovely for words. If he put it to his nose he
could hardly keep his legs from running: it made him shiver all
over, simply not able to <i>wait</i>, to be in the water. And
directly they came to the Bluff he bolted: shot along the narrow
wooden bridge that ran out from the beach, past the counter where
gowns and towels were for hire, and into the Baths, where nothing
but gowns and towels were hanging on the rails to dry, all one big
salty smell. And you poked your nose into every empty cabin, to
find a dry one; and then, hi! off with your clothes before Luce and
Mamma got there, and into your gown, hot with the sun, and all
prickly and tickly; and then you galloped round the platforms and
out on the spring-board, which bounced you ever so high in the air,
into water they said was fifteen feet deep, but you didn't know,
only if you jumped straight, and made yourself quite stiff, you
went down and down, and took ever such a time to come up. Then you
swam back to the steps&mdash;they were all slimy, and with seaweed
washing round them, for they weren't ever out of the
water&mdash;and up and off the board again, again and again, till
it was time to fetch Luce, who was afraid to jump springboard.</p>

<p>"If I'm not back in an hour make them come out," Mary instructed
the fat bathing-woman, who knew what young water-rats the chicks
were, and could be trusted to use force if necessary.&mdash;And
with this she turned to go.</p>

<p>But she had done no more than set foot on the wooden causeway,
when she saw some one dash on to it from the other end, push rudely
past a group of people, a servant it was...and it was
<i>Bridget</i>, with her hair half down, in her dirty morning
apron...and she came rushing up to her and seized her hand, and
pulled her by it, and sobbed and cried, for every one to hear: "Oh,
Mrs. Mahony, come home!...come home quick! The doctor's bin and
lighted a fire on the surgery table. He's burning the house
down!"</p>

<p>"Bridget!"</p>

<p>Her heart, which had begun to hammer at first sight of the girl,
gave a gigantic bound, then seemed to stop beating: she had to lean
against the wooden railing and press both hands to it, to get it to
restart. But, even so, she heard her own voice saying: "Be quiet!
Don't make such a noise. There are people...I'm coming, I'm
coming."</p>

<p>Home! Uphill, through loose, clogging sand; a short cut over the
grass of the gardens; along one reddish street and into another,
and round into a third; hampered at every step by her long, heavy
woman's clothing; not daring to run, for fear of exciting comment,
struggling even yet, for Richard's sake, to keep up appearances;
the perspiration glistening below her bonnet, her breath coming
stormily; but with only one thought: that of being in time to save
him. At her side Bridget, gasping out her story. If it hadn't bin
that he hadn't had no matches, she'd never have known. But he'd had
to come to the kitchen for some, and she'd seen at once there was
something in the wind. He'd looked at her, oh, ever so queer! And
first he'd tried to take 'em without her seeing him...and when she
had, he'd laughed, and had went up the passage laughing away to
himself. She'd gone after him on tiptoe to see what he was up to,
and she'd peeped through the crack of the door, and he'd got that
black tin box of his open, and was taking papers and tied-up things
out of it, piling 'em on the table, and striking matches and
setting fire to 'em. Holy Mother o' God, <i>how</i> she'd run!</p>

<p>There was smoke in the passage. The surgery was full of it; full
of bits of flying ash and burnt papers. Through this she saw
Richard. He stood at the table, the deal top of which was scorched
and blackened, his dispatch-box open and empty before him, his
hands in a heap of ashes which he was strewing about the room. He
laughed and shouted. She heard her own name.</p>

<p>"<i>Richard!</i> My God! What have you done?"</p>

<p><i>Mary?</i>...Mary's voice? Recoiling, he threw up his arms as
if to ward off a blow, looking round at her with a face that was
wry and contorted. At the sight of her standing in the doorway, he
tried to shake his fist at her; but his arm crumpled up, refused to
obey; tried to hurl a scurrilous word...to spit at her: in vain.
What did happen was the thing against which, waking and sleeping,
he had battled with every atom of his failing self-control: there
escaped him, at long last, the scream, the insane scream, which
signified the crossing of the rubicon. And, as it broke loose,
ringing in his ears like the bestial cry of a wounded, maddened
animal, everything turned black before his eyes. He lost his
balance, staggered, caught at a chair and went down, with the chair
on top of him, like an ox felled by a single blow of the pole-axe.
And there he lay, in a confused and crumpled heap on the floor.</p>

<p>And Mary, whom no audible sound had reached, who had read into
the outward fling of his arm towards her only an appeal for help,
for support, was on her knees beside him, her bonnet awry, her
dress in disarray, crushing the poor old head to her breast and
crying: "Richard! My <i>darling!</i> What is it, oh, what is
it?"</p>

<p>But to these words, with which she had so often sought
enlightenment, sought understanding, there was now no reply.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-3-5" id="ch-3-3-5"></a>Chapter V</h3>

<p>His stertorous breathing could be heard through the house.
Except for this, he might have been dead...behind the snow-white
dimity and muslin hangings which she had put up in honour of those
strangers who would now never cross the threshold. For Bowes-Smith,
the well-known Melbourne physician whom she had called in on the
advice of Dr. Barker &mdash;yes! with Richard lying senseless at
her feet she had forgotten everything but his need, and had sent
Bridget flying for the old man whom she had borne so bitter a
grudge; and he had come at once, and been kindness itself. So
active, too: it was hard to believe that he was between twenty and
thirty years Richard's senior&mdash;oh, how <i>did</i> some people
manage to live so long and be so healthy! But in spite of his
consoling words, she could see that he took a very grave view of
Richard's case. And Bowes-Smith and he had had a sheerly endless
consultation&mdash;from which, of course, they shut her
out&mdash;after which the former had broken it to her that, even if
he recovered from the present fit, Richard would remain more or
less of a sick man for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>The utmost care was essential; an entire absence of excitement.
"For I cannot conceal from you that such apoplectiform attacks,
which&mdash;as in this case&mdash;differ little or not at all from
true apoplexy, will be liable to recur."</p>

<p>He stood on the dining-room hearthrug, tall, lugubrious,
sandy-whiskered, holding his gold-rimmed pince-nez in his hand, and
tapping the air with it while he cast about for words, which came
laboriously. They had known him well in the old days, and she
remembered this habit; it had always made him seem something of a
bore. Now it maddened her. For she was keyed up to hear the truth,
learn the worst; and to be obliged to sit there, listening to him
stumbling and fumbling! He was so bland, too, so non-committal; how
differently he would have talked to Richard had she lain ill. But
she was only a woman; and, doctors being what they were...oh, she
knew something about them from the inside. Usen't Richard to say
that it was etiquette in the profession to treat a patient's
relatives, and particularly his womenfolk, as so many cretins?</p>

<p>Ignoring her blunt question: "But if it isn't true apoplexy,
then what is it?" Bowes-Smith proceeded deliberately to catechise
her.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Mrs. Mahony, whether you are...h'm...whether it
is...er...news to you that I saw your husband some two or three
months back? He...er...consulted me, at the time, with regard
to...h'm...to an attack...nay, to recurring attacks of vertigo. I
found him then under no...h'm...no delusion as to his own state. He
said nothing to you? Did not take you into his confidence?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing," said Mary dully: and inconsequently remembered
the letter she had had from Richard when she was trying to induce
him to settle in Narrong. She hadn't known then what to believe;
more than half suspected him of writing as he did to further his
own ends.</p>

<p>"And you have not noticed anything...h'm...out of the way? There
has been no marked change in his habits? No...er...oddness, or
eccentricity?" The questions lumbered along, she sitting the while
fiercely knotting her fingers.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she said again. Adding, though, in spite of herself:
"But then he has always been so peculiar. If he did seem a little
odder of late, I merely put it down to his growing old."</p>

<p>"Quite so...er...most natural." (She was keeping things back, of
course; wives always did. He remembered her well: a handsome
creature she had been when last he saw her. The eyes were still
very striking.) "And now...er...with regard to the present attack.
Are you aware of anything having happened to...er...cause him undue
excitement...or agitation?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mary staunchly. How could it matter now, what had
brought the fit on? Wild horses would not have dragged from her any
allusion to their bitter quarrel of the night before. That would
have meant turning out, to this stranger, the dark side of their
married life. However, she again glossed over the bluntness of her
denial with: "But he was always one to work himself up over
trifles."</p>

<p>"Well, well! My colleague here...and if, at any time, you would
care to see me again, I am entirely at your disposal." (No need to
trouble the poor creature with more, at present. Yes, truly, a
magnificent pair of optics!) "Do not be...h'm...alarmed at any
slight...er...stiffness or rigidity of the limbs that may ensue.
That will pass."</p>

<p>And I a doctor's wife! thought Mary hotly. Aloud she said: "Oh,
I'm not afraid&mdash;of paralysis or anything&mdash;as long as he
is spared." And while the two men confabbed anew, she went to the
bedroom and stood looking down at Richard. Her own husband...and
she could not even be told frankly what was the matter with him.
For twenty-five years and more she had had him at her side, to give
the truth if she asked for it. She had never known till now how
much this meant to her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she spilt no jot of her strength in brooding or
repining: every act, every thought was concentrated on him alone.
And not till the first signs of betterment appeared: when the
dreadful snoring ceased and his temperature fell to normal; when
his eyes began to follow her about the room; when he was able to
move one hand to point to what he wanted: not till then did she sit
down, cold and grim, to face the future.</p>

<p>"My God! what's to become of us?"</p>

<p>A pitiful forty-odd pounds standing to his credit in a Melbourne
Bank, and her own poor remnant of Tilly's loan, was literally all
they had in the world. In that last mad holocaust everything else
had gone: deeds and mortgages, letters and securities, down to the
last atom of scrip. He had piled and burnt till the dispatch-box
was empty. (Who would now be able to prove what shares he had held?
Or how much had been paid off on the mortgage?) The house at
Barambogie was still on their hands; and almost the whole of their
lease at Shortlands had still to run. How were these rents to be
met?...and what would happen if they weren't? She would need expert
advice, probably have to employ a lawyer &mdash;a thought that made
her shiver. For she had the natural woman's fear of the law and its
followers: thought of these only in terms of bills of costs...and
sharp, dishonest practices.</p>

<p>But that must all come later. The burning question was, where to
turn for ready money. The little she had would go nowhere:
Richard's illness...presents to the doctors, the servant's
wages&mdash;nor could they live on air. Boarders were out of the
question now: for Richard's sake. <i>What</i> could she do? What
did other women do who were left in her plight, with little
children dependent on them? Driving her mind back, she saw that as
a rule these "widows and things" were content to live at somebody
else's expense, to become the limpets known as "poor relations,"
leaving the education of their children to a male relative. But she
had not been Richard's wife for nothing. At the mere thought of
such a thing, her back stiffened. Never! Not as long as she had a
leg to stand on...mere woman though she was.</p>

<p>IT'S NOT MONEY I WANT THIS TIME, TILLY, she wrote: and Tilly was
but one of many who, the news of Richard's breakdown having spread
abroad as on an invisible telegraph, came forward with offers of
help. IT'S WORK. I DON'T CARE WHAT; IF ONLY I CAN EARN ENOUGH TO
KEEP US TOGETHER. But here even Tilly's ingenuity failed her: women
of Mary's standing (let alone her advanced age, her inexperience)
did not turn out of their sheltered homes and come to grips with
the world. Impossible, utterly impossible, was to be read between
the lines of her reply.</p>

<p>And, as day after day went by without enlightenment, it began to
look as if Tilly was right. Beat her brains as she would, Mary
would find no way out.</p>

<p>To old Mrs. Spence, who in this crisis had proved a friend
indeed, she finally made a clean breast of her despair.</p>

<p>"There seems literally nothing a woman <i>can</i> do. Except
teach&mdash;and I'm too old for that. Nor have I the brains. I was
married so young. And had so little schooling myself. No, the plain
truth is, I'm fit for nothing. Really there come moments when I can
see us all ending in the Benevolent Asylum."</p>

<p>It was here that Mrs. Spence, nodding her sage, white-capped
head in sympathy, made the tentative suggestion: "I wonder, my
dear...has it never occurred to you to try to enter Government
service?"</p>

<p>Mary winced...she hoped not too perceptibly. "Oh, I'm afraid
that again would need more brains than I've got." It was well
meant, of course, but...<i>so</i> to cut oneself adrift!</p>

<p>Undaunted the old lady went on. "Plenty of women before you have
done it. As a postmistress, you would have a house rent-free, with
free lighting and firing, all sorts of perquisites, and a fixed
salary. And I think, my dear, with the many friends you have at
court, it would be easy for you to skip preliminaries. My son, I
know, would be only too happy to help you in any way he could."</p>

<p>"You're very kind. But I feel sure I'm too old...and too
stupid."</p>

<p>But that night, as she tossed wakeful on the hard little bed she
had set up beside Richard's, her friend's words came back to her,
and rang in her ears till they had effectually chased away all
chance of sleep: so spurred and pricked her, in fact, that she sat
up in bed and, hunching her knees, propped her elbows on them and
dug her clenched fists into her chin. A house rent-free...nothing
to pay for light and firing...a fixed salary&mdash;she didn't know
how much, of course, but it would need to be enough to support a
family on, so many postmasters being married men. It would also
mean that she could keep Richard and the children with her; and the
fear of having to part from them was the worst she knew. And then
those rents, those dreadful rents, which hung round her neck like
millstones...might she not perhaps...But, oh! the come-down...the
indignity...the <i>publicity</i> of the thing &mdash;in this colony
where she had been so well known. A postmistress...she, a
postmistress!...forced to step out into the open, become a kind of
public woman. To see her name&mdash;<i>Richard's</i> name&mdash;in
printed lists, in official communications. (She might even have to
tell her age.) Men&mdash;strange men&mdash;would be over her, she
their subordinate, answerable to them for what she did. Worse
still, she herself would have men under her, young men of a class
with which she had never come in contact. What would her friends
and acquaintances say, to see her sink like this in the social
scale? (At which her native plain-dealing jogged her elbow with the
reflection that it would soon shew who were true friends, and who
not.) Oh, it was easy to <i>say</i> you didn't mind what you turned
your hand to. But when it came to doing it!&mdash;And then, too,
suppose she wasn't equal to the work? As she had said, and truly,
she had no faith in her own abilities. Directly it came to book or
head-learning, she thought of herself as dull and slow. Though
here, oddly enough, the thought perked up and declined to be
quenched that, if Richard had only let her have a say, however
small, in the management of his affairs, these might never have got
into the muddle they had. Figures didn't come hard to her.</p>

<p>Thus was she tossed and torn, between a womanly repugnance, her
innate self-distrust, and her sound common sense. And she got up in
the morning still having failed to reconcile the combatants. It was
the sight of Richard that determined her. When she saw him sitting
propped up among his pillows, his lower jaw on the shake; when she
heard his pitiful attempts to say what he wanted&mdash;like a
little child he was having to be taught the names of things all
over again&mdash;when she looked at this wreck, every other
consideration fell away. What did she matter?...what did anything
or anybody matter?&mdash;if only she could restore to health and
contrive to keep, in something of the comfort he had been used to,
this poor old comrade of the years.</p>

<p>Henry Ocock held office in the present ministry; and it was to
Mr. Henry she turned; for they had a common bond in the memory of
poor Agnes. She wrote, without hedging, of Richard's utter physical
collapse; of the loss&mdash;through fire&mdash;of his papers and
securities; the urgent necessity she was under of finding
employment. It had been suggested to her that she might try to
enter Government service. Would he, for the sake of their old
friendship, do her the great kindness to use his influence, on her
behalf, with the present Postmaster General? Mr. Spence, in charge
of the local office, had offered her the preliminary training. Had
this not been so...FOR I TELL YOU PLAINLY I COULD NEVER GO IN FOR
AN EXAMINATION&mdash;TRY TO PASS THE CIVIL SERVICE OR ANYTHING OF
THAT SORT. IT WOULD BE QUITE BEYOND ME.</p>

<p>Almost by return she held a page-long telegram in her hand, in
which, making no attempt (as she had half feared he would) to press
a loan on her, Mr. Henry said that he was only too happy to be able
to help her. Her request came in the nick of time. An up-country
vacancy was on the point of occurring. Did she think she could be
ready, with Spence's aid, to' take over charge there, say, in six
weeks' time? If so, the P.M.G. would put in a relieving officer for
that period. The rush and hurry of the thing cut the ground from
under her feet. Hardly knowing whether she stood on her head or her
heels, she straightway telegraphed acceptance.&mdash;And so the die
was cast.</p>

<p>Henceforward she was a member of the working classes. To begin
with, she spent every afternoon from two till six at the
Shortlands' post office, learning her job.</p>

<p>The calvary this was to her, none but she knew. She would never
have believed she was so sensitive, so touchy. A host of prejudices
(many of them no doubt imbibed from Richard) which she hadn't even
been aware of possessing, woke to life in her. The very fact of
being tied down to leave home at a set hour, like any clerk or
shopman, seemed to humiliate her, who had never come and gone but
at her own sweet will. Then, every one in the township knew, of
course, where she was bound for. People eyed her and whispered
about her, and pointed her out to one another as she passed: in her
full skirts flounced to the waist, her dolman of silk velvet, her
feathered bonnet; yes, there she went, Mrs. Dr. Mahony off to learn
to be a postmistress! The half-mile seemed unending; before she
reached her destination her pale cheeks were dyed rose-pink.</p>

<p>In the office she stood, a middle-aged lady (close on
two-and-forty years old) bonnetless and capless, amid a posse of
young clerks: the telegraph operator, the messenger, the indoor
clerk, the postman: to whom she was an object of unending
curiosity. All of whom, too, could do in a twinkling the things
that came so hard to her. And then their manners! They jostled her,
failed to apologise, kept their hats on in her presence, lolled and
lounged, bandied private jokes, laughed and talked openly in
disregard of her, did Mr. Spence quit the office. Her courage might
sometimes have failed her, had it not been that the money side of
the business gave her so little trouble: she learnt in no time how
to issue a money-order, to enter up a savings-book deposit, to
handle postage stamps and registered letters; even to draw up the
financial "statement" that was forwarded daily and monthly to Head
Office. The telegraph it was that baffled her. Oh, this awful morse
code! It was like going to school again to learn one's alphabet.
Her memory was weak and undeveloped: she floundered and was
hopelessly at sea amid the array of dots and dashes that stood for
letters. The little paper handbook containing the code grew as
shabby and dog's-eared as a child's lesson-book. For she carried it
with her everywhere she went, and slept with it under her pillow;
of a night often starting up and striking a match to see if it was
B that had three dots after its dash, or K more than one between
its two. <i>Never</i> would she be able to "take by ear"! How she
marvelled at these young clerks, who could jot down a whole
telegram without so much as a glance at the tape. Whereas she had
painfully to puzzle the message out, letter by letter. And the
"sending" was harder still: with her lips pinched thin, her head
thrown back, her black eyes fixed, in desperate concentration, on
the empty air, laboriously she hammered out dash and dot, dot and
dash.</p>

<p>All this, too, with one anxious ear turned towards home, where
things grew worse instead of better. She had hoped that, once the
physical efforts of the stroke had worn off, and Richard was able
to walk and talk again, his mind, too, would clear. Now, she began
to doubt whether he would ever again be quite himself. Days came
when he sat and brooded from morning till night: sat with his head
on one thin hand, staring before him with eyes so sorrowful that it
hurt you to look at them...though what he was thinking or
remembering, she could never get him to say. At other times he was
unable to be still, or to stay in the same room for a minute on
end; and then it took all her influence and persuasion to keep him
indoors. The children, poor mites, in whose charge she was forced
to leave him while she worked, could do nothing with him, and her
first question of the forlorn little pair who ran to meet her, of
an evening, was invariably: "Where's Papa?" To which more often
than not the answer came: "Gone out. He <i>would</i> go, Mamma...we
couldn't stop him. He went to look for you."</p>

<p>And then it was always: "Run, Cuffy, run quick!...and find
him."</p>

<p>Once Cuffy had said: "Oh, <i>can't</i> Bridget go instead of
me?" but Mamma had looked so funny at him that he'd never done it
again. He went; his hands cold like frogs. For he was so ashamed.
Papa would be standing on the green in front of the blacksmith's,
and the blacksmith had stopped work, and a whole lot of larrikins
were there as well, and they were all listening to Papa...who was
sort of play-acting to himself with his hands...and laughing at him
and making fun. And Papa didn't see them; but <i>he</i> did. And
then he wished Papa was dead, and that he didn't ever need to come
and fetch him again. But he took his hand and said, quite small:
"Papa, come home! Mamma wants you." And then he left off acting
direckly, and was most awfly glad and said: "Where is she? Where
<i>is</i> Mamma?" and came away, holding on to his hand like a
little girl, and nearly running to get there.</p>

<p>That was one thing he hated. The other was, every afternoon
Mamma went out and left him and Luce quite alone...with Papa. (And
you didn't <i>like</i> to be with Papa, since he couldn't speak
right: when you heard him say a spoon and he meant a chair, it made
you feel sick inside, like when you saw a snake.) You were supposed
to practise while Mamma was out, and you did; but your thoughts
went on thinking and thinking; and it was always the same: suppose
she <i>never</i> came back? Luce cried all the time. And then Papa
came and was almost crying, too, and said: "Oh, <i>where</i> is
Mamma? Will she never come home?" and he must go out and look for
her. And it got tea-time, and nearly bedtime, and still she didn't
come; and every time you looked at the clock only five minutes had
gone, and it seemed like an hour. And at last it got so bad you
went and stood down at the gate, or a little way in the road, and
waited for the first bit of her to come round the corner. And then,
oh, how they ran! At least Luce did. He just whistled. For each
time, once he saw Mamma safe again, he didn't seem to care a bit
any more.</p>

<p>The day she told them they'd got to go away and live where there
wasn't any sea, he'd been naughty. He'd cried and stamped and
pushed people when they tried to comfort him. But it wasn't a
<i>real</i> "naught": it was just something inside him and he
couldn't stop it happening. No more springboard, no more lovely
blue water to jump down into, no more hot salty smells. In his
prayers at night, and in secret prayers offered up in corners of
the garden, he begged and prayed God to let them stop there, or at
least to let there be another sea where they were going. But God
just didn't seem to hear.</p>

<p>They weren't to take their toys with them either, their great
big best toys. They had to be sold. Mamma was sorry; but they
simply hadn't got enough money for what it would cost to take the
rocking-horse...or the doll's-house...or Cuffy's big
grocer's-shop...or Luce's huge doll's-p'rambulator. Each of them
would have needed a packing-case to itself.</p>

<p>Both he and Luce prayed about this, kneeling down in the long
thick grass that grew behind the closet, with their eyes tight shut
and their hands put properly together; and he told Luce what to
say. But it was no good. God wasn't there.</p>

<p>Or if He was, He liked Luce best. For by-and-by she was allowed
to take her doll with her, the big, baby one. Mamma said it was
because she could carry it; but he b'lieved it was because Luce had
cried so much. Of course you couldn't carry Dobbin or the shop;
but, my! it <i>did</i> hurt to think of anybody else sitting on the
saddle, or using the scales. He took a pencil and wrote "My horse"
in big letters under Dobbin's stomach, and cut a bunch of hairs out
of his tail for a keepsake. And then, as God still didn't do
anything, he <i>stole</i> something; took away a little bag of
sugar and a tiny wee tin of biscuits out of the shop, and hid them;
and when he told Luce, she did, too, and took a little sofa from
the doll's-house drawing-room. But afterwards a man came with a
pencil and book, and Mamma said he was going to write down the name
of every single thing that was for sale, and then Luce got afraid,
and told, and asked Mamma if she might keep it, and Mamma said no,
it wouldn't be honest; and so she put it back. But he didn't; he
stayed a thief; and said if Luce told on him, he'd put out both her
doll's eyes.</p>

<p>Mamma, she didn't leave things behind...what <i>she</i> wanted.
When Bridget fetched down from the top of the wardrobe those dirty
old cork-boards with butterflies pinned to them&mdash;most of them
had got their wings knocked off them now&mdash;and old glass boxes
with bits of stone in them, and dead flowers, and asked Mamma what
to do with all this rubbish, Mamma said, give them here, and how
she wouldn't part with them not for anything in the world. And he
said, then he didn't see why he couldn't take his horse; and Mamma
was cross, and said little boys didn't know everything, but when he
was as old as she was he'd understand. But he did now: it was
because they were Papa's. And when he said so, she sat back on her
legs and went very red, and looked angry at him, and said: "What in
the name of fortune is all this fuss for about that wretched
animal? You know you hardly ever ride it now! It's too small."</p>

<p>"I don't care...it's mine!"</p>

<p>"Well, I think that's a very selfish way of looking at
it.&mdash;Besides where we're going, if we arrive with big,
expensive toys, people will think we've come there under false
pretences."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then we might be turned out."</p>

<p>Cuffy paled. "Is that because it's going to be a post
office?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And now I hope you'll leave off pestering."</p>

<p>The day the oxshun was, millions of people walked about the
house just as if it was theirs. He and Luce went to Granny's; and
Pauline took them for a bathe and let them stop in till his teeth
trembled. But a few days after they had to get up again in the
middle of the night, and a buggy came to the door and Mamma and
Papa got in, and all their trunks and portmanteaux, and drove to
the pier. A funny little steamer was there to take them to
Melbourne, and it was pitch dark; they had to go on board with a
lantern. And they sat in a teeny-weeny saloon that was the shape of
a heart, with one lamp hanging in the middle; and it was so dark
you could hardly see your faces. And there was nobody else. Luce
went to sleep; and Mamma was sick; but in between, when she felt
better, she tried to pull the rug up round Papa&mdash;it would slip
off...she was always very kind to Papa now. But Papa was angry. He
said: "I don't <i>like</i> this, Mary; it's not what I've been
accustomed to. There's something hole-and-corner about it." And she
patted his hand: "But so nice and private, dear. We've got it all
to ourselves." But Papa went on talking about who he was, and the
kind of ships he'd travelled in, till Mamma told him how cheap it
was, and what a lot of money it was going to save her. And then he
began to cry, and cried and cried&mdash;and the captain (Mamma
said) came in and looked at him&mdash;till he went to sleep. But
<i>he</i> couldn't sleep. He'd always thought, even if they had to
go away, there would be the beautiful steamer to sail on, with a
big deck, and lots of people, and the band playing. Now he knew,
because of Papa they weren't good enough for big steamers any more.
And it seemed just hours he lay and watched the lamp swing, and
listened to Mamma being sick, and the waves making a noise on the
sides; and always more strange men&mdash;sailors and
things&mdash;came in and pretended to be busy. But he believed just
so they could take a good look at Papa, who was asleep now, with
his head hanging down and his mouth wide open, making funny
noises...not like a grown-up gentleman any more.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-3-6" id="ch-3-3-6"></a>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>Their final destination was a place called Gymgurra in the
Western District, some two hundred miles from Melbourne; to be
reached either by a night's sea voyage&mdash;round Cape Otway and
along the wild coast&mdash;or by a combined train and coach
journey. With the ordeal of "taking over charge" before her, Mary
dared not risk the physical upset of a voyage. So at Colac she got
out of the train and into the mail coach, to lumber, the night
through, over the ruts and jolts of bush roads, Lucie a dead weight
on her lap, Cuffy lying heavily up against her.</p>

<p>There were only the three of them; Richard had had to be left
behind. It had torn her heart to part from him, to hand him over to
strangers but not only Bowes-Smith, every one she consulted had
advised against the fatigues of the journey for him in his present
state. So she had yielded&mdash;and not for his sake alone. In the
beginning she would need to give her whole mind to her new work.
Richard would be better looked after where he was. Thanks to
Bowes-Smith, she had managed to get him into a kind of private
hospital, where he would live in comfort under a doctor's eye.</p>

<p>At Toorak, the place was, standing in its own beautiful grounds:
there were shrubberies and summer-houses, a croquet-lawn, a
bowling-green, fruit and flower-gardens; the mere sight of which
had a good effect on Richard. He brightened up, carried himself
more erectly&mdash;even gave himself proprietary airs as they
walked together through the gardens. None the less, when the time
for parting came he wept bitterly, clinging like a child to her
skirts. She had to romance about how soon she was coming back to
fetch him: all the doctor thought it wise for him to be told, in
the meanwhile, was that she was travelling on ahead to set the new
house in order: he surely remembered how he hated the bother and
confusion of moving? And by now he was too deeply sunk in himself
to put awkward questions. Not once, since his attack, had he
troubled his head about ways and means, or where to-morrow's dinner
was to come from. It was pitiable to see; and yet...she couldn't
find it in her heart to grudge him the peace and content this
indifference brought him. The doctors called it euphoria.</p>

<p>The one thing he did ask, again like a timid child, was: "Mary,
it's not that place...that other place, Mary...the one with the
whistle...and the...the...the canal, we're going back to, is
it?"</p>

<p>"No, no, dear, indeed it's not! It's somewhere quite new; where
there'll be all sorts of fresh things for you to see and do. And
till then, Richard, think how comfortable you're going to be here.
Your own room, your own books; and this armchair by the window, so
that you can sit and look out at the flowers, and watch the
croquet, and see all that happens."</p>

<p>But something else still wormed in him. "Who will&mdash;Mary,
will you...will they let me...clean...clean collars, Mary...and
those other things...hankchiefs?"</p>

<p>Here one had a glimpse of the old Richard, with his fastidious
bodily habits. Mary got a frog in her throat over it. But she
answered sturdily enough: "Of course, they will. As many as you
like. And be sure, my darling, if there's anything you don't feel
quite happy about, let me know, and I'll have it put right at
once."</p>

<p>As indeed there should be no difficulty in doing, considering
what she was paying. Though this, again thanks to
Bowes-Smith&mdash;and the fact of Richard being a medical
man&mdash;was only the half of what was charged an ordinary
patient: five guineas a week instead of ten. Even so, it was a
desperately heavy drain. She had put by as much as she dared
towards it &mdash;seventy pounds&mdash;from the sale of the
furniture, so in the meantime he was safe. When this was gone, she
could but hope and pray he would be well enough to come home.</p>

<p>Out of what remained of the auction money, together with
Richard's deposit and her own small savings, she had at once paid
off a quarter's rent on each of the houses. Neither was yet
due...and when Sir Jake heard what she had done, he rather called
her over the coals for so unbusiness-like a proceeding. But he
didn't know&mdash;how could he?&mdash;the load it took from her
mind to know these things settled. With her, in the coach, she
carried three little packets of notes, two of which, screwed up in
old pieces of newspaper and tied securely and privately to her
body, were towards the next quarter again. The third lay in her
sealskin handbag, and was for the expenses of the journey and the
purchasing of a few sticks of furniture. It had been a sad blow to
learn that the salary attached to the Gymgurra post office was only
eighty pounds a year. Eighty pounds! Could she and the children
possibly live on that? And what, when Richard came too? Of course
there was always a chance the house at Shortlands might find a
tenant&mdash;houses were so scarce there&mdash;even though the
summer was by now half over. In which case she would be some pounds
to the good. Jerry, too, in whose hands she had left the affair of
the perished documents, did not despair of retrieving
<i>something</i> from the general ruin. But herself add a single
penny to her income she could not; as a Government servant her
hands were tied.</p>

<p>Over these reckonings the night wore away. (It would be money,
always money now she supposed, to the bitter end.) Still, she did
not fail to send a warm thought back to the dear friends who had
stood by her in her trouble. The Devines had not only housed them
all, but had called in their own medical man to Richard, had helped
her to make arrangements at the hospital, to interview doctor and
matron. Lady Devine, too&mdash;notwithstanding her
corpulence&mdash;had promised to visit Richard weekly and report on
his progress. Old Sir Jake, with her hand in both of his, had gone
as near as he dared towards offering her a substantial loan. Mr.
Henry had driven out to tell her that Mr. Vibert, the Deputy
P.M.G., was in receipt of special instructions with regard to her
case; while the postmaster at the nearest town of any size to
Gymgurra had orders to give her what help she needed. More, said
he, the house at Gymgurra had been enlarged by three rooms. Then
dear old Tilly had travelled down from Ballarat to see her; Jerry
come all the way from Wangaratta. Not to speak of many a kindness
shewn her by less intimate acquaintances.&mdash;And yet, in spite
of this, Mary felt that she was seeing more than one of them for
the last time. Still was she Mrs. Townshend-Mahony, the one-time
member of Melbourne society. From now on, as plain Mrs. Mahony,
postmistress, she would sink below their ken: she read it in their
eyes when she announced what she was going to do; announced it
bluntly, even truculently; for she was determined not to sail under
false colours.</p>

<p>It was the same with her relatives. Lizzie, for instance: Lizzie
who still traded on past glories&mdash;and also, alas! went on
hoarding up poor John's children&mdash;was loud in praise of her
courage and independence. But a blind man could have seen her
relief when she learnt that these virtues were to be practised at a
distance. Jerry, of course, like the sensible fellow he was, ranged
himself on her side&mdash;if he did seem a trifle unsure of
Fanny&mdash;but Zara made no bones of her horrification.</p>

<p>"Have you really thought <i>seriously</i>, Mary, of what you are
about to do? Of the publicity, the notoriety it will entail? For,
no matter what has happened, you are still our poor, dear Richard's
wife. And my one fear is, the odium may redound on him."</p>

<p>"Zara, I've thought till I could think no more. But it's either
this or the workhouse. People who are too good to know me any
longer must please themselves. To tell the truth, I don't very much
care. But as for what I'm doing reflecting on <i>Richard</i>...no,
that's too absurd!"</p>

<p>It wasn't really Richard, it was herself Zara was concerned for;
and in how far having a postmistress for a sister would damage her
prospects. Besides, never again, poor thing, would she be able to
give Richard's name as a reference. Ah, had Zara only been
different! Then the two of them, sisters, and bound by one of
nature's closest ties, might have combined forces; Zara have
managed the house? taught the children, even perhaps have augmented
their slender joint incomes by opening a little school.</p>

<p>Thinking these things Mary found she must have dozed off; for
when, feeling extremely cold, she opened her eyes again, it was
broad daylight. Daylight: and all around her what seemed to her the
flattest, barest, ugliest country she had ever had the misfortune
to see. Not a tree, not a bit of scrub, hardly so much as a bush
broke the monotony of these plains, these immeasurable, grassy
plains: here, flat as pancake, there, rolling a little up and down,
or rising to a few knobbly hillocks, but always bare as a shorn
head&mdash;except for lumps of blackish rock that stuck up through
the soil. You could see for miles on every side, to where the earth
met the sky. Another ugly feature was the extreme darkness of the
soil: the long, straight road they drove was as black as all the
other roads she had known had been white or red. A cloudy sky,
black roads, bare earth: to Mary, lover of towns, of her kind, of
convivial intercourse, the scene struck home as the last word in
loneliness and desolation.</p>

<p>Even the children felt it. "Why are there no trees?" demanded
Cuffy aggressively, the crosspatch he always was after a broken
night. "I don't <i>like</i> it without."</p>

<p>And Lucie's echoing pipe: "Why are there no trees, Mamma?"</p>

<p>And then the place itself.</p>

<p>"Is <i>this</i> it? Is this <i>all?</i>" more resentfully still.
"Then I think it's simply hidjus!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come! Don't judge so hastily."</p>

<p>But her own courage was at zero when, having clambered down from
the coach with legs so stiff that they would hardly carry her, she
stood, a child on either hand, and looked about
her.&mdash;Gymgurra! Two wide, ludicrously wide cross-roads, at the
corners of which clustered three or four shops, a Bank, an hotel,
the post office, the lockup; one and all built of an iron-grey
stone that was almost as dark as the earth itself. There were no
footpaths, no gardens, no trees: indeed, as she soon learnt, in
Gymgurra the saying ran that you must walk three miles to see a
tree; which however was not quite literally true; for, on the
skyline, adjoining a farm, there rose a solitary specimen...a
unicum.</p>

<p>Their new home, the "Post and Telegraph Office," with on its
front the large round clock by which the township told the time,
stood at one of the corners of the cross-roads. Facing it was a
piece of waste ground used for the dumping of rubbish: thousands of
tins lay scattered about, together with old boots, old pots, broken
crockery: its next-door neighbour was the corrugated-iron lock-up.
Until now, it had consisted only of an office and two small
living-rooms. For her benefit a three-roomed weatherboard cottage
had been tacked on behind. This poor little dingy exterior was bad
enough; inside, it was even worse. The former postmaster had been a
bachelor; and before she and the children could live in the rooms
he had left, these would have to be cleaned from top to bottom, and
the walls given a fresh coat of whitewash, to rid them of greasy
smears and finger-marks, of the stains of flies and squashed
spiders. In the wooden portion&mdash;two small bedrooms and a
kitchen&mdash;all the workmen's sawdust and shavings still lay
about. From the back door three crude wooden steps led to a yard
which, except for the water tank, held only rubbish: bottles
galore, whole and broken; old boxes; boots and crockery again;
with, she thought, every kerosene-tin that had been emptied since
the house was first built. Never a spadeful of earth had been
turned.</p>

<p>Thank God, she had not brought Richard with her. The mere sight
of such a place might have done him harm. By the time he came,
poverty-stricken though it was, she would engage to have it looking
very different. And this thought gave her the necessary fillip.
Mastering her dismay, throwing off her discouragement with bonnet
and mantle, she pinned back her skirts and fell to work. With the
help of an old, half-blind woman &mdash;women seemed very scarce
here&mdash;she swept and scrubbed and polished, in an effort to
make the little house clean and sweet; to free it of a dirty man's
traces. Then, perched on top of a step-ladder, with her own hands
she whitewashed walls and ceilings. After this, taking coach to the
neighbouring coast town, she bought the few simple articles of
furniture they needed.&mdash;And, for all her preoccupation over
trying to make one pound go as far as two, she could not help
smiling at Cuffy's dismay as he watched her purchase of a
kitchen-table for use in the dining-room. "But we can't eat our
dinner off <i>that</i>, Mamma!" he nudged her, politely and under
his breath lest the shopman should hear, but with his small face
one wrinkle of perplexity.</p>

<p>And her whispered assurance that a cloth would hide the deal top
didn't help. Cuffy continued sore and ashamed. It wasn't only this
table. There was the dressing-table, too; and the washstand: they
were both <i>really</i> only empty packing-cases, stood on their
sides and covered with pink s'lesha and book-muslin, to look nice.
And for long he lived in dread of some inquisitive person lifting
up cloth or curtain to peep underneath. It would be like seeing
Mamma found out in a story. (If he were there, he would tell that
one of the legs had come off the real things and they were away
being mended. It didn't matter about <i>him</i>. But to think of
Mamma turning cheat gave him a funny stiff ache in his chest.)</p>

<p>He wasn't, he knew, being very good just now; he didn't seem
able to help it. It was so dull here; there was nothing to
do&mdash;not even a piano to play your pieces on. Out of chips and
blocks of woods left by the builders he cut little boats, which he
and Luce sailed in the wash-tubs by the back door...with matches
for masts, and bits of paper for sails. But you couldn't go on
doing that always. And Luce soon got tired, and went to see that
Mamma hadn't run away. You weren't allowed in the office, where
there would have been the machine to look at, and letters in the
pigeon-boxes (had somebody once kept pigeons in them?) and to see
how stamps were sold. And the yard had palings round it so high
that you couldn't see over them, only peep through the cracks. You
weren't supposed to go out in the street. You did. But there wasn't
anything there either. The streets were all just bare.</p>

<p>This was the first time they hadn't had a garden; and fiercely
Cuffy hated the gaunt, untidy yard; the unfinished back to the
house. There hadn't been much at Shortlands either, only pear-trees
and grass; but he liked grass; specially if it nearly covered you
when you sat down in it. At Barambogie there had been flowers, and
the verandah, and lots of paths...and heaps and heaps of trees and
wattle to go out and walk in. He could remember it quite well. And
in a kind of vague way he remembered other things, too. Somewhere
there had been straight black trees like steeples, that swept their
tops about when the wind blew; lawns with water spraying on them;
hairy white strawberries that somebody made you open your mouth to
have popped into. And, vague and faint as these memories were, as
little to be caught and held as old dreams, they had left him a
kind of heritage, in the shape of an insurmountable aversion to the
crude makeshifts and rough slovenliness of colonial life. His
little sister, on the other hand, carried with her, as the sole
legacy of her few years, only a wild fear lest, one sure prop
having given way, the other should now also fail her. Except at her
mother's side, little Lucie knew no rest. She had, as it were,
eternally to stand guard over the parent who was left. And to her
baby mind the one good thing about this poor, ugly place was that
Mamma never went out. Not even to church: a state of things that
threw Cuffy who, ever since he could toddle, had been walked to
church on his mother's hand, into fresh confusion. What would God
think? It wouldn't do for Him not to <i>like</i> Mamma any more,
now she was so poor. And He'd said as plain as plain, Remember the
Sabbath Day to keep it holy. Oh dear! he was only a little boy and
nobody took any notice of him; but what with boxes dressed up as
tables, and a table that pretended to be mahogany, and now none of
them going to church, he felt as if his world was turning upside
down. And that it was one's <i>mamma</i> who did it...who ought to
know better; be perfect, without sin...Mary was unaware of these
vicarious sufferings on her behalf: had neither time nor thought to
spare for a child's imaginary torments. She was never off her
feet&mdash;from seven in the morning till long past midnight. For
when the office closed, she had still the main part of her work to
do: food to prepare for the next day; to wash and iron and sew:
whatever happened, her children must be spotlessly turned out.</p>

<p>Very soon after arriving she had given the relieving officer his
conge. The man's manners were intolerable. It also came to her ears
that he was going about the township saying: "By the Lord Harry,
there's a pair of eyes for you!" Which explained why he and the boy
who was her sole assistant sat stolidly by, not budging to help,
while she answered knocks at the little window: to dole out a
single penny stamp, sell a postcard, repeat till she was tired:
"Nothing to-day," to inquiries for letters. She thought every man
in the place must have come rapping at the wooden shutter...to take
a look at her. Once alone with the lad, however, she had small
difficulty in keeping him in his place. He was a heavy, lumpish
youth; clerk, operator, telegraph messenger rolled in one. The
trouble was, he was so often absent. For though no letters were
carried out, yet, had a telegram to be delivered, what with the
long distances to be covered on foot and the lad's incurable
propensity for gossip, she would find herself deserted for hours at
a time on the run between "key" and window, getting her "statement"
made up at any odd moment. Luckily enough, the money side of the
business continued to come easy to her. Figures seemed just to fall
into line and to add up of themselves.</p>

<p>Had there been the day's work only to contend with, she would
not have complained. It was the nights that wore her down. The
nights were cruel. On every one of them without exception, between
half-past one and a quarter to two, there came a knocking like
thunder at the front door. This was the coach arriving with the
night mail: she had to open up the office, drag a heavy mail-bag
in, haul another out. Not until this was over could there be any
question of sleep for her.</p>

<p>Almost at once it became a nervous obsession (she who had had
such small patience with Richard's night fancies!) that, did she
even doze off, she might fail to hear the knocking&mdash;calculated
though this was to wake the dead!&mdash;fail in her duty, lose her
post, bring them all to ruin. Hence she made a point of sitting up
till she could sit no longer, then of lying down fully dressed,
watching the shadows thrown by the candle on walls and ceiling,
listening to the children's steady breathing, the wind that soughed
round the corners of the house.</p>

<p>Then when the coach had rumbled off, the sound of wheels and
hoofs died away, and she might have slept, she could not. The
effort of rising, of pulling the bags about and exchanging words
with the driver, had too effectually roused her. Also, the glimpse
caught through the open door of the black darkness and loneliness
without alarmed her each time afresh. For the country was anything
but safe. The notorious Kellys had recently been at work in the
district, and not so very far from Gymgurra either; the township
still rang with tales of their exploits. And after the Bank, the
post office was the likeliest place to be stuck up, if not
<i>the</i> likeliest; for the Bank Manager had a strong-room, and
no doubt a revolver, too...besides being a man. While she was only
a defenceless woman, with no companions but two small children. If
the bushrangers should appear one night, and order her to "bail up"
while they rifled the office, she would be utterly at their
mercy.</p>

<p>The result of letting her mind dwell on such things was that she
grew steadily more awake; and till dawn would lie listening to
every sound. Never did the cheering fall of a human foot pass the
house. Unlit, unpatrolled, the township slept the sleep of the
dead. Only the dingoes snarled and howled; at first a long way off,
and then, more shrilly, near at hand. Or the old volcano that stood
in its lake some three miles away&mdash;it was said to be extinct,
but really one didn't know&mdash;would suddenly give vent to loud,
unearthly rumblings; which sometimes became so violent that the
jugs on the washstand danced and rattled. And then the children,
who had learned to sleep through the bustle of the coach, would
wake up, too, and be frightened; and she would have to light the
candle again and talk to them, and give them drinks, and re-arrange
their pillows.</p>

<p>"It's all right, chicks. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Mamma's here."</p>

<p>This satisfied them: Mamma was there, hence all was well...as
though she were a kind of demigod, who controlled even the
eruptions of volcanoes! With Lucie cuddled tight in her arms, all
the fragrance of the child's warm body mounting to her, she lay and
thought of her children with a pity that left mere love far behind.
They trusted her so blindly; and she, what could she do for them?
Except for this imagined security, she had nothing to give. And,
should anything happen to her, while they were still too young to
fend for themselves&mdash;no! that simply did not bear thinking of.
She had seen too much of the fates of motherless children in this
country. Bandied from one home to another, tossed from pillar to
post...like so much unclaimed baggage. Rather than know hers
exposed to such a destiny...yes, there came moments when she could
understand and condone the madness of the mother who, about to be
torn away, refused to leave her little ones behind. For, to these
small creatures, bone of her bone and flesh of her flesh, links
bound Mary that must, she felt, outlast life itself. Through them
and her love for them, she caught her one real glimpse of
immortality.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-3-7" id="ch-3-3-7"></a>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>But these were night thoughts. By day, when the children were
their very human selves&mdash;high-spirited, quarrelsome, up to
endless mischief &mdash;the question of Richard and Richard's
welfare again took first place in her mind.</p>

<p>The improvement she had so hoped for him, in his pleasant,
care&mdash;free surroundings, did not come to pass. She saw this,
not so much from what the doctors wrote&mdash;they were painfully
guarded&mdash;as from his own letters to her. Week by week these
grew more incoherent; not words only, whole sentences were now
being left out. They were written, too, in a large, unformed,
childish hand, which bore no likeness to his fine, small writing;
were smudged, and ill-spelt. She felt them as shameful, and
directly she had deciphered them hid them away: no eye but hers
should see to what depths he had sunk.</p>

<p>And the doctors kept up their non-committal attitude to the end:
the end, that was, of the three months for which she had their fees
laid by. Then, they were forced to come out of their shell; and, to
her letter saying that she could no longer afford to leave her
husband in their charge and asking for a frank opinion on his case,
they wrote her what she had feared and foreseen: there was no hope
of recovery for Richard. His mental deterioration, since coming
under their notice, had been marked; signs of arterial degeneration
were now to be observed as well. Did she seriously contemplate
removing him, they could only advise his further restraint in one
of the public institutions. They trusted, however, that she would
reconsider her decision to remove him. On all points it would be to
the patient's advantage.</p>

<p>In her distress, Mary crushed the letter to a ball in her hand.
To re-read it, she had to stroke and smooth it flat again. For the
step they were urging upon her meant the end of everything: meant
certification; an asylum for the insane. (The children's father a
certified lunatic!) Yet, just because of the children...This was an
objection the doctors had raised, in telling her that Richard might
last for years&mdash;in his present state&mdash;when she first
proposed keeping him with her. They would be doubly against it now.
And for days she went irresolute, torn between pity for Richard and
fear for her children. In the end it was once more Bowes-Smith who
got the better of her. He pointed out how little, for all her
devotion, she could do to ameliorate her husband's lot, compared
with the skilled nursing he would receive from properly trained
attendants. Besides, Richard was, assured her, by now too far gone
in inattention, really to miss her or to need her. There seemed
nothing for it but gratefully to accept his offer, himself to take
the affair in hand. Thanks to his influence, Richard had a chance
of being lodged in one of the separate cottages at the asylum,
apart from the crowd: he would be under a special warder, have a
bedroom more or less to himself. And so, with a heavy heart Mary
gave her consent; the various legal and medical formalities were
set in motion; and, soon after, the news came that the change had
been made and Richard installed in his new quarters. His books and
clothing were being returned to her. (Prisoners&mdash;no, she meant
patients&mdash;were not allowed any superfluous belongings. Nor,
bitter thought! need she now rack her brains where the new suit was
to come from, for which his late nurse had pressed, because of his
growing habit of spilling his food. From now on, he would wear the
garb of his kind.) But after this she heard no more: with the
shutting of the gates behind him silence fell&mdash;a horrible,
deathlike silence. Never again did one of his pitiful little
letters reach her; and the authorities blankly ignored her requests
for information. Finally, in response to a more vigorous demand
than usual, she received a printed form stating that reports were
issued quarterly, and hers would reach her in due course. Grimly
she set her teeth and waited; meanwhile laying shilling to shilling
for the journey to Melbourne which she could see lay before
her.&mdash;But, when the time came, she had to part with a little
brooch to which she had clung, because it had been one of Richard's
first gifts to her after marriage. Mr. Rucker, the clergyman,
bought it of her for his wife.</p>

<p>Her story was, of course, common property in Gymgurra by now;
and it was just an example of people's kindness, when the very next
day Mrs. Rucker brought the brooch back and, with her own hands,
pinned it on again, saying things that made it impossible to take
offence. Yes, Mary never ceased to marvel at the way in which
friends sprang up round her in her need, and put themselves out to
help her. These Ruckers, for instance&mdash;they had no family of
their own&mdash;were constantly taking the children off her hands.
Hence, when the week's leave of absence for which she had applied
was granted, she could part from Cuffy and Lucie with an easy
mind.</p>

<p>And one cold spring night towards two o'clock, she put on her
warmest travelling clothes and climbed into the coach for Colac.
She had bespoken a seat...and a good job, too! For an election had
taken place in the district, and the coach was crammed with men,
some coming from the polling, others on their way to a cattle
market. She sat, the night through, jammed in among them, her arms
pinned to her sides, half suffocated with smoke, and deafened by
their talk. Not till daybreak was she joined by one of her own sex.
Then, on stopping at a wayside public-house, they found a thinly
clad, elderly woman waiting for the coach, a little bundle in her
hand. But there was not room for a mouse in among them, let alone
an old woman: one rude voice after another bawled the information.
At which the poor thing began to cry, and so heartbrokenly that
Mary was touched. Elbowing her way to the window, she leaned out
and questioned the woman. At what she heard, and at the continued
crude joking of her fellow-travellers, she lost her temper, and
rounding on them cried: "Do you mean to say there isn't one of you
who's man enough to give up his seat?" And as, though the laughter
ceased, none offered, she said hotly: "Very well then, if you
won't, I will! I'm on my way, too, to see a sick person, but I'll
take my chance of getting a lift later in the day.&mdash;I'm glad
I'm not a man...that's all!"</p>

<p>"Now then, missis, keep your hair on." And a lanky young fellow,
with hands like ploughshares and a face confusion-red at his own
good deed, gawkily detached himself and stepped out. "Here y'are,
ma, in you get! I'll toddle along on Shanks' p's."</p>

<p>The two women made the rest of the journey in company, Mary even
treading underfoot the prejudice of a lifetime and going
second-class in the train. (There was no Richard now, to cast up
his eyes in horror.) The poor soul at her side told a sad story:
one's own troubles shrank as one heard it. She was bound for the
Melbourne Hospital, where her son, her only child, lay dying: he
had got "the water" on his chest, and the doctors had telegraphed
she must come at once if she wanted to see him alive. Her husband
had been killed at tree-felling only a few months back; and, her
son gone, she would be alone in the world. Mary, feeling rich in
comparison, shared with her her travelling-rug, her packet of
sandwiches, her bottle of cold tea; and at Spencer Street station,
having saved considerably on her fare, was able to put the poor
mother in a wagonette and pay for her to be driven straight to the
hospital. For she could see the bush-dweller's alarm at the noise
and bustle of the city.</p>

<p>On parting, the woman kissed her hand. "God bless you,
ma'am...God bless and keep you, the kindest lady ever I
met!&mdash;and may He restore your poor gentleman to his right
mind! I shan't never forget what you've done for me this day. And
if ever there come a time when I c'ld do su'thing for you...but
there! not likely&mdash;only Bowman's my name &mdash;Mrs. Bowman,
at Sayer's Thack, near Mortlake."</p>

<p>For Mary the Devines' carriage and pair was in waiting. The old
coachman smiled and touched his hat and said: "Very glad to see you
again, ma'am!" tucked the black opossum-rug round her, and off they
rolled, she lying back on the springy cushions. And all the time
she was in Melbourne this conveyance stood freely at her disposal,
Lady Devine being by now grown too comfortable even for "carriage
exercise." "By the time I've buttoned me boots, dearie, and put on
me plumes, I'm dead beat. An' there are the 'orses eatin' their
'eads off in the stable. You can't do Jake and me a greater
kindness 'n to use 'em."</p>

<p>Without this mechanical aid: to expedite her hither and thither,
to wait for her while she kept appointments, to carry her on anew,
Mary could impossibly have got through what she did in the days
that followed: looked back on, they resembled the whirligig horrors
of a nightmare. She had come to Melbourne tired, sad, and anxious
enough, in all conscience. But in the hard-faced, unscrupulous
woman with which, at the end of the time, her glass presented her,
she hardly recognised herself. Never in her life had she fought for
anything as now for Richard's freedom.</p>

<p>The morning after her arrival, she drove out to the asylum. The
way led through lovely Toorak, with its green lawns and white
houses, up Richmond Hill, and down into the unattractive purlieus
of Collingwood. The carriage came to a standstill on a stretch of
waste land, a kind of vast, unfenced paddock, where hobbled horses
grazed. It could go no farther, for, between them and the complex
of houses, cottages, huts which formed the asylum, flowed the
unbridged river. Rain had fallen during the night, and the reddish,
muddy stream, which here turned and twisted like a serpent, ran so
high that the weeping willows (Richard's favourite <i>salix
babylonica</i>) which lined the bank, dragged their branches deep
in the flood. The houses, overhung by the ragged, melancholy gums,
looked shabby and neglected; one and all in need of a coat of
paint. Mary's heart fell.</p>

<p>Seating herself in the ferry, she was conveyed across the
water.</p>

<p>She had not announced her visit. Her intention was to see for
herself how Richard was lodged and cared for, at those times when
the place was closed to the public. Had the authorities known
beforehand that she was coming, they might have dressed and dolled
him up for her. (Yes! she was fast turning into a thoroughly
suspicious and distrustful woman.) For passport, she had armed
herself with a letter to the head doctor from Sir Jake Devine.</p>

<p>And well that she had. Great its virtue was not, but, without
it, she would hardly have got over the threshold. And once inside
the front door she had to fight her way forward, step by step: it
needed all her native obstinacy, her newly acquired aggressiveness,
not to allow herself to be bowed out by the several assistants and
attendants who blocked her path. But having vowed to herself that
she would see some one in authority, see him she did; though in the
end they fobbed her off with a youngish fellow, to whom&mdash;he
had cod's eyes and a domineering manner&mdash;she took an instant
and violent dislike.</p>

<p>By this time, too, her blood was up; and the incivility of her
reception seemed the last straw. A good log-fire burnt in the
fireplace &mdash;the rest of the building struck her as very damp
and chill&mdash;a comfortable armchair was suitably placed, but he
did not invite her to approach the fire or to take a seat. He stood
while he spoke...and kept her standing. She had, he presumed,
already been informed that this was not a visiting-day&mdash;and
certainly not an hour for visitors. But as he understood that she
had made a special journey from up-country, they had stretched a
point. What did she want?</p>

<p>"To know how my husband is."</p>

<p>His fish eyes bulged still more. Was that all? When the report
would have been so shortly in her hands?</p>

<p>"I preferred to come myself. I wish to speak to my husband."</p>

<p>"For that, ma'am, you will need to present yourself at the
proper time." (Then it was as she thought. They were <i>not</i>
going to let her see Richard unprepared.)</p>

<p>As, however, she made no movement to withdraw, but stood her
ground with, for all her shabby dress and black gloves showing
white at the finger-tips, the air of a duchess, and an answer for
everything (danged if he knew how to treat such a bold, bouncing
woman!), he crossed the room, took a ledger from a rack, and asked
in tones of exasperation: "Well, what in thunder is it then?...your
husband's name?"</p>

<p>"Quite so...exactly!" he cut her reply short. "If you think,
madam, with the dozens of patients we have on our hands...it is
possible to remember...the details and antecedents of each
individual case..." As he spoke he was running a fat finger down
column after column. "Ha! here we have it." Transporting the book
to the central table, he laid it flat and faced her over it. "Here
it is; and I regret to inform you that the report we should
presently have sent you would have been of a highly unsatisfactory
nature."</p>

<p>"Why? Is he so much worse?" With difficulty her dry lips framed
the words.</p>

<p>"I refer not to his state of health&mdash;the disease is running
a normal course&mdash;but to his conduct. Ever since being admitted
to the asylum, your husband has proved to the last degree
obstreperous and unruly."</p>

<p>"Well, that I cannot understand!" gave back Mary hotly. "Where
he was&mdash;before he came here&mdash;they had only good to say of
him."</p>

<p>"No doubt, no doubt! A patient worth his eight or ten guineas a
week&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Five</i>, if you please! He received special terms...as a
medical man."</p>

<p>"All of which is beside the point. The fact remains that, to us,
he is a constant source of trouble. We have been obliged more than
once to place him in solitary confinement. His behaviour is such as
to corrupt the other patients."</p>

<p>"<i>Corrupt?</i>"</p>

<p>"Corrupt."</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is...there must be something very wrong in
the way he's treated. He would never willingly give trouble. By
nature he's one of the gentlest and politest of men."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to hear his warder on the subject?" And
going to the fireplace the young man rang a bell and instructed a
servant: "Send 97B's keeper here to me."</p>

<p>(97B?...why B?...why not A? Mary's mind seized on the trivial
detail and held fast to it, so as not to have to face the...the
degradation the numbering implied.)</p>

<p>The warder entered touching his forelock: a coarse, strongly
built fellow, with a low forehead and the underjaw of a
prize-fighter. Her heart seemed to shrivel at thought of
Richard...Richard!...in the power of such a man.</p>

<p>She hung her head, holding tight as if for support to the clasp
of her sealskin bag, while the warder told the tale of Richard's
misdeeds. 97B was, he declared, not only disobedient and
disorderly; he was extremely abusive, dirty in his habits (here the
catch of the handbag snapped and broke), would neither sleep
himself at night nor let other people sleep; also he refused to
wash himself, or to eat his food. "It's always the same ol' story.
No sooner I bring him his grub than he up and pitches the dishes at
me head."</p>

<p>She thought she had the fellow there. "Do you mean to tell me
he...that you give him fresh crockery to break every day?"</p>

<p>"Crockery? Ho, no fear! The plates and cups is all of tin."</p>

<p>At this Mary laughed, but very bitterly. "Ah! now I see. That
explains it. For I know my husband. Never would you get
him...nothing would induce him...to eat off tin."</p>

<p>"Needs Sevres no doubt!"</p>

<p>"No! All he needs is to be treated like a gentleman...by
gentlemen."</p>

<p>But she had to keep a grip on her mind to hinder it from
following the picture up: Richard, forced by this burly brute to
grope on the floor for his spilt food, to scrape it together, and
either eat it or have it thrust down his throat. So she shut her
ears, made herself deaf to their further talk, stood as it were
looking through the speakers and out beyond&mdash;at her ripening
purpose.</p>

<p>But when at the end of the interview she made a last, passionate
appeal to be allowed to see her husband, she was not too absorbed
to catch the glance, alive with significance, that passed between
the men. Sorry, said the keeper, but the patient was in bed resting
after a very bad night: he couldn't on any account have him woke up
again. At which excuse, things (old things), that she had heard
from Richard about the means used to quell and break the spirits of
refractory lunatics, jumped into her mind. There was not only
feeding by force, the straitjacket, the padded cell. There were
drugs and injections, given to keep a patient quiet and ensure his
warders their freedom: doses of castor oil so powerful that the
unhappy wretch into whom they were poured was rendered bedridden,
griped, thoroughly ill.</p>

<p>But she saw plainly, here was nothing to be done. Her fight to
get him back would have to be carried on outside the walls of the
asylum. Buttoning her gloves with shaky, fumbling fingers, she
confronted her opponents in a last bout of defiance. "I find it
hard to believe a word of what you've said. But I know this: my
husband shall not stay here. I'll take him home and look after him
myself. He shall never leave my side again."</p>

<p>They all but laughed in her face. The idea was a very woman's!
No alienist would ever be got to revoke this particular patient's
certificate...or advise his release. In his fits of mania 97B was
dangerous, and not merely to those about him; he needed protection
against himself, which could only be given him by men trained to
the job. Impossible!...utterly impossible.</p>

<p>She left them at it, turned her back and marched out of the room
and down the corridor, through innumerable doors, not one of which
she could afterwards remember having opened or shut (they were as
insubstantial as the people she met on her passage), made her way
to the ferry and up the other side, where she was helped into the
carriage. And even while she bowled forward again, she continued to
sit rigid and insensible, her sole movement being to pull off her
gloves they incommoded her&mdash;that she might lock her
fingers...in an iron grip. The skin of her face felt stretched:
like a mask that was too tight for it. But she shed not a tear,
either here or when, having reached home, she paced the floor of
the room and told her story. Something stronger than herself had
control of her: she was all one purpose, one flame. Her old friend
it was who wept. "Oh, just to <i>think</i> of 'im being come to
this!...'im, the 'andsomest man I ever saw, and the best as
well."</p>

<p>But she, too, said: "Impossible! Oh no, my dear, it
<i>couldn't</i> be done," when she heard of Mary's determination.
"Your children&mdash;you 'ave your children to consider."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can take care of them. But should I ever again know a
moment's peace, if I left him in that awful place? Richard?...my
poor old husband? As it is he'll believe I've deserted
him...forgotten him...left off caring. No: I mean to get him out,
or die in the attempt."</p>

<p>And when the old lady saw the blazing eyes, the dilated
nostrils, the set jaw with which this was said, she bowed before
the iron will made manifest, and went over heart and soul to Mary's
side. "Well, then, my love and my dearie, if nothing else will
do&mdash;and, oh my dear, I feel in the bottom of my 'eart you're
right&mdash;then what I say is, we&mdash;Jake and me 'ull do
everything that lies in our power to 'elp you. <i>I'll</i> manage
Jake; you go on to the rest. Get 'old of 'em somehow, and give 'em
no quarter...and though they talk till all's blue about their laws
and certificates. What's laws for, I'd like to know, if not to be
got round?"</p>

<p>But this was the sole word of encouragement Mary heard. The rest
of the world combined to iterate and reiterate the doctor's verdict
of impossible, utterly impossible.</p>

<p>She battered at every likely door. All sense of pride having
left her, any influential or well-known person who in former years
had broken bread at her table, or whom she had casually met at
another's, she now waylaid or ran to earth. For along with her
pride went also the retiring modesty, the shrinking from
prominence, that had hall-marked her years of wifehood. She was no
longer the "lady," watchful of her steps. She was a tiger fighting
for her young&mdash;did not Richard, in his present state, stand
for the youngest and most helpless of her children?&mdash;and she
now found to her astonishment that she was quite capable of
standing up to men, of arguing with them, of talking them down,
and, if necessary, of telling them what she thought of them.</p>

<p>The medical profession, of course, furnished her with her most
implacable opponents. The doctors to whom she turned acted as if
<i>she</i> were the crazed one; or else they smiled good-humouredly
at her, as at a child...or a woman. But if she stood firm, refusing
to be browbeaten or cajoled, they gave her short shrift. To remove
an insane person with notedly violent periods&mdash;a perfectly
proper subject for detention&mdash;from medical safekeeping, in
order to place him in inexperienced lay-hands: such an act would be
a criminal proceeding on the part of any medical man found to
sanction it. Her ignorance of matters medical alone acquitted her.
Nor could she get them to credit the ill-treatment to which Richard
was being subjected. Again it was sheer ignorance on her part that
made her take this view. The asylum authorities were doubtless
fully justified in what they did: you could not <i>reason</i> with
the deranged. And so on...and on. How she came to hate and dread
the words Certification, Lunacy Laws, Lunacy Authorities! Their
very sound seemed to shut away for ever, from the rest of humanity,
from every human feeling, those unfortunates who had fallen beneath
the ban.</p>

<p>Giving the doctors up as a bad job, she turned her attention to
other influential people she had known: members of parliament,
bankers, the clergy. And here she was received with the utmost
consideration, no one of these old friends and acquaintances
reminding her, by so much as a look, that she was now but a poor
up-country postmistress. All alike deplored Richard's fate, and
offered her their heartfelt sympathy; but from none of them could
she wring a promise of help or interference. Their concern was
entirely for her, her personal safety, and that of her children.
While the Bishop and his brethren spoke in muted voices of God's
Will, this mysterious Will to which it was one's duty to
submit&mdash;till she could have flung her bag at their heads. A
stone for bread, indeed, when her only cry was: "Give me back my
husband!"</p>

<p>Sir Jake, who had been won over&mdash;though rather
half-heartedly, and solely as a result of endless, nagging
curtain-lectures&mdash;did what he could; but he no longer held
office and his influence was slight. And the person on whom Mary
had built most, the one member of the present ministry she knew
intimately, Henry Ocock, was not to be got at. Though she called
every day, and sometimes twice a day, at his chambers, it was
always to learn that business still detained him in Ballarat.</p>

<p>She applied for a second week's leave of absence&mdash;and got
it. And when but forty-eight hours of this remained and she had
still achieved as good as nothing, she sent Mr. Henry a page-long
telegram, imploring him, in the name of their old friendship, to
grant her an interview.</p>

<p>He travelled to Melbourne by the next train. She met him one
cold, dusty autumn afternoon, in a private sitting-room at Scott's
Hotel.</p>

<p>He came towards her with outstretched hands, but was so shocked
at her appearance that he would not let her say a word before she
was thoroughly rested and refreshed. Then, the waiter having
withdrawn, he drew up his chair and begged her to tell him what he
could do for her.</p>

<p>To this old friend, whose mottled hair she had known when it was
sleekest, jettiest raven, she now opened her heart; beginning from
the time when, almost against her will and certainly against her
better judgment, she had yielded to the specious assurances of
Bowes-Smith and his kind, and had consented to Richard becoming the
inmate of a public lunatic asylum.&mdash;"Never should I have let
him get into their clutches!"&mdash;But so much had been made of
the treatment, the individual nursing he would receive there, and
the beneficial effect this would have on him, that she had sunk her
scruples. Afterwards had come the stoppage of his letters, the dead
silence of his imprisonment, and her growing doubts; followed by
her journey to town, her tragic discovery of his true state, the
insolence she had had to put up with from the young
assistant&mdash;"Hardly more than a medical student!"&mdash;the
beggar's calvary she had since been through. Not a living soul, it
seemed, was willing to break a lance for Richard: once certified, a
man might just as well be under the soil. On all sides she had been
bidden to go home and live in peace. Knowing what she knew? Would
other women have done it? If so, they were made of different stuff
from her. She would think herself a traitor, if she did not fight
for Richard's release as long as she had a breath left in her
body.</p>

<p>Ocock let her talk: heard her out in a lawyer's cogitative
silence, the while thoughtfully pulling at and stroking his chin.
Even after she had ceased speaking he sat meditative&mdash;and so
used was Mary, by now, to being instantly downed and dismissed,
that this very silence fed her hopes. Hence when at last he broke
it, his words had the force of a blow. For all he did was to bring
to her notice a point which he very much feared she had overlooked.
And this was that she was no longer a private individual, but a
public servant in Government employ. Difficulties would certainly
be raised from this side, too, did she apply&mdash;as she was bound
to do&mdash;for permission to receive a certified lunatic in her
home. The Department would hold that the efficient discharge of her
duties and the care, at the same time, of a sick man, would be
irreconcilable...impossible.</p>

<p>At this repetition of the word that had dogged her every step,
something tipped over in Mary. Passionately flinging up her head,
she looked full and squarely at Ocock: pinned with her own what
Richard had been used to call "those shifty little black
boot-buttons of eyes!" And then, almost before she knew it, words
began to pour from her lips, things she could not have believed
herself capable of saying&mdash;to any one, let alone Henry Ocock,
now so far above her. (In after years of a sleepless night she
would suddenly feel her face begin to burn in the darkness, at the
mere remembrance of them. Spiritual blackmail would have been
Richard's name for it.)</p>

<p>It was of herself and Richard that she had meant to speak; of
the tie between them which no living creature had the right to
break. But Ocock's presence seemed to bring the whole past alive
before her, and the past brought Agnes, and memories of
Agnes&mdash;"The dearest, truest little soul that ever
lived!"&mdash;and of the murk and misery in which the poor thing's
days had ended. And under the influence of this emotion everything
came out. Not only, lost to shame, did she throw in her listener's
teeth all she had done for Agnes: the expense she had been put to
when she could ill afford it; the pains she had been at to save
Agnes from herself: she also stripped the veneer off his own
conduct, laying bare his heartlessness, his egoism, his cruelty,
yes, even brutality: how, in order to keep up his dignity, save his
own face, he had wantonly sacrificed his wife, abandoning her when
she most needed love, pity, companionship; shutting her up to drink
herself to death&mdash;even barbarously shipping her off to die
alone, among strangers, in a strange land. Not a shred of
self-respect did she leave on him: he should see himself for once
as others saw him: and she went on, pouring out scorn on his
hypocrisy and pretence, till she had him standing there as morally
naked as he had come physically naked into the world, and would one
day go out of it. Before she finished the tears were streaming down
her cheeks...for Agnes; her own troubles completely forgotten for
the moment, over the other's tragedy.</p>

<p>Her voice failing her, she came to a stop: just sat and stared
before her, feeling, now the fit was over, cold and queer and
shaky. But nothing would have made her take back a word of what she
had said; not even though&mdash;as was only too likely&mdash;she
had ruined her chances for good and all.</p>

<p>As, however, the silence that followed seemed to be going to
last for ever, she plucked up courage to glance at Mr. Henry. And
she had the surprise of her life. For he was sitting gazing at her
with a look such as she had never seen on his face; a kindly,
indulgent, almost <i>fond</i> look; and&mdash;oh, was it
possible?&mdash;with his eyes full of tears. More, those eyes were
now as steady as her own: had quite ceased furtively to dart and
run. And the crowning touch was put to this strange reception of
her tirade, by his nodding head, slowly, several times in
succession, and saying: "A staunch and loyal advocate indeed! My
friend, a great fighter has been lost in you."</p>

<p>Then he got up and went to the window, where he stood looking
down into the street. Mary sat motionless, but odd thoughts and
scraps of thoughts were whizzing round her brain. This then was
how...stand up to him, <i>bully</i> him...if Agnes had only...but
would never have had the spirit. And then his eyes...the shiftiness
more than half fear...fear of discovery...and, once found
out&mdash;But, oh! not praise for her eloquence. If she hadn't
touched him...or had touched him solely in this way...Coming back
to her he took her hands. "What you are asking of me, Mrs. Mahony,
means difficulties of which you, as a woman, do not realise the
quarter...the half. I will make you no fixed promises; which I
might be unable to keep. All I will say is, that for your
sake&mdash;your sake alone!&mdash;I will see what can be done."</p>

<p>And with this single, straw to cling to, Mary travelled
home.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-3-8" id="ch-3-3-8"></a>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>He had enjoined her to patience and patient she was&mdash;though
week ran into week and month to month, in all of which time she
knew nothing of what was happening behind the scenes, or what
strings Ocock was pulling to upset the cumbrous machinery of
medical law. She just dragged on from day to day, in ignorance and
suspense. But her nerves often got the better of her, and then the
children felt her heavy, hasty hand. While, in her official
capacity, so set did she become on her "rights," so unblushing in
making her voice heard, that her name grew to be a by-word in the
service. "That tartar at G.G.?" (which was the morse call for
Gymgurra) was how she was familiarly spoken of.</p>

<p>In this dreary time, when her narrow walls oppressed her to
breathlessness, but from which there was no possible escape for
her, one piece of good fortune came her way. The house at
Shortlands found a tenant; and so the money which she had
laboriously scraped together for the following quarter's rent would
not be needed. Hence when at last the tide began to turn, with the
substitution of "highly dangerous," and "a most risky experiment,"
for the maddening "impossible," she actually had a small sum in
hand with which to make her preparations. And she set about these
forthwith; building on her recently acquired knowledge of men and
their ways. She could look for no complete <i>volte face</i> on
their part. Only in this grudging, half-hearted fashion would their
consent be given.</p>

<p>Help in the house she must have, was she to be free to devote
what time she could spare from her office-work to Richard. Her
first thought was naturally of her poor old ageing sister, and she
wrote to Zara, offering her house-room in exchange for her
services. But though in her last situation little more than a
nursemaid, Zara declined the proposal as stiffly and
uncompromisingly as if she were rolling in money: dubbing Mary mad
as a March hare to think of removing "our poor dear Richard" from
safe control; madder still to imagine that she, Zara, with her
delicate nerves, would be able to live for a single day under the
same roof as a lunatic. Emmy, unasked, wrote begging to be allowed
to help care for "poor darling Uncle." But quite apart from the
mixed motives that underlay the offer, this was out of the
question. You could not so take the bloom off a young girl's life.
There would be things to do for Richard&mdash;unfit things...And it
was here that Mary bethought herself of the woman she had
befriended on her journey to town, whose son had died soon after.
So, in the same terms as to Zara, she wrote to "Mrs. Bowman at
Sayer's Thack"&mdash;though it did seem rather like posting a
letter into the void. Almost by return, however, came an ill-spelt
scrawl, joyfully accepting the job; and a little later Mrs. Bowman
herself got out of the coach, with all her worldly goods tied up in
one small cardboard-box, but carrying with her, as a gift, a
stringy old hen (fit only for the soup-pot) and half a pound of
dairy butter. And in this poor, lone soul, Mary found yet another
of those devoted, leech-like friends, who had starred her path
through life.</p>

<p>The final surrender came in the form of a lengthy screed from
Mr. Henry, in which he informed her that, after surmounting
difficulties and obstacles greater even than he had anticipated, he
had at last succeeded in bringing the various authorities
involved&mdash;medical, legal, postal&mdash;to agree to the plan of
Dr. Mahony's removal from control being given a provisional trial.
That was to say, the patient would be accompanied to Gymgurra by
two warders, who would remain while the experiment was made. In the
event of it failing, they would immediately escort the patient back
to the asylum. Followed, this, by four pages in which Mr. Henry
begged her once more seriously to consider what she was doing. It
was still not too late to draw back. Should she, however, decide to
go forward, he trusted she would further show her friendship for
him by regarding him as her banker, if the expenses of the
undertaking proved too heavy for her purse. He would be only too
happy to assist her.&mdash;Well, thank goodness, owing to her
little windfall, she need be beholden to nobody; although, at this
pass, she would not have hesitated to borrow freely. But, Bowey's
expenses settled, she had still enough in hand to cover the three
fares up from town, and those of the warders back; as well as their
board and lodging while in Gymgurra.</p>

<p>Only the day of arrival now remained to be fixed. But now, too,
in the small hours when she lay waiting for the night mail, Mary
was assailed by her first fears and apprehensions. It was not her
ability to cope with, and control, and nurse Richard that she
doubted. No, her fears concerned herself. Her own strength was
already sorely taxed, she on the brink of those years when a woman
most needed rest and care and a quiet life. Suppose <i>she</i>
should fall ill?...need nursing herself? Or that she should die
before him...be forced to leave him?...him and the children. This
was the thought that haunted her nights; and though she drove it
from her, fought it valiantly, it was often not to be got under
till she had risen and paced the house.</p>

<p>When Cuffy heard that Papa was coming home, his black eyes
opened till they seemed to fill his face.</p>

<p>"Do you mean he...he's coming back here? <i>Now?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes. And you chicks must try your best to help me. I shall have
more than ever to do."</p>

<p>"But is he...isn't he still..." It was no use; his mouth was
full of tongue; the "mad" simply wouldn't come out. To which
half-asked question Mamma said firmly: "Run away and play."</p>

<p>But they were moving his bed, and he saw them: saw, too, a new
bed being carried into Mamma's room. "What's that for? And where's
my bed going?" And at the news that from now on he was to sleep in
Bowey's room, the dismay he had so far bitten back broke through.
"Oh no, I <i>can't</i>, Mamma! I won't!...sleep in the same room as
her."</p>

<p>"And why not, indeed?"</p>

<p>"She's...she's a <i>lady</i>."</p>

<p>"Really, Cuffy! I do wonder where you get your ideas from. Pray,
haven't you been sleeping all this time with Lucie and me? Are we
not ladies, too?"</p>

<p>No, of course not&mdash;they were only just their two selves.
But as usual he didn't try to explain. It was never a bit of
good.</p>

<p>With Lucie, whose chubby face wore a harassed look, beside him,
he sat on the back steps with his elbows on his knees, his chin
hunched in his hands. The yard was mostly potatoes now&mdash;the
floury sort that were so good to have for dinner, but left hardly
any room to play. For you hadn't got to tread on them.&mdash;Oh,
<i>why</i> did Papa need to come back? They had been so happy
without him...even though they had to keep a post office, and
weren't <i>real</i> ladies and gentlemen any more. But nobody had
once laughed at them&mdash;at him and Luce&mdash;since they came
here, and they had had nothing to be ashamed of. Now it was all
going to begin over again. Oh, if only there had been anywhere to
run to, he would have run away. But there wasn't, only just long,
straight roads.</p>

<p>Here Lucie put her mouth inside his ear and whispered guiltily
"I don't b'lieve you're a bit glad!"</p>

<p>"Are <i>you?</i>"</p>

<p>Luce nodded hard. Mamma was glad, so she was too; or she'd
thought she was till now. But Cuffy looked so funny that her little
soul began to be torn afresh, between these two arbiters of her
fate.</p>

<p>Cuffy wrinkled his lips up and his nose down. "You're not
<i>true!</i> I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"I am!" But her face puckered.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm <i>not</i>...not a scrap! So there! And if you want
to, you can go and tell."</p>

<p>But she didn't; she only cried. Cuffy was always making her cry.
He couldn't ever be nice and think the same as Mamma and her. He
always had to be diffrunt.</p>

<p>It certainly <i>was</i> hard though, to keep on being sorry,
when you saw how glad Mamma was. She smiled much more now, and
sewed shirts, and got them ready for Papa; and she bought a new
rocking-chair, specially for him to sit and rock in. And every day
was most dreadfully anxious to know if there wasn't a letter in the
mail-bag, to say when he was coming. And then she told them about
how unhappy Papa had been since he went away, and how he had to eat
his dinner off tin plates; and how they must try with all their
mights to make up to him for it. And then she went back and told
them all over again about when they were quite little, and how fond
Papa had been of them, and how he thought there were no children in
the world like his; and how, now he was old and ill, and not
himself, they must love him much more than ever before. It made you
feel <i>horrid</i>. But it didn't help; you <i>just</i>
<i>couldn't</i> be glad. It was like a stone you'd swallowed, which
stuck in you, and wouldn't go down.</p>

<p>And, at length, the suspense in which Mary lived was ended, by a
letter definitely fixing a date for the arrival of Richard and his
keepers. They would land at the neighbouring seaport, between eight
and nine in the morning. It was on her advice, Richard being so
excellent a sailor, that the sea route had been chosen for its
greater privacy, few people, even at this time of year, choosing to
undergo a buffeting round the wild coast. Now, all she had to do
was to send word over the road to Mr. Cadwallader Evans of the
Bank. Long since, this kind friend had placed his buggy and pair at
her disposal for the occasion.</p>

<p>She rose at six when the morning came, and was busy brushing and
shaking out her clothes: she had not been over the threshold since
her return from Melbourne. Not wishing to disgrace Richard by too
shabby an appearance, she put on her one remaining silk dress with
its many flounces, her jet-trimmed mantle, her best bonnet...in
which still nodded the red rose he had been used to fancy her in.
But her hands were cold and stupid as she hooked and buttoned and
tied strings; and, having climbed into the buggy and taken her
seat, she sat with a throat too dry for speech.</p>

<p>And after one or two well-meant efforts at encouragement, the
chatty little man who was her companion respected her mood. He
considered her "a dam fine woman for her age," and "a dam plucky
one, too," but held the errand they were out on for "a dam
unpleasant job," and one he had undertaken solely to please his
wife, who thought the world of Mrs. Mahony. He didn't dare even to
hum or to whistle, and so, except for a passing flip or chirrup to
the ponies, they drove mile after mile in silence, neither casting
so much as a glance at the landscape, which both thought ugly and
dull: once past the volcano&mdash;a knobbly bunch of island-hills
set in the middle of a shallow, weed-grown lake&mdash;it consisted
of unbroken grassy downs, which sloped to a sandy shore on which
the surf broke and thundered.</p>

<p>The wide streets of the little port were deserted; but at the
jetty quite a crowd had gathered. There stood passengers who had
already been landed, several idle girls and women, a goodly
sprinkling of larrikins. One and all had their eyes fixed on a
small rowing-boat that was making for the shore from the steamer,
which lay at anchor some way out.</p>

<p>Having dismounted and joined the throng, Mary asked of a young
girl standing by: "What is it? What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Ooo...such fun!" said the girl, and tittered. "See that boat?
There's a madman in it. He's being put off here. They've had to tie
his arms up."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you should let me see to things?...and you wait
in the buggy?" asked Mr. Evans in concern. But Mary shook her
head.</p>

<p>As the boat drew near, riding the surf, they saw that it
contained, besides the oarsmen, two burly men who sat stooped over
something lying prostrate on the floor of the boat. Mary hung back,
keeping on the outskirts of the crowd, the members of which now
pushed and pressed forward. But though the boat was alongside, its
oars shipped, nothing happened&mdash;or nothing but a series of
cries and shouts and angry exclamations, several men's voices going
at once.</p>

<p>"They can't make him get up, that's what it is," volunteered the
girl, her pretty face distorted with excitement. "I bet they'll
have to tie his legs as well, and then just haul him out. What fun
if he falls in the water!"</p>

<p>"I can't bear this," said Mary in an undertone; she believed she
could hear, as well, the sound of cuffs and blows. "I must see what
I can do." And in spite of her companion's demur, she stepped
forward. Bravely tossing her head, she said to those around her:
"Will you please let me pass? It's my husband."</p>

<p>They almost jumped aside to make way for her; open-mouthed,
embarrassed, or flushed a dark red, like the pretty girl. Mary felt
rather than saw the nudging elbows, the pointing and whispering,
as, herself now the gazing-stock, she walked through the opening
they left. Outwardly erect and composed, inwardly all a-quake, she
advanced to the edge of the jetty and went down three shallow steps
to the landing-place.</p>

<p>The rough voices ceased at her approach, and the warders
desisted from their efforts to shift a heavy body that struggled
desperately to oppose them.</p>

<p>"Please, stand back, and let me try." As she spoke she caught a
glimpse, at the bottom of the boat, of disordered clothing,
dishevelled strands of white hair, a pair of roped hands working
violently. Leaning as far over as she dared, she said in a low, but
clear voice: "Richard dear, it's me&mdash;Mary. Don't you know
me?"</p>

<p>On the instant the contortions ceased, and a kind of listening
silence ensued. Then came a palpable attempt on the part of the
prostrate form to raise itself; while a thin, cracked voice, which
she would never have recognised as Richard's, said in a tone of
extreme bewilderment: "Why, it's...it's Mrs. Mahony!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me; I've come to take you home. Get up,
Richard&mdash;but at once, dear!...and don't lie there like that.
The buggy's waiting." Again he made, she saw, a genuine effort to
obey; but once more fell back.</p>

<p>"Take that rope off his hands." And disregarding a warder's:
"Well, at your own risk, lady!" she added: "And help him up."</p>

<p>But this was easier said than done. No sooner did the men
approach him than his struggles began anew. He would not be touched
by them. It was left to Mr. Evans and one of the sailors, who had
not made off like the rest, to untie his wrists; after which,
seizing him under the armpits, they hoisted him on to the quay.
("Mrs. Mahony...why, it's Mrs. Mahony!" piped the thin voice.)</p>

<p>"And now take my arm and come quietly...as quietly as you can.
There are people watching. Show them how nicely you can walk."</p>

<p>("Mrs. Mahony...Mrs. Mahony.")</p>

<p>With him a dead weight on her right arm, Mr. Evans at his other
side pushing and supporting, they got his poor old shambling legs
up the steps and through the crowd. He was so cold and stiff from
exposure that it was all he could do to set one foot before the
other. He had no boots on, no hat, no greatcoat. Of the
carpet-slippers in which they had let him travel, one had been lost
or had fallen off in the boat; his sock was full of holes. In his
struggles the right-hand sleeve of his coat had been almost
wrenched from its armhole, his dirty shirt was collarless, his grey
hair, long uncut, hung down his neck.</p>

<p>And the fear he was in was pitiful to see: he turned his head
continually from side to side, trying to look back. "Where are
they? Oh, <i>don't</i> let them get the doctor!...don't let them
get him!"</p>

<p>"No, no, my darling!...don't be afraid. You're quite safe
now...with me." And as soon as he had been half shoved, half
dragged into the buggy, she sent her companion to warn the warders
to keep out of sight. If follow they must, it would have to be in a
separate vehicle.</p>

<p>On the drive home she took Richard's poor benumbed hands in hers
and chafed them; she spread her skirts over his knees to keep the
wind off, unhooked her mantle and bound it round his chest. His
teeth chattered; his face was grey with cold. Then, opening the
little bottle of wine and water and the packet of sandwiches which
she had brought with her, she fed him, sip by sip and bit by bit,
for he was ravenous with hunger and thirst. And though he quieted
down somewhat, under the shelter of the hood, she did not cease to
croon to him and comfort him. "It's all right, my dear, quite all
right now. Those horrid men are far away; you'll never, never see
them again. You're with me, your own Mary, who will look after you
and care for you." Until, his hunger stilled, his worst fears
allayed, exhausted, utterly weary, he put his head on her shoulder
and, with her arm laid round him to lessen the jolts of the road,
fell asleep, slumbering as peacefully as a child on its mother's
breast.</p>

<p>And so Richard Mahony came home.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ch-3-3-9" id="ch-3-3-9"></a>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>A week later Mary paid the warders off and dispatched them back
to Melbourne. Not once had she needed them; there had been
absolutely nothing for them to do&mdash;but hang about the hotel,
eating and drinking at her expense. She went, besides, in mortal
fear of Richard seeing them from the window, did they show
themselves in the street, and of the shock this sight might be,
undoing all the good she had done. So she handed out their
return-fares and paid their bill, gladly...even though this came to
a good deal more than she had expected, coarse brutes that they
were! For their part, they could hardly believe their ears when
they heard her report on Richard's behaviour since getting home;
and they remained pessimistic to the end. "Ah! you'll have trouble
with him yet, lady...for sure you will," were their final
words.</p>

<p>But she laughed in their faces. Richard was a lamb in her hands,
a little child, whom she could twist round her finger. Just now he
spent his time weeping from sheer happiness, as he strayed from
room to room of the little house...so wretchedly poor and mean
compared with any he had known. But he was blind to its
shortcomings. "And all this belongs to the doctor?...it's
<i>his</i> house?...he'll never have to go away from it again? And
these cups and plates&mdash;do they belong to the doctor,
too?...and may he drink out of them and eat off them? And is this
the doctor's own chair?" Again and again she had to assure him and
re-assure him: he might sit where he pleased, do what he liked, use
everything. With difficulty he took in his good fortune: at first,
any unexpected knock at the door made him shake and try to
hide.</p>

<p>Gradually, however&mdash;along with the marks and bruises that
stained his poor old body&mdash;his alarms died out, and his eyes
lost their hunted look. As long, that is to say, as Mary was with
him, or he knew her close at hand: her presence alone spelt
complete safety. It had been hard to make him understand that he
was not to follow her into the office; he couldn't grasp this, and
would often be found prowling round the office door, muttering
confusedly. Even after he had learnt his lesson,
she&mdash;hammering away at the key, or sitting stooped over her
desk&mdash;would sometimes see the door open by a crack, and
Richard's eyes and nose appear behind it...just to make sure. Then,
if she nodded and smiled and said: "It's all right, dear, I'm
here!" he would go away content. His devotion to her, his
submissive dependence on her, knew no bounds: a word of praise from
her made him happy, a reproof bewildered him to tears. And was he
really troublesome, she had only to warn him: "Richard, if you're
not good, I shan't be able to keep you," for him instantly to weep
and promise betterment. No one, not even the children, might in his
presence handle any object that he looked on as her peculiar
property: the teapot, her scissors, her brush and comb. "Put that
down...put it down at once! It belongs to Mrs. Mahony."</p>

<p>Fortunately he took quite a fancy to Mrs. Bowman, and had no
objection to being waited on by her&mdash;when the monthly
"statement" occupied Mary, or a visit from the Inspector impended.
But then Bowey was capital with him, hit just the right tone, and
never tried to order him about. She was a good cook, too, and,
since he was prescribed small quantities of nourishing food, she
was for ever popping in from the kitchen with a: "Now, sir, I've
got a nice little cup of soup here, made specially for
you...something I <i>know</i> you'll enjoy!" And he would let her
bind his table-napkin round his neck, and even, in default of Mary,
feed him with a spoon, to avoid the pitiful dropping and spilling
that otherwise went on. He invariably addressed her as "the Cook,"
and spoke to her, and of her, as if she stood at the head of a
large staff of servants. (Whose non-existence, oddly enough, he did
not seem to remark.) For it was just as if a sponge had been passed
over a large part of his brain, mercifully wiping out every memory
of the terrible later years. He re-lived the period of his greatest
prosperity; was once more, in imagination, either the well-to-do
property-owner, or the distinguished physician. And since only
those images persisted which had to do with one or other of these
periods, his late-born children meant little to him: if he thought
or spoke of them, it was as though they were still in their
infancy. Sometimes, seeing them stand so tall and sturdy before
him&mdash;a well&mdash;grown girl and boy of seven and
eight&mdash;he grew quite confused. While, asked by Mary if he
remembered his little lost daughter, he looked at her with stupid,
darkened eyes, and could not think what she meant.</p>

<p>By seven of a morning, he was washed and dressed and fed. Eight
o'clock, when the office opened, saw him comfortably settled in the
rocking-chair. Here his day was spent. The chair stood by the
window, which gave on the cross-roads and the main street; from it,
he could see all that went on in the township. But his chief
occupation was "reading." For his sake Mary subscribed to a
Melbourne newspaper&mdash;though this was a day and a half old
before it reached them. But, for anything it mattered to him, it
might have borne the date of a month back. As often as not, he read
it upside down; his spectacles perched at an impossible angle on
the extreme tip of his long, thin nose. In this position he loved
to proclaim the news, to whoever had time to listen: Mary, slipping
in and out; Mrs. Bowman, come to see that he wanted for nothing.
And his information was invariably of some long past event: the
death of Prince Albert, the siege of Sebastopol, the Indian Mutiny.
And there good old Bowey would stand, her hands clasped under her
apron, exclaiming: "What doings, sir, what awful doings you do tell
of!"&mdash;for, to throw his hearer into a state of surprise, even
of consternation, was one of the things that pleased him best.</p>

<p>Tired of reading, he would talk to himself by the hour together;
his clear voice, with its light Irish slur, ringing through the
house. And hampered no longer by those shackles of pride and
reserve which had made him the most modest of men, his theme was
now always, and blatantly, himself. This self&mdash;to whom, as to
every one else, he referred only in the third person&mdash;was the
pivot round which his thoughts revolved, he passionately asserting
and reasserting its identity, in a singsong that was not unlike a
chant. "Richard Townshend Mahony, F.R.C.S., M.D., Edinburgh, R. T.
Mahony, M.D. and Accoucheur; Specialist for the Diseases of Women;
Consulting Physician to the Ballarat Hospital!" and so on: only,
the list having been sung through, untiringly to begin afresh.</p>

<p>In appearance, now that he was once more clean and well
cared-for, he remained a striking-looking man, with his straight,
delicate features, his cloven chin, the silver hair smoothed back
from his high forehead; and often, on coming into the room and
catching him seated and in profile&mdash;his gait, of course, was
lamentable; he had never recovered the proper use of his
legs&mdash;Mary had a passing, ghostlike glimpse of the man who had
been. It was his eyes that gave him away. There had been a time
when these blue-grey eyes had looked out on life with the
expression of a wantonly hurt animal. Still later, a day when they
had seldom lifted, but had brooded before them, turned inward on
torments visible to them alone. Now they met yours again, but as it
were shrilly and blindly, all the soul gone out of them; nor ever a
trace remaining of their former puzzlement over life the destroyer.
He was now the least troubled of men. Content and happiness had
come to him at last, in full measure. No more doubts, or
questionings, or wrestlings with the dark powers in himself: no
anxiety over ways and means (Mary was there, Mary would provide);
never a twinge of the old passionate ache for change and
renewal...for flight from all familiar things. He desired to be
nowhere but here: had, at long last, found rest and peace, within
the four walls of a room measuring but a few feet square; that
peace for which he had sought, desperately and vainly, throughout
the whole of his conscious life; to which he would otherwise have
attained only through death's gates.</p>

<p>To see him thus was Mary's reward: Mary, grown so thin that she
could count her ribs; with black rings round her eyes,
"salt-cellars" above and below her collar-bones; with enlarged,
knobby knuckles, and feet that grew daily flatter. But she had no
time to think of herself&mdash;to think at all, in fact&mdash;nor
did she linger regretfully over what had been, or grieve in advance
for what was bound to come. And Richard's condition ceased to
sadden her: valiantly she accepted the inevitable.</p>

<p>It was another matter with the children, who had in them a
goodly share of Mahony's own thin-skinnedness. Cuffy and Lucie
never grew used or resigned to the state of things: their father's
imbecile presence lay a dead weight on their young lives. And
violently conflicting feelings swung them to and fro. If, at
dinner, Papa was scolded for spilling his food, or for
gobbling&mdash;and he was most <i>dreadf'ly</i> greedy&mdash;Luce's
eyes would shut so tight that almost you couldn't see she had any:
while he, Cuffy, red as a turkey-cock, would start to eat just like
Papa, from being made so sorry and uncomfortable to hear a big man
scolded like a baby. They kept out of his way as much as possible,
being also subtly hurt by his lack of recognition of them, when he
knew Mamma so well: they were just as much belonging to him as
Mamma! And, home from their morning lessons at the parsonage, they
withdrew to the bottom of the yard, where Mamma couldn't so easily
find them. For she was always trying to make Papa notice
them...when you knew quite well he didn't care. It would be: "Show
Papa your copybook...how nicely you can write now," or: "Let him
see your new boots." At which something naughty would get up in
Cuffy, and make him say nastily: "What for?...what's the good? He
doesn't <i>really</i> look!" But then Mamma would look so sorry
that it hurt, and say: "Oh, you must be kind to him, Cuffy! And try
not to let him feel it."</p>

<p>A doctor drove over once a week from Burrabool to write
medicines for Papa, and he said Papa ought to take exercise, and it
would be a good thing for him to go a short walk...every single
day. And of course he and Luce had to do this, to help Mamma. For
half an hour. The thought of it spoiled the whole
morning&mdash;like a whipping.</p>

<p>"Does it matter which way we go?"</p>

<p>Cuffy never failed to ask this, as a sop to his conscience. But
really they always went the same road, the one that led straight
out of the township. For, if you got past the lock-up, where the
constable's little girl might be swinging on the gate, you were
quite certain not to meet anybody. To make sure she wasn't, you
first sent Luce out to look, then fetched Papa and hurried him by.
After that, though, you had to walk as slow as slow, because he
couldn't hardly walk at all: his knees bent and stuck out at every
step. You each held his hand, and went on, counting the minutes
till it was time to turn back. And to find when this was, you had
to get his watch out of his pocket yourself and look at
it&mdash;which he didn't like, for he thought you were going to
take it away from him. But it was no use asking him the time,
because he said such funny things. Like: "The time is out of
joint," or: "A time to be born and a time to die!"</p>

<p>But when you said it was far enough and they could go home, and
turned him round, he was glad, too; and the whole way back he
talked about nothing but his tea, and what there was going to be
for it. And when Mamma came to the door she didn't say what she
would have said to <i>them</i>, that it was greedy and piggy to
think about your meals so long beforehand. She just said: "Tea's
all ready, dear; and Bowey has made you some delicious scones." He
and Luce only had bread and butter, and didn't want it. They liked
best to go and play like mad, because the walk was done, and they
didn't have to do it again till next day.</p>

<p>But then came that awful afternoon when...ugh! he didn't like
even to <i>think</i> about it...ever afterwards.</p>

<p>They had gone out as usual and walked along the road, and nobody
saw them. And he was just going to fetch Papa's watch to look at
the time...or had he <i>tried</i> to and it wouldn't come, and he
had pulled at it? He could never feel quite, quite sure: it
remained a horrible doubt. And then, all of a sudden, quite
suddenly Papa fell down. "His legs just seemed to shut up, Mamma,
really, truly they did!" (when she accused them of having hurried
him). They couldn't stop him...Luce nearly tumbled down, too...and
Papa fell flat on his face and lay there; and it had rained, and
the road was dirty, and he lay in it, so that his clothes and his
face were full of mud. And he called out and so did Luce: "Get up,
Papa, you'll be all wet and dirty!" and again: "Mamma will be so
cross if you don't!" and despairingly: "Oh, dear Papa, <i>do</i>
get up and don't just lie there!" And then he did try, but couldn't
seem to make his legs work properly, and went on lying with his
face and hair in the dirt&mdash;quite flat. And they tugged and
tugged at him, at his arms and his coat, but couldn't move him, he
was so big and heavy; and Luce began to cry; and he felt such a
bone come in his own throat that he thought he'd have to cry, too.
He began to be afraid the mud would choke Papa, and what would
Mamma say then? And Papa kept on asking: "What is it? What's the
doctor doing?" And then he shouted out, like as if he was deaf:
"You've fallen down, Papa &mdash;oh, <i>do</i> get up! <i>What</i>
shall we do if you don't!" And he said to Luce to run home and
fetch Mamma, but she was frightened to; and she was frightened to
stay there while he went; and so he felt his heart would burst, for
they couldn't leave Papa alone. But just then a man came driving in
a spring-cart, and when he saw them he stopped and said: "Hullo,
you kids, what's up?" And "Whoa!" to his horse, and got out. And
first he laughed a little, and winked at them, for he thought Papa
was tipsy; but when they told him, and said it was their Papa who
couldn't walk any more because his legs were wrong, he stopped
laughing and was kind. He took hold of Papa till he made him stand
up, and then he let down the flap of the cart and helped him in,
and lifted them up, too, and they drove home that way, their legs
hanging out at the back. And when they got to the post office Mamma
came running to the door, and had a most awful fright when she saw
Papa so wet and dirty, with mud on his face and hair, and scratched
with stones where they had pulled him; and she sort of screamed
out: "Oh, <i>what's</i> the matter? What have you done to him?"
(and they hadn't done anything at all). But she was so sorry for
Papa, and so busy washing him clean and telling him not to cry,
that she didn't have any time to think about them, or how upset
they were. They went away and were together by themselves, at the
bottom of the yard.</p>

<p>After this, though, they didn't have to take Papa walking any
more. He never went out.&mdash;But the memory of the accident
persisted, and was entangled in their dreams for many a night to
come. Especially Cuffy's. Cuffy would start up, his nightclothes
damp with sweat, from a dream that Papa had fallen dead in the road
and that he had killed him. And, all his life long, the sight of a
heavy body lying prostrate and unable to rise&mdash;a horse down in
its traces, even a drunkard stretched oblivious by the
roadside&mdash;had the power to throw him into the old childish
panic, and make him want blindly to turn and run...and run...till
he could run no more.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-3-3-10" id="ch-3-3-10"></a>Chapter X</h3>

<p>Thus the shadows deepened. For still some time Mahony contrived
to cover, unaided, the few yards that separated bedroom from
sitting-room. Then he took to shouldering his way along the walls,
supporting himself by the furniture. And soon, even this mode of
progression proving beyond him, he needed the firm prop of an arm
on either side, was he to reach his seat by the window. Finally his
chair was brought to the bedside, and, with him in it, was pushed
and pulled by the two women to the adjoining room.</p>

<p>He never set foot to the ground again; was very prisoner to this
chair. Nor could he stoop, or bend his body sideways; and did he
now drop his spectacles, or let his paper flutter to the floor, the
house resounded with cries of "Mrs. Mahony, Mrs. Mahony!" or "the
Cook, the Cook!" Dead from the waist down, he sat wooden and rigid;
and the light of the poor clouded brain that topped this moribund
trunk grew daily feebler. His newspaper ceased to interest him; he
no longer hymned his own praises: he just sat and stared before
him, in mournful vacancy.</p>

<p>Oh, what a work it was to die!&mdash;to shake off a body that
had no more worth left in it than a snake's cast skin, Mary could
imagine him saying of himself.&mdash;Not so she. She clung
jealously to each day on which she still had him with her; plodding
to and fro on hot, swollen feet; gladly performing the last, sordid
duties of the sick-room.</p>

<p>Then, gangrene setting in, he became bedridden; and she and
Bowey united their strength to turn him from side to side, or to
raise him the few necessary inches on his pillow. He was grown
quite silent now, and indifferent to every one; the sight of food
alone called up a flicker of interest in his dull eyes. But the day
came when even to swallow soft jellies and custards was beyond him,
and a few teaspoonfuls of liquid formed his sole nourishment. And
at length his throat refusing even this office, there was nothing
to be done but to sit and watch him die.</p>

<p>For three days he lay in coma. On the third, the doctor gave it
as his opinion that he would not outlive the night.</p>

<p>Beside the low, trestle-bed in which, for greater convenience,
they had laid him, and on which his motionless body formed a long,
straight hummock under the blankets, Mary sat and looked her last
on the familiar face, now so soon to be hidden from her...it might
be for ever. For who knew, who could <i>really</i> know, if they
would meet again? In health, in the bustle of living, it was easy
to believe in heaven and a life to come. But when the blow fell,
and those you loved passed into the great Silence, where you could
not get at them, or they at you, then doubts, aching doubts took
possession of one. She had sunk under them when her child died; she
knew them now, still more fiercely. Death might quite well be the
end of everything; just so many bones rotting in a grave.&mdash;And
even if it was not, if there <i>was</i> more to come, how could it
ever be quite the same again?&mdash;the same Richard to look at,
and with all his weaknesses, who had belonged to her for nearly
thirty years. She didn't believe it. If heaven existed, and was
what people said it was, then it would certainly turn him into
something different: a stranger...an angel!&mdash;and what had she
to do with angels? She wanted the man himself, the dear warm
incompetent human creature at whose side she had been through so
much. Who had so tried, so harassed her, made her suffer
so.&mdash;Oh, as if that mattered now! What <i>was</i> life, but
care and suffering?&mdash;for every one alike. His had never been
much else. Even though his troubles were mostly of his own making.
For he had always asked more of life than it could give: and if,
for once, he got what he wanted, he had not known how to sit fast
and hold it: so the end was the poor old wreck on the bed before
her. Now, death was best. Death alone could wipe out the shame and
disgrace that had befallen him&mdash;the shame of failure, the
degradation of his illness. Best for the children, too; his passing
would lift a shadow from their lives...they were so young still,
they would soon forget. Yes, best for every one...only not for her.
With Richard, the most vital part of herself&mdash;a part
compounded of shared experience, and mutual endeavour, and the
common memories of a lifetime&mdash;would go down into the
grave.&mdash;Burying her face in her hands, Mary wept.</p>

<p>By day, for the children's, for her work's sake, she was forced
to bear up. Now there was nobody to see or hear her. The office was
closed, the children slept: old Bowey dozed over the lamp in the
kitchen. She could weep, without fear of surprise, alone with him
who had passed beyond the sound of human grief; in this little back
room where, by the light of a single candle, monstrous shadows
splashed walls and ceiling: shadows that stirred, and seemed to
have a life of their own; for it was winter now, and the wild
Australian wind shrilled round the house, and found its way in
through the loosely fitting sashes.</p>

<p>How long she sat thus she did not know: she had lost count of
time. But, of a sudden, something...a something felt not heard, and
felt only by a quickening of her pulses...made her catch her
breath, pause in her crying, strain her ears, look up. And as she
did so her heart gave a great bound, then seemed to leave off
beating. <i>He had come back</i>. His lids were raised, his eyes
half open. And in the breathless silence that followed, when each
tick of the little clock on the chest of drawers was separately
audible, she saw his lips, too, move. He was trying to speak. She
bent over him, hardly daring to breathe, and caught, or thought she
caught the words: "Not grieve...for me. I'm going...into
Eternity."</p>

<p>Whether they were actually meant for her, or whether a mere
instinctive response to the sound of her weeping, she could not
tell. But dropping on her knees by the bedside, she took his
half-cold hand in her warm, live one, and kissed and fondled it.
And his lids, which had fallen to again, made one last supreme
effort to rise, and this time there was no mistaking the whisper
that came over his lips.</p>

<p>"Dear wife!"</p>

<p>He was gone again, even as he said it, but it was enough...more
than enough! Laying her head down beside his, she pressed her face
against the linen of the pillow, paying back to this inanimate
object the burning thankfulness with which she no longer dared to
trouble him. Eternity was something vast, cold, impersonal. But
this little phrase, from the long past days of love and
comradeship, these homely, familiar words, fell like balsam on her
heart. All his love for her, his gratitude to her, was in them:
they were her reward, and a full and ample one, for a lifetime of
unwearied sacrifice.</p>

<p>Dear wife!...dear wife.</p>

<p>He died at dawn, his faint breaths fluttering to rest.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Close on two days had to elapse before relative or friend could
get to her side: by the time Jerry and Tilly reached Gymgurra, she
herself had made all arrangements for the last rites, and Richard
was washed and dressed and in his coffin, which stood on a pair of
trestles just outside the kitchen door, the doorways of the rooms
having proved too narrow to admit it. There he lay, with a large
bunch of white violets in his folded hands, looking very calm and
peaceful, but also inexpressibly remote&mdash;from them all, from
everything. Never again would the clatter of crockery or the odours
of cooking flay his nerves.</p>

<p>The children, feeling oddly shy, sought their usual refuge; and
when strange men came with the coffin, and there was a great
walking about and tramping, they were told to keep out of the way.
But afterwards Mamma called them in, and took their hands and took
them to see Papa, who was all put in his coffin now, with a bunch
of flowers in front of him and his head on a most <i>beautiful</i>
satin pillow trimmed with lace. And Mamma kissed him and stroked
his hair, and said how young and handsome he looked, with the
wrinkles gone away from his face; but Cuffy only thought he looked
most frightfully asleep.</p>

<p>Luce had to have her hand held every time she went by; but he
didn't; he didn't care. And all the time Papa had lain in bed and
was so ill, he hadn't either. Even when he heard he was dead, and
saw him with a sheet pulled over his face, it didn't seem to make
any difference. Or wouldn't have, if other people hadn't been so
sorry for him. To see them sorry gradually made him sorry, too. For
himself. And that night, when a great fat moon was on the sky, he
went away and stood and looked up at it, and then something that
was just like a line of poetry came into his head, and he said it
over and over, and it went: "Now the moon looked down on a
fatherless child!"</p>

<p>Next day though, when Papa was put in and you couldn't help
seeing him every time you went along the passage, it was different.
And when Mamma got a large pocket-handkerchief and spread it over
his face and hands (when you were dead you couldn't shooh the flies
away, and they liked to walk on you), then he suddenly felt he
wanted to see Papa again, most awfully much. So when nobody was
about, he went and pulled the handkerchief off, and had a good long
look at him: much longer than when he was alive; for then Papa
wouldn't have liked it; besides him being too shy. Now he could
stare and stare; and he did; till he saw a secret: Papa had a
little black mole at the side of his nose, which he had never seen
before. This, and what Bowey said: that they would soon come now
and screw the lid down (just as he was, with the little mole, and
his eyelashes, and everything), gave him a very queer feeling
inside, and made his knees seem as if they weren't going to hold
him up much longer. He had to look away...quickly...look at the
violets, which had been sent as a present: Papa was holding them
just as if he was still alive. And when he saw them, he suddenly
felt he would like to give him something, too. But only potatoes
grew in the yard. Potatoes had quite pretty little flowers when
they did have, white and purple, only they weren't come yet. But
that afternoon, when he was at the parsonage with a note and was
coming away again, he <i>stole</i> a flower (a <i>lovely</i> little
"polyanthers"), his heart beating nearly to choke him from having
to step on the flower bed, which was all raked in lines, and in
case he should be seen from the window. It got rather crushed being
in his pocket, but it was very pretty, red and yellow, with
bevelledy edges, and soft like velvet. And when Mamma was in the
office and Bowey washing sheets, he went on tiptoe to Papa to put
his flower in. He meant to hide it under the violets, where nobody
but him would know; but doing this his hand touched
Papa's&mdash;and that was the end of everything. The mere feel of
it, colder&mdash;much, much colder&mdash;than a glass, or a plate,
or a frog's back, filled him with horror...he nearly screamed out
loud...and just dropped the flower anywhere and the handkerchief
all rumpled up, and ran for his life. And tore and tore, out of the
house and down the yard...to the only quite private place he
knew...where no one but him ever went: the space between the closet
and the fence, so narrow that you had to squeeze in sideways. And
he was only just in time. Before he quite got there he'd begun to
cry&mdash;as he'd never cried before. It came jumping out of him,
in great big sobs.&mdash;He was <i>glad</i> Papa was
dead&mdash;yes, ever so glad!&mdash;he told himself so, over and
over. He'd never, never, never need to take him for walks again.
And nobody would ever laugh, or point their fingers at them, or
make fun of them, any more. For if you were once dead you stopped
dead&mdash;he knew that now. Not like when Lallie died, and he had
gone on waiting for her to come back. Papa would never come
back...or walk about...or speak to them again. He was going down
into the ground, just like he was, with the shiny pillow, and the
violets, and...and everything.&mdash;Oh, no, <i>no</i>! he couldn't
bear it...he couldn't&mdash;even to think of it nearly killed him.
And he stamped his feet and stamped them, in a frenzy of rebellious
rage. Oh, he <i>would</i> be good, and not care about anything, if
only&mdash;if only...he'd take him for
walks&mdash;anywhere!&mdash;yes, he would!&mdash;if only...Oh,
Papa!...dear, darling Papa!...come back, come back!</p>

<p>Afterwards, he had to go out of the gate and hang about the
road, till his eyes got un-red again: not for anything would he
have let Mamma or Luce or Bowey know he had had to cry.&mdash;And
it made him feel hot and prickly all over, when he went indoors, to
see that somebody (Mamma most likely) had found the little tumbled
polyanthers and picked it up and put it right in the middle of the
bunch of violets. <i>That</i> hurt more than anything.</p>

<p>At the last moment, the doctor who was to have attended the
funeral telegraphed that he was unavoidably detained. This left an
empty place in the single mourning coach; and Tilly, scandalised as
she was by the paucity of mourners, straightway fell to work to
drape a streamer round Cuffy's sailor-hat and sew a band on his
left sleeve&mdash;she had arrived laden with gifts of crepe and
other black stuffs. Open-mouthed, aghast, Cuffy heard his doom.
But, though quaking inwardly, he clenched his teeth and said not a
word: just stood and let her sew him. Because of Mamma.</p>

<p>It was Mary, suddenly grown aware of his silent agony, who came
out of her own grief to say: "No, Tilly, let the child be!...I
won't have him forced. Richard would have been the last to wish
it."</p>

<p>But scarcely had Cuffy breathed again, when he was plunged into
a fresh confusion. Men came to shut down the coffin; and then,
while Mamma was waying good-bye to Papa, she suddenly burst out
crying&mdash;oh, simply <i>dreadfully!</i> He felt himself blush
over his whole body, to hear her&mdash;<i>his</i>
Mamma!&mdash;going on like this in front of these strange people,
so fierce and don't-carish, and with her face all red and wrinkled
up like a baby's. But she didn't seem to mind, and didn't take a
bit of notice when he poked her with his elbow and said: "Oh, hush,
Mamma! They'll hear you." Or of Uncle Jerry either, who put his
hand on her shoulder and said: "It's all for the best, old
girl&mdash;believe me, it is!" Aunt Tilly blew her nose so loud it
hurt your ears, and winked and blinked with her eyes; but what
<i>she</i> said was: "Remember, love, you're not left quite alone;
you've got your children. <i>They'll</i> be your comfort. From now
on they'll put aside their naughty ways and be as good as
gold&mdash;I know they will." (Huh!)</p>

<p>The hearse stood at the door, its double row of fantastic
plumes, more brown than sable from long usage and the strong
sunlight, nodding in the breeze. Brownish, too, were the antique,
funereal draperies that hung almost to the ground from the backs of
two lean horses. The blinds in the neighbouring houses went down
with a rush; and the narrow box, containing all that remained of
the medley of hopes and fears, joys and sorrows and untold
struggles, that had been Richard Mahony, was shouldered and carried
out. The mourners&mdash;Jerry, the parson, the Bank
manager&mdash;took their seats in the carriage, and the little
procession got under way.</p>

<p>Rounding the corner and passing in turn the fire-bell, the
Rechabites' Hall and the flour-mill, hearse and coach, resembling
two black smudges on empty space, set to crawling up the slope that
led out of the township. From the top of this rise the road could
be seen for miles, running without curve or turn through the grassy
plains. About midway, in a slight dip, was visible the little
fenced-in square of the cemetery, its sprinkling of white
headstones forming a landmark in the bare, undulating country.</p>

<p>Amid these wavy downs Mahony was laid to rest.&mdash;It would
have been after his own heart that his last bed was within sound of
what he had perhaps loved best on earth&mdash;the open sea. A
quarter of a mile off, behind a sandy ridge, the surf, driving in
from the Bight, breaks and booms eternally on the barren shore.
Thence, too, come the fierce winds, which, in stormy weather, hurl
themselves over the land, where not a tree, not a bush, nor even a
fence stands to break their force. Or to limit the outlook. On all
sides the eye can range, unhindered, to where the vast earth meets
the infinitely vaster sky. And, under blazing summer suns, or when
a full moon floods the night, no shadow falls on the sun-baked or
moon-blanched plains, but those cast by the few little stones set
up in human remembrance.</p>

<p>All that was mortal of Richard Mahony has long since crumbled to
dust. For a time, fond hands tended his grave, on which in due
course a small cross rose, bearing his name, and marking the days
and years of his earthly pilgrimage. But, those who had known and
loved him passing, scattering, forgetting, rude weeds choked the
flowers, the cross toppled over, fell to pieces and was removed,
the ivy that entwined it uprooted. And, thereafter, his
resting-place was indistinguishable from the common ground. The
rich and kindly earth of his adopted country absorbed his
perishable body, as the country itself had never contrived to make
its own, his wayward, vagrant spirit.</p>
