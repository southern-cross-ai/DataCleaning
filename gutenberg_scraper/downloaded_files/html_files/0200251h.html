<p align="CENTER"><font size="+1">PREFACE</font><br>
</p>

<p><font size="+3">T</font>HE gracious reception given to my several
reports of field studies among primitive racial groups and the many
requests for copies of those brief reports and for further data,
together with the need for providing interpretations and applications
of the data, have induced me to consolidate my investigations. There
have also been many requests from my patients and from members of the
medical and dental professions for concise statements as to what I have
found that would be useful as preventive procedures. In addition I have
been conscious of an opportunity for helpfulness to the members of the
various primitive races that I have studied and who are so rapidly
declining in health and numbers at their point of contact with our
modern civilization. Since they have so much accumulated wisdom that is
passing with them, it has seemed important that the elements in the
modern contacts that are so destructive to them should be discovered
and removed.</p>

<p>    There has been a deep sense of obligation to the officials of
many countries for the great kindness and assistance that they have so
cheerfully given by providing the opportunity for these investigations.
The list of these individuals is much too long to mention them all by
name. One of the joys of my work has been the privilege of knowing the
magnificent characters that are at the outposts earnestly striving to
better the welfare of the natives whom they are ministering to, but who

<p align="center"><font size="+1">INTRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">T</font>HIS text provides a new approach to some
problems of modern degeneration. Instead of the customary procedure of
analyzing the expressions of degeneration, a search has been made for
groups to be used as controls who are largely free from these
affections.</p>

<p>    After spending several years approaching this problem by both
clinical and laboratory research methods, I interpreted the
accumulating evidence as strongly indicating the absence of some
essential factors from our modern program, rather than the presence of
injurious factors. This immediately indicated the need for obtaining
controls. To accomplish this it became necessary to locate immune
groups which were found readily as isolated remnants of primitive
racial stocks in different parts of the world. A critical examination
of these groups revealed a high immunity to many of our serious
affections so long as they were sufficiently isolated from our modern
civilization and living in accordance with the nutritional programs
which were directed by the accumulated wisdom of the group. In every
instance where individuals of the same racial stocks who had lost this
isolation and who had adopted the foods and food habits of our modern
civilization were examined, there was an early loss of the high
immunity characteristics of the isolated group. These studies have
included a chemical analysis of foods of the isolated groups and also
of the displacing foods of our modern civilization.</p>

<p>    These investigations have been made among the following
primitive racial stocks including both isolated and modernized groups:
the Swiss of Switzerland, the Gaelics in the Outer and Inner Hebrides,
the Eskimos of Alaska, the Indians in the far North, West and Central
Canada, Western United States and Florida, the Melanesians and
Polynesians on eight archipelagos of the Southern Pacific, tribes in
eastern and central Africa, the Aborigines of Australia, Malay tribes
on islands north of Australia, the Maori of New Zealand and the ancient
civilizations and their descendants in Peru both along the coast and in
the Sierras, also in the Amazon Basin. Where available the modernized
whites in these communities also were studied. There have been many
important unexpected developments in these investigations. While a
primary quest was to find the cause of tooth decay which was
established quite readily as being controlled directly by nutrition, it
rapidly became apparent that a chain of disturbances developed in these
various primitive racial stocks starting even in the first generation
after the adoption of the modernized diet and rapidly increased in
severity with expressions quite constantly like the characteristic
degenerative processes of our modern civilization of America and
Europe. While tooth decay has proved to be almost entirely a matter of
the nutrition of the individual at the time and prior to the activity
of that disease, a group of affections have expressed themselves in
physical form. These have included facial and dental arch changes
which, heretofore, have been accounted for as results of admixtures of
different racial stocks. My investigations have revealed that these
same divergencies from normal are reproduced in all these various
racial stocks while the blood is still pure. Indeed, these even develop
in those children of the family that are born after the parents adopted
the modern nutrition.</p>

<p>    Applying these methods of study to our American families, we
find readily that a considerable percentage of our families show this
same deterioration in the younger members. The percentage of
individuals so affected in our American communities in which I have
made studies varies through a wide range, usually between 25 per cent
to 75 per cent. A certain percentage of this affected group has not
only these evidences of physical injury, but also personality
disturbances, the most common of which is a lower than normal mental
efficiency and acuteness, chiefly observed as so-called mental
backwardness which includes the group of children in the schools who
are unable to keep up with their classmates. Their I.Q.'s are generally
lower than normal and they readily develop inferiority complexes
growing out of their handicap. From this group or parallel with it a
certain percentage develop personality disturbances which have their
expression largely in unsocial traits. They include the delinquents who
at this time are causing so much trouble and concern because of
evidence of increase in their numbers. This latter group has been
accounted for largely on the basis of some conditioning experience that
developed after the child had reached an impressionable age. My
investigations are revealing a physical structural change and
therefore, an organic factor which precedes and underlies these
conditioning influences of the environment. The fact that a government
survey has shown that 66 per cent of the delinquents who have been
treated in the best institutions and released as cured, later have
developed their unsocial or criminal tendencies, strongly emphasizes
the urgent necessity that if preventive methods are to be applied these
must precede and forestall the primary injuries themselves.</p>

<p>    While it has been known that certain injuries were directly
related to an inadequate nutrition of the mother during the formative
period of the child, my investigations are revealing evidence that the
problem goes back still further to defects in the germ plasms as
contributed by the two parents. These injuries, therefore, are related
directly to the physical condition of one or of both of these
individuals prior to the time that conception took place.</p>

<p>    A very important phase of my investigations has been the
obtaining of information from these various primitive racial groups
indicating that they were conscious that such injuries would occur if
the parents were not in excellent physical condition and nourishment.
Indeed, in many groups I found that the girls were not allowed to be
married until after they had had a period of special feeding. In some
tribes a six months period of special nutrition was required before
marriage. An examination of their foods has disclosed special
nutritional factors which are utilized for this purpose.</p>

<p>    The scope of this work, accordingly, becomes of direct interest
in many fields including the various branches of the healing arts,
particularly medicine and dentistry, and the social organizations that
are concerned with betterment of the racial stock. Similarly, the
educational groups are concerned directly since, if we are to stem the
tide by passing new information on to the parents of the new
generation, it must be done prior to the time the emergency shall
arise. This involves a system of education directed particularly to the
high school age pupils.</p>

<p>    The data that are being presented in the following chapters
suggest the need for reorientation in many problems of our modern
social organization. The forces involved in heredity have in general
been deemed to be so powerful as to be able to resist all impacts and
changes in the environment. These data will indicate that much that we
have interpreted as being due to heredity is really the result of
intercepted heredity. While great emphasis has been placed on the
influence of the environment on the character of the individual, the
body pattern has generally been supposed to require a great number of
impacts of a similar nature to alter the design. The brain has been
assumed to be similarly well organized in most individuals except that
incidents in the life of the individual such as disappointments,
fright, etc., are largely responsible for disturbed behavior. Normal
brain functioning has not been thought of as being as biologic as
digestion. The data provided in the succeeding chapters indicate that
associated with disturbances in the development of the bones of the
head, disturbances may at the same time occur in the development of the
brain. Such structural defects usually are not hereditary factors even
though they appear in other members of the family or parents. They are
products of the environment rather than hereditary units transmitted
from the ancestry.</p>

<p>    In the light of these data important new emphasis is placed on
the quality of the germ cells of the two parents as well as on the
environment provided by the mother. The new evidence indicates that the
paternal contribution may be an injured product and that the
responsibility for defective germ cells may have to be about equally
divided between the father and mother. The blending of races has been
blamed for much of the distortion and defects in body form in our
modern generation. It will be seen that these face changes occur in all
the pure blood races studied in even the first generation, after the
nutrition of the parents has been changed.</p>

<p>    The origin of personality and character appear in the light of
the newer data to be biologic products and to a much less degree than
usually considered pure hereditary traits. Since these various factors
are biologic, being directly related to both the nutrition of the
parents and to the nutritional environment of the individuals in the
formative and growth period any common contributing factor such as food
deficiencies due to soil depletion will be seen to produce degeneration
of the masses of people due to a common cause. Mass behavior therefore,
in this new light becomes the result of natural forces, the expression
of which may not be modified by propaganda but will require correction
at the source. Nature has been at this process of building human
cultures through many millenniums and our culture has not only its own
experience to draw from but that of parallel races living today as well
as those who lived in the past. This work, accordingly, includes data
that have been obtained from several of Nature's other biologic
experiments to throw light on the problems of our modern white
civilization.</p>

<p>    In presenting the evidence I am utilizing photographs very
liberally. A good illustration is said to be equivalent to a thousand
words of text. This is in keeping too with the recent trend in
journalism. The pictures are much more convincing than words can be,
and since the text challenges many of the current theories, the most
conclusive evidence available is essential.</p>

<p>    Owing to the many requests received for slides or the loan of my
negatives, provision is being made for supplying a limited number of
slides of the illustrations in either black and white or in color.
Slides of other subjects are available.</p>

<p align="center"><i><font size="+1">Chapter 1</font></i></p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">WHY SEEK WISDOM FROM PRIMITIVE
PEOPLES</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">S</font>OME of the primitive races have avoided
certain of the life problems faced by modernized groups and the methods
and knowledge used by the primitive peoples are available to assist
modernized individuals in solving their problems. Many primitive races
have made habitual use of certain preventive measures in meeting
crucial life problems.</p>

<p>    Search for controls among remnants of primitive racial stocks
has been resorted to as a result of failure to find them in our
modernized groups or to find the controlling factors by applying
laboratory methods to the affected clinical material. Only the
primitive groups have been able to provide adequate normal
controls.</p>

<p>    In the following chapters, I have presented descriptions of
certain peoples and their environments in primitive state, and, for
comparative study, descriptions of members of the primitive tribes who
have been in contact with modernized white races. I have recorded the
effects of that contact as expressed in physical and character changes,
and have given a survey of the factors in the environment which have
changed. It has been necessary to study in this way a wide variety of
primitive groups and physical environments. It will, accordingly, be
advisable for the reader to keep in mind the comparative effects of
different altitudes, latitudes, temperatures and races, and to note the
similarity of the reactions of these primitive groups when contact is
made with our modern civilization. The purpose is to glean data that
will be applicable for use in correcting certain tragic expressions of
our modern degeneration, including tooth decay, general physical
degeneration, and facial and dental-arch deformities, and character
changes. These data will be useful in preventing race decay and
deformities, in establishing a higher resistance to infective diseases,
and in reducing the number of prenatal deficiency injuries. These
latter include such expressions as mental deficiencies caused by brain
defects in the formative period, which result in mental disturbances
ranging from moderate backwardness to character abnormalities.</p>

<p>    The data presented show the level of susceptibility to dental
caries (tooth decay) in each isolated primitive group and, contrasted
with that, the level of susceptibility in the modernized natives of the
same stock. A r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the changes in the environment
that are associated with the changes in immunity and susceptibility
will be presented. These data reveal an average increase in
susceptibility of thirty-five fold. Similar contrasts are shown in
relation to the relative incidence of facial and dental arch
deformities among primitive natives and modernized natives.</p>

<p>    It will be easy for the reader to be prejudiced since many of
the applications suggested are not orthodox. I suggest that conclusions
be deferred until the new approach has been used to survey the physical
and mental status of the reader's own family, of his brothers and
sisters, of associated families, and finally, of the mass of people met
in business and on the street. Almost everyone who studies the matter
will be surprised that such clear-cut evidence of a decline in modern
reproductive efficiency could be all about us and not have been
previously noted and reviewed.</p>

<p>    It is important to preface the observations by constructing a
mental pattern of physical excellence from the pictures of the various
primitive groups and, with this yardstick or standard of normalcy,
observe our modern patterns. Certain preconceived ideas may have to be
modified, as for example, that based on the belief that what we see is
due to heredity or that deformity is due to mixing of races. If so, why
should the last child in a large family generally suffer most, and
often be different in facial form; or why should there be these changes
in the later children, even in pure racial stocks, after the parents
have adopted our modern types of nutrition? Although the causes of
physical degeneration that can be seen easily have been hard to trace,
the defects in the development of the brain, which affect the mind and
character, are much more obscure, and the causes of mental degeneration
are exceedingly difficult to trace. Much that formerly has been left to
the psychiatrist to explain is now rapidly shifting to the realm of the
anatomist and physiologist.</p>

<p>    Those contributions of the past cultures which have blended
agreeably into our modern experience have been accepted with too little
questioning. Much ancient wisdom, however, has been rejected because of
prejudice against the wisdom of so-called savages. Some readers may
experience this reaction to the primitive wisdom recorded in these
chapters.</p>

<p>    The writer is fully aware that his message is not orthodox; but
since our orthodox theories have not saved us we may have to readjust
them to bring them into harmony with Nature's laws. Nature must be
obeyed, not orthodoxy. Apparently many primitive races have understood
her language better than have our modernized groups. Even the primitive
races share our blights when they adopt our conception of nutrition.
The supporting evidence for this statement is voluminous and as much of
it as space permits is included in this volume. The illustrative
material used is taken from the many thousands of my negatives which
are available. Photographs alone can tell much of the story, and one
illustration is said to be worth as much as one thousand words.</p>

<p>    Since the problem of applying the wisdom of the primitives to
our modern needs concerns not only health workers and nutritionists,
but also educators and social workers, the data are presented without
technical details.</p>

<p>    While many of the primitive races studied have continued to
thrive on the same soil through thousands of years, our American human
stock has declined rapidly within a few centuries, and in some
localities within a few decades. In the regions in which degeneration
has taken place the animal stock has also declined. A decadent
individual cannot regenerate himself, although he can reduce the
progressive decadence in the next generation, or can vastly improve
that generation, by using the demonstrated wisdom of the primitive
races. No era in the long journey of mankind reveals in the skeletal
remains such a terrible degeneration of teeth and bones as this brief
modern period records. Must Nature reject our vaunted culture and call
back the more obedient primitives? The alternative seems to be a
complete readjustment in accordance with the controlling forces of
Nature.</p>

<p>    Thinking is as biologic as is digestion, and brain embryonic
defects are as biologic as are club feet. Since both are readily
produced by lowered parental reproductive capacity, and since Nature in
her large-scale human demonstration reveals that this is chiefly the
result of inadequate nutrition of the parents and too frequent or too
prolonged child bearing, the way back is indicated. Like the successful
primitive racial stocks, we, too, can make, as a first requisite,
provision for adequate nutrition both for generation and growth, and
can make provision for the regulation of the overloads. We, like the
successful primitives, can establish programs of instruction for
growing youth and acquaint it with Nature s requirements long before
the emergencies and stresses arise. This may require a large-scale
program of home and classroom instruction, particularly for the high
school girls and boys. This would be in accordance with the practice of
many of the primitive races reported upon in the following
chapters.</p>

<p>    If the individuals in our modern society who are sufficiently
defective to require some supervision are in part or largely the
product of an injured parentage, who should be held responsible? Is it
just for society to consign these unsocial individuals which it has
made to a life of hard labor or confinement in depressing environments?
Is it just for society to permit production of physical and mental
cripples? Many primitive races apparently have prevented the
distortions which find expressions in unsocial acts. If so, cannot
modern society do this by studying and adopting the programs developed
through centuries of experience by the primitives? Nature uses a
written language which, without the keys, is made up of meaningless
hieroglyphics, but which, with the proper keys, becomes a clear story
of racial and individual history. The hieroglyphics indicate racial and
individual disaster for modernized groups who heed not the warning
story. The primitive races have some of these keys and have used them
successfully in avoiding many of the disasters of our modern society.
The following chapters record many of the excellent practices of the
primitives and they are presented here with the hope that they will be
helpful in a program designed to relieve mankind of some of the
misfortunes common in the present social order and to prevent disorders
for future generations of civilized peoples.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">THE PROGRESSIVE DECLINE OF MODERN
CIVILIZATION</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">T</font>HAT modern man is declining in physical
fitness has been emphasized by many eminent sociologists and other
scientists. That the rate of degeneration is progressively accelerating
constitutes a cause for great alarm, particularly since this is taking
place in spite of the advance that is being made in modern science
along many lines of investigation.</p>

<p>   Dr. Alexis Carrel in his treatise "Man, the Unknown" states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>    <font size="-1">Medicine is far from having decreased human
sufferings as much as it endeavors to make us believe. Indeed, the
number of deaths from infectious diseases has greatly diminished. But
we still must die in a much larger proportion from degenerative
diseases.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After reviewing the reduction in the epidemic infectious diseases he
continues as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    All diseases of bacterial origin have decreased
in a striking manner. . . . Nevertheless, in spite of the triumphs of
medical science, the problem of disease is far from solved. Modern man
is delicate. Eleven hundred thousand persons have to attend the medical
needs of 120,000,000 other persons. Every year, among this population
of the United States, there are about 100,000,000 illnesses, serious or
slight. In the hospitals, 700,000 beds are occupied every day of the
year. . . . Medical care, under all its forms, costs about
$3,500,000,000 yearly. . . . The organism seems to have become more
susceptible to degenerative diseases.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>   The present health condition in the United States is reported
from time to time by several agencies representing special phases of
the health program. The general health problem has been thoroughly
surveyed and interpreted by the Surgeon General of the United States
Public Health Service, Dr. Parran. Probably no one is so well informed
in all of the phases of health as is the head of this important
department of the government. In his recent preliminary report <font
size="-2">(1)</font> to state and local officers for their information
and guidance, he presented data that have been gathered by a large
group of government workers. The report includes a census of the health
conditions of all the groups constituting the population of the United
States--records of the health status and of the economic status of
2,660,000 individuals living in various sections, in various types of
communities, on various economic levels. The data include records on
every age-group. He makes the following interpretations based upon the
assumption that the 2,660,000 offer a fair sampling of the population,
and he indicates the conclusions which may be drawn regarding
conditions of status for the total population of some 130,000,000
people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Every day one out of twenty people is too sick
to go to school or work, or attend his customary activities.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Every man, woman and child (on the average) in
the nation suffers ten days of incapacity annually.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    The average youngster is sick in bed seven days
of the year, the average oldster 35 days.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Two million five hundred thousand people (42 per
cent of the 6,000,000 sick every day) suffer from chronic
diseases-heart disease, hardening of the arteries, rheumatism, and
nervous diseases.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Sixty-five thousand people are totally deaf;
75,000 more are deaf and dumb; 200,000 lack a hand, arm, foot or leg;
300,000 have permanent spinal injuries; 500,000 are blind; 1,000,000
more are permanent cripples.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Two persons on the Relief income level (less
than $1,000 yearly income for the entire family) are disabled for one
week or longer for every one person better off economically.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Only one in 250 family heads in the income group
of more than $2,000 yearly cannot seek work because of chronic
disability. In Relief families one in every 20 family heads is
disabled.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Relief and low-income families are sick longer
as well as more often than better-financed families. They call doctors
less often. But the poor, especially in big cities, get to stay in
hospitals longer than their better-off neighbors.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Concluded Dr. Parran:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    It is apparent that inadequate diet, poor
housing, the hazards of occupation and the instability of the labor
market definitely create immediate health problems.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    It will be seen from this report that the group expressed as
oldsters, who spend on an average thirty-five days per year in bed, are
sick in bed one-tenth of the time. Those of us who are well, who may
have been so fortunate as to spend very little time in bed, will
contemplate this fact with considerable concern since it expresses a
vast amount of suffering and enforced idleness. It is clear that so
great an incidence of morbidity must place a heavy load upon those who
at the time are well. The problem of the progressive increase in
percentage of individuals affected with heart disease and cancer is
adequate cause for alarm. Statistics have been published by the
Department of Public Health in New York City which show the increase in
the incidence of heart disease to have progressed steadily during the
years from 1907 to 1936. The figures provided in their report reveal an
increase from 203.7 deaths per 100,000 in 1907 to 327.2 per 100,000 in
1936. This constitutes an increase of 60 per cent. Cancer increased 90
per cent from 1907 to 1936.</p>

<p>    That this problem of serious degeneration of our modern
civilization is not limited to the people of the United States has been
commented on at length by workers in many countries. Sir Arbuthnot
Lane, one of England's distinguished surgeons, and a student of public
welfare, has made this comment: <font size="-2">(2)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   Long surgical experience has proved to me
conclusively that there is something radically and fundamentally wrong
with the civilized mode of life, and I believe that unless the present
dietetic and health customs of the White Nations are reorganized,
social decay and race deterioration are inevitable.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    The decline in white population that is taking place in many
communities throughout several countries illustrates the widespread
working of the forces that are responsible for this degeneration. In
discussing this matter in its relation to Australia, S. R. Wolstenhole,
<font size="-2">(3)</font> lecturer in economics at Sydney University,
predicts that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    A decline in Australia's population is
inevitable within 40 years because of the absence of a vigorous
population policy.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Students of our modern social problems are recognizing that
these problems are not limited to health conditions which we have been
accustomed to think of as bodily diseases. This is illustrated in a
recent discussion by Will Durant: <font size="-2">(4)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   The American people are face to face with at
least 4 major and militant problems that have to do with the continuity
and worthwhile progress of modern civilization:</font></p>

<ol>
<li><font size="-1">The threatened deterioration of our
stock.</font></li>

<li><font size="-1">The purchasing power of our people must rise as
fast as the power to procure. . . .</font></li>

<li><font size="-1">The third problem is moral. A civilization depends
upon morals for a social and governmental order. . . .</font></li>

<li><font size="-1">The sources of statesmanship are drying up.
.</font> . .</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>    Dental caries or tooth decay is recognized as affecting more
individuals throughout the so-called civilized world today than any
other affection. In the United States, England and Europe examinations
of highly modernized groups, consisting of several million individuals,
reveal the fact that from 85 to 100 per cent of the individuals in
various communities are suffering from this affection. As a
contributing factor to absence from school among children it leads all
other affections. From the standpoint of injury to health, it has been
estimated by many to be the most serious contributing factor through
its involvement of other organs of the body. The Honorable J. A. Young,
Minister of Health of New Zealand, strongly emphasized that the
insidiousness of the effect of dental disease lies in the fact that it
is the forerunner of other far-reaching disturbances and he has
referred to the seriousness with which it is viewed in England as
follows: "Sir George Newman, Principal Medical Officer of the Ministry
of Health in Great Britain, has said that 'dental disease is one of the
chief, if not the chief, cause of the ill health of the people.'"</p>

<p>   Dr. Earnest A. Hooton, of Harvard University, has emphasized the
importance of oral sepsis and the task of stopping tooth decay. In
closing Chapter VII of his recent book "Apes, Men and Morons," <font
size="-2">(5)</font> he states the case as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    I firmly believe that the health of humanity is
at stake, and that, unless steps are taken to discover preventives of
tooth infection and correctives of dental deformation, the course of
human evolution will lead downward to extinction. . . . The facts that
we must face are, in brief, that human teeth and the human mouth have
become, possibly under the influence of civilization, the foci of
infections that undermine the entire bodily health of the species and
that degenerative tendencies in evolution have manifested themselves in
modern man to such an extent that our jaws are too small for the teeth
which they are supposed to accommodate, and that, as a consequence,
these teeth erupt so irregularly that their fundamental efficiency is
often entirely or nearly destroyed.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In discussing the strategic situation of dental science, Dr. Hooton
states.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    In my opinion there is one and only one course
of action which will check the increase of dental disease and
degeneration which may ultimately cause the extinction of the human
species. This is to elevate the dental profession to a plane on which
it can command the services of our best research minds to study the
causes and seek for the cures of these dental evils. . . . The dental
practitioner should equip himself to become the agent of an intelligent
control of human evolution, insofar as it is affected by diet. Let us
go to the ignorant savage, consider his way of eating, and be wise. Let
us cease pretending that tooth-brushes and tooth-paste are any more
important than shoe-brushes and shoe-polish. It is store food which has
given us store teeth.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Students of history have continually commented upon the superior
teeth of the so-called savages including the human types that have
preceded our modernized groups. While dental caries has been found
occasionally in several animal species through the recent geologic
ages, the teeth of the human species have been comparatively free from
dental caries. Primitive human beings have been freer from the disease
than has contemporary animal life. This absence of tooth decay among
primitive races has been so striking a characteristic of human kind
that many commentators have referred to it as a strikingly modern
disease.</p>

<p>    Dryer, <font size="-2">(6)</font> in discussing dental caries in
the pre-historic South Africans, makes this comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    In not one of a very large collection of teeth
from skulls obtained in the Matjes River Shelter (Holocene) was there
the slightest sign of dental caries. The indication from this area,
therefore, bears out the experience of European anthropologists that
caries is a comparatively modern disease and that no skull showing this
condition can be regarded as ancient.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    In connection with the studies reported in this volume, it is of
particular importance that a desire to find the cause of dental caries
was the primary reason for undertaking these investigations. Since it
was exceedingly difficult to find in our modern social organization any
large group with relatively high immunity to dental caries, a search
was made for such control groups among remnants of primitive racial
stocks that could also be examined at the point of contact with modern
civilization in order that the changes associated with their racial
loss of immunity might be noted. Probably few problems with which our
modern social groups are concerned have been so inadequately understood
not only by the laity, but by the members of the medical and dental
professions as has this problem of the cause of dental caries.</p>

<p>    The problem of correcting dental arch deformities and thereby
improving facial form has developed a specialty in dentistry known as
"orthodontia." The literature dealing with the cause of facial
deformities is now voluminous. The blending of racial stocks that
differ radically in facial form has been said by many to be the chief
factor contributing to the creation of deformities of the face. Crowded
teeth have been said to be due to the inheritance of the large teeth of
one parent and the small bone formation of the other and that such
inheritances would provide dental arches that are too small for the
teeth that have been made for them. A more general explanation for
certain types of deformity, particularly for the protruding of the
upper teeth over the lower, is that they result from thumb sucking,
which tends to bring the upper arch forward and to depress the lower.
Among the other contributing factors named have been faulty sleeping
and breathing habits. To these has been assigned much of the blame.
This problem of facial form, as well as that of bodily design,
including dental arch design, is so directly a problem of growth, not
only of individuals, but of races themselves, that certain laws have
been very definitely worked out by physical anthropologists as laws of
development. They have assumed that changes in physical type can occur
only through the impact of changes in the environment which have
affected a great number of generations. It is important to keep this
viewpoint in mind as the succeeding chapters are read, for they contain
descriptions of many changes in physical form that have occurred
routinely in the various racial groups, even during the first
generation after the parents have adopted the foods of modern
civilization.</p>

<p>    Many of our modern writers have recognized and have emphasized
the seriousness of mental and moral degeneration. Laird has made a
splendid contribution under the title "The Tail That Wags the Nation,"
<font size="-2">(7)</font> in which he states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    The country's average level of general ability
sinks lower with each generation. Should the ballot be restricted to
citizens able to take care of themselves? One out of four cannot. . . .
The tail is now wagging Washington, and Wall St. and LaSalle Street. .
. . Each generation has seen some lowering of the American average
level of general ability.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    In Laird's analysis of our present situation he has stressed a
very important phase. While emphasizing that the degeneration is not
limited to restricted areas, he raises the question as to whether local
conditions in certain areas play important roles in the rate and extent
to which degeneration has taken place. He says further, <font size=
"-2">(7)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   Although we might cite any one of nearly two
dozen states, we will first mention Vermont by name because that is the
place studied by the late Dr. Pearce Bailey. "It would be," he wrote,
"safe to assume that there are at least 30 defectives per 1000 in
Vermont of the eight-year-old mentality type, and 300 per 1000 of
backward or retarded persons, persons of distinctly inferior
intelligence. In other words, nearly one-third of the whole population
of that state is of a type to require some supervision."</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>   The problem of lowered mentality and its place in our modern
conception of bodily diseases has not been placed on a physical basis
as have the better understood degenerative processes, with their direct
relationship to a diseased organ, but has generally been assigned to a
realm entirely outside the domain of disease or injury of a special
organ or tissue. Edward Lee Thorndike, <font size="-2">(8)</font> of
Columbia University, says that "thinking is as biological as
digestion." This implies that a disturbance in the capacity to think is
directly related to a defect in the brain.</p>

<p>    Another of the distinguished students of mental capacity, J. B.
Miner, <font size="-2">(9)</font> states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   If morality and intellect are finally
demonstrated to be correlated throughout the whole range of individual
differences, it is probably the most profoundly significant fact with
which society has to deal.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    The origin of backwardness in a child seems to have been
assigned very largely to some experience in that child's life which
becomes a conditioning factor and which thereafter strongly influences
his behavior. The problem of the relation of physical defects to
delinquency in its various phases, including major crime, constitutes
one of the most alarming aspects of our modern problems in social
degeneration. Chassell <font size="-2">(10)</font> has made an
exhaustive study of the reports from workers in different fields in
several countries and summarizes her finding as follows: "The
correlation between delinquency and mental inferiority as found in the
case of feeble-minded groups is clearly positive, and tends to be
marked in degree."</p>

<p>   Burt, <font size="-2">(11)</font> who had made an extensive
study, over an extended period, of the problems of the backward child
and the delinquent child in London, states in his summary and
conclusion with regard to the origin of backwardness in the child:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Both at London and at Birmingham between 60 and
70 per cent belong to the (innately) "dull" category. . . . In the
majority the outstanding cause is a general inferiority of intellectual
capacity, presumably inborn and frequently hereditary.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In discussing the relationship between general physical weakness and
the mentally backward, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Old and time-honoured as it must seem to the
schoolmaster, the problem of the backward child has never been attacked
by systematic research until quite recently. We know little about
causes, and still less about treatment. . . . Thirdly, though the vast
majority of backward children--80 per cent in an area like
London--prove to be suffering from minor bodily ailments or from
continued ill-health, nevertheless general physical weakness is rarely
the main factor.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among the many surveys made in the study of the forces that are
responsible for producing delinquency and criminality, practically all
the workers in this field have testified to the obscure nature of those
forces. Burt <font size="-2">(12)</font> says that, "it is almost as
though crime were some contagious disease, to which the
constitutionally susceptible were suddenly exposed at puberty, or to
which puberty left them peculiarly prone." He emphasizes a relationship
between delinquency and physical deficiency:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Most repeated offenders are far from robust;
they are frail, sickly, and infirm. Indeed, so regularly is chronic
moral disorder associated with chronic physical disorder that many have
contended that crime is a disease, or at least a symptom of disease,
needing the doctor more than the magistrate, physic rather than the
whip.</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font size=
"-1">.     .      .      .      .      .      .</font></b></p>

<p><font size="-1">    The frequency among juvenile delinquents of
bodily weakness and ill health has been remarked by almost every recent
writer. In my own series of cases nearly 70 per cent were suffering
from such defects; and nearly 50 per cent were in urgent need of
medical treatment. . . . Of all the psychological causes of crime, the
commonest and the gravest is usually alleged to be defective mind. The
most eminent authorities, employing the most elaborate methods of
scientific analysis, have been led to enunciate some such belief. In
England, for example, Dr. Goring has affirmed that "the one vital
mental constitutional factor in the etiology of crime is defective
intelligence." In Chicago, Dr. Healy has likewise maintained that among
the personal characteristics of the offender "mental deficiency forms
the largest single cause of delinquency." And most American
investigators would agree.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    The assertion of the obscurity of the fundamental causative
factors of delinquency constitutes one of the most striking aspects of
the extensive literature that has been accumulated through the
reporting of intensive studies made by workers in many countries.</p>

<p>    Thrasher, <font size="-2">(13)</font> in discussing the nature
and origin of gangs, expresses this very clearly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Gangs are gangs, wherever they are found. They
represent a specific type or variety of society, and one thing that is
particularly interesting about them is the fact that they are, in
respect to their organization, so elementary, and in respect to their
origin, so spontaneous.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Formal society is always more or less conscious
of the end for which it exists, and the organization through which this
end is achieved is always more or less a product of design. But gangs
grow like weeds, without consciousness of their aims, and without
administrative machinery to achieve them. They are, in fact, so
spontaneous in their origin, and so little conscious of the purposes
for which they exist, that one is tempted to think of them as
predetermined, foreordained, and "instinctive," and so, quite
independent of the environment in which they ordinarily are
found.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    No doubt, many cities have been provided, as has Cleveland, with
a special school for delinquent boys. The institution there has been
given the appropriate title, the "Thomas A. Edison School." It usually
has an enrollment of 800 to 900 boys. Dr. Watson, <font size=
"-2">(14)</font> who has been of outstanding service in the
organization of this work, makes an important comment on the origin of
the student population there:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   The Thomas A. Edison student population consists
of a group of truant and behavior boys, most of them in those earlier
stages of mal-adjustment which we have termed predelinquency. . . . In
general, they are the products of unhappy experiences in school, home
and community. They are sensitive recorders of the total complex of
social forces which operate in and combine to constitute what we term
their community environment.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    It will be seen from these quotations that great emphasis has
been placed upon the influence of the environment in determining
factors of delinquency.</p>

<p>    Hooton, the distinguished physical anthropologist of Harvard,
has made important observations regarding our modern physical
degeneration. As an approach to this larger problem of man's
progressive degeneration, he has proposed the organization and
establishment of an Institute of Clinical Anthropology, <font size=
"-2">(15)</font> the purpose of which he has indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">. . . for finding out what man is like biologically
when he does not need a doctor, in order to further ascertain what he
should be like after the doctor has finished with him. I am entirely
serious when I suggest that it is a very myopic medical science which
works backward from the morgue rather than forward from the
cradle.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Very important contributions have been made to the forces that
are at work in the development of delinquents through an examination of
the families in which affected individuals have appeared. Sullenger,
<font size="-2">(16)</font> in discussing this phase, states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Abbott and Breckinridge found in their Chicago
studies that a much higher percentage of delinquent boys than girls
were from large families. However, Healy and Bronner found in their
studies in Chicago and Boston that the large family is conducive to
delinquency among children in that the larger the family the greater
percentage of cases with more than one delinquent. They were unable to
detect whether or not this fact was due to parental neglect, poverty,
bad environmental conditions, or the influence of one child on another.
In each of the series in both cities the number of delinquents in
families of different sizes showed general similarity.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    As the investigations outlined in this study are reviewed, many
problems not anticipated by the writer when these investigations were
undertaken will be presented. These new problems were not, at first,
generally thought of as related directly or indirectly to our modern
racial degeneration, but have been found recently to be so related.</p>

<p>    Since it will be seen that the size and shape of the head and
sinuses, including the oral cavity and throat, are directly influenced
by forces that are at work in our modern civilization, we shall
consider the speaking and singing voice. In traveling among several of
the primitive races, one is frequently impressed with the range and
resonance of many of the voices--in fact, by almost every voice. We are
quite familiar with the high premium that is placed on singing voices
of exceptional quality in our modern social order. This is illustrated
by the following comment: <font size="-2">(17)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   Tip-top Italian-style tenors have always been a
scarce commodity, and for the past two decades they have been growing
scarcer and scarcer. Opera impresarios count on the fingers of one hand
the lust-high-voice Latins. . . . Since the death of Enrico Caruso
(1921) opera houses have shown a steady decline.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Important light will be thrown on this phase of the problem--the
cause of fewer good voices in Italy today than of old--as we note the
narrowing of the face and of the dental arches and as we see the change
in the form of the palate of the various primitive races. These changes
occur even in the first generation after the parents have adopted the
foods of modern white civilizations.</p>

<p>    As we study the primitives we will find that they have had an
entirely different conception of the nature and origin of the
controlling forces which have molded individuals and races.</p>

<p>    Buckle, <font size="-2">(18)</font> in writing his epoch-making
"History of Civilization" about the middle of the last century, summed
up his years of historical studies with some very important
conclusions, some of which are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    2. It is proved by history, and especially by
statistics, that human actions are governed by laws as fixed and
regular as those which rule in the physical world.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    3. Climate, soil, food, and the aspects of
Nature are the principal causes of intellectual progress.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    6. Religion, literature, and government are, at
best, but the products, and not the cause of civilization.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    This important view was not orthodox and was met by very severe
criticism. The newer knowledge strongly corroborates his view.</p>

<p>    My early studies of the relation of nutrition to dental problems
were related chiefly to growth defects in the teeth produced long
before the eruption of the permanent teeth, chiefly from one year of
age to the time of eruption. These often appeared as lines across the
teeth. I was able to trace these lines directly to the use of a few
highly processed baby foods. I published an extensive report on this
phase of the problem, together with illustrations, in 1913. <font size=
"-2">(19)</font> These injuries are disclosed with the x-ray long
before the teeth erupt. These disturbances occur much less frequently
in connection with the baby foods used today.</p>

<p>    The problems of modern degeneration can in general be divided
into two main groups, those which relate to the perfection of the
physical body and those which relate to its function. The latter
include character as expressed in behavior of individuals and of groups
of individuals which thus relate to national character and to an entire
culture.</p>

<p>    In an enumeration of the phases in which there is a progressive
decline of modern civilization, it is essential that we keep in mind
that in addition to an analysis of the forces responsible for
individual degeneration, the ethical standards of the whole group
cannot be higher than those of the individuals that compose it. That
recent mass degeneration is in progress is attested by daily events
throughout the world. The current interpretation for individual
character degeneration largely places the responsibility on a
conditioning factor which exerts an influence during early childhood
and therefore is directly related to the environment of the child.
These, therefore, are postnatal conditioning factors. An important
contribution to this phase comes directly from the experience of
primitive races and indicates that a more fundamental conditioning
factor had developed in the prenatal period. If, therefore, large
groups of individuals suffer from such a prenatal conditioning
influence, new light will be thrown upon the larger problems of group
deterioration. History seems to provide records of such mass
degeneration as, for example, those which culminated in the so-called
"dark ages." That some such mass degeneration is now in progress is
suggested by leading students of human welfare. The regius professor of
Greek at Oxford in his inaugural lecture in 1937 made the following
observation: <font size="-2">(20)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   In the revolution of thought through which we are
living, the profoundest and most disturbing element is the breakdown of
that ethical system which, since the days of Constantine, has imposed
upon European culture at least the semblance of moral unity.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In commenting on this important statement Sir Alfred Zimmern in his
address on the decline of international standards said that "Recent
events should convince the dullest mind of the extent to which
international standards have deteriorated and the anarchy which
threatens the repudiation of law and order in favour of brute
force."</p>

<p>   The problem of progressive decline in individual and group
ethical standards is commanding the attention of great international
organizations. In discussing this problem before the International
Rotary at its meeting in San Francisco in June, 1938, one of the
leaders in mass reform, Mayor Harold Burton of Cleveland, stressed very
important phases. He stated that the American boys "are making
irrevocable choices" between good and bad citizenship which "may make
or wreck the nation. It may be on the battlefield of crime prevention
that the life of democracy will be saved." He described great
industrial cities as battlefields where "the tests of democracy are the
newest and sharpest." <font size="-2">(21)</font> . . . "For
centuries," he said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">. . . we have fought crime primarily by seeking to
catch the criminal after the crime has been committed and then through
his punishment to lead or drive him and others to good citizenship.
Today the greater range of operation and greater number of criminals
argue that we must deal with the flood waters of crime. We must prevent
the flood by study, control and diversion of the waters at their
respective sources. To do this we must direct the streams of growing
boys in each community away from fields of crime to those of good
citizenship.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    If the "flood waters" that must be controlled lie farther back
than the cradle, in order to safeguard individual character and
individual citizenship from prenatal conditioning factors which have
profound influence in determining the reaction of the individuals to
the environment, it is essential that programs that are to be efficient
in maintaining national character reach back to those forces which are
causing the degeneration of increasing numbers of the population in
succeeding generations of our modern cultures.</p>

<p>    That the problem of mass degeneration constitutes one of the
most alarming problems of our modernized cultures is demonstrated by
the urgency of appeals that are being made by students in national and
international affairs. The discussion of "An Ethical Declaration for
the Times," <font size="-2">(22)</font> a declaration of faith, is
accompanied by a pledge. This pledge reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    I pledge myself to use every opportunity for
action to uphold the great tradition of civilization to protect all
those who may suffer for its sake, and to pass it on to the coming
generations. I recognized no loyalty greater than that to the task of
preserving truth, toleration, and justice in the coming world
order.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author emphasizes the great danger of taking for granted that
the cultural progress that has been attained will continue. There is
probably no phase of this whole problem of modern degeneration that is
so brilliantly illuminated by the accumulated wisdom of primitive races
as group degeneration. They have so organized the life of the family
and the individual that the nature of the forces which established
individual behavior and character are controlled.</p>

<p>    Our problem of modern degeneration involves both individual and
group destiny. Our approach to this study will, accordingly, involve
first a critical examination of the forces that are responsible for
individual degeneration.</p>

<p>   In my search for the cause of degeneration of the human face and
the dental organs I have been unable to find an approach to the problem
through the study of affected individuals and diseased tissues. In my
two volume work on "Dental Infections," Volume I, entitled "Dental
Infections, Oral and Systemic," and Volume II, entitled "Dental
Infections and the Degenerative Diseases," <font size="-2">(23)</font>
I reviewed at length the researches that I had conducted to throw light
on this problem. The evidence seemed to indicate clearly that the
forces that were at work were not to be found in the diseased tissues,
but that the undesirable conditions were the result of the absence of
something, rather than of the presence of something. This strongly
indicated the need for finding groups of individuals so physically
perfect that they could be used as controls. In order to discover them,
I determined to search out primitive racial stocks that were free from
the degenerative processes with which we are concerned in order to note
what they have that we do not have. These field investigations have
taken me to many parts of the world through a series of years. The
following chapters review the studies made of primitive groups, first,
when still protected by their isolation, and, second, when in contact
with modern civilization.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED
SWISS</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">I</font>N ORDER to study the possibility of greater
nutritive value in foods produced at a high elevation, as indicated by
a lowered incidence of morbidity, including tooth decay, I went to
Switzerland and made studies in two successive years, 1931 and 1932. It
was my desire to find, if possible, groups of Swiss living in a
physical environment such that their isolation would compel them to
live largely on locally produced foods. Officials of the Swiss
Government were consulted as to the possibility of finding people in
Switzerland whose physical isolation provided an adequate protection.
We were told that the physical conditions that would not permit people
to obtain modern foods would prevent us from reaching them without
hardship. However, owing to the completion of the Loetschberg Tunnel,
eleven miles long, and the building of a railroad that crosses the
Loetschental Valley, at a little less than a mile above sea level, a
group of about 2,000 people had been made easily accessible for study,
shortly prior to 1931. Practically all the human requirements of the
people in that valley, except a few items like sea salt, have been
produced in the valley for centuries.</p>

<p>    A bird's eye view of the Loetschental Valley, looking toward the
entrance, is shown in Fig. 1. The people of this valley have a history
covering more than a dozen centuries. The architecture of their wooden
buildings, some of them several centuries old, indicates a love for
simple stability, adapted to expediency and efficiency. Artistically
designed mottoes, many of them centuries old, are carved deep in the
heavy supporting timbers, both within and without the buildings. They
are always expressive of devotion to cultural and spiritual values
rather than to material values. These people have never been conquered,
although many efforts have been made to invade their valley. Except for
the rugged cleft through which the river descends to the Rhone Valley,
the Loetschental Valley is almost completely enclosed by three high
mountain ranges which are usually snow-capped. This pass could be
guarded by a small band against any attacking forces since artificial
landslides could easily be released. The natural occurrence of these
landslides has made passage through the gorge hazardous, if not
impossible, for months of the year. According to early legends of the
valley these mountains were the parapets of the universe, and the great
glacier of the valley, the end of the universe. The glacier is a branch
of the great ice field that stretches away to the west and south from
the ice-cap of the Jungfrau and Monch. The mountains, however, are
seldom approached from this direction because of the hazardous ice
fields. The gateway to them with which the traveling world is familiar
is from Interlaken by way of the Lauterbrunnen or Grindelwald
valleys.</p>

<table summary="" width="375" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding=

<caption align="BOTTOM"><font size="-1">Fig. 1. Beautiful Loetschental

<p>    At the altitude of the Loetschental Valley the winters are long,
and the summers short but beautiful, and accompanied by extraordinarily
rapid and luxuriant growth. The meadows are fragrant with Alpine
flowers, with violets like pansies, which bloom all summer in deepest
hues.</p>

<p>    The people of the Loetschental Valley make up a community of two
thousand who have been a world unto themselves. They have neither
physician nor dentist because they have so little need for them; they
have neither policeman nor jail, because they have no need for them.
The clothing has been the substantial homespuns made from the wool of
their sheep. The valley has produced not only everything that is needed
for clothing, but practically everything that is needed for food. It
has been the achievement of the valley to build some of the finest
physiques in all Europe. This is attested to by the fact that many of
the famous Swiss guards of the Vatican at Rome, who are the admiration
of the world and are the pride of Switzerland, have been selected from
this and other Alpine valleys. It is every Loetschental boy's ambition
to be a Vatican guard. Notwithstanding the fact that tuberculosis is
the most serious disease of Switzerland, according to a statement given
me by a government official, a recent report of inspection of this
valley did not reveal a single case. I was aided in my studies in
Switzerland by the excellent cooperation of the Reverend John Siegen,
the pastor of the one church of this beautiful valley.</p>

<p>    The people live largely in a series of villages dotting the
valley floor along the river bank. The land that is tilled, chiefly for
producing hay for feeding the cattle in the winter and rye for feeding
the people, extends from the river and often rises steeply toward the
mountains which are wooded with timber so precious for protection that
little of it has been disturbed. Fortunately, there is much more on the
vast area of the mountain sides than is needed for the relatively small
population. The forests have been jealously guarded because they are so
greatly needed to prevent slides of snow and rocks which might engulf
and destroy the villages.</p>

<p>    The valley has a fine educational system of alternate didactic
and practical work. All children are required to attend school six
months of the year and to spend the other six months helping with the
farming and dairying industry in which young and old of both sexes must
work. The school system is under the direct supervision of the Catholic
Church, and the work is well done. The girls are also taught weaving,
dyeing and garment making. The manufacture of wool and clothing is the
chief homework for the women in the winter.</p>

<p>    No trucks nor even horses and wagons, let alone tractors, are
available to bear the burdens up and down the mountain sides. This is
all done on human backs for which the hearts of the people have been
made especially strong.</p>

<p>    We are primarily concerned here with the quality of the teeth
and the development of the faces that are associated with such splendid
hearts and unusual physiques. I made studies of both adults and growing
boys and girls, during the summer of 1931, and arranged to have samples
of food, particularly dairy products, sent to me about twice a month,
summer and winter. These products have been tested for their mineral
and vitamin contents, particularly the fat-soluble activators. The
samples were found to be high in vitamins and much higher than the
average samples of commercial dairy products in America and Europe, and
in the lower areas of Switzerland.</p>

<p>   Hay is cut for winter feeding of the cattle, and this hay grows
rapidly. The hay proved, on chemical analysis made at my laboratory, to
be far above the average in quality for pasturage and storage grasses.
Almost every household has goats or cows or both. In the summer the
cattle seek the higher pasturage lands and follow the retreating snow
which leaves the lower valley free for the harvesting of the hay and
rye. The turning of the soil is done by hand, since there are neither
plows nor draft animals to drag the plows, in preparation for the next
year's rye crop. A limited amount of garden stuff is grown, chiefly
green foods for summer use. While the cows spend the warm summer on the
verdant knolls and wooded slopes near the glaciers and fields of
perpetual snow, they have a period of high and rich productivity of
milk. The milk constitutes an important part of the summer's
harvesting. While the men and boys gather in the hay and rye, the women
and children go in large numbers with the cattle to collect the milk
and make and store cheese for the following winter's use. This cheese
contains the natural butter fat and minerals of the splendid milk and
is a virtual storehouse of life for the coming winter.</p>

<p>    From Dr. Siegen, I learned much about the life and customs of
these people. He told me that they recognize the presence of Divinity
in the life-giving qualities of the butter made in June when the cows
have arrived for pasturage near the glaciers. He gathers the people
together to thank the kind Father for the evidence of his Being in the
life-giving qualities of butter and cheese made when the cows eat the
grass near the snow line. This worshipful program includes the lighting
of a wick in a bowl of the first butter made after the cows have
reached the luscious summer pasturage. This wick is permitted to burn
in a special sanctuary built for the purpose. The natives of the valley
are able to recognize the superior quality of their June butter, and,
without knowing exactly why, pay it due homage.</p>

<p>    The nutrition of the people of the Loetschental Valley,
particularly that of the growing boys and girls, consists largely of a
slice of whole rye bread and a piece of the summer-made cheese (about
as large as the slice of bread), which are eaten with fresh milk of
goats or cows. Meat is eaten about once a week. In the light of our
newer knowledge of activating substances, including vitamins, and the
relative values of food for supplying minerals for body building, it is
clear why they have healthy bodies and sound teeth. The average total
fat-soluble activator and mineral intake of calcium and phosphorus of
these children would far exceed that of the daily intake of the average
American child. The sturdiness of the child life permits children to
play and frolic bareheaded and barefooted even in water running down
from the glacier in the late evening's chilly breezes, in weather that
made us wear our overcoats and gloves and button our collars. Of all
the children in the valley still using the primitive diet of whole rye
bread and dairy products the average number of cavities per person was
0.3. On an average it was necessary to examine three persons to find
one defective deciduous or permanent tooth. The children examined were
between seven and sixteen years of age.</p>

<p>    If one is fortunate enough to be in the valley in early August
and witness the earnestness with which the people celebrate their
national holiday, he will be privileged to see a sight long to be
remembered. These celebrations close with the gathering together of the
mountaineers on various crags and prominences where great bonfires are
lighted from fuel that has been accumulated and built into an enormous
mound to make a huge torchlight. These bonfires are lighted at a given
hour from end to end of the valley throughout its expanse. Every
mountaineer on a distant crag seeing the lights knows that the others
are signalling to him that they, too, are making their sacred
consecration in song which says one for all and all for one." This
motive has been crystallized into action and has become a part of the
very souls of the people. One understands why doors do not need to be
bolted in the Loetschental Valley.</p>

<p>    How different the level of life and horizon of such souls from
those in many places in the so-called civilized world in which people
have degraded themselves until life has no interest in values that
cannot be expressed in gold or pelf, which they would obtain even
though the life of the person being cheated or robbed would thereby be
crippled or blotted out.</p>

<p>    One immediately wonders if there is not something in the
life-giving vitamins and minerals of the food that builds not only
great physical structures within which their souls reside, but builds
minds and hearts capable of a higher type of manhood in which the
material values of life are made secondary to individual character. In
succeeding chapters we will see evidence that this is the case.</p>

<p>    Our quest has been for information relative to the health of the
body, the perfection of the teeth, and the normality of development of
faces and dental arches, in order that we might through an analysis of
the foods learn the secret of such splendid body building and learn
from the people of the valley how the nutrition of all groups of people
may be reinforced, so that they, too, may be free from mankind's most
universal disease, tooth decay and its sequelae. These studies included
not only the making of a physical examination of the teeth, the
photographing of subjects, the recording of voluminous data, the
obtaining of samples of food for chemical analysis, the collecting of
detailed information regarding daily menus; but also the collecting of
samples of saliva for chemical analysis. The chemical analysis of
saliva was used to test out my newly developed procedure for estimating
the level of immunity to dental caries for a given person at a given
time. This procedure is outlined in following chapters. The samples of
saliva were preserved by an addition of formalin equivalent in amount
to one per cent of the sample of saliva.</p>

<p>    These children will, it is hoped, be reexamined in succeeding
years in order to make comparative studies of the effect of the changes
in the local nutritional programs. Some of these changes are already in
progress. There is now a modern bakery dispensing white bread and many
white-flour products which was in full operation in 1932.</p>

<p>    I inquired of many persons regarding the most favorable
districts in which to make further studies of groups of people living
in protected isolation because of their physical environment, and
decided to study some special high Alpine valleys between the Rhone
Valley and Italy, which I included in 1932. The Canton of Wallis is
bordered by French-speaking people on the west, by Italian-speaking
people on the south, and by German-speaking people on the east and
north. I had as guides and interpreters in Wallis, Dr. Alfred Gysi and
also Dr. Adolf Roos through part of the territory.</p>

<p>    Our first expedition was into the valley of the Visp which is a
great gorge extending southward from the Rhone River, dividing into two
gorges, one going to the Saas Fee country, and the other to the
vicinity of the Matterhorn with its almost spirelike pinnacle lifting
itself above the surrounding snow-capped mountains and visible from
eminences in all directions as one of the mightiest and most sublime
spectacles in the world. It was one of the last mountains of Europe to
be scaled by man. One has not seen the full majesty of the Alps if he
has not seen the Matterhorn.</p>

<p>    We left the mountain railroad, which makes many of the grades
with the cog system, at the town of St. Nicholas, and climbed the
mountain trail to an isolated settlement on the east bank of the
Mattervisp River, called Grachen, a five-hour journey. The settlement
is on a shelf high above the east side of the river where it is exposed
to southern sunshine and enjoys a unique isolation because of its
physical inaccessibility. An examination made of the children in this
community showed that only 2.3 teeth out of every hundred had been
attacked by tooth decay.</p>

<p>    The hardihood of the people was splendidly illustrated by a
woman of 62 years who carried an enormous load of rye on her back at an
altitude of about 5,000 feet. We met her later and talked to her, and
found that she was extraordinarily well developed and well preserved.
She showed us her grandchildren who had fine physiques and facial
developments.</p>

<p>    The rye is so precious that while being carried the heads are
protected by wrapping them in canvas so that not a kernel will be lost.
The rye is thrashed by hand and ground in stone mills which were
formerly hand-turned like the one shown in Fig. 2. Recently water
turbines have been installed. Water power is abundant and the grinding
is done for the people of the mountain side in these water-driven
mills. Only wholerye flour is available. Each household takes turns in
using the community bake-oven, which is shown in Fig. 2. A month's
supply of whole-rye bread is baked at one time for a given family.</p>

<p>    Here again the cows were away in the midsummer, pasturing up
near the glaciers. Grachen has an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The
church at Grachen was built several hundred years ago. We were shown an
embossed certificate of honor and privilege extended to a group of
about 120 people who had originally built the edifice. We were given
valued assistance by the local priest, and were provided with
facilities in his spacious and well-kept rooms for making our studies
of the children.</p>

<p>    From Grachen we returned to St. Nicholas and proceeded from
there by train down the valley and up another steep ascent, requiring
several hours, to the hamlet of Visperterminen, on the east side of the
mountain above the Visp River, and below the junction of the Mattervisp
and Saaservisp. This community is made up of about 1,600 people living
on a sheltered shelf high above the river valley. The view from this
position is indescribably beautiful. It is a little below the timber
line of this and the surrounding mountains. Majestic snow-clad peaks
and precipitous mountains dot the horizon and shade off into winding
gorges which mark the course of wandering streams several thousand feet
below our vantage point. It is a place to stop and ponder.</p>

<p>    The gradations in climate range in the summer from a tropical
temperature in protected nooks during the daytime to sub-zero weather
with raging blizzards at night on the high mountains. It is a place
where human stamina can be tempered to meet all the vicissitudes of
life.</p>

<p>    The village consists of a group of characteristically designed
Swiss chalets clustered on the mountain side. The church stands out as
a beacon visible from mountains in all directions. Visperterminen is
unique in many respects. Notwithstanding its relative proximity to
civilization--it is only a few hours' journey to the thoroughfare of
the Rhone Valley--it has enjoyed isolation and opportunity for
maintaining its characteristic primitive social and civil life. We were
greeted here by the president of the village who graciously opened the
school house and sent messengers to have the children of the community
promptly come to the school building in order that we might make such
studies as we desired. This study included a physical examination of
the teeth and of the general development of the children, particularly
of the faces and dental arches, the making of photographic records, the
obtaining of samples of saliva, as in other places, and also the making
of a detailed study of the nutrition. In addition, we obtained samples
of foods for chemical analysis.</p>

<p>    The people of Visperterminen have the unique distinction of
owning land in the lower part of the mountain on which they maintain
vineyards to supply wine for this country. They have the highest
vineyards of Europe. They are grown on banks that are often so steep
that one wonders how the tillers of the soil or the gatherers of the
fruit can maintain their hold on the precarious and shifting footing.
Each terrace has a trench near its lower retaining wall to catch the
soil that is washed down, and this soil must be carried back in baskets
to the upper boundary of the plot. This is all done by human labor. The
vineyards afforded them the additional nutrition of wine and of fruit
minerals and vitamins which the two groups we studied at Loetschental
and Grachen did not have.</p>

<p>    This additional nutrition was of importance because of the
opportunity for obtaining through it vitamin C. It is of particular
interest in the study of the incidence of tooth decay in Visperterminen
that these additional factors had not created a higher immunity to
tooth decay, nor a better condition of health in gingival tissues than
previously found. In each one hundred teeth examined 5.2 were found to
have been attacked at some time by tooth decay. Here again the
nutrition consisted of rye, used almost exclusively as the cereal; of
dairy products; of meat about once a week; and also some potatoes.
Limited green foods were eaten during the summer. The general custom is
to have a sheep dressed and distributed to a group of families, thus
providing each family with a ration of meat for one day a week, usually
Sunday. The bones and scraps are utilized for making soups to be served
during the week. The children have goat's milk in the summer when the
cows are away in the higher pastures near the snow line. Certain
members of the families go to the higher pastures with the cows to make
cheese for the coming winter's use.</p>

<p>    The problem of identifying goats or cattle for establishing
individual ownership is a considerable one where the stock of all are
pastured in common herds. It was interesting to us to observe how this
problem was met. The president of the village has what is called a
"tessel" which is a string of manikins in imitation of goats or cattle
made of wood and leather. Every stock owner must provide a manikin to
be left in the safekeeping of the president of the village with whom it
is registered. It carries on it the individual markings that this
member of the colony agrees to put on every member of his animal stock.
The marking may be a hole punched in the left ear or a slit in the
right ear, or any combination of such markings as is desired.
Thereafter all animals carrying that mark are the property of the
person who registered it; similarly, any animals that have not this
individual symbol of identification cannot be claimed by him.</p>

<p>    As one stands in profound admiration before the stalwart
physical development and high moral character of these sturdy
mountaineers, he is impressed by the superior types of manhood,
womanhood, and childhood that Nature has been able to produce from a
suitable diet and a suitable environment. Surely, here is evidence
enough to answer the question whether cereals should be avoided because
they produce acids in the system which if formed will be the cause of
tooth decay and many other ills including the acidity of the blood or
saliva. Surely, the ultimate control will be found in Nature's
laboratory where man has not yet been able to meddle sufficiently with
Nature's nutritional program to blight humanity with abnormal and
synthetic nutrition. When one has watched for days the childlife in
those high Alpine preserves of superior manhood; when one has
contrasted these people with the pinched and sallow, and even deformed,
faces and distorted bodies that are produced by our modern civilization
and its diets; and when one has contrasted the unsurpassed beauty of
the faces of these children developed on Nature's primitive foods with
the varied assortment of modern civilization's children with their
defective facial development, he finds himself filled with an earnest
desire to see that this betterment is made available for modern
civilization.</p>

<p>    Again and again we had the experience of examining a young man
or young woman and finding that at some period of his life tooth decay
had been rampant and had suddenly ceased; but, during the stress, some
teeth had been lost. When we asked such people whether they had gone
out of the mountain and at what age, they generally replied that at
eighteen or twenty years of age they had gone to this or that city and
had stayed a year or two. They stated that they had never had a decayed
tooth before they went or after they returned, but that they had lost
some teeth in the short period away from home.</p>

<p>    At this point of our studies Dr. Roos found it necessary to
leave, but Dr. Gysi accompanied us to the Anniviers Valley, which is
also on the south side of the Rhone. The river of the valley, the
Navizenze, drains from the high Swiss and Italian boundary north to the
Rhone River. Here again we had the remarkable experience of finding
communities near to each other, one blessed with high immunity to tooth
decay, and the other afflicted with rampant tooth decay.</p>

<p>    The village of Ayer lies in a beautiful valley well up toward
the glaciers. It is still largely primitive, although a government road
has recently been developed, which, like many of the new arteries, has
made it possible to dispatch military protection when and if necessary
to any community. In this beautiful hamlet, until recently isolated, we
found a high immunity to dental caries. Only 2.3 teeth out of each
hundred examined were found to have been attacked by tooth decay. Here
again the people were living on rye and dairy products. We wonder if
history will repeat itself in the next few years and if there, too,
this enviable immunity will be lost with the advent of the highway.
Usually it is not long after tunnels and roads are built that
automobiles and wagons enter with modern foods, which begin their
destructive work. This fact has been tragically demonstrated in this
valley since a roadway was extended as far as Vissoie several years
ago. In this village modern foods have been available for some time.
One could probably walk the distance from Ayer to Vissoie in an hour.
The number of teeth found to be attacked with caries for each one
hundred children's teeth examined at Vissoie was 20.2 as compared with
2.3 at Ayer. We had here a splendid opportunity to study the changes
that had occurred in the nutritional programs. With the coming of
transportation and new markets there had been shipped in modern white
flour; equipment for a bakery to make white-flour goods; highly
sweetened fruit, such as jams, marmalades, jellies, sugar and
syrups--all to be traded for the locally produced high-vitamin dairy
products and high-mineral cheese and rye; and with the exchange there
was enough money as premium to permit buying machine-made clothing and
various novelties that would soon be translated into necessities.</p>

<p>    Each valley or village has its own special feast days of which
athletic contests are the principal events. The feasting in the past
has been largely on dairy products. The athletes were provided with
large bowls of cream as constituting one of the most popular and
healthful beverages, and special cheese was always available.
Practically no wine was used because no grapes grew in that valley, and
for centuries the isolation of the people prevented access to much
material that would provide wine. In the Visperterminen community,
however, the special vineyards owned by these people on the lower level
of the mountain side provided grape juice in various stages of
fermentation, and their feasts in the past have been celebrated by the
use of wines of rare vintage as well as by the use of cream and other
dairy products. Their cream products took the place of our modern ice
cream. It was a matter of deep interest to have the President of
Visperterminen show us the tankards that had been in use in that
community for nine or ten centuries. The care of these was one of the
many responsibilities of the chief executive of the hamlet.</p>

<p>    It is reported that practically all skulls that are exhumed in
the Rhone valley, and, indeed, practically throughout all of
Switzerland where graves have existed for more than a hundred years,
show relatively perfect teeth; whereas the teeth of people recently
buried have been riddled with caries or lost through this disease. It
is of interest that each church usually has associated with it a
cemetery in which the graves are kept decorated, often with beautiful
designs of fresh or artificial flowers. Members of succeeding
generations of families are said to be buried one above the other to a
depth of many feet. Then, after a sufficient number of generations have
been so honored, their bodies are exhumed to make a place for present
and coming generations. These skeletons are usually preserved with
honor and deference. The bones are stacked in basements of certain
buildings of the church edifice with the skulls facing outward. These
often constitute a solid wall of considerable extent. In Naters there
is such a group said to contain 20,000 skeletons and skulls. These were
studied with great interest as was also a smaller collection in
connection with the cathedral at Visp. While many of the single
straight-rooted teeth had been lost in the handling, many were present.
It was a matter of importance to find that only a small percentage of
teeth had had caries. Teeth that had been attacked with deep caries had
developed apical abscesses with consequent destruction of the alveolar
processes. Evidence of this bone change was readily visible. Sockets of
missing teeth still had continuous walls, indicating that the teeth had
been vital at death.</p>

<p>    The reader will scarcely believe it possible that such marked
differences in facial form, in the shape of the dental arches, and in
the health condition of the teeth as are to be noted when passing from
the highly modernized lower valleys and plains country in Switzerland
to the isolated high valleys can exist. Fig. 3 shows four girls with
typically broad dental arches and regular arrangement of the teeth.
They have been born and raised in the Loetschental Valley or other
isolated valleys of Switzerland which provide the excellent nutrition
that we have been reviewing. They have been taught little regarding the
use of tooth brushes. Their teeth have typical deposits of unscrubbed
mouths; yet they are almost completely free from dental caries, as are
the other individuals of the group they represent. In a study of 4,280
teeth of the children of these high valleys, only 3.4 per cent were
found to have been attacked by tooth decay. This is in striking
contrast to conditions found in the modernized sections using the
modern foods.</p>

<p>    In Loetschental, Grachen, Visperterminen and Ayer, we have found
communities of native Swiss living almost exclusively on locally
produced foods consisting of the cereal, rye, and the animal product,
milk, in its various forms. At Vissoie, with its available modern
nutrition, there has been a complete change in the level of immunity to
dental caries. It is important that studies be made in other
communities which correspond in altitude with the first four places
studied in which there was a high immunity to dental caries. Modern
foods should be available in the new communities selected for
comparative study. To find such places one would naturally think of
those that are world-famed as health resorts providing the best things
that modern science and industry can assemble. Surely St. Moritz would
be such a place. It is situated in the southeastern part of the
Republic of Switzerland near the headwaters of the Danube in the upper
Engadin. This world-famous watering place attracts people of all
continents for both summer and winter health building and for the
enjoyment of the mountain lakes, snow-capped peaks, forested mountain
sides, and crystal clear atmosphere with abundance of sunshine.</p>

<p>    The journey from the Canton of Wallis (Valais) to the upper
Engadin takes one up the Rhone valley, climbing continually to get
above cascades and beautiful waterfalls until one comes to the great
Rhone glacier which blocks the end of the valley. The water gushes from
beneath the mountain of ice to become the parent stream of the Rhone
river which passes westward through the Rhone valley receiving
tributaries from snow-fed streams from both north and south watersheds,
as it rolls westward to the beautiful Lake Geneva and then onward west
and south to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>    It is of significance that a study of the child life in the
Rhone valley, as made by Swiss officials and reported by Dr. Adolf Roos
and his associates, shows that practically every child had tooth decay
and the majority of the children had decay in an aggravated form.
People of this valley are provided with adequate railroad
transportation for bringing them the luxuries of the world. As we pass
eastward over the pass through Andermatt, we are reminded that the
trains of the St. Gotthard tunnel go thundering through the mountain a
mile below our feet en route to Italy. To reach our goal, the beautiful
modern city and summer resort of St. Moritz, we enter the Engadin
country famed for its beauty and crystal-clear atmosphere. We already
know something of the beauty that awaits us which has attracted
pleasure seekers and beauty lovers of the world to St. Moritz. One
would scarcely expect to see so modern a city as St. Mortiz at an
altitude of a little over a mile, with little else to attract people
than its climate in winter and summer, the magnificent scenery, and the
clear atmosphere. We have passed from the communities where almost
everyone wears homespuns to one of English walking coats and the most
elegant of feminine attire. Everyone shows the effect of contact with
culture. The hotels in their appointments and design are reminiscent of
Atlantic City. Immediately one sees something is different here than in
the primitive localities: the children have not the splendidly
developed features, and the people give no evidence of the great
physical reserve that is present in the smaller communities.</p>

<p>    Through the kindness of Dr. William Barry, a local dentist, and
through that of the superintendent of the public schools, we were
invited to use one of the school buildings for our studies of the
children. The summer classes were dismissed with instructions that the
children be retained so that we could have them for study. Several
factors were immediately apparent. The teeth were shining and clean,
giving eloquent testimony of the thoroughness of the instructions in
the use of the modern dentifrices for efficient oral prophylaxis. The
gums looked better and the teeth more beautiful for having the debris
and deposits removed. Surely this superb climate, this magnificent
setting, combined with the best of the findings of modern prophylactic
science, should provide a 100-per-cent immunity to tooth decay. But in
a study of the children from eight to fifteen years of age, 29.8 per
cent of the teeth had already been attacked by dental caries. Our study
of each case included careful examining of the mouth; photographing of
the face and teeth; obtaining of samples of saliva for chemical
analysis; and a study of the program of nutrition followed by the given
case. In most cases, the diet was strikingly modern, and the only
children found who did not have tooth decay proved to be children who
were eating the natural foods, whole rye bread and plenty of milk.</p>

<p>    In Chapter 15, a detailed discussion of the chemical differences
in the food constituents is presented for both the districts subject to
immunity, and for those subject to susceptibility.</p>

<p>    I was told by a former resident of this upper Engadin country
that in one of the isolated valleys only a few decades ago the children
were still carrying their luncheons to school in the form of roasted
rye carried dry in their pockets. Their ancestors had eaten cereal in
this dry form for centuries.</p>

<p>    St. Moritz is a typical Alpine community with a physical setting
lar to that in the Cantons of Bern and Wallis (Valais). It is, however,
provided with modern nutrition consisting of an abundance of
white-flour products, marmalades, jams, canned vegetables, confections,
and fruits--all of which are transported to the district. Only a
limited supply of vegetables is grown locally. We studied some children
here whose parents retained their primitive methods of food selection,
and without exception those who were immune to dental caries were
eating a distinctly different food from those with high susceptibility
to dental caries.</p>

<p>    Few countries of the world have had officials so untiring in
their efforts to study and tabulate the incidence of dental caries in
various geographic localities as has Switzerland. In the section lying
to the north and east, and near Lake Constance, there is a considerable
district where it is reported that 100 per cent of the people are
suffering from dental caries. In almost all the other parts of
Switzerland in which the population is large 95 to 98 per cent of the
people suffer from dental caries. Of the two remaining districts, in
one there is from 90 to 95 per cent and in the other from 85 to 90 per
cent individual susceptibility to dental caries. Since in the district
in the vicinity of Lake Constance the incidence of dental caries is so
high that it is recorded as 100 per cent, it seemed especially
desirable to make a similar critical study there and to obtain samples
of saliva and detailed information regarding the food, and to make
detailed physical examinations of growing children in this community,
and through the great kindness of Dr. Hans Eggenberger, Director of
Public Health for this general district, we were given an opportunity
to do so.</p>

<p>    Arrangements were made by Dr. Eggenberger so that typical groups
of children, some in institutions, could be studied. He is located at
Herisau in the Canton of St. Gall. We found work well organized for
building up the health of these children in so far as outdoor
treatment, fresh air, and sunshine were concerned. As dental caries is
a major problem, and probably nutritional, it is treated by sunshine.
The boys' group and girls' group are both given suitable athletic
sports under skillfully trained directors. These groups are located in
different parts of the city. Their recreation grounds are open lawns
adjoining wooded knolls which give the children protection and
isolation in which to play in their sunsuits and build vigorous
appetites, and thus to prepare for their institutional foods which were
largely from a modern menu. Critical dental examinations were made and
an analysis of the data obtained revealed that one-fourth of all teeth
of these growing boys and girls had already been attacked by dental
caries, and that only 4 per cent of the children had escaped from the
ravages of tooth decay, which disease many of them had in an aggravated
form.</p>

<p>    In the Herisau group 25.5 per cent of the 2,065 teeth examined
had been attacked by dental caries and many teeth were abscessed. The
upper photographs in Fig. 4 are of two girls with typically rampant
tooth decay. The one to the left is sixteen years of age and several of
her permanent teeth are decayed to the gum line. Her appearance is
seriously marred, as is also that of the girl to the right.</p>

<p>    Another change that is seen in passing from the isolated groups
with their more nearly normal facial developments, to the groups of the
lower valleys, is the marked irregularity of the teeth with narrowing
of the arches and other facial features. In the lower half of Fig. 4
may be seen two such cases. While in the isolated groups not a single
case of a typical mouth breather was found, many were seen among the
children of the lower-plains group. The children studied were from ten
to sixteen years of age.</p>

<p>    Many individuals in the modernized districts bore on their faces
scars which indicated that the abscess of an infected tooth had broken
through to the external surface where it had developed a fistula with
resultant scar tissue, thus producing permanent deformity.</p>

<p>    Bad as these conditions were, we were told that they were better
than the average for the community. The ravages of dental caries had
been strikingly evident as we came in contact with the local and
traveling public. As we had at St. Moritz, we found an occasional child
with much better teeth than the average. Usually the answer was not far
to seek. For example, in one of the St. Moritz groups, in a class of
sixteen boys, there were 158 cavities, or an average of 9.8 cavities
per person (fillings are counted as cavities). In the cases of three
other children in the same group, there were only three cavities, and
one case was without dental caries. Two of these three had been eating
dark bread or entire-grain bread, and one was eating dark bread and
oatmeal porridge. All three drank milk liberally.</p>

<p>    When looking here for the source of dairy products one is
impressed by the absence of cows at pasture in the plains of
Switzerland, areas in which a large percentage of the entire population
resides. True, one frequently sees large laiteries or creameries, but
the cows are not in sight. On asking the explanation for this, I found
that a larger quantity of milk could be obtained from the cows if they
were kept in the stables during the period of high production. Indeed,
this was a necessity in most of these communities since there were so
few fences, and during the time of the growth of the crops, including
the stock feed for the winter's use, it was necessary that the cows be
kept enclosed. About the only time that cows were allowed out on
pasture was in the fall after the crops had been harvested and while
the stubble was being plowed.</p>

<p>    Among the children in St. Moritz and Herisau, those groups with
the lower number of cavities per person were using milk more or less
liberally. Of the total number of children examined in both places only
11 per cent were using milk in their diets, whereas 100 per cent of the
children in the other districts that provided immunity were using milk.
Nearly every child in St. Moritz was eating white bread. In Herisau,
all but one of the children examined were eating white bread in whole
or in principal part.</p>

<p>    Since so many cattle were stall-fed in the thickly populated
part of Switzerland, and since so low a proportion of the children used
milk even sparingly, I was concerned to know what use was made of the
milk. Numerous road signs announcing the brand of sweetened milk
chocolate made in the several districts suggested one use. This
chocolate is one of the important products for export and as a beverage
constitutes a considerable item in the nutrition of large numbers
living in this and in other countries. It is recognized as a high
source of energy, primarily because of the sugar and chocolate which
when combined with the milk greatly reduces the ratio of the minerals
to the energy factors as expressed in calories.</p>

<p>    It was formerly thought that dental caries which was so rampant
in the greater portion of Switzerland was due in part to low iodine
content in the cattle feed and in other food because of iodine
deficiency in the soil. Large numbers of former generations suffered
from clinical goiter and various forms of thyroid disturbances. That
this is not the cause seems clearly demonstrated by the fact that
dental caries is apparently as extensive today as ever before, if not
more so, while the iodine problem has been met through a reinforcement
of the diet of growing children and others in stress periods with
iodine in suitable form. Indeed the early work done in Cleveland by
Crile, Marine, and Kimball was referred to by the medical authorities
there as being the forerunner of the control of the thyroid disorder in
these communities.</p>

<p>    The officials of the Herisau community were so deeply concerned
regarding the prevalence of dental caries that they were carrying
forward institutional and community programs with the hope of checking
this affliction. If dental caries were primarily the result of an
inadequate amount of vitamin D, then sunning the patients should
provide an adequate reinforcement. This is one of the principal
purposes for getting the growing boys and girls of the community into
sunsuits for tanning their bodies.</p>

<p>    Another procedure to which my attention was called consisted of
adding to the bread a product high in lime, which was being obtained in
the foothills of the district. This and other types of bread were
studied by chemical analyses. Clinically, tooth decay was not
reduced.</p>

<p>    I made an effort to establish a clinic in a neighboring town for
the purpose of demonstrating with a group of children that dental
caries can be controlled by a simple nutritional program. An
interesting incident developed in connection with the selection of the
children for this experimental group. When parents were asked to permit
their children to have one meal a day reinforced, according to a
program that has proved adequate with my clinical groups in Cleveland,
the objection was made that there was no use trying to save the teeth
of the girls. The girls should have all their teeth extracted and
artificial teeth provided before they were married, because if they did
not they would lose them then.</p>

<p>   It is of interest that the southern part of Switzerland including
the high Alpine country is largely granite. The hills in the northern
part of Switzerland are largely limestone in origin. A great number of
people live in the plain between these two geologic formations, a plain
which is largely made of alluvial deposits which have been washed down
from the upper formations. The soil is extraordinarily fertile soil and
has supported a thrifty and healthy population in the past.</p>

<p>    When I asked a government official what the principal diseases
of the community were, he said that the most serious and most universal
was dental caries, and the next most important, tuberculosis; and that
both were largely modern diseases in that country.</p>

<p>    When I visited the famous advocate of heliotherapy, Dr. Rollier,
in his clinic in Leysin, Switzerland, I wondered at the remarkable
results he was obtaining with heliotherapy in nonpulmonary
tuberculosis. I asked him how many patients he had under his general
supervision and he said about thirty-five hundred. I then asked him how
many of them come from the isolated Alpine valleys and he said that
there was not one; but that they were practically all from the Swiss
plains, with some from other countries.</p>

<p>    I inquired of several clinicians in Switzerland what their
observations were with regard to the association of dental caries and
tuberculosis among the people of Switzerland. I noted that the reports
indicated that the two diseases were generally associated. We will find
a corollary to this in many studies in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>    These studies in Switzerland, as briefly presented here, seem to
demonstrate that the isolated groups dependent on locally produced
natural foods have nearly complete natural immunity to dental caries,
and that the substitution of modern dietaries for these primitive
natural foods destroys this immunity whether in ideally located
elevated districts like St. Moritz or in the beautiful and fertile
plains of lower Switzerland. The question seems to answer itself in a
general way, without much laboratory data, from the results of a
critical examination of the foods. The laboratory analyses, however,
identify the particular factors in the foods which are primarily
responsible by their presence for establishing immunity, and by their
absence in inducing susceptibility to dental caries. These chemical
data are discussed in Chapter 15.</p>

<p>    High immunity to dental caries, freedom from deformity of the
dental arches and face, and sturdy physiques with high immunity to
disease were all found associated with physical isolation, and with
forced limitation in selection of foods. This resulted in a very
liberal use of dairy products and whole-rye bread, in connection with
plant foods, and with meat served about once a week.</p>

<p>    The individuals in the modernized districts were found to have
widespread tooth decay. Many had facial and dental arch deformities and
much susceptibility to diseases. These conditions were associated with
the use of refined cereal flours, a high intake of sweets, canned
goods, sweetened fruits, chocolate; and a greatly reduced use of dairy
products.</p>

<p><font size="+3">S</font>TORIES have long been told of the superb
health of the people living in the Islands of the Outer Hebrides. The
smoke oozing through the thatched roofs of their "black houses" has
added weirdness to the description of their home life and strange
environment. These stories have included a description of their
wonderfully fine teeth and their stalwart physiques and strong
characters. They, accordingly, provide an excellent setting for a study
to throw light on the problem of the cause of dental caries and modern
physical degeneration. These Islands lie off the northwest coast of
Scotland, extending to a latitude nearly as far north as the southern
part of Greenland. A typical view of their thatched-roof cottages may
be seen in Fig. 5.</p>

<p>    The Isle of Lewis has a population of about twenty thousand,
made up almost entirely of fisher folk and crofters or sheep raisers.
This island has so little lime in its soil that it is said that there
are no trees in the entire island except a few which have been planted.
The surface of the island is largely covered with peat, varying in
thickness from a few inches to twenty feet. This is the fuel. Peat
contains the rootlets of the plant life which grew many centuries ago.
There is so little bacterial growth that vegetable products undergo
very slow decay. The pasturage of the island is so poor that
exceedingly few cattle are to be found, largely because they do not
properly mature and reproduce. In a few districts some highland cattle
with long shaggy hair and wide spread horns are found. Almost all of
these are imported. The principal herd of cattle on the island consists
of a few dozen head on the government experimental farm.</p>

<p>    The basic foods of these islanders are fish and oat products
with a little barley. Oat grain is the one cereal which develops fairly
readily, and it provides the porridge and oat cakes which in many homes
are eaten in some form regularly with each meal. The fishing about the
Outer Hebrides is specially favorable, and small sea foods, including
lobsters, crabs, oysters and clams, are abundant. An important and
highly relished article of diet has been baked cod's head stuffed with
chopped cod's liver and oatmeal. The principal port of the Isle of
Lewis is Stornoway with a fixed population of about four thousand and a
floating population of seamen over week-ends, of an equal or greater
number. The Sunday we spent there, 450 large fishing boats were said to
be in the port for the week-end. Large quantities of fish are packed
here for foreign markets. These hardy fisherwomen often toil from six
in the morning to ten at night. The abundance of fish makes the cost of
living very low.</p>

<p>    In Fig. 5 may be seen three of these fisher-people with teeth of
unusual perfection. We saw them at the fish-cleaning benches from early
morning till late at night dressed, as you see them pictured, in their
oilskin suits and rubber boots. We met them again in their Sunday
attire taking important parts in the leading church. It would be
difficult to find examples of womanhood combining a higher degree of
physical perfection and more exalted ideals than these weather-hardened
toilers. Theirs is a land of frequent gales, often sleet-ridden or
enshrouded in penetrating cold fogs. Life is full of meaning for
characters that are developed to accept as everyday routine raging seas
and piercing blizzards representing the accumulated fury of the
treacherous north Atlantic. One marvels at their gentleness, refinement
and sweetness of character.</p>

<p>    The people live in these so-called black houses. These are
thatched-roof dwellings containing usually two or three rooms. The
walls are built of stone and dirt, ordinarily about five feet in
thickness. There is usually a fireplace and chimney, one or two outside
doors, and very few windows in the house. The thatch of the roofs plays
a very important r&ocirc;le. It is replaced each October and the old
thatch is believed by the natives to have great value as a special
fertilizer for their soil because of its impregnation with chemicals
that have been obtained from the peat smoke which may be seen seeping
through all parts of the roof at all seasons of the year. Peat fires
are kept burning for this explicit purpose even when the heat is not
needed. This means that enormous quantities of peat are required to
maintain a continuous smudge. Some of the houses have no chimney
because it is desirable that the smoke leave the building through the
thatched roof. Not infrequently smoke is seen rolling out of an open
door or open window. Fortunately the peat is so abundant that it can be
obtained easily from the almost limitless quantities nearby. The sheep
that roam the heather-covered plains are of a small black-faced breed,
exhibiting great hardihood. They provide wool of specially high
quality, which, incidentally, is the source of the famous Harris Tweeds
which are woven in these small black houses chiefly on the Isle of
Harris.</p>

<p>    We are particularly concerned with the people of early Scotch
descent who possess a physique that rivals that found in almost any
place in the world. They are descendants of the original Gaelic stock
which is their language today, and the only one which a large
percentage of them can speak. This island has only one port which means
that most of the shore line still provides primitive living conditions
as does the central part of the island. It was a great surprise, and
indeed a very happy one, to find such high types of manhood and
womanhood as exist among the occupants of these rustic thatched-roof
homes, usually located in an expanse of heather-covered treeless
plains. It would be hard to visualize a more complete isolation for
child life than many of these homes provide, and one marvels at the
refinement, intelligence, and strength of character of these rugged
people. They resent, and I think justly so, the critical and
uncomplimentary references made to their homes in attaching to them the
name "black-houses." Several that we visited were artistically
decorated with clean wallpaper and improvised hangings.</p>

<p>    One would expect that in their one seaport town of Stornoway
things would be gay over the week-end, if not boisterous, with between
four and five thousand fishermen and seamen on shore-leave from
Saturday until midnight Sunday. On Saturday evening the sidewalks were
crowded with happy carefree people, but no boisterousness and no
drinking were to be seen. Sunday the people went in throngs to their
various churches. Before the sailors went aboard their crafts on Sunday
evening they met in bands on the street and on the piers for religious
singing and prayers for safety on their next fishing expedition. One
could not buy a postage stamp, a picture card, or a newspaper, could
not hire a taxi, and could not find a place of amusement open on
Sunday. Everybody has reverence for the Sabbath day on the Isle of
Lewis. Every activity is made subservient to their observance of the
Sabbath day. In few places in the world are moral standards so high.
One wonders if the bleak winds which thrash the north Atlantic from our
Labrador and Greenland coasts have not tempered the souls of these
people and created in them higher levels of nobility and exalted human
expression. These people are the outposts of the western fringe of the
European continent.</p>

<p>    Just as one sees in Brittany, on the west coast of France, the
prehistoric druidical stone forest marking a civilization which existed
so far in the past as to be without historic records except in its
monuments; so, too, we find here the forest of granite slabs in which
these sturdy prehistoric souls worshipped their divinities before they
were crowded into the sea by the westward moving hordes. When one
realizes the distance that these heavy stones had to be transported, a
distance of probably twenty miles over difficult terrain, we can
appreciate the task. Their size can be calculated from the depth to
which they must be buried in order to stand erect even to this day.</p>

<p>   We are concerned primarily with the physical development of the
people, and particularly with their freedom from dental caries or tooth
decay. One has only to see them carrying their burdens of peat or to
observe the ease with which the fisherwomen on the docks carry their
tubs of fish back from the cleaning table to the tiers of packing
barrels to be convinced that these people have not only been trained to
work, but have physiques equal to the task. These studies included the
making of dental examinations, the taking of photographs, the obtaining
of samples of saliva for chemical analysis, the gathering of detailed
clinical records, and the collecting of samples of food for chemical
analysis and detailed nutritional data.</p>

<p>    Communication is very difficult among many of these islands. It
would be difficult to find more complete isolation than some of them
afford. We tried to get to the islands of Taransay and Scarpa on the
west coast of the Isle of Harris, but were unable to obtain
transportation since the trip can be made only in special, seaworthy
crafts, which will undertake the passage only at certain phases of the
tide and at certain directions of the winds. On one of these islands,
we were told, the growing boys and girls had exceedingly high immunity
to tooth decay. Their isolation was so great that a young woman of
about twenty years of age who came to the Isle of Harris from Taransay
Island had never seen milk in any larger quantity than drops. There are
no dairy animals on that island. Their nutrition is provided by their
oat products and fish, and by a very limited amount of vegetable foods.
Lobsters and flat fish are a very important part of their foods. Fruits
are practically unknown. Yet the physiques of these people are
remarkably fine.</p>

<p>    It was necessary sometimes for us to engage skilled seamen and
their crafts to make a special trip to some of these isolated islands.
These seamen watch critically the tide, wind and sky, and determine the
length of time it will be safe to travel in a certain direction under
conditions existing in the speed of the running tide and the periodic
change of the wind. Some of the islands are isolated by severe weather
conditions for many months of the year.</p>

<p>    These islands have been important in the whaling industry, even
up to recent years. We visited a whaling station on the Isle of Harris,
not active at this time, where monsters of the sea were towed into a
deep bay.</p>

<p>    In the interior of the Isle of Lewis the teeth of the growing
boys and girls had a very high degree of perfection, with only 1.3
teeth out of every hundred examined that had even been attacked by
dental caries.</p>

<p>    An important part of the study of these islands was the
observations made on conditions at the fringe of civilization. A
typical cross-section of the residents of the seaport town of Stornoway
can be seen assembled on the docks to greet the arrival of the evening
boat, the principal event of the community. The group consists largely
of adult young people. In a count of one hundred individuals appearing
to be between the ages of twenty and forty, twenty-five were already
wearing artificial teeth, and as many more would have been more
presentable had they too been so equipped. Dental caries was very
extensive in the modernized section of Stornoway. Since an important
part of these studies involved a determination of the kinds and
quantities of foods eaten, it was necessary to visit the sources
available for purchasing foods in each town studied. In Stornoway, one
could purchase angel food cake, white bread, as snow white as that to
be found in any community in the world, many other white-flour
products; also, canned marmalades, canned vegetables, sweetened fruit
juices, jams, confections of every type filled the store windows and
counters. These foods probably made a great appeal both because of
their variety and their high sugar content to the pallets of these
primitive people. The difference in physical appearance of the child
life of Stornoway from that of the interior of the Isle of Lewis was
striking. We found a family on the opposite coast of the island where
the two boys shown in the upper half of Fig. 6 resided. One had
excellent teeth and the other had rampant caries. These boys were
brothers eating at the same table. The older boy, with excellent teeth,
was still enjoying primitive food of oatmeal and oatcake and sea foods
with some limited dairy products. The younger boy, seen to the left,
had extensive tooth decay. Many teeth were missing including two in the
front. He insisted on having white bread, jam, highly sweetened coffee
and also sweet chocolates. His father told me with deep concern how
difficult it was for this boy to get up in the morning and go to
work.</p>

<p>    One of the sad stories of the Isle of Lewis has to do with the
recent rapid progress of the white plague. The younger generation of
the modernized part of the Isle of Lewis is not showing the same
resistance to tuberculosis as their ancestors. Indeed a special
hospital has been built at Stornoway for the rapidly increasing number
of tubercular patients, particularly for girls between twenty and
thirty years of age. The superintendent told me with deep concern of
the rapidity with which this menace is growing. Apparently very little
consideration was being given to the change in nutrition as a possible
explanation for the failure of this generation to show the defense of
previous generations against pulmonary tuberculosis. In this connection
much blame had been placed upon the housing conditions, it being
thought that the thatched-roof house with its smoke-laden air was an
important contributing factor, notwithstanding the fact that former
generations had been free from the disease. I was told that the
incidence of tuberculosis was frequently the same in the modern homes
as it was in the thatched-roof homes. It was of special interest to
observe the mental attitude of the native with regard to the
thatched-roof house. Again and again, we saw the new house built beside
the old one, and the people apparently living in the new one, but still
keeping the smoke smudging through the thatch of the old thatched-roof
house. When I inquired regarding this I was told by one of the
clearthinking residents that this thatch collected something from the
smoke which when put in the soil doubled the growth of plants and yield
of grain. He showed me with keen interest two patches of grain which
seemed to demonstrate the soundness of his contention.</p>

<p>    I was particularly interested in studying the growing boys and
girls at a place called Scalpay in the Isle of Harris. This Island is
very rocky and has only small patches of soil for available pasturage.
For nutrition, the children of this community were dependent very
largely on oatmeal porridge, oatcake and sea foods. An examination of
the growing boys and girls disclosed the fact that only one tooth out
of every hundred examined had ever been attacked by tooth decay. The
general physical development of these children was excellent, as may be
seen in the upper half of Fig. 7. Note their broad faces.</p>

<p>   This is in striking contrast with the children of the hamlet of
Tarbert which is the only shipping port on the Isle of Harris, and the
place of export of most of the famous Harris tweeds which are
manufactured on looms in the various crofters' homes. These Tarbert
children had an incidence of 32.4 carious teeth out of every hundred
teeth examined. The distance between these two points is not over ten
miles and both have equal facilities for obtaining sea foods, being on
the coast. Only the latter, however, has access to modern foods, since
it supports a white bread bakery store with modern jams, marmalades,
and other kinds of canned foods. In studying the tragedy of the rampant
tooth decay in the mouth of a young man, I asked him regarding his
plans and he stated that he was expecting to go to Stornoway about
sixty miles away in the near future, where there was a dentist, and
have all his teeth extracted and plates made. He said that it was no
use to have any teeth filled, that he would have to lose them anyway
since that was everybody's experience in Tarbert. The young women were
in just as poor a condition.</p>

<p>    Through the department of dental inspection for north Scotland,
I learned of a place on the Isle of Skye, Airth of Sleat, in which only
a few years ago there were thirty-six children in the school, and not
one case of dental caries in the group. My examination of the children
in this community disclosed two groups, one living exclusively on
modern foods, and the other on primitive foods. Those living on
primitive foods had only 0.7 carious teeth per hundred, while those in
the group living on modern foods had 16.3, or twenty-three times as
many.</p>

<p>    This community living near the sea had recently been connected
with the outside world by daily steamboat service which delivered to
the people modern foods of various kinds, and within this community a
modern bakery, and a supply house for purchasing the canned vegetables,
jams and marmalades had been established. This district was just in the
process of being modernized.</p>

<p>    I examined teeth of several people in the seventies and
eighties, and except for gingival infections with some loosening of the
teeth, nearly all of the teeth were present and there was very little
evidence that dental caries had ever existed. The elderly people were
bemoaning the fact that the generation that was growing up had not the
health of former generations. I asked what their explanation was and
they pointed to two stone grinding mills which they said had ground the
oats for oatcake and porridge for their families and preceding families
for hundreds of years. Though they prized them highly, the plea that
they would be helpful in educational work in America induced them to
sell the mills to me. They told us with great concern of the recent
rapid decline in health of the young people of this district.</p>

<p>    This one-time well-populated Island, the misty Isle of Skye,
still has one of the finest of the famous old castles, that belonging
to the Dunvegan clan. It participated in the romantic life of Prince
Charlie. The castle equipment still boasts the grandeur of a past
glory. Among the relics is a horn which measured the draft to be drunk
by a prospective chieftain before he could aspire to the leadership of
the clan. He must drink its contents of two quarts without stopping.
Again the character of that manhood is reflected in the fact that
although a bounty of thirty thousand pounds was placed upon the head of
Prince Charlie, none of the many who knew his place of hiding betrayed
it.</p>

<p>    On my return from the Outer Hebrides to Scotland, I was
concerned to obtain information from government officials relative to
the incidence of tooth decay and the degenerative diseases in various
parts of north Scotland. I was advised that in the last fifty years the
average height of Scotch men in some parts decreased four inches, and
that this had been coincident with the general change from high
immunity to dental caries to a loss of immunity in a great part of this
general district. A study of the market places revealed that a large
part of the nutrition was shipped into the district in the form of
refined flours and canned goods and sugar. There were very few herds of
dairy cattle to be seen. It was explained that even the highland cattle
did not do as well as formerly on the same ranges.</p>

<p>    As one proceeds from the north of Scotland southward to England
and Wales, there is a marked increase in the percentage of individuals
wearing artificial restorations or in need of them. In several
communities this reached fifty per cent of adults over thirty years of
age. An effort was made to find primitive people in the high country of
Wales, but without success. We were advised that about the only place
that we would be likely to find people living under primitive
conditions would be on the Island of Bardsey off the northwest coast of
Wales. This is a rock and storm-bound island with the decadent walls of
an old castle and a community made up largely of recently imported
colonists whom we were advised had been taken to the Island to
re-populate it. There is considerable good farm land, but very limited
grazing stock. Formerly the Island had produced the foods for its
inhabitants with the assistance of the sea. These sources of natural
foods have been largely displaced with imported white flour,
marmalades, sugar, jams and canned goods. We found the physical
condition of the people very poor, particularly that of the growing
boys and girls. Tooth decay was so wide-spread that 27.6 out of every
hundred teeth examined in the growing boys and girls had already been
attacked by dental caries. It was even active in three year olds. From
a conference with the director of public health of this district I
learned that tuberculosis constituted a very great problem, not only
for the people on this island, but for those of many districts of
northern Wales. This was ascribed to the lowered defense of the people
due to causes unknown. It had been noted that individuals with rampant
tooth decay were more susceptible to pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<p>    While on the Island of Bardsey, I inquired as to what they
thought was the cause of such extensive tooth decay as we found, and
was told that they were familiar with the cause and that it was due to
close contact with the salt water and salt air. When I asked why many
of the old people who had lived by the sea all their lives in some
districts still had practically all their teeth and had never had tooth
decay, no explanation was available. This they said was the reason that
had been given in answer to their inquiries.</p>

<p>    There is a very remarkable history written in the ruins of the
island, and in the faces of the people who live on the Island of
Bardsey. The rugged walls of ancient castles bespeak the glory and
power of the people who lived proudly in past centuries. They are
testified to also by the monuments in the cemeteries; but a new era has
come to this island. The director of public health, of this district of
Wales, including Bardsey Island, told me the story of the decline and
almost complete extinction of the population due to tuberculosis. He
also told how the government had re-populated the Island with fifty
healthy young families, and then the sad story of how these new
settlers were breaking down as rapidly as the former occupants.</p>

<p>    The lower photograph in Fig. 7 is of a family of four children
in whose faces the tragic story is deeply written. Everyone is a mouth
breather and everyone has rampant tooth decay. These people are
products of modernization on this island which one time produced
vigorous children and stalwart men and women. It is important to
compare the faces of the children of the Isle of Bardsey shown in Fig.
7 below with those shown in Fig. 7 above living in an isolated district
in the Isle of Harris. As we will see later, the facial deformity does
not reach its maximum severity until the eruption of the second
dentition and the development of the adult face, usually at from nine
to fourteen years of age. In cases of extreme injury, however, we find
it appearing in the childhood face during the period of temporary or
deciduous dentition. These children will, doubtless, be much more
seriously deformed when their permanent dentitions and adult faces
develop. It is important for us to keep this picture in mind in its
relation to the high incidence of tuberculosis as we read succeeding
chapters and find the part played by modernization in breaking down the
defense of individuals to infective processes including
tuberculosis.</p>

<p>    In Fig. 6 (lower left) is a young girl from the Isle of Bardsey.
She is about seventeen years of age. Her teeth were wrecked with dental
caries, the disease involving even the front teeth. We ate a meal at
the home in which she was living. It consisted of white bread, butter
and jam, all imported to the island. This is in striking contrast with
the picture of the girl shown in Fig. 6 (lower right) living in the
Isle of Lewis, in the central area. She has splendidly formed dental
arches and a high immunity to tooth decay. Her diet and that of her
parents was oatmeal porridge and oatcake and fish which built stalwart
people. The change in the two generations was illustrated by a little
girl and her grandfather on the Isle of Skye. He was the product of the
old r&eacute;gime, and about eighty years of age. He was carrying the
harvest from the fields on his back when I stopped him to take his
picture. He was typical of the stalwart product raised on the native
foods. His granddaughter had pinched nostrils and narrowed face. Her
dental arches were deformed and her teeth crowded. She was a mouth
breather. She had the typical expression of the result of modernization
after the parents had adopted the modern foods of commerce, and
abandoned the oatcake, oatmeal porridge and sea foods.</p>

<p>    Since a fundamental part of this study involves an examination
of the accumulated wisdom of the primitive racial stocks, it is
important that we look further into the matter of the smoked thatch. I
was advised by the old residents that a serious conflict existed
between them and the health officials who came from outside to their
island. The latter blamed the smoke for the sudden development of
tuberculosis in acute form, and they insisted that the old procedure be
entirely discontinued. For this purpose the government gave very
substantial assistance in the building of new and modern homes. The
experienced natives contended that the oat crop would not mature in
that severe climate without being fertilized with the smoked thatch.
While they were willing to move into the new house, they were not
willing to give up the smoking of the oat straw used for the thatch to
prepare it for fertilizing the ground. I brought some of this smoked
thatch with me both for chemical analysis and for testing for the
influence on plant growth. This was done by adding different quantities
of the smoked thatch to a series of pots in which oat seeds were
planted. In Fig. 8 will be seen the result. The pot to the right shows
the result of planting the oats in a sandy soil almost like that of the
Islands of the Outer Hebrides. The oats only grew to the fuzzy limited
condition shown. As increasing amounts of this thatch were added to the
soil, there was an increase in the ruggedness of the plants so that in
the last pot to the left tall stalks were developed heavily loaded with
grain which ripened by the time the growth shown in the other pots had
occurred. The chemical analysis of the thatch showed that it contained
a quantity of fixed nitrogen and other chemicals resulting from the
peat smoke circulating through the thatch. This explains the confidence
of the hardy old natives who insisted on being permitted to continue
the smoking of the thatch even though they did not live in the
house.</p>

<p>    A dietary program competent to build stalwart men and women and
rugged boys and girls is provided the residents of these barren
Islands, with their wind and storm-swept coasts, by a diet of oats used
as oatcake and oatmeal porridge; together with fish products, including
some fish organs and eggs. A seriously degenerated stock followed the
displacement of this diet with a typical modern diet consisting of
white bread, sugar, jams, syrup, chocolate, coffee, some fish without
livers, canned vegetables, and eggs.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED
ESKIMOS</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">D</font>URING the rise and fall of historic and
prehistoric cultures that have often left their monuments and arts
following each other in succession in the same location, one culture,
the Eskimo, living on until today, brings us a robust sample of the
Stone Age people. The Maya race is gone, but has left its monuments.
The Indian race is rapidly changing or disappearing in North America.
The Eskimo race has remained true to ancestral type to give us a living
demonstration of what Nature can do in the building of a race competent
to withstand for thousands of years the rigors of an Arctic climate.
Like the Indian, the Eskimo thrived as long as he was not blighted by
the touch of modern civilization, but with it, like all primitives, he
withers and dies.</p>

<p>    In his primitive state he has provided an example of physical
excellence and dental perfection such as has seldom been excelled by
any race in the past or present. We are concerned to know the secret of
this great achievement since his circumscribed life greatly reduces the
factors that may enter as controlling units in molding this excellence.
While we are primarily concerned in this study with the characteristics
of the Eskimo dentition and facial form and the effect upon it of his
contact with modern civilization, we are also deeply concerned to know
the formula of his nutrition in order that we may learn from it the
secrets that will not only aid the unfortunate modern or so-called
civilized races, but will also, if possible, provide means for
assisting in their preservation.</p>

<p>    It is a sad commentary that with the coming of the white man the
Eskimos and Indians are rapidly reduced both in numbers and physical
excellence by the white man's diseases. We have few problems more
urgent or more challenging than that means shall soon be found for
preventing the extermination of the primitive Americans. Many reports
have been made with regard to the condition of the teeth of the
Eskimos. Doubtless, all have been relatively authentic for the groups
studied, which have been chiefly along the routes of commerce. Clearly
those people would not represent the most primitive groups, which could
only be located beyond the reach of contact with modern civilization.
The problems involved strongly suggested the desirability of locating
and studying Eskimos in isolated districts. While dog teams could
furnish means of approach in the winter season, they would not be
available for summer travel.</p>

<p>    Through the kindness of Dr. Alexis Hrdlicka, who has made
anthropological studies of the Eskimos in many of the districts of
Alaska, I learned that the most primitive groups were located south of
the Yukon in the country between it and Bristol Bay including the Delta
and mouth of the Kuskokwim River. A government station has been
established on the Kuskokwim River for which a government boat enters
the mouth of the Kuskokwim to deliver supplies. It carries officials,
but not passengers. This contact with civilization has made available
modern foods for a limited district, chiefly at the point at which the
boat lands, namely, Bethel. A portion of these supplies is transported
by a stern-wheel river boat to settlements farther up the river. A
great number, however, of Eskimos live between the mouth of the
Kuskokwim and the mouth of the Yukon River, on the mainland and
islands, a distance of several hundred miles, and have little or no
contact with this food.</p>

<p>    Accordingly, our program for making these field studies among
the Eskimos in 1933 required transportation over long distances and
into districts where travelling facilities were practically
non-existent by other means than by modern aeroplane. Mrs. Price
accompanies and assists me with my records. Our itinerary included
steamship service to Seward in western Alaska and railway to Anchorage,
where an aeroplane was chartered which carried us to various districts
in western and central Alaska. This plane carried our field equipment,
and travelled to the points selected. The great Alaska mountain range,
culminating in the magnificent Mt. McKinley, stretches across Alaska
from the Aleutian Peninsula at the southwest far into the heart of this
vast territory. The highest mountain in the United States proper is Mt.
Whitney, 14,502 feet. The highest mountain in Canada is Mt. Logan,
19,539 feet. Alaska, however, boasts many mountains that are higher
than any of these, many of which are in this range. Mt. McKinley is
20,300 feet. It was necessary for us to surmount this magnificent range
to reach the territory in which our investigations were to be made. The
special aeroplane selected was equipped with radio for both sending and
receiving, and was in touch, or could be in touch at all times, with
the Signal Service Corps, as well as with the headquarters and branches
of the Company. Owing to clouds in the selected pass, the pilot found
it necessary to go one hundred fifty miles out of his course to find
one that was clear enough to fly through. Beyond these mountains were
vast areas of bare wilderness with no signs of human life. Moose were
frequently seen.</p>

<p>    Our first objective was to find, if possible, a band of Indians
reported to live on Stony River. They had been described as being very
primitive. Our pilot, who was well informed about this region, said
this was the first time he had even landed in this district. All the
people were busy catching and storing the running salmon. After drying
the fish they are smoked for a few hours and then stored for winter
use. These thrifty people have physical features quite unlike the
Indians of central, southern and eastern Alaska. Of the twelve
individuals studied here, ten had lived entirely on the native foods or
practically so. In their 288 teeth only one tooth was found that had
ever been attacked by tooth decay, or 0.3 per cent. Two had come up
from the Kuskokwim River, of which the Stony River is a branch. There,
they had received a considerable quantity of the "store grub" that had
been shipped up the Kuskokwim from Bethel. Twenty-seven per cent of the
teeth of these two had been attacked by dental caries.</p>

<p>    We then proceeded to Sleet Mute, on the Kuskokwim River, where
three individuals were found who had lived entirely on native foods.
None of them had ever had a tooth attacked by tooth decay. Seven others
had lived partly on native foods and partly on "store grub," and they
had dental caries in 12.2 per cent of their teeth.</p>

<p>    At Crooked Creek, the next settlement, eight individuals were
examined and of their 216 teeth forty-one, or 18.9 per cent, had
caries. All but one of these were living in considerable part on "store
grub," and this individual had no dental caries.</p>

<p>    At Napimute, 16 per cent of the teeth had been attacked by
dental caries, but no individuals studied here were living entirely on
native foods.</p>

<p>    Bethel is the largest settlement on the Kuskokwim, and contains
in addition to the white residents many visiting Eskimos from the
nearby Tundra country surrounding it. Eighty-eight individuals studied
here were largely Eskimos and mixed bloods. Of their 2,490 teeth, 11.6
per cent, or 281 teeth, had been attacked by tooth decay. Of these
eighty-eight individuals twenty-seven with 796 teeth had lived almost
exclusively on natural foods, and in this group only one tooth was
found with dental caries, or 0.1 per cent. Forty individuals were
living almost exclusively on modern foods as shipped in by the
government supply boat. Of their 1,094 teeth, 252, or 21.1 per cent,
had been attacked by tooth decay. Twenty-one individuals were living
partly on native foods and partly on "store grub," and of their 600
teeth thirty-eight, or 6.3 per cent, had been attacked by tooth
decay.</p>

<p>    At Kokamute, on the Bering Sea at the mouth of the Kuskokwim
River, a large band of very primitive Eskimos was studied. They had
come from the vicinity of Nelson Island, a district which has had
exceedingly little contact with modern civilization. In this group
twenty-eight individuals with 820 teeth showed only one tooth, or 0.1
per cent, that had ever been attacked by dental caries.</p>

<p>    Bethel Island is situated in the Kuskokwim River. It is visited
in the summer by Eskimos from the Tundra Country for laying in their
store of fish for winter use. Of fifteen individuals here, thirteen,
with 410 teeth, had lived exclusively on native foods, and not a single
tooth had been attacked by dental caries. Two had come from Bethel, and
of their sixty teeth twenty-one or 35 per cent had been attacked by
tooth decay.</p>

<p>    In the various groups in the lower Kuskokwim seventy-two
individuals who were living exclusively on native foods had in their
2,138 teeth only two teeth or 0.09 per cent that had ever been attacked
by tooth decay. In this district eighty-one individuals were studied
who had been living in part or in considerable part on modern foods,
and of their 2,254 teeth 394 or 13 per cent had been attacked by dental
caries. This represents an increase in dental caries of 144 fold.</p>

<p>    It next became desirable to study a district that had been in
contact with the foods of modern commerce for many years, and for this
Holy Cross was selected. This community is located on the Yukon River
above the Arctic Circle. It has been in contact with the summer
commerce of the Yukon for several decades. It has one of the oldest and
best organized Catholic Missions of Alaska. The individuals studied
were all in the school connected with the Mission. The students had
come from as far north as Point Barrow on the Arctic Ocean and west to
the Bering Straits. All but one had been in contact with and had used
modern foods before coming to the Mission, and were using them while
there. This one individual had lived exclusively on native foods before
coming to the Mission and he had no carious teeth. In eight individuals
with 224 teeth, who had lived very largely on modern foods, forty-two
teeth or 18.7 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay. Four
individuals had lived partly on native foods and partly on modern
foods, and of their 112 teeth four, or 3.5 per cent, had been attacked
by tooth decay.</p>

<p>    It is of interest that while the Eskimos and Indians have lived
in accord, they have not intermarried. The Eskimos occupy the lower
section of the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers, and the Bering Sea frontier.
The Indians have occupied the Upper waterways of both these rivers. The
next place selected for study was McGrath, which is on the Upper
Kuskokwim not far distant from the McKinley Mountain Range. It is the
upper terminus of navigation on the Kuskokwim River for the stern-wheel
river boats. Its chief importance lies in the fact that it is the
division point on the Cross Alaska Aeroplane Routes from Anchorage or
Fairbanks to Nome and other western points. Its population consists of
several white prospectors and miners who have stayed in the country
following the gold rush. Some of them have married Indian and Eskimo
women. Of twenty-one individuals only one had lived almost exclusively
on native foods and she had no dental caries. Twenty had lived chiefly
on imported foods, and of their 527 teeth 175, or 33.2 per cent, had
been attacked by tooth decay.</p>

<p>    Among the residents of McGrath there is a remarkable family. The
father is an American mining engineer who has spent much of his life in
that country. His wife is a charming Eskimo woman of splendid
intelligence and fine personality. She had come originally from the
lower Kuskokwim and was one of the primitive Eskimo stock. While mining
interests had provided food supplies for the family, shipped from the
United States, she followed her early training and insisted on catching
and storing salmon in season as an important part of her own dietary.
The salmon were dried and smoked as was the custom of her people. She
is the mother of at least twenty children, for she could give the names
of that many. Only eleven were living, however, several having died
from tuberculosis. Notwithstanding her many overloads, not a single
tooth had ever been attacked by tooth decay. A lower anterior tooth had
been broken. A picture of this woman is shown in Fig. 9 (upper, left).
There has been extensive wear of the teeth, as is characteristic of the
teeth of many of the Eskimos, a matter which we will presently discuss.
It is of interest to note the splendid symmetry of her dental arches.
Her children and husband and son-in-law had lived very largely on
modern foods and in these eight individuals with 212 teeth
eighty-seven, or 41 per cent, had been attacked by tooth decay. Her
oldest living daughter is twenty-two years of age. She has a narrowing
of the upper arch and extensive tooth decay. Another daughter, sixteen,
is a beautiful girl except for her narrow dental arches. She was
reported by our pilot to have become so deeply interested in the
engines of the aircrafts as they stopped at this point for servicing
and fuel that she had become expert in tuning up and conditioning
aeroplane motors. She, doubtless, inherited some of the genius of her
father, who is a mining engineer. Twelve of her teeth had been attacked
by dental caries.</p>

<p>    One does not get a conception of the magnificent dental
development of the more primitive Eskimos simply by learning that they
have freedom from dental caries. The size and strength of the mandible,
the breadth of the face and the strength of the muscles of mastication
all reach a degree of excellence that is seldom seen in other races.
This is typically illustrated in Fig. 9. I was told that an average
adult Eskimo man can carry one hundred pounds in each hand and one
hundred pounds in his teeth with ease for a considerable distance. This
illustrates the physical development of other parts of the body as well
as the jaws, and suggests that the exercising of the jaws is not the
sole reason for their very fine teeth, since the superb development of
the musculature includes all parts of the body. It has also been
suggested that chewing of tough foods, by building teeth of
exceptionally fine quality, has been an important factor in the
establishment of immunity to caries. As will be shown presently, the
teeth of these individuals with their excellent physical development
and fine tooth structure develop caries when they depart from their
native foods and adopt our modern foods.</p>

<p>    Much has been reported in the literature of the excessive wear
of the Eskimos' teeth, which in the case of the women has been ascribed
to the chewing of the leather in the process of tanning. It is of
interest that while many of the teeth studied gave evidence of
excessive wear involving the crowns to a depth that in many individuals
would have exposed the pulps, there was in no case an open pulp
chamber. They were always filled with secondary dentin. This is
important since our newer knowledge indicates that with the chemical
characteristics of their food we might expect that secondary dentin
would be readily formed within the pulp chambers by a process similar
to that which occurs in many individuals under a diet reinforced with
mineral and activator-providing foods. One old Eskimo had a scar on his
lower lip, which was the result of perforations for carrying a
decoration as practiced by his tribe. I have found primitive tribes in
several parts of the world with this marking.</p>

<p>    The principal outer garment worn by the Eskimo for the more
primitive groups consists of a parka carrying a hood which is pulled
over the head and closed around the neck with a shirr string, while
another shirr string controls the size of the face opening in the hood
when it is up. In the summer this is made of cloth or of skin without
the fur. A typical case is shown in Fig. 9. It will again be noted that
the teeth are excessively worn.</p>

<p>   Owing to the bleakness of the winds off the Bering Sea, even in
the summer many of the women wear furs. A typical mother and child
dressed in their warm clothing are shown in Fig. 10. The Eskimo women
are both artistic and skillful in needle work. They use fur of
different colors for decorating their garments. These women make
artistic decorations by carving ivory from walrus teeth and from the
buried tusks of the hairy mammoth that wandered over the Tundra tens of
thousands of years ago. The ear decoration of this Eskimo woman is a
typical design. This mother's teeth are literally "two rows of pearls."
It is important to note the width of the arches. One is continually
impressed with the magnificent health of the child life which is
illustrated in Fig. 10. In our various contacts with them we never
heard an Eskimo child crying except when hungry, or frightened by the
presence of strangers. The women are characterized by the abundance of
breastfood which almost always develops normally and is maintained
without difficulty for a year. The mothers were completely free of
dental caries, and I was told that the children of the Eskimos have no
difficulties with the cutting of their teeth.</p>

<p>   The excellence of dentitions among the Eskimos has been a
characteristic also of the skulls that have been excavated in various
parts of Alaska.</p>

<p>    It might be expected that such wonderfully formed teeth would
maintain so high an immunity to dental caries that their proud
possessors would never be troubled with tooth decay. This,
unfortunately, is not the case, a fact of great significance in
evaluating our modern theories of the causes of dental caries. When
these adult Eskimos exchange their foods for our modern foods, which we
will discuss in Chapter 15, they often have very extensive tooth decay
and suffer severely. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 11, for these
Eskimos' teeth had been seriously wrecked by tooth decay. They had been
living on modern foods and were typical of a large number who are in
contact with the Bering Sea ports. Their plight often becomes tragic
since there are no dentists in these districts.</p>

<p>    A typical effect of modernization on a growing girl was shown in
a case in which the central incisors and 16 other teeth were attacked
by dental caries. Sixty-four per cent of her teeth had tooth decay.</p>

<p>    There are no dentists in western Alaska, north or west of
Anchorage, which is near the southern coast, except at Fairbanks which,
like Anchorage, is many hundreds of miles from these Eskimos. It would
take months for them to make the journey in winter by dog team, and it
would be practically impossible to make it in the summer season by any
means of travel except by aeroplane, which clearly these people could
not afford. Their dilemma is, accordingly, most tragic when they
suddenly become victims of diseases which require hospitalization or
skilled medical or dental service. One mining engineer in the interior
told me that he had spent two thousand dollars to have a dentist
brought in by aeroplane to render dental service. On my examination of
his mouth I found twenty-nine of his thirty-two teeth had been attacked
by dental caries.</p>

<p>    One important phase of modern degeneration, namely, change in
facial and dental arch form and other physical expressions, is of
interest. It is a matter of great significance that the Eskimos who are
living in isolated districts and on native foods have produced
uniformly broad dental arches and typical Eskimo facial patterns. Even
the first generation forsaking that diet and using the modern diet,
presents large numbers of individuals with marked changes in facial and
dental arch form. In Fig. 12 will be seen four Eskimo girls who are of
the first generation following the adoption of modernized foods by
their parents. All have deformed dental arches. It is important to note
the pattern of the settling inward of the lateral incisors and the
crowding outward of the cuspids. This facial design is currently
assigned to a mixing of racial bloods. These girls are pure-blooded
Eskimos whose parents have normally formed dental arches.</p>

deformities or crowded teeth are practically unknown among many of the

<p>    We are particularly concerned with the foods used by these
primitive Eskimos. They almost always have their homes on or near deep
water. Their skill in handling their kayaks is most remarkable. During
the salmon running season they store large quantities of dried salmon.
They spear many of these fish from their kayaks; even young boys are
very skillful. They land salmon so large that they can hardly lift
them. They are expert in spearing seals from these light crafts. Seal
oil provides a very important part of their nutrition. As each piece of
fish is broken off, it is dipped in seal oil. I obtained some seal oil
from them and brought it to my laboratory for analyzing for its vitamin
content. It proved to be one of the richest foods in vitamin A that I
have found.</p>

<p>    The fish are hung on racks in the wind for drying. Fish eggs are
also spread out to dry, as shown in Fig. 13. These foods constitute a
very important part of the nutrition of the small children after they
are weaned. Naturally, the drifting sands of the bleak Bering Straits
lodge upon and cling to the moist surfaces of the fish that are hung up
to dry. This constitutes the principal cause for the excessive wear of
the Eskimos' teeth in both men and women.</p>

<p>    The food of these Eskimos in their native state includes
caribou, ground nuts which are gathered by mice and stored in caches,
kelp which is gathered in season and stored for winter use, berries
including cranberries which are preserved by freezing, blossoms of
flowers preserved in seal oil, sorrel grass preserved in seal oil, and
quantities of frozen fish. Another important food factor consists of
the organs of the large animals of the sea, including certain layers of
the skin of one of the species of whale, which has been found to be
very high in vitamin C.</p>

<p>    Since contact with our modern civilization, the Eskimo
population for Alaska is very rapidly declining. One authority has
quoted the reduction of 50 per cent in population in seventy-five
years.</p>

<p>    An important observation has been made relative to the rapid
shortening of the average life by Dr. V. E. Levine and Professor C. W.
Bauer, of Creighton University, Nebraska, who reported:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Cordova, Alaska, Oct. 26, 1934--Due to
susceptibility to tuberculosis and other diseases the average life span
of the Eskimo of Alaska is only 20 years and their race is doomed to
extinction within a few generations unless modern medical science comes
to their aid.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Unless a very radical change is made in the interference with
the native supply of game and sea foods, the Eskimo population seems
destined to have a rapid decline and an early extinction. Their
primitive fish foods have been largely curtailed by the encroachment on
their salmon streams made by modern canneries.</p>

<p>    It is of interest to discuss in connection with the Alaskan
Eskimo two white boys (one is shown in Fig. 14), who were sons of a
mining engineer. They had been born and raised in a mining camp in
Alaska, where their foods had been almost entirely shipped in. I
travelled with the mother of these two boys who was bringing them to
the United States for operations on their noses, because they were
mouth-breathers. It is important to observe the marked underdevelopment
of both the middle third and lower third of the face of the boy shown
in Fig. 14. The nutrition of the family during their development and
growth had been largely provided in package form shipped in from the
United States. Their disfiguration is typical of that of large numbers
that are developing in our highly modernized communities, and is
similar, in general, to the deformities which develop in the primitive
races after they adopt the modernized nutrition.</p>

<p>    Notwithstanding the very inhospitable part of the world in which
they reside, with nine or ten months of winter and only two or three of
summer, and in spite of the absence for long periods of plant foods and
dairy products and eggs, the Eskimos were able to provide their bodies
with all the mineral and vitamin requirements from sea foods, stored
greens and berries and plants from the sea.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED NORTH
AMERICAN INDIANS</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">N</font>ATURE seems to have made one of her large
scale demonstrations in the Americas of the power of adaptation of a
single racial stock to the scale of climates ranging from torrid
jungles of the tropics to the Arctics. The various members of the
American Indian race seem clearly to have come from a common origin.
The route by which they reached America from Asia as suggested by
anthropologists was by way of the Bering Strait. Within a decade a
Russian engineer has crossed from Asia to America on the pack ice of
the Bering sea, a distance of ninety miles. If this is possible now,
how much more likely is it that it has been possible in earlier periods
of the world's history, as, for example, during or following the last
ice age, or at the time of an earlier ice age. The American Indian,
therefore, provides a very remarkable opportunity to study both the
capacity for adaptability to different environments and the variations
that different environments can produce in a single racial stock. That
the Indian of today is not in general a counterpart of the native
resident at the time of the discovery of America by Columbus is clearly
demonstrated both by the skeletal material and by the early
records.</p>

<p>    Our problem involved the location and study of groups of the
original stock, if such were to be found, who were living in accordance
with the tradition of their race and as little affected as might be
possible by the influence of the white man. At first thought it might
seem impossible that such groups can exist, but as a matter of fact
there are still great areas of the American continent inhabited by the
original stock living in areas still unexplored. In order to find
Indians as little changed as possible by reason of their contact with
the white man, particularly with the white man's foods, I went to
northern Canada to the region inside the Rocky Mountain range to study
the Indians of Northern British Columbia and the Yukon territory. Since
an aeroplane could not be used, owing to the lack of a base of supplies
for fuel for the return trip; and since the MacKenzie water route was
impracticable (an expedition could not go up the waterways through
Canada on the MacKenzie River and its branches and return the same
season), the route selected was that which enters that territory from
Alaska on the large waterway of the Stikine River. This river has cut
its channel through the Coast and Cascade Ranges of mountains and has
its origin in the high western watershed of the Rockies. It was
particularly desirable to reach a group of Indians who could not obtain
the animal life of the sea, not even the running salmon. These fish do
not enter the waterways draining to the Arctic. We used a high-powered
river transport specially designed for going up rapids on the Stikine
River to the end of navigation at Telegraph Creek. At this point large
quantities of modern foods are stored during the short open navigation
season of the summer to be exchanged for furs during the long winter. A
Hudson Bay Post has been established at this point. Here a truck was
chartered which took us over a trail across the Rocky Mountain Divide
to the headwaters of the rivers flowing north to the Arctic. At this
outpost two guides were engaged and a high powered scow chartered to
make the trip down the waterways toward the Arctic on the Diese and
Liard Rivers. This made it possible, in the summer of 1933, to make
contact with large bands of Indians who had come out of the Pelly
mountain country to exchange their catch of furs at the last outpost of
the Hudson Bay Company. Most of the Indians of Canada are under treaty
with the Canadian Government whereby that government gives them an
annual per capita bounty. This arrangement induces the Indians in the
interior to come out to the designated centers to obtain the bounty.
Since it is based on the number in the family, all of the children are
brought. This treaty, however, was never signed by the Indians of the
British Columbia and Yukon Territory. And, accordingly, they have
remained as nomadic wandering tribes following the moose and caribou
herds in the necessary search to obtain their foods.</p>

<p>    The rigorous winters reach seventy degrees below zero. This
precludes the possibility of maintaining dairy animals or growing seed
cereals or fruits. The diet of these Indians is almost entirely limited
to the wild animals of the chase. This made a study of them exceedingly
important. The wisdom of these people regarding Nature's laws, and
their skill in adapting themselves to the rigorous climate and very
limited variety of foods, and these often very hard to obtain, have
developed a skill in the art of living comfortably with rugged Nature
that has been approached by few other tribes in the world. The sense of
honor among these tribes is so strong that practically all cabins,
temporarily unoccupied due to the absence of the Indians on their
hunting trip, were entirely unprotected by locks; and the valuables
belonging to the Indians were left in plain sight. The people were
remarkably hospitable, and where they had not been taken advantage of
were very kind. Many of the women had never seen a white woman until
they saw Mrs. Price. Their knowledge of woodcraft as expressed in skill
in building their cabins so that they would be kept comfortably warm
and protected from the sub-zero weather was remarkable. Their planning
ahead for storing provisions and firewood strongly emphasized their
community spirit. When an Indian and his family moved to a camp site on
a lake or river, they always girdled a few more trees than they would
use for firewood so that there would be a plentiful supply of dry
standing timber for future visitors to the camp.</p>

<p>    They lived in a country in which grizzly bears were common.
Their pelts were highly prized and they captured many of them with
baited pitfalls. Their knowledge of the use of different organs and
tissues of the animals for providing a defense against certain of the
affections of the body which we speak of as degenerative diseases was
surprising. When I asked an old Indian, through an interpreter, why the
Indians did not get scurvy he replied promptly that that was a white
man's disease. I asked whether it was possible for the Indians to get
scurvy. He replied that it was, but said that the Indians know how to
prevent it and the white man does not. When asked why he did not tell
the white man how, his reply was that the white man knew too much to
ask the Indian anything. I then asked him if he would tell me. He said
he would if the chief said he might. He went to see the chief and
returned in about an hour, saying that the chief said he could tell me
because I was a friend of the Indians and had come to tell the Indians
not to eat the food in the white man's store. He took me by the hand
and led me to a log where we both sat down. He then described how when
the Indian kills a moose he opens it up and at the back of the moose
just above the kidney there are what he described as two small balls in
the fat. These he said the Indian would take and cut up into as many
pieces as there were little and big Indians in the family and each one
would eat his piece. They would eat also the walls of the second
stomach. By eating these parts of the animal the Indians would keep
free from scurvy, which is due to the lack of vitamin C. The Indians
were getting vitamin C from the adrenal glands and organs. Modern
science has very recently discovered that the adrenal glands are the
richest sources of vitamin C in all animal or plant tissues. We found
these Indians most cooperative in aiding us. We, of course, had taken
presents that we thought would be appreciated by them, and we had no
difficulty in making measurements and photographs, nor, indeed, in
making a detailed study of the condition of each tooth in the dental
arches. I obtained samples of saliva, and of their foods for chemical
analysis. A typical Indian family in the big timber forests in shown in
Fig. 15.</p>

<p>    The condition of the teeth, and the shape of the dental arches
and the facial form, were superb. Indeed, in several groups examined
not a single tooth was found that had ever been attacked by tooth
decay. In an examination of eighty-seven individuals having 2,464 teeth
only four teeth were found that had ever been attacked by dental
caries. This is equivalent to 0.16 per cent. As we came back to
civilization and studied, successively, different groups with
increasing amounts of contact with modern civilization, we found dental
caries increased progressively, reaching 25.5 per cent of all of the
teeth examined at Telegraph Creek, the point of contact with the white
man's foods. As we came down the Stikine River to the Alaskan frontier
towns, the dental caries problem increased to 40 per cent of all of the
teeth.</p>

<p>    Careful inquiry regarding the presence of arthritis was made in
the more isolated groups. We neither saw nor heard of a case in the
isolated groups. However, at the point of contact with the foods of
modern civilization many cases were found including ten bed-ridden
cripples in a series of about twenty Indian homes. Some other
affections made their appearance here, particularly tuberculosis which
was taking a very severe toll of the children who had been born at this
center. In Fig. 16 are seen two typical cases of tubercular involvement
of glands of the neck. The suffering from tooth decay was tragic. There
were no dentists, no doctors available within hundreds of miles to
relieve suffering.</p>

<p>    The physiques of the Indians of the far north who are still
living in their isolated locations and in accordance with their
accumulated wisdom were superb. There were practically no irregular
teeth, including no impacted third molars, as evidenced by the fact
that all individuals old enough to have the molars erupted had them
standing in position and functioning normally for mastication. The
excellence of the dental arches is shown in Fig. 17. Where the Indians
were using the white man's food tooth decay was very severe, as shown
in Fig. 18. In the new generation, after meeting the white civilization
and using his foods, many developed crooked teeth, so-called, with
deformed dental arches, as seen in Fig. 19.</p>

<p>    Contact was also made with representatives of relatively
isolated primitive Indian stocks in the district south of Hudson Bay.
These groups were reached by a newly projected railroad extending
eastward and northward from Winnipeg, Manitoba, and we were thus
brought into contact with the Indians that had come out of the
waterways draining the Hudson Bay and from as far north as James Bay.
They had come down to dispose of their furs in exchange for ammunition,
blankets, etc. Since this contact was made only once or twice a year,
it was quite impossible for the Indians to carry back a sufficient
quantity of the foods of the white man to have great influence on their
total diet for the year. They still lived on the wild animal game of
the land. As in the northern country just reviewed, their principal
large animal was the moose. These are treaty Indians, and many of them
come out to this frontier to obtain the government bounty and,
accordingly, were obliged to bring their families. The bounty here
amounted to five dollars per head, a considerable income in exchange
for blankets and other equipment. Some of these contact points were at
the height of the land dividing the waters running north and east to
James Bay and Hudson Bay, or south to Lake Superior. This was historic
country that had been the meeting ground of the tribes of the northern
waters with the tribes of the Great Lakes district. Many battles had
been fought there. For comparison with these more primitive groups from
the Hudson and James Bay watershed, I had the opportunity here of
studying families that had taken up residence along the railroad or in
its vicinity in order that they might have the advantage of exchanging
furs for the modern white man's foods. This gave us an excellent
opportunity to study the effects of the modern dietary, of which an
example is shown in Fig. 20. This Indian and his wife had built their
bodies before the contact with the white man. He is about six feet
tall. Both the parents had splendid dental arches and well formed
faces. His teeth are shown in Fig. 20 (upper, left). Their two children
shown in the photograph were born after the adoption of the white man's
foods brought in by the railroad. Both are mouth-breathers and both
have narrow dental arches and marked underdevelopment of the middle
third of the face. The older girl has tuberculosis. Another adult man
is shown in Fig. 20 (upper, right). He, like the generation he
represents, has exceptionally fine dental arches and well developed
face.</p>

with tuberculosis or crippled with arthritis. Two of these are shown in

<p>    For further comparison of the more isolated and more highly
modernized groups a study was made of the Indians in the largest single
Indian Reservation in Canada, which is located at Brantford, Ontario.
In this group there are about 4,700 Indians living under highly
modernized conditions provided by the Canadian Government. They live on
very fertile land and in close proximity to a modern Canadian city.
Each head of a family is provided with a tract of land from which he
usually has an income sufficient to permit him to have an automobile.
They were able to buy not only necessities and comforts according to
the modern standards of the white man, but many of the luxuries as
well. The government provides a well administered hospital and staff.
When I asked the Director of this hospital, Dr. Davis, what the
principal use of the hospital was at that time (1933), he said that the
demand for beds had completely changed in the twenty-eight years he had
been there. The principal services requested at the hospital in 1933
related to the problems of maternity. He stated that in his period of
contact he had seen three generations of mothers. The grandmothers of
the present generation would take a shawl and either alone or
accompanied by one member of their family retire to the bush and give
birth to the baby and return with it to the cabin. A problem of little
difficulty or concern, it seemed. He stated that today the young
mothers of this last generation are brought to his hospital sometimes
after they have been in labor for days. They are entirely different
from their grandmothers or even mothers in their capacity and
efficiency in the matter of reproduction. He stated that that morning
he had had two cases in which surgical interference was necessary in
order to make birth possible.</p>

<p>    We had an opportunity here to study the effects of
modernization. Indians are great lovers of sports, particularly of
their own national game which is lacrosse. We were able to witness one
of these contests with a team from another reservation. Indian families
came in modern automobiles dressed in modern clothes and purchased pop
and candy and modern confections at typical confection stands. These
were highly modernized Indians.</p>

<p>    The group on this reservation, comprising approximately four
thousand seven hundred Indians, belong to the following tribes:
Mohawks, Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas, Oneidas and Delawares making up
the Six Nation or Iroquois group. A later addition to this group has
been the Tuscaroras from the Carolinas. While there were many mixed
bloods, there were also a goodly number of full-blooded Indian
families, so that there was an opportunity to study comparatively the
effects of intermingling of the Indians with the whites. As in previous
investigations, a special effort was made to study the children from
eight to sixteen years of age. Typical cases were selected from
different environments. For example, boys and girls selected from a
training school called Mohawk Institute, which was near the city of
Brantford, represented one type of environment. There are approximately
one hundred and sixty students under training here, and we were
informed that they study half a day and work half a day. The boys are
taught craftsmanship and farming, the girls, home economics and garment
making, and such practical training as would prepare them for later
home building. While most of the boys and girls come from that
reservation, a few are accepted from other reservations. It is of
interest that 77 per cent of the children in this Institution had
suffered from earlier dental caries and that 17 per cent of all the
teeth examined had already been attacked by dental caries. But this had
occurred apparently before their entrance to the Institute, for we did
not find a single case of active caries among those examined, and this
is particularly important in connection with their excellent nutrition.
The Institute maintained a fine dairy herd and provided fresh
vegetables, whole wheat bread, and limited the sugar and white
flour.</p>

<p>    The children of this group were compared with children of
approximately the same age in a public school of the reservation where
it was found that 90 per cent had had dental caries, and that at
present in 70 per cent of the cases the caries was apparently active.
It is important to note that in this group 28.5 per cent of all the
teeth examined had already been attacked by tooth decay.</p>

<p>    A study was made of patients at the reservation hospital where
free service of all kinds is provided. We found that 83 per cent had
suffered from dental caries, and that 23.2 per cent of all teeth had
already been attacked by caries.</p>

<p>    We were particularly interested in the conditions obtaining in
the homes, especially with the mothers. A typical young mother had
approximately half her teeth attacked by dental caries, as had also her
son, aged seven. The middle third of his face was underdeveloped and
all of his upper anterior teeth were decayed to the gum line.</p>

<p>    A study was made of an Indian reservation in New York State for
comparison and for making an estimate of typical modern American Indian
life with regard to dental caries and nutrition. For this study a band
of 450 in the Tuscarora Reservation northeast of Niagara Falls was
visited. Here again we were fortunate to see the people in holiday mood
since the study was made on Decoration Day and events of the year had
been scheduled, a lacrosse match and a baseball game, between the
Indians' teams and white teams from adjacent towns. Several hundred
Indians were congregated to exhibit their best in wearing apparel,
transportation equipment, and physical prowess. There was evidence of a
similarity of features in the older Indians who had not been highly
modernized, and a striking deficiency in the facial development of many
of the moderns.</p>

<p>    A typical mother was studied at her home. She had four children.
Her teeth were ravaged by dental caries. She was strictly modern, for
she had gold inlays in some of her teeth. The roots of the missing
teeth had not been extracted. Twenty of her teeth had active dental
caries. Her little girl, aged four, already had twelve very badly
carious teeth. Another daughter aged eight had sixteen carious teeth,
and her son aged ten had six. The husband was in bed from an acute lung
involvement, doubtless tuberculosis. The children were eating their
noon day meal when we arrived, which consisted of a white bread and
some stewed vegetables. Milk was available for only the small baby in
arms. In this Tuscarora group 83 per cent of those examined had dental
caries and 38 per cent of all teeth had already been attacked by dental
caries. Every one studied in this reservation was using white-flour
products, none were using milk liberally, and only a few in even
limited amounts. I was told that in both reservations a few years ago
the Indians grew wheat and kept cows to provide a liberal supply of
natural cereal and milk for their families, but of late this practice
had been discontinued. They were now buying their wheat in the form of
white flour and their vegetables largely put up in cans. In both
reservations they were using commercial vegetable fats, jams and
marmalades, sweetened goods, syrups and confections very liberally. It
is remarkable how early the child life adopts modern civilization's
confections.</p>

<p>    In order to provide a further cross section of the modernized
Indians of North America, I made a study in a reservation on Winnipeg
Lake in Manitoba. This reservation lies north and east of Winnipeg and
is quite highly modernized.</p>

<p>    These people were reached with much difficulty because of the
natural protection provided by the location of their reservation at the
mouth of Brokenhead River. They had been provided with fertile lands
and taught modern methods of farming. Their proximity to a great body
of water fairly well-stocked with fish gave them an opportunity to
secure fish, if they were disposed to make the effort to do so, as
their ancestors had done through previous centuries. Their homes were
found to be in a dilapidated condition, and while their lands were
stocked with cattle and horses, such as we found were in poor
condition, and limited in number. The people had been provided with a
government school and a government agent to assist in providing for
their needs and in giving material assistance when needed. They were
within fairly easy distance of hospitals, and had available modern
medical service. Notwithstanding all these advantages, their physical
condition was very poor. Dental caries was so wide-spread that 39.1 per
cent of all teeth studied were found to be affected. They were living
almost entirely on modern foods, imported white flours, jams, canned
vegetables and liberal quantities of sugar. Over 90 per cent of the
individuals had rampant dental caries. Their physical condition and
their supply of necessities was very much lower than was that of either
of the two preceding groups. Distress was evident even in late
summer.</p>

<p>    The Indians so far reported were living inland with access to
inland foods only. The Pacific Coast Indians were examined to determine
the effect of sea foods. To find evidence relating to the physical, and
particularly to the dental condition of the Indians who inhabited the
Pacific slope a thousand or more years ago, a visit was made to the
Vancouver Museum at Vancouver which fortunately possesses splendidly
preserved specimens of prehistoric periods. Some of these skulls were
uncovered while cutting through a hill for a street extension in the
city of Vancouver. Above was a virgin forest of large size green firs
and underneath them in the soil there were preserved fallen trunks of
other large trees. Several feet below these, burials were uncovered
containing skeletons of an early Indian race. This collection contains
also skulls from several places and from prehistoric periods. The teeth
are all splendidly formed and free from dental caries. The arches are
very symmetrical and the teeth in normal and regular position.</p>

<p>    It was important to study the conditions of their successors
living in the same general community. Accordingly, we examined the
teeth and general physical condition of the Indians in a reservation in
North Vancouver, so situated that they have the modern conveniences and
modern foods. In this group of children between eight and fifteen years
of age, 36.9 per cent of all the teeth examined had already been
attacked by dental caries. No people were found in this group who were
living largely on native foods.</p>

<p>    Vancouver Island with its salubrious climate is one of the most
favored places of residence on the Pacific Coast. It was of particular
interest to study the Indians near Victoria on this island in the
Craigflower Indian Reservation. Indeed, the city of Victoria has been
partly built on the original Craigflower Indian Reservation. As the
need became acute for the territory reserved for them, an arrangement
was consummated whereby the Indians were induced to exchange that land
for new land in an adjoining district in which a new house was built
free for each family. Besides a house, an allotment of land and a sum
of money, reported to be ten thousand dollars, was given to each
family. This allowed them to become very modern, and, accordingly, many
of them owned automobiles and other modern luxuries. The physical
effects of the use of food luxuries, resulting from ample funds for
purchasing any foods that they might desire, was marked. They were in
close proximity to skilled dental service and had practical training in
oral prophylaxis. Notwithstanding this, 48.5 per cent of all teeth
examined had already been attacked by dental caries. Every individual
examined was suffering from tooth decay. The original diet of the
Indians of the Pacific Coast was, as we shall see, very largely sea
foods, which are probably as abundant today as ever before. It would
require a real urge to go to catch the fish since they can now be
purchased canned in the open market. Like most modern people, they were
living on white-flour products, sweet foods and pastries.</p>

<p>    Probably few cities of the Pacific Coast have had a greater
abundance and variety of edible sea foods, particularly the various
kinds of salmon, than Ketchikan. It is beautifully located on an
island, and is the most southerly city in Alaska. Among the many fish
that are abundant along this part of the Pacific Coast is the oolachan
or candle fish. It is a small fish, but very rich in oil; so much so
that it gets its name from being burned as a candle for light. This oil
is collected in large quantities and used as a dressing for many of
their sea foods. It is also traded with the Indians of the interior for
furs and other products. An Indian settlement in this city was studied
and it was found that 46.6 per cent of all teeth examined had already
been attacked by tooth decay. In many of the homes individuals were ill
with tuberculosis or arthritis. Tuberculosis had robbed many of the
homes of one or more of its children.</p>

<p>    At Juneau, the capital of Alaska, two groups were studied; one
in the government hospital, and the other in an Indian settlement. In
the hospital were both Indians and Eskimos, chiefly the former.
Seventy-five per cent of the patients were reported to have been
brought because they had tuberculosis, and some who had come because of
accident and other conditions were reported to have tuberculosis also.
Approximately 50 per cent of the total hospital enrollment was under 21
years of age. The dental conditions were bad, for 39.1 per cent of all
the teeth examined had been attacked by tooth decay.</p>

<p>    In the Indian settlement, a group of elderly primitives was
found, every one of whom had complete dentitions in normal arrangement
of the arches and without dental caries. In a settlement of modern
Indians living principally on modern foods 40 per cent of all teeth had
been attacked by tooth decay.</p>

<p>    At Sitka, the former capital, two important groups were studied.
Located here is the Sheldon Jackson School for Eskimos and Indian boys
and girls, chiefly Indians. They have come from widely scatterd
territory throughout Alaska, and represent the finest physical
specimens that can readily be secured for giving the advantages of an
education. Of necessity they came very largely from the modernized
districts. In this group 53.7 per cent of all the teeth examined had
already been attacked by tooth decay. This gives an indication of the
dental conditions in the large number of modernized districts which
they represented.</p>

<p>    In a settlement at Sitka, a group of Indians of various ages
were studied, and it was found that 35.6 per cent of all their teeth
had already been attacked by dental caries. A well preserved native
Indian, seventy years of age, was found who had come into town from
another district. He stated that his diet had consisted chiefly of
fish, fish eggs, seaweed and deer. His teeth were of very high
excellence and were entirely free from past or present dental caries.
He is a splendid example of the product of the native dietary provided
for the Pacific Coast people of any period or stage of
civilization.</p>

<p>    The local physician at Sitka kindly gave very valuable
information relative to the attitude of the native Indians in the
matter of obtaining fresh sea foods when foods that were very
satisfying could be so easily obtained in concentrated form at the
various stores. They could go to one of the piers at almost any time of
the year and catch fish or secure them as they had been accustomed to
do before the arrival of modern foods, but there is a constant striving
to be like and live like the white people. They seem to think it is a
mark of distinction to purchase their foods and that it is degrading to
have to forage for one's foods. They very readily come to depend on
white flour and sugar, jams and canned vegetables; and much prefer to
have the government or charitable organization supply these when they
cannot purchase them, rather than go out and secure their own
nutrition. This physician stated that there were about 800 whites
living in the town and about 400 Indians, and that notwithstanding this
difference in numbers there were twice as many Indian children born as
white children, but that by the time these children reached six years
of age there were more white children living than Indian and half-breed
children. This he stated was largely due to the very high child
mortality rate, of which the most frequent cause is tuberculosis. While
it does not take many decades to record a distinct physical
deterioration, a deteriorating parenthood greatly speeds up this
process. While physical defects acquired by the parent will not be
transmitted as such, prenatal deficiencies may be established because
of the physical defects of the mother resulting from her faulty
nutrition, and these deficiencies, together with disturbed nutrition of
infancy and early childhood will go far in determining whether there
will be for the child a physical breakdown or whether the normal
defense of the body will be adequate to protect it from various
infections to which it may later be exposed.</p>

<p>    Sitka has furnished the longest history of contact with white
men of almost any community on the Pacific Coast. Indeed, it was a
famous seaport long before any United States Pacific Coast communities
had been established. It is of much interest that it was a shipbuilding
center for vessels in the Russian trade. Its foundries were developed
so efficiently that the bells of the early monasteries of California
were cast in this town by the Russians. It contains some of the best
examples of the early Russian architecture, particularly in its
cathedral.</p>

<p>    Anchorage is the principal city of western Alaska, since it is
not only a base for the railroad running north to Fairbanks, but a base
for aeroplane companies operating throughout various parts of Alaska.
It is accordingly a combination of a coast city with its retail
activities and a wholesale base for outfitters for the interior. It has
an excellent government hospital which probably has been built around
the life of one man whom many people told us was the most beloved man
in all Alaska. He is Dr. Josef Romig, a surgeon of great skill and with
an experience among the Eskimos and Indians, both the primitives and
modernized, extending over thirty-six years. I am deeply indebted to
him for much information and for assistance in making contacts. He took
me, for example, to several typically modernized Indian homes in the
city. In one, the grandmother, who had come from the northern shore of
Cook Inlet to visit her daughter, was sixty-three years of age, and was
entirely free from tooth decay and had lost only one of her teeth. Her
son, who had accompanied her, was twenty-four years of age. He had only
one tooth that had ever been attacked by tooth decay. Their diet had
been principally moose and deer meat, fresh and dried fish, a few
vegetables and at time some cranberries. Recently the son had been
obtaining some modern foods. Her daughter, twenty-nine years of age,
had married a white man and had had eight children. She and they were
living on modern foods entirely. Twenty-one of her thirty-two teeth had
been wrecked by dental caries. Their diet consisted largely of white
bread, syrup and potatoes. Her children whom we examined ranged from
five to twelve years of age, and in that family 37 per cent of all the
teeth have already been attacked by dental caries, notwithstanding the
young age of the children. The mother of this family is shown in Fig.
18 (upper, left). It is of great importance that not only was dental
caries rampant, but that there were marked deformity of the dental
arches and irregularity of teeth in the cases of the children.</p>

<p>    Among the many items of information of great interest furnished
by Dr. Romig were facts that fitted well into the modern picture of
association of modern degenerative processes with modernization. He
stated that in his thirty-six years of contact with these people he had
never seen a case of malignant disease among the truly primitive
Eskimos and Indians, although it frequently occurs when they become
modernized. He found similarly that the acute surgical problems
requiring operation on internal organs such as the gall bladder,
kidney, stomach, and appendix do not tend to occur among the primitive,
but are very common problems among the modernized Eskimos and Indians.
Growing out of his experience, in which he had seen large numbers of
the modernized Eskimos and Indians attacked with tuberculosis, which
tended to be progressive and ultimately fatal as long as the patients
stayed under modernized living conditions, he now sends them back when
possible to primitive conditions and to a primitive diet, under which
the death rate is very much lower than under modernized conditions.
Indeed, he reported that a great majority of the afflicted recover
under the primitive type of living and nutrition.</p>

<p>    The institutions that have been organized for the care of
orphans and for the education of Eskimo and Indian boys and girls
provide an opportunity to study conditions. A particularly favorable
institution is located at Eklutna on the railroad north of Anchorage.
Many of the individuals in the school had come from districts so remote
from transportation facilities that their isolation had compelled them
to live mostly on native foods, at least during their early childhood.
They had come from districts very widely distributed throughout the
Alaskan peninsula. Credit is due to the management of this institution
for preparing and storing dried salmon for use throughout the winter.
The beneficial effects of their good nutritional program were evident.
The percentage of teeth attacked by dental caries was 14.6. A large
percentage of these pupils were of mixed blood of native Eskimos or
Indians with whites. The white parent had probably been largely
responsible for their attendance at this training school. There were
several full-blooded Eskimos and Indians from modernized communities
where they had been living on modern foods throughout their entire
lifetime. This gave an opportunity to study the r&ocirc;le of
nutritional deficiencies in the development of deformities and
irregularities in the facial features, in the arrangement of the teeth,
and in the inter-relationship between the dental arches. The typical
irregularities and divergencies from normal were present in the
full-blooded Eskimo and Indian boys and girls in as high percentage as
in the mixed bloods. Some of the young people with parentage of mixed
blood have beautiful features.</p>

<p>    Another important institutional group was studied at Seward in
the Jesse Lee Home which had first been established at Nome and had
been moved to Seward to avoid the extreme isolation of that district.
This institution is located at Resurrection Bay which is one of the
most beautiful harbors in the world. It gives shelter and educational
opportunities to Eskimos and Indians, chiefly of mixed blood, from a
large area of Alaska, and particularly from the Aleutian Peninsula, the
Aleutian Islands and the Bering Sea. These individuals, whether of
mixed or pure blood, had come chiefly from homes that were in large
part modernized. The incidence of dental caries found here was 27.5 per
cent for all teeth examined. Here again all individuals were affected.
Notwithstanding the unusually fine hygienic conditions and highly
trained dietitians of this institution, a medical ward and trained
nurses, tuberculosis was reaping a heavy toll. I was told that 60 per
cent of all those students who had moved with the school from Nome to
this location were already dead from tuberculosis. It is common
knowledge that tuberculosis has played a very important r&ocirc;le in
decimating the Indian and Eskimo population in the Pacific Coast towns
and villages. A very important phase of these investigations is the
development of new light on the r&ocirc;le of nutrition in lowering the
defense of these individuals so that with their low inheritance of
defensive factors they rapidly become susceptible to tuberculosis.</p>

<p>    The problem of evaluating the influence of a particular
environment on racial and tribal development is relatively simple when
studying contemporary remnants of primitive racial stocks. However,
groups that have lived and disappeared in the past do not permit of so
simple a procedure for making physical estimates. Fortunately, we have
in the burial grounds not only the skeletons, but also many of the
implements used in daily life. Sometimes these contain samples of the
foods. We may find also their art ware and hunting equipment. While the
period may not be definitely recorded, the knowledge of the history of
the pottery of the tribe often gives an important clue to the dates as
will also the method of burial. Burials made before the advent of the
Christian era will in many groups show the bodies in a flexed position
with the arms in the lap, whereas in the Christian burials the bodies
have been laid prone and the arms crossed on the chest. By this sign
the pre-Columbian burials can readily be separated from the
post-Columbian.</p>

<p>    Using these guides, a study of the Indians of Florida, past and
present, permits of comparing the pre-Columbians with those living
today in that same territory. We will, accordingly, consider the dental
caries problem and that of facial and dental arch form in the Florida
Indians by comparing three groups: namely, the pre-Columbian, as
evidenced from a study of the skull material in the museums; the tribes
of Indians living in as much isolation as is possible in the Everglades
and Cypress Swamps; and the Indians of the same stock that are living
in contact with the foods of modern civilization. This latter group
lives along the Tamiami trail and near Miami. In a study of several
hundred skulls taken from the burial mounds of southern Florida, the
incidence of tooth decay was so low as to constitute an immunity of
apparently one hundred per cent, since in several hundred skulls not a
single tooth was found to have been attacked by tooth decay. Dental
arch deformity and the typical change in facial form due to an
inadequate nutrition were also completely absent, all dental arches
having a form and interdental relationship such as to bring them into
the classification of normal. These are illustrated in Figs. 22 and 23.
The problem of reaching the isolated groups living in the depth of the
Cypress Swamps was complicated by the fact that these people had a
dread of all whites growing out of their belief that they had been
grossly taken advantage of in some of their early efforts to make a
treaty with the whites. With the assistance of three guides, one, an
Indian of their own group, another, a white man whom they trusted, and
the third, a government nurse who had been very helpful in case of
sickness, we were able to take the desired measurements and records and
photographs. A group of these more primitive representatives is shown
in Fig. 24. While their hunting territory had been grossly encroached
upon by the white hunters, they were still able to maintain a very high
degree of physical excellence and high immunity to dental caries. Only
four teeth in each hundred examined were found to have been attacked by
tooth decay.</p>

<p>   Practically all of the dental arches were normal in contour with
freedom from facial distortion. In contrast with this, the Indians of
Florida who are living today in contact with modern civilization
present a pathetic picture. Forty out of every hundred teeth examined
were found to have been attacked by tooth decay, typically illustrated
in Fig. 25. In the latest generation, many dental arches showed a
typical deformation with crowding of the teeth and narrowing of the
face, conditions that have been found in all human stocks when on an
inadequate nutrition during the formative and early growth period. A
group of these is typically illustrated in Fig. 26.</p>

<p>    It is of interest that the quality of the skeletal material that

<p>    For the study of a group of Indians now living in a high western
state, Albuquerque, New Mexico, was visited.</p>

<p>    Several other Indian studies have been made including studies of
living groups, recently opened burials and museum collections, all of
which support the findings recorded here. I am indebted to the
directors and to the staffs of these institutions for their
assistance.</p>

<p>    Notwithstanding the wide range of physical and climatic
conditions under which primitive Indians had been living, their
incidence of tooth decay while on their native foods was always near
zero; whereas, the modernized Indians of these groups showed very high
incidence of dental caries. A summary of percentages follows:
<i>Primitive Indians:</i> Pelly Mountain, 0.16 per cent; Juneau, 0.00
per cent; Florida Pre-Columbian, 0.00 per cent; Florida Seminoles, 4.0
per cent. <i>Modernized Indians:</i> Telegraph Creek, 25.5 per cent;
Alaska Frontier, 40.0 per cent; Mohawk Institute, 17 per cent;
Brantford Reservation Public School, 28.5 per cent; Brantford
Reservation Hospital, 23.2 per cent, Tuscarora Reservation, 38.0 per
cent; Winnipeg Lake Reservation, 39.1 per cent; North Vancouver
Reservation, 36.9 per cent; Craigflower Indian Reservation, 48.5 per
cent; Ketchikan, 46.6 per cent; Juneau Hospital, 39.1 per cent; Sheldon
Jackson School, 53.7 per cent; Sitka, 35.6 per cent; Eklutna, 14.6 per
cent; Jessie Lee Home, Seward, 27.6 per cent, and Florida Seminoles,
40.0 per cent.</p>

<p>    The foods used by the primitives varies according to location
and climate. The foods of the modernized groups in all cases were the
typical white man's foods of commerce.</p>

<p>    While the primitive groups constantly presented well-formed
faces and dental arches reproducing the tribal pattern, the new
generation, after the adoption of white man's foods, showed marked
changes in facial and dental arch form.</p>

<p>    The Indians like several primitive races I have studied are
aware of the fact that their degeneration is in some way brought about
by their contact with the white man. The dislike of the American Indian
for the modern white civilization has been emphasized by many writers.
In my studies among the Seminole Indians of Florida I found great
difficulty in communicating with or making examination of the isolated
Seminoles living deep in the Everglades and Cypress Swamp. Fortunately,
I had the able assistance of one of their own tribe, a government nurse
who had been very helpful to them and also a white man who had
befriended them and whom they trusted. With their assistance I was able
to carry out very detailed studies. It was of interest, however, that
when we arrived at a settlement in the bush we practically always found
it uninhabited. Our Indian guide would go into the surrounding scrub
and call to the people assuring them it was to their advantage to come
out, which they finally did. I was told that this attitude had grown
out of the belief on their part that their treaties had been violated.
These isolated Seminole Indian women had the reputation of turning
their backs on all white men.</p>

<p>    A United States Press report <font size="-2">(1)</font> provides
an article with the heading <i>"Tribes 'Fed Up' Seek Solitude, Indians
Dislike Civilization, Ask Land Barred to White Men."</i> The article
continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    The Bureau of Indian Affairs revealed today that
five Indian tribes in Oklahoma are "fed up" with white civilization and
want new, secluded tribal lands.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    So widespread is the discontent among the
100,000 Indians living in Oklahoma, officials said, that serious study
is being given to the possibility of providing new lands where the
redman may hunt and fish as his ancestors did.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Dissatisfaction has been brewing for a long time
as a result of an increasing Indian population, decreasing Indian lands
and unsatisfactory economic conditions. It was brought officially to
the notice of bureau officials several days ago when a delegation,
headed by Jack Gouge, a Creek Indian from Hanna, Okla., told Indian
Commissioner John Collier that most of the Oklahoma Indians wanted new
tribal lands away from white civilization.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">   So anxious are his people to escape from the
white man and his influences, Jack Gouge said, that an organization of
about 1000 Indians has been formed to press the demands. It is known as
the "Four Mothers," apparently representing four of the "civilized
tribes"--the Creeks, Choctaws, Cherokees and Chickasaws.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    The fifth civilized tribe, the Seminoles of
Oklahoma, are negotiating with the Mexican government for tribal lands
in that country.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    These tribes are described as "civilized"
because of the high degree of culture they attained in their original
tribal lands along the eastern coast. As their eastern lands became
valuable the Indians were moved to the area which is now Oklahoma. At
the turn of the century, however, with the discovery of oil there the
new tribal lands were broken up. The Indians were forcibly removed to
small tracts despite their desire to remain together. Indian Bureau
officials do not conceal their bitterness over the white man's
"treachery." One official pointed out that about 300 treaties have been
signed with the Indians and that practically every one has been
violated.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    It will be most fortunate if in the interest of science and
human betterment such a program as this will be carried out in order to
permit these Indians to live in accordance with the accumulated wisdom
of their various tribes. Their preservation in isolation would preserve
their culture. The greatest heritage of the white man today is the
accumulated wisdom of the human race.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED
MELANESIANS</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">S</font>INCE our quest was to gather data that will
throw light upon the cause of modern physical degeneration among human
racial stocks in various parts of the world, it became necessary to
include for study various groups living in the hot sultry climates of
the tropics. Again it was desirable to obtain contact with both highly
isolated and, therefore, relatively primitive stocks for comparison
with modernized groups of the same stock. In order to accomplish this
an expedition was made in 1934 to eight archipelagos of the Southern
Pacific to study groups of Melanesians and Polynesians. The Melanesians
described here were living in New Caledonia and the Fiji Islands.</p>

<p>    If the causative factors for the physical degeneration of
mankind are practically the same everywhere, it should be possible to
find a common cause operating, regardless of climate, race, or
environment.</p>

<p>    Owing to the vast extent of the Pacific waters and the limited
number of transportation lines, it became very difficult to arrange a
convenient itinerary. This, however, was finally accomplished
satisfactorily by going southward through the more easterly
archipelagos; namely, the Marquesas Islands, Society Islands and Cook
Islands, then westward to the Tongan Islands in the southern central
Pacific near New Zealand, and then westward to New Caledonia near
Australia. From this group we went northward to the Fiji Islands, also
in the western Pacific, then to the Samoan Islands in the central
Pacific south of the equator, and then to the Hawaiian Islands north of
the equator. These island groups were all populated by different racial
stocks speaking different languages. The movements from archipelago to
archipelago were made on the larger ships, and between the islands of
the group in small crafts, except in the Hawaiian Islands where an
aeroplane was used.</p>

<p>    The program in each group consisted in making contact with local
guides and interpreters. They had generally been arranged for in
advance by correspondence with government officials. By these means we
were able to reach isolated groups in locations quite distant from
contact with trade or merchant ships. To reach these isolated groups
often required going over rough and difficult trails since most of the
islands being of volcanic formation are mountainous.</p>

<p>    On reaching the isolated groups our greetings and the purpose of
the mission were conveyed by our interpreters to the chiefs. Much time
was often lost in going through necessary ceremonials and feasting. In
every instance we received a very cordial reception and excellent
cooperation. In no instance was there antagonism. Through the
underground telegraph they always seemed to know we were coming and had
prepared for us. When these formalities were once over and our wishes
made known, the chiefs instructed the members of their tribes to carry
out our program for making examinations, recording personal data,
making photographs, and collecting samples of foods for chemical
analysis. The food samples were either dried or preserved in
formalin.</p>

<p>    The detailed records for every individual included data on the
tribe, village and family, his age, previous residence, physical
development, the kinds of foods eaten, the physical condition of every
tooth, including presence or absence of cavities; the shape of the
dental arches; the shape and development of the face; and detailed
notes on divergencies from racial type. Special physical
characteristics were photographed. A comparsion was made of these
factors for each of the more isolated members of the same tribe and
those in the vicinity of the port or landing place of the island.
Through the government officials detailed information was secured,
usually in the form of the annual government statistical reports,
showing the kind and quantity of the various ingredients and articles
that were imported, and similarly those that were exported. Contact was
made in each island group with the health officers, and the studies
were usually made with their assistance. In many instances the only
contact with civilization had consisted of the call of a small trading
ship once or twice a year to gather up the copra or dried coconut, sea
shells and such other products as the natives had accumulated for
exchange. Payment for these products was usually made in trade goods
and not in money. The following articles consisted nearly always of 90
per cent of the total value: white flour and sugar. Ten per cent
consisted of wearing apparel or material for that apparel.</p>

<p>    While the missionaries have encouraged the people to adopt
habits of modern civilization, in the isolated districts the tribes
were not able to depart much from their native foods because of the
infrequency of the call of the trader ship. Effort had been made in
almost all of the islands to induce the natives to cover their bodies,
especially when in sight of strangers. In several islands regulatory
measures had been adopted requiring the covering of the body. This
regulation had greatly reduced the primitive practice of coating the
surface of the body with coconut oil, which had the effect of absorbing
the ultra-violet rays thus preventing injury from the tropical sun.
This coating of oil enabled them to shed the rain which was frequently
torrential though of short duration. The irradiation of the coconut oil
was considered by the natives to provide, in addition, an important
source of nutrition. Their newly acquired wet garments became a serious
menace to the comfort and health of the wearers.</p>

<p>    The early navigators who visited these South Sea Islands
reported the people as being exceedingly strong, vigorously built,
beautiful in body and kindly disposed. There were formerly dense
populations on most of the inhabitable islands. In contrast with this,
one now finds that on many of the islands the death rate has come to so
far exceed the birth rate that the very existence of these racial
groups is often seriously threatened.</p>

<p>    The Island of New Caledonia is one of the largest of the
Pacific. It is situated in the vicinity of 23 degrees south latitude
and 165 degrees east longitude. The New Caledonians are pure Melanesian
stock. They are broad shouldererd, very muscular and in the past have
been very warlike. These Islands are under French control. The foreign
population is chiefly French, and limited mainly to the vicinity of the
one port of Noumea. The subjugation of these people has been very
difficult and as recently as 1917 a band from the interior in protest
against efforts to establish a white colony and sugar plantation on a
desirable section of coastal land swept down on the French colony in
the night and massacred almost the entire population. Their contact
with the required foods from the sea had been cut off. They believe
they require sea foods to maintain life and physical efficiency. The
physical development of the primitive people including their teeth and
dental arches is of very high order. A comparison of the individuals
living near the ports with those living in the isolated inland
locations shows marked increase in the incidence of dental caries. For
those living almost exclusively on the native foods the incidence of
dental caries was only 0.14 per cent; while for those using trade foods
the incidence of dental caries was 26 per cent. The splendid facial and
dental arch development of these quite primitive Caledonians is shown
in Fig. 28. Note also their kinky hair and strong neck and face
muscles.</p>

<p>    The Fiji Island group lies between 15 and 22 degrees south
latitude and between 177 degrees west and 175 degrees east longitude,
thus straddling the international date line. The Fiji Islanders are
similar in physical development and appearance to the New Caledonians,
and like them are largely, if not wholly, Melanesian in racial origin.
The men have kinky hair and broad shoulders. In the past, they have
been excellent warriors. They are not as tall as their hereditary
enemies, the Tongans, to the east, and in order to make themselves look
equally tall, they have adopted the practice of training their kinky
hair straight out from the head to a height often reaching six or more
inches. Typical facial and dental arch forms are shown in Fig. 29. They
are British subjects, and where they have had supervision, in the
districts near the ports and on those islands on which sugar
plantations have been established, they have suffered very greatly from
the degenerative diseases.</p>

<p>    Since Viti Levu, one of the islands of this group, is one of the
larger islands of the Pacific Ocean, I had hoped to find on it a
district far enough from the sea to make it necessary for the natives
to have lived entirely on land foods. Accordingly, with the assistance
of the government officials and by using a recently opened government
road I was able to get well into the interior of the island by motor
vehicle, and from this point to proceed farther inland on foot with two
guides. I was not able, however, to get beyond the piles of sea shells
which had been carried into the interior. My guide told me that it had
always been essential, as it is today, for the people of the interior
to obtain some food from the sea, and that even during the times of
most bitter warfare between the inland or hill tribes and the coast
tribes, those of the interior would bring down during the night choice
plant foods from the mountain areas and place them in caches and return
the following night and obtain the sea foods that had been placed in
those depositories by the shore tribes. The individuals who carried
these foods were never molested, not even during active warfare. He
told me further that they require food from the sea at least every
three months, even to this day. This was a matter of keen interest, and
at the same time disappointment since one of the purposes of the
expedition to the South Seas was to find, if possible, plants or fruits
which together, without the use of animal products, were capable of
providing all of the requirements of the body for growth and for
maintenance of good health and a high state of physical efficiency.
Among the sources of animal foods was the wild pig from the bush. These
were not native, but imported into nearly all of the islands, and they
have become wild where there is an abundance of food for them. Another
animal food was that from coconut crabs which grow to a weight of
several pounds. At certain seasons of the year the crabs migrate to the
sea in great numbers from the mountains and interior country. They
spend about three days in the sea for part of their reproductive
program and return later to their mountain habitats. Their routes of
travel are as nearly as possible in straight lines. At the season of
migration, large numbers of the crabs are captured for food. These
crabs rob the coconut trees of fruit. They climb the trees during the
darkness and return to the ground before the dawn. They cut off the
coconuts and allow them to drop to the ground. When the natives hear
coconuts dropping in the night they put a girdle of grass around the
tree fifteen or twenty feet from the ground, and when the crabs back
down and touch the grass they think that they are down on the ground,
let go their hold and are stunned by the fall. The natives then collect
the crabs and put them in a pen where they are fed on shredded coconut.
In two weeks' time the crabs are so fat that they burst their shells.
They are then very delicious eating. Fresh water fish of various kinds
are used where available from the mountain streams. Land animal foods,
however, are not abundant in the mountainous interior, and no places
were found where the native plant foods were not supplemented by sea
foods.</p>

<p align="center">    Our first visit to the Fiji Islands was in 1934,
and the second in 1936. On our first trip we had much personal
assistance from Ratu Popi, hereditary king. His residence was on the
royal island reserved exclusively for the king and his retinue. His
picture is shown in Fig. 30 with that of Mrs. Price. He was very
solicitous for the welfare of his people whom he recognized to be
rapidly breaking down with modernization. The council house is also
shown in Fig. 30. He gave us very important information regarding the
origin of cannibalism, relating it to a recognition of special food
values of special organs, particularly the livers.</p>

<p>    There has been a very extensive development of sugar plantations
on the larger islands of several of the Pacific archipelagos. The
working of these plantations has required the importation of large
numbers of indentured laborers. These have been brought chiefly from
India and China. Since they are nearly all men, those who have married
have obtained their wives from among the natives. This, the Chinese
have done quite frequently. Since they are excellent workers they
provide good homes and are good business men. They are, in many
districts, rapidly becoming the landowners and are men of influence.
This influx of Asiatics, together with that of Europeans, has had an
important influence upon the purity of the native race around the ports
and provided an opportunity to study the effect of intermingling of
races upon the susceptibility to dental caries. No differences in
extent of tooth decay due to ancestry were disclosed. The incidence of
dental caries at the points of contact with imported foods was 30.1 per
cent of teeth examined as compared with 0.42 for the more isolated
groups living on the native foods of land and sea.</p>

<p>    The physical changes which were found associated with the use of
the imported foods included the loss of immunity to dental caries in
practically all of the individuals who had displaced their native foods
very largely with the modern foods. Dental caries was much worse,
however, in the growing children and motherhood group due to the
special demands of these individuals. These conditions are illustrated
in Figs. 31 and 32. The boy shown in Fig. 32 (upper, left) typifies the
suffering brought by modernization. Abscessed teeth often cause
suicide.</p>

<p>    Another important phase of the studies included a critical
examination of the facial form and shape of the dental arches which
include very definite and typical changes represented by the narrowing
of the features and the lengthening of the face with crowding of the
teeth in the arch. These are illustrated in the lower half of Fig.
32.</p>

<p>    The members of the Melanesian race living on the Fiji Islands of
the Pacific, whether volcanic or coral in origin, have developed a very
high immunity to dental caries and well formed faces and dental arches.
Their native foods consisted of animal life from the sea eaten with
plants and fruits from the land in accordance with a definite program
of food selection. In their primitive state only 0.42 per cent of their
teeth were attacked by tooth decay. In the modernized groups this
incidence increased to 30.1 per cent. The change in the nutrition
included a marked reduction in the native foods and their displacement
with white-flour products, sugar and sweetened goods, canned foods and
polished rice. In the succeeding generations after the parents had
adopted the modern foods, there occurred distinct change in facial form
and shape of the dental arches.</p>

POLYNESIANS</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">T</font>HE characteristics of the Polynesian race
included straight hair, oval features, happy, buoyant dispositions and
splendid physiques. When the Pacific Islands were discovered the
Polynesians were found inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands, the Marquesas
Islands, the Tuamotu group including Tahiti, the Cook Islands, the
Tongan Islands and the Samoan group.</p>

<p>    The first group studied was made up of the people of the
Marquesas Islands which are situated 9 degrees south latitude and 140
degrees west longitude, about 4,000 miles due west of Peru. Few, if
any, of the primitive racial stocks of the South Sea Islands were so
enthusiastically extolled for their beauty and excellence of physical
development by the early navigators. Much tooth decay prevails today.
They reported the Marquesans as vivacious, happy people numbering over
a hundred thousand on the seven principal islands of this group.
Probably in few places in the world can so distressing a picture be
seen today as is found there. A French government official told me that
the native population had decreased to about two thousand, chiefly as a
result of the ravages of tuberculosis. Serious epidemics of small-pox
and measles have at times taken a heavy toll. In a group of
approximately one hundred adults and children I counted ten who were
emaciated and coughing with typical signs of tuberculosis. Many were
waiting for treatment at a dispensary eight hours before the hour it
opened. In the past some of the natives have had splendid physiques,
fine countenances, and some of the women have had beautiful features.
They are now a sick and dying primitive group. A trader ship was in
port exchanging white flour and sugar for their copra. They have
largely ceased to depend on the sea for food. Tooth decay was rampant.
At the time of the examination, 36.9 per cent of the teeth of the
people using trade food in conjunction with the land plants and fruits
had been attacked by tooth decay. The individuals living entirely on
native foods were few. Some early navigators were so highly impressed
with the beauty and health of these people that they reported the
Marquesas Islands as the Garden of Eden. Tahiti is the principal island
of the Society group. It is situated 17 degrees south of the equator,
149 degrees west longitude. Fortunately degeneration has not been so
rapid nor so severe here. The Tahitian population, however, has reduced
from over two hundred thousand as early estimated, to a present native
population estimated at about ten thousand. These islands are also a
part of French Oceania. Many of the able bodied men were taken from
these French Islands to France to fight in the World War. Only a small
percentage, however, returned, and they were mostly crippled and
maimed. The Tahitians are a buoyant, light-hearted race, fully
conscious, however, of their rapid decline in numbers and health. Many
of the more primitive are very fine looking and have excellent dental
arches, as seen in Fig. 33.</p>

<p>    The capital of Tahiti, Papeete, is the administrative center for
the French Pacific possessions. It has a large foreign population, and
there is considerable commerce in and out of this port. Much imported
food is used. Like on the Marquesas Islands, it was difficult to find
large numbers of individuals living entirely on the native foods. Those
that were found had complete immunity to dental caries. For the natives
living in part on trade foods, chiefly white flour, sugar and canned
goods, 31.9 per cent of the teeth were found to be attacked by tooth
decay. Typical extensive destruction of the teeth amongst the
modernized Tahitians is shown in Fig. 34. There is a large colony of
Chinese in Tahiti, brought there as indentured laborers. They have not
returned. When the Tahitian men did not return from the war, their
wives married the Chinese, who are good workers.</p>

<p>    The Cook Islands are British and under the direct guidance of
the New Zealand Government. Rarotonga is the principal island. It is
situated in the Pacific Ocean in the vicinity of 21 degrees south
latitude and 160 degrees west longitude. It has a delightful climate
the year around. Racially according to legend, the Maori tribe, the
native tribe of New Zealand, migrated there from the Cook Islands. In
addition to being similar in physical development and appearance, their
languages are sufficiently similar so that each can understand the
other, even though their separation occurred probably over a thousand
years ago.</p>

<p>    It is a matter of great importance that the inhabitants of these
South Sea Islands were skillful navigators and boat builders. It was a
common occurrence for expeditions both peaceful and aggressive to make
journeys of one and two thousand miles in crafts propelled by man power
and wind and carrying in addition an adequate supply of water and food
for their journey.</p>

<p>    A large number were found in Rarotonga living almost entirely on
native foods, and only 0.3 per cent of the teeth of these individuals
have been attacked by dental caries. In the vicinity of Avarua, the
principal port, however, the natives were living largely on trade
foods, and among these 29.5 per cent of the teeth were found to have
been attacked by dental caries. In Fig. 35 (top) are seen typically
fine faces and teeth. However at the lower left is shown a child at the
port whose parents were living on the imported food. This boy's upper
lateral teeth are erupting inside the arch. In the lower right is a

<p>    Under British guidance the Cook Islanders have much better
health than the Marquesans or the Tahitians. Their population is not
seriously decreasing, and is untroubled except for the progressive
development of the degenerative diseases around the port. They are
thrifty and happy, and are rapidly developing a local culture including
a school system supported by natives.</p>

<p>    The inhabitants of the Tongan Islands, the principal of which is
Tongatabu, are Polynesian. This group, containing over 100 islands, is
situated between 18 and 22 degrees south latitude and between 173 and
176 degrees west longitude, and has a native population of about
28,000. They have the distinction of being one of the last absolute
monarchies of the world. While they are under the protection of Great
Britain, they largely manage their own affairs. Their isolation is
nearly complete except for a call from an infrequent trader. They seem
to be credited by the inhabitants of the other islands as being the
greatest warriors of the Pacific. The Tongans at least acknowledge that
they are the greatest warriors, and indeed the greatest people of the
world. They will not step aside to allow anyone to pass since they say
that when the world was created and populated they were the first to be
made, next was the pig, and last the white man. Ethnologically, they
are said to be a mixture of the darker Melanesians with their kinky
hair, and the fairer Polynesians of the eastern archipelagos with
straight hair. It is said they have never been defeated in battle. For
centuries they and the Fijian tribes 700 miles to the west have
frequently been at war. The British government has very skillfully
directed this racial rivalry into athletics. While we were in the Fiji
Islands the British government provided a battle cruiser to carry the
football team from Fiji to Nukualofa for the annual contest of
strength.</p>

<p>    These islanders have practiced eugenics by selecting tall strong
mates. The queen of the islands was six feet three inches in
height.</p>

<p>    The limited importation of foods to the Tongan Islands due to
the infrequent call of merchant or trading ships has required the
people to remain largely on their native foods. Following the war,
however, the price of copra went up from $40.00 per ton to $400.00,
which brought trading ships with white flour and sugar to exchange for
the copra. The effect of this is shown very clearly in the condition of
the teeth. The incidence of dental caries among the isolated groups
living on native foods was 0.6 per cent, while for those around the
port living in part on trade foods, it is 33.4 per cent. The effect of
the imported food was clearly to be seen on the teeth of the people who
were in the growth stage at that time. Now the trader ships no longer
call and this forced isolation is very clearly a blessing in disguise.
Dental caries has largely ceased to be active since imported foods
became scarce, for the price of copra fell to $4.00 a ton. The
temporary rise in tooth decay was apparently directly associated with
the calling of trader ships.</p>

<p>    The Samoan Islands are located in the vicinity of 14 degrees
south latitude and between 166 and 174 degrees west longitude. The
native population of the Samoan Islands is Polynesian. The control of
the Islands is divided between two governments. The eastern group is
American. The western group is British since the World War, before
which it was under German control. The western group is now under a
mandate to New Zealand. Through the kindness of the Governor and Naval
Officers of American Samoa transportation was provided on an auxiliary
craft to the various islands of the American Samoan group. We were
particularly indebted to Commander Stephenson, Director of Health,
whose guests we were, for continued personal assistance in making
favorable contacts in nearly all villages of the American Samoan group.
In no islands of the Pacific did we find so excellent an organization
for health service. Dispensaries have been established within reach of
nearly all the villages besides hospital service at Pago Pago, the port
of Tutuila. This is the finest port in the Pacific Ocean.
Notwithstanding the regular monthly contact through merchant ships to
and from America and Australia, many isolated groups were found living
largely on the native foods. A dental survey had recently been made of
this group by Lieutenant Commander Ferguson. <font size=
"-2">(1)</font></p>

<p>   The excellent facial and dental arch development of the Samoans
is illustrated in the upper half of Fig. 36. The change in facial and
dental arch form which follows the use of modern food by the parents is
shown in the lower half of Fig. 36. Note the marked irregularity of the
teeth. This is one of the few groups of islands in which the population
is not rapidly decreasing, indeed there is some increase. The Navy
personnel includes one dentist. Practically all his time is required
for the personnel and families of the Navy at this station.
Accordingly, he can do only a limited amount of emergency service such
as extractions for the natives. About 90 per cent of the inhabitants of
American Samoa are on the largest island, Tutuila, and due to the
development of roads, a considerable number of the people have access
to the main port, to which several of them come on ship days to sell
their wares and to buy provisions to augment their native foods. The
incidence of dental caries among those individuals living in part on
imported foods at the port as compared with those in remote districts
living on native foods was as follows: Those almost exclusively on
native foods had 0.3 per cent of the teeth attacked by dental caries,
and for those on trade foods, 18.7 per cent. Sea foods used here
include many shell fish which are gathered and sold largely by the
young people. The octopus, the sea crab and the beche-de-mere eaten raw
were used.</p>

<p>    The Hawaiian Islands lie between 18 and 22 degrees north
latitude and between 154 and 160 degrees west longitude. These Islands
are quite unlike any of the other Pacific Island groups previously
discussed. Sugar and pineapple plantations cover vast areas and
together constitute by far the most important industries of these
Islands. In many districts the population is almost entirely foreign or
of various blends, chiefly of Filipinos and Japanese with Hawaiians.
There is a large American population and a considerable European. These
different racial groups have largely brought their own customs which
are rapidly submerging the native customs. Since the native population
is so greatly reduced in comparison with the foreign population, and
because intermarrying has been so general, it was difficult to find
large groups of relatively pure-blooded Hawaiians either living almost
entirely on native foods or on modernized foods. Though the number of
the individuals in these groups is accordingly not large, important
data were obtained for comparing the relative incidence of dental
caries and other degenerative processes. While the preparation of foods
on the various Pacific Islands has many common factors, all natives
using the underground oven of hot stones for cooking, the Hawaiian
Islands present one unique difference in the method of preparation of
their taro. They cook the root as do all the other tribes, but having
done so they dry the taro, powder it and mix it with water and allow it
to ferment for several hours, usually twenty-four or more. This
preparation called "poi" becomes slightly tart by the process of
fermentation and has the consistency of heavy strap molasses or a very
heavy cream. It is eaten by rolling it up on one or two fingers and
sucking it from them. It accordingly offers no resistance to the
process of mastication. In the districts where the natives are living
on native foods the incidence of dental caries was only 2 per cent of
the teeth, whereas among those natives who are living in large part on
the imported foods, chiefly white flour and sweetened goods, 37.3 per
cent of the teeth had been attacked by tooth decay. Typical Hawaiian
faces are seen in Fig. 37. Typical modern tooth decay is shown in Fig.
38. This girl has tuberculosis also.</p>

<p>    The study of the incidence of dental caries in these various
South Sea Island groups in its relation to diet was only one of several
of the problems investigated. Since nutrition is the principal factor
that has been found related to the r6le of immunity and susceptibility
to dental caries in my previous field studies, the collection of foods
for chemical analysis and the gathering of detailed data regarding the
articles of diet have been very important phases of the activities of
this group of studies.</p>

<p>    Data were collected for relating the incidence of irregularities
of the teeth and dental arches to the types of nutrition. Similarly,
studies were made of the individuals who had been hospitalized, in the
few places where hospitals existed, chiefly to obtain data regarding
the classification of the individuals who were suffering from
tuberculosis. These were similar to the studies that I have made among
the Eskimos and Indians of Alaska and northern and central Canada.</p>

<p>    If one will picture a community of several thousand people with
an average of 30 per cent of all the teeth attacked by dental caries
and not a single dentist or dental instrument available for assistance
of the entire group, a slight realization is had of the mass suffering
that has to be endured. Commerce and trade for profit blaze the way in
breaking down isolation's barriers, far in advance of the development
of health agencies and emergency relief unwittingly made necessary by
the trade contact.</p>

<p>    While dental caries was most active in the periods of systematic
overloads, such as growth, gestation and lactation, even the splendidly
formed teeth of the adult men were wrecked by dental caries when the
native foods were displaced with modern foods. In all of the groups
living on native foods with a liberal intake of animal life of the sea,
the health of the gums was generally excellent. When, however, the sea
foods were quite limited in the dietary, heavy deposits formed and
often were associated with a marked destruction of the supporting
tissues with gingival infection. This condition was particularly
prevalent among all groups near the ports, when the groups were
displacing part of their native foods with imported foods.</p>

<p>    In American Samoa through the cooperation of the educational
authorities and the Director of the Department of Health, Commander
Stephenson, and under the direct supervision of Lieutenant Commander
Lowry, the dental surgeon, a group of four young men of the native
teaching staff was selected and given instructions for the removal of
the deposits. Equipment in the form of instruments has since been
provided, in part through the kindness and generosity of some dental
manufacturers. This probably constitutes the only native dental service
that has ever been available in any of the Pacific Island groups. The
intelligence and aptness with which these men were able to learn the
fundamental principles, and their skill in carrying out a highly
commendable prophylactic operation was indeed remarkable. I gave them
pieces of soap and asked them to carve a reproduction of an extracted
tooth which was given as a model and in which they were required to
increase all diameters to a given amount. Their work would probably
equal if not exceed in excellence that of the first effort of 90 per
cent of American dental students. Many of these natives are very
dexterous with their fingers and are skilled artists in carving wood
and other material.</p>

<p>    A great service could be rendered to these people who are in the
process of modernization, but who have no opportunity for dental
assistance, by teaching some of the bright young men certain of the
procedures for rendering first aid. They could be compensated by
contributions of native foods and native wares much as our itinerant
dentists were in earlier days. The people would not have money to pay
an American or European dentist for his service until trade is carried
on with currency.</p>

<p>    Nearly all these racial stocks are magnificent singers for which
Nature has well-equipped them physically. Their artistry can be judged
by the fact that they sing very difficult music unaccompanied and
undirected. A large native chorus at Nukualofa, in the Tongan Group,
sang without accompaniment "The Hallelujah Chorus" from Handel's
Messiah with all the parts and with phenominal volume and modulation.
Much of their work, such as rowing their largest boats, and many of
their sports are carried out to the rhythm of hilarious music.</p>

<p>    Many of the island groups recognize that their races are doomed
since they are melting away with degenerative diseases, chiefly
tuberculosis. Their one overwhelming desire is that their race shall
not die out. They know that something serious has happened since they
have been touched by civilization. Surely our civilization is on trial
both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>    The nutrition of the primitive Polynesians is continually
reinforced with animal life from the sea which includes both soft- and
hard-shell forms. The incidence of tooth decay varied from 0.6 per cent
for the most isolated groups to 33.4 per cent for the modernized
groups. Those individuals living in their native environment on their
native foods have universally normal facial and dental arch form
reproducing the characteristics of the race. Those living on the normal
environment except for using the imported foods of white flour, sugar,
sugar products, syrup, polished rice, and the like, have in the
succeeding generations marked changes in facial and dental arch
forms.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED AFRICAN
TRIBES</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">A</font>FRICA has been the last of the large
continents to be invaded and explored by our modern civilization. It
has one of the largest native populations still living in accordance
with inherited traditions. Accordingly, it provides a particularly
favorable field for studying primitive racial stocks.</p>

<p>    This study of primitive racial stocks, with the exception of
some Indian groups, has been largely concerned with people living under
physical conditions quite different from those which obtain in the
central area of a large continent.</p>

<p>    Sea foods are within reach of the inhabitants of islands and
coastal. regions regardless of latitude. The inhabitants of the
interior of a continent, however, have not access to liberal supplies
of various forms of animal life of the sea. It was important,
therefore, in the interest of the inhabitants of the United States,
Canada, Europe, and other large continental interiors, to study
primitive people living under environments similar to theirs. Africa is
one of the few countries that can provide both primitive living
conditions and the modern life of the plains and plateau country in the
interior. The great plateau of eastern and central Africa has nurtured
a score of tribes with superb physiques and much accumulated wisdom. We
are concerned to know how they have accomplished this, and whether they
or any other people can survive in that environment after adopting the
formulas of our modern civilizations. Considering that the most
universal scourge of modern civilization is dental caries, though it is
only one of its many degenerative processes, it is important that we
study these people to note how they have solved the major problems of
living in so severe and disciplining an environment as provided in
Africa.</p>

<p>    This was done during the summer of 1935. Our route took us
through the Red Sea and down the Indian Ocean to enter the African
continent at Mombasa below the equator and then across Kenya and Uganda
into Eastern Belgian Congo, and thence about 4,000 miles down the long
stretch of the Nile through Sudan to the modernized civilization of
Egypt. This journey covered most of the country around Ethiopia and
gave us contact with several of the most primitive racial stocks of
that country. These people are accordingly the neighbors of the
Abyssinians or Ethiopians. Since the various tribes speak different
languages and are under different governments, it was necessary to
organize our safari in connection with the local government officials
in the different districts.</p>

<p>    During these journeys in Africa which covered about 6,000 miles,
we came in contact with about thirty different tribes. Special
attention was given to the foods, samples of which were obtained for
chemical analysis. Over 2,500 negatives were made and developed in the
field. If any one impression of our experiences were to be selected as
particularly vivid, it would be the contrast between the health and
ruggedness of the primitives in general and that of the foreigners who
have entered their country. That their superior ruggedness was not
racial became evident when through contact with modern civilizations
degenerative processes developed. Very few of the many Europeans with
whom we came in contact had lived in central Africa for as much as two
years without serious illness or distinct evidence of physical stress.
That the cause was not the severity of the climate, but something
related to the methods of living, was soon apparent. In all the
districts it was recognized and expected that the foreigners must plan
to spend a portion of every few years or every year outside that
environment if they would keep well. Children born in that country to
Europeans were generally expected to spend several of their growing
years in Europe or America if they would build even relatively normal
bodies.</p>

<p>    One exacting condition of the environment that we encountered
was the constant exposure to disease. Dysentery epidemics were so
severe and frequent that we scarcely allowed ourselves to eat any food
that had not been cooked or that we had not peeled ourselves. In
general, it was necessary to boil all drinking water. We dared not
allow our bare feet to touch a floor of the ground for fear of jiggers
which burrow into the skin of the feet. Scarcely ever when below 6,000
feet were we safe after sundown to step from behind mosquito netting or
to go out without thorough protection against the malaria pests. These
malaria mosquitoes which include many varieties are largely night
feeders. They were thought to come out soon after sundown. We were
advised that the most dangerous places for becoming infected were the
public eating houses, since the mosquitoes hide under the tables and
attack the diner's ankles if they are not adequately protected. We
rigidly followed the precaution of providing adequate protection
against these pests. Disease-carrying ticks were so abundant in the
grass and shrubbery that we had to be on guard constantly to remove
them from our clothing before they buried themselves in our flesh. They
were often carriers of very severe fevers. We had to be most careful
not to touch the hides with which the natives protected their bodies
from the cold at night and from the sun in the daytime without thorough
sterilization following any contact. There was grave danger from the
lice that infected the hair of the hides. We dared not enter several
districts because of the dreaded tsetse fly and the sleeping sickness
it carries. One wonders at the apparent health of the natives until he
learns of the unique immunity they have developed and which is largely
transmitted to the offspring. In several districts we were told that
practically every living native had had typhus fever and was immune,
though the lice from their bodies could transmit the disease. One also
wonders why people with such resistance to disease are not able to
combat the degenerative diseases of modern civilization. When they
adopt modern civilization they then become susceptible to several of
our modern degenerative processes, including tooth decay.</p>

<p>    Dr. Anderson who is in charge of a splendid government hospital
in Kenya, assured me that in several years of service among the
primitive people of that district he had observed that they did not
suffer from appendicitis, gall bladder trouble, cystitis and duodenal
ulcer. Malignancy was also very rare among the primitives.</p>

<p>    It is of great significance that we studied six tribes in which
there appeared to be not a single tooth attacked by dental caries nor a
single malformed dental arch. Several other tribes were found with
nearly complete immunity to dental caries. In thirteen tribes we did
not meet a single individual with irregular teeth. Where the members of
these same tribes had adopted modern civilization many cases of tooth
decay were found. In the next generation following the adoption of the
European dietaries dental arch deformities frequently developed.</p>

<p>    We are concerned to know something of the origin of these people
including the Ethiopians and to what extent racial ancestry has
protected them. If we refer to an ethnographic map of African races we
find there is evidence of a great movement northward from South Africa.
These people had some things in common with the Melanesians and
Polynesians of the South Pacific whom we studied the year previously.
Their language carries some words of similar meaning. While there are
many tribes existing today, it is of significance that they each
possess some identifying characteristics of language, dress and food
habits. Another great racial movement has apparently moved southward
from Northern Africa. These tribes are of Hamitic origin and include
Nilotic tribes and Abyssinians. The Nilotic tribes have a distinct
physical pattern and mode of life. These great racial movements have
met in the Upper Nile region of Eastern Africa near the equator, and
have swayed back and forth with successive obliteration or absorption
of those tribes that were least sturdy. The negro race occupied an area
across Africa from the West to Central Africa. They were exposed to the
aggression and oppression of these two great racial movements,
resulting often in intermingling in various proportions of racial
bloods. The Semitic race, chiefly Arabs, occupied Arabia and a great
area in Northern Africa.</p>

<p>    In this bird's eye view we are observing changes that have been
in progress during many hundreds or thousands of years. The Arabs have
been the principal slave dealers working in from the east coast of
Africa. They have maintained their individuality without much blending
except on the coast. They have not become an important part of the
native stock of the interior. These primitive native stocks can be
largely identified on the basis of their habits and methods of living.
The Nilotic tribes have been chiefly herders of cattle and goats and
have lived primarily on dairy products, including milk and blood, with
some meat, and with a varying percentage of vegetable foods. It was
most interesting to observe that in every instance these cattle people
dominated the surrounding tribes. They were characterized by superb
physical development, great bravery and a mental acumen that made it
possible for them to dominate because of their superior intelligence.
Among these Nilotic tribes the Masai forced their way farthest south
and occupy a position between two of the great Bantu tribes, the Kikuyu
and the Wakamba. Both of these latter tribes are primarily agricultural
people.</p>

<p>    <i>Masai Tribe.</i> The Masai are tall and strong. Fig. 39 shows
a typical belle, also a Masai man who is much taller than our six-foot
guide. It is interesting to study the methods of living and observe the
accumulated wisdom of the Masai. They are reported to have known for
over two hundred years that malaria was carried by mosquitoes, and
further they have practiced exposing the members of their tribes who
had been infected with syphilis by the Arabs to malaria to prevent the
serious injuries resulting from the spirochetal infection. Yet modern
medicine boasts of being the discoverers of this great principle of
using malaria to prevent or relieve syphilitic infections of the spinal
cord and brain.</p>

<p>    I saw the native Masai operating on their cattle with skill and
knowledge. The Masai have no currency and all their transactions are
made with cows or goats. A valuable cow was not eating properly, and I
observed them taking a thorn out of the inside of her mouth. The
surgical operation was done with a knife of their own making and
tempered by pounding. The wound was treated by rubbing it with the
ashes of a plant that acted as a very powerful styptic. Their knowledge
of veterinary science is quite remarkable. I saw them treating a young
cow that had failed to conceive. They apparently knew the cause and
proceeded to treat her as modern veterinaries might do in order to
overcome her difficulties. For their food throughout the centuries they
have depended very largely on milk, meat and blood, reinforced with
vegetables and fruits. They milk the cows daily and bleed the steers at
regular intervals by a unique process. In Fig. 40 we see a native Masai
with his bow and arrow, the latter tipped with a sharp knife which is
guarded by a shoulder to determine the depth to which the arrow may
enter the vein. If the animal is sufficiently tame, the blood is drawn
while it is standing. If the animal is frightened it is quickly
hobbled, as shown below. In this figure the stream of blood may be seen
spurting from the jugular vein into a gourd which holds about a gallon.
A torque is placed around the neck before the puncture is made. The
animals did not even flinch when struck by the arrow, the operation is
done so quickly and skillfully. When sufficient blood was drawn, the
torque was removed and the blood immediately stopped flowing. A styptic
made of ashes referred to above was used. This serves also to protect
the wound from infection. The blood is defibrinated by whipping in the
gourd. The fibrin is fried or cooked much as bacon or meat would be
prepared. The defibrinated blood is used raw just as the milk is,
except in smaller quantities. When available, each growing child
receives a day's ration of blood as does each pregnant or lactating
woman. Formerly, the warriors used this food exclusively. These three
sources, milk, blood and meat provide them with liberal supplies of
body-building minerals and the special vitamins, both fat-soluble and
water soluble. Their estimate of a desirable dairy stock is based on
quality not quantity. They judge the value of a cow for keeping in
their herd by the length of time it takes her calf to stand on its feet
and run after it is born, which is only a very few minutes. This is in
striking contrast with the practice of our modern dairymen who are
chiefly concerned with the quantity of milk and quantity of butter fat
rather than with its value as a source of special factors for
nutrition. Many of the calves of the modern high-production cows of
civilized countries are not able to stand for many hours after birth,
frequently twenty-four. This ability to stand is very important in a
country infested with predatory animals; such as lions, leopards,
hyenas, jackals and vultures.</p>

<table summary="" width="325" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding=

<caption align="BOTTOM"><font size="-1">FIG. 40. An important source of
fat soluble vitamins during the drought period is the blood of the

tipped arrow being shot into the neck vein. If the animal is wild it is
hobbled as shown below where the stream of blood is seen spurting into
the gourd. The flow ceases when the compress is
removed.</font></caption>

<p>    This reminded me of my experience in Alaska in studying the
reindeer of the Eskimos. I was told that a reindeer calf could be
dropped in a foot of snow and almost immediately it could run with such
speed that the predatory animals, including wolves, could not catch it.
And, moreover, that these fawns would go almost immediately after their
birth with a herd on a stampede and never be knocked down.</p>

<p>    The problem of combating the predatory animals, particularly the
lions, calls for greater skill and bravery than is required by other
tribes in Africa. The lions live on the large grazing animals,
particularly the cattle, from which they select the strongest. In
driving over the veldt we frequently saw one or two men or boys
guarding an entire herd with only their spears. Their skill in killing
a lion with a spear is one of the most superb of human achievements. I
was interested to learn that they much prefer their locally made spears
to those that are manufactured outside and brought in, because of their
certainty that they will not break, will withstand straightening
regardless of how much they are bent and because due to the process of
manufacture will take a very sharp edge.</p>

<p>    On one occasion, after we had been kept awake much of the night
by the roaring of the lions and neighing of the zebras that were being
attacked by the lions, we visited a Masai manyata nearby in the morning
to learn that when they let their cattle and goats out of the corral of
acacia thorns, three or four spearsmen went ahead in search of the
lions that might be waiting to ambush the cattle. They apparently did
not have the slightest fear. The lions evidentally had made a kill
nearby. This the natives determined by the number of coyotes.</p>

<p>    The heart and courage of these people has been largely broken by
the action of the government in taking away their shields in order to
prevent them pillaging the surrounding native tribes as formerly. They
depended upon their shields to protect them from the arrows of the
other tribes. The efforts to make agriculturists of these Masai people
are not promising.</p>

<p>    In a typical manyata the chief has several wives. Each one has a
separate dwelling. Timber and shrubbery are so scarce in this vicinity
that the dwellings are built of clay mixed with cow dung which is
plastered over a framework of twigs. Many chiefs are over six feet in
height.</p>

<p>    The Masai live in a very extensive game preserve in which
hundreds of thousands of grazing animals enjoy an existence protected
from man since even the natives are not allowed to kill the animals as
formerly. They seemed to be preserved for the numerous lions which
occasionally become very bold since they have an abundance of food and
no enemies. Recently the local government authorities found it
necessary to shoot off eighty of the lions in a particular district
because of their aggressiveness.</p>

<p>    In the Masai tribe, a study of 2,516 teeth in eighty-eight
individuals distributed through several widely separated manyatas
showed only four individuals with caries. These had a total of ten
carious teeth, or only 0.4 per cent of the teeth attacked by tooth
decay.</p>

<p>    <i>Kikuyu Tribe, Kianzbu, Kenya.</i> In contrast with the Masai,
the Kikuyu tribe, which inhabits a district to the west and north of
the Masai, are characterized by being primarily an agricultural people.
Their chief articles of diet are sweet potatoes, corn, beans, and some
bananas, millet, and Kafir corn, a variety of Indian millet. The women
use special diets during gestation and lactation. The girls in this
tribe, as in several others, are placed on a special diet for six
months prior to marriage. They nurse their children for three harvests
and precede each pregnancy with special feeding.</p>

<p>    The Kikuyus are not as tall as the Masai and physically they are
much less rugged. Like many of the central African tribes, they remove
some lower incisors at the time these permanent teeth erupt. This
custom is reported to have been established for the purpose of feeding
the individuals in case of lock-jaw. One of the striking tribal customs
is the making of large perforations in the ears in which they carry
many metal ornaments. A typical Kikuyu woman is shown in Fig. 41 (upper
right). Typical Kikuyu men are also shown in Fig. 41. Note their fine
teeth and dental arches.</p>

<p>    A study of 1,041 teeth in thirty-three individuals showed
fifty-seven teeth with caries, or 5.5 per cent. These were 36.4 per
cent of the individuals affected.</p>

<p>    Much of the territory occupied by the Kikuyu tribes was formerly
forest. Their practice has been to burn down a section of forest in
order to get new lands for planting. As soon as the virgin fertility is
exhausted, which is usually in three to five years, they burn down
another section of forest. By this process they have largely denuded
their section of Kenya of its timber. This has resulted in a great
waste of building material. There are few stands of native forest
within easy reach of transportation.</p>

<p>    <i>Wakamba Tribe, Kenya.</i> The Wakamba tribe point their teeth
as shown in Fig. 41. They occupy the territory to the east of the
Masai, who in past centuries have driven themselves as a wedge between
the Kikuyu and the Wakamba tribes. The Masai until checked carried on a
relentless warfare, consisting largely of raids, in which they
slaughtered the men and carried off the women and children and drove
away the cattle or goats. The Wakambas are intellectually superior to
the Kikuyus and have distinct artistic skill in the carving of art
objects. They are mechanical and like machinery. Many of them have
important positions in the shops of the Kenya and Uganda railway.</p>

<p>    An examination of 1,112 teeth of thirty-seven individuals showed
sixty-nine teeth with caries, or 6.2 per cent. Twenty-one and
six-tenths per cent of the individuals studied had dental caries.</p>

<p>    <i>Jalou Tribe, Kenya.</i> This tribe occupies the territory
along Lake Victoria and Kisumu Bay. They are one of the most
intelligent and physically excellent native tribes. They were studied
in two groups, one at Maseno, and the other at Ogado.</p>

<p>    The group studied at the Maseno school were boys ranging from
about ten years to twenty-two, totaling about 190 in all. The principal
of the school presented the boys in military formation for inspection.
Through him as interpreter I asked that all boys who had ever had
toothache hold up their hands, and nineteen did so. Of the nineteen
only one individual was found to have caries; two of his teeth were
involved, which, out of 546 teeth for these individuals, gives 0.4 per
cent of the teeth with caries.</p>

<p>    In the Ogada Mission a study of 258 teeth for ten individuals
revealed no teeth affected with dental caries.</p>

<p>    <i>Jeannes School, Kenya.</i> This school is located at Kabete.
It is an institution where young married couples are trained in
domestic science, agriculture, and similar subjects.</p>

<p>    In 388 teeth of thirteen individuals, thirty-one teeth were
found to have been attacked by dental caries, or 7.9 per cent. These
were in six individuals.</p>

<p>    <i>Pumwani Mission School, Kenya.</i> This is a native suburb of
Nairobi, and there the people have come under the influence of recent
European contact.</p>

<p>    In an examination of 588 teeth of twenty-one individuals
twenty-six teeth had caries, or 4.4 per cent.</p>

<p>    <i>C. M. S. School, Nukuru, Kenya.</i> The children of this
school belong to several tribes, chiefly Jalou. In a study of 312 teeth
of eleven individuals, only one tooth was found to have been attacked
by tooth decay, or 0.3 per cent.</p>

<p>    <i>Chewya at Kisurnu, Kenya.</i> The natives of this district
belong to the Maragoli tribe. They are very strong and physically well
developed. They live within easy reach of Lake Victoria from which they
obtain large quantities of fish which constitutes an important part of
their diet, together with cereals and sweet potatoes.</p>

<p>    A study of 552 teeth of nineteen individuals revealed only one
tooth with dental caries, or 0.2 per cent.</p>

<p>    <i>Muhima Tribe or Anchola, Uganda.</i> This tribe resides in
southern Uganda. They, like the Masai, are primarily a cattle raising
people and live on milk, blood and meat. The district in which they
live is to the east of Lake Edward and the Mountains of the Moon. They
constitute one of the very primitive and undisturbed groups. While the
Masai raise chiefly the hump-backed cattle, the herds of this Muhima or
Anchola tribe are characterized by their large wide-spread horns. Like
the Masai, they are tall and courageous. They defend their herds and
their families from lions and leopards with their primitive spears.
Like the other primitive cattle people, they dominate the adjoining
tribes.</p>

<p>    In a study of 1,040 teeth of thirty-seven individuals, not a
single tooth was found with dental caries. This tribe makes their huts
of grass and sticks.</p>

<p>    <i>Watusi Tribe.</i> This is a very interesting tribe living on
the east of Lake Kivu, one of the headwaters of the West Nile in Ruanda
which is a Belgian Protectorate. They are tall and athletic. Their
faces differ markedly from those of other tribes, and they boast a very
noble inheritance. According to legend, a Roman military expedition
penetrated into central Africa at the time of Anthony and Cleopatra. A
phalanx remained, refusing to return with the expedition. They took
wives from the native tribes and passed laws that thereafter no
marriage could take place outside their group. They have magnificent
physiques. Many stand over six feet without shoes.</p>

<p>    Several of the tribes neighboring Ethiopia are agriculturists
and grow corn, beans, millet, sweet potatoes, bananas, Kafir corn, and
other grains, as their chief articles of food. Physically they are not
as well built as either the tribes using dairy products liberally or
those using fish from the fresh water lakes and streams. They have been
dominated because they possess less courage and resourcefulness.</p>

<p>    The Government of Kenya has for several years sponsored an
athletic contest among the various tribes, the test being one of
strength for which they use a tug-of-war. One particular tribe has
carried off the trophy repeatedly. This tribe resides on the east coast
of Lake Victoria and lives very largely on fish. The members are
powerful athletes and wonderful swimmers. They are said not to have
been conquered in warfare when they could take the warfare to the
water. One of their methods is to swim under water to the enemy's fleet
and scuttle their boats. They fight with spears under water with
marvelous skill. Their physiques are magnificent. In a group of 190
boys who had been gathered into a government school near the east coast
of Lake Victoria only one boy was found with dental caries, and two of
his teeth had been affected. The people dry the fish which are carried
far inland.</p>

<p>    Uganda which lies to the north and west of Lake Victoria and
west of Kenya, is high and although on the equator, has an equitable
climate with an abundance of native foods. Two crops per year are
produced, and many varieties of bananas grow wild. The Buganda Tribe,
Uganda, is the chief tribe of this region. Uganda has been called the
Garden of Eden of Africa because of its abundance of plant foods,
chiefly bananas and sweet potatoes, and because of its abundance of
fresh water fish and animal life. The natives are thrifty and mentally
superior to those of most other districts. They have a king and a
native parliament which the British Government recognizes and entrusts
with local administrative affairs. A typical group was studied in a
mission at Masaka. An examination of 664 teeth of twenty-one
individuals revealed only three teeth with caries, or 0.4 per cent.</p>

<p>    <i>West Nile Laborers from the Belgian Congo.</i> The West Nile
Laborers studied at Masaka represent a very strong and dependable
group. They come from districts north of Lake Albert in Belgian Congo.
They are much sought for in industrial enterprises and are often moved
in groups for a considerable distance.</p>

<p>    A study of 984 teeth of thirty-one individuals revealed that
only three teeth had ever been attacked by tooth decay, or 0.3 per
cent. Only one individual had dental caries.</p>

<p>    As one travels down the West Nile and later along the western
border of Ethiopia many unique tribes are met. A typical negroid type
of the upper Nile region is shown in Fig. 42. Members of these tribes
wear little or no clothing. They have splendid physiques and high
immunity to dental caries.</p>

<p>    After the confluence of the White Nile and West Nile, the former
draining Lake Victoria and the Uganda lakes through Uganda, and the
latter, Lakes Kivu, Edwards and Albert and eastern Belgian Congo, the
volume of water moving northward is very large. A unique obstruction to
navigation has developed due to the fact that the Nile runs underground
for a considerable distance. In this district vegetation is rank and
prolific, including large quantities of water plants which form islands
that are often attached temporarily to the shore. The water carries
large quantities of alluvia which furnish an abundance of nutriment to
the floating plant life. Accordingly, in many of these floating islands
a large quantity of soil is enmeshed in the plant roots. At some period
in the past the river became bridged across in upper Sudan near its
southern border. With the progressive addition of new material a large
natural bridge has been raised on which trees are now growing, and
across which are elephant trails. This and a series of rapids require a
detour of over a hundred miles.</p>

<p>    The elephants are so plentiful in this district that both in
Uganda and Sudan the governments have been required to send in special
hunters to reduce the herds. In one district in Uganda two hundred were
said to have been slaughtered. They are very destructive to banana
plantations. They break the banana trees over or pull them up by the
roots and eat the succulent heart as well as the fruits. In a night a
herd may destroy an entire plantation. The only people in the districts
who are permitted to kill the elephants without license are the
pygmies. They are also the only ones not required to pay a head tax.
There are many tribes of them in the great forest area in Belgian Congo
and Uganda. Their skill with spears is remarkable and they are able to
kill an elephant while the animal remains unaware of his danger. It
takes them one to two days to hamstring an elephant by working
stealthily from behind, always keeping out of the elephant's sight.
Although an elephant can scent a human for a long distance, these
pygmies can disguise themselves so completely that the elephant is
unaware of their presence. After disabling him by cutting the tendons
of both hind legs, they attack him openly and, while one attracts his
attention, the other slowly but progressively hacks off his trunk. In
this manner he bleeds to death. They are particularly fond of elephant
meat and a slaughter means a great feast. While we were in one of the
pygmy colonies two of them brought in the tusks of an elephant they had
just killed. We had the rare opportunity of witnessing the celebration
in the colony, which included the special reproduction in pantomime of
the attack and method of killing the elephant. The pygmy mother of
these two men is shown in Fig. 43 (lower half). It will be noticed that
she is a full head shorter than Mrs. Price, who is five feet three
inches tall. This rugged, though small, woman is the mother of five
grown men, two of whom are shown in Fig. 43 with the tusks of the
elephant. Note their homemade spears. As marksmen with bows and arrows
and as trappers, these pygmies have wonderful skill. Their arrows are
tipped with iron of their own manufacture and have receptacles for
carrying drugs which they extract from plants. These drugs temporarily
paralyze the animals. For animals which they wish to destroy the arrows
carry a poison which rapidly produces death. The home life of the
pygmies in the forest is often filled with danger. Just before our
arrival two babies had been carried off by a leopard. This stealthy
night prowler is one of the most difficult animals to combat and
probably has been one of the reasons the pygmies build cabins in the
trees. Ordinarily their homes are built on the ground in a little
clearing in the big forest. They consist of low shelters covered with
banana leaves and other plants, built over a frame work. The native
missionary dispensed our gift of salt which is one of their most prized
gifts. They put on a dance for us.</p>

<p>    <i>Pygmies, Ituru Forest, Belgian Congo.</i> These people are
said to have originally lived in the trees and they were exceedingly
shy and difficult to contact. We were taken to several of their
villages in the heart of the dense Ituru forest. We found them very
well disposed through the confidence that has been established by the
mission workers. Their shyness, however, together with the difficulty
of making them understand through two transfers of languages, made an
examination of their teeth very difficult.</p>

<p>    A study of 352 teeth of twelve individuals revealed eight teeth
had been attacked by tooth decay, or 2.2 per cent.</p>

<p>    The native tribes of Africa have depended to a great extent on
fresh water fish from the numerous lakes and rivers for certain of
their essential food factors. After being dried in the sun these fish
are carried long distances into the interior. The Nile perch grows
frequently to a weight of 150 pounds. The natives of Africa know that
certain insects are very rich in special food values at certain
seasons, also that their eggs are valuable foods. A fly that hatches in
enormous quantities in Lake Victoria is gathered and used fresh and
dried for storage. They also use ant eggs and ants.</p>

<p>    <i>Nyankunde Mission, Iruinu, Belgian Congo.</i> This group is
made up of members of the Bahema, Babira, Alur and Balendu tribes. We
will consider the representatives of these different tribes
collectively since they live largely on a common dietary consisting
chiefly of cereals. Only the Bahemas of this group have small herds of
cattle. Some of the others have a few goats. This district is located
southwest of Lake Albert.</p>

<p>    A study of 6,461 teeth of 217 individuals revealed 390 teeth
with dental caries, or 6 per cent. Thirty-eight and seven-tenths per
cent of the individuals suffered from dental caries.</p>

<p>    <i>Bogora Mission, Belgian Congo.</i> This mission is located
west of Lake Albert and includes members of the Bahema and Balendu
tribes. While the Bahema tribe originally lived very largely on cattle
products, milk, blood and meat, in this district, the herds were small
and they were using a considerable quantity of cereals, chiefly corn
and beans, some sweet potatoes and bananas. These latter were the chief
foods of the other tribes, in addition to goats' milk.</p>

<p>    An examination of 2,196 teeth of seventy-seven individuals
revealed 160 teeth with caries, or 7.2 per cent. Fifty-three per cent
of the individuals had caries.</p>

<p>    <i>Kasenyi Port, Lake Albert, Belgian Congo.</i> These natives
were members of several tribes surrounding this district who were for
the most part temporary residents as laborers. The people had been
living largely on a cereal diet and now during their temporary
residence at the port had had fish.</p>

<p>    An examination of 1,940 teeth of sixty-three individuals
revealed 120 teeth with dental caries, or 6.1 per cent of the teeth.
Fifty and eighttenths per cent of the individuals had dental
caries.</p>

<p>    <i>Wanande Tribe, Belgian Congo.</i> This tribe is located at
Lubero in Belgian Congo. Their diet consists largely of bananas, sweet
potatoes, cereals and goats' milk.</p>

<p>    In an examination of 368 teeth of thirteen individuals, there
were eight teeth with caries, or 2.2 per cent. Fifteen and four-tenths
per cent of the individuals were affected.</p>

<p>    <i>Baitu Tribe, Nyunge, Ruanda, Belgian Protectorate.</i> This
district lies south of Uganda and east of Belgian Congo proper,
northwest of Tanganyika. It lies just east of Lake Kivu. When we learn
that Lake Kivu was only discovered in 1894, even though it is one of
the important sources of the Nile waters, we realize the primitiveness
of the people of this and adjoining districts. This group lives largely
on dairy products from cattle and goats, together with sweet potatoes,
cereals and bananas.</p>

<p>    In a study of 364 teeth of thirteen individuals, not a single
tooth was found to have been attacked by dental caries.</p>

<p>    <i>Native Hotel Staff at Goina, Belgian Congo.</i> This group
consisted of the inside and outside servants of a tourist hotel on Lake
Kivu.</p>

<p>    An examination of 320 teeth of ten individuals revealed twenty
teeth with caries, or 6.3 per cent. It is significant that all of these
carious teeth were in the mouth of one individual, the cook. The others
all boarded themselves and lived on native diets. The cook used
European foods.</p>

<p>    Where the members of the African tribes had attached themselves
to coffee plantations aad were provided with the imported foods of
white flour, sugar, polished rice and canned goods, tooth decay became
rampant. This is typically illustrated in Fig. 44.</p>

<table summary="" width="325" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding=

<caption align="BOTTOM"><font size="-1">FIG. 44. Wherever the Africans
have aidopted the foods of modern commerce, dental caries was active,

<p>    Anglo-Egyptian Sudan has an area approximately one-third that of
the United States. It is traversed throughout its length from south to
north by the Nile. There are several tribes living along this great
waterway, which are of special interest now owing to their close
proximity to Ethiopia. There are wonderful hunters and warriors among
them. In hunting they use their long-bladed spears almost entirely. The
shores of the Nile for nearly a thousand miles in this district are
lined with papyrus and other water plants to a depth of from several
hundred yards to a few miles. Back of this area the land rises and
provides excellent pasturage for the grazing cattle. These tribes,
therefore, use milk, blood and meat from cattle and large quantities of
animal life from the Nile River. Some of the tribes are very tall,
particularly the Neurs. The women are often six feet or over, and the
men seven feet, some of them reaching seven and a half feet in height.
I was particularly interested in their food habits both because of
their high immunity to dental caries which approximated one hundred per
cent, and because of their physical development. I learned that they
have a belief which to them is their religion, namely, that every man
and woman has a soul which resides in the liver and that a man's
character and physical growth depend upon how well he feeds that soul
by eating the livers of animals. The liver is so sacred that it may not
be touched by human hands. It is accordingly always handled with their
spear or saber, or with specially prepared forked sticks. It is eaten
both raw and cooked.</p>

<p>    Many of these tribes, like the Neurs, wear no clothing and
decorate their bodies with various designs, some of them representing
strings of beads produced by putting foreign substances under the skin
in definite order. They have maintained a particularly bitter warfare
against the Arab slave dealers who have come across from the Red Sea
coast to carry off the women and children. In isolated districts even
to this day they are suspicious of foreigners. We were told that in one
district adjoining Ethiopia all light skinned people are in danger and
cannot safely enter that territory without a military escort.</p>

<p>    <i>Terraizeka, Upper Nile, Sudan.</i> These people are tall and
live largely on fish and other animal life. This part of Sudan consists
of many districts of great marshland called the sudd. It is covered
with rank papyrus to the height of fifteen to thirty feet. This jungle
of rank marsh growth swarms with a wide variety of animal life, large
and small.</p>

<p>    An examination of 548 teeth of eighteen individuals revealed
that not a single tooth had been attacked by dental caries, or 100 per
cent immunity.</p>

<p>    <i>Neurs, Malakal, Sudan.</i> The Neurs at Malakal on the Nile
River are a unique tribe because of their remarkable stature. Many of
the women are six feet tall and the men range from six feet to seven
and a half feet in height. Their food consists very largely of animal
life of the Nile, dairy products, milk and blood from the herds.</p>

<p>    A study of 1,268 teeth of thirty-nine individuals revealed only
six teeth with dental caries, or 0.5 per cent. Only three individuals
had caries, or 7.7 per cent.</p>

<p>    <i>Dinkas, Jebelein, Sudan.</i> This tribe lives on the Nile.
Its members are not as tall as the Neurs. They are physically better
proportioned and have greater strength. They use fish from the Nile and
cereals for their diet. They decorate their bodies profusely with
scars.</p>

<p>    An examination of 592 teeth of twenty-two individuals revealed
only one tooth with caries, or 0.2 per cent.</p>

<p>    <i>Arab Schools at Khartoum and Omdurman, Sudan.</i> The Arabs
are the chief occupants of the territory of Northern Sudan. Omdurman on
the west bank of the White Nile opposite Khartoum is the largest purely
Arab city in the world. It has been but slightly influenced by modern
civilization. Khartoum, on the contrary, just across the river from
Omdurman and the capital of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, has districts which
are typically modern. These include the government offices and
administration organization. The Arab section of Khartoum has been
definitely influenced by contact with the Europeans. This makes
possible a comparative study of similar groups in the two
cities-modernized Khartoum and primitive Omdurman.</p>

<p>    A study of 1,284 teeth of fifty-two individuals in an Arab
school at Khartoum revealed that 59 teeth or 4.7 per cent had been
attacked by dental caries, or 44.2 per cent of the individuals
studied.</p>

<p>    In Omdurman a study of 744 teeth in thirty-one individuals,
revealed only nine teeth that had been attacked by tooth decay, or 1.2
per cent. In this group only two or 6.4 per cent of the individuals had
dental caries.</p>

<p>    The groups examined were selected with the assistance of the
government officials and consisted of the higher grade pupils in two
advanced native schools, one in Khartoum and one in Omdurman.</p>

<p>    It is of interest that of the two boys in the Arab school at
Omdurman with dental caries one was the son of a rich merchant and used
liberally sweets and European foods.</p>

<p>    <i>Native Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan.</i> The individuals studied
in this institution were from quite remote areas distributed through
Sudan. Some had traveled many days on camels to obtain the help that
the hospital provided.</p>

<p>    A study of 288 teeth of ten individuals revealed that thirteen
had been attacked by tooth decay, or 4.5 per cent.</p>

<p>    <i>Ikhlas School, Cairo, Egypt.</i> This is a native school in
which the individuals are comparable in many respects to those in the
native schools at Khartoum and Omdurman. Their nutrition is highly
modernized by living in a modern city.</p>

<p>    A study of 2,092 teeth of eighty-five individuals revealed that
353 teeth or 12.1 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay.
Seventy-five per cent of the individuals of this group had dental
caries.</p>

<p>    The total number of teeth examined in the preceding groups was
28,438. Of this number, 1,346 were found with dental caries or 4.7 per
cent. This represents a total of 1,002 individuals examined, of whom
300 had one or more carious teeth, or had lost teeth by caries, making
29.9 per cent of the individuals with dental caries. Of this total
number of individuals studied in twenty-seven groups, there were
several groups with practically complete immunity to dental caries,
while other groups had relatively high incidence of that disease.</p>

<p>   <i>Facial and Dental Arch Deformities.</i> The purpose of these
studies has included the obtaining of data which will throw light also
on the etiology of deformities of the dental arches and face, including
irregularity of position of the teeth.</p>

<p>    A marked variation of the incidence of irregularities was found
in the different tribes. This variation could be directly associated
with the nutrition rather than with the tribal pattern. The lowest
percentage of irregularity occurred in the tribes living very largely
on dairy products and marine life. For example, among the Masai living
on milk, blood and meat, only 3.4 per cent had irregularities. Among
the Kikuyu and Wakamba, 18.2 and 18.9 per cent respectively had
irregularities. These peap!e were largely agriculturists living
primarily on vegetable foods. In the native Arab school at Omdurman,
among the pupils living almost entirely according to the native customs
of selection and preparation of foods, 6.4 per cent had irregularities,
while in the native school at modernized Khartoum 17 per cent had
irregularities. In the Ikhlas school at Cairo, under modern influence,
16.5 per cent had irregularities. In the native hospital at Khartoum,
70 per cent had irregularities. In the Pygmy group 33.3 per cent had
irregularities, and among the grain eaters of the west Nile, 25.5 per
cent had irregularities. The Jeannes School had 46.1 per cent and the
Ogada mission 30 per cent.</p>

<p>    While the primitive racial stocks of Africa developed normal
facial and dental arch forms when on their native foods, several
characteristic types of deformity frequently developed in the children
of the modernized groups. One of the simplest forms, and one which
corresponds with a very common deformity pattern in the United States,
involves the dropping inward of the laterals with narrowing of the
upper arch making the incisors appear abnormally prominent and crowding
the cuspids outside the line of the arch. Typical illustrations of this
are shown in Fig. 45. Where the nutritional deficiency is very severe,
as at Mombasa on the coast, more severe changes in facial form are
found.</p>

<p>    Among the deformity patterns a lack of development forward of
the middle third of the face or of the lower third of the face often
appeared in the more highly modernized groups. An illustration of the
former is seen in Fig. 46 (upper left), and of the latter in Fig. 46
(lower left and right). In the girl at the upper left, the upper arch
tends to go inside the lower arch all around. This girl is of the first
generation, in a mission in Nairobi, following the adoption of the
modernized foods by the parents.</p>

<p>    A more extreme and severe type of facial change involves an
abnormal narrowing with marked distortion of both upper and lower
arches. This is shown typically in Fig. 47.</p>

<p>    The Arabs in several districts use camels' milk extensively. It
is nutritious, and in much of the desert country constitutes the
mainstay of the nomads for months at a time. The primitive Arabs
studied had fine dental arches with very little deformity. Even the
horses ridden by the Arab chiefs in moving their camel herds across the
desert are often dependent, sometimes for as long as three months, upon
the milk of the camels for their nutrition. Typical Arab faces and a
camel caravan at rest are shown in Fig. 49. The primitive Arab girls
have splendidly developed faces and fine dental arches. Their natural
beauty, however, is rapidly lost with modernization, as illustrated in
Fig. 50.</p>

<p>    Dr. Hrdlicka has called attention to the occasional development
in several racial stocks of individuals who travel on all fours instead
of upright. I saw several individuals of this type in Africa scooting
around about as rapidly as the dogs. They were, accordingly, difficult
to photograph. Two are shown in Fig. 51.</p>

<p>    While slavery of the old form no longer exists in the so-called
civilized countries, in its new form it is a most tragic reality for
many of the people. Taxes and the new order of living make many
demands. For many of these primitive tribes a new suit of clothes could
formerly be had every day with no more trouble than cutting a new
banana leaf. With the new order they are requested to cover their
bodies with clothing. Cloth of all kinds including the poorest cotton
has to be imported. They must pay an excessive charge due to the long
transportation cost for the imported goods, a charge which often
exceeds the original cost in the European or American markets by
several fold. In order to pay their head tax they are frequently
required to carry such products as can be used by the government
officials, chiefly foods, over long distances and for part of each
year. These foods are often those which not only the adults, but
particularly the growing children sorely need for providing body growth
and repair. This naturally has produced a current of acute unrest and a
chafing under the foreign domination.</p>

<p>    As we encircled Ethiopia we found the natives not only aware of
what was going on in that border country, but deeply concerned
regarding the outcome. From their temper and sympathetic attitude for
the oppressed Ethiopians, it would not be surprising if sympathizers
pass over the border into that country to support their crushed
neighbors. The problem is accordingly very much larger than the
interest of some particular foreign power. It deals directly with the
future course of events and the attitude of the African natives in
general toward foreign domination. The native African is not only
chafing under the taxation by foreign overlords, but is conscious that
his race becomes blighted when met by our modern civilization. I found
them well aware of the fact that those of their tribes who had adopted
European methods of living and foods not only developed rampant tooth
decay, but other degenerative processes.</p>

<p>    In one of the most efficiently organized mission schools that we
found in Africa, the principal asked me to help them solve a serious
problem. He said there was no single question asked them so often by
the native boys in their school as why it is that those families that
have grown up in the mission or government schools were physically not
so strong as those families who had never been in contact with the
mission or government schools. These young men were thinking. I was
even asked several times by them whether or not I thought that the
native Africans must go the way of the Red Indians of America.</p>

<p>    The happiness of the people in their homes and community life is
everywhere very striking. A mining prospector who had spent two decades
studying the mineral deposits of Uganda was quoted to me as stating
that if he could have the heaven of his choice in which to spend all
eternity it would be to live in Uganda as the natives of Uganda had
lived before modern civilization came to it.</p>

<p>    While inter-tribal warfare has largely ceased, a new scourge is
upon them, namely the scourge which comes with modern civilization. As
in the primitive racial stocks previously studied and reported, we
found that modernizing forces were often associated with a very marked
increase of the death rate over the birth rate. In some districts in
Africa a marked degeneration is taking place. Geoffrey Gorer in his
book, "Africa Dances," <font size="-2">(1)</font> which was written
after making studies in West Africa, discusses this problem at
length.</p>

<p>    He quotes figures given by Marcel Sauvage <font size=
"-2">(2)</font> in his article on French Equatorial Africa: "'In 1911
French Equatorial Africa had twenty million negro inhabitants; in 1921
there were seven and a half million; in 1931 there were two and a half
million.'"</p>

<p>   He states regarding the quotation: "These figures were given in a
responsible French conservative paper and have not been denied." Major
Browne, a high official of the British Government Administrative
Department of Kenya, with long experience, states in the closing
paragraph of his book entitled, "The Vanishing Tribes of Kenya," <font
size="-2">(3)</font> the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> <font size="-1">   It must also be remembered that the "blessings
of civilization" are not in practice by any means as obvious as some
simple-minded folk would like to believe. It can be said with fair
accuracy that among the tribes with which we have been dealing there
is, in their uncontaminated society, no pauperism, no paid
prostitution, very little serious drunkenness, and on the whole
astonishingly little crime; while practically everyone has enough to
eat, sufficient clothing, and an adequate dwelling, according to the
primitive native standard. Of what civilized community can as much be
said?</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="-1">   </font> Civilizations have been rising and
falling not only through all the period of recorded history, but long
before as evidenced by archeological findings. If we think of Nature's
calendar as one in which centuries are days and civilizations are
years, the part current events are playing in the history of a great
continent like Africa may be mere incidents.</p>

<p>    This much we do know that throughout the world some remnants of
several primitive racial stocks have persisted to this day even in very
exacting environments and only by such could they have been
protected.</p>

<p>    In my studies of these several racial stocks I find that it is
not accident but accumulated wisdom regarding foods that lies behind
their physical excellence and freedom from our modern degenerative
processes, and, further, that on various sides of our world the
primitive people know many of the things that are essential for
life-things that our modern civilizations apparently do not know. These
are the fundamental truths of life that have put them in harmony with
Nature through obeying her nutritional laws. Whence this wisdom? Was
there in the distant past a world civilization that was better attuned
to Nature's laws and have these remnants retained that knowledge? If
this is not the explanation, it must be that these various primitive
racial stocks have been able through a superior skill in interpreting
cause and effect, to determine for themselves what foods in their
environment are best for producing human bodies with a maximum of
physical fitness and resistance to degeneration.</p>

<p>    Primitive native races of eastern and central Africa have in
their native state a very high immunity to dental caries, ranging from
0 to less than 1 per cent of the teeth affected for many of the tribes.
Where modernized, however, the incidence increased to 12.1 per
cent.</p>

<p>    In the matter of facial deformity thirteen tribes out of
twenty-seven studied presented so high a standard of excellence that
not a single individual in the group was found with deformed dental
arches.</p>

<p>    Their nutrition varied according to their location, but always
provided an adequate quantity of body-building and repairing material,
even though much effort was required to obtain some of the essential
food factors. Many tribes practiced feeding girls special foods for an
extended period before marriage. Spacing of children was provided by a
system of plural wives.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED AUSTRALIAN
ABORIGINES</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">O</font>UR problem of throwing light upon the cause
of the physical breakdown of our modern civilization, with special
consideration of tooth decay and facial deformity, requires a critical
examination of individuals living in as wide a range of physical
conditions as may be possible. This requires that the Aborigines of
Australia be included in this examination of human reactions to
physical environments. These were studied in 1936.</p>

<p>    In selecting the individuals in the various groups special
effort was made to include children between the ages of ten and sixteen
years in order to have an opportunity to observe and record the
condition of the dental arches after the permanent teeth had erupted.
This was necessary because the deciduous dentition or first set of
teeth may be in normal position in the arches with a correct
relationship between the arches, and the permanent dentition show
marked irregularity. The shape of the dental arches of the infant at
birth and the teeth that are to take their place in the arches have
considerable of their calcification at birth. The development of the
adult face, however, does not occur until the permanent teeth have
erupted. The general shape or pattern is largely influenced by the
position and direction of the eruption of the permanent teeth. These
studies, accordingly, have included a careful, detailed record of the
shape of the dental arch of each individual.</p>

<p>    The Australian Aborigines constitute one of the most unique
primitive races that have come out of the past into our modern times
and they are probably the oldest living race. We are particularly
concerned with those qualities that have made possible their survival
and cultural development.</p>

<p>    The Aborigines are of special interest because they have come
out of a very distant past and are associated with animal life which is
unique in being characterized as a living museum preserved from the
dawn of animal life on the earth. Many of the animal species that are
abundant in Australia are found only in fossil form on other
continents. The evidence indicates that they crossed on a land bridge
which connected Australia with Asia. After the bridge was submerged the
animals persisted in that protected island continent which never has
known any of the animal species of later development. Among these
animals the marsupials play an important role and constitute a large
variety. The American continent has only one or two of the many forms
found in Australia. These are the opossum of the marsupial family and
the sloth. One of the most curious animals living on the earth today,
or that has left its remains in the petrified skeletons of early
periods of the earth's history, is the duckbill platypus. It has the
unique distinction of having the characteristics of several animal
species. It lays eggs like a bird and hatches them with the heat of its
body in its pouch. It has webbed, five-toed feet, like the water birds,
a bill like a duck and hair and tail like a beaver. The typical
marsupial pouch for carrying its young, is another characteristic of
this strange animal. Like other mammals it provides milk for its young.
Its milk is similar in chemical constituents to that of other mammals.
Most rudimentary in form are the mammary glands of the platypus. The
young, when hatched in the pouch, nuzzle the lining membrane of the
pouch and the milk exudes through minute openings. There is no nipple.
The animal lives chiefly in the water. Its home is built above the
water level on the bank, but the entrance to it is underneath the
water. They are exceedingly playful creatures, apparently more at home
in the water than on land. They live on both animal life and plant food
found under the water. They seem to be related to an early era of
differentiation of animal species.</p>

<p>    The Aborigines are credited with having the most primitive type
of skeletal development of any race living today. The eyes are very
deep set, the brows very prominent giving them an expression that
identifies them as a distinct racial type. See Fig. 52. Professor
Weidenreich has shown that they resemble in this regard the recently
discovered ancient Peking man. While they are still in the Stone Age
stage in their arts and crafts, they have developed further in some
respects than has any other ancient race. Their skill in tracking and
outwitting the fleet and very cunning animal life of their land is so
remarkable that they have been accredited with a sixth sense. They have
been able to build good bodies and maintain them in excellent condition
in a country in which the plant life, and consequently the lower animal
life can be maintained at only a very low level because of the absence
of rain. Over half of Australia has less than ten inches of rain a
year. It is significant that the natives have maintained a vigorous
existence in districts in which the white population which expelled
them is unable to continue to live. Among the white race there, the
death rate approaches or exceeds the birth rate.</p>

<p>    They have developed a device for throwing spears, which makes
them more deadly than any in the world. I witnessed a group of the
present-day natives throwing their spears at a target which consisted
of a banana stalk much smaller than a man's body. They threw the spears
from a distance which I estimated to be seventy-five yards. About
thirty spears were thrown and several pierced the banana stalk and the
others were stuck in the ground close around it. This was accomplished
by means of a wamara or throwing stick approximately as long as the
arm, with a strong hand grip at one end and a device on the other end
for engaging in a depression in the butt of the spear. This was thrown
by poising the spear about the level of the shoulder, the spear
supported by the fingers of the hand which swung the throwing stick.
The latter extended back over the shoulder. The impact of their spears
has often been demonstrated to be sufficient to completely penetrate a
man's body. Their method of tempering wood for the points of the spears
was such that the spearheads offered great resistance. A throwing stick
is shown in Fig. 52 (upper right).</p>

<p>    These natives decorate their bodies with paints for dances and
sports. They know the habits of all of the animals and insects so well
that they are able to reproduce the calls of the animals and thus decoy
them into traps. Some of the water birds maintain sentinels at lookout
points to guard those in the water. The Aborigines are able to decoy
these birds by most ingenious methods. They travel with their bodies
disguised by grass and shrubbery and enter the water with a headgear
made from feathers of one of the birds. Once in the water, they then
maneuver in a manner similar to that of the birds and go among the
flock of wild ducks or swans. Working entirely under water, they draw
the birds under one by one and take load after load to shore without
raising the suspicion of the flock. When working among the kangaroos
they are so skilled in preparing movable blinds that they can kill many
in a grazing wild pack without alarming the rest, always striking when
the animal is grazing. Their skill at fishing probably exceeds that of
any other race. They are so highly trained in the knowledge of the
habits of the fish and the type of movement that the fish transmits to
the water and to the reeds in the water, that one of their important
contests between tribes is to see how many fish can be struck in
succession with a spear, the fish never being seen, their only
information as to its whereabouts being the change in the surface of
the water and movement of grasses that are growing in the water as the
fish moves. The fish are started by the umpire's striking the water.
The experts bring up a fish six times out of eight. These fishing
contests are held along the banks of lakes and rivers where the water
is deep enough for some of the reeds and grasses to come to the
surface. The contestants travel in canoes.</p>

<p>    The native canoe is cut in one piece from the side of a tree,
the cutting being done with stone axes. The canoe offers an exceedingly
treacherous platform from which a standing man must throw his spear.
For some of the contests the canoe carries a paddler, but in the most
exacting contests the spear man must manage his own flat-bottomed
canoe.</p>

<p>    The skill of the Aborigines in tracking is so phenomenal that
practically every large modern town or city in Australia has one or
more of these men on its police staff today to track criminals. For
weeks, they carry the detailed information about the characteristics of
the prisoner's foot across the desert, and when they come across the
man s foot print they recognize it among all others in the same path.
Every leaf that is turned over or grain of sand on bare rocks has
meaning for them.</p>

<p>    Their social organization is such that almost every person who
had been in intimate contact with them, testified that they had never
known any of the Aborigines to be guilty of the theft of anything. Even
where partly modernized, as they are in the large government
reservations they are trustworthy. A nurse in an emergency hospital
told me that she continually left her money, jewelry and other objects
of personal property freely exposed and available where many of the
hundreds of primitives passing could pick them up, and that she had
never known them to take anything. The other nurses had had the same
experience.</p>

<p>    Every boy and girl among these Aborigines must pass many
examinations. Their early schooling includes the tracking of small
animals and insects. The small boys begin throwing spears almost as
soon as they can stand up straight. No young man can even witness a
meeting of the council, let alone become a member of it, until he has
passed three supreme tests of manhood. First, he is tested for his
ability to withstand hunger without complaint. The test for this is to
go on a march for two or three days over the hot desert and assist in
preparing the meals of roast kangaroo and other choice foods and not
partake of any himself. He must not complain. If he becomes too weak,
he is given a small portion. There are tests for fear in which he is
placed under the most trying ordeals without knowing that it is part of
his examination, and he must demonstrate that he will accept death
rather than flee. No member of their society would be allowed to
continue to live with the tribe if he had defied the ideals of the
group. Immorality is cause for immediate death.</p>

<p>    The growing boys among the Aborigines are taught deference and
esteem for their elders in many impressive ways. A boy may not kill or
capture a slow moving animal. That is left for the older men, whom he
must call. He must limit his hunting primarily to the fast fleeing and
canny kangaroos and wallabies, whom even a man on horseback cannot
outdistance. Racketeers and such unsocial beings could not exist in
this type of civilization.</p>

<p>    Marriages are arranged according to very distinct tribal
patterns and every girl is provided with a husband at a time decided by
the council. Their code of ethics is built around the conception of a
powerful Supreme Force that is related to the sun. They believe that
there is an after-existence in which the myriads of stars represent the
spirits of the Aborigines that lived before. The boys and girls are
taught the names of the great characters that make up the different
constellations. These were individuals who had conquered all of the
temptations of life and had lived so completely in the interest of
others that they had fulfilled the great motivating principle of their
religion, which is that life consists in serving others as one would
wish to be served. The seven stars of Pleiades were seven beautiful
maidens that had surpassed most other girls in their devotion and
service in the interest of their tribe. It is most remarkable how
closely this concept is related to the classical myth regarding the
seven daughters of Atlas and the nymph, Pleione.</p>

<p>    A part of a young men's examination to determine his ability to
withstand pain and his power of self-control consists in performing an
operation at the time of his graduation. This operation is at the same
time calculated to provide him with his badge of attainment. It
consists of the boy's lying on his back and allowing the appointed
operator to knock out one of his front upper teeth. This is done by
putting a peg against the tooth and hitting it a series of sharp blows
with a stone. He must endure this without flinching. We saw scores that
carried this diploma. Prior to this, other very severe tests of
physical endurance had been successfully completed.</p>

<p>    The marvelous vision of these primitive people is illustrated by
the fact that they can see many stars that our race cannot see. In this
connection it is authoritatively recorded regarding the Maori of New
Zealand that they can see the satellites of Jupiter which are only
visible to the white man's eye with the aid of telescopes. These people
prove that they can see the satellites by telling the man at the
telescope when the eclipse of one of the stars occurs. It is said of
these primitive Aborigines of Australia that they can see animals
moving at a distance of a mile which ordinary white people can not see
at all.</p>

<p>    While these evidences of superior physical development command
our most profound admiration, their ability to build superb bodies and
maintain them in excellent condition in so difficult an environment
commands our genuine respect. It is a supreme test of human efficiency.
It is doubtful if many places in the world can demonstrate so great a
contrast in physical development and perfection of body as that which
exists between the primitive Aborigines of Australia who have been the
sole arbiters of their fate, and those Aborigines who have been under
the influence of the white man. The white man has deprived them of
their original habitats and is now feeding them in reservations while
using them as laborers in modern industrial pursuits. This contrast
between the primitive Aborigines as they still exist in isolated
communities in Australia and the modern members of the clans is not,
however, much greater than that between these excellent primitives and
the whites, near whom they are living.</p>

<p>    In my comparative study of primitive races in different parts of
the world, of modernized members of their groups and of whites who have
displaced them, as well as in my study of our typical modern social
organization, I have seldom, if ever, found whites suffering so
tragically from evidence of physical degeneration, as expressed in
tooth decay and change in facial form, as are the whites of eastern
Australia. This has occurred on the very best of the land that these
primitives formerly occupied and becomes at once a monument to the
wisdom of the primitive Aborigines and a signboard of warning to the
modern civilization that has supplanted them. Their superb physical
excellence is demonstrated in every isolated group in the primitive
stocks with which we came in contact. For tribes that have lived along
the coast and had access to the sea foods, their stature was large and
well formed.</p>

<p>    When living in the Bush they are largely without clothing. Where
they are congregated in the reservations they are required to wear
clothing. It is important to note in these people the splendid
proportions of the faces, all of which are broad, with the dental
arches wide and well contoured. This is Nature's normal form for all
humans and is shown in Figs. 53 and 54 (upper right). The person in
Fig. 53 (upper left) is a woman.</p>

<p>    Various factors in the changed environment were studied
critically. Samples of foods were gathered for chemical analysis; and
the changes in the modern diet from that which was characteristic of
the primitives were studied. When the teeth of the primitives and the
teeth found in the skulls that had been assembled in the museums were
examined, it was found that dental caries or tooth decay was
exceedingly rare among the isolated groups. Those individuals, however,
who had adopted the foods of the white man suffered extremely from
tooth decay as did the whites. Where they had no opportunity to get
native food to combine with the white man's food their condition was
desperate and extreme. This is readily disclosed in Fig. 54. Note
contrast with upper right. It is quite impossible to imagine the
suffering that these people were compelled to endure due to abscessing
teeth resulting from rampant tooth decay. As we had found in some of
the modernized islands of the Pacific, we discovered that here, too,
discouragement and a longing for death had taken the place of a joy in
living in many. Few souls in the world have experienced this
discouragement and this longing to a greater degree.</p>

<p>    One of the most important phases of our special quest was to get
information that would throw light on the degeneration of the facial
pattern that occurs so often in our modern civilization. This has its
expression in the narrowing and lengthening of the face and the
development of crooked teeth. It is most remarkable and should be one
of the most challenging facts that can come to our modern civilization
that such primitive races as the Aborigines of Australia, have
reproduced for generation after generation through many centuries-no
one knows for how many thousands of years-without the development of a
conspicuous number of irregularities of the dental arches. Yet, in the
next generation after these people adopt the foods of the white man, a
large percentage of the children developed irregularities of the dental
arches with conspicuous facial deformities. The deformity patterns are
similar to those seen in white civilizations. Typical illustrations of
this will be seen in Figs. 55 and 56. Severe deformities of the face
were frequently seen in the modernized groups, as evidenced in Fig.
57.</p>

<p>    The data obtained from a study of the native Australians who are
located in a reservation near Sydney, at LeParouse, revealed that among
the Aborigines 47.5 per cent of the teeth had been attacked by dental
caries, and 40 per cent of the individuals had abnormal dental arches.
For the women of this group, 81.3 per cent of all the teeth had been
attacked by dental caries, and for the men, 60.4 per cent, and for the
children, 16.5 per cent. In this group 100 per cent of the individuals
were affected by dental caries.</p>

<p>    Palm Island is a government reservation situated in the ocean
about fifty miles from the mainland, off the east coast of Australia,
about two-thirds of the way up the coast. It was reached by a
government launch. Included in the population of this reservation are a
large number of adults who have been moved from various districts on
the mainland of Central and Eastern Australia and many children who
were born either before or after their parents were moved to this
reservation. The food available on the Island is almost entirely that
provided by the government. Of ninety-eight individuals examined and
measured, 53.1 per cent of them had dental caries. For the group as a
whole, 8.9 per cent of all of the teeth were affected; for the women,
21.2 per cent; for the men, 14.2 per cent; and for the children, 5.8
per cent. Fifty per cent of the children had deformed dental arches,
which occurred in only 11 per cent of the adults.</p>

<p>    Cape Bedford is situated about three-fourths of the way up the
east coast and is so isolated that it was necessary for us to use a
special aeroplane to reach it. Landing was made on the beach. This
group of people is under the management of a German Lutheran
missionary. They are dependent almost entirely on the food provided by
the mission and the government. The official in charge had spent fifty
years in devoted service to these native people. We found him
exceedingly sad because of the very rapid breakdown that was in
progress among the natives in his care. The dental caries for the group
of eighty-three individuals studied was 12.4 per cent of their 2,176
teeth examined. For the women, this amounted to 37.2 per cent of the
teeth; for the men, 8.4 per cent; and for the children, 6.1 per cent.
Of the eighty-three individuals, 48.1 per cent had been affected by
dental caries. Many of the adults in this group had been born on
plantations under the influence of the modern nutrition, and many of
the children had been born in the mission. For the adults, 46 per cent
had abnormally formed dental arches, and for the children, 41.6 per
cent. We were advised that deaths occurred very frequently from
tuberculosis. This reservation does not provide the natives with
natural hunting grounds capable of providing the people with animal
life for food. The coast for some distance inland is a series of sand
dunes which are slowly being transferred over the vegetation by wind,
completely smothering it. While the coast is well supplied with a
variety of deep-water fish the natives have practically no equipment
for obtaining them, a condition which restricts them very largely to
the use of the imported foods supplied by the officials.</p>

<p>    Our next stop, using the special aeroplane, was at Lockhart
River, which is about four-fifths of the way up the east coast of
Australia. Here again we were able to land on the beach near a large
group of primitive Aborigines. The isolation here is so nearly complete
that they are dependent upon the sea and the land for their foods. This
part of Australia, namely, the York Peninsula, is still so primitive
that there has been very little encroachment by the white population.
It will be remembered that in this area there are no roads, the country
being a primitive wilderness. Of fifty-eight individuals examined,
their 1,784 teeth revealed that only 4.3 per cent had been attacked by
dental caries. For the women, this amounted to 3.4 per cent; for the
men, 6.1 per cent; and for the children, 3.2 per cent. Some of these
men had at some time worked on cattle ranches for the white men. Of the
children, only 6.3 per cent had abnormal dental arches, and of the
adults, 8.7 per cent. In this group, therefore, 91.4 per cent of all
ages had reproduced the typical racial pattern as compared with 56 per
cent of the group at Cape Bedford, 62 per cent of the group at Palm
Island, and 60 per cent at LeParouse. At Lockhart River, 32.7 per cent
of the individuals had dental caries.</p>

<p>    A reservation called Cowall Creek on the west side of York
Peninsula situated on the Gulf of Carpenteria, was reached by flying
our special plane to Horn Island in the Torres Strait north of
Australia and proceeding from there by boat to Thursday Island, and on,
by boat, to Cowall Creek. In this reservation thirty-five individuals
were studied and found to be in a very pathetic condition. We were told
that deaths occurred frequently. Of the 976 teeth examined, 24.6 per
cent had been attacked by tooth decay. For the women, this amounted to
60.7 per cent; for the men, 30.4 per cent; and for the children, 8.9
per cent. Forty-nine and six-tenths per cent of the individuals studied
had abnormal dental arches. Of the children 66.6 per cent had deformed
dental arches, and 9 per cent of the adults. Many of these adults had
been raised in the bush. Of the individuals studied, 68.6 per cent had
had dental caries. One can scarcely visualize, without observing it,
the distress of a group of primitive people situated as these people
are, compelled to live in a very restricted area, forced to live on
food provided by the government, while they are conscious that if they
could return to their normal habits of life they would regain their
health and again enjoy life. Many individuals were seen with abscessing
teeth. One girl with a fistula exuding pus on the outside of her face
is shown in Fig. 58 (upper right). In their native life where they
could get the foods that keep them well and preserve their teeth, they
had no need for dentists. Now they have need, but have no dentists. It
is easy to chide and blame the officials who provide them with the
modernized foods under which they are breaking, but it must be
remembered that practically all modern civilizations are more or less
in the same plight themselves.</p>

<p>    An opportunity was provided for examining a group of the native
Aborigines of Australia who made up the crew of eighteen for a
pearl-fishing boat. Of this group, 5.7 per cent of their 554 teeth had
been attacked by tooth decay. These individuals could be readily
divided into two groups; namely, those who had been raised in the Bush
and those who had been raised in missions. For the thirteen raised in
the Bush, not a single tooth of their 364 teeth had ever been attacked
by tooth decay and not a single individual had deformed dental arches.
In contrast with this, of the five raised in the mission, 19.3 per cent
of their 140 teeth had been attacked by tooth decay and 40 per cent of
these individuals had abnormal dental arches.</p>

<p>    The cook on the government boat was an aboriginal Australian
from Northern Australia. He had been trained on a military craft as a
dietitian. Nearly all his teeth were lost. It is of interest that while
the native Aborigines had relatively perfect teeth, this man who was a
trained dietitian for the whites had lost nearly all his teeth from
tooth decay and pyorrhea.</p>

<p>    In the group of Aborigines so far reported, there were many who
had come from the interior districts of Australia and many who had
always lived near the coast. These two types of districts provided
quite different types of foods. Those near the coast were able to
obtain animal life from the sea, including fish, dugong or sea cow, a
great variety of shell fish, and some sea plants. Those from the
interior districts could not obtain animal life of the sea, but did
obtain animal life of the land which was eaten with their plant foods
in each case. It was quite important to reach a group of Aborigines who
had always lived inland and who were on a reservation inland. This
contact was made with the group at a government reservation called
Cherbourg. A typical group of individuals was examined. Of forty-five
individuals with 1,236 teeth, 42.5 per cent of the teeth had been
attacked by tooth decay. For the women, this constituted 43.7 per cent;
for the men, 64.6 per cent; and for the children, 5.6 per cent. Of all
of the individuals here examined 64.5 per cent had dental caries. It is
of interest that many of these men had worked on white men's cattle
ranches. While the adults showed 11.7 per cent to have deformed dental
arches, this rose to 50 per cent for the children of the group. We were
informed that in all of these groups tuberculosis was taking a very
heavy toll. In Fig. 58, upper left, will be seen a boy with a
superating tubercular gland of the axilla; at the right, a girl with a
fistula draining pus onto the outside of the face from an abscessed
tooth; below, deformed legs and a girl with tubercular glands of the
neck.</p>

<p>    A reservation situated on the coast where sea foods were
available might be expected to make available a particular type of
nutrition through sea foods. The individuals in a reservation for the
Aborigines at Tweed Heads, which is so situated, were studied. Of the
twenty-seven individuals examined, 89 per cent had dental caries. Of
their 774 teeth, 39.7 per cent had been attacked by dental caries. For
the women, this amounted to 62.5 per cent; for the men, 70.9 per cent;
and for the children, 20.8 per cent. Most of these children had been
born in this environment while their parents were being fed, largely,
the foods provided by the government and mission. In this group, 83.4
per cent of the children had deformed dental arches, and 33.3 per cent
of the adults.</p>

<p>    An interesting incident was brought to my attention in one of
the Australian reservations where the food was practically all supplied
by the government. I was told by the director in charge, and in further
detail by the other officials, that a number of native babies had
become ill while nursing from their mothers. Some had died. By changing
the nutrition to a condensed whole milk product, the babies recovered.
When placed back on their mother's breast food they again became ill.
The problem was: Why was not their mothers' milk adequate? I was later
told by the director of a condition that had developed in the pen of
the reservation's hogs which were kept to use up the scraps and garbage
from the reservation's kitchens. He reported that one after another the
hogs went down with a type of paralysis and could not get up. The
symptoms were suggestively like vitamin A deficiency in both the babies
and the hogs, and indicated the treatment.</p>

<p>    The rapid degeneration of the Australian Aborigines after the
adoption of the government's modern foods provides a demonstration that
should be infinitely more convincing than animal experimentation. It
should be a matter not only of concern but deep alarm that human beings
can degenerate physically so rapidly by the use of a certain type of
nutrition, particularly the dietary products used so generally by
modern civilization.</p>

<p>    The child life among the Aborigines of Australia proved to be
exceedingly interesting. Children develop independence very young and
learn very early to take care of themselves. Mothers are very
affectionate and show great concern when their children are not
thriving. Two typical mothers with their children are shown in Fig. 59.
These children, as suggested in the picture, were keenly interested in
everything that I did, but were not alarmed or frightened.</p>

<p>    The wonderful wisdom of these primitive people was attested by
the principal of the public school at Palm Island. A mother died and
her nursing infant was taken care of by its maternal grandmother, who
had not recently given birth to a child. She proceeded to carry out the
primitive formula for providing breast food by artificial means. Her
method was to make an ointment of the fresh bodies of an insect which
made its nest in the leaves of a certain tree. This she rubbed on her
breast and in a short time produced milk liberally for this foster
child. I was shown the type of insect, photographed its nest and the
colony inside when the nest was opened. The people who vouched for this
circumstance declared that they had seen the entire procedure and knew
the facts to be as stated. They further stated that this was common
knowledge among the Aborigines.</p>

<p>    Another important source of information regarding the Aborigines
of Australia was provided by a study of the skeletal material and
skulls in the museums at Sydney and Canberra, particularly the former.
I do not know the number of skulls that are available there for study,
but it is very large. I examined many and found them remarkably uniform
in design and quality. The dental arches were splendidly formed. The
teeth were in excellent condition with exceedingly little dental
caries. A characteristic of these skulls was the evidence of a shortage
of material for those that had been transferred to a museum from the
interior arid plains country. Those skulls, however, that had come from
coastal areas where sea foods were available, show much more massive
dimensions of the general pattern. In Fig. 60 will be seen typical
skulls showing the normal dental arches and general design of the head.
It is of interest to note the very heavy orbital ridges which
characterize this race.</p>

<p>    I have previously referred to a report by Professor Weidenreich
regarding the resemblance of the Australian native's skulls to those of
the recently discovered Peking man in the caves of China. In Fig. 60
are two views for comparison. The skull at the left is that of an
Australian primitive photographed in a museum in Sydney, and an outline
of the Peking skull is shown at the right. Professor Weidenreich has
emphasized the observations that when three skulls are put in series,
namely, the Australian primitive, the Peking skull and a chimpanzee
skull, the Peking skull appears to be about half way between the two in
design and developmental order. The Australian primitive's skull is
higher in the crown, showing much greater brain capacity. The
supra-orbital depressions are less deep in the Peking than in the
chimpanzee, and still less deep in the Australian primitive. The
supra-orbital ridges which produce the prominent eyebrows are less
pronounced in the Australian primitive than in the Peking man, and
still more prominent in the chimpanzee. The prominent supra-orbital
ridges of the chimpanzee face are shown in Fig. 48.</p>

<p>    The age of the Peking skulls has been variously placed from
several hundred thousand to a million years. A distinguished
anthropologist has stated that the Australian primitives are the only
people living on the earth today that could be part of the first race
of mankind. It is a matter of concern that if a scale were extended a
mile long and the decades represented by inches, there would apparently
be more degeneration in the last few inches than in the preceding mile.
This gives some idea of the virulence of the blight contributed by our
modern civilization.</p>

<p>    The foods available for these people are exceedingly limited in
variety and quantity, due to the absence of rains, and unfertility of
the soil. For plant foods they used roots, stems, leaves, berries and
seeds of grasses and a native pea eaten with tissues of large and small
animals. The large animals available are the kangaroo and wallaby.
Among the small animals they have a variety of rodents, insects,
beetles and grubs, and wherever available various forms of animal life
from the rivers and oceans. Birds and birds' eggs are used where
available. They are able to balance their rations to provide the
requisites for splendid body building and body repair. In several parts
of Australia, which originally supported a large population of the
primitives, none are left except a few score in reservations. These
also are rapidly disappearing. Their fertility has been so greatly
reduced that the death rate far exceeds the birth rate.</p>

<p>    This group provides evidence of exceptional efficiency in
obeying the laws of Nature through thousands of years, even in a
parched land that is exceedingly inhospitable because of the scant
plant foods for either men or animals. While the Aborigines are
credited with being the oldest race on the face of the earth today,
they are dying out with great rapidity wherever they have changed their
native nutrition to that of the modern white civilization. For them
this is not a matter of choice, but rather of necessity, since in a
large part of Australia the few that are left are crowded into
reservations where they have little or no access to native foods and
are compelled to live on the foods provided for them by our white
civilization. They demonstrate in a tragic way the inadequacy of the
white man's dietary programs.</p>

<p><font size="+3">I</font>N STUDYING the relationship between
nutrition and physical characteristics, it is important to make
observations at the point of contact with civilization where as few
factors as possible in the environment have been modified by that
contact. My previous studies have shown that wherever groups of people
were utilizing sea foods abundantly in connection with land plants
including roots, greens and fruits, they enjoyed fine physical
development with uniform reproduction of the racial pattern and a very
high immunity to dental caries. For this particular study we wished to
select a racial group living on islands in tropical or subtropical
climate, whose ancestral stocks differed from those previously
observed, and which was located at points of contact with modern
civilization. A high level of excellence might be expected among the
groups who were in process of being modernized but were still utilizing
the native foods.</p>

<p>    For this study the inhabitants of islands north of Australia
were chosen in order to record the effect on the Asiatic and Malay
stocks at the points of contact of the north with the south and of the
east with the west. In the Torres Strait there are a number of fertile
islands supporting populations of from several hundred to a few
thousand individuals each. These groups are in an area of the sea that
is well stocked with sea animal life, and during the past they have
been sufficiently isolated to provide protection. The racial stocks
have retained their identities and include Papuans, New Guineans,
Mobuiags, Arakuns, Kendals and Yonkas. The splendid dental arches of
these groups will be seen in the various illustrations. Many of the
girls are quite prepossessing, as may be seen in Fig. 61.</p>

<p>    With the valuable assistance of the officials of the Australian
Government we were able to make investigations on several islands in
the Torres Strait. The local administrator provided us with a
government boat and personal introductions to the local chief and local
representatives of the government. We were accompanied by the
administrator and by the general manager of the government stores.
These stores have been located on the various islands, and the profit
derived from them is used for administrative expenses of the
government. They provide modern clothing in addition to foods, chiefly
white flour, polished rice, canned goods, and sugar. Studies were made
on the various islands in the order in which the stores had been
installed on them. It is important to have in mind the nature of these
islands. Some are of volcanic origin and have rugged interiors with
deep bays; others are of coral origin. All are in a zone that is
abundantly supplied with sea animal life, this being the scene of the
richest pearl fishing industry in the world.</p>

<p>    Badu Island had had the store for the longest period, namely
twenty-three years. Of the 586 teeth of twenty individuals examined,
20.6 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay. Of the individuals
examined 95 per cent had dental caries. Unfortunately, our stay at this
island was accompanied by a torrential downpour which made it very
difficult for us to carry forward our investigations. Had we been able
to examine the mothers the figures doubtless would have been much
higher. The children were examined at the school and showed 18.8 per
cent of the teeth to have been attacked by tooth decay. The men
examined showed 21.9 per cent. Figures given me by Dr. Gibson, who had
been taken by the government to the island to make extractions, showed
that he found as high as 60 per cent of the teeth had been attacked by
tooth decay. For the children of this group, 33.3 per cent had abnormal
dental arches, whereas only 9.1 per cent of the adults' arches were
abnormally formed.</p>

<p>    On York Island, 1,876 teeth of sixty-five individuals showed
that 12.7 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay. For the women,
this was 20.2 per cent; for the men, 12.1 per cent; and for the
children, 7 per cent. For the children, 47.1 per cent had abnormal
dental arches; for the adults, 27 per cent were affected. The
individuals on this island had been in contact with the pearl fisheries
industry for several years. Several of the men had been working on the
fishing boat. Of the sixtyfive individuals examined, 67.6 per cent had
dental caries.</p>

<p>    On Darnley Island, thirty-three individuals showed that of their
900 teeth 5.7 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay. The store had
been established on this island recently. For the women, 16.6 per cent
of the teeth had been attacked; for the men, 6.3 per cent; and for the
children, 4.1 per cent. On this island, 29.6 per cent of the children
showed abnormal dental arches, and 14.3 per cent of the adults. Of the
whole group, 46.1 per cent had been attacked by dental caries.</p>

<p>    On Murray Island where a store had recently been established, of
the 1,074 teeth examined for 39 individuals, only 0.7 per cent of the
teeth had been attacked by tooth decay. For the women, this amounted to
2 per cent; for the men, 1.7 per cent; and for the children, 0.26 per
cent. Only 12.8 per cent of the group had dental caries. It is
significant that the natives were conscious of a danger from the
presence on the island of a store providing imported foods. This had
been so serious a problem that there was a question whether it would be
safe for us to land, since on the last visit of the government
officials, blood was almost shed because of the opposition of the
natives to the government s program. The result of our examination
indicates that dental caries on these islands shows an incidence which
has an apparent direct relationship to the length of time government
stores have been established there. The immunity to dental caries on
this island is nearly 100 per cent. Of the adults, 14.3 per cent had
abnormal dental arches, and of the children, 34.4 per cent.</p>

<p>    Thursday Island is the location of the administrative center for
the group. Although it is the best sheltered harbor and affords
protection for small boats in the Torres Strait, it was not originally
inhabited by the natives. They considered it unfit for habitation
because the soil was so poor that it could not provide the proper plant
foods to be eaten with the sea foods which are abundant about all of
the islands. Nearly all of the whites inhabiting the islands of this
district live on this island. They are the families of the
administrative officers and of merchants who are engaged in the pearl
industry. Owing to the infertility of the soil, practically all of the
food has to be shipped in except the little that the whites obtain from
the sea. On the island there were many native families, with children
attending the native school, while their fathers worked in the pearling
fleets. Thirty individuals in three fleets were examined, and of their
960 teeth only thirty-five had been attacked by dental caries, or 3.6
per cent. Of these thirty individuals, five, or 16.3 per cent had
abnormal dental arches. The men who had teeth attacked by dental caries
informed me that this had happened after they had engaged on the
pearling vessels and began to use the foods provided there. In the
native school on Thursday Island twenty-three children were examined.
They were living in homes in which a considerable part of the food was
purchased at the company stores. The incidence of tooth decay was 12.2
per cent of their 664 teeth. Many of these Thursday Island children had
been born since their parents had begun using the commercial foods
provided to the islanders. Among twenty-three individuals, 43.5 per
cent had abnormal dental arches.</p>

<p>    While these investigations were planned and carried out
primarily to obtain data on the condition of the native races in
contact with modern white civilization, wherever possible, data were
obtained on the whites also. In a school for whites on Thursday Island,
fifty children were examined with regard to their dental arches, but an
embarrassing situation was encountered with regard to the sensitiveness
of the whites in the matter of having their children examined for
dental caries. Figures were obtained for the facial development which
reveal that, out of the fifty children examined, 64 per cent had
irregularities of facial and dental arch development. In the upper half
of Fig. 62, will be seen a group of children photographed in the native
school, and in the lower a group of white girls photographed at the
white school. The difference in their facial development is readily
seen. The son of the white teacher (Fig. 66, left) had marked under
development of his face. The white population lived largely on canned
food.</p>

<p>    Hammond Island adloins Thursday Island sufficiently close by to
be easily reached in small boats. Accordingly, the people of this
island have access to the stores of the white settlement on Thursday
Island. Unlike Thursday Island, Hammond Island is quite fertile. Of
twenty-seven individuals, all of native stock, 16.5 per cent of their
732 teeth had been attacked by dental caries, and 40 per cent of the
individuals showed some deformity of the dental arches. After examining
the children at the mission school, I inquired whether there were not
families on the island that were living entirely isolated from contact
with modern influences. I was taken to the far side of the island to an
isolated family. This family had continued to live on their own
resources. They were raising vegetables including bananas, pumpkins,
and pawpaws. In the cases of the three girls in the family, one with a
child five months of age, only six of their eighty-four teeth had been
attacked by tooth decay, or 7.1 per cent, as compared with 16.5 per
cent for the entire group on this island. These three girls all had
normally developed dental arches and normal features. Three of the
girls are shown in Fig. 63. We inquired about the mother and were told
that she was out fishing, notwithstanding the fact that the sea was
quite rough. While we were there, she came in with two fish (Fig. 63).
Here was one of the principal secrets of their happiness and success in
life. The Catholic priest who had charge of the mission on this island
told me that this family practically never asked for assistance of any
kind, and was always in a position to help others. They were happy and
well nourished. It is important to note that the progressive
degeneration in facial form which occurred in many of the families on
the other islands was not found in this family.</p>

<p>    The incidence of dental caries ranged from 20.6 per cent of all
of the teeth examined for the various age groups on Badu Island to 0.7
per cent, on Murray Island. A group of individuals from this island
will be seen in Fig. 64. Note the remarkable width of the dental
arches. Note also in this connection that the natives of this island
are conscious of the superior food of their locality and wish that
their people were not required to purchase food from the government
store. The island is situated on the Barrier Reef and has an abundant
supply of small fish. The swarms of fish are often so dense that the
natives throw a spear with several prongs into the school of fish and
when the spear is drawn back, there are several fish on it. This
condition provides abundant food for sharks many of which could be seen
surrounding the schools of small fish. Encircling the group, they
dashed in, mouths open and gorged themselves with the mass of fish from
the water. It seemed quite remarkable that the people were willing to
go into the water to spear the fish within the zone frequently
approached by the sharks, but I was told by the natives that when the
fish are so abundant the sharks never attack human beings. One of the
natives rowed me in his canoe to a point where I could photograph the
sharks at close range. To show his disdain for the shark, he had no
hesitancy in standing up in the end of the canoe and hurling his spear
into the side of the monster. The spear was immediately thrown out by
the shark, which had not been frightened sufficiently to make it leave
the scene of action. The sharks in my pictures were swimming so close
to the shore that the upper part of the tail was forced out of the
water, also the back fin, in order to clear the bottom. It was a great
revelation to watch the movement of the tail. Instead of swinging it
from side to side like other fish, with which I was familiar, the shark
would rotate its tail half or three quarters of a turn in a motion like
that of a propeller of a boat, then reverse the motion for the return
trip. By a sudden increase of speed in this motion, the shark could
dart ahead at a rapid rate, corral the small fish by encircling them,
and finally make a dash through the school with its mouth open.
Hundreds of the small fish, in order to escape, dart out of the water
into the air. This exposes them to the birds, a flock of which follows
the sharks when they are feeding on the fish. The birds dive down at
the time they see the shark making his raid and catch the small fish as
they dart out of the water. It is by the birds of prey that the native
fishermen from their lookout locate the schools of fish. While there is
a difference of opinion as to whether some species of shark will attack
human beings, we saw one pearl diver who bore enormous scars received
from the jaws of a shark.</p>

<p>    The procedure on one island is to snare the sharks by calling
them by means of special sounds made by clapping together two large
half shells on the surface of the water. This attracts the shark, and
then the men one at a time go into the water with a sharp stick with
which they guard themselves against attack. A noose made of rope of
coconut fiber is slipped over the shark's head and over the back fin.
It is then allowed to tire out and is brought to shore. It was not
unusual in a good season for the shark fishers to bring in three or
four in a night's fishing. The strength of the native swimmers is
almost beyond belief. The pearling boats are frequently in great danger
of being dashed to pieces on a coral reef, since in those waters gales
of fifty miles an hour are frequent. We experienced some such gales. On
one occasion, when a pearling boat was wrecked some distance from an
exposed rock, one strong swimmer rescued and helped two dozen of the
crew to the rock, and was himself rescued after being in the water
continuously for thirty-two hours. The pearling boats feed their crew
largely on commercial provisions. When the men have been continuously
on the boats for one or two years, or often when they have been at sea
using this food for six months, they have rampant tooth decay. When the
cavities approach or reach the pulp chambers the pain produced in the
teeth by the high pressure in deep water produces such agony that they
often have to give up pearling.</p>

<p>    Physical characteristics of all these residents of the Torres
Strait Islands, regardless of their tribal group, were, sturdy
development throughout their bodies, broad dental arches, and for all
of those who had always lived only on their native food, a close
proximity to one hundred per cent immunity to dental caries. These men
are natural mariners. They do not hesitate to make long trips even in
rough seas in their homemade crafts. They have an uncanny skill in
determining the location of invisible coral reefs. They relate the
height of the swell as it rolls over the reef to particular color tones
in the water, all of which were too vague for me to see even when they
were pointed out.</p>

<p>    Among the inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands, almost all
individuals who had been born before the foods of modern civilization
had become available were found to have dental arches normal in form.
In many families, however, living on islands where a store had been
established for some time, and on Thursday Island where imported foods
had been available for several decades, many individuals were found who
had been born since the use of imported foods. They had gross
deformities of the dental arches. This fact is illustrated in Fig. 65
in which typical depression of the laterals and narrowing of the upper
arch and abnormal prominence of the cuspids due to the lack of space
for the normal eruption may be seen. The facial deformity in two white
boys is seen in Fig. 66. Rampant tooth decay in white children is shown
in Fig. 67.</p>

<p>    We are particularly concerned with data that will throw light on
the nature of the forces responsible for the production of these
deformities. Since they do not appear to their full extent until the
eruption of the permanent teeth as part of the development of the
adult, it is easy for the abnormality to be ascribed to the period of
child growth. As a result, it has been related to faulty breathing
habits, thumb sucking, posture, or sleeping habits, of the child.</p>

<p>    It would be difficult to find a more happy and contented people
than the primitives in the Torres Strait Islands as they lived without
contact with modern civilization. Indeed, they seem to resent very
acutely the modern intrusion. They not only have nearly perfect bodies,
but an associated personality and character of a high degree of
excellence. One is continually impressed with happiness, peace and
health while in their congenial presence.</p>

<p>    These people are not lazy, but they do not struggle over hard to
obtain food. Necessities that are not readily at hand they do not have.
Their home life reaches a very high ideal and among them there is
practically no crime.</p>

<p>    In their native state they have exceedingly little disease. Dr.
J. R. Nimmo, the government physician in charge of the supervision of
this group, told me in his thirteen years with them he had not seen a
single case of malignancy, and had seen only one that he had suspected
might be malignancy among the entire four thousand native population.
He stated that during this same period he had operated several dozen
malignancies for the white population, which numbers about three
hundred. He reported that among the primitive stock other affections
requiring surgical interference were rare.</p>

<p>    The environment of the Torres Strait Islanders provides a very
liberal supply of sea foods and fertile islands on which an adequate
quantity of tropical plants are readily grown. Taro, bananas, papaya,
and plums are all grown abundantly. The sea foods include large and
small fish in great abundance, dugong, and a great variety of
shellfish. These foods have developed for them remarkable physiques
with practically complete immunity to dental caries. Wherever they have
adopted the white man's foods, however, they suffer the typical
expressions of degeneration, such as, loss of immunity to dental
caries; and in the succeeding generations there is a marked change in
facial and dental arch form with marked lowering of resistance to
disease.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED NEW ZEALAND
MAORI</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">B</font>ECAUSE of the fine reputation of the racial
stock in its primitive condition, it was with particular interest that
studies were made in New Zealand. Pickerill <font size="-2">(1)</font>
has made a very extensive study of the New Zealand Maori, both by
examination of the skulls and by examination of the relatively
primitive living Maori. He states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    In an examination of 250 Maori skulls--all from
an uncivilized age--I found carious teeth present in only two skulls or
0.76 per cent. By taking the average of Mummery's and my own
investigations, the incidence of caries in the Maori is found to be 1.2
per cent in a total of 326 skulls. This is lower even than the
Esquimaux, and shows the Maori to have been the most immune race to
caries, for which statistics are available.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Comparing these figures with those applicable to
the present time, we find that the descendants of the Britons and
Anglo-Saxons are afflicted with dental caries to the extent of 86 per
cent to 98 per cent; and after examining fifty Maori school children
living under European conditions entirely, I found that 95 per cent of
them had decayed teeth.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    It will be noted that the basis of computation in the above is
percentage of individuals with caries. I am using in addition to these
figures the percentage of teeth attacked by dental caries. Expressed in
percentage of teeth affected the figure for Pickerill's group would be
0.05 or 1 in 2,000 teeth.</p>

<p>    We were deeply indebted to the government officials in New
Zealand for their invaluable assistance. In anticipation of making
these studies I had been in correspondence with the officials for over
two years. When we arrived at Auckland, New Zealand, on our way to
Australia, our ship was in port for one day. We were met by Colonel
Saunders, Director of Oral Hygiene in the New Zealand Department of
Public Health who had been sent from the capitol at Wellington to offer
assistance. A personal representative of the Government was sent as
guide, and transportation to the various Maori settlements in which we
wished to make our studies was provided.</p>

<p>    New Zealand is setting a standard for the world in the care of
growing children as well as in many other health problems. A large
percentage of the schools in New Zealand are provided with dental
service. A specially trained woman was in charge of the work in each
school under Colonel Saunders' supervision. The operations performed by
these young women on children far exceeded in quality the average that
I have seen by dentists in America. Their plan gives dental care to
children twelve years of age and under, provided the parents express a
wish that their children receive that care. The service was being
extended rapidly to all communities. Since my return, I have learned
that the work is being organized to provide for every community of New
Zealand. The art of the Maori gives evidence of their great ability and
skill in sculpturing. Boys and girls do beautiful carving and weaving.
All native buildings and structures are embellished with carvings often
in fine detail.</p>

<p>    It was most gratifying to find neat and well-appointed dental
office buildings for both natives and whites, located beside a large
number of the public schools throughout New Zealand. In many
communities two or three schools were served by the same operator.
Children were either brought to the central dental infirmary or
provision was made for an operating room in the vicinity of each
school. The operator went from district to district. A typical dental
infirmary is shown in Fig. 68, with Colonel Saunders and one of his
efficient women operators in the foreground. I had suggested that I
should be glad to have observers from the Department of Health
accompany us or arrange to be present at convenient places to observe
the conditions and to note my interpretations of them. From two to five
such observers were generally present, including the official
representative of the department. The planning of the itinerary was
very greatly assisted by a Maori member of Parliament, Mr. Aparana
Ngata.</p>

<p>    Although New Zealand is a new country with a relatively small
population, there being approximately only a million and a half
individuals, the building of highways has rapidly been extended to
include all modernized sections. In order to reach the most remote
groups it was often necessary to go beyond the zone of public
improvements and follow quite primitive trails. Fortunately this was
possible because it was the dry season. Even then many streams had to
be forded, which would have been quite impossible at other seasons of
the year. We were able to average approximately a hundred miles of
travel per day for eighteen days, visiting twenty-five districts and
making examinations of native Maori families and children in native
schools, representing various stages of modernization. This included a
few white schools and tubercular sanitariums.</p>

<p>    Since over 95 per cent of the New Zealanders are to be found in
the North Island, our investigations were limited to this island. Our
itinerary started at Wellington at the south end of the North Island
and progressed northward in such a way as to reach both the principal
centers of native population who were modernized and those who were
more isolated. This latter group, however, was a small part of the
total native population. Detailed examinations including measurements
and photographic records were made in twenty-two groups consisting
chiefly of the older children in public schools. In the examination of
535 individuals in these twenty-two school districts their 15,332 teeth
revealed that 3,420 had been attacked by dental caries or 22.3 per
cent. In the most modernized groups 31 to 50 per cent had dental
caries. In the most isolated group only 2 per cent of the teeth had
been attacked by dental caries. The incidence of deformity of dental
arches in the modernized groups ranged from 40 to 100 per cent. In many
districts members of the older generations revealed 100 per cent
normally formed dental arches. The children of these individuals,
however, showed a much higher percentage of deformed dental arches.</p>

<p>    These data are in striking contrast with the condition of the
teeth and dental arches of the skulls of the Maori before contact with
the white man and the reports of examinations by early scientists who
made contact with the primitive Maori before he was modernized. These
reports revealed only one tooth in 2000 teeth attacked by dental caries
with practically 100 per cent normally formed dental arches.</p>

<p>    My investigations were made in the following places in the North
Island. The Pukerora Tubercular Sanatorium provided forty native Maori
for studies. These were largely young men and women and being in a
modern institution they were receiving the modern foods of the whites
of New Zealand. Their modernization was demonstrated not only by the
high incidence of dental caries but also by the fact that 90 per cent
of the adults and 100 per cent of the children had abnormalities of the
dental arches.</p>

<p>    The Hukarera College for Maori girls is at Napier. These girls
were largely from modernized native homes and were now living in a
modern institution. Their modernization was expressed in the high
percentage of dental caries and their deformed dental arches.</p>

<p>    At the Nuhaka school an opportunity was provided through the
assistance of the government officials to study the parents of many of
the children. Tooth decay was wide-spread among the women and active
among both the men and children.</p>

<p>    The Mahia Peninsula provided one of the more isolated groups
which showed a marked difference between the older generation and the
new. These people had good access to sea foods and those still using
these abundantly had much the best teeth. A group of the children who
had been born and raised in this district and who had lived largely on
the native foods had only 1.7 per cent of their teeth attacked by
dental caries.</p>

<p>    The other places studied were Raukokore, Tekaha, Rautoki,
Rotarua, Tehoro, Waiomio, Teahuahu, Kaikohe, Whakarara, Mautauri Bay,
Ahipara, Manukau, Rawena, Ellerslie, Queen Victoria School at Auckland
and Waipawa.</p>

<p>    New Zealand has become justly famous for its scenery. The South
Island has been frequently termed the Southern Alps because of its
snow-capped mountains and glaciers. Of the 70,000 members of the Maori
race living in the two islands, about 2000 are on the South Island and
the balance on the North Island. While snow is present on many of the
mountains of the North Island in the winter season, only a few of the
higher peaks are snow capped during the summer. Most of the shoreline
of the seacoast of the South Island is very rugged, with glaciers
descending almost to the sea. The coastline of the North Island is
broken and in places is quite rugged. The approach to the Mahia
Peninsula is along a rocky coast skirting the bay. The most important
industries of New Zealand are dairy products, and sheep raising for
wool.</p>

<p>    The reputation of the Maori people for splendid physiques has
placed them on a pedestal of perfection. Much of this has been lost in
modernization. However, through the assistance of the government, I was
able to see many excellent physical specimens. In Fig. 69 will be seen
four typical Maori who retained much of the tribal excellence. Note
their fine dental arches. A young Maori man who stands about six feet
four inches and weighs 230 pounds was examined. The Maori men have
great physical endurance and good minds. Many fine lawyers and
government executives are Maori. The breakdown of these people comes
when they depart from their native foods to the foods of modern
civilization, foods consisting largely of white flour, sweetened goods,
syrup and canned goods. The effect is similar to that experienced by
other races after using foods of modern civilization. Typical
illustrations of tooth decay are shown in Fig. 70. In some individuals
still in their teens half of the teeth were decayed. The tooth decay
among the whites of New Zealand and Australia was severe. This is
illustrated in Fig. 71. Particularly striking is the similarity between
the deformities of the dental arches which occur in the Maori people
who were born after their parents adopted the modern foods, and those
of the whites. This is well illustrated in Fig. 72 for Maori boys. In
my studies among other modernized primitive racial stocks, there was a
very high incidence of facial deformity, which approached one hundred
per cent among individuals in tuberculosis sanatoria. This condition
obtained also in New Zealand.</p>

<p>    One of the most important developments to come out of these
investigations of primitive races is the evidence of a rapid decline in
maternal reproductive efficiency after an abandonment of the native
foods and the substitution of foods of modern civilization. This is
discussed in later chapters.</p>

<p>    It was particularly instructive to observe the diligence with
which some of the isolated Maori near the coast sought out certain
types of food in accordance with the tradition and accumulated wisdom
of their tribes. As among the various archipelagos and island dwellers
of the Pacific, great emphasis was placed upon shell fish. Much effort
was made to obtain these in large quantities. In Fig. 74 (lower), will
be seen two boys who have been gathering sea clams found abundantly on
these shores. Much of the fishing is done when the tide is out. Some
groups used large quantities of the species called abalone on the West
Coast of America and paua in New Zealand. In Fig. 74 (upper), a man,
his wife and child are shown. The father is holding an abalone; the
little girl is holding a mollusk found only in New Zealand, the
toharoa; the mother is holding a plate of edible kelp which these
people use abundantly, as do many sea bordering races. Maori boys enjoy
a species of grubs which they seek with great eagerness and prize
highly. The primitive Maori use large quantities of fern root which
grows abundantly and is very nutritious.</p>

<p>    Probably few primitive races have developed calisthenics and
systematic physical exercise to so high a point as the primitive Maori.
On arising early in the morning, the chief of the village starts
singing a song which is accompanied by a rhythmic dance. This is taken
up not only by the members of his household, but by all in the
adjoining households until the entire village is swaying in unison to
the same tempo. This has a remarkably beneficial effect in not only
developing deep breathing, but in developing the muscles of the body,
particularly those of the abdomen, with the result that these people
maintain excellent figures to old age.</p>

<p>    Sir Arbuthnot Lane <font size="-2">(2)</font> said of this
practice the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    As to daily exercise, it is shown here that
every person capable of movement can benefit by it, and I am certain
that the only natural and really beneficial system of exercise is that
developed through long ages by the New Zealand Maori and their
race-brothers in other lands.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>   The practical application of their wisdom is discussed in Chapter
21.</p>

<p>    The Maori race developed a knowledge of Nature's laws and
adopted a system of living in harmony with those laws to so high a
degree that they were able to build what was reported by early
scientists to be the most physically perfect race living on the face of
the earth. They accomplished this largely through diet and a system of
social organization designed to provide a high degree of perfection in
their offspring. To do this they utilized foods from the sea very
liberally. The fact that they were able to maintain an immunity to
dental caries so high that only one tooth in two thousand had been
attacked by tooth decay (which is probably as high a degree of immunity
as that of any contemporary race) is a strong argument in favor of
their plan of life.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS OF
PERU</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">I</font>N THE foregoing field studies among
primitive races we have been dealing chiefly with living groups. Since
the West Coast of South America has been the home of several ancient
cultures, it is important that they be included with the living
remnants of primitive racial stocks, in order to note the contributions
that they may make to the problem of modern degeneration. The
relationship between the Andes Mountain Range and the coast and the sea
currents is such that there has been created a zone, ranging from forty
to one hundred miles in width between the coast and the mountains,
which for a distance of over a thousand miles is completely arid. The
air currents drifting westward across South America from the Atlantic
carry an abundance of moisture. When they strike the eastern foothills
of the Andes they are projected upward into a region of constant cold
which causes the moisture to be precipitated as rain on the eastern
slopes, and as snow on the eastern Cordillera Range. Hence the name of
the eastern range is the White Cordillera, and that of the western
range, which receives little of this rain, is the Black Cordillera.
Between these two ranges is a great plain, which in the rainy season is
well watered. The great civilizations of the past have always utilized
water from the melting snow through irrigation ditches with the result
that a vast acreage was put to agricultural uses.</p>

<p>    The Humboldt Current which sweeps northward from the southern
ice fields and carries its chilly water almost to the equator has
influenced the development of the West Coast of South America. The
effect of the current on the climate is generally noticeable. One of
the conspicuous results is the presence of a cloud bank which hovers
over the coastal area at an altitude of from one thousand to three
thousand feet above sea level for several months of the year. Back from
the coast these clouds rest on the land and constitute a nearly
constant fog for extended periods. When one passes inland from the
coast up the mountains he moves from a zone which in winter is clammy
and chilly, into the fog zone, and then suddenly out of it into clear
sky and brilliant sunlight. It is of interest that the capital, Lima,
is so situated that it suffers from this unhappy cloud and fog
situation. When Pizarro sent a commission to search out a location for
his capital city the natives commented on the fact that he was
selecting a very undesirable location. Either on the coast or farther
inland than Lima the climate is much more favorable, and these were the
locations in which the ancient civilizations have left some very
elaborate foundations of fortresses and extended residential areas. The
great expanse of desert extending from the coast to the mountains, with
its great moving sand dunes and with scarcely a sign of green life, is
one of the least hospitable environments that any culture could choose.
Notwithstanding this, the entire coast is a succession of ancient
burial mounds in which it is estimated that there are fifteen million
mummies in an excellent state of preservation. The few hundred thousand
that have been disturbed by grave robbers in search of gold and silver,
have been left bleaching on the sands. Where had these people come from
and why were they buried here? The answer is to be found in the fact
that probably few locations in the world provided such an inexhaustible
supply of food for producing a good culture as did this area. The lack
of present appreciation of this fact is evidenced by the absence of
flourishing modern communities, notwithstanding the almost continuous
chain of ancient walls, fortresses, habitations, and irrigation systems
to be found along this coast. The Humboldt Current coming from the ice
fields of the Antarctic carries with it a prodigious quantity of the
chemical food elements that are most effective in the production of a
vast population of fish. Probably no place in the world provides as
great an area teeming with marine life. The ancient cultures
appreciated the value of these sea foods and utilized them to the full.
They realized also that certain land plants should be eaten with the
sea foods. Accordingly, they constructed great aqueducts used in
transporting the water, sometimes a hundred miles, for the purpose of
irrigating river bottoms which had been collecting the alluvial soil
from the Andes through past ages. These river beds are to be found from
twenty to fifty miles apart and many of them are entirely dry except in
the rainy season in the high Andes. In the river bottoms these ancient
cultures grew large quantities of corn, beans, squash, and other
plants. These plant foods were gathered, stored, and eaten with sea
foods. The people on the coast had direct communication with the people
in the high plateaus. It is of more than passing interest that some
twenty-one of our modern food plants apparently came from Peru.</p>

<p>    Where there is such a quantity of animal life in the sea in the
form of fish one would expect to find the predatory animals that live
on fish. One group of these attack the fish from the air and they
constitute the great flock of guanayes, piqueros and pelicans. For a
thousand miles along the coast, these fish-eating birds are to be seen
in great winding queues going to and fro between the fishing grounds
and their nesting places. At other times they may be seen in great
clouds, beyond computation in number, fishing over an area of many
square miles. On one island I was told by the caretaker that
twenty-four million birds had their nests there. We passed through a
flock of the birds fishing, which the caretaker estimated to contain
between four and five million birds. On one island I found it
impossible to step anywhere, off the path, without treading on birds'
nests. It is of interest that a product of these birds has constituted
one of the greatest sources of wealth in the past for Peru, namely, the
guano, which is the droppings of the birds left on the islands along
the coast where they have their nests. Through the centuries these
deposits have reached to a depth of 100 feet in places. When it is
realized that only one-fifth of the droppings are placed on the
islands, it immediately raises the great question as to the quantity of
fish consumed by these birds. As high as seventy-five fish have been
found in the digestive tract of a single bird. The quantity of fish
consumed per day by the birds nesting on this one island has been
estimated to be greater than the entire catch of fish off the New
England coast per day.</p>

<p>    In addition to the birds, a vast number of sea lions and seals
live on the fish. The sea lions have a rookery in the vicinity of Santa
Island, which was estimated to contain over a million. These enormous
animals devour great quantities of fish. It would be difficult to
estimate how far the fish destroyed by this one group of sea lions
would go toward providing excellent nutrition for the entire population
of the United States. The guano, consisting of the partially digested
animal life of the sea, constitutes what is probably the best known
fertilizer in the world. It is thirty-three times as efficient as the
best barnyard manure. At one time it was sent in shiploads to Europe
and the United States, but now the Peruvian Government is retaining
nearly all of it for local use. They have locked the barn door after
the horse was stolen, figuratively speaking, since the accumulation of
ages had been carried off by shiploads to other countries before its
export was checked. At the present time all islands are under guard and
the birds are protected. They are coming back into many of the islands
from which they had been driven and are re-nesting. Birds are given two
or three years of undisturbed life for producing deposits. These are
then carefully removed from the surface of the islands and the birds
are allowed to remain undisturbed for another period.</p>

<p>   A very important and fortunate phase of the culture of the
primitive races of the coast has been their method of burial. Bodies
are carefully wrapped in many layers of raiment often beautifully spun.
With the mummies articles of special interest and value are usually
buried. Implements used by the individuals in their lifetime were also
put in the grave. With a fisherman there were placed his nets and
fishing tackle. Almost always, jars containing foods to supply him on
his journey in the transition to a future life were left in the tomb.
In some of the cultures the various domestic and industrial scenes were
reproduced in pottery. These disclosed a great variety of foods which
are familiar to us today. Even the designs of their habitations were
reproduced in pottery. Similarly their methods of performing surgical
operations, in which they were very skillful, were depicted.
Fortunately, the different cultures had quite different types of
pottery as well as quite different types of clothing. This makes it
possible to identify various groups and indicate the boundaries of
their habitations.</p>

<p>    Their engineering feats disclosed skill in planning fortresses.
Their forts were probably impregnable from assault in that day. The
materials used for building their temples, abodes, and fortifications
differ somewhat in various locations. Throughout the greater extent of
the coast of Peru, the walls of buildings were made of adobe often many
feet thick and sometimes sixty feet high. They had walled cities
protected by inner and outer lines of fortifications. It is
particularly significant that the hardest metals that they are known to
have had were copper and bronze. Silver and gold were quite plentiful.
Their surgical instruments were flints and the operations that they
were able to perform with these instruments were very remarkable. An
important instrument in warfare consisted of a club with a star on the
end made of copper or stone. With this the opponent's skull was crushed
in. One of the amazing features in the various collections of skulls is
the large number that show the results of surgical operations. These
operations were apparently done for the purpose of saving the life of
the individual. The procedure was to remove a section of bone in the
center of the depressed area and raise the depressed edges surrounding
that area. The fact that a large number of these show abundant evidence
of healing and repair clearly indicates that the individual lived for
an extended period following the operation. In some cases, the opening
is apparently entirely closed in with new bone. Some of these
trepanning operations removed a quantity of bone over an area large
enough for a human hand to pass through. A group of these operated
skulls are shown in Fig. 75. The owner of the one on the lower row,
left, probably died following the operation, as there is no evidence of
repair. The others show good healing, which in some is very extensive.
A study of these trephined skulls reveals that 62 per cent lived for
months or years. In Fig. 75 (lower right), is seen a skull which shows
a large operation. A part of the surgical procedure was to place a
plate of gold over the opening in the skull for protection. One of
these is shown in the upper half of Fig. 76. Below is shown the healed
scar after removal of the gold plate.</p>

today.</font></caption>

<p>    The skill of the surgeons in amputations is illustrated by the
pottery reproductions of amputated parts. One of these, for example,
shows a man with an amputated foot holding the stump of his leg with
one hand while putting on a sock over the end of the stump with the
other hand. The technic of amputation is shown in pottery form in Fig.

the leg, high up. Note how the thigh bone was cut so as to provide a
fleshcovered stump. Below in Fig. 77 is shown a healed oblique fracture

<p>    When the Spaniards arrived to carry forward the conquest of Peru
they found the entire coastal area and upper plateaus under the control
of a culture organized under the Inca rulers. Prior to the domination
of that culture, which had its origin in the high plateau country,
several other cultures had developed along the coast in succeeding eras
of domination. In northern Peru the Chimus developed a great culture
that extended over a long period of time. Their capital city was at
Chan Chan, inland from the present coastal port of Saliverry and near
Trujillo. This city is estimated to have contained a million people.
The argument is sometimes presented that at the time these ancient
cultures lived the coastal areas were not arid desert but well supplied
with rain. That this was not so is clearly evidenced by the fact that
the walls were built of stucco made by mixing water with the available
sand and rubble either in continuous molds or in blocks that were built
into the fort. Since these blocks were only sun-dried they had very
little resistance to rain. In this rainless desert land they have
continued to stand through many centuries, many of them probably
through several thousand years. There has been a vast change in the
walls of the ruined city of Chan Chan within a decade and a half.</p>

<p>    In 1925 this district was visited by a heavy downpour of rain
which apparently exceeded any precipitation, not only through historic
times, but for many centuries preceding. Temples, courtyards and
military defenses which were in splendid preservation before that
downpour were reduced to a mere semblance of their former structure.
Clearly these great cities and their defenses could not have been built
of this material in the period when downpours were even occasional, let
alone frequent.</p>

<p>    It was, of course, the wealth of the ancient cultures that
spurred on the conquistadors. It is very difficult to estimate the per
capita quantity of gold available in those early cultures. That gold
and silver were abundant is evidenced by the extensive use that was
made of these metals for covering the walls of rooms and decorating
public buildings with massive plates, sometimes entirely encircling a
building and the walls of its various rooms. A considerable quantity of
gold and silver has been taken from the burial mounds. One burial mound
is reported to have yielded between six and seven million dollars worth
of gold. So great has been the activity of the grave robbers that the
Peruvian Government has placed a ban on this enterprise though for a
period it was allowed on condition that a stated percentage was given
to the Government.</p>

<p>    One of the principal characteristics of the Chimu culture of the
coastal area of northern Peru is shown in the type of pottery they
produced. All articles were realistic in design. The pots show hunting
scenes, fishing and domestic scenes, as illustrated above. They were
very skillful in reproducing features in nearly natural size. Many
thousands of these portrait jars have been taken from the mounds of
this district. The local museum in the vicinity of Chan Chan, under the
skillful direction of Mr. Larco Herrera at Chiclyan was reported to
contain over twenty thousand jars and specimens taken from the
mounds.</p>

<p>    To the south of the domain of the Chimu culture, a very strong
culture was built up with very different characteristics known as the
Naska. While many of their habits of life, including their methods of
providing food, were similar to those of the Chimu culture, they were
unique in the designs of their pottery, which were characterized by
being allegorical. They used elaborate color designs and fantastic
patterns. Very little is known as yet of the meaning of much that they
have left. While sundials of ancient design and build have been found
in many parts of Peru, it is not known to what extent they developed a
knowledge of astronomy. The pilot of the plane that flew us from Lima
to Arequipa took us over some very strange architectural designs of
geometrical patterns which he had discovered and which he suggested had
not been reported upon nor interpreted. I photographed some of these
from the air. The straight lines constituting the sides of some of the
geometric figures are over a thousand feet long and reveal a precision
of the angles and a straightness of the ground structures which
indicate the use of competent engineering equipment and a high
knowledge of surveying.</p>

<p>    One of the principal purposes of my trip to Peru was to study
the effect of the Humboldt Current, with its supply of human food, on
the ancient cultures which were buried along the coast. In other parts
of the world, where Nature had provided the sea with an abundance of
sea life which was being utilized by native races, I found quite
routinely excellent physical development with typical broad,
well-developed facial forms and dental arches with normal contours. In
each of these groups, the people have reproduced quite closely the
racial type in practically all members of the group. I have emphasized
with illustrations this fact in connection with the Melanesians and
Polynesians on eight archipelagos of the Pacific Ocean, the Malay races
on the islands north of Australia, the Aborigines of Australia along
the east coast; also the Gaelics in the Outer Hebrides, and the Eskimos
of Alaska.</p>

<p>    The activity of grave robbers in the ancient burial mounds has
left skeletons strewn helter skelter where many of them have been
weathering, probably for years. While many of these had apparently been
deliberately smashed, large numbers were intact, and in a good state of
preservation. Some of the ancient cemeteries apparently extended over
areas covering a square mile; and as far as the eye could see the white
bleaching bones, particularly the skulls, dotted the landscape. Since
there were several distinct cultures, I endeavored to make a cross
section study of a number of these burial grounds in order that a fair
average of specimens might be obtained. The skulls were handled by me,
personally, and large numbers of them were photographed. As I have
mentioned, it was the ancient custom when making the burials to inter
objects that were of special interest to the individuals, including the
implements with which he had worked. Fishermen's skulls are shown in
Fig. 78 with their nets. It will be noted that all these arches are
broad and wide, that the third molars are well formed and almost always
well developed, and in good masticating position. Notwithstanding the
long period of interment the fabrics buried with these people were
often in a remarkably good state of preservation. Even the hair was
well preserved. A characteristic of the method of preparation for
burial involved placing over the teeth a preparation that was held in
position by a strip of cloth which cemented the teeth quite firmly to
this strip with the result that when the mummy cases were torn open the
removal of this bandage removed the straight rooted teeth, and
therefore large numbers of the skulls that were bleaching on the sandy
wastes were without the straight rooted teeth. Of course, these would
readily tumble out at the slightest jar, after the mummified tissues
had decomposed from exposure. The teeth lost in this way would include
practically all of the upper and lower incisors, some of the bicuspids
and third molars.</p>

<caption align="BOTTOM"><font size="-1">FIG. 78. The two skulls in the

seventy-six skulls in succession I did not find one with the typical
deformities of our moderns.</font></caption>

<p>    Since our study was primarily concerned with the shape of the
dental arches and facial form, these characteristics could be studied
and recorded with the straight rooted teeth removed. Fortunately, there
are some excellent collections of skulls in museums in Peru, with the
skulls in position where they can be readily studied for the shape of
the dental arches. When we have in mind that from 25 to 75 per cent of
individuals in various communities in the United States have a distinct
irregularity in the development of the dental arches and facial form,
the cause and significance of which constitutes one of the important
problems of this study, the striking contrast found in these Peruvian
skulls will be seen to constitute a challenge for our modern
civilizations. In a study of 1,276 skulls of these ancient Peruvians, I
did not find a single skull with significant deformity of the dental
arches.</p>

<p>    Since these investigations have apparently established the fact
that this problem is related directly to nutrition, and chiefly to
nutrition in the formative period, and, as we shall see, to a very
early part of the formative period, we have here evidence of a system
of living that is very closely in accord with Nature's fundamental laws
of reproduction. Several studies have been made dealing with the
incidence of dental caries or tooth decay among these ancient cultures.
The author of "Bird Islands of Peru" <font size="-2">(1)</font> states
that in his examination of fifty mummies in succession he found only
four with a tooth with dental caries. This again is in striking
contrast to our modernized communities in which from 95 to 100 per cent
of all the members of a community group suffer from dental caries. I
have shown in connection with the Indians of the western coast of
Canada that in six highly modernized communities where the Indians were
using white man's foods, 40 per cent of all the teeth had been attacked
by dental caries. A similar high percentage was found in the Indians
now living in Florida. The ancient burials in southern Florida revealed
apparent, complete immunity. These were pre-Columbian burials.</p>

<p>    The skill of the primitive cultures of Peru in engineering as
evidenced by the irrigation systems has always been a subject of
amazement to modern engineers. I visited in a valley fifteen miles from
the Santa River an ancient aqueduct which was said to be a hundred
miles long. Our guide informed me that he had walked in it for
thirty-five miles. With its even grades, overflows and auxiliary
channels for distribution, its adaptation to the area to be watered,
and the skill with which it was cut through rock shoulders and its
retaining walls built, it constitutes a monument to engineering
ability. Modern engineers have estimated that this aqueduct could
deliver sixty million cubic feet of water a day. In Fig. 79 will be
seen a section where it has been carried through a rock cutting and
beyond will be seen a retaining wall used to carry the flume along the
sheer face of a rock. The modern inhabitants of this community have
carried away this retaining wall for use in the foundations of their
huts. Below, in Fig. 79, will be seen a district of many hundreds of
acres, possibly a thousand, where the fields are laid out just as they
were left hundreds of years ago when the primitive people were driven
from this habitat. All this valley needs is water.</p>

<p>    In order to reach the burial places it was necessary to drive
many hundreds of miles over the arid desert inland from the coast. We
were exceedingly fortunate in having as our interpreter and guide Dr.
Albert Giesecke, who for fourteen years was the Chancellor of Cuzco
University. With his excellent knowledge of the country and its
languages, with the credentials which gave us entry to the secluded
places, together with the kindness and helpfulness of the Peruvian
Government officials in almost all localities, we were able to obtain
much valuable information. In an estimate of this culture not only
their arts, but their scientific skill should be included.</p>

<p>    Since the primary object of this quest was to learn of the
efficiency of these primitive people in the art of living in harmony
with Nature's laws and their methods for accomplishing this, it was
desirable to find, if possible, some living descendants of these people
to gain from them the information that had been handed down. We were
told that there were a few villages in an isolated section of the coast
in northern Peru where the inhabitants claimed descent from the ancient
Chimu cultures of that area. This group was characterized by a
flattening of the skull at the back which classified them as short
heads and is readily identified. We were very fortunate in having the
assistance of Commander Daniel Matto of the Peruvian Army. He was able
to utilize the police facilities for locating typical old residents who
could tell us much of the story of their race and its recent history as
it had been handed down by word of mouth. In Fig. 80 will be seen one
of these nonagenarians. He told us of incidents that had been related
to him by his great-greatgrandfather and by the old people of that
area, of the coming of Pizarro four hundred years ago. The height of
this man can be judged as he is seen standing beside Mrs. Price, who is
five feet three. His head is shown both front and side view, revealing
the flattened surface at the back. An ancient skull with typical
flattening is also shown. Fortunately these people are living very
closely in accordance with the customs of their ancestors. They are
fisherfolk, with a hardihood and skill that is in striking contrast
with the lethargy of the modernized groups. Their fine physical
development, the breadth of their dental arches and the regularity of
their facial features are in striking contrast to the characteristics
noted among individuals in the modernized colonies. In Fig. 81 will be
seen typical members of these colonies.</p>

<p>    The skill with which these men manage their fishing boats is
inspiring. Even though the surf was rolling in great combers they did
not hesitate to go out in either their small crafts carrying one
individual or in their large sailboats carrying a dozen men. The
abundance of the fish in this district is demonstrated by the large
catch that each succeeding boat brought to shore.</p>

<p>    At the time the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in Peru one of the
most unique of the ancient cultures held sway over both the mountain
plateaus and the coastal plains from Santiago of Chile northward to
Quito, Equador, a distance of about 1200 miles. This culture took its
name from the ruling emperors called Incas. The capital of their, great
kingdom was Cuzco, a city located between the East and West Cordillera
Ranges of the Andes. These parallel ranges are from fifty to two
hundred miles apart. Between them is situated a great plateau ranging
from 10,000 to 13,000 feet above the sea. The mountain ranges are
snow-capped and include in Peru alone fifty peaks that are over 18,000
feet in altitude, ranging up to 22,185 feet in Mount Huascaran. Only
Mount Aconcagua in Chile is higher. It is 23,075 feet--the highest
mountain in the Americas. The air drift is across South America from
east to west, carrying vast quantities of water received by evaporation
from the Atlantic Ocean. This moisture is precipitated rapidly when the
clouds are forced into the chill of the higher Andes. In the rainy
season the great plateau area is frequently well watered, though not in
sufficient quantity to meet the needs of agriculture for much of the
territory. In the past the precipitation has been supplemented by vast
irrigation projects using the water from the melting snows. It is
estimated that the population ruled over by the reigning Incas at the
time of the coming of the Spaniards reached five millions.</p>

<p>    It is probable that few, if any, of the ancient or modern
cultures of the world have ever attained a more highly perfected
organization of society than had this Inca culture. The ruling Inca was
a benevolent despot, and according to history unique in that he
practiced most diligently all of the laws he promulgated for his
people. There was no poverty, want or crime. Every man, woman and child
was specifically provided with all necessities. The entire amount of
tillable land was divided so that every man, woman and child had his
assigned parcel. Everyone worked as assigned by the proper official.
While it is not appropriate here to go into details, it is important
that we have a bird's eye view of this great culture for which I will
quote a paragraph from Agnes Rothery's "South America, The West Coast
and The East." <font size="-2">(2)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">The people who erected this temple lived in order
and health, under the most successful communism the world has ever
seen. Their land was divided into three portions--one portion for the
Inca, one for the Sun, and one for the people, with seventy square
meters for every boy and thirty-five for every girl. The live stock and
implements were similarly apportioned and the land was ploughed,
planted, and the crops gathered in strict rotation. First the fields of
the Sun were cultivated, and then the land of the aged, the sick,
widows, and orphans was tended; then the lands of the people, neighbors
assisting one another; and last of all the lands of the Inca, with
songs of praise and joy, because this was the service of their King. To
every living soul was given his tasks, according to his physical and
mental capacities. He was prevented from overwork, prohibited from
idleness, cared for in illness and old age. Children were taken by the
Government when they were five and trained to the profession where they
were most needed. There was no hunger, no crime in the whole
empire.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    The Inca held his kingly office over the docile,
industrious, and contented mass not only through his royal blood, but
through his wisdom and kindness in caring for and guiding his subjects,
his bravery in war, and his statesmanship at home. Although he set an
example to his subjects by following every law which he promulgated
(astonishing idea to our modern lawmakers!), he lived, as became his
rank, in luxury. In his garden were rows of corn moulded from pure gold
with leaves of pure silver, and a tassel of spun silver, as fine as
silk, moving in the air. Llamas and alpacas, life-sized and cunningly
fashioned from the same metal, stood upon his lawns, as they did in the
courts of the Temple of the Sun.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Cuzco, the capital, is reported to have housed about two hundred
thousand people at the time of the Spanish Conquest. It is situated on
a branch of the Urabamba River in a beautiful valley surrounded by
fertile mountain sides and towering snow-capped pinnacles. The Urabamba
River drains a large area of the plateau lying to the south of Cuzco
and has cut a magnificent gorge through the southern range of the Andes
where it passes from the plateau to the eastern watershed and thence to
the Amazon. A little to the south of Cuzco the eastern and the western
ranges of mountains approach and combine in a cluster of magnificent
pinnacles and intervening valleys and gorges, that are to be equalled
by no mountain scenery in the world. Today, almost all travel from the
Andean Plateau north of this region, as well as from all areas along
the coast, must proceed to the coast, thence down the coast by boat to
the port of Mollendo which is often dangerous or impossible of approach
because of the heavy seas. The journey is made by train up through
Arequipa and over the western Cordillera Range of the Andes into the
plateau country and from there northward to Cuzco. So great is this
natural barrier that the detour requires many days, and the crossing of
several divides ranging from fourteen to sixteen thousand feet above
the sea. This was not necessary for the Incas who had built roads and
suspension bridges through these mountains from Cuzco to all parts of
the great empire. It is in this mountain vastness that the Inca rulers
had constructed their most superb fortresses. While the early Spanish
conquerors of the country knew that the nobility had great defenses to
which they might retreat, the location of the fortresses was not known.
Their greatest fortress was discovered and excavated by Professor C. W.
Bingham of Yale, under the auspices of Yale University and the American
Museum of Natural History. This fortress and retreat is now world
famous as Macchu Piccu, and probably represents the highest development
of engineering, ancient and in some respects modern, on the American
continent.</p>

<p>    We are particularly concerned with the type of men that were
capable of such great achievement, since they were required to carry
forward their great undertakings without the use of iron or the wheel.
While the great Inca culture dominated the Sierras and the coast for
several centuries prior to the coming of the Spanish, and while they
had their seat of government and vast agricultural enterprises in the
high Sierras, it is of special interest that many of the most
magnificent monuments remaining today in stone were not constructed by
the Inca culture, but by the Tauhuanocan culture which preceded the
Inca. The Incas were a part of the Quechu linguistic stock, while the
Tauhuanocans were a part of the Aymara linguistic stock. The Incas had
their capital in the high plateau country about the center of Peru. The
earlier Tauhuanocan culture centered in southern Peru near Lake
Titicaca where their most magnificent structures are to be found today.
One of the largest single stones to be moved and put into the building
of a great temple in the history of the world is to be found near Lake
Titicaca. According to engineers, there is no quarry known in an easily
reached locality where such a stone could be quarried. It is
conjectured that it was brought two hundred miles over mountainous
country. It is important to note that many magnificent structures,
evidently belonging to this ancient Tauhaunocan culture, are found
distributed through the Andean Plateau from Bolivia to Equador. Their
masonry was characterized by the fitting together of large stones faced
so perfectly that in many of the walls it was difficult to find a
crevice which had enough space to allow the passage of the point of my
pen knife, notwithstanding that these stones were many-sided with some
of them fifteen to twenty feet in length. In Figure 82 above will be
seen a section of wall of the great fortress Sacsahuaman overlooking
Cuzco. Modern engineers seem unable to provide a satisfactory answer as
to how these people were able to cut these stones with the limited
facilities available, nor is it explained how they were able to
transport and hoist some of their enormous monoliths. The walls and
fortress of Macchu Piccu, as well as the residences and temples, were
built of white granite which apparently was taken from quarries in the
bank of the river Urabamba, two thousand feet below the fortress.
Without modern hoisting machinery, how did they raise those mammoth
stones? In Fig. 82 below is shown a typical section of wall. One stone
shown has twelve faces and twelve angles, all fitting accurately its
boundary stones. It is as though the stones were plastic and pressed
into a mould.</p>

<p>    The country is rugged. Over it passes the highest standard-gage
railroad in the world,--about 16,000 feet above sea level. The banks of
this river are protected for long distances by ancient stone retaining
walls. The native Indians live and herd their flocks of llamas and
alpacas up near the snow line, largely between 15,000 and 18,000 feet.
The Incas and their descendants now occupying the high Sierras in the
Andes have been thrifty agriculturists. They turn the soil with a very
narrow, long, slender bladed spade which they force into the ground,
and with which they pry the ground up in chunks. They then break up the
chunks. These spades were originally made of copper which they mined
themselves. Cuzco is the archeological capital of South America, but
its glory is in the ancient fortresses and temples, rather than in the
modern structures. As one passes through the streets, he will note that
in many instances the foundations and parts of the walls of many of the
modern Spanish cathedrals and public buildings are of old Inca
construction, of fine stone work surmounted by cheap rubble work and
mortar superstructure. Whereas the original Cuzco had running water and
an excellent sanitation system, modern Cuzco has deplorable sanitary
conditions. The following is quoted from the West Coast Leader,
published in Lima, dated July 20, 1937: "Of a total 3,600 houses in the
city of Cuzco 900 are without water or drainage; 2,400 are without
light (windows) and 1,080 completely lack any sanitary systems. It is
not surprising, therefore, that in some years the death rate exceeds
the birth rate.</p>

<p>    We are particularly concerned in studying these people to know
the sources of their great capacity for developing art, engineering,
government and social organization. Can such a magnificent culture be
brought about unless founded on a superb physical development resulting
from purely biologic forces?</p>

<p>   Earthquakes are very frequent in the Andes. We experienced
several while in Peru. One of these opened up a cave in the
mountainside in the Urabamba Valley near which we were making studies.
The cave had just been explored and a number of ancient burials found.
I was able to examine a number of skulls from this cave which
apparently represented a pre-Spanish period. The date of the burials
could not be determined. The skulls were interpreted as belonging to an
early Indian period. In Fig. 83 may be seen two typical skulls. Note
the broad sweep of the dental arches and freedom from tooth decay. The
third molars (wisdom teeth) are well developed and in normal position
for mastication. These are typical of the entire group found in this
burial place. It is very evident that these individuals were provided
with an adequate nutrition throughout the formative and growth periods,
as well as during their adult life. This is significant because of the
limited variety of foods easily obtainable for the people in the high
plateau country of the Andes.</p>

<p>    The ancient Peruvians of both the coastal area and high plateau
country had developed superb physical bodies in each of the several
cultures. This development had been brought about in spite of the bad
conditions prevailing with arid desert land extending from the coast to
the mountains, and in spite of the severe climate of the high Sierras.
The people utilized the wide variety of animal life from the sea in
conjunction with the excellent plant foods grown in the river basins
with the aid of irrigation. Over twenty of our common plants had their
origin in ancient Peru. In the high Sierras, their animal foods were
largely limited to the llama, alpaca and wild animals. Each household,
however, maintained a colony of guinea pigs. Owing to the difficulty of
boiling in the high altitudes, they found it necessary to roast their
cereals and meats. Their vegetable foods included potatoes, which were
preserved in powder form by freezing and drying and pulverizing. Corn
and several varieties of beans and quinua were their principal cereals.
The latter is a small seed of very high nutritive value.</p>

INDIANS</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">I</font>N ORDER to understand the living descendants
of the ancient residents of the high Andes it is essential that we know
their environment. Their climate is cold at night the year around.
While during the winter the snow is deep in the high mountains, there
is very little on the plateau, since Peru is near the equator extending
from 5 to 16 degrees south latitude. The sunshine is bright and warm
even in winter. Consequently they have pasturage for their animals the
year around.</p>

<p>    The only native domesticated animals of the Andean Plateau are
the llama and the alpaca. Both of these belong to the camel species, as
does the vicuna. The llama is the Indians' beast of burden in the
Andes. Only the males are used. The animals are very docile and respond
with gentleness when treated with kindness. One continually marvels at
the ease with which the Indian guides his loaded caravan with soft
words or motions, never with harshness. The llama has many unique
features as a beast of burden. It forages as it moves along and
consequently must be driven very slowly. Each animal will carry a
burden not exceeding a hundred pounds, and if more is placed on its
back it will immediately lie down until the extra burden is removed.
The llama has broad doubletoed feet like the camel which make it very
sure-footed. It requires no shoeing and exceedingly little care. It can
thrive, however, only in the high altitudes. The wool of the llama is
coarse and is used for heavy, rough garments. The alpaca is a little
smaller than the llama and produces a very heavy wool of fine quality.
Accustomed as this animal is to the severe cold and the high altitudes,
as well as to the rain and sun, its fleece is both durable and warm. It
is used extensively throughout the world for suits for aviators. The
native colors vary from white to bluish tints and from light to very
dark browns. It accordingly provides very stable colors for weaving
directly into ponchos and native apparel. The vicuna is a much smaller
animal than either the llama or alpaca. It has one of the most highly
prized coats of fur produced anywhere in the world. This animal has
never been domesticated; vast herds have lived wild on the high slopes
of the Andes mountains. The demand for vicuna fur became so great that
a million and a half of these animals were slain in one year to obtain
their fur pelts. The result is that the Peruvian Government has now
completely forbidden their destruction. The garments of the ruling
class of the Incas were made of the vicuna wool.</p>

<p>    One of the important objectives of my trip to Peru was to find
and study, if possible, some descendants of these Andean stocks.
Fortunately, large numbers of the Aymara linguistic stock, the
descendants of the Tauhuanocan culture, are still residing in southern
Peru and Bolivia where they are said to retain the essentials of their
ancient methods of living. They constitute the principal native
populations in the vicinity of Lake Titicaca and the high mountain
plateaus of southern Peru and northern Bolivia. I have always
encountered difficulty in persuading the native peoples to allow
themselves to be photographed in their primitive costumes. They are
usually willing to be photographed provided one will wait for them to
put on some modern garment.</p>

<p>    I am reminded of an experience on one of the South Sea Islands
where there was need for roads, but no money with which to build them.
Laws were passed by the chiefs that anyone approaching a highway in
native garb where he might be seen by a foreigner was subject to arrest
and to payment of a fine which had to be worked out as labor in
building roads. Of course, on that island no one would allow himself to
be photographed without some modern clothing. One boy presented himself
wearing a single garment, a man's full dress vest, which had evidently
reached the island in a missionary barrel.</p>

<p>    The hats in the pictures in Fig. 84 are of native design and
manufacture. They are made of fur and are like our modern derbies in
construction.</p>

<p>    It is important to note the roundness of the features of the
Aymaras, the wide development of the nostrils for air intake and the
breadth of the dental arches. Many of them had been transported several
hundreds of miles to a coffee plantation because of their adeptness and
skill in sorting imperfect coffee beans from the run. As I watched them
I found it difficult to move my eyes fast enough to follow their
fingers and pick out from the moving run the undesired or imperfectly
formed kernels. This revealed a superb development of coordination. The
wisdom of these Aymaras is discussed in Chapter 21.</p>

<p>    I was very anxious to study the Incas in different parts of the
high Andes, particularly some of the original type in the vicinity of
Cuzco, their ancient capital. Throughout the Andean Plateau, the
Indians from the higher elevations bring down their wares on market
days to exchange with Indians from other localities, as well as to meet
and visit with their friends. They are very industrious and one seldom
sees a woman, either shepherding the stock or carrying a burden, who is
not busily engaged in spinning wool. While their wool is obtained in
part from sheep that have been imported, a great deal of it is obtained
from the alpacas which, like the llamas, are raised in the high
altitudes where the Indians always prefer to live. I was fortunate in
making contact with several groups of Indians in high altitudes through
the kindness of the prefects. A group of Indians from the high
mountains of the Urabamba Valley near Cuzco is shown in Fig. 85. An
examination of this group of twenty-five revealed the fact that not one
tooth had been attacked by dental caries and that, at all ages, the
teeth normally due were present.</p>

<p>    In Fig. 85, lower right, may be seen a typical Indian of the
Andes carrying a heavy load. The Indians of this region are able to
carry all day two hundred to three hundred pounds, and to do this day
after day. At several of the ports, these mountain Indians have been
brought down to the coast to load and unload coffee and freight from
the ships. Their strength is phenomenal.</p>

<p>    In approaching the study of the descendants of the Inca culture,
it is important to keep in mind a little of their history and
persecution under the Spanish rule. To this day they are bitter against
the white man for the treachery that has been meted out to them on many
occasions. Their leader was seized under treachery. The agreement to
free him, if the designated rooms were filled with gold as high as a
man could reach, was broken and their chief killed after the gold was
obtained. It is recorded that some six million of them died in the
mines under forced labor and poor foods under the lash of their Spanish
oppressors. In many places they still keep themselves aloof by staying
in the high mountains of the Andes with their flocks of llamas and
alpacas. They come down only for trading. As in the past, they still
weave their own garments. Indeed, they provide practically all of their
necessities from the local environment. Their capacity for enduring
cold is wonderful. They can sleep comfortably through the freezing
nights with their ponchos wrapped about their heads and with their legs
and feet bare. They wear two types of head cover, one inside the other.
Several individuals are seen in Fig. 85. Many of them have faces that
show strong character and personality.</p>

<p>    The women of this district wear felt hats which can be turned up
or down according to the weather. Fine examples of weaving were worn by
the women.</p>

<p>    In Fig. 86 will be seen two young men who had just come down
from the high mountains to a government school. The one in the lower
photograph is still wearing his native costume. The one in the upper
has discarded his native costume for white man's trousers. Note the
fine development of his chest, the splendid facial development and fine
teeth and dental arches. It is important to keep in mind that these
people are living in a rarified atmosphere and that, because of the
high altitude, they need greater lung capacity and stronger hearts than
do the people living at sea level. The ratio of oxygen content is
reduced about half at 10,000 feet.</p>

<p>    Market days which usually occur on Sunday present an interesting
scene. The Indians travel long distances with their wares for exchange.
They have no currency and exchanges are made by bargaining.</p>

<p>    Where these Indians have become modernized, the new generation
shows typical changes in facial and dental arch form as reported for
the other groups. There is also a marked character reaction which will
be discussed in detail in Chapter 19. In Fig. 88 are shown four typical
modification patterns due to the influence of modernization after the
foods of the white man have displaced the native dietary.</p>

<p>    An important item in the life of the Andean Indians is the
satisfaction they get from chewing cocoa leaves from which is made our
modern cocaine. In order to extract the alkaloid they chew with these
leaves the ash produced by the burning of a particular plant. This drug
is chewed as tobacco, one large quid will last for several hours.
Practically every Indian carries in a little pouch a quantity of these
leaves in dried form. The effect of this drug is to increase their
capacity for endurance. It makes them unconscious of hunger and
fatigue. Through our interpreter we frequently asked them regarding the
comfort or nourishment they obtained from the leaves and were told that
they often preferred these leaves to food when they were on a journey
and carrying heavy loads. I was informed that they can increase the
quantity of the drug used to a point at which they are quite unconcious
of pain and able to endure injuries without suffering, and operations
without discomfort. Since packets of these leaves were found in the
burials near the coast, it is clear that the drugs were used throughout
Peru in early times. It is also of interest that several of the skulls
taken from the cave in the high Andes, were found with trephine
operations in the skulls similar to those found in the burials along
the coast.</p>

<p>   The physical perfection and development of the present and past
Andean population has been accomplished in spite of the difficulty of
building and maintaining good bodily structure at the high altitude
where dairy products have not been and are not at present a large part
of the nutritional program. In this regard the ancient and contemporary
peoples of the Andes differ radically from the present and past groups
of people who live in the high valleys of Switzerland and Tibet where
milk is plentiful. The cow, sheep, horse and pig have been imported
into the high Andean countries during the last four hundred years since
the Spanish Conquests, but they have not acclimatized easily. The
earlier cultures were of course, dependent upon the llama, alpaca, wild
deer, birds and guinea pig for animal foods. While there have been vast
burial mounds built and preserved in the coastal regions where the
absence of rain and the dry sand have added materially to their
preservation, the rainy seasons have established very different
conditions for skeletal preservation in the high altitudes.
Nevertheless, a large number of skeletons in good state of preservation
have been recovered.</p>

<p>    The high Andean plateau extends throughout the length of Peru
between the mountain chains. The present Indian stock was studied in
four different places in the high plateau country, the farthest north
being Huaras. In this area we were materially assisted by the governor
of the province who very kindly sent messengers and brought down Indian
families from high altitudes to the police headquarters at Huaras. This
place is at an elevation of about 11,000 feet. We had an opportunity to
study also many who had come from the higher altitudes to the markets
to sell their wares. Huaras lies in a fertile valley that has been in
contact with modern civilization for many decades. This vicinity,
therefore, provided a wide range in classes of people, from Indians who
are isolated to those who are living in highly modernized groups. In
addition to the opportunity for studying the older people there were
opportunities for studying adolescents in the two high schools, one for
girls and one for boys. Some were pure-bloods who had been highly
isolated in their formative and childhood periods. The mixed-bloods had
been considerably modernized. There were some whites. I was told by the
prefect and others who were well informed that there was quite a
distinct difference between the Indians who were living in the high
northern Cordillera, the western Andean range called the Black
Mountains, and those living in the eastern range or White Mountains.
The latter were physically much better built and were least modernized.
Typical low immunity to caries and changes in facial and dental arch
form were found in these modernized groups.</p>

<p>   Another important area in which the native Indians were studied
was Chiclayo. This district is unique in large part because of the
influence of the modern civilization at Lima with which it is connected
by the railroad. The native market here is very large and occupies
about a mile of the main street of the town, through which no traffic
except pedestrian traffic can pass while the market is in session. The
town has been under the influence of the Spanish since the time of the
Conquest. It has many colonial buildings and a large cathedral. It has
not, however, accommodations for the influx of tourists who come out of
curiosity for the purchase of Indian wares. With the aid of the
prefect, even though no public accommodations were available, we were
made very comfortable in the soldiers' barracks. As the Indians came
down from the mountains to display and sell their wares, they were
brought to us at the barracks. Since this district has been in quite
intimate contact with the nutrition of the modernized capital, we found
here many individuals showing typical degeneration of the teeth and
dental arches.</p>

<p>    The adaptation of racial characteristics to the environment in
which they have developed is very strikingly illustrated in the Indian
cultures of the Amazon jungle district. We were very fortunate in being
able to make studies of some groups living at present as did their
ancestors through countless centuries in the Amazon basin. We were
greatly pleased and impressed with the splendid physiques and fine
personalities of many of the individuals of the groups.</p>

<p>    The abundance of rain, the fertility of the soil and the warm
climate make plant growth most luxuriant on the eastern slopes of the
Andes. It is of interest that in passing from the capital, Lima, across
the desert stretch between the ocean and the mountains and then up the
wall of the Andes to an altitude of sixteen thousand feet and then down
to the plateau at about twelve thousand feet and up again over the
eastern range and down into the Amazon basin, one has passed through
the tropics, temperate zone and sub-arctic zones with varieties of
plant life corresponding to each. A distance of a few hundred yards
will often divide the limits of particular birds and flowers. When one
reaches the foothills of the Andes on the eastern side, he is in a
region of rushing streams teeming with fish, a region of tropical
fruits and vegetables. It is in this setting that some of the finest
Indians we have seen were enjoying life in its fullness. The type of
shelter is very simple, indeed, consisting as it does of a framework
covered with banana and palm leaves. We were privileged to meet by
special arrangement about thirty of this tribe who had been brought
from some distance by the officials of the Perene Colony, owned and
operated by the Peruvian Corporation. In Fig. 89 will be seen the chief
and one of the noble women of his retinue. They understood that they
would have their pictures taken and came dressed in royal regalia.
Typical countenances are seen in Figs. 90 and 91. These people have
very kind faces with broad dental arches, and a high sense of humor.
They decorated their faces especially for their photograph. In the
entire group associated with this chief I did not find a single tooth
that had been attacked by dental caries. The fine dental arches are
illustrated in Figs. 90 and 91. Many of these young men had really
noble countenances, such as would rate them as leaders in modern
science and culture.</p>

<p>    In another tribe, however, of the same racial stock, efforts to
modernize had been in operation for some time by a mission. The food of
this latter group had been distinctly affected by their contact with
the modern group. By reducing the animal foods, the change in physical
efficiency, and appearance of tooth decay, is most marked. In Fig. 92
above will be seen typical cases of rampant tooth decay with extensive
loss of the teeth. In Fig. 92 below are shown two of the first
generation following the adoption of the modernized type of diet in

<p>    The native foods of these Amazon Jungle Indians included the
liberal use of fish which are very abundant in both the Amazon and its
branches, particularly in the foothill streams; animal life from the
forest and thickets; bird life, including many water fowl and their
eggs; plants and fruits. They use very large quantities of yucca which
is a starchy root quite similar to our potato in chemical content. This
is not the yucca of North America.</p>

<p>    The Peruvian Indians, in the highlands and in the eastern
watershed of the Andes, and also in the Amazon Basin, have built superb
bodies with high immunity to dental caries and with splendidly
developed facial and dental arch forms while living on the native foods
in accordance with their accumulated wisdom. Whenever they have adopted
the foods of modern civilization and have displaced their own
nutrition, dental caries has been found to be wide-spread; and in the
succeeding generations following the adoption of modern foods, a change
in facial and dental arch forms has developed. The modernized foods
which displaced their native foods were the typical white man's dietary
of refined-flour products, sugar, sweetened foods, canned goods, and
polished rice.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">CHARACTERISTICS OF PRIMITIVE AND<br>
MODERNIZED DIETARIES</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">I</font>F PRIMITIVE races have been more efficient
than modernized groups in the matter of preventing degenerative
processes, physical, mental and moral, it is only because they have
been more efficient in complying with Nature's laws. We have two
procedures that we can use for evaluating their programs: first, the
interpretation of their data in terms of our modern knowledge; and
second, the clinical application of their procedures to our modern
social problems. Specifically, since the greater success of the
primitives in meeting Nature's laws has been based primarily on dietary
procedures, it becomes desirable first, to evaluatetheir dietary
programs on the basis of known biologic requirements for comparison
with the foods of our modern civilization; and second, to test their
primitive nutritional programs by applying their equivalents to our
modern families.</p>

<p>    The advance in our knowledge of body-building and body-repairing
materials from a biochemical standpoint makes it possible even with our
limited knowledge of organic catalysts, to draw comparisons between the
primitive and modernized dietaries. If we use the generally accepted
minimal and optimal quantities of the various minerals and vitamins
required, as indicated by Sherman, <font size="-2">(1)</font> we shall
have at once a yardstick for evaluating the primitive dietaries.</p>

<p>    Of the eighteen elements of which the human body is composed,
all of which are presumably essential, several are needed in very small
quantities. A few are required in liberal quantities. The normal adult
needs to receive from the foods eaten one-half to one gram of calcium
or lime per day. Few people receive more than one-half of the minerals
present in the food. The requirements of phosphorus are approximately
twice this amount. Of iron we need from one-seventh to one-third of a
gram per day. Smaller amounts than these are required of several other
elements. In order to utilize these minerals, and to build and maintain
the functions of various organs, definite quantities of various organic
catalysts which act as activating substances are needed. These include
the known and unknown vitamins.</p>

<p>    Unlike some experimental animals human beings have not the
ability to create some special chemical substances (not elements) such
as vitamins within their bodies. Several animals have this capacity.
For example, scurvy, which is due to a lack of vitamin C, cannot be
produced readily in rats because rats can manufacture vitamin C.
Similarly, rickets cannot be produced easily in guinea pigs, because
they can synthesize vitamin D. The absence of vitamin D and adequate
minerals produces rickets in young human beings. Neither rickets nor
scurvy can be produced readily in dogs because of the dogs' capacity to
synthesize both vitamins C and D. We are not so fortunate. Similarly,
the absence of vitamin B (B<font size="-2">1</font>) produces in birds
and man severe nervous system reactions, such as beri-beri. These
symptoms are often less pronounced, or quite different, in other
animals.</p>

<p>    From our knowledge of the dietaries used by the various
primitive racial stocks we can calculate the approximate amounts of the
minerals and vitamins provided by those dietaries, for comparison with
the amounts provided by modernized foods. Our problem is simplified by
the fact that the food of the white man in various parts of the world
being built from a few fundamental food factors, has certain quite
constant characteristics. Hence the displacing diets are similar for
the several modernized groups herewith considered.</p>

<p>    As a further approach to our problem, it is important to keep in
mind that, in general, the wild animal life has largely escaped many of
the degenerative processes which affect modern white peoples. We
ascribe this to animal instinct in the matter of food selection. It is
possible that man has lost through disuse some of the normal faculty
for consciously recognizing body requirements. In other words, the only
hunger of which we now are conscious is a hunger for energy to keep us
warm and to supply power. In general, we stop eating when an adequate
amount of energy has been provided, whether or not the body building
and repairing materials have been included in the food. The heat and
energy factor in our foods is measured in calories. In planning an
adequate diet, a proper ratio between body building and energy units
must be maintained. It is important to keep in mind that while the
amount of body-building and repairing material required is similar for
different individuals of the same age and weight, it is markedly
different for two individuals, one of whom is leading a sedentary, and
the other, an active life. Similarly, there is a great difference
between the amount of body-building and repairing material required by
a growing child or an expectant mother and an average adult.</p>

<p>    There are certain characteristics of the various dietaries of
the primitive races, which are universally present when that dietary
program is associated with a high immunity to disease and freedom from
deformities. In general, these are the foods that provide adequate
sources of body-building and body-repairing material. The use by
primitives, of foods relatively low in calories has resulted in forcing
them to eat large quantities of these foods, in order to provide the
heat and energy requirements of the body. The primitives have obtained,
often with great difficulty, foods that are scarce but rich in certain
elements. In these rare foods were elements which the body requires in
small quantities, including minerals such as iodine, copper, manganese
and special vitamins. In connection with the vitamins it should be kept
in mind that our knowledge of these unique organic catalysts is
limited. The medical profession and the public at large think of
vitamin D as consisting of just one chemical factor, whereas,
investigations are revealing continually new and additional factors. A
recent review <font size="-1">(2)</font> describes in considerable
detail eight distinct factors in vitamin D and refers to information
indicating that there may be at least twelve. Clearly, it is not
possible to undertake to provide an adequate nutrition simply by
reinforcing the diet with a few synthetic products which are known to
represent certain of these nutritional factors. By the mass of the
people at large, as well as by members of the medical profession,
activated ergosterol is considered to include all that is necessary to
supply the vitamin D group of activators to human nutrition.</p>

<p>    The various dietary programs of primitive races which appear to
be successful in controlling dental caries and deformities may be
divided into three groups based upon the sources from which they derive
the minerals and fat-soluble activators. I do not use the term vitamins
exclusively because as yet little is known about the whole group of
organic catalysts, although we have considerable knowledge of the
limited number which are designated by the first half dozen letters of
the alphabet. Most lay people and members of the medical and dental
professions assume that the six or eight vitamins constitute
practically all that are needed in an adequate nutrition. These organic
activators can be divided into two main groups, water-soluble and
fat-soluble. An essential characteristic of the successful dietary
programs of primitive races has been found to relate to a liberal
source of the fat-soluble activator group.</p>

<p>    When we discuss the successful dietary programs of the various
groups from the standpoint of their ability to control tooth decay and
prevent deformity we find that for the people in the high and isolated
Alpine valleys their nutrition is dependent largely on entire rye bread
and dairy products with meat about once a week and various vegetables,
fresh in the summer season and stored for the winter season. An
analysis in my laboratory of the dairy products obtained from the
Loetschental Valley in Switzerland through a series of years has shown
the vitamin content to be much higher than the average throughout the
world for similar foods during the same seasons. The milk in these high
valleys is produced from green pasturage and stored green hay of
exceptionally high chlorophyll content. The milk and the rye bread
provided minerals abundantly.</p>

<p>    The diet of the people in the Outer Hebrides which proved
adequate for maintaining a high immunity to dental caries and
preventing deformity consisted chiefly of oat products and sea foods
including the wide variety of fish available there. This diet included
generally no dairy products since the pasture was not adequate for
maintaining cattle. Oat grain was the only cereal that could be matured
satisfactorily in that climate. Some green foods were available in the
summer and some vegetables were grown and stored for winter. This diet,
which included a liberal supply of fish, included also the use of
livers of fish. One important fish dish was baked cod's head that had
been stuffed with oat meal and chopped cods' livers. This was an
important inclusion in the diets of the growing children. The oats and
fish, including livers, provided minerals and vitamins adequate for an
excellent racial stock with high immunity to tooth decay.</p>

<p>    For the Eskimos of Alaska the native diet consisted of a liberal
use of organs and other special tissues of the large animal life of the
sea, as well as of fish. The latter were dried in large quantities in
the summer and stored for winter use. The fish were also eaten frozen.
Seal oil was used freely as an adjunct to this diet and seal meat was
specially prized and was usually available. Caribou meat was sometimes
available. The organs were used. Their fruits were limited largely to a
few berries including cranberries, available in the summer and stored
for winter use. Several plant foods were gathered in the summer and
stored in fat or frozen for winter use. A ground nut that was gathered
by the Tundra mice and stored in caches was used by the Eskimos as a
vegetable. Stems of certain water grasses, water plants and bulbs were
occasionally used. The bulk of their diet, however, was fish and large
animal life of the sea from which they selected certain organs and
tissues with great care and wisdom. These included the inner layer of
skin of one of the whale species, which has recently been shown to be
very rich in vitamin C. Fish eggs were dried in season. They were used
liberally as food for the growing children and were recognized as
important for growth and reproduction. This successful nutrition
provided ample amounts of fat-soluble activators and minerals from sea
animal life.</p>

<p>    For the Indians living inside the Rocky Mountain Range in the
far North of Canada, the successful nutrition for nine months of the
year was largely limited to wild game, chiefly moose and caribou.
During the summer months the Indians were able to use growing plants.
During the winter some use was made of bark and buds of trees. I found
the Indians putting great emphasis upon the eating of the organs of the
animals, including the wall of parts of the digestive tract. Much of
the muscle meat of the animals was fed to the dogs. It is important
that skeletons are rarely found where large game animals have been
slaughtered by the Indians of the North. The skeletal remains are found
as piles of finely broken bone chips or splinters that have been
cracked up to obtain as much as possible of the marrow and nutritive
qualities of the bones. These Indians obtain their fat-soluble vitamins
and also most of their minerals from the organs of the animals. An
important part of the nutrition of the children consisted in various
preparations of bone marrow, both as a substitute for milk and as a
special dietary ration.</p>

<p>    In the various archipelagos of the South Pacific and in the
islands north of Australia, the natives depended greatly on shell fish
and various scale fish from adjacent seas. These were eaten with an
assortment of plant roots and fruits, raw and cooked. Taro was an
important factor in the nutrition of most of these groups. It is the
root of a species of lily similar to "elephant ears" used for garden
decorations in America because of its large leaves. In several of the
islands the tender young leaves of this plant were eaten with coconut
cream baked in the leaf of the tia plant. In the Hawaiian group of
islands the taro plant is cooked and dried and pounded into powder and
then mixed with water and allowed to ferment for twenty-four hours,
more or less, in accordance with the stiffness of the product desired.
This is called poi. Its use in this form was comparable in efficiency
with its use on other archipelagos as a boiled root served much as we
use potatoes. For these South Sea Islanders fat-soluble vitamins and
many of the minerals were supplied by the shell-fish and other animal
life from the sea.</p>

<p>    The native tribes in eastern and central Africa, used large
quantities of sweet potatoes, beans, and some cereals. Where they were
living sufficiently near fresh water streams and lakes, large
quantities of fish were eaten. Goats or cattle or both were
domesticated by many tribes. Other tribes used wild animal life quite
liberally. Some very unique and special sources of vitamins were used
by some of these tribes. For example, in certain seasons of the year
great swarms of a large winged insect develop in Lake Victoria and
other lakes. These often accumulated on the shores to a depth of many
inches. They were gathered, dried and preserved to be used in puddings
which are highly prized by the natives and are well spoken of by the
missionaries. Another insect source of vitamins used frequently by the
natives is the ant which is collected from great ant hills that in many
districts grow to heights of ten feet or more. In the mating season the
ants develop wings and come out of the ant hills in great quantities
and go into the air for the mating process. These expeditions are
frequently made during or following a rain. The natives have developed
procedures for inducing these ants to come out by covering over the
opening with bushes to give the effect of clouds and then pounding on
the ground to give an imitation of rain. We were told by the
missionaries that one of the great luxuries was an ant pie but
unfortunately they were not able to supply us with this delicacy. Parts
of Africa like many other districts are often plagued by vast swarms of
locusts. These are gathered in large quantities, to be cooked for
immediate use or dried and ground into a flour for later use. They
provide a rich source of minerals and vitamins. The natives of Africa
used the cereals maize, beans, linga linga, millet, and Kaffir corn,
cooked or roasted. Most of these were ground just before cooking.</p>

<p>    Among the Aborigines of Australia we found that those living
near the sea were using animal life from that source liberally,
together with the native plants and animals of the land. They have not
cultivated the land plants during their primitive life. In the
interior, they use freely the wild animal life, particularly wallaby,
kangaroo, small animals and rodents. All of the edible parts, including
the walls of the viscera and internal organs are eaten.</p>

<p>    The native Maori in New Zealand, used large quantities of foods
from the sea, wherever these were available. Even in the inland food
depots, mutton birds were still available in large quantities. These
birds were captured just before they left the nests. They developed in
the rockeries about the coast, chiefly on the extreme southern coast of
the South Island. At this stage, the flesh is very tender and very fat
from the gorging that has been provided by their parent. The value of
this food for the treatment of tuberculosis was being heralded quite
widely in both Australia and New Zealand. In the primitive state of the
islands large quantities of land birds were available and because of
the fertility of the soil and favorable climate, vegetables and fruits
grew abundantly in the wild. Large quantities of fern root were used.
Where groups of the Maori race were found isolated sufficiently from
contact with modern civilization and its foods to be dependent largely
on the native foods, they selected with precision certain shell-fish
because of their unique nutritive value.</p>

<p>    A splendid illustration of the primitive Maori instinct or
wisdom regarding the value of sea foods was shown in an experience we
had while making examinations in a native school on the east coast of
the North Islands. I was impressed with the fact that the children in
the school gave very little evidence of having active dental caries. I
asked the teacher what the children brought from their homes to eat at
their midday lunch, since most of them had to come too great a distance
to return at noon. I was told that they brought no lunch but that when
school was dismissed at noon the children rushed for the beach where,
while part of the group prepared bonfires, the others stripped and
dived into the sea, and brought up a large species of lobster. The
lobsters were promptly roasted on the coals and devoured with great
relish. Other sea foods are pictured in Fig. 74.</p>

<p>    The native diet of the tribes living in the islands north of
Australia consisted of liberal quantities of sea foods. These were
eaten with a variety of plant roots and greens, together with fruits
which grew abundantly in that favorable climate. Few places in the
world have so favorable a quantity of food for sea-animal life as these
waters which provide the richest pearl fisheries in the world. This is
evidence of the enormous quantity of shell-fish that develop there.
Here, as off the east coast of Australia, are to be found some of the
largest shell-fish of the world. It was a common occurrence to see
these shells being used by natives for such purposes as water storage
and for bath tubs of a size approximately that of a wash tub. Australia
and New Zealand are near enough to the Antarctic ice cap to have their
shores bathed with currents coming from the ice fields, currents which
abound in food for sea animals. The great barrier reef off the east
coast of Australia extends north to within a few leagues of New Guinea.
Murray Island is near the north end of this barrier. The fish in the
water at times form such a dense mass that they can be scooped into the
boats directly from the sea. Fishermen wading out in the surf and
throwing their spears into the schools of fish usually impale one or
several.</p>

<p>    The incidence of tooth decay on this island was less than one
per cent of all of the teeth examined. Another important sea food in
these waters was dugong, referred to as sea cow in northern waters.
This animal is very highly prized but is becoming scarce. We found its
meat very much like lamb. It lives on the vegetation of the sea floor
in shallow water. As we flew over the bays of Eastern Australia going
northward in search of colonies of native Aborigines, we could see
these sea animals pasturing in the clear water among the ocean
plants.</p>

<p>    During these investigations of primitive races, I have been
impressed with the superior quality of the human stock developed by
Nature wherever a liberal source of sea foods existed. These zones of
abundant marine life were largely in the wake of the ocean currents
drifting from the ice fields of the poles. The Humboldt Current is
probably the most liberal carrier of marine life of any of the ocean
currents. It leaves the ice field of the Antarctic and bathes the west
coast of South America from its southern tip nearly to the equator,
where the coast line changes direction and the Humboldt Current is
deflected out into the ocean. It meets here a warm current coming down
from the coast of Central America, Panama and Columbia. If the superb
physiques that Nature has established among the Maori of New Zealand,
the Malays of the Islands north of Australia, the Gaelics of the Outer
Hebrides and the natives on several of the archipelagos of the Pacific,
owe their superior physical development to sea foods, we should expect
to find that the tribes which have had contact with the great Humboldt
Current food would also have superb physiques. Unfortunately, very
little has been known of the ancient cultures that have developed along
the coast of Chile and Peru. It has been reported that of all the
Indian tribes of South America, those in Patagonia were the most
stalwart. While the west coast of Peru is bathed by the Humboldt
Current with its nearly inexhaustible supply of human nutrition, the
lands bordering that shore are among the most desolate deserts of the
world. The zone between the Andes Mountains and the coast for
approximately a thousand miles is utterly barren, consisting of moving
sand dunes and jagged promontories. Practically the only break in this
waterless, treeless desert is to be found in the few ribbons of water
that trickle down from the melting snows of the Andes Coastal Range.
This coast has no rainy seasons. Any vegetation grown, now or in the
past thousands of years, has had to be watered from the limited supply
afforded by these rivers which seem so insignificant when compared with
the vastness of the territory. These river bottoms contain the alluvial
deposits from the Andes and are very rich when watered. It has been
only by means of gigantic engineering undertakings that the water from
these rivers has been carried through great irrigation ditches,
sometimes fifty to a hundred miles long for the purpose of making it
possible to utilize these river bottom lands for agriculture.</p>

<p>   In many of the primitive tribes living by the sea we found
emphasis on the value of fish eggs and on some animal forms for
insuring a high physical development of growing children, particularly
of girls, and a high perfection of offspring through a reinforcement of
the mother's nutrition. It is also important to note that in several of
the primitive tribes studied there has been a consciousness that not
only the mother should have special nutrition, but also the father. In
this group very great value was placed upon a product obtained from a
sea form known locally as the angelote or angel fish, which in
classification is between a skate and a shark. The young of the
angelota are born alive, ready for free swimming and capable of
foraging for themselves immediately at birth. Twenty to thirty young
are born in one litter. The eggs of the female before fertilization are
about one inch in diameter, slightly oval but nearly spherical. They
are used as food by all, but the special food product for men is a pair
of glands obtained from the male. These glands weigh up to a pound
each, when they are dried. They have a recognized value among the
natives for treating cases of tuberculosis, especially for controlling
lung hemorrhages. The sea foods were used in conjunction with the land
plants and fruits raised by means of irrigation in the river valleys.
Together these foods provided adequate nutrition for maintaining high
physical excellence.</p>

<p>    In Chapter 13 I have discussed the probable order of these
ancient cultures and the possible extent of their duration. Very little
is known of their origin. Evidence has recently been discovered in
Panama indicating that both the wealth and the culture of Peru were
carried northward by maritime conquerors and that the cultures of
Central America, including the Maya culture may have had their origins
in these ancient cultures of Peru.</p>

<p>    While the coastal area of Peru saw the development of many
magnificent cultures through past ages, the highlands of Peru also have
left much evidence of superior attainments and wisdom. The two great
Indian linguistic groups of the Andean highlands of today are the
Aymara of Southern Peru and Bolivia and the Quichus of central and
northern Peru. The Aymara are credited with being the descendants of
the Tauhuanocan culture which preceded the Incan culture in the
highlands. The Quichu are credited with being the descendants of the
Incan culture which had its zenith just prior to the coming of the
Spaniards. In Chapter 14 I have shown photographs of these racial
stocks as they are found today in the Andean Sierras. It may be
possible that in former times the vast mountain ranges provided large
herds of grazing wild animals of the deer family. Because of the
vastness of the population and the extent to which all available land
surfaces were utilized for agriculture, it does not seem possible that
wild animal life could have been an adequate source of nutrition. The
members of the camel family, the llamas, alpacas, and vicunas were
utilized for food. Of these the first two were used to considerable
extent as they are today. When it is recognized that in the Sierra the
available water is largely that provided to the streams from the
melting snows and from rains in the rainy season, it will be realized
that these sources of fresh water could not provide the liberal
quantity of iodine essential for human growth and development. It was,
accordingly, a matter of great interest to discover that these Indians
used regularly dried fish eggs from the sea. Commerce in these dried
foods is carried on today as it no doubt has been for centuries. When I
inquired of them why they used this material they explained that it was
necessary to maintain the fertility of their women. I was informed also
that every exchange depot and market carried these dried fish eggs so
that they were always available. Another sea product of very great
importance, and one which was universally available was dried kelp.
Upon inquiry I learned that the Indians used it so that they would not
get "big necks" like the whites. The kelp provided a very rich source
of iodine as well as of copper, which is very important to them in the
utilization of iron for building an exceptionally efficient quality of
blood for carrying oxygen liberally at those high altitudes. An
important part of their dietary consists today as in the past of
potatoes which are gathered and frozen, dried and powdered, and
preserved in the powdered form. This powder is used in soups with llama
meat and other products. Since the vitamin D group of activators is
absent from nearly all plant products but must be synthesized in animal
bodies from the plant foods, where it is largely stored in organs, an
adequate source had to be provided. The Indians of the highlands of
Peru maintained colonies of guinea pigs which were used in their stews.
The ancient burials also show that the guinea pig was a common source
of food since mummified bodies of this animal were found. This is
significant since of all the animals that are used for experimental
work the guinea pig is probably the most efficient in synthesizing
vitamin D from plant foods. They are very hardy. They live on a great
variety of green plant foods and twigs and are very prolific. They
apparently played a very important part in the physical excellence of
the ancient cultures.</p>

<p>    It is unfortunate that as the white man has come into contact
with the primitives in various parts of the world he has failed to
appreciate the accumulated wisdom of the primitive racial stocks. Much
valuable wisdom has been lost by this means. I have referred to the
skill of the Indians in preventing scurvy and to the many drugs that we
use which the white man has learned of from the primitives.</p>

<p>    In this connection the Indians of British Columbia, who have
been so efficient in preventing scurvy, have a plant product for the
prevention and cure of diabetes. This has recently become known to the
white man through the experience of a patient who was brought into the
hospital at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, as reported in the
Canadian Medical Journal, July 1938. Prince Rupert is near the boundary
between British Columbia and Alaska on the coast. The patient came to
that hospital for an operation and suddenly showed signs of diabetes,
which required treatment with large doses of insulin. Dr. Richard
Geddes Large asked him regarding the history of his affection and what
he had been taking. He was told that for several years he had been
using an Indian preparation which was a hot water infusion of a root of
devil's-club which is a spiny, prickly shrub. This medicine was in
common use by the British Columbia Indians. The material was obtained
and used in this hospital for the treatment of diabetes and was found
to be quite as efficient as insulin and had the great advantage that it
would be taken by mouth whereas the insulin which is destroyed in the
stomach by the process of digestion must be injected. They could see
very little difference in the efficiency of this preparation whether
taken internally or used hypodermically. This promises to be a great
boon to a large group of individuals suffering from diabetes. It is
also probable that its use will prevent the development of diabetes and
since the Indians used it for other affections it may also become a
very important adjunct in modern preventive medicine.</p>

<p>    One of the sources that I have found to be helpful in studying
primitive races is an investigation of knapsacks. I have asked for the
privilege of seeing what is carried in their knapsacks. I found dried
fish eggs and dried kelp in the knapsacks in the high Andes. It is also
of interest that among this group in the Andes, among those in central
Africa, and among the Aborigines of Australia, each knapsack contained
a ball of clay, a little of which was dissolved in water. Into this
they dipped their morsels of food while eating. Their explanation was
to prevent "sick stomach." This is the medicine that is used by the
native in these countries for combating dysentery and food infections.
It is the treatment that was given me when I developed dysentery
infection in central Africa while making studies there. The English
doctor in Nairobi whom I called in said he would give me the native
treatment of a suspension of clay. It proved very effective. An
illustration of the way in which modern science is siowiy adopting
practices that have been long in use among primitive races, is to be
found in the recent extensive use that is made of clay (kaolin) in our
modern medicine. This is illustrated in the following: <font size=
"-2">(3)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   In the course of an expedition to Lake Titicaca,
South America, financed by the Percy Slade Trustees in which one of us
(H.P.M.) took part, an interesting observation was made in regard to
the diet of the Quetchus Indians on the Capachica Peninsula near Puno.
These people are almost certainly descendants of the Incas and at the
present time live very primitively. They exist largely on a vegetable
diet of which potatoes form an important part. Immediately, before
being eaten, the potatoes are dipped into an aqueous suspension of
clay, a procedure which is said to prevent "souring of the
stomach."</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">   We have examined this clay and found it to
consist of kaolin containing a trace of organic material, possibly
coumarin, and presumably a decomposition product of the grass from
underneath which the clay is dug. The local name for the clay is
Chacco, and the Indians distinguish between good and bad qualities.
This dietetic procedure is universal among the Indians of the Puno
district, and is probably of very ancient origin.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Such a practice by a primitive people would
appear rather remarkable in view of the comparatively recent
introduction of kaolin into modern medicine as a protective agent for
the gastric and intestinal mucosa and as a remedy for bacterial
infections of the gut.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    It is of interest that both the British and American
Pharmacopeias have added kaolin to their list during the last two
decades.</p>

<p>    The Indians of the past buried, with their dead, foods to carry
them on their journey. From an examination of these one learns that in
many respects the Indians living in the high Sierras are living today
very much as their ancestors did during past centuries. Items of
importance now and in the past are parched corn and parched beans which
are nibbled as the people walk along carrying their heavy burdens.
Today these are the only foods eaten on many long journeys. We found
the parched beans pleasant to taste and very satisfying when we were
hungry.</p>

<p>    The Indians of the Amazon Basin have had a history very
different from either those of the high Sierras of the Andes or those
of the coastal region. The fact that vast areas of the Amazon Basin
have not only never been surveyed, but never even penetrated, indicates
the nature of the isolation of these groups. Very little progress has
been made in the effort to conquer or modernize these Indians. A few
explorers have made expeditions into parts of the interior and have
reported the characteristics of the plant and animal life, as well as
of the native races. Our sole contact was with the tribe which came to
the coffee plantation to assist in the gathering and the harvest of the
coffee beans. In Chapter 14 I have described these people in
considerable detail. Since the Amazon Basin has vast quantities of rain
as well as abundant streams from the eastern watershed of the Andes,
the tribes live largely in tropical jungles where there is an abundance
of water. They are expert, accordingly, in the use of river crafts and
in fishing for the various types of marine life. Unlike the Indians of
the high Andes or of the coast regions they are not agriculturists.
They live on wild native foods almost entirely. They are expert with
the blow gun, with the bow and arrow and in snaring with both nets and
loops. They use very large quantities of a tuber root called yucca
which has many qualities similar to the roots of the edible variety of
the lily family. This plant is boiled and eaten much as are potatoes.
They use also large quantities of fish from the streams, birds and
small animals of the land, together with the native fruits including
bananas. Their dietary provides a very liberal supply of minerals and
vitamins together with an adequate quantity of carbohydrates, fats and
proteins.</p>

<p>    In evaluating the nutritive value of the dietary programs of
primitive races and our modernized cultures, it is important that we
have a yardstick adequately adjusted to make computation in terms of
specific body needs for building good bodies and maintaining them in
good health. The advance in modern chemistry has gone far toward making
this possible.</p>

<p>    The problem of estimating the mineral and activator contents, in
other words the body-building and repairing qualities of the displacing
foods used by the various primitive races, is similar in many respects
to estimating these qualities in the foods used in our modern white
civilizations, except that modern commerce has transported usually only
the foods that will keep well. These include chiefly white flour,
sugar, polished rice, vegetable fats and canned goods.</p>

<p>    Very important data for typical American dietaries are now
available provided by the Bureau of Home Economics, United States
Department of Agriculture, and also by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
United States Department of Labor. These surveys provide a basis of
estimating the nutrition of various income groups both with regard to
the type of foods selected in our American communities and the
quantities of each type used, together with the chemical content of
these foods expressed quantitatively. Those who wish to have detailed
reports are referred to the bulletins of the above departments. In my
clinical studies of the mineral constituents of individuals, affected
with dental caries and other disturbances of physical deficiency, I
find a wide range of variation in the calcium, phosphorus and
fat-soluble activator content of the dietaries used, although in
general the calorie content is adequate. This latter factor is
controlled by appetite. These computations reveal that the individuals
studied have a calcium intake ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 grams; and a
phosphorus intake of from 0.3 to 0.6 grams. The minimum adult
requirements as provided by such an authority as Sherman, whose figures
are used by the United States Department of Labor, are for the average
adult 0.68 of a gram of calcium and 1.32 grams of phosphorus per day.
It can be seen readily that the amounts given above are far short of
the minimum even if individuals absorbed from the foods all of the
minerals present. A question arises at this point as to the efficiency
of the human body in removing all of the minerals from the ingested
foods. Extensive laboratory determinations have shown that most people
cannot absorb more than half of the calcium and phosphorus from the
foods eaten. The amounts utilized depend directly on the presence of
other substances, particularly fat-soluble vitamins. It is at this
point probably that the greatest breakdown in our modern diet takes
place, namely, in the ingestion and utilization of adequate amounts of
the special activating substances, including the vitamins needed for
rendering the minerals in the food available to the human system. A
recent report by the Council on Foods of the American Medical <font
size="-2">(4)</font> Association makes this comment on spinach:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Spinach may be regarded as a rich source of
vitamin A and as a contributor of vitamin C, iron and roughage to the
diet. It is therefore a valuable food. (But) the iron is not well
utilized by infants . . . (and) the feeding of spinach is of no value
during early infancy as a source of calcium.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though calcium is present in spinach children cannot utilize
it. Data have been published showing that children absorb very little
of the calcium or phosphorus in spinach before six years of age. Adult
individuals vary in the efficiency with which they absorb minerals and
other chemicals essential for mineral utilization. It is possible to
starve for minerals that are abundant in the foods eaten because they
cannot be utilized without an adequate quantity of the fat-soluble
activators.</p>

<p>    This is illustrated in the following case. A minister in an
industrial section of our city, during the period of severe depression,
telephoned me stating that he had just been called to baptize a dying
child. The child was not dead although almost constantly in
convulsions. He thought the condition was probably nutritional and
asked if he could bring the boy to the office immediately. The boy was
badly emaciated, had rampant tooth decay, one leg in a cast, a very bad
bronchial cough and was in and out of convulsions in rapid succession.
His convulsions had been getting worse progressively during the past
eight months. His leg had been fractured two or three months previously
while walking across the room when he fell in one of his convulsions.
No healing had occurred. His diet consisted of white bread and skimmed
milk. For mending the fracture the boy needed minerals, calcium,
phosphorus and magnesium. His convulsions were due to a low calcium
content of the blood. All of these were in the skimmed milk for the
butter-fat removed in the cream contains no calcium nor phosphorus,
except traces. The program provided was a change from the white flour
bread to wheat gruel made from freshly ground wheat and the
substitution of whole milk for skimmed milk, with the addition of about
a teaspoonful of a very high vitamin butter with each feeding. He was
given this meal that evening when he returned to his home. He slept all
night without a convulsion. He was fed the same food five times the
next day and did not have a convulsion. He proceeded rapidly to regain
his health without recurrence of his convulsions. In a month the
fracture was united. Two views of the fracture are shown in Fig. 93,
one before and one after the treatment. Six weeks after this
nutritional program was started the preacher called at the home to see
how the boy was getting along. His mother stated that the boy was
playing about the doorstep, but they could not see him. She called but
received no answer. Presently they spied him where he had climbed up
the downspout of the house to the second story. On being scolded by his
mother, he ran and jumped over the garden fence, thus demonstrating
that he was pretty much of a normal boy. This boy's imperative need,
that was not provided in white bread and skimmed milk, was the presence
of the vitamins and other activators that are in whole milk but not in
skimmed milk, and in whole wheat, freshly ground, but not in white
flour. He was restored to health by the simple process of having
Nature's natural foods restored to him.</p>

<p>    This problem of borrowing from the skeleton in times of stress
may soften the bones so that they will be badly distorted. This is
frequently seen as bow legs. An illustration of an extreme condition of
bone softening by this process is shown in Fig. 94, lower section,
which is the skeleton of a monkey that was a house pet. It became very
fond of sweets and was fed on white bread, sweetened jams, etc., as it
ate at the same table with its mistress. Note that the bones became so
soft that the pull of the muscles distorted them into all sorts of
curves. Naturally its body and legs were seriously distorted. In this
condition my patient, whom I was serving professionally, asked me for
advice regarding her monkey's deformed legs and distorted body. I
suggested an improved nutrition and provided fat-soluble vitamins
consisting of a mixture of a high vitamin butter oil and high vitamin
cod liver oil with the result that minerals were deposited on the
borders of the vertebrae and joints and on the surfaces of the bones as
shown in the illustration. This of course, could not correct the
deformity and the animal was chloroformed.</p>

<p>    The necessity that the foods selected and used shall provide an
adequate quantity of fat-soluble activators (including the known
fatsoluble vitamins) is so imperative and is so important in preventing
a part of our modern degeneration that I shall illustrate its need with
another practical case.</p>

<p>    A mother asked my assistance in planning the nutritional program
for her boy. She reported that he was five years of age and that he had
been in bed in hospitals with rheumatic fever, arthritis and an acute
heart involvement most of the time for the past two and a half years.
She had been told that her boy would not recover, so severe were the
complications. As is so generally the case with rheumatic fever and
endocarditis, this boy was suffering from severe tooth decay. In this
connection the American Heart Association has reported that 75 per cent
of heart involvements begin before ten years of age. My studies have
shown that in about 95 per cent of these cases there is active tooth
decay. The important change that I made in this boy's dietary program
was the removal of the white flour products and in their stead the use
of freshly cracked or ground wheat and oats used with whole milk to
which was added a small amount of specially high vitamin butter
produced by cows pasturing on green wheat. Small doses of a
high-vitamin, natural cod liver oil were also added. At this time the
boy was so badly crippled with arthritis, in his swollen knees, wrists,
and rigid spine, that he was bedfast and cried by the hour. With the
improvement in his nutrition which was the only change made in his
care, his acute pain rapidly subsided, his appetite greatly improved,
he slept soundly and gained rapidly in weight. In the first view, to
the left, in Fig. 94, the boy is shown sitting on the edge of the bed
at the end of the first month on this program. His joints were still
badly swollen and his spine so rigid that he could not rotate his head
farther than shown in the picture. In the center view he is shown about
six months later, and in the third view, one year later. This occurred
six years ago. As I write this a letter has been received from the
boy's mother. She reports that he is taller and heavier than the
average, has a good appetite and sleeps well.</p>

<p>    In the newer light regarding the cause of rheumatic fever, or
inflammatory rheumatism (discussed in Chapter 21) there appear to be
three underlying causes: a general lowered defense against infection in
which the fat-soluble vitamins play a very important part; minute
hemorrhages in joint tissues as part of the expression of deficiency of
vitamin C, a scurvy symptom, and a source of infecting bacteria such as
streptococcus. This could be provided by his infected teeth. These
typical expressions of modern degeneration could not occur in most of
the primitive races studied because of the high factor of safety in the
minerals and vitamins of their nutrition. It is important to emphasize
the changes that were made in our modern dietary program to make this
boy's nutrition adequate for recovery. Sugars and sweets and white
flour products were eliminated as far as possible. Freshly ground
cereals were used for breads and gruels. Bone marrow was included in
stews. Liver and a liberal supply of whole milk, green vegetables and
fruits were provided. In addition, he was provided with a butter that
was very high in vitamins having been produced by cows fed on a rapidly
growing green grass. The best source for this is a pasturage of wheat
and rye grass. All green grass in a state of rapid growth is good,
although wheat and rye grass are the best found. Unless hay is
carefully dried so as to retain its chlorophyll, which is a precursor
of vitamin A, the cow cannot synthesize the fat-soluble vitamins.</p>

<p>    These two practical cases illustrate the fundamental necessity
that there shall not only be an adequate quantity of body-building
minerals present, but also that there shall be an adequate quantity of
fat-soluble vitamins. Of course, water-soluble vitamins are also
essential. While I have reduced the diets of the various primitive
races studied to definite quantities of mineral and calorie content,
these data are so voluminous that it will not be appropriate to include
them here. It will be more informative to discuss the ratios of both
body-building and repairing material in the several primitive
dietaries, in comparison with the displacing foods adopted from our
modern civilization. The amount of food eaten by an individual is
controlled primarily by the hunger factor which for our modernized
groups apparently relates only to need for heat and energy. The
dietaries adopted have all been built on the basis of the heat and
energy requirements of the body for the groups living in the several
districts and under their modes of life. These have been calculated for
the principal foods eaten by the various groups. The figures will be
published in detail in a more technical report. There are two simple
ways in which these comparisons can be made. One is in terms of normal
body requirements; and the other in terms of the ratio between the
mineral and the vitamin content of the native foods and the displacing
foods. If we use as a basis the ability of individuals to remove half
of the minerals present even though their bodies need more than this,
we will be more generous than the average individual's capacity will
justify. This will require that we double the amount, as specified for
minimum body use by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of
Labor Statistics, in their Bulletin R 409, that is, for calcium 0.68
grams; for phosphorus 1.32 grams; for iron 0.015 grams. The figures
that will be used, therefore, are for twice the above amounts: 1.36
grams of calcium; 2.64 grams of phosphorus; 0.030 grams of iron.</p>

<p>    Few people who have not been in contact with experimental data
on metabolism can appreciate how little of the minerals in the food are
retained in the body by large numbers of individuals who are in need of
these very chemicals. We have seen that infants cannot absorb calcium
from spinach. If we are to provide nutrition that will include an
adequate excess as a factor of safety for overloads, and for such
periods as those of rapid growth (for children), pregnancy, lactation
and sickness, we must provide the excess to the extent of about twice
the requirements of normal adults. It will therefore, be necessary for
an adequate nutrition to contain approximately four times the minimum
requirements of the average adult if all stress periods are to be
passed safely.</p>

<p>    It is of interest that the diets of the primitive groups which
have shown a very high immunity to dental caries and freedom from other
degenerative processes have all provided a nutrition containing at
least four times these minimum requirements; whereas the displacing
nutrition of commerce, consisting largely of white-flour products,
sugar, polished rice, jams, canned goods, and vegetable fats have
invariably failed to provide even the minimum requirements. In other
words the foods of the native Eskimos contained 5.4 times as much
calcium as the displacing foods of the white man, five times as much
phosphorus, 1.5 times as much iron, 7.9 times as much magnesium, 1.8
times as much copper, 49.0 times as much iodine, and at least ten times
that number of fat-soluble vitamins. For the Indians of the far North
of Canada, the native foods provided 5.8 times as much calcium, 5.8
times as much phosphorus, 2.7 times as much iron, 4.3 times as much
magnesium, 1.5 times as much copper, 8.8 times as much iodine, and at
least a ten fold increase in fat-soluble activators. For brevity, we
will apply the figures to calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron and
fat-soluble activators in order. The ratio in the Swiss native diets to
that in the displacing diet was for calcium, 3.7 fold; for phosphorus,
2.2 fold; for magnesium, 2.5 fold; for iron, 3.1 fold; and for the
fat-soluble activators, at least ten fold. For the Gaelics in the Outer
Hebrides, the native foods provided 2.1 times as much calcium, 2.3
times as much phosphorus, 1.3 times as much magnesium, and 1.0 times as
much iron; and the fat-soluble activators were increased at least ten
fold. For the Aborigines of Australia, living along the eastern coast
where they have access to sea foods the ratio of minerals in the native
diet to those in the displacing modernized foods was, for calcium, 4.6
fold; for phosphorus, 6.2 fold; for magnesium, 17 fold; and for iron
50.6 fold; while for the fatsoluble activators, it was at least ten
fold. The native diet of the New Zealand Maori provided an increase in
the native foods over the displacing foods of the modernized whites of
6.2 fold for calcium, 6.9 fold for phosphorus, 23.4 fold for magnesium,
58.3 fold for iron; and the fatsoluble activators were increased at
least ten fold. The native diet of the Melanesians provided similarly
an increase over the provision made in the modernized foods which
displaced them of 5.7 fold for calcium, 6.4 fold for phosphorus, 26.4
fold for magnesium, and 22.4 fold for iron; while the fat-soluble
activators were increased at least ten fold. The Polynesians provided
through their native diet for an increase in provision over that of the
displacing imported diets, of 5.6 fold for calcium, 7.2 fold for
phosphorus, 28.5 fold for magnesium, 18.6 fold for iron; and the
fat-soluble activators were increased at least ten fold. The coastal
Indians of Peru provided through their native primitive diets for an
increase in provision over that of the displacing modernized diet of
6.6 fold for calcium, 5.5 fold for phosphorus, 13.6 fold for magnesium,
5.1 fold for iron; and an excess of ten fold was provided for
fat-soluble vitamins. For the Indians of the Andean Mountains of Peru,
the native foods provided an increase over the provision of the
displacing modern foods of S fold for calcium, 5.5 fold for phosphorus,
13.3 fold for magnesium, 29.3 fold for iron; and an excess of at least
ten fold was provided for fat-soluble vitamins. For the cattle tribes
in the interior of Africa, the primitive foods provided an increase
over the provision of the displacing modernized foods of 7.5 fold for
calcium, 8.2 fold for phosphorus, 19.1 fold for magnesium, 16.6 fold
for iron and at least ten fold for fat-soluble activators. For the
agricultural tribes in Central Africa the native diet provided an
increase over the provision of the displacing modern diet of 3.5 fold
for calcium, 4.1 fold for phosphorus, 5.4 fold for magnesium, 16.6 fold
for iron and ten fold for fat-soluble activators. All the above
primitive diets provided also a large increase in the water-soluble
vitamins over the number provided in the displacing modern diets.</p>

<p>    From the data presented in the preceding chapters and in this
comparison of the primitive and modernized dietaries it is obvious that
there is great need that the grains eaten shall contain all the
minerals and vitamins which Nature has provided that they carry.
Important data might be presented to illustrate this phase in a
practical way. In Fig. 95 will be seen three rats all of which received
the same diet, except for the type of bread. The first rat (at the
left) received whole-wheat products freshly ground, the center one
received a white flour product and the third (at the right) a bran and
middlings product. The amounts of each ash, of calcium as the oxide,
and of phosphorus as the pentoxide; and the amounts of iron and copper
present in the diet of each group are shown by the height of the
columns beneath the rats. Clinically it will be seen that there is a
marked difference in the physical development Qf these rats. Several
rats of the same age were in each cage. The feeding was started after
weaning at about twenty-three days of age. The rat at the left was on
the entire grain product. It was fully developed. The rats in this cage
reproduced normally at three months of age. The rats in this first cage
had very mild dispositions and could be picked up by the ear or tail
without danger of their biting. The rats represented by the one in the
center cage using white flour were markedly undersized. Their hair came
out in large patches and they had very ugly dispositions, so ugly that
they threatened to spring through the cage wall at us when we came to
look at them. These rats had tooth decay and they were not able to
reproduce. The rats in the next cage (illustrated by the rat to the
right) which were on the bran and middlings mixture did not show tooth
decay, but were considerably undersized, and they lacked energy. The
flour and middlings for the rats in cages two and three were purchased
from the miller and hence were not freshly ground. The wheat given to
the first group was obtained whole and ground while fresh in a hand
mill. It is of interest that notwithstanding the great increase in ash,
calcium, phosphorus, iron and copper present in the foods of the last
group, the rats did not mature normally, as did those in the first
group. This may have been due in large part to the fact that the
material was not freshly ground, and as a result they could not obtain
a normal vitamin content from the embryo of the grain due to its
oxidation. This is further indicated by the fact that the rats in this
group did not reproduce, probably due in considerable part to a lack of
vitamins B and E which were lost by oxidation of the embryo or germ
fat.</p>

<p>    There is a misapprehension with regard to the possibility that
humans may obtain enough of the vitamin D group of activators from our
modern plant foods or from sunshine. This is due to the belief
viosterol or similar products by other names, derived by exposing
ergosterol to ultraviolet light, offer all of the nutritional factors
involved in the vitamin D group. I have emphasized that there are known
to be at least eight D factors that have been definitely isolated and
twelve that have been reported as partially isolated.</p>

<p>    Coffin has recently reported relative to the lack of vitamin D
in common foods as follows: <font size="-2">(5)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><font size="-1">A representative list of common foods was carefully
tested, by approved technique, for their vitamin D content.</font></li>

<li><font size="-1">With the remote possibility of egg yolks, butter,
cream, liver and fish it is manifestly impossible to obtain any amount
of vitamin D worthy of mention from common foods.</font></li>

<li><font size="-1">Vegetables do not contain vitamin D.</font></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>   It will be noted that vitamin D, which the human does not readily
synthesize in adequate amounts, must be provided by foods of animal
tissues or animal products. As yet I have not found a single group of
primitive racial stock which was building and maintaining excellent
bodies by living entirely on plant foods. I have found in many parts of
the world most devout representatives of modern ethical systems
advocating the restriction of foods to the vegetable products. In every
instance where the groups involved had been long under this teaching, I
found evidence of degeneration in the form of dental caries, and in the
new generation in the form of abnormal dental arches to an extent very
much higher than in the primitive groups who were not under this
influence.</p>

<p>    Many illustrations might be presented showing the special wisdom
of the primitives in the matter of reinforcing their nutrition with
protective foods.</p>

<p>    Few people will realize how reluctant members of the primitive
races are, in general, to disclose secrets of their race. The need for
this is comparable to the need for secrecy regarding modern war
devices.</p>

<p>    The Indians of the Yukon have long known the cure for scurvy and
history makes an important contribution to their wisdom in treating
this disease. It is of interest that W. N. Kemp <font size=
"-2">(6)</font> of Vancouver states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    The earliest recorded successful treatment of
scurvy occurred in Canada in 1535 when Jacques Cartier, on the advice
of a friendly Indian, gave his scurvyprostrated men a decoction of
young green succulent 'shoots' from the spruce trees with successful
results. These happy effects apparently were not appreciated in Europe,
for scurvy continued to be endemic.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Since that time untold thousands of mariners and white land
dwellers have died with this dreaded disease.</p>

<p>    Shortly before our arrival in Northern Canada a white prospector
had died of scurvy. Beside him was his white man's packet of canned
foods. Any Indian man or woman, boy or girl, could have told him how to
save his life by eating animal organs or the buds of trees.</p>

<p>    Another illustration of the wisdom of the native Indians of that
far north country came to me through two prospectors whom we rescued
and brought out with us just before the fall freeze-up. They had gone
into the district, which at that time was still uncharted and
unsurveyed, to prospect for precious metals and radium. They were both
doctors of engineering and science, and had been sent with very
elaborate equipment from one of the large national mining corporations.
Owing to the inaccessibility of the region, they adopted a plan for
reaching it quickly. They had flown across the two ranges of mountains
from Alaska and when they arrived at the inside range, i.e., the Rocky
Mountain Range, they found the altitude so high that their plane could
not fly over the range, and, as a result, they were brought down on a
little lake outside. The plane then returned but was unable to reach
the outside world because of shortage of fuel. The pilot had to leave
it on a waterway and trudge over the mountains to civilization. The two
prospectors undertook to carry their equipment and provisions over the
Rocky Mountain Range into the interior district where they were to
prospect. They found the distance across the plateau to be about one
hundred miles and the elevation ranging up to nine thousand feet. While
they had provisions and equipment to stay two years they found it would
take all of this time to carry their provisions and instruments across
this plateau. They accordingly abandoned everything, and rather than
remain in the country with very uncertain facilities and prospects for
obtaining food and shelter, made a forced march to the Liard River with
the hope that some expedition might be in that territory. One of the
men told me the following tragic story. While they were crossing the
high plateau he nearly went blind with so violent a pain in his eyes
that he feared he would go insane. It was not snow blindness, for they
were equipped with glasses. It was xeropthalmia, due to lack of vitamin
A. One day he almost ran into a mother grizzly bear and her two cubs.
Fortunately, they did not attack him but moved off. He sat down on a
stone and wept in despair of ever seeing his family again. As he sat
there holding his throbbing head, he heard a voice and looked up. It
was an old Indian who had been tracking that grizzly bear. He
recognized this prospector's plight and while neither could understand
the language of the other, the Indian after making an examination of
his eyes, took him by the hand and led him to a stream that was
coursing its way down the mountain. Here as the prospector sat waiting
the Indian built a trap of stones across the stream. He then went
upstream and waded down splashing as he came and thus drove the trout
into the trap. He threw the fish out on the bank and told the
prospector to eat the flesh of the head and the tissues back of the
eyes, including the eyes, with the result that in a few hours his pain
had largely subsided. In one day his sight was rapidly returning, and
in two days his eyes were nearly normal. He told me with profound
emotion and gratitude that that Indian had certainly saved his
life.</p>

<p>    Now modern science knows that one of the richest sources of
vitamin A in the entire animal body is that of the tissues back of the
eyes including the retina of the eye.</p>

<p>    In Chapter 18 I refer to the work of Wald on studies of vitamin
A tissues. He states that extracts of eye tissue (retina, pigment,
epithelium, and choroid) show the characteristic vitamin A absorption
band and that they are potent in curing vitamin A deficient rats. He
shows also that the concentration of vitamin A is constant for
different mammals.</p>

<p>    I have been impressed to find that primitive racial stocks in
various parts of the world are familiar with the fact that eyes
constitute an invaluable adjunct for nutrition. Even the one time
cannibals of the Fiji Islands, and the hereditary king of the Fiji
Islands, told me in detail of the practices with regard to the use of
eyes as an adjunct to diet. The chief, his father, and grandfather had
the privilege of reserving the eyes of captives for their personal use.
When among the natives of the islands north of Australia, I learned to
enjoy greatly fish head soup made from certain selected tissues. After
the fish had been cleaned the heads were split and the eyes left
in.</p>

<p>    The space of the entire book might be used for discussing the
nutritional wisdom of the various primitive races. It is a pity that so
much of their wisdom has been lost through lack of appreciation by the
whites who early made contact with them.</p>

CARIES</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">T</font>HE essential differences in the diets of the
primitive races and those of the modernized groups have been discussed
in the preceding chapter. We are concerned now with discovering whether
the use of foods, which are equivalent in body-building and repairing
material to those used by the primitives will, when provided to our
affected modernized groups, prevent tooth decay or check it when it is
active.</p>

<p>   There are two approaches to this problem of the control of tooth
decay by nutritional means. One is by the presentation of clinical
results and the other by the consideration of the characteristics of
those nutritional programs which have been successful in producing a
high immunity to tooth decay.</p>

<p>   We may divide the primitive racial stocks into groups, classified
according to the physical environment in which they are living and the
manner in which the environment largely controls their available foods.
It is significant that I have as yet found no group that was building
and maintaining good bodies exclusively on plant foods. A number of
groups are endeavoring to do so with marked evidence of failure. The
variety of animal foods available has varied widely in some groups, and
been limited among others.</p>

<p>   In the preceding chapter we have seen that the successful
dietaries included in addition to a liberal source of minerals,
carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water-soluble vitamins, a source of
fat-soluble vitamins.</p>

<p>   Vitamin D is not found in plants, but must be sought in an animal
food. The dietaries of the efficient primitive racial stocks may be
divided into groups on this basis: in the first place those obtaining
their fatsoluble activators, which include the known fat-soluble
vitamins, from efficient dairy products. This includes the Swiss in the
high Alps, the Arabs (using camel's milk), and the Asiatic races (using
milk of sheep and musk ox). In the second place there are those using
liberally the organs of animals, and the eggs of birds, wild and
domesticated. These include the Indians of the far North, the buffalo
hunting Plains Indians and the Andean tribes. In the third place there
are those using liberally animal life of the sea. These include Pacific
Islanders and coastal tribes throughout the world. In the fourth place
there are those using small animals and insects. These include the
Australian Aborigines in the interior, and the African tribes in the
interior.</p>

<p>   Many of the above groups use foods from two or more sources. Each
of the groups has provided an adequate quantity of body-building
material from both animal and plant tissues. It does not matter what
the source of minerals and vitamins may be so long as the supply is
adequate. In our modern life, the location of a group will determine
the most efficient and most convenient source for obtaining the
essential foods. Clearly, for those near the coast, the sea may be most
convenient, while for those in the interior or in the far North, dairy
products or the organs of animals may be the only available source. It
would be fortunate indeed, if our problems were as simple as this
statement might indicate. We have, however, in the first place, the
need for a strength of character and will power such as will make us
use the things our bodies require rather than only the foods we like.
Another problem arises from the fact that our modern sedentary lives
call for so little energy that many people will not eat enough even of
a good food to provide for both growth and repair, since hunger appeals
are for energy only, the source of heat and power, and not for
body-building minerals and other chemicals. Still another problem
confronts us, i.e., the sources of fatsoluble activators indicated
above, namely: dairy products, organs of animals and sea foods, may
vary through a wide range in their content of the fat-soluble
activators or vitamins, depending upon the nutrition available for the
animals. Cows fed on third grade hay, too low in carotene, not only
cannot produce strong calves but their milk will not keep healthy
calves alive. (Chapter 18.)</p>

<p>   The League of Nations' Committee on Nutrition has estimated the
amount of pasture land required per capita to provide adequate milk and
meat. Owing to the density of population and cost of land near large
cities, it is not possible to provide an adequate acreage for dairy
cattle. This results in stall feeding of shipped fodder. Only those
cows can be kept in a herd whose production of milk and butter fat can
pay in volume for their keep. Unfortunately milk may have a high cream
line or butter fat content and still be low in essential fat-soluble
vitamins. This constitutes an exceedingly important phase of our modern
problem. Butter ships best when hard and this quality can be largely
controlled by the fodder given to the cattle and hence becomes an
important factor in the wholesale butter industry. Since 1927, I have
been analyzing samples of dairy products, chiefly butter, from several
parts of the world for their vitamin content. These samples are
received every two to four weeks from the same places, usually for
several years. They all show a seasonal rise and fall in vitamin
content. The high level is always associated with the use of rapidly
growing young plant food. This tide in plant life, fluctuating with the
seasons, controlled the migration of the buffalo southward in the
autumn and winter and northward in the spring. They moved at the rate
of about twelve miles per day, travelling with the sun in order to
provide the highest-vitamin milk for the young calves born in the
south. No doubt these tides in nutrition control also the migration of
birds. By far the most efficient plant food that I have found for
producing the high-vitamin content in milk is rapidly growing young
wheat and rye grass. Oat and barley grass are also excellent. In my
clinical work small additions of this high-vitamin butter to otherwise
satisfactory diets regularly checks tooth decay when active and at the
same time improves vitality and general health.</p>

<p>   Similarly the value of eggs for providing fat-soluble vitamins
depends directly upon the food eaten by the fowl. The fertility of the
eggs also is a direct measure of the vitamin content, including vitamin
E.</p>

<p>   Since the sea foods are, as a group, so valuable a source of the
fatsoluble activators, they have been found to be efficient throughout
the world not only for controlling tooth decay, but for producing a
human stock of high vitality. Unfortunately the cost of transportation
in the fresh state often constitutes a factor limiting distribution.
Many of the primitive races preserved the food value, including
vitamins, very efficiently by drying the fish. While our modern system
of canning prevents decomposition, it does not efficiently preserve
some of the fatsoluble activators, particularly vitamin A.</p>

<p>   Since the organs, particularly the livers of animals, are storage
depots of the vitamins an important source of some of the fat-soluble
activators can be provided by extracting the fat of the livers and
shipping it as liver oils. Modern methods of processing have greatly
improved the quality of these oils. There are some factors, however,
which can be provided to great advantage for humans from dairy products
of high efficiency.</p>

<p>   I have shown in the preceding chapter the quantities of several
of the minerals that are essential in suitable chemical form to
maintain an adult in good health and make possible tissue repair. The
dietaries of the various primitive groups have all been shown to have a
mineral content several times higher than that which obtains in the
inadequate food eaten by modernized primitives and the people of our
modernized cultures.</p>

<p>   Modern commerce has deliberately robbed some of nature's foods of
much of their body-building material while retaining the hunger
satisfying energy factors. For example, in the production of refined
white flour approximately eighty per cent or four-fifths of the
phosphorus and calcium content are usually removed, together with the
vitamins and minerals provided in the embryo or germ. The evidence
indicates that a very important factor in the lowering of reproductive
efficiency of womanhood is directly related to the removal of vitamin E
in the processing of wheat. The germ of wheat is our most readily
available source of that vitamin. Its role as a nutritive factor for
the pituitary gland in the base of the brain, which largely controls
growth and organ function, apparently is important in determining the
production of mental types. Similarly the removal of vitamin B with the
embryo of the wheat, together with its oxidation after processing,
results in depletion of body-building activators.</p>

<p>   Refined white sugar carries only negligible traces of
body-building and repairing material. It satisfies hunger by providing
heat and energy besides having a pleasant flavor. The heat and energy
producing factors in our food that are not burned up are usually stored
as fat. In the preceding chapter we have seen that approximately half
of the foods provided in our modern dietaries furnish little or no
body-building or repairing material and supply no vitamins.
Approximately 25 per cent of the heat and energy of the American people
is supplied by sugar alone which goes far in thwarting Nature's orderly
processes of life. This per capita use is unfortunately on the
increase. Therefore we must begin by radically reducing the foods that
are so deceptive, and often injurious in overloading the system. Even
this much change in our modern nutrition will raise the factor of
safety sufficiently to check tooth decay in a large percentage of
people. It will not, however, be adequate for most children in whom the
additional demands of rapid growth must be satisfied. I have found the
highest incidence of tooth decay in the high school and boarding school
girls, and the next in the boarding school boys. These groups suffer
even more than the childbearing mothers.</p>

<p>   In discussing the technical aspects later I shall consider the
defensive factors in the saliva as controlled by the nutrition through
the blood stream, and also the role of oral prophylaxis.</p>

<p>   It is appropriate at this point to note some characteristics of a
decaying tooth. The process of tooth decay never starts from within but
always from without and is most likely to start at the contact points
between the teeth or in the pits and grooves, especially when these are
incompletely formed. Teeth never have caries while they are covered
with flesh but decay most easily soon after eruption, when conditions
are unfavorable. If the saliva is normal the surfaces of the teeth
progressively harden during the first year after eruption. While there
are many theories regarding the relative importance of different
factors in the process of decay practically all provide for a local
solution of the tooth substance by acids produced by bacteria. The
essential difference in the various theories of tooth decay is the
difference in theories relative to the control of these decalcifying
organisms, and relative to their quantity and activity. The dental
profession has been waiting for decades for this question to be solved
before taking active steps to prevent the whole process. The primitive
approach has been to provide a program that will keep the teeth well,
that is, prevention of dental caries by adequate food combinations. I
have just stated that teeth harden after eruption if the saliva is
normal. This occurs by a process of mineralization much like the
process by which petrified wood is produced.</p>

<p>   The tooth is made up of four structures. The first is the pulp
within, which carries blood vessels and nerves. This structure is
surrounded in both the root and crown by the dentine or tooth bone
which is nourished from within. The dentine of the root is covered by
cementum which receives nourishment from the membrane which attaches
the root to the jaw bone. The dentine of the crown or exposed part of
the tooth is covered with enamel. Tooth decay proceeds slowly through
the enamel and often rapidly in the dentine, always following the
minute channels toward the pulp, which may become infected before the
decay actually reaches the pulp to expose it; nearly always the decay
infects the pulp when it destroys the dentine covering it. When a tooth
has a deep cavity of decay, the decalcified dentine has about the
density of rotten wood. With an adequate improvement in nutrition,
tooth decay will generally be checked provided two conditions are
present: in the first place, there must be enough improvement in the
quality of the saliva; and in the second, the saliva must have free
access to the cavity. Of course, if the decay is removed and a filling
placed in the cavity, the bacteria will be mechanically shut out. One
of the most severe tests of a nutritional program, accordingly, is the
test of its power to check tooth decay completely, even without
fillings. There are, however, two further tests of the sufficiency of
improvement of the chemical content of the saliva. If it has been
sufficiently improved, bacterial growth will not only be inhibited, but
the leathery decayed dentine will become mineralized from the saliva by
a process similar to petrification. Note that this mineralized dentine
is not vital, nor does it increase in volume and fill the cavity. When
scraped with a steel instrument it frequently takes on a density like
very hard wood and occasionally takes even a glassy surface. When such
a tooth is placed in silver nitrate, the chemical does not penetrate
this demineralized dentine, though it does rapidly penetrate the
decayed dentine of a tooth extracted when decay is active. This process
is illustrated in Fig. 96 which shows two deciduous teeth extracted
from the same child, one before, and the other a few months after
improving the nutrition. These deciduous molars were replaced by the
bicuspids of the second dentition. The tooth at the left had deep
caries and was removed before the treatment was begun. Note that the
silver nitrate has blackened the tissue to the depth of the decay. The
tooth at the right was removed about three months after the nutrition
was changed. Note that the decayed dentine is so dense that the silver
nitrate has not penetrated deeply and discolored it.</p>

<p>   There is still another test that demonstrates Nature's protective
mechanisms. Ordinarily, when the pulp of a tooth is exposed by dental
caries, the pulp becomes not only infected, but dies opening up a
highway of infection direct from the infected mouth to the inside of
the fort at the end of the root. One expression of this is a dental
abscess, the existence of which is usually unknown to the individual
for sometime and the infecting germs pass more or less freely
throughout the body by way of the blood stream and lymph channels. This
infection may start the degeneration of organs and tissues of other
parts of the body.</p>

<p>   Among some of the primitive races, whose nutritional programs
provided a very high factor of safety, even though the teeth were worn
down to the gum line and into what was formerly the pulp chamber, the
pulp was not exposed. Nature had built a protecting zone, not in the
cavity of the tooth in this case, but within the pulp chamber. This
entirely blocked off a threatened exposure and kept the walls of the
fort sealed against bacteria. This process does not occur in many
instances in people of our modern civilization. Pulp chambers that are
opened by wear provide exposed pulp which becomes infected with
subsequent abscess formation. If a reinforced nutrition as efficient as
that of many of the primitive races, is adopted, the pulp tissue will
seal up the opening made by decalcification of the dentine, by building
in a new layer of normal dentine which is vital and quite unlike the
petrified decay exposed to the saliva, thus completely walling off the
impending danger. This is illustrated in Fig. 97 with three cases. At
the left are shown x-rays of teeth of three children in one of my
experimental clinics in a poor district in Cleveland. The pulp chambers
and pulp tissues of the root canals are shown as dark streaks in the
center of the tooth. The very large cavities which had decalcified the
tooth to the pulp chamber are shown as large dark areas in the crown.
Temporary fillings had to be placed because of pain produced by the
pressure of food on the pulp below the decayed dentine. After the
nutrition was improved, the tissues of the pulp built in secondary
dentine thus reincasing itself in a closed chamber. This process is
shown in each of the three cases presented in Fig. 97, in the views to
the right.</p>

<p>   Under the stress of the industrial depression the family dietary
of the children shown in Fig. 97 was very deficient. They were brought
to a mission where we fed them one reinforced meal at noon for six days
a week. The home meals were not changed nor the home care of the teeth.
The preliminary studies of each child included complete x-rays of all
of the teeth, a chemical analysis of the saliva, a careful plotting of
the position, size and depth of all cavities, a record of the height,
and weight, and a record of school grades, including grades in
deportment. These checks were repeated every four to six weeks for the
period of the test, usually three to five months. It is important to
note that the home nutrition which had been responsible for the tooth
decay was exceedingly low in body building and repairing material,
while temporarily satisfying the appetite. It usually consisted of
highly sweetened strong coffee and white bread, vegetable fat, pancakes
made of white flour and eaten with syrup, and doughnuts fried in
vegetable fat.</p>

<p>   The nutrition provided these children in this one meal included
the following foods. About four ounces of tomato juice or orange juice
and a teaspoonful of a mixture of equal parts of a very high vitamin
natural cod liver oil and an especially high vitamin butter was given
at the beginning of the meal. They then received a bowl containing
approximately a pint of a very rich vegetable and meat stew, made
largely from bone marrow and fine cuts of tender meat: the meat was
usually broiled separately to retain its juice and then chopped very
fine and added to the bone marrow meat soup which always contained
finely chopped vegetables and plenty of very yellow carrots; for the
next course they had cooked fruit, with very little sweetening, and
rolls made from freshly ground whole wheat, which were spread with the
high-vitamin butter. The wheat for the rolls was ground fresh every day
in a motor driven coffee mill. Each child was also given two glasses of
fresh whole milk. The menu was varied from day to day by substituting
for the meat stew, fish chowder or organs of animals. From time to
time, there was placed in a two quart jar a helping similar to that
eaten by the children. This was brought to my laboratory for chemical
analysis, which analysis showed that these meals provided approximately
1.48 grams of calcium and 1.28 grams of phosphorus in a single helping
of each course. Since many of the children doubled up on the course,
their intake of these minerals was much higher. I have shown in the
preceding chapter that the accepted figures for the requirements of the
body for calcium and phosphorus are 0.68 grams of calcium and 1.32
grams of phosphorus. It is obvious that this one meal a day plus the
other two meals at home provided a real factor of safety. Clinically
this program completely controlled the dental caries of each member of
the group.</p>

<p>   The chemical analysis of the saliva <font size="-2">(1, 2)</font>
revealed a marked improvement which progressively increased. At the
beginning of the test the average for the group showed a very low
factor of safety, so low that we should expect tooth decay to be
active. In six weeks the average changed to a condition which we should
expect would be accompanied by a cessation of tooth decay. The saliva
factor of safety continued to improve for five months at which time the
special program was discontinued for the summer.</p>

<p>   Several incidents of special interest occurred. Two different
teachers came to me to inquire what had been done to make a particular
child change from one of the poorest in the class in capacity to learn
to one of the best. Dental caries is only one of the many expressions
of our modern deficient nutritions.</p>

<p>   I have referred to the importance of a high vitamin butter for
providing the fat-soluble activators to make possible the utilization
of the minerals in the foods. In this connection, it is of interest
that butter constitutes the principal source of these essential factors
for many primitive groups throughout the world. In the high mountain
and plateau district in northern India, and in Tibet, the inhabitants
depend largely upon butter made from the milk of the musk ox and the
sheep for these activators. The butter is eaten mixed with roasted
cereals, is used in tea, and in a porridge made of tea, butter and
roasted grains. In Sudan Egypt, I found considerable traffic in high
vitamin butter which came from the higher lands a few miles from the
Nile Basin. This was being exchanged for and used with varieties of
millet grown in other districts. This butter, at the temperature of
that area, which ranged from 90&deg; to 110&deg; Fahrenheit, was, of
course, always in liquid form. Its brilliant orange color testified to
the splendid pasture of the dairy animals. The people in Sudan,
including the Arabs, had exceptionally fine teeth with exceedingly
little tooth decay (Chapter 9). The most physically perfect people in
northern India are probably the Pathans who live on dairy products
largely in the form of soured curd, together with wheat and vegetables.
The people are very tall and are free of tooth decay.</p>

<p>   Probably every housewife is familiar with the low melting quality
of the butter produced in early summer when the cows have been put on
the green pastures. This is particularly true of butter that has the
grassy flavor and the deep yellow to orange color. This butter is
usually several times as high in fat-soluble activators including
vitamins A and D as butter produced from stall fed cattle or cattle on
poorer pasturage. In Chapter 15, I have explained why this butter is
not favorable for shipping and why dairymen so frequently give the cows
a ration that will produce less of these qualities. One of the
principal foods used for accomplishing this is made of cotton seed meal
and cereals.</p>

<p>   There are many illustrations of the low efficiency of this type
of fodder for providing vitamins essential for dairy products. In one
of the recent severe droughts in the Mississippi Valley several
thousand cattle were shipped to Ohio for water and green pasture as a
means of saving their lives. They were fed enroute on concentrates said
to consist of cotton seed meal and grain. Professor Oscar Erf of the
Department of Dairying of Ohio State University has given me the
following detailed information:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   With reference to the cattle from the
south-western and central-northern states of the drought area which
were brought into Ohio in the fall of 1935 on a 600 acre farm north of
Delaware, will say that I had the privilege of viewing some of these
cattle previous to the time that they were brought to Ohio in 1935.
Because of the extreme drought period and the hot sun, it was rare to
see green grass on the prairies. The sedges were nearly all dried up.
The tumbleweed was about the only thing that was available for the
cattle in some instances. The corn was dried up and very little green
was in evidence. In the particular location that I was in we found the
cattle suffering terribly. Many had infected eyes.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">   There were a good many deaths on the plains which
were literally dried up. Sometimes there was even a small amount of
decomposition after death. In the fall, those that survived on the
plains, were loaded up and driven to the corrals, loaded into cars and
sent east. Only the good ones were loaded and even a large number of
these passed out in transit.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">   I was informed that the crop of grass the year
before was very scant. Consequently, a large number of calves were born
with weak eyes and these were the early ones to pass out on the plains.
The low vitality of the individuals which I considered was due to the
lack of vitamin A or the green grass factors was the cause of the
serious infection, however their being secondary to the primary
cause.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">   The first train load of the twenty-eight hundred
cattle that were brought to this ranch were fed on green corn stalks.
There was a nine acre patch of corn in this area. The fences were taken
down one afternoon at 3 o'clock and by 9 o'clock there was no evidence
of stubbles or roots. This had all been eaten in a very short space of
time. We had quite a time getting hays and green stuff which we
demanded because of its carotin content and its green grass factor.
There was not enough grass available in the beginning so we had to buy
about 400 tons of hay a day to keep the animals fed. They got no grain
of any kind because it was a question of bringing the cattle to a more
or less normal condition with no intention of fattening the
animals.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">   After they had made arrangements for feeding
operations and made feed racks in sufficient numbers, we went over the
herd to estimate the numbers that were blind and had sore eyes, which I
assume from past experience, was due to a vitamin A deficiency. As near
as we can estimate, nearly 8 12 animals were affected (29 per cent).
There were 157 calves born and approximately 50 per cent were deformed
and not normal. We did not get the complete figures but they probably
ranged a little higher than that. The worst infected cows were calves
and animals that were 18 to 20 months old. I could not get the story of
these individuals but they must have been in the area of dry grass for
2 years. There was a slight improvement in those that were not
seriously infected after they were fed here. They improved decidedly in
October and November and were practically all slaughtered before the
middle of December.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The milk of these vitamin deficient cows would not properly nourish
either their calves or human beings.</p>

<p>   Many children have tooth decay even while using whole milk, in
part because the milk is too low in vitamin content, due to the
inadequacy of the food given the cows. The means for improving this
condition have been discussed in Chapter 15.</p>

<p>   Some of the current theories of the chemistry of tooth decay
place the responsibility on the local condition in the mouth as
affected by the contributing factors provided by sugars and starches
which enhance the growth of acid producing organisms. A phase of this
has been closely related to the slogan that a clean tooth cannot decay.
Among the difficulties in applying this interpretation is the physical
impossibility of keeping teeth bacteriologically clean in the
environment of the mouth. Another difficulty is the fact that many
primitive races have their teeth smeared with starchy foods almost
constantly and make no effort whatsoever to clean their teeth. In spite
of this they have no tooth decay. In many of the primitive groups that
I have studied the process of modernization includes teaching oral
hygiene and prophylaxis. Yet, even with the addition of this important
adjunct to health, they have in most cases lost their immunity to tooth
decay and dental caries has become active. This will be seen in many of
the illustrations of the primitive races in the preceding chapters. Of
course everyone should clean his teeth, even the primitives, in the
interest of and out of consideration for others.</p>

<p>   In my clinical work I have sought for extreme cases of active
tooth decay in order to test the primitive wisdom. Many of these cases
have been furnished by members of the dental profession in other cities
and states. By the simple procedure of studying the nutrition of the
individual, obtaining a sample of saliva for analysis, seeing x-rays of
the individual's teeth and supporting bone, and getting a history of
the systemic overloads, I have been able to outline a nutritional
program which, in well above 90 per cent of the cases has controlled
the dental caries. Improvement in the condition of the teeth has been
confirmed by later x-rays and reports by the patients' dentists. In a
few cases where I had contact with the patients only through
correspondence the cooperation was not adequate for accomplishing
complete improvement. While it is true that there is a marked
difference in the susceptibility of different individuals to dental
caries, even those who would ordinarily be classed as highly
susceptible, have generally received permanent benefit from the
treatment.</p>

<p>   These principles of treatment have now been applied to many
hundreds of patients as indicated by the fact that over 2,800 chemical
analyses of the saliva have been made. The dietary programs that have
been recommended have been determined on the basis of a study of the
nutrition used by the patient, the data provided by the x-rays, from
the saliva analysis and case history. The diets have been found to be
deficient in minerals, chiefly phosphorus. Fat-soluble vitamins have
been deficient in practically every case of active tooth decay. The
foods selected for reinforcing the deficient nutritions have always
included additional fatsoluble vitamins and a liberal source of
minerals in the form of natural food. Human beings cannot absorb
minerals satisfactorily from inorganic chemicals. Great harm is done,
in my judgment, by the sale and use of substitutes for natural
foods.</p>

<p>   One of our greatest difficulties in undertaking to apply the
wisdom of the primitives to our modern problems involves a character
factor. The Indians of the high Andes were willing to go hundreds of
miles to the sea to get kelp and fish eggs for the use of their people.
Yet many of our modern people are unwilling to take sufficient trouble
to obtain foods that are competent to accomplish the desired
results.</p>

<p>   Jobbers and middlemen as well as supply depot managers want
butter sold in accordance with its label rather than in accordance with
its vitamin content. One large distributor whom I asked to cooperate by
maintaining a stock of high-vitamin butter to which I could refer
people, told me frankly that he wished I would stop telling people
about the difference in the vitamins in butter. He did not wish them to
think of butter in terms of its vitamin content. Another large concern
told me that when I had worked up a sufficiently large market they
would become interested in supplying the demand. I counsel people to
put in storage some of that butter which has the grassy flavor and
which melts easily and is produced when the cows go onto the rapidly
growing young grass. Unfortunately, cows that have been on a stable
fodder low in carotene and under the stress of gestation often are so
depleted in their own body vitamins that it takes them three or four
weeks to replenish their own bodies when they get on good pasture. Then
the vitamins will appear in liberal quantity in their milk. This has
made it necessary for me to assist many patients in obtaining a supply
by analyzing butter for its vitamin content and then putting this
material in storage and making it available for special cases as
needed.</p>

<p>   The program that I have found most efficient has been one which
includes the use of small quantities of very high vitamin butter mixed
in equal parts with a very high vitamin cod liver oil. A simple method
of preparing the butter is by melting it and allowing it to cool for
twenty-four hours at a temperature of about 70&deg; F., then
centrifugalizing it which provides an oil that remains liquid at room
temperature. When this butter oil is mixed in equal parts with a very
high-vitamin cod liver oil, it produces a product that is more
efficient than either alone. It should be used within a couple of weeks
of the time it is mixed. It is desirable that this material be made
available in various parts of the country. Even the high-vitamin butter
produced on the early summer growth of grass put in storage and used
during the winter will go far toward solving our great national problem
of shortage of fat-soluble vitamins. The quantity of the mixture of
butter oil and cod liver oil required is quite small, half a
teaspoonful three times a day with meals is sufficient to control
wide-spread tooth decay when used with a diet that is low in sugar and
starches and high in foods providing the minerals, particularly
phosphorus. A teaspoonful a day divided between two or three meals is
usually adequate to prevent dental caries and maintain a high immunity;
it will also maintain freedom from colds and a high level of health in
general. This reinforcement of the fat-soluble vitamins to a menu that
is low in starches and sugars, together with the use of bread and
cereal grains freshly ground to retain the full content of the embryo
or germ, and with milk for growing children and for many adults, and
the liberal use of sea foods and organs of animals, produced the result
described.</p>

<p>   I have previously reported <font size="-2">(3)</font> seventeen
cases of extensive dental caries. In these patients there were found
237 open cavities of apparently active caries. Most of the individuals
were between twelve and twenty years of age and accordingly had
twenty-eight permanent teeth each, or a total of 476. It will be noted
that if one cavity is allowed per tooth, approximately half of the
total number of teeth were affected, or precisely 49.7 per cent of all
the teeth had open cavities. This group includes only persons of whom I
have been making critical examination every six to twelve months over a
three-year period. In practically all cases, Roentgen-ray examinations
were made in addition to clinical examinations of the teeth. While
these persons have been on the reinforced nutritional program during
the winter and spring months of the past three years, only two new
cavities have developed in the group, or 0.4 per cent. The length of
time during which the cavities previously found had been developing is
not known beyond the fact that all of the patients were receiving
frequent and thorough dental service, most of them twice a year and
many of them more frequently. It is accordingly probable that the
cavities found had developed in less than a year. That dental caries
was not a new problem with these persons was indicated by the very
extensive and numerous dental restorations that had been made in their
mouths. It is, therefore, apparent that 250 times as many cavities
developed in the period preceding the starting of the nutritional
program as in the three years following its adoption. If these data
were reduced to a yearly basis, the comparison would show a much wider
variation.</p>

<p>   In a group of fifty persons, including the above mentioned
seventeen, who had been on the special nutritional program for from one
to six years, most of them three years or more, only two new cavities
developed. Allowing these persons to have an average of twenty-eight
teeth per person, or a total of 1,400 teeth, this would represent an
incidence of dental caries in a period of three years of 0.14 per cent.
In this group of fifty, there are many instructive and striking
cases.</p>

<p>   For example, H. F. did not have a single cavity from October,
1932, to June, 1933, while taking additional vitamins and high mineral
foods. From June, 1933, to May, 1934, while not taking the special
vitamins, she developed ten new cavities.</p>

<p>   S. K., prior to 1931 had rampant tooth decay with pulps nearly
exposed in all first permanent molars. The remaining deciduous teeth
had been reduced to shells. She was on the special nutritional program
from December, 1931, to June, 1932, during which time caries was
completely arrested. She discontinued taking special oil in June, 1932,
and did not take it again until October, 1933, during most of which
time she was taking viosterol under a physician's prescription to
prevent dental caries. She came in October, 1933, with fourteen new
cavities. She was immediately placed again on the special program, from
October, 1933, to May, 1934. During this period, the dental caries was
completely under control. During the time that she was not on the
special program, there developed on many of the surfaces of the
permanent teeth white patches of decalcifying enamel. Under the
reinforced nutritional program, these largely disappeared, and those
that did not regain their translucency turned dark.</p>

<p>   Among the group of seventeen J. H., sent in from another city,
had thirty-eight open cavities in June, 193 1. In addition to active
caries, he had quite disturbing heart symptoms, which curtailed his
activity, and he also had a marked sense of lassitude and weariness. He
has been on the reinforced nutritional program during the fall, winter
and spring of each year since that time. During this time, he has not
developed a single new cavity. The density of all the teeth has
progressively improved as evidenced by Roentgen-ray records. His
physical condition has been greatly improved so that he is able to
carry on his college activities and heavy outside work to earn money to
maintain his college expenses. He is not conscious of a heart
limitation. When asked what the principal change was that he had
noticed, he said that in addition to not feeling tired, he was more
rested with six hours' sleep than formerly with ten hours'.</p>

<p>   A. W. had thirty-two new cavities in the two years previous to
beginning the special nutritional reinforcement. She continued this
regularly during the winter and spring months for three years and has
not had a single new cavity since that time.</p>

<p>   In a group of children whose mothers had the special nutritional
reinforcement during gestation and lactation and who had been provided
with the same dietary adjuncts during the winter and spring months of
infancy and early childhood, not a single carious cavity has developed.
A number of these children are now in public schools. Their physical
development is distinctly above that of the average children of their
age, as is also their efficiency in school work.</p>

<p>   It is important that I emphasize here some dangers that are not
usually recognized or properly emphasized in the literature. When fish
oils including cod liver oils are given in too large doses to some
patients they experience quite definite symptoms of depression. The
available evidence indicates that fish oils that have been exposed to
the air may develop toxic substances. My work and that of others with
experimental animals has demonstrated that paralysis can be produced
readily by over-dosing. Serious structural damage can be done to hearts
and kidneys. I have reported this in considerable detail. <font size=
"-2">(4)</font> My investigations have shown that when a high vitamin
natural cod liver oil is used in conjunction with a high vitamin butter
oil the mixture is much more efficient than either alone.4 This makes
it possible to use very small doses. Except in the late stages of
pregnancy I do not prescribe more than half a teaspoonful with each of
three meals a day. This procedure appears to obviate completely the
undesirable effects. As stated elsewhere fish oils should be stored in
small containers to avoid exposure to the air. Rancid fats and oils
destroy vitamins A and E, <font size="-2">(5)</font> the former in the
stomach. <font size="-2">(6)</font></p>

<p><font size="-2">   </font> I am frequently reminded that ancient
skulls are often found with extensive dental caries thus disproving
that the primitive groups were more free from dental caries than the
modern groups. It must be kept in mind that the fundamental laws of
Nature have been in operation as long as animals and men have been on
the earth. In my investigations among primitive races, I have been
concerned particularly with the study of changes that have taken place
both in immunity to dental caries and in the environment, including the
foods used. It has been important that I find large groups with
relatively high immunity to dental caries to be used as controls. There
is great need, accordingly, that additional data be provided.
Fortunately, this need is being met. There have just come to my desk
two interesting reports; one, from Dr. Arne Hoygaard <font size=
"-2">(7)</font> and the other from Dr. P. O. Pedersen. <font size=
"-2">(8)</font> These two distinguished scientists have spent a year in
East Greenland among the Eskimos in that very barren and isolated
region. The percentage of teeth found attacked by dental caries among
the isolated Eskimos of East Greenland is exceedingly low, less than 1
per cent. Where the Eskimos were in contact with modernized store foods
at the port, tooth decay was active. The conditions which they have
found were apparently not quite so favorable as in the groups I studied
in Alaska. The Greenland Eskimos apparently are living in a more
difficult environment. The data provided by these investigations are in
accord with the data I have obtained among isolated Eskimos and other
primitive racial stocks. Eastern Greenland, by international agreement,
is administered by the Danish Government and no one is permitted even
to visit the coast of Greenland without special permission. This
permission is very difficult to obtain. Even Danish citizens are not
free to travel there. We are, accordingly, very grateful to Dr.
Hoygaard and Dr. Pedersen for their contribution from studies made in
that protected field. We shall look forward with interest to their
detailed reports.</p>

<p>   Unfortunately, the public is very much at sea because of the
extravagant claims that are made for many of the products advertised
over the radio, in journals, and by door to door solicitation. A
dependable and helpful booklet on the vitamin content of foods has been
published by the United States Department of Agriculture, Miscellaneous
Publications, No. 275. The fact should always be emphasized that foods
as Nature makes them have much more nutritional value than after they
are processed so that insect life cannot live on them. When foods
cannot support insect life they cannot support human life.</p>

<p>   A report has just appeared in the September number of the New
Zealand Dental Journal by H. H. Tocker on behalf of the Hawkes Bay
Branch of the New Zealand Dental Association in which he reports the
results of the application of my suggestions in the Hukarere School for
native Maori girls at Napier. I have reported my studies there in
Chapter 12. They used only one part of my suggestions for checking the
activity of dental caries. The diet of both their control group and
tested group was the same except for one item, i.e., "one heaped
teaspoonful twice daily of malt and cod liver oil." In a group of
sixty-six native girls the thirty-three with the best teeth were used
as a control group. The remaining thirty-three were given the
additional fat-soluble vitamins. In six months' time ~resistance of
this group was raised by 41.75 per cent" as compared with the control
group. The nutrition of the test group was not adequately reinforced to
obtain the best results. There was a marked inadequacy of mineral
carrying foods in proportion to the energy and heat providing factors
in the foods. An adequate quantity of such efficient foods should be as
readily available today as before the white men came to New
Zealand.</p>

<p>   It is important to summarize at this point some of the data that
I have developed in other chapters because of their direct relation to
the control of dental caries and other degenerative processes. Since
human life like other animal life has been developed in Nature's
laboratory to fit Nature's natural foods we run a great risk when we
undertake to modify seriously these foods. Bakers' so-called whole
wheat bread is not comparable to Nature's foods that provide entire
wheat and other cereals, because of the factors that have been removed
from the wheat either mechanically or by oxidation. This is so large a
problem that adequate changes in the available grain foods cannot be
made until there 15 sufficient public demand to produce them through
the normal channels of supply and demand. It is primarily a problem for
our Federal and State governments. Packaged foods containing dry
cereals can undergo important changes, even while the material is being
processed or while in packages on the shelves. The determinations of
the loss of vitamins in packaged foods as reported in 1938 by the
Agricultural Experimental Station of Oklahoma Agricultural and
Mechanical College, reveal that a material loss occurs in two weeks'
time and a very serious loss in one to two months' time in certain
stock rations.</p>

<p>   An important source of misapprehension is the literature and
teachings of fadists. Such, for example, as the misapprehension of many
people that they must use only alkaline producing foods and that a
great danger is associated with the use of acid producing foods. In the
primitive races I have found practically no difference between the acid
balance meat diet of the isolated Eskimos of the far north and the less
acid vegetable and milk diet of other groups as efficient factors in
control of caries. It is important to keep in mind that our bodies have
a mechanism for maintaining proper acid and alkali balance in the blood
and this varies through only a very narrow limit whether the balance of
the total food eaten is acid or alkaline. It is also important to have
in mind that there are certain fat-soluble vitamins provided in dairy
products in adequate quantity that cannot all be supplied in fish oils.
Also that overdosing with cod liver oil and other fish oils can be
definitely detrimental. When packages of cod liver oil are purchased
from the trade the material should be received in full containers not
exposed to air and when opened should be transferred to small units so
it is not progressively oxidized during the period of its use.</p>

<p>   The excess of calories over body building minerals is exceedingly
high in sweets of various kinds regardless of their special branding
and the methods of manufacture and storage. There is very little of the
body building minerals in maple syrup, cane syrup from sugar or honey.
They can all defeat an otherwise efficient dietary. The problem is not
so simple as merely cutting down or eliminating sugars and white flour
though this is exceedingly important. It is also necessary that
adequate mineral and vitamin carrying foods be made available. It is
also necessary to realize that many of our important foods for
providing vitamins are very low in body building material. For example,
one would have to eat nearly a bushel of apples a day or half a bushel
of oranges to obtain a liberal factor of safety for providing
phosphorus; similarly one would be required to eat nine and one half
pounds of carrots or eleven pounds of beets each day to get enough
phosphorus for a liberal factor of safety, while this quantity would be
provided in one pound of lentils or beans, wheat or oats. I have
discussed elsewhere the availability of phosphorus depending upon its
chemical form. Since the calories largely determine the satisfying of
the appetite and since under ordinary circumstances we stop when we
have obtained about two thousand to twenty-five hundred very little of
the highly sweetened fruits defeats our nutritional program. We would
have to consume daily the contents of thirty-two one pound jars of
marmalade, jellies or jams to provide a two gram intake of phosphorus.
This quantity would provide 32,500 calories; an amount impossible for
the system to take care of.</p>

<p>   Milk is one of the best foods for providing minerals but it may
be inadequate in several vitamins. Of all of the primitive groups
studied those using sea foods abundantly appear to obtain an adequate
quantity of minerals particularly phosphorus with the greatest ease, in
part because the fat-soluble vitamins provided in the sea foods (by
which I mean animal life of the sea) are usually high. This enables a
more efficient utilization of the minerals, calcium and phosphorus.</p>

<p>   As I study routinely the sample dietaries being used by people
suffering from dental caries, usually associated with other
disturbances, I find large numbers who are not getting in their food
even half the minimum requirements of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium
and iron and usually only a fraction of the minimum requirements of the
fat-soluble vitamins. These latter have a role which in many respects
is like the battery of an automobile which provides the spark for
igniting the fuel. Even though the tank is filled with gasoline there
is no power without the igniting spark.</p>

<p>   There are two programs now available for meeting the dental
caries problem. One is to know first in detail all the physical and
chemical factors involved and then proceed. The other is to know how to
prevent the disease as the primitives have shown and then proceed. The
former is largely the practice of the moderns. The latter is the
program suggested by these investigations. Available data indicate that
the blood and saliva normally carry defensive factors which when
present control the growth of the acid producing organisms and the
local reactions at tooth surfaces. When these defensive factors are not
present the acid producing organisms multiply and produce an acid which
dissolves tooth structure. The origin of this protective factor is
provided in nutrition and is directly related to the mineral content of
the foods and to known and unknown vitamins particularly the
fat-soluble. Clinical data demonstrate that by following the program
outlined dental caries can be prevented or controlled when active in
practically all individuals. This does not require either permission or
prescription but it is the inherent right of every individual. A
properly balanced diet is good for the entire body.</p>

DEFORMITIES</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">F</font>ACES are classified on the basis of physical
characteristics and appearances which identify them as having a common
ancestry. The constant reproduction of ancestral patterns constitutes
one of the fundamental laws of heredity. We are concerned here with the
divergences from the normal course of reproduction.</p>

<p>    The precision with which Nature reproduces widely distributed
racial stocks demonstrates how deeply seated and controlling are the
Mendelian laws. In Fig. 98 may be seen four young men of the Melanesian
race born on four different islands. They have never seen each other,
yet they look like brothers. Similarly, in Fig. 99 are shown four
Polynesian girls. Here again they look so much alike that they might
readily be taken for sisters. Yet, they live in four different groups
of Polynesian islands; the Hawaiian, the Samoan, the Tahitian, and the
Rarotongan.</p>

<p>    The blending of different racial stocks produces typical
characteristics of either or both ancestral patterns. When, however,
marked divergences appear without mixing of racial stocks, the result
is not due to heredity, but occurs in spite of heredity. In the
previous chapters, I have shown that in the modernized groups of
various primitive racial stocks, ccrtain individuals developed marked
changes in facial and dental arch form from the racial pattern. We are
interested to know the nature of the forces responsible for this
distortion of the ancestral pattern. In a study of 1,276 skulls of the
ancient civilizations of Peru, I did not find one with a typical
divergence from normal such as we find in modern whites or in children
of primitive racial stocks after the parents have adopted the foods of
our modern civilization. It is important that we study this phase in
further detail.</p>

<p>    In Fig. 100 are shown two Indian fathers and their sons, whom we
studied in Peru. The father and son shown above lived at Talara, in a
highly modernized Indian colony. The father worked in the oil fields on
the coast. This district is an arid desert into which practically all
food has to be shipped for the large colony engaged in the oil
industry. The father was born while his parents were using the native
foods of the coast, including an abundance of sea foods. The son was
born to his parents after they had adopted the foods of modern
civilization. The father and son shown below, lived in the high
Sierras. The father is an Indian descendant of the Incas and was born
while his parents were living on the native dietary of the high plateau
country, near Cuzco. After the adoption of the modern foods by the
parents, the son shown to the right was born. It is important to keep
in mind that the marked change in these fathers and sons has occurred
in the first generation after the parents have adopted the white man's
foods, and has occurred in spite of heredity.</p>

<p>    In Fig. 101 above is shown a Wakamba father in central Africa, a
man who is working for the railroad company which contributed largely
to the food supply for the laborers. The boy shown at the right was
born after the parents had adopted the imported foods. In the lower
picture, in Fig. 101, is seen a Fiji Islander and his son. The father
was born to parents living on the native foods, and his son was born
after the adoption of the white man's foods. All these are typical
cases of the inhibition of Nature's normal procedure. We have
additional data which indicate that our problem is associated with a
progressive lowering of reproductive capacity on the part of one or
both of the parents.</p>

<p>    In photographing the members of modernized families, regardless
of racial stocks, we frequently find that changes in facial expression
appear in the younger members of the family. This change in facial
contour within a family does not occur in the primitive races, while on
their native dietary.</p>

<p>    In contrast with this we see, in Fig. 102, two sisters and two
brothers. In each pair there is a marked change in the facial form of
the younger. The arches and the nostrils of the younger child are
narrower and there is a marked lack of development in both the middle
and lower thirds of the face.</p>

<p>    Very striking illustrations of this progressive degeneration in
the children of a given family were found among the modernized
aborigines of Australia. Two views of brothers are shown in Fig. 103
(upper). The father and mother of these two boys were born in the Bush.
They were living, when photographed, in one of the reservations, on the
imported modern foods which were provided by the government. This is
also illustrated in the lower photograph. Note the marked
underdevelopment of the middle third of the face of the girl.</p>

<p>    Striking instances were frequently seen among the modernized
Maori of New Zealand. Two sisters presenting two extremes of facial
form are shown in the upper section of Fig. 104. The girl to the left
is the older. She has the typical tribal pattern which has been
completely lost in her younger sister to the right.</p>

<p>    If the change in facial form were the result of racial
admixture, we should not have the types of deformity patterns that
these cases show. Indeed, in the same family we should not find several
different deformity patterns. The lack of development downward of the
upper anterior incisors and the bone supporting them is illustrated for
the younger child, in Fig. 103 lower right. It will be noted that when
this girl's molar teeth are in contact her front teeth still miss
occluding by a considerable distance.</p>

<p>    Members of the white race are affected in a similar manner. In
Fig. 104 (lower) are shown two sisters; the younger to the right
reveals strikingly the lack of development of the middle and lower
third of the face. The fact that this condition so frequently shows a
progressively severe injury in the younger members of the family is a
matter of great importance in tracing the causative factors. It is
important to keep in mind that when the injury shows in the face of the
young child it becomes worse when the adult face forms. This increase
in deformity occurs at the time of the development of the permanent
dentition, at from ten to fourteen years of age.</p>

<p>    In the islands north of Australia where contact with modern
civilization is just being made, the adult individuals showed a
constant reproduction of the tribal pattern, while those born since
contact was made, had many divergences from normal. In Fig. 105 will be
seen a family of six individuals. Four were born before the modern
store was put on that island and two after the parents had come into
contact with the influence of the imported foods. It will be seen that
the four older brothers show marked uniformity of facial design, and
that all have reproduced the tribal pattern. The two younger members
show definite change in facial pattern. This is also illustrated in
Fig. 106 above, in which the oldest brother was born before the store
was put on Badu Island, and the three younger, after the establishment
of the store twenty-three years ago.</p>

<p>    This problem of progressive degeneration in the younger members
of the family is again illustrated by the group shown in Fig. 107. The
older girl has reproduced the tribal pattern of the race with normal
broad, dental arches. The second girl shows marked narrowing and
lengthening of the face. The third child, a boy, shows very marked
divergence from the tribal pattern. This group is shown below with
their teeth exposed. It will be seen that the oldest girl has broad
dental arches typical of Nature's normal design. The second girl has a
marked depression laterally in the molar and bicuspid region producing
a narrowing of the palate. The third child has in addition to the
narrowing of the face a marked deficiency in bone growth so that the
cuspids both above and below are forced entirely outside the arch. The
total circumference as well as the breadth of the upper arch is so
reduced that space is not available for the cuspids. They will be seen
imbedded high in the tissue, as illustrated in the lower picture of
Fig. 106.</p>

<p>    It would be remarkable if these disturbances in the physical
pattern were limited to the face and dental arches. An illustration of
other deficiency injuries is shown in Fig. 109, which shows three
children in a modernized Maori family. It will be seen that while the
oldest girl has the typical Maori racial pattern of face, there is a
marked lack of development of the middle third of the face, with
progressive severity of distortion in her two younger brothers. On
observing the feet it will be seen that she has splendidly formed feet
while the second child has flat feet, and the third child has clubbed
feet.</p>

<p>    I have found similar examples in several of the modernized
primitive racial stocks. The severity of the disturbing factors may be
different under different circumstances. Drought, industrial
depression, unemployment, and the like, all have their influence. In
Fig. 110 will be seen three Maori children of New Zealand; the second
child is smaller in stature than the third and gives more evidence of
facial injury. While his older sister and younger brother have normal
feet, his quite severe disturbance in facial growth is associated with
club feet.</p>

<p>    I have one patient who was the seventh of a family of eleven
children. All the children in the family have good facial development,
except this patient. She was born in the midst of a severe financial
depression when the total amount of money available for the food for
the family was reduced to a very low level. The other children were
born before or after the depression, and were not injured. In addition
to this patient's severe facial deformity, she has had some arthritis
and a general rheumatic tendency. Her facial injury is marked and is
characterized by a lack of development of the middle third.</p>

<p>    Deformities of the feet associated with facial deformity have
been found in several modernized groups of primitive racial stocks. A
typical case among the modernized Indians of Peru is shown in Fig. 111.
The face of this boy shows abnormal development with narrowing of the
upper arch and displacement of the teeth. This is associated with gross
deformity of one foot and shortening of the leg. He lives in the high
country. This phase is strikingly illustrated in Fig. 112 where the
face is very badly injured and both feet are seriously clubbed. This
boy is a Coastal Indian.</p>

<p>    The serious expressions of physical deformities which we found
had occurred in several primitive racial stocks, after they have become
modernized sufficiently to be using the foods of our modern
civilization, are occurring in our modern American families with equal
severity and great frequency.</p>

<p>    One method for determining the cause of these deformities is
through an examination of birth and death certificates to note the
recorded data relative to physical deformities. An outstanding
contribution to this approach has been made by Dr. D. P. Murphy, of the
University of Pennsylvania. In an examination of 130,132 individual
death certificates that have been recorded between 1929 and 1933, he
found physical deformities recorded in 1,476 cases. Dr. Murphy sent
field workers to make a personal study of the family histories by
contacting the mothers or grandmothers, of whom they were able to
locate 890. From this group he was able to select 405 with sufficiently
complete family histories to allow tabulation in a form that would
throw light upon the birth rank and other data. His studies strongly
emphasize the presence of a period of low reproductive activity. In
concluding one of his reports he states: <font size="-2">(1)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   Miscarriages, stillbirths, and premature births
occurred more often than would be expected by chance in the pregnancies
immediately preceding and immediately following the pregnancy which
resulted in the birth of a defective child, and less often than would
be expected by chance in the remaining pregnancies. Miscarriage,
stillbirth, and premature birth occurred most often in the pregnancy
immediately preceding that of the defective child.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    From the above observations, it is concluded
that the birth of a congenitally malformed child may be only one
expression of a prolonged decrease in functional reproductive activity,
the other expressions being miscarriages, stillbirths, and premature
births.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    It is suggested that the obstetrician has
unusual reason to suspect the possible existence of a congenital
malformation in the pregnancy which follows immediately after a
miscarriage, a stillbirth, or a premature birth.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Shute, of the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, in
a personal communication, states that he has been impressed, in his
studies of aborted fetuses, with the large percentage that are
malformed. This seems to link the malformations with the causative
factors which have resulted in decreased reproductive activity.</p>

<p>    In connection with the production of imperfect infants, the
period in the formative process at which the injury occurs and also its
origin are important. Murphy has thrown important light on this phase
in his study of the cause of the defectives in forty families with two
or more malformed. <font size="-2">(2)</font> He concludes: "Many if
not most of the congenital malformations met with in this study
resulted from defects in the germ plasm, which were present before
fertilization."</p>

<p>   Among the important questions that arise is the relative
responsibility of the two parents. As an approach to this phase Murphy
<font size="-2">(2)</font> has made a study which deals with a
consecutive series of 884 families in each of which there appeared at
least one congenitally malformed child. In forty of these families,
there were two or more malformed brothers and sisters. He presents
extensive data in tabular form from which he takes examples to
illustrate his interpretation. He states under the "Clinical Value of
Study" the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    It is evident from the above data (tables) that
there is a strong tendency for congenital malformations to duplicate in
siblings that belong to a consecutive series of families. And also that
such defects tend to appear rather frequently among their more distant
relatives. This duplication of malformations is to be observed in the
case of the more serious types of defects, just as it is noticed in the
less serious ones. These findings lend support to the theory that
congenital malformations are primarily the result of influences which
affect the germ cells prior to, rather than after, fertilization. The
validity of this theory is emphasized by three examples taken from
Tables I and II. Family 17 in Table I contained 3 children with pyloric
stenosis, two of which were twins. Family 6 in Table II possessed 2
siblings with cleft palate, conceived by the same father, but born to
different mothers. Family 8 in Table II contained 2 children both
exhibiting an absence of the right half of the diaphragm. It does not
seem likely that such sequences of events as these could be the result
of any forces that did not operate until after fertilization had taken
place. . . .</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Since, as has been shown in a previous report,
congenital malformations are 24 times more common in siblings of
defective children than in the population at large, the present
observations should be of added clinical interest.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="-1">Summary and Conclusions</font></p>

<ol>
<li><font size="-1">A consecutive series of 40 families having 2 or
more congenitally malformed children has been studied with respect to
the duplication of defects in siblings.</font></li>

<li><font size="-1">The defect observed in the first malformed child
reappeared in a subsequent malformed sibling in about 50 per cent of
all cases; the 50 per cent remaining including all other possible
defects.</font></li>

<li><font size="-1">In a second group of 39 consecutive families, in
which a malformed child possessed a malformed relative, the
malformation in the child and in the relative were identical in about
41 per cent of cases.</font></li>

<li><font size="-1">In 19 non-consecutive families with 2 or more
malformed children, the defect of the first child repeated in a
subsequent child in over half of the families.</font></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>    It is significant that while these important factors are just
coming to light in our modernized civilization, the evidence clearly
indicates that several so-called primitive races have been conscious of
the need for safeguarding motherhood from reproductive overloads which
would reduce the capacity for efficient reproduction. For example, G.
T. Baden <font size="-2">(3)</font> in his book "Among the Ibos of
Nigeria" states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    It is not only a matter of disgrace but an
actual abomination, for an Ibo woman to bear children at shorter
intervals than about three years. . . . The idea of a fixed minimum
period between births is based on several sound principles. The belief
prevails strongly that it is necessary for this interval to elapse in
order to ensure the mother being able to recuperate her strength
completely, and thus be in a thoroughly fit condition to bear another
child. Should a second child be born within the prescribed period the
theory is held that it must inevitably be weak and sickly, and its
chances jeopardized.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Similarly, the Indians of Peru, Ecuador and Columbia have been
familiar with the necessity of preventing pregnancy overloads of the
mother. Whiffen <font size="-2">(4)</font> in his book "North-West
Amazons" states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> <font size="-1">   The numbers (of pregnant women) are remarkable
in view of the fact that husbands abstain from any intercourse with
their wives, not only during pregnancy but also throughout the period
of lactation--far more prolonged with them than with Europeans. The
result is that two and a half years between each child is the minimum
difference of age, and in the majority of cases it is even
greater.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    It may also be important to note that the Amazon Indians have
been conscious of the fact that these matters are related to the
nutrition of both parents. Whiffen states that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    These Indians share the belief of many peoples
of the lower cultures that the food eaten by the parents--to some
degree of both parents--will have a definite influence upon the birth,
appearance, or character of the child.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    This problem of the consciousness among primitives of the need
for spacing children has been emphasized by George Brown <font size=
"-2">(5)</font> in his studies among Melanesians and Polynesians in
which he reports relative to the natives on one of the Solomon Islands
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   After the birth of a child the husband was not
supposed to cohabit with his wife until the child could walk. If a
child was weak or sickly, the people would say, speaking of the
parents, "Ah, well, they have only themselves to blame."</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>   These new data have a very important bearing on the problems of
degeneration in our modern civilization. Since it is true that a racial
pattern can be changed in a single generation our modern concept and
teaching with regard to the role of heredity must be modified, in its
relationship to cause and effect. A deformity arising from intercepted
heredity is just as truly biologic as a deformity arising from
accumulated impacts as expressed in heredity. Instead of blaming the
past generations for the distortions or frailties of our modern
generation and thus relieving our own generation of responsibility
these new data indicate that the social organization that is creating
these divergencies from normal must alone accept the
responsibility.</p>

<p>    This completely changes some aspects of the theories and
practice of modern social education. Instead of planning the care and
management of distorted personality as though the lesion were the
result of environmental influences upon a normally organized
individual, it should be looked upon as a distortion affecting one link
in the chain of heredity which is neither the result of the distortions
of previous links nor a controlling factor for future links in the
chain. The prognosis, in other words, while being bad for the
individual is not necessarily bad for his or her descendants.</p>

<p>    While many of the individuals who have suffered physical
distortions have apparently practically normal brain development we
shall see in the following chapter that a certain percentage have so
great a disturbance in brain organization that they cannot and should
not be considered as individually responsible for their behavior.</p>

<p>    It is urgent therefore that the data presented in this chapter
be looked upon as an important key to the progressive degeneration that
is taking place in many parts of the world under the influence of our
so-called modern civilization. It is a matter of profound significance
that the most primitive races were originally able to avoid the
physical degeneration so general in many communities today. It is also
a matter of importance that the primitives recognized not only these
dangers but were conscious of and practiced adequate means for
preventing them. They had sufficient character to achieve the ends
which they deemed essential. Weakness in character may constitute the
greatest barrier in the reorganization and conservation of our modern
civilization.</p>

<p>    Two serious defects from which many individuals in our
modernized civilization suffer are impacted teeth and the absence of
teeth due to their failure to develop. It is significant that in the
arches of the primitive races practically all teeth form and erupt
normally, including the third molars. In the modernized primitives and
among our modern whites with deformed dental arches many teeth are
impacted and often several of the permanent teeth have never formed.
The evidence indicates that this, like the facial and dental arch
deformities is due to an absence of vitamin A in the diet of the mother
during the gestation period or of one or both of the parents prior to
conception. The cause is discussed in the next chapter.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">PRENATAL NUTRITIONAL DEFORMITIES
AND<br>
DISEASE TYPES</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">A</font> RELATIONSHIP between physical types and
certain disease susceptibilities has been recognized by diagnosticians
for centuries. The skill of many physicians in reading intuitively and
from external signs the nature of their patients' troubles when these
could not be classified with precision played an important part in the
successful warfare against disease in the period preceding the advance
in modern laboratory technique. For many of the old-time physicians,
these constitutional qualities were expressed as diathesis. An
individual would be recognized as having a phthisical diathesis (a
susceptibility to tuberculosis). Similarly, the arthritis group had a
rheumatic diathesis. While modern science has undertaken to express its
findings numerically, the problem of reducing the diatheses to
mathematical formulas has required so many overlappings, that it has
been impossible to establish definite limiting boundaries.</p>

<p>    In my investigations regarding the types of individuals who
develop rheumatic group lesions as a result of dental focal infections,
<font size="-2">(1)</font> I found that individuals could be divided
into very definite groups in which 15.05 per cent with severe lesions
belonged to families in which similar disease symptoms had occurred.
Evidence was disclosed of a systemic factor that played a controlling
role in determining whether or not the individual would be seriously
injured from dental focal infections. It became very clear that the
soil was quite as important a determining factor as was the type of
infection. This finding led me to broaden the scope of my
investigations to include a search for control cases that were free
from the degenerative processes. I was not able to find these controls
in the clinical material afforded by our modern civilization, and
therefore extended the search to isolated primitive racial stocks.</p>

<p>    Associated with a fine physical condition the isolated primitive
groups have a high level of immunity to many of our modern degenerative
processes, including tuberculosis, arthritis, heart disease, and
affections of the internal organs. When, however, these individuals
have lost this high level of physical excellence a definite lowering in
their resistance to the modern degenerative processes has taken place.
To illustrate, the narrowing of the facial and dental arch forms of the
children of the modernized parents, after they had adopted the white
man's food, was accompanied by an increase in susceptibility to
pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<p>    In Fig. 113 will be seen four young people, examined in the
tuberculosis wards of the Juneau (Alaska) Hospital for Indians and
Eskimos. All exhibited marked evidence of prenatal injury. Note the
cuspids erupting outside the line of the arch. The teeth of the upper
arch of the boy at the upper left, pass inside the teeth of the lower
arch. His upper arch is so narrow that even a finger could not be
passed between the lateral walls. These pictures had to be taken with
short exposures in the poor light of the wards. They reveal, however,
the conditions.</p>

<p>    While we know many of the factors contributing to the nature of
diatheses, I have found no data dealing with the forces which determine
diatheses, except the influence of heredity. The data I am presenting
in this volume, deal with forces other than heredity.</p>

<p>    An outstanding advance in organizing the data which relate the
physical characteristics of individuals to their disease
susceptibilities has been made by the Constitutional Clinic of Columbia
University and the Presbyterian Hospital of New York, under the able
direction of Dr. George Draper. He has found it necessary in order to
study man as a whole, to view him from four different angles: "his
form, his function, his immunity mechanism and his psychology." These
four attributes he has designated as the "four panels of personality."
Dr. Draper has published several communications including two
textbooks, one entitled, "Human Constitution," <font size=
"-2">(2)</font> and the other, "Disease and the Man." <font size=
"-2">(3)</font> Dr. Draper has approached this problem from the data
provided in the medical clinics, and therefore, from the
characteristics of affected individuals, whereas my approach has been
through a study of the primitive groups and the physical changes and
disease susceptibilities which occur as a result of their
modernization. The similarity of our conclusions greatly emphasizes the
importance of the findings of each. Dr. Draper has emphasized the
importance of the face and of the dental arches in the general matter
of susceptibility to disease. He closes one of his chapters, entitled
<i>The Relation of Face, Jaws and Teeth to Human Constitution and Its
Bearing on Disease,</i> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    The lessons which we have learned from these
observations, however, is that the face and jaws hold much information
of value to the student of the human being. As clinicians in the field
of internal medicine we have been taught to observe the gums and teeth
in order to detect possible foci of infection. But for the student of
clinical organismalism, the teeth and jaws hold much valuable
information about the total personality. For the worker in the dental
branch of medicine it would seem that an unusual opportunity is offered
for extending such observations and correlations. It may very well be
that the dental student who becomes interested in the relation of the
mouth to the organism may form a most important link with the
responsibilities of internal medicine.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    The more we come to view man as a totality, as
an organism which functions as a whole and not as a collection of
separate elements, the more do all the special branches of medicine
become fused with the general concept which forms the basis of this
discussion, namely, the relation of the human organism as a whole to
those various reactions of maladjustment with environment which we call
disease.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    It is clear that a definite association of abnormal facial
patterns with specific disease susceptibilities exists. From my studies
it is also clear that these abnormal facial patterns are associated
with influences resulting from a change in the nutrition of the parents
of the individual. We are at this point concerned with the forces that
underlie these phenomena.</p>

<p>    In approaching this problem as it applies to human beings, much
can be learned from a study of domestic and wild animals. Until recent
years it has been common knowledge among the superintendents of large
zoos of America and Europe that members of the cat family did not
reproduce efficiently in captivity, unless the mothers had been born in
the jungle. Formerly, this made it necessary to replenish lions,
tigers, leopards and other felines from wild stock as fast as the cages
were emptied by death or as rapidly as new stock should be added by
enlargement.</p>

<p>    The story is told of a trip to Africa made by a wild animal
specialist from the London zoo for the purpose of obtaining additional
lions and studying this problem. While in the lion country, he observed
the lion kill a zebra. The lion proceeded then to tear open the abdomen
of the zebra and eat the entrails at the right flank. This took him
directly to the liver. After spending some time selecting different
internal organs, the lion backed away and turned and pawed dirt over
the carcass which he abandoned to the jackals. The scientist hurried to
the carcass and drove away the jackals to study the dead zebra to note
what tissues had been taken. This gave him the clue which when put into
practice has entirely changed the history of the reproduction of the
cat family in captivity. The addition of the organs to the foods of the
captive animals born in the jungle supplied them with foods needed to
make reproduction possible. Their young, too, could reproduce
efficiently. As I studied this matter with the director of a large lion
colony, he listed in detail the organs and tissues that were
particularly selected by animals in the wilds and also those that were
provided for animals reproducing in captivity. He explained that,
whereas the price of lions used to be fifteen hundred dollars for a
good specimen, they were now so plentiful that they would scarcely
bring fifteen cents. If we observe the parts of an animal that a cat
eats when it kills a small rodent or bird, we see that it does not
select exclusively the muscle meat.</p>

<p>    During my biological investigations using animals, I have had
barn rats gnaw their way into the room where the rabbits were kept and
kill several animals during a night. On two different occasions, only
the eyes of the rabbits had been eaten, and the blood may have been
sucked. On another occasion the brains had been eaten. It was evident
that these rats had a conscious need for special food elements that
were provided by these tissues.</p>

<p>    No phases of the problem of physical degeneration can be as
important as knowledge of the forces that are at work and the methods
by which they operate. It is clear from the data presented in previous
chapters that these forces can become operative with sufficient speed
to make a difference in two generations, one succeeding the other. It
is also clear from preceding data that these forces originate in the
change of the nutrition of the parents.</p>

<p>    A chemical analysis of the food (Chapter 15), discloses a marked
reduction in the intake of some of the vitamins and minerals in
individuals who are undergoing a degenerative process.</p>

<p>    Many investigators have presented important data dealing with
the role of vitamin A in prenatal as well as postnatal growth
processes. It is known that the eye is one of the early tissues to
develop injury from the absence of vitamin A, hence the original name
for this vitamin was the xerophthalmic vitamin. The importance of
vitamin A to the eye, and the fact that this vitamin is stored in eye
tissue have been emphasized by several investigations.</p>

<p>    Wald <font size="-2">(4)</font> in discussing vitamin A in eye
tissues states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Extracts of eye tissue (retina, pigment
epithelium and choroid) showed the characteristic vitamin A absorption
band at 620 mu. with the SbC13 test and were also potent in curing
vitamin A deficient rats. The concentration of vitamin A was very
constant for different mammals, at about 20 Y per g. dry tissue. Values
for frog tissues were much higher.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    This comment is of interest in connection with the observation
that I have previously quoted regarding the raid of barn rats on the
rabbit cages in the stress of deep winter. While it has been shown that
vitamin A is essential for the normal function of eyes, its role in the
formation of eye tissues has not been clearly understood. Probably the
most sensitive procedure for testing the depletion of vitamin A in
domestic animals today is by observing their behavior in
semi-darkness.</p>

<p>    Edward Mellanby <font size="-2">(5)</font> has presented
important new data dealing with vitamin A deficiency and deafness. He
states in an abstract of a paper read before the Biochemical Society,
in London in November 1937, the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    In previous publications I have shown that a
prominent lesion caused by vitamin A deficiency in young animals,
especially when accompanied by a high cereal intake, is degeneration of
the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the peripheral system it
is the afferent nerves which are principally affected, including the
eighth nerve, both cochlear and vestibular divisions. It has now been
possible to show that vitamin A deficiency produces in young dogs
degenerative changes in the ganglia, nerves and organs of both hearing
and balance inside the temporal bone. All degrees of degeneration have
been produced, from slight degeneration to complete disappearance of
the hearing nerve. The nerves and ganglion cells supplying the organ of
Corti are more easily damaged than those of the vestibular division. As
might be expected when once the spiral ganglion cells have disappeared,
additions of vitamin A to the diet have no effect, and the organ of
Corti remains completely denervated. The "inattention" of dogs on these
diets which I previously ascribed to cerebral defect is undoubtedly due
to deafness. It now remains to determine whether these results may be
extended to explain certain forms of deafness in man.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    The serious effects of deficiency in vitamin A on pregnant rats
has been investigated and reported by Mason <font size="-2">(6)</font>
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Abnormalities are described in the pregnancies
of rats maintained on diets deficient in vitamin A in varying degree.
Prolongation of the gestation period up to 26 days in severe cases and
a long and difficult labour which might last 2 days and often resulted
in death of both mother and young were characteristic.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Defects due to deficiencies in vitamin A in the diet of dairy
animals, (pregnant cows, their offspring and normal calves fed on the
milk from those cows) have been reported upon by Meigs and Converse
<font size="-2">(7)</font> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    In 1932 we reported from Beltsville evidence
that farm rations frequently fed to calves may be dangerously low in
vitamin A, and that milk produced by cows fed hay which has lost its
green color may be an unsafe source of vitamin A in the calf ration.
This preliminary paper reported results dealing with four cows which
had been fed over two years on a good grain mixture and late-cut
low-color timothy hay. Of six calves born of these cows, two were dead,
one was unable to stand and died shortly after birth, and three were
both weak and blind. The fact that cows so fed were unable to properly
nourish their calves before birth led to the question whether the milk
from these cows might not be deficient for normal growth of calves from
other cows fed on rations adequate in vitamin A. This preliminary
report included results on three normal calves fed milk from those cows
fed low-color timothy hay. The three calves died at fifty-seven,
sixty-two, and seventy-one days of age, respectively.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Since growth, prenatal and postnatal, is related directly to the
pituitary body, we are specially interested in the knowledge available
on the functioning of this gland.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    The work of Barrie</font> <font size=
"-2">(8)</font> <font size="-1">throws important light on this subject.
He has reported as follows:</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Partial deficiency of vitamin E as shown in the
female rat fed on a diet containing only a trace of vitamin E but which
is otherwise complete, results in the prolongation of gestation, which
may be continued as long as 10 days beyond the normal period. The
offspring under these conditions are abnormal. These young may develop
slowly and be thin and undersized in spite of sufficiently profuse
lactation, or they may become extremely fat and develop a leg weakness
and carpopedal spasm about 18 days after birth. Animals of both types
have thin skulls and short silky fur. Complete E deficiency in the
adult also produces the soft fur and imperfectly calcified skull.
Partially E deficient animals occasionally give birth to a litter but
fail to lactate.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    The changes observed are similar in several ways
to those produced by hypophysectomy (surgical removal of pituitary
gland). Marked degranulation of the anterior pituitary is found in both
the abnormal young and the adult sterile animals. Lack of vitamin E
therefore produces a virtual nutritional hypophysectomy in the young
rat.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    The inability of various species to complete gestation when
vitamin E is not provided in adequate quantity has been reported by
many investigators. A. L. Bacharach, E. Allehorne and H. E. Glynn have
used their study of this factor as a means of estimating the quantity
of vitamin E in the diet. <font size="-2">(9)</font> They state:</p>

<p>    A diet suitable for work on vitamin E causes female rats, fed on
this diet from weaning, to show a gestation-resorption rate not
significantly differing from 100 per cent; when the diet is
supplemented with adequate amounts of vitamin E, also administered from
weaning, the live litter rate does not differ significantly from 100
per cent. It is found that, on such a diet, the percentage of
implantations (conceptions) is markedly different between animals that
have been submitted to a single gestation-resorption, owing to lack of
vitamin E, and animals that are mated for the first time. The authors
suggest that the process of undergoing gestation-resorption brings
about some deep-seated changes in the reproductive mechanism of the
rat, of a kind not hitherto recognized as characterising the vitamin E
deficiency syndrome.</p>

<p>    One of the outstanding changes which I have found takes place in
the primitive races at their point of contact with our modern
civilization is a decrease in the ease and efficiency of the birth
process. When I visited the Six Nation Reservation at Brantford,
Ontario, I was told by the physician in charge that a change of this
kind had occurred during the period of his administration, which had
covered twenty-eight years and that the hospital was now used largely
to care for young Indian women during abnormal childbirth (Chapter
6).</p>

<p>    A similar impressive comment was made to me by Dr. Romig, the
superintendent of the government hospital for Eskimos and Indians at
Anchorage, Alaska. He stated that in his thirty-six years among the
Eskimos, he had never been able to arrive in time to see a normal birth
by a primitive Eskimo woman. But conditions have changed materially
with the new generation of Eskimo girls, born after their parents began
to use foods of modern civilization. Many of them are carried to his
hospital after they had been in labour for several days. One Eskimo
woman who had married twice, her last husband being a white man,
reported to Dr. Romig and myself that she had given birth to twentysix
children and that several of them had been born during the night and
that she had not bothered to waken her husband, but had introduced him
to the new baby in the morning.</p>

<p>    Sherman, <font size="-2">(10)</font> who has made many important
contributions to our knowledge of vitamin A, has shown in a recent
communication that an amount of vitamin A sufficient to support normal
growth and maintain every appearance of good health in animals, may
still be insufficient to meet the added nutritive demands of successful
reproduction and lactation. With the failure to reproduce successfully,
there usually appears in early adult life an increased susceptibility
to infection, and particularly a tendency to lung disease at an age
corresponding to that at which pulmonary tuberculosis so often develops
in young men and women. He states, further, that vitamin A must be
supplied in liberal proportions not only during the growth period but
during the adult period as well, if a good condition of nutrition and a
high degree of health and vigor are to be maintained.</p>

<p>    Hughes, Aubel and Lienhardt <font size="-2">(11)</font> have
shown that a lack of vitamin A in the diets of pigs has resulted in
extreme incoordination and spasms. They also emphasize that gilts bred
prior to the onset of the nervous symptoms either aborted or farrowed
dead pigs.</p>

<p>    Hart and Gilbert <font size="-2">(12)</font> have shown that the
symptoms most commonly seen in cattle having a vitamin A deficiency are
the birth of dead or weak calves, with or without eye lesions. They
report also a condition of newborn calves which simulates white scours,
and the development of eye lesions in immature animals.</p>

<p>    Hughes <font size="-2">(13</font> has shown that swine did not
reproduce when fed barley and salt, but did so when cod liver oil was
added to this food.</p>

<p>    Sure <font size="-2">(14)</font> has shown that a lack of
vitamin A produces in females a disturbance in oestrus and ovulation,
resulting in sterility. Further, he states, that resorption of the
fetus may be produced by lack of vitamin A, even on a diet containing
an abundance of vitamin E, which is known as the anti-sterility
vitamin.</p>

<p>    One of the most important contributions in this field has been
made by Professor Fred Hale, of the Texas Agricultural Experiment
Station, at College Station, Texas. He has shown that many physical
deformities are readily produced by curtailing the amount of vitamin A
in the ration of pigs. He produced fifty-nine pigs <font size=
"-2">(15)</font> that were born blind, every pig in each of six
litters-where the mothers were deprived of vitamin A for several months
before mating and for thirty days thereafter. In pigs, the eyeballs are
formed in the first thirty days. He found, as have several others, that
depriving pigs of vitamin A for a sufficient period produced severe
nerve involvements including paralysis and spasms, so that the animals
could not rise to their feet. He reported that one of these vitamin A
deficient pigs that had previously farrowed a litter of ten pigs, all
born without eyeballs, was given a single dose of cod liver oil two
weeks before mating. She farrowed fourteen pigs which showed various
combinations of eye defects, some had no eyes, some had one eye, and
some had one large eye and one small eye, but all were blind.</p>

<p>    In Fig. 117 I am able through Professor Hale's kindness, to show
an eyeless pig and a normal eye of a pig (at the left) and (at the
right) a pair of incomplete eyes from a pig born in the litter just
mentioned. This one dose of vitamin A made possible the partial
formation of optic nerves and eyeballs. A typical eyeless pig is shown
in Fig. 118 (lower). Note its deformed ears. Among the many physical
injuries which develop in the pigs born to sows fed on a diet deficient
in vitamin A are serious defects of the snout, dental arches, eyes and
feet. This pig was born without eyeballs. It also had club feet and two
tumors. In Fig. 118 (upper right) is shown a pig with cleft palate, and
in Fig. 119 (upper right) one with double hairlip. In Fig. 118 (upper
left) is shown a boy with cleft palate and defective eyes. One of the
very important results of Professor Hale's investigations has been the
production of pigs with normal eyes, born to parents both of whom had
no eyeballs due to lack of vitamin A in their mother's diet. The
problem clearly was not heredity. Two litters, one containing nine pigs
and the other eight, which were born to mothers that had been deprived
of vitamin A before mating and for thirty days thereafter, produced the
following lesions: All had complete absence of eyeballs; some lacked
development of the opening of the external ear; others had cleft
palate, harelip, displaced kidneys, displaced ovaries, or displaced
testes.</p>

<p>    It is of interest that in October, 1935, Professor Hale reports
that the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station was informed that a
litter of fourteen pigs had been born blind in June, 1935, on a farm at
Ralls, Texas. Of these, six pigs were raised and brought to the Station
for further study. The farmer owning the pigs stated that no green feed
was available on his farm from March, 1934, until May, 1935. It will be
noted that this condition paralleled the experimental conditions at the
station under which by restricting vitamin A before and immediately
after gestation fifty-nine pigs were produced without eyeballs.</p>

<p>    Professor Hale reports that in April, 1935, a litter of seven
pigs were born blind at McGlean, Texas, which was suffering from
drought conditions, similar to those at Ralls. The litter and dam were
purchased by the Experimental Station. Matings were made between blind
pigs. These were fed rations containing ample vitamin A, and normal
pigs with normal eyeballs were produced. Even the mating of a blind son
with his mother who had produced him when on deficient diet, produced
only normal pigs when both had ample vitamin A. He states, "If an
hereditary factor had been the cause of this congenital blindness,
these matings would have produced some blind pigs, even if vitamin A
were present in the ration." The problem of congenital cleft palate has
been very embarrassing to those parents whose children have been so
afflicted. It is of interest that breeders of fancy dogs are frequently
embarrassed by having this problem develop in their kennels or among
litters born to parent stock obtained from their kennels.</p>

<p>    In Fig. 119 (upper left) I have shown a water spaniel pup with
cleft palate. This pup was not able to nurse because of the
impossibility of producing suction without a palate. When fed
artificially the milk was expelled through the nostrils. The mother had
given birth to two previous litters all of which were dead at birth or
died soon after. Her diet had been reinforced with mineral calcium
phosphate in tablet form hoping to insure normal offspring. This is not
nature's method.</p>

<p>    I am informed by a veterinary that he has experienced trouble
with harelip, cleft palate or serious facial deformities among dogs
that are pets in homes where they are lavishly coddled and fed the
things they like best. He stated that he has more trouble with head
defects in bulldog pups than any other breed.</p>

<p>    There are few if any problems connected with modern degeneration
on which so much light is thrown as that supplied by recent
investigations on the problems of paternal responsibility for defects
in the offspring. There are several reasons for this. Because the
mother has the sole responsibility for the nourishment of the fetus
during the formative period and she alone provides the handicaps
incident to the process of birth, it is very natural that defects are
practically all interpreted as being associated with these processes.
This unfortunately, has been embarrassed further by the fact that since
distortions in behavior do not appear until sometime after birth,
normality was largely assumed to be present up to the time of their
appearance, and therefore of necessity would be contributions from the
child's environment. As such they would be subject naturally to
treatment by applying influences to change the mental environment.
Hence the entire problem of the role of the sex cells through
controlling the architecture of the body including the brain has been
largely overlooked. Very important light is thrown on this problem in
the data provided on the pup shown in Fig. 120. This shows a dachshund
pup with cleft palate and a very severe spinal deformity. This is not
unlike deformities frequently seen, or unlike that of the pup shown in
Fig. 119. The highly significant circumstance is the fact that these
same deformities not only appeared also in another pup of this same
litter but in one pup in each of three other litters about the same
time. While four mothers were involved these four litters were all
sired by one father. The paternal responsibility is clearly
established.</p>

<p>    At the right in Fig. 119 a lamb is shown with club feet and two
lambs without eyeballs. I am told that in some of the sheep raising
states quite a number of deformities occur in lambs at birth. One
writer states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    These deformities may maintain themselves in any
number of ways. We have them two-headed, 5 and 6 legs, 2 tails, born
without eyes, hermaphrodites, born with ribs on one side and any number
of such deformities. A common deformity in sheep is under-shot and
over-shot jaws. This simply means that the upper jaw extends farther to
the front that the under jaw and the front teeth do not meet. This is
called over-shot and the reverse is called under-shot.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    It will be noted that a common deformity in sheep relates to an
under-development of either the upper or lower jaw which is one of the
most common expressions of disturbed development in humans.</p>

<p>    Some illustrations of the deformities that may occur in domestic
animals are shown in Fig. 121. Above are seen two cows each with an
extra foreleg attached to the shoulder; below, to the left is shown a
double-faced calf which also had a cleft palate; to the right a cat
with deformed legs.</p>

<p>    In corresponding with Professor Hale, I inquired whether they
had information as to the effect of vitamin A deficiency on the sire.
He replied, "If we reduceed the vitamin A content of the body of the
sire, he would become sterile and, therefore, we could not try this
procedure." The question arises as to what the effect would be of a
less severe depletion of vitamin A of both parents.</p>

<p>    It is a very easy matter to place the full responsibility on the
mother, when defects develop in the children. These data indicate that
either parent may contribute directly to certain of the defects of the
children, due to defects in the germ plasm.</p>

<p>    A practical case from my field studies includes a full-blooded
Eskimo woman who was married twice, the second time to a white man, by
whom she had several children. She had insisted on selecting and
preparing the native foods for herself, though she prepared the white
man's imported foods for him. With a total of twenty-six pregnancies
she did not have any tooth decay. He had rampant tooth decay, and a
marked abnormality in the development of face and of the dental arches.
Several of the children had incomplete development of the face and of
the dental arches. One of the girls who was married had very narrow
dental arches and nostrils and a typical boyish type of body build.
Unlike her mother, this girl had a very severe experience in the birth
of her only child and insisted that she would not take the risk of
having another. Several daughters have narrow arches. The question
arises whether the deficient nutrition of the father may have been the
contributing factor in the injury of their children.</p>

<p>    New light is being thrown on human problems by animal
investigations. One study that is particularly instructive has been
conducted by McKenzie and Berliner of the University of Missouri.
(Bulletin No. 265.) The experimental animals used were sheep. Their
studies indicated to them that they could predict the level of
fertility of the sire by studies made on the seminal fluid. They found
that the percentage of abnormal spermatozoa increased to 84 per cent
under unfavorable conditions and reduced to less than 15 per cent under
favorable conditions. When the unfavorable conditions characterized by
these abnormal spermatozoa prevailed the females did not conceive. High
temperature proved to be an important controlling factor as indicated
by variation in percentage of abnormal sperm. In one breed the average
variation was from 2.5 per cent in January to 22 per cent defective in
August; in another breed from 18 per cent in January to 73 per cent
defective in August. They also found that the same result could be
produced in the winter by keeping the sires in heated rooms or by
applying heat externally. They further found that when the percentage
of abnormal sperm was high a condition of sterility was apparently
established. In a personal communication from Professor McKenzie he
states that their inference is that with a high percentage of abnormal
sperm the ova either are not fertilized or that fertilization takes
place and that prenatal death occurs in a certain number of the cases,
and that there is an appreciable prenatal death loss in sheep, horses,
cattle, and swine. I have referred to the data presented by Mall
indicating that 15 per cent of human conceptions in England are
expelled as deformities in the second and third month of gestation.
McKenzie also presents data relating to swine in which a sire that
showed a high percentage of abnormal sperm was bred to two groups of
sows of similar breed. One was maintained in a barn without access to
pasture, the other received similar rations plus access to pasture. The
group without pasture produced a high percentage of mummies, small
litters, and abnormal pigs (open abdominal walls with viscera
protruding and exposed spine in the region of the lumbar vertebrae).
The second group on the same food with the addition of pasturage
produced normally large-size litters without mummies. The following
year this experiment was repeated reversing the groups of sows and
using a similar high percentage of defective sperm in the same sire.
The same results occurred, with the group maintained without access to
pasture. This emphasizes the need for the vitamins and minerals that
are provided in natural foods, particularly vitamin A and seems to
relate to the studies of Hale in which the absence of vitamin A
produced gross defects. These studies on domestic animals strongly
emphasize the necessity that both parents shall have adequate nutrition
before conception occurs and subsequently for the mother.</p>

<p>    Until very recently there has been exceedingly little literature
dealing with the factors contributing to the abnormal development of
fetuses in either domestic animals or humans. Williams, who is one of
the few students of this problem as it relates to domestic animals, in
referring to this phase has commented that there is no treatise in the
English language on teratology (development of monsters) in domestic
animals. <font size="-2">(16)</font> He emphasizes that these defects
are growing in numbers and economic importance. He refers to Burki's
studies in Switzerland indicating that this difficulty has constantly
and enormously increased in his territory. This veterinary has asked
"Are our cows degenerating?" It is of interest that a type of deformity
commonly recognized among veterinaries as a distortion of the head
presenting a lack of development of the bones of the middle part of the
face including the upper jaw is commonly called "bull-dog calf." This
is particularly important in connection with the frequent human
deficiency of lack of development in the middle third of the face.
Williams emphasizes the common knowledge that Boston bull-dogs are not
prolific and because of the difficulty of giving birth to their young,
some veterinarians resort routinely to caesarian section. Fortunately,
seriously deformed specimens are seldom born alive and usually do not
continue to term. Williams states that Loje has observed ten grossly
deformed calves of a particular type that were traced to the same sire;
also a series of five with this deformity reported by Hutt were traced
to one sire. Among the deformities in domestic animals cleft palate or
absence of palate is very common. These studies on domestic animals
strongly emphasize two facts; first, that deformities among these
animals are very similar to those that develop in humans, and second,
that the defects are largely related to the original germ cells and
that the male may provide the defect quite as well as the female.
Several of the primitive races have understood and provided against
these mishaps.</p>

<p>    Moench and Holt of the Cornell Medical School and New York
Hospital <font size="-2">(17)</font> have made important studies on
humans and have found a very high incidence of sterility when abnormal
forms of spermatozoa reached 25 per cent. Among the abnormal forms they
found one particular family with a particular type of abnormal sperm
reaching 12 per cent. Their breeding record was decidedly bad and fetal
malformations repeatedly occurred. In their group, in 63 sterile
matings the men were normal 21 times and abnormal 37 times. They listed
over 40 different abnormal or deformed types of sperm. They
conclude:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><font size="-1">In a normal semen the abnormal sperm heads do not
exceed 19 to 20 per cent.</font></li>

<li><font size="-1">When the sperm head abnormalities reach 20 to 23
per cent, impaired fertility can be assumed.</font></li>

<li><font size="-1">When the sperm head abnormalities are above 25 per
cent, clinical sterility is usually present.</font></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>    An important contribution to the question of the relation of the
germ cells of the father to the type of defects that are prevalent in
his family history has been made in recent studies conducted in
Germany. <font size="-2">(18)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   Two German surgeons concerned with enforcing the
sterilization law in Berlin have taken advantage of their opportunities
to make an important contribution to the study of fecundity.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Several studies have been published previously,
of the spermatozoa of normal men. This book offers a study of the
spermatozoa of men who had been diagnosed as hereditarily defective. At
the time of the operation, the upper part of the vas deferens was
washed out, and the sperm thus obtained were studied in great detail,
20 different types of abnormality being distinguished.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    In their control studied, the normal man is
found to produce 19 per cent of morphologically defective sperm. By
contrast, the chronic alcoholic patient produces 75 per cent of
defective sperm.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Previously it has been assumed that as much as
25 per cent or 30 per cent of abnormal sperm were a good evidence of
lowered fertility if not of sterility. But the fertility of these
chronic alcoholics was not diminished, the authors claim.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    In cases of inherited mental defect, 62 per cent
of abnormal sperm were produced, accompanied by low fecundity,--as is
the case generally with the mentally defective male. On the other hand,
in hereditary deafness, 62 per cent and in hereditary blindness 75 per
cent of defective sperm appeared.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    Epilepsy and schizophrenia (dementia praecox)
both supposed to be constitutional in origin, show less abnormality of
spermatozoa (58 per cent and 54 per cent respectively) than blindness
and deafness.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    The fact that in the past almost the entire emphasis of change
in physical, mental and moral qualities has been assigned to the forces
of heredity, strongly emphasizes the lack of information regarding the
nature of the forces at work and the points at which their influence
constitute the determining factors. The data previously presented in
this chapter dealing with the role of vitamins A and E throw valuable
new light on this phase. It is important, however, that new data are
available dealing with the factors which injure the germ cells and
which Tredgold has spoken of as "poisoned germ cells."</p>

<p>   In a personal communication received from Professor T. S. Sutton
of the College of Agriculture, Ohio State University, he makes the
following observation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    For several years we have been interested in the
study of the effects of vitamin A deficiency. Right now our main
consideration is the effect of this deficiency on reproduction. We find
that a diet low in vitamin A will cause reproductive failure, which
seems to be caused chiefly by a degeneration of the germinal epithelium
of the gonad. This is particularly true in the case of the male. I
think we have rather convincing evidence that this is a direct dietary
damage to the gonad (ovary or testis), rather than a disruption of the
endocrine balance which might result in sterility as appears to be the
case in vitamin B deficiency.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The degenerative processes which occur in nerve tissues due to
vitamin A deficiency have been studied by Professor Sutton and his
associates. <font size="-2">(19)</font> They have been able to show
detailed progressive degeneration within nerve fibers as a result of
vitamin A deficiency.</p>

<p>    In the light of the newer information it is quite clear why we
may have anyone of the following distinct expressions in the
reproductive process, namely, physical excellence of succeeding
generations (such as obtains among many of the primitive races as I
have shown); complete reproductive failure or sterility or partial
failure resulting in defectives of various types at the borderline
between these two phases. It is the rapid and progressive increase in
this last group which constitutes the progressive degeneration of our
modern civilization.</p>

<p>    One of the main problems in this study has to do with the
relation of nutrition to the modification of the growth of the child,
both in its formative period and in the stage of adolescence. I have
shown that in many of these primitive racial stocks there occurs in the
first generation after the displacement of native foods by imported
foods a marked change in facial and dental arch forms. These changes
happen most frequently in the later children in the families and come
about notwithstanding the impact of heredity through all the previous
generations of excellent physical development. Clinically, the evidence
is abundant, that this change occurs in these primitive racial stocks
regardless of color, geographic location, temperature, and climate. We
are apparently dealing here with a factor which, while it may be
related to the germ plasm and to the prenatal growth period, clearly
involves other forces than those that are at work in the case of
hereditary defectives. Since these changes have to do directly with
disturbances in growth of the head, particularly of the face and of the
dental arches, we are concerned with such evidence as may be available
as to the nature of the forces that readily affect the anatomy of the
skull.</p>

<p>    The general architecture of the body is apparently determined
primarily by the health of the two germ cells at the time of their
union. This architectural design may not be completely fulfilled due to
interference with nutritive processes both before and after birth. In
this large problem of the relationship between physical design of the
body and resistance or susceptibility to disease, we may have
determining factors operating at different periods in prenatal and
postnatal growth. The accumulating evidence strongly emphasizes that
disease susceptibility is a widely variable factor and associated with
certain types of developmental disturbances.</p>

<p>    In a discussion of tuberculosis susceptibility before a meeting
of specialists in that field, emphasis was placed upon the fact that
other factors than the bacteria played controlling roles in the matter
of susceptibility to tuberculosis.</p>

<p>    Weisman has recently made an important contribution to the
problem of physical development and susceptibility to tuberculosis. He
has presented <font size="-2">(20)</font> statistical data indicating
the type of chest deformity which predisposes an individual to
tuberculosis. He states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    In a study previously made on the shape of the
normal and of the tuberculosis chest, it was found that the average
normal chest was flat and wide and that the average tuberculous chest
was deep and narrow. It was also shown that the deep chest was an
underdeveloped, primitive type of chest, resembling an infant's chest
in shape. Later studies on the shape of the chest and on environment
showed that children from the poorer socio-economic environments had on
the average a deeper chest, weighed less and were shorter than the
children from the higher socio-economic levels. An investigation
recently made on the incidence of tuberculosis in the various school
districts in Minneapolis revealed that there is a very high incidence
of tuberculosis among the children from the slums where the deep chest
prevails. Ten times as many cases of tuberculosis were reported from a
school district which is perhaps the poorest in the city as were
reported from the best school districts.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">    This study, which shows that there is a definite
correlation between the deep chest and the positive reaction to
tuberculin adds one more link to the chain of evidence supporting the
contention that the deep chest is more or less associated with
tuberculosis. It also helps to explain why there is such a high
incidence of tuberculosis among the poor in the slum districts. The
children in the slums are physically underdeveloped. They are not only
shorter and lighter but they have on the average a deep, primitive,
infantile type of chest, one that has not gone through the normal
process of development. Even the new-born and infants are shorter and
lighter and have a deeper chest than the average infant from a better
environment.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    It is important to note that Dr. Weisman associated the type of
chest which predisposes the individual to tuberculosis, with a prenatal
condition since he states "even the new-born and infants are shorter
and lighter and have a deeper chest than an average infant from a
better environment." This work throws important light on why in the
primitive groups the children born to parents who are living on the
imported nutrition lower in vitamins and minerals than the native
foods, not only showed a greatly increased incidence of tuberculosis
over the children born to parents on the native diet but also proved to
be those individuals who, in facial and dental arch form, presented
positive evidence of prenatal injury. We also have a direct explanation
for the observations that have been emphasized by Dr. George Draper,
that physical form has a direct relationship to disease susceptibility
of certain types, frequently spoken of as diatheses.</p>

<p>    It is important in this connection to call to mind the statement
made by some clinicians that tuberculosis patients with narrow nostrils
tend to make a poor fight. These narrow nostrils are clearly related to
prenatal injury resulting primarily from defective germ cells which
determine the architecture, not heredity but intercepted heredity.</p>

<p>    It is very easy to understand the effects of gross physical
lesions such as the absence of eyeballs, harelip and cleft palate.
These defects can readily be seen. The problem is very different,
however, when we are dealing with disturbances of function due to
minute anatomical lesions in either external or internal organs such as
the brain. These latter will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>

DETERIORATION</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">A</font>FTER one has lived among the primitive
racial stocks in different parts of the world and studied them in their
isolation, few impressions can be more vivid than that of the absence
of prisons and asylums. Few, if any, of the problems which confront
modern civilization are more serious and disturbing than the
progressive increase in the percentage of individuals with unsocial
traits and a lack of irresponsibility.</p>

<p>    Laird <font size="-2">(1)</font> has emphasized some phases of
this in an article entitled, <i>The Tail That Wags the Nation,</i> in
which he states: "The country's average level of general ability sinks
lower with each generation. Should the ballot be restricted to citizens
able to take care of themselves? One out of four cannot." He has
illustrated the seriousness of this degeneration by presenting details
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Although we might cite any one of nearly two
dozen states, we will first mention Vermont by name because that is the
place studied by the late Dr. Pearce Bailey. "It would be," he wrote,
"safe to assume that there are at least 30 defectives per 1000 in
Vermont of the eight-year-old mentality type, and 300 per 1000 of
backward or retarded persons, persons of distinctly inferior
intelligence. In other words, nearly one-third of the whole population
of that state is of a type to require some supervision.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    From a broad view of the problem of modern degeneration it will
be helpful to note the observations by Tredgold <font size=
"-2">(2)</font> in mental deficiency. He states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    It is thus evident that the condition of mental
deficiency, whilst presenting many interesting problems to the
physician, the pathologist, and the psychologist, has also a much wider
interest and importance. Since in Man the predominate feature is Mind,
and since it is by its development and evolution that human progress
has taken, and must take place, it is clear that the question of its
disease, and particularly of its defect, is one of supreme importance
to the statesman, the sociologist, the philosopher, and the whole
community.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    In connection with these investigations among primitive races it
is interesting to note that the data are in complete harmony with the
data which clinical pathologists, clinicians and anatomists have
obtained in their study of the physical and structural characteristics
of individuals who make up the deficiency groups. In discussing the
problem of the significance of the shape of the palate, Tredgold <font
size="-2">(2)</font> states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Palate--The association of abnormalities of the
palate with mental deficiency has long been recognized, and there is no
doubt that it is one of the commonest malformations occurring in this
condition. Many years ago Langdon Down drew attention to the subject,
and more recently Clouston has recorded a large number of observations
which show conclusively that, although deformed palates occur in the
normal, they are far and away more frequent in neuropaths and the
mentally defective. He states that deformed palates are present in 19
per cent of the ordinary population, 33 per cent of the insane, 55 per
cent of criminals, but in no less than 61 per cent of idiots. Petersen,
who has made a most exhaustive study of this question, and has compiled
an elaborate classification of the various anomalies found palatal
deformities present in no less than 82 per cent of aments, (mental
defectives), in 76 per cent of epileptics, and in 80 per cent of the
insane.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Probably every city in the United States has made special
provision for both mentally deficient groups and unsocial individuals,
either in special schools or in special classes. In Cleveland, we have
had a large school devoted to the problems of the so-called
pre-delinquent boys, of whom nearly all have been before the courts and
are assigned to this institution because they are not well enough
adjusted to be kept in their normal school environment. In discussing
the characteristics of these boys with the principal of that school, I
asked him what the probabilities were that many of these boys would
finally become involved in crime. His comment was, in effect, that they
were virtually in the vestibule of a penal institute, when judged by
the experience of previous boys from that school.</p>

<p>    In approaching a study of this group, it is helpful to observe
the experience of the well-equipped institutions organized for the
correction of the abnormal trend which characterizes these boys. In
this connection, there is a helpful report by the United States Dept.
of Labor, Publication No. 203, which gives the result of tracing the
after careers of 621 boys who were in five of the best-known
correctional institutions. It was found that 66 per cent had been
arrested and 58 per cent convicted one or more times after having been
paroled from the institution. It is apparent from data of this type
that probably the forces that produce these abnormal expressions cause
irreparable damage in the brain tissue. Practically all recent crime
reports are recording an increase in juvenile crime. The Children's
Bureau of the Dept. of Labor stated (Nov. 4, 1938): "that juvenile
delinquency spurted during 1937 for the first time since 1930," but it
cannot explain why until further study.</p>

<p>    Reports to the bureau from 28 courts in 17 states and the
District of Columbia showed that they handled 31,038 cases during 1937,
an increase of 3,000 over 1936. The report showed that 44 per cent of
the cases involved children between 14 and 15 years old; 22 per cent
those between 12 and 13 years, and 10 per cent those between 10 and 11.
Boys' cases comprised 8 5 per cent of the total.</p>

<p>    As an approach to this problem I have made an examination of 189
boys in the Cleveland school for pre-delinquents. I gave particular
attention to those physical signs of nutritional injury, which seemed
to be definitely assigned to the formative period of the child. We
endeavored to obtain detailed information relative to the family
history and to the birth of the child. We were fortunate in having the
assistance of the officers, and of a nurse in the dental service of the
Health Department of the Board of Education, a nurse who made visits to
the homes of many of these boys to obtain the information directly from
the mothers.</p>

<p>    In this group of boys, there were twenty-nine for whom I had not
sufficient details to include their cases in the studies. Of the 189 in
the group, there were only three with sufficiently normal dental arches
to be classified as normal. Accordingly, 98.4 per cent proved to be
individuals with more or less marked abnormality. Many of the faces
were very badly deformed.</p>

<p>    While often it will be difficult to place the responsibility
entirely on either parent for the child's abnormal physical
development, it is of interest to study the birth rank of these
children. The average number of children in the families represented by
these 160 children is 4.75. Of these, thirty-five, or 21.9 per cent,
are first children in the families represented; thirteen, or 9.1 per
cent, are only children; thirty-nine, or 24.4 per cent, are last
children; and thirty-six or 22.5 per cent, are fifth children or later.
Sixty-two, or 38.7 per cent, are either the first or last child. It
will be seen from these data that the first or last child, or even a
late child in a large family, tended to have a distinctly poorer chance
than the intermediate children in the families in which these studies
were made. Statistical data relating the age of the mother and father
to prenatal deficiency of their offspring reveal that abnormally young
parents have a much higher percentage of defective children than do
those in the most favorable child-bearing period of life. The group at
the Cleveland school included only those boys who have been before the
courts because of more or less serious phases of delinquency. If they
are in a considerable part the products of a defective society, it
seems quite unfair that they should be held entirely responsible for
that delinquency, which has put them in this institution. If they are
destined for a penal institute in which they will be held entirely
responsible for that abnormality which resulted in their misdemeanor,
as has been the procedure in the past, are they receiving just
consideration? Society may be justified in protecting itself from their
misdeeds by placing restrictions about them, but it does not seem that
society is justified in shifting the entire responsibility to the
affected individuals.</p>

<p>    Recent studies of the mental capacity of felons brought before
the Common Pleas Court in Cleveland have shown that of 3,197 convicted
felons examined in the medical clinic only 42.3 per cent were
classified as normal. Fifty-five and nine-tenths per cent were classed
as defective delinquents and only 1.8 per cent as insane. The outgrowth
of this study has resulted in the drafting by the Cleveland Bar
Association of a new criminal law for Ohio to be presented to the
coming State Legislature. This bill provides for the creation of a new
criminal class composed of what are called defective delinquents. This
includes morons and others of abnormal mentality but not insane who
commit felonies or misdemeanors. The purpose of this legislation is to
afford special treatment for law violators falling within the new
classification, making it possible to segregate delinquents in separate
institutions. The Ohio law like that of most other states now
recognizes only two types of criminals, sane and insane, and if not
insane they must be punished.</p>

<p>    It is proper that we should ask who is to blame for the
abnormalities which render these young men incapable of making the
necessary adaptation to our environment.</p>

<p>    An important characteristic of the boys in the Cleveland school
was their low intelligence. Practically all were recorded as retarded
or mentally backward prior to their transfer to this institution.</p>

<p>    It is important that we note the characteristics of groups that
are similarly retarded, but who have not demonstrated sufficiently
unsocial characters to have to be placed in the pre-delinquent groups.
We shall recognize them as individuals who may never commit unsocial
acts sufficient to get them into trouble, though they will doubtless
continue in the group of mentally backward persons. Such a group is to
be found in the Outwaithe School in Cleveland. The children in this
school, which enrolls about one thousand students, were examined in
order to ascertain whether there might be groups that are similarly
afflicted physically. The school is distinctive because it has a very
high percentage of children who are backward mentally. Many of these
children have been concentrated there in order to bring them under the
influence of special teachers. In an examination of a cross section of
the children, almost all were found to have had distinct injury in the
formative period, as evidenced by the changes in facial form. A
preliminary survey of the backward children of this institution was
made by having typical classes selected by an official of the school
from ages ranging from eleven to seventeen. I examined the arches and
made measurements of the head and face. With the assistance of the
school nurse I obtained records of the other children in the families
selected. This latter survey was supplemented by field work by the
nurse. The intelligence quotients, as reported in the records, were
also provided. In the twenty-nine individuals so studied, seven, or
twenty-five per cent were first children; fourteen, or fifty per cent
last children in the families. Only one individual was found with
approximately normal dental arches, that is, approximately three per
cent of the individuals. Twenty-eight children, or 97 per cent, had
abnormality of one or both dental arches. These children were placed in
this institution because they were backward mentally, although as a
group they are comparable to the group studied in the Thomas A. Edison
School, where the grouping was based on delinquent traits. A cursory
examination was made by observing other pupils in this school in their
classes and on the grounds. A large percentage of severe facial and
dental arch deformities and a very high percentage with definite
disturbances in facial growth were evident. These data are presented as
applying to a group of individuals characterized by a disturbed
mentality, to the extent that they were assigned to special classes for
the mentally retarded. While the group constituting the school
population at Outwaithe represented the relatively large group of
pupils assigned to special classes for backward children and did not
carry the stigmata of delinquency carried by those of the Thomas A.
Edison School, both groups had many physical defects in common.</p>

<p>    We are, accordingly, concerned with the relationship existing
among various stages of mental backwardness, pre-delinquency and
criminality. To throw light on this subject, I visited our State
Penitentiary to observe the characteristics of facial and dental arch
development of the individuals whose unsocial traits had brought them
to this institution. I visited the dental clinic with the director, Dr.
May, and saw the mouths of typical members of that colony as they were
presented for oral examination. I asked the director what, if any,
special features of the oral cavity he had observed to be
characteristic of this group and different from those he had observed
outside the institution in his private practice. He stated that he had
noted continually that there was a tendency for the tongue to be too
large for the mouth. This is a constant characteristic of another group
of mentally injured, namely, the Mongoloid. This institution has a
population of approximately four thousand individuals. A high
percentage of them gave marked evidence of injury in the prenatal
period as expressed in disturbances of facial form and the shape of the
dental arches. In observing over half the population at work or
exercise, I did not see one with a typically normal facial development.
In Fig. 122 will be seen typical examples of this group. These show
front and side views (see Hooton's recent book. <font size=

<p>    Newspaper daily illustrated reports of crimes committed by young
criminals show almost continually these evidences of prenatal injury.

</table>

<p>    It is important to emphasize the fact that the disturbances in
the development of the head, face and brain may have a variety of
expressions. In the more severe form characteristic of the Mongoloid
group, as seen in Fig. 124 the facial injury is typical and is
associated with a mental disturbance which, in turn, has been shown to
be associated with typical brain lesions. The individuals of that
group, however, do not tend to be criminals. Indeed, their injury is
too severe. As a group they are apt to be docile, tractable and happy.
Indeed, in the mentally backward and criminal groups in their various
stages, we find facial patterns typical of large numbers of individuals
we see on the streets, who are in school or in business, and entirely
capable of maintaining a respected and honorable position in society.
Accordingly, it is not justified, and indeed would be entirely unfair,
to associate their disturbed facial and dental arch development with
traits that would be normally found in the grossly unsocial groups. We
cannot by viewing the face evaluate the kind or extent of brain injury
that is associated with prenatal malnutrition of that individual.
Indeed, these various divergent facial patterns are accepted by our
modern civilization as representative of the many varieties or patterns
constituting a normal population. It is not until we see primitive
groups living under a controlled natural environment that we see
Nature's model and design of the human physiognomy.</p>

<caption align="BOTTOM"><font size="-1">FIG. 124. This is a typical
mongoloid defective. Note the marked lack of development of the middle

speech and behavior defects. These are now associated with definite
defects in the brain. Nearly all are either a first or last child. A
large percentage are born to mothers over forty years of
age.</font></caption>

<p>    We are concerned to know the percentage in any typical colony of
our modern civilization that may be placed in the various
classifications of normal, mildly backward mentally, severely backward
mentally, unsocial, delinquent, criminal, idiots, epileptic and insane.
Tredgold <font size="-2">(2)</font> reports two surveys in England and
Wales which give figures on the proportion of the population that could
be identified with definite lesions. It would be fortunate if a survey
could be made in the United States that would indicate the extent of
the increase in delinquents of various types, including racketeers and
criminals. It would be very helpful if these data could be related to
the degrees of prenatal injury. There are many phases of modern
degeneration which lend themselves to study from the standpoint of the
probable role of progressive decline in the efficiency of nutrition to
the progressive increase in morbidity, mortality, mental deficiency and
delinquency. This is discussed in the next chapter on Soil Depletion,
Plant and Animal Deterioration.</p>

<p>    From the point of view of this problem the differences between
the modern white civilizations and many of the primitive groups is
interesting. Criminal tendencies in isolated primitives are so slight
that no prisons are required. I have referred to the Loetschental
Valley in Switzerland, which, until recently, has been physically
isolated from the process of modernization. For the two thousand
inhabitants in that valley, there is no prison. In Uganda, Africa, the
Ruanda tribes estimated to number two and a half millions, had no
prisons.</p>

<p>    Observation of Nature's normal facial patterns in the primitive
racial stocks, establishes types within the limits of normality. The
readers of this text by observing the individuals in any given families
may see in how large a percentage of white families the progressive
narrowing and lengthening of the face in the younger members of the
family as compared with the older occurs. Further observations will
enable one to recognize rapidly, even without experience and special
training in anatomy, these evidences of prenatal injury.</p>

<p>    I made a survey in the New England States, Quebec and Eastern
Ontario, because the United States death rate from heart disease as
reported by the American Heart Association was shown to be highest in
Vermont and New Hampshire, followed closely by Massachusetts and New
York. I first visited the New York State Hospital for tuberculosis
patients at Raybrook, near Saranac. With the assistance of a member of
the staff, I examined fifty young men and women in the wards. In that
group, only three were found with normal facial and dental arch
development. These three individuals were marble cutters who were
suffering from silicosis. The forty-seven other individuals examined
(94 per cent) were found to have marked evidence of injury in the
developmental period. At the state fair at Rutland, Vermont, to which
residents came from various communities throughout the state, I was
able to count, by observing and recording the individuals who passed,
that in each 100 people, three out of four gave evidence of injury in
the developmental period. Similar studies were made at the State Farm
for delinquent boys and girls, almost all of whom had been before the
courts. 1 found that a very high percentage, approximating 100 per cent
of those observed, had received injuries in the prenatal period. I then
went to Quebec and studied groups of school children in the early
teens. I observed groups in which a very high percentage gave marked
evidence of prenatal injury. This seemed aggravated in districts where
the farms had been abandoned, because the land was not producing as
well as in the past. I studied Indians in two Indian Reservations,
also, and there again found marked evidence of injury typical of our
modernized communities. Similarly, a limestone district in Ontario was
visited and critical observations were made of the facial form of the
new generation, in regions in which the fertility of the soil had been
definitely depleted through exhaustion. These again showed evidence of
prenatal injury through faulty nutrition. The prisoners in a jail were
examined, and all of them except two habitual drunkards showed marked
evidence of prenatal injury.</p>

<p>    If space permitted, it would be interesting to include here a
discussion and illustrations of the physical characteristics of the
racketeers and criminals whose pictures are shown in our newspapers
almost daily. It is rare that a normal face is depicted in this
group.</p>

<p>    As an approach to more detailed study of the available
information regarding the processes that are involved in the production
of facial deformities, it will be helpful to think of the face as
constituting the floor of the anterior part of the brain. The pituitary
body is situated on the underside of the brain just back of the eyes.
It is the governing body for the activity of growth, and largely
controls the functioning of several of the other glands of internal
secretion. It is, as it were, the master of the ship. We are,
accordingly, primarily concerned with the role that it plays, and the
forces which control its own development and function. Its dependence
upon vitamin E has been demonstrated by many workers. For example, Dr.
M. M. O. Barrie <font size="-2">(3)</font> has reported that an
inadequate amount of vitamin E produces marked disturbance in the
growth of the offspring of rats. He states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    The changes observed are similar in several ways
to those produced by hypophysectomy (removal of pituitary gland).
Marked degranulation of the anterior pituitary is found in both the
abnormal young and the adult sterile animals. Lack of vitamin E
therefore produces a virtual nutritional hypophysectomy in the young
rat.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    The work recently done in this field by Dr. Hector Mortimer and
his associates in McGill University, Montreal, has included studies of
skull development of rats. He has shown that the surgical removal of
the pituitary body at the base of the brain in very young rats produces
regularly a certain type of defect in skull development. This has been
characterized by a lack of development forward of the muzzle or face,
with a narrowing of the nose and dental arches. He found that by the
addition of extracts made from the pituitary glands, which he had
removed surgically, he entirely prevented the development of these
defects, thereby establishing the relation of the injury to
deficiencies of the hormones developed by that organ. Another approach
to the problem on which he has expended much fruitful effort, has been
in connection with the study of the skulls of individuals who are known
to have disturbances in the functioning of the pituitary gland through
the interference caused by tumors. Common illustrations are the cases
of acromegaly or giantism. By associating these physical changes in
bodily form with each x-ray, data obtained from skiagraphs, together
with the history and the nature of the tumor, considerable information
has been developed. Another important series of studies has included
the correlation, by means of the x-rays, of the skulls of individuals
suffering from certain types of physical and mental disturbances, with
certain abnormalities in the skull as shown by the x-rays. By these
various means Dr. Mortimer has been able to divide the various types of
skull defects and developmental and growth defects into distinct
classifications. With this yardstick he is able to classify individuals
from their Roentgenograms. It is of interest that in his work, in
association with Dr. G. Levine, Dr. A. W. Rowe and others at the Evans
Memorial for Clinical Research and Neuro-Endocrine Research in Boston,
important relationships have been established through the examination
of over three thousand case histories. X-ray records of the skull are
included in the studies. They report that independent and previous
physiological investigations gave evidence at the time of the
examination of disturbed pituitary function. Dr. Mortimer's excellent
investigations seem to indicate clearly that facial and dental arch
form are directly related to and controlled by the functioning of the
pituitary body in the base of the brain. Dr. Barrie <font size=
"-2">(3)</font> reports that partial deficiency of vitamin E, as shown
in the case of the female rat, results in the prolongation of gestation
which may be continued as long as ten days beyond the normal period.
The offspring under these conditions are abnormal. Further, animals
deficient in vitamin E, occasionally give birth to a litter, but fail
to lactate.</p>

<p>    When we realize that one of the best sources of vitamin E is
wheat germ, most of which is removed from white flour, usually along
with four-fifths of the mineral, we see one cause of the tragedy that
is overwhelming so many individuals in our modern civilization. In many
individuals it may be wise to reinforce our modern white bread and
starchy dietary with wheat germ, which can be obtained in package form
from the manufacturers of flour. As this is put up in cans, all air is
displaced with an inert gas when the cans are sealed. While in this way
oxidation of the embryo which is very fragile, is prevented, as soon as
the seal is broken, oxidation sets in and progresses rapidly, producing
a product that is not comparable to the wheat embryo of freshly cracked
whole wheat. My investigations indicate that Nature has put just the
right amount of embryo in each grain of wheat to accompany that
quantity of food. If the whole wheat is prepared and eaten promptly
after grinding and exposing the embryo to oxidation, the effect desired
by Nature is adequately provided.</p>

<p>    It is important to emphasize in connection with the development
of the deformities of the face that other skeletal deficiencies or
abnormalities result from the same disturbing factors. One of these is
the narrowing of the entire body, with a tendency to increase in
height. This is shown in many of the family groups of modernized
primitives. The effect of this narrowing of the body, which in girls
results in the boyish type of figure due to the narrowing of the hips,
introduces an entirely new and serious problem in the experience of our
modern civilization when confronted with the problems of
childbirth.</p>

<p>    Among primitive races living in a primitive state childbirth was
a very simple and rapid process, accompanied by little fear or
apprehension; whereas, in the modernized descendants, even in the first
and second generations of those individuals born to parents after they
had adopted the foods of modern white civilizations, serious trouble
was often experienced.</p>

<p>    We have been considering the changes which take place in the
skeletal growth as a result of the disturbances in the functioning of
the pituitary body of the individual after birth, or of the mother
during the prenatal period. We are also concerned with changes in the
soft tissues, particularly the brain. I have presented data indicating
that a very large percentage of mentally backward children have
disturbances in facial development. The available data also indicate
that a large percentage of those who are seriously injured in facial
form have some disturbance in their mental or moral character. Whether
there is relationship between the processes which develop these
physical abnormalities in brain growth and mental efficiency, including
emotional states and character traits is now to be considered.</p>

<p>    An important contribution has been made to this phase of the
problem by Dr. James Papez, Professor of Anatomy at Cornell University,
<font size="-2">(4)</font> who concludes his report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Is emotion a magic product, or is it a
physiologic process which depends on an anatomic mechanism? . . . The
evidence presented is . . . suggestive of such a mechanism as a unit
within the larger architectural mosaic of the brain.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Research data have been presented which deal with the anatomical
defects of the brain of individuals suffering from the typical mental
and physical patterns of the so-called Mongolian idiot. In these cases
the gyrus cinguli of the brain were found to be absent, which indicates
the impossibility that these individuals function normally either
physically or mentally.</p>

<p>    Modern civilization has provided a large group of the defectives
known as Mongolian idiots. They have very definite characteristics both
physical and mental. Among the former, one of the most universal
expressions is a vacant stare associated with a face that is markedly
underdeveloped in the middle third, usually accompanied by narrow
nostrils and a narrow upper dental arch.</p>

<p>    One of the outstanding characteristics of the group is their
inability to develop mentally beyond three to eight years of age.
Because of the difficulty of building a character and intelligence
level beyond infancy, these unfortunates are housed largely in state
institutions for feebleminded. Since the physical picture is similar to
that which occurs in a much less severe form in a large number of
individuals in our modern civilization, it is important that we study
this group in the light of the information that is available with
regard to their physical, mental and moral characteristics, and in the
light of such information as is available regarding their origin.</p>

<p>    The surveys that have been made reveal the fact that nearly all
of them are born to mothers more than forty years of age, and
apparently at a period of very low efficiency in reproductive capacity.
While most of the discussion and literature stress the importance of
the age of the mother, some data are now available which throw
responsibility also on the paternal side.</p>

<p>    Korosi, as reported by Tredgold in Mental Deficiency, came to
the conclusion as a result of the investigation of 24,000 unselected
individuals that the children of fathers below twenty or above forty
years of age are weaker than the children of fathers between these
ages. Also, the children of mothers over forty years of age are weaker
than those born to mothers below this age. Tredgold presents data
connecting defective structures in the brain with certain phases of
physical behavior and mental deficiencies. He quotes many authors whose
data correspond with his own. Much of this material relates to accounts
of incomplete prenatal development of nerve structures in the
brain.</p>

<p>    We are particularly interested in the origin and the nature of
the brain lesions. Penrose, <font size="-2">(5)</font> in analyzing the
relative etiologic importance of birth order and maternal age in
Mongolism presents data obtained from an examination of 224 defectives
in which the total number of children in all the families involved was
1,013. Accordingly, in these families approximately 20 per cent were so
affected. The average number of children per family was five and
one-half. He states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Mongolian imbeciles are very often born last in
a long family. This fact, which was pointed out many years ago by
Shuttleworth, has led clinicians to believe that Mongolism is to some
extent a product of the exhaustion of maternal reproductive powers due
to frequent child bearing. . . . The conclusion is widely accepted with
the reservation that the affected child is not necessarily born at the
end of the family. Several cases are first-born, in fact, and it is
sometimes stated that the conditions occur more frequently in first and
last children than in other ordinal positions. There is, however, ample
evidence that Mongolian imbeciles have a significantly later birth rank
than normal children.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    G. Ordahl <font size="-2">(6)</font> has reported on a study of
ninety-one cases in which he found that fifty-six or 60 per cent were
the last born. The families averaged five children. He states that
"uterine exhaustion is the most commonly advanced reason for
Mongolism." Madge T. Macklin <font size="-2">(7)</font> says, "It is
usually stated that it (Mongolism) occurs more frequently in the later
pregnancies owing either to reproductive exhaustion or to too advanced
age of the mother." We are concerned at this point for evidence that
will throw light on the relationship between the functioning of the
pituitary body in the base of the brain and the development of this
type of facial and mental deformity.</p>

<p>    A striking case is that of a boy sixteen years of age who was a
typical Mongolian idiot. He had two sisters who were much older than
he. His mother was a partial invalid when he was born late in her life.
We have no data relative to the details of the children who may have
been lost. His father was living and well except for a railroad injury.
This boy at the age of sixteen was infantile in many of his
characteristics and developments. The genitals were those of a boy
eight years old. The facial expression was that of the typical
Mongolian idiot. By the Binet test he had a mentality of about four
years. Roentgenograms of his hands showed that the epiphyseal bones had
not united. He played on the floor with blocks and with rattles like a
child. His interest was in children's activities. (Fig. 125.) The
outstanding physical characteristic was his maxillary arch which was so
much smaller than the mandibular arch that it went entirely inside it.
In order to give him a masticating surface, and with the hope of
helping him both physically and mentally, since several cases had
greatly benefited by such an operation, I determined to widen his arch
by moving the maxillary bones apart about one-half inch. The position
of his teeth before the moving of the bones is shown in Fig. 126.
Roentgenograms showing the opening of the median suture with increase
of pressure are also shown in Fig. 126. An important phase of this case
was that the left nostril was entirely occluded, and probably had been
all his life. A rhinologist spent half an hour trying to shrink the
tissue with adrenalin and cocain sufficiently to get air or water
through, and was not able to do so. The quantity of air that he was
able to inhale through his right nostril was so scant that he
continually breathed with his mouth open. At night he was forced to lie
with something like his coat rolled into a hard ridge and placed under
the back of his neck and his head pushed far back to a position that
would open his mouth and retain it so, or he would awaken, strangling
because of the closing of his mouth.</p>

<p>    With the movement of the maxillary bones laterally, as shown
progressively in Fig. 126, there was a very great change in his
physical development and mentality. He grew three inches in about four
months. His moustache started to grow immediately; and in twelve weeks'
time the genitals developed from those of a child to those of a man,
and with it a sense of modesty. His mental change was even more marked.
The space between the maxillary bones was widened about one-half inch
in about thirty days. This lateral pressure on the maxillary bones was
accomplished by rigid attachments to the teeth of the two sides of the
upper arch. The outward movement of the maxillary bones (which form the
roof of the mouth and sides of the nose) by pressure on the temporal
bones produced a tension downward on the floor of the anterior part of
the brain, thus stimulating the pituitary gland in the base of the
brain. In a few weeks' time he passed through stages that usually take
several years. At first, he got behind the door to frighten us; later,
he put bent pins on chairs to see us jump when we sat down, and finally
he became the cause of a policeman's coming to the office from where he
was conducting traffic on the corner below to find who it was squirting
water on him when his back was turned. He developed a great fondness
for calling people over the telephone, wanted to borrow my automobile
to take his mother for a drive, and with his arm caressingly about the
shoulders of one of the secretaries, invited her to go with him to a
dance. All this change developed in about twelve weeks.</p>

<p>    A most remarkable event happened in connection with this
procedure. He lived in another city, and so, while with me, stayed in a
boarding house at a little distance from my office in order that he
might have frequent, and almost constant attention. On his return to
his home town, his efficiency had increased to such an extent that his
mother could send him with the money to the grocery store with the
order for the day's groceries, and he could bring back the right change
and could tell when it was correct. He could also come alone to me
ninety miles by railroad and make two changes of trains and the various
transfers on the street cars of the city with accuracy and safety.</p>

<p>    He wore an appliance in his mouth to keep the bones in position.
This appliance became dislodged; the maxillary bones settled together;
immediately, or in a day or two, he lapsed into his old condition of
lethargy accompanied by an old trouble, which had frequently been
distressing, namely, nausea, this sometimes lasting for twenty-four
hours. With the readaptation of the separating appliance and the
reconstruction of the retaining appliance, he returned rapidly to his
improved condition.</p>

<p>    But a new problem had developed. We had changed an infant to a
potential man with the impulses of a man, but with the mind of a child.
With the change in his physical condition he became a menace in his
community as a sex pervert. His mother died and his sister married. It
became necessary to have him placed in a state institution for
defectives. During the period he was in my care, he had learned to read
child stories and newspaper headings, and had spent much time doing so.
The changes in his physical appearance are shown in Fig. 125, above,
front view, and below, side view. The first picture at the left shows
his appearance before the operation; the second, thirty days after; and
the last, six months later. The opening produced in the upper arch in
front of half an inch was filled by supplying two teeth on a
restoration, which at the same time held the maxillary bones in their
new position. In six months he had developed whiskers and moustache.
The progressive changes in the position of the maxillary bones with the
opening of the median suture are shown in Fig. 126, together with the
mechanical appliance. In the last view, the restoration carrying the
porcelain teeth to fill the space is shown.</p>

<p>    A very important contribution to our knowledge of the cause of
Mongolism has recently been published by Dr. Clemens E. Benda, <font
size="-2">(8)</font> Clinical Director of the Wrentham State School,
Wrentham, Massachusetts, in association with the Harvard Medical School
of Boston. He and his group have approached the problem of Mongolism
from two different angles; first, as to determine whether it is
accidental, and second, whether it is a unit of symptoms which can be
related to more essential alteration. Their studies including careful
anatomical studies have been made on the basis of an examination of 125
Mongoloids. He states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Summarizing our investigations, the pituitary in
mongoloids reveals a peculiar and definite pathology. On the basis of
fourteen cases we feel justified in emphasizing that in mongolism
definite failure of the pituitary development is to be found. Mongolism
appears as a hypopituitarism of a specific type, in which the absence
or deficiency of basophiles seems to be essential.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    The evidence indicates that this severe type of facial and brain
injury is related directly to a lowered reproductive capacity of the
mother associated with age, since the majority are born to mothers
beyond forty years of age, and to an inadequate nutrition of the
mother, particularly in vitamin E since this vitamin plays so important
a role in the nutrition of the pituitary body.</p>

<p>    Important new data have been provided in an analysis of births
in the United States in connection with the development of the
Mongolian group. Bleyer <font size="-2">(9)</font> has reported a study
of 2,822 cases. He reports that of the total births in the United
States in 1934, of 1,095,939, there were 1,822 reported as Mongoloids.
The average age of the mothers of these individuals was forty-one
years. He reports data indicating that in the age group of mothers
forty to forty-four the chances of the development of a Mongoloid would
be seventy-five times as high as normal expectancy, and in the age
forty-five to forty-nine the chances are 125 times normal expectancy.
In a group of 1,942 Mongoloids, 1,100 or 57 per cent were last
children. These data are in keeping with those of several other
investigators, and emphasize the problem of depleted reproductive
capacity.</p>

<p>    The interesting problems involved in the birth of identical
twins throw light on the origin of both physical and mental characters.
It is a matter of great significance in connection with these studies
that anomalies which we can associate with parental deficient nutrition
are reproduced in both twins. Important additional light has been
thrown on this phase by a family of six pairs of fraternal twins born
to the same parents. These are reported by Dr. William W. Greulich, of
New Haven. <font size="-2">(10)</font> It is significant that nine of
these individuals (one of the oldest pair is deceased, and the youngest
twins are yet babes in arms) show marked narrowing of the nostrils and
lack of development of the middle third of the face, narrowing of the
face and tendency to be mouth breathers. Further, the severity of this
condition appears to be progressively more severe in the younger pairs
of twins, sufficiently grown to show facial development. There is
accordingly, evidence here of progressive lowering of reproductive
efficiency, and the fact that both individuals are involved similarly
has great significance, since they are fraternal twins arising from a
single ovum. This seems clearly to relate this disturbance with a
deficient germ plasm. Factors that are reproduced in identical twins
would include both hereditary characters and those that are produced by
a disturbance in environment resulting in an interference with normal
hereditary processes. In a case of twins that are not identical, there
is significance in the development of similar deformities which are
likely to be of acquired origin rather than of hereditary origin. In
Fig. 127 is seen a pair of twins. Note that they have similar
disturbance in the development of the dental arches with the upper
laterals depressed and the cuspids crowded outward in the arch.</p>

<table summary="" width="325" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding=

<p>    A very important source of information which deals with the
relation of disturbances of the physical development of the head and
mentality is provided by a study of the members of the teen-age group
who are classed as mentally backward. In an examination of a Cleveland
school in a colored district that has been set aside largely for boys
and girls who are distinctly deficient in their ability to learn, it
was disclosed that a very large percentage suffered from gross facial
deformities when judged by these standards. Typical individuals in this
group are shown in Fig. 128, one is white, lower left. It is clear that
these boys were all physically injured in the formative period. Their
clinical history indicates that the brain was involved in this
disturbed development.</p>

<table summary="" width="325" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding=

<p>    One of the problems involved in the development of the group of
disturbances having physical and mental expressions, is associated with
the sensitiveness of the body during the period of adolescence. Many
students of degenerative problems have emphasized various phases of
this large problem. Burt" commented: "It is almost as though crime were
some contagious disease, to which the constitutionally susceptible were
suddenly exposed at puberty, or to which puberty left them peculiarly
prone." The age of adolescence is also the period of greatest
susceptibility to dental caries. Data derived from chemical studies of
the blood and saliva show that in this period of susceptibility to
dental caries the supplies of minerals and vitamins are inadequate to
meet Nature's demands, and the system borrows minerals from the
skeleton to maintain vital processes. Lichtenstein and Brown <font
size="-2">(12)</font> report data which reveal that educational
quotients, like intelligence quotients, fall with increase in age
during the years of developing puberty. They show that the educational
quotient at nine years of age for the group studied was 100; at eleven
years of age, 89; at twelve years, 83; and at thirteen years, 74. The
changes in facial and dental arch form, which I have described at
length in this volume, develop in this age period also, not as a result
of faulty nutrition of the individual but as the result of distortions
in the architectural design in the very early part of the formative
period. Apparently, they are directly related to qualities in the germ
plasm of one or both parents, which result from nutritional defects in
the parent before the conception took place, or deficient nutrition of
the mother in the early part of the formative period. Case records show
that the first signs of delinquency generally make their appearance
during these years. The age reported most frequently was that of
thirteen.</p>

<p>    One expression of the rate of the progressive degeneration that
is taking place in the United States is the increase in delinquency and
crime in young people between twelve and twenty years of age, as well
as in crime in general. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Bureau of
Investigation, has recently published data showing comparative figures
for 1936 and 1937, during which time crimes in the United States
increased from 1,333,526 to 1,415,816, an increase of six per cent.
This increase is occurring in spite of the rapid development of social
organizations for improving the environment.</p>

<p>    Preventive measures among the unsocial group, who pass through
the stages of predelinquency and crime, have been almost entirely
confined to improvement in the social surroundings of the growing
youth. While, no doubt, individuals with a low factor of safety are
less likely to develop serious criminal tendencies under favorable
environments, such factors as constitute a first-conditioning force,
i.e., injury of the germ plasm, and deficient nutrition in the
developmental period are not corrected by these efforts. These new data
relating to the nature of the underlying causes strongly emphasize the
need for beginning much earlier. Indeed, the preparation for the next
generation should begin early in the life of the preceding
generation.</p>

<p>    Many investigators have emphasized the sensitiveness of the
nervous system to disturbances in the formative period. Considerable
data have been presented indicating that the tissues of the nervous
system are the most easily affected of all the structures of the body.
The extent of the injuries to the nervous system vary through a wide
range.</p>

<p>    Harris in his chapter on "Congenital Abnormalities of the
Skeleton" in Blacker's <font size="-2">(13)</font> "Chances of Morbid
Inheritance" has presented data indicating the sensitive period at
which the ovum is most likely to be injured:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Few normal human embryos have been subjected to
careful study. The vast majority of human embryos examined have been
abnormal, and it is their abnormality which has led to their abortion
between the sixth and thirteenth weeks of embryonic life, a critical
period associated with the development of the placenta, during which
the death rate is probably in the neighborhood of at least 15 per
cent.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In tracing the development of the human embryo, he tells why the
growth process is very different from that of the development of
embryos of lower forms. He states regarding deformed ova: "Ova that
survive the eighth week tend to live on to term, and are born as
monsters." I have referred previously to a personal communication from
Professor Shute, of the University of Western Ontario, which states
that he had been impressed with the high percentage of deformities in
aborted fetuses. This seems to be Nature's method of eliminating
defective individuals. Harris says further:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    It is sometimes suggested that threatened
abortions in early pregnancy should not be treated by rest and quiet,
as it is quite possible that the uterus is attempting to rid itself of
a pathological ovum which might become a monster in the
future.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    The available data emphasize strongly that a very small
percentage of the total gross deformities ever develop to menace
society. Harris quotes Mall: <font size="-2">(14)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   He estimated from the records of 100,000
pregnancies that there were 80,572 normal births, 11,765 abortions of
normal embryos and early monsters, and 615 monsters born at term. Thus
at term 1 child in 132 is born with some anatomical defect. For each
such case appearing at term, 12 others died and were aborted during
pregnancy.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    These data deal with gross defects involving physical
deficiencies in the infant and indicate that the defects that are
produced in the formative period, which are less severe than the above,
are not recognizable at birth and may not be until long afterwards.
According to Harris, "During the fourth week of embryonic life the
head, brain and spinal cord are most susceptible to adverse
conditions." He traces the sensitive areas of the various structures
through the various weeks in the embryonic history. The deformities of
the face among the primitive races which I have illustrated extensively
frequently are not revealed until the eruption of the permanent
dentition and the development of the adult features. While it is true
that many children show deformity in facial development even in
babyhood and childhood, those individuals are usually much more
seriously injured when the adult face is developed.</p>

<p>    Bloom <font size="-2">(15)</font> has presented the anatomical
and histological characteristics of a defective born to a mother
fifty-one years of age, whose general health was reported as good. The
infant's facial pattern was markedly divergent from normal and
practically no brain tissues had been formed. This expression of an
extreme injury was entirely beyond that with which we are concerned in
the study of the mental and the moral cripples who constitute an
increasing part of our society. This is presented to emphasize Nature's
inexorable requirement that each parent shall be individually
physically fit for the responsibility of producing the next generation.
Several primitive races studied have realized this responsibility.</p>

<p>    There are some phases of modern physical degeneration in which
most of us take part with remarkable complacency. We would consider it
a great misfortune and disgrace to burn up the furniture in our homes
to provide warmth, if fuel were available for the collection. This is
precisely what we are doing with our skeletons by a process of
borrowing, simply because we fail to provide new body repairing
material each day in the food. You are all familiar with the tragic
misfortune that overtakes so many elderly people through the accident
of a broken hip or other fractured bone. Statistics show that
approximately 50 per cent of fractured hips occurring in people beyond
65 years of age never unite. We look upon this as one of the inevitable
consequences of advancing age. In Chapter 15 I have referred to the
small boy whose leg was broken when he fell in a convulsion while
walking across the kitchen floor. That bone did not break because the
blow was hard but because the minerals had been borrowed from the
inside by the blood stream in order to maintain an adequate amount of
the minerals, chiefly calcium and phosphorus in the blood and body
fluids. He had been borrowing from his skeleton for months because due
to a lack of vitamins he could not absorb even the minerals that were
present in the inadequate food that he was eating. The calcium and the
phosphorus of the milk were in the skimmed milk that he was using but
he needed the activators of the butter-fat in order to use the
minerals. Simply replacing white bread with these activators and the
normal minerals and vitamins of wheat immediately checked the
convulsions.</p>

<p>    We have many other expressions of this borrowing process. Much
of what we have thought of as so-called pyorrhea in which the bone is
progressively lost from around the teeth thus allowing them to loosen,
constitutes one of the most common phases of the borrowing process.
This tissue with its lowered defense rapidly becomes infected and we
think of the process largely in terms of that infection. A part of the
local process includes the deposit of so-called calculus and tartar
about the teeth. These contain toxic substances which greatly irritate
the flesh starting an inflammatory reaction. Many primitive peoples not
only retain all of their teeth, many of them to an old age, but also
have a healthy flesh supporting these teeth. This has occurred in spite
of the fact that the primitives have not had dentists to remove the
deposits and no means for doing so for themselves. Note particularly
the teeth of the Eskimos. The teeth are often worn nearly to the gum
line and yet the gum tissue has not receded. Many of these primitive
groups were practically free from the affection which we have included
in the general term of pyorrhea or gingivitis. Pyorrhea in the light of
our newer knowledge is largely a nutritional problem. While nutrition
alone often will not be adequate for correcting it, when established
practically no treatment will be completely adequate without
reinforcing the nutrition in so far as deficient nutrition has been a
contributing factor. Nutrition plus the frequent removal of deposits,
plus suitable medication will check and prevent pyorrhea but not
correct the damage that has already been done. The elements that are
chiefly needed in our nutrition are those that I have outlined as being
particularly abundant in the menus as used by several of the primitive
races. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 15.</p>

<p>    Another important aspect of this problem of borrowing has to do
with the progressive shrinking of the skeleton as evidenced by the
shortening of the stature. I have measured many individuals who have
lost from two to six inches in height in a decade or two. I have seen a
few individuals who have lost as much as ten inches of their height by
this process of borrowing from the skeleton. Our bodies need a certain
amount of fresh minerals every day with which to manufacture blood. The
days that these minerals are not provided in the foods they will be
taken from our storage depots, the skeleton.</p>

<p>    A particularly tragic phase of this problem of borrowing from
the bone is seen in growing girls and is chiefly due to their ambition
to avoid enlargement of their bodies to keep down their weight. The
girls deprive themselves of body building material at a time when their
bodies are growing and are requiring considerable new mineral. Forming
bone has a prior claim on minerals, which is sufficiently commanding to
induce the individual to borrow from bones that are already formed to
provide for the necessary lengthening and growth. By this process many
of the bones of the body are softened, particularly the bones of the
spine. Curvatures develop, one of the expressions of which may be round
or stooped shoulders.</p>

<p>    Among primitive races this type of girl, so commonly seen in our
modern civilization, is absent. Probably not one of these girls has
ever suspected the suffering and sorrow that is being stored up for
future life as a result of this bad management at a critical time in
her development. Fig. 134 illustrates one of the tragedies of this
borrowing process. Practically all of these physical evidences of
degeneration can be prevented and fortunately many of them can be
relieved in large part with an adequate nutrition. Even ununited
fractures often can be induced to unite by an adequate reinforcement of
the nutrition. This is true not only for young people but for elderly
people as well.</p>

<p>    In addition to the problems growing out of physical injuries
through lack of development before birth, which express themselves as
facial and other deformities, there is increasing need for concern for
physical handicaps entailed in underdevelopment of the hips. The
difficulty encountered at childbirth in our modern civilization has
been emphasized by Dr. Kathleen Vaughan <font size="-2">(16)</font> of
London. In her book, "Safe Childbirth," she states that faults of
development more than race modify pelvic shape. In the Foreword to her
book, Dr. Howard A. Kelly, Professor Emeritus of Gynaecological
Surgery, Johns Hopkins University, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Dr. Vaughan presents such an array of facts and
data that the book must impress every reader. It is of vital importance
that her conclusions be considered, for in my opinion our methods of
bringing up our girls and the habits of our women with many of the
customs of 'civilized' life must be radically readjusted.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This important work should be made available for reference in the
school libraries of the United States. Further data from it are
presented in Chapter 21.</p>

<p>    The great contrast in discomfort and length of time of the labor
of modern mothers is to be contrasted with ease of childbirth among
primitive mothers. Many workers among the primitive races have
emphasized the vigorous health and excellence of the infant at birth.
We have here, therefore, emphasis on the need in the interest of the
infant that the mother shall have an easy and short labor. Both of
these factors are directly influenced by the vitamin content of the
mother's body as supplied by her nutrition and also by the physical
development of her body if her mother at the time of gestation and
prior to conception had adequate vitamins in her food to insure perfect
germ cells.</p>

<p>    The sensitivity of the brain to injury resulting from medication
given the mother has been emphasized by Dr. Frederic Schreiber of
Detroit. In his paper before the American Medical Association meeting
in San Francisco, June, 1938, he was quoted as saying <font size=
"-2">(17)</font> that the analysis showed that 72 per cent of the
children had shown difficulty in breathing at the time of birth or in
the first few days following birth. He concluded, therefore, that this
difficulty in breathing was the cause of the brain damage.</p>

<p>    Difficulty in breathing would lead to a shortage of oxygen. An
insufficient supply of oxygen in the blood stream would have serious
effects upon the tissues of the brain. In this connection, he cited
evidence found in post-mortem examinations that deficiency of oxygen
caused microscopic changes in the brain.</p>

<p>    X-ray photographs of some of the children examined by Dr.
Schreiber showed various degrees of brain atrophy.</p>

<p>    The contribution of Dr. Schreiber also emphasizes strongly the
susceptibility of the brain tissue to injuries which may handicap the
individual throughout life.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1">SOIL DEPLETION AND PLANT AND
ANIMAL<br>
DETERIORATION</font></p>

<p><font size="+3">T</font>HE data available on the subject of soil
depletion and animal deterioration are so voluminous that it would
require a volume to present them adequately. When we realize the
quantities of many of the minerals which must enter into the
composition of the bodies of human beings and other animals, we
appreciate the difficulty of providing in pasture and agricultural
soils a concentration of these minerals sufficient to supply the needs
for plant growth and food production. If we think of growing plants and
grasses in terms of average soil tilled to a depth of seven inches, we
are dealing with a total of approximately two million pounds of soil
per acre, of which two thousand pounds will be phosphorus in its
various chemical forms, some of which will not be readily available for
plants. If one-half of this phosphorus were present in an available
form, there would be enough for only one hundred poor crops, utilizing
ten pounds to the acre for the seed alone; or for forty good crops,
taking twenty-five pounds per acre, assuming that the seed were to be
removed from that land and not replaced. A sixty-bushel crop of wheat
or corn per acre takes twenty-five to twenty-eight pounds of phosphorus
in the seed. The soil is depleted of calcium similarly, though that
mineral is not usually present in such limited amounts nor so rapidly
taken away as is phosphorus. The leaves and stems of rapidly growing
young plants and grasses are rich in calcium and phosphorus. As the
plants ripen the phosphorus is transported in large amounts to the seed
while most of the calcium remains in the leaves. A large part of the
commerce of the world is concerned with the transportation of chemical
elements as foods, chief of which are calcium and phosphorus. Whether
the product of the soil is ultimately used as wheat for bread, milk and
meat for foods, or wool and hides for clothing, every pound of these
products that is shipped represents a depletion of soil for pasturage
or for grain production.</p>

<p>    If we think of one hundred good crops constituting the limit of
capacity of the best soils, and one-fourth of that for a great deal of
the acreage of the tillable soil, we are probably over-generous. This
problem of depletion may seem to many people unimportant, either
because there has been no consciousness that depletion has been taking
place, or because they believe that replenishment is a simple
matter.</p>

<p>    In correspondence with government officials in practically every
state of the United States I find that during the last fifty years
there has been a reduction in capacity of the soil for productivity in
many districts, amounting to from 25 to 50 per cent. I am informed also
that it would cost approximately fifty dollars per acre to replenish
the supply of phosphorus.</p>

<p>    Many people realize that farms they knew in their childhood have
ceased to be productive because they have "run out." The movement of
population to cities and towns is, in part, the result of the call of
the social center and in part a consequence of the need of forsaking
depleted soil. While there are many things that influence the movement
from the farms, there is much to be learned from the government census
reports which deal directly with farm acreage and values.</p>

<p>    If we relate the levels of life of human and domestic animals to
the problem of soil depletion, we find two important groups of data.
First, there are those which relate to specific land areas, some small
and some very large; and second, those which relate to civilizations
and groups, both large and small that have passed out of existence or
are rapidly deteriorating. A study of the skeletons of the past and
present often discloses a progressive breakdown. For example, we may
mention the important anthropological findings of Professor Hooton of
Harvard, who, in his examinations of various pueblos of the Western
Plains, especially at the Pecos Pueblo where the progressive burials
have been uncovered, has brought to light the calendar of a
civilization extending over a thousand years. These findings show that
there has been over the period of years a progressive increase in
skeletal deformities, including arthritis and dental caries, together
with a reduction in stature, suggesting a direct relationship to
progressive depletion of the soil.</p>

<p>    In a recent magazine article, I have presented data <font size=
"-2">(1)</font> comparing the mineral content of different pasture
grasses, and relating these to deficiencies in cattle. Unfortunately,
space does not permit reviewing these data here in detail. They show
that calcium varied from 0.17 per cent for a dry pasture grass in
Arizona to 1.9 per cent in a Pennsylvania pasturage plant, to 2 per
cent in a British Columbia pasturage plant, a range of over ten fold.
Similarly, phosphorus was shown to vary from 0.03 per cent to 1.8 per
cent, a range of sixty fold. Neither pasture animals nor human beings
can eat a sufficient amount of low mineral plant food to provide the
total mineral requirements of ordinary metabolism. In cases of
overload, such as pregnancy and lactation in adults, and rapid growth
in children, the demand is increased greatly. For example, a
high-milk-production cow from southern Texas on a certain low mineral
pasture will run behind her normal requirements about 60 grams of
phosphorus and 160 grams of potassium per day. In that district large
numbers of cattle were unable at the time to maintain their own bodies,
let alone reproduce or provide milk. Many cattle in the district
developed loin disease. It was found that moving them to another plot
of ground where the soil was not depleted provided recovery.</p>

<p>    About thirty-seven billion dollars, or approximately 40 per cent
of the cash income of salaries and wages of the people in the United
States, is used for the purchase of foods. When we add to this the
expenditure of energy by the people living on the land, it represents a
total, probably exceeding fifty billion dollars a year that is spent
for the chemicals that are provided in the foods, a large amount of
which, perhaps 50 per cent, will have been expended for calcium and
phosphorus, perhaps 25 per cent for other chemicals, and 25 per cent
for special vitamin or activator carrying foods. Of this enormous
transportation of minerals from the soil an exceedingly small
proportion gets back to the tillable land in this country. Orr <font
size="-2">(2)</font> states that "Consumption in the United Kingdom of
live stock products mostly derived from grass lands has been estimated
at about four hundred million pounds sterling per annum (<i>nearly two
billion dollars</i>) ." This includes dairy products, meats and hides.
Never in the history of the world has there been such a large scale
depletion of the soil by transportation away from the tilled and
pasturage areas. Sickness in the United States has been calculated to
cost nearly half as much as food, and is increasing.</p>

<p>    An important discovery has been made with regard to the feeding
of dairy cattle and other live stock: the nutritive value of young
grass, when in a state of rapid growth, carries not only a very large
quantity of minerals, but also digestible proteins in amounts that are
approximately equivalent to those provided by the concentrated cereal
cattle foods, such as linseed cake. It is observed also that not only
do the milk products of such cows remain at a high level while the cows
are on the rapidly growing young grass, particularly a rapidly growing
young wheat grass or young rye grass, but the animals themselves are in
better physical condition than when on grain concentrates. Further,
that calves fed on the milk of those cows grow much more rapidly than
they do when the cows are on other fodder and have a much higher
resistance to disease. Grass, to provide these nutritional factors,
must be grown on a very rich, well-balanced soil. A young plant, of
necessity, produces a rapid depletion of soil. Minerals and other
chemicals are removed and therefore there is need for adequate
replacement.</p>

<p>    In Chapter 18 I have reported investigations made by Professors
Meigs and Converse at the Beltsville Experimental Station, in which
they have shown that feeding cattle on a grade of dried hay that was
low in chlorophyll resulted in the development of dead or blind calves,
and further that when the milk of these cows was fed to three normal
calves they died in fifty-seven, sixty-two and seventy-one days
respectively. These calves had been fed on whole milk until twenty days
of age. They show that the main deficiency in this ration was vitamin
A.</p>

<p>    Since mammals require milk in infancy and since it is the most
efficient single food known, I have made a special study of milk and
its products. The role of the vitamins and other activating substances
in foods is quite as important and essential as that of minerals. These
activating substances, in general, can be divided into two groups,
those that are water-soluble and those that are fat-soluble, the former
being much more readily obtained in most communities, than the latter.
Since the fat-soluble and also the water-soluble vitamins are essential
for mineral utilization and particularly since the fat-soluble
activators are so frequently found to be inadequately supplied in diet
and are usually more difficult to obtain, a special effort has been
made to determine the level of these in dairy products in many
different places for different seasons of the year. To accomplish this,
I have obtained each year since 1927 samples of cream and butter,
mostly butter, for analysis for their activator content. The work has
rapidly extended so that for the eleventh year we are receiving now
(1939) samples from several hundred places distributed throughout the
world, usually once or twice a month throughout the year. Methods used
for these studies are both biologic and chemical. These data are used
in connection with morbidity and mortality statistics for the same
districts.</p>

<p>    The progressive changing of the levels of life is shown by the
morbidity and mortality statistics of the various areas of the United
States and Canada. The American Heart Association publishes, from time
to time, very important data relative to the number of deaths from
heart disease in the various states of the Union. It is of interest to
note that the highest mortality levels that are obtained are found in
those states, in general, that have been longest occupied by modern
civilizations, namely, the Atlantic States, the New England States, the
Great Lakes States and the Pacific States. Their data published in
their booklet ~tHeart Disease Mortality Statistics" and based on the
United States Registration area reveal that the death rate per 100,000
population was 123 in 1900. The data sent me in November 1937 from the
United States Census Bureau, Department of Commerce, in Washington,
report the death rate from heart per 100,000 for 1934 as 239.9, in
other words an increase of 86.9 per cent in thirty-four years. Figures
provided by the Bureau of Census for England and Wales show the death
rate per 100,000 to be 269.3; and for Scotland, 232. While the average
figure for the United States Registration area of 224 deaths per
100,000 seems very high, it is exceedingly important to note that the
New England States were much higher, leading the entire country.
Massachusetts reported 307.3; New Hampshire, 323.1; Vermont, 310.8; New
York, 302.1; Maine, 297.5. The rate of increase in the decade of 1921
to 1930 was 51.3 per cent for Delaware; 52 per cent for Connecticut, 51
per cent for Pennsylvania, 59.4 per cent for Missouri, 60.0 per cent
for Washington; 55 per cent for Wisconsin; 64 per cent for Louisiana;
71 per cent for Florida; 63 per cent for South Carolina; 81 per cent
for Montana; 61 per cent for Kentucky; and 51.9 per cent for North
Carolina. Such rates of increase as these are cause for alarm.</p>

<p>    Sir Arnold Theiler, who spent a quarter of a decade studying the
problems of nutritional deficiency diseases among pasture animals in
South Africa, has discussed at length the reduction of phosphorus in
available quantities for plant development as constituting, by far, the
most important mineral deficiency. He reported data obtained from many
countries through the world, indicating that the deterioration of
cattle and sheep can be directly traced to an inadequate amount of
phosphorus in the soil. He states, in discussing the relation of this
problem to the conditions as they obtain in Australia, that: <font
size="-2">(3)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   Amongst the Australian data the figures showing
depletion of phosphorus as a result of sale of products off the farm
without adequate replacement by manuring, are interesting. Thus
Richardson estimates that it would take two million tons of
superphosphate to replace the phosphorus removed in the form of milk,
mutton and wool. In the "ranching stage" of the development of a
country the fact is often forgotten that the balance of Nature is
frequently disturbed to the detriment of generations to
come.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    It is important to keep in mind that morbidity and mortality
data for many diseases follow a relatively regular course from year to
year, with large increases in the late winter and spring and a marked
decrease in summer and early autumn. The rise and fall of the level of
morbidity with the changing season produces curves that are exceedingly
regular for the same place from year to year. The distribution,
however, is distinctly different for different latitudes and altitudes.
It is further of special importance to note that the curves for the
Southern Hemisphere, with its opposite seasons, are in reverse of those
of the Northern Hemisphere, and have very similar levels for the same
seasonal periods. I have obtained the figures for the levels of
morbidity for several diseases in several countries, including the
United States and Canada. I find that the distribution of the rise and
fall in morbidity and mortality does not follow the sunshine curve but
does follow the curve of vegetable growth. Accordingly, I have made
studies by dividing the United States and Canada into sixteen
districts, four from East to West and four from North to South. I have
plotted by months the levels of mortality for heart disease and
pneumonia in these various districts, from figures obtained from the
governments of these two countries. Similarly, I have plotted curves
for the vitamin content found in butter and cream samples obtained from
these sixteen districts. When these are arranged in accordance with the
levels by months they are found, in each case, to be opposite to the
mortality from heart disease and pneumonia. It is also important to
note that while these curves show a higher midsummer level of vitamins
in dairy products in the northern tier of districts, the period of high
level is shorter than in the more southern division. Two peaks tend to
appear in the summer cycle of curves for the vitamins, one representing
the spring period of active growth and the other, the fall period.
These peaks are closer together in the north than in the south.</p>

<p>    A particularly important phase of this study is the finding of a
lower level of vitamins throughout the year in those districts which
correspond with the areas of the United States and Canada that have
been longest settled, and consequently most depleted by agriculture. A
similar study has been made based on the data published in a report by
Tisdall, Brown and Kelley, <font size="-2">(4)</font> of Toronto. Their
figures for children's diseases which included chicken pox, measles,
nephritis, scarlet fever, hemorrhage of newborn, tetany and
retropharyngeal abscess were arranged according to the incidence for
each month. All of these diseases show a relatively high incidence
during February and March, rising in December and January, falling
during April and May, reaching a very low level in midsummer and then
making a rapid increase during the autumn. These are opposite to the
vitamin levels found in the dairy products of Ontario for the same
months.</p>

<p>    In Chapter 3, I discussed data obtained during two summers in
the Loetschental and other Swiss valleys. The Loetschental Valley has
been isolated from contact with surrounding civilizations by its unique
physical environment. For twelve hundred years during which time a
written history of the valley has been kept, the people have maintained
a high level of physical excellence providing practically all their
food, shelter and clothing from the products raised in the valley.
Cattle and goats provided milk, milk products and meat. The stock was
carefully sheltered during the inclement weather and great care was
used to carry back to the soil all of the enrichment. This, of course,
is a process that is efficiently carried out in many parts of the world
today. In this manner extensive depletion of the minerals required for
food for animals and human beings may be prevented. Their practice is
in striking contrast to that in many of the agricultural districts of
the United States in which the minerals are systematically shipped from
the land to the cities, there to be dissipated to the ocean through the
sewerage system. Among many primitive races there is some attempt to
preserve the fertility of the soil. For example, in Africa, many of the
tribes that depend in part on agriculture, cleared off only a few acres
in the heart of a forest and cropped this land for a limited number of
years, usually less than ten. Great care was taken to prevent the loss
of the humus both through drenching rains and wind erosion. The
decaying vegetation and lighter soil that might be dislodged by the
water were caught in the entanglement of roots and shrubbery
surrounding the agricultural patch. The surrounding trees protect the
soil from wind erosion. Care was taken not to form gullies, furrows and
grooves that could carry currents of water and thus float away the
valuable humus from the soil. This again is in contrast to conditions
in other parts of the world, particularly in the United States. Sears
<font size="-2">(5)</font> has stated that "Bare ground left by the
plow will have as much soil washed off in ten years as the unbroken
prairie will lose in four thousand. Even so, soil in the prairie will
be forming as fast as, or faster than it is lost." In Nature's program,
minerals are loaned temporarily to the plants and animals and their
return to the soil is essential. To quote again from Sears.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    What is lent by earth has been used by countless
generations of plants and animals now dead and will be required by
countless others in the future. In the case of an element such as
phosphorus, so limited is the supply that if it were not constantly
being returned to the soil, a single century would be sufficient to
produce a disastrous reduction in the amount of life.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    The history of preceding civilizations and cultures of mankind
indicate the imbalances that have developed when minerals have been
permanently transferred from the soil. There are only a few localities
in the world where great civilizations have continued to exist through
long periods and these have very distinct characteristics. It required
only a few centuries, and in some profligated systems a few decades to
produce so serious a mineral depletion of the soil that progressive
plant and animal deterioration resulted. In such instances, regular and
adequate replenishment was not taking place.</p>

<p>    The replenishment may be made, as in the case of the prairie
with its plant and animal life, through a replacement in the soil of
borrowed minerals, a program carried out efficiently by a few
intelligent civilizations. The balance of the cultures have largely
failed at this point. Another procedure for the replenishing of the
depleted soils is by the annual spring overflow of great water systems
which float enrichment from the highlands of the watersheds to the
lower plains of the great waterways. This is illustrated by the history
of the Nile which has carried its generous blanket of fertilizing humus
and rich soil from the high interior of Africa northward over its long
course through Sudan and Egypt to the Mediterranean, and thus made it
possible for the borders of the Nile to sustain a population of greater
density than that of either China or India. The salvation of Egypt has
been the fact that the source of the Nile has been beyond the reach of
modernizing influences that could destroy Nature's vast stores of these
replenishing soil products. Where human beings have deforested vast
mountainsides at the sources of the great waterways, this whole problem
has been changed.</p>

<p>    A similar situation has occurred in China. Her two great rivers,
the Yangtze and the Yellow River, having their sources in the isolated
vastness of the Himalayas in Tibet, have through the centuries provided
the replenishment needed for supporting the vast population of the
plains of these great waterways. Together with this natural
replenishment the Chinese have been exceedingly efficient in returning
to the soil the minerals borrowed by the plant and animal life. Their
efficiency as agriculturists has exceeded that of the residents of most
parts of the populated world.</p>

<p>    The story in Europe and America has been vastly different in
many districts. The beds of roots of trees and grasses that hold the
moisture and induce precipitation have been rudely broken up. An
important function of the plant and tree roots is the entanglement of
dead plant life. Vegetation holds back moisture at the time of melting
snows and rainy seasons so efficiently that disastrous floods are
prevented and a continuing flow of water maintained over an extended
period. Under the pressure of population more and more of the highlands
have been denuded for agriculture; the forests have often been
ruthlessly burned down, frequently with the destruction of very
valuable timber. The ashes from these great conflagrations provided
fertilizer for a few good crops, but these chemicals were dissipated
rapidly in the swift flow of the water in which they were soluble, with
the result that vast areas that Nature had taken millenniums to forest
have been denuded and the soil washed away in a few decades. These
mountainsides have become a great menace instead of a great storehouse
of plant food material for the plains country of the streams. Loss of
timber which was needed greatly for commerce and manufacture has been
another disastrous result. The heavy rains of the spring now find
little impediment and rush madly toward the lower levels to carry with
them not the rich vegetable matter of the previous era, but clay and
rocks which in a mighty rush spread over the vast plains of the
lowlands. This material is not good soil with which to replenish and
fertilize the river bottoms. On the contrary, it often covers the
plains country with a layer of silt many feet deep making it impossible
to utilize the fertile soil underneath.</p>

<p>    We have only to look over the departed civilizations of historic
times to see the wreckage and devastation caused by these processes.
The rise and fall in succession of such cultures as those of Greece,
Rome, North Africa, Spain, and many districts of Europe, have followed
the pattern which we are carving so rapidly with the rise and fall of
the modernized culture in the United States.</p>

<p>    The complacency with which the masses of the people as well as
the politicians view our trend is not unlike the drifting of a merry
party in the rapids above a great cataract. There seems to be no
appropriate sense of impending doom.</p>

<p>    An outstanding example of our profligate handling of soil and
watersheds may be seen in our recent experiences in the Mississippi
Basin. The Ohio River draining the western slopes of the Allegheny
Mountains has gone on rampages almost annually for a decade carrying
with it great damage to property and loss of life. Other branches of
the Mississippi, particularly the Missouri, draining the eastern slopes
of the Rocky Mountains have gone out of control so that vast areas are
flooded with silt. There is now a concerted effort to stem this series
of cataclysms by building dykes along the great waterways to raise the
banks and dams in the higher regions of the watershed to hold back the
floods. These artificial lakes become settling pools for the silt and
soon lose their efficiency by being filled with the debris that they
are holding back from the lower levels. An effort is also being made to
reforest which is purposeful, but when we consider the millenniums of
time that Nature has required to build the tanglewood of plant life,
shrubbery and trees over the rocks and through the gullies to act as
great defenses for holding back the water, these modern programs offer
very little assurance for early relief.</p>

<p>    Another very destructive force is the wind. When surfaces are
denuded either at high or low altitudes the wind starts carving up the
soil and starts it on the march across the country. We call the
demonstrations dust storms. When we travel through our Western States,
it is not uncommon to see buildings and trees partially buried in these
rolling dunes of drifting sand. When we were traveling across the
desert of Peru in 1937, we saw in many places mountain-like dunes
rolling slowly across the country, frequently so completely blocking
former traffic routes that long detours were necessary. When we were
flying over eastern Australia in search of groups of primitive
aborigines, we saw great forests gradually being engulfed with these
marching billows of sand so that most of the trees were covered to
their tips.</p>

<p>    Few people will realize that it is estimated that only about 45
per cent of the land surface of the United States is now available for
agricultural purposes and grazing. This includes vast areas that are
rapidly approaching the limit of utility.</p>

<p>    In one of my trips to the Western States I visited a large ranch
of some fifty thousand acres. I asked the rancher whether he was
conscious of a depletion in the soil of the ranch in its ability to
carry pasture cattle. He said that it was very greatly depleted, that
whereas formerly the cows on the ranch were able to produce from
ninety-three to ninety-five healthy calves per hundred cows annually,
nearly all of sufficiently high physical quality to be available for
reproductive purposes, now he was getting only forty to forty-four
calves per hundred cows annually and usually only ten or eleven of
these were physically fit for reproductive purposes. He stated also
that he was able to raise as many calves for restocking the ranch on
the plant food produced on the fifty acres to which he was applying a
high fertilization program as on the rest of the fifty-thousand-acre
ranch. Of late most of the calves for the ranch had to be imported from
other states.</p>

<p>    In a city in the vicinity I inquired of the director of public
health what the death rate was among their children up to one year of
age. He stated that the figures were progressively increasing in spite
of the fact that they were giving free hospitalization and free
prenatal and postnatal care for all mothers who could not afford to pay
for the service. This death rate had more than doubled in fifty years.
I asked how he interpreted the increasing mortality rate among the
infants and mothers. His comment was in effect that they could not
explain the cause, but that they knew that the mothers of this last
generation were far less fit physically for reproduction than their
mothers or grandmothers had been.</p>

<p>    To many uninformed people the answer will seem simple. Those who
are responsible for these programs, recognize the difficulty in
replenishing the exhausted minerals and food elements in adequate
quantity. I have been informed by the director of the department of
agriculture of the state of Ohio that it would cost fifty dollars per
acre to restore the phosphorus alone that has been exhausted during the
last fifty to one hundred years. He stated that the problem is still
further complicated by the fact that the farmer cannot go to a bank and
borrow money to buy this fertilizer. If, however, he buys adjoining
acreage to double his own, he can then borrow twice as much money as he
can on his own farm. But this is not all of the difficulty. Recent data
indicate that if sufficient phosphorus in a form easily available for
plant use were supplied to the land at once, it would kill the plant
life; it must be provided in a form in which by a process of weathering
it is made slowly available for plant utilization. Phosphorus is only
one of the minerals that is readily taken from the soil. Other minerals
also are difficult to provide. I have been able practically to double
the weight and size of beets in five weeks by the addition of a
tablespoonful of ferric ammonium citrate to each square foot of garden
soil.</p>

<p>    An important commentary on soil depletion is provided by the
large number of farms that have been abandoned in many districts
throughout the United States. The severe industrial depression which
has thrown large numbers of shop and mill workers out of employment,
has induced a considerable number of these to return to the land for
subsistence. As one drives through farming districts that once were
very fertile many farms are seen apparently abandoned insofar as
tillage is concerned.</p>

<p>    In my studies on the relation of the physiognomy of the people
of various districts to the soil, I have found a difference in the
facial type of the last generation of young adults when compared with
that of their parents. The new generation has inherited depleted soil.
In many communities three generations of adults are available for
study. The yardstick for these comparisons has been developed in the
preceding chapters. It will be of interest for the readers to apply
this yardstick to their own brothers and sisters in comparison with the
parents and particularly their grandparents. The most serious problem
confronting the coming generations is this nearly unsurmountable
handicap of depletion of the quality of the foods because of the
depletion of the minerals of the soil.</p>

of the outlook for our modern civilization is changed in many important
aspects. One of the most urgent changes in our viewpoint should be to
look upon the assortment of physical, mental and moral distortions as
due, in considerable part, to nutritional disturbances in one or both
parents which modify the development of the child, rather than to
accepted factors in the inheritance. The evidence indicates that these
parental disturbances of nutritional origin may affect the germ plasm,
thus modifying the architecture, or may prevent the mother from
building a complete fetal structure, including the brain. In other
words, these data indicate that instead of dealing entirely with
hereditary factors, we are dealing in part with distortions due to
inhibitions of normal hereditary processes. This changes the prospects
for the offspring of succeeding generations. Atavism will still have
plenty to her credit even if she must give up her claim to distortions
of individual characteristics.</p>

<p>    Jacobson <font size="-2">(1)</font> has summarized the
determining factors in individuality and personality when he says "The
Jekyll-Hydes of our common life are ethnic hybrids." Most current
interpretations are fatalistic and leave practically no escape from our
succession of modern physical, mental and moral cripples. Jacobson says
of our modern young people:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Very much of the strange behavior of our young
people to-day is simply due to their lack of ethnical anchorage; they
are bewildered hybrids, unable to believe sincerely in anything, and
disowned by their own ancestral manes. To turn these neurotic hybrids
loose in the world by the million, with no background, no heritage, no
code, is as bad as imposing illegitimacy; their behavior, instead of
expressing easily, naturally and spontaneously a long-used credo, will
be determined by fears and senseless taboos. How can character be built
upon such foundations? There is a ludicrous as well as a pathetic side
to the situation presented by a Greek puzzled by his predominantly
German children, or by the German woman unable to understand her
predominantly Spanish progeny. It is a foolish case over again of hen
hatching ducklings, of wolf fostering foundlings.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>   If our modern degeneration were largely the result of
incompatible racial stocks as indicated by these premises, the outlook
would be gloomy in the extreme. Those who find themselves depressed by
this current interpretation of controlling forces would do well to
recall the experiments on pigs referred to in Chapters 17 and 18, in
which a large colony all born blind and maimed because of maternal
nutritional deficiency--from deficient vitamin A--were able to beget
offspring with normal eyes and normal bodies when they themselves had
normal nutrition.</p>

<p>    Much emphasis has been placed on the incompatibility of certain
racial bloods. According to Jacobson, <font size="-2">(1)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   Aside from the effects of environment, it may
safely be assumed that when two strains of blood will not mix well a
kind of "molecular insult" occurs which the biologists may some day be
able to detect beforehand, just as blood is now tested and matched for
transfusion.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    It is fortunate that there is a new explanation for the
distressing old doctrine which holds that geniuses cannot be born
unless there is an abundant crop of defectives. In this connection
Jacobson says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">   The genius tends to be a product of mixed ethnic
and nervously peculiar stock--stock so peculiar that it exhibits an
unusual amount of badness. The human family pays dearly for its
geniuses. Just as nature in general is prodigal in wasting individuals
for the development of a type, or species, so do we here find much
human wastage apparently for a similar purpose. One may think of the
insane and the defectives as so many individuals wasted in order that a
few geniuses may be developed. It would seem' that in order to produce
one genius there must be battalions of criminals, weaklings and
lunatics. Nietzsche must have had biologic implications of this sort in
mind when he spoke of the masses as merely "fertilizers" for the
genius. This is why the genius has been compared to the lily on the
dunghill. He absorbs all the energy of his family group, leaving the
fertilizing mass depleted.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Our recent data on the primitive races indicate that this theory
is not true, since in a single generation various types and degrees of
physical, mental or moral crippling may occur in spite of their purity
of blood and all that inheritance could accomplish as a reinforcement
through the ages.</p>

<p>    The extent to which the general public has taken for granted
that there is a direct relationship between mental excellence and
mental deficiency is illustrated by the commonly heard expression
"great wits and fools are near akin" which expresses tersely the
attitude of a modern school of psychiatry. This doctrine is not
supported by controlled data from scientifically organized
investigations. One of the principal exponents quoted is Maudsley who
stated "it is not exaggeration to say that there is hardly ever a man
of genius who has not insanity or nervous disorder of some form in his
family." Many reviews of the lives of great men have been published in
support of this doctrine. Havelock Ellis, however, one of the leading
psychologists and psychiatrists of our day, has shown that the
percentage of cases substantiating this doctrine is less than 2 per
cent and less than half that proportion found in the population at
large, which in a tested group he found to be 4.2 per cent. East of
Harvard in discussing this problem states, after reviewing the evidence
pro and con: "Thus it is seen that where one collates the work of the
most competent investigators on the possibility of relation between
insanity and genius the conclusion is unavoidable that none
exists."</p>

<p>   Those who still believe in the old fatalistic doctrines may
answer the questions why the last child is affected seriously much more
often than would be expected through chance; or why the most severe
defectives are born after mothers have exceeded forty years of age; and
still further why our defectives are found chiefly among the later
members of large families. These facts are not explainable by Mendel's
laws of heredity.</p>

<p>    Professor J. C. Brash, of the University of Birmingham, in his
monograph <font size="-2">(2)</font> discusses the current theories in
detail. He emphasizes the role of heredity as the controlling factor in
the origin of divergencies. However, all of the distortions of the face
and jaws which he presents as being related to heredity can be
duplicated, as I have shown, in the disturbances appearing in the first
and second generation after primitive racial stocks have adopted the
foods of our modern civilizations in displacement of their native
foods. He emphasizes the importance of an adequate diet during the
growth period of the child, and also the fact that malocclusion is not
a direct manifestation of rickets. Hellman has emphasized the
importance of childhood diseases. The disturbances which we are
studying here, however, are not related to these influences.</p>

<p>    Two of the outstanding advances in laboratory and clinical
approach to this problem of the relation of the structure of the brain
to its function as expressed in mentality and behavior have been the
work of Tredgold in England, referred to in Chapter 19, and the
"Waverly Researches in the Pathology of the Feeble-Minded," in
Massachusetts. Tredgold recognizes two sources of brain injury,
"germinal blight" and ''arrest'' and puts particular stress on the
former as being pathological and not spontaneous, and related to the
germ of either or both parents due to poisoning of the germ cell. The
"arrest" problems have to do with intra-uterine environmental
disturbances.</p>

<p>    The Waverly group have made very detailed anatomical studies,
both gross and microscopic, of brains of mental defectives and related
these data to the clinical characteristics of the individuals both
mental and physical when living. They have reported in detail two
groups of studies of ten individuals each. In their summary of the
second group they state: <font size="-2">(3)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">  The provisional conclusions drawn from the second
series and the combined first and second series are much in agreement
with the original conclusions drawn from the first series which were as
follows: First that measurable brain can be correlated with testable
mind in the low and high orders with fairly positive results. That is
the small simple brains represented the low intellects or idiots and
the most complex brain patterns corresponded to the high grade, moronic
and subnormal types of feeble-mindedness.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    The lessons from the primitive races demonstrate certain
procedures that should be adopted for checking the progressive
degeneration of our modernized cultures. If, as now seems indicated,
mal-development with its production of physical, mental and moral
cripples is the result of forces that could have been reduced or
prevented, by what program shall we proceed to accomplish this
reduction or prevention?</p>

<p>   I have presumed in this discussion that the primitive races are
able to provide us with valuable information. In the first place, the
primitive peoples have carried out programs that will produce
physically excellent babies. This they have achieved by a system of
carefully planned nutritional programs for mothers-to-be. It is
important to note that they begin this process of special feeding long
before conception takes place, not leaving it, as is so generally done
until after the mother-to-be knows she is pregnant. In some instances
special foods are given the fathers-to-be, as well as the
mothers-to-be. Those groups of primitive racial stocks who live by the
sea and have access to animal life from the sea, have depended largely
upon certain types of animal life and animal products. Specifically,
the Eskimos, the people of the South Sea Islands, the residents of the
islands north of Australia, the Gaelics in the Outer Hebrides, and the
coastal Peruvian Indians have depended upon these products for their
reinforcement. Fish eggs have been used as part of this program in all
of these groups. The cattle tribes of Africa, the Swiss in isolated
high Alpine valleys, and the tribes living in the higher altitudes of
Asia, including northern India, have depended upon a very high quality
of dairy products. Among the primitive Masai in certain districts of
Africa, the girls were required to wait for marriage until the time of
the year when the cows were on the rapidly growing young grass and to
use the milk from these cows for a certain number of months before they
could be married. In several agricultural tribes in Africa the girls
were fed on special foods for six months before marriage. The need for
this type of program is abundantly borne out by recent experimental
work on animals, such as I have reported in Chapters 17, 18 and 19.</p>

<p>    Another important feature of the control of excellence of child
life among the primitive races has been the systematic spacing of
children by control of pregnancies. The interval between children
ranged from two and a half to four years. For most of the tribes in
Africa this was accomplished by the plural-wife system. The wife with
the youngest child was protected.</p>

<p>    The original Maori culture of New Zealand accomplished the same
end by birth control and definite planning. In one of the Fiji Island
tribes the minimum spacing was four years.</p>

<p>    These practices are in strong contrast with either the
haphazard, entirely unorganized programs of individuals in much of our
modern civilization, or the organized over-crowding of pregnancies also
current. The question arises immediately: what can be done in the light
of the data that I have presented in this volume to improve the
condition of our modern civilization? A first requisite and perhaps by
far the most important is that of providing information indicating why
our present haphazard or over-crowded programs of pregnancies are
entirely inadequate. This should include, particularly, the education
of the highschool-age groups, both girls and boys.</p>

<p>    In the matter of instruction of boys and girls it is of interest
that several of the primitive races have very definite programs. In
some, childbirth clinics supervised by the midwife are held for the
growing girls. With several of these tribes, however, the ease with
which childbirth is accomplished is so great that it is looked upon as
quite an insignificant experience. Among the ancient Peruvians,
particularly the Chimu culture, definite programs were carried out for
teaching the various procedures in industry, home-building and home
management. This was accomplished by reproducing in pottery form, as on
practical water jugs, the various incidents to be demonstrated. The
matter of childbirth was reproduced in detail in pottery form so that
it was common knowledge for all young people from earliest observation
to the time the practical problems arose. Many of the problems related
directly were similarly illustrated in pottery forms.</p>

<p>    It is not sufficient that information shall be available through
maternal health clinics to young married couples. If pigs need several
months of special feeding in order that the mothers-to-be may be
prepared for adequate carrying forward of all of the inheritance
factors in a high state of perfection, surely human mothers-to-be
deserve as much consideration. It is shown that it is not adequate that
sufficient vitamin A be present to give the appearance of good health.
If highly efficient reproduction is to be accomplished there must be a
greater quantity than this. There is no good reason why we, with our
modern system of transportation, cannot provide an adequate quantity of
the special foods for preparing women for pregnancy quite as
efficiently as the primitive races who often had to go long distances
without other transportation than human carriers.</p>

<p>    The primitive care of a newborn infant has been a matter of
severe criticism by modernists especially those who have gone among
them to enlighten them in modern ways of child rearing. It is common
practice among many primitive tribes to wrap the newborn infant in an
absorbent moss, which is changed daily. A newborn infant, however, does
not begin having regular all over baths for a few weeks after birth.
While this method is orthodox among the primitives it is greatly
deplored as a grossly cruel and ignoble treatment by most moderns. Dr.
William Forest Patrick of Portland, Oregon was deeply concerned over
the regularly occurring rash that develops on newborn infants shortly
after they are first washed and groomed. He had a suspicion that Nature
had a way of taking care of this. In 1931 he left the original oily
varnish on several babies for two weeks without the ordinary washing
and greasing. He found them completely free from the skin irritation
and infection which accompanies modern treatment. This method was
adopted by the Multanomah County Hospital of Oregon which now reports
that in 1,916 cases of unwashed, unanointed babies only two cases of
pyodermia occurred. They record that each day the clothing was changed
and buttocks washed with warm water. Beyond this the infants were not
handled. Dr. Patrick states that within twelve hours after birth by
Nature's method the infant's skin is clear, and Nature's protective
film has entirely disappeared. In my observations of the infant's care
among primitive races I have been continually impressed with the great
infrequency with which we ever hear a primitive child cry or express
any discomfort from the treatment it receives. Of course, when hungry
they make their wants known. The primitive mother is usually very
prompt, if possible, to feed her child.</p>

<p>    Among the important applications that can be made of the wisdom
of the primitive races is one related to methods for the prevention of
those physical defects which occur in the formative period and which
result in physical, mental and moral crippling. When I visited the
native Fijian Museum at Suva, I found the director well-informed with
regard to the practices of the natives in the matter of producing
healthy normal children. He provided me with a shell of a species of
spider crab which the natives use for feeding the mothers so that the
children will be physically excellent and bright mentally, clearly
indicating that they were conscious that the mother's food influenced
both the physical and mental capacity of the child. The care with which
expectant mothers were treated was unique in many of the Pacific
Islands. For example, in one group we were informed that the mother
told the chief immediately when she became pregnant. The chief called a
feast in celebration and in honor of the new member that would come to
join their colony. At this feast the members of the colony pledged
themselves to adopt the child if its own parents should die. At this
feast the chief appointed one or two young men to be responsible for
going to the sea from day to day to secure the special sea foods that
expectant mothers need to nourish the child. Recent studies on the
vitamin content of crabs have shown that they are among the richest
sources available. We have then for modern mothers the message from
these primitives to use the sea foods liberally, both during the
preparatory period in anticipation of pregnancy and during that entire
period. In Fig. 129 will be seen a woman of one of the Fiji Islands who
had gone several miles to the sea to get this particular type of
lobster-crab which she believed, and which her tribal custom had
demonstrated, was particularly efficient for producing a highly perfect
infant.</p>

<p>    For the Indians of the far North this reinforcement was
accomplished by supplying special feedings of organs of animals. Among
the Indians in the moose country near the Arctic circle a larger
percentage of the children were born in June than in any other month.
This was accomplished, I was told, by both parents eating liberally of
the thyroid glands of the male moose as they came down from the high
mountain areas for the mating season, at which time the large
protuberances carrying the thyroids under the throat were greatly
enlarged.</p>

<p>    Among the Eskimos I found fish eggs were eaten by the
childbearing women, and the milt of the male salmon by the fathers for
the purpose of reinforcing reproductive efficiency.</p>

<p>    The coastal Indians in Peru ate the so-called angelote egg, an
organ of the male fish of an ovoviviparous species. These organs were
used by the fathers-to-be and the fish eggs by the mothers-to-be.</p>

<p>    In Africa I found many tribes gathering certain plants from
swamps and marshes and streams, particularly the water hyacinth. These
plants were dried and burned for their ashes which were put into the
foods of mothers and growing children. A species of water hyacinth is
shown in Fig. 130. The woman shown in Fig. 130, with an enormous
goiter, had come down from a nine-thousand-foot level in the mountains
above Lake Edward. Here all the drinking water was snow water which did
not carry iodine. She had come down from the high area to the
sixthousand-foot level to gather the water hyacinth and other plants to
obtain the ashes from these and other iodine carrying plants to carry
back to her children to prevent, as she explained, the formation of
"big neck," such as she had. The people living at the six-thousand-foot
level also use the ashes of these plants.</p>

<p>    Among many of the tribes in Africa there were not only special
nutritional programs for the women before pregnancy, but also during
the gestation period, and again during the nursing period.</p>

<p>    As an illustration of the remarkable wisdom of these primitive
tribes, I found them using for the nursing period two cereals with
unusual properties. One, was a red millet which was not only high in
carotin but had a calcium content of five to ten times that of most
other cereals. They used also for nursing mothers in several tribes in
Africa, a cereal called by them linga-linga. This proved to be the same
cereal under the name of quinua that the Indians of Peru use liberally,
particularly the nursing mothers. The botanical name is quinoa. This
cereal has the remarkable property of being not only rich in minerals,
but a powerful stimulant to the flow of milk. I have found no record of
the use of similar cereals among either the English or American
peoples. In Chapter 14, I presented data indicating that the Peruvians,
who were descendants of the old Chimu culture on the coast of Peru,
used fish eggs liberally during the developmental period of girls in
order that they might perfect their physical preparation for the later
responsibility of motherhood. These fish eggs were an important part of
the nutrition of the women during their reproductive period. They were
available both at the coast market of Peru and as dried fish eggs in
the highland markets, whence they were obtained by the women in the
high Sierras to reinforce their fertility and efficiency for
childbearing. A chemical analysis of the dried fish eggs that I brought
to my laboratory from Alaska as well as of samples brought from other
places has revealed them to be a very rich source of body-building
minerals and vitamins. Here again, I have found no record of their use
in our modern civilization for reinforcing physical development and
maternal efficiency for reproduction. As I have noted in Chapter 15
special nutrition was provided for the fathers by tribes in the Amazon
jungle, as well as by the coastal tribes.</p>

<p>    Professor Drummond, a British bio-chemist, in discussing the
question of the modern decline in fertility, before the Royal Society
of Medicine <font size="-2">(4)</font> suggested that the decline in
the birth rate in European countries, during the last fifty years, was
due, largely, to the change in national diets which resulted from the
removal of vitamins B and E from grains when the embryo or germ was
removed in the milling process. He called attention to the fact that
the decline in the birth rate corresponded directly with the time when
the change was made in the milling process so that refined flour was
made available instead of the entire grain product.</p>

<p>    Of the many problems on which the experience of the primitive
races can throw light, probably none is more pressing than practical
procedures for improving child life. Since this has been shown to be
largely dependent upon the architectural design, as determined by the
health of the parental germ cells and by the prenatal environment of
the child, the program that is to be successful must begin early enough
to obviate these various disturbing forces. The normal determining
factors that are of hereditary origin may be interrupted in a given
generation but need not become fixed characteristics in the future
generations. This question of parental nutrition, accordingly,
constitutes a fundamental determining factor in the health and physical
perfection of the offspring.</p>

<p>    One of the frequent problems brought to my attention has to do
with the responsibility of young men and women in the matter of the
danger of transmitting their personal deformities to their offspring.
Many, indeed, with great reluctance and sense of personal loss decline
marriage because of this fear, a fear growing out of the current
teaching that their children will be marked as they have been.</p>

<p>    On the presumption that all mentally crippled individuals will
be in danger of transmitting these qualities to their offspring there
is a strong movement continually in operation toward segregating such
individuals or incapacitating them by sterilization. Several primitive
racial stocks have produced large populations without criminals and
defectives by means of an adequate nutritional program which provided
normal development and function. May it not be that even our
defectives, when they have resulted from poisoning of germ cells or
interference with an adequate normal intrauterine environment, may be
able to build a society with a high incidence of perfection, that will
progressively return toward Nature's ideal of human beings with normal
physical, mental and moral qualities? Because of its interpretation of
the individual's responsibility for his mental and moral qualities,
society has not only undertaken to protect itself from the acts of
so-called unsocial individuals but has proceeded to treat them as
though they were responsible for the injury that society has done to
them. Does it not seem inevitable that this apparently false attitude
will change if it be demonstrated that they are the result of a program
of inadequate nutrition for the parents.</p>

<p>    As we have seen, the children born in many of the families of
primitive racial stocks after the parents have adopted our modernized
dietary, may have marked changes in the facial and dental arch forms.
In our modernized white civilization this change occurs so frequently
that in a considerable percentage of the families there is seen a
progressive narrowing of the dental arches in the succeeding children
of the same family. Since the position of the permanent teeth which
erupt at from seven to twelve years of age, can be determined by x-rays
early in child life, this procedure provides an opportunity to
anticipate deformities that will make their appearance with the
eruption of the permanent teeth.</p>

<p>    In Fig. 131, may be seen the x-rays of the upper arches of three
children. Even under conditions causing the permanent teeth to develop
irregularly the deciduous dental arch will not show the deformity that
will be expressed later in the permanent dental arch. The abnormal
placement of the developing permanent teeth, however, will show the
deformity that is later to be produced in the face even though the
deciduous arch is normal in design. Both deciduous and permanent teeth
can be seen at the same time. In Fig. 131 it will be seen that there is
a progressive deformity revealed in the position of the permanent teeth
in these three children. (Most severe in the youngest.) This narrowing
of the curve made by the permanent teeth is a condition characteristic
of a large number of individuals, occurring in at least 25 per cent of
the families throughout the United States; in some districts the
percentage will reach 50 to 75 per cent.</p>

<p>    While the application of orthodontic procedures for the improve-
ment of the facial form and arrangement of the teeth will make a vast
improvement in facial expression, that procedure will not modify
disturbances in other parts of the body, such as the abnormal
underdevelopment of the hips and pelvic bones. If an improvement in
nutrition for the mothers-to-be is adequately provided in accordance
with the procedures of the primitives, it should be possible to prevent
this progressive lowering of the capacity of our modern women to
produce physically fit children.</p>

<p>    Fig. 133 is another illustration. The oldest child, ten years of
age, is shown at the upper left. She has a marked underdevelopment of
the width of the face and dental arches. The nostrils are abnormally
narrow and she tends to be a mouth breather. She is very nervous and is
becoming stooped. In the lower left photograph, is shown an x-ray of
the narrowed upper arch. At the right is shown her younger sister, six
years of age. It will be seen that the proportions of her face are much
more normal and that she breathes with complete ease through her nose.
She has none of the nervous trouble of her older sister. In the x-rays,
below, at the right, it will be seen that her permanent arch, as
indicated by the positions of the permanent teeth, although not so far
advanced as that of her sister, has good design. The history of these
pregnancies is of interest. The duration of labor for the first child
was fifty-three hours and for the second three hours. Following the
birth of the first child the mother was a partial invalid for several
months. Following that of the second child the experience of childbirth
made but slight impression on the strength and health of the mother.
During the first pregnancy no special effort was made to reinforce the
nutrition of the mother. During the second pregnancy the selection of
foods was made on the basis of nutrition of the successful primitives.
This included the use of milk, green vegetables, sea foods, organs of
animals and the reinforcement of the fat-soluble vitamins by very high
vitamin butter and high vitamin natural cod liver oil. It is a usual
experience that the difficulties of labor are greatly decreased and the
strength and vitality of the child enhanced where the mother has
adequately reinforced nutrition along these lines during the formative
period of the child.</p>

<p>    The problem of maternal responsibility with regard to the
physical capacity of their offspring to reproduce a healthy new
generation comprises one of the most serious problems confronting
modern degenerating society. In a previous chapter I have discussed the
difficulty that zoological garden directors have had in rearing members
of the cat family in captivity. It has been a very general experience
until the modern system of feeding animal organs was instituted, that
unless the mothers-to-be had themselves been born in the jungle the
lack of development of the pelvic arch would frequently prevent normal
birth of their young. In the Cleveland Zoo a very valuable tigress,
that had been born in captivity, found it impossible to give birth to
her young. Although a Caesarian operation was performed, she lost her
life. The young also died. One of the veterinaries told me that the
pelvic arch was entirely too small to allow the young to pass through
the birth canal. Studies of the facial bones of this animal showed
marked abnormality in development.</p>

<p>    The result of disturbance in the growth of the bones of the head
and of the development of general body design is quite regularly a
narrowing of the entire body, and often there is a definite
lengthening. Statistics have been published relative to the increase in
the height of girls in colleges during the last few decades. This is
probably a bad rather than a good sign as actually it is an expression
of this change in the shape of the body. I am informed by gynecologists
that narrowing of the pelvic arch is one of the factors that is
contributing to the increased difficulties that are encountered in
childbirth by our modern generation.</p>

<p>    A typical case illustrating the relationship between the lack of
pelvic development and deformity of the face, is presented in Fig. 134.
This girl presented a very marked underdevelopment of the lower third
of the face which produced the appcarance of protrusion of her upper
teeth so that it was quite difficult or impossible for her to cover
them with her lips. An operation to improve her appearance consisted in
removing the first bicuspid on each side above and then moving the bone
carrying the anterior teeth backward with appliances, the width of the
two removed teeth. This changed the relationship of the teeth as shown
in the two upper views in Fig. 134. The operation greatly improved her
facial appearance and she lost the inferiority complex which had
prevented her from mingling with young people. When she went to the
hospital for her first child, there was special concern because of her
weak heart, and every effort was made to obtain a normal birth rather
than one by Caesarian section. This proved impossible and the Caesarian
operation was done. Great difficulty was experienced in saving the life
of the mother and child. Her boyish figure, of which she had been so
proud, and which had been a part of her serious deformity, during her
formative period had nearly resulted in her undoing. She nursed her
baby for some time but the overdraft of reproduction on her frail body
was so great that she aged rapidly, her back weakened and she stooped
forward as shown in Fig. 134, lower right. In the view at the lower
left, it will be seen that the teeth remained in their new position. A
point to keep in mind is that her physical deficiency was probably
directly caused by an inadequate nutrition of her mother during the
intrauterine development and prior to conception. It is, of course,
possible that the father also contributed a poisoned germ cell that
constituted a disturbance in the architectural design of the offspring.
In this connection, it is important to have in mind the tragic
influence of a program of deliberate starvation of mothers-to-be in
order that the bones of the baby may be soft and thus provide an easy
birth. Some literature has been published indicating the foods that
would be efficient in accomplishing this. This means almost certain
wreckage or handicapping of the child's life.</p>

<p>    Information from many sources may suggest that the expectant
mother needs more calcium and more vitamin D. She may go to the
pharmacy with a prescription or on her own initiative obtain calcium
tablets and so-called vitamin D as a synthetic preparation. We are
concerned here with data which will throw light on the comparative
value of the treatment the modern mother will thus give herself with
that that the primitive mother would provide.</p>

<p>    Dr. Wayne Brehm who is associated with two Columbus, Ohio,
hospitals has recently published the results <font size="-2">(5)</font>
of a study of the effect of the treatment received in 540 obstetrical
cases divided into six groups of ninety individuals each, on the basis
on which their nutrition was reinforced in order to study the
comparative effects of the different treatments. The reinforcement of
the diet consisted in Group 1 of taking calcium and synthetic vitamin D
as viosterol; Group 2, calcium alone; Group 3, viosterol alone; Group
4, calcium and cod liver oil; Group 5, cod liver oil alone and Group 6,
no reinforcement. For those receiving the calcium and viosterol there
was extensive calcification in the placentae, marked closure of the
fontanelle (the normal opening in the top of the infant skull) and
marked calcification in the kidneys. For those receiving calcium alone
there was no placental calcification, slight closure of the fontanelle
and no calcification of the kidneys. Group 3 receiving viosterol had
moderate to marked placental calcification, moderate closure of the
fontanelle and no calcification of the kidneys. Those receiving cod
liver oil alone had very slight placental calcification, slight
fontanelle closure and no calcification in the kidneys. Those receiving
no reinforcement had very slight placental calcification, normal
fontanelle closures and no calcification of the kidneys. The effect on
the mother was a prolonging of labor in Group 1 and at birth the fetal
heads were less moulded not being able to adjust their shape to the
shape of the birth tube. These infants had a general appearance of
ossification or postmaturity. This strongly emphasizes the great
desirability of using Nature's natural foods instead of modern
synthetic substitutes.</p>

<p>    It is a matter of great importance that the most serious
disturbances in reproduction and childbirth are occurring in the most
civilized parts of the world. In Chapter 19 I have referred to the
important work of Dr. Kathleen Vaughan entitled "Safe Childbirth." She
has not only had wide experience among several tribes in India and in
the British Hospitals but has collected a large quantity of information
regarding the experience of many races throughout the world. Her data
strongly emphasize the necessity that the growing girl shall be allowed
to have an active outdoor life not only until the completion of the
building of her body at about fourteen years of age, but through the
child-bearing period. In practically all countries a restricted
sedentary indoor life greatly increases the complications associated
with childbirth. She quotes Whitridge Williams to the effect that: "At
the onset of pregnancy the (males) are 125 to 100 (females), and he
adds that sex is determined in the germ cells, primarily or immediately
after their union, and is immutable by the time segmentation of the
ovum begins." Notwithstanding this advantage, prenatal and infant
mortality reduces the proportion of boys to a level below that of
girls. Dr. Vaughan in her reference to the data on the annual report of
the chief medical officer, the Minister of Health, states as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    Our infant mortality returns show that over half
the number of infants dying before they are a year old die before they
have lived a month (and 6,744 of them before they are twenty-four hours
old), strongly suggesting that their vitality was impaired by the
process of birth. The figures of those who did not survive one month
are 20,060, and of these <i>more than half are males. So we lose over
ten thousand boys every year under a month old!</i> (Public Health
Report, No. 55, British). Hear what Dr. Peter McKinley has to say on
the subject. "The death rate of infants in the period immediately
subsequent to birth is nine times as high as that which occurs later in
the first years of life." He shows how the difficulty experienced by
the mothers during parturition leads to the death of infants at and
just after birth, and says in this connection, "Infant deaths under a
month are significantly associated with the death rates of mothers in
childbearing." He quotes Netherland statistics showing that of
stillbirths due to difficulty during birth, male stillbirths
predominate, and says, "These figures might be taken in support of the
view that the greater size of the male head is a cause of some greater
difficulty in labour than there is with a female birth." Here, indeed,
in civilized childbirth is the laboratory where the sex of the
population is finally determined-the actual births of boys and girls
are nearly equal in number, but the small ones slip through; the larger
children are the ones who are killed during birth, or so damaged that
life is heavily handicapped, and we are left with an enormous surplus
female population. This destruction of male infants, which goes on day
by day and year by year, puts the consequences of the Great War into
the shade. Our surplus female population (now reaching over one and a
half million in excess of the male) is directly due to it. We have no
need of Pharaoh's midwives to kill our boys off at birth (Exodus i.
16). Civilization does it unaided, for all civilized races as they pass
their zenith and are on the downgrade have eventually had to face the
same problem, the outnumbering of men by women, and most of them have
met it as the East does to-day by female infanticide. A more
intelligent policy would be to prevent the males dying at birth. We see
that difficult childbirth leads to a high maternal mortality, but it is
also the cause of a high infant mortality falling most heavily upon the
male infants, and it is also responsible for the production of mental
defectives in ever-increasing numbers.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    Dr. Vaughan's work places emphasis on the necessity that the
human body be properly built, especially that of the mother-to-be. She
shows clearly that the shape of the pelvis is determined by the method
of life and the nutrition. In all primitive tribes living an outdoor
life childbirth is easy and labor is of short duration. She shows that
this is associated with a round pelvis and that the distortion of the
pelvis to a flattened or kidney shape, even to a small degree, greatly
reduces the capacity and therefore the ease with which the infant head
may pass through the birth canal. In Dr. Vaughan's wide experience she
has observed two ways by which a rough estimate of the pelvic shape and
capacity may be anticipated: first, by the gait of the individual,
because the angle of the hips is determined by the shape of the pelvis;
and second, by the teeth and jaws. She has recognized an association
between facial and dental arch deformities and deformed pelvis.</p>

<p>    During my investigations in eastern Australia I was informed
that the birth rate among the whites had declined over a large area and
to such an extent that many families had no children and many women
could produce only one child. The diets used in that district were very
largely refined white-flour products, sugar, polished rice, vegetable
fats, canned goods and a limited amount of meat. The alarm regarding
the declining birth rate in Australia has recently been a matter of
discussion by the New South Wales legislature as indicated by an
Associated Press dispatch from Sydney, Australia, dated August 1, 1938:
"A 'stork derby' with sweepstakes prizes was proposed in the New South
Wales Legislature today to boost Australia's falling birth rate."</p>

<p>  A report just received from the Bureau of Home Economics,
Department of Agriculture, Washington, presents figures for the average
amount of the various foods used in different income groups in
different parts of the United States. These showed that in general
about one-third of the income up to $2500 was spent for food per
family; further, that the total flour equivalent ranged from 0.39 to
0.50 pound per capita per day. These quantities will furnish about 829
to 1063 calories per day, per capita. It will be seen at once that this
provides a large number of the calories required for growing children
and sedentary adults per day. With this number of calories derived from
refined flour products there is no adequate provision for a normal
amount of such body-building materials as minerals and vitamins. These
have been removed, largely, in the milling process, and are largely
denied to our modern civilization insofar as the cereal foods are
concerned. This includes vitamin E, so essential for the functioning of
the pituitary gland, the master governor of the body.</p>

<p>    One of the most important lessons we may learn from the
primitive cultures is the detail of their procedures for preventing
dental caries. Since I have devoted an entire chapter (Chapter 16) to
this I will make only a brief comment here. Simply stated, the
practical application of the primitive wisdom for accomplishing this
would involve returning to the use of natural foods which provide the
entire assortment of bodybuilding and repairing food factors. This
means the recognition of the fact that all forms of animal life are the
product of the food environments that have produced them. Therefore, we
cannot distort and rob the foods without serious injury. Nature has put
these foods up in packages containing the combinations of minerals and
other factors that are essential for nourishing the various organs.
Some of the simpler animal forms are able to synthesize in their bodies
some of the food elements which we humans also require, but cannot
create ourselves. Our modern process of robbing the natural foods for
convenience or gain completely thwarts Nature's inviolable program. I
have shown how the robbing of the wheat in the making of white flour
reduced the minerals and other chemicals in the grains, so as to make
them sources of energy without normal body-building and repairing
qualities. Our appetites have been distorted so that hunger appeals
only for energy with no conscious need for body-building and repairing
chemicals.</p>

<p>    A first requisite for the control of tooth decay is to have
provided an adequate intake of the body-building and repairing factors
by the time the hunger appeal for energy has been satisfied. A
sufficient variety of foods must be used to supply the body's demand
for those elements which it needs in large quantities, that is, calcium
and phosphorus, and the other elements which it needs in smaller
quantities, though just as imperatively. One of the serious human
deficiencies is the inability to synthesize certain of the activators
which include the known vitamins. This makes necessary the
reinforcement of the nutrition with definite amounts of special foods
to supply these organic catalysts, especially the fat-soluble
activators, including the known vitamins, which are particularly
difficult to provide in adequate quantities. I have shown that the
primitive races studied were dependent upon one of three sources for
some of these fat-soluble factors, namely, sea foods, organs of animals
or dairy products. These are all of animal origin. I have indicated in
Chapter 16 the nutritional programs that have proved in clinical
testing adequate for providing the body with nutrition that will not
only prevent tooth decay, but check it when it is active. The stress
periods of life, namely, active growth in children and motherhood, do
not constitute overloads among most of the primitive races because the
factor of safety provided by them in the selection of foods is
sufficiently high to protect them against all stresses. I have
indicated the type of nutrition that is especially needed for these
stress periods in our modern civilization. Also, that it is not
necessary to adopt the foods of any particular racial stock, but only
to make our nutrition adequate in all its nutritive factors to the
primitive nutritions. Tooth decay is not only unnecessary, but an
indication of our divergence from Nature's fundamental laws of life and
health. (See Chapter 16 for primitive menus.) The responsibility of our
modern processed foods of commerce as contributing factors in the cause
of tooth decay is strikingly demonstrated by the rapid development of
tooth decay among the growing children on the Pacific Islands during
the time trader ships made calls for dried copra when its price was
high for several months. This was paid for in 90 per cent white flour
and refined sugar and not over 10 per cent in cloth and clothing. When
the price of copra reduced from $400 a ton to $4 a ton, the trader
ships stopped calling and tooth decay stopped when the people went back
to their native diet. I saw many such individuals with teeth with open
cavities in which the tooth decay had ceased to be active.</p>

<p>    In undertaking to make practical application of primitive wisdom
to our modern problems, the field is so broad that only a limited
number of items may be included. It is important to emphasize the
difference between the procedures used in the preparation of boys and
girls for life in many of the primitive groups, and in our modern
social organization. Few people will realize the remarkable training
given the primitive children, with the fathers and mothers as tutors.
To illustrate, among the Indians of the far North in Canada near the
Arctic Circle, the girls rather than the boys select a companion for
life. This is done with the help of her parents. Before a boy is
considered worthy of consideration he must demonstrate that he can
build the winter cabin, provide the firewood for maintaining the home
of the parents, and all of the provisions of wild game, during the
trial period of several weeks. After an adequate demonstration of
bravery as well as of skill, in which the boy must kill a grizzly bear,
he is accepted into the home for a period of trial marriage. The girl
has the privilege of making her choice by trial, but when the choice is
made there is complete faithfulness on the part of both. Girls are
prepared for life's duties by being taught to make clothing, prepare
food, care for children and assist in the maintenance of the home. I
have seldom, if ever, seen such happy people as these forest Indians of
the far North.</p>

<p>    In Chapter 10, in discussing the Australian Aborigines, I have
similarly described the preparation of boys for the responsibility of
manhood. No modern college graduate has to win his spurs under more
exacting examinations and tests than do those boys.</p>

<p>    In Africa several specialties call for special training. The
medicine men spend several years under the training of a tutor. Each
boy must provide a specified number of cattle per year which are eaten
by the group.</p>

<p>    Probably the most indelible impression that is left by my
investigations among primitive races, is that which came from examining
1,276 skulls of the people who had been buried hundreds of years ago
along the Pacific Coast of Peru and in the high Andean Plateau, without
finding a single skull with the typical marked narrowing of the face
and dental arches, that afflicts a considerable proportion not only of
the residents in modernized districts in Peru, but in most of the
United States and many communities of Europe today. I know of no
problem so important to our modern civilization as the finding of the
reason for this, and the elimination of the cause of error. Perhaps few
will recognize the significance of this important point. This may be
the reason why the prospect is not encouraging.</p>

<p>    One of the important lessons we should learn from the primitive
races is that of the need for maintaining a balance beween soil
productivity, plant growth and human babies. Even in a country with so
low a fertility as obtains in the greater part of Australia, the
Aborigines for a very long period were able to maintain this balance.
Their system of birth control was very efficient and exacting.</p>

<p>    A survey made by a committee appointed by the League of Nations
indicates the need per capita of approximately one-half acre of land
for wheat, two acres for dairy products, and ten acres for beef
producing pasture for the supply of meat. When we realize that Ohio has
been occupied by our modern civilization for only one hundred fifty
years and that it is estimated that during that time approximately half
of the topsoil has been lost through water and wind erosion we realize
that Nature's accumulated vegetable enrichment has been greatly reduced
in this area within a short time from this one source alone. In Chapter
20 I have shown that there is only enough phosphorus in the top seven
inches of agricultural land for approximately fifty crops of high-yield
wheat or one hundred crops of moderate-yield. Other grains make similar
drafts upon the land. I have given data indicating a relationship
between progressive soil depletion and progressive increase in heart
disease.</p>

<p>    It is apparent that the present and past one or two generations
have taken more than their share of the minerals that were available in
the soil in most of the United States, and have done so without
returning them. Thus, they have handicapped, to a serious extent, the
succeeding generations, since it is so difficult to replenish the
minerals, and since it is practically impossible to accumulate another
layer of topsoil, in less than a period of many hundreds of years. This
constitutes, accordingly, one of the serious dilemmas, since human
beings are dependent upon soil for their animal and plant foods, for
body-building. The minerals are in turn dependent upon the nutritive
factors in the soil for establishing their quality. The vitamin and
protein content of plants has been shown to be directly related to
availability of soil minerals and other nutriments. A program that does
not include maintaining this balance between population and soil
productivity must inevitably lead to disastrous degeneration.
Over-population means strife and wars. The history of the rise and fall
of many of the past civilizations has recorded a progressive rise,
while civilizations were using the accumulated nutrition in the
topsoil, forest, shrubbery and grass, followed by a progressive
decline, while the same civilizations were reaping the results of the
destruction of these essential ultimate sources of life. Their cycle of
rise and degeneration are strikingly duplicated in our present American
culture.</p>

<p>    Various therapeutic measures in use today have come to us from
primitive peoples. One of the greatest scourges of the world is malaria
fever. Everywhere it has been fought successfully with quinine. Indeed,
many parts of the world would not have been tenantable for whites
without it. Yet few people realize that quinine was the gift of the
ancient Peruvian Indians.</p>

<p>    In Chapter 15 I presented data regarding the treatment used by
several primitive races for preventing and correcting serious
disturbances in the digestive tract. This consisted in the use of clay
or aluminum silicate which modern science has learned has the important
quality of being able to adsorb and thus collect toxic substances and
other products. Important new light is now thrown on the probable role
of this substance in the primitive diet and its possible application in
our modern problems of sensitization reactions or allergies. In the
first volume of my work on "Dental Infections," I presented data
relating toxic sensitization reactions to dental infections. These were
shown in both animals and human beings. I discussed the relation of
these reactions to histamine and emphasized their similarity to the
effect produced by inocculation with histamine. An important new
chapter has recently. been added to this problem by the work of Dr. C.
F. Code for which he has received an award by the American Association
for the Advancement of Science. He reported his findings before the
Association meeting at Richmond, Virginia, in December, 1938. Dr. Code
has apparently discovered that histamine is the actual product
responsible for the symptoms of the various allergies. Its excess
accumulation in the blood is the actual cause of the symptoms whether
expressed as asthma, hay fever or skin eruptions such as produced by
pollens, various foods, dust and other sensitizing agents. He has shown
that the eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, are the source of
excess histamine in the blood. It is accordingly indicated that the
primitive treatment by the use of kaolin, aluminum silicate, as an
adsorbent was used directly for controlling such symptoms. It is now
further indicated that this treatment can be helpful for the prevention
of modern allergies. Previous investigations have shown that histamine
is produced in the alimentary tract as a putrefaction product of
proteins by the action of certain micro-organisms of the colon
group.</p>

<p>    Modern science boasts the discovery of vitamin C, lack of which
took its toll of thousands of the white mariners through hundreds of
years with scurvy. The first recorded cure of that disease was made by
the Indians in Canada when the British soldiers were dying in large
numbers. The Indians taught them to use a tea made from the steeped
tips of the shoots of the spruce. When I was among the Indians of the
far north I asked a chief why the Indians did not get scurvy. He then
proceeded, as I have related in Chapter 15, to explain to me how the
Indians prevented scurvy by the use of special organs in the animals.
While it is true that we have come to associate the absence of vitamin
C as the causative factor in scurvy, we do not know how many other
affections may be due to its absence in adequate quantity in our foods.
Almost weekly, new diseases are being associated with vitamin
deficiencies in our modern dietaries.</p>

<p>   One of our modern tendencies is to select the foods we like,
particularly those that satisfy our hunger without our having to eat
much, and, another is to think in terms of the few known vitamins and
their effects. The primitive tendency seems to have been to provide an
adequate factor of safety for all emergencies by the selection of a
sufficient variety and quantity of the various natural foods to prevent
entirely most of our modern affections. Their success demonstrates that
their program is superior to ours. An important advance in modern
international relationships provides for exchange of professorships
and, thus, interchanges of wisdom. We have shown a most laudable and
sympathetic interest in carrying our culture to the remnants of these
primitive races. Would it not be fortunate to accept in exchange
lessons from their inherited knowledge? It may be not only our greatest
opportunity, but our best hope for stemming the tide of our progressive
breakdown and also for our return to harmony with Nature's laws, since
life in its fullness is Nature obeyed.</p>

<p>    As I have sojourned among members of primitive racial stocks in
several parts of the world, I have been deeply impressed with their
fine personalities, and strong characters. I have never felt the
slightest fear in being among them; I have never found that my trust in
them was misplaced. As soon as they had learned that I was visiting
them in their interest, their kindness and devotion was very
remarkable. Fundamentally they are spiritual and have a devout
reverence for an all-powerful, all-pervading power which not only
protects and provides for them, but accepts them as a part of that
great encompassing soul if they obey Nature's laws.</p>

<p>    Ernest Thompson Seton has beautifully expressed the spirit of
the Indian in the opening paragraph of his little book "The Gospel of
the Red Man":</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">    The culture and civilization of the White man
are essentially material; his measure of success is, "How much property
have I acquired for myself?" The culture of the Red man is
fundamentally spiritual; his measure of success is, "How much service
have I rendered to my people?"</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">   The civilization of the White man is a failure;
it is visibly crumbling around us. It has failed at every crucial test.
No one who measures things by results can question this fundamental
statement.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>    The faith of the primitive in the all-pervading power of which
he is a part includes a belief in immortality. He lives in communion
with the great unseen Spirit, of which he is a part, always in humility
and reverence. Elizabeth Odell in the following lines seems to express
the spirit of the primitives,</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Flat outstretched upon a mound<br>
 Of earth I lie; I press my ear<br>
 Against its surface and I hear<br>
 Far off and deep, the measured sound<br>
 Of heart that beats within the ground.<br>
 And with it pounds in harmony<br>
 The swift, familiar heart in me.<br>
 They pulse as one, together swell,<br>
 Together fall; I cannot tell<br>
 My sound from earth's, for I am part<br>
 Of rhythmic, universal heart.</p>
