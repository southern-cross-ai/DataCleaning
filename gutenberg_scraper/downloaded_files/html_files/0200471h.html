<h2>A SHORT HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA</h2>

<h3>BY</h3>

<h2>ERNEST SCOTT</h2>

<h3>PROFESSOR OF HISTORY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE</h3>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<p><a name="preface"></a></p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This Short History of Australia begins with a blank space on the
map, and ends with the record of a new name on the map, that of Anzac.
It endeavour to elucidate the way in which the country was discovered,
why and how it was settled, the development of civilized society within
it, its political and social progress, mode of government, and
relations, historical and actual, with the Empire of which it forms a
part.</p>

<p>The aim of the author has been to make the book answer such
questions as might reasonably be put to it by an intelligent reader,
who will of course have regard to the limitations imposed by its size;
and also to present a picture of the phases through which the country
has passed. At the same time it is hoped that due importance has been
given to personality. History is a record of the doings of men living
in communities, not of blind, nerveless forces.</p>

<p>In a book written to scale, on a carefully prepared plan, it was not
possible to deal more fully with some events about which various
readers might desire to have more information. On some of these the
author would have liked to write at greater length. The student who
works much at any section of history finds many aspects which require
more adequate treatment than they have yet received. In Australian
history there are large spaces which need closer study than has yet
been accorded to them. It is hoped that the bibliographical notes at
the end of the volume, brief though they be, will assist the reader,
whose thirst is not assuaged by what is to be found within these
covers, to go to the wells and draw for himself.</p>

<p>An excellent Australasian Atlas, published while this book was in
preparation, has been found useful by the author. Dr. J. G. Bartholomew
and Mr. K. R. Cramp, who have produced it, call it an Australasian
School Atlas [Note: The maps on pages 22, 79, 119, 221, and 230 are
copied from this atlas.](Oxford University Press, 1915); but the author
ventures to commend its series of beautiful historical maps (pp. 47-54)
to any reader of this History who desires to obtain in a convenient
form more geographical information than is afforded by the maps herein
engraved.</p>

<h2>A SHORT HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA</h2>

<p><a name="ch1"></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I - THE DAWN OF DISCOVERY</h3>

<blockquote><b>Early maps of the southern regions--Speculations as to
Antipodes-- Discovery of sea-route to the East Indies--Discovery of the
Pacific-- The Portuguese and Spaniards--Discovery of the Solomon
Islands--Quiros at the New Hebrides--Torres Strait.</b></blockquote>

<p>There was a period when maps of the world were published whereon the
part occupied by the continent of Australia was a blank space. On other
maps, dating from about the same time, land masses were represented
which we now know to have been imaginary. Let us look at four
examples.</p>

<p>The first is a map drawn by Robert Thorne in the reign of Henry VIII
(1527). He said in an apology for his work that 'it may seem rude,' and
so it was; but it serves the purpose of proving that Thorne and the
Spanish geographers from whom he derived his information knew nothing
about a continent near Australia. Sixty years later a map published at
Paris showed a portion of New Guinea, but still the place occupied by
Australia was left as open ocean. A Dutch map published at Amsterdam in
1594 did indeed indicate a large stretch of southern land, and called
it Terra Australis, but it bore no resemblance to the real continent
either in shape or situation. In 1595 a map by Hondius, a Dutchman
living in London, was published to illustrate the voyage of Francis
Drake round the globe. It represented New Guinea as an island,
approximately in its right position, though the shape of it was
defective. To the south of it, and divided from it by a strait,
appeared a large mass of land named Terra Australis. The outline is not
much like that of the continent of Australia, but it was apparently
copied from an earlier Dutch map by Ortelius (1587), upon which were
printed words in Latin stating that whether New Guinea was an island or
part of an austral continent was uncertain. Many other early maps could
be instanced, but these four will suffice to exhibit the defective
state of knowledge concerning this region at the end of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>By that time the belief had grown that there probably was a large
area of land in the southern hemisphere. Much earlier, in the Middle
Ages, some had seriously questioned whether there could possibly be
antipodes. Learned and ingenious men argued about it, for and against,
at considerable length; for it was much easier to write large folios in
Latin about the form of the earth than to go forth in ships and find
out. One famous cosmographer, Cosmas Indicopleustes, scoffed at the
very idea of there being countries inhabited by people who walked about
with their feet opposite to those of Europeans and their bodies (as he
imagined) hanging downwards, like flies on a ceiling. How, he asked,
could rain 'be said to "fall" or "descend," as in the Psalms and
Gospels, in those regions where it could only be said to come up?'
Consequently he declared ideas about antipodes to be nothing better
than 'old wives' fables.'</p>

<p>Another class of speculators maintained that there necessarily must
be antipodes, because the globe had to be equally poised on both sides
of its own centre. As there was a large mass of land, consisting of
Europe, Asia, northern Africa, and North America, on the one side of
the Equator, they argued that there had to be a balance of earth at the
opposite extremity.</p>

<p>To understand how speculation was set at rest and Australia came to
be discovered, it is necessary to bear in mind a few facts connected
with the expansion of European energy in maritime exploration, trade,
and colonization.</p>

<p>During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries a great and wonderful
series of events opened new sea-routes and fresh lands to the
enterprise of mankind. There was keen competition to secure the profits
arising from trade with the East--from the silk and cotton fabrics of
China and India, the spices, gold, jewels and metal work, the rice and
sugar, and many other things which European peoples were glad to
purchase and oriental lands could supply. This trade had in earlier
years come partly overland, along caravan routes to the Levant, partly
by water to the Red Sea, and then through Egypt to Alexandria. The
goods were collected by Venetians, Genoese, and other merchants,
chiefly Italians, in vessels plying in the Mediterranean, and sold to
European buyers. But the Portuguese discovered that by sailing round
Africa they could bring commodities from the East cheaper and safer
than by the old routes. They had made many voyages down the west coast
of Africa during the fifteenth century, until at last, in 1486,
Bartholomew Diaz steered his ships round the Cape of Good Hope, and in
1497 Vasco da Gama beat that record by conducting two vessels all the
way to India and back to Lisbon.</p>

<p>That was one important step towards the discovery of Australia--the
finding of the way to the East from Europe by sea.</p>

<p>It was for the purpose of discovering a still shorter route to the
east that Christopher Columbus, a Genoese in the service of Spain,
proposed to sail west. He argued that if the world were round, a ship
sailing west, straight towards the sunset, must come upon the shores of
further Asia. His reasoning was right, but there was one immense factor
which it was impossible for him to anticipate. He could not know that
the path to the East by the westward passage was blocked by the
continent of America. Columbus, indeed, never did realize that fact to
the day of his death. He never knew that he had found a new world. He
always believed that he had discovered what we may call the back door
of Asia.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, having possessed themselves of America through the
discoveries of Columbus and his successors, were still dissatisfied
when they realized that this new continent was not the Orient whence
their Portuguese rivals drew so rich a trade; and for many years they
searched for a strait through it or a way round it. When their
explorers crossed the narrow isthmus of Panama they saw before them an
ocean hitherto unknown to Europeans. This, then, was the sea which
Columbus had striven to reach when his track was barred by the American
continent. This was the sea which it was necessary to traverse to get
to the spice islands by the western route. Columbus was now dead, but
Spain had other gallant navigators in her service. One of them,
Ferdinand Magellan, in 1520, led the way down the east coast of South
America, through the narrow passage named after him, and into what he
for the first time called Mare Pacificum, the quiet sea.</p>

<p>That was the next important step towards the discovery of
Australia--the finding of the Pacific.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-03"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-03.jpg"></p>

<p>To realise the importance of these two series of discoveries, look
at a map showing the position of Australia in relation to South America
and South Africa, and remember that the main purpose of voyagers by
either route was to get as quickly and as safely as possible to the
parts with which there was rich trade to be done--to Ceylon, India,
China, Japan, Java, the Phillipines, and the Spice Islands. It will be
seen that neither the Portuguese sailing round the Cape into the Indian
Ocean, nor the Spaniards sailing round South America into the Pacific,
would be likely to see the coasts of Australia unless they were blown
very far out of their true course, or unless curiosity led them to
undertake extensive voyages of exploration. Taking the two sides of a
triangle to represent the two routes, Australia lay upon the centre of
the base line.</p>

<p>That several ships did, accidentally or in pursuit of geographical
knowledge, make a passing acquaintance with parts of Australia during
the sixteenth century is suggested by a few charts, though we do not
know the name of any navigator who did so.</p>

<p>A curious French map of which six copies are known to exist, dated
1542, presents an outline of a country lying south of Java and
inscribed 'Jave la Grande,' the great Java. On a copy which was
presented to King Henry VIII (by some one who came to England in the
suite of Anne of Cleves, it is conjectured), Java itself was marked by
way of distinction as 'the lytil Java,' or Java the small. It is
certain that the French map-maker worked from Portuguese information,
not from original observations of his own. Allowing for some defects,
the map makes it probable that at least one Portuguese ship had sailed
not only along the north-western coast of Australia, but also along the
east coast, from Cape York to the south of Tasmania, two centuries and
a half before the celebrated voyage of Captain Cook.</p>

<p>In 1598 Cornelius Wytfliet, in a book published at Louvain, wrote as
follows: 'The Australis Terra is the most southern of all lands, and is
separated from New Guinea by a narrow strait. Its shores are hitherto
but little known, since after one voyage and another that route has
been deserted, and seldom is the country visited unless sailors are
driven there by storms. The Australis Terra begins at two or three
degrees from the Equator, and is maintained by some to be of so great
an extent that if it were thoroughly explored it would be regarded as a
fifth part of the world.' Those from whom the Louvain geographer drew
his information seem to have had a correct knowledge of the division of
New Guinea by a strait from the land to the south of it, but they
imagined that the southern continent was far vaster than was actually
the case. The supposed Terra Australis of these old cosmographers was
indeed a continent stretching right round the South Pole.</p>

<p>The evidence concerning Australian discovery before the seventeenth
century is so clouded with doubt that it has been asserted to be
unworthy of credence. It has been argued that there is 'no foundation
beyond mere surmise and conjecture' for believing that any part of this
country was known to Europeans until the Dutch appeared upon the scene
in 1606. We certainly do not know the name of any sailor who made
discoveries prior to that date, nor of any ship in which they were
made. We have only a few rough charts, the statement of Cornelius
Wytfliet, and the persistence of a vague tradition. Yet this evidence,
unsatisfactory as it is, cannot be ignored. It is not unlikely that
Portuguese ships sailed along the west, north, and east of Australia,
and that persons on board made sketches of the coastline. There are
difficulties about accepting the map dated 1542 as a representation of
Australia. It brings the land called 'Jave la Grande' too near to the
island of Java, and it projects the most northerly tongue of that mass
between Java and Timor, whereas in fact there is no northern cape of
Australia within hundreds of miles of the gap between those islands.
But the man who drew the chart of the world of which this formed part
used materials obtained from sources unknown to us. He may have had to
piece together information from several rough seamen's charts. He may
have made mistakes in fitting the parts. We cannot tell. These early
intimations are</p>

<p>It may be thought that, if the Portuguese had really found a great
new land to the southward of the spice islands, they would be proud of
the achievement and would proclaim it to the world. But, on the
contrary, their policy was to conceal the whereabouts and the resources
of the countries which they discovered. They desired to secure for
their own profit the whole of the trade with the East. Especially were
they suspicious of the Spaniards, their neighbours in Europe, their
rivals in oversea empire. The Portuguese being the first to discover
the sea-route to the east round the Cape of Good Hope, and the
Spaniards being the first to discover the way to America across the
Atlantic, both realized that their interests would be bound to clash.
Where was to be the dividing line between their respective spheres of
operation? Pope Alexander VI settled their differences in 1493 by
appropriating to the Portuguese all the discoveries to the east of a
certain meridian, whilst the Spaniards were to take all that lay to the
westward of that line. A little later the two nations voluntarily
agreed to an amendment of the Pope's award, and fixed upon a meridian
370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands as the line separating their
two dominions.</p>

<p>But, while this line drawn through the Atlantic did very well before
the discovery of the Pacific Ocean, the agreement needed readjustment
after Magellan sailed out of the Atlantic into the Pacific. The
Moluccas were regarded as a very valuable possession on account of the
spices yielded by them. The Portuguese, who had discovered these
islands in 1512, contended that they were theirs. The Spaniards,
however, contended that the Moluccas were on the western side of the
line of partition; they were, urged the King of Spain, 'in his part of
those countries which pertained unto him according to the Pope's bull.'
Consequently there was 'great contention and strife between the
Spaniards and the Portugals about the spicery and division of the
Indies.' King John of Portugal, records a contemporary Spaniard, 'what
of stoutness of mind and what for grief, was puffed up with anger, as
were also the rest of the Portugals, storming as though they would have
plucked down the sky with their hands, not a little fearing lest they
should lose the trade of spices if the Spaniards should once put in
their foot.' After much dispute the King of Spain and the King of
Portugal each married the other's sister, 'whereat this matter waxed
cold.' The Portuguese kept the Moluccas and paid a sum of money to the
Spanish King for the dropping of his claim to them; whereat, says the
Spanish chronicler, 'some marvelled, others were sorry, and all held
their peace.' But the Spanish traders did not acknowledge that their
rights had been surrendered by this amicable financial and nuptial
bargain between the two kings, though it was for the moment expedient
for them to hold their peace.</p>

<p>In view of these disputes between the rivals as to the possession of
lands in the Pacific, and as the agreement of the kings did not imply
any principle of permanent settlement by the two nations concerning
this part of the globe, it was clearly in the interest of the
Portuguese, if they did discover Australia, to publish nothing about
it. The Spaniards would have had quite as good a claim to this country
as to the Moluccas, and would have insisted that the sum which the
Portuguese had paid on account of those islands by no means covered the
large country to the south. The dispute about the Moluccas was ended in
1529, and the map comprehending 'Jave la Grande' is dated 1542. If,
between those two dates, the Portuguese became aware of the existence
of a large area of new country, was there not good reason for their
suppressing what they knew? Indeed, no Portuguese map is known to exist
showing any country in the vicinity of Australia. The 1542 map is of
French origin. though the French had no navigators of their own on
voyages of this kind so early. How the French cartographer procured his
data we do not know; ingenious guesses have been made, but we cannot
depend upon them.</p>

<p>Apart from their jealousy of the Spaniards, the Portuguese pursued
the general policy of keeping secret their charts and sailing
directions. They did not want to have people of other nations
interfering in the trade of the Orient. A pilot or other person who
gave to a foreigner information concerning the route taken by
Portuguese ships on the voyage to the East Indies was liable to be
punished by being put to death. We cannot wonder, then, that the
history of Portuguese activity in Australasian waters is obscure.</p>

<p>Not until 1606 do we reach certain ground. In that year both Dutch
and Spanish vessels were voyaging within sight of the Australian coast;
and here at last we get in touch with people whom we know by name, and
with first-hand contemporary documentary evidence which we can read and
analyse.</p>

<p>The story of the Spanish voyage is this. The viceroys who were sent
out to govern the American possessions of that country were accustomed
to despatch expeditions to discover new lands. In 1567 an expedition
from Peru under the command of Alvaro de Mendana had discovered the
Solomon Islands, to the east of New Guinea. According to one account of
the voyage, Alvaro would appear to have thought that he had actually
discovered the Great Southern Continent of which men suspected the
existence. 'The greatest island that they discovered was according unto
the first finder called Guadalcanal, on the coast whereof they sailed
150 leagues before they could know whether it were an island or part of
the mainland; and yet they knew not perfectly what to make of it, but
think that it may be part of that continent which stretcheth to the
Straits of Magellan; for they coasted it to eighteen degrees and could
not find the end thereof. The gold that they found was upon this island
or mainland; but because the Spaniards understood not the language of
the country, and also for the Indians were very stout and fought
continuously against them, they could never learn from whence that gold
came, nor yet what store was in the land.'</p>

<p>Alvaro, named the group of islands the Solomons with the deliberate
purpose of alluring other Spaniards to settle there--'to the end that
the Spaniards, supposing them to be those isles from whence Solomon
fetched gold to adorn the temple at Jerusalem, might be the more
desirous to go and inhabit the same.' Alvaro, indeed, thought that it
would be advantageous to establish a Spanish colony at the Solomons; so
in 1595 he brought another expedition into the Pacific with that
purpose in view. On his second voyage he discovered the Marquesas
Island, but he could not now find the Solomons where he had been
twenty-eight years before. It was no uncommon circumstance in those
days for a navigator to lose his way at sea; and Alvaro had not been
sufficiently precise in his reckoning to know their exact whereabouts.
He died at Santa Cruz, a small group of islands south-east of the
Solomons, before he had rediscovered the object of his quest.</p>

<p>One of the officers on this second expedition of Alvaro was Pedro
Fernandez de Quiros. He was one of those Spaniards who believed that
there was a Great Southern Continent which, from the vicinity of the
Solomons, 'sretcheth to the Straits of Magellan.' The acquisition of
this continent would, he urged, be full of advantage for Spain. He laid
his case before King Philip III, and as a result was commissioned to
command three ships for the purpose of colonizing Santa Cruz and
searching for the continent.</p>

<p>On December 21, 1605, the expedition sailed from Callao in Peru. The
officer second in command was Luis de Torres. But Quiros was not able
to manage his crew. They were mutinous, and, as Torres tells us in his
relation of the voyage, 'made him turn from the course.' When the ships
reached the island of Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides, they parted
company. At midnight on June 11, Quiros's flagship, the ST. PETER AND
ST. PAUL, slipped out of harbour, 'and,' says Torres, 'although the
next morning we went out to seek for them and made all proper efforts,
it was not possible for us to find them, for they did not sail on the
proper course nor with good intention.' It is to be inferred from
Torres's language that Quiros's mutinous crew had compelled him to sail
back to Peru, leaving behind the two other ships, with Torres in
command of them.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-05"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-05.jpg"></p>

<p>What was he to do now that the leader of the expedition had
departed? Was he tamely to abandon the voyage, and steer back to
Callao? Torres resolved that he would not return until he had achieved
some amount of exploration. At this determination he arrived 'contrary
to the inclinations of many, I may say of the greater part'; but he
added, with a touch of pride in his own capacity for command, and also
with a spice of scorn for the failure of Quiros, 'my condition was
different from that of Captain Pedro Fernandez de Quiros.'</p>

<p>Torres, therefore, after satisfying himself that the land whereat
they had been lying was an island, and not a portion of a continent,
sailed till he fell in with the southern coast of New Guinea. Then for
two anxious months he threaded his way through the reefs and islands of
the intricate and dangerous strait which separates that country from
Australia. He sighted the hills of Cape York (which he took to be a
cluster of islands), made an acquaintance with the savage islanders of
the strait, and, emerging into the open sea, steered at length for the
Philippines, where he wrote an account of the voyage.</p>

<p>Quiros stoutly professed that he had discovered the Great Southern
Continent, and in 1610 a narrative of the voyage was published wherein
it was announced that 'all this region of the south as far as the Pole
' should be called 'Austrialia del Espiritu Santo.' The word
'Austrialia' was intended to pay a compliment to Philip III of Spain (a
Hapsburg sovereign, and as such a member of the House of Austria) as
well as to convey the meaning that this new land was a southern
continent. The word was chosen, says Quiros, 'from his Majesty's title
of Austria.' But Torres could have told him, and perhaps did, that he
had by no means discovered a continent, but merely an island of no very
large proportions. Quiros had never been within five hundred miles of
the real continent. Torres had seen it, but did not know that he
had.</p>

<p>But the dawn of discovery had now broken.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II - THE DUTCH AND NEW HOLLAND</h3>

<blockquote><b>Spain and the Netherlands--Cornelius Houtman's voyage to
the East Indies--The Dutch settled at Java--The <i>Duyfken</i> in the
Gulf of Carpentaria--Brouwer's new route to the Indies--Dirk Hartog in
Shark's Bay--Discovery of Nuytsland--Leeuwin's Land discovered--Wreck
of the English ship <i>Trial</i>--Tasman's voyages--New
Holland.</b></blockquote>

<p>The entrance of the Dutch into the East as explorers, colonists, and
merchants was connected with European events of very great importance.
The Reformation was principally an affair of churches and forms of
religious belief, but it also had far-reaching consequences touching
politics, commerce, and all the manifold interests of mankind. Its
influence extended throughout the known world, and led to the discovery
of regions hitherto unknown.</p>

<p>During the third quarter of the sixteenth century Philip II of Spain
was engaged in a bitter, bloody struggle with his subjects in the
Netherlands. Thousands of them broke away from the ancient Church of
which he was a devoted champion. Philip, loathing heresy, set himself
to 'exterminate the root and ground of this pest,' and his ruthless
Spanish soldiery carried out their master's injunctions with such
pitiless ferocity that their effort to crush the revolt stands as one
of the most awful phases of modern history. For over thirty years the
Spanish sword was wet with the blood of the people of the Netherlands.
In the southern provinces, Brabant and Flanders, Protestantism was
suppressed; but the north, Holland and Zealand successfully defied the
gloomy, conscientious fanatic who issued his edicts of persecution from
Madrid.</p>

<p>The Dutch people at the time of the revolt did the largest
sea-carrying trade in Europe. Their mercantile marine was numerous, and
was manned by bold and skilful sailors. A very considerable part of
their commerce consisted in fetching from Lisbon goods brought by the
Portuguese from the East, and distributing them throughout the
continent. It was a very profitable business, and it quite suited the
Dutch that the Portuguese should enjoy a monopoly in oriental trade as
long as they themselves kept the major part of the European carrying
trade. They grew rich and increased their shipping, and the growth of
their wealth and sea-power enabled them the better to defy Philip
II.</p>

<p>Failing, therefore, to subjugate the Dutch by sword and cannon,
Philip resolved to humble them by stifling their trade. In 1580 the
throne of Portugal had fallen vacant, and a Spanish army which crossed
the frontier had forced the Portuguese to accept Philip as king. For
sixty years to come--until the Portuguese regained their independence
in 1640--the gallant little country which had achieved such glorious
pre-eminence in commerce and discovery remained in 'captivity' to
Spain. The control thus secured by Philip over the colonies and the
shipping of Portugal enabled him to strike the desired blow at the
Dutch. In 1584 he commanded that Lisbon should be closed to their
ships. Barring against the heretic rebels the port whither came the
goods from which they had derived such abundant gains, he thought he
could chastise them for their disobedience by the ruin of their
commerce.</p>

<p>But Philip wholly underestimated the spirit and enterprise of the
Dutch people. They had baffled the best of his generals, beaten the
choicest of his troops, and captured his ships upon the sea. They were
now prepared to scorn his new menace by fetching direct the commodities
which they had hitherto obtained from Lisbon. First they tried to find
a new route to the East by a passage north of Europe, but were blocked
by the ice of the Arctic Sea. If they were to succeed they must force
their way into the trade by the Portuguese route in the teeth of
Spanish opposition.</p>

<p>Many Dutch sailors had served on Portuguese vessels. Though the
Portuguese tried to keep their sailing routes secret, and had never
published maps, they had often had to avail themselves of the services
of Dutch mariners; and these men knew the way. One of them, Cornelius
Houtman, had actually been a pilot in the oriental trade. Another
Dutchman, John Linschoten, had lived for fourteen years in the East
Indies, and upon his return published at Amsterdam (1595) a remarkable
book called ITINERARIO, wherein he told all he knew. Several Englishmen
had also wandered about the seas and lands of Asia, often having
painful experiences, and their adventures had been described in Richard
Hakluyt's PRINCIPAL NAVIGATIONS, VOYAGES, AND DISCOVERIES, published in
1589. So that in various ways the Dutch already knew more about the
Indies than King Philip supposed, and they were ready to act boldly in
putting their knowledge to practical uses.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-06"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-06.jpg"></p>

<p>A company of Amsterdam merchants fitted out a fleet of four ships,
placed them under Cornelius Houtman's direction, and sent them on a
voyage to the spice islands. They were over two years away, from April
1595 to July 1597, but they did great things for Holland. They were the
first Dutch ships to round the Cape of Good Hope and to visit
Madagascar, Goa, Java, and the Moluccas. Cornelius Houtman and his
brother Frederick were important pioneers of Dutch energy in the East.
We have the name of the latter on the map of Australia at Houtman's
Abrolhos, the long shoal off the west coast of the continent. Abrolhos,
in Portuguese, means literally 'open eyes,' and was given because this
was part of a coast where it was needful to keep a sharp look-out. The
use of the word by Dutchmen is in itself interesting, as indicating
that, in consequence of the service in which they acquired their
experience, the employment of a Portuguese sea-term seemed most
convenient to them.</p>

<p>Here, then, was another step on the way to the discovery of
Australia--the forcing of an entry into the eastern trade by the
Dutch.</p>

<p>Houtman having shown the road, others were quick to follow. Before
the end of the sixteenth century the Dutch had established themselves
at Java (1598) and seven companies had been formed to make profits from
the eastern trade. Fleet after fleet sailed forth from Holland. They
were well armed and efficiently manned; they were quite prepared to
fight their way against the Spaniards and the Portuguese. This they
successfully did, both in the East, where at Malacca in 1606 they
destroyed a fleet of their rivals, and in European waters, where at
Gibraltar Bay in 1607 a large Spanish fleet was annihilated by a small
Dutch squadron commanded by Jacob van Heemskerk. With wonderful
rapidity the new-comers supplanted the Portuguese as the principal
European power in eastern seas.</p>

<p>In the first half century of their activity a spirit of
investigation accompanied their commercial enterprise. They explored,
charted, and published. A series of most beautiful maps was produced by
Hollanders, adding to the world's geographical knowledge. Partly
accidentally, partly as the result of explorations, they pieced
together an outline of the northern, and western coasts of the
continent which lay to the south of the spice islands.</p>

<p>The first Dutch vessel known to have visited part of the Australian
coast was the <i>Duyfken</i> (i.e. the Little Dove), despatched to
examine the coasts and islands of New Guinea. This yacht, which was
commanded by Willem Jansz, was actually in Torres Strait in March 1606,
a few weeks before Torres sailed through it. But provisions ran short,
and nine of the crew were murdered by natives, who Were found to be
'wild, cruel, black savages'; so that the <i>Duyfken</i> did not
penetrate beyond Cape Keer-weer (i.e. Cape Turn-again), on the west
side of the Cape York Peninsula. Her captain returned in the belief
that the south coast of New Guinea was joined to the land along which
he coasted, and Dutch maps reproduced this error for many years to
come.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the west coast was gradually gained through a series
of accidents, happy and otherwise. Naturally, when the Dutch first
sailed into these seas they followed the route which the Portuguese had
always pursued. After rounding the Cape of Good Hope they ran along the
coast of Africa north-east as far as Madagascar, and then struck across
the Indian Ocean. But this route was painfully long. A ship would often
find herself becalmed for weeks together in the tropics. The heat was
intensely oppressive, the crews suffered severely from scurvy and
dysentery, and it was no uncommon circumstance for a ship to lose 60
per cent. of her people on the voyage. The cargo frequently
deteriorated, and the vessels became foul and gaping at the seams. A
voyage would sometimes last over a year; the minimum time was nine
months. An Englishman who visited the Portuguese settlements in 1584
noted that ships which missed the July monsoons were generally unable
to cross the Indian Ocean, but had to return to St. Helena; 'albeit,'
he recorded as a marvellous thing, 'in the year of our Lord 1580 there
arrived the ship called the LORENZO, being wonderful sore sea-beaten,
the eighth of October, which was accounted as a miracle for that the
like had not been seen before.' A route thus full of impediments to
safe and speedy navigation was so inconvenient that the Dutch realized
the importance of finding a better one. The Dutch map illustrating the
voyage of Van Neck's fleet in 1598-1600, indicates the route
followed.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-07"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-07.jpg"></p>

<p>In 1611 Hendrik Brouwer, a commander of marked ability who
subsequently became Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, made a
discovery. He found that if, after leaving the Cape, he steered due
east for about three thousand miles, and then set a course north for
Java, he had the benefit of favourable winds, which enabled him to
finish the voyage in much less time than the old route required.
Brouwer wrote to the directors of the Dutch East India Company pointing
out that he had sailed from Holland to Java in seven months, and
recommending that ships' captains should be instructed to take the same
course in future. The directors followed his advice; and from the year
1613 all Dutch commanders were under instructions to follow Brouwer's
route.</p>

<p>The bearing of this change on the discovery of the west coast of
Australia will be immediately apparent to any one who glances at a map
of the southern Indian Ocean. The distance from the Cape of Good Hope
to Cape Leeuwin is about 4,300 miles. A vessel running eastward with a
free wind, and anxious to make the most of it before changing her
course northward, would be very likely to sight the Australian
coast.</p>

<p>That is precisely what occurred to the ship EENDRAGT (i.e. Concord).
Her captain, Dirk Hartog, ran farther eastward than Brouwer had
advised, reaching Shark's Bay and landing on the island which to this
day bears his name. He erected there a post, and nailed to it a tin
plate upon which was engraved the record that on October 25, 1616, the
ship EENDRAGT from Amsterdam had arrived there, and had sailed for
Bantam on the 27th. Dirk Hartog's plate was found by Captain Vlaming,
of the Dutch ship GEELVINK, eighty years later. The post had decayed,
but the plate itself was 'unaffected by rain, air, or sun.' Vlaming
sent it to Amsterdam as an interesting memorial of discovery, and
erected another post and plate in place of it; and Vlaming's plate in
turn remained until 1817, when Captain Louis de Freycinet, the
commander of a French exploring expedition, took it away with him to
Paris.</p>

<p>Dirk Hartog's discovery was recognised by the seamen of his nation
as one which conduced to safer navigation. Brouwer's sailing direction
had left it indefinite at what point the turn northward should be
commenced. But now there was a landmark, and amended instructions were
issued to Dutch mariners that they should sail from the Cape between
the latitudes of thirty and forty degrees for about four thousand miles
until the 'New Southland of the EENDRAGT' was sighted. 'The land of the
EENDRAGT' --'T'Landt van de EENDRAGT'--that was the first name given by
the Dutch to this country; and it so appears upon several early maps of
the world published at Amsterdam.</p>

<p>In this way the western coasts of Australia were brought within
sight of the regular sailing track of vessels from Europe; and as soon
as that occurred the finding of other portions of the coast was only a
matter of time. Of course all the captains did not reach the coast at
the same spot. Violent winds would sometimes blow a vessel hundreds of
miles out of her planned course. Both going to and coming from the East
Indies ships would discover fresh pieces of coastline in quite a chance
manner. Thus, De Wit sailing homeward from Batavia in 1628 in the
VYANEN was by headwinds driven aground upon the north-west coast, and
had to throw overboard a quantity of pepper and copper, 'upon which
through God's mercy she got off again without further damage.' That bit
of coast was named 'De Wit's Land.' In 1627 the GULDEN SEEPAART, having
'on board a' high official, Pieter Nuyts, discovered a portion of the
southern coast, as far as the islands of St. Peter and St. Francis at
the head of the Great Australian Bight, from the southwest corner,
which was already named Leeuwin's Land because a ship of that name
(LEEUWIN, meaning the Lioness) discovered that particular portion in
1623.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-08"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-08.jpg"></p>

<p>It was during the same period that the first English ship of which
there is any record in connection with Australia appeared off the coast
and met with disaster. Upon a Dutch chart of 1627 is marked a reef
north-west of Dirk Hartog's Island, with the information that the
English ship <i>Trial</i> was wrecked there in 1622. ('Hier ist Engels
Schip de <i>Trial</i> vergaen in Junius 1, 1622.') She must have been a
vessel of good size, since she carried a company of 133. Forty-six of
them were saved in boats which made their way to Batavia, where their
arrival on July 5 was reported by the Dutch Governor-General to the
managers of the East India Company. 'The said ship <i>Trial</i>,' said
the report, 'ran on these rocks in the night time in fine weather,
without having seen land, and the heavy swells caused the ship to run
aground directly, so that it got filled with water. The forty-six
persons afore-mentioned put off from her in the greatest disorder with
the boat and pinnace each separately, leaving ninety-seven persons in
the ship, whose fate is known to God alone.' That was the unfortunate
commencement of the acquaintance of the English with Australia--nearly
a century and a half before Captain Cook sailed along the east
coast.</p>

<p>In the history of Australian discovery the name of one Dutch
navigator stands pre-eminent. It is that of Abel Tasman Born in 1603,
in a little village whose lush pastures were sheltered behind the dykes
of Friesland, he grew up whilst the Hollanders were achieving their
well-earned victory over the detested Spaniards. His countrymen were
firmly established in the East Indies when he first saw the light; and
the Company's service offered excellent opportunities to a
well-trained, intelligent young sailor such as he became. Tasman's rise
was very speedy. Commencing as an ordinary seaman, within two years he
had become the captain of a vessel. There were no more capable men
afloat at this time than were the Dutch, and the sharp merchants who
directed the East India Company's affairs would not have entrusted one
of their ships to any but a first-class navigator. From the rapidity of
Tasman's promotion and the special class of work for which he was
selected in the East, we may safely infer that he stood out as a keen,
bold, trustworthy, and vigorous-minded commander.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-09"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-09.jpg"></p>

<p>It was fortunate for the fame of Tasman that during his career in
the Indies the direction of the government there was in the hands of
Anthony van Diemen. This most distinguished of the Dutch
Governor-Generals attained office in 1636, and held it till 1645. He
ruled not only with a desire to promote the strength and profit of the
Netherlands in the East, but also with the keenest anxiety to find out
what was to be known about the undiscovered lands of the South Seas.
The instructions which he issued to the officers whom he employed in
this service were marked by ripe wisdom, shrewd business instincts, and
a discerning application of such knowledge, as had been accumulated by
previous investigators. He enjoined 'great circumspection' in the
treatment of natives. 'Slight misdemeanours on the part of such
natives, such as petty thefts and the like, you will pass unnoticed,
that by doing so you may draw them unto you, and not inspire them with
aversion to our nation. Whoever aspires to discover unknown lands and
tribes had need to be patient and long-suffering, noways quick to fly
out, but always bent on ingratiating himself.' At the same time he did
not forget that the managers of the company in Holland looked to him to
do more than expand the boundaries of human knowledge. They were
commercial people, whose main concern was to make profit. So Van Diemen
directed that, if gold and silver were found, and the natives did not
understand the value of them, they were to be kept ignorant. 'Appear as
if you were not greedy for them, and if gold or silver is offered in
any barter you must feign that you do not value those metals, showing
them copper, zinc, and lead, as if those metals were of more value with
us.'</p>

<p>By 1642, when Tasman was commissioned to command the first voyage of
exploration, he had already had nearly ten years of service in the
East, and had rendered distinguished service to his nation there. Van
Diemen placed two ships under his command, the HEEMSKERK and the
ZEEHAEN, and sent with him as pilot Franz Visscher, an experienced
officer, who drew up the plan of the voyage. The object of it was to
explore with the hope of opening up fresh avenues for trade and of
finding a more convenient route to South America, where the Dutch were
aiming at the extension of their commerce in defiance of Spain. Sailing
from Batavia on August 14, 1642, Tasman's ships made a wide circuit in
the Indian Ocean, touching at Mauritius, and then running southward
until they encountered tempestuous weather. They reached the high
latitude of 49 degrees, when, upon Visscher's advice, Tasman decided to
move back again into warmer seas. In latitude 42 they scudded along
before westerly gales until, on November 24, the look-out man gave
warning of land ahead. They wore, in fact, within sight of the country
which its discoverer named Van Diemen's Land, and which now bears the
name of Tasman himself. His landfall is believed to have been near the
entrance of Macquarie Harbour, on the west coast of the island, within
sight of the two mountains which Flinders in 1798 named, after Tasman's
ships, Mounts Heemskerk and Zeehaen.</p>

<p>Coasting round the south of the island, Tasman planted the flag of
Prince Frederick Henry, the Standtholder of the Netherlands, as a
symbol of taking possession; and on December 4 he sailed east. Nine
days later he sighted the west coast of the south island of New Zealand
and anchored in Massacre Bay--so called because three of his crew were
killed there by Maoris. 'This is the second land we have discovered,'
recorded Tasman in his journal; 'it appears to be a very fine country.'
His name for it was Staten Land, in honour of the States-General of
Holland. To the sea between Van Diemen's Land and New Zealand the
discoverer gave the name of Abel Tasman's Passage, in the erroneous
belief that New Zealand was part of the Great Southern Continent--the
mysterious Terra Australis Incognita--and that this stretch of ocean
was simply a strait between it and New Holland. In recent years the
British Admiralty has, very appropriately, upon its charts, adopted the
name of Tasman Sea for the waters between Australia and New
Zealand.</p>

<p>After leaving New Zealand Tasman sailed into the Pacific, calling at
the Friendly Islands, and thence made his way home round by the north
coast of New Guinea, reaching Batavia on June 15, 1643, after a voyage
of ten months, in which he had achieved discoveries of capital
importance. In a second voyage of 1644 Tasman set out to find a passage
between New Guinea and the land to the southward of it, which the Dutch
now fully understood to be of vast extent. They did not of course know
that Torres had actually been through the passage thirty-eight years
before: that was a fact of which they could not be aware. If Tasman
could find a strait he was to sail through it, and travel as far as Van
Diemen's Land, thence making for the islands of St. Peter and St.
Francis, and returning to Batavia by the coast of the Land of the
EENDRAGT. It is evident that if Tasman had accomplished this task, he
would have demonstrated Australia to be an island continent, and the
whole mystery about Terra Australis would have been cleared up. But for
reasons which are not apparent (the journals of Tasman's 1644 voyage
are not extant, so that we do not know what his difficulties were), he
did not find the passage, and returned to Batavia in August without
penetrating to the Pacific by that route. He probably gave the name
Carpentaria to the land which he concluded was joined to New Guinea,
thus honouring a former Governor-General, Pieter Carpenter
(1622-8).</p>

<p>After Tasman's voyages the Dutch commenced to use the name New
Holland for the land which they believed to comprehend Van Diemen's
Land and the entire region north of De Wit's Land; though they had
never been upon the east coast.</p>

<p>The great period of Dutch exploration in Australasia ended with
Tasman and Van Diemen. There are no names to compare with theirs for
breadth of scope and splendour of accomplishment. But a very great
piece of work had been done. The Dutch had, by accidental discoveries
and by planned investigations, gained a knowledge of the coastline of
Australia from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the Bight, and had added New
Zealand and Van Diemen's Land to the sphere. The map as Tasman left it
in 1644 remained practically unaltered until after Cook's voyage of
1770.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III - DAMPIER AND COOK</h3>

<blockquote><b>Cessation of Dutch explorations--Policy of Dutch East
India Company-- Dampier's first voyage to Australia in the
<i>Cygnet</i>--His voyage in the <i>Roebuck</i>--Cook's
voyages--Discovery of New South Wales--Botany Bay--Voyage of the
<i>Resolution</i>--Popularity of Cook's
<i>Voyages</i>.</b></blockquote>

<p>The Dutch having achieved so much, how was it that they did not
complete the discovery of the whole of Australia? Why did the spirit of
investigation which had animated Van Diemen flicker out when he was no
more? The great Governor-General died in 1645, the year after Tasman's
second voyage. The explorer himself lived on till 1659, but he was not
again employed in discovery work, nor did he live to see his own
brilliant exploits eclipsed by others of his nation.</p>

<p>The answer is that further voyages of discovery were discouraged by
the managers of the East India Company, because they were expensive and
did not produce immediate profits. Though the Dutch nation stood at the
back of the Company, and though its managers and principal officers
were appointed by the Government of the Netherlands, these managers
themselves were commercial men. 'Merchants being at the helm,
merchandise was accounted a matter of State,' wrote a contemporary.</p>

<p>Indeed, had Van Diemen lived a few months longer, he would have
received a letter from the managers administering to him a chilling
rebuke for the expense he had already incurred. Voyages to discover new
lands did not increase the Company's profits. They cost money, and
brought in no return. Van Diemen had hoped to pay for them by
discoveries of gold and silver. There was plenty of both in New
Holland, Van Diemen's Land, and New Zealand--mountains of silver and
shimmering masses of gold, more than Solomon, Croesus, the Pharaohs,
and the Grand Mogul together had ever dreamt of. But it had to be
found; it was not lying among the pebbles on the beaches; and the black
and painted savages who inhabited these countries knew nothing about
it. They were not people with whom profitable business could be done.
They were too low down in the scale of civilization even for barter.
Why, then, bother about these remote and unremunerative countries?
asked the commercial gentlemen in Amsterdam. There was sure profit, and
plenty of it, to be made out of the nutmegs of Amboyna, the cloves of
Ceylon, the rice of India, the pepper of the Moluccas, the cinnamon of
Java, the silks of China, and all the other rich merchandise of the
abounding East. Discovery was all very well, but it yielded simply
nothing per cent.</p>

<p>Van Diemen would perhaps have been very angry--certainly he would
have been sorry--if he had read the letter which came from the managers
shortly after they received the news of Tasman's voyage of 1644; but he
was dead before it reached Java, and was spared the knowledge of this
official censure. 'We see that your worships have again taken up the
further exploration of the coast of New Guinea in the hopes of
discovering silver and gold mines there,' wrote the Company. 'We do not
expect great things of the continuance of such explorations, which more
and more burden the Company's resources, since they require increase of
ships and sailors. Enough has been discovered for the Company to carry
on trade provided the latter be attended with success. We do not
consider it part of our task to seek out gold and silver mines for the
Company, and, having found such, try and derive profit from the same,
such things involve a good deal more, demanding excessive expenditure
and large numbers of hands. These plans of your worships somewhat aim
beyond our mark. The gold and silver mines that will best serve the
Company's turn have already been found, which we deem to be our trade
over the whole of India.'</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that some of the choice and ardent spirits
among the Hollanders, in Europe as well as in the East, deeply
regretted this relinquishment of all effort that did not bring in gain.
Witsen, the principal director of the Company at the end of the
seventeenth century, said in a letter: 'It is money only, not learned
knowledge, that our people go out to seek over there, the which is
sorely to be regretted.' But he and his like could not change the
general disposition of his colleagues and countrymen. For the Dutch,
henceforth, New Holland was simply a land which they sighted in
voyaging to and from the East Indies. The vast coastline may have
excited their curiosity, but did not prompt them to investigate the
resources of the country. They never saw the coasts which were most
inviting in appearance, those of the south and the east. They only
looked upon the west and the north, and carried away impressions of
sterility.</p>

<p>In 1688, while King James II was still reigning in England, the
shores of Australia received a visit from a company of buccaneers who
included an Englishman with a talent for picturesque writing and an
inborn love of adventure--William Dampier. He and his companions on the
<i>Cygnet</i> (Captain Swan) had been pursuing a career of sheer piracy
in the China seas. They had stolen the very ship in which they sailed,
and had committed such offences as would have justified the Spaniards,
if they had been caught, in giving each of them sufficient rope with a
noose at the end of it, and sufficient yard-arm accommodation, to end
their most nefarious courses. But it would have been a pity if Dampier
had met with that fate, since it would have deprived posterity of a
very delightful book of travels. There were quite good reasons why the
<i>Cygnet</i> should for a while get out of the way of ships which
might be looking for her; so her company determined to sail to the
quiet region of New Holland, 'to see what that country would afford
us.'</p>

<p>Dampier's experience of Australia was not considerable on this
voyage. The ship dropped anchor on the northwestern shore, somewhere
near Melville Island, and stayed there for some weeks to enable her to
be careened. His picturesque pen gives a lively account of the natives
whom he and his companions encountered. It was found to be impossible
to 'allure them with toys to a commerce,' nor had they any kind of
provisions to supply. There was no valuable plunder to be had here, and
the pirates were glad to get away after cleaning the ship, mending the
sails, and taking aboard fresh water. Dampier, even on this expedition,
showed himself many degrees superior to his companions. He was ever an
inquirer, and the making of maps and drawings had a continual
fascination for him. 'I drew a draft of this land,' he tells us; but he
lost it with other papers when a boat was capsized later.</p>

<p>A very strange mistake was made by Dampier about the name of the
Land of The Eendragt, which he found upon Dutch charts. As we have
seen, the name was that of a ship. But Dampier, in common with most
seamen of his period, believed the legends which were current as to
there being coasts of lodestone which mysteriously drew ships towards
them. In his first volume of VOYAGES, therefore, Dampier referred to
the fact that 'the Dutch call part of this coast the land of the
indraught,' because it 'magically drew ships too fast to it.'</p>

<p>The importance of this first acquaintance of Dampier with Australia
lay in the schemes which he evolved as the result of it. When he
returned to England he published an account of his travels, which
evoked a large amount of interest, and made him a person of some
consequence. Leading men of affairs were glad to converse with him, and
he used his opportunities to promote a voyage of discovery to New
Holland under his own command. He had influential patrons, the
Admiralty were convinced that there was advantage in the project, and
in 1699 the ship <i>Roebuck</i> was placed at his disposal for the
purpose.</p>

<p>In this vessel Dampier made his second and more extensive
acquaintance with Australia. Had he carried out his original intention
of approaching the country by the route round the Horn and through the
Pacific, he would have discovered the east coast, and the importance of
the <i>Roebuck</i>'S voyage would have been enormously increased. But
Dampier himself dreaded the cold of the Horn passage--he had been
accustomed to warm seas--and his crew grumbled about having to sail
that way. So he chose the route round the Cape of Good Hope, which
brought him on to the western coasts of the continent, where the Dutch
had been before him.</p>

<p>He made land on August 6 at Shark's Bay, which he so named because
his men caught and ate shark there and they took care that no waste
should be made, but thought it, as things stood, good entertainment.'
The description which Dampier gave in the book published after his
return was the best account of New Holland made available up to his
time. True, he did not find the country in any way attractive. 'If it
were not for that sort of pleasure which results from the discovery
even of the barrenest spot upon the globe, this coast of New Holland
would not have charmed me much.' The natives were utterly repellent.
They were black, ugly, fly-blown, blinking creatures, the most
unpleasing human beings he had ever encountered, 'though I have seen a
great variety of savages.'</p>

<p>Dampier was four months on the west and north-west coasts, which he
traversed for a thousand miles, but he did not see anything
encouraging. Then, 'it being the height of the dry season, and my men
growing scorbutic for want of refreshments, so that I had little
encouragement to search further, I resolved to leave this coast.' The
end of the voyage was unfortunate, for the ship, a thoroughly rotten
old craft, was wrecked on the way home, and the commander had nothing
to report to the Admiralty that was likely to induce the making of
colonisation experiments in Australia.</p>

<p>After Dampier, Australia remained in obscurity for nearly three
quarters of a century. The Dutch had no use for it, and the English
betrayed no more than a languid curiosity concerning it. A few
romancers allowed their imagination to weave fantastic fables about it.
The best-known example is that of Swift, who printed a map with
GULLIVER'S TRAVELS showing the position of Lilliput where Gulliver was
wrecked, corresponding precisely with the south-west coast of
Australia. Swift copied his map from Dampier, and makes Gulliver say
that he was a cousin of that adventurous buccaneer.</p>

<p>The veil is lifted again by the appearance in these seas of one of
the great navigators of history, James Cook.</p>

<p>In the year 1769 there would occur an astronomical event of which
the Royal Society of London desired that careful observation should be
made. The orbit of the planet Venus would cross the face of the sun,
and the phenomenon could be watched in particularly favourable
circumstances in the south seas. The Society therefore requested the
Admiralty to furnish a ship to go south, equipped with trained
observers and instruments, to watch this interesting transit of Venus.
The request was granted, a collier called the EARL OF PEMBROKE, 370
tons, was bought for 2,800 pounds, she was renamed the <i>Endeavour</i>
BARK, and was re-fitted for the special service for which she was
commissioned.</p>

<p>James Cook, who was selected to command the expedition, had already
won the confidence of the Admiralty by some excellent charting work
which he had done in the St. Lawrence, at Newfoundland, and at
Labrador. His rank in the Navy when he made this famous voyage was
lieutenant, though he will always be known as Captain Cook; and the
vessel was officially entered as the <i>Endeavour</i> BARK to
distinguish her from another ship of the Navy called the
<i>Endeavour</i>, though history knows but one of that name. The voyage
evoked unusual interest; the poet Goldsmith referred to it in the
prologue to a play:</p>

<pre>
     In these bold times when Learning's sons explore
     The distant climate and the savage shore;
     When wise astronomers to India steer,
     And quit for Venus many a brighter here.

<p>Cook's instructions directed him to sail to Tahiti, in the Pacific,
to enable the transit of Venus to be observed, and then 'to prosecute
the design of making discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean by
proceeding to the south as far as the latitude of 40 degrees.' That
meant that he was to search for the supposed Terra Australis Incognita,
the great continent which some believed to extend round the pole. If he
found no land there, he was to sail to New Zealand, explore it, and
then return to England 'by such route as I should think proper.' So
that he was not expressly instructed to explore New Holland. He was
given a free hand to make such investigations as might seem to him to
be advantageous, after completing the specified programme.</p>

<p>The voyage commenced on August 26, 1768, and the transit of Venus
was successfully observed on June 1, 1769. It is from that point that
Cook's movements become historically interesting. He ran south to look
for the supposed continent, but, finding no land, made for New Zealand,
where he remained, charting and exploring, for nearly six months. Cook
demonstrated that that country consisted of two large islands, divided
by a strait, and he charted the whole of it, doing this work so well,
despite the difficulty of surveying a rough coast from a ship like the
<i>Endeavour</i>, that a later French navigator, passing along the
coast with Cook's chart in hand, confessed that 'I found it of an
exactitude and of a thoroughness of detail which astonished me beyond
all power of expression.' His circumnavigation of both islands
demolished the theory which many had entertained before his time, that
the land discovered by Tasman would be found to be a fragment of a
great antarctic continent.</p>

<p>After leaving New Zealand, on March 31, 1770, Cook decided to sail
for the east coast of New Holland, that east coast which the Dutch had
never explored, and which was not laid down upon any mariner's chart.
Cook knew that there was original work to do there. Obviously, as the
west coast of New Holland had been so well known to navigators from the
Netherlands, there must be an east coast also. Cook was certainly
unaware of the existence of any maps suggesting the possibility that
the Portuguese had been upon this coast more than two centuries before.
Nor is it true that his discovery was a happy accident, as has
sometimes been represented. His own words prove that his purpose was
deliberately shaped. He resolved to sail westward from New Zealand
'until we fall in with the east coast of New Holland, and then to
follow the direction of that coast to the northward, or what other
direction it might take us, until we arrive at its northern extremity.'
The plan could hardly have been laid down in clearer terms.</p>

<p>At six o'clock in the morning on Thursday, April 20, Lieutenant
Hicks, who was on watch, sighted the coast of New Holland. The date
given in Cook's log and journal is April 19, but it must be remembered
that, Australia having been approached by sailing west from Europe,
round Cape Horn, ship's time was out of relation to Greenwich time, and
Cook had not so far made a correction. He did not correct his time till
he arrived at Batavia. Moreover, he dated events in the nautical manner
of reckoning, and the nautical day began at noon. The date given in his
log is therefore a day behind the civil calendar,</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-10"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-10.jpg"></p>

<p>There is also some doubt about the exact locality of Cook's
Australian landfall. He named the 'southernmost point of land we had in
sight,' Point Hicks, because 'Lieutenant Hicks was the first who
discovered this country.' But unfortunately Cook stated the latitude
and longitude of his Point Hicks incorrectly. He wrote that he 'judged'
the point to be where as a matter of fact there is no land at all, but
only open ocean. We have therefore to infer what Cook's Point Hicks was
from his descriptive words. The 'southernmost point' in sight of the
<i>Endeavour</i> at the time was that which figures on Admiralty charts
as Cape Everard.</p>

<p>Rounding Cape Howe, the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed north along the east
coast, and on Sunday, April 30 (April 29 by Cook's log) anchored in
Botany Bay at three o'clock in the afternoon. There was a tradition in
Cook's family that the first to land was his wife's cousin, Isaac
Smith, who sailed as a midshipman. The lad went in the boat from the
ship to the shore, and as the prow ran up the beach, Cook said, 'Now
then, Isaac, you go first.' The name originally given to the place was
Stingray Harbour, but afterwards, in consequence of the number of new
plants collected by the botanists, it was called Botany Bay; and it
appears under that name in Cook's charts. Joseph Banks, who, with the
professional botanist Solander, was responsible for these collections,
recorded that they were 'immensely large,' and they evoked so much
interest in Europe that the great Swedish botanist Linnaeus wrote that
'the new-found country ought to be called Banksia.' A stay of a week
was made in the harbour. The ship then continued her voyage northward,
past the entrance to Port Jackson (which was marked down and named
after George Jackson, an Admiralty official), and so on for nearly four
months of difficult navigation along a totally unknown coast which Cook
was confident no European had ever seen before.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-11"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-11.jpg"></p>

<p>Cook did not claim that he accomplished a feat of discovery when he
took his ship through Endeavour Strait. The authentic record of Torres'
voyage was found in the Spanish archives at Manilla in 1762; but,
though Cook had not seen a translation of it at this time, he knew that
the matter of the separation of New Guinea was by many regarded as
uncertain. So he cautiously wrote that 'as I believe it was known
before, but not publicly, I claim no other merit than the clearing up
of a doubtful point.' After threading his way through the labyrinth of
reefs and islands, and getting into safe water, Cook landed at
Possession Island on August 23 (by the log August 22), and 'took
possession of the whole eastern coast by the name of New Wales,' or, as
he wrote in a letter and in two copies of his journal, 'New South
Wales.'</p>

<p>During his next voyage in the <i>Resolution</i> (1772-4) Cook paid
another visit to New Zealand, but did not on this occasion approach the
coast of Australia. He was inclined to settle the question whether Van
Diemen's Land was an island or part of the mainland. But he was
deterred from so doing by the advice of Furneaux, the commander of the
ADVENTURE, which accompanied him on this voyage. Furneaux had become
separated from the <i>Resolution</i> during rough weather, and, in
making for Queen Charlotte's Sound, New Zealand, which had been fixed
upon as a rendezvous, had actually sailed in the eastern entrance of
the strait which divides Australia from Tasmania. But he reported his
conviction that New Holland was not divided at that point, and Cook,
believing him, was deprived of the honour of discovering the southern
coasts of Australia, as he would undoubtedly have done had he acted on
his own impulse.</p>

<p>The VOYAGES OF CAPTAIN COOK were the most popular books of the kind
ever published up to his time. The freshness of the scenes described,
the wonder of the discoveries made, the fulness and clearness of
observation displayed, the vital and attractive personality revealed by
the writings, made the volumes delightful for youthful and mature minds
alike. They were translated into many languages. Kings and cabin-boys
came under their spell. Louis XVI of France and Napoleon the Great read
them, in common with poor lads who could only borrow them for a few
hours' enchantment. It has often been written that Cook 'discovered
Australia,' and the statement is not infrequently repeated nowadays,
when there are so many reasons for knowing better. Literally, of
course, it is not true; but in a deeper sense it is. The Dutch had
indeed found and mapped portions of the continent, but all their
reports about it were repellent. Cook's, however, were alluring. He saw
the country in what he truly described as a pure state of nature. 'The
industry of man has had nothing to do with any part of it, and yet we
find all such things as nature hath bestowed upon it in a flourishing
state. In this extensive country it can never be doubted but what most
sorts of grain, fruit, roots, etc., of every kind, would flourish were
they once brought hither, planted, and cultivated by the hands of
industry; and here is provender for more cattle, at all seasons of the
year, than ever can be brought into the country.'</p>

<p>So that Cook not only discovered the entire east coast of the
continent--and that was a larger piece of geographical discovery, made
at one time, than has ever been achieved by one navigator before or
since--but he discovered its abounding possibilities as a place for the
habitation of civilized mankind. That was the most splendid result of
his great voyage of 1770.</p>

<p>Just as the discoveries made by the Dutch upon the west and north
coasts of Australia were closely connected with the Reformation in
Europe, so the settlement established by the English at Port Jackson in
1788 was related to other events of great importance in world
history.</p>

<p>The War of Independence which resulted from the revolt of the
American colonies ended in 1782; and it produced two kinds of
complications, both of which turned the attention of British ministers
to the vast empty continent in the south seas. The first was the
question of the American loyalists; of those colonists who had remained
faithful to the British connection during the dark days of the war, and
were now in dire straits. The triumphant Americans behaved very harshly
towards fellow-countrymen who had fought against them. Their property
was confiscated, debts owing to them could not be recovered, and
thousands of them were driven from the land. The greater number of the
loyalists, over 50,000, went to Canada, Nova Scotia, and the West
Indies, but many accompanied the British troops to England at the
conclusion of the war. Most of these were herded together in utter
destitution in London, and what to do with them was a problem which the
Government had to face.</p>

<p>The second complication rose out of the unsettlement of the English
penal system by the stoppage of the transportation of convicts to
America. It had been the regular practice during the eighteenth century
to ship large numbers of offenders against the law to the colonies.
There was such an eager demand for labour there that contractors were
willing to take convicts at no expense to the Government, knowing that
they could sell them to planters for as much as 20 pounds per head.
Between 1717 and the War of Independence at least 50,000 English
convicts were received into America. Several colonies protested against
the traffic, and their legislatures even passed laws to put an end to
it, but in such instances the home Government exercised its power of
vetoing colonial statutes.</p>

<p>Now that America had separated from the British Empire this means of
disposing of criminals was no longer available. But the English law
still prescribed transportation as a punishment, and judges continued
to inflict such sentences. The prisons were wholly insufficient to hold
the condemned persons. Edmund Burke, speaking in Parliament in 1786,
said that the jails were crowded beyond measure. 'There was a house in
London which consisted at this time of just 558 members; he did not
mean the House of Commons, though the numbers were alike in both, but
the jail of Newgate.' Reform in one, he added, would not be less
agreeable than reform in the other. Thousands of prisoners were crowded
into wretchedly insanitary hulks which were purchased to serve as
receptacles. Every month saw more and more sentences of transportation
inflicted, more hulks filled with offenders, and still there was no
place to which they could be exiled. There were said to be 100,000
persons in England under sentence of transportation. That must have
been an exaggeration; but still, the problem was acute. The Government
caused an examination to be made of sites in Southwest Africa, where it
was suggested that penal settlements might be founded. Some hundreds of
convicts were in fact landed in Africa, but the places chosen were
simply abodes of plague, pestilence, and famine, Burke eloquently asked
the Government how they could reconcile it with justice that persons
whom the rigour of the law had spared from death 'should after a mock
display of mercy be compelled to undergo it by being sent to a country
where they could not live, and where the manner of the death might be
singularly horrid; so that the apparent mercy of transporting those
wretched people to Africa might with justice be called cruelty--the
gallows of England would rid them of their lives in a far less dreadful
manner than the climate or the savages of Africa would take them.'</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-12"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-12.jpg"></p>

<p>Thus the problem of settling the American loyalists and that of
dealing. with the convicts occupied the attention of the Cabinet of
William Pitt at the same time.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph Banks was the first to make the suggestion that in New
Holland could be found a suitable place for convict settlement. In 1779
he gave evidence before a committee of the House of Commons appointed
to consider the convict question; and he then recommended that Botany
Bay would be 'best adapted' for the purpose. He remembered Botany Bay
with pleasure because of the plants he had collected there. But the
Government was too much engaged with other pressing business at that
time to act upon the suggestion.</p>

<p>Four years later another man, a Corsican who had been with Cook in
the <i>Endeavour</i>, directed attention to the suitableness of Botany
Bay with a view of relieving the Government of their second
embarrassment. James Maria Matra, in a letter to Lord Sydney, Secretary
of State for the Home Department, in 1783, pointed out that the
distress of the American loyalists might be relieved by sending them
out to populate the empty spaces of New Holland. There was plenty of
room for them; there was scope for commerce with India, China, and
Japan; and they might, under British protection, build up in the south
estates and fortunes to replace those of which they had been deprived
in America. The subject had been discussed with some of the Americans,
who agreed that the proposal offered the most favourable prospects that
had yet occurred to promote their happiness.</p>

<p>Lord Sydney had an interview with Matra, and discussed the scheme
with him. It would seem that he viewed the convict trouble as more
serious than that affecting the loyalists, and Matra saw that he would
be more likely to attain the settlement of New Holland by amending his
scheme. He therefore added to it a postscript, wherein he pointed out
that in New Holland there were abundant possibilities for the founding
of a colony for the reception of convicts.</p>

<p>In 1785 Admiral Sir George Young submitted to the Government a
detailed plan for the settlement of both loyalists and convicts in New
South Wales. The fact that New Holland was such a long distance from
Europe appeared to him to be a particularly strong argument in favour
of it. He thought that, by sending the convicts there, England would
get rid of them 'for ever.'</p>

<p>The failures on the west coast of Africa and the arguments in favour
of New Holland induced the Government in 1786 to resolve to make an
experiment in this country; and the King's speech to Parliament in
January 1787 definitely announced that a plan had been formed for
transporting a number of convicts 'in order to remove the inconvenience
which arose from the crowded state of the jails in different parts of
the kingdom.' About the fate of the loyalists nothing was said. The
Government missed the opportunity of conferring advantages upon a
number of people who had brought distress upon themselves by following
their consciences in supporting a losing side, and at the same time of
peopling a new country with a stock experienced in colonization.</p>

<p>It would be pleasant if we could attribute to so great a man as Pitt
the vision of a far-seeing Imperial statesmanship in the deciding of
this issue; but in truth there is no evidence that he had even a
glimmering idea that England was founding a great new nation in the
southern seas. He was a practical politician immersed in the problems
and perplexities of the hour. One of the vexing questions confronting
his Cabinet was that of the disposal of the felons, and the Minister
responsible, Lord Sydney, recommended the plan of sending them to New
Holland. Pitt assented, and showed just such a measure of interest in
the project as the head of a Government might be expected to take in a
scheme projected by a colleague. Once, in the House of Commons, he
apologized for not having furnished some information about
transportation which had been asked for on the ground of 'a very great
hurry of public business.' On another occasion he defended the scheme
because 'in point of expense no cheaper mode of disposing of the
convicts could be found.' 'No cheaper mode'--there was no imperial
imagination in that; but it was eminently practical. It would have been
eternally to Pitt's honour if, remembering the plight of the American
loyalists, he had given precedence to their claims, and had heeded the
warning of Bacon that 'it is a shameful and unblessed thing to take the
scum of people and wicked condemned men to be the people with whom you
plant.' But he was not consciously planting a colony so much as
disposing of a difficulty. Yet, if we estimate the importance of
political things by their endurance, their ultimate value, their large
and expanding effect upon human affairs, the founding of New South
Wales was the most important of all the policies taken in hand by
Pitt's Government at this time. Out of the settlement authorised in
1786 grew the Commonwealth of Australia.</p>

<p>It is very remarkable that, even after the new colony had been
founded, the Government had not entirely abandoned the sending of
convicts elsewhere. It had not apparently made up its mind that Botany
Bay was to be the only receptacle. The correspondence of Grenville,
Pitt's Foreign Minister, contains a letter written by him as late as
November 1789, wherein he said (DROPMORE PAPERS, vol. i. p. 543). 'The
landing convicts in the territories of the United States, even if the
masters of the ships perform their contracts for so doing, is an act
highly offensive to a country now foreign and independent; and as such
very improper for this Government to authorise. And it is, besides, an
act of extreme cruelty to the convicts, who, being turned ashore
without any of the necessaries of life, are either left to starve, or
(as has sometimes been the case) are massacred by the inhabitants. And
as to transporting to the King's American colonies, you may depend upon
it that, after the example set them by Admiral Milbanke, none of our
governors will suffer any of these people to be landed in their
governments.' The case referred to by Grenville related to the sending
of eighty Irish convicts to Newfoundland, where the Governor, Milbanke,
refused to allow them to land, ignoring an Irish Act of Parliament of
1786 which authorised the sending of convicts to America or to such
place out of Europe as should be appointed. The significant fact is
that these Irish convicts were sent to Newfoundland after the new
colony in Australia had been established.</p>

<p>Arthur Phillip, a captain in the Navy, was selected to be the first
Governor of New South Wales, the limits of which were stated by his
commission to extend from Cape York to the southern extremity of the
country, and westward as far as the 135th degree of longitude. The
territory thus defined embraced about one-half of the continent, and it
did not include any of the western portion which the Dutch had named
New Holland. Indeed, at this time it was not known that the country was
one great island. Many considered that a strait would be found dividing
New Holland from New South Wales. The Government may well have
considered that they were acting with caution in placing the western
boundary of the colony at the 135th degree. There was no desire as yet
to appropriate the whole of Australia.</p>

<p>On May 13, 1787, the 'First Fleet 'sailed from England. It consisted
of the SIRIUS, the SUPPLY, three store ships, and six transports
carrying the convicts: eleven vessels in all. Phillip arrived in Botany
Bay on January 18, 1788, and two days later the whole of the ships were
safely at anchor there. The total company which arrived was over 1,000.
The staff of officers, marines, and extra hands, with women and
children, numbered 290, and the convicts who reached Botany Bay were
717, of whom 520 were males. This was the stock with which the new
colony was settled.</p>

<p>An examination of Botany Bay speedily convinced Phillip that the
place was unsuitable. The openness of the bay, the inferior quality of
the soil, and the swamps with which the coastal land was surrounded,
would have made settlement there unsuccessful. Phillip therefore
determined to go north and inspect Port Jackson, the harbour which Cook
had marked down upon his chart, but had not entered, There his seaman's
eye was delighted with the prospect, and his administrative
intelligence perceived that the required conditions were fully met. He
found what he described as 'the finest harbour in the world, in which a
thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security,' and a
deep cove in proximity to a supply of fresh water. To this he gave the
name of Lord Sydney; and it became for many years to come the place of
exile of many thousands of offenders who, as the poet Campbell wrote,
were 'doom'd the long isles of Sydney Cove to see.' A little later
Phillip found a place which he considered worthy to bear the name of
the Prime Minister. To the north of Port Jackson he entered Broken Bay,
and there looked upon 'the finest piece of water I ever saw, and which
I honoured with the name of Pittwater.'</p>

<p>The position chosen by Phillip was in every way worthy of the
enthusiastic praise which he bestowed upon it. It lay upon the south
side of a great sheet of water, which, broken into many deep and
sheltered bays, and surrounded by timbered terraces, was beautiful to
the eye, and offered illimitable scope as a seat of commerce. The
shores had a deep-water frontage of 200 miles. In 'the dark backward
and abysm of time' it had been the estuary of a river flowing into the
ocean many miles east of the present coastline, but the sinking of the
floor of the sea in the course of ages had brought it to its present
level, and made it a many-fronded harbour.</p>

<p>While the First Fleet was lying at anchor in Botany Bay, just after
the return of the Governor from Port Jackson, two strange vessels were
seen approaching. Their appearance aroused much curiosity. Seine
thought they might be Dutchmen prepared to dispute the landing of the
British, and speculated as to whether there would have to be a fight.
Phillip guessed that they were French exploring ships under the command
of the Comte de Laperouse, and he proved to be right. He was at that
time, on the morning of January 24, making plans for transferring his
whole company to the site, which he had chosen at Sydney Cove, and did
not consider it expedient to wait for the strangers, but hurried off to
complete his preparations.</p>

<p>Laperouse brought his two vessels into Botany Bay, and came to
anchor there just as Captain Hunter of the SIRIUS, whom Phillip had
left in charge, was sailing out. The reason for the visit of the French
to Botany Bay is quite clear from the letters and journals of
Laperouse. He had been pursuing discovery work in the Pacific, and at
one of the islands of the Samoa group two boats' crews had met with
disaster. They had all been massacred by natives, and the long-boats
had been smashed. Laperouse carried in the holds of his ships the
frames and planks of two new boats, and desired to find a quiet harbour
where he could fit them together. He wished to avoid a landing at any
South Sea island where natives might be encountered, because his men
were very angry about the loss of their companions, and if there had
been another encounter, with loss of life, he would have been left with
insufficient strength for the manning of both his ships, and would have
been compelled to beach and destroy one of them. Having been a close
student of the voyages of Cook, he remembered that navigator's
description of Botany Bay, and decided to go there and build his new
long-boats. The idea that Laperouse entertained any intention of
claiming the place for the French, or of founding a settlement
anywhere, is pure fable. The French remained in Botany Bay till March
10, on excellent terms with the British officers who visited them, and
then sailed again into the Pacific, to meet their death upon the coral
reefs of Vanicoro.</p>

<p>On January 26 Phillip unfurled the British flag at Sydney with
simple ceremony, the King's health was drunk, and work began. The
process of clearing the ground and erecting shelters was taken in hand
with the utmost vigour. The Governor himself, while the work
progressed, lived in a small canvas house which was neither wind nor
water proof. The officers, marines, and convicts camped in tents made
principally from old sail-cloth which had been brought from England for
the purpose. Spaces were cleared for the sowing of corn, trees were cut
down for the building of wooden huts, stores were landed from the
ships, labour was organized for shaping a disciplined community out of
fractious elements and replacing wild forest and scrub with a planned,
orderly township. On February 7 the Governor's commission was read, and
he took the oaths required by law before an assemblage of the whole
population, civil, military, and convicts. One of the oaths which he
was required to take was that abjuring the Pretender. This was the last
occasion when it was taken by a Governor within the British Empire, for
Charles Edward Stuart had died on January 31, 1788, a week before
Phillip solemnly abjured him and his claims to the British throne.</p>

<p>To few men has been given so great an opportunity as that which fell
to Arthur Phillip. He was the founder of a new European State in a land
where civilized man had never lived before. There was not one among all
the subjects of King George III whose place in history was more assured
than his. The ambition to live in the memory of posterity for ages is
common among mankind. Monuments of bronze and marble, public bequests
and endowments, gifts and foundations, are favourite modes of cheating
oblivion; and the age in which this history was being worked out saw
many great reputations made and many efforts to perpetuate fame by
various means. But who amongst them all did a piece of work to compare
with Phillip's? And who amongst them all overcame such difficulties
with such imperfect material, and reaped so small a material
reward?</p>

<p>The difficulties arose chiefly from the character of the men with
whom he had to work, and the irregularity and insufficiency of the
supplies while the infant colony was dependent upon outside resources.
The very defects which had made many of the convicts offenders against
the law at home made them a wretchedly inefficient stock with which to
found a colony. They were lazy and incapable. 'Numbers of them have
been brought up from their infancy in such indolence that they would
starve if left to themselves' Phillip reported. As more convicts were
sent out he had to complain that the healthy and those who were masters
of trades were retained in English prisons, whilst the useless were
transported. 'The sending out of the disordered and helpless clears the
jails and may ease the parishes from which they are sent,' Philip
wrote, 'but it is obvious that this settlement, instead of being a
colony which is to support itself, will, if the practice be continued,
remain for years a burden to the mother-country.' He laboured to
encourage his colonists to reform by granting liberal concessions to
the deserving; and he pleaded with the Government to send out also
honest, intelligent settlers, whose example might act as an incentive.
'We shall want some good characters to whom these people might look
up.'</p>

<p>The difficulty as to supplies was constant during the first few
years of settlement. The colony was dependent upon provisions sent from
England, and a mishap to a single supply ship meant imminent
starvation. There were times when the labourers complained of hunger
when called forth to their work. In March 1792 Phillip stated that his
community had been on a reduced ration since November 1789, a period of
over two years; and if a ship became overdue, people were alarmed at
the prospect of supplies failing. At another time he had to send 200 to
Norfolk Island--where a settlement had been founded in 1788--to relieve
the pressure upon the resources of Sydney. The livestock in the
beginning increased very slowly; many cattle died from disease; ants
and field-mice ate the seed-corn; the rice went bad, but had to be
eaten nevertheless. During times of distress Phillip added his own
private store of provisions to the common stock, and did not permit
himself to receive more than the ordinary ration which was received by
all alike.</p>

<p>Moreover, with the menace of positive starvation stretching its
shadow over the settlement, with wretched human material to use, with
the feeling which must have been often with him that the home
Government looked upon Sydney as little better than a rubbish-tip,
Phillip not only never lost heart, but never wavered in his view of the
essential nobility of his mission. Others might despair of the future
of the colony; he never did. One of his officers wrote that it would be
cheaper 'to feed the convicts on turtle and venison at the London
Tavern than to be at the expense of sending them here.' But we never
find that note struck in Phillip's letters and despatches. For him
there was no doubt of the future. At the end of a despatch wherein he
had had to chronicle the loss of cattle, conflicts with savages,
insufficiency of food, illness among the convicts, and even earthquake,
he trumpeted his conviction as to the future, 'Nor do I doubt but that
this country will prove the most valuable acquisition Great Britain
ever made.' 'I am serving my country and serving the cause of
humanity,' he said in another despatch.</p>

<p>Apart from the occupation of Norfolk Island there was a little
extension of settlement during Phillip's governorship. The first
township out of Sydney was established at Parramatta, at first called
Rose Hill, where farming was encouraged and the experiment was tried of
placing industrious convicts on land with the promise that, if they
behaved well, free grants should be made to them.</p>

<p>Before Phillip resigned office he had the satisfaction of seeing
close upon 2,000 acres of land under cultivation at Parramatta. Indeed,
the soil along the Parramatta River was so good that he acknowledged
that, if he had seen it when first looking for a site, he might have
been induced to make the main settlement there.</p>

<p>Late in 1792, just as he saw the colony approaching to a state of
self-dependence in the production of the necessaries of life,
ill-health compelled Phillip to resign his governorship and return to
England. He left in December of that year, hoping to be able to resume
the work at a later date. But he did not see Sydney Cove again, and he
died at Bath in 1814, slipping out of life so quietly that his
burial-place was not discovered till over eighty years afterwards.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V - THE CONVICT SYSTEM</h3>

<blockquote><b>The New South Wales Corps--Grose and Paterson--Hunter
Governor of New South Wales--Trading monopolies--System of
transportation--The assignment system--Tickets of leave--Political
prisoners--Irish rebels.</b></blockquote>

<p>In the year after the establishment of Sydney a military force was
raised in England especially for the new colony. It was called the New
South Wales Corps. The First Fleet had been accompanied by marines, and
the intention had been that a detachment of this regiment should be
stationed permanently at Sydney. But the officers and men disliked the
service, and the Government therefore determined to organize a special
corps of infantry. The policy was to encourage the members of the corps
to settle in New South Wales, and land grants were promised to them as
an inducement. A very prominent and occasionally turbulent part was
henceforth played by this military force, which, though designed to aid
the Government, strove to become its master. Every Governor after
Phillip until the corps ceased to exist in 1810 (when the practice of
stationing detachments of regular troops in Australia was commenced)
had trouble with it. It flouted Governor Hunter, who had to complain
that it violated peace and order and defied the law; it insulted
Governor King; and it deposed Governor Bligh.</p>

<p>The second Governor of New South Wales, Captain John Hunter, who had
commanded the SIRIUS with the First Fleet, was not appointed till more
than a year after the departure of Phillip, and did not arrive in
Sydney till September 1795. During the interval of nearly three years
the government was administered first by Major Francis Grose, and in
the last nine months by Captain William Paterson, both officers of the
New South Wales Corps. It was a great misfortune that this period of
military rule occurred; because in the course of it the colony was
brought to degradation by drink, corruption, and general iniquity,
which required years to mitigate. Phillip had imposed restrictions on
the distribution of spirituous liquors, recognizing the evils which
would inevitably follow from the common use of them among a morally
weak population. But Grose permitted large quantities of spirits to be
imported and to come into the possession of officers and settlers, who
freely used them for rewarding the convicts who worked for them. Rum,
as spirits of all kinds were called, was a curse and a calamity in
Sydney for years to come. Officers profited from the distillation,
importation, and sale of it, soldiers and convicts alike consumed large
quantities of it; and it bore an evil fruit of disease, crime, outrage,
and rebellion.</p>

<p>Grose was particularly tender towards his brother officers, in
permitting them to acquire landed estates and to have the services of
convict labourers. When Hunter took charge he found that no land had
been cleared for public purposes and no public works carried out since
Phillip left, nearly the whole of the convict labour having been
utilized for the profit of the officers. The Government fed and clothed
the convicts, the officers had their labour for nothing, and the
Government purchased the commodities produced by it at prices fixed by
the same officers.</p>

<p>The officers were also permitted to enjoy a monopoly in the purchase
of spirits and other commodities imported for general sale, and
pocketed large gains from them. Their military duties and the honour of
their uniform were subordinated to sordid avarice, and the entire
community was debauched in order that they might grow rich. Maurice
Margarot, a political prisoner, was examined before the House of
Commons Committee on Transportation on his return to England in 1812.
He was asked, 'Do the majority of the officers to whom the Government
of the colony is entrusted embark in trade? 'All, to a man,' he
replied. 'What is that trade? 'It consists first of all of monopoly,
then of extortion; it includes all the necessaries of life which are
brought to the colony.' In 1797, said Margarot, a 'combination bond'
was entered into by the officers, 'by which they were neither to
under-buy nor under-sell the one from the other.' It was the first
example of a 'trust' in Australia. The same witness spoke of spirits
which had cost 7s. 6d. being sold in this way for 8 pounds per gallon.
A letter written by Mrs. John Macarthur explains how the monopoly was
managed. 'The officers in the colony, with a few others possessed of
money or credit in England, unite together and purchase the cargoes of
such vessels as repair to this country from various quarters. Two or
more are chosen from the number to bargain for the cargo offered for
sale, which is then divided amongst them in proportion to the amount of
their subscriptions.'</p>

<p>At the same time as he allowed this trading system to be commenced,
Grose suppressed the civil magistracy, and placed the entire
administration of justice in the hands of the military men. When
Governor Hunter insisted on restoring the justices to their functions,
they were subjected to annoyance by the soldiers, and he felt compelled
to report to the Secretary of State that 'for these shameful and
unpardonable purposes the most improper means which a mischievously
fertile imagination, a malicious, restless, and vindictive disposition
could invent,' had been used. Grose frankly disliked all in the
community whom he could not pamper as soldiers or control as convicts.
He spoke testily of having been 'much plagued with the people who
become settlers.'</p>

<p>The corrupt military autocracy established under the administration
of Grose and Paterson had to be broken down during the governorships of
Hunter (1795-1800), King (1800-1806), and Bligh (1806-1808), all of
whom found the officers tenacious of their profits and privileges, and
determined to fight for them by all means available. Inasmuch as a
Governor had no force to back up his administration except such as was
commanded by these officers, and as they commonly worked against him,
it was very difficult for him to maintain respect for his office, much
less rightful authority and obedience.</p>

<p>The foundation of society in these early years in New South Wales
was the convict system. For that the colony was established, for that
it was maintained. No country in Europe had a harsher criminal code
than England at this time. At the beginning of the nineteenth century
over two hundred offences were punishable with death; and public
executions, performed amid the revolting ribaldry of gaping crowds,
were amongst the common spectacles of London. But in many cases it lay
within the option of the judges to impose sentences of transportation
for terms of seven or fourteen years, or for life; whilst in years of
war many convicts were permitted to enlist in the Army and Navy. As
late as 1837, the year of the accession of Queen Victoria, an official
list of offences for which sentences of transportation might be
inflicted contained over two hundred items. Many were very serious, but
others were offences for which sentences so harsh would be deemed
barbarous nowadays, such as slaughtering butcher's meat without a
licence, damaging trees and saplings to an extent exceeding 5 pounds,
stealing oysters from an oyster-bed, defacing marks on government
property, poaching, or being upon any land armed by night for the
purpose of taking or destroying game or rabbits. Not all convicts who
were transported had committed offences even of this kind. An Irish
knight was sent out for abducting the wealthy heiress of a Quaker
banker, and an officer of the Indian army for killing his opponent in a
duel.</p>

<p>Convicts were conveyed from England to New South Wales in hired
transports, the owners of which as well as the captains and officers
entered into bonds for the safe custody of those placed on board. The
earliest transports carried military guards, but when England became
deeply involved in war with France, and could ill spare troops, they
carried extra numbers of seamen to act as guards. Contractors received
between 20 and 30 pounds per head; and, as their profit depended upon
the number of convicts carried, there was an inducement to cram as many
on board as the ships would hold. Consequently the death-rate on the
passage was very high. On the ship NEPTUNE in 1790, 158 died on the
passage out of 502 who were put on board, and those who did arrive in
Sydney were all pitiably ill. Out of 300 on board the HILSBOROUGH in
1799, 95 died on the passage, and those who arrived were 'in the most
sickly and wretched state.' The prison authorities in England did not
always see that those embarked were properly clad. Governor Hunter
reported the arrival of a shipload who were embarked with only the
clothes in which they stood, and who 'consequently arrived here
naked.'</p>

<p>The horrors of the passage were, however, mitigated after 1802, when
the Government adopted the system of sending out convicts twice a year
in ships fitted up for the purpose, under the direction of a Transport
Board, and commanded by officers of the Navy.</p>

<p>Phillip commenced the plan of 'assigning' convicts to settlers for
work on farms, and assignment remained an essential feature of the
system as long as transportation endured. A convict upon arrival might
never be placed in confinement. The whole colony was the jail. It is
true that log prisons were erected both in Sydney and Parramatta, but
these were intended rather for those who broke the law after
transportation there than as places of punishment for offences
committed in England. Very refractory cases were sent to Norfolk
Island.</p>

<p>Legally the Governor was endowed with a 'property in the services'
of a convict for the term of his transportation; and when he was
assigned to a settler or an officer the property in his services was
transferred to the assignee. After the abolition of negro slavery
within the British Empire the question was sometimes put whether the
transportation system was not another form of the evil thing which had
been suppressed. Lord John Russell did not hesitate to affirm in the
House of Commons that it was 'pure slavery.' Earl Grey in his book on
COLONIAL POLICY, wrote that 'the assigned servants were in fact slaves,
and there is only too painful proof that in many instances the evils
inseparable from slavery were experienced.' Lawyers insisted on the
distinction between property in the person, as in slavery, and
'property in the services,' as in transportation. Inasmuch, however, as
the 'services' could not be rendered without the 'person,' the
difference was somewhat subtle.</p>

<p>Merely nominal wages were required to be paid to the assigned
servants, and these were usually paid not in money but in such goods as
tea, sugar, and tobacco, which were not included in the regulation
rations. The assigned servants had to be fed, clothed, and housed to
the satisfaction of the authorities. Some masters were undoubtedly
cruel, and express orders had to be issued forbidding 'beating or
horse-whipping any prisoner whose labour has been assigned.' Any person
proved to have beaten assigned servants instead of having recourse to
the magistrates when punishment was deemed to be deserved, was liable
to be deprived of the labour. Good masters gave their well-behaved
assigned servants a more liberal diet than the government regulations
required. A Sydney merchant who employed large numbers on his country
properties recorded that he rarely experienced trouble with them,
though he managed them chiefly by 'moral influences.' One of his men
was a Trafalgar hero transported for striking an officer when in a
state of intoxication; and this man remained forty years in the
merchant's service. The letter of a convict lad to his mother in
England contains the pathetic passage: 'I am doing a great deal better
than ever I was at home, only for wanting you with me; all my
uncomfortableness is in being away from you.'</p>

<p>There is excellent reason for accepting the statements of
contemporaries who knew the conditions prevailing in rural England and
could compare with conditions in New South Wales, that the convict
assigned to a farmer was better clothed and better fed than the honest
English labourer, and at least as comfortably housed.</p>

<p>But the discipline imposed was often ferociously harsh. The lash and
the noose swung ever ready, and were freely employed. After a rebellion
of Irish convicts, fifteen ringleaders were summarily hanged in one
batch, and others received sentences of two hundred, five hundred, and
even a thousand lashes with the cat-o'nine-tails. As soon as a wretch
had recovered from the prostration caused by one portion of his
sentence, he was taken out and given another.</p>

<p>Convicts were allowed to marry, and were in some instances assigned
as servants to their own wives. In one notorious instance a convict
transported for forgery was followed out from England by his own wife,
who brought with her a considerable sum of money which the authorities
had reason to believe represented the proceeds of robberies. She opened
a shop in Sydney, and secured her own husband as her assigned servant.
She managed the business, and he lived a luxurious life on the profits
derived from it. In one of the official reports there is a quaint
letter from a convict asking his sweetheart to come to him from
England. 'I can get a petition drawn up to marry her,' he wrote; 'she
can take me of Government free from all expense.' The practice of
assigning convicts to their own wives was afterwards discontinued, on
the ground that 'it tends to do away with the punishment'--which says
something for the amiability of the wives.</p>

<p>A convict who, because of good conduct or commendable service, was
liberated from servitude was called an emancipist. The word was often
applied also to those whose term of sentence had expired and who
continued to reside in the colony, but more usually these were called
expirees. An emancipist was free to engage in any industry for his own
profit, instead of as a servant of another. There were emancipist
clergymen, merchants, bank directors, attorneys, surgeons, and
schoolmasters. Not a few emancipated convicts became wealthy men. There
is record of several who lived at the rate of 3,000 pounds a year, and
one was stated on high authority in 1837 to draw 40,000 pounds a year,
principally from Sydney property.</p>

<p>Except in the case of political prisoners concerning whom special
instructions were given, it was not difficult to win emancipation, and
those to whom it was granted could easily obtain grants of land, upon
which they might prosper. The rendering of useful service was
encouraged by this inducement. Thus, when Captain Flinders required
additional seamen for a voyage of exploration, he was allowed to select
nine convicts, who were promised conditional or absolute pardons
according to his recommendation. Officers of the French scientific
expedition which visited Port Jackson in 1802 formed a highly
favourable opinion of the means adopted for reforming the convicts and
converting them into useful and dependable citizens.</p>

<p>Convicts who were employed on Government work were encouraged to win
their release from hard labour by their own good conduct. Thus, when
Governor Macquarie founded a settlement at Newcastle in 1810 for
working the deposits of coal, he ordered that convicts were to be
informed that they could procure relief from that service, which was
not popular among them, by diligence and creditable behaviour. He was
strict to enjoin that they should be treated justly. If they were
called upon to work overtime, they were to be allotted extra rations,
and they were to be persuaded to rear poultry and pigs and to cultivate
gardens 'for their own use and comfort.' The commandant was enjoined to
administer justice with clemency; and 'you are at all times rather to
forgo punishment than to inflict it where the evidence of guilt is not
perfectly clear and satisfactory.'</p>

<p>During the first thirty years tickets of leave--that is,
certificates of permission to convicts to work for their own benefit
instead of being consigned to a master--were granted without any
regular system, at the discretion of the Governor. But Governor
Brisbane established a regular scale, under which a convict sentenced
to seven years' transportation could obtain his ticket after four years
of good conduct; a convict sentenced to fourteen years could obtain one
after six years; and one sentenced to transportation for life could
secure this measure of prescribed freedom after eight years. There were
many instances of masters who had especially valuable servants assigned
to them--clever mechanics, for instance--and not desiring to lose them,
concocting charges against them in order that the grant of their
tickets of leave might be withheld for a few years.</p>

<p>The capacity of the colony to absorb labour sent from England
depended of course upon the number of settlers, farms, and industries.
In the earlier years there were more convicts than the administration
could conveniently place, and to relieve itself of the cost of
maintaining them it granted special indulgences to settlers and
officers to induce them to receive more labourers than they actually
needed. But with the extension of settlement the case was reversed. For
about twenty years from the beginning of the nineteenth century the
whole number transported could easily he assigned, and from about the
year 1823 the demand for labour generally exceeded the supply.
Sometimes, however, there would be a temporary glut of labour; at other
times a pressing demand for it. Once, when a Governor had more men on
his hands than he could place, he made a contract with a wealthy
merchant to grant to him 10,000 acres of very rich land at Shoalhaven
in return for his taking a hundred convicts. The merchant profited
exceedingly from the bargain, because the full number was never
supplied, their services being required elsewhere. At another time
(1826) there were applications for 2,000 more convict servants than the
Superintendent could furnish. At length another highly interesting
phase developed. When the number of free settlers became large, there
arose a repugnance to receive any more convicts, however profitable
their labour might be.</p>

<p>Political agitations in Great Britain which were obnoxious to the
Government, and rebellions in Ireland, brought to New South Wales a
class of convicts who were wholly different from the ordinary criminals
supplied from English jails. The case of the 'Scottish martyrs' is one
of outstanding interest. Societies for the promotion of parliamentary
reform had been formed in Scotland, and at their meetings speeches had
been made which reflected such advanced opinions as had become widely
current under the influence of the French Revolution. The Government
was alarmed at the dissemination of these sentiments among the working
classes, and determined to lay some of the ringleaders by the heels. In
1793 they arrested Thomas Muir, an eloquent advocate who had attained
some distinction as a political leader; the Rev. T. F. Palmer,
Unitarian minister at Dundee; William Skirving, secretary of the
Edinburgh Friends of the People society; Maurice Margarot, and Joseph
Gerrald. These men were tried for sedition before the notorious Lord
Justice Clerk, Braxfield, in Edinburgh, and were sentenced to
transportation to New South Wales, although the Acts in force in
England enabling prisoners to be transported did not apply to Scotland.
Braxfield's brutal conduct at the trials and the illegality of the
sentences were denounced in the House of Commons, where Charles James
Fox exclaimed, 'God help the people who have such judges!'</p>

<p>Muir managed to make his escape from Sydney in an American ship, and
died in France. Palmer served his sentence and died on his way home to
England. Skirving, an eminently high-minded and honourable man, died in
Sydney, as also did Gerrald. Margaret was the only one of the five
'martyrs' who on personal grounds does not command a full measure of
respect, and he was the only one of them who saw his native land again.
The others were victims of official and judicial vindictiveness, if not
of positively illegal treatment, as well as of the nervous fear of
necessary and long-delayed reform to which Wordsworth referred when he
wrote, 'In Britain rules a panic dread of change.'</p>

<p>The Irish rebellion of 1798, and the seditious risings which
preceded it, resulted in the pouring of a turbulent stream of convicts
into Sydney. Inasmuch as their rebellion sprang from feelings of bitter
discontent, it was but natural that they should bring their sourness
towards British rule overseas with them; and though many of the Irish
prisoners were on personal grounds reputable men, they contributed to
the life of the colony elements of violent hatred and conspiracy which
had to be stamped out by vigorously exemplary means. It is a remarkable
fact that though the convict colony was filled with people who had
broken the law in a variety of ways, and many of whom had done
desperate things, there never was any serious danger of disruption
except from these Irish political prisoners. The gallows and the cat
demanded a heavy toll for the mutinies of 1803 and 1804. But Governor
King could not afford to treat them lightly, for if there had been a
general rising among the thousands of convicts whom he controlled, the
whole settlement would have been reduced to the wildest anarchy, and
the slender forces at his command might have been annihilated. He may
not have known then, but there is the clearest evidence now, that the
French were secretly informed that if an attack were made on Sydney the
assailants might count upon the assistance of the Irish rebels. We must
remember the extraordinary circumstances which had to be dealt with
when we find so arbitrary a decree as that of King, that if any two
persons were found conferring together, and did not disperse within
half an hour of being ordered to do so by any free person, official or
otherwise, they should suffer death.</p>

<p>One of the worst features of the treatment of these people was that
very many of them were transported without any papers to show the term
of their sentences. Governor Hunter, though he thought them 'turbulent
and worthless characters,' admitted that many had a serious grievance
in that they did not know, nor did he, for what periods they had been
transported; and Governor King, who admitted that many of them were
'real deserving characters,' notwithstanding that he found a 'restless
and diabolical spirit' working amongst them, had the same complaint to
make. Indeed, when reference was made to the Government in Ireland for
particulars, it was acknowledged that many convicts had been
transported without trial by legally constituted courts, and that a
record of convictions had not been kept. Soldiers in regiments which
had shown signs of disaffection were clapped on board ship and
transported by the simple order of a commanding officer, without even a
list of their names being sent with them.</p>

<p>Rebels by life-long disposition, bitter enemies of the authority
which had exiled and now held them, with a feeling of injustice
rankling in their hearts, these Irish exiles, who numbered about two
thousand, were a continual cause of unrest. They were far more
troublesome than all the forgers, burglars, and thieves with whom the
Governors had to deal. Many attempts to escape were made by groups of
them. Some seized boats and got away to sea, generally perishing in the
attempt. Wild imagination, heightened perhaps by the despair which
grasps at shadows, spread amongst them the idea that somewhere to the
north of the settlement, right away across the mountains which looked
so blue in the distance, lay other communities of white people; that
China might be reached by tramping; that it was possible by flight into
the interior to get away from the restraints which maddened them. They
thought, reported Governor Hunter, that they could escape 'to this
fancied paradise or to China.' Few who made the attempt in this manner
ever returned. Their bones were left to bleach in the deep, rocky
hollows of the mountains.</p>

<p>The little colony upon the shores of Port Jackson, a few square
miles shut in between the hills and the sea, contained during the
half-century after its foundation as queer a community as has ever been
gathered together. There were rogues with the incomes of millionaires
jostling persons born to rank who had encountered the fate of the man
who once 'went down from Jerusalem to Jericho.' A visiting ship's
captain who wrote his memoirs described how he met in a Sydney shop a
pretty young woman who, though dressed as a servant, appeared from her
manner and speech to be of gentle birth and good education. He learnt
her story, and at her request sought out her brother in England, a man
of position, to tell him that she still lived. On another day the same
visitor met a fine, handsome man dressed in 'a new blue coat with black
velvet collar, like a gentleman should be, which he was every inch of
him'; he had been a leader of the Irish rebels in Wexford. One who had
held the office of sheriff of a county might have been seen upon the
footpath alongside a clever French forger who had essayed to help his
own country by ruining the Bank of England. A high-minded political
idealist like Skirving rubbed shoulders with a boisterous ruffian like
Sir Henry Brown Hayes. Men who sought relief in adversity by reading
the dialogues of Plato and the poetry of Lucretius, lived cheek by jowl
with those who could not read anything. A talented artist who 'was
always distinguished by his skill in the arts of imitation,' was sent
out for forgery, and, as an official report quaintly said, secured a
mitigation of punishment 'in consideration of his having painted an
altar-piece for the church.' The penal laws of Great Britain tossed
them all down together in one of the most beautiful situations in the
world, now suffused with an atmosphere of rum and rascality--a jumble
of thieves, cut-throats, swindlers, forgers, rebels, poachers, ruined
gamblers and fraudulent debtors. The lines attributed to the pickpocket
Barrington--who at Sydney became a religious convert and preached
sermons on Sundays--covered the whole of them:</p>

<pre>
True patriots we, for, be it understood,
We left our country for our country's good.
No private views disgraced our generous zeal,
What urged our travels was our country's weal.

<h3>CHAPTER VI - GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNORS</h3>

<blockquote><b>System of government--An autocracy--Hunter's
governorship--His difficulties--Recalled--King's governorship--The rum
traffic--Bligh's governorship--John Macarthur--His arrest and
trial--Deposition of Bligh.</b></blockquote>

<p>Until the year 1823 the government of New South Wales was vested
entirely in the Governor, who worked under the control of the Secretary
of State for the Home Department, or, later, the Secretary for War and
the Colonies; for there was no separate Colonial Minister till 1854.
The Governor during this period had no local council to advise him or
check him. He might consult the Judge Advocate on judicial questions,
or the Surveyor-General as to what roads and buildings should be
constructed, or the Commissary about supplies; but whether he did or
not was for himself to determine. They were his subordinates; he was an
autocrat, wielding the widest powers, amenable to no criticism but that
of the Minister in England.</p>

<p>According to the Governor's will a condemned man might be put to
death or reprieved. There was no court of appeal beyond him. He granted
pardons according to his own judgement or caprice. One day two
prisoners presented petitions for pardons to Governor King. One
petition was signed by nearly all the best-known men in Sydney, whilst
the other had only one name upon it.' The Governor asked the man who
presented the latter why he had but one signature whilst the other had
so many. The man answered that he had lived as the assigned servant of
only one master, and knew nobody else. King gave him a pardon, but
dismissed the other applicant with the comment, 'As you know so many
rich friends, you do not need a pardon.'</p>

<p>The whole of the financial administration was in the Governor's
hands. He made grants of land and controlled the assignment of
servants. He restricted, like a modern Diocletian, the profits which
merchants might make, issued ordinances like a Solon, rewarded and
punished like a Tzar. When Governor Bligh was reproached with acting
against the law, he exclaimed, 'The law, sir? I am the law!' And he was
not far wrong.</p>

<p>The Governor was appointed by the Secretary of State. The first
three Governors received a salary of 1,000 pounds a year; the fourth
and his successors received 2,000 pounds. When settlement extended to
Norfolk Island, Hobart, and Port Dalrymple, Lieutenant-Governors were
appointed at each of those places, and they were paid 450 pounds per
annum.</p>

<p>The Governor appointed the civil officers, some of whom--but never
the judicial officers--were emancipists. At one time grave perplexities
were occasioned because a clerk in the Governor's office took bribes
from convicts to alter the papers recording their sentences, so that
some who were sent out for life had the sentence cut down to seven
years. The fraud was not discovered till much confusion had arisen, and
doubtless some whom their friends in England had never
expected--probably never wished--to see again, returned home.</p>

<p>The first four Governors were naval captains, and three of them,
Phillip, Hunter, and King, were with the First Fleet. John Hunter
entered upon his duties in 1795 in the vexatious circumstances which
have already been described, with an Augean stable to cleanse and a
besom which was not adapted for clean sweeping. He was an honest,
sincere, conscientious man, whose acts and words often suggest a
sensitiveness of feeling which was out of harmony with his rough
environment. He was described by one who was subject to him as 'a
perfect gentleman in his manners, gracious and condescending to all,
without compromising his dignity, personal or official.' But the
officers who during the interim when Grose ruled had learnt how to make
profits from rum and general trading were determined not to lose this
lucrative but discreditable business, and they worked secretly and
openly to frustrate the Governor's efforts at reform. Behind his back
they weakened his authority, and they found the, Secretary of State
willing to lean his ear to anonymous charges against his
administration. A man of more ruthless determination might have crushed
the evils which Hunter had to fight, but he could not have done it
without making enemies, and the enemies that Hunter made were too
numerous and too cunning for him. He was ill supported by the
authorities in England, who recalled him in 1800 with a grudging
recognition of the value of his services and no appreciation of the
magnitude of his difficulties.</p>

<p>Philip Gidley King was altogether a stronger ruler than his
predecessor. He was capable of meeting a situation by an audacious
assumption of royal authority, and when he did not think that an
English Act of Parliament which applied to the colony was stiff enough
in its terms, he would alter it by a stroke of his own pen. There are
in existence orders issued by King as 'His Majesty's commands,' which
in fact were simply his own commands. He, Governor King, was THE King,
when he thought it necessary to take strong measures. He attacked the
rum traffic and the private trading of officers with energy; but he had
to acknowledge that 'every step I took clashed so much with the
interest of trading individuals, both commissioned as well as
non-commissioned, that all set their wits to work not only to thwart my
exertions but also to use every measure that art, cunning, and fraud
could suggest, to impede my efforts.'</p>

<p>An evil especially injurious to the spread of settlement which had
grown out of the iniquitous rum traffic, was that of persons of small
means to whom grants of land had been made, mortgaging their properties
and bartering their live stock to officers for spirits, which these
officers only, on account of their monopoly, could supply. A farmer had
been known to sell his property for a gallon of rum, and several
officers had become large and wealthy landowners by acquiring estates
in this manner. King therefore had to cope with what he described as
'the artifice of thieves and the duplicity of the tools I have to
govern,' and the task was as baffling as it was unpleasant. At the
beginning of his term he found that 'the cellars, from the better sort
of people to the blackest characters among the convicts, are full of
that fiery poison.' He even established a brewery with Government
funds, in the hope of preventing the thirst for spirits by encouraging
the consumption of beer; but lost money on the venture 'owing to the
description of people it was necessary to employ.' He forbade trading
by officers, but could not entirely eradicate it; he prohibited the
importation of rum, but still the place was 'inundated ' with it. So
much were some of his officers his open enemies, that they would not
attend Government House even on His Majesty's birthday, and they only
just stopped short of open defiance of the Governor's orders. King did
secure a measure of success with his reforms, but it was hard to get
right done through officers who regarded themselves as ill used in
being prohibited from doing wrong. It is not wonderful that a tone of
weariness and disappointment is apparent in King's correspondence
towards the close of his governorship.</p>

<p>His successor, Captain William Bligh, was well known in connection
with the famous mutiny of the BOUNTY before he accepted the
Governorship of New South Wales. He had been a junior officer under
Captain Cook, and had commanded a ship under Nelson at the battle of
Copenhagen. He owed his appointment to Sir Joseph Banks, who was
supposed by English ministers to know more about New South Wales than
any other Englishman, and was frequently consulted about its affairs.
Banks certainly was well informed about the drift to the bad which had
occurred under Grose, of Hunter's failure to stem the riotous tide of
rum, and of King's difficulties with the military officers. He knew
that a strict disciplinarian was required, and he thought Bligh was the
most suitable man for the position.</p>

<p>Bligh's insistence on discipline was indeed sufficiently stiff, but
unfortunately he was also a quarrelsome, ill-tempered, coarse-speaking
man. His manner of doing business with those who had to see him was
repellent. He would, with no regard for the dignity of his position,
pour forth a stream of personal abuse, loaded with dire threats; and if
he felt angry with any one he would blurt out his displeasure, no
matter where he was--on the parade ground, in the street, in his own
house, or in church. One who had experience of the Governor in his
tantrums wrote that he would not brook contradiction or protest; 'his
features became distorted, he foamed at the mouth, stamped on the
ground, and shook his fist in the face of the person so presuming.' He
was a law unto himself, and he said so. It can hardly be contended that
Bligh's acts were more arbitrary than those of his predecessors, and he
had the same refractory material to deal with; but his manner soon made
him hated by those who came into personal contact with him, and at
length brought about the mutiny by which he was deposed from
office.</p>

<p>The man who hated Bligh most, and was in turn heartily detested by
him, was John Macarthur. He had come out to Sydney as a lieutenant in
the New South Wales Corps, and was one of those officers who profited
from private trading in rum and general merchandise. One of his
enterprises, the breeding of sheep and the improvement of the quality
of wool, conferred very great benefits upon Australia and the world at
large. For that valuable work Macarthur is best known. From wool he
derived a considerable part of his ample fortune. A strong-willed,
hot-tempered person, affectionate in his circle of friends but equally
strong in his antipathies, he would strain every nerve to get his own
way. He had quarrelled with the last two Governors, whose authority he
had endeavoured to undermine. Hunter described him as a 'busy-body,'
and a man who had 'employed the whole of his time in this country in
sowing discord and enriching himself by means truly disgraceful.' King
said that Macarthur would stop at nothing which 'art, cunning, and a
pair of basilisk eyes can afford.'</p>

<p>When Bligh assumed the governorship in 1806 John Macarthur was the
richest man in New South Wales, and he was fully conscious of the power
which his wealth gave to him. He had retired from the regiment after a
violent quarrel with King, who had put him under arrest for fighting a
duel, and had sent him home for trial. On his return to Sydney he
applied his energetic abilities especially to sheep-breeding and wool
production, and was granted 5,000 acres of land at Camden to encourage
his breeding experiments. In 1805 he owned one-third of the sheep in
the colony, and these were for the most part merinos, which produced
the finest fleeces. Differences between Bligh and Macarthur arose
within a few months of the arrival of the new Governor, and each of
them had means of annoying the other. The quarrels of two obstinate men
would have no historical interest except that the culminating one led
to a mutiny against the Governor's rule. Bligh was determined to crush
the trade in spirits, and to punish those who engaged in it. He found
that, notwithstanding the efforts of his predecessor, rum had secured
such a hold over the life of the community that it was used as a
currency; people paid for clothing, food, tools, and goods of all kinds
in rum. This pernicious traffic, Bligh said, must stop, and he imposed
severe penalties on any who were found to engage in it,</p>

<p>A few months after Bligh issued this order two stills for the making
of spirits were sent out from London, one of them being consigned to
Macarthur. He said that he had not ordered it; his London agent had
sent it out amongst a cargo of general merchandise, as a speculation.
The Governor ordered the seizure of the still. Macarthur, made no
objection to the taking of the head and worm, the parts which made the
apparatus useful as a still, but said that he intended to keep the
copper boilers for his own domestic use. But Bligh was not satisfied,
and ordered the seizure of the coppers also. Thereupon Macarthur
brought an action against the officer who took them, for illegal
seizure of his goods; and the Court (though the decision was not
unanimous), recorded the verdict that the officer had not been
authorised in seizing them. The Governor was much annoyed with the
result, especially as it followed upon a fiery address to the Court by
Macarthur, wherein he had asked whether it was true that a British
subject was liable to have his property wrested from him without any
other reason being assigned than that it was the Governor's order.</p>

<p>Macarthur had flung down the gage of battle to Bligh, and it was
soon taken up. He was part owner of a trading schooner, the PARRAMATTA,
which, upon a cruise. to Tahiti, had unwittingly carried a convict
stowaway from Sydney. Owners of vessels incurred penalties for carrying
away prisoners, and in this case the Governor commanded the forfeiture
of a bond of 900 pounds into which the owners of the PARRAMATTA had
entered. Macarthur determined to abandon the vessel rather than pay,
and, as he ceased to provide for the crew, they went ashore. But it was
forbidden by the port regulations for ship owners to permit their
sailors to be at large in the convict settlement, and Macarthur was
summoned before the Judge-Advocate, Atkins, to answer for the offence.
Macarthur refused to attend because he had abandoned the ship to the
Government, which therefore, he held, became responsible for her and
her crew. There were other disputes. Macarthur had lent money to
Atkins, and could not sue him because he presided over the only Court
which could deal with such a case. He therefore appealed to the
Governor, whose friend Atkins was, pointing out the absurdity of
issuing a writ calling upon the Judge-Advocate to 'bring himself before
himself,' and adjudicate in his own case. There was another quarrel
with the Governor about a piece of leased land on which Macarthur
wished to build. He was prohibited from so doing by Bligh's order.</p>

<p>In short, these two men, the one the Governor of the colony, the
other the richest and most influential man in it, both self-willed
'supermen,' had got at cross purposes. They were out of temper with
each other, and violence was bound to ensue.</p>

<p>On December 16, 1807, Macarthur was arrested on a warrant issued by
Atkins, and was brought to trial on a formidable indictment drawn up
under the direction of the same person, who, not being a lawyer (though
he was Judge-Advocate), obtained the assistance of a drunken convict
solicitor. It specified a long list of charges against Macarthur, whom
it described as 'a malicious and seditious man, of depraved mind and
wicked and diabolical disposition,' and, further, as 'a person of evil
disposition and dishonest conversation.'</p>

<p>The members of the Court which sat to try Macarthur on January 25,
1808, were six members of the New South Wales Corps, presided over by
the Judge-Advocate. But the prisoner naturally objected to being tried
by his debtor, Atkins, with whom he was notoriously at enmity. The
officers accordingly objected to sit with Atkins, who thereupon retired
from the bench, but maintained that the Court was not properly
constituted without him. Bligh upheld this opinion, sending to the
officers the message, 'You are no Court without the
Judge-Advocate.'</p>

<p>The extraordinary position was thus created that the prisoner had
objected to the presence of the Judge-Advocate upon the bench and that
his objection had been upheld by the other members of the Court; that
the Governor had declared that the Court was not properly constituted
without the Judge-Advocate; and that meanwhile Macarthur continued a
prisoner, the six officers contending that he was answerable to them,
since they had been sworn to try him, the Governor that they had no
right to try him. So that the Governor had brought himself into sharp
conflict with the officers of the only military force in the
colony.</p>

<p>On January 26 Bligh summoned them to appear before him at Government
House, to answer for 'certain crimes' with which the Judge-Advocate had
charged them; and on the same day he sent a message to the commanding
officer of the corps, Major George Johnston, informing him that he
intended to arrest the six officers for treasonable practices. Early in
the morning of the same day Macarthur's bail had been disregarded, and
he had been lodged in the common jail.</p>

<p>While these things were occurring there was intense excitement in
the colony. The arrest of Macarthur had naturally aroused feeling
against the Governor; for while Macarthur had many enemies, some moved
by envy, some because they had come in conflict with his masterful
temper, he also had troops of firm friends. To Macarthur's adherents,
increased by those who, though not liking him, felt that he had not
been fairly treated, were now added the whole of the military. In
addition there were many who had grievances against the Governor on a
variety of grounds, most of them relating to his abusive manner and his
arbitrary actions. Wentworth, one of the colonial surgeons, was amongst
the number. There were others whose dissatisfaction had no more
justifiable foundation than that they had profited from dealing in rum,
and realized that Bligh's determined action would ruin that trade.</p>

<p>Major Johnston, who resided at some distance from Sydney, found,
when he drove in on the afternoon of the 26th, that groups of soldiers
and civilians were conversing excitedly in the streets, and that
'everything denoted terror and consternation.' His officers, backed up
by a number of influential people, urged him to use his force for the
arrest of Bligh. Johnston was a cool, mild-mannered, but resolute
officer, by no means turbulent by temperament. He stated, after the
occurrence of the events to be described, that he was convinced that
unless he placed the unpopular Governor under arrest there would be an
insurrection, 'and that the blood of the colonists would be upon my
head.' An immense number of people, 'comprising all the respectable
inhabitants except those who were immediately connected with Governor
Bligh,' had rushed into the barrack square, and urged him to take
decisive measures. That he acted from a conscientious sense of duty is
hardly questionable.</p>

<p>Johnston first gave the order for the liberation of John Macarthur
from prison, and sent soldiers to see that it was executed. The jailer
complied with his command. Macarthur then joined the throng in the
barrack square; and he it was who drew up--using a gun for a writing
desk--the requisition to Johnston begging him to place the Governor
under arrest and to assume command of the colony, and pledging those
who signed to support him with their fortunes and their lives.</p>

<p>It is clear that Major Johnston had resolved to depose Bligh before
the liberation of Macarthur. He had signed the order for release as
Lieutenant-Governor, and could not have taken so decisive a step as to
order the release of a prisoner unless he had been prepared to accept
full responsibility for his action.</p>

<p>It was now late in the afternoon of January 26, about an hour before
sunset. Johnston determined to arrest the Governor before the close of
the day. He placed himself at the head of his soldiers, and, with the
drums beating to the rhythm of 'The British Grenadiers,' and the
regimental colours floating in the air, the redcoats swung out of the
barrack square and marched towards Government House. Bligh from an
upper window saw them coming. He already knew what the intention was,
for Johnston had sent him a letter informing him that the respectable
inhabitants had charged him with crimes that rendered him 'unfit to
exercise the supreme authority another moment in this colony.'</p>

<p>The soldiers, on arrival at Government House, were drawn up in line
opposite the gates, with pieces of artillery presented against the
building, while four officers and a number of troops were sent inside
to execute the arrest.</p>

<p>The entrance of the soldiers was for a short while blocked by the
Governor's daughter, but she was respectfully moved aside, and a search
of the house for Bligh was commenced. Some difficulty was experienced
in finding him. The Governor himself heard them 'rummaging all the
outhouses and searching the grounds,' while he, in full uniform with
his medal on his breast and his sword by his side, was in a lumber-room
tearing up some official papers and stuffing others inside his
waistcoat. The lance-corporal who at length found him deposed on oath
that he was hiding under a bed, whence he had to be dragged forth.
Bligh emphatically denied this statement, though he admitted that he
had concealed himself in order that he might, by gaining time, see
whether anything could be done for the restoration of his authority. To
suppose that a man with Bligh's record was hiding on account of fear
would assuredly do him an injustice; but that he really was hiding is
not to be doubted. The soldiers were searching a considerable time
before he was found. Major Johnston reported that he was 'discovered in
a situation too disgraceful to be mentioned,' and another contemporary
supplies the picturesque detail that when he emerged his uniform 'was
befouled with white feathers.'</p>

<p>That night the streets of Sydney were illuminated. There were
bonfires and festivities; and a little later several shops erected
signboards whereon the 'ever-memorable January 26' were symbolized by
the brush of some colonial Dick Tinto. One of these paintings
represented Major Johnston in Highland uniform, standing with his foot
upon a snake and his sword-point through its head, while close by stood
a female figure presenting him with a cap of liberty--an ironical
allegory, surely, to meet the gaze of most of the inhabitants of Sydney
at this time.</p>

<p>It must in fairness to Bligh be added that he seems to have been
popular amongst the farming class, who appreciated the efforts he had
made to suppress the spirit traffic; he had been their friend when the
properties of many of them had been ruined by flood; but, from the
nature of their occupation, they would not have had much personal
contact with him. A more dependable witness was George Cayley, the
botanist, who, while thinking that Bligh was unfit to be Governor
because deficient in policy, thoroughly disapproved of the violent act
of deposition, and blamed Macarthur as the real author of it.</p>

<p>After the arrest of Bligh and pending action by the British
Government, affairs were administered under the direction of officers
of the New South Wales Corps, with John Macarthur occupying the
position of Colonial Secretary without salary. But, able as he was, his
temperament was not calculated to win popularity, and if he had
continued long in the exercise of power there probably would have been
another revolution. The Secretary of State was very slow to act after
the news of the mutiny reached England. That event occurred in January
1808, and it was not until December 1809 that a successor to Bligh
arrived in Port Jackson.</p>

<p>When an inquiry into the mutiny was made in England Johnston was
sentenced to be cashiered, with an addendum to the decree of the
court-martial admitting that he had had to face novel and extraordinary
circumstances calling for immediate decision. He returned to New South
Wales, and lived there upon his farm, a much-respected man, for the
remainder of his life. John Macarthur, who went to England to give
evidence, could not, without danger of arrest, return to Australia
until 1817, and suffered a chafing exile of eight years. Bligh was
promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral, but was not again entrusted with
public office.</p>

<p>The settlement at Port Jackson, together with its extensions at
Parramatta and on the Hawkesbury River, occupied an area which,
compared with the total bulk of Australia, was but an insignificant
fragment. It was not so large as is the island of Corsica in comparison
with the size of Europe. What the continent was like, even in outline,
was not known until fifteen years after the First Fleet arrived. That
it was a continent at all, and not a cluster of islands, was not known.
That Van Diemen's Land was isolated was not known. What the inland
territory was like was not known. There was an immense field of labour
for explorers to cover, both by sea and land.</p>

<p>The first problem of exploration which occupied attention was that
of finding a way across the mountains into the heart of the country.
The interior of New South Wales is an immense plain. Ages ago there
were mountains upon it. The sea covered a large part of it. But the
hills have been worn down, dissolved, washed away and spread out by the
rains and the floods of millions of years. For it must be remembered
that, although Australia was the latest of the continents to be
discovered and peopled by the white race, it is geologically an
inconceivably ancient land. It is full of the stumps of old mountains,
once ten or twenty thousand feet high, which have been ground away by
water and weather much as a sugar-loaf might be reduced by rubbing away
its top and sides. Upon the interior plains there are great stretches
of soil as level as a bowling-green, through which you can bore for
hundreds of feet without striking any rock. This plain comes to an end
at the slopes of the range of mountains which, like vertebrae, stretch
north and south from Cape York to Wilson's Promontory. There are gaps
between, but the dividing line of the mountains is well marked
throughout. In some places they oppose a stubborn barrier to a
crossing.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-13"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-13.jpg"></p>

<p>The difficulty experienced in traversing this range did not consist
in the height of the mountains. They run up to seven thousand feet
(Mount Kosciusco attains 7,328 and Mount Townsend 7,238), but the
section lying at the back of Sydney does not exceed 4,500 feet. The
difficulty lay in the tumbled, chaotic fashion in which these hills, or
rather, this broken plateau of sandstone, was found to crumple into
deep, sheer precipices, open into impenetrable gorges, fling rocky ribs
athwart the gaps, and toss tree-crested ridges one behind the other
defiantly. The explorer pushed up a valley, and found that it ended in
a rugged wall with trees above him; he pursued the line of a spur, and
found himself peering over the edge of a ravine with trees below him.
There seemed to be no valley leading through.</p>

<p>East of this mass lay the somewhat narrow and wrinkled slope
fringing the sea, where Sydney was situated. To the early inhabitants,
the distant mountains, wrapped in an atmosphere of perpetual purple,
were a region of mystery, to many a gateway of hope; to some they
proved a lure to delusion and death. They were so blue, and so soft to
the distant view, that a superstition sprang up that delectable lands
lay on the farther side of them; so that Governor King, after some had
perished, had to issue an order denouncing the story as being 'as
wicked as it is false, and calculated to bring the believers in it to
destruction.'</p>

<p>With the extension of settlement it became a matter of necessity to
penetrate beyond the mountains; but apart from this there were
adventurous spirits to whom the exploration had attractions for its own
sake. Captain William Paterson, in 1793, led a party of Scottish
Highlanders to the attack; in 1794 Henry Hacking made an attempt; in
1796, Surgeon George Bass took rope ladders and grappling-irons for a
vigorous assault; in 1804 George Cayley described an attempt which he
led as being like travelling 'over the tops of houses in a town,' and,
though himself a man of remarkable bodily strength and enthusiasm, and
having with him a good equipment and 'the strongest men in the colony
to assist him,' had to admit that he was beaten. After receiving
Cayley's report, Governor King confessed that perseverance in an
endeavour to cross such 'a confused and barren assemblage of mountains
with impassable chasms between would be as chimerical as useless.' Even
the crows which Cayley's party saw seemed to them to bear an appearance
of having lost their way.'</p>

<p>It was not until 1813 that Gregory Blaxland, Lieutenant Lawson, and
a young student, William Charles Wentworth, starting from near Penrith,
cut their way through the thick scrub and timber, scrambled and
clambered with slow and toilsome steps for fifteen days along the range
towards Mount York, and, skirting that obstacle, saw the great green
Bathurst Plains lying west of them. They knew that they had conquered
the task at which others had failed so signally that a tradition of
insuperableness had grown up about it; and it was with the pen of one
who knew the joy of discovery that Wentworth, three years later, in
competing for a Cambridge prize for poetry, described how</p>

<pre>
As a meteor shoots athwart the night
The boundless champaign burst upon our sight,
Till, nearer seen, the beauteous landscape grew,
Opening like Canaan on rapt Israel's view.
</pre>

<p>The route found by Blaxland and his companions was followed up by
Surveyor G. W. Evans, who descended the range on the far side,
traversed the plains to a point beyond Bathurst, and returned with the
glad tidings that the country across the mountains was equal to every
demand that could be made for the extension of pasture land and tillage
for centuries to come. These endeavours to master the Blue Mountains
were the precursors of many long inland journeys which made the story
of the exploration of Australia a romance tinged with tragedy.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-14"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-14.jpg"></p>

<p>The series of voyages by which the discovery of the continent by sea
was completed centres around the person of Matthew Flinders. This
celebrated navigator came out to Australia as a midshipman on the
RELIANCE, the vessel commissioned to convey Governor Hunter to New
South Wales in 1795. The ship's surgeon, George Bass, was animated by
an eager spirit, and his intellectual interest in the geographical
problems which then awaited solution was very keen. Flinders and Bass,
both Lincolnshire men, became close friends during the voyage, and laid
their plans for pursuing a course of discovery together.</p>

<p>Bass had brought out from England with him a tiny boat which he
called the <i>Tom Thumb</i>. She had only an eight-foot keel with a
five-foot beam--a mere tub of a boat. Yet, having no better craft
available, the two friends took her for a cruise out of Port Jackson
shortly after their arrival. They explored the George's River, and
presented to the Governor so good a report of what they found that he
established Bankstown there. A few months later (March 1796) Bass and
Flinders, in a second <i>Tom Thumb</i>, built in Sydney, again sailed
out of harbour, and ran south to Port Hacking, which they explored. It
was an exceedingly adventurous cruise, calling for all the seamanship
of which the two friends were capable. Several times they were nearly
capsized, and only saved themselves by the most dextrous management.
Falling amidst a party of aboriginals upon the banks of a small stream,
where they had landed to make some repairs and to dry their powder in
the sun, Flinders amused them by clipping their hair and beards with a
large pair of scissors, while Bass attended to the mending operations
and filled the casks with fresh water.</p>

<p>The taste of exploration obtained upon these two cruises whetted the
appetite of Bass and Flinders, who were fully aware of the valuable
discovery work remaining to be done upon the Australian coast; and the
keenness they showed in the tasks they set themselves induced Governor
Hunter to encourage them in further enterprises of a like character.
Ships' duties, however, prevented Flinders from accompanying his friend
on his next two expeditions. On the first of these Bass discovered coal
at the place now called Coalcliff, about twenty miles south of Botany
Bay, and was thus the first to direct attention to the presence of coal
deposits, which have since yielded an enormous part of the wealth of
New South Wales. On the second expedition, in a whaleboat lent to him,
with a crew of six bluejackets, by the Governor, Bass rounded the
south-east corner of the continent at Cape Howe, entered 'Bass Strait'
and discovered Westernport (January 1796), which he named 'from its
relative situation to every other known harbour on the coast.' It was,
in fact, the most important discovery that had been made since the
establishment of settlement in Australia.</p>

<p>Bass's whaleboat voyage showed the old belief that Van Diemen's Land
was a southern extension of New Holland to be improbable. He had not,
indeed, positively demonstrated the existence of a strait, though the
south-westerly swell which rolled in upon Westernport convinced him
that there was one. The strait was proved, and Van Diemen's Land was
circumnavigated, by Bass and Flinders together in the <i>Norfolk</i> in
1798. This was the last piece of exploration in which Bass
participated. For Flinders, who published an account of the voyage, it
was an achievement which brought him under the notice of his English
superiors as a navigator of high capacity who was worthy to be
entrusted with more important tasks. But Bass, after returning to
England, left the Navy, and when he came back to Australia in 1801 it
was as part owner of a trading ship, the Venus, carrying a general
cargo from which he hoped to derive substantial gains. Being
disappointed in this regard, he took his ship, in 1803, on a voyage to
the South American coast, whence he never returned. What became of this
high-spirited, accomplished, and brilliant man is an unsolved mystery.
The probability is that he expected to make a profit from participating
in the South American contraband trade, was captured by the
Spaniards--at Lima it was said--and kept there until he died. His name
lives in that of the strait which he discovered, and in the eulogium
written upon him by his affectionate friend and companion in adventure,
Flinders, who recorded that Bass's whale boat expedition 'has not
perhaps its equal in the annals of maritime history,' and that the man
himself had won an honourable place in the list of those whose ardour
stands most conspicuous for the promotion of useful knowledge.'</p>

<p>The explorations of Bass and Flinders had been undertaken on their
own initiative, in their spare time; but from the beginning of the
nineteenth century the task of completing the discovery of Australia
was taken in hand systematically. In 1800 a small 60-ton brig, the
<i>Lady Nelson</i>, was sent out under the command of Lieutenant James
Grant to assist in the work. She had been built to the design of
Captain John Schanck, with three sliding centreboard keels, which, by
enabling her draft to be lessened in shallow water, would permit her to
run close to a coast or into rivers. Grant was instructed to make the
voyage to Sydney through Bass Strait, the news of the discovery of that
passage having evoked much interest in England. Sighting the Australian
coast opposite the present boundary of Victoria and South Australia on
December 3, 1800, the <i>Lady Nelson</i> from this point sailed
parallel to a country which, as far as Bass's Westernport, was hitherto
unknown, and she was the first vessel to pass through the Strait
westward.</p>

<p>The <i>Lady Nelson</i> remained in the Australian service throughout
her highly adventurous career, until she was captured by pirates in
1825. The most important of the services rendered in her was the
discovery of Port Phillip in 1802. Grant had slipped across the opening
at the head of which this great bay stands, and there were some who
thought that further exploration would reveal the cleavage which was
believed to divide New South Wales on the east from New Holland on the
west. Under the command of Lieutenant John Murray, the ship was
commissioned to pursue detailed investigations on the south coast. A
complete survey of Westernport was made, and Murray then sent his mate,
Bowen, in the launch to examine the entrance to Port Phillip. Bowen
having found a practicable channel, Murray sailed into the great
harbour on February 15, 1802. He named it Port King, but the Governor
himself changed the name to Port Phillip, after the first ruler of New
South Wales.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the first newly discovered place in
the British dominions where the Union Jack was hoisted was Port
Phillip. The union of Great Britain and Ireland had been effected in
1800, and the flag which united the cross of St. Patrick with the
crosses of St. George and St. Andrew came into being shortly after.
Murray had one with him on the Lady Nelson, and he recorded in his
journal that he took possession of the port on March 8--'At eight
o'clock in the morning the united colours of the kingdoms of Great
Britain and Ireland were hoisted on board, and at one o'clock, under a
discharge of three volleys of small-arms and artillery, the port was
taken possession of in the name of his sacred Majesty George the
Third.'</p>

<p>Flinders had returned to England in 1800. Largely through the
influence of Sir Joseph Banks, he was appointed to the command of the
<i>Investigator</i>, with instructions to solve the remaining problems
affecting the geographical configuration of Australia. The task was
fulfilled in a masterly manner. Vigorous, diligent, highly trained for
scientific inquiry, with consummate seamanship and wonderful accuracy
in detail, Flinders justified his selection not only by the great
extent of his discoveries but by producing charts of such excellence
that they remain substantially sound and dependable to this day. He
arrived upon the Australian coast on December 6, 1801, and anchored in
King George's Sound--which had been discovered and named in 1791 by
Captain George Vancouver. The whole southern coastline of the continent
from the head of the Great Australian Bight to Encounter Bay was
discovered and mapped by Flinders. By pursuing Spencer's Gulf and St.
Vincent's Gulf to their extremities he demonstrated that there was no
strait splitting the country into islands. In the following year, 1803,
he circumnavigated Australia in the <i>Investigator</i>, and he
produced a map of the whole continent showing it to be one vast
island.</p>

<p>It was appropriate that the navigator who had done so much should be
the man to give to Australia the name which it bears. Flinders pointed
out that, inasmuch as the Dutch had known nothing of the eastern
coasts, their name, New Holland, could not be properly applied there;
whilst Cook's name, New South Wales, could not he attached to the
western portion. He did not invent the name Australia, for it had
already been suggested as a name for the southern region of the earth
lying between and to the south of South Africa and America; but he
urged that it 'was necessary to geographical precision that, New
Holland and New South Wales having now been demonstrated to be two
aspects of the same land, there should be one convenient name for it;
and Australia appeared to him to be both a convenient and an agreeable
one. Curiously enough, Banks and others opposed the use of it, and
Flinders was not allowed to publish the account of his voyage as <i>A
Voyage to Australia</i>, but as <i>A Voyage to Terra Australis</i>. But
the name which be recommended came gradually into general use in
consequence of the strong preference for it which he had expressed,
though for some years officially New Holland was still employed. In
1817 Governor Macquarie formally requested that in future Australia
should be adopted in despatches; and his successor, Brisbane, to whom a
daughter was born in Sydney, named her' Eleanor Australia,' to signify
his fondness for the name.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the career of Flinders as an explorer was crowded
with misfortunes. After the circumnavigation of Australia the
<i>Investigator</i>, an old ship when she was placed in this service by
the Admiralty, was too unseaworthy to permit of her further employment
in such researches, and Flinders decided to return to England, publish
his charts, and ask for another vessel. Taking a passage in the
<i>Porpoise</i>, he was wrecked on the Barrier Reef, off the Queensland
coast. He made his way in a small boat back to Sydney, where Governor
King could give him nothing better for making the voyage of 15,000
miles than the <i>Cumberland</i>, a wretched little 29-ton schooner,
'something less than a Gravesend packet boat.' But Flinders determined
to match his seamanship and courage against the waves of three oceans
in this diminutive craft. He successfully took her through Torres
Strait and into the Indian Ocean, but there heavy weather and the
failure of one of his pumps compelled him to seek shelter at Mauritius,
then a French colony bearing the name of Ile de France.</p>

<p>The military governor of the island, General Decaen, did not believe
Flinders's story that he was actually voyaging to Europe in so tiny a
ship, and in a flush of anger accused him of being a spy; for Great
Britain and France were then at war. Flinders was indignant at being
detained, especially as he carried a passport from the French
Government guaranteeing protection in French ports. The Governor,
however, objected that the passport was granted for the
<i>Investigator</i>, not for the <i>Cumberland</i>. Decaen modified his
demeanour after the first interview, and sent to Flinders an invitation
to dinner. But he was irritated by the suspicion of his BONA FIDES
expressed by Decaen, and refused to go. The Governor considered his
attitude insolent, and resolved to keep him a prisoner until his case
had been referred to the French Government. This unfortunate
misunderstanding, intensified by the anger of both men, was the cause
of the detention of, Flinders in Mauritius for six and a half years. He
did not return to England till 1810, and then only sufficient of life
was left to him for writing his <i>Voyage To Terra Australis</i> and
preparing his splendid atlas of original charts. He died in 1814, on
the very day when his book came from the publishers but he was then
unconscious and never saw it.</p>

<p>It was long believed that General Decaen did Flinders the further
gross wrong of taking from him his papers and drawings and sending them
to Paris to be copied, so as to enable the French officers to
appropriate to themselves the credit for work which he had done. This
charge, indeed, has been expressly made; but there is no justification
whatever for it. It is quite certain that the French never saw any of
Flinders's charts till he published them. The suspicion, however, was
not unnatural, since, in consequence of his long detention the official
history of Baudin's discovery expedition was published in Paris seven
years before the appearance of Flinders's <i>Voyage to Terra
Australis</i>; and it was accompanied by an atlas delineating coasts
which Flinders had undoubtedly discovered. But the French had been upon
the same coasts after him, and their charts were engraved from the
drawings of their own marine surveyors. Naturally the French drawings
were 'very like' those of Flinders, as those who launched the charge of
plagiarism were quick to point out. But they were 'like' because both
had worked upon the same coasts, and a critical comparison reveals
sufficient important differences to acquit the French officers of the
charge which was somewhat vehemently made against them at the time. No
ground for it was given by anything which Flinders said or wrote. He
thought that he had been wronged by Decaen, but he was chivalrous
towards his enemy, and he was incapable of anything like mean envy in
estimating the work of rivals in his own field.</p>

<p>While Flinders was pursuing his explorations on the southern coasts
of Australia in the <i>Investigator</i>, he met in Encounter Bay a
French vessel, the <i>Geographe</i>, under the command of Captain
Nicholas Baudin. It was known to him that a French discovery expedition
had been despatched to Australasian waters, because, before he left
England, a passport for its protection had been requested by the
Government of the Republic and had been granted by the Admiralty.
Nevertheless, the English navigator was much surprised to meet a
foreign ship in these uncharted seas, and, being uncertain as to what
her disposition might be, cleared the ship for action in case he should
be attacked.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-14a"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-14a.jpg"></p>

<p>But Baudin was engaged in a perfectly peaceful, scientific mission,
and no man less likely than he to lead an expedition with aggressive
intentions ever commanded a vessel. Neither by training nor temperament
was he the kind of officer whom the French Government would have
selected had their designs been such as has sometimes been
supposed.</p>

<p>The two commanders met in the late afternoon of April 8, 1802.
Flinders boarded the <i>Geographe</i> then, and again on the following
morning, when he breakfasted with Baudin and had amiable conversations
with him concerning their respective voyages. The French had left
Europe nine months before the <i>Investigator</i> sailed, and, had it
not been that Baudin was singularly dilatory he might have forestalled
Flinders in the most important of his discoveries. As one of the French
officers said to him when they met again at Port Jackson, 'Ah, captain,
if we had not been kept so long picking up shells and collecting
butterflies at Van Diemen's Land, you would not have discovered the
south coast before us.' As it was, the extent of fresh discovery made
by the French was not more than about a hundred and fifty miles, from
the mouth of the river Murray to Cape Banks, where Grant had come upon
the coast in the <i>Lady Nelson</i>.</p>

<p>When the French expedition returned to Europe, the history of the
voyage published at Paris was accompanied by an atlas containing a map
upon which the whole coastline from Wilson's Promontory to the head of
the Great Australian Bight was named Napoleon's Land ('Terre
Napoleon'). French names were also given to all the principal
geographical features of this great stretch of territory. Thus,
Spencer's Gulf was named Golfe Bonaparte, St. Vincent's Gulf was named
Golfe Josephine, and Kangaroo Island, which Flinders had discovered,
was named, after the French Minister of Marine, Ile Decres. Flinders,
at the time of the publication of this atlas, was held a prisoner in
Mauritius by General Decaen, in the circumstances which have already
been related, but the French officers knew that he had made these
discoveries, and that his detention prevented the publication of his
own work in advance of theirs.</p>

<p>In view of the bitter animosity and the jealousy existing between
the English and the French during the Napoleonic wars, it was not
unnatural that the appearance of Baudin's expedition in Australasian
waters and the publication of a map with the name 'Terre Napoleon' upon
it, should have given rise to the belief that the French Government
intended to seize some portion of the continent for colonizing
purposes. But such an inference is not warranted by the evidence. The
reason for placing Napoleon's name on the map is not far to seek.
Inasmuch as every other stretch of the coastline bore a name upon
current maps, it was not unnatural that the French should desire to
honour the ruler of their country by inscribing his name upon a portion
hitherto without one, and the fact that they did so by no means implies
that they entertained an intention of appropriating that region for
colonizing purposes. It was a piece of courtiership, in recognition of
the assistance which Napoleon had given in the equipment of the
expedition.</p>

<p>Baudin's voyage was not political in origin, and he himself was not
a naval officer. It was promoted by the Institute of France, a
scientific body, for the study of a region of the earth in which French
savants had for about half a century manifested much interest. There
had been previous French expeditions commanded by Bougainville, Marion
du Fresne, Laperouse, and Dentrecasteaux; and the purpose of Baudin's
did not differ from that of his predecessors. Napoleon Bonaparte had
been elevated to the head of the French Republic in 1799, after ten
years of revolutionary strife, and he was, as he said, anxious to make
his era illustrious not only for efficient government and brilliant
feats of arms, but also for high achievements in science, art, and
literature. When the Institute of France laid before him plans for a
discovery voyage to the South Seas in continuation of other French
voyages to the same region, he readily gave his assent and assistance.
But neither the published history of the voyage nor the private papers
connected with it which have since come to light justify the conclusion
that he had any intention of settling a French colony in Australia, or
that Captain Baudin made investigations with such an object in
view.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-15"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-15.jpg"></p>

<p>But the effect of the visit of Baudin's expedition was to create the
fear that if the British did not occupy other parts of the continent
the French would, and it therefore acted as a stimulus to the expansion
of settlement. There never was any better foundation for the fear than
suspicion, but that was quite sufficient. The Government did not desire
to have another penal colony, or another foreign colony of any kind, in
the vicinity of Port Jackson; and the British East India Company was
also concerned lest the French, whom they had ousted from India, should
set up a fresh menace to their security in addition to that already
existing at Mauritius. Governor King in 1803 came to the conclusion
that Van Diemen's Land might be occupied by the French if he did not
forestall them; so, without waiting for instructions from England, he
sent the <i>Lady Nelson</i> to choose a place for a settlement on the
River Derwent. Amongst the reasons which he gave in his despatch to the
Secretary of State explaining his plans, the first was 'the necessity
there appears of preventing the French gaining a foothold on the east
side of these islands.' In these circumstances a settlement was made in
the island which now bears the name of Tasmania.</p>

<p>The first attempt was at Risdon Cove, where in September 1803 a
small party of fifty people was landed under the direction of
Lieutenant John Bowen. But this place was afterwards found to be
inconvenient, and was abandoned when in 1804 Lieutenant-Colonel Collins
selected the site of the city of Hobart.</p>

<p>It was also suspicion of French designs which induced the first
attempt to form a settlement at Port Phillip. Since Murray discovered
the harbour in 1802, a fairly complete survey had been made of it by
Charles Grimes in 1803 in the <i>Cumberland</i>. Grimes and his survey
party discovered the river Yarra, which they penetrated to a distance
above the site of the present city of Melbourne; and if there had been
any real sincerity behind the settlement scheme, the colonization of
the state of Victoria would have been anticipated by over thirty years.
But in fact there was no positive need for expansion at this period.
There was ample room for the convicts and free settlers at Sydney. The
reports of Murray and Flinders as to the quality of the soil of Port
Phillip were highly encouraging, and it was of course desirable to keep
a hold upon such a fine harbour with a view to future requirements; but
the immediate reason why it was considered desirable to occupy the port
was frankly stated by Governor King to be 'from the probability of the
French having it in contemplation to make a settlement, which I cannot
help thinking is a principal object of their researches.'</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-16"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-16.jpg"></p>

<p>In October 1803, therefore, Lieutenant-Colonel David Collins arrived
in Port Phillip from England with two vessels, the <i>Calcutta</i> and
the <i>Ocean</i>, and a company of nearly three hundred convicts, a
guard of marines, and a civil staff. He made no attempt to find the
best site for a colony; he did not even send a boat to examine the
banks of the Yarra; he was simply content to unship his company on the
sandy peninsula which divides the eastern lobe of Port Phillip from the
ocean. Collins approached his task in a bad humour for forming a
permanent settlement, and almost from the hour of his arrival commenced
to write despatches deprecating the fitness of the port. One of his
officers, Lieutenant Tuckey, was of a more optimistic temperament, and
in a small book which he afterwards wrote about the experiment,
delivered himself of a rhetorical rhapsody on the probable future of
Port Phillip: 'I beheld a second Rome arising from a coalition of
banditti. I beheld it giving laws to the world, and, superlative in
laws and in arts, looking down with proud superiority upon the
barbarous nations of the northern hemisphere. Thus running over the
airy visions of Empire, wealth and glory, I wandered amidst the
delusions of imagination.' A convict named Buckley, who escaped at this
time, lived among the Port Phillip aboriginals for thirty-three
years.</p>

<p>Collins, much to his satisfaction, was permitted in June 1804 to
withdraw his whole company from Port Phillip and take them to the River
Derwent in Van Diemen's Land, where, as already stated, he changed the
site of the settlement from Risdon Cove to the beautiful position under
the shadow of Mount Wellington, then called Table Mountain.</p>

<p>A third settlement which was made lest the French should intervene
was at Port Dalrymple, on the north coast of Van Diemen's Land. The
Secretary of State was much impressed by the despatches received from
King concerning the operations of Baudin's expedition, and was
especially anxious that a foreign colony should not be planted in Bass
Strait, the importance of which as a trade route was now thoroughly
appreciated. It was to prevent such a contingency that the Port Phillip
experiment was authorised; and now again the Government considered that
it was 'in a political sense peculiarly necessary' that Port Dalrymple
should be occupied. Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson was chosen to command,
and he arrived there with a company of about one hundred and fifty
persons in November 1804. As at the Derwent, so at this new settlement,
the site originally chosen was not retained. York Town, Paterson's
settlement, was some miles from the present city of Launceston, and was
abandoned within a year and a half of its foundation.</p>

<p>Though there is no warrant in historical evidence for the old
suspicion that Napoleon's Government ever contemplated the founding of
a colony in Australia, and though Baudin's discovery expedition was not
connected with any such designs as were suspected at the time, it
cannot be asserted that the infant colony at Sydney was free from
danger during the Napoleonic wars. The Emperor himself was fully
informed as to its military weakness, and the French Governor at
Mauritius, General Decaen, was equally well advised. Peron, one of the
naturalists on Baudin's staff, on the homeward voyage supplied Decaen
with a memorandum full of information about the colony. He pointed out
how inadequate was the military force available to defend it, and
emphasized the special element of weakness arising from the presence of
a number of political prisoners. 'If ever the Government of our
country,' he said, 'should form the project of taking or destroying
this colony, at the mere mention of the French name every Irish arm
would be raised.' Napoleon was even supplied with precise information
as to how an attack upon Sydney could be made with excellent prospects
of success. It would be 'easy to accomplish,' by a descent through
Broken Bay, to the north; and Peron was of opinion that the new colony
'should be destroyed as soon as possible.' 'Today we could destroy it
easily; we shall not be able to do so in twenty-five years' time.' If
the conditions had been favourable the attempt would undoubtedly have
been made. In 1810, when the French colony at Mauritius was languishing
for lack of supplies, Napoleon wrote a despatch to the Governor
expressly directing him to 'take the English colony at Port Jackson,
where considerable resources will be found.' But in 1810 Great Britain
held the command of the sea with so vigorous a grip that no French act
of aggression against a British colony anywhere was possible. So far
from General Decaen being able to send an expedition against Port
Jackson, he could not even hold his own in Mauritius; which was then
being closely blockaded by a British squadron. Nelson's victory at
Trafalgar, by shattering French naval power, made the oversea
possessions of his country as secure as Manchester or London.</p>

<p>Sea power, indeed, as it guaranteed the security of Port Jackson and
the few tiny settlements which had sprung from it, also ensured the
integrity of Australia as a field for exclusively British colonizing
effort during the nineteenth century. After the downfall of Napoleon at
Waterloo there were several renewals of the suspicion that the French
intended to colonize somewhere on the continent. It was natural that
this feeling should recur when the French began again to turn their
attention to such opportunities as might be open for replacing the
colonial empire which they had lost during the Napoleonic wars.
Australia, at the beginning of the second quarter of the century, was
still a great empty continent, with one growing colony and a few
sporadic offshoots on its eastern seaboard and two insignificant
settlements in Van Diemen's Land. Not a rood of ground was occupied
anywhere else. A few sealers had huts for occasional use in Westernport
and on King Island; a whaling crew might sometimes land in bays which
were frequented by their prey. But there was no settlement. Tribes of
black aboriginals roamed over vast tracts of fertile country which had
never rung under the hoof of a horse and where the bleat of sheep had
never been heard. This enormous area of habitable territory, in a mild
and healthy climate, was a standing temptation to any European
Government which cast a glance upon the map with a view to securing
oversea dominion. At this time the only possible colonizing rival to
Great Britain was France. Spain was in process of rapid disintegration
as a colonial power; Portugal clung to what she had, but nourished no
hope of reviving her former glories; Holland remained at Java, but was
neither eager nor able to expand. No other European nation gave a
serious thought to colonial development.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-17"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-17.jpg"></p>

<p>But in 1824 it became known that the French Government was sending
another exploring vessel, the <i>Astrolabe</i>, to the south seas,
under the command of Dumont D'Urville. Purely scientific purposes were
professed; and a few years later the British Government came to the
conclusion that the professions were genuine, the Secretary of State
then describing the suspicions as 'certain false rumours which had
reached the Government as to the intentions of a foreign power to
establish a colony.' But, as in 1802-4, so in 1824-7, the very
existence of the rumours and suspicions, and the proximity of the
French vessel, had the effect of galvanizing the administration into
activity. Moreover, just as in 1802-4 three strategic posts were
occupied, at Port Phillip, the Derwent, and Port Dalrymple, so again in
1824-7 three strategic posts were selected--one on the south, at
Westernport, a second on the west at Albany, and a third on the north
at Melville Island.</p>

<p>So anxious, indeed, was Governor Darling in regard to claims which
he thought the French might make, that he wrote to the Imperial
Government directing attention to the fact that his commission as
Governor did not give him command over the whole continent, and
suggesting that a change in that respect should forthwith be made. The
commissions of all the Governors until after Brisbane's time (1821-5)
defined their jurisdiction as extending westward as far as the 135th
parallel, because, as already pointed out, it was not definitely known
in the beginning that New Holland and New South Wales were the western
and the eastern sides of one great island. But the voyages of Flinders
had demonstrated that it was so; and the further researches of Captain
Phillip King in 1818-22 had shown that Melville and Bathurst Islands,
on the extreme north of the continent, would be valuable possessions.
But they were not within the area bounded on the west by the 135th
parallel; they were just outside it. In 1824 both islands were formally
annexed in the name of the British sovereign by Captain Gordon Bremer
of H.M.S. <i>Tamar</i>, who established a small convict settlement on
Melville Island. When, therefore, Darling was appointed Governor of New
South Wales in 1825, his commission shifted the western boundary from
the 135th to the 129th parallel so as to embrace these two islands. But
still the western coasts of Australia were not included; and when the
French once more appeared upon the scene Darling considered that it
would not be easy to satisfy them that the British had prior claims, if
they desired to establish themselves on the west of the continent. He
therefore made the audacious suggestion that the Government should send
out to him a fresh commission ante-dated from the time of his
appointment, wherein he should be described as Governor of the whole of
Australia. If this ingenious plan were adopted it would, he said,
'prevent any appearance of an arrangement to answer a particular
purpose.' Fortunately it was not found necessary to resort to such an
act of diplomatic deceit, for the French captain, Dumont D'Urville,
when he visited various parts of Australia in 1826, showed no intention
of laying claim to territory anywhere.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-18"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-18.jpg"></p>

<p>The Westernport settlement (November 1826), commanded by Captain
Wright, consisted of about fifty persons, half of them convicts. It did
not endure for much more than a year. By the end of 1828 it had become
certain that the French were not to be feared, and, the post having
served its purpose, it was abandoned. The Melville Island settlement
was in 1827 transferred to Raffles Bay on the mainland. The Albany
settlement at King George's Sound was more important, because Major
Edmund Lockyer, who was appointed to the command there, was instructed
by the Governor that if the French appeared he was to inform them that
the whole of Australia was 'subject to his Brittanic Majesty's
Government.' This amounted to an official claim to the whole continent,
now for the first tme asserted. Lockyer formally annexed the territory
on January 21, 1827. Further, the Albany settlement became permanent,
and was brought within the jurisdiction of the colony of Western
Australia in 1831.</p>

<p>The action of Governor Darling in instructing Lockyer to assert the
British claim to the possession of all Australia--though the French
never appeared to give him the opportunity of making it to them--was
confirmed in 1829. In that year Captain Fremantle of the
<i>Challenger</i>, acting under instructions from England, took
possession of the Swan River--where, as will hereafter be related, it
was then proposed to found a new colony--and formally laid claim to
'all that part of New Holland which is not included within the
territory of New South Wales.' Lord John Russell, who was Secretary of
State for the Colonies ten years after this date (1839-41), related in
his <i>Recollections</i> that one day a gentleman attached to the
French Government called to see him and asked him how much of Australia
was claimed as the dominion of Great Britain. Lord John answered 'The
whole,' and with that the official had to be content. At that time
there were settlements on every coast of the continent, so that the
British claim had been made substantially good by occupation. But it
was the pre-eminence in sea power won by Great Britain during the
Napoleonic wars, and maintained during the years when Australia was in
its infancy, that enabled this great and salutary assertion to be
sustained.</p>

forces sent to Australia--Demand for a council--The emancipist
question--The Governor's policy--His difficulties with military
officers--Trial by jury--Quarrels with the Bent brothers--Emancipist
attorneys--Macquarie's autocracy.</b></blockquote>

<p>After the Bligh mutiny the governing authorities in England came to
the conclusion that a change was required in the kind of man selected
to govern New South Wales. It had formerly been regarded as essential
that the Governor should be a post-captain in the Navy. But it had
become clear that the local military force--the New South Wales
Corps--really dominated the situation. Its officers had thwarted,
insulted, and defied the chosen representatives of the Sovereign, and
there could be no peace and security in the colony until this corps was
firmly set back into disciplined obedience or wiped out of existence.
It was necessary, wrote the Secretary of State, to place the Government
'on a more respectable basis.'</p>

<p>Therefore it was determined that Bligh should be succeeded by a
military officer, who should go out to Sydney in command of an English
regiment. Colonel Lachlan Macquarie of the 73rd--a Highland regiment
since merged in the Black Watch--was chosen for the service, and he was
ordered to take his battalion with him. Macquarie had had a creditable
military career of over thirty years. He was a man of thoroughly
dependable character, gentlemanly in his manners, kindly but firm, with
the pride of a pedigreed Highland laird, the paternal authority of a
Hebrew patriarch, the masterful self-sufficiency of a Norman baron, and
the personal rectitude of an English squire. Macquarie arrived at Port
Jackson with his seven hundred Highlanders in December 1809, and he
continued to rule the colony till December 1821, a longer period of
continuous administration than has been filled by any other Australian
Governor. He had no trouble with the New South Wales Corps, because he
had a superior force under his command, and it ceased to exist shortly
after he gathered the reins of government into his hands. About three
hundred of its members joined the 73rd regiment, nearly four hundred
were sent to England, whilst a hundred who wished to remain in the
colony (to which, Macquarie reported, they had become much attached')
were permitted to do so. From this time forth until 1870 troops
belonging to the Imperial Army were constantly stationed in
Australia.</p>

<p>Macquarie governed the colony in no less arbitrary a manner than his
predecessors had done, but his mode of enforcing his will made his
government less objectionable. 'I cannot but think the present Governor
as arbitrary as Bligh,' wrote John Macarthur only that he has a manner
of reconciling people to his measures.' At the beginning of his period
the suggestion was made that a council should be formed to advise him,
and a definite proposal to that effect was formulated by a House of
Commons Committee on Transportation which sat in 1812. But the
Secretary of State was not inclined to limit the scope of the
Governor's powers by setting up a body which, in the natural course of
things, would sometimes dissent from his policy. Parties would thereby
be formed, and it was feared that the weakening of the Governor's
authority in a community composed of somewhat discordant elements would
be mischievous. Macquarie, when the report of the committee was
communicated to him, fervently expressed 'a fond hope that a council
would never be set up in New South Wales.' He thoroughly believed in
the exercise of undivided power.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the very suggestion of a council brought into being a
party which began to work for one; and as the number of free settlers
increased the demand became more insistent. Macquarie was, indeed, the
last of the purely arbitrary Governors. He finished his own eleven
years' course of benevolent autocracy beyond the effective reach of
criticism except from Downing Street; but the demand made after 1812
bore fruit when the next Governor was appointed, and was the real
beginning of the movement towards popular government in Australia.</p>

<p>The outstanding question which arose during Macquarie's governorship
related to the official and social recognition which should be extended
to emancipists. Such a question inevitably presented itself in a colony
founded primarily for the reception of convicts, but wherein there was
a considerable population, increasing every year, of persons who had
never been under sentence. Moreover, these free settlers were on the
whole the wealthier class. In 1810 there were 2,804 adult persons in
New South Wales who had not been convicts, and these owned 145,000
acres, whilst there were 16,428 convicts or emancipists, the latter of
whom owned 192,000 acres. The free people were inclined to look upon
themselves as a moral aristocracy, and to regard the emancipists with
some disdain. But Macquarie insisted that as New South Wales had been
originally occupied purely as a penal colony, and in the hope of
reforming malefactors, it was unjust that any stigma should attach to
those who had endured the ordeal imposed upon them and had become free
in the eyes of the law. This principle he stated in plain terms in a
despatch. 'Once a convict has become a free man,' he said, 'he should
in all respects be considered on a footing with every other man in the
colony, according to his rank in life and character.'</p>

<p>It cannot be supposed that a man of Macquarie's character and
antecedents arrived at such a conclusion without misgivings. He was
proud of his own rank, had lived all his life among military men, and
was saturated with the ideas of the class whence the British Army drew
its officers. He acknowledged that when he came out to New South Wales
he thought that he would have no other intercourse with persons who had
been convicted than that of control over them. But a short experience
convinced him that some of the most meritorious men to be met in
Sydney, men who were most anxious to exert themselves for the public
well-being, were ex-convicts. To his great surprise, he found among
them men of manners and education. Such a one was Henry Fulton, a
Protestant clergyman who had been transported for suspected complicity
in the Irish rebellion. Another was Redfern, a surgeon with a lucrative
practice in Sydney, who had been sent out for his connection with the
naval mutiny at the Nore. He was, at the age of nineteen, naval surgeon
on H.M.S. STANDARD, and was convicted of advising the leaders of the
mutiny to 'be more united among themselves.' He was sentenced to death,
but on account of his youth the sentence was commuted to transportation
for life.</p>

<p>Macquarie, having in view the express purpose for which the colony
was founded, came to the conclusion that he ought to ignore the past,
and treat such persons as he would have treated them had they never had
black marks against their names. He therefore invited to his table at
Government House such of them as he deemed to be companionable men, and
insisted that all emancipists should be eligible for the magistracy or
for any civil posts for which they were competent. The House of Commons
Committee of 1812 commended him for adopting this course, which they
deemed to be the proper one to pursue in a colony established on such
lines as was New South Wales.</p>

<p>Humane and logical as the policy of the Governor was, he experienced
great difficulty in giving effect to it. The hindrances were both
social and official. Many free settlers, though they traded with
emancipists, objected to have social relations with them. Macquarie
told them plainly that they had come to a convict colony of their own
free choice, and that if they were 'too proud or too delicate in their
feelings to associate with the population of the country' they should
not have come.</p>

<p>As long as his own regiment was stationed in Sydney he could insist
on the officers dining with his emancipist guests, though they did try
by court-martial one of their number for playing cards with an
ex-convict. But when the 73rd was replaced by the 46th (now the Duke of
Cornwall's Light Infantry) the officers made it a strict rule that
though they could not object to meet emancipists at the Governor's
table they would not invite any to their mess or hold social
intercourse with them. Macquarie was very angry. His table, he said,
fixed the rule or standard for the admission of persons into society,
and the conduct of the officers did not impress him 'with a very high
opinion either of their good sense or their liberality.' There was a
lively quarrel between the Governor and the officers towards the end of
this regiment's period of duty on the station. It arose out of the same
question, Macquarie being especially annoyed With a sentence in an
address which the officers proposed to present to their colonel,
wherein they asserted that 'the mess table of the 46th regiment was
regarded as the standard of society in the colony.' The offending
sentence was excised before the address was presented, but there can be
no doubt that the officers believed it to be true, and that many among
the free settlers were of the same opinion. In 1817 the 46th was
relieved by the 48th (Northamptonshire) regiment, whose colonel,
Erskine, endeavoured to meet the wishes of the Governor by cultivating
friendliness with his own chosen band of emancipists. But when the
colonel took Dr. Redfern to the mess as his guest the whole of the
junior officers rose and left the table.</p>

<p>Macquarie never did, in fact, succeed in his honest and
humanely-meant endeavour to break down the social barrier dividing
emancipists from the part of the population which prided itself on
being untainted. He might perhaps have done better had he been more
rigorous in his selection. A few of his emancipist friends wore men of
exemplary life, and the offences for which they had been transported,
however serious, did not imply moral degradation. But such was not the
case with all of them. There were several very rich men in Sydney whose
mode of life did not win general respect, though the wealth which
fortune tossed at their feet enabled them to keep their hands from
picking and stealing. Macquarie weakened his case by associating
socially with some of these. He ignored the nature of an emancipist's
past when the law had exacted its penalties. As he himself defined his
attitude: 'I have taken upon myself to adopt a new line of conduct,
conceiving that emancipation, when united with rectitude and long-tried
good conduct, should lead a man back to that rank in society which he
had forfeited, and do away, in as far as the case will admit, with all
retrospect of former bad conduct.' But through his lack of
discrimination in disregarding the reputation of some of his 'pets,' he
made the promotion of his liberal policy less acceptable in the case of
the more worthy. In one notorious instance Macquarie wrote an epitaph
for the tombstone of an emancipist, stating in it that it was in
consequence of his character and conduct that he appointed him to be a
magistrate of the colony, and that by the same act he 'restored him to
that rank in society which he had lost.' Yet this man was described in
an official document as one who had made money by illicit distillation,
and whose private life was lax.</p>

<p>A change in the administration of justice was made during
Macquarie's governorship, and led to a new set of troubles. The old
method was primitive in its summary simplicity. The only Court
consisted of the Judge-Advocate and six naval or military officers; and
from their verdicts there was no appeal to any other Court. The first
three holders of the office of Judge-Advocate were not lawyers, and the
third of them, Richard Atkins, was not only wholly ignorant of the law,
but a drunken reprobate to boot. He was described in a scurrilous
satire circulated during King's governorship as one--</p>

<pre>
Who hangs alone where effigies are chalked
On doors or walls, the gallows having balked.

</pre>

<p>When Macquarie was appointed the Government sent out an English
barrister as Judge-Advocate in the person of Ellis Bent; and in 1814 a
Civil Court was established under the presidency of the
Judge-Advocate's brother, Jeffery Hart Bent, who was also a barrister.
The Secretary of State considered that the time had not yet arrived
when trial by jury could be instituted, but the separation of the
criminal and civil jurisdictions, and the placing of both Courts under
the direction of men of legal education, was a salutary reform. Jeffery
Bent strongly objected to emancipist attorneys practising in his Court,
on the ground that, as they had been struck off the rolls for
misconduct in England, they were not fit and proper persons to appear
before the Court in New South Wales. If ex-convicts were admitted to
practice in Sydney, he argued that it would be impossible to refuse to
admit any person who had been struck off the rolls in Great Britain but
had not been transported. Such persons would naturally flock to New
South Wales, and the population would consequently be exposed to the
chicanery of those whose conduct had been proved to be a menace to the
public and a disgrace to the profession.</p>

<p>Macquarie, however, fought hard for the emancipist attorneys, and
especially tried to force the claims of a rascally lawyer named
Crossley, who had been transported for forgery. Jeffery Bent
peremptorily refused to hear him. Inasmuch as Jeffery Bent's Court
could not adjudicate without the co-operation of two magistrates
appointed by the Governor, and as these magistrates took Macquarie's
view of the dispute, the Supreme Court held no sittings for two
years.</p>

<p>The two magistrates appointed to act with the Judge-Advocate, Ellis
Bent, took the opposite view, and agreed to a rule excluding from
practice before their Court any person who had been struck off the
rolls in any part of the King's dominions. There was a bitter quarrel
between the Governor and the Bent brothers, which was only terminated
with the death of the Judge-Advocate in 1815 and the recall of Jeffery
Bent by the Secretary of State in 1816. The place of the latter was
filled by Barron Field, the friend of a famous group of English men of
letters, including Charles Lamb, who wrote to him a very amusing letter
inquiring how he occupied his time in 'the land of thieves.' 'Going
about the streets with a lantern, like Diogenes, looking for an honest
man? You may look long enough, I fancy. Do give me some notion of the
inhabitants where you are. They don't thieve all day long, do they? No
human property could stand such continuous battery. And what do they do
when they aren't stealing?' Barron Field perpetrated a volume of verse
entitled <i>First Fruits of Australian Poetry</i>, which was so little
original that Lamb, in a review of it, described it as containing too
much evidence of the 'unlicensed borrowing which had helped to colonize
Botany Bay.'</p>

<p>Macquarie also stimulated strong feeling by appointing emancipists
to the magistracy. The Colonial Office murmured in gentle phrases that
it might be 'injudicious, unless under very peculiar circumstances,' to
select convicts as magistrates, and Macquarie gravely responded that he
had been and would be 'particularly cautious.' But magistrates who had
no past to live down refused to act with the Governor's nominees, and
several of them preferred their resignations by way of protest, on the
ground that the magisterial bench was degraded by the appointment to it
of men who had been convicted of crime.</p>

<p>An autocrat Macquarie unquestionably was; but the system which he
was set to administer required that he should be one. He was supreme,
and would tolerate no challenge to his supremacy. He would rise in
church and make announcements concerning matters of public policy. On
one occasion he summoned the Rev. Samuel Marsden before him, demanded
to see the manuscript of a sermon which he had preached on the previous
Sunday, and censured him for a passage in it. He had at least one free
settler flogged without trial, the man's offence being that he had
contravened orders by 'going through a hole in a wall into what the
Governor called his park.'</p>

<p>Macquarie quite frankly disliked free immigration. The colony had
been founded for the reception and reformation of criminals, and for
that purpose he would have retained it. 'The best description of
settlers,' he said in an official despatch, 'are emancipated convicts
or persons become free by servitude who have been convicts.' He was of
opinion that this class gave less trouble than did free persons. It was
therefore with apprehension that he regarded the abolition of all
restrictions on immigration to New South Wales in 1816. Previous to
that year no person could enter the colony with a view to settlement
without the special permission of the Government.</p>

<p>Some of the Governor's arbitrary acts smack of the manner of a
mediaeval noble ruling his baronial demesne. When an officer of the
73rd who had been dismissed the service after the departure of the
regiment from Sydney (but for an offence committed there) returned to
marry a lady, Macquarie refused him a marriage licence and ordered him
to depart by the ship which had brought him; and back he had to go,
without his bride. Judge Jeffery Bent remonstrated, but the Governor
curtly begged him to 'spare himself the trouble' of writing letters on
the subject. In another instance he refused to allow a marriage because
he thought the woman was too old for the man. He was benign towards the
Roman Catholics, and laid the foundation-stone of their first church in
Sydney; but he disliked the Methodists, and when a preacher of that
denomination arrived, the Governor wrote, 'We require regular and pious
clergymen of the Church of England, and not sectaries, for a new and
rising colony like this.'</p>

<p>There were, however, many excellent aspects of Macquarie's
autocracy. In a community formed largely of wrong-doers he laboured to
make it easier to live by salutary rule and harder to offend against
moral codes. He was vain, and sometimes petulant, but he had a strong
sense of justice and high ideals of duty. He encouraged education and
promoted building. In the latter work he availed himself of the
services of a London architect who had been transported for concealing
part of his effects at his bankruptcy, and who, amongst other very
capable pieces of work, designed the first lighthouse erected at South
Head, at the entrance to Port Jackson. Sydney had grown up a somewhat
scattered and planless town, but Macquarie straightened its streets and
marked out lines of development.</p>

<p>Socially he could be very pleasing and attractive. He travelled much
in the large dominions over which he presided, and laboured hard at his
desk. John Macarthur, who did not always take charitable views, of
official people, said that Macquarie was 'a gentleman in manners,
humane and friendly to all, at least to all who will take the trouble
of recommending themselves to his favour.' If we compare his arbitrary
acts with those of Bligh, there does not seem to be very much
difference between them. Yet he ruled for over a decade without serious
trouble amongst a population always inclined to restlessness. He had
his periods of unpopularity, but it arose from his policy, not from his
personality. Whatever view may be taken of his policy towards the
emancipists, it is impossible to withhold admiration for the tenacity
with which he pursued it when once he had wade up his mind that it was
the right one. Despite warnings and difficulties, he never turned his
back upon it.</p>

<p>During Macquarie's governorship the population of New South Wales
increased more than threefold. Before he left Sydney there were nearly
40,000 people in the several Australian settlements, and about 350,000
acres of land were occupied. More free settlers were arriving by every
ship. A bank had been founded--the Bank of New South Wales (1816). A
Savings Bank was established a year later. The ground was prepared for
more rapid progress and an improved system.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X - THE DAWN OF CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT</h3>

<blockquote><b>Uneasiness in England concerning the convict
system--Commissioner Bigge's inquiries--New South Wales Judicature
Act--The first Legislative Council--Chief Justice Forbes--Enlargement
of the Council--Wentworth--His <i>Australian</i>--The Governor and the
press--Governor Darling--Trial by jury--Robert Lowe--His <i>Atlas</i>
newspaper--His visions of Imperial relations.</b></blockquote>

<p>During the final years of Macquarie's period the British Government
arrived at the conclusion that the system in force in New South Wales
needed overhauling. Strange rumours reached England from time to time,
and there were always disappointed or malevolent persons, ready to
whisper their startling tales in the ears of officials and ministers.
'Sir,' said the Under-Secretary of State, Goulburn, to John Macarthur
in London, 'we have as heavy charges against Governor Macquarie as you
have made against his predecessor.'</p>

<p>What most impressed the public was the story related by the free man
who had been flogged by the Governor's order. He had returned to
England to proclaim his wrongs aloud and exhibit the scars of his
stripes. Uneasiness was expressed in Parliament, and Lord Castlereagh,
speaking on behalf of the Cabinet, admitted that it was necessary to
inquire whether 'even in justice to Botany Bay, the period had not
arrived when it might be relieved from being the resort of such
characters as had hitherto been sent to it.'</p>

<p>Ministers and the public required enlightenment from an independent
source. It was therefore decided to send out a commissioner in the
person of J. T. Bigge, a London barrister, to examine the laws,
regulations, and usages of the settlement, the mode of government, the
treatment of the convicts, and every other matter connected with the
transportation system. Bigge arrived at Sydney in 1819 and remained
nearly two years. He pursued his investigations with remarkable
thoroughness, and his three large reports, printed as parliamentary
papers, presented a mass of carefully sifted and skilfully marshalled
information. He brought to bear a trained critical intelligence, and
stated his conclusions in unmistakable terms. He was wholly opposed to
Macquarie's efforts to thrust his emancipist friends into social life
and to place them upon the magisterial bench. Even as to such
emancipists as Redfern he would admit no concessions, and complained
that the surgeon's manner 'betrayed an entire forgetfulness in himself
of that occurrence in his life which he will find it difficult to erase
from the memory or feelings of others.'</p>

<p>The most important consequence of Bigge's mission was the
institution of the beginnings of constitutional government in
Australia. If Macquarie was the last of the tyrants, his successor, Sir
Thomas Brisbane (1821-5) was the first of the Governors whose authority
was limited by statute. The New South Wales Judicature Act of 1823 set
up a Legislative Council, to consist of not more than seven nor fewer
than five members, with power to make laws 'for the peace, welfare, and
good government' of New South Wales, provided that they were not
repugnant to the laws of England.</p>

<p>The members of the Council were to be appointed by the Crown, which
meant in practice that they would be nominated by the Governor himself.
Further, the Council could only pass such laws as were submitted to it
by the Governor. It could not initiate legislation; and no bill could
even be submitted until it had been certified by the Chief Justice to
be consistent with the laws of England. What is more, if the Governor
proposed a law and a majority of the Council was not in favour of it,
he could bring it into effect without the Council's assent pending a
reference of the matter to the Imperial Government.</p>

<p>The Council, therefore, was simply an advisory body. But even that
was a step forward. It went far to destroy the arbitrariness of the
Governor's powers. He now had to work with a small body of
constitutionally authorised councillors, who were able to bring the
Government into touch with currents of public opinion. The Act of 1823
also established a Supreme Court, presided over by a Chief Justice. The
first occupant of that office was Sir Francis Forbes, who had
previously been Chief Justice of Newfoundland.</p>

<p>In 1828 the Act was amended by enlarging the Legislative Council to
a maximum of fifteen members, who were still to be nominated by the
Crown; but they were now endowed with power to reject, by a majority, a
proposal made by the Governor. If the Council disapproved of a measure
it became of no effect; it could no longer be put in force until the
Imperial Government had considered it, as was the case under the 1823
constitution.</p>

<p>At this period William Charles Wentworth began to make his influence
felt in public affairs. He was, indeed, the first Australian politician
of distinction, and for over thirty years to come was a personal power
in the land. After completing his University course at Cambridge,
Wentworth had been called to the bar, with the intention of returning
to Sydney to practise his profession there. But before leaving England
he published (1819) a book about New South Wales, wherein he enlarged
upon the abundant scope for settlement in the colony. He wished to see
the population increased, but he did not disguise his dissatisfaction
with the present mode of Government; and he outlined, as necessary
reforms, the programme which he was afterwards to promote with all the
energy of his virile mind. He demanded that representative institutions
such as Englishmen enjoyed in their own land should be established in
this English settlement, and that trial by jury should be made part of
the Judicial procedure. 'The colony is, I believe,' wrote Wentworth,
'the only one of the British possessions inhabited by Englishmen in
which there is not at least the shadow of free government.' It was time
that this state of things was brought to an end.</p>

<p>When Wentworth arrived in Sydney he commenced to agitate for the
free institutions which he had advocated in his book. He had brought
with him a printing press and plant, with the intention of starting a
newspaper, and his <i>Australian</i> began to appear shortly after his
landing in 1824. His was the first Australian newspaper conducted
independently of Government control, for the Sydney <i>Gazette</i>,
which commenced in 1803, was a publication principally for the issue of
official notices seasoned with scraps of general news. Wentworth's
<i>Australian</i> was a vigorously critical organ of opinion. He was
assisted in the conduct of it by a fellow law student, Wardell, who had
accompanied him from England. Before long their journal was engaged in
a furious campaign against established authority, and incidentally in a
fight for the freedom of the Press.</p>

<p>The case which promoted the first conflict between the Government
and the press illustrates a curious phase of life in the convict
colony. It appeared to many soldiers in regiments stationed in Sydney
that convicts, especially emancipists, were better off than they were.
Emancipists could obtain grants of land and live independent lives,
whilst soldiers were bound to duty and regulated by discipline. There
were several instances of soldiers committing felonies in order that
they might, as they believed, improve their lot in life by being
convicted. Governor Darling (who succeeded Brisbane in 1826) determined
to prevent this disposition among the soldiers by inflicting punishment
of exemplary severity.</p>

<p>Two privates were found guilty of robbery, which there was no doubt
had been committed for the purpose of gaining their discharge from the
Army. But Darling would not permit them to serve the sentences imposed
upon them in the ordinary manner. He ordered them to be set to work in
irons and to be drummed out of the regiment with every mark of
ignominy. They were loaded with heavy chains, had iron collars fastened
round their necks, and, thus degraded, were marched from the barracks
to the jail. One of them, named Sudds, whose iron collar was 'too small
for his neck,' seems to have been ill at the time, and he died in
hospital a few days later. The medical officer could find no trace of
disease. Sudds apparently died from the shock of the ordeal.</p>

<p>Wentworth and Wardell hotly attacked Darling for cruelty in this and
other instances--a charge of which, it should at once be stated, he was
officially declared to be innocent after inquiry had been made. The
quarrel was not confined to paper and printer's ink, for Wardell fought
a duel with the Governor's brother-in-law, whilst the publisher of the
<i>Australian</i> was fined 100 pounds and sentenced to six months'
imprisonment. Later, when Darling's term was coming to an end, Wardell
was prosecuted for stating in print that his Excellency's departure
from Sydney would be hailed with pleasure; but the prosecution failed.
From these quarrels originated the first measure for the regulation of
the Press.</p>

<p>Smarting under the stings of the <i>Australian</i>, Governor Darling
in 1827 sought to enact a law under which newspapers could only be
issued under periodical licences. Such a system would have enabled the
Government to stifle criticism at pleasure by declining to renew a
licence or threatening to do so. But Chief Justice Forbes refused to
certify that such an Act was not repugnant to the laws of England.
Forbes also refused to certify an Act which was actually passed by the
Legislative Council imposing a tax of fourpence per copy on newspapers;
but his authority did not enable him to block another severe measure
which made a second conviction for publishing a libel 'tending to bring
into hatred and contempt the government of the colony' punishable by
banishment for an undefined period. After the amended constitution came
into force and the certificate of the Chief Justice to the validity of
an Act was no longer required, Darling did not attempt to force a
crushing stamp act upon the press, and, in response to the criticism of
the Secretary of State, he modified the Newspaper Act of 1827 by
limiting the term for which an offending printer or publisher might be
banished. Chief Justice Forbes, who continued to hold his office till
1836, proved a stout friend to the liberalizing process which was now
at work in New South Wales when he refused to sanction the newspaper
licensing measure; and his sympathies throughout were with Wentworth in
his campaign for the introduction of free institutions.</p>

<p>The establishment of trial by jury in a colony populated chiefly by
convicts was from the beginning seen to be a serious difficulty. Even
before the First Fleet sailed for Botany Bay in 1787, the
Attorney-General had been called upon to advise Pitt's Government as to
the administration of justice, and had reported that the inhabitants
would not be 'the proper stuff to make juries.' But it was hoped that
this typically British mode of trial would be granted 'as soon as it
can be done with propriety.' The opportune time did not arrive for over
forty years after the establishment of the colony.</p>

<p>The essential difficulty of the problem was that persons who had
been transported for breaches of the law could not be regarded as
proper members of juries to try others; and this difficulty was bound
to continue as long as the emancipists exceeded in number the free
class. 'The great principle of that excellent institution,' wrote Lord
Bathurst, 'is that men should be tried by their peers. Would that
principle be fairly acted upon if free settlers were to sit in
judgement on convicts, and that too in cases where free settlers might
be a party? Would it be prudent to allow convicts to act as
jurymen?'</p>

<p>The mode of trial in criminal cases, by the Judge-Advocate and six
naval or military officers, was not abolished by the Acts of 1823 and
1828; though in civil cases, which were tried in the Chief Justice's
Court, the parties could demand a jury if they desired. Wentworth and
the Emancipist party insistently demanded that trial by jury on
familiar British lines should be inaugurated promptly; but the opposite
party, the Exclusives, detested the idea of entrusting any public
functions to ex-convicts. Forbes was of opinion that all persons who
had served their terms of transportation would be eligible as jurors if
the system were instituted, and he made no secret of his own opinion
that it should be.</p>

<p>Governor Darling was not unsympathetic towards the institution of
the jury system, especially as a little gentle pressure was being
exerted from England. The Legislative Council in 1830, under his
guidance, while passing a bill providing for trial by jury, and even
enabling emancipists to sit, expressly excluded all who had been
convicted for serious offences committed in the colony. The stirring of
opinion by Wentworth counted for very much in securing this measure of
advance. Indeed, the passing of the Act of 1830 was the direct outcome
of the insertion, upon his motion, of a petition for trial by jury in
an address presented to King William IV on his accession to the throne
in that year. The petition urged that the time was ripe for extending
'to the only colony of Britain bereft of the right of Britons a full
participation of the benefits and privileges of the British
Constitution.'</p>

<p>The limitation of the power of the Governor by setting up a Council
to work with him, the institution of trial by jury, and the prevention
of official control of the Press, were the three first important steps
in the direction of constitutional liberty. But the Council was not an
elected body; it was a group of officials and prominent persons,
selected by the Governor, and appointed by the Crown. Representative
institutions were not established until the convict system had been
abandoned and until four new colonies had been built in Australia.</p>

<p>With such a Council the reform party could never be satisfied. In
the leadership of that party, Wentworth was ably assisted by Dr.
William Bland, an ex-naval surgeon who had been transported for
'killing his man in a duel in India,' and who devoted himself in his
place of exile to an energetic life of public usefulness.</p>

<p>Yet, restricted as the first Legislative Council was in scope and
personnel, it did valuable work for Australia. In 1842 it was
reconstituted, when its membership was fixed at thirty-six, of whom
twenty-four were elected by freeholders possessed of a property
qualification of 200 pounds and householders who paid not less than 20
pounds per annum rent. The remaining twelve members were nominated by
the Government. The nominee members, from first to last, included
several men of very great ability. The most distinguished of these,
apart from Wentworth, was Robert Lowe, who came out to Australia during
the Governorship of Gipps (1838-45), with a brilliant, scholastic
reputation, and was appointed a member of the Council within a few
months of his arrival in 1842. For eight years Lowe was in the thick of
every political controversy. A white-headed young man whose tongue
rattled with amazing fluency, he developed the caustic wit and the
sparkling eloquence which were afterwards to illuminate the debates of
the House of Commons, and (when he became Lord Sherbrooke), the House
of Lords, while handling such questions as the minimum price of
squatting lands, the duty on flour, and the admissibility of
aboriginals as witnesses. Classical allusions flashed in his rapid
sentences. In his newspaper, the <i>Atlas</i>, he lavished a wealth of
learning on colonial problems, and occasionally he sprinkled a jet of
satirical couplets on persons who offended him.</p>

<p>But Lowe's acid sarcasm and vehement temper involved him in many
quarrels, including one which broke his friendship with Gipps. Twice at
least he received challenges to fight duels from opponents, who, though
no match for him in dialectic, thought they could do better with
pistols. He was wholly with Wentworth on the question of extending free
institutions to Australia, and had noble visions, such as were very
rare in his generation, of the future of the relations between Great
Britain and her colonies. In 1844 he said in the Legislative Council
that 'he hoped the time was not remote when Great Britain would give up
the idea of treating the dependencies of the Crown as children to be
cast adrift from their parent as soon as they arrived at manhood, and
substitute for it the far truer and nobler policy of knitting herself
and her colonies into one mighty confederacy, confident against the
world in arts and arms.' That note had never been struck in Australian
politics before Lowe's time; and none but he was capable of sounding it
in language which was then fresh and inspiring, though much that is
like it--hardly better expressed, however--has been heard since.</p>

<p>Lowe's experience of Australian politics stood him in good stead
when, on his return to England, he secured a seat in the House of
Commons, and Gladstone made him Chancellor of the Exchequer in his
Cabinet of 1868. It is indeed remarkable that both in Gladstone's first
and second Cabinets the Chancellorship of the Exchequer should have
been held by men who acquired their grounding in practical politics in
Australia. The second instance was that of Hugh Childers (Chancellor
1882-5), who was a member of the first Government of Victoria.</p>

Hovell--Alan Cunningham explores the Liverpool Range--Sturt's

<p>The discovery of a practical route across the Blue Mountains opened
the interior of Australia, first to exploration and secondly to
settlement. Often the early settler was himself an explorer; for,
whilst the names of some men who undertook long and hazardous journeys
with the specific object of investigation stand out on the records of
history, there were hundreds who contributed to the work of discovery
by the process of seeking for good pasturage and watercourses. A great
void continent wherein there was not a yard of cultivated land beyond
the limits of the small east-coast colony and its few offshoots,
awaited revelation. That it was a continent was now known; Flinders had
shattered the theory that it was a group of islands. But little more
than that was known till after 1813. An area of 2,983,200 square miles,
full of incalculable possibilities, lay, as it had lain for an
eternity, remote and unavailable, the inviolate sanctuary of 'cenotaphs
of species dead elsewhere.'</p>

<p>George Evans, the Deputy Surveyor-General, showed what might be
expected when, following up the path cleared by Blaxland, Lawson, and
Wentworth, he discovered the Macquarie and Lachlan Rivers watering the
rich Bathurst Plains. In 1815 the town of Bathurst was founded, the
first inland town in Australia. Governor Macquarie utilised convict
labour to construct a good road across the mountains to this new centre
of activity.</p>

<p>From this time commenced a series of explorations which rapidly
revealed the inland geography of the continent. The first important
name in the story is that of John Oxley. He was a naval officer who had
secured the Surveyor-Generalship on the recommendation of Flinders, and
who, being young and energetic, was not content to confine himself to
his Sydney office, but desired to take the lead in discovery. The
problem to which he directed his attention was the course of the two
rivers which had been named after the Governor, the Lachlan and the
Macquarie. They rose in the Blue Mountains; Evans, had traced them for
a few miles; they ran westerly; but whither? It took over twenty years
fully to discover that these, and a wonderful spread of watercourses of
which they formed part, were contributors to the immense basin of the
Murray, which, with its principal tributary the Darling, makes one of
the great river systems of the world.</p>

<p>On his journey of 1817 Oxley followed the windings of the Lachlan
for hundreds of miles over a dead level plain, through shallow, reedy
lagoons, and finally to a point where the river became a succession of
stagnant pools leading to a mere damp depression in the earth. The
volume of water which had borne his boats in the upper reaches had been
sucked up by the spongy soil before it reached the Murrumbidgee. Oxley
had, in fact, made an astonished acquaintance with that strange
phenomenon of Australia, where nature starts many a fine river but
gives it no firm channel wherein to flow, so that the water evaporates
from the intense heat of the plains, or percolates into the earth and
perhaps helps to fill those subterranean cauldrons of rock which modern
pastoralists have learnt to tap with artesian bores.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-19"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-19.jpg"></p>

<p>In the watershed of the Macquarie, which was explored after the
baffling adventures on the Lachlan, Oxley found 'a country of running
waters, on every hill a spring and in every valley a rivulet.' The
prospects were so inviting that he led a second expedition to
investigate this river in 1818. But here again a broad, deep,
vigorously flowing stream flattered the travellers at the beginnings of
their journey, and mocked them by disappearing after carrying their
boats for about a hundred and fifty miles. It flowed over a great
plain, maintained its current through a chain of sprawling pools, and
then, as Oxley recorded, 'without any previous change in the breadth,
depth, and rapidity of the stream, and when I was sanguine in the
expectation of soon entering the long-sought-for lake, it all at once
eluded our further pursuit by spreading at all points from north-west
to north-east over the plains of reed that surrounded us, the river
decreasing in depth from upwards of twenty feet to less than five feet
and flowing over a bottom of tenacious blue mud.'</p>

<p>On his return journey to Sydney across the Liverpool Plains, Oxley
and his party crossed twelve rivers, including the Castlereagh and the
Namoi (or Peel). The whole of them had their origin on the west side of
the mountains, and flowed inland. What became of them on occasions when
their channels carried a full flood of water through their entire
length, instead of losing it on the way, was still an unsolved enigma.
Oxley, who had been accompanied by Allan Cunningham, the botanist, and
by Evans, had completed the longest land journey yet achieved in
Australia, a very adventurous and difficult piece of work, much of it
in rough country, all of it in country previously untraversed by
Europeans.</p>

<p>The discovery of these rich, well-watered plains beyond the
mountains opened a new realm. It was now certain that for 500 miles
west of Sydney there was land where great flocks and herds could
pasture and large communities of people could thrive. From this time
the attitude of the British Government towards free settlement in
Australia changed. Before the journeys of Evans and Oxley the official
disposition had not been encouraging. New South Wales was a penal
colony first and foremost, and, as we have seen, Macquarie during his
long governorship cared far more about the welfare of the convicts and
emancipists than about free colonists. He frankly disliked what he
called 'gentlemen settlers,' who wanted concessions and were often
vexatiously critical. He grumbled that it had become a constant
practice 'for persons who wish to get rid of some troublesome
connections to obtain permission from the Secretary of State's office
for their being allowed to come out here.' Let them stay in England; he
did not want them. The Government in England, too, required
'satisfactory testimonials and recommendations from persons of known
respectability' before granting permission to persons to emigrate to
New South Wales.</p>

<p>But the discoveries on the far side of the mountains changed the
point of view entirely. As soon as the news reached England a fresh
policy was inaugurated. The Government not only threw down the barriers
but began to advertise the attractions of New South Wales as a field
for immigration. Newspaper and magazine articles frequently appeared
which enlarged upon the opportunities presented by this wonderful, new,
unoccupied dominion, where land grants could be obtained so easily and
where a small capital would secure for a man a greater stretch of broad
acres than were owned by many a prosperous English squire. A new era
had dawned. In 1818 Lord Sidmouth said in the House of Commons, 'the
dread of transportation had almost entirely subsided, and had been
succeeded by a desire to emigrate to New South Wales.' Proofs of the
change were of frequent occurrence. The emigrant ship as well as the
convict transport became familiar in Port Jackson. Australia came to be
looked upon as a land of hope and promise instead of as an abode of
despair. This great and striking difference was made by the discovery
of the plains across the Blue Mountains.</p>

<p>The inflow of immigrants necessitated a change of policy in the
classification of convicts. It was evidently desirable to keep Sydney
as free as possible from characters who would be likely to give
trouble. Consequently it was desirable to find a place along the coast
where an establishment might be formed for the handling of bad
cases.</p>

<p>In search of such a place, John Oxley in 1823 went north in the
MERMAID. He examined Port Curtis, but did not think it suitable. On his
return he anchored at Moreton Bay, and there, to his great surprise,
met a white man named Pamphlet, who for several weeks had been living
with a tribe of aboriginals. Pamphlet had been one of a boat's crew who
had been blown out to sea and wrecked on Moreton Island. One of his
four companions had died of thirst, a second had started to tramp to
Sydney, whilst the third, Finnegan, was at the time when Oxley met
Pamphlet out hunting with the chief of the aboriginal tribe, who had
treated the white men with great kindness. On the following day Oxley
met Finnegan. From these two men he learned of the existence of a large
river falling into Moreton Bay. They had crossed it, and were the
discoverers of it. Oxley, guided by Finnegan, examined it for some
miles from the mouth, and, congratulating himself on the finding of the
largest fresh-water river on the east coast of New South Wales, named
it the Brisbane after the Governor.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1824, was founded upon the banks of the
Brisbane a new colony expressly for the punishment of convicts who,
since they had been in New South Wales, had been convicted of further
crimes and sentenced to transportation for them. In 1825 the river was
explored for 150 miles by Major Lockyer, who showed how fertile was the
soil in the interior. 'Nothing,' he wrote in his journal, 'can possibly
excel the fine rich country we are now in.' A touch of humanity in
Major Lockyer's journal deserves remembrance. He had maintained
friendly relations with aboriginals whom he met, and, on taking his
departure, desired to purchase a handsome puppy which one of them had
in his arms. 'I offered a small axe for it. His companion urged him to
take it, and he was about to do so when he looked at his dog, and the
animal licked his face, which settled the business. He shook his head,
determined to keep it. I tried him afterwards with handkerchiefs of
glaring colours and other things, but it would not do--he would not
part with his dog. I gave him, however, the axe and the
handkerchief.'</p>

<p>Early in 1824, Governor Brisbane, desiring to obtain information
about the country to the south of Sydney--that is, the part now known
as Victoria--conceived the strange idea of landing a party of convicts
near Wilson's Promontory or Cape Howe, providing them with equipment
for a long journey, and directing them to make, the best of their way
to the shores of Port Jackson. If they arrived safely they were to
receive 'suitable rewards and indulgences.' If they died on the way
that would be their misfortune. But he was dissuaded from this plan,
and instead of it he gave some assistance to an expedition led by
Messrs. Hume and Hovell.</p>

<p>The party started from Hume's residence at Lake George in October
1824, crossed the rivers Murrumbidgee, Hume (Murray), Mitta-Mitta,
Ovens, and Goulburn and reached the western arm of Port Phillip near
the site of Geelong. They made a mistake as to their whereabouts, and
upon their return a report was published from information supplied by
them wherein it was stated that they had reached Westernport. The
mistake was of some importance when in 1826 Governor Darling sent out
the expedition to occupy Westernport in suspicion that the French under
Dumont D'Urville intended to do so. Messrs. Hume and Hovell had
traversed excellent country, and, had their report indicated that it
lay to the west of Port Phillip, the expedition of 1826 would
undoubtedly have been directed to settle there instead of at
Westernport, where, after investigation, the conditions were not deemed
to be suitable for permanent occupation. Quite a different verdict
would have been returned had the expedition directed more of its
attention to Port Phillip. It is very curious to observe how little was
known in 1825 of the work of the earlier explorers. When Brisbane
received the report of Messrs. Hume and Hovell he wrote to London. 'It
is my intention, as soon as I have the means, to send a colonial vessel
to Westernport to have it explored, as it seems to have escaped
Flinders and others.' The Governor was wholly unaware that the port was
discovered by Bass in 1798, and that it had since been thoroughly
explored and mapped by Murray, Grant, Barrallier, and Robbins, in the
first decade of the century.</p>

<p>Allan Cunningham, not less keen as an explorer than as a botanist,
fought his way across the Liverpool Range in 1827, penetrated the
Darling Downs, and discovered the Gwydir, the Dumaresq, and the
Condamine Rivers. Where did they flow? Between the Condamine in the
north and the Goulburn in the south was a distance as great as from the
Orkneys to Lands End. Nobody suspected that all the intervening rivers,
and some more to the west not yet discovered, belonged to the same
riparian scheme. That great discovery had yet to be made.</p>

<p>The problem of the rivers was taken in hand by one of the most
heroic and daring of Australian explorers when Captain Charles Sturt
applied himself to it in 1828. Sturt had come to the country with his
regiment, the 39th (Dorsets) in the previous year, and at once became
fascinated by the question of what became of the large streams which
Oxley had navigated, and which Hume and Hovell had crossed. It was
speculated that they poured their waters into a great inland sea. If
that were true, where was that sea? Sturt wrote that he undertook his
series of toilsome explorations from 'a wish to contribute to the
public good'; 'I should exceedingly regret,' he said, 'if it were
thought, I had volunteered hazardous and important undertakings for the
love of adventure alone.' The spirit of his work was entirely in accord
with that profession.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-20"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-20.jpg"></p>

<p>For three years previously to 1828 Australia had been severely
afflicted by drought. Crops failed and stock died for lack of grass and
water in districts where there was abundance in normal seasons. If
there were well-watered areas in the interior, beyond the zone which
had hitherto been examined, it was urgent that they should be
found.</p>

<p>Sturt's expedition was therefore equipped by Governor Darling with
the view of following up the channel of the Macquarie. It was pursued
in a boat as long as there was a sufficient depth of water, and then
the explorers started off on horseback, travelling a full month over
barren, sun-baked, drought-smitten plains, till suddenly they found
themselves on the precipitous banks of a river which gleamed forty feet
below them. They had found the Darling. The water in it, to their deep
disappointment, was brackish, but there were fortunately occasional
pools of drinkable water with which they could refresh themselves and
their cattle. The parched beds of the Bogan and the Castlereagh were
examined before the party were compelled to beat a retreat back to the
Macquarie.</p>

<p>The discovery of the Darling was of capital importance. Though Sturt
found it in a drought season, when the water was low and salt, and for
considerable stretches the bed was quite dry, yet it was evident that
those steep banks, down which the cattle could not safely be taken,
sometimes held a great, deep, raging river. Here was a new problem.
Whence did this river come? Whither did it go?</p>

<p>In 1829 the intrepid Sturt attacked the river problem at a fresh
point. Hume and Hovell had crossed the Murrumbidgee on their overland
journey to Port Phillip. The direction of this river's flow and that of
the Darling seemed to indicate that the two formed a junction
somewhere. The speculation was well founded, and the new journey was to
prove itself one of high historical interest.</p>

<p>Sturt left Sydney on November 3, and struck the banks of the
Murrumbidgee near Yass on November 23. There it was a rapid, foaming
stream, fresh from the snowy mountains to the east. Its banks were
followed until the water shallowed into reed-beds. Then Sturt, with
undaunted resource and energy, decided to leave. his cattle and stores,
put together a whaleboat the planks and parts of which he had brought
with him, and set out to explore the further course of the river in it.
He selected seven of his party to accompany him, three of them soldiers
of his regiment, three convicts, all men upon whose devotion and
courage he could implicitly rely. At seven o'clock in the morning on
January 7, 1830, commenced the very remarkable voyage which was to
prove the junction of the Murrumbidgee and the Darling with the Murray,
and was to trace the whole course of that great waterway to the
sea.</p>

<p>After a dangerous and exciting journey of a week, piloting the boat
through formidable barriers of snags, suddenly and unexpectedly the
river current took a southern course. At two in the afternoon of
January 14, the boat shot out of the Murrumbidgee into a broad and
noble river with such force that the explorers were carried nearly to
the bank opposite its mouth, while they 'gazed in silent wonder' upon
the large channel they had entered. Nine days later a new and beautiful
river was found pouring itself into the main stream, and Sturt felt
sure that this was the Darling, which he had discovered, a salt and
shrunken ribbon of water, 300 miles to the north-east, on his previous
journey. The identity was not completely established till some years
later, but Sturt's reasoning in 1830 was really sufficient to make the
point clear.</p>

<p>The boat was carried down by the current until the Murray emptied
itself into the great lake at its mouth, and the explorers saw to the
westward of them the blue waters of Encounter Bay. Sturt gave to the
great river the name of Sir George Murray, who happened to be Secretary
of State for War and the Colonies for a few months in 1828-30. He was a
man whom the Duke of Wellington took into his Cabinet because he liked
him as a soldier, but who is described by an English historian as one
who 'had given no signs of any capacity in debate and had displayed no
qualifications for administering a civil office.' Murray had even
ceased to be a minister before the news reached England that his name
had been given to the trunk of the great river-system of Australia.</p>

<p>The total cost to the Government of equipping the expedition from
which so much resulted was 265 pounds 19s. 4 3/4d.</p>

<p>Alexander Hume, the leader of the expedition of 1824, claimed that
the Murray was simply the lower part of the river which he had
discovered and named after himself; and, really, he was quite right.
True, he had not explored it for more than a few miles, nor could he
have done so consistently with carrying out the plan upon which he was
engaged; whereas Sturt had followed it for 1,750 miles from its
junction with the Murrumbidgee to the sea. But that fact does not
detract from the soundness of Hume's claim; and though the river is
likely to carry the name of Murray perpetually, there does not seem to
be any better reason for thus celebrating an obscure politician (who,
when questioned late in 1830, did not know who Sturt was or where the
river was) than that it is too well established to be altered.</p>

<p>Sturt's two great journeys of 1828-30 were the most important pieces
of inland exploration in Australian history. Others may have had more
exciting adventures and endured greater hardships. Sturt himself in his
expedition from Adelaide in 1844--to be discussed hereafter--did a more
desperately brave thing. But the discovery of the Darling and the
exploration of the Murray to its mouth; the laying down upon the map of
the main arteries of the enormous spread of river-veins which take the
water from 414,253 square miles of territory--double the area of
France; the opening of a new, rich, well-watered province for British
colonization--this was the consummate achievement of Sturt's career as
an explorer. Withal, he was a kind and considerate gentleman, 'brave as
a paladin, gentle as a girl,' a leader of men who was followed by his
chosen band in any risk because he was trusted and beloved. Exposure,
privations, anxiety, and severe labour on these expeditions brought on
bad health and a period of blindness; and he never received adequate
recognition and honour for what he had done.</p>

<p>The Surveyor-General of New South Wales, Major Thomas Mitchell (he
had been appointed to that office in 1828), did not conceal his
jealousy and annoyance that Sturt was chosen to command the expeditions
to solve the river problem. He himself was keen to attain fame as an
explorer, and thought that the task should have been entrusted to him.
But there was plenty of valuable work still to be done in this field,
and Mitchell had abundant opportunities of proving his own worth. His
first expeditions were to the upper Darling country in 1831 and again
in 1835, when he found the great river not low as Sturt had seen it,
but flowing full and sweet-watered through richly grassed country. He
now discovered that Allan Cunningham's Gwydir and Dumaresq were
tributaries of the Darling. The fragments of streams found by one
explorer after another and marked in thin, disconnected streaks upon
their maps, were becoming linked up.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1836, Mitchell planned his most famous
expedition. He was instructed to find out whether the Darling was the
same river as Sturt had found flowing into the Murray. He was somewhat
doubtful of Sturt's reasoning; his jealousy apparently made him hope
that Sturt was wrong. But even before he reached the point of junction
he realized that the Darling was indeed a tributary of the Murray.</p>

<p>The problem was solved, and if Mitchell had returned to Sydney when
he realized that his allotted task was done the expedition of 1836
would have fallen short of being very important. But after working up
the Murray for about a fortnight, he crossed over to the south side of
it, camped at Swan Hill, kept moving southerly, and ascended Mount Hope
and Pyramid Hill. There he had a Pisgah-sight which fascinated him. All
around him the explorer saw a magnificent stretch of fresh country,
quite different from that to which he had been accustomed in New South
Wales. He threw up his hands in rapture. Moses had never entered the
Promised Land, but he, Thomas Mitchell, beheld a perfect Paradise
rolling in green and golden glory before his eyes, and was to be the
first to traverse it. 'As I stood,' he wrote, 'the first intruder on
the sublime solitude of these verdant plains, as yet untouched by
flocks and herds, I felt conscious of being the harbinger of mighty
changes there; for our steps would soon be followed by the men and the
animals for which it seemed to have been prepared.' Into 'this Eden' he
believed that he was the first to break.</p>

<p>But in that he was mistaken. When he had led his party by easy and
pleasant stages through the western district of Victoria, had
discovered the Glenelg River, and had started on his homeward route, he
suddenly obtained a glimpse of Portland Harbour, and there, to his
great surprise, he beheld a brig lying at anchor, and what he at first
took for grey rocks proved, on examination through his telescope, to be
a cluster of comfortable huts on the shore.</p>

<p>For, in December 1834--that is, a year and nine months before
Mitchell appeared upon the scene--the Henty brothers had taken up their
unauthorised abode at Portland, with flocks, herds, poultry, and a
serviceable whaling ship. Fruit-trees and vines were growing, garden
flowers and vegetables were flourishing, and fields were under
cultivation in Australia Felix before the explorer who called the
country by that name set out from Sydney. The brig in the bay was the
Hentys' vessel, the ELIZABETH; and while Mitchell was enjoying the
hospitality of these pioneers a hunchback whale came into the bay and
afforded an opportunity to him of witnessing an exciting chase. 'It was
not the least interesting scene in these my Australian travels,' wrote
Mitchell, 'thus to witness from a verandah, on a beautiful afternoon at
Portland Bay, the humours of the whale fishery and all those wondrous
perils of harpooners and whaleboats of which I had delighted to read as
scenes of the stormy north.'</p>

<p>And these were not the only precursors of settlement in Victoria at
this very time. In the year before Mitchell started--in June 1835--John
Batman had steered a boat up the river Yarra and exclaimed, 'This will
be the place for a village' when he contemplated the site of Melbourne.
The village had actually been founded, and men were living in it,
unknown to and unauthorised by the authorities in Sydney, at the very
time when, to the westward of them, Mitchell, travel-worn but still
elated, was leading his expedition back across the verdant valleys of
his Eden.</p>

colonization-- Thornas Peel's project--The Peel River colony--The site
of Perth--Early difficulties--Peel's failure--Stirling's
governorship--Western Australia and the eastern colonies--Shortage of

<p>The scene shifts to the western lobe of the continent, to the shores
which the Dutch navigators had so often seen on their voyages to and
from the East Indies, and which Dampier had dismissed with the cold
disparagement that 'if it were not for that sort of pleasure which
results from the discovery even of the barrenest spot upon the globe,
this coast of New Holland would not have charmed me much.'</p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere in Australia, the explorer pointed out the way to
the settler. It has previously been shown that suspicions concerning
French designs--afterwards designated 'false rumours' by Lord
Ripon--induced Governor Darling to send Major Lockyer to occupy King
George's Sound (Albany) in 1827. At the same time, Captain James
Stirling in H.M.S. SUCCESS, made an examination of the Swan
River--which the Dutchman Vlaming had named ('Swaenerevier') because he
found there a species of black swan ('een soorte van swarte swanen').
Stirling was charmed with what he saw, and the botanist who accompanied
him, Fraser, gave a glowing account of the beauties of the river and
the capabilities of the soil. Not only in his official report, but also
in private letters to influential persons, did Stirling proclaim the
value of his discoveries. In one such letter he said that the land on
the banks of the Swan, 'of all that I have seen in various quarters of
the world, possesses the greatest natural attractions.' It was a spot
'so eligible for settlement that it cannot long remain unoccupied; it
is not inferior in any natural essential quality to the plain of
Lombardy.'</p>

<p>As soon as Darling received the report he was anxious that a
settlement should be founded on the Swan River. Lockyer's little colony
at Albany had no promising back country, but Stirling's report
indicated boundless possibilities. The Governor therefore sent him to
England in order that he might present it to the Government in person,
and back up Darling's very strong recommendation that the Swan River
should be peopled without delay.</p>

<p>Some people were still imbued with ideas as to French designs.
Curiously enough, too, the Secretary to the Admiralty pressed the point
that there was a danger lest the 'French or the Americans should assume
possession of the only safe anchorage on the west coast of Australia',
though what ground there was for thinking that America, in 1828, took
any interest in Western Australia is by no means apparent. But the
Government, however willing it might be that the Swan River should be
occupied, was determined not to incur expense. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer was cutting down expenditure, and his colleagues did not see
any advantage in extending the area of British occupation in Australia.
The Colonial Secretary, Huskisson, suggested that the East India
Company might found a colony, the Government promising every facility;
but the Company would not undertake the venture. Then Stirling
undertook to form a company of private capitalists to colonize under a
Royal Charter; but the Government would not entertain that proposition.
Indeed, they did not seem to see any particular reason for exerting
themselves. There was, it was now abundantly clear, unbounded scope for
expansion in New South Wales. As long as foreigners could be kept off
other portions of the coastline by waving the Union Jack, dumping down
a few convicts at points like Westernport, Albany, and Melville Island,
and saying firmly in diplomatic language, 'This is all ours'--that was
sufficient. The lion lay couchant after a heavy meal, with his paws on
what he intended for his supper.</p>

<p>But there were Englishmen who, attracted by Stirling's account of
the Swan River, believed in the possibility of making a profitable
investment and at the same time of performing valuable Imperial service
there. Following the flow of free immigration to Australia, masses of
English capital were awaiting scope for investment in the country. The
Australian Agricultural Company, with a capital of 1,000,000 pounds,
commenced to operate in New South Wales in 1824; in 1825 the Van
Diemen's Land Company acquired a great estate in the southern island.
News about the Swan River came to hand just at the time when these
enterprises had been taken in hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Peel, a cousin of Sir Robert Peel, was the prime mover in
the new scheme. He undertook, on behalf of a syndicate formed for the
purpose, to convey 10,000 immigrants to Western Australia and settle
them there, at an estimated cost of 30 pounds per head, or a total of
300,000 pounds, in return for a grant of 4,000,000 acres, valued at 1s.
6d. per acre, which would exactly recoup this outlay. Peel had sundry
interviews with Colonial Office officials, from which, being a man of
extremely sanguine disposition, he drew the inference that the
syndicate's terms were accepted. He even went so far as to purchase a
ship for conveying his first batch of immigrants.</p>

<p>But though the Government did not wish to incur financial
obligations in behalf of the Swan River, the Colonial Office considered
that Peel's terms were extravagant. They knew from their experience of
conveying convicts that the cost per head would not run to 30 pounds,
and a grant of 4,000,000 acres--a larger area than Yorkshire--of
unknown value, was rather a stiff price to pay; though the Company
undertook to grant 200 acres to each of the immigrants, thus disposing
of one half the total domain. The Colonial Office cut down the land
grant to 1,000,000 acres. Each immigrant was to get 40 acres for every
3 pounds invested by him in land--that is, one acre for every 1s. 6d.
invested; and this land was not to become the freehold property of the
settler unless he spent 1s. 6d. per acre in improving it within the
first three years.</p>

<p>Peel's partners did not see much prospect of profit in these terms.
But he himself aspired to be one of the founders of 'new majesties of
mighty states,' and to make a name for himself, like Penn and Delaware
in America, as well as to invest his money to advantage; and, as he was
to get 250,000 acres for himself as the founder of the colony--and that
area, after all, was a bigger piece of territory than the county of
Huntingdon--he decided to proceed.</p>

<p>Peel invested 50,000 pounds of his own money in the scheme, and lost
most of it. Stirling was appointed Governor, and he arrived in the
PARMELIA with fifty-five passengers on June 1, 1829.</p>

<p>Exactly where the administrative centre should be located had not
yet been determined. The port of Fremantle was deemed unsuitable, and,
until the beautiful site of Perth was chosen and the foundation of a
township laid (August 12), Stirling encamped his people on Garden
Island, a sandy waste a few miles from the mouth of the Swan. Here they
endured severe privations for several months, many living like
black-fellows, sheltered from the sharp ocean winds only by brushwood
screens. From this place exploring parties were sent out to look for
cultivable land. Meanwhile, more immigrant ships in quick succession
brought their living freight, the hopeful colonists having been induced
to leave England by the attractive reports circulated by Peel's agents.
Peel himself took out 300 people, whom he engaged to work upon his own
land. By January 1830 twenty-five ships had landed 850 persons in the
Swan River colony, there was a total population of 1,300, and 525,000
acres of land had been allotted. During that year about a thousand more
arrived. There were cattle, sheep, horses, fruit-trees, plants, seeds,
tools, and all the necessary equipment of a colony.</p>

<p>But Peel's experiment was a failure; and the philanthropic investor
burnt his fingers. It failed for several reasons. To plant some
hundreds of settlers upon large areas of land necessarily meant
creating a very scattered community. Every man lived miles away from
every other man. He was monarch of all he surveyed, but he surveyed
only solitude. There were no roads. These English people had not been
accustomed to a life of that kind. Some, it is true, were bravely
venturesome. 'Acting under the impulse of novelty,' reported Stirling,
'there were many who at once established themselves on their land,
regardless of danger from the natives and of the difficulty they
encountered in removing their goods from the coast.'</p>

<p>Then, the Western Australian aboriginals resented the occupation of
their happy hunting-grounds by this horde of white people who had
descended suddenly upon the country. Dampier had not liked the look of
the Western Australian blacks--'the Hodmadods of Monomatapa,' he said,
'though a nasty people, are gentlemen to these'--and Peel's settlers
liked them less. They attacked the intruders, and the few soldiers whom
Stirling had with him were forced to shoot some.</p>

<p>Further, the task of building houses in the wilderness, of clearing
land, cultivating, and tending stock, was desperately hard work.
Western Australia is a country four and a half times as big as France,
three times as big as Germany, a country of huge forests and bush land,
and of immense, waterless plains. It was not easy for immigrants from a
thickly populated country to make homes for themselves there,
especially as there was nobody to take them in hand and show them the
way of it. Very stout-hearted men were required to succeed in such
circumstances, and not a very large proportion of the settlers were of
that kind. 'Many of the settlers who have come,' said Stirling, 'should
never have left a safe and tranquil state of life.' Naturally, many
gave up the attempt in despair, and clung to the centre of the
settlement, Perth, where they had to be fed from the Government stores.
Others left the Swan River altogether, to try their luck in other parts
of Australia. One such family, as we shall see, became the first
settlers in Victoria.</p>

<p>Peel's own company of selected immigrants melted away from him.
Others who had obtained large grants of land and had brought their own
labourers from England endured a similar experience. These servants had
not been chosen with care. 'Many indented servants,' Stirling reported,
'were recommended to their employers by parish officers,' and 'their
habits were of the loosest description.' Indeed, the 'greater part' of
the servants were the 'outcasts of parishes' in England, persons who,
being a constant charge on the poor-rates at home, parish officers were
very glad of the chance of sending abroad. At the same time it must be
said that some of Peel's people were competent farm workers and were
willing to give him loyal service. But he had indentured them for a
wage of 3s. per day, and they could earn more by working for other
settlers; and though he did secure the punishment of some for breach of
indentures, he gave permission to others to leave his service. 'A
number of them,' wrote Captain Irwin, who published a little book about
the colony, 'were excellent men who would have conscientiously adhered
to him had he not given them the option of working for others.' But
Peel, though his aims were good, was not a successful leader of men.
Finally, conscious of failure, he surrendered his grant at a ruinous
loss and returned to England, with the painful consciousness that to
found a new colony is not so easy as it seems when read about in
books.</p>

<p>But though Peel's experiment failed, and his settlement was
described as 'the scarecrow of civilization,' the colony of Western
Australia endured; and the very failure brought into existence another
colony on the southern coast of Australia.</p>

<p>That Western Australia was not abandoned after the collapse of the
first mistaken endeavour was due principally to the energy and resource
of Stirling. It was on his recommendation that the Swan River
Settlement was founded, and, though he had had no experience of
colonizing, and had both seriously underrated the difficulties and
inadequately prepared to encounter them, he did not mean to let his
colony die on his hands. He was in the prime of life, thirty-eight, and
his training as a naval officer had made him an adept in leadership and
in finding expedients. He had brought his young wife of twenty-two out
with him, to 'rough it' in the wilderness, and she, with her refinement
and social tact, was no inconsiderable factor in making possible a
tolerably agreeable life for the people over whom her husband ruled. He
was indefatigable in personally conducting exploring parties and in
directing the efforts of intending settlers into probably profitable
channels. For nine years (till 1838) he was at the head of the
government, except for two years when he was in England explaining to
the Colonial Office the causes of the initial failure and securing
support for his future efforts. Patience and an intelligent optimism
were his guiding lights, and with these and his administrative ability
he pulled the colony through the troubles of its infancy.</p>

<p>There was no suspicion as yet of the gorgeous deposits of gold which
lay under the sands of Western Australia. The colony had to endure from
the products of its soil. Stirling realized that it was hopeless at
this stage to establish a thriving community on small holdings. It was
no country for peasant proprietors. It had magnificent timber
resources, but there was at present but a small market for that
commodity. The only chance of success was to offer inducements to those
who could take up fairly large areas for mixed farming and grazing.
Agriculture alone offered no fruitful prospects, but sheep and cattle
raising and horse breeding could be made to pay. In more recent times,
when a larger population has created more demands for land for wheat
farming and fruit culture, the large holdings have been felt to be an
embarrassment; but it has to be remembered that the creation of these
estates in the earlier years of Western Australia's existence was the
policy which saved it from bankruptcy and abandonment.</p>

<p>The curve of the population figures shows how the colony fared. In
1830 there had been as many as 4,000 persons in Western Australia. The
greater part of them drifted away, and in 1832 there were only 1,500.
Then, little by little, a period of growth commenced. It was a very
slow process, truly, but the corner had been turned. In 1840 there was
a population of 2,350; in 1850 it numbered over 5,000.</p>

<p>These people were separated from the other Australian colonies by
vast trackless deserts and 2,000 miles of ocean. It was easier to trade
with London than with Sydney. Nearly everything produced in Western
Australia was also produced in larger quantities in the older
settlements. Consequently there was little scope for trade with them.
The colony came to feel that it was divided in its interests as well as
geographically from other colonies on the same mainland; and it showed
that feeling in an acute fashion when it asked for convict immigration
several years after transportation to New South Wales had ceased, and
the public conscience had revolted from it. The story of the ending of
the convict system elsewhere will be told in a later chapter; here it
is necessary to explain why it was inaugurated in Western
Australia.</p>

<p>In the beginning there was a distinct determination that convicts
should not be introduced, and a feeling of pride that the western
colony had come into existence by other means than New South Wales and
Van Diemen's Land had done. Captain Irwin, in his <i>State and Position
of Western Australia</i>, 1835, spoke of the 'feeling of disgust'
aroused by a proposition to bring convicts to King George's Sound; it
was, he said, a 'monstrous project,' which was 'not likely to gain many
adherents in the country.' Peel had stipulated that convicts were not
to be taken to the Swan River, and the home Government never violated
this condition. Anxiety was even expressed lest convicts who had served
their sentences in the penal settlements should come westward, and in
1845 there was a demand that expirees should be prohibited from landing
at Perth.</p>

<p>But at this very time a change was brewing. Labour was scarce. The
population increased by immigration, but at the same time the colony
lost labourers by emigration to the eastern and southern colonies. The
supply of hands was inadequate to work the farms and tend the stock.
Western Australia was threatened with stagnation just when the
preliminary rough work of pioneering had been done, and an era of
prosperity had seemed to be within sight. Moreover, the Imperial
Government had lately introduced a new land policy. Acting on ideas
which will be explained later, ministers raised the minimum price of
land to one pound per acre throughout the Australian colonies without
regard to differences in quality. This regulation hit Western Australia
in three ways. First, it deprived the colony of the opportunity of
attracting settlers by the offer of very cheap land. If an immigrant to
Australia had to pay at least one pound per acre, he would be likely to
go elsewhere than to the Swan River. Secondly, by thus decreasing the
land sales it deprived the colony of the fund which it had been using
for bringing out labourers. Thirdly, it prevented the inflow of fresh
capital, which every immigrant brought with him to a greater or lesser
degree. Depression and gloom hung over the Swan River. Trade was at a
standstill. Land was unsaleable.</p>

<p>In 1848 the English Government inaugurated a new system of treating
convicts. What the conditional pardon system was, and why it was
brought into being, will be explained in Chapter XVIII. Here it is
sufficient to indicate that in the year mentioned Governor Charles
Fitzgerald, who had just assumed office in Perth, inquired among the
leading colonists whether they would be willing to relieve the
situation in regard to the shortage of labour by receiving convicts
under this plan. The subject was much canvassed for several months, and
early in 1849 a public meeting held at Perth passed a resolution asking
the Imperial Government 'to erect this colony into a regular penal
settlement.' Fitzgerald forwarded the resolution to London with the
expression of his opinion that the majority of the people would gladly
learn that Western Australia had been chosen for the reception of
convicts. Accordingly, on May 12, 1849, Orders in Council were passed
appointing Western Australia a place to which such persons might be
despatched, and the first batch arrived in June 1850.</p>

<p>In these circumstances Western Australia became a penal settlement
after the other Australian colonies, except Van Diemen's Land, had by
their own determined efforts thrown off the incubus of convictism. The
system endured for sixteen years. It resulted in nearly 10,000 convicts
being introduced; but, at the same time, in accordance with an
understanding made at the commencement, and scrupulously carried out by
the Imperial Government, an equivalent number of free immigrants were
conveyed to the Swan River. Thus, in the nine years from 1855 to the
end of 1863, 4,800 convicts and 4,850 free immigrants, whose passages
were paid from England, arrived. Some of the participants in the Irish
rebellion of 1848 were amongst the convict class.</p>

<p>The system ended very largely in consequence of vigorous protests
made by the other Australian colonies against the continued shipping of
British felons to any part of the continent. The last convict ship to
bring its unhappy freight to these shores arrived in 1867.</p>

<p>The introduction of a labour supply, even from this muddied source,
did undoubtedly relieve the depression in 1840 and the following years,
and it was especially valuable in providing the Government with labour
for the construction of roads and bridges and the erection of public
buildings. Moreover, the maintenance of the system on the banks of the
Swan cost the Imperial Government 98,000 pounds per annum, and the
expenditure of a large part of this money on commodities produced in
the colony necessarily benefited the settlers. But in the long run the
system was not advantageous. The deposit of 600 convicts per annum in
Perth soon made the portion of the population who had been sentenced
more numerous than the free settlers. Many of those whose term of
service expired drifted to the other colonies, or, as a memorial
forwarded to the Imperial Government from those colonies stated,
'Western Australia is, in fact, a mere conduit pipe through which the
moral sewage of Great Britain is poured upon those communities.' The
expirees who remained in Western Australia entered into competition
with the free people and made them discontented with the system, which
constantly tended to drive out the free class. From England's point of
view convictism, as practised in Western Australia, was a costly
failure. As the Under-Secretary for the Colonies said, 'Our experiment
has been anything but successful; the establishment has been enormously
costly in proportion to the relief which this country has enjoyed.'
England, indeed, would have dropped the system before 1867 had it not
been believed that its continuance was a convenience to Western
Australia. When it became clear that such was no longer the case, and
that the eastern and southern colonies very deeply resented the further
contamination of the country, it ceased.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII - SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND THE WAKEFIELD THEORY</h3>

<blockquote><b>Wakefield's <i>Letter from Sydney</i>--His theory of
colonization--The Colonial Office and Wakefield's Principle--Act to
establish South Australia-- Colonists at Kangaroo Island--Colonel Light
selects site of Adelaide-- Recall of Governor Hindmarsh--Gawler's
governorship--Grey appointed Governor--His reforms.</b></blockquote>

<p>The failure of Thomas Peel's Swan River experiment occurred at a
time when much interest was being taken in England in systematic
colonization. The Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars had thrown Europe
into disorder for a quarter of a century, and parallel with them went
the creation of the great change in conditions of manufacture which is
known as the industrial revolution. The new system, while it made
employers rich, plunged the mass of the working classes into deep
poverty. Pauperism was 'breaking down the country,' though the total
wealth of England was increasing enormously. Wages were miserably low,
food was dear, and there was not sufficient employment to absorb the
thousands who saw their old hand-industries rapidly disappearing in
consequence of the application of steam-driven machinery to production.
Emigration was advocated as a remedy for these painfully manifest ills.
England was believed to be over-populated. But she had vast empty
possessions oversea. These could be used to relieve the pressure at
home. But there was a desire to use them in a systematic, scientific
manner. The time was ripe for some one to show how this was to be
done.</p>

<p>The man who came forward with the most convincing plan was Edward
Gibbon Wakefield. This ingenious and persuasive writer (who had spent
some time in Newgate prison, whither he had been consigned for marrying
a ward in chancery), published in 1829 a little book called <i>A Letter
from Sydney</i>, which immediately captivated the minds of many
politicians and officials who were searching about for a rational
theory of colonization. It was. written in so attractive and vivid a
style that not only contemporaries, but some later historians also,
thought that it proceeded hot from the personal experience of one who
had studied Australian conditions on the spot. Thus, Sir Spencer
Walpole, in his <i>History Of England</i> (vol. vi., p. 360), stated
that 'the letter was written from Sydney.' But, in fact, Wakefield had
never been to Sydney, nor to any other colony. He wrote his little book
in London; but he was so plausible, and he put into it so many cunning
and racy little. touches, that he made people believe that he was
describing what he had observed.</p>

<p>Wakefield followed up his success by writing numerous articles and
letters in public journals, and by discussing his ideas with prominent
men, until quite a large party was formed which believed in him as the
genius who had at last given to the world the true and only plan of
founding and working a colony on sound lines. The Wakefield Principle
was always mentioned by some journals with the reverential homage of a
capital letter, and there were advocates of it who, as a distinguished
critic said, regarded it as 'the one thing needful to make mankind
rich, virtuous, and happy for the rest of their time on earth, a
specific for all the disorders of the world.'</p>

<p>Now, the Wakefield Principle was the very opposite of the plan which
Thomas Peel had endeavoured to carry out in his Western Australian
colony; and, as the news of that failure was being much discussed in
the very year when the LETTER FROM <i>Sydney</i> was published,
Wakefield and his supporters were able to stress the virtues of their
own theory by reference to the obvious defects of others. Peel had
sought to attract settlers by the offer of an abundance of cheap land.
The very essence of Wakefield's system was that land in a new colony
should never be sold cheaply, but always at a 'sufficient price.'</p>

<p>Wakefield developed his ideas in a number of books and minor
publications, but they may be explained in simple terms as follows. A
colony depends upon three main elements for success land upon which to
settle, capital to apply to the land, and labour to work it. If land in
a new colony is obtainable very cheaply, he argued, labourers will not
continue to work for settlers; for they will soon save enough money to
buy land of their own. Consequently, there will be no dependable supply
of labour. But a colony cannot prosper unless there is an abundance of
labour. Settlers with capital will not come out unless they can get
labour to work their properties. Therefore you require two things:
first, a fund by means of which you can bring to your colony labour
from the mother-country, where there is an excess of it; and, secondly,
a means of keeping them in the position of labourers when you get them
to the colony. If, then, you sell your colonial lands, not very
cheaply, as was done at the Swan River, but at a 'sufficient price' to
enable you with the proceeds of the sales to bring out all the labour
which the colonists require, and if you devote the entire proceeds of
your land sales to this purpose, you will maintain an exact balance
between the land you desire to have occupied, the capital necessary to
develop it, and the labour required to work it. Your labourers will
have to remain labourers for two or three years, because the savings
from their wages will not be sufficient to enable them to buy land of
their own until they get enough to pay the 'sufficient price '; and the
'sufficient price' obtained for the land will enable you to maintain a
constant supply of fresh labour from the overflowing reservoir of
Europe provided (and this was an essential feature of Wakefield's
system) that you do not use the proceeds of land sales for any other
purpose than paying for immigration.</p>

<p>In 1830 Wakefield formed a Colonization Society to carry out his
ideas; and, by a coincidence fortunate for him, it happened that in
that year news arrived of Charles Sturt's great boat journey down the
Murray and his discovery of great areas of fertile land in the basin of
that river. Here, then, were (1) a man with a theory; (2) an
organization formed to give effect to it; (3) an unoccupied territory
where there was scope for an experiment; and (4) a strong public
feeling in favour of a scientific immigration policy. South Australia
was the result.</p>

<p>But, it must be confessed, the experiment was not carried out under
conditions which gave a fair chance to the Wakefield Principle.
Politicians and responsible officials are shy of philosophical
theorists, and many doubted the wisdom of giving over a great province
as a social laboratory wherein an ingenious and pertinacious author
might try his ingenious plans. Wakefield, indeed, had made a sufficient
impression to convince everybody that old modes of colonization were
wrong, but not enough to convince the Government and Parliament that
his own mode was inevitably right.</p>

<p>Moreover the Colonial Office was here, as in Western Australia and
later at Port Phillip, strongly opposed to expansion in Australia. 'The
Secretary of State,' wrote the chief official in 1830, 'does not feel
at liberty at the present moment to hold out any encouragement to
schemes which have for their object the extension of the number of His
Majesty's settlements abroad, and which, whether formed in the outset
by individuals or the Government, are always liable to end in becoming
in some way or other a source of expense to the revenue of this
country.' This antipathy was the first barrier which had to be broken
down.</p>

<p>Wakefield desired to proceed by means of a chartered company, and
the South Australian Land Company was formed for this purpose (1831).
But the Colonial Office objected to 'transfer to the company the
sovereignty of a vast unexplored territory,' and the negotiation broke
down. In 1833 the South Australian Association took up the problem,
still under Wakefield's inspiration, and with the active aid of such
influential Englishmen as George Grote, the historian of Greece, Sir
William Molesworth, and the Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>The Government, under pressure of opinion, at length agreed that a
new colony should be founded, but would not grant a charter to the
company, and insisted that the colony should be placed under a Governor
appointed by the Crown. An Act of Parliament was passed in 1834
establishing the colony of South Australia, with a Governor to preside
over it, but also with a body of Commissioners who were to finance the
concern by raising a loan, and were to control the sale of land, which
was not to be disposed of for less than 12s. per acre. The
transportation of convicts was expressly barred.</p>

<p>The whole project would have collapsed for lack of financial backing
but for the exertions of George Fife Angas, a wealthy and influential
merchant who had taken great interest in it and was appointed a member
of the Board of Commissioners. A capital of 200,000 pounds was required
to float the colony. But how was that money to be raised? The Exchequer
set its hard face against Government aid, and rich philanthropists did
not open their cheque books with any noticeable eagerness. Wakefield's
own band of disciples were not well pleased with the way in which the
Colonial Office had handled the Principle. 'Without some association to
assist the commissioners,' Angas said, 'I do not see how the Act is to
be carried into effect.' He therefore formed a company With a working
capital of 200,000 pounds--the South Australian Company, of which Angas
himself was the chairman. It was this company, not the Government, not
the Commissioners, which really founded South Australia; and of course
those who invested their money in it looked for a reward.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Napier, who had written a book on colonization, was
offered the governorship; but he foresaw that there would be financial
difficulties, and would not accept the post unless he were given some
troops and authority to draw on the British Treasury 'in case of
necessity.' The Government, however, did not intend to accept any
financial obligations, and declined Napier's terms; whereupon he
refused office and went to India, as every student of the history of
that country is aware. The governorship was then accepted by Captain
Hindmarsh, R.N., who had been one of Nelson's officers at the battle of
the Nile.</p>

<p>Two ship-loads of colonists left England in 1836, and arrived at
Kangaroo Island in July of that year. Nobody had been sent in advance
to find out whether Kangaroo Island was a suitable place for
settlement. All that the promoters knew about it they had learnt from
the description of Flinders in his <i>Voyage to Terra Australis</i>,
and from the artist Westall's charming drawings, prepared as
illustrations to that work. On the strength of that meagre amount of
knowledge they had circulated a little book to attract immigrants,
illustrated with an idyllic picture, and an assurance that in this
abode of bliss, where kangaroos and emus placidly grazed under
palm-trees, 'there would be little more revolting to the feelings of an
immigrant than if he had merely shifted his residence from Sussex to
Cumberland or Devonshire.' But the first immigrants found Kangaroo
Island no more suitable for founding a colony than Peel's people had
found Garden Island seven years before.</p>

<p>When Colonel William Light, with his surveying party, arrived in the
RAPID in August he saw at once that this would never do. He therefore
commenced to search for a better place. Having rejected Port Lincoln
owing to its arid environment, and made an examination of St. Vincent's
Gulf, he determined that the best available site was that upon which
the city of Adelaide was afterwards reared. When Governor Hindmarsh
arrived in the BUFFALO in December he was ill pleased with the choice.
A muddy creek, sending its trickle of water through a mangrove swamp,
afforded no fitting spot for the capital of a colony. There was not a
good natural harbour, and Colonel Light's city-area was seven miles
from the sea. There was bitter controversy over the site question.
Hindmarsh favoured Encounter Bay, others preferred Port Lincoln. But
Light persisted that his choice was the right one; and, as the final
authority in this matter had been entrusted to him, his view prevailed.
Light undoubtedly saw further and clearer into the future than his
critics did, and probably nobody nowadays would assert that he was
wrong. In fact, Hindmarsh, though he publicly sided with Light's
opponents, wrote in quite a different strain to London. The city site,
he said, in a letter to Angas, was 'on the bank of a beautiful stream,
with thousands of acres of the richest land I ever saw; altogether a
more beautiful spot can hardly be imagined.' The city was named
Adelaide, after the Queen, at the express wish of William IV.</p>

<p>But the quarrels over this issue developed into others. The Governor
and the representative of the Commissioners could not agree; and, as
the Commissioners were responsible for the business management of the
colony, the Colonial Office recalled Hindmarsh in 1838. He was
succeeded by Colonel George Gawler.</p>

<p>To avoid further trouble between the Governor and the resident
Commissioner, the functions of both were combined in Gawler. But, even
so, he found himself confronted with serious difficulties. The treasury
was 'absolutely empty' at one time during Hindmarsh's period the iron
safe which held the Government funds had contained only 18. 6d. Debts
had been incurred, salaries were overdue, and, as Gawler wrote home
within a fortnight of his arrival, 'the credit of the Government is
injuriously low.' What was a distracted new Governor to do, with
officials and creditors clamouring for payment and no money to meet
their claims? 'I must,' wrote Gawler, 'surpass my instructions, and
look to England for considerable unauthorised financial assistance.' In
other words, he felt compelled to issue bills, which he expected the
Commissioners afterwards to honour.</p>

<p>What had happened in South Australia was that, instead of land being
cultivated and the produce being sold, thus bringing in a legitimately
earned revenue, an orgy of land speculation had been started.
Wakefield's perfectly balanced system, which ought to have run
automatically like a piece of beautifully designed clockwork--land
sold, labourers imported, land cultivated, more land sold, more
labourers imported, more land cultivated, and so on <i>ad
infinitum</i>--had failed to make allowance for that singular human
frailty, the desire to get rich quickly and without working hard. 'Nam
dives qui fieri vult, et cito vult fieri,' as the poet Juvenal wrote.
What actually happened was that land was duly sold, and the money was
sent to England to stimulate immigration, and more people came out, and
bought more land--but (and here the scheme went awry) instead of
cultivating the land, buyers gambled in land values. The first comers,
who had selected the most desirable pieces of land, found that they
could make more money by selling their land to new-comers than by
growing wheat or wool. So they sold, and bought more land, and sold
that, and the second comers did the same; and the third comers joined
in. The South Australia Company itself became no longer a promoter of
colonization but an organization for speculation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the labourers had no work to do; so they crowded into the
town and clamoured at the doors of the Government offices for food. For
a while things 'boomed,' because Gawler, with his bills--which were
believed to be as good as cash--promoted public works. Money, the
proceeds of land sales, went to England, and the Commissioners sent out
some thousands of immigrants. In 1838 nearly 40,000 acres were sold at
one pound per acre, and 2,000 persons arrived. In 1839 nearly 60,000
acres were sold, and 6,000 immigrants arrived. By 1841 299,000 acres
had been sold. But only 2,500 acres were under cultivation. Speculation
had plenty to play with, and the scramble for town allotments was
exciting while it lasted; but the plough rusted for lack of a
furrow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was no legitimate field of employment for the
immigrants. If Gawler had been a resolute statesman, with a clear
understanding of what was happening, he would have realized that the
young colony was simply bouncing down the read to ruin. But, though an
excellent, well-meaning man, and a brave soldier--he had fought nobly
in the Peninsular War--he had no sense of the kind of desperate remedy
which the situation required. He set the unemployed labourers to work
erecting expensive public buildings. Roads and bridges were built.
Harbour works were commenced. Everything was done on a scale of
substantial completeness that might have caused an ill-informed
stranger to draw the inference that the Governor had a flourishing
revenue at his disposal. But, in fact, Gawler was paying for his
elaborate buildings with bills. Adelaide was a spreading I.O.U. in
stones and mortar. He had actually spent in excess of revenue to the
amount of 291,000 pounds.</p>

<p>When the bills rolled in upon the English Commissioners, and they
reported to the Exchequer, there was a sensation. News drifted through
to Adelaide that the bills had been dishonoured in London. Gawler could
not believe it. The Commissioners had not stopped him while the
expenditure was in progress, and he protested that he considered that
he was pursuing a proper policy in building up the colony and giving
employment to the labourers. But the dishonouring of the bills pricked
the speculation bubble. When those who had purchased the documents for
paying their London creditors found that the paper was worthless
because the Commissioners could not honour it and the Exchequer would
not, there was a total collapse of credit, and thousands who had
fancied themselves rich staggered on the brink of ruin.</p>

<p>On May 10, 1841, a slim, bronzed young officer of twenty-eight, with
piercing blue eyes and a confident, masterful manner, stepped off the
ship <i>Lord Glenelg</i> at Port Adelaide and made his way to
Government House. The same ship carried an important despatch for
Gawler. The officer was Captain George Grey, and the despatch informed
the Governor that, as he had drawn bills in excess of the authority
given to him, he had been relieved of his office, and that Grey had
been appointed to succeed him.</p>

<p>A committee of the House of Commons afterwards inquired into
Gawler's administration, and admitted that the condition of the colony
on his arrival made it necessary for him to exceed his instructions.
They blamed the Act under which the colony was founded, and thought
that the Commissioners had not shown 'any clear foresight of the
necessities of such a community placed in such circumstances.' Gawler's
failure ended the control of the Commissioners, and the Act 'for the
better Government of the Province of South Australia,' passed in 1842,
placed the administration on the footing of a Crown Colony.</p>

<p>Few men have had a more thankless task to perform than George Grey
had when he took up his post. The colony was bankrupt. Many men who
came out with money to invest were penniless. It was the task of this
remarkable imperial statesman, whose connection with Australia extended
from these early days of distress and failure down to the beginnings of
the federation movement, to rescue South Australia, to place it firmly
on its feet, to make production take the place of speculation. Grey
acted with firmness, and occasionally with audacity but he performed
his task. The British Exchequer at first absolutely refused to accept
financial responsibility for the debts incurred during Gawler's
administration. But Grey saw that he could not make the colony a
success if the colonists who had taken up the dishonoured bills were
not paid. He therefore persisted in his demand that the Government
should wipe out the obligations, amounting now to a total of 405,000
pounds, in order that South Australia might make a fresh start. It was
a pill which the Exchequer did not like to swallow, but Grey's
stubbornness won. The British Government, though it had previously
refused to comply, was now inclined to relax its attitude and make the
concession, as Grey was ruling with such rigorous economy and such
reforming energy that the colony promised soon to be self-supporting
and prosperous. By the end of 1842 he had 'stopped the leak,' and the
financial crisis was at an end.</p>

<p>Naturally, the cessation of lavish expenditure made Grey unpopular
with those who had profited from it. Even the aboriginals, it is
reported, were wont to say, 'No good Gubner Grey, berry good Gubner
Gawler--plenty tuck out.' But 'plenty tuck out' based on fictitious
credit was what Grey had set himself to end; and he knew that the
progress of agriculture, which he had the satisfaction to witness,
would make for sound and enduring prosperity. He not only did not
refute the attacks upon him, he never read them. But his firm
judicious, and wise rule amply earned the handsome tribute paid by the
Prime Minister of Great Britain, who said in the House of Commons, 'I
must say that in four or five years of his administration he has solved
the problem with a degree of energy and success which could hardly have
been expected from any one. He has extricated the colony and gained the
good-will of both settlers and aboriginals.' Grey's very memorable
governorship of South Australia ended when he was appointed Governor of
New Zealand in 1845.</p>

<p>As explained in Chapter XI, when Major Mitchell came upon Portland
Bay during his overland journey in 1836, he found that the Henty
brothers had formed a settlement there. Their father, an English
farmer, had emigrated with his whole family from Sussex eight years
before, attracted by the prospect of becoming possessed of a great
estate on the Swan River. But the Hentys were amongst those who
discovered that the reality fell far short of the fancy picture drawn
by the promoters of Thomas Peel's colony; and the family, after
prospecting for hundreds of miles and finding no piece of land upon
which they would care to settle, transferred their capital to Van
Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>Thomas Henty was a man of seventy and was possessed of about 10,000
pounds, after realizing his former property in Sussex. His main reason
for leaving England was not to better himself, but to establish his
seven strong and enterprising sons on properties of their own in
Australia. Three of them had wrestled with the Swan River
disappointment for some months after their brothers had departed; a
fourth, Edward, whilst on a cruise examining the southern shores of
Australia, ran into Portland Bay, where not a soul then lived. He saw
there the prospect of establishing a profitable farm. There was
abundance of rich grass land, and there was nobody to dispute his right
to build a home. Thomas Henty went to look at the place, and approved
of Edward's choice; so, in November 1834, they chartered the schooner
THISTLE of Launceston, loaded her with livestock, agricultural
implements, tools, plants, and fishing tackle, engaged labourers, and
with these Edward Henty commenced the first Victorian settlement. A
little later he was joined by his brothers Francis, Stephen, and John;
and the four entered upon a partnership in whaling, sheep-farming, and
cattle-raising. Their father, mother, and three brothers remained in
the southern island. The Hentys had their houses built, their stock at
grass, their gardens under cultivation, long before the Government in
Sydney knew that a single rood of land south of the Murray was
occupied.</p>

<p>Seven years before these sturdy Sussex yeomen fixed upon Portland
Bay two Launceston men, J. T. Gellibrand and John Batman, had proposed
to Governor Darling that they should be allowed grants of land at
Westernport, where they wished to pasture sheep, cattle, and horses to
the value of 4,000 pounds. But in 1827 Darling was not eager to
encourage settlement there. The Westernport settlement which had been
started lest the French should select a site, was abandoned at the end
of 1826, and the Governor was not disposed to allow private persons to
try to succeed where an official settlement had failed. So he minuted
the application: 'Acknowledge, and inform them that no determination
having been come to with respect to the settlement of Westernport, it
is not in my power to comply with the request.'</p>

<p>But John Batman, a man of dogged perseverance, fond of adventure,
fixed his gaze steadily on the mainland to the north of Bass Strait,
interest in which was increased when the story of Messrs. Hume and
Hovell's overland journey was published. In 1834 he joined a syndicate
of fifteen Launceston men who found the money for sending out a small
expedition to examine Port Phillip. In a thirty-ton schooner, the
REBECCA, Batman put forth in May of 1835, landed, and traversed country
which made his eyes sparkle. 'I never saw anything equal to the land; I
never was so astonished in my life,' he wrote in his journal.</p>

<p>Two very memorable things occurred during this expedition. The first
was Batman's encounter with a party of aboriginals with whom he made
what he supposed to be a legitimate bargain for the sale of two tracts
of land, having a total area of about 600,000 acres--rather more than
the whole of Warwickshire. The black-fellows were friendly, and he
distributed knives, scissors, mirrors, and blankets among them. He then
produced two portentous pieces of parchment, previously prepared by
lawyer Gellibrand. Upon each of them was inscribed a rigmarole setting
forth that the 'chiefs' granted this huge territory to him 'with livery
of seisin.' They had, he solemnly wrote afterwards in an official
letter, marked the trees at the boundaries of the territory assigned to
him, 'and they also gave me their own private mark, which is kept
sacred by them, even so much that the women are not allowed to see it.'
He averred that the 'chiefs ' quite knew what they were doing, though
in truth the aboriginals understood nothing of private land ownership.
These untutored children of the bush were supposed to know what 'livery
of seisin' meant; and they even put mystical marks against what Batman
alleged to be their names. The names were such sweet-sounding strings
of syllables as Jagajaga, Cooloolook, and Mommarmalar, and may really
have stood for such noises as the blacks made when Batman asked them
what their names were; but the alleged 'marks,' as an examination of
the original parchment shows, were made by a hand accustomed to use a
pen, which could have been none other than that of Batman himself. Yet
on the strength of these weird documents--copies of which were formally
handed to the 'chiefs'--Batman expressed the hope that 'the British
Government will duly appreciate the treaty which I have made with these
tribes, and will not in any manner molest arrangements which I have
made.' Governor Bourke's reply, when Batman's diplomacy was brought
under his notice, was the issue of a proclamation warning off him and
his syndicate as trespassers on crown land.</p>

<p>The second notable thing done by Batman on this expedition was to
take the REBECCA'S boat up the river Yarra to a place where a ridge of
rocks blocked the inrush of the tide, and where therefore he could
obtain fresh water. He scrutinized the slope on the north bank of the
stream, and pencilled in his notebook these words: 'The boat went up
the large river I have spoken of, which comes from the east, and I am
glad to state about six miles up found the river all good water and
very deep. This will be the place for a village.' Batman did not
discover the Yarra, nor was he the first European to look upon this
site. That had been done in 1803. But he was the man to indicate where
Melbourne would be built; and he actually marked upon his sketch-map
the words 'reserved for a township and other purposes.'</p>

<p>It is very remarkable that, of the six state capitals of Australia,
the only one which stands to-day precisely in the place where it was in
the first Instance intended to build it, is Melbourne. Three of the
states were originally colonized from England, and in not one of those
instances was any survey made, before shiploads of people were sent
16,000 miles, to ascertain where it would be most desirable to put
them. A sensible man would not start to build a house without making a
preliminary examination of the ground available, in order that he might
lay his foundations in the best situation. But no such forethought was
shown in determining the proper localities for three colonies which
were to be the homes of hundreds of thousands of people. New South
Wales was originally intended to be centred at Botany Bay, and had
Arthur Phillip followed the letter of his instructions he would have
commenced his work with misfortune and failure. His own promptitude and
initiative saved the situation there. In the Western Australian
instance the first colonists were left shivering in misery on the white
sand-dunes of Garden Island until the site of Perth was found. South
Australia was intended to be established on Kangaroo Island, which was
lauded in glowing descriptions written by those who had never been
there; but Colonel Light recognized at a glance that a blunder had been
perpetrated, and insisted on the site of Adelaide. The cases of Hobart
and Brisbane are not so serious, though there also the situations
originally chosen were afterwards found to be undesirable. But John
Batman's 'place for a village' was an excellent choice, which had not
to be altered afterwards, and the village--rather large for its name,
however--stands in justification of his judgement.</p>

<p>Batman hurried back to Launceston to report what he had done, and to
advance the claims of his syndicate, the Port Phillip Association, to
the territory which he professed to have acquired by treaty. He left
behind him three of his servants, with three months' rations, to guard
the estate against intruders.</p>

<p>The latter move was not so absurd as it may seem. Batman knew that
there were other Launceston adventurers who had designs upon Port
Phillip. In fact, his rivals were on the move while he was engaged in
writing voluminous letters in support of his claims. The leader of the
opposition party was John Pascoe Fawkner, who, as a lad of eleven, had,
in company with his father, been one of Colonel Collins's party in the
CALCUTTA when that officer's abortive colony at Port Phillip was
founded and abandoned in 1803. Fawkner had purchased the ENTERPRISE,
and was making preparations for an expedition of his own when Batman
returned with his astonishing tale. On July 29 the schooner sailed.
Fawkner himself went on board, but became so ill that he had to be put
ashore. Hardly had the <i>Enterprise</i> entered Port Phillip than
Batman's representatives, in a whaleboat, stopped her and warned her
company that 'trespassers would be prosecuted.' But there was no
quarrel, and the ENTERPRISE worked her way up the bay and the river,
landing Fawkner's people on the very site which Batman had selected for
his village.</p>

<p>Three days later appeared J. H. Wedge, Assistant Surveyor-General of
Van Diemen's Land and one of Batman's syndicate, who informed the
invaders that they were encamped upon the tract of land obtained by
Batman 'by a treaty with the natives.' But both parties remained, and
both were alike trespassers in the view of Governor Bourke. The solemn
proclamation issued by him commenced: 'Whereas it hath been represented
to me that divers of His Majesty's subjects have taken possession of
lands of the Crown'; it admonished them that they were liable to be
dealt with 'as other invaders upon the vacant lands of the Crown'; and
it ended with the customary flourish, 'God save the King.'</p>

<p>But it was useless to issue prohibitions. Batman's party and
Fawkner's were alike eager discoverers of good pastures, and at Port
Phillip they found great areas of grass-land upon which thousands of
sheep and cattle could fatten. To permit this great stretch of rich
country to remain unoccupied was absurd. Even before either of the
rival syndicates could bring their sheep across Bass Strait, a third
claimant, John Aitkin, landed a flock on the east side of Port
Phillip--near Arthur's seat--and became the first squatter in this part
of Australia; and there was quite a rush of land-seekers to the new
territory before any of them knew of Governor Bourke's proclamation.
'All I see I claim,' was the rule of the new-comers as they ascended
hills overlooking desirable territory.</p>

<p>It is clear from the official correspondence that Port Phillip was
not settled with the countenance of the British Government, but in
spite of its disapproval. The Colonial Office did not conceal its
vexation. The Under-Secretary (R. W. Hay), wrote in December 1835, with
reference to Batman's case, 'all schemes of this kind have been of late
years discountenanced as leading continually to the establishment of
fresh settlements and fresh expense; and if every one were allowed to
follow his own inclination by selecting a fit place of residence on the
coast of New Holland, all hopes of restricting the limits of our
settlements in that quarter must be at once abandoned.' The limitation
of settlement was, then, the policy of the Colonial Office. The
expansion of settlement was the policy which the colonists themselves
enforced.</p>

<p>To eject the settlers was out of the question. They had entered into
occupation of vacant land and could not be got out of it by issuing
proclamations, and writing letters from Downing Street. Governor Bourke
reported to the Secretary of State that he 'simply could not prevent'
settlers from pasturing their flocks and herds outside the official
boundaries. Something would have to be done to regulate the settlement
and adjust the claims. The Crown asserted a right over the whole of the
territory comprised within the Governor's commission, and that
certainly included Port Phillip. By an Act passed by the Governor and
Council of New South Wales earlier in 1835, the occupation of crown
lands without authority, by residing or erecting any hut or tent upon
them, was made an offence punishable by fine; but when that Act was
passed the spontaneous rush of settlers into Port Phillip was not
contemplated. Still, the lands there came within the purview of the
Act. Even the learned counsel in London, whose opinion Batman's
Association obtained, advised that 'the Crown can legally oust the
Association from their possession.' The law need not respect the claims
of either Batman or Fawkner, which were mutually asserted with such
energy that there was talk of using force. Each party resented the
intrusion of the other and of independent groups of squatters. Some of
Batman's supporters advocated 'at once setting on the blacks to eat
them out or drive them out'; but Batman himself would have no violence.
'I should think a long time,' he wrote, 'before I would cause the
natives to use anything like violence towards any whites, as I fully
agree as to the consequences that might occur hereafter towards
ourselves.' So the rivals lived on uncontrolled by authority,
disregarding Bourke's proclamation, frowning upon each other, and
brandishing their fictitious claims, until, in May 1836, Bourke sent
over a police magistrate to report upon the situation.</p>

<p>The magistrate, George Stewart, found 177 people settled upon or
near the site of Melbourne, and they had 26,500 sheep. There were about
800 aboriginals in the vicinity. Already conflict between the whites
and the blacks had occurred. The aboriginals had no notion of law or
property. They speared and ate the settlers' sheep, and the settlers
felt it to be necessary to 'teach them a lesson.' The Government at
Sydney was compelled to take notice of these outrages, and it was also
necessary to have a magistrate permanently on the spot, invested with
administrative powers.</p>

<p>In August 1836, therefore, Bourke sent over Captain William Lonsdale
of the 4th (King's Own) Regiment to take charge. He was not only to
exercise the ordinary functions of a magistrate, but was also to take
'the general superintendence in the new settlement of all such matters
as require the immediate exercise of the authority of the Government.'
He was to protect the natives, endeavouring 'to conciliate them by kind
treatment and presents,' and to 'improve by all practical means their
moral and social condition.'</p>

<p>Lonsdale arrived upon the scene on September 29 in the RATTLESNAKE,
Captain Hobson, and from that time the career of the Port Phillip
District, hereafter to become the state of Victoria, commenced.</p>

<p>The first important piece of business which Lonsdale had to
undertake was to determine where the settlement was to be permanently
fixed. Batman's and Fawkner's people had both erected their huts on the
slope on the north side of the Yarra. But from some aspects a situation
closer to the sea seemed more desirable. There was a good site near to
the anchorage, named Gellibrand's Point. But there was an inadequate
water supply there, whereas Batman's 'place for a village' offered an
abundant supply. 'I examined several places for location previously to
coming to any determination,' wrote Lonsdale to the Governor, 'and have
finally fixed upon the place already chosen as the settlement, and
where the greatest number of persons reside'; this 'being the most
convenient place for the performance of my civil duties, I have
selected it.'</p>

<p>Robert Russell, the surveyor, commenced to plot out a township; and
in March 1837 Sir Richard Bourke himself came from Sydney to inspect
and name the settlement. His perception of the probable trend of
development was less clear than that of Lonsdale, for he thought that
Gellibrand's Point was the more important position, and named it
Williamstown, after the sovereign, whilst he gave to the 'village' the
name of the Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne. Bourke was only just in
time to connect this new province with the pre-victorian era by giving
the name of the last male sovereign of the Hanoverian dynasty to one of
its towns. Three months later William IV was dead.</p>

<p>Lonsdale continued to administer the Port Phillip District till
1839, when C. J. Latrobe was appointed Superintendent, or
Lieutenant-Governor. In the mean time the settlement had spread so
rapidly and the mass of business requiring attention was so large and
complex, that it was no longer possible to govern the district from
Sydney. To Latrobe was therefore entrusted a wide margin of discretion,
and, as he proved himself to be an energetic and capable officer, the
control of affairs was left in his hands, subject only to the general
supervision of the Governor, to whom he was subordinate.</p>

<p>The claims based by Batman on his 'treaty' with the eight 'chiefs'
were of course not recognized. The lands of Port Phillip were placed
under the same regulations as affected the remainder of the territory
of New South Wales, and will be more particularly considered in Chapter
XVI. The Port Phillip Association pressed its case very pertinaciously,
and at length the Government of New South Wales agreed to recognize its
pioneering work to the value of 7,000 pounds, to be paid in land.
Accordingly, in February 1838, an agent of the company attended a land
sale, and bought 9,500 acres near Geelong for 7,919 pounds, of which
7,000 pounds was remitted by the Government.</p>

<p>Batman himself did not live long in the country to which he had come
in such strange circumstances. He died in 1839. It cannot be said that
he was generously treated. Even his little house and garden of twenty
acres close to the Melbourne township were taken away from his widow,
the Government merely allowing the building material to be removed from
the ground 'as an indulgence.' The day of free land grants was gone.
But Batman, whatever amusement may be derived from his treaty, had done
enterprising and courageous work, and he was personally an estimable
man. There were ex-convicts across the Murray enjoying enormous incomes
through the mere good luck that they had come to the country at a time
when land was easily obtained, and had grown rich in consequence of the
rise in values created by the growth of population. By contrast this
genuine pioneer of settlement was shabbily handled. He did not happen
to be one of fortune's favourites, and the haughty frown of authority
was turned more severely on him, perhaps, because he had forced the
road for advancing settlement in spite of official disapproval.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the same policy, the Hentys of Portland were not
permitted to hold unquestioned the land upon which they had settled in
1834; though after much correspondence they were awarded compensation
to the value of 1,750 pounds. The pioneers were certainly not treated
liberally by the Government.</p>

<p>The reasons why settlements were made at Hobart in 1803, and at Port
Dalrymple, (Launceston) in 1804, have been explained in Chapter VIII.
Colonel David Collins, the founder of Hobart and its
Lieutenant-Governor during the remainder of his life, died there in
1810, and his second in command, Lieutenant Lord, incurred the censure
of Governor Macquarie by spending 500 pounds on his funeral. The
undertaker's bill, which is extant, is surely one of the most curious
documents of the kind on record. It included 120 yards of material for
the pall, 11 black gowns for marines' wives, 11 pairs of stockings for
ditto, 11 petticoats for ditto, a large number of handkerchiefs, and
two gallons of the best vinegar! Collins wrote the first HISTORY OF NEW
SOUTH WALES, and his work endures as an authentic and interesting
contemporary record of the establishment of British rule in Australia.
In the same year died, on his way home to England, Colonel Paterson,
the founder and Lieutenant-Governor of Launceston, and one of the
principal officers in the service of Australia since the days of
Phillip.</p>

<p>The history of Van Diemen's Land while it remained a dependency of
New South Wales is that of a penal settlement whose system of control
presented no remarkable difference from that of the parent colony.
After the death of Collins and the departure of Paterson the dual
lieutenant-governorships of Hobart and Launceston gave place to a
single Lieutenant-Governor, appointed from England. The first was
Colonel Davey (1813-17), a marine officer who had fought under Nelson
at Trafalgar. A jovial but eccentric man, who made his official entry
into Hobart in his shirtsleeves, with his coat over his arm, because
the weather was hot, Davey secured popularity by means which were not
calculated to maintain either a fair standard of discipline or respect
for his office. He would frequently carouse with boon companions,
including convicts, and he revelled in rough, horseplay frolics. With
those who pleased him he would drink deep; those who offended him he
would flog or hang. He required plenty of rum and rope. This rollicking
Toby Belch resigned under pressure from Governor Macquarie, who sternly
disapproved of his manners and methods.</p>

<p>Davey was succeeded by Colonel William Sorell, of the 48th regiment,
an excellent man and an admirable administrator. He was the last of the
Lieutenant-Governors who ruled in subordination to the
'Governor-in-Chief' in New South Wales.</p>

<p>Colonel George Arthur inaugurated the new system of rule in 1825, a
year after he assumed office. Under an Act passed by the Imperial
Parliament, power was taken to separate the Government of Van Diemen's
Land from that of New South Wales. A Legislative Council was appointed,
consisting of seven members, with powers and functions similar to those
exercised by the corresponding body in the older colony; and the
Lieutenant-Governor was given an Executive Council to advise him. The
administration of justice was purified and strengthened. The island was
divided into police districts, each under a paid magistrate. A Supreme
Court was established. Arthur showed that he meant to keep a tight rein
over the execution of the law by peremptorily dismissing the
Attorney-General, Gellibrand, for having taken fees from a client for
drawing the pleadings in his case and afterwards appearing against him
in court.</p>

<p>Throughout its history as a convict settlement Van Diemen's Land was
the scene of such a degree of callous brutality as can hardly have been
equalled in any other country within civilized times. Statesmen like
Russell and Grey said that the assignment system really meant slavery;
but; in truth, slavery as practised in America and elsewhere was
usually conducted with less cruelty than was the assignment system in
this beautiful island. That it was accompanied here by a degree of
degradation and torture surpassing what prevailed in New South Wales is
to be explained by several circumstances. From the beginning the
convicts were to a large extent a worse class than those who were
detained in New South Wales. Hobart was originally peopled with drafts
from Norfolk Island, and that station had been used (though not
exclusively so) as a place of intensified punishment for those who
committed offences after transportation. Consequently it was thought
necessary to make the discipline harsh. The class of convicts available
for assignment to settlers being generally less dependable than was the
case at Sydney, a custom of desperately severe punishment became
established. The magistrates ordered the application of the lash on the
mere complaint of an angry master. There are recorded instances of
assigned servants being mercilessly whipped for the 'insolence' of
smiling when given an order. Magistrates would flog a man to the point
of collapse on his master's request by letter. No evidence of
wrongdoing was required; the mere application was sufficient. Semblance
of justice there was none. Governor Arthur stated in evidence that, of
17,000 convicts in Van Diemen's Land in 1833, 5,000 had never had any
complaints made against them, and he regarded this as a favourable
circumstance. But obviously his own figures showed that 12,000 had had
complaints made against them--and the simple making of a complaint
entailed flogging.</p>

<p>So much was Van Diemen's Land regarded as a place for the reception
of desperate characters that in 1821 Macquarie Harbour, on the west
coast of the island, was especially chosen as a place of punishment for
the very worst class of criminals. Situated on a lonely, bleak, rugged,
and rain-drenched coast, frowned over by huge mountain masses of such
desolate aspect that the navigator Flinders looked upon their peaks
'with astonishment and horror,' fronted by a sea constantly subject to
the fury of Antarctic gales, Macquarie Harbour became a place of wrath
and groans for untamed desperadoes. Here, covered by the muskets of
their jailers, prisoners were clad in the coarse, ugly, yellow dress,
marked in black with broad arrows, which was the distinctive and
detested garb of the incorrigible class of offenders. Ordinary convicts
wore grey or blue. Gangs of them laboured at felling the huge trees of
the forests and dragging the timber to the shore, or were loaded with
chains, left cold and hungry on storm-swept rocks, and exposed to
privations that made life an agony and fastened upon many of them
diseases which afflicted them till death. The narrow entrance to
Macquarie Harbour was called Hell's Gate, and the name was not inaptly
chosen. It was used for its dreadful purpose until Governor Arthur
reared a new prison on the Tasman Peninsula and set a guard of armed
constables and a complete chain of trained ferocious dogs to patrol the
narrow neck connecting the convict area with the mainland. The walls
and turrets of Port Arthur, standing in picturesque ruin in a scene of
solitary grandeur, remind later generations of a grim and terrible
past.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for the abandonment of Macquarie Harbour was that
it aggravated the trouble with bushrangers, which became acute during
the governorships of Davey, Sorell, and Arthur. Bushranging grew
naturally out of the conditions of the violent and profligate society
which coined this convenient word for it. We read of 'William Page, the
bushranger,' in the Sydney <i>Gazette</i> as early as 1806, and Bligh,
writing of the state of Van Diemen's Land in 1809, referred to 'a set
of freebooters, bushrangers as they are called.'</p>

<p>Both in Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales great, unoccupied
spaces at the back of the settled portions offered unrivalled
opportunities to men inclined to a lawless, predatory life. Convicts
who had served their sentences or escaped from servitude would often
'take to the bush,' steal a horse, roam around plundering, and lead a
life of wild excitement until they were shot or caught. More dangerous
were bands of armed bandits who lived by outrage and spoliation. Van
Diemen's Land was the scene of wild bushranging escapades for about a
score of years, the worst cases being those who had fled from custody,
and, knowing that they would be hanged if they were caught, united
cunning and bush-craft to the daring required by the life they led.
There were mountain fastnesses hiding deep glens where a man could
conceal himself with little risk of discovery. Kangaroo meat was
abundant. A raid upon a country station, the robbery of a mail, the
plunder of a store would furnish other requirements.</p>

<p>Macquarie Harbour proved to be very difficult to manage. Its stormy
approaches made it inaccessible at certain seasons. To escape from the
secluded and desolate place, either by boat, or by land across
trackless mountains and through thick tangles of the peculiar
horizontal scrub which grows in the western part of the island, was
indeed a desperate adventure. About a hundred tried, but most of them
perished in the attempt or were shot. A party who got away to the bush
were driven by hunger to murder each other, and ten are known to have
been killed and eaten by their companions. Two of the wretched
survivors were captured with portions of human flesh still in their
possession. A few escaped and joined others of their class in
plundering raids. Many assigned servants, there is no doubt, were
driven to consort with the outlaws by the cruelty with which they were
treated by their inhuman masters, and it is not strange that these took
a terrible revenge on their former oppressors.</p>

<p>The bushranging evil was at its height when Arthur became
Lieutenant-Governor. An army of as many as a hundred resolute ruffians,
well mounted and fully armed, roamed over the country in 1825, imposing
a reign of terror upon settlers. They murdered, burnt, and pillaged.
Brady, a Macquarie Harbour escapee, led a band which captured the town
of Sorell, surprised and locked up the military force sent to arrest
them, and liberated the prisoners in the jail. In Launceston the same
brigand chief conducted a raid with the organized skill of a military
operation. Michael Howe, the most notorious of the bushrangers of this
period, called himself 'Governor of the Rangers,' and the head of the
Government 'Governor of the Town,' and so largely did this foul rascal
terrorize the country that there was a smack of truth in the
saying.</p>

<p>Governor Arthur was compelled to take the suppression of bushranging
in hand in an organized fashion. Farms were barricaded against attack
and loopholed for defence. A law was enacted enabling any settler to
shoot at sight a convict in arms. Companies of soldiers, strengthened
by armed settlers, swept over the country in search of the malefactors.
Arthur himself took part in the hunt, which was so thoroughly pursued
that thirty-seven bushrangers were tried and sentenced to death at one
sitting of the court. More than a hundred were hanged in the two years
1825-6. If these vigorous measures did not eradicate bushranging--and
they did not because it was an inevitable consequence of depositing
thousands of criminals in a rough and sparsely populated country--at
all events they suppressed the most serious aspect of the evil, the
ravaging of the colony by organized companies.</p>

<p>Some popular fiction of a later date has cast a kind of glamour over
bushranging, just as in England poetry and romance have gilded the
deeds of the highwayman. But in sober truth there was no chivalry in
the escapades of these men. They were simply ferocious criminals,
dangerously at large.</p>

<p>There was some bushranging on the mainland, and in 1834 Dr. Wardell,
Wentworth's friend, was shot dead by a bushranger in the grounds of his
own house in New South Wales. The depredations and capture of the Kelly
Gang in Victoria (1880) made a very exciting story of crime and
adventure. But the trouble in the mainland colonies never attained the
proportions that it did in Van Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>The bushrangers were only partly responsible for the 'Black War,'
which led to the extermination, within half a century, of one of the
races of Mankind--<i>Homo Tasmanianus</i>. The aboriginals of Van
Diemen's Land were different from those of the mainland. At some remote
geological period there was land connection between the island and
Australia. But a subsidence of the ocean bed broke the bridge, and left
the negrito stock isolated and unaffected by the fresh blends which
changed the characteristics of the mainland blacks. These natives were
disposed to be a harmless and peaceable people. English and French
explorers who had met with them had found them unaggressive and
good-humoured. Had they received decent treatment they would not have
been likely to cause trouble. But neither the settlers nor their
assigned servants would allow the natives to live in peace. As
settlement spread, cases of murder and outrage were frequently
reported. The evidence is conclusive that the wrong-doing was on the
side of the whites. 'The resentment of these poor, uncultivated
blacks,' wrote Davey in a proclamation of 1813, 'has been justly
provoked by a most barbarous and inhuman mode of proceeding, viz. the
robbing of their children. Let any man put his hand to his heart and
ask which is the savage, the white man who robs the parent of his
children, or the black man who boldly steps forward to resent the
injury and recover his stolen offspring.' During Sorell's term of
office the outrages continued, aggravated now by the fiendish
depredations of the bushrangers. No form of physical torture and moral
wrong was spared to these hapless children of nature by the decadent
outcasts of civilization who were thus thrust among them.</p>

<p>It was but natural that the aboriginals should at length turn upon
their oppressors; and this they were doing when Arthur became
Lieutenant-Governor in 1824. The revenges which they took did but
increase the number of those who shed their blood. Black hated white,
and white thirsted for the blood of black. But the whites had the
better weapons. Waddies and spears were no match for muskets. Blacks
were shot in groups, as they bathed or sat round their camp-fires at
night. John West, the author of a HISTORY OF TASMANIA, who wrote near
enough to those times to get his facts from living witnesses, tells the
story in one vivid sentence: 'The wounded were brained; the infant cast
into the flames; the bayonet was driven into the quivering flesh; the
social fire around which the natives gathered to slumber became before
morning their funeral pile.'</p>

<p>Arthur was well informed as to the treatment which the aboriginals
had received, and made an honest effort to protect them. An Aborigines
Protection Committee, formed under his direction, pointed out that the
instances of savage vengeance which the native people had taken were
the result of injuries they had received. But he could not, as a
responsible administrator, permit a state of anarchy to prevail. The
blacks no longer made any distinction between friends and foes. They
killed all whites who came within range of their spears. Arthur tried
to abate the evil by offering rewards for the capture of aboriginals
uninjured--5 pounds for every adult and 2 pounds for every child--and
this led to the formation of capture parties, who hunted them like
game. John Batman, the Port Phillip pioneer, distinguished himself by
the employment of kinder methods to secure the surrender of blacks.</p>

<p>As, however, the efforts of these independent parties did not
sufficiently abate the trouble Arthur determined to organize a great
'drive,' with the object of sweeping the whole of the blacks in the
centre and south of the island into the Tasman peninsula. A complete
chain of soldiers, police, and armed settlers stretched right across
the country from the Great Lake to St. Patrick's Head on the east
coast. Nearly five thousand men shared in the operations, and the
Governor himself took supreme command. The forces were marshalled under
military officers, each of whom superintended the scouring of an
allotted area. Great stores of cartridges, guns, and handcuffs, were
gathered.</p>

<p>The line commenced the advance southward on October 7, 1830, and
every man in it believed that he was helping to push the natives into a
compound where they would be held as captives. But at the conclusion of
the operations only one man and a boy had been caught. With these
exceptions the whole of the aboriginals had quietly slipped through the
line. Arthur's Black Drive cost 30,000 pounds, and was as futile as
trying to catch sunbeams with a butterfly net.</p>

<p>After this failure George Robinson, a Methodist bricklayer, who had
already had a little experience among the aboriginals, had learnt their
language, and had a warm-hearted sympathy with them, made a proposition
which seemed to his contemporaries to mark him out either as a lunatic
or an impostor. He actually proposed to go among them unarmed, as a
friend, to reason with them, and explain to them that, however some
settlers and convicts might treat them, the object of the Government
was to better their condition. His one stipulation was that the hunting
of the blacks should cease, and that it should be prohibited even to
carry firearms in their presence. And this little obscure man did
wonderful things. He tramped hundreds of miles, he endured
extraordinary hardships, he dared anything to accomplish his mission;
and the most wonderful of all the things he did was to show that these
hunted black people had the souls of human beings, and to bring their
souls into grateful communion with his own. He took a few blacks whom
he knew well as companions, and, guided by them, visited the far-off
hiding-places where the tribes had taken refuge. Often he was in grave
danger, but his cool confidence always saved him. He would walk up to a
group of warriors who had their spears poised to hurl at him, and shake
hands with them. He led the remnant of one of the most savage tribes to
Government House in Hobart, where Arthur, to welcome them, ordered the
brass band to play. The natives screamed with terror, and clustered
round Robinson for protection.</p>

<p>It was evident, however, that there could be no settlement of the
difficulty so long as aboriginals, settlers, and convicts lived
together in the same country. Robinson could not be everywhere at once.
He could make the tribesmen do anything by sheer force of persuasion,
but where he was not trouble recurred. It was, therefore, resolved in
1832 that Robinson should gather together all the surviving blacks and
should take them to Flinders Island in Bass Strait. This policy was
carried out in 1835, though the total number removed was only 203, the
survivors of a race of whom several thousands were living when Van
Diemen's Land was first colonized by Europeans. This small community
was tended by Robinson and others with every kindness. But all efforts
to keep the race alive failed. They sickened and pined and died. Some
half-castes still remain, but the last pure-blooded HOMO TASMANIANUS
died in 1860.</p>

<p>The final phases of convictism in Van Diemen's Land will be related
in Chapter XVII. While the island was devoted to penal purposes it was
the place of exile of some remarkable men. Thomas Wainwright, forger
and poisoner, artist and man of letters, the friend of Charles Lamb and
the painter of Royal Academy pictures, was one of these. The Chartist
leaders Frost, Jones, and Williams were transported in 1839 on account
of their share in a riot at Newport, Wales. In an earlier age the
punishment for high treason, of which they were convicted, would have
been death; but these three led very comfortable lives in Van Diemen's
Land, and lived to see nearly all the 'points' of the English chartists
adopted as part of the political system of Australia. The Irish
Rebellion of 1848 brought a distinguished group of political prisoners
to the country, including Smith O'Brien, Thomas Meagher, and John
Mitchel, men of ability and education, who, as Meagher quite frankly
wrote, had 'played for a high stake and lost the game.' They were
marked out for especially considerate treatment, and were allowed a
large measure of freedom on parole. One of them, O'Donohue, started a
newspaper in Hobart, called the IRISH EXILE. They were indeed regarded
as belonging to what Arthur described in an official paper as 'that
class of offenders denominated in familiar language gentlemen
convicts.' 'With a willing heart and ready hand we ought like
honourable men to pay the forfeit and say no more about it,' wrote
Meagher to his friend, Gavan Duffy. Smith O'Brien fretted in exile and
brought upon himself more restraint than he need have done. Mitchel
brought his wife and children from Ireland to live with him. After
nearly five years in the island he made his escape to America, and half
a dozen of his companions, aided by Irish American sympathizers,
managed to do the same.</p>

<p>Another little group of prisoners were the victims (1834) of the
antipathy of the English Government to the beginnings of the Trade
Union movement. George Loveless and four other Dorsetshire labourers
were transported for seven years for their connection with the Friendly
Society of Agricultural Labourers, which pledged its members not to
work for less than 10s. per week. They were liberated in response to
public agitation in 1836. Loveless, a sincere and honest man, who
worked with a simple desire to improve the lot of his fellows, wrote
after the conclusion of his term of servitude a little book called
<i>Victims of Whiggery</i>, wherein he said some interesting things
about the convict system as he saw it in operation.</p>

<p>One of the most singular characters who inhabited Van Diemen's Land
during these wild, bad years was a tall, blue-eyed Dane named
Jorgensen, a rascal touched with genius, whose life had been crowded
with romance and adventure. He had made discovery voyages under the
command of Flinders, and had been mate on board the <i>Lady Nelson</i>.
He was an officer on the ship which conveyed the first company to
Risdon Cove, and therefore witnessed the establishment of the colony
which he was afterwards to inhabit as a convict himself. On returning
to Europe he had served on a Danish privateer during the Napoleonic
wars, and been taken prisoner by the British. Being sent on a ship to
Iceland to carry provisions to the inhabitants, he most audaciously
captured the Danish Governor and announced to the people by
proclamation that he had been sent by the British Government to annex
the island. He established trial by jury, improved the educational
system, set himself up as Governor, and sent a despatch to London
announcing that he had taken possession of Iceland as a part of the
British Empire. His unauthorised raid was of course disowned. On his
return to England he was sent to the Continent on a secret Foreign
Office mission. After this he gave free play to his gambling
propensities, and, being pressed for money, stole some articles of
furniture from his lodgings. For this offence he was convicted and
served four years of a sentence of seven in Newgate, where he made
himself useful as an apothecary's dispenser. Liberated from prison upon
his promise to leave the country, he failed to do so, was re-arrested
as an alien at large, and transported for life. In Van Diemen's Land he
had a strange career as explorer, hunter of blacks, and author. He
impressed those who met him as a man of unusual ability. He certainly
was versatile, for he had written books on travel, theology, and
political economy.</p>

<p>The old name of the island whose coasts had been explored by Dutch,
French, and English navigators, and which had witnessed so much agony
and remorse, went with a change of system. Even before transportation
ceased, but when the hope of ending it had taken possession of the
inhabitants, they began to use the name Tasmania; and when
self-governing institutions were conferred upon the island in 1853 that
name was adopted by statute.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI - THE LAND AND THE SQUATTERS</h3>

<blockquote><b>Land grants--Who the squatters were--Pastoral districts
and licences-- Bourke's policy--Special surveys--The pound per acre
system--Gipps's policy--Conquest of Australia by the colonist--Ridley's
stripper--Farrer's Federation wheat--John Macarthur and the wool
trade--The aboriginals.</b></blockquote>

<p>Great Britain, by becoming possessed of Australia, assumed the task
of disposing of an area as large as three fourths of Europe including
Russia. Very much of this country was equal in fertility to the richest
soil in the world, and it was capable, given favourable economic
conditions, of growing every product that can minister to the
necessities or the luxury of mankind. All grades of climate, from
tropical to temperate, were to be found within this capacious dominion.
All kinds of domestic animals would thrive in it. Many nutritious
grasses unknown elsewhere covered its great plains. Immense forests of
valuable timber flourished on its hillsides. Its rocks were veined with
minerals. A wonderful treasury of precious metals was revealed within a
little over half a century.</p>

<p>No one consistent line of policy could have been pursued in making
this country available to those who would use it, first because the
conditions changed, and secondly because it was only gradually that the
possibilities were realized. In the beginning the idea of controlling
the whole continent was not in the minds of British statesmen; indeed,
they did not know that it was a single continent. Even if they had
known, they had no idea of its value. They merely wanted a remote piece
of territory for the purposes of a convict colony. If, for instance
Napoleon had said that he desired to have a piece of Australia for
France when negotiating the Treaty of Amiens in 1800, there is no
reason to believe that Great Britain would have objected. The area
defined by the Commission of the Governor of New South Wales was quite
sufficient for her purpose; and she gave up possessions which seemed to
her, then, to be more valuable than this country was.</p>

<p>It would be absurd to blame British statesmen for not pursuing a
definite land policy from the commencement, because there was no need
for one. There was plenty of room for convicts and settlers, and it
seemed no great thing to give a wide expanse to a person to whom the
Government wished to be indulgent. Governor Hunter offered 100 acres
and a staff of convict servants to every officer who would cultivate.
During the administration of Grose and Paterson convicts who had not
served their sentences were given slips of paper upon which was
written, 'A. B. has my permission to settle,' and 'this slip of paper
served them as a sufficient authority to fix wherever they pleased.'
There is record of Governors granting as much as 1,280 acres to the
daughters of persons of good standing as a marriage portion. Free
grants were made down to the year 1831, when the Colonial Office
ordered the substitution of the method of sale by auction. By this time
3,963,705 acres had been granted either freely or at a trifling
quit-rent.</p>

<p>When the Blue Mountains were crossed, and the value of the lands
beyond was appreciated, capital as well as immigration was attracted.
The Australian Agricultural Company, incorporated by Royal Charter
under a special Act of Parliament, in 1824, 'for the cultivation and
improvement of waste lands in the colony of New South Wales,' obtained
500,000 acres for nothing. It was even given coal-mines at Newcastle.
Part of the company's estate was selected after 1831, when Governor
Bourke energetically protested against the alienation of so huge an
area, but was overruled by his official superiors. The company thus
richly endowed still carries on its profitable operations. The Van
Diemen's Land Company, which also worked under a Royal Charter (1825),
secured over 400,000 acres for a trifling quit-rent of 468 pounds.</p>

<p>The legitimate allocation of land, whether by grant or sale, in
large or moderate areas, was disturbed by the unauthorised proceedings
of the squatters. The word 'squatter' is of American origin, and was
used in that country in the latter half or the eighteenth century in
very much the same sense as that in which it was at first applied in
Australia. A squatter was a person who entered into occupation of land
to which he had no title. Later use in Australia has given to it quite
a different meaning. A squatter is now conceived as a man who owns or
leases a large quantity of land upon which he grows wool or breeds
cattle or horses. But in the second decade of the nineteenth century,
when the word came into general employment, it signified one who had
gone out to the unoccupied territories and had there, without official
sanction, built a hut and depastured sheep or cattle, which he had
perhaps obtained dishonestly. 'These persons,' said a witness before
the House of Commons Committee of 1815, 'are almost invariably the
instigators and promoters of crime, receivers of stolen property,
illegal vendors of spirits, and harbourers of runaways, bushrangers,
and vagrants.' James Macarthur (the son of John) writing in a similar
strain in his book on New South Wales (1837), spoke of 'persons
denominated squatters,' as 'mostly convicts holding tickets of leave or
having become free by servitude'; they carried on 'an extensive system
of depredation upon the flocks and herds and the property of the
established settlers.'</p>

<p>Squatting, apart from these dishonest characteristics, was a natural
consequence of the absence of a land policy suited to the changed
conditions. As long as the Government gave land away to applicants
possessed of capital, and to others whom it wished to benefit, persons
who were not so favoured regarded the great areas beyond the mountains,
which were not bestowed, as available to those who chose to occupy
them. It was useless to try to restrain settlement within prescribed
limits while there was valuable grassed land stretching for hundreds of
miles beyond the official boundaries. The landless drove far afield in
defiance of regulations. They were trespassers in the eye of the law,
but 'trespassers will be prosecuted' was not a sign which could be
blazoned upon the heavens and made legible across half a million square
miles; and, if it could have been, the early squatters would have taken
no notice of the warning. Moreover, the wool raised by the squatters
was a valuable product, and the more of it produced the greater the
prosperity of the colony. 'As well attempt to confine an Arab within a
circle traced on sand, as to confine the graziers or wool-growers of
New South Wales within bounds that can possibly be assigned to them,'
wrote Governor Gipps in 1840.</p>

<p>But it was clearly necessary to impose some rule in regard to the
occupation of these outlying lands. Governor Bourke therefore devised
the mode of dividing the area whither the squatters had wandered into
'pastoral districts,' and of granting licences to the occupants of
'runs,' for which they wore charged a small fee based upon a
computation as to the number of sheep which a particular run would
feed. The granting of grazing licences suited the squatters, because,
while the licence fee was not heavy, it guaranteed them in the
occupation of the lands upon which they had entered. Bourke's policy,
instituted in 1836, was afterwards embodied in a statute by his
successor, Gipps.</p>

<p>Much commotion was caused among the land-owners in 1835, when doubts
were expressed as to whether the whole of the land grants made in New
South Wales and Van Diemen's Land since the very beginning of
settlement were not illegal. The lords of thousands of acres trembled
at the prospect. The point was first raised in Hobart that these grants
had not been made in the name of the King but of the Governor. The
practice was commenced in the time of Phillip, and had been continued
by every successive Governor. When the law officers of the Crown in
England were consulted, they gave it as their opinion that the whole of
the grants from the foundation of New South Wales were invalid. The
insecurity was removed by the passing of an Act in 1836 (6 William IV,
no. 16), 'to remove such doubts and to quiet the titles of His
Majesty's subjects holding or entitled to hold any land in New South
Wales.'</p>

<p>The regulation imposed by the Colonial Secretary in 1831, that land
should be sold at the minimum price of 5s. per acre, continued till
1838, when the price was raised to 12s. because that was the minimum
fixed in South Australia, and it was clearly impossible to make a
success of that colony if its lands were sold for more than double the
price for which as good or better land could be obtained in New South
Wales. The Wakefield Principle was then occupying much attention in
England, and it especially affected the judgement of a committee of the
House of Commons before which its author gave evidence. This committee,
as well as the Land and Emigration Commissioners appointed to advise
the British Government on colonial land questions, were of opinion that
all land, except town land, whatever its quality might be, ought to be
sold at a fixed price of 1 pound per acre. Instructions were
accordingly sent out that this price should be charged.</p>

<p>Governor Gipps, who thoroughly understood the land question, and was
a singularly able officer, protested that the rule was unwise, and he
took upon himself to disobey it. The English Commissioners, in fact,
and the English Government following their advice, had failed to
observe the great difference in value between country lands and lands
close to a town. These Commissioners, who had no practical experience
of colonial conditions, actually made the regulation that any person
depositing 5,120 pounds might have a special survey made of 5,120
acres, or eight square miles, of country anywhere they chose in
specified districts of New South Wales, except within five miles of a
town. A few men of wealth, who had a shrewd idea that Australian lands
near to towns would become exceedingly valuable, at once lodged their
applications and 40,960 pounds, representing eight instances of the
kind, was paid down before Gipps peremptorily declared that he would
have no more of such foolishness, and refused to allow any more special
surveys to be made. As it was, one of the eight fortunate men, Henry
Dendy, obtained for his 5,120 pounds eight square miles in the present
Melbourne suburb of Brighton, and was offered 15,000 pounds for his
bargain before he had even had a sight of the land, which he had marked
out upon the map. Another special survey purchaser, Elgar, selected his
eight square miles close to the Melbourne suburbs of Kew, Hawthorn, and
Camberwell. Lord John Russell, the Colonial Secretary at the time, had
the good sense to recognize that Gipps had acted rightly in stopping
the special surveys even contrary to instructions; and in 1842 the
Crown Lands Sale Act was brought into force, under which lands were to
be sold by auction with a minimum (not a fixed) price at 1 pound per
acre.</p>

<p>The 1 pound per acre system continued to be followed until the
colonies entered upon the enjoyment of representative government, when
they were at liberty to legislate for their lands as they pleased. The
Legislative Council of New South Wales thought the price too high, and,
moreover, they objected to the provision of the Crown Lands Sale Act
which gave to the Governor the administration of the revenue produced
by the sales. Half of it had to be spent in immigration, the balance on
public works. But the Council considered that itself, and not the
Governor, should have the disposition of the money. The probability is,
however, that the interests of Australia were conserved by maintaining
a rate which seemed excessive in respect to many lands at that time. If
the land had been sold at a lesser price, very much larger estates
would have got into the possession of very few men than was actually
the case.</p>

<p>The later period of the governorship of Gipps was embittered by his
quarrel with the Council on this question; but he kept a stiff back,
and was well supported by the Imperial Government. The unpopularity
which came upon him in consequence of his firm administration of the
law in what he believed to be the enduring interest of the country has
been reflected in some books of Australian history, especially in such
as were written at the time or not long after the controversies in
which he figured. But he was, in truth, a singularly able and a most
conscientious and high-minded Governor. His modest claim on the eve of
his departure, 'I have laboured to the best of my ability to advance
the true interests of this land,' will be confirmed by any fair student
of his rule. Probably Australia has had no abler Governors than were
Sir George Gipps and his predecessor, Sir Richard Bourke.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that mistakes should be made in the distribution
of the great quantity of land which was available in Australia.
Candour, too, requires the admission that much of what may seem to a
later age to have been a policy of prodigality was not wholly unwise
when it was adopted. One generation cannot always anticipate the needs
of its successors. It has to do its best in the circumstances
confronting it. The denunciation of the evils of large estates has been
a common theme in Australian politics in the first decade of the
twentieth century; but such talk would have seemed like the ravings of
lunacy to the people of the first decade of the nineteenth. Then the
desire was to get men for the land; now the desire is to get land for
the men. It was not until about 1820 that the idea dawned upon some
English statesmen that land had been too lavishly given away. 'Large
grants of land to individuals have been the bane of all our colonies,'
wrote Under-Secretary Goulburn in the year just mentioned, 'and it has
been the main object of Lord Bathurst's administration to prevent the
extension of this evil by every means of his power.' But, as we have
seen, the granting of large areas was continued for some years after
1820. Lord Bathurst's spasm of moderation did not affect his
successors.</p>

<p>The conquest of Australia by the colonist has been accomplished by
very hard work aided by science and ingenuity. In many instances land
which at first seemed incapable of profitable cultivation has, by the
application of special methods, proved to be of valuable quality. In
Victoria there is a territory of eleven million acres which in the
early years was regarded as a wilderness, and which Mitchell the
explorer described as 'one of the most barren regions of the world.' It
consisted chiefly of a thick tangle of scrub called mallee,
interspersed with sand. Down to very recent times it was looked upon as
hopeless country. But skill and labour have converted this great
territory into a well-populated place of settlement, rich in yields of
wheat and liberally stocked with sheep and cattle. 'Dry farming,'
evolved by Australian grain-growers, by taking full advantage of the
slight rainfall in districts where the climate is comparatively arid,
and by special modes of culture, has enabled plentiful crops to be
produced on land which without these means would have been impossible
for wheat cultivation.</p>

<p>Very early in the settlement of South Australia the idea occurred to
John Ridley, an ingenious mechanic, that it would be possible to make a
machine to reap. In 1842 there was a plentiful harvest, but there were
not sufficient labourers to gather it. Prizes were therefore offered
for improvements in agricultural machinery. The result was that in 1843
Ridley invented his stripper, the first harvesting machine in
Australia. It was as far removed from the perfected stripper-harvester
of to-day as was Stephenson's 'Rocket' from the modern locomotive; but
it enabled ten or twelve acres to be reaped in a day by one man and two
horses, and it greatly decreased the cost of wheat production. Now,
Australian harvesting machines are in use wherever in the world
climatic conditions approximate to those of the country of their
invention.</p>

<p>Wheat itself has been improved by Australian experiments in
cross-fertilization, in the same ways as the methods of cultivating and
reaping it have been. William Farrer, an Oxford graduate of quiet,
studious habits who had settled down to farming in New South Wales,
generated his 'Federation' wheat as the result of many attempts to
produce a grain rich in yield and resistant of the diseases liable to
attack cereals in this country; and by means of if, he increased the
world's food-supply by millions of bushels and the profits of the
Australian farmer by tens of thousands of pounds.</p>

<p>Sheep-breeding was the first important industry of Australia; and
wool is now produced to an export value of 28,000,000 pounds per annum.
Yet Sir Joseph Banks, in 1803, confidently expressed the opinion that
sheep would not thrive in New South Wales, that the grass was too
coarse, that the climate and soil were not especially adapted for
wool-growing, and that there was no good reason for encouraging the
experiments of John Macarthur. Whether Macarthur was the very first man
to introduce sheep for wool-growing has been disputed. A claim for
priority has been made for the Rev. Samuel Marsden. But certainly
Macarthur's energy and intelligence applied to wool production
demonstrated how great an industry it might become.</p>

<p>Macarthur, in 1794, three years after his arrival in Sydney,
purchased some Bengal ewes and lambs which produced a fleece more like
hair than wool. These he crossed with some English wool-bearing rams,
with the gratifying result that the lambs produced a mingled fleece of
hair and wool of good quality. In 1797 he bought some Spanish sheep,
merinos, from the Cape of Good Hope, taking care to guard the breed
against deterioration. Carefully crossing some of his Spanish rams with
his mixed breed, he noticed a remarkable improvement in the weight and
quality of the fleeces of the progeny. So he persevered in this line of
experiment, with such remarkable results that when he went to England
in 1803 his name was already well known by the woollen manufacturers of
Yorkshire, who manifested the liveliest interest in the prospect of New
South Wales becoming an important source of supply for their industry.
In 1801 the heaviest fleece shorn in New South Wales weighed only 3 1/2
lbs., but in 1802 Macarthur was producing fleeces of fine quality
weighing 5 lbs.; and his wool was worth 3s. per pound, whereas the wool
of coarse-bred sheep brought only 9d. per lb. By 1803 he possessed a
flock of 4,000 sheep, all bred from his Spanish rams. He continued to
breed from merinos only, and was the only person in New South Wales who
did so, others looking to the sale of their sheep for mutton, whilst he
devoted his skill exclusively to the production of fine wool. The
descendants of John Macarthur's original merinos are still kept apart
from the other sheep at Camden Park, an exclusive family of
sheep-aristocrats; though in truth the merino has been much improved by
later breeders, and the best kind of modem fine wool-producing sheep is
superior to the interesting stock of which Macarthur was so justly
proud.</p>

<p>The rapid and successful development of Australia has been
facilitated by the fact that the aboriginals who occupied it before the
advent of the white race were not an organized, warlike people. They
did, it is true, cause some annoyance when population was sparse, but
they never were at any time a serious menace, as were the Maories to
the New Zealand colonist or the fierce Bantu tribesmen to the South
African. They committed murders, but were incapable of anything like
military aggression.</p>

<p>How many aboriginals there were in Australia at the time of
Phillip's foundation of Sydney it is impossible to compute. Philip
thought there were probably 1,500 in Botany Bay and the environs of
Port Jackson. It was estimated that there were about 6,000 in the Port
Phillip District in 1837. There certainly were far larger numbers in
the warmer north, west, and east, than in the south. They were a people
so low in the scale of human development that they had no domestic arts
or domestic animals. They had not learnt to make pottery from clay, or
to extract metals from the rocks, or to cultivate the soil, or to
develop grain and fruits, or to build houses. They lived on fish,
kangaroo, opossum, roots, and wild plants. They hunted and fought with
spears, waddies, and boomerangs. Even the bow was beyond their
invention, though they made string from hair or fibre for their
fishing-nets. It is greatly to be regretted that their tribal
organization was not studied by competent observers in the early years
of the settlement. Nearly all the really valuable ethnological work
amongst them has been done in recent times, principally by Howitt,
Fison, Roth, John Mathew, and especially F. J. Gillen and Baldwin
Spencer. That work has revolutionized our knowledge of primitive human
relationships; so that an eminent authority on classical studies writes
the apparent paradox--which, however, is the simple truth--that the
modern student who would understand prehistoric conditions in Greece
has to go to Australia.</p>

<p>In the beginning the aboriginals were not aggressive. They did not
resent the landing of the white people in their country. Their natural
inquisitiveness made them somewhat of a nuisance, perhaps, and they
were thieves from the white man's point of view because, having no
notion of property, to take what they wanted was natural to them. But
conflicts between blacks and whites were inevitable, despite the desire
of some Governors to be just and humane. The decay of the aboriginals
in the settled districts proceeded very rapidly, from three main
causes: from actual destruction by killing, from disease and drink
introduced among them by the whites, and from the perishing due to the
change of life necessitated by the limitation of their hunting-grounds.
Philanthropic methods failed to keep them alive, though honest efforts
were made to protect and foster them. Sometimes incidents occurred
which suggest that these efforts ran counter to popular feeling. A
French man of science who visited Sydney on the staff of the ship
URANIE in 1818 related in a book which he published about the voyage,
that wealthy inhabitants of the city who entertained the officers
gathered together a company of aboriginals armed with clubs and set
them fighting, giving them liquor to incite their ardour. Two of the
savages were killed, and, says the observer, 'their corpses were
carried out and tea was served amidst the laughter of the
assembly.'</p>

<p>The worst features of the fading out of the native race arose from
sheer brutality and treacherous murder by white settlers and their
convict servants. Governor Brisbane permitted the shooting of
aboriginals in batches. It was said that they committed outrages; but
barbarities perpetrated upon them provoked them to revenge. The lowest
depth of mean homicide was reached by some settlers who systematically
gave natives arsenic in wheaten cakes, porridge, or other food. They
murdered under the guise of kindness. The Rev. Dr. Lang, writing in
1847, stated of his own knowledge and that of other independent
witnesses that this had been done, and G. A. Robinson, who became the
chief protector of aboriginals in Port Phillip after his Van Diemen's
Land experience, alleged that poisoning was undoubtedly one cause of
the decrease of the aboriginals. It was perhaps inevitable that the
native race should fade away in the parts of the country where the
white population became thick, and they were not a people who could be
absorbed or adapted to civilized life; but the tragedy of the process
was very grim and hateful.</p>

<p>The best estimates count the present aboriginal population of
Australia at not more than 100,000, but these reside chiefly in the
interior of Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, and the
Northern Territory. There are not more than a couple of thousand in New
South Wales; only about 250 in Victoria.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII - THE END OF CONVICTISM</h3>

<blockquote><b>Sir William Molesworth's committee on

new prison system--'Pentonvillains'-- Convicts shipped to Port
Phillip--Growth of anti-transportation feeling-- Gladstone's

<p>The whole policy of transportation was elaborately reviewed by a
committee of the House of Commons which sat in 1837-8, and which
presented two very large reports. For some years previously there had
been brisk controversy in England on the subject. Archbishop Whately of
Dublin in particular assailed the system with remarkable vigour, on
three grounds chiefly: first, that it did not diminish crime in Great
Britain, secondly that it did not conduce to the reformation of
criminals, and thirdly that it produced a disgraceful state of
depravity in the colonies into which the convicts were poured. The
system was costing Great Britain between 400,000 and 500,000 pounds per
annum. Was she obtaining an adequate advantage from this expenditure?
Nay, more, was she not actually doing evil?</p>

<p>The agitation induced Sir William Molesworth to move for a committee
of inquiry. The debates upon his motion were very instructive; and the
evidence and reports printed by the committee were startling. Few
official blue-books have contained such an exposure of raw and bleeding
human interest. Novelists have drawn from these papers the colour and
substance of many romances, as Charles Reade did for IT IS NEVER TOO
LATE TO MEND, and Marcus Clarke when he wrote that classic story of
convictism, FOR THE TERM OF HIS NATURAL LIFE. Here were over a thousand
folio pages reeking with crime and cruelty. They could not be read
without shuddering revulsion.</p>

<p>One ex-magistrate who gave evidence boasted that he took a personal
pride in superintending the flogging of prisoners, and that
'twenty-five lashes under my surveillance had the same effect as a
thousand under any other person's hand.' So far from there being any
general reform of prisoners, the evidence showed that many assigned
servants were wont to prowl about at night like beasts of prey,
robbing. 'I suppose,' remarked one of the members of Parliament, 'being
selected from the whole of England, they are the most skilful thieves
in the world?' 'Perfect masters,' replied the witness. Young men
employed their leisure in cockfighting and similar amusements, and the
'young ladies' looked on. Colonel Arthur testified that the dreariness
and hard labour imposed at Port Arthur were so depressing that he knew
of instances of convicts who had committed crimes for the purpose of
getting themselves hanged. 'They were weary of their lives.' Perhaps
the worst feature revealed by the evidence was that decent immigrants
tended to become demoralised by living in a convict colony. 'I think it
is impossible that such a class of persons can be residents in any such
community without the most polluting consequences,' said Colonel
Arthur; and others testified to a like effect.</p>

<p>The committee recommended that transportation to New South Wales and
the settled portions of Van Diemen's Land should be discontinued as
soon as practicable, and made several valuable suggestions for
improving the prison system of Great Britain. Accordingly, in May 1840,
an Order in Council was passed by the Imperial Government, revoking the
Order already in operation as to the sending of convicts to Australia,
but still permitting them to be sent to Van Diemen's Land and Norfolk
Island. Thus, after an experiment of fifty-two years, was
transportation suspended as far as concerned the mainland.</p>

<p>The system had been responsible, down to 1836, for depositing 75,000
offenders in New South Wales and 27,757 in Van Diemen's Land, a total
of over 100,000. At the date mentioned there were actually 44,799
convicts in the two colonies. Very many of these had been transported
under a penal law which was extraordinarily harsh in comparison with
the criminal codes of other civilized countries. and the sentences
inflicted upon them would by a milder age be considered excessively
severe. How many were the victims of poverty it is impossible to
calculate. Political offenders were not very numerous. Many belonged to
the class quaintly denominated 'gentlemen convicts,' or 'specials,' who
were educated people, but usually of undependable character. The mass
were rascals and ruffians, a large proportion of whom were of
desperately bad types, whom no terrors could tame, no system reform.
The country which bred them might well be happy to be rid of them, but
no other land could rejoice to receive them.</p>

<p>Yet Australia benefited from the transportation system both
politically and industrially. But for the problem of disposing of
prisoners which confronted Pitt's Government in the fourth quarter of
the eighteenth century, it is not probable that ministers would have
been induced to form colonies in this country. A use having been found
for it, though an ignoble one, and the discovery being made that Great
Britain had, as it were, stumbled upon an exceedingly valuable
territory, the determination to hold it was inevitable, and the
capacity to do so was a consequence of the omnipotent sea power won
during the Napoleonic wars. When the initial stages of development were
entered upon the abundance of convict labour was a valuable factor. The
radically vicious, it is true, made poor labourers, but not all
belonged to that category. There were amongst them worthy men, branded
by the law, but not inherently bad; and these rendered good service to
their masters in order to win their own freedom. Letters and
reminiscences written by landowners of the assignment era frequently
contain testimony to the fidelity and reliableness of their servants;
and there are some written by convicts wherein a genuine spirit of
contrition and even gratitude is breathed. 'We have as much to eat as
we like,' wrote one of these, 'as some masters are a great deal better
than others. All a man has got to mind is to keep a still tongue in his
head; but if he don't he may as well be hung at once, for they would
take you to the magistrates and get you 100 lashes.' Of course, the
country could have been opened up without convict labour if free
service had been available; but systematic colonization did not become
a political expedient till it had been shown that there was so large a
field for it in Australia. Wakefield did not arouse interest in his
Principle in order to show that there was scope for colonization; it
was the fact of that scope which generated the Principle. The convict
system, therefore, served an important purpose. It gave a start to
occupation which, times and circumstances being what they were, would
hardly have been commenced otherwise.</p>

<p>The cessation of transportation to Australia after 1840 had two
disturbing effects. Great Britain was not ready with an improved prison
system of her own, and she did not immediately repeal the laws under
which offenders were sentenced to be carried oversea. Consequently,
during ensuing years nearly the whole number of her transported felons,
about 4,000 per annum, were poured into Van Diemen's Land. Sir John
Franklin was the Governor at the time when this avalanche of human
frailty commenced to roll upon the island with such disconcerting
volume. Upon him fell the heavy task of regulating it. Franklin's fame
rests upon his achievements as an arctic discoverer, and his
biographers have found no satisfaction in dwelling upon his experience
as Governor of the island jail in the south seas. It was, indeed, an
unhappy one, for, as well as being one of the bravest of men, he was
also the soul of gentleness and scholarly refinement, and his work
cannot have been congenial to his nature.</p>

<p>The new system was disastrous. It not only completely stopped the
inflow of free immigration, but, by creating a glut of convict labour,
it drove free workmen and labourers out of the colony. Whole districts
became depopulated; streets of houses became vacant; tradespeople were
ruined; industry was paralysed. The convicts were domineering in their
preponderance. They had a newspaper of their own, with a convict
editor, who wrote that it would be a good thing to 'kick out of the
colony the free settlers,' who were denounced as 'puritan moralists.'
Dilke, in his GREATER BRITAIN (1868, vol ii, p. 97), said that 'the old
free settlers will tell you that the deadly shade of slave labour has
not blighted Jamaica more thoroughly than that of convict labour has
Van Diemen's Land'; and that blight was flung upon the country during
the years following 1840, when convictism drenched it and submerged the
virile energies of its free population.</p>

<p>The second effect of the order of 1840 was that it suddenly deprived
the landowners of the mainland of the source whence they had derived
their cheap and plentiful labour. Many would have preferred free
labour, but it could not be obtained at so low a price as the labour of
assigned servants had been; and the drying up of the supply was
attended with much inconvenience and loss. An agitation was commenced
among the landowners north and south of the Murray. Some argued that
the evils of convictism outweighed the advantages, but not a few shared
the view crisply expressed by a wealthy wool-grower at a public
meeting, 'I do not care to be ruined for virtue's sake.'</p>

<p>The Imperial Government sought to remedy both troubles by
reintroducing convictism to Australia under a new name and on a fresh
basis. The English Prison Commissioners had in 1840 commenced an
experiment in reformatory punishment. Prisoners who had been sentenced
to transportation were first placed in Millbank jail, whence after a
period of discipline they were drafted to Pentonville, a prison
specially built as a place where the guilty might be passed through 'a
species of crucible of discomfort.' Prisoners were kept in separate
cells, were not permitted to hold converse with each other, were
subjected to periods of solitary confinement for breaches of
discipline, were taught useful trades, and were brought as much as
possible under moralising influences.</p>

<p>These methods were a salutary advance upon the savagery, corruption,
and unsanitariness of the prison life of the past, and were due very
greatly to the labours of such noble reformers as John Howard and
Elizabeth Fry, and to the influence and writings of Jeremy Bentham,
Archbishop Whately, and the reforming school which they led. But
transportation was an essential feature of the 'Probation,' or
Pentonville system. The design was to keep the prisoners in the new
model jail for eighteen months or two years, when the Prison
Commissioners would select such as seemed to have profited by the
treatment, and ship them to the British colonies. They were to receive
'conditional pardons.' The holder of a conditional pardon was,
immediately on landing, perfectly free to go where he pleased, on
condition that he did not return to Great Britain during the currency
of the sentence inflicted upon him. That is to say, if a prisoner
received a sentence of fifteen years for robbery with violence, and he
served a probationary period of two years in Millbank and Pentonville,
he would then, if the Prison Commissioners were satisfied that he was a
reformed character, receive his conditional pardon, would be landed in
a British colony, and would be free to roam about as he pleased as long
as he did not return to Great Britain for thirteen more years. Thus he
would have a larger measure of freedom than an ordinary ticket-of-leave
man, who was kept under official surveillance, or than an assigned
servant under the old system, who was subject to discipline. The new
method consequently meant the turning loose of a large number of
convicted felons on the colonies to which they were despatched.</p>

<p>In 1844 Pentonville had its first batch of 370 convicts ready for
export, and they were placed on board a ship. But the Prison
Commissioners, knowing that Van Diemen's Land was congested with
convicts, and wishing to give the new system a trial under the most
favourable conditions, secured from the Government permission to land
about half of them at Port Phillip, a wealthy landowner of that
province having undertaken to find employment for them there. Whether
the majority of the people of the Port Phillip District wished to
receive convict labour of this class the Government had not taken the
trouble to ascertain. But they were not left long in doubt.</p>

<p>Melbourne, the centre of the Port Phillip District, had by this time
left far behind the rude beginnings of the Batman era, and had grown
into a vigorous and thriving town, with a Mayor and Corporation,
spreading suburbs, three newspapers, and a population rapidly rising to
the 10,000 level. The people of this town heard with indignation on
Monday, November 8, 1844, that on the previous Saturday the ship ROYAL
GEORGE from London had brought a consignment of prisoners. The <i>Port
Phillip Patriot</i> denounced the attempt to resume the transportation
system 'without its discipline, with all its evils and none of its
benefits.' 'We should,' wrote the furious editor at the conclusion of
his article, 'duck the scoundrels if they attempt to set foot in a
country of free men, and send them back as they came to the greater
scoundrels who dared to send them hither.'</p>

<p>There was a sharp division of opinion between the landowning
interests and the townspeople over the expediency of receiving these
conditional pardon men. A meeting of landowners decided to ask the
British Government to send more of them. 'Labour we must have,' said
one of the speakers, 'and if we don't get it from Pentonville we shall
have it from Van Diemen's Land.' But angry meetings were held on the
other side. The introduction to the province of 'expatriated villains,'
declared one of the resolutions passed by a public meeting over which
the Mayor of Melbourne presided, was 'an act of wanton injustice to
three-fourths of the entire population.' Nevertheless, the British
Government ignored the protests, and continued to send cargoes of
'Pentonvillains,' as the Port Phillip people called them, for five
years after 1844. Within that period 1,727 were received.</p>

<p>But the anti-transportation feeling was growing very strongly not
only in Melbourne, but also in Sydney. Van Diemen's Land added its cry
of protest. An Anti-transportation League formed in 1851 had active
adherents in all the colonies. The entire population of New South
Wales, including the Port Phillip District, was at the census of 1841
over 130,000. The number of the convict class at that date probably did
not exceed 25,000, Amongst the people as a whole, apart from those
whose business interests were involved in the continuation of the
supply of convict labour, the antipathy became intense. But the
landowners had more direct means of bringing their wishes under the
notice of the governing authorities in England than had the mass of the
population, and they made use of their opportunities.</p>

<p>It happened that the Colonial Secretary, during part of the time
when these troubles were disturbing both New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land (i.e. in 1846), was W. E. Gladstone--then, as Macaulay
said of him, 'the rising hope of the stern, unbending Tories.'
Gladstone was a partner in a Port Phillip sheep station, and he had
private as well as official sources of information concerning the
situation in both colonies. He thought that the grave condition of glut
in the one might be relieved, and the shortage of labour in the other
overcome, by diverting a few thousand convicts per annum from Van
Diemen's Land to New South Wales. He therefore requested the Governor
to consult his Legislative Council as to whether they would not accept
in part supply of the labour market the renewal of 'a modified and
carefully regulated introduction of convict labourers.'</p>

<p>In response to this invitation the Council appointed a committee,
which reported in favour of a given number of convicts per annum being
sent out, provided that such transportation be accompanied with an
equal importation of free immigrants as nearly as possible in equal
proportions as to sexes.' The Legislative Council rejected the report
of the committee, notwithstanding the condition, which would have
secured the dilution of the evil. But, despite the rejection of the
committee's report, Earl Grey, who became Secretary of State for the
Colonies in succession to Gladstone, determined to ignore the public
feeling of the colonists, and to resume the transportation system.</p>

<p>By the year 1848 it was admitted that the conditional pardon system
had not been a success. It had simply meant flooding the colonies with
shiploads of criminals, many of whom had shammed reformation in order
to secure freedom for the exercise of their proclivities in countries
where there were wider opportunities and fewer police than in England.
It had manufactured bushrangers and made highway robbery a flourishing
industry. Lord Grey therefore determined to abandon the issue of
conditional pardons, and to send out convicts with tickets of leave.
That meant that, instead of the convicts being at liberty to wander
where they pleased when landed in the chosen colony, they would have to
report themselves to the police at stated intervals.</p>

<p>But Lord Grey found, to his great surprise, that there was now a
vigorous public opinion which was determined to rebel rather than to
receive any more convicts. No Secretary of State was ever more taken
aback than was this respectable Whig peer at the reception of his new
policy.</p>

<p>On August 8, 1849, the ship <i>Randolph</i> entered Port Phillip
with convicts on board. But the citizens of Melbourne had been warned
from London that she was coming, and several excited meetings had been
held to organize resistance. The tone was stern and menacing. One
influential speaker declared, amidst great cheering, that 'he should be
one for resisting, even to the death, the landing of such cargoes.'
Edward Wilson, the editor of the ARGUS--which was established in
1846--wrote in his newspaper that a resort to force was 'warranted
alike by the laws of God and man,' and he urged a union of colonists
'to repel by physical force any other attempt to land convicts on our
shores.'</p>

<p>Latrobe, the Superintendent of Port Phillip, recognized that the
feeling of the population was dangerous, and he therefore directed the
captain of the <i>Randolph</i> to take the convicts round to Sydney. He
did the same when a second vessel with 'Pentonvillains' on board, the
<i>Hashemy</i>, arrived in May. Thus did the Melbourne people, by the
menace of rebellion, free their province from an infliction which they
loathed.</p>

<p>In Sydney the Governor, Sir Charles Fitzroy, found himself
confronted with an antipathy hardly less violent. The Legislative
Council had already passed a resolution protesting against New South
Wales being 'again made a place to which British offenders may be
transported,' and public meetings had expressed the same feeling. The
<i>Sydney</i> HERALD (founded 1831) had as far back as 1834 urged that
the convict system involved 'an abominable system of misrule and total
depravity,' and that only by its abolition could this country 'gain a
standing among the British colonies.' This journal had steadily worked
for the abolition of the system, and a strong body of public opinion
had been formed to support that policy. Fitzroy, perceiving that the
landing of the convicts from the <i>Randolph</i> and the HASHEMY would
probably lead to trouble, sent them on to Moreton Bay.</p>

<p>Lord Grey quite failed to understand the change that had come over
Australia after over half a century's experience of convictism. He
never realized the difference that was made by the free settlers far
out-numbering the malefactors. He could not appreciate that the time
had come when there was a large population whose native land was
Australia, and who nourished an affectionate care for its future
well-being. When he wrote his book on COLONIAL POLICY in 1853, he
advanced the proposition that England was 'perfectly justified in
continuing the practice of transportation to Australia, the colonies
being only entitled to ask that in the arrangements for conducting it
their interests and welfare should be consulted as far as possible.' He
had not moved from that vicious attitude of English statesmen towards
the colonies which was largely responsible for the American Revolution.
The colonies, in this view, existed primarily for the benefit of the
mother-country, and their own wishes and interests must be kept
subordinate. Lord Grey commented on the 'great advantage of not
allowing men who have been guilty of serious crimes to return to their
former homes,' and asked what the consequence to England would be if
several thousand men 'who under the existing system would be
permanently removed from the United Kingdom, are to be annually turned
loose on society.' That they had been turned loose on society in the
colonies, with deplorable results, did not trouble this unimaginative
Whig politician. The same view was expressed in a House of Commons
debate. 'The country had a right to look to our colonies to receive our
convicts without complaint,' babbled an indignant member.</p>

<p>These incidents of the revolt from convictism in the country which
had been colonized by the British for that very purpose, represented
the death-struggle of the system in New South Wales. It was continued
in Van Diemen's Land till 1853, and in Norfolk Island till 1855. The
connection of Western Australia with it has been related.</p>

<p>Under the Acts passed by the Imperial Parliament in 1823 and 1828,
the Governor of New South Wales And his Legislative Council made laws
for the whole of Australia, exclusive of South Australia, Western
Australia, and Tasmania. In South Australia, during Sir George Grey's
governorship (1842), a Council of seven members was set up consisting
of three officials and four nominees; and there was an understanding
that a more liberal form of government would be instituted as soon as
the population attained 50,000. Western Australia was from 1838 ruled
on the same plan, there being three official and four non official
members in the Council. When the administration of Van Diemen's Land
was separated from that of New South Wales in 1825, a similar Council
was appointed. These nominee Councils, though selected by the
Governors, were still fairly independent in their outlook. They were
usually composed of men of experience and force of character,
accustomed to speak their minds. The system served the purpose until
development and increase of population made a better one
imperative.</p>

<p>Strictly, the Governor of New South Wales was until 1855 the only
presiding official in Australia who was entitled to be styled Governor.
In each of the other provinces a Lieutenant-Governor was at the head of
the administration. The commission of Sir Charles Fitzroy (1846-55)
described that descendant of Charles II as 'Governor-General of all Her
Majesty's Australian possessions, including the colony of Western
Australia,' and the title was retained till 1861. Fitzroy and Denison
(1855-61) were the only Governors of New South Wales who held the
title; but it gave to them no superiority over the other Governors. The
title carried no real significance until, under Federation, the
Constitution provided for a Governor-General to preside over the
Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The next important step in the constitutional history of Australia
was the passing, in 1842, of the Act for the Government of New South
Wales and Van Diemen's, Land, which introduced the elective principle.
Very little interest was taken in this measure in the Imperial
Parliament at the time when the Colonial Secretary, Lord Stanley,
introduced it, and it was passed with scarcely any criticism. But it
did, in truth, inaugurate a new era. It placed in the hands of the
people a large share in the direction of the affairs of their country.
First, it increased the number of members of the Legislative Council to
thirty-six, of whom twelve were to be nominated as before, but
twenty-four were to be elected. Secondly, it gave this Council power to
increase its own membership, provided that the proportion of one-third
of nominee members to two-thirds elective was preserved. Thirdly, while
excluding convicts from the franchise, it conferred voting power upon
those who had served their sentences or who had conditional pardons.
Fourthly, it provided that the qualification for a vote was to consist
of the possession of freehold property to a value of 200 pounds, or the
occupation of a dwelling-house worth at least 20 pounds a year.
Fifthly, it prescribed that members of the Council must own freehold
property to the value of 2,000 pounds, or worth 100 pounds a year.
Sixthly, it recognised that the Port Phillip District had separate
interests of its own, by laying down that that province should return
at least five members to the Council, and the town of Melbourne at
least one.</p>

<p>This guarantee of a proportion of representation to the Port Phillip
District was a concession to a feeling already clearly expressed in
that province, in favour of separation from New South Wales. As early
as 1840, when the entire population of the district had not attained
10,000, a petition in favour of independence had been extensively
signed, and a Separation Association had been formed. The British
Government was well aware of this movement, but considered that the
discontents of the Port Phillip people would probably be appeased by
securing for them what seemed to be an adequate share of
representation. The Act defined the area included within the district
to be 'a straight line drawn from Cape Howe to the western source of
the river Murray, and thence the course of that river to the eastern
boundary of the province of South Australia.' In this definition the
boundary differed from that prescribed in the Land Regulations
promulgated in 1840, which had divided New South Wales into three
districts, Northern, Middle, and Southern. The Southern, Port Phillip,
District, was then defined as extending 'by the rivers Murrumbidgee and
Murray to the eastern boundary of South Australia'; and Lord John
Russell, the Colonial Secretary, had by a despatch dated May 31, 1840,
laid it down that the Murrumbidgee should be the northern boundary of
Port Phillip. But the Legislative Council of New South Wales protested
against the extensive district lying between the Murray and the
Murrumbidgee, generally known as Riverina, being included; and that
protest was regarded when the boundary was defined by the Act of
1842.</p>

<p>Some dissatisfaction was in more recent years expressed concerning
the river boundary, and an endeavour was made to show that that mistake
was committed when the Murray, and not the Murrumbidgee, was marked as
the northern limit of Victoria. At one time legal proceedings to test
the point were threatened. But skilled opinion did not encourage a
contest, and the claim was dropped.</p>

<p>A case did arise over the western boundary of the same colony. The
141st meridian of east longitude was declared to be the boundary
between Victoria and South Australia, but the means of determining
longitude were imperfect when the line was drawn in 1836, with the
result that Victoria took 340,000 acres more than she was entitled to
get. South Australia claimed the recovery of this long, narrow strip of
territory, and brought an action, which was determined by the Privy
Council in 1914. It was then decided that the boundary fixed in 1836,
though an error was undoubtedly made by the surveyors, was intended to
be final, and should not be disturbed</p>

<p>The Port Phillip people were not content with their position under
the 1842 constitution. Few residents in the district were willing to
accept nomination to the Council, and three of the selected
representatives were Sydney men, including the vituperative Rev. Dr.
Lang, who threw himself with explosive energy into the separation
movement. Robert Lowe also voiced the opinion that the separationists
had reason on their side. One of the principal grievances was that the
revenue collected from the province was very much greater than the
expenditure upon it, the balance being spent on the Sydney side of the
river Murray. Between the first settlement of Port Phillip and the year
1842 it was claimed that this balance had totalled over 150,000 pounds;
and Lang talked about a 'semi-felonious abstraction of the Port Phillip
revenues for the maintenance of an unnecessarily extravagant system of
government.'</p>

<p>The dissatisfaction expressed itself in 1848 in a refusal to
nominate members to represent the Port Phillip District, and in the
farcical election of the Colonial Secretary, Earl Grey, for Melbourne.
The electors desired to express in this way their belief that they
would be quite as effectively represented in the Legislative Council by
a peer, whom they knew would never take his seat, as by any local man
whom they could choose. Oddly enough, the election was declared valid
by the law officers, and Lord Grey was the member for Melbourne for the
two years 1848-50.</p>

<p>These and other happenings convinced the British Government that the
time was ripe for placing the Governments operating in Australia on an
entirely new representative basis. The whole process of change, to be
understood in its historical relations, must be considered in
connection with the Parliamentary Reform movement in England, the
Chartist movement, the general liberalizing tendencies of the times,
and the altered attitude of the Imperial Government towards colonies
and dependencies. Lord Durham had produced (1839) his highly important
Report on the state of Canada, with the consequence that complete self
government had been instituted in British North America. He laid down
the principle that the only satisfactory way for the mother country to
manage large colonies was to throw upon them the responsibility of
governing themselves.</p>

<p>Tories and Whigs alike could not at first understand how
self-government could possibly be allowed if the colonies were to
remain British. Even Lord John Russell, though a member of the
Government which carried the Reform Bill of 1832, quailed before
conceding liberal institutions to Britons who emigrated to British
colonies. If the Government of a colony were to be controlled by a
popular assembly, he said in 1839, 'he could not conceive what was to
become of the orders of the Imperial Government and the Colonial
Governor.' Lord North might have said the same sort of thing in the
reign of George III. The idea did not occur to Lord John that no great
harm would accrue if the Imperial Government and the Colonial Governors
did no longer give orders; that the giving of such orders was not
necessarily the expression of perfect wisdom; and that, indeed, the
colonies would be better without them. But the self-governing principle
was soon seen to be the inevitable one to adopt; and in 1850 it was
Lord John Russell's Government that applied it to Australia.</p>

<p>The measure which inaugurated the new era was the Australian
Colonies Government Act, passed in August 1850--a statute of the utmost
importance. In its first section it erected Port Phillip into a
separate colony, 'to be known and designated as the colony of
Victoria.' This province was not the first portion of the British
Empire to take the name of the Queen who reigned over sixty years. Two
years before her accession, a number of South African settlers at
Durban petitioned the British Government to annex the surrounding
territory, 'which we have named Victoria, in honour of our august
princess.' But the request was refused; and when a colony was at length
recognized there, eight years later, the name Victoria had been taken
by the Australian colony and the South Africans adopted the name
Natal.</p>

<p>The suggestion that the Port Phillip District should be named after
the Queen was made by the Committee of Trade and Plantations. In a
report of 1849, the committee pointed out that Her Majesty's royal
ancestors had permitted the use of their names to designate provinces
in the North American continent, and, 'venturing to presume that it
will be your Majesty's pleasure to follow those precedents,' they
'humbly advised' the Queen to confer the name of Victoria on this part
of Australia.</p>

<p>The Act conferred upon Victoria a Legislative Council, two-thirds
elective; and it set up similar Councils in Western Australia, South
Australia, and Tasmania. But more important than what the Act actually
did was what it gave the colonies power to do for themselves. By the
32nd section it enabled them to constitute legislatures, to fix the
franchise to suit their own wishes, to alter their constitutions, and,
in short, to clothe themselves with just such constitutional garments
as would fit them best. After the passing of the Act of 1850,
therefore, five Australian colonies were under the rule of partly
elective Legislative Councils, with free scope to modify their form of
government from time to time.</p>

<p>This was an entirely new departure in the relations of Great Britain
and Australia. Hitherto the Imperial Parliament had reserved to itself
the right to amend any Act passed by it affecting the government of
these colonies. Now that power was surrendered in regard to the basic
laws under which the colonies would be governed, their constitutions;
subject only to the reservation that amendments of these instruments
must be reserved for royal confirmation.</p>

<p>The Act also gave to the colonies economic freedom. They could,
under section 27, impose any customs duties on imported goods, whether
those goods were the manufactures of Great Britain, or of other British
colonies, or of foreign countries.</p>

<p>It is very curious, and suggestive of reflections on the limitations
of human sagacity, that none of the very eminent statesmen who
discussed the 1850 constitution in the House of Commons and the House
of Lords, and none who wrote and spoke about constitutional development
in the colonies, had any clear perception of the manner in which it
would work out. Both Gladstone in England and Wentworth in Australia
were at that time distrustful of democratic tendencies and wished to
provide against them. Gladstone in the House of Commons stated that he
'wished to check democracy in New South Wales, but he wished to see it
checked by stable institutions springing from the soil rather than by
influences from the Crown and enactments from Downing Street.'
Wentworth, in a report which he drafted in Sydney, protested that he
and those who supported him had 'no wish to sow the seeds of a future
democracy.' A few peers perceived that the key to the future lay in the
32nd section. The giving of power to reform the constitution would,
said these scared legislators, lead to making the country so governed
'a mere democracy.' But this group commanded less attention than did
others who were interested in the position of the Church of England in
Australia, in Lord Grey's provisions for a federal form of government,
in the question whether it was expedient to provide for one house of
legislature or two, and in other aspects of lesser importance.</p>

<p>Wentworth favoured the creation of an hereditary class, carrying the
titles of baronets, from whom should be selected an upper house of
legislature. 'Why,' he asked, 'if titles are open to all at home,
should they be denied to the colonists? Why should such an institution
as the House of Lords, which is an integral part of the British
constitution, be shut out from us?' But his idea found no support
either in Australia or in Great Britain. The 'bunyip aristocracy' was,
indeed, scouted in Sydney with an explosion of ridicule and indignation
which induced Wentworth to drop it; and it is interesting to note that
one of the most vigorous opponents of the hereditary baronets
proposition was young Henry Parkes--hereafter to become the most
commanding figure in the politics of the colony.</p>

<p>Since 1850 the Australian people have worked out their own problems
of government. The date when this era commenced and the highly
important changes which occurred in the life of Australia a little
later are closely connected. The gold discoveries of the fifties
brought to the shores of this country an immense tide of immigration;
and a large proportion of the immigrants were men whose minds had been
influenced by the recent reform and revolutionary movements in Europe,
or had actually participated in them. Gold drew English Chartists and
Irish repealers, participants in the French, German, Belgian, and
Hungarian revolutionary upheavals of 1848, Polish and Spanish
insurrectionists, Italian nationalists, a great and mixed crowd of
political enthusiasts, dauntless champions of lost causes, visionary
idealists and fervent exponents of utopian theories--drew them all as
the moon draws the waters--and set them to scratch for shimmering
fortunes upon the beds of the creeks of Bathurst, amongst the quartz
veins of Ballarat, and the auriferous gravels of Bendigo. To a people
thus augmented was entrusted the responsibility of working systems of
government in accordance with popular wishes.</p>

<p>The colonies very soon applied themselves to bringing about complete
responsible government. New South Wales was the pioneer under the
leadership of Wentworth. Throughout his life he had striven for the
establishment of free representative institutions, and now he was to
see many of his hopes realized.</p>

<p>The Act of 1842 had not given to New South Wales, as the Act of 1850
had given to the other colonies, power to remodel the constitution, but
the Colonial Secretary, in response to a remonstrance drawn up by the
Legislative Council (a strongly worded document, which denounced the
'systematic and mischievous interference' of an 'inexperienced, remote,
and irresponsible Department,' the Colonial office) had invited the
Council to draw up a new constitution and submit it to the Imperial
Government. In response to this invitation a committee was appointed in
June 1852, with Wentworth as chairman, to prepare a constitution; and
this committee drew up the scheme upon which the New South Wales
constitution was based.</p>

<p>It was as far as possible a copy of the British constitution and it
was with the object of making it a still closer copy that Wentworth
suggested the establishment of an hereditary House. 'The model, the
type, from which this great charter has been drawn,' he said in an
eloquent speech, 'is, in the language of Canning, the envy of
surrounding nations and the admiration of the world.' It was the task
of the builders of this instrument of government to reduce to precise
terms the system which, as operating in Great Britain, was not
contained in any single document, but was a pile of precedents and a
tally of practices, described in text-books and scattered over
innumerable records.</p>

<p>Two houses of legislature were established--a Legislative Council
consisting of members nominated by the Crown (that is, by the Governor
of the Colony acting on the advice of his ministers) and holding their
seats for life; and a Legislative Assembly elected by the votes of
people possessed of freehold property worth 100 pounds, or who occupied
a house for which they paid not less than 10 pounds per annum in rent,
or who paid not less than 40 pounds a year for board and lodging.
Parliaments were to last not more than five years. The executive
government was entrusted to a Cabinet, the head of which usually bore
the title of Premier and Colonial Secretary.</p>

<p>The Legislative Council of New South Wales was reformed in 1934. The
nominated House then ceased to exist, and a new Council was instituted,
consisting of sixty members, one-third of whom retire annually. The
members are not elected directly by the people, but by a constituency
consisting of the whole of the members of the Council and the Assembly.
The term for which a member of the Council is elected is twelve years.
This new system was approved by a majority of the people of New South
Wales, at a referendum in May 1933.</p>

<p>The Act of 1855, which embodied the new constitution for New South
Wales, did not contain any clause expressly providing for 'responsible
government,' but the Legislative Council of the colony, in sending the
measure to London to be passed as an Act of the Imperial Parliament,
accompanied it by a series of resolutions, which described the
principles upon which it was desired that the constitution should be
worked. One of these resolutions laid it down that the Ministers
composing the Executive, or Cabinet, should possess the confidence of
Parliament, and should be dismissed from office whenever Parliament
signified that it had lost confidence in them. This was the essence of
'responsible government.' Another of the resolutions expressed the
desire that the Parliament of New South Wales should 'form as close an
approximation as possible to the constitution of both Houses of the
Imperial Parliament.' Thus it was intended that the practice of the
Imperial Parliament in regard to the responsibility of the Government
to the elected house of Parliament should be adopted in New South
Wales. The first Premier and Colonial Secretary under responsible
government was Stuart Alexander Donaldson, whose government took office
in June 1856.</p>

<p>Victoria in 1853 was invited by the Secretary of State for the
Colonies to prepare a constitution which would confer responsible
government. A committee appointed in September 1853 was able to make
use of the work which had been done by Wentworth's committee in New
South Wales. Their draftsman was William Stawell, afterwards Chief
Justice of the colony, and their measure provided for a governing
system on lines similar to those followed in the older colony, except
that Victoria preferred an elective rather than a nominee Legislative
Council. The members of that house were to be elected for ten years,
and must possess property to the value of 5,000 pounds, or returning an
income of at least 500 pounds a year. The electors had to be persons
possessed of freehold property to the value of 1,000 pounds, or 100
pounds a year; but the Council franchise was also conferred upon
graduates of universities, ministers of religion, lawyers, doctors, and
naval and military officers regardless of the amount of their property.
The new Victorian constitution came into force in 1856. The first
Premier under responsible government was William Clark Haines.</p>

<p>South Australia prepared a scheme of responsible government in 1853,
and it was brought into operation in 1857. It granted life tenures to
the members of an existing nominee Legislative Council, but took power
to make that house elective at the end of ten years if the House of
Assembly passed a bill for that purpose. The head of the first ministry
under responsible government was Boyle Travers Finnis. Tasmania also
attained responsible government in 1856, with Colonel W. T. N. Champ as
Premier. The development of Western Australia in the same salutary
direction was clogged by her wilful adherence to the convict system,
and she was the last State in Australia to place herself on an equality
with the sister States. When the Imperial Government was first
approached with a view to securing responsible government for Western
Australia, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Derby (1883),
was of opinion that the northern part of the colony 'would be likely to
form a separate colony at an early date,' and was not inclined to place
so large an extent of territory under the government of a Parliament
meeting at Perth. A nominee Legislative Council had been established in
1830, and in 1870 this Council had been enlarged by admitting twelve
elected members, in addition to six nominated members. But public
opinion had ripened in the intervening years, though there was a large
section of the inhabitants who were averse from a change to responsible
government. Fuller discussion, however, brought the majority to the
view that Western Australia should come into line with the other
Australian States, and that it should 'remain one and undivided.' A
Constitution Bill was prepared by the Council in 1889, was passed by
the Imperial Parliament in 1890, and came into operation in the same
year. John Forrest was the first Premier, and he continued to hold the
office until he entered the Federal Parliament in 1901.</p>

<p>From the first discovery of gold down to 1939, Australia contributed
nearly 715,000,000 pounds to the world's stock of this metal. The
history of gold-mining presents three broadly marked phases. First,
there were the occasional discoveries of fragments, and the more or
less confident predictions that rich deposits would be found. Secondly,
there were the exciting years of the gold 'rushes,' when the diggers
flocked from the ends of the earth to pick up fortunes in yellow lumps
or to wash it out of the gravel of streams. Thirdly, as the surface
alluvial deposits became exhausted, there was the period when gold
mining became an organized industry, to which science and capital were
applied, liable to be flushed with unexpected successes or depressed by
sudden collapses--speculative, spasmodic, perhaps incalculable, but a
regular industry nevertheless.</p>

<p>In 1839 the Polish Count, Paul Strzelecki, during a scientific
exploring expedition from Sydney across the mountains of the south-east
and into the region of Victoria which he called Gippsland, observed
particles of gold amongst decomposed ironstone. Sir Roderick Murchison,
when he examined Strzelecki's maps and rock specimens in England,
pointed out the resemblances between the geological formation and that
of the gold-bearing rocks of the Ural Mountains. He wrote to the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Grey, stating his conclusions
and the reasons for them; but no notice was taken of his letter.
Several persons in New South Wales occasionally found small specimens
of gold. As early as 1823 McBrian, a surveyor, picked up some specks
while at work near the Fish River. A Sydney geologist, W. B. Clarke,
from observations made in the Bathurst neighbourhood, heralded the
approach of important discoveries, and showed a sample to Sir George
Gipps. But the Governor did not view the discoveries with pleasure.
Gipps, who dreaded the unrest which the lure of gold would cause among
his horde of convicts, said to the geologist, 'Put it away, Mr. Clarke,
or we shall all have our throats cut.' He requested Strzelecki to say
nothing about his inferences, lest the convict population and labourers
should become restless and go prospecting. The Count, for this reason,
refrained from alluding to the subject in his book on Australia. When,
in 1848, a piece of gold found near Berrima was shown to the Government
in Sydney, they would not order a geological survey for fear of
'agitating the public mind.'</p>

<p>But the discovery of various nuggets and fragments continued, not
only in New South Wales but in Victoria. In 1847 a Port Phillip
shepherd found gold at the roots of a tree which the wind had blown
down. In the two following years Melbourne goldsmiths purchased several
specimens found in a similarly chance fashion. In 1849 a shepherd named
Chapman, who was looking after his master's sheep at Mount Buninyong,
near Ballarat, brought in twenty-two ounces of fine gold, and
guaranteed to show a gully in the ranges where more would be found. A
gold assayer accompanied him to the spot, and brought back twenty-four
ounces. A labourer in Gippsland, in digging a hole for a fencing-post,
struck a nugget with his spade, and his good luck made him the richer
by a hundred sovereigns. Similar incidents became so frequent as to
make men feel that they were on the eve of surprising changes.</p>

<p>The period of systematic search did not begin till after 1850.
Edward Hargreaves, who had had a sheep station on the Bathurst Plains,
was attracted to the gold diggings of California in 1849. He roughed it
there among the variegated society of Poker Flat and the Roaring Camp,
and he noticed that the diggings which yielded the richest returns were
in country very closely resembling Bathurst. He knew of the traces of
gold which had been found there; so he hurried back to Australia and
commenced to search. In May 1851 the Lands Commissioner wrote in alarm
from Bathurst to Sydney that 'a Mr. Hargreaves' had been employing
people to dig for gold on Summerhill Creek. They had found several
ounces, and he considered that 'some stringent measures should be
adopted to prevent the labouring classes from leaving their employment
to search on the crown lands.' Sheep, to the Commissioner, were more
important than gold; and so, indeed, the Government were inclined to
think. But Hargreaves had been in communication with Governor Fitzroy,
seeking a reward if he pointed out where gold would certainly be found.
He did in the end receive a grant of 10,000 pounds, and was presented
to Queen Victoria as the celebrated gold discoverer. But in fact
Clarke's intimations were earlier and based upon a foundation of
reasoned knowledge.</p>

<p>As soon as the news of the Bathurst discoveries reached Melbourne
the importance of the previous occasional findings of gold was
realized. Here there were no misgivings. Victoria had been passing
through a period of commercial depression. People were drifting away
from the country. Prosperity was waning. Nothing could have been more
opportune than the stimulus of rich gold discoveries at this juncture.
A committee of wealthy citizens at once offered liberal rewards for
discoveries, and claimants were quick in coming forward. Gold was found
in the Plenty Ranges, quite near to Melbourne. Prospectors on the upper
Yarra brought back gravel sparkling with golden grains. Farther away,
at Clunes, a coach-driver looking round in his spare time discovered
valuable deposits. Pockets containing nuggets often weighing many
ounces of pure gold were revealed at Mount Alexander. In August 1851
the beginnings of the fabulous richness of Ballarat were disclosed by
Thomas Hiscock; and in November Henry Frenchman in Golden Gully,
Bendigo, tapped the first draught of the great yellow stream that was
to flow from that amazing field. Before the end of 1851, 249,000 ounces
had been taken from the soil of Victoria, worth nearly 900,000
pounds.</p>

<p>Wonderful finds were made by individuals. An aboriginal employed by
Dr. Kerr, in the Bathurst district, cracked a block of quartz with his
tomahawk and told his master that there was gold inside it. A
hundredweight of pure gold was at once taken from the spot, including
one solid lump weighing sixty pounds. A digger at Golden Point,
Ballarat, sank a hole five feet deep, and at the bottom found that 'the
gold was so thickly sprinkled that it looked like a jeweller's shop.'
Another Ballarat digger took 1,800 pounds (Value) out of one hole in
one day's easy work. A Bendigo miner obtained 3,000 pounds (value) in
six weeks. A party of eight mates, after taking 12,800 pounds (value)
from a Ballarat claim, sold it to a party of ten, who obtained from it
10,000 pounds (value) between Saturday morning and Monday evening. Then
they sold the right of working the mine for one week to a party of
twelve, who scooped out 14,400 pounds (value); after which the ten
proprietors resumed possession, made 9,000 pounds (value) in the next
week, and sold out to a party who won 5,000 pounds (value) within the
following fortnight. The Welcome nugget weighed 2,217 ounces, the
Welcome Stranger 2,280. Lesser nuggets seemed to be nearly as profuse
as pebbles on a beach. When Latrobe, the Lieutenant-Governor, paid a
visit of Inspection to Ballarat, a miner offered him a piece of pure
gold as a souvenir, and when he protested it was too much to take, the
man simply answered that there were plenty more where that came from.
It is true that the rich 'finds' were the good fortune of comparatively
few among the many thousands who crowded the auriferous areas, but the
others were always buoyed up with hope.</p>

<p>Naturally the news which flew round the globe emphasized the
richness of the discoveries and created the impression that
inexhaustible wealth lay scattered over these Australian gold-fields
waiting to be picked up. The stories which the newspapers in all
languages had to tell were not exaggerations, and could hardly have
been so, because the things which occurred were far more wonderful than
any that could be imagined. From the fiords of Norway to the villages
of China ran the golden tidings. Ibsen, writing his poetical play,
LOVE'S COMEDY, in Christiania, figured 'a Ballarat beyond the desert
sands' as an end worth leaping for. From Canton and Belgravia alike
came the seekers. Thousands of Chinese poured in, packed in ships like
cattle, so that already men began to say that the proximity of empty
Australia to crowded Asia presented a grave problem which would have to
be guarded against. Bathurst, Bendigo, and Ballarat homed the most
mixed assembly of humanity on earth. In the first year there were more
foreigners than people of British blood among the procession of
immigrants who thronged the roads from the wharves, where the ships
dropped them, to the diggings where they all hoped to become immensely
rich within an extremely short period. Before 1855 there were as many
residents in Victoria alone as there were in all Australia previously
to the gold discoveries.</p>

<p>The Government claimed that gold found 'in its natural place of
deposit' belonged to the Crown, but granted licence to diggers. In New
South Wales the fee fixed in May 1851 was 30s. per month, and in
Victoria the same rate was proclaimed in August. Gold-fields
Commissioners were appointed to issue licences and prevent digging by
those who had not paid the fees. In 1852 the Imperial Government
notified that the revenue derived from this source was to be used to
defray the cost of local administration. The Legislative Councils of
both New South Wales and Victoria, being composed principally of
landowners, many of whom regarded the gold-fields as unblessed things
because they attracted labour from the sheep-runs and farms, were
resolved to make the miners pay for the privilege of gold-getting. Some
of the squatters, alarmed for the welfare of their flocks, advocated
that gold digging should be peremptorily prohibited 'in order that the
industrial pursuits of the country should not be interfered with.' Such
a policy would have been manifestly absurd; but it was considered that
at least the Government should benefit from the finds made by the
miners. Besides, the gold-fields entailed much additional expenditure.
More roads, more wharves, more officials, more police, were required.
Should not these be paid for out of the proceeds of the mines? The
squatters and rulers certainly thought so.</p>

<p>The operation of the licence system, however, was so inequitable
that it was bound to cause dissatisfaction. It extracted 30s. per month
alike from the miner who had a rich claim and from him who toiled all
day and got nothing. After the first flush of easily won opulence,
nuggets were no longer as plentiful as coconuts on a tropic isle, and
in the lottery of gold-fields life, while many still drew prizes, there
were also plenty of blanks. In New South Wales there was a riot on the
Turon diggings, in protest against the exaction; but there the number
of miners was not very large, they were tactfully handled, and the
trouble was soon at an end.</p>

<p>But in Victoria there were more serious disturbances. The
gold-fields population there comprised a number of foreign
diggers--continental revolutionaries who had been in the habit of
nourishing grievances and defying authority. Sir Charles Hotham
attributed the disturbances chiefly to 'active, designing, intriguing
foreigners whose aim is disorder and confusion'; and if he exaggerated
this influence, it certainly was present. Moreover, the principal
Victorian gold-fields were contained within a fairly compact area.
Bendigo, Castlemaine, Creswick, Ballarat, Maryborough, and a cluster of
other mining centres were not far apart; and there was always amongst
the miners that feeling of mateship which made the troubles of some the
concern of the entire community. But, above all, the police, who
collected the fees, carried out their duties arrogantly and caused much
exasperation. Undoubtedly many diggers who could afford the fee evaded
payment, and it was no easy task to collect money from them. There were
so many opportunities of hiding when the troopers came upon the scene:
in the scrub, down a shaft, among the tents. Tradespeople, who did
business principally with the miners, were disposed to be on their side
against the police. The revenue was always very far short of the amount
that should have been received from the number of diggers on the
various fields; and the Victorian Government was in urgent need of all
the money it could collect. The police, frequently baffled and
constantly urged to be more vigilant, became at enmity with the mining
population, and a tension of feeling dangerous to the public peace was
the consequence.</p>

<p>Latrobe admitted that the licence system was inequitable, and
favoured the imposition of an export duty on gold as a better means of
enabling the Government to obtain a reasonable portion of the product
of the mines. But his Legislative Council rejected that plan, and
proposed to reduce the fee. An Act passed in 1853 did diminish it to a
minimum of 1 pound per month, or 8 pounds per annum. But the police
still continued to act as collectors. They probed and hunted and
hustled amid scowls and curses and threats; and amongst the miners
avoidance of payment was elevated into a virtue.</p>

<p>The ill-feeling blazed into open rioting and rebellion at Ballarat
in October, November, and December 1854, and culminated in the incident
of the Eureka Stockade. In October a mob had burnt down a disreputable
drinking shanty known as the Eureka Hotel, kept by one Bentley, who had
been a Van Diemen's Land convict. A digger had been murdered in a
scuffle at the door of the hotel, and Bentley was believed to have
committed the crime. But he was a friend of the magistrate, and was
acquitted. The diggers, nearly 10,000 strong, held an indignation
meeting, which the police endeavoured to disperse. The infuriated crowd
overwhelmed them, rushed at the hotel, and burnt it down. Later Bentley
was re-arrested, and, with three accomplices, convicted of
manslaughter, whilst the magistrate who had previously acquitted him
was dismissed from office.</p>

<p>So far the quarrel between the diggers and the authorities was
little better than a vulgar squabble involving a tragedy. But out of
the passions aroused by it arose a movement which had in it a tinge of
political idealism. An Association called the Ballarat Reform League
was organized, which, in addition to championing the cause of the
diggers in reference to the licence fee and the intimidating conduct of
the police, put forward a programme demanding parliamentary
representation on the basis of manhood suffrage, the payment of members
of Parliament, the abolition of the property qualification for members
of Parliament, and the settlement of disputes between the miners and
the authorities by arbitrators chosen from each side. The programme of
the League was, in short, substantially that of English Chartism
adapted to local circumstances.</p>

<p>Hundreds of licences were publicly burnt, and the League pledged its
members to support those who refused to pay the obnoxious fees. Several
exciting incidents occurred before the climax at the Eureka Stockade
was reached. The Governor (Hotham) considered it to be necessary to
send up troops, and on the appearance of a detachment of the 40th
regiment on November 28, two diggers approached the officer in command,
Captain Wise, and asked him whether it was true that the wagons which
he had with him contained guns. Wise replied contemptuously that he had
no information to give to a parcel of rebels. Thereupon the crowd of
angry men hurled themselves upon the military convoy, overpowered the
soldiers, captured one wagon, overturned another, and scattered the
troops in flight to the military camp. The mounted police dashed forth
to disperse the crowd and rescue the wagons, the contents of which,
consisting partly of ammunition, had by this time been destroyed or
distributed among the rioters. The troopers rode slashing with their
swords among the people, and many were wounded.</p>

<p>It was now evident that the Government would have to take stern
measures, and the miners had to make up their minds to defend
themselves or tamely submit. In the excited condition of Ballarat there
was no doubt about the decision. They elected as their leader Peter
Lalor, a tall Irishman with some facility of speech and command over
men. Under his direction an acre of land on an area known as the Eureka
Lead was fenced off as a drill ground, and hastily fortified with
earth, rock, and logs. A lanky German named Vern superintended the
construction of this fortress, which, like himself, was not so
formidable as it looked. Meanwhile the military had been reinforced,
and the officer in command, Captain Thomas, was fully informed as to
what was happening. He determined to make an early morning attack on
the stockade. Lalor and his four lieutenants, two of them foreigners,
had proclaimed 'the Republic of Victoria,' and hoisted a blue flag with
the southern cross in white stars upon it as the symbol of their
revolution.</p>

<p>At four o'clock on the morning of Sunday, December 3, Captain
Thomas, at the head of his little force of 276 soldiers and police--of
whom only 182 were trained troops--attacked the Eureka Stockade. The
assault was quite unexpected. But the alarm was given, and the redcoats
were met with a volley which killed Captain Wise, the second in
command, and a couple of privates. Two volleys from the troops swept
the log parapet of the stockade, and then Thomas gave the order to
charge. In a few seconds the troops were over the top and in among the
defenders. For about a quarter of an hour there was a brisk
hand-to-hand fight, but in twenty-five minutes the struggle was over,
the flag was down, Vern had fled, Peter Lalor was lying unconscious
with a shattered arm, and the Eureka Stockade was in the hands of the
Queen's forces. Four soldiers and an officer were killed, and a dozen
men were wounded; whilst probably thirty of the rebels lost their
lives. The soldiers fought chivalrously, but the police, animated by
revenge, got out of hand and were censured by the coroner's jury for
'brutal conduct in firing at and cutting down unarmed and innocent
persons of both sexes at a distance from the scene of disturbance.'</p>

<p>Amongst Australian miners the Eureka Stockade incident has always
been regarded as in some sense a 'fight for freedom,' and the fact that
a liberalizing of the governing institutions occurred afterwards was
connected with the event itself. But the rebellious features were
contrary to the saner judgment of the miners, especially of those of
British origin. How much of it was really due to foreigners who had no
respect for British methods of securing reforms, it is difficult to
determine. The influence of the foreign element has been questioned,
and Hotham's assertion that the mass of the miners were urged on by
non-British agitators has been attributed to his anxiety to find an
excuse for the mishandling of the situation by the Government. But Vern
was a German; so was Thonen, another ringleader who was killed; and
Raffaelo, who was arrested and brought to trial, was a red-headed
Italian who seemed to hate all authority because he had been brought up
to hate the Austrians.</p>

<p>There was much more wild talk before Victoria settled down to
ordinary ways of life, but the bottom was knocked out of the rebellion
at Eureka. Thirteen insurgents were selected for prosecution. The first
two cases tried resulted in acquittals in circumstances contemptible
for the Crown case, and the Government would have been wise not to face
a judge and jury with the remainder. They persisted, however, and again
were defeated. Lalor, who lost his right arm, evaded the police, and
was never prosecuted. Nor was Vern, who ought to have been. But two
unhappy spectators in court whose enthusiasm exploded in cheers when
the jury brought in a verdict of not guilty were sent to jail for a
week by the Chief Justice, A'Beckett, for contempt of court. A
Commission appointed to inquire into the gold-fields grievances
recommended the abolition of the licence fee and the issue to diggers
of a Miner's Right, for which 1 pound per annum should be paid, and
which should be the miner's title-deed to his claim and to the gold
derived from it.</p>

<p>The wild freedom and lavish gains of the digging days were rapidly
passing during the occurrence of these vehement events. The
first-comers scraped off the golden crust of that rich auriferous area
which centred around Ballarat and Bendigo; and here, as also on the
Bathurst Plains, in the Plenty Ranges and elsewhere, gold-mining passed
from the alluvial into the organized industrial stage. Rarer and rarer
became the instances where small groups of mates, 'kept going' by a
trustful store-keeper till they 'struck it,' worked at their own little
claim beside a creek. The tin dish wherein the red-shirted digger
washed the gold out of the gravel vanished from the picture; the
poppet-heads of the big mines rose, and the stampers of powerful
batteries pounded gold-bearing rock brought up from a depth which (as
at the Victoria Quartz shaft at Bendigo) might reach down to 4,600
feet. Companies, many of whose shareholders had never seen a mine,
found (and often lost) the capital for exploiting good mining 'shows,'
and the miner worked for wages, or wandered afar 'prospecting' for new
reefs. There have been many 'rushes' since, but none like those of the
fifties. But all around Castlemaine and many another old goldfield may
be seen innumerable holes in the earth, like gaping graves, dug by the
picks and shovels of the miners of the days of the rushes, holes which
once yielded the reward of eager hopes or swallowed up fruitless
energies.</p>

<p>In all the Australian States gold has been found. Queensland
provided some sensational yields after the discovery of the metal by
the prospector Nash at Gympie in 1867. A single thousand-ounce nugget
was one of the choice products of that field. The most remarkable mine
was Mount Morgan. Situated on a hill-top, bought by the three Morgan
brothers in 1882 for 1 pound per acre from a selector who had no idea
of what was below the surface it was found to contain crumbling
ironstone wherein lay gold of unexampled purity to the quantity of
thirty or forty ounces per ton. It paid 1,000,000 pounds in dividends
in a single year, and in about a quarter of a century gold to the value
of about 14,000,000 pounds was taken out of this very wonderful square
mile of ground.</p>

<p>The historical importance of the discovery of the Western Australian
gold-fields between 1882 and 1900 was very great. From the foundation
of colonization in the west, in the circumstances described in Chapter
XII, it had been an agricultural community, cut off from the other
Australian colonies by thousands of leagues of sea and sand. It was an
English settlement, but perhaps less of an Australian colony than any
other within the group. But the gold discoveries brought in crowds of
miners and speculators, especially from Victoria, who changed the
social and political complexion of the country. The Kimberley, Pilbara
and Yilgarn gold-fields occasioned 'rushes' during 1886-8, though the
results were not sensational. It was not until Messrs. Bayley and Ford
struck a rock at Coolgardie with a tomahawk one Sunday afternoon in
August 1892, and obtained five hundred ounces, that the world turned
with astonishment to what it had regarded as desert country, and
entered upon the exploitation of the 'Golden Mile' of Boulder. The city
of Kalgoorlie sprang up with magical swiftness, and miners flocked to
the west from every part of Australia. Between 1892 and 1900 Western
Australia produced gold to the value of 22,200,000 pounds.</p>

<p>The old-settled landowning oligarchy viewed the inrush of the mining
population with scarcely concealed suspicion and dislike. They resisted
the conferring of political rights upon the miners, whom they spoke of
as 't'other siders,' and, in order to keep the power in their own
hands, maintained a system whereby fifty-seven votes in one pastoral
district (Ashburton) had the same representation as 1,500 votes in East
Coolgardie. The great political value of the new mining influence was
that it compelled Western Australia to enter the federation movement.
The miners, bred in the eastern States, and having political affinities
with them, were federalists to a man, and their insistence, more than
any other factor, carried Western Australia into the federal union in
1900.</p>

<p>Australia is rich in many kinds of minerals and in some its produce
has been phenomenal. The Burra copper mine, in South Australia,
discovered in 1845, yielded to the company which bought it for 10,000
pounds a profit of over 400,000 pounds in six years, and of over
800,000 pounds in twenty years. The discovery in 1883 that Broken
Hill--a 'considerable protuberance,' as Dr. Johnson might have called
it, in the far west of New South Wales--was a vast heap of silver
converted a little group of shepherds and miners who composed the
original syndicate of owners into millionaires, and from first to last
has yielded metal--silver, lead and zinc--to the value of more than
175,000,000 pounds. The west coast of Tasmania has given out great
wealth in tin, copper, silver and lead; whilst Cobar (New South Wales),
Mount Lyell (Tasmania) and Queensland have produced fortunes in copper.
And all these riches have been found in a country which the Dutch did
not think it worthwhile to examine when it might have been theirs for
the taking, and which was a no-man's-land to Europeans for nearly two
centuries after its existence had become known to them.</p>

<p>The inland exploration of Australia so far described has chiefly
related to the discovery of the great river system. The finding of a
route across the Blue Mountains, the tracing of a number of vagrant
streams to the Darling, the connection of that far-reaching river and
its tributaries with the Murray, and the following of the main trunk of
the whole concourse of waters to the sea, forms a distinct chapter in
the story, complete in itself. A separate series of inland explorations
must now he related, which were concerned in large measure with
waterless areas. What was the continent like at its centre? That was
the problem which a succession of tough and courageous men set
themselves to solve.</p>

<p>Flinders, during his captivity at Mauritius, drew up a plan for
penetrating the interior from the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria in
the north and the head of Spencer's Gulf in the south with five or six
asses to carry provisions for two parties, who were to meet in the
middle. He had no conception of what such an enterprise would entail,
nor had anyone else. Whether there was a large inland sea, as some
supposed, or a great mountain range, as appeared improbable, or a
desert, as seemed more likely, were questions upon which there was much
speculation. The only way to tell was to go and see. And, apart from
the problem of the interior, there was much work to do in the regions
lying between established settlements, as between Adelaide and Perth,
and Sydney and Melbourne. The traversing of the continent and its
unoccupied fringes is, then, the theme of this chapter. We will group
the principal expeditions according to the belts of territory with
which they were concerned, instead of considering them in chronological
order.</p>

<p>The journeys of George Grey, 1837-40, were confined to the western
and north-western coastal regions, and did not penetrate far inland.
Their chief result was the discovery of the Murchison and Gascoyne
Rivers and eight other streams. But they were fine adventures,
involving severe privations; and Grey's published narrative of them
suggested that the mastering of this region would make high demands
upon the skill and endurance of colonists. The distinction brought to
Grey by his explorations induced Lord John Russell to confer upon him
the governorship of South Australia.</p>

<p>Edward John Eyre was the first to make a considerable acquaintance
with the parched belt wherein less than ten inches of rain per annum
fall. He was but twenty-five years of age when he undertook on foot a
tramp of a thousand miles across as barren a tract of country as the
earth contains; but he had already made some difficult journeys with
cattle, and his expedition to Lake Torrens in 1839 showed him to be a
bold and resourceful explorer. In 1840 he resolved upon a larger
enterprise. He would, if he could, penetrate to the heart of the
continent.</p>

<p>With funds raised by a committee in Adelaide, Eyre fitted out an
expedition. Some of the committee thought that his energies could be
more profitably directed to finding a practicable route between
Adelaide and King George's Sound, but Eyre's mind was set upon his own
plan. He wished to plant in the very middle of Australia a silken Union
Jack which had been worked for him by the young ladies of Adelaide.</p>

<p>That distinction was not attained by Eyre, but he did accomplish a
very memorable achievement. First he penetrated the Lake Eyre basin
till he reached the hill which he called Mount Hopeless. Ahead of him
lay a wilderness of sand and salty swamp. His supply of water was
exhausted, and no replenishment was to be had in this Lot's-wife
country. So he toiled down to the sea coast to gather fresh stores; and
from Streaky Bay on the Great Australian Bight he resolved to carry out
the plan of his Adelaide friends, working his way westward along the
coastal fringe to King George's Sound. It seemed a mad endeavour to
make from that point, and when he sent for supplies and explained his
plan his supporters begged him to return home. But Eyre, showing that
dogged obstinacy which twenty years later, when he was Governor of
Jamaica, got him into trouble there, would not he beaten. To return
without a notable stroke of success to his credit was abhorrent to him.
He knew that the danger was great, and ordered the whites in his party
to return to Adelaide. But his overseer, Baxter, refused to leave him.
So with his companion and three young aboriginals Eyre set out on his
long march.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-21"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-21.jpg"></p>

<p>The tale of that tramp through a land of utter desolation is a
thrilling one. The pack-horses became exhausted after toiling 150 miles
without water, and when Eyre struggled on and found some by scooping
out a well six feet deep in limestone, were hardly strong enough to
stagger to it. Baxter quailed as the difficulties increased, but Eyre
would not turn back. After two months of this desperately severe work,
Baxter was murdered by two of the aboriginals, who made off into the
scrub. Eyre pushed on for two more months with only one black as a
companion. At the time of the murder he was 500 miles from any hope of
aid. Remembering to have read that Flinders found water in Lucky Bay,
Eyre made for the coast. He had to kill his horses for food, drying the
flesh in the sun to preserve it, after the fashion of the buccaneers;
and he was in prospect of a failure of this resource when he had the
good fortune to sight a French whaling barque, the <i>Mississippi</i>,
from whose captain he received sustenance. He stayed a fortnight with
his host, and then set out again on his dreary track, reaching his goal
at Albany on July 7, 1841. The whole expedition had occupied twelve
months, and, as an example of human will in conflict with adversity, it
was a striking adventure.</p>

<p>Sturt, whose voyage down the Murray has been considered in Chapter
XI, was occupying the post of Registrar-General of South Australia when
Eyre made his attempt to reach the centre of the continent. The humdrum
duties of an office did not suit Sturt's ardent spirit, despite his
desire to be useful. Brooding over the great unsettled problems, he
wrote that it would be 'a fearful but a splendid enterprise' to devote
two years to a solution of them. He knew the risks; but 'if I fell my
name would stand in a list I have always envied.' Securing official
assistance for the enterprise, Sturt planned to avoid the salt-pans
which had blocked Eyre's northward advance by following the Murray and
the Darling for about one hundred and eighty miles above their
junction, and then striking north. He had carefully observed the flight
of migratory birds during his previous explorations, and during his
residence in South Australia; and he noticed that they followed certain
regular lines which, when laid down upon the map, converged upon a
point a little to the north of the tropic of Capricorn. He argued that
the country to which these birds flew probably resembled that which
they had left--'that birds which frequented rich valleys or high hills
would not settle down in deserts or flat country.'</p>

<p>The reasoning was sound, and there is indeed such good country in
the far interior of Australia. But explorers are not birds; they have
to toil over hot, blinding sand before they reach the cool rills in the
shaded valleys. Moreover, the summer of 1844-5 was one of exceptional
torridity. The travellers actually traversed the Barrier Range, which
included that huge silver ingot, Broken Hill; but the gleam of water at
this period of their journey would have been more precious to them than
the metal which lay beneath their feet. For they were tortured by
thirst, and Sturt wrote that the truth flashed across his mind that 'we
were locked up in this desolate and heated region as effectually as if
we were ice-bound at the Pole.' Overhead the birds flew on their aerial
high-roads to some more hospitable region--parrots, pigeons, cockatoos,
bitterns--mocking Sturt with the constant evidence of the truth of his
theory; whilst upon the parched and blistered earth he and his
companions were stung with the burning sand which the wind blew in
their faces, and sore with scurvy. The monotony of sand and stones and
shrivelled vegetation was only relieved where here and there the
gravelly bed of some dried-up creek flamed with the brilliant scarlet
and black blossoms of 'Sturt's desert pea' (<i>Clianthus Dampieri</i>).
Where they expected to find water they obtained only a chalky paste
which 'fell like thick cream over the pannikin and stuck like pipe-clay
to the horses' noses.' The skin was burnt off the feet of the dogs; the
screws fell out of the boxes; the lead dropped out of the pencils; the
ink dried upon the pen before it could write a word upon the paper.
Northward of Cooper's Creek (or Barcoo) the explorers crossed twenty
miles of fiery red sand-ridges, and then plunged into the stony desert
which bears Sturt's name. Before them lay an immense plain covered with
lumps of quartz rounded by attrition and coated with oxide of iron.
'Not a feature broke the dead level, the gloomy, purple hue; not a
blade of vegetation grew on this forbidden plain.' Occasionally a loud
explosion would rattle over the startled desert like the sound of a big
gun, caused by the splitting and crashing of masses of rock in the
mountains to the westward; for sharp alternations of torrid heat by day
and cold by night cracked the boulders of the ranges in that awful
summer. 'Good heavens! did ever man see such country!' exclaimed
Harris-Browne, the surgeon of the party.</p>

<p>The stony desert beat Sturt, as the salt marshes of the Torrens
basin had beaten Eyre, and he was compelled to retreat. Just at the
moment when he mounted and turned the head of his horse southward to
march to his depot 443 miles away, a flock of parakeets flew shrieking
overhead. He knew that his theory was right; there was good country
beyond; those screaming birds, Sturt wrote, 'proved to the last that we
had followed with unerring precision the line of migration.' He wavered
as he turned. He was very reluctant to give up the quest whilst those
birds, speaking like oracles, flew in arrow-shaped formation to the
north, with the sun glancing from their burnished plumage as they
disappeared in the purple distance. But he could not go on. The gaunt
company of sun-blackened scarecrows on skeleton horses were driven back
to the Darling. 'On every play the curtain falls at last,' said the
gallant leader in a letter, 'and I believe that I shall never again
enter the field on which I have reaped my humble laurels.' His
foreboding was verified. He had reached within 150 miles of the centre
of Australia, but he was broken in health and his career as an explorer
was at an end.</p>

<p>But Sturt's example fired a young member of his party to take up the
task and carry it to success. John McDouall Stuart had been Sturt's
draftsman, and was keen to distinguish himself as an explorer. He made
some important discoveries of good cultivable land west of Lake Torrens
in 1858, proving his capacity to lead; and when in 1859 the South
Australian Government offered a prize of 2,000 pounds to the first man
to traverse the continent from south to north, Stuart determined to
make the attempt. Keeping to the west of the Torrens basin on a march
directly north from Adelaide, he reached the very centre of Australia
on April 22, 1860, and camped at a red sandstone hill covered with
spinifex and scrub. Tersely in his journal he recorded the triumph:
'Built a cone of stones, in the centre of which I placed a pole with
the British flag nailed to it; on the top of the cone I placed a small
bottle in which is a slip of paper stating by whom it was raised. We
then gave three hearty cheers for the flag.'</p>

<p>The name which Stuart originally gave to the hill was 'Central Mount
Sturt,' and he wrote in his Journal (the manuscript of which is in the
Mitchell Library, Sydney) that he named it 'after my excellent and
esteemed commander of the expedition in 1844 and 1845, Captain Sturt.'
The paper which he placed in the bottle on the top of the cone also
contained the name 'Central Mount Sturt.' (The paper is now in the
museum at Adelaide.) But the name was afterwards altered to 'Central
Mount Stuart,' and as such appears on most Australian maps. There is no
evidence to show that Stuart himself desired that his own name should
be substituted for that of Sturt. The change is said to have been made
by Governor McDonnell of South Australia. Stuart found in the centre of
the continent not an inland sea, not a desert, but a fine stretch of
fertile grass country. Scarcity of water on the further journey
north-west, combined with illness, lack of provisions, and attacks by
aboriginals, drove the party back to Adelaide.</p>

<p>In 1861 Stuart started out again with twelve men, to traverse the
continent. He went over his former route, got still farther north, was
blocked by the density of the scrub, and was compelled to beat a
retreat. But Stuart would not endure defeat. He made a third attempt in
1862, heading an expedition fitted out by the Government. This time he
was successful. On July 24 he and his men emerged upon the north coast
of the continent near Port Darwin, and looked upon the waters of the
Indian Ocean. He returned in triumph to Adelaide, to report that he had
passed through 'one of the finest countries one could wish to see.'
Stuart's journeys were of the greatest value in demonstrating that the
interior was conquerable, and in revealing the excellent pasturage to
be found in portions of the country. He dispelled much of the old-time
darkness and mystery from the 'Never Never,' and the 'Back o' Beyond.'
His three great journeys of 1859-62 cost the South Australian
Government only 9,143 pounds, including his own reward of 2,000
pounds.</p>

<p>The expeditions of Eyre, Sturt, and Stuart worked from Adelaide.
Another group of celebrated explorers, starting from Sydney, traversed
the country to the eastward of the dry, central belt. Ludwig
Leichhardt, a Prussian man of science, came to Australia in 1842 in the
hope of finding employment as a naturalist on some exploring
expedition. He had introductions to a German mission to the aboriginals
established at Moreton Bay, and from that centre he made a number of
expeditions inland, including a remarkably successful one to Port
Essington, in the extreme north centre of the continent. Amongst his
letters of introduction was one from Professor Owen of London to Sir
Thomas Mitchell, who happened in 1844 to be making plans for a journey
overland from Sydney to the Gulf of Carpentaria, and agreed to take the
eager young German student with him. As there was some hesitation on
the part of the Government in finding the money--though only 1,000
pounds was required--Leichhardt raised it amongst his friends, and set
out in command of an expedition of his own in October 1844. So
brilliantly did he accomplish his task that he had no difficulty in
obtaining funds for a second expedition (1846), also to the Gulf
country. But his next attempt proved fatal. In 1848 he proposed to
cross the continent from east to west, from the Darling Downs to Perth.
This was before it had been traversed from south to north, and while
the nature of the far interior still remained a mystery. Leichhardt
knew of Sturt's stony desert, but he hoped to avoid that obstacle. He
and his party started in March 1848, and certainly reached the Barcoo,
where the letter L was found cut upon a tree some years later. But
exactly where or how he perished has never been ascertained. The fate
of Ludwig Leichhardt is one of the unsolved mysteries of Australian
land exploration, as the fate of George Bass is an unsolved mystery
pertaining to one of the maritime explorers.</p>

<p>While Leichhardt was engaged upon his expedition of 1844, the funds
required for Mitchell's journey were authorised by the Government, and
he explored the Maranoa country at the back of the Darling Downs. He
found it in a good season, and rhapsodised about it in characteristic
fashion. Just as he had described the western district of Victoria as
another Eden, so he wrote of the sight of the Barcoo as a 'reward
direct from Heaven' for his fidelity to the belief that a river would
be found running from the middle of Australia to the Gulf of
Carpentaria. But, alas! Mitchell's psalm of joy was sung before he had
justified it. He returned to Sydney without following up his river.
People shook their heads; and when E. B. Kennedy was sent to see what
became of it, he found that, after flowing past the point where the
enthusiastic Surveyor-General had seen it, his Victoria River or Barcoo
(which was none other than Sturt's Cooper's Creek) most perversely took
a turn south, and squandered itself, after the manner of the inland
rivers, in shallow pools among sand-hills. Kennedy perished in 1848 on
another expedition to examine the rivers flowing into the Gulf of
Carpentaria. The journeys of A. C. Gregory in search of traces of
Leichhardt (1856 and 1858) traversed the great extent of country from
Adelaide to the Barcoo, and from northern Australia through the Gulf of
Carpentaria area to Port Curtis.</p>

<p>One of the most famous of Australian inland exploratory enterprises
was that of Burke and Wills (1861). The ECLAT with which it started and
the tragedy of its ending have invested it with an atmosphere of
romance. It was quite the most expensive and one of the best-equipped
expeditions that ever went to the interior. The great achievements of
Sturt cost an insignificant amount. The Burke and Wills expedition was
promoted by the public of Melbourne, who raised by subscription 3,500
pounds, which was supplemented by a grant of 9,000 pounds from the
Victorian Government. The object was to explore central Australia and
find out what pasture land it contained. The command was entrusted to
Robert O'Hara Burke, a police inspector of dashing appearance, who had
had no experience of the bush, and had shown no previous aptitude for
such work. He was an amateur gifted with much confidence and courage.
His second in command, Landells, who was taken because of his knowledge
of the ways of camels (twenty-four of which had been especially
imported from Peshawar), quarrelled with him before they got out of
touch with inhabited parts, and returned in ill-temper. The most
promising member of the party was a brilliant young man of science, W.
J. Wills.</p>

<p>The outstanding achievement of the Burke and Wills expedition is
that it was the first to cross the continent from south to north, for
it emerged from central Australia upon the southern shores of the Gulf
of Carpentaria on February 11, 1861, nearly a year and a half before
McDouall Stuart reached Port Darwin from Adelaide. Burke left his
caravan at Menindie on the Darling, and started north towards the Gulf.
He established a depot on Cooper's Creek, but instead of waiting for
the stores to come up, as he could well have done, impatiently resolved
to hurry on with three companions, Wills, and two others named King and
Gray. Reaching the Cloncurry, which flowed north to the head of the
Gulf, Burke drove on at such a pace that his camels died. As the
pack-horse which carried the food made slow progress, King and Gray
were left behind, whilst Burke and Wills made their final dash for or
the coast.</p>

<p>They reached the mouth of the Flinders River, into which the
Cloncurry flows, and saw the salt tidal water rushing in through the
mangrove jungle, but were too weak to push on till they actually beheld
the blue sea. The tragedy occurred on the return journey. Gray died by
the way, the plans made for rejoining the caravan miscarried, and the
two starved and thirst-tortured leaders perished miserably on the
Barcoo. King found refuge with a native tribe and was rescued. The
expeditions of William Landsborough, A. W. Howitt, and McKinlay in
search of Burke and Wills were fruitless to save them because the
gallant pair were dead before their rescuers started; but they
themselves did notable pieces of exploration. From first to last the
Burke and Wills expedition cost 50,000 pounds. Sturt, Eyre, Leichhardt,
Mitchell, and Gregory between them probably did not spend so much on
their far more important journeys. The wonder is that they did so much
with such scanty resources, and that Burke should have brought disaster
upon himself with such a lavish equipment.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-22"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-22.jpg"></p>

<p>Another series of inland explorations relates to the mountainous
region on the south-east of the continent, where the Murray and the
Murrumbidgee rise. In 1839 Angus McMillan, a young Scottish highlander
employed on a cattle station on the Monaro tableland, set out to look
for good grazing country to the south. Accompanied by an aboriginal, he
clambered over the hills till he got a view of the sea at Corner Inlet,
east of Wilson's Promontory. In 1840 and again in 1841 he penetrated
this mountainous district, opening the way to settlement in it. In 1840
also Count Strzelecki travelled through the mountains, named the
highest peak upon the continent after Kosciusko, the Polish hero, and
struggled through the wilds of Gippsland to Westernport. In naming the
district after his friend, the Governor of New South Wales, he
described it as a land 'which in richness of soil, pasture, and
situation, cannot be surpassed,' a verdict which later experience has
done much to confirm.</p>

<p>The inland explorations upon the western side of Australia were
directed principally from Perth after the formation of settlements upon
the Swan River, and they were naturally concerned with the examination
of the country stretching towards the centre. John Forrest in 1869 went
to look for Leichhardt; in 1870 he travelled from Perth to Adelaide
almost over the route of Eyre; and in 1874 he followed the course of
the Murchison River inland to the inhospitable region of sand and
spinifex. The Western Australian journeys of Ernest Giles were likewise
very remarkable feats of endurance. Especially so was that of 1875,
when, starting from Adelaide, he struck into the desert west of Lake
Torrens, travelled for hundreds of miles without water, reached Perth,
and thence after a rest started off again into the and country beyond
the Gascoyne and the Murchison, working round to the east of Lake Eyre,
and reaching Adelaide once more after traversing a circle of over 5,000
miles, mostly in utterly sterile territory. Giles verily seemed to have
the constitution of a camel.</p>

<p>These were the principal pieces of formal or planned exploration by
means of which the map of the interior of Australia was delineated. But
hundreds of brave and enduring men whose names are unknown to history
have done a great part in this pioneering work. The 'overlanders' with
their cattle, the prospectors with their picks and their pannikins, the
selectors searching for land for settlement, the squatters looking for
pastures, have struck out from the mapped routes into the trackless
places. The country had to be known in its harsher features as well as
in its richness and beauty, and many a forgotten hero has died in the
quest.</p>

<p><a name="ch21"></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI - QUEENSLAND</h3>

<blockquote><b>Settlement at Moreton Bay--Its abandonment--The
Gladstone Colony at Port Curtis--Separation of Queensland from New
South Wales--The new colony proclaimed--Its boundaries--Bowen's
governorship.</b></blockquote>

<p>The first settlement at Moreton Bay was founded in September 1824,
under the command of Lieutenant Murray of the 40th (South Lancashire)
regiment, principally as a place of punishment for convicts who had
committed offences after transportation to Australia. But Governor
Brisbane also had in view the preparation of the country by convict
labour for habitation by a farming class. The establishment of penal
depots at points favourable to cultivation was, he considered, 'the
best way of paving the way for free populations.' The rough labour of
clearing and of making highways would thus be done at little cost. It
is hardly doubtful, however, that from the point of view of pioneer
development the experiment was expensive out of proportion to the
beneficent results obtained from it. The convicts did clear the site of
Brisbane town, where the Quaker philanthropists Backhouse and Walker,
who visited the penal settlements in 1836, found 'some fine cleared and
cultivated land on the south bank' of the river.</p>

<p>Experiments were also made with sugar-cane growing and other
varieties of culture, but much of the work was unskilfully directed.
Dr. Lang related that when rice cultivation was attempted, instead of
the natural seed being sown, manufactured rice bought from a grocery
store was used; whereupon the climate was reported to be unsuitable for
rice growing! In view of the fact that some thousands of men were kept
at hard labour during the fifteen years that Brisbane was a convict
settlement, and that the establishment cost many thousands of pounds,
the amount of useful work done was very small. Governor Bourke in 1832
advised the abandonment of the Moreton Bay settlement, and in 1839 the
prisoners were withdrawn from it. The original site was not up the
river, where the city of Brisbane was built, but at Redcliffe, on the
shore of Moreton Bay. After the abandonment of this position on account
of the absence of water, the aboriginals called it Oompiebong, an
'oompie' (or, as more commonly spelt, humpy) being a hut, and 'bong'
signifying dead; it was the place of the abandoned huts. Hence it is
called Humpybong to this day.</p>

<p>During the penal period free settlers were strictly excluded from
within fifty miles of Brisbane. The precaution was taken in order to
make it very difficult for convicts to escape. Many did attempt to do
so, aided by the thick scrub and the long grass, and perished. Others
got away and lived for years with the aboriginals, but some of these
became weary of the life, and at length surrendered. Messrs. Backhouse
and Walker recorded that they found even women convicts wearing chains
'to prevent absconding, which they have frequently done under cover of
the long grass.'</p>

<p>As related in Chapter XVII, Gladstone, while Secretary of State for
the Colonies in Peel's administration (1846), determined to resume
convict transportation to Australia. As part of his policy he ordered
the establishment of a new penal settlement at Port Curtis, 350 miles
north of Brisbane. It was to be called Northern Australia, but is more
generally known as the Gladstone Colony; and it must not be confused
(as it has sometimes been) with the district of Gladstone on the west
side of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Colonel George Barney, of the Royal
Engineers, had been sent out to report upon the site, and he condemned
it as unsuitable; but Governor Fitzroy rejected his advice, and founded
the Gladstone Colony there in January 1847. The intention was that some
prisoners who were sent abroad under the conditional pardon system
should be deposited at this tropical station. They were to be called
exiles, not convicts, and Gladstone had an idea of sending out women
from the poorhouses of England, who were presumably to be married to
the 'Pentonvillains.' Barney, who was to govern the establishment, was
especially commanded by the Secretary of State to 'promote by all
possible means a healthy moral tone in the community.'</p>

<p>But Gladstone was in office only a few months at this time, and his
successor, Lord Grey, considered that the founding of the Gladstone
Colony was 'a needless and impolitic measure.' Indeed, the despatch
cancelling the order to found it was on its way before Colonel Barney,
in the LORD AUCKLAND, sailed from Sydney. He was ordered to remove the
whole company forthwith, and by August not a soul remained at Port
Curtis. When the RATTLESNAKE put into the bay in November she found
only a few piles of bricks, some posts, wheel-ruts, and empty bottles,
to indicate the former whereabouts of the last penal settlement
controlled from New South Wales. Robert Lowe, in his <i>Atlas</i>
newspaper, made much fun out of the failure, and Barney especially
became the mark of his satirical muse. In verses ridiculing the
Colonel's search for a place for the erection of buildings Lowe
wrote:</p>

<pre>
For six long hours he did the search pursue--
For six long hours--and then he thirsty grew;
Back to the rescued steamer did he steer,
Drew the loud cork and quaffed the foaming beer;
Then ate his dinner with tremendous gust,
And with champagne relieved his throat adust,
Fished for his brother flatfish from the stern,
And thus victorious did to Sydney turn.

</pre>

<p>The Gladstone colony had, however, one permanent result. Northern
Australia was to have comprehended all of New South Wales above the
latitude 26 degrees S. It included very fertile land, and Governor
Fitzroy was afraid that, if care were not taken, it would be all
occupied by squatters in an unauthorised manner, much as the land
north-west of Sydney had been in the early squatting days. He therefore
decided to lay out a town at Port Curtis, and to place a Government
Resident there to protect the rights of the Crown over the land. In
these circumstances the town of Gladstone was founded in 1853. Captain
Maurice O'Connell was appointed Government Resident, and held the
office as long as the country remained part of New South Wales. When a
separate colony was formed many favoured making Gladstone its capital,
instead of Brisbane, on account of its more central situation; but the
movement in that direction did not succeed.</p>

<p>In consequence of the discoveries of Oxley, Mitchell, Leichhardt,
and other explorers, attention was directed to the richness of the
Moreton Bay district, and immigration to it became general shortly
before the middle of the nineteenth century. By 1860 it had a
population rapidly approaching 30,000. The great progress which had
been made by the Port Phillip District after it had been erected into
the independent colony of Victoria by separation from New South Wales
stimulated these settlers of the north to agitate for a new division.
At present the entire territory of eastern Australia, from Cape Howe to
the Gulf of Carpentaria, was governed from Sydney, and the northern
people did not think that their interests were sufficiently considered.
The Imperial Government, in granting a constitution to New South Wales,
under the Act of 1842, had reserved power (by section 51) to 'erect
into a separate colony' any territories then included within
it--provided, however, that no land should be detached from New South
Wales southward of the 26th degree of south latitude. That provision is
important as showing two things: first, that the probability of a
necessity for the creation of a separate northern colony was foreseen
as early as 1842, and secondly, that at that time it was intended that
the country in the latitude of Moreton Bay, where the penal settlement
then was, should not be removed from the control of the Governor in
Sydney; for the 26th parallel cuts the country near Wide Bay, which is
a hundred miles north of Brisbane.</p>

<p>But the separation did not take place till seventeen years after
this date. In the meantime the agitation for it continued. Moreton Bay
had its representatives in the Legislative Council of New South Wales,
but was not content. Under the Act of 1850 'for the better government
of Her Majesty's Australian colonies,' power had been reserved to
constitute a new colony 'northward of 30 degrees of south latitude.'
The departure from the terms of the Act of 1842 would have given to the
new colony, when formed, the whole area from Wide Bay to a point south
of the mouths of the Clarence and Richmond Rivers, an especially rich
district. But powerful influences were exerted to retain this belt for
New South Wales, and when the colony of Queensland was proclaimed in
1859 the southern boundary was fixed at Point Danger 'in latitude about
28 degrees 8 minutes,' which left the Clarence and Richmond Valleys
under New South Wales jurisdiction. With this alteration, however, the
territory northward from Point Danger to Cape York was, by letters
patent dated June 6, 1859, erected into 'a separate colony to be called
the colony of Queensland.'</p>

<p>Very many of the separationists were disappointed that the boundary
line was moved, and Dr. Lang, who had been for years a fervent champion
of independence for Queensland (which he wished to have named
Cooksland), boiled over in angry denunciations. The means employed to
effect the change were, he said, 'discreditable.' But it seems clear
that the majority of the inhabitants in the district concerned wished
to remain in New South Wales; that the Colonial Office was influenced
by their desire; and that the result was not arrived at because, as the
furious Presbyterian divine alleged, Sir William Denison, Governor of
New South Wales, having two brothers holding nearly a quarter of a
million acres of land as squatters on the northern frontiers of that
colony at a merely nominal rental of a twentieth of a penny per acre,
'could scarcely be expected to be a disinterested referee' when the
question was 'referred to him for his decision.' It is true that a
petition signed by many inhabitants of the Clarence and Richmond Rivers
district asked for transference to the new colony; and much stress has
been laid upon this petition in later years by the advocates of the
formation of a new state in northern New South Wales. But a petition
from a section of a population is an imperfect index of general public
opinion. There was, also, a petition to the contrary effect. As there
was opposition in New South Wales to the separation of Queensland as
being 'premature and inexpedient,' and as this opposition would
certainly have been stronger had it been proposed to detach the
Clarence and Richmond, the boundary decision was prudent.</p>

<p>Queensland was the only one of the six Australian States which did
not require a separate Act of the Imperial Parliament for its
establishment. The letters patent were sufficient to confer upon it
separate being and constitutional authority. It was also the only State
of the group which did not pass through the probationary period of
government under a Legislative Council before full rights of
representative government were conceded. Two houses of Legislature were
established, the Legislative Council, according to the New South Wales
model, consisting of members appointed for life, whilst the Legislative
Assembly was elective. But Queensland abolished the Legislative Council
in 1922; and since that date has had only one house of Legislature.</p>

<p>Sir George Bowen, the first Governor, set the necessary machinery to
work directly after his arrival in Brisbane in December 1859, and the
first Parliament of Queensland commenced business on May 7, 1860. In
the interval Bowen managed affairs with admirable discretion. He had no
funds, no civil service, no police, no military force. The whole
mechanism of administration and order had to be created. 'As to money
wherewith to carry on the Government,' he wrote, 'I started with just 7
1/2d. in the Treasury. A thief--supposing, I fancy, that I should have
been furnished with some funds for the outfit, so to speak, of the new
State--broke into the Treasury a few nights after my arrival and
carried off the 7 1/2d. mentioned. However, I borrowed money from the
banks until our revenue came in.'</p>

<p>Bowen exposed himself to much hostile criticism by appointing to be
the first premier of the colony a young man of twenty-eight, Robert
Wyndham Herbert, who had come out from England with him as his private
secretary. Certainly it was a surprising selection, and it naturally
occasioned jealousy and heart-burning among local politicians. Herbert
was a scholar, who had been private secretary to Gladstone, and had a
thorough knowledge of British parliamentary practice. Bowen doubtless
felt the need of the assistance of a well-trained mind in inaugurating
parliamentary government in a new State; and, after all, if the
Queensland Parliament did not like Herbert, it could turn him out.</p>

<p>But, strange to say, the first Queensland Parliament found this
polished son of Eton and Oxford very much to its taste, and had no wish
to turn him out. Herbert's aptitude for business, his agreeable manner,
his political skill, made his premiership a pronounced success, and he
retained office till 1866, by which time the Queensland Parliament had
given scope for several men to manifest capacity for leadership. After
his return to England Herbert became Permanent Secretary for the
Colonies, and held that post for twenty-one years.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII - THE NORTHERN TERRITORY</h3>

<blockquote><b>Adjustment of boundaries--Queensland secures the Barklay
Tableland--South Australia undertakes to administer the Northern
Territory--Darwin founded--The overland telegraph line--Port
Essington.</b></blockquote>

<p>The mode of the foundation of the six States of Australia has now
been related; but there remained an area of over half a million square
miles, wedged between three but belonging to no one of them, nor yet
having a separate political existence of its own. The Northern
Territory is, notwithstanding its misleading name, the very central
region. It includes Central Mount Sturt and the Macdonnell Ranges. But
when the boundaries of South Australia, Western Australia, and
Queensland were defined, this piece of land, as large as France and
Germany combined, was left outside the limits of all of them. It
occurred in this way.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="0200471h-23a"></a><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-23a.jpg"></p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="0200471h-images/0200471h-23f.jpg"></p>

<p>When the western boundary of New South Wales was extended from the
135th to the 129th meridian the intention was to bring within the scope
of British possessions Melville Island, which was occupied in 1824. The
whole of the Northern Territory was thus, at that time, within the
jurisdiction of New South Wales. When Western Australia was founded,
its inland boundary was naturally drawn at the 129th parallel, which
thus became the eastern boundary of Western Australia and the western
boundary of New South Wales. These two colonies, therefore, absorbed
the whole continent.</p>

<p>Then South Australia was founded, on a large tract of country carved
out of New South Wales, and having its northern boundary at the 26th
degree of south latitude. Still the Northern Territory remained
technically part of New South Wales.</p>

<p>Next Queensland was formed, in 1859, with its southern boundary at
the 28th parallel of south latitude, whilst the western boundary, under
the somewhat ambiguous terms of the letters patent, was interpreted to
be the 141st meridian of east longitude, which was also the eastern
boundary of South Australia. So that now the Northern Territory, though
still technically part of New South Wales, was no longer contiguous to
any portion of the country over which that colony exercised governing
functions.</p>

<p>The question therefore arose,--What was to be done with this vast
central slice of Australia?</p>

<p>Queensland very soon formed the shrewd conclusion that it would be
to her advantage to secure more of the Gulf country than she already
had. A. C. Gregory, the explorer, who was Surveyor-General of the young
colony, pointed out that the 141st meridian would cut off Queensland
from 'the Plains of Promise,' as he called the fertile tropical flats
at the head of the Gulf. So in 1860 the Parliament of Queensland
requested the Imperial Government to allow the western boundary to be
defined, not at the 141st degree, which was mentioned in the letters
patent constituting the colony, but at the 138th degree. The granting
of the request in 1862, by shifting the boundary westward, enabled
Queensland to annex 120,000 square miles, including the Barklay
Tableland and a fine belt of fat pastures which in good seasons formed
a very valuable possession.</p>

<p>Another slight change of boundaries was made in 1861, when the strip
of country between South Australia and the Western Australian border,
that is, between the 132nd meridian and the 129th--about 70,000 square
miles--was transferred to the first-named province.</p>

<p>But the Northern Territory was still unappropriated. New South Wales
could not administer it, and the Imperial Government did not wish to
undertake the control of it. Sir Charles Nicholson, the Speaker of the
Queensland Parliament, writing in July 1862, suggested that it should
be temporarily annexed to Queensland. But that colony was not prepared
to undertake financial responsibility on account of the Territory, and
it did not suit the Colonial Office that there should be control
without responsibility. The Permanent Secretary, writing in August
1862, observed that it would be necessary that some measures should be
adopted for conferring protection and enforcing order among the
squatters, who were already examining parts of it with a view of
depasturing their stock upon its grass-lands. The Government desired
'to avoid expense, risk, and inconvenience,' such as would be entailed
in founding a tropical colony. They did not mind whether Queensland or
South Australia assumed control, as long as the Territory was provided
for in some way.</p>

<p>While the matter was under consideration, in the second half of
1862, McDouall Stuart was making his successful overland journey from
Adelaide to Port Darwin, and South Australia was eagerly awaiting his
return. If he came back and reported that the Territory contained
valuable pasture land or mineral deposits, South Australia wanted to
get control. Very much depended upon his report. In September 1862 the
Colonial Secretary, the Duke of Newcastle, had intimated that he was
willing to annex to South Australia all that portion lying south of the
tropic of Capricorn, leaving the remainder to Queensland. But South
Australia did not want that. She desired to get control of the whole
Territory if she assumed any responsibilities at all on account of
it.</p>

<p>McDouall Stuart returned to Adelaide on December 17, 1862, and his
report whetted the appetite of the colony. South Australia was now
eager to annex the Territory. The real value for pastoral and other
purposes of the region through which the exploring expedition had
passed was now fully made known, and Sir Dominick Daly, the Governor of
South Australia, reported to the Imperial Government that its
importance was so well recognized that 'applications have been
forwarded to my Government by stockholders of this province with a view
to secure the earliest claims to parts of the pastoral lands which have
thus recently been made known on the Victoria River and Arnhem's
Land.'</p>

<p>The Imperial Government was very glad to have the Territory taken
off its hands, and promptly announced to the South Australian
Government (May 26, 1863), that their wishes would be acceded to.
Letters patent were accordingly issued in July, annexing the Territory
to South Australia 'until we think fit to make other disposition
thereof.' That is to say, the Territory was not actually added to South
Australia, but that province was entrusted with the administration of
it.</p>

<p>The Government Resident, B. T. Finnis, who was sent up by the South
Australian Government, selected as the seat of administration a site at
Escape Cliffs, Adams Bay. The choice was adversely criticized, and the
dissatisfaction led to the recall of Finnis. The opposition party
wished the capital to be located on the Victoria River. But a place at
Port Darwin was preferred, and the township was named Palmerston, after
the Prime Minister. That name, however, did not come into general use.
People preferred to speak of the place as Port Darwin, and when the
Territory passed under the control of the Commonwealth the name of the
town was formally changed to Darwin. When Dilke was in Australia
collecting material for his book <i>Greater Britain</i>, he was invited
by the commander of a British ship to make a voyage with him to the
Northern Territory. If he would go he was promised that a cape or a
town should be named after him; but he was advised to prefer a cape, as
that would remain, though whether the town would retain its name, or
even its existence, the officer could not guarantee. The case of Escape
Cliffs was probably in his mind.</p>

<p>The burden of the administration of the Northern Territory continued
to be borne by South Australia for close upon half a century. There was
one dangerous period, in 1876-7, when the South Australian Government
was in negotiation with the Government of Japan for the introduction of
Japanese settlers. But the scheme broke down owing to political
disturbances in Japan in 1877, and it was not revived after order was
restored. (See Roberts, <i>History of Australian Land Settlement</i>,
pp. 359-60.) In 1911 the Territory became a dependency of the
Commonwealth. No less than 3,431,000 pounds of debt was incurred on
account of its development, responsibility for which was taken over by
the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The history of the Territory has been uneventful. The most important
piece of work done in it was the construction of the overland telegraph
line in 1872. McDouall Stuart had pointed out that his own route 'could
be made a straight line for telegraph purposes,' and this idea was
taken up by the electrician, Charles Todd, who superintended the
erection of the line from Adelaide to Port Darwin, connecting with the
submarine cable to Singapore and the East.</p>

<p>Brief mention should be made here of the abortive settlement made by
the British Government at Port Essington, on the extreme north-central
tip of the continent, in 1838. A small station had been established at
the port in 1831, in the expectancy that it would become a convenient
harbour for ships. But it was very little used. When Bathurst Island
was abandoned, troops were stationed at Port Essington. The Government
kept up the station from 1838 to 1849. But settlement was not attracted
to the spot, and the troops did not find the climate to be healthy or
agreeable. An old aboriginal was still living near Port Essington in
1915, who remembered the soldiers, with whom, as a little black boy, he
had been a pet seventy years before; and a traveller (Miss E. Masson,
in <i>An Untamed Territory</i>, 1915, p. 127) who saw him relates how,
at the mention of the old settlement, 'his back straightens, a curious
change comes into his voice, and he feebly attempts to shout the old
words of command-'Shon! eyes right!' So did the tones of some
long-forgotten Cockney Sergeant-Major linger ghostlike by the shores of
the Arafura Sea,' and recall a failure of the long ago.</p>

<p>The Australian colonies, having been endowed with complete
self-governing powers in the manner previously described, were free to
work out their own political destinies under the protection of the
British flag, but with a minimum of interference from the British
Government. They were at liberty to dispose of their lands as they
chose, to raise revenue as they chose--they could tax imports from each
other and from the mother-country, since no restrictions were placed
upon their fiscal freedom--to make whatever laws they chose relative to
their own form of government, the franchise, the relations of capital
and labour, and everything else within the domain of social and
political organization. They were enfranchised democracies, with scope
for exercising democratic government under such favourable conditions
as had rarely occurred before in the history of the world. They were
relieved from trouble concerning foreign aggression, because they were
sheltered by the greatest naval power in the world. That security was
the dominating fact in the history of Australia. Her people, while they
were developing their resources and shaping their institutions, never
had any serious anxiety about the safety of their country.</p>

<p>There were occasional 'scares,' when wars and rumours of wars
occupied the public mind, but there never was any serious danger.
During the Crimean War, in 1854, the people of both Sydney and
Melbourne were alarmed lest Russian cruisers should raid their ports.
Sir William Denison, who was Governor of New South Wales at the time,
had been an officer of the Royal Engineers, and took a lively interest
in the fortification of Port Jackson. Fort Denison, which in later
years came to be variously regarded as a picturesque survival or as an
impediment to navigation, according to the disposition of the beholder,
was constructed. Guns were also placed so as to command the entrance to
the port and its channels. But the excitement was soon allayed, and
there was no real cause for it, though it can be understood in view of
the paucity of information as to what was happening in Europe; for
there was no submarine cable at that time.</p>

<p>A curious document exists which, if genuine, shows that the Emperor
Napoleon III at one time gave thought to the possibility of making an
attack on Australia. While Lord John Russell was Foreign Secretary in
Great Britain this paper came into his possession. Having read it, he
put it in an envelope, scaled it up, and endorsed it with the words:
'Private. Very important. Questions drawn up by Empr. Napoleon with
view of seizing our Australian colonies and reviving privateering.
1853.' The paper itself purports to reveal a series of questions 'upon
the English colonies in Australia.' The questions related to the
distribution of the population, whether the rule of the mother-country
was popular, how many soldiers were in the country, what places were
fortified, what artillery there was, whether 10,000 men would suffice
to hold Victoria against any force which the English might bring to
retain the colony, which would be the best points for a landing, what
would be the principal obstacles to the success of such an expedition,
whether Algerian troops would be well adapted for such an enterprise,
and whether 'Geelong, Melbourne and Mount Alexander could be well
fortified in a short space of time.' The spelling of Port Phillip as
'Port Phillippe' suggests that the person who supplied Lord John
Russell with the information was a Frenchman; but the document is not
in French, though it professed to be copied from an original written by
Napoleon III. The copyist said, 'want of time, or rather the danger of
discovery, did not allow of a complete copy being taken.'</p>

<p>Russell's informant was therefore, clearly, a spy, and was probably
paid for the information he supplied. Whether in this instance he was
supplying correct information is doubtful. Two of the questions do not
indicate an intelligent knowledge of Australian geography. (1) The
sensational gold discoveries at Mount Alexander in 1851-2 gave
prominence to that place in the newspapers, but it is not easy to
believe that Napoleon III considered that inland hill, near
Castlemaine, a suitable position for fortification. (2) Another
question referred to 'the colonies of Victoria and Sydney.' Although
Lord John Russell thought the document 'important' in 1853, we should
not now consider it as more than interesting. There is certainly
nothing to corroborate the assertion of the spy that Napoleon III
thought of attacking Australia.</p>

<p>During the last period of the American Civil War, in January 1865,
the Confederate steamer <i>Shenandoah</i> entered Port Phillip, and her
commander, Lieutenant Waddell, asked permission of the Governor of
Victoria, Sir Charles Darling, to effect certain repairs to her
machinery, and to take on board coal and supplies. The ship had put to
sea from a port in Great Britain under the name of The <i>Sea King</i>,
but her name had been changed to <i>Shenandoah</i> during her cruise,
she had mounted guns of a ship of war, and had been employed in sinking
vessels belonging to the Federal (or Northern) States of America. All
British possessions were warned, when the civil war broke out in 1861,
that it was necessary to observe strict neutrality, and the Foreign
Enlistment Act forbade British subjects to take any part in the
contest. The <i>Shenandoah</i> was entitled, under the international
rules of war, to the consideration for which Lieutenant Waddell had
asked, and no offence was committed against the Government of the
United States (the 'Federal' Government) in permitting her to make
repairs and take in supplies.</p>

<p>But while the ship was in dock, the American Consul in Melbourne
warned the Governor that the crew of the <i>Shenandoah</i> was being
strengthened by the enlistment of British subjects, and that at least
one man had already gone on board. The Governor sent a police officer
with a warrant to arrest the man. But Lieutenant Waddell refused to
allow his ship to be searched for the purpose of executing the warrant.
He said that the deck of a man-of-war was 'inviolable,' and that sooner
than allow the police officer to make a search he 'would fight his
ship.' At the same time he gave to the Governor 'his word of honour as
an officer and a gentleman' that he had no British subject on board,
nor had he engaged anyone, nor would he do so while he was in the port.
There is no doubt that Lieutenant Waddell was not truthful in these
undertakings and statements.</p>

<p>The Victorian Government placed a police guard to watch the ship and
prevent British subjects from going on board. But despite these
precautions the <i>Shenandoah</i> did augment her crew while she was
within the port of Melbourne; and after leaving the port she committed
further depredations against shipping belonging to subjects of the
United States, which were computed by the Government of that country to
amount to 6,300,000 dollars.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the war, the United States Government made
claims against the British Government for compensation on account of
damage done by Confederate ships which had been allowed to sail from
British ports. The greatest amount of damage was committed by the
Alabama, and the whole case is consequently known by that ship's name.
The claims were referred to a court of arbitration which sat at Geneva
in 1872. The total amount awarded to the United States was 15,500,000
dollars (3,250,000 pounds). The arbitrators were not unanimous as to
whether any sum ought to be awarded on account of the
<i>Shenandoah</i>. Two were of opinion that no fault was committed at
Melbourne; but three held that the Victorian Government had been
negligent. By a majority of one, therefore, the court decided that
Great Britain was liable for 'all the acts committed by that vessel
after her departure from Melbourne on February 18, 1865.' As the court
decided to award what it termed a 'sum in gross,' without specifying
how much was allowed in particular instances, the official record does
not state what sum was awarded on account of the <i>Shenandoah</i>; but
though the amount cannot be precisely ascertained, there is evidence to
show that it was about one-fourth of the total sum. Sir Alexander
Cockburn, afterwards Lord Chief Justice of England, who was a member of
the court of arbitration, held that the award in respect to the
<i>Shenandoah</i> was unjust; and the Secretary of State wrote to
Governor Sir Charles Darling, informing him that in the opinion of the
British Government the actions of the Victorian Government in the
matter had been correct.</p>

<p>The constitutions conferred upon the colonies were not unalterable
instruments. They contained within themselves power to 'repeal, alter,
or vary' any provision. Thus, if New South Wales had desired to
substitute an elective for a nominated Legislative Council, she could
have done it by the simple passing of an Act for the purpose, provided
that the Act was passed by an absolute majority of the members of each
House. That the colonies would wish to alter their constitutions in
some respects was soon evident. As has already been pointed out, a very
large number of those who immigrated to this country in the
gold-digging era were English Chartists or men strongly imbued with
Chartist or extreme radical political ideas. Men like Henry Parkes,
David Syme, Graham Berry, James Service, and many others who influenced
thought or directed policy in Australia, had either been actively
connected with English Chartism or were imbued with Chartist
principles. They quickly saw opportunities for realizing their opinions
in Australia years before there was a possibility of securing
substantial reforms along such lines in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The attainment of voting by ballot presents a good illustration of
this statement. The principle was one of the six 'points' of the
English Chartists, and at the time when responsible government was
conferred upon the Australian colonies it had not been adopted anywhere
within the British Empire. It was brought forward in the Legislative
Council in December 1855. On a resolution in favour of voting by ballot
in the Electoral Bill then under consideration being carried against
the wish of the Government, the first Victorian Premier, Haines,
resigned office. But the motion, which was submitted by William
Nicholson, was adhered to by the House. Clauses embodying the ballot
principle were prepared by Henry Samuel Chapman, then a member of the
Victorian Legislative Council, and afterwards a judge in New Zealand.
Nicholson, though his motion secured the adoption of the ballot
principle, was unable to work out a practical method of giving effect
to it. Chapman's legal skill came to his assistance, and he was
therefore the real author of the Victorian ballot system, which was
passed into law in March 1856. In April 1856, South Australia also
adopted a ballot system. The other Australian colonies soon followed
these examples.</p>

<p>Yet there were many at the time who had grave misgivings about
abandoning the old familiar method of open voting at the hustings, and,
curiously enough, amongst them was Hugh Childers, then the Victorian
Commissioner of Customs, but afterwards a member of several Liberal
Governments in Great Britain. In England, where bills to institute
voting by ballot were rejected twenty-eight times by the House of
Lords, and where the supporters of the principle did not succeed till
1872, the system proposed was generally called during the discussions
'the Victorian ballot'; and a learned critic of American institutions
records that in that country 'secret or as they are called
"Australian," official ballot laws are now in force in all the States
except Georgia and South Carolina' (Bryce, <i>American
Commonwealth</i>, vol. ii, 148)</p>

<p>The Australian reformers brought with them from Great Britain a
stock of political ideas which those who advocated them had failed to
embody in legislative shape there, but which it was much easier to
enact in Australia. Phrases of English origin became the common stock
of Australian politics. The phrase 'one man one vote,' which expressed
the aspiration to abolish dual or multiple voting powers for the
propertied classes, was coined by Major Cartwright, the English
radical, in the great days of Pitt and Fox. It is the law in all the
Australian States, and the Commonwealth constitution enacts that 'in
the choosing of members each elector shall vote only once.'</p>

<p>The principle of payment of members of Parliament, adopted in all
the Australian colonies, was a Chartist demand. The abolition of the
property qualification for members of the popular house of legislature,
which all the Australian colonies likewise adopted, was taken from the
Chartist programme. So was manhood suffrage. The 'People's Charter' of
the early Victorian radicals did not, it is true, embody women's
suffrage; and the main arguments for that principle were borrowed by
its Australian supporters from John Stuart Mill and his school. South
Australia was the first of the six colonies to confer the franchise on
women (1894). Western Australia (1899) was the next. New South Wales
(1902) was the third. Tasmania enfranchised women in 1903, Queensland
in 1905, Victoria in 1908. When the Commonwealth was established, women
were enfranchised under the constitution; and are also eligible for
membership of Parliament.</p>

<p>The two colonies (New South Wales and Queensland) whose Legislative
Councils were, in the commencement of responsible government, elected
as nominee chambers, adhered to that system until 1922. In that year
the Legislative Council of Queensland was abolished. In the four other
instances the Councils were elected by constituents possessing property
qualifications. In 1934 the constitution of the Legislative Council of
New South Wales was altered (see earlier, Chapter XVIII).</p>

<p>There was one sharp crisis with the New South Wales Legislative
Council in the early years of its history. The constitution of
1855--Wentworth's Act--provided that the first Council of twenty-one
members should be appointed by the Governor for five years, but that at
the expiration of that term 'all future members shall hold their seats
for the term of their natural lives.' It happened that during those
first five years the Government headed by Charles Cowper had introduced
a Land Bill designed to make it easier for poor men to acquire farms.
The bill, whose author was John Robertson, embodied the contentious
principle of 'free selection before survey,' which meant that a
selector desiring to obtain a piece of land could enter upon any crown
land--even if it were already leased to a squatter--pick out a block,
and settle upon it. But the squatters who occupied large areas of land
leased from the Crown objected to this proposal, because it would
enable selectors to enter upon their sheep-runs, pick out the best
pieces, such as well-watered and fertile parts, and leave them with the
inferior land. It would also, they urged, enable men who had no real
intention to settle to enter upon a leased run and select, in the hope
that the squatter would pay them something to get rid of them. As the
Legislative Council consisted largely of landowners and others who were
friendly with the squatter class, it was quite expected that that House
would amend the Cowper Government's Bill.</p>

<p>The bill passed the Legislative Assembly in 1861. The five years'
term of the first Legislative Council was drawing to a close; and had
Cowper delayed the measure for a few weeks, he would have been able to
nominate such a Council as would certainly pass it. But he was
impatient to get his Land Bill upon the statute-book, and when the
Council amended it so as to prevent a selector from picking out land
upon a leased run, he adopted the startling course of advising the
Governor (Sir John Young) to appoint twenty-one fresh members. But
those nominees never took their seats in the first Legislative Council
of New South Wales; for when they presented themselves to be sworn in,
on the last day of sitting of the last week of the five years' period,
the President, Sir William Burton, at once resigned office and walked
out, followed by the majority of the members. Governor Young was
afterwards censured by the Secretary of State for the Colonies for
accepting advice to create 'upon a sudden and for a single night'
sufficient Legislative Councillors to convert a Government minority
into a majority. The new Council--entirely nominated, of course, by the
Cowper Government--carried its land legislation without demur.</p>

<p>After this incident the Cowper Government proposed to make the
Council an elective body. Wentworth, who had watched the proceedings
just narrated with indignation, now favoured the elective principle,
since, he declared in wrathful scorn, the nomination system had enabled
a Government 'to sweep the streets of Sydney in order to attempt to
swamp the House by the introduction of twenty-one members.' But a
committee to which the bill for establishing an elective council was
referred reported strongly against establishing an upper house based on
manhood suffrage; and, as Cowper had intended to make a wide franchise
the complement of his scheme, and now saw no hope of doing so, he did
not persist with it. In 1872 Henry Parkes made an attempt to introduce
an elective element into the Council, but failed to convince Parliament
that a change was desirable.</p>

<p>Not long after the commencement of responsible government the
elective Legislative Council of Victoria became engaged in a bitter
struggle with the Legislative Assembly, and public opinion in New South
Wales, watching the exciting events which were occurring over the
border, saw that the nominee system did after all afford a ready means
of bringing the Council into harmony with the policy of the Ministry of
the day, by the nomination of new members; whereas, under the system of
election on a property qualification, there was a much graver risk of
the two Houses getting into conflict and deadlock.</p>

<p>The Victorian quarrel, the first of a succession of such disputes
between two legislative bodies, was of great interest in the history of
parliamentary government in the British Empire; and the importance of
it is increased by the fact that it was connected with the initiation
of what ultimately became the economic policy of Australia as a whole.
In 1864 the Ministry of James McCulloch gave its support to the
principle of imposing customs duties upon imports, with a view of
encouraging the manufacture of those goods in Victoria; that is, to the
principle of protection. The conversion of McCulloch and his colleagues
to this policy had been somewhat sudden; for in a public speech at the
previous general election he had plainly declared, 'I am opposed to
protection; what the colony wants is to buy in the cheapest market and
to sell in the dearest.' But a strong body of public opinion had by
this time been formed in favour of the protective system, largely under
the influence of a man who played a silent but powerful part in
Victorian politics for about half a century.</p>

<p>This man was David Syme, a tall, granitic Scotsman, reared on
oatmeal and philosophy; a student, but also a keen man of affairs; a
thinker deeply interested in the serious literature and problems of the
modern world, but one who, whether engaged in cattle-breeding, or
scientific speculation, or politics, brought to bear upon the question
in hand the full force of a strong will and a hard, critical, somewhat
sceptical intellect. He came to Australia in 1853 and tried his luck on
the gold diggings. There he made some money, though he had not much
taste for the work. But in 1860 he found the real vocation of his life,
as well as his path to fortune, and--what he valued still
more--power.</p>

<p>His brother, Ebenezer Syme, had also come to Australia, and was at
this time writing articles for a newspaper called the AGE, which had
been started in October 1854. This journal had vehemently championed
the cause of the Ballarat miners, but its original proprietors had no
liking for the opinions expounded by the little group of men who wrote
its leading articles. Ebenezer Syme and his colleagues were, indeed,
slashing about in fine style; so that the proprietors, who had simply
started the paper to make money and were disappointed in that regard,
sold it in December to a co-operative group of printers, who had very
little capital, but plenty of energy. Then David Syme came along with
the money he had made from mining. His brother advised him to buy the
AGE, which was on the brink of extinction. David Syme had no belief in
the speculation. He doubted whether there was scope for another
newspaper in Melbourne. But he did believe in his brother, who had been
assistant editor of the <i>Westminster Review</i> in London, and was a
man of keen insight. So in 1856 when the AGE, with its plant and type,
was sold at auction, it was bought for 2,000 pounds by James McEwan, a
Melbourne ironmonger, on behalf of the Syme brothers. The newspaper did
not make sufficient profit to maintain both of them, and David Syme
engaged in contracting till his accomplished brother died in 1860,
when, rather unwillingly, he took over the management himself.</p>

<p>On many subjects Syme had thought himself into opinions which were
at variance with those commonly entertained. Nearly everybody in
Australia who took a keen interest in politics at that time was a
free-trader. Cobden and Bright and the Anti-Corn-Law League had
triumphed in Great Britain in 1845, when they won Sir Robert Peel to
their side; and English colonists, especially those who favoured
liberal principles, accepted free trade as a fixed part of the British
system. Syme himself said in a letter that, when he started to advocate
protection for native industries in the AGE, 'there was not, so far as
I knew, a man in the whole country but was a free trader.' But he came
to the conclusion that it would be very difficult, if not impossible,
to establish successful manufacturing industries in Victoria as long as
manufactures were exposed to the unrestricted competition of British
and foreign firms, commanding large capital and great output. 'A bar is
put upon the attempt at the very outset,' he said in the first leading
article he wrote on the subject; and unless local efforts were
protected by the imposition of duties on imported manufactures, the
people of this new country would 'be as utter strangers to all
scientific skill and practical dexterity in the arts and manufactures
of highly civilized nations as are the Bedouins of Barbary or the
Tartars of Central Asia.'</p>

<p>Whether this was a true theory of trade or otherwise is not a
subject with which we are now concerned. We have to do with historical
causes and consequences; and the effect of Syme's advocacy of
protection, which he maintained with unflagging vigour, was very
remarkable. During a period of commercial depression he persisted in
his policy, and very soon there was a strong party in Melbourne which
carried the agitation to the platform and forced it forward as a
political issue. Politicians who had scouted protection began to
realize that Syme's journal was carrying weight with the electors. A
parliamentary champion was found in Graham Berry, a London Chartist
with a fervid oratorical temperament. After a general election in 1865
there was a majority of members of the Legislative Assembly in favour
of imposing a protective tariff, and McCulloch, who, like many others,
had swung round, pledged his Government to introduce one.</p>

<p>When McCulloch carried out his promise by submitting a tariff to
Parliament in 1865, his Government was already engaged in a quarrel
with the Legislative Council, which he had proposed to reform by
reducing the property qualification and shortening the period for which
the members were elected from ten years to five. The Council had
promptly rejected this measure, and McCulloch judged from the tone of
the debate and his knowledge of the political atmosphere that his
tariff would be treated in a similar manner. He therefore determined to
throw down a challenge to the combative Council by sending the tariff
to it not in a separate bill, which would have been the proper
procedure, but 'tacked' to the Appropriation Bill for voting money for
the ordinary annual services of the country.</p>

<p>The expedient of 'tacking' a measure known to be repugnant to an
upper house, to an annual appropriation bill, was not a new one. It had
been done in England in the reign of William III, but had always been
regarded by the House of Lords as an unconstitutional procedure. But
McCulloch clearly meant not merely to force his protective tariff
through Parliament, but also to break the Legislative Council, which he
had failed to reform. By 'tacking' the tariff to the Appropriation Bill
he threw upon the Council the responsibility of accepting or rejecting
the whole measure, since under the Victorian constitution a bill
appropriating revenue was one which the Council was not empowered to
amend. It could accept or reject, but could not alter a line.</p>

<p>Then commenced a protracted conflict of exceptional acuteness. The
Council 'laid aside' the bill. Consequently the Government did not
obtain authority to spend the money which was required to carry on
public works, pay the civil service, meet bills, and so forth.
Meanwhile the Government continued to collect revenue from importers,
who were compelled to pay duty on their goods. This they did in
accordance with the British practice, which made duties of customs
collectible from the time of the proposal of new rates to the House of
Commons, and before they had been sanctioned by Parliament. Some of the
merchants sued the Government to recover money which they held to have
been illegally collected, and the Supreme Court decided in their
favour. But the Government defied the Court and went on collecting the
revenue, which it was legally neither empowered to take nor authorised
to spend. McCulloch's ingenuity hit upon the device of borrowing 40,000
pounds from the London Bank of Australia, of which he was a director,
and then inducing the Bank to sue the Government for the recovery of
the money borrowed. The Government did not defend the suit, the Bank
got judgment in its favour, and the Governor authorised the handing
over of the 40,000 pounds. It was clever, and it enabled the Government
to tide over present difficulties under shelter of law. By several
repetitions of the processes of borrowing and of paying back under an
order of the Court, the claims of the public creditor were met. But the
difficulty between the two branches of the Legislature remained
unsettled.</p>

<p>In November the controversy entered upon a new phase, when the
Government consented to send a separate tariff bill to the Council,
thus removing the 'tack' to the Appropriation Bill which had given such
offence. But the bill now contained a retrospective clause, designed to
render of no avail judgments which had been obtained from the Supreme
Court by the merchants who had sued the Government. The Council
objected to this and several other provisions of the bill, and refused
to pass it. The position of deadlock between the two Houses was
therefore unrelieved.</p>

<p>As there was no constitutional means of settling such differences,
the Government determined to appeal to the country. The Governor, Sir
Charles Darling, on the advice of his ministers, granted a dissolution
of the Legislative Assembly. The Legislative Council, though an
elective body, was not, under the constitution, affected by a
dissolution. Its members held their seats during the ten years for
which they were elected, no matter what happened to the other branch of
the Legislature.</p>

<p>The general election evoked to the shrillest pitch the storm of
controversy which had raged in the country during the discussion of
these events. The opulent resources of the English language were fully
exploited for terms of abuse which partisans hurled at each other. The
issue was mainly that of protection, and the action of the Council in
rejecting the tariff. The Council itself, though thoroughly unpopular,
certainly had constitutional justification for refusing to pass a money
bill with extraneous provisions 'tacked' to it. But the set of public
opinion against what was generally regarded as a compact body of
landowners fighting for their own interests was so determined that the
constituencies were little inclined to weigh technical justifications.
The McCulloch Government was swept back to power on a wave of popular
enthusiasm, and it faced the new Parliament in 1866 with a solid and
resolute protectionist majority behind it.</p>

<p>Even now, however, the Council would not yield. Once more it
rejected the Tariff Bill, which, it must be confessed, received little
consideration on its merits as a measure of protection, because it was
complicated with provisions which McCulloch's pugnacious
Attorney-General, Higinbotham, insisted on putting into it, and which,
the Council held, ought not to form part of a bill imposing customs
duties. The simple issue of tariff or no tariff was not laid before the
Council. It was clogged with other principles.</p>

<p>McCulloch now resigned office, but the Assembly passed a resolution
informing the Governor that it would not support any Government which
did not persist with the bills already submitted to the Council. It was
therefore plainly useless for the Governor to choose a Ministry from
the opposition. No form of government which the wit of man can devise
will work well unless those who live under it are prepared to oil its
wheels with good-will. The British constitution, upon which the
Victorian instrument was modelled, would break down unless in times of
crisis a spirit of concession prevailed. But the two Victorian houses
in 1865-6 had come to a condition of deadlock through a conflict of
obstinate wills, and as the latter year wore on relations were strained
almost to breaking point. There was much inflammatory rhetoric;
revolution rumbled behind the menacing clouds of political conflict,
something had to give way.</p>

<p>McCulloch resumed office, and reintroduced the Tariff Bill. It was
passed for the fourth time and sent to the Council. But cool advice had
been tendered to the members of that body, and they now proposed a
conference between selected members of the two Houses. As the result of
talks between fourteen representatives, the Tariff was at length
accepted by the Council with the elimination of the retrospective
clause and of certain expressions in the preamble declaratory of the
rights of the Assembly, to which strong opposition had been made.</p>

<p>The protective policy, which was due mainly to Syme's advocacy, was
thus initiated in Victoria amidst furious storms. Incidentally the
struggle made the fortune of the AGE, and gave to Syme the pre-eminence
in Victorian politics which he continued to exercise as long as that
generation survived. He was a more vigorous thinker and a stronger
personality than were most of the politicians, and he dictated policies
to them from his newspaper office, confident that the electorate would
follow his lead. His success was the result of hard fighting and a
consummate understanding of how to manipulate political forces. But
though the tariff issue was now settled, days of peace were by no means
at hand. Rancours bubbled in the parliamentary cauldron, and fresh
flames burst forth shortly.</p>

<p>The position of Governor Darling throughout the recent disputes had
been one of exceptional difficulty. The disruption of the normal mode
of financing the affairs of government, the resort to the expediency of
borrowing money from a bank and getting the bank to sue the Government
for the amount borrowed because Parliament had not passed the necessary
Appropriation Bill, the uncompromising cleavage between the two Houses,
the whole welter of bitter controversy, had thrown upon Darling
responsibilities in discharging which he was bound to displease the one
party or the other. He had acted upon the advice of his ministers, and
that advice had been given in the heat of party conflict and for the
purpose of winning party victory. But he had shown marked sympathy with
his ministers, and had in an official despatch attacked certain
petitioners against the action of the McCulloch ministry as guilty of
'conduct highly discreditable,' as 'ministering to their own personal
and pecuniary profit' in what they had done, and as unworthy of ever
holding responsible office. A review of Darling's actions during the
crisis induced the Secretary of State to write a despatch censuring and
recalling him.</p>

<p>But, however much the Legislative Council and its supporters might
hate the Governor, he was a popular hero. The stalwarts of the Assembly
declared that he had been victimized by the Colonial Office because he
had not thwarted the popular cause. The rich squatters, they said, had
compassed his ruin because he would not be their creature. Torchlight
processions and public demonstrations were held in his honour, and he
might have papered Government House with the illuminated addresses
which poured in. The Assembly voted an address wherein it stated that
Darling had saved Victoria from anarchy by adhering to the principles
of popular government. As he could no longer expect employment in the
Colonial Office the Assembly voted 20,000 pounds to Lady Darling.</p>

<p>Again the country boiled with excitement. The 20,000 pounds item was
included in the supplementary estimates of expenditure, and the
Legislative Council promptly rejected the bill, contending that such a
grant ought to have been the subject of a separate measure. Though the
new Governor, Manners-Sutton, sent a message to the Council informing
it that Darling had resigned from the colonial service in the belief
that the grant would be made, and that failure to make it would be in
the nature of repudiation, the Council would not yield. McCulloch
adopted in regard to the Darling grant the method that he had pursued
on the tariff. He resigned, but his solid majority would not grant
supplies to the Ministry which Manners-Sutton induced to succeed him.
Then he consented to resume office on condition that he secured a
dissolution which would enable him to take the verdict of the country.
Once more he and his party were triumphantly returned. But this time
the Imperial Government, thinking that Victoria had had enough of
bitter strife, ended it by granting to Darling a pension of 1,000
pounds a year for life, whereupon he intimated that Lady Darling would
not accept the 20,000 pounds which the Assembly was determined to
vote.</p>

<p>There was another deadlock between the Victorian Houses in 1877 on
the question of the payment of members of Parliament. The principle had
been approved by the country, and the Legislative Council had twice
(1870 and 1874) passed Acts embodying it. But these had been temporary
measures, lapsing after a prescribed time. The Government headed by
Graham Berry now (1877) resolved to make payment of members the
permanent rule. A bill for the purpose was passed by the Assembly, but
was rejected by the Council. Berry thereupon resolved to fight the
Council; and he threw down a challenge to it by including the required
sum in the annual Appropriation Bill. It was another instance of
'tacking,' and the rejection of the measure was a foregone conclusion.
Berry was determined to exert coercive pressure upon the Council which
had so often and so defiantly thwarted the Assembly.</p>

<p>As the Council would not pass the Appropriation Bill containing the
offending item, and the Assembly would not have the bill without the
item, Berry resolved to reduce expenditure and carry on government by
an expedient. On January 8, 1878 (known in Victorian history as Black
Wednesday), by proclamation he dismissed a considerable number of
public servants from their offices. They were principally heads of
departments and well-paid officials, and their sudden ejection from
office, by depriving them of the means of paying rents, interest on
mortgages, tradesmen's bills, and other debts, brought about an
immediate collapse in the value of property. It was plainly intimated
that other dismissals might follow. The plea was the necessity for
reducing expenditure, but the political object undoubtedly was to bring
pressure to bear on the Council and make its members sorry for their
defiance. Next, Berry induced the Assembly to declare by resolution
that grants of money voted by it were to 'become legally available for
expenditure,' without the concurrence of the Council. Thirdly, he
persuaded the Governor (Sir George Bowen), that he could legally sign
what were called 'Treasury warrants,' authorizing expenditure which had
been voted by the one house of legislature but not ratified by the
other.</p>

<p>These were not strictly constitutional acts, but they were
effective. In March 1878 intermediaries declared that the Council would
now view the payment of members proposal in a more conciliatory spirit.
The Appropriation Bill was passed without the 'tack,' and the Council
agreed to a Payment of Members Bill to operate till the end of the
existing Parliament, with the understanding that a permanent measure
for the purpose would afterwards be accepted. In 1880 a bill making
payment of members part of the regular governing system of Victoria was
passed without dispute, the Council, however, stipulating that it
should not apply to its own members.</p>

<p>There have been disputes between the two houses of legislature in
other colonies, but none approaching in interest and constitutional
importance, or in intense feeling, the celebrated Victorian struggles
of 1865-6 and 1877-8. The memory of them caused the framers of the
Commonwealth constitution to make especially careful provision for
remedying deadlocks which might arise between the two houses of the
federal legislature. The Victorian Council itself, moreover, recognized
a little later (1881) that its own constitution was dangerously remote
from popular influences, and reformed itself by reducing the property
qualification of its members and electors and the size of its electoral
provinces. After 1881 it became rather less of a squatting oligarchy,
and somewhat more representative of human beings than of sheep than it
had been in the years of its historical fights with McCulloch and
Graham Berry.</p>

<p>For the upbuilding of Australia, the first need was population to
occupy its empty spaces and set its industries throbbing. The Wakefield
system had provided for the application of the proceeds of land sales
to the stimulation of a steady flow of immigrants from Great Britain,
and a New South Wales committee on immigration which sat under the
chairmanship of Chief Justice Forbes in 1835 strongly recommended that
the land revenue should be 'held sacred' for this purpose. In 1842
Governor Gipps announced it as his intention to apply 'the whole of the
money derived in any shape from land to the purposes of immigration.'
But this policy was never consistently followed in any part of
Australia.</p>

<p>In the days when the great squatting properties were being formed
the landowners were by no means favourable to the encouragement of a
constant stream of immigrant settlers. As long as they could obtain
sufficient labour to shear their sheep and tend their herds they were
content. They did not wish to see the good lands cut up among farmers,
but considered that the country would fare better--or at all events
that they themselves would derive larger profits--from the allocation
of these areas among a wealthy class of sheep and cattle magnates. They
were satisfied with convict labour; some advocated the introduction of
coolie labour from China. But they were suspicious of the free
immigration of a British peasantry and farming class, who would
probably--as indeed they did--clamour for the breaking up of the large
estates. Various systems of 'bounty,' 'assisted,' and 'nominated'
immigration were, however, tried between the period of the thirties and
that of the establishment of the Commonwealth, which was empowered
under the federal constitution to assume control of immigration. In
1837 and later years George Fife Angas introduced a large immigration
of German families to South Australia, where they proved themselves to
be very valuable settlers. Dr. Lang also went out as an immigration
missionary in behalf of his pet colonies of Victoria and Queensland,
and wrote books extolling their attractions.</p>

<p>As early as 1841 a committee of the Legislative Council of New South
Wales considered the advisableness of introducing coolie labour from
Asia. The Committee reported strongly against the proposal, chiefly on
two grounds. First, the introduction of an alien and servile element
was deemed to be undesirable because it would alter the racial
character of the population. It would prevent the maintenance in
Australia of 'a social and political state corresponding with that of
the country from which it owes its origin.' Secondly, coolie labour
would compete with immigrants from Great Britain, and so seriously
lower wages that ultimately coolie labour only would be imported. This
view was supported by the ablest of Australian governors, and by
statesmen in Great Britain who gave attention to Australian affairs.
Sir Richard Bourke wrote that the introduction of coolie labour would
mean 'a sacrifice of permanent advantage to temporary expediency'; and
Lord Glenelg, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, emphatically
declared that the introduction of Asiatic labour would bring
agricultural work in Australia into disrepute, and consequently check
the immigration of labourers from Great Britain. The clear expression
of these views in the late thirties and early forties of the nineteenth
century was an interesting prelude to the policy which Australia was
hereafter to lay down as essential to her existence as a nation of
European origin.</p>

<p>A disposition to exercise a filtering care in the character of
immigration made itself apparent as soon as representative institutions
got to work. The South Australian constitution had barred that province
against the reception of convicts from the beginning; and the first
Legislative Council of Victoria passed very stringent Acts against the
incursion of expirees and ticket-of-leave men from Tasmania. The influx
of Chinese to the gold-fields drew attention to the danger that menaced
Australia from the fact that her shores lay within a few days' steaming
of the overcrowded areas of Asia. In 1858 there were 33,000 Chinese on
the Victorian gold-fields, whilst five years before there had been
fewer than 2,000. The antipathy to them existed mainly among the miners
and artisans, but there were others also who on broad grounds
considered that it was undesirable to permit an admixture of races in
this sparsely populated land.</p>

<p>The first Act to limit Chinese immigration was passed in Victoria in
1855. It imposed a poll-tax of 10 pounds on each Chinese immigrant, and
forbade ships to carry more than one Chinese passenger for every ten
tons of the vessel's tonnage. Four years later the law was stiffened by
requiring Chinese to pay a residence tax of 4 pounds per annum. This
legislation was not disallowed by the Crown, though the Secretary of
State wrote that it was considered highly objectionable in principle.
Queensland and New South Wales also became uneasy about Chinese
immigration. Both colonies passed stringent measures. Parkes was
confronted with an awkward anti-Chinese feeling in 1888. The British
Government at this time was disposed to frown upon the exclusion
policy, which they did not regard as being in harmony with British
treaties with China. Lord Salisbury, then Foreign Secretary, had
received a protest from the Chinese Ambassador. But it was impossible
to disregard the repugnance of the people for whose welfare the various
Australian Governments were responsible. There were riots in Brisbane,
and mob violence on the gold-fields created a dangerous situation.
Parkes felt it to be necessary to speak plainly. The Australians, he
publicly declared, were not 'school-children who can be called to
account by the Prime Minister of England'; and 'neither for Her
Majesty's ships of war, nor for Her Majesty's representatives, nor for
the Secretary of State, do we intend to turn aside from our purpose,
which is to terminate the landing of the Chinese on these shores for
ever.'</p>

<p>The legal right of a British colony to exclude aliens whom it does
not desire to admit within its borders was determined in the Victorian
case of TOY versus MUSGROVE. In this case a Chinese commonly known as
Ah Toy--his full name was Chung Teong Toy--came to Victoria in 1888 in
the ship <i>Afghan</i>. He was one of 268 Chinese in the vessel. That
number was 254 in excess of the number of Chinese who could be admitted
from a vessel of the <i>Afghan</i>'S tonnage, under the Victorian law.
The collector of Customs at Melbourne, Musgrove, acting under
instructions from the Minister of his department, refused to allow
these persons to land. Ah Toy thereupon brought an action in the
Supreme Court of Victoria, to test the legality of his exclusion. The
Supreme Court, by a majority of four judges against two (Chief Justice
Higinbotham and Mr. Justice Kerferd being the minority) decided in
favour of Ah Toy. But the Government of Victoria appealed to the Privy
Council, the highest court of appeal in the British Empire in cases
from the colonies. The Privy Council, in 1891, decided that 'an alien
has not a legal right, enforceable by action, to enter a British
colony.' That judgment set at rest all doubt as to the right of the
Australian colonies to pass laws to exclude Chinese, or any other
aliens, if they thought it prudent to do so.</p>

<p>The common feeling on this burning question induced Parkes to call a
conference of representatives of the various Governments to consider a
common line of policy, and that inter-colonial conference, held in June
1888, brought all the colonies to a common line of action upon a matter
of public policy.</p>

<p>The land legislation of Australia might very well be described by
the phrase which Oliver Cromwell used concerning the laws of
England--'an ungodly jumble.' In all the colonies, in the beginning, it
was easy to get land. The aim of Government was to induce people to
settle. An unmeasured space waited occupation. Naturally, the best land
soon became the possession of comparatively few people, who acquired it
cheaply and held it in large estates. But, as population increased,
these large holdings were found to be inconvenient. Broadly speaking,
the aim of Governments, since the era of responsible government, was
that of settling a yeomanry. John Robertson's 'free selection before
survey' policy in New South Wales, Charles Gavan Duffy's Land Act in
Victoria in 1862, the Homesteads Act of Queensland, and many other Land
Acts, had this aim in view. In all the States there were fierce
conflicts between the squatters, who got there first, and the
selectors, who complained that the good land had mostly gone before
they were born; that the lands which were fit for cultivation were
being used for feeding sheep, whilst the lands which were quite good
enough for sheep but doubtfully good enough to cultivate were all that
were available for the higher purpose. To the student of Australian
history it will appear that such a conflict of interests was bound to
arise. It could only have been avoided if the Government, from the
commencement, had withheld land from those who wanted to use it for the
purposes for which it was at the time most profitably adapted; or if
some rigorous prescription of areas had been applied.</p>

<p>In later years various expedients for decreasing the great estates
have been attempted: compulsory repurchase and the imposition of
taxation on unimproved land values being the favourite methods. Many
experiments failed. Duffy's scheme for settling farmers on crown lands
on easy terms resulted in much 'dummying' by squatters and others who
put up their own nominees to acquire land for them; and Robertson's
free selection policy resulted in 'peacocking' by squatters who induced
sham selectors--really agents of their own--to apply for and obtain the
best part of leased runs on Crown lands. Many a well-intentioned act
that aimed at creating opportunities for small farmers, in the long run
made large estates bigger. Moreover, the diversion of much of the
energy of younger generations to manufacturing industries, which sprang
up behind the barrier of customs duties, weakened the pressure upon the
country areas. The policy of water conservation and irrigation, in some
localities, has occasioned a degree of intense culture upon small areas
that would have seemed impossible to former generations.</p>

<p>South Australia had much less difficulty with her squatters and her
land than had the other colonies. The trouble in New South Wales and
Victoria was that squatters had been allowed to occupy leased runs and
to spend money in making improvements upon them, without any really
clear reservation of the right of the Crown to dispose of the lands to
farmers in smaller areas; and the squatters, therefore, resented the
intrusion of late comers who wished to pick out the best pieces for
settlement. But South Australia laid down in wide terms a clear and
simple rule which reserved to the Government the right at any time to
resume leased lands 'for any purpose of public defence, safety,
improvement, convenience, or utility.' The handling of land questions
in South Australia was marked by forethought and practical wisdom; and
in one conspicuous particular she devised legislation which has been
copied with beneficial results not only throughout Australia but also
in many colonies of foreign nations.</p>

<p>That reform was the Land Transfer Act, commonly known as the Torrens
Act. Robert Torrens was the collector of customs at Port Adelaide. He
was not a lawyer, and he knew little about the intricacies of the legal
methods of land transfer which had been copied in Australia from Great
Britain. If a man bought a piece of land, he became possessed of a
sheet of parchment whereon was engrossed at great length the tale of
the previous ownerships of the property. These parchment title-deeds
were costly, and the phraseology of them, which only a legal specialist
could profess to understand, had been the subject of innumerable
judicial decisions. Torrens knew, from his experience as a customs
officer, that shipping was bought and sold without all this engrossing
of prolix jargon. There was an official register in which the change of
ownership of a vessel was entered, and a simple certificate from the
registrar was a sufficient token that the person named in it was the
legal owner. Torrens asked himself why such a cheap and easy method
should not be adapted to the transfer of land.</p>

<p>When South Australia acquired responsible government Torrens entered
Parliament as member for Adelaide, and commenced to advocate his
improved system. But he was opposed and ridiculed. Lawyers declared
that land had been transferred by means of title-deeds from time
immemorial, and that no other method would give an owner security of
tenure. The Chief Justice said that mere registration would not
suffice. When Torrens brought a bill embodying his suggestions before
Parliament he was laughed at. How could a layman presume to argue that
another method was easy and safe, when experienced lawyers assured him
that it would never do? But Torrens insisted that it would do, and the
South Australian Parliament, despite the opposition of the legal
members, believed him. The Real Property Act was passed in 1858, and
Torrens himself, resigning his seat in Parliament, was appointed to
draw up the regulations under it, and superintend their working.</p>

<p>The result was completely successful. A landowner who registered his
property under the Torrens Act received the duplicate of a certificate
which the office retained; and this was perfect evidence of his
possession. If he wished to sell, the purchaser obtained the
certificate from him, and, on the sale being registered, the change of
ownership was complete; if he wished to mortgage, the certificate was
taken to the Registrar's Office, and the mortgage was marked upon it.
There was no delay, the process was cheap, and anybody could, by paying
a small fee, find out at the Registrar's Office who owned any piece of
land at any time.</p>

<p>The other Australian colonies very rapidly adopted the Torrens
system, and it was likewise applied in the French colonies. Indeed,
Leroy Beaulieu, in his great treatise on <i>Colonization Among Modern
Peoples</i>, states that such a system of land transfer is essential to
the success of a colony. He claims (vol. ii, p. 25) that the idea had a
Frenchman for its 'inventor' thirty or forty years before it was worked
out by Torrens in South Australia. It may be so; but Torrens certainly
derived his idea from his experience among shipping, as explained
above, not from any book or outside suggestion.</p>

<p>In the last quarter of the nineteenth century labour questions began
to assume an importance which they had not previously had, though there
was as yet no sign of the growth of a distinct Labour Party in
Australian politics. The trade unions, in the beginning, were simply
industrial organizations, modelled on the lines of English societies of
the same kind; and, as far as concerns their purely industrial
functions, they have retained their original character. The earliest
record of a combination of workmen to raise wages occurred in 1837,
when a meeting of ship owners in Sydney was held to consider the demand
made by seamen and labourers usually employed in the outfit of vessels
that their wage should be raised from 3s. to 4s. per day. The demand
was resisted because it 'did not arise from scarcity of seamen or
labourers, nor from inadequacy of wages hitherto paid,' but from
'combination on the part of the men, which they believe they can carry
into effect at this important and busy season of the year.'</p>

<p>But there is no clear evidence of the existence of organized trade
unions before the beginning of the goldfields era. There was a Masons'
Society in Melbourne in 1850, but whether it was a true trade union is
not clear. In 1855, however, there were certainly unions of stonemasons
both in Sydney and Melbourne, and they adopted from a kindred society
in the same trade in Otago, New Zealand, the idea of agitating for an
eight-hours working day. The eight-hours day, like trade unionism
itself, and like the political projects of the Chartists, was an
English working-class ideal. It was adopted in nearly all trades in
which there were trade unions. After 1879 there were several trade
union congresses; and the fact that the first gathering of the kind
took place several years before the first inter-colonial conference of
politicians on any question of public interest is noteworthy.</p>

<p>The object of these congresses was primarily to consider matters of
concern to trade unions; but there were also manifestations of
political tendency. Thus the congress of 1884 passed a resolution
strongly favouring the payment of members of Parliament in those
colonies where the system did not yet prevail, and one reason given for
it was that it would enable the working class 'to get proper men to
represent them, men who understood and knew how to advocate their
wants.'</p>

<p>But the idea of working class representation was far other than that
of forming a distinct Labour Party. The unionists of the congresses
hoped at most to return a sufficient number of members of Parliament
for electorates in which there were working class majorities, to
influence legislation on advanced liberal lines. It was not till after
1890 that labour groups began to appear as distinct political factors,
and not till after the establishment of the Commonwealth that they were
serious competitors for power in the political arena.</p>

<p>The year 1890 was the pivot of the movement. A great maritime strike
occurred in that year. A steamship captain dismissed a fireman who was
a member of the Seamen's Union. The union took up the man's cause, and
a strike commenced. At about the same time a society of ships'
officers, having been unable to secure an increase of pay, and
observing that trade union methods were generally more successful than
their own had been, took steps to affiliate with the Trades Hall
Council of Melbourne. To this the ship owners strongly objected. They
required that the officers' society should renounce the connection
before consideration was given to their rates of pay. But the society
objected to its freedom to join with others being interfered with, and
refused. A strike of officers ensued; and the seamen, firemen, and
wharf-labourers decided to support them by striking also; so that the
whole shipping trade was paralysed.</p>

<p>The dispute rapidly spread to other trades, for the unionists
believed themselves to be face to face with an endeavour on the part of
the employers to crush the unions from which they derived protection. A
general unrest affected organized labour throughout Australia.</p>

<p>The Shearers' Union went on strike at the very time when the fleeces
were ready to be cut. The issue was joined between organized labour and
combined capital--between workmen who would only negotiate through
their unions and objected to work with non-unionists, and employers who
maintained their right to employ 'free labour.'</p>

<p>The maritime strike lasted three months, and was a cause of intense
bitterness. It ended when the workmen had nearly exhausted their funds
and saw their unions brought to the verge of bankruptcy. For they were
fighting a very wealthy combination of employers, who were determined,
as some of their spokesmen said, to 'break Trades Hall domination.' But
the failure of 1890 changed the character of Australian unionism, and,
ultimately, of Australian politics. The union leaders now began to
preach the necessity for political aggression. The fight must be
transferred to the legislative chambers. Parliamentary action must
achieve what strikes had failed to win.</p>

<p>The Labour Party from this period became an aggressive political
organization with independent aims. As long as its elected
representatives were not strong enough to stand alone, they threw their
weight into the scale in favour of policies as nearly in conformity
with their own ideals as they could induce other parties to propose.
Sometimes they managed to count almost as many votes as either of the
two other parties, and then they supported the one which would make
most concessions to them. In only one colony did a Labour Government
hoist itself into being before Federation, namely, in Queensland, where
in 1899 Anderson Dawson, the labour leader in the Legislative Assembly,
formed a Ministry which endured only a few days. But since 1900 there
have been several Labour Governments in the Commonwealth, and in every
State.</p>

<p>The growth of manufacturing industries naturally brought into
existence a number of laws regulating factories. Much attention was
directed to legal methods of settling disputes between employers and
workmen. The Victorian Wages Board system did not, however, originate
from a desire to prevent strikes, though it has been used for that
purpose, but as a means of suppressing 'sweating' in certain
industries. Under cover of protective duties trades had sprung up in
which there was fierce competition to supply a very limited market, and
the inquiries of a Commission showed that the remuneration of labour in
them was miserably low. In 1896, therefore, Alexander Peacock, the
minister responsible for factory inspection in the Ministry of Sir
George Turner, devised the plan of giving power to the Government to
appoint a wages board for any industry in which it appeared desirable
that wages should be fixed by such an agency. A Wages Board consisted
of an equal number of members representing employers and employed--'a
jury of trade experts'--presided over by a chairman who was not
interested in the industry affected. It might fix wages, hours of
labour, and piecework rates, and lay down rules for the conduct of the
industry; and its determinations had the force of law. The system
proved successful in the 'sweated' industries, and has since been
greatly extended; so that in 1939 there were 194 Wages Boards operating
in Victoria. These boards regulated wages and conditions for over
250,000 employees. The alternative to the Wages Board method of
regulating wages and conditions of labour is the Arbitration Court
method, which has been preferred by some States. These methods have
been adopted since the rise of the Labour Party as a political
force.</p>

<p>Education in Australia virtually has no history till after
constitutional government was inaugurated. There were of course schools
before then, and there were inquiries and experiments, but no real
educational policy. The convict schoolmaster was at first in charge.
His advertisements may be read in early Sydney newspapers: an excellent
education offered at moderate fees; classics extra! Robert Lowe
directed attention to the need for an improvement in 1844, when a
committee under his presidency reported that more than half the
children in New South Wales received no education whatever. The
establishment of a Board of National Education in 1848 brought about a
substantial improvement. But it was Henry Parkes, by his Public Schools
Act of 1867, who set in operation the system which continued to satisfy
the demands of the country till recent times, when fresh impulses were
given to educational effort by a radical improvement of method, a
clearer perception of aim, and a sounder system for training
teachers.</p>

<p>The strenuous souls who fought for protection, land reform, the
ballot, and manhood suffrage in the stormy years after 1855, had an
educational ideal likewise. The educational system of the State must be
'free, compulsory, and secular.' In Victoria their policy was embodied
in a bill introduced by Wilberforce Stephen in 1872. It set up a
Department of Public Instruction, it made school attendance obligatory,
it provided for opening schools throughout the country, and it
prohibited teachers from giving other than secular instruction to the
scholars. The Act, which came into force in 1873, has had many
assailants, and the educational system of Victoria has in later years
been very greatly improved, but fundamentally it remains as it was
established under Wilberforce Stephen's measure. In all the Australian
States there is provided a possibility of continuous education for the
studious youth from the State school to the University.</p>

<p>Not the least of good reasons for holding the name of Wentworth in
remembrance is that he was the initiator of the movement for the
founding of the first Australian University, that of Sydney. He brought
the subject before the Legislative Council in 1849, and three years
later had the satisfaction to witness the opening of the institution.
The University of Melbourne (1853) came into being owing to the
suggestion of Childers, whose first official post was that of Inspector
of Schools, and whose work in that capacity convinced him that the
corner-stone of any scheme for raising the standard of learning in the
country must be a University. Latrobe, the Lieutenant-Governor, gave
his cordial support, and when the scheme reached fruition the first
Chancellor, Redmond Barry, watched over the early fortunes of the
University of Melbourne with paternal devotion. The University of
Adelaide (1874) was the third to arise, that of Tasmania (1890) the
fourth. The Universities of Queensland (1910) and Western Australia
(1911) were the latest-born seats of the higher learning to be founded.
All of them admit women to their degrees, following the example set by
Melbourne, which took this step at the instance of the distinguished
historian Charles Henry Pearson. In 1879, Pearson, while Minister of
Education in Victoria, introduced a bill which provided that the
degrees and diplomas granted by the University should be available to
both sexes. As the bill did not pass in that year, owing to pressure of
parliamentary business, the Council of the University forthwith decided
to admit women to degree courses. Pearson's bill was introduced again
in 1880 in order to remove any doubt as to the legality of the
University's action, and was passed by the legislature. Legislation for
a similar purpose was passed in respect to the University of Adelaide
in 1880.</p>

<p>All the Universities are supported by Government grants, and some of
them have also benefited from generous gifts by wealthy citizens. The
Challis bequest gave Sydney an endowment of over a quarter of a million
pounds, and the Russell bequest added an additional hundred thousand
pounds to the funds. Sydney University also received 258,000 pounds
from the G. H. Bosch Fund, and 42,000 pounds from the Fisher Estate. In
addition it also receives a large annual revenue from the McCaughey
bequest, while the University of Queensland received over 190,000
pounds from the same source down to 1940. The University of Queensland
also received a gift of land valued at 62,000 pounds from the Mayne
family, part of which is to provide a site for the new University
buildings. The largest single benefaction, however, received by any
Australian University was the bequest of 425,000 pounds to the
University of Western Australia from Sir Winthrop Hackett; this
University also received 60,000 pounds from the Gledden estate. The
University of Adelaide has also had many generous benefactors, the
chief being Sir Thomas Elder (100,000 pounds), Peter Waite (100,000
pounds), Sir Langdon Bonython (71,000 pounds) and Miss M. T. Murray
(45,000 pounds), along with a number of other substantial endowments.
The chief benefactions received by the University of Melbourne have
been 60,000 pounds from Sidney Myer, 41,000 pounds from Sir Samuel
Gillott, and 40,000 pounds from Helen Mackie, but there have been a
number of other important bequests. The teaching functions have been
aided by these and other endowments, and research has been promoted not
only by the encouragement of prizes, but also under the inspiration of
men whose contributions to knowledge have won for themselves
distinction and for their Universities honour throughout the world of
culture. The early student of Melbourne who listened to the lectures of
Hearn on constitutional history sat at the feet of a master whose work
was incomparably excellent in its day and is still important. A Sydney
student in later times might pursue his work in geology under the
direction of the discoverer of the south magnetic pole, Edgeworth
David; and a Melbourne student of biology might learn more than his
text-books could tell him from one whose original researches have
revolutionized a branch of anthropology, Baldwin Spencer. The
development of scientific research, and the application of science to
the problems of agriculture, industry and every-day life, has been
greatly helped through the setting up of the Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research (the C.S.I.R.) by the Commonwealth Government in
1926. Already the C.S.I.R. has done most valuable work in solving
practical problems, and in promoting the economic development of
Australia. It employs hundreds of scientists and has an annual budget
running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p>

<p>Australia is an offshoot of Europe, and its culture is European;
but, in comparison with North America, which is in the like case, it
labours under the disadvantage of being remote from the source. During
the first half century of settlement the sea voyage generally occupied
four months, or longer if unfavourable winds were encountered; and the
discovery of a route which greatly shortened the time did not occur
until the steamship was on the point of displacing the sailing vessel
in the passenger traffic. It was in the forties of the nineteenth
century that the American naval lieutenant, M. F. Maury, conducted his
important scientific researches into the courses of winds and currents,
and showed that if captains of ships outward bound from England to
Australia, instead of running across the Indian Ocean from the Cape of
Good Hope almost in a direct line, would dip down into the latitude of
48 degrees south, they would invariably meet with strong westerly winds
and long rolling seas which would carry them forward very rapidly. By
following his route, sailing ships made astonishingly quick runs. The
JAMES BAINES in 1854 ran from Liverpool to Melbourne in sixty-three
days and returned by way of Cape Horn to Liverpool in sixty-nine days,
making the circuit of the globe in one hundred and thirty-two days. The
MARCO POLO and other clipper ships famous in their day cut down the old
sailing time by one-half. But mariners had only discovered how much
more dependable the winds might be than their predecessors had
supposed, when steam began to enable their services to be dispensed
with. In 1856 the Peninsula and Oriental Company commenced to trade
with Australia, and in later years the Australian has come to think
himself imperfectly served if he is not able to read in Adelaide or
Sydney letters posted in England a month before. In 1934 the
development of aviation made it possible for letters to travel from
London to Australia in a week. In that year the Commonwealth Government
subsidised Qantas Empire Airways to carry mails, freight and passengers
from Singapore to Brisbane, thus linking up with the Empire Airways
service from London to Singapore. In addition, since 1920 the
Commonwealth has also subsidised many air services within Australia
itself. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 shortened the sea voyage
between Australia and England, and the increased traffic led naturally
to improvements in the quality as well as the speed of the service.
When the Panama Canal was opened in 1914 it also gave a shorter
sea-route to the West Indies and the east coast of North America. It
made the sea-voyage from the east coast of Australia to New York
shorter than the voyage to London.</p>

<p>The submarine cable has still more closely linked up this out-lying
continent with Great Britain. There had been cable communication
between London and the East for some years before the system was
extended to Australia. In those days there was little co-operation
between the colonies. Particularist lines of policy were pursued by
each of them. The cable ought to have been a joint concern; but,
failing that, the South Australian Government had the enterprise to
step forward and do the necessary connecting work. She had in her
service a skilful electrician in Charles Todd, who superintended the
construction of an overland telegraph line 1,970 miles in length,
following McDouall Stuart's track through the centre of Australia to
Port Darwin. There it was connected with a deep-sea cable laid by an
English company between Port Darwin and Java. The opening of this line
in 1871 placed Australia and London within a few hours' communication.
In 1902 another cable route was completed, linking up Brisbane with
Vancouver across the Pacific. This line is the joint property of the
Governments of Australia, Great Britain, Canada, and New Zealand. The
development of wireless telegraphy led to further improvement and
cheapening of overseas communications when the beam wireless service
was started in Australia in 1927. In 1928 the Imperial cable and beam
wireless services were brought under a single control, and are now
managed by Cable and Wireless Ltd. In addition, an overseas wireless
telephone service was introduced in 1930, whereby people in this
country can speak to people overseas by telephone. Another important
improvement in communications since 1923 has been the development of
wireless broadcasting, which has enabled people in remote places to
receive news and other services just as rapidly as those in closely
settled areas and towns. Not only can people listen to programmes
provided in their own countries, but overseas programmes from England
and America can be relayed to Australian listeners. The number of
listeners' licenses issued in Australia rose from 37,000 in 1924 to
1,130,000 in 1939.</p>

<p>The lack of co-operation between colonies which for too many years
regarded each other as rivals instead of partners in the development of
a great heritage had an unfortunate consequence in the era of railway
construction. Efforts were made to arrive at an agreement to build to a
common gauge, but they failed. Gladstone, while Colonial Secretary in
1846, recommended the adoption of a 4 ft. 8 1/2 in. gauge, but that was
four years before the first line from Sydney to Goulburn was
constructed. There was no railway in Victoria till after the gold
diggings began, the first length having been from Melbourne to the Port
(Hobson's Bay) in 1854. The first lines were owned by companies, but
all the colonies afterwards determined to make railway building and
railway policy state concerns.</p>

<p>In 1852 New South Wales appointed an Irish engineer-in-chief, who
had been accustomed to the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge in Ireland, and who
persuaded the Government to adopt that gauge, despite the advice of the
Colonial Secretary. Victoria and South Australia, desiring to build to
the same gauge as the principal colony, decided to follow suit, and
both commenced to construct 5 ft. 3 in. railways. But meanwhile New
South Wales appointed a new engineer-in-chief, a Scotsman, who was an
intense partisan of the standard, or 4 ft. 8 1/2 in. gauge, and he
'left no stone unturned to bring New South Wales back to her first
love, regardless of keeping faith with the other colonies, whose
railways were now progressing with comparative rapidity, and who had
already reversed their policy once in order to keep in line with New
South Wales.' The Scotch engineer won his way, the 1852 Act was
repealed in 1855, and 'the most lamentable engineering disaster in
Australia was an accomplished fact.' (Professor W. C. Kernot, in
<i>Proceedings</i> of Victorian Institute of Engineers, vol. vii, p.
73.)</p>

<p>The result was that traffic has ever since been incommoded and trade
made costlier by a break of gauge at the border between the two States.
The Commonwealth line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie (1,051 miles) was
opened in 1917, completing a chain of lines from east to west. By 1939
there were 28,000 miles of railway in the country, but there had been
little new railway construction since 1929. The falling off in railway
construction since about 1920 has been due, of course, to the growth of
motor traffic, and the development of air services. In every state a
central board has undertaken the building and upkeep of main roads, and
since 1922 this work has been subsidised by the Commonwealth
Government. The growth of motor traffic is shown by the increase in the
number of motor vehicles registered from 239,000 in 1924 to 900,000 in
1939. The development of air-traffic has been equally arresting;
between 1924 and 1939 the number of passengers carried during the year
increased from less than 5,000 to nearly 150,000, mails from 175,000
lbs. to 740,000 lbs., and goods from 8,500 lbs. to 1,735,000 lbs. As a
result of this competition the railway departments found it harder to
meet all their expenses, but they were also stimulated to improve their
services.</p>

<p>An ever-increasing variety in the industries of Australia has
enlarged the possibilities of life for her people; and improvements in
agricultural methods have made country work easier and more pleasant.
Much of the rough, heartbreaking pioneer labour has been done; not all
by any means, but aids and agencies are available to the enterprising
man of the twentieth century which were not within the reach of his
forbears half a century ago. He is helped and encouraged by the State,
which is the whole community of which he is a member. Every country has
its own peculiar problems to solve, and Australia has presented many
tough difficulties. They have been attacked with the energy and the
adaptability which have been the outstanding qualities of the
Anglo-Saxon colonizing genius; and the crowning result of democratic
government in these circumstances has been the creation for the country
of the passionate attachment of an intelligent and virile people.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV - PAPUA AND THE PACIFIC</h3>

<blockquote><b>A 'Monroe doctrine' for the Pacific--French annexation
of New Caledonia--The New Hebrides--New Guinea--Captain Morseby's
discoveries-- The colonies and New Guinea--Queensland's awakened
interest--Gold discoveries--German intentions--McIlwraith orders
annexation of New Guinea--Action disavowed by British
Government--Strong feeling in Australia--German annexations--Lord
Granville's surprise--Kanaka labour--'Blackbirding'--Queensland

<p>Prevost-Paradol, a French author who wrote an excellent book on the
colonies of his country in 1868, predicted that 'some day a new Monroe
Doctrine would prevent old Europe, in the name of the United States of
Australia, from setting foot upon a single isle of the Pacific.' A
policy so exclusive has never been promulgated, though a convention of
all the Australian colonies which met at Sydney in 1883 did enter its
protest against any foreign power being permitted to acquire fresh
territory in the Pacific south of the Equator. But until the
achievement of federation the people of Australia were too much
immersed in their own particularist affairs to pay attention to, or
even to take the trouble to understand, what their future interests
might be in the many groups of islands powdered over the face of the
Pacific. Only a suddenly stimulated sense of danger warned them, almost
at the last moment, to reach out a hand towards New Guinea, lying close
to their doors; and their concern for other parts of the Pacific has
only been aroused when they have been awakened to its imminence by some
striking circumstance.</p>

<p>The transportation of French prisoners to New Caledonia, and their
occasional escape to Brisbane and Sydney, afforded such an instance.
France annexed the island in 1853, and ten years later determined to
use it as a penal settlement. After the Parisian insurrections of 1871,
following the Franco-Prussian War and the anarchy of the Commune,
between three and four thousand political prisoners were sent to this
convict colony. They included journalists, professors, artists,
artisans, and a varied assortment of common rascals. The most famous of
the better sort was the intrepid political writer, Henri Rochefort. The
Australian colonies became uneasy about the establishment so near to
their shores of a foreign imitation of the system which they themselves
had happily cast off, and their anxiety increased when escapees and
time-expired convicts began to find their way to the eastern seaboard
of the continent. The police of New South Wales, Victoria, and
Queensland reported that between 1874 and 1883, at least 247 escaped
prisoners and 'expirees' were known to have landed in Australia. The
Imperial Government made polite representations to the French Republic,
explaining that Australia thought the transportation system vexing and
its continuance in New Caledonia rather unneighbourly. The French
Government, moreover, was finding that by making New Caledonia a jail
it was retarding the development of the great natural resources of the
island. It therefore determined to discontinue the practice, and after
1898 convictism was abandoned. Up to that date 15,000 prisoners had
been transported to New Caledonia.</p>

<p>The British and French joint occupation of the New Hebrides presents
a more complicated problem. A French company commenced to buy land in
this group of islands in 1882, and organized a regular trading service
between them and Noumea, the chief town in New Caledonia. For some
years previously the Presbyterian Church had been conducting missions
to the Pacific Islanders, and the missionaries, who were strongly
posted in the New Hebrides, knew all that was happening. They spread
the alarm among the churches of their denomination in Australia. The
Presbyterians, being a numerous and influential body, were able to
bring political pressure to bear, through the Governments of the
colonies, upon the British Foreign Office, which intimated to the
French Government that the annexation of the New Hebrides, if that step
were contemplated, would certainly give offence in Australia. France
gave an undertaking not to annex the islands, and in 1887 a convention
was signed between the two Governments by which the New Hebrides were
placed under a joint British and French commission of naval officers.
This system of government is called the Anglo-French Condominium.</p>

<p>The Convention of 1887 was modified by a more detailed and elaborate
convention in 1906, providing a scheme of government for the New
Hebrides. It described them as 'a region of joint influence,' in which
the subjects of Great Britain and France enjoy equal rights of
residence, personal protection, and trade, each retaining jurisdiction
over its own subjects 'and neither exercising a separate control over
the group.' A British and a French Resident Commissioner were stationed
at Vila, in the island of Efate. The joint Naval Commission was also
continued, its functions being mainly to maintain order. This somewhat
awkward arrangement cannot be said to be satisfactory or to make for
just and wholesome government.</p>

<p>To the north of Australia, separated from it by Torres Strait, lies
the great island which the Portuguese called Papua, because of the
frizzled hair of the natives. The Dutch, who formed small settlements
on the north-west coast, adopted the Spanish name of New Guinea, by
which it was more generally known. With the exception of Australia
itself, Papua is the largest island in the world, having an area
exceeding three hundred thousand square miles. It was inevitable that
the Australian people should concern themselves about the ownership of
a territory so near to their own country. Occupied by tribes of black
warriors to whom its rich soil afforded an abundant sustenance without
requiring strenuous labour from them, it had never been explored for
its mineral resources nor used for tropical agriculture, except for
native gardens. The navigators of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries had often cruised along its shores. Dampier had named the
promontory on the north-western extremity King William's Cape, 'in
honour of his present majesty William III.' Torres, Cook, Bligh,
Flinders and others had threaded the intricacies of the channels
between the coral reefs of the strait. The shape of the island upon the
map was defined with a fair approach to accuracy, and it was known to
be the home of birds of gorgeous plumage, but hardly anything had been
ascertained about the interior. Some day the attention of adventurers
was bound to be directed to it. In any case, it was obviously not to
the interest of Australia that a foreign power should be established
there.</p>

<p>Yet Australian politicians were very slow to appreciate the
importance of Papua. If in the years when the separate affairs of the
colonies were absorbing attention and so little thought was devoted to
the deeper interests of Australia as a whole, some of them had spent
half an hour upon the study of the map, and had given a little
consideration to the future, the whole of the island not already in
Dutch hands might have been secured without much trouble. In later
years newspapers and public men were wont to blame the British
Government for its remissness; and, truly, that Government had been
tardy, and had allowed itself to be deceived by German diplomacy. But a
study of the official papers shows that the colonies themselves were
also at fault.</p>

<p>Theoretically, the eastern peninsula of Papua had been British
territory since 1846, when Lieutenant Yule of H.M.S. BRAMBLE landed at
Cape Possession, in the Gulf of Papua, and hoisted the Union Jack. But
it is not clear that he acted under formal orders to declare British
sovereignty, or that his act had more validity than had those of two
East India merchantmen who 'took possession of New Guinea and other
islands of Torres Strait,' in 1793. The Admiralty, in a memorandum over
twenty years later than Yule's action, expressed a doubt as to whether
the territory was more than nominally British.</p>

<p>Not until 1867 did any body of persons in Australia turn towards
Papua as a field for development. In that year a small New Guinea
Company was formed in Sydney. It applied to the Government of New South
Wales for assistance. That Government was not prepared to grant any,
but forwarded a memorandum to the Imperial Government urging the
annexation of New Guinea as 'a matter of the highest importance to the
Australian colonies.' Lord Derby's Ministry, which was then in power,
was icily unsympathetic. It refused to give any plan of voluntary
settlement the sanction of Imperial authority, nor would it undertake
to confirm any titles to the acquisition of land which persons who
embarked in such a venture might profess to take from the natives. The
Sydney Company thereupon dropped the venture.</p>

<p>A party of adventurous young men who set out from Sydney in 1872 to
explore Papua with a view to settlement came to misfortune by shipwreck
and murder by blacks. Thus a bad beginning had been made. A failure, a
disaster, and the official frown of Downing Street marked the first
phase.</p>

<p>The discoveries of Captain Moresby in H.M.S. BASILISK (1873) opened
the next phase. He discovered a magnificent landlocked harbour on the
south coast, and on landing formed a very high opinion of the fertility
of the soil. So he hoisted the British flag, and took possession of
eastern Papua pending the decision of the Government. The ceremony of
taking possession had been performed so often by this time that it must
have seemed like an entertainment got up for the amusement of the
natives.</p>

<p>The importance of Moresby's discoveries was pressed upon the
Imperial Government, which inquired of the Australian colonies what
their views were. This afforded an opportunity to Australia to express
a strong and united demand that steps should forthwith be taken to
prevent any foreign power from acquiring rights in Papua. A new
administration, that of Disraeli, had just come into office in Great
Britain, with Lord Carnarvon as Colonial Secretary, and, had there been
a clear intimation of what was wanted, there was nothing to prevent the
annexation of the whole of Papua except the western portion, where the
Dutch were. But the Imperial Government found that some of the colonies
were lukewarm, whilst others were opposed to assuming any
responsibility. It happened that, a short while previously, Lord Derby
had made a speech in which he had expressed the opinion that 'Great
Britain had already black subjects enough.' People are apt to be caught
by phrases, and this one ran through a large number of speeches and
leading articles. Thus, Governor Bowen reported from Victoria that
there were few thinking men in that colony who did not 'agree with the
principle that, as a rule liable to exceptions in particular cases,
Great Britain has already black subjects enough.'</p>

<p>Even Queensland, which a little later was to manifest a passionate
interest in Papua, reported on this occasion, through Governor Cairns,
that 'but little interest is taken as yet in the destiny of New Guinea
by either the Ministry or the outside public of that colony.'</p>

<p>The only Australian statesman who at this date (1874) showed any
sense of the importance of the question was Henry Parkes, then Premier
of New South Wales. He wrote an emphatic memorandum pointing out that
the colonization of Papua by a foreign power would give rise to many
embarrassments, whilst its colonization by Great Britain would be
hailed with universal approbation. But Governor Robinson, in forwarding
Parkes's memorandum to London, threw cold water over its argument, and
suggested doubts as to whether there was any serious public opinion on
the subject. It was, at all events, clear that there was no disposition
on the part of the Australian Governments to share the cost of
administering the country if it were annexed by Great Britain, and, as
the Imperial Government saw no reason for imposing the cost on the
British taxpayer, there seemed no more to be said. So ended the second
phase.</p>

<p>The third opened in 1875, when Queensland awoke to the fact that the
contiguity of Papua to her territory, gave her a special interest in
its future. The Queensland Parliament passed resolutions urging
annexation upon the Imperial Government. But the other colonies refused
to join in bearing the cost of administration, notwithstanding that a
rumour had gained currency that Germany was thinking of planting her
flag in the Pacific. Lord Carnarvon, when this fear was brought under
his notice, brushed it aside as unworthy of credence. 'The German
Government has, I am informed,' wrote the Secretary of State, 'very
lately intimated that it has no intention of acquiring colonies, and
this intimation has special reference to New Guinea.' The sequel to the
story shows how ill-informed the Foreign Office was as to Germany's
designs.</p>

<p>But at the same time Lord Carnarvon promised that the Imperial
Government would move as desired if the Australian colonies would pay
the expense of governing the territory annexed; and Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach, who succeeded him at the Colonial Office, plainly laid
down the principle 'that the Australian colonies must bear the cost of
an enterprise in which this country is not directly concerned, except
in so far as it is of interest and importance to those colonies.'</p>

<p>In 1878 gold was discovered in Southern Papua, and the incursion of
a fairly large number of miners made it necessary to take steps to
maintain order among them. The task was placed under the direction of
the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, an office established in
1875 with headquarters at Fiji. The Commissioner, Sir Arthur Gordon,
pointed out how difficult it was for him to exert authority whilst the
country was not under British sovereignty. If an English digger were
murdered by an American or a German, the High Commissioner's Court
would be unable to exercise jurisdiction. The offender would have to be
left to lynch law, which would certainly be exercised in a mining camp
where there was no legitimate authority. But even when this view was
laid before the Colonial Secretary he declined to act. If the
Australians wanted Papua they must pay for governing it. From that
principle the Imperial Government would not depart.</p>

<p>The fourth phase opened in 1882, with a renewal of reports of German
intentions. Lord Derby was then Colonial Secretary, and he scouted the
suggestion in similar terms to those which Carnarvon had used. There
was 'no reason for supposing' that the German Government contemplated
such action. But Sir Thomas McIlwraith, the Queensland Premier,
believed that he had better information than the Imperial Government
possessed. He was satisfied that Germany was about to act, despite the
denials given to the British Foreign Office by Berlin. The case was so
urgent that he could not afford to parley about terms. So McIlwraith
cabled to London in February 1883: 'Queensland will bear expense of
government and take formal possession on receipt of Imperial authority
by cable.' But Lord Derby--still haunted by the nightmare of too many
black men--now disregarded his predecessor's principle, ignored the
resolutions of the Queensland Parliament, and flatly refused his
sanction unless he were assured 'that public opinion in the colony
would approve of the annexation,' and that 'the Legislature would adopt
the necessary resolutions.' He replied to that effect by letter, not by
the more expeditious medium of the cable, in March.</p>

<p>McIlwraith was, however, a man of energetic resolution, and, knowing
what German agents in the Pacific were doing, he considered that the
matter was too pressing to be any longer strung out by the leisurely
method of official correspondence. One morning in April, when the
Colonial Secretary opened his newspaper, he found there, to his great
astonishment, a telegram informing the world that the Queensland
Government had taken possession of New Guinea. When Lord Derby
recovered his breath he cabled to the Governor, 'Please telegraph
explanation.'</p>

<p>What had happened was that McIlwraith had sent instructions to
Chester, the police magistrate at Thursday Island, to take possession
of 'so much of the island as was not already in the occupation or
possession of the Dutch.' Chester executed his mission on April 4. The
Queensland Government, McIlwraith informed Derby, had acted 'under the
full belief that the matter was too urgent to admit of the delay
necessarily involved in waiting for instructions from the Imperial
Government.' From information 'obtained from various sources,' he also
said, 'there appeared to be every probability of the island being taken
possession of by a foreign power.'</p>

<p>Lord Derby was angry, and repudiated McIlwraith's action. He refused
to recognize the annexation. It was unauthorised, and therefore
invalid. He wrote in the most positive terms that 'the apprehension
entertained in Australia that some foreign power was about to establish
itself on the shores of New Guinea appears to have been altogether
indefinite and unfounded, and the inquiries which have been made by Her
Majesty's Government have given them the strongest reasons for
believing that no such step has been contemplated.' Before many more
months had passed Lord Derby was left in no doubt that the Premier of
Queensland had accurately gauged the situation all along, and that the
German Chancellor, Bismarck, had completely hoodwinked the agents of
the British Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Australian colonies had unanimously rallied to
McIlwraith's support. His prompt action was applauded throughout the
country, and the six Governments undertook to share with Queensland the
cost of administering Papua. Lord Derby had these expressions of
opinion brought before him repeatedly during the remainder of 1883 and
the early part of 1884, but still he would not ratify what had been
done. He felt safe in holding back because in June 1883 he had inquired
of the Foreign Office whether the Government could 'rely with
confidence' on the absence of interference by any foreign power, and
the Foreign Secretary, Lord Granville, had replied (June 26) that he
had 'reason to believe that no such action is intended on the part of
any foreign power.' Granville also--himself a model of polished and
trustful politeness--was soon to discover how the blue-eyed German had
looked him in the face and sworn to the thing that was not.</p>

<p>In 1884 the German Ambassador to Great Britain, Count Munster, began
openly to reveal an interest in the Pacific. He informed Lord Granville
that the German Government was of opinion that the wild country on the
north side of Papua might be available as a field for German
enterprise. Now, at this very time (August 1884), under the persistent
pressure of the Australian colonies, the British Cabinet had just
decided to proclaim a protectorate over the whole island except the
part occupied by the Dutch. But they had not yet taken definite action
to that end, and the Germans were much better informed about British
intentions than British statesmen had been about those of the Germans.
Count Munster intervened at the opportune moment; with the result that,
as stated in Lord Granville's biography by Lord Fitzmaurice (vol. ii,
p. 371), 'the decisions of the Cabinet were not carried out in their
entirety.' The ship which was to have conveyed the British officer to
make the annexation was delayed, while the Under-Secretary for the
Colonies was sent to Berlin to confer with Prince Bismarck, the German
Government having intimated through the Ambassador that there ought to
be 'a friendly understanding by means of a Commission.'</p>

<p>But while the conference in Berlin was actually in progress--a
conference suggested by Germany professedly with a view of arriving at
a 'friendly understanding,' but really, as will presently appear, for
the purpose of enabling Bismarck to make a COUP--while the British
representative, sent over in good faith, was conversing with the German
Chancellor--a German ship was speeding full steam to Papua and had
annexed the north part and several of the adjacent islands before the
British Foreign Secretary knew that anything definite had been
determined upon. 'I think the German Government have behaved very
shabbily by you,' wrote the Under-Secretary to Granville, who had,
indeed, in the innocence of his heart, been utterly deceived. He
protested in his most gentlemanly manner: 'Her Majesty's Government
were quite unprepared for such an announcement.' Bismarck knew that;
but his deep bass chuckle could not be heard in London.</p>

<p>The Australian colonies were very sore, considering that their
interests had been sacrificed, but they could do no more than protest.
They had to be content with the annexation of the southern portion of
the island, which was effected by Commodore Erskine in October 1884.
From that date until the Commonwealth came into being the
administration of British New Guinea was carried on by Queensland, at
the joint expense of the six colonies.</p>

<p>Samoa was also annexed by Germany in 1884. Fiji had become a British
possession ten years before (October 1874).</p>

<p>However much Lord Derby, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, and Lord Granville
may be blamed for letting northern New Guinea slip through their
fingers, the historical facts make it clear that the lack of
co-operation among the Australian colonies at an earlier period was
really responsible for the mischance. Closely absorbed in their local
affairs, they did not look beyond their own boundaries. Parkes had a
wider vision, but he stood almost alone. It should, however, in justice
to the colonies be remembered that they were young communities whose
work of development made large demands upon their resources and
energies. The wise and generous policy of the mother country would have
been not to haggle about terms, but to annex as requested, trusting to
the Australian Governments to assume full responsibility. The trust
would not have been misplaced.</p>

<p>Another problem of the Pacific arose out of the importation of South
Sea islanders, or Kanakas, to work in the sugar-cane fields of
Queensland. The word 'Kanaka' is the Polynesian word for 'man'--though
the islanders pronounce it with the accent on the first syllable,
whereas in Australia the second syllable is stressed. Rudyard Kipling
used it correctly when in the original version of his poem, 'The Lost
Legion' (1883), he wrote:</p>

<pre>
We've shouted on seven-ounce nuggets,
We've starved on a Kanaka's pay.

</pre>

<p>But some one assured him that the second line would not scan
according to Australian pronunciation, and he altered the line (1896)
to 'We've starved on a seedeboy's pay.'</p>

<p>Kanakas had been introduced to Queensland for work in the
cane-fields very early in the history of tropical agriculture in that
State. There was a serious dearth of labour, without which it was
impossible to make industries successful. The idea of utilizing Kanaka
labour occurred to Robert Towns, an English sailor who settled in
Sydney in 1842 and started to develop what became a very profitable
trade with the islands of the Pacific. Towns, an eminently enterprising
man, was fond of experimenting. He started a cotton plantation, and
became interested in a number of station properties in northern
Queensland. It was for cotton-growing that he originally imported two
or three hundred Kanakas, and when he had found their labour to be
useful and profitable, other growers of tropical products followed his
example.</p>

<p>The islanders were recruited by owners of luggers, who professed to
enter into contracts with them by which they were to serve for a term
of years in the Queensland plantations, and were to be returned safely
to their islands at the end of the period. But the natives of different
islands spoke different languages, and the only common medium of speech
was a pidgin English, which only a comparatively few of them
understood. What they were contracting to do was very rarely realized.
The 'contracts,' indeed, were but a device to obscure the real nature
of this traffic in human flesh and blood, which, as practised in the
fifties and sixties, was nothing better than a disguised form of
slavery. Kidnapping, or 'blackbirding,' as it was popularly called, had
very little respect for law, humanity, or the natural rights of the
islanders. J. G. Paton, one of the best-known missionaries who worked
in the islands, declared that 'many of the natives are taken away
fraudulently and by force from their native lands.' The natives
themselves called it, in their own speech, 'man-stealing.' Strong young
men were lured on board the luggers, or carried off by superior force,
not infrequently after the use of firearms, and, if they were ever
returned to their islands at all, it was as experts in vices which they
had acquired upon the plantations. Sometimes they were paid for their
labour only in trumperies. Thus, in one certified instance, a Kanaka,
after five months' service on board a vessel, received four
handkerchiefs, some pipes, and a few figs of tobacco.</p>

<p>Grave scandals occurred in connection with the traffic. The
Queensland Government in 1868 legislated to regulate it, but some of
the very bad instances of kidnapping and murder occurred after the
passage of that measure. The piratical exploits of the notorious
'Bully' Hayes, one of the most desperate of the blackbirding skippers,
and of others engaged in the same business, were hardly distinguishable
from the methods adopted by the slave-raiders of the West African coast
in the days when slavery flourished as a lucrative British industry. In
the later years recruiting was conducted under a more stringent system
of supervision by inspectors appointed by the Queensland Government.
Kidnapping ceased, and the Kanakas were paid a minimum of 6 pounds per
annum. They were returned to their islands at the expiration of the
contract period, and were protected while in the service of the
planters. But, as soon as the Labour Party became strong in Queensland
politics, a determined assault was made on the importation of Kanaka
labour, and the gravity of the evils associated with making this a
permanent source of labour supply for the State was appreciated
generally. When Queensland entered the Federation it was quite
understood that the system would be ended, and that the Commonwealth
would make provision for protecting the sugar industry when it was
deprived of labour from this admittedly undesirable source. The action
which the Commonwealth took will be related in Chapter XXVIII.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI - THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS FEDERATION</h3>

<blockquote><b>Lord Grey's proposal--The federal spirit--The Federal
Council--Its limitations--Henry Parkes--Federal Convention of
1891--Defection of New South Wales--Corowa Conference--Convention of
1897-8.</b></blockquote>

<p>When the proposal to confer self-government upon the Australian
colonies was being considered in 1849 the Committee of Trade and
Plantations, to which Earl Grey referred the subject, recommended that,
in addition to the Legislatures established in the various colonies,
the Governor-General should have power to convene a body to be called
the General Assembly of Australia. It was to consist of a single House,
named the House of Delegates, whose members were to be elected, not by
the people but by the Parliaments; and it was to have certain powers
entrusted to it affecting the common interests of all Australia. It was
to take charge of customs and excise, postal business, roads and
railways, lighthouses, weights and measures; it was to set up a general
Supreme Court to act as a court of appeal from colonial courts; and it
was to have power to make laws on any other subject which might be
referred to it by the Parliaments of all the colonies. Not a word was
said about defence; that was to remain an Imperial concern.</p>

<p>Earl Grey adopted this idea, and endeavoured to carry it out in the
measure of self-government which he submitted to the Imperial
Parliament in 1850. But the time was not opportune for a movement
towards federation. Neither in Australia nor in England were the
clauses popular. Grey made no strong fight for them, and they were
struck out by the House of Lords.</p>

<p>There was much that was narrow, unsympathetic, and marked by the
caste-prejudice of the aristocratic Whig in the colonial policy of Earl
Grey, though he wrote two substantial volumes to prove to posterity
what a very enlightened policy it was. Yet in this particular he--or
the committee whose ideas he adopted--showed a true perception of the
inevitable tendencies of Australian politics. Here were five separate
communities--six when Queensland was separated from New South
Wales--all of British origin, all populated principally by British
people, all speaking the same language, all living under similar
systems of government. Were they to grow up as foreign nations, jealous
of each other, pursuing separate and often antagonistic policies? Or
were they to recognize that their place in the sun, their strength in
resistance, their trade, wealth, and general well-being would be
enormously increased if they pooled their powers in certain respects
and presented a united front to the world? Why should not the latter
alternative be chosen? The people of the Australian colonies were not
different from each other, as Frenchmen were different from Germans, or
Russians from Spaniards, or Italians from Swedes. The fact that one
Australian colonist had a sheep run in New South Wales, that another
grew wheat in South Australia, and that another was a miner in
Victoria, made no radical difference in their disposition. The
historical factors which make distinct nationalities were not at work
here. A river boundary or a degree of longitude did not convert people
of common origin into separate nations. It might have worked out so in
the course of two or three centuries, but not in less than one. And
even tendencies in that direction were a misfortune. There were enough
causes of national discord in the old world; there was no need to
introduce them in the new.</p>

<p>But time was required for the federal idea to germinate and grow. It
could not be made to sprout by an Act of Parliament. The Australian
people had to learn for themselves how much they lost by disunion. They
had to become conscious of the weakening effect of particularist aims.
They had to be taught by events that though it was quite a good and an
honourable thing to be a Tasmanian or a Queenslander, it was a very
much finer, prouder thing, and one that signifies very much more, to be
an Australian. Several events impressed the lesson upon their minds.
The slippery Bismarckian trick in New Guinea was one of them.</p>

<p>Questions of common interest frequently arose, and for a few years
it was sought to deal with them by means of inter-colonial conferences.
It occurred to Henry Parkes that there ought to be some permanent
machinery for the purpose; and in 1883, when a cluster of subjects of
urgent importance had to be considered, his suggestion, made two years
previously, for the creation of a Federal Council was put into concrete
shape by Samuel Griffith, the Queensland Premier. A bill to authorise
the establishment of such a Council was passed by the Imperial
Parliament in 1885. It gave power to the six Australian colonies, as
well as New Zealand and Fiji, to pass Acts enabling the colonies to
send two representatives each. Fiji sent her representatives to the
first meeting of the Federal Council, held in 1886, but afterwards
dropped out. New Zealand never participated.</p>

<p>Much graver was the defection of New South Wales. As Parkes first
promulgated the idea of establishing such a Council, his action in
afterwards declining to recommend New South Wales to have anything to
do with it was viewed by others as a breach of faith. Parkes was a
statesman of large views, but he was also, as every successful leader
under a parliamentary system must be, a wily politician with a quick
eye to party advantage and the popularity of a project. The Federal
Council scheme had not won popularity in New South Wales. Parkes
explained that he afterwards came to the conclusion that 'the body
proposed to be created would not succeed,' and that it would 'impede
the way for a sure and solid federation.'</p>

<p>In truth the Federal Council did not impede the achievement of
federation, nor was there any reason why it should. But the abstention
of the oldest and strongest colony certainly impeded the work of the
Council. Its transactions lacked full authority because they were not
those of the representatives of all Australia. Its legislative power
was slight, extending only to a few questions, and even as to these it
had no executive capacity and no authority to raise revenue. It could
legislate on quarantine, or the influx of criminals, but any laws which
it might make could only be carried out by the Governments of the
colonies, by their own machinery and in their own way. The Federal
Council could not order a single policeman to do anything, nor could it
spend a single shilling on anything, nor tax any Australian citizen to
the extent of a penny stamp. Yet its meetings, which occurred every two
years, did call attention to matters of general Australian interest,
its debates were on a high level, and its personnel was always
distinguished.</p>

<p>Parkes, however, genuinely desired to see the federation of
Australia, and when again he set himself to the task he performed noble
work for his country. He was in the last quarter of the nineteenth
century by far the most picturesque and commanding figure in Australian
politics. Very tall and strong-framed, with a great leonine head, maned
and bearded white, resting on massive bowed shoulders, his presence
arrested attention in any gathering; and when he spoke, in a thin
penetrating voice, and with slow, deliberate choice of words, his
tongue was gifted with the power to move multitudes and to convince
while it charmed. His origin was of the humblest. As a lad in his
native Warwickshire, the son of a very poor labourer, he had worked on
a rope-walk for four pence a day, and had groaned under the blows of a
brutal master in a brickyard. He had shivered in threadbare shreds as a
stone-breaker on the highway, and endured the rigours of an immigrant
ship. But always the soul of the man burned bright. In the midst of his
poverty he read and thought and wrote, teaching himself and learning to
love the fine things in literature with a passion that was never dimmed
down to the last days of his very long life. His little book of
IMMIGRANT'S HOME LETTERS reveals the struggles and the aspirations of
his early days in Australia, whither he came in 1839. His political
advancement in New South Wales began with the inauguration of
responsible government, and his career extended till Australia was on
the threshold of national life under a federal constitution.</p>

<p>Parkes reopened the federal question in 1889. Politicians in other
colonies with whom he communicated were still annoyed with him because
they thought he had not treated the Federal Council fairly, and he
derived at first little satisfaction from endeavours to enlist them in
a federal movement under his leadership. But he persisted, and at
length succeeded in bringing together a conference of ministers (1890)
to consider means of preparing a constitution. This conference resulted
in the holding of the first Australasian Federal Convention, in Sydney,
in 1891. Its members were chosen from the Parliaments of the colonies,
and they were representative of the best political intelligence
Australia had at her command at the time.</p>

<p>The Convention of 1891 prepared the first draft constitution: a
document which, though not finally adopted, was really the basis of the
work of the later Convention, and therefore of the constitution of
Australia as it came into being. The ideas embodied in it were
discussed in the open Convention, but the drafting of the clauses was
the work of a small committee consisting of Samuel Griffith, afterwards
Chief Justice of Australia, Edmund Barton, afterwards Prime Minister,
Inglis Clarke, afterwards a Tasmanian Judge, and Charles Cameron
Kingston, a master hand at legislative drafting, who was afterwards a
distinguished minister of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The constitution so prepared had to be adopted by the people of the
colonies, the intention being that if it were accepted by any three of
them it should be passed as an act of the Imperial Parliament, and
become law. But New South Wales again proved to be an obstacle to
union. Parkes had to encounter strong opposition in his own Parliament,
where a party led by G. H. Reid--who had not been a member of the
Convention--condemned it as the work of 'the great ambitious statesmen
of Australia,' as insufficiently democratic in structure, and as being
especially objectionable in its clauses affecting finance and trade.
There was a feeling in Parkes's own Cabinet against federation on the
terms proposed, whilst in the country the opposition seemed likely to
be formidable. After testing the opinion of Parliament, therefore,
Parkes did not proceed with the bill. In the other colonies it was
deemed to be useless to take action unless there were a reasonable
probability of New South Wales forming part of the federation, and,
failing a lead from Parkes, nothing was done. The work of the 1891
Convention seemed, therefore, to have resulted in failure.</p>

<p>Parkes's period of leadership was over, and he died in 1895. The new
chief of the federal party in New South Wales was Edmund Barton, then
in the ripeness of his great powers, a constructive statesman of wide
grasp and deep learning who had determined to make this the main
purpose of his political life.</p>

<p>The federal movement was soon to be transferred to another
arena--that in which the power of a democracy resides. Popular leagues
were formed to advance the common cause; and at a conference of such
bodies held at Corowa in 1895 a new plan of campaign was adopted at the
suggestion of John Quick, a delegate of the Bendigo Federal League. His
guiding idea was that a fresh impetus towards federation should emanate
directly from the people; that a constitution should be drafted by a
convention elected directly by the people; that the constitution, when
drafted, should be submitted to the people for acceptance or rejection;
and that, if it were accepted in two or more colonies, it should be
passed by the Imperial Parliament and become law. The movement was to
be popular in origin and directly dependent upon popular control
throughout. From the adoption of this scheme in 1893 dates the
irresistible march of the federal movement to victory. Jealousies,
personal ambitions, particularist interests, the tinkering pettiness of
party manoeuvring, might sprag the wheels for a while, but there could
no longer be more than temporary hindrances.</p>

<p>To the Convention of 1897-8, which prepared the instrument that
became the constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, came ten
representatives of each colony except Queensland, whose Parliament did
not pass the Enabling Bill for the election of delegates. The ten from
each of the other colonies were elected directly by the people, except
the representatives of Western Australia. The Parliament of that State
feared to adopt the method of popular election, because the gold-fields
population was so overwhelmingly large that it would have swamped the
voting power of the agricultural portion, which, under the franchise
then in force, dominated the Legislature. Consequently, the ten
representatives from Western Australia were chosen by the Parliament,
and there was not amongst them one who could authoritatively voice the
view of the gold-fields, where the federal feeling was very strong.</p>

<p>The Convention held three sessions--in Adelaide, Sydney, and
Melbourne. In personnel it was the most richly endowed assemblage of
political ability which had ever been brought together in Australia.
Griffith now occupied one of the 'seats above the thunder,' as Chief
Justice of Queensland; but the method of popular election had secured
the inclusion of nearly every other man who on grounds of experience,
character, weight in leadership and personal distinction, counted for
very much in the politics of the time.</p>

<p>The problem of arranging for the surrender, by a group of
self-governing States, of a large part of their independence and powers
to a newly created Government erected above them is one of peculiar
complexity. Rarely has it been achieved except under external pressure,
or the menace of internal disruption. The federation of the United
States of America was born of revolutionary warfare and the grave
prospect of ills that would accrue from disunion. But there were no
such impulsions in Australia. The country had never known war. It was
safe from outside aggression, protected by the bulwarks of the Imperial
Navy. It had never endured rebellion, or any disturbance that could not
be overcome by a handful of soldiers and policemen. It was brought to
federation by good reason and sound political appreciation of the
disabilities of disunion. The success of the federal movement was the
fruit of popular education and of the experience of a democracy in
thinking out and settling its own problems. A celebrated Imperial
statesman in the House of Commons spoke of the constitution drafted by
the Convention as 'a monument of legislative competency.' It owed
nothing to the guidance of any masters from outside, wise in affairs of
State and cunning in the fashioning of laws. The Australian democracy
chose its own men from its own ranks, and set them to build for it a
constitutional house to dwell in. Nearly all the leaders of the
Convention were native horn, and had been schooled in their own land.
All were of British origin. Amongst the fifty names of the members, not
one is of foreign derivation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII - THE CONSTITUTION</h3>

<blockquote><b>Responsible government and federation--The task of the
Convention--Types of federal government--The Senate--The House of
Representatives--Provision against deadlocks--The High Court--The
Governor-General--Federal powers-- The name 'Commonwealth'--New South
Wales and the constitution-- G. H. Reid's
attitude--Referendums--Conference of premiers--The Bill before the

<p>The task of the Convention was made easier by having the draft of
1891 as a model; and a comparison between the Constitution which it
prepared and its predecessor shows both general resemblance and
striking differences. Substantially the framework of the new edifice
followed the lines laid down six years before. The departures lay in
the widening of scope and the liberalizing of powers.</p>

<p>The main problem was to engraft a federal system upon responsible
government after the familiar British pattern; which looks easy now
that it has been done, but which appeared to be so exceedingly
difficult to those who first attempted it that one who sat in both
Conventions considered that 'either responsible government would kill
federation or federation would kill responsible government.' The
Commonwealth of Australia has not been impaled on either horn of the
dilemma, but has successfully worked a system of federal government
quite novel in design. Very learned men were engaged in this work of
constitution building, and the student who examines the reports of the
debates will see that every example of federation known to history had
been studied by them. One distinguished man, a little hastily perhaps,
or because it sounded well, said, in urging that exclusively British
forms of government were best adapted to Australian conditions, 'As I
do not wish my boots to be made in Germany, so I do not want my
constitution to be made in Switzerland.' Quickly came the retort: 'I
want my boots made where I find they fit me best.' The whole course of
human experience was available, and the framers of the Constitution
were ready to learn from every source. But certainly they did wish to
retain the mode of constitutional government which the Australian
people, understood, if it would work under a true federal scheme.</p>

<p>Australia consisted of six separate States, each endowed with
complete self-government under the Crown. Not one of them need give up
a shred of its independence unless it chose to do so. But in order that
there might be a federation at all, these six independent States had to
agree to surrender certain of their powers to the new supreme
government which it was proposed to establish. When the Dominion of
Canada was formed in 1867, the provincial Governments were made
subordinate to the new central Government. The provincial Governors in
Canada under the Dominion Constitution are appointed by the Dominion
Government; and if the provincial Parliaments pass laws of which the
Dominion Government disapproves, it can disallow them.</p>

<p>But the Australian States, in their pride of independence, were not
content to agree to a union on those lines. Instead of creating a
central supreme Government, which should take the powers it needed and
leave the remainder to the States, they desired to grant to the Federal
Government the powers which they chose to surrender, to define them in
strict terms, and to retain the remainder in their own hands. They
would be the granters of powers, not the recipients of such powers as
the central Government did not desire to exercise.</p>

<p>The United States form of Federation was more to the taste of the
Convention than the Canadian form. There the central Government
exercises certain defined powers and cannot go beyond them. If it does,
its action is illegal, and will he declared to be so by the Supreme
Court of the United States. A constitution somewhat after that pattern
was what Australia required, except for one very important
difference.</p>

<p>In the United States there is not what is known as responsible
government; and Australia wanted that also. The members of the
President's Cabinet do not sit in Congress. They are responsible to
him. Congress makes the laws, and the Executive--the President and his
ministers--enforce them. But if Congress is not satisfied with the way
the ministers do their work, it cannot turn them out. It can grumble,
but cannot interfere. They are independent of parliamentary control.
Australia wanted to have a federal Parliament in which ministers would
sit, where they could be criticized face to face, where questions could
be put to them, where they could be turned out of office if their
policy or their administration did not satisfy the majority. So that,
briefly stated, Australia wanted a form of government like that of the
United States as far as regarded the strict limitation of its powers,
but like the British system in respect to the responsibility of
ministers to Parliament.</p>

<p>The Constitution was therefore made to provide that no minister
shall hold office for longer than three months unless he he a member of
Parliament. If a Government wishes to appoint a certain man as a
minister, he must obtain a seat in Parliament. If no constituency will
elect him, he cannot remain a minister.</p>

<p>In order to protect the rights of the States, the constitution set
up a house of legislature called the Senate, to consist of six members
from each State. This gave to Tasmania, with its small population,
exactly the same representation in the Senate as New South Wales, with
its comparatively large population, and might in that regard seem to be
unfair. But the idea was to enable the less populous States to
safeguard their interests if they should ever come into conflict with
those of the more thickly populated States. It was considered that if
there were only one house of legislature, elected on the principle of
one member to a given number of electors, the smaller States would be
in danger of being swamped. If, for example, an issue particularly
affecting Tasmania were in question, and on a population basis she had
only five representatives, whilst New South Wales had twenty-seven, she
might, it was feared, suffer an injustice. But that would not be likely
to occur if in the Senate all the States were on an equality. The
Senate therefore was not an 'upper house,' like the House of Lords, or
a House of nominated members, or of members elected on a restricted
franchise like a Legislative Council, but was a States House.</p>

<p>The second legislative chamber which the Constitution established
was called the House of Representatives, and was to consist of members
chosen directly by the people on the basis of electoral equality--each
elector in each State having the same voting power as his fellow, and
no more. There were to be at least twice as many representatives as
there were senators, and each State was to be allotted so many,
according to population. No elector was to have more than one vote.</p>

<p>In the section defining the right of electors there were words which
ensured that no elector who had acquired the right to vote in a State
'shall be prevented by any law of the Commonwealth from voting at
elections for either House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth.'
Those words were inserted because in South Australia women were
enfranchised, and the members of the Convention from that State desired
to ensure that the right to vote should not be taken away from them
under the Federal Constitution. The insertion of the words virtually
ensured the extension of the franchise to women throughout Australia,
because, it being obviously desirable that the franchise should be
uniform, the only way of securing uniformity was to give to all women
the same electoral status as was enjoyed by those in South
Australia.</p>

<p>Experience of disagreements between two legislative houses had been
so unpleasant in Australia, that the framers of the constitution
inserted special provisions to remove deadlocks. They also provided for
setting up a High Court, invested not only with jurisdiction to hear
appeals from state courts, but also to act as the sole interpreter of
the Constitution. If a federal law was alleged to impinge upon the
powers of the States, or if a state law interfered in a matter which
was within the federal scope, the High Court alone was to have
authority to prevent the encroachment.</p>

<p>Surmounting the federal edifice was placed a Governor-General,
appointed by the Crown.</p>

<p>Stated in summary form, the federal structure consisted of (a) a
House of Representatives, elected on a wide franchise, one elector
exercising one vote and no more; (b) a Senate in which the States had
equality of representation; (c) the Executive, consisting necessarily
of members of Parliament; (d) the High Court, the sole authorised
interpreter of the Constitution; (e) the Governor-General, representing
the Sovereign.</p>

<p>The powers entrusted to the Federal Government were defined in
thirty-seven paragraphs of section 52 of the Constitution. Their range
was great, covering defence, posts and telegraphs, navigation, customs
and excise, trade and commerce with other countries and among the
States, currency, census and statistics, marriage and divorce, banking,
insurance, weights and measures, immigration and emigration, copyright,
fisheries, quarantine, naturalization, external affairs and treaties,
the relations of the Commonwealth with the islands of the Pacific,
conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of
industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. On
all these highly important subjects, and some others of lesser
consequence, the Commonwealth had power to legislate, and whenever it
exercised that power its laws were to override state laws. Thus, if the
Commonwealth passed a new marriage law, all state marriage laws would
at once cease to have validity.</p>

<p>The word 'Commonwealth' was first suggested as a name for the union
of the Australian States by Henry Parkes, in the constitutional
committee of the 1891 Convention--though that fact is not disclosed by
the reported debates. When the suggestion was made it was rejected; but
the name was afterwards formally proposed by Alfred Deakin, one of the
Victorian delegates, and carried in the committee by the very narrow
majority of one. When the matter came before the full Convention in the
text of the draft bill, strong exception was taken to it. To some the
word recalled the grim iconoclasts of the Cromwellian revolution--'take
away that bauble'--'paint me warts and all'--Ironsides and cropped
polls--and such upsettings as made nervous politicians blink! But the
more it was thought about the better it sounded; especially after the
scholarly eloquence of Edmund Barton had shown what a classic English
word it was. Then the Convention adopted it by twenty-six votes to
thirteen. When the 1897-8 Convention was called together, the name had
so much taken possession of the popular mind that none other would do.
Only one member took exception to it then, but he could find no support
for his objection. 'Commonwealth,' said Barton, 'is the grandest and
most stately name by which a great association of self-governing people
can be characterized'; and it remained in the title as 'an act to
constitute the Commonwealth of Australia.'</p>

<p>The history of the Constitution between the time when it left the
hands of its framers in March 1898 and its enactment as a statute of
the Imperial Parliament in July 1900 is full of interest. This, indeed,
was the critical period of Australian federal history. Into those
twenty-eight months were crowded many strange political adventures and
a whirl of excitement, including some acrobatic feats.</p>

<p>The procedure laid down in the Enabling Acts which had been passed
by the States, and under which the Convention had done its work, was
that after the Constitution had been drafted it should be submitted to
the people, and that it must, to ensure acceptance, receive a minimum
number of affirmative votes in each State. The minimum required in New
South Wales was 50,000. But after the Convention had prepared the bill,
a professed enemy of federation in the New South Wales Parliament
introduced a bill to make the minimum 120,000. It was well known that
such a number of affirmative votes could not be recorded. The clear
intention was to prevent the Constitution becoming law. Reid, the
Premier, objected to the 120,000 minimum, but himself suggested raising
it to 80,000; a figure which was sufficient to make the fate of the
measure insecure.</p>

<p>Reid's object was to bring about a reconsideration of the bill in
several important particulars. He disliked the financial clauses, and
he especially objected to the clause which provided that 'the seat of
government shall be determined by the Parliament.' A large body of
opinion in Sydney felt that the capital of the Commonwealth ought to be
in New South Wales. That was the oldest State of the group, and was
also the wealthiest and most populous. Reid was not only impressed by
this argument, which was very vociferously urged in Sydney, but was
also so trenchant in his criticism of other provisions that nearly the
whole of the first public speech in which he uttered them was a
sustained argument for the rejection of the Constitution by the people
of New South Wales. Much to the surprise of those who heard it,
however, he concluded by saying that, notwithstanding all the defects
he had pointed out, and though he could not take up the bill with
enthusiasm, still he could not 'become a deserter from the cause,' and
regarded it as his duty to Australia to record his vote in favour of
it.</p>

<p>Reid's attitude bewildered many and angered more. It led the Sydney
<i>Bulletin</i> to define it as a 'Yes-No' attitude--a term which
figured largely in the controversy of the period, and found its way
into the dictionary. But all leading politicians have to get accustomed
to nicknames and tags. They are rarely so injurious as those who invent
them suppose them to be. It is always dangerous for a political leader
to make distinctions which appear to be subtle, but Reid's difficulty
can be appreciated by those who survey the situation in a calmer mood
than the fierce party frenzy of the day allowed. He conceived that he
had a divided duty: to the Convention of which he had been a member and
the bill which was its work, on the one hand, and to the assertive body
of public opinion in the State of which he was the Premier, on the
other. But his adverse criticism made it impossible to secure the
requisite 80,000 affirmative votes, and though there was a majority for
federation on the terms of the bill in New South Wales--there were
71,595 votes for and 66,228 against it--the cause of union was for the
time thwarted. In Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania there were
overwhelmingly large favourable majorities. In Western Australia the
obligation to submit the bill to a referendum had not been assumed by
the Government.</p>

<p>It would have been legally possible for the three States which had
adopted the Constitution to federate under it by the process of
petitioning the Crown to submit it to the Imperial Parliament. But
federation without New South Wales would have been absurd, and the
three Governments felt that a patient policy was the better one. The
question was: What amendments would satisfy Reid and his Sydney
supporters? Their attitude was defined late in 1898. The Victorian
Premier, George Turner, thereupon summoned a conference of State
Premiers to meet in Melbourne, when, to the satisfaction of all
Australia, it was joined by the Queensland Premier, J. R. Dickson,
whose presence was a guarantee that the sixth State of the group was
now prepared to co-operate. Five amendments were prepared by this
conference. Three were financial, a fourth related to the power of the
Federal Parliament to alter the boundaries of States, and the fifth was
the alteration which was designed to placate the local feelings of
Reid's Sydney supporters. Instead of leaving to the Federal Parliament
unrestricted power to determine where the capital of the Commonwealth
should be, it provided that, while the Parliament should sit in
Melbourne, and the seat of government should be there pending the
building of a federal capital, the permanent home of the Commonwealth
Government should be within territory to be 'granted to or acquired by
the Commonwealth,' but must be 'in the State of New South Wales, and be
distant not less than one hundred miles from Sydney.'</p>

<p>These amendments made all the difference between success and
failure. At a second referendum, held in June, 1899, there were 107,420
affirmative and 82,741 negative votes in New South Wales. A comparison
between the voting in 1898 and 1899 is instructive. It shows an
increase of federal feeling in all the States in which there were
referendum polls in both years. Queensland did not vote in 1898, and
Western Australia, whose Government was angling for special financial
terms did not join the federation till after the bill had been passed
by the Imperial Parliament. The comparison is shown by the following
table:</p>

<p>The attitude of Western Australia was different from that of any
other State. The gold discoveries had attracted thither thousands of
men from other parts of Australia. They were called 'T'othersiders' by
the old colonists, who, if not opponents of federation on any terms,
demanded that certain amendments should be made in the Constitution.
The chief amendments they wanted were a guarantee that the Federal
Government, when established, would construct a transcontinental
railway connecting Western Australia with the eastern States, and
permission for Western Australia to impose her own customs and excise
duties for a period of five years after a federal tariff was brought
into force.</p>

<p>But the gold-fields population were federationists almost to a man.
They had certain grievances against the Western Australian Government,
which had refused to grant them franchise rights on an equality with
the inhabitants of the rest of the State. When they demanded that the
whole of the people of Western Australia should be given an opportunity
of expressing an opinion on the federation issue by means of a
referendum, their petition was rejected by both houses of the
Parliament. The gold-fields people then determined, 'as all other
constitutional means have been tried and failed,' to petition the Queen
for the separation of the gold-fields from the rest of Western
Australia, to establish a separate government there, and thus to enable
the new State so created to become part of the Australian
Commonwealth.</p>

<p>In view of the strength of this separation movement, the Secretary
of State for the Colonies, Chamberlain, telegraphed to the Governor of
Western Australia urging that his ministers should 'take into
consideration the fact of the agitation by the federal party,
especially on the gold-fields,' and intimating that it appeared to him
to be 'of the utmost importance to the future of Western Australia to
join at once.' This was a clear hint to the Western Australian
Government that if they continued to stand aloof, the petition from the
gold-fields might be acted upon by the Imperial Government. Sir John
Forrest and his ministers thereupon came to the conclusion that the
risk of separation was too high a price to pay for continued opposition
to the demand for joining the Federation. They therefore took steps to
enable the people of Western Australia to express their opinion, with
the result that, as recorded above, the large majority voted in favour
of the acceptance of the Commonwealth Bill.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Bill having thus been accepted by the people of
Australia, it was necessary for it to be passed by the Imperial
Parliament. But now again difficulties arose. The bill, in conferring
upon the High Court exclusive jurisdiction in cases involving the
interpretation of the Constitution, also gave power to the Federal
Parliament to make laws limiting the matters of law in which appeals
might be made to the Privy Council, the highest court of appeal in the
Empire. The English law officers objected to this limiting power being
conferred upon the Parliament. That the High Court should (unless it
chose to give special leave to appeal to the Privy Council) be the sole
interpreter of the Constitution, and of the limits of the powers of the
Commonwealth and of the States, was conceded. But objection was made to
restricting the right of citizens to appeal to the highest Imperial
tribunal on several grounds, two of which were of broad
significance--first, that the Privy Council was a bond between various
parts of the Empire which it should be the aim of Imperial policy to
strengthen rather than to weaken; and, secondly, that the Privy Council
ensured uniformity in the interpretation of the law throughout the
Empire on matters of commercial and Imperial concern.</p>

<p>The Imperial Government did not think that so sweeping a change
should be made unless they were satisfied that the demand for it was
one 'that has behind it the whole force of Australian opinion.' Their
inquiries had not satisfied them that such was the case.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State, Chamberlain, made it clear, however, that
even though he and his Government felt strongly that an amendment ought
to be made in this particular, they would not attempt to withstand a
genuine Australian demand. Delegates had been sent to England to
represent the Australian States in watching the handling of the
Constitution by the British Government and Parliament, and four of
them, Barton (New South Wales), Deakin (Victoria), Kingston (South
Australia), and Fysh (Tasmania), made a very determined fight for the
bill in an unaltered shape. Dickson (Queensland) was not so decisive.
'The delegates submit,' they wrote, 'that the federating colonies are
morally entitled to have the whole bill laid before Parliament in the
very form in which it stood when the votes of the people, affirming it,
constituted it the Australian agreement.' They protested in a vigorous
and lofty strain against having to 'choose between the bowl of
intervention and the dagger of delay.' But the Imperial Government
stood firmly by their objection, and on the reference of the points in
dispute to a conference of Premiers which sat in Melbourne, those
gentlemen represented that if a choice had to be made between the
amendment of the bill as proposed or its postponement, they considered
that the latter course 'would be much more objectionable to Australians
generally than the former.' The appeal clause was therefore amended,
and a few alterations were made in other provisions to bring the
measure into harmony with the criticisms of the Imperial law
officers.</p>

<p>In May 1900 the bill was brought before the House of Commons by
Chamberlain, and was considered in a debate marked by an exalted tone
of eloquent good-will. Chamberlain, a master of the art of clear
exposition, gave a remarkably interesting account of the history of the
federal movement, and a lucid analysis of the bill itself. He described
it as 'a monument of legislative competency.' 'Considering the
magnitude and the variety of the interests that we are to deal with,
the intricacy and importance of the subjects with which the bill has to
deal, I think,' he said, 'that no praise can be too high for those
whose moderation, patience, skill, mutual consideration and patriotism
have been able to produce so great a result.' Mr. Asquith, who spoke of
it as 'this great fabric which has been so skilfully and laboriously
built,' declared that 'the Australian Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of
the future, is a whole which we believe is destined to be greater than
the sum of its component parts, and which, without draining them of any
of their life, will give to them, in their corporate unity, a freedom
of development, a scale of interests, a dignity of stature, which,
alone and separated, they could never command.' In July the bill passed
both Houses of the Imperial Parliament, and it became an Act on the 9th
of that month.</p>

<p>On September 17, 1900, by a proclamation issued by Queen Victoria
from Balmoral, the Commonwealth of Australia was declared to come into
being on and after January 1, 1901. The first Governor-General, the
Earl of Hopetoun, swore in his first Cabinet, that of the federal
leader, Edmund Barton, in Sydney on that date; and on May 9th of the
same year the rich, far-carrying voice of the son of King Edward VII,
the Duke of Cornwall and York, rang out in the great Exhibition
building, Melbourne, as he formally opened the first Federal
Parliament.</p>

<p>Historical events, like mountain ranges, can best be surveyed as a
whole by an observer who is placed at a good distance from them. Out of
the welter of acrimony, stratagem, ambition, generous impulses, lofty
aspirations, meanness, selfishness, patriotism, and all the other
motive forces amid which the work of the world gets itself done, emerge
at length clear to the view certain shining personalities, certain
determinations fluent in consequences, which are the stuff of which
history is made. Many people who made such noise while they strutted
their hour become happily forgotten, and many events which were
responsible for large headings in newspapers are seen to be of no
particular importance. The student of the history of the first quarter
of a century of the Commonwealth who enters upon his task a century
hence will see things in different proportion from him who makes the
attempt at closer range.</p>

<p>But there are things which we can be sure were not merely ephemeral,
because they had to do with the laying down of main lines of policy.
Where those lines will run, how they will be deflected, whether they
will conduce ultimately to good or ill results, is beyond prediction.
But they are important because they are main lines.</p>

<p>In the First Federal Parliament (1901-3) there were three political
parties: the supporters of the Barton Government, which was
protectionist; the official opposition led by G. H. Reid, which
contended for a tariff for revenue-raising purposes only; and the
Labour Party led by J. 0. Watson. The Ministry comprised five men who
had been Premiers of their States before federation--Messrs. Forrest,
Kingston, Turner, Lyne, and Fysh; in addition to Alfred Deakin, the
most brilliant orator then engaged in politics, and one whose broad
culture and personal charm won him influence beyond the political
sphere. It was in experience and intellect a strong administration with
which to commence operations under a new constitution, though it
contained too many leaders to give promise of endurance. It was an army
of generals, an orchestra of conductors; and that Edmund Barton did
succeed in inducing them all to play the same tune, or fight on the
same plan of campaign, during nearly two sessions, was a remarkable
achievement in leadership.</p>

<p>The leader of the Opposition, Reid, whom nature designed in a mood
of kindness to political caricaturists, was, since the death of Parkes,
the most familiar figure in Australian affairs. His fund of humour was
not the least of his endowments; and it was employed to give liveliness
to a rare gift of dignified and impassioned eloquence, and to a
quick-witted skill in debate--which would seize upon a chance word as
it flew and return it as a weapon barbed.</p>

<p>The Labour Party counted twenty-four members in the two Houses of
Parliament. Generally they supported the Barton Ministry, but they were
an independent party, with aggressive aims and a clear if not as yet
proclaimed intention to impose their own policy by the work of a
Government of their own choice upon the Commonwealth. Their selected
leader, Watson, had been a Labour member of Parliament in New South
Wales, but had not secured there opportunities for distinction such as
he soon showed his capacity for winning in Commonwealth politics. A man
of good presence and urbane manners, he was a clear and incisive public
speaker, and an astute and tactful parliamentarian.</p>

<p>Although a Labour Government did not come into office till 1904, the
Labour Party held the key to the Australian political situation from
the very commencement of the Commonwealth. On a few issues the opinions
of its members were divided. Before the first Tariff was passed and
protection had become the assured fiscal policy of the country, some of
them, especially those from New South Wales, were strong free traders.
But whenever the party was united, its compact cluster of votes was
sufficient to ensure that what it insisted upon in legislation would
become law. The only way of negativing the party's influence would have
been for the Opposition to support the Government when the Labour Party
did not concur in a ministerial proposal; but, as the main business of
the Opposition was to try to turn out the Government, such support was
not likely to be accorded often. The Labour Party held the key because
on most important issues it assisted the Barton Government, which could
not have carried its measures without Labour support. Moreover, the
Labour Party had developed methods of party organization to a pitch not
hitherto known in Australian politics. On issues which it declared to
be essential to the carrying out of its political programme its members
were pledged to vote as the majority of its members determined; on
other issues they were free to vote according to their personal
disposition. This system of party discipline gave to it a solid
coherency which increased its strength.</p>

<p>Two measures of the first session were designed to give effect to
what Barton described as the 'white Australia' policy. One of these was
for the purpose of preventing the immigration of coloured races, the
other for clearing the Kanakas out of the sugar plantations of
Queensland. The strength of the feeling in Australia against
indiscriminate immigration had pronounced itself very strongly since
the days of the gold diggings, and it was understood that one of the
earliest acts of the Federal Parliament would be to pass a
comprehensive measure of exclusion. The reason for it was frequently
represented to be merely that the trade unions objected to the
incursion of coloured labour, which would lower wages and the standard
of living among the working classes. Undeniably that motive had much
weight, but the policy was supported on other grounds connected with
the general well-being. Those who had studied the consequences of the
importation of negroes to America might well stand appalled at the
prospect of saddling the Australia of the future with such a problem,
and experience of the Chinese quarters of the large cities provided
ample warnings against increasing such an element of the
population.</p>

<p>But Barton wished to be careful not to pass Australian legislation
which might embarrass the Imperial Government. The Secretary of State
had sounded a warning in a despatch wherein he had indicated that
disqualification on the ground of race or colour was 'contrary to the
general conceptions of equality which have ever been the guiding
principle of British rule throughout the Empire.' In fact, however, the
principle that British possessions were at liberty to regulate their
immigration was already established law; and the method which the
Barton Government proposed was adapted from an Act already in force in
the colony of Natal. That method was the education test. Power was
given to require any immigrant to submit to the test of writing not
less than fifty words in any prescribed European language. (In 1905 the
Act was amended by making the education test consist of capacity to
write fifty words in 'any prescribed language.') This gave the
officials charged with the administration of the Act scope to
'prescribe' a language in which they knew that an intending immigrant
was not proficient. In practice the test has rarely been applied to
European immigrants; the intention was to use it for the exclusion of
coloured races. The power was abused in 1934, in an attempt to exclude
the Czech writer Egon Kisch, and also a New Zealander, Gerald Griffin,
for political reasons. These attempts failed, but the power was misused
again (and successfully) in 1936 to exclude a British subject, Mrs.
Freer. The cause in this case appeared to be nothing more than personal
reasons on the part of the minister responsible for the administration
of the law, and some time later the government wisely allowed Mrs.
Freer to enter the country. The administration was also enabled to
admit merchants, travellers, students, and visitors from Asiatic
countries who were provided with passports, which are valid for one
year. The criticism levelled against this method by opponents was that
it did by a subterfuge what it would have been more honest to do by the
simple process of direct exclusion. That process would have been
preferred by the supporters of the policy, but it was considered
objectionable by the Imperial Government, whilst the education test was
deemed by them to be the least disagreeable mode of carrying out a
policy which they did not like. The Immigration Restriction Act became
law in 1901. It has been several times amended, always with the purpose
of strengthening the system.</p>

<p>The legislation regarding the South Sea Islanders was passed at the
same time. The story of the importation of Kanakas to Queensland has
been related in Chapter XXV. To a large extent the grosser evils of the
coloured labour traffic had been mitigated by improved state
legislation, but the more it was brought into conformity with the
demands of civilization, the greater the danger of Kanaka labour being
made a permanent feature of the industrial life of Queensland; and
against that the Commonwealth resolutely set its face. The Pacific
Islands' Labourers Act gave power to the Government to return to their
islands any Kanakas who should be in Australia after December 1906; but
by a later Act all Kanakas who had lived in Australia for twenty years,
all who could not be returned to their islands without risk to their
lives, and all who owned land, were allowed to remain in Australia.
About 3,600 were at length deported. The champions of the planters
averred that sugar could only be grown with black labour. Without that,
a collapse of the industry was confidently predicted. But the Federal
Government imposed a heavy duty on sugar, to secure the Australian
market for the Australian growers, and also granted bounties to those
who produced sugar with white labour only. The details of the
legislation of 1902 have been varied from time to time, but the
principle of it has been adhered to. The predictions of failure have
not been fulfilled. On the contrary, the sugar industry has prospered.
The acreage under cane and the yields of sugar have increased. Whereas
in 1897-8 Australia produced 1,073,883 tons of cane, in 1938-9 the
production was 5,680,000 tons.</p>

<p>The break-up of the Barton Ministry was heralded before the close of
the first Parliament by the resignation of C. C. Kingston. A burly
South Australian, whose radical tendencies were in sympathy with the
Labour Party's programme in very many respects, Kingston had, as
Minister of Customs, prepared the first protectionist tariff, and had
steered it through the Legislature. The Labour Party had pressed for a
measure to establish a Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and
Arbitration in labour disputes, and Kingston had taken a keen interest
in its preparation. But he was not satisfied with the bill after it had
been reviewed by the Cabinet. It was especially inadequate from his
point of view because it did not extend to seamen engaged in the
coastal trade. His colleagues, following the Prime Minister's lead,
considered that the case of the seamen would be better provided for in
a Navigation Bill; but Kingston would not endure their exclusion from
the purview of the Arbitration Court, and left the Ministry. He was in
bad health at the time, and did not figure prominently in Commonwealth
politics after his resignation; for he was soon held in the grip of a
long illness which ended his strenuous life on May 12, 1907.</p>

<p>A man of haughty temper, notwithstanding his strong democratic
leanings, Kingston was at his best intellectually as a draftsman of
parliamentary bills. He spoke in a series of emphatic spasms heaved
forth with a voice of thunder; but when he took pen in hand to prepare
an Act of Parliament he had command of a crisp precision of phrase and
a sure sense of the value of words, that could express a meaning in the
shortest and most unmistakable terms. Instead of saying that any person
charged with an offence against the said section in the manner
aforesaid and being without reasonable cause or excuse should on
conviction before a court of summary jurisdiction be liable to a fine
not exceeding 20 pounds, Kingston would write at the end of a tersely
worded section, 'Penalty, 20 pounds'--and, oddly enough, neither courts
nor persons affected ever had the least doubt as to what was meant.</p>

<p>A couple of months after Kingston's resignation from the Ministry
the Prime Minister himself retired from the scene of strife to the
dignified calm of the High Court bench. An Act constituting the Court,
which was an essential element of the constitutional fabric, had been
passed, and the office of Chief Justice of Australia was conferred upon
Sir Samuel Griffith, then Chief Justice of Queensland. Barton himself
took the second judgeship. The third went to Richard O'Connor, who had
represented the Government in the Senate since the commencement of
federation.</p>

<p>The second Prime Minister was Alfred Deakin, who at the general
election, held in December, 1903, made a valiant fight to retain the
ministerial party at full strength. But the Labour Party gained at the
expense of both the other parties, and emerged from the polls with 24
members out of 75 in the House of Representatives, and 15 out of 36 in
the Senate. It held the key to the situation still more firmly in its
grip. The Government was entirely dependent upon it for support. If
ever the party dissented from a matter of ministerial policy, its solid
phalanx had only to be increased by a few oppositionists to place the
Government in a minority, for Deakin could count no more than 27
followers, while Reid had 24.</p>

<p>Such a situation arose over the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill,
the measure which had nearly destroyed the Barton Government. Deakin
would not consent to the inclusion of a clause giving the right to
servants of the States to appeal to the Federal Court to ask for an
increase of pay from the Governments which employed them. Watson and
his followers insisted. Aided by a number of opposition members, they
carried the clause, and Deakin resigned (April 21, 1904). Then began a
bewildering series of changes. A citizen of the Commonwealth might any
morning have awakened wondering what Government was in office now.</p>

<p>First, a Labour Government under Watson took office. It endured till
August 12, when, having resisted an amendment to that most explosive
Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, it was defeated and gave place to a
Government formed from the old Barton-Deakin party and Reid's own
faithful band of Oppositionists. Reid was Prime Minister, and his
principal lieutenant was the Victorian, Allan McLean. Deakin supported
the combination till the end of the 1904 session, and enabled Reid to
steer his Government into recess. But during that recess Deakin made a
critical speech, from which Reid drew the inference that when
Parliament met again he would lose the support of the remnant who
looked to the ex-Prime Minister as their leader. He could not stand
without them, so he deliberately rode for a fall. When Parliament met
in June 1905, the Ministerial programme contained only one paragraph,
announcing that an Electoral Bill would be introduced. The meaning was
obvious: Reid would pass this bill, bring the session to a close, and
secure a general election. He hoped that he would return from the polls
with a party strong enough to keep his Government in office without
reliance on the Deakin section.</p>

<p>But Reid was playing his cards against two extremely quick and
astute politicians in Deakin and Watson. The former apparently
thought--certainly some of his party hoped--that if he displaced Reid's
Government at this juncture with the aid of the Labour Party, he would
be able to form a coalition with Watson, and to carry out such a policy
as they could both agree upon--for on very many points Deakin and his
group were not far removed in sympathy from Watson and the moderate
section of the Labour Party.</p>

<p>The first part of the scheme worked. Deakin launched a motion of
want of confidence and carried it with the aid of the Labour Party,
after a long debate full of vituperation, hate, malice, and all
uncharitableness. But there was no coalition. If Watson himself had
been agreeable, his party were not. They believed--and they were shown
to be right by the course of events--that if they exercised a little
patience they would soon be strong enough to form a Government of their
own. But their apple of power was not yet ripe, and it was better for
them to watch it reddening on the tree than to risk losing it by
sharing the fruit with another. Their supporters in the country were
jealous of 'labour men' who did not hold aloof from other parties.
Deakin therefore, with seventeen sure supporters in the House of
Representatives, of whom seven had seats in the Cabinet, formed a
Government which relied mainly for support upon the Labour Party.</p>

<p>This Government, which commenced its career on July 5, 1905, endured
till November 10, 1908, a period of three years and four months. Within
that time Watson had retired from the leadership of the Labour Party
(1907) and had been replaced by Andrew Fisher. Watson's subsequent
retirement from Parliament was regretted by all parties, for he had
made his mark as a fair fighter, a clear thinker, and a cool,
courteous, and able political leader. Fisher was a Scotsman who had
gone to Queensland as a young man, had entered Parliament there, and
had transferred himself to the federal arena on the advent of
federation. With none of the graces of speech, he had yet by constant
practice at the expense of his audiences acquired some readiness in
debate. His vein of Scotch caution was allied to a strong will--which,
of course, his opponents described as sheer obstinacy. Shrewd, if
rather slow; keen, if a little insensitive; he never lacked personal
dignity, and when unruffled by the passions of conflict was courteous
to all. He once said in public, 'I know my limitations,' and he did
know them so well that he never attempted what was beyond his powers.
That he was also a thoroughly loyal friend and a man of staunch
rectitude counted for very much in the attainment of the success that
came to him.</p>

<p>Under Fisher's leadership the Labour Party made its
long-contemplated step forward to the attainment of independent
political power. It had supported the Deakin Ministry until certain
contentious matters of policy, to be discussed in the following
chapter, had been disposed of. Fisher then intimated, in cold terms,
that that support would no longer be accorded. With the under-pinning
removed, the Government collapsed, and the first Fisher Ministry took
its place.</p>

<p>What happened simply was that the larger of the two parliamentary
groups which had kept the Deakin Government in office now became the
governing group, whilst the smaller one helped it to keep its place by
giving to it a sufficient though critical support. The question was:
how long this state of things would last. The Government had not a
majority of its own, and it would naturally try to secure one at the
next election. The probabilities were that it could only win extra
seats at the expense of the very members who were now its supporters,
many of whom represented constituencies wherein there was a very strong
Labour element. These members, therefore, were in the position of one
who should feed an animal with the certainty that at a favourable
opportunity it intended to devour him. Politicians are no more fond of
being devoured than are other people. The time for a general election
was approaching, and every day made these non labour supporters of the
Labour Government more and more uneasy. Behind the scenes negotiations
went on between some of them and the Opposition led by Reid. Both
groups thought it would be well for them to join forces to defeat the
Government.</p>

<p>But who was to lead the attack? Reid was not PERSONA GRATA with many
of the Deakin group. His political lieutenant, Joseph Cook, was not
very acceptable to them either. They must have Deakin himself. He had
publicly stated that he did not intend to take office in any Government
formed as the result of a combination of parties. But pressure was
brought to bear, and Deakin's nature was peculiarly susceptible to the
pressure of friends. He was not in good health, and would have
preferred a few years of rest from leadership. But he yielded at
length, and forwarded a polite and friendly note to Fisher informing
him that the support hitherto given to his Government would be
withdrawn. Again the underpinning was removed, and another Government
fell from this cause.</p>

<p>The new combination, which took office in June 1909, was known as
the Fusion, or Deakin-Cook, Government. Reid was sent to London as
first Commonwealth High Commissioner. But at the general election held
in April, 1910, the electors of the Commonwealth, many of whom must
have become confused by the complicated changes which have been
detailed, showed themselves adverse to the Ministry. The tide ran high
and full for the Labour Party, and swept it back to Parliament with a
majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. In the
former House it captured every seat--that is, eighteen, for only half
the members of the Senate retire at a general election--and counted 23
votes in a House of 36. In the House of Representatives it secured 42
seats for its own members, and had in addition the benevolent
neutrality of two independents.</p>

<p>Fisher was thus for the second time Prime Minister. His Government
was chosen on this occasion by a method that was quite new in the
history of constitutional government. The usual mode in Australia, as
in England, was for the Governor-General--in England the Sovereign--to
send for the political leader who was indicated by the debates and
divisions to possess the confidence of the majority, to commission him
to form a Ministry, and for the Prime Minister so chosen to select his
ministers. But the Federal Labour Party was differently organized from
other political parties. Its members were pledged to a political
programme drawn up by an annual Labour Conference. This Conference in
1905 had registered the decree that henceforth Labour Governments
should not be chosen by the Prime Minister, but should be selected by
the full body of the federal Labour members. Fisher, recognizing that
his strength depended upon the widespread and very powerful
organizations of the party in the country, initiated the observance of
this rule. The members of the Government which held office from April
1910 till the next general election in May 1913 were therefore chosen
by ballot by the party which supported them in Parliament. During
Fisher's second period as Prime Minister, the Commonwealth Bank was
established by law, and it commenced business in January 1913.</p>

<p>The election of 1913 witnessed the retirement from active politics
of Deakin, whose health had been shaken by the strain of so many years
of official work and bitter conflict. Cook was chosen to head the
Fusion party, and fortune turned a rather wry smile upon him at the
polls. So wry was it that it was hardly a smile. The Labour Party lost
some seats, and Cook was able to re-enter the House of Representatives
with a majority of one. That meant that when his supporters had elected
a Speaker they had no majority at all. Moreover, the Labour Party still
had an overwhelming preponderance in the Senate. So that the new Cook
Government could not carry a scrap of legislation without the grace of
its opponents, who very soon showed their determination to exert their
power to the full. The parliamentary machine was clearly unworkable
under these conditions. Cook met the situation by a bold, deliberate
challenge. He was pledged to two items of policy in regard to which the
issue between his party and Fisher's was clearly drawn. These were, a
measure to restore voting by post, which the Labour Party had abolished
because of allegations of improper practices in the use of it; and a
measure to destroy the preferential treatment of trade unionists by the
Arbitration Court. The two bills were forced through the House of
Representatives after very tough fighting, and were promptly rejected
by the Senate. Planning then to bring into use the machinery of the
Constitution for the removal of deadlocks, the Government forced their
bills through the House of Representatives again, expressly to provoke
the Senate to reject them a second time. This having been done, the
Prime Minister advised the Governor-General to dissolve both
Houses.</p>

<p>A new Governor-General, Sir Ronald Munro-Ferguson, had only just
assumed office, and the situation was a very perplexing one for him to
handle. The Labour Party denied that there was justification for
dissolving a Parliament not yet one year old, and in which only one
political leader had been tried. There was no precedent for such a
stroke in the history of constitutional Government. But there was no
precedent for the situation which existed.</p>

<p>Munro-Ferguson was himself a very experienced parliamentarian. He
was no amateur amid the whirl and clang of party, for he had been a
'whip' in the House of Commons; and he was endowed with a capacity for
cool judgment and firm decision. Moreover, he knew what his own powers
were under the Constitution. His reading of the position was that no
satisfactory results could be expected from a Parliament such as the
last election had provided. He therefore dissolved both Houses. Events
justified the discretion which he exercised. The Labour Party at the
election of 1914 was returned with an ample majority in both Houses,
and the third Fisher Government took office less than six weeks after
the outbreak of the great European War. The difficulties they had to
face then were not parliamentary, but imperial and international.</p>

<p>Fisher resigned at the end of 1915 in order to take up the duties of
High Commissioner in succession to Reid. The Prime-Ministership then
fell to his brilliant and energetic Attorney-General, William Morris
Hughes.</p>

<p>Such then, in brief, is the history of party warfare under the
Commonwealth during its first fifteen years. To the superficial and
cynical observer it may have seemed a 'scuffling of kites and crows.'
But these confused and clamorous happenings meant more than that.
Political forces, like the forces of nature, often tear and rend in a
manner disturbing to the placid ease of good-natured equanimity. The
men who fought these battles were not mere self-seeking 'caterpillars
of the commonwealth,' but sincere and serious leaders of opinion, who
were contending for different sets of principles. The rapid rise of a
new party--that is, of a new force--necessarily entailed a fresh
adjustment of political relations.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX - THE COMMONWEALTH - (b) THE WHEELS OF POLICY</h3>

<blockquote><b>The federal capital--Choice of Dalgety--Choice revoked
and Canberra finally selected--Papua and the Northern Territory--The
Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway--The amendment of the
constitution--The referendums--Defence policy--The naval
agreement--Compulsory military service--The Kitchener and Henderson
reports--The new naval squadron--The AUSTRALIA--The <i>Sydney-Emden</i>
fight at Cocos.</b></blockquote>

<p>Amid all the distractions which have been described, the
Commonwealth Parliament found occasion to exercise powers in a great
variety of instances, and it laid down lines of policy which must
influence Australia for many generations to come. Together with the
subjects already mentioned, there was legislation under at least thirty
of the thirty-nine paragraphs of the section of the Constitution
wherein Commonwealth powers are defined; in addition to which many laws
were passed on subjects over which the Commonwealth has exclusive
jurisdiction, and some highly important machinery measures, to enable
the processes of government to work efficiently, were brought into
being.</p>

<p>About the choice of the site of the federal capital there was
thorough inquiry by experts and by members of Parliament. At first, in
1904, Dalgety, on the Monaro tableland, was selected--certainly a
beautiful site, watered by the Snowy River, ringed round with
mountains, and with the huge mass of Kosciusko dominating the
landscape. But the choice did not give pleasure to a number of
influential persons in New South Wales, and before the steps necessary
for commencing to mark out the federal territory were taken a feeling
that the subject should be reconsidered gained ground in Parliament. It
was rumoured that Watson had found a place called Canberra some sixty
miles to the north of Dalgety, and consequently nearer to Sydney, which
would meet the requirement far better. A ballot was taken in 1908, with
the result that Canberra was finally selected by the Parliament. The
New South Wales Government facilitated the acquirement by the
Commonwealth of an area of 900 square mile with a strip of land running
down to the sea at Jervis Bay where also two square miles of land were
ceded for the purposes of a Commonwealth port and naval base. The
required area was formally handed over by New South Wales to the
Federal Government in 1909. The first meeting of the Commonwealth
Parliament at Canberra occurred in May 1927, when the new Parliament
House was formally opened by H.R.H. the Duke of York.</p>

<p>The manner in which British New Guinea was annexe was described in
Chapter XXV. The cost of administering the territory had been shared by
the States, but it was felt to be proper that the Commonwealth should
undertake the responsibility. An Act for this purpose was passed in
1905. By this measure the old Portuguese name of Papua was restored.
The Possession has since been a dependency of the Commonwealth, and is
governed by a Lieutenant-Governor and Council, very much as a British
Crown Colony is ruled.</p>

<p>The Northern Territory, that great slice of central and northern
Australia which South Australia had undertaken to manage, became a
Commonwealth possession in 1911.</p>

<p>Norfolk Island, which had been a dependency of New South Wales since
1788, was taken over by the Commonwealth in 1914.</p>

<p>A question of vital interest to Western Australia was that of the
construction of a railway connecting Perth with the eastern States.
Forrest was wont to say that the principal reason which led the western
State to join the Commonwealth was that assurances were given to him
that the railway would be built. The railway, he maintained, was the
inducement offered to Western Australia, just as the possession of the
federal capital within her territory was the inducement to New South
Wales. But the Constitution imposed no obligation to construct the
line, and nobody had any authority to pledge the Commonwealth in
advance to do anything which the Constitution did not require to be
done. The alleged compact may not have weighed with the Federal
Parliament, but the undesirableness of having a whole State cut off by
a great distance from the rest of the Commonwealth, without railway
connection, certainly did. If only for military reasons, it was felt
that the chain of steel should be forged. The project was promised in
the programme of the Barton Government in 1901, and had been part of
the policy of every successive Ministry. The whole of the Western
Australian members were continually insistent about it. At length, in
1907, an Act was passed providing money for the survey of the 1,051
miles of route between Port Augusta, at the head of Spencer's Gulf, and
Kalgoorlie, in the western State, whence a railway already ran to
Perth. The surveyors found, as was expected, that the country to be
traversed by the line is largely unfit for human habitation; but they
also found plenty of good grass-land which in favourable seasons will
be valuable. Acting on the surveyor's report, the Fisher Government, in
1911, secured the passage of a measure to authorise the construction of
the line. It was opened for traffic in 1917.</p>

<p>Very much of the energy, and a large expenditure of the passion, of
political parties has been devoted to efforts to amend the
Constitution. That instrument itself provides the machinery for its own
alteration. A proposed law having amendment in view must first be
passed by an absolute majority of each house of Parliament; it must
then be voted upon by the people; and if a majority of the electors
voting, in a majority of the States, signify their approval, the
Constitution is altered accordingly. The Labour Party, after failing to
carry out its designs in reference to the scope of the Conciliation and
Arbitration Act and the control of commercial trusts and monopolies,
decided to ask the people to amend the Constitution in two aspects
mainly. First, they desired to remove the limitation which confined the
jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court to industrial disputes
extending beyond the limits of any one State. They wished to give power
to the Court to act as to wages and conditions of labour and employment
in any trade, industry, or calling, including disputes which might
arise among the employees of state railways. Secondly, they wished to
have power to make laws for the control of commercial corporations, for
regulating trade and commerce within any State as well as inter-state,
and for 'nationalizing' any industry which Parliament might declare to
be 'the subject of any monopoly.'</p>

<p>These propositions were first submitted to the electors in 1911, but
were rejected by five States out of the six--Western Australia being
the only State favourable to the enlargement of federal power.
Regardless of this defeat, the Labour Party, considering that it could
make little headway with its policy without the proposed amendments of
the Constitution, submitted them to a second referendum in 1913. They
were then carried by three States, Western Australia, South Australia,
and Queensland but were rejected by the other three. Failing a majority
in a majority of States, the attempt failed again. But the affirmative
votes in 1913 showed a marked advance on those recorded in 1911. Then
the Labour policy was rejected by majorities of over a quarter of a
million. In 1913, however, the difference between success and failure
was very narrow-less than 30,000. Encouraged by the advance, the party
nailed its flag to the mast and announced that it would try again; and
there would have been a third referendum on the same questions at the
end of 1915 but that the outbreak of the European War induced the
dropping of schemes of constitutional alteration.</p>

<p>One of the strongest reasons for the formation of the federal union
was in order that a better defence system might be adopted for
Australia. Before 1901 each of the six States had its own little
military force, under the command of an officer engaged from the
British Army; and each contributed towards the upkeep of a squadron of
the Imperial Navy, under a Rear-Admiral, which was maintained in
Australian and New Zealand waters. But there was no attempt at
co-operation between the six military forces. There was no unity of
command. There was no common system of training and equipment. If
Australia had had to fight for her existence, whatever co-ordination
there was would have had to be arranged at the last moment and in the
face of the enemy. The forces were militia, with a small corps of
garrison artillery in each capital city. There were also small naval
forces in some States. But these were not the main factors in the
defence of Australia. Everybody knew that, regardless of geography, the
country nestled under the lee of the great and efficient navy
controlled from Whitehall.</p>

<p>Very early in the history of the new Commonwealth the question of
the efficiency of the defence system and of whether it was on proper
lines forced itself on public attention. In 1903 a new naval agreement
with the Admiralty had to be made, to replace the old agreement between
the Admiralty and the separate States. Barton had made an arrangement,
subject to ratification by Parliament, that the Commonwealth should
contribute a subsidy of 200,000 pounds per annum towards the cost of
the squadron. He managed to carry it, but experienced great difficulty
in doing, so. The idea of a subsidized navy was objectionable to many.
Had not the time arrived when Australia should make provision for her
own defence, both naval and military?</p>

<p>This view was emphatically urged by many influential men and
journals--notably by the Sydney <i>Bulletin</i>, which during the early
years of federation, when policy was being formulated, rendered
memorable service by some remarkably clear thinking and forcible
writing about problems of the future. 'The alternative to the naval
tribute proposed by Mr. Barton,' wrote this journal in 1902, 'is the
expenditure of a like sum of money, or if necessary a much larger sum
of money, on an Australian Navy. This Navy would, in times of peace, be
used as a training squadron for Australian men. In times of war it
would be available for the defence of Australia, and, there is no
doubt, for the assistance of Great Britain in other waters if that were
called for.' That passage embodies the view which eventually gained
general acceptance. It seemed in advance of the probabilities in 1902,
but there is a very remarkable likeness between what was then proposed
and what ultimately happened.</p>

<p>If anyone had predicted before 1900 that Australia, with her
democratic tendencies, would be the first portion of the British Empire
to adopt compulsory military service, he would have been deemed absurd.
But, as the defence problem was more thoroughly studied, men asked
themselves why it should be considered undemocratic to compel citizens
to train themselves for the defence of their country. The payment of
taxes is not voluntary, though it is never very agreeable. The
observance of health acts and factory regulations is not voluntary.
Why, then, men said, should it be left to the choice of the individual
as to whether he should make himself efficient to defend the country
whose protection he enjoys? And, if a democracy was not prepared to
defend itself, had it any more reason to expect that it would survive
than other forms of government had done elsewhere?</p>

<p>A remarkable circumstance affecting the new Australian defence
policy was that, although the political parties of the country were
bitterly at enmity, as shown in the previous chapter, they all, at
about the same time, became converts to the principle of compulsory
military service, and all became eager supporters of the establishment
of an Australian Navy. Indeed, after these two things had been enacted,
there was some brisk controversy as to which party had first proposed
them. Defence became a nonparty issue. At one time it seemed that there
could not be such a thing as a non-party issue in Australian politics;
But these two very far-reaching changes did actually attain to that
unique distinction.</p>

<p>During the first eight years of the Commonwealth its defence
legislation made no radical departure from old methods. But opinion had
been ripening, and in 1909 Deakin introduced the first measure which
embodied the principle of compulsory military training. It also made
provision for establishing a military college for the education of
officers. The bill passed through Parliament, but, before the
proclamation which was to bring it into operation was issued, the
Deakin Government was ejected from office. The Fisher Ministry gave its
wholehearted support to the compulsory principle, but amended the Act
of 1909 in several important respects by an Act of 1910, which was
introduced by Senator Pearce, who was Minister of Defence in all the
Labour Governments after the first one. Many amendments were made on
the advice of Lord Kitchener, who visited Australia at the invitation
of the Commonwealth Government in 1909, made a thorough study of the
strategic requirements of the country, and inspected its troops during
field manoeuvres. Lord Kitchener prepared a report containing many
valuable recommendations, which the Government was glad to accept.</p>

<p>Under these Acts provision was made for training lads in two
classes, junior and senior cadets, and young men between the ages of
eighteen and twenty-six. All male persons liable for training were
required to register; and heavy penalties were imposed for evasion of
service, or, in the case of an employer, for preventing an employee
from rendering the personal service required of him.</p>

<p>The fundamental defence Acts of 1909-10 were amended in detail, as
experience showed alterations to be desirable; but their main
principle, that of liability to be trained for defence, became a fixed
part of Commonwealth policy. A military college was opened in 1911 at
Duntroon, within Commonwealth territory, for the training of officers,
entrance to it being by competitive examination. A naval college was
also established at Jervis Bay.</p>

<p>A wide departure was made when the Commonwealth resolved to build a
navy of its own, and to, make provision for manning it with Australian
seamen. Expert opinion in Great Britain was divided as to the
expediency of having separate navies within the Empire, but at an
Imperial Defence Conference, held in London in 1909, both the
Australian and the Canadian representatives made it clear that the
Commonwealth and the Dominion desired to build up what were called
local navies. The Admiralty thereupon gave its most valuable advice,
and a scheme was prepared to enable Australia to get the best service
possible within her means. Rear-Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson was sent
out to examine sites for naval bases, and to advise generally; and his
report (1911) like that of Lord Kitchener on military defence, was
taken as a basis upon which the Government could proceed with a naval
scheme.</p>

<p>Great impetus was given to the movement for creating an Australian
Navy by the revelations of the desperate efforts which Germany was
making to build a fleet of battleships which, professedly, were
designed to challenge the sea supremacy of Great Britain. In no part of
the British Empire was the significance of this development more fully
appreciated than in Australia, whose people thoroughly realized that
the safety of their country depended upon the sea power of the
motherland. A movement was started to present a Dreadnought to the
Imperial Navy, but a more far-sighted realization of the needs of the
situation insisted that a comprehensive naval scheme was required; and
the Imperial Defence Conference of 1909 brought forth a clear set of
principles and a programme of development which satisfied those who
wished to work for an Australian Navy. To a very large extent,
therefore, the new Navy grew out of the peril disclosed by the
revelations as to German preparations.</p>

<p>But it was recognized quite frankly by the most thorough supporters
of an Australian naval policy that unity of direction was essential in
naval warfare. It was not desired to place up-to-date and well-armed
ships in Australian waters, and leave them there in time of war without
regard to the requirements of Imperial naval strategy. The legislation
affecting the Navy therefore provided that in time of war the squadron
should automatically pass under the control of the Admiralty; and that
step was taken immediately after war broke out between Great Britain
and the Germanic Powers on August 4, 1914.</p>

<p>The British Government treated Australia very generously once the
new policy had been decided upon, handing over to the Commonwealth, as
a free gift, the whole of the building and equipment at the naval base
at Sydney. The Admiralty also offered to contribute a quarter of a
million pounds per annum to the upkeep of the Australian squadron,
recognizing its value in the protection of British interests in the
Pacific and the East. This offer, however, was declined, the
Commonwealth preferring to defray the whole cost itself.</p>

<p>The <i>Australia</i>, flagship of the fleet, a battle-cruiser of the
very rapid, heavily-armed <i>Indomitable</i> type, was completed in
1913, and her arrival in Australian waters in that year was convincing
evidence that the new naval policy was in operation. In a little over a
year that policy was justified in a very startling manner, when the
great European War broke out, and German cruisers were at large in the
Pacific. Australian ports would have been good targets for the guns of
Admiral von Spee's squadron but for the presence of the
<i>Australia</i>, with her great superiority of speed and gunnery. Two
smaller cruisers, the <i>Sydney</i> and the <i>Melbourne</i>, also
arrived from England, where they were built, in 1913. The fight of the
former with the German cruiser <i>Emden</i> at Cocos Island on November
9, 1914, gave the young Australian Navy its first battle experience,
and the opportunity was very worthily seized. The <i>Australia</i>
remained as the most powerful vessel in the Australian fleet until
1924. Under the conditions of the international agreement made at a
conference at Washington in 1921, the naval forces of all the Powers
were reduced. The <i>Australia</i> was one of the ships condemned to be
destroyed. She was then obsolete as a ship of war; but a certain
sentiment attached to her as the first Australian capital ship to take
part in great naval operations. As, however, she had to be destroyed,
she was for the last time put under steam on the morning of April 12,
1924, steered outside the heads of Port Jackson, and sunk in the
Pacific.</p>

<p>At midnight on August 4, 1914, messages were telegraphed from London
to all parts of the British dominions announcing that a state of war
with the German Empire existed from that hour. Australia was prepared
for the news. Information from the Imperial Government had warned
Commonwealth ministers, and the cablegrams in the newspapers had kept
the public informed of the intense anxiety and breathless suspense
existing in Europe during the interval between the assassination of the
heir to the Austrian throne, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, at Sarajevo,
on June 23, and the ultimatum presented by Austria to Serbia on July
23. The probability that if a war broke out, as a consequence of this
crime in the Balkans, it would be a world war, was perhaps realized
only by those who were close students of foreign politics. Day by day
the news flashed through the cables that Serbia, though innocent of all
official knowledge of the murder, which was committed in Austrian
territory, had accepted practically all Austria's demands, but that
Austria nevertheless continued to mobilize her forces with a view to
crushing Serbia; that Russia had intimated that she would be compelled
to intervene it Serbia were attacked; that Germany would in that event
hurl her huge army against Russia; and that France, faithful to her
alliance with Russia, would then make war on Germany.</p>

<p>The British Foreign Office was exerting its utmost efforts to
preserve the peace; and for a few hours, on July 30 and 31, a spark of
hope flickered fitfully, flattering the optimism of those who thought
that these exertions would be successful. Both Russia and France gave
undertakings to Great Britain that they would not commit any aggressive
acts against Germany, or do anything to spoil the negotiations that the
Foreign Office was conducting, with the aim of holding back the deluge
of war. But on July 31 Germany served Russia with an ultimatum
demanding that she should countermand her military preparations within
twelve hours; and on August 2 German troops invaded Luxemburg, a
neutral state lying between her territory and France.</p>

<p>During these anxious days the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
in London thrice warned the German Government that if Belgium were
invaded, the treaty engagements under which Great Britain was bound to
maintain the neutrality of that country would be honoured. But Germany,
having declared war on Russia on August 1, and having planned to attack
Russia's ally, France, by an invasion through Flanders, demanded of
Belgium on August 3 that permission should be given for German troops
to march through. Permission was refused by the Belgian Government. The
German Government thereupon threatened to compel Belgium by force of
arms to permit her territory to be used for an attack on France. The
King of the Belgians on August 4 appealed to Great Britain to safeguard
the integrity of his country, and a promise that this would be done was
promptly given. The British Foreign Office at the same time telegraphed
to Berlin that unless satisfactory assurances were given by 12 o'clock
that night, the British Government would feel bound to take all steps
in its power to uphold the neutrality of Belgium. The German Chancellor
expressed to the British ambassador his astonishment that Great Britain
should be prepared to go to war to uphold her treaty engagements--'just
for a scrap of paper.' As the undertakings required were not given, war
was declared. Of all the stages in the process of precipitating the
civilized world into disaster, the Australian public was well
informed.</p>

<p>When this calamity broke upon the nations, Australia was in the
midst of a domestic political crisis. The Cook Government, which
attained office after a general election in June 1913, submitted to
Parliament two bills, which had been passed by the House of
Representatives, but were rejected by the Senate. The Commonwealth
Constitution (section 57) provides that if the Senate rejects a bill
which has been passed by the House of Representatives, or makes
amendments in it which the House will not accept, and if after an
interval of three months the House of Representatives again passes the
bill, and the Senate again refuses to accept it, the Governor-General
may dissolve both Houses simultaneously. In the first half of 1914
bitter controversy raged over the two measures which the Cook
Government, with its very fragile support, insisted on forcing through
Parliament. Twice were the bills, which were submitted as 'tests,'
driven through the House of Representatives, though the casting vote of
the Speaker was the only nail on which the fate of the Government hung.
Twice were the bills rejected by the Senate, where the Labour majority
regarded the threat of a double dissolution as 'bluff.' On July 30 the
Governor-General, on the advice of ministers, decided to use his power
under section 57, and dissolved both Houses. Australia was, therefore,
busily occupied with preparations for the general election, which took
place on September 5, at the time when the great guns were thundering
on two fronts in the deadly conflict in which the great Powers of the
world were locked.</p>

<p>Both the Prime Minister who was in office at the time of the
commencement of the war, Cook, and the leader of the Opposition,
Fisher, were agreed as to what the imperative duty of Australia was.
Cook said on July 31: 'whatever happens, Australia is a part of the
Empire and is in the Empire to the full; when the Empire is at war,
Australia is at war.' Fisher was equally emphatic: 'Should the worst
happen after everything has been done that honour will permit, we
Australians will help and defend the mother country to our last man and
our last shilling.'</p>

<p>When the electors of Australia went to the poll, therefore, they had
before them the plain assurances of both the party leaders that
Australia would be faithful to her obligations. Some party leaders,
including W. M. Hughes, urged that a way should be found for avoiding
an election in such circumstances. What were the manoeuvrings of
political groups in comparison with the magnitude of the issues at
stake? Australia's very existence as a free democracy was menaced; for
it was keenly realized that the triumph of Germany in the war would
mean a redistribution of territories such as, in past great wars, had
transferred the sovereignty of vast dominions.</p>

<p>But the constitutional wheels had been set revolving, and they had
to grind on till a new Parliament emerged. The result was that the
strength of the Labour Party was increased from 37 to 42 in the House
of Representatives, and from 29 to 31 in the Senate. The Cook
Government fell, and Andrew Fisher became Prime Minister for the third
time on September 14. It was under his administration, and particularly
under the direction of his experienced Minister of Defence, G. F.
Pearce, that the first contingents of the Australian Army steamed away
to war. Within about a month of the declaration of war Australian and
New Zealand ships and troops had lowered the German flag in every one
of the possessions of that Empire in the Pacific. On August 31 Samoa
was surrendered to the AUSTRALIA. Early in September the Union Jack was
hoisted at Rabaul, the capital of German New Guinea (Kaiser Wilhelm's
Land), and at Herbertshohe, the administrative centre of the Bismarck
Archipelago.</p>

<p>Within four days of the outbreak, the Inspector-General of the
Australian military forces, Major-General Sir William Bridges, had,
with his staff, worked out the details for the organization of the
Australian Expeditionary Force--the A.I.F. The call for enlistment
evoked an enthusiastic and eager response from every quarter of the
continent. Training camps were established. All the resources the
Government could command were strained to the utmost to produce
equipment, uniforms, and all the multiple requirements of an army.
Steamships were chartered to transport men and horses. With marvellous
rapidity an army nearly as large as the British part of the army
commanded by Wellington at Waterloo, was fitted out for service,
complete to the last button; and within eight weeks of the declaration
of war it was ready to leave for the front. That its departure was
delayed was due to the fact that the sea was not yet sufficiently
secure for a large flotilla to be moved.</p>

<p>The transports were concentrated at King George's Sound. Thither
steamed from all the Australian States and from New Zealand the ships
crowded with troops--thirty-eight ships, convoyed by the Australian
cruisers <i>Melbourne</i> and <i>Sydney</i>, the British cruiser
<i>Minotaur</i>, and the Japanese cruiser <i>Ibuki</i>. On the early
morning of November 1 this great fleet, each unit in its appointed
place in the long rank, the four protecting cruisers one ahead, one
astern, and one on each flank, headed for the Indian Ocean on the
voyage to Egypt, where the army was to undergo its last stages of
war-training to prepare it for the desperate enterprises which lay
ahead.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war Germany had in the Pacific two fast
modern cruisers, the <i>Gneisenau</i> and the <i>Scharnhorst</i>, and
two light cruisers, the <i>Emden</i> and the <i>Koenigsberg</i>. The
<i>Australia</i>, the flagship of the Australian Navy, was a more
powerful and a swifter ship than either of the German large cruisers,
and either the <i>Sydney</i> or the <i>Melbourne</i> was capable of
destroying the other two. But for some weeks after the commencement of
hostilities the commodore of the German squadron, Von Spee, managed to
conceal the whereabouts of his vessels. Occasionally fragments of
wireless messages were picked up, but Von Spee, who probably knew that
he must be annihilated some time by superior force, was resolved to do
as much damage as he could before he went to the bottom. The
<i>Australia</i> searched for him in the vicinity of the German Pacific
possessions, but he was careful to keep far enough away from the range
of her guns. The <i>Emden</i>, commanded by Karl von Muller, was known
to be somewhere in the Indian Ocean when the first contingent left
Australia. This vessel had been playing the part of the bull in the
china shop among the British mercantile marine in eastern seas. In two
months von Muller had sunk or captured seventeen ships. Only a day or
two before the A.I.F. left King George's Sound, the <i>Emden</i>,
disguised by a dummy funnel and a neutral flag, dashed into Penang
Roads, torpedoed a French destroyer and a Russian cruiser, and swiftly
vanished again. If this busy little hornet of the sea could have got
among the thirty-eight transports at night, it would have found fierce
employment for its sting. As long as the <i>Emden</i> was afloat the
ocean routes were not safe, and news of its whereabouts was eagerly
desired.</p>

<p>On the morning of November 9 the fleet was about fifty miles from
Cocos Island, a small coral atoll in the Indian Ocean, in latitude 12
degrees 5 minutes S., longitude 90 degrees 55 seconds E. The wireless
station upon the island, before 7 o'clock, sent out the S.O.S. call for
help, with the message that a strange ship of war was approaching. The
message was repeated a few minutes later. After that the Cocos wireless
station ceased to answer calls. It was conjectured that the
<i>Emden</i> was the ship mentioned, and the <i>Sydney</i> (Captain
Glossop) was ordered off at the top of her speed to investigate. By 11
o'clock the <i>Emden</i> was a shapeless heap of scrap iron on the
palm-fringed beach of North Cocos. It had fought a gallant running
battle for more than an hour, but its 4 in. guns afforded no effective
answer to the 6 in. guns of the <i>Sydney</i>.</p>

<p>The first phase of warfare in which Australian military forces were
occupied was in beating off a Turkish attack upon the Suez Canal in
February 1915. Turkey entered the war as an ally of the Germanic powers
in the previous October, against the wishes of the Sultan and the Grand
Vizier, whose hands were forced by a military party led by Enver Bey,
who was manipulated by German officers. The objects of the Turkish move
against the Suez Canal were, first, to deprive Great Britain of one of
her most important maritime routes, and secondly to stimulate a Moslem
rising m Egypt. The attack was made on February 2. It was met by a
force of English, Indian, and Australian troops--these commanded by
Brigadier-General McCay. After three days' fighting the Turkish effort
withered away, and no later attempt to capture the Suez Canal zone was
dangerous.</p>

<p>The great movement in which the Australians and New Zealanders
participated during the first year of the war was one wherein their
valour won for them supreme renown and honour. It was the assault upon
the Gallipoli Peninsula. The reasons why this enterprise was undertaken
were as follow.</p>

<p>The gigantic military struggle on the western front, in Flanders,
reached a deadlock. The first onrush of the German armies was stopped.
The German commanders had counted on crumpling up all resistance and
smashing their way through to Paris, where they would dictate terms to
the defeated Allies. These plans failed. But though the Germans were
held up by the French and British defences, they were strongly
entrenched in their own positions. Two great armies dug themselves in.
From their trenches and from the air they hurled at each other
thousands of tons of shells, bombs, and rifle bullets. Attacks and
counter-attacks at various points along the far-stretched lines were
successful, or they failed, whether undertaken by the Allies or by the
Germans; but ground gained one week was lost the next. The war had
become one of attrition. It was desirable to develop an attack in some
other direction, which might secure a successful conclusion. Further,
it was desirable to force the Dardanelles, wrench Constantinople from
Turkish control, cut off Turkey from the Germanic powers, and, by
opening the Black Sea, place Russia in easy communication with her
allies. Russia had great stores of wheat in her southern ports, which
she could spare for Great Britain and France, and she needed supplies
of war material, which the Allies could furnish. The clearing of the
Dardanelles, if it could be effected, would, as was said by the author
of the idea (Winston Churchill) mean 'victory in the sense of a
brilliant and formidable fact.'</p>

<p>In January 1915 the British War Council determined that the attack
upon the Dardanelles should be made. But the Turks, anticipating
trouble, had constructed strong fortifications upon the Gallipoli
Peninsula; and though some of the most powerful battleships in the
British Navy rained shell upon the works, the bombardment did little
towards reaching the object in view. The naval attack was a failure. It
became apparent that the goal would not even be in sight unless
military forces were landed, who would drive the Turks out of their
fortified positions. The mistake made from the beginning was in
attempting to open the Dardanelles by naval warfare only. In March,
therefore, it was determined to send an expeditionary force to the
Gallipoli Peninsula, and endeavour to destroy the Turkish batteries,
preparatory to sending ships through the Straits. The operations were
placed under the command of General Sir Ian Hamilton.</p>

<p>The Australian Army in Egypt, commanded by Lieut.-General Sir
William Birdwood, was ordered at the beginning of April to embark for
the island of Lemnos, which was selected as the base for the grand
attack upon Gallipoli.</p>

<p>Some weeks before the troops left Egypt on 'the great adventure,'
the name 'Anzac' had been coined. It was in the first instance simply a
word of convenience; it became a name hallowed by a tragic and glorious
history within that fatal year. A telegraphic code word was required.
The initial letters of the words 'Australian and New Zealand Army
Corps,' stencilled on cases of supplies, suggested to a clerk that
Anzac would be a useful short name for telegraphic purposes, and, with
General Birdwood's approval, it was adopted.</p>

<p>English as well as Australian troops took part in the Gallipoli
campaign. Here we are concerned only with the phases of the operations
which are relevant to this narrative; and even these can be related
only in outline. Any narrative which would do adequate justice to the
superb, reckless courage with which the landings were effected, to the
heroic fortitude with which every inch won from the Turks was held, to
the stubborn valour which marked the incessant fighting throughout the
occupation, would require not a few paragraphs, but more than one
volume.</p>

<p>On April 25 landings were forced at two places. Feint attacks were
simultaneously made at four other points, in order to occasion a
dispersal of the Turkish forces, and to conceal from them the exact
places which it was intended to hold. The 29th Division, consisting of
British regiments, in co-operation with a naval division and a French
contingent, landed at Cape Helles, the nose of the Gallipoli Peninsula.
The Anzacs landed at a little cove to the north of a rugged promontory
which the Turks called Gaba Tepe. By noon 10,000 men were ashore at
Anzac Cove. All the morning since dawn the transports from Lemnos had
been bringing up their freights of splendid men in the pink of
condition. The sun shone from a cloudless blue sky upon the sparkling
waters of the Aegean as the ships moved inshore. From the land defences
a hail of bullets spattered the sea, and shells from heavy howitzers
screamed through the air, dealing out death to many of the men in the
boats which dashed through the shallow waters from the transports to
the shore. One boat full of dead men drifted aimlessly in the surf.
Overhead, shells from the cruisers covering the landing poured upon the
Turkish positions. Seaplanes floated above the storm, reconnoitring,
and signalling messages to the officers.</p>

<p>Singing and shouting, the Anzacs scaled the cliffs, hundreds of them
mown down by the Turkish fire; but the dauntless remainder pressed on,
and dug themselves in on the top. The fighting was incessant from the
early morning of the 25th, all through that day, all through the night,
all through the following day. Not for a moment did the rattle of rifle
fire and the boom of the big guns cease. The losses were terrific--but
the landing was achieved; and that troops were able to gain a footing
at all on that steep and rocky peninsula, under constant fire from
concealed positions, was the result of a great feat of arms not
eclipsed for daring and endurance by any during the war.</p>

<p>The purpose of this desperate attempt, the conquest of the
peninsula, was never accomplished. Every phase of the campaign has been
the subject of controversy, and it will be discussed, in respect to its
origins, its probability of success had military effort accompanied
naval work from the beginning, the strategy, the command, the tactics,
and everything connected with it, as long as military history is
studied. To describe the many battles which raged on that narrow strip
of soil would be beyond the present purpose; merely to enumerate them
would be to dispose in a few words of splendid deeds of heroism wasted
on vain attempts. After the landing, and the failure of the Turks to
dislodge their assailants, there was a period of three months during
which the position was one of stalemate, resembling that on the western
front. In August, General Hamilton launched attacks on the mountain
range of Sari Bair, and 12,000 men went down in five days in the fierce
fights by which it was attempted to dislodge the Turks from that
stronghold. In the same month endeavours to capture fresh positions by
effecting a landing at Suvla Bay were defeated. The last battles were
fought during August 21 to 27, when the Anzacs set themselves to hurl
the Turks from an advanced post known as Hill 60. They gained the
crest, and dug themselves in, but the enemy were still in control of
the eastern slopes.</p>

<p>By the middle of August the purpose for which this deadly campaign
was undertaken, the capture of the Dardanelles, became regarded as too
costly and too little likely to be successful with the strength that
could be spared from the main theatre of war. General Sir Charles
Munro, who was sent out to take command in succession to General
Hamilton, reported that the position so far won on Gallipoli 'possessed
every possible military defect.' Lord Kitchener, the Minister of War,
visited the peninsula to form an opinion on the prospects. Munro
recommended withdrawal; Kitchener confirmed his judgment. The decision
to evacuate was arrived at on December 8. By the 20th, 80,000 men,
5,000 horses, and all guns and stores were removed. But 35,000 brave
men were left buried on that war-mangled piece of ground, of whom 8,500
were Australians.</p>

<p>Meanwhile fresh Australian contingents had been raised, equipped,
and trained; and from March 1916 until the close of the war these men
took part in the titanic military operations in France. They
distinguished themselves nobly in a series of great battles from July
1-31 on the Somme. The capture of Pozieres on the 24th, and the holding
of the place against wave after wave of fierce German counter-attacks,
was a singularly fine achievement. General Birdwood's Anzac corps, too,
played a valiant part in the holding of Bullecourt (May 1917), an
advanced salient against which the Germans hurled every weapon of
attack they possessed. For this work warm congratulations were won from
the Commander-in-Chief, Haig.</p>

<p>The capture of Messines Ridge (June 1917), the share taken in the
third battle of Ypres (November 1917), the defence of Amiens (March and
April 1918), and the defeat of the Germans at Villers Bretonneux (April
1918) were the most memorable and distinguished pieces of fighting by
Australians on the western front before the crowning glory of
August.</p>

<p>During 1918 the Australian divisions had been reorganized and placed
for the first time under the command of an Australian general.
Lieutenant-General Sir John Monash was an engineer by profession, a
graduate of the University of Melbourne in the three faculties of arts,
laws, and engineering. He was a man who was accustomed to undertaking
extensive and difficult enterprises. The tasks of the day, large or
small, presented themselves to his mind as problems to be solved; and
he brought to bear upon the military perplexities which confronted him
in war, exactly the same kind of rapid and devising intelligence as he
had been in the habit of exercising upon his professional work. Since
his youth he had served in the Victorian militia, and he had a flair
for soldiering. He was one of the earliest of those who presented
themselves for service in the A.I.F., and had endured the agonies and
disappointments at Gallipoli. Now, in the second half of 1918, he found
himself at the summit of his ambition as a soldier, in command of an
army corps of seasoned veterans, his own countrymen, men already famous
for their achievements and still eager for distinction. The troops and
officers serving in his command had a profound respect for his
intellect, and no general ever had more complete confidence in his
staff and men than Monash felt. That mutual trust was sorely tried and
completely justified during the great days of the third battle of the
Somme.</p>

<p>The task which the Australian Army Corps had before it was to break
through the German defences in the centre of a line which was to be
assaulted by the 4th British Army, commanded by General Rawlinson. The
Australians had the Canadians on their right, and English corps on
their left. The battle commenced shortly after 4 o'clock in the morning
on August 8. Before 6 o'clock the Australians had achieved the task
entrusted to them, and advanced, the Canadians keeping pace with them,
driving the Germans six miles beyond the line which they were holding
on the previous day. The highest tribute to the effectiveness of this
day's fighting that could be paid came from General Ludendorff, the
chief of the German staff, in the book which he wrote after the war,
that after August 8 he gave up the last vestige of hope.</p>

<p>From that date the Germans were kept 'on the run.' The Australians,
elated with victory, had a full share in keeping them moving eastward.
Day after day, following that wonderful beginning on the 8th, more and
more ground was won from the enemy. There was no looking back. By
September 18 the Allied Armies had advanced to the formidable
Hindenburg line, an immensely strong complication of trenches, three
deep, protected by machine guns, heavy artillery, barbed-wire
entanglements, and every device that science and ingenuity could
suggest to a resourceful enemy. The Australian Army Corps shared with
French, British, Canadian, and American troops the assault upon this
last outwork of the German defences, on September 18. The fighting was
severe, as indeed it had been since the beginning of these operations.
Between August 8 and October 5 the Australians had lost 8,700 men
killed and 24,000 wounded. But by the latter date the Hindenburg line
had been smashed and the Germans were in retreat. The Australians had
been fighting continuously for six months, and had earned the rest
which was granted to them. By that time the war was virtually over; for
though an armistice was not granted to Germany till November 11, her
war leaders knew that they were beaten long before that date. There was
no longer any doubt about the result.</p>

<p>In another theatre of war, meanwhile, in Palestine, Australian light
horse and camel corps, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir
Harry Chauvel, were engaged in important operations against the Turks.
The defeat of the enemy at Romani, and again at E1 Arish, in June 1916,
were the preludes to a series of battles fought on ground rich with the
history of three thousand years. The military map shows thirty-six
sites of battles between the Suez Canal zone and Damascus where these
splendid troops fought during 1916-18. Three battles were fought at
Gaza. Places famed in antiquity and modern times for their connection
with great events--Beer-sheba, Jaffa, Jerusalem, Jericho, Joppa, the
Jordan Valley, Galilee, and Tiberius--had fresh chapters in their long
and chequered history written during these campaigns in which the
bronzed men in brown uniforms from the southern continent swept the
Turks before them till Palestine was cleared. In the final offensive of
September 18, in which the whole operations were commanded by General
Allenby, with the Australian cavalry and camel corps as his swift and
terribly efficient thrusting weapon, Damascus was wrenched from the
Turks after a sovereignty of four centuries. The campaign ended its
unbroken spell of victory on October 30. It had been fought in great
heat and discomfort, and the supplying of a large mounted army fighting
in such difficult country was in itself a triumph of skilful
organization. No more brilliant military work was achieved anywhere
during the war than during the Palestine campaign; and throughout the
country's thousands of years of history no more splendid spectacle was
witnessed in it than the advance of Chauvel's massed squadrons of
camels and cavalry, ever victorious where Napoleon sustained
defeat.</p>

<p>The Australian soldier established for himself on these campaigns on
Gallipoli, in Flanders, and in Palestine a reputation for courage,
resource, endurance, and intelligent initiative which filled his
countrymen with pride and experienced soldiers with admiration. Marshal
Foch, summing up their qualities after the war, said of them: 'From
start to finish they distinguished themselves by their endurance and
boldness. By their initiative, their fighting spirit, their magnificent
ardour, they proved themselves to be shock troops of the first
order.'</p>

<p>We turn now to the occurrences in Australia during the war. In
October 1915 Andrew Fisher resigned the Prime Ministership on accepting
the post of High Commissioner in London. His successor at the head of
the Government, William Morris Hughes, held that office during a most
anxious and eventful period in the history of Australia, from October
1915 to February 1923. It is the fate of politicians who attain to high
rank to endure violent alternations of popularity and disfavour, and
Hughes experienced both in uncommon measure. He evoked enmities by his
policy and by his methods. But only a churlish and rancorous opponent
would deny that his fervent Celtic temperament was deeply stirred by
the war, and that, realizing its fateful significance for Australia, he
devoted himself unsparingly to stimulating the spirit of her people and
maintaining the effectiveness of her armies.</p>

<p>In 1916, after a visit to Great Britain and to the battlefields of
France, Hughes came to the conclusion that the need for reinforcements
was so serious that every capable man of military age in Australia
ought to be pressed into service. His Government and his parliamentary
party were sharply divided on the issue. One of the members of the
Cabinet resigned as soon as the question of conscription was raised.
Hughes agreed that if during a stipulated period voluntary enlistment
proved sufficient to keep the army up to strength, he would not press
conscription upon the country. But the numbers required were not
realized. There was also the difficulty that he could not count upon
sufficient votes in the Senate to carry a bill enacting conscription.
It was therefore determined to take a referendum of the people on the
question: 'Are you in favour of the Government having in this grave
emergency the same compulsory powers over citizens in regard to
requiring their military service for the term of this war, outside the
Commonwealth, as it now has in regard to military service within the
Commonwealth?' The voting took place on October 28, 1916. There were
affirmative majorities in three States--Victoria, Western Australia,
and Tasmania. The total number of affirmative votes was 1,087,557; but
the negative votes numbered 1,160,033.</p>

<p>Hughes's action in this matter destroyed him as leader of the Labour
Party. There had been signs of revolt against his leadership before the
conscription issue was raised, but this policy brought the movement
against him to a crux. His parliamentary party held a meeting (November
16) at which a motion was submitted expressing the party's lack of
confidence in him. He met it by leaving the room, followed by
twenty-four members who approved of his policy. His Government was at
once reconstructed, four ministers being among the opponents of his war
policy. The Labour Party as it had existed before the emergence of this
crucial issue, which was canvassed with an intensity of bitterness
exceeding anything known in Australian politics hitherto, went to
pieces.</p>

<p>Hughes now depended for his parliamentary support upon a party
consisting of the former Opposition, strengthened by those former
members of the Labour Party who bad followed him in November. Another
reconstruction of the Ministry was necessitated. The Australian
National War Government, which commenced in February 1917, consisted of
Hughes himself, still Prime Minister, and four of his old colleagues,
with five others recruited from the ranks of the old
Opposition--including Sir Joseph Cook and Sir John Forrest (who was
created a peer with the title of Lord Forrest of Bunbury in 1918, but
continued to sit as a member of the House of Representatives). The new
Government faced a general election in May 1917, and was returned with
strong majorities in both houses of the Parliament.</p>

<p>This Government was impressed with the need for obtaining recruits
in greater numbers than were coming forward for voluntary enlistment.
Moreover, conscription had been adopted in Great Britain, in New
Zealand, and in the United States, which had entered the war in 1917.
It was believed by ministers, and by many in the country, that the
Australian people would now be prepared to consent to compulsory
service being made the rule for the purpose of maintaining the strength
of the contingents which had been winning such fame in the war. The
Government explained, in a proclamation published throughout the
country, that they desired to ensure recruiting to the extent of 7,000
men per month, and that they proposed to ask for authority to call up
by ballot single men between the ages of 20 and 44, only to the extent
that voluntary enlistment did not provide the numbers required. To
attain this definite purpose the question was submitted to the electors
at the second referendum, on December 20, 1917: 'Are you in favour of
the proposal of the Commonwealth Government for reinforcing the A.I.F.
oversea?' Majorities against the proposal. were recorded in four
States--New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia. The
number voting in the negative was 1,181,747; the affirmative votes
numbered 1,015,159. Soldiers on service voted at both referenda, their
votes being included in the totals of the States to which they
belonged. The majority of the soldier votes was only slightly in favour
of the conscription proposal. At the first referendum they recorded
72,399 affirmative and 58,894 negative votes; and at the second
referendum 103,789 affirmative and 93,910 negative votes.</p>

<p>During the war Australia despatched 329,883 soldiers abroad. Of
these, 59,342 were killed and 166,818 were wounded or 'gassed.' The
cost of Australian war services from 1914 to the end of 1919 was
265,800,433 pounds. Up to 1939 the total, including the cost of
pensions to disabled soldiers and dependants, had mounted to over
925,000,000 pounds.</p>

<p>After the important part that Australia had taken in the war, it was
but fitting that her statesmen should be consulted as to the terms of
peace. A delegation from this country, headed by Hughes, participated
in the discussions which determined the terms imposed upon Germany and
the Germanic powers; and the treaty of Versailles, signed June 28,
1919, contained the signatures of the Prime Minister and the Minister
of Defence, Senator Pearce, as well as of the representatives of the
other British Dominions, and of the Great Powers which had formed the
Alliance during the war. Australia also accepted from the League of
Nations--which was established under the treaty of Versailles--mandates
for the administration of what had been German New Guinea and the
island of Nauru. The mandate made Australia responsible to the League
of Nations for the proper administration of these territories, and for
promotion of the material and moral well-being of the natives.</p>

<p>The Hughes Government continued till after a general election in
December 1922; but when the new Parliament met in February 1923 the
party which had hitherto supported the Prime Minister desired that a
change should be made. Hughes therefore retired, and the Prime
Ministership was attained by Stanley Melbourne Bruce, who had served as
a soldier in the war and was wounded on service. Bruce had found a seat
in Parliament, and was soon promoted to ministerial rank, entering the
Hughes ministry as Treasurer in 1921. His rise to the chief place in
Australian politics was without precedent for rapidity.</p>

WAR</h3>

<p>The period between the end of the first World War 1914-18 to the
outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 was one of chequered growth
for Australia as for many countries in the world. It was a period that
began with great hopes of building a new era of peace and prosperity,
with the League of Nations to settle disputes between countries and to
preserve the peace of the world. The countries of Europe in particular
had suffered so much from the war, and then from the disorders which
followed upon it and the Russian Revolution of 1917, that there was a
widespread longing for peace. What was needed was some machinery that
would settle international disputes without the disastrous resort to
war. The establishment of the League of Nations by the Treaty of
Versailles in 1919 was an attempt to fulfil these hopes, and it was
mainly due to the work of President Wilson of the United States that
this body was set up. But in 1920 Woodrow Wilson was defeated in the
American presidential elections, and the new Harding Administration
refused to have anything to do with the League of Nations or any
'foreign entanglements.' The new government in Soviet Russia also
refused to have anything to do with the League, saying that it was an
organization of 'imperialist and capitalist powers'; they accused it of
wanting to destroy the new socialist government of Russia. Thus the
League was weakened from the outset by the absence of some of the great
powers, whilst Germany was not admitted till 1926. In spite of this,
and in spite of economic difficulties and unrest, the countries of
Europe were not long in restoring the devastation caused by war, and by
1926 they had got back to normal peace-time conditions. For a few years
the chances of peace and prosperity looked bright, but at the end of
1929 a worldwide economic depression began to cause unemployment and
poverty on a large scale, and conditions grew worse for the next three
or four years. In this situation the various countries tried to solve
their own problems of unemployment by tariff duties, by prohibitions
and quotas on each other's goods. By doing so each of them added to the
difficulties of the others. In 1933 a World Economic Conference was
held to devise common action, but it was too late and it was a failure.
Meanwhile Japan had invaded Manchuria in 1931, and brought it under her
control, although China was a fellow-member of the League of Nations.
The League of Nations disapproved of the Japanese action, but as the
great powers were not willing to do anything to stop the Japanese there
was nothing the League could do about it. The seizure of Manchuria was
one of the ways in which Japan tried to find a way out of the
depression, so the setback to prosperity meant a setback to peace also.
In Europe, too, the depression provided an atmosphere favourable to
those elements which were opposed to the League of Nations and the
Treaty of Versailles. Quite soon after that treaty had been signed,
parties had risen in Germany and Italy which aimed at upsetting the
peace settlement. In Italy the Fascist party, as it was called, was
able to profit by a period of disorder and a weak government to seize
power in 1922, and Mussolini became dictator of Italy. The Fascists
were absolutely opposed to socialists, communists, and parliamentary
democracy, all of which were suppressed in Italy. Quite soon after the
end of the war a similar party had arisen in Germany, which called
itself the National Socialist (Nazi) party. It blamed Germany's defeat
on socialists, communists, and (for good measure) the Jews. The Nazis
claimed that Germany had not been defeated by the Allied armies in the
field, but by 'a stab in the back.' They were also opposed to the
League of Nations and parliamentary democracy, and wanted to tear up
the Treaty of Versailles. In 1923 they tried to seize power at Munich,
but the rising was a fiasco and Adolf Hitler, the Party leader, spent
nine months in gaol. During the next five years the Nazis made no
headway, but lost influence while Germany gained stability and
prosperity as a parliamentary Republic. But the depression gave Hitler
and the Nazis their opportunity. With over 6,000,000 unemployed, men
became ripe for any desperate remedies; many began to believe that the
Treaty of Versailles was the cause of all their troubles, and millions
flocked to Hitler's banner. In January 1933 the old President, von
Hindenburg, made Hitler Chancellor of Germany. The Nazis seized power,
and suppressed all their opponents; the Republic gave way to the Nazi
Empire. Germany left the League of Nations, and the Disarmament
Conference ended soon after in failure. Russia, fearing attack from
Germany, now joined the League of Nations, but again it was too late.
In October 1935 Italy invaded Abyssinia, though both countries were
members of the League of Nations, and Abyssinia was soon conquered. In
1936 both Germany and Italy assisted the revolt against the Spanish
Republican Government which was led by General Franco. After more than
three years of terrible fighting the Republicans were defeated, and
Franco set up a government somewhat similar to that in Italy and
Germany. By this time Germany, Italy and Japan had all signed a pact
which declared that communism was the great menace to world order and
peace, and that it must be destroyed. For some years it had been plain
that these Axis Powers (as they called themselves) were out to re-draw
the map of the world in their own interest, and were preparing for war
in order to do so. But there, were many people in Britain, America,
France and Australia who were unable or unwilling to see this fact.
Others hated the communists so much that they hoped Germany would
attack Russia. But most ordinary people had come to think of war as a
brutal and wasteful business, they found it hard to believe that anyone
would deliberately embark upon it. The leaders of the Axis countries
mistook this distaste for war for fear, and Hitler forcibly annexed
Austria (1938) and Czecho-Slovakia (1939). The British and French saw
they must call a halt to this method of altering the political
boundaries of Europe. They warned Hitler that any further aggression
would be resisted by force, and when the Germans invaded Poland both
Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3rd September, 1939. The
Australian Prime Minister, Mr. R. G. Menzies, announced the same day
that Australia was at war with Germany alongside Britain. For the
second time in twenty-five years Australia was involved in a world war
that had its origins in Europe. Such has been the background of
Australian history in the period since the Treaty of Versailles in
1919. Let us now look at what had been happening in Australia
itself.</p>

<p>The first ten years after the victory of the Allied Powers in 1918
were marked on the whole by prosperity and economic progress in
Australia. There was during this period a good deal of political strife
mainly over industrial matters arising out of a number of big strikes.
But on the whole people were busy making money and enjoying themselves
and, if some suffered distress from unemployment, for example in the
slump of 1920-21, the great majority were not much affected and
conditions soon improved. The world outside was prepared to buy our
wool, wheat, butter, fruit and metals, and to pay good prices for them,
so Australian production expanded in response to demand. The
Commonwealth and the State governments were busy promoting closer
settlement, and particularly in providing farms for returned soldiers
who wished to go on the land. They bought over 5,000,000 acres of
private land (for 29,000,000 pounds), and also set apart 23,500,000
acres of Crown Land for farms for soldier settlers. In the long run
Australia lost nearly 24,000,000 pounds on these ventures. But
meanwhile many ex-soldiers settled in the irrigation areas of the
Murray valley in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, and the
effect of this settlement can be seen in the great growth of production
of citrus fruits, dried fruits, table grapes and wine which took place
between 1919 and 1939. Other ex-soldiers took up wheat farming
(particularly in Western Australia), dairy-farming, or sheep-raising.
There were many others besides ex-soldiers who were also going into
farming, and in addition there were many being employed in factories or
other businesses in towns. During the war the number of factories in
Australia had grown considerably, partly because we could no longer get
the goods we had previously imported. In 1921 many of these war-time
industries succeeded in getting tariff duties to protect them from
overseas competition, and so not only farm production, but also factory
production entered upon a period of rapid expansion.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, not surprising that in these circumstances
governments and many people were confident and optimistic about our
future progress. At the census of 1921 the Australian population
numbered 5,436,000 and statesmen in this country and overseas thought
this number could be rapidly increased. They thought, moreover, that we
should have a bigger population in the interest of our security and
prosperity, as well as in the interest of the Empire as a whole. It was
simply a matter of 'men, money, and markets,' in the opinion of Mr. S.
M. Bruce, who was Prime Minister of Australia from 1922-1929. During
his term of office there was a considerable amount of unemployment in
Great Britain, and British leaders as well as Mr. Bruce thought it
would be a good idea to encourage emigration from Britain to Australia.
Britain was also willing to lend Australia money to enable her to
establish these settlers on the land, or in other employment. So in
1922 the British government passed the Empire Settlement Act so that it
could lend money on easy terms to the dominions, and help to pay the
passages of British emigrants. Three years later the Commonwealth
entered into an agreement with the British government whereby Britain
was to lend Australia 34,000,000 pounds on easy terms; in return
Australia was to take 450,000 British emigrants within ten years. This
was known as the '34,000,000 pounds Agreement.' The money was to be
used in building roads and railways, schools and hospitals and to
provide all the other public needs of a growing community. As a matter
of fact not 34,000,000 pounds, but more than ten times this amount
(410,000,000 pounds) was spent by Australian governments and public
bodies between 1919 and 1929 to promote settlement in Australia. Much
of this money (about 20,000,000 pounds each year) was borrowed in
London, and it played a big part in the prosperity of that period. For
a few years British immigrants came to Australia in large numbers, but
our population grew even more by natural increase. By the end of 1929
our population had grown by a million more than at the census of 1921.
We had certainly succeeded to a large extent in getting the men, and
even more in getting the money for settlement. But what about the
markets?</p>

<p>British and Australian statesmen had both thought that most of the
British immigrants would settle on the land, and produce farm products
that would be sold mainly in Britain. Great plans were made for closer
settlement in addition to the soldier settlements that already had been
started. The gigantic Hume Weir was planned to provide more water for
irrigation settlements. It was thought that the British market would
take all that could be produced, but the problem of markets was not so
simple. Within a few years there was such an increase of dried fruits
that prices fell, and growers were threatened with ruin. The
Commonwealth urged the British government to give a preference to
Australian wine and dried fruit, by putting a higher duty on foreign
than on Australian products. The British government was not keen to do
this, because Britain has to sell most of her exports to foreign
countries and they might retaliate by putting higher duties on her
goods. However, it was urged that Australia could not take so many
British immigrants unless this were done, so in 1925 the British
government gave way. But what was to happen when the British people had
all the raisins, currants, and wine they wanted? Other nations would
not be prepared to take them on better terms than were given to growers
in Greece or California. However, for the present the British market
served our needs. But meanwhile the dairy-farmers were also complaining
that their prices were not profitable enough; they complained that the
cost of the manufactured goods they had to buy was raised by the duties
on imports. They could not get these duties reduced, and Britain would
not put duties on foreign butter, so they could not get a British
preference. However, the Paterson Butter Plan gave them what they
wanted in 1926. Australian consumers were charged a higher price for
butter than it fetched on overseas markets, while New Zealand butter
was kept out by a duty. Similar arrangements were already being used
for dried fruits and sugar, and so the production of all these went on
increasing; so did the production of wheat, wool and metals. By 1929
there was a relative overproduction of primary products on the world's
markets; their prices dropped heavily and a world depression began that
was to have widespread and disastrous results. The causes were many and
complicated, and cannot be detailed here. We are more concerned with
its results for ourselves, but before looking at those we must notice
some other things that were happening in the expansive
nineteen-twenties.</p>

<p>In addition to the great growth in farm production there was a great
growth in the number of Australian factories and of the people employed
in them. Actually the value of factory goods grew faster than that of
farm products, and the number of factory workers certainly grew much
faster than those on farms. It was a period of great prosperity for
Australian manufacturers, and it was marked by the growth of the iron
and steel industry, textile manufactures, rubber goods and many other
things. We were making more and more things that had previously been
imported, and our people were becoming skilled in more and more
occupations, which of course is very desirable. But there were also
some disturbing features about this growth of manufactures, because
much of it was only possible because of high duties on imported goods.
We have already noticed how this had led Australian farmers to ask for
tariff duties and for financial assistance. But high duties also
enabled manufacturers to make good profits, and this encouraged wage
earners to ask for higher wages. This was only to be expected, and
their demands were hard to refuse because they were continually getting
stronger through their organization in trade unions. Accordingly there
were quite a lot of industrial disputes in these years, and some of
them were very bitter. In 1925 there was a great shipping strike
throughout Australia, and the Commonwealth government tried to deport
two of the seamen's leaders, Walsh and Johnson, on the ground that they
were 'undesirable immigrants.' The High Court held, however, that the
Commonwealth did not legally have power to do this. Trade unions
continued to press for higher wages and better conditions for their
members, and there was a good deal of industrial unrest. But when
prices and profits began to fall it was no longer possible to get these
demands granted. In 1928 and 1929 there were two big but unsuccessful
strikes by the timber workers and the waterside workers; in both cases
the men refused to accept an award of the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court. This Court, set up in 1904, had done a great deal to improve
wages and conditions, especially under the presidency of Henry Bourne
Higgins from 1907 to 1921. But the Prime Minister, Mr. Bruce, in 1929
decided that the system was not working satisfactorily, and proposed to
abolish the Commonwealth court, and to leave industrial arbitration to
the States. He was overwhelmingly defeated in the elections at the end
of 1929, and Labour returned to power under the leadership of Mr. J. H.
Scullin, after a period of 13 years 'in the wilderness.'</p>

<p>It was the misfortune of Mr. Scullin's government that it had to
grapple with the problems of the greatest depression in history. To add
to his difficulties the Labour party had been so long out of office
that all the old tried and tested leaders of Fisher's day were dead, or
retired from active politics. All except Mr. W. M. Hughes, who had left
the Labour party in 1916, and was now one of its chief political
opponents, although he frequently proved disconcerting to his own party
as well. Australia was feeling the effects of the world depression
through the fall in prices of primary products. Farmers in particular
were suffering a serious loss of income, and since they could not buy
so many manufactured goods, unemployment was growing in town and
country. To make matters worse, in these circumstances we could not
borrow overseas, so loans from Britain stopped and public works had to
be curtailed--result, more unemployment and poverty. There even began
to be a danger that our exports would not be able to pay for our
necessary imports together with the interest on the loans raised
overseas, mainly in London. The Commonwealth tried to avoid this danger
by reducing imports through higher duties; they even prohibited the
import of many luxury goods altogether. But although this helped us to
pay our interest bill, the situation continued to get worse. The
British government also gave some relief by cancelling the payments due
on our war debt to them; but this relief was also inadequate. So great
was the fall in prices of our exports that by 1931 importers were
willing to pay up to 130 pounds (Australian) in order to obtain 100
pounds sterling in London, so that they could carry on their business.
This fall in the value of the Australian currency in relation to
sterling, dollars, and francs gave some relief to those producing for
export, for it meant that for every 100 pounds sterling they received
in London they could get 130 pounds in Australia. At the end of 1931
the Commonwealth Bank took over this regulation of 'the rate of
exchange,' and fixed the rate at 125 pounds (Australian) for 100 pounds
sterling, and this rate has since been maintained. This certainly did
something to help our farmers and exporters, but meanwhile many other
difficulties plagued the harassed governments.</p>

<p>The fall in people's incomes meant that there was also a fall in the
revenue of the Commonwealth and State governments; they were unable to
meet their normal expenditure and 'balance their budgets.' It is not
difficult to understand why, when it is realized that the national
income (that is the total of people's incomes), fell by about 30 per
cent. during the worst of the depression. At first governments were not
inclined to reduce expenditure very much, and the Federal government
looked to the Commonwealth Bank to lend it money to tide it over its
difficulties. But in April 1931 the Commonwealth Bank Board told the
Federal government that the Bank could not lend them any more. The
Commonwealth government then proposed to alter the Commonwealth Bank
Act so as to make the Bank do what it wanted; but it did not have a
majority in the Senate, and the Senate refused to pass the bill. The
result was that the Commonwealth and State governments were now
compelled to reduce expenditure, and at a Premiers' Conference in June
1931 a plan was agreed on to reduce public expenditure by 20 to 25 per
cent. This 'Premiers' Plan' within a few years had the desired effect
of balancing budgets, and it did provide a policy for meeting the
depression. But it entailed severe sacrifices for many people. Salaries
of public servants were reduced, and there was much bitter opposition
from trade unions and wage-earners at this 'attack on the standard of
living.' However, this was the price that had to be paid in order to
get assistance from the banks, and it was made somewhat more acceptable
by the fact that all holders of government bonds had to accept a
similar reduction in interest. Without this it would have been
impossible to balance budgets. In addition the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court in January 1931 had ordered a 10 per cent. cut in the real basic
wage, so that there was a general reduction of wages, salaries, and
rates of interest. All incomes had suffered, and the reductions made
under the Premiers' Plan were advocated in the interests of 'equality
of sacrifice' as well as of balancing the budget. But many people
believed that these reductions, or much of them, could have been
avoided if the banks had acted differently. Labour's supporters began
to say it was a question of 'the people versus the banks,' and to blame
the Scullin government for accepting the 'Premiers' Plan.' This was
particularly so in New South Wales among the followers of Mr. J. T.
Lang, the Labour premier. He had also put forward his plan. The main
points of the 'Lang Plan' were that interest on government bonds should
be reduced to 3 per cent., and that Australia should pay no more
interest to British bondholders until they agreed to a similar
arrangement. He had a number of supporters in the Federal parliament,
where the position of the Scullin government was seriously weakened by
these divisions in the Labour ranks. Mr. Lang was really bent on
wrecking the 'Premiers' Plan,' and in November 1931 his supporters
voted with the opposition to defeat the Scullin government. J. A. Lyons
then left the Labour party to form a national (United Australia)
government, and became Prime Minister. The elections in the following
month, which were fought largely on the question of the nationalization
of banking, were an overwhelming defeat for Labour. For ten years
Labour was to remain out of office, and Joseph Lyons remained Prime
Minister until his death in April, 1939.</p>

<p>With the Lyons government in office the argument about a policy for
the depression was virtually settled, but Mr. Lang continued to resist
for a little longer in New South Wales. He had already in April 1931
failed to pay interest on overseas debt, but the Commonwealth
Government shouldered the responsibility. He introduced bills to reduce
interest in New South Wales, though these were blocked by the
Legislative Council. There was a run on the Savings Bank of New South
Wales, and it had to close in April 1931. Mr. Lang's policy caused such
strong feeling in New South Wales that his opponents organized a
semi-military body, the New Guard, to call a halt by force if need be.
Mr. Lang's supporters began to talk about 'the rise of fascism,' and
the situation was certainly disturbing. But in 1932 Mr. Lang by acting
unconstitutionally brought about his dismissal by the governor, Sir
Philip Game, and Mr. B. S. B. Stevens became premier. Again at the
ensuing elections in June 1932 Labour suffered heavy defeat, and
remained out of office for the next nine years. Mr. Lang himself
subsequently lost the leadership of the Labour party in New South
Wales, but Labour throughout Australia was for many years handicapped
by the dissensions which he caused in the movement.</p>

<p>Though the political issues were settled by June 1932 the economic
situation was still extremely bleak. Unemployment amongst trade
unionists had just reached the record figure of 30 per cent. of their
membership, and prices for exports were still extremely low. In July
1932 Australia sent representatives to an Imperial Economic Conference
at Ottawa, in an attempt, along with Britain and the other dominions,
to increase inter-Empire trade. The Ottawa Agreements provided that the
dominions should reduce the duty on British goods, and so increase the
tariff preference which they already had over foreign goods. Britain,
on the other hand, undertook to put tariffs on foreign goods, and to
admit Empire products at lower rates of duty. At last Britain had
succumbed to dominion and colonial pressure for Imperial Preference,
which had been shrewdly and steadily applied for some 25 years. The
result was that trade within the Empire certainly increased after 1932,
but it was very largely at the expense of foreign countries. It is very
doubtful whether the increased inter-Empire trade was worth the
worsening of international relations that followed. Moreover, although
the Ottawa Agreements gave some relief to Empire producers, they did
not solve all the problems of export production. It was impossible, for
example, for Britain and the Empire to buy even half the Australian
wool clip. For this, and for many other products, Empire producers had
to depend largely on sales to foreign countries. In 1938 Britain and
the dominions recognized that Ottawa had not really solved the problem;
to parody the words of Nurse Cavell, 'Ottawa was not enough,' what was
required was a recovery of world trade. Fortunately this did begin to
recover in 1933, and Australia benefited from it.</p>

<p>The years from 1933 to 1939 saw a marked economic recovery in
Australia, as in most other countries of the world, though there was
another temporary setback in 1938, owing to a fall in export prices. By
1937 the loss in national income had been completely restored,
unemployment had fallen to pre-depression levels, and wages were
restored to their previous levels and even above them. This recovery
was, of course, largely due to the rise in prices of our exports, but
it was also largely due to the policy followed in Australia. After 1931
the Federal government and the Commonwealth Bank worked harmoniously
together. The various governments carried out the 'Premiers' Plan,' and
the Commonwealth Bank helped them by providing money to meet deficits
until they could balance budgets. The Commonwealth and the States
through the Loan Council (established in 1928) also planned public
works for which the Bank helped to provide the funds. These works not
only helped to increase production and income, but also increased
employment. Private business also recovered, and in particular there
was a great expansion of manufacturing industry which surpassed all
previous levels of output and employment. In some ways the depression
had helped in this expansion. The fall in wages had reduced
manufacturers' costs and helped them against overseas competitors,
whilst keen competition forced them to be more efficient. In particular
there was a great expansion of iron and steel production; by 1934 it
passed all previous records, and then doubled in the next three years.
This was to be very useful to Australia when she found herself again at
war in 1939, for steel is essential for tanks and guns, battleships and
munitions. The companies which had exploited the mineral wealth of
Broken Hill began to make steel in 1915, and the Broken Hill
Proprietary Ltd. by 1937 was able to make steel as cheaply and
efficiently as anywhere in the world. It draws its iron ore from Iron
Knob in South Australia through the port of Whyalla, which has itself
become a steel producing and shipbuilding centre. But the main B.H.P.
works are at Newcastle, and they draw their coal from the company's own
mines in that district. Other industries like textiles, chemicals,
engineering and motor body works also expanded greatly, and proved
immensely valuable when war came. The production of aircraft was also
begun, and though this is an industry which takes time to establish
soundly, we have been able to produce hundreds of planes for service
duty. In the war of 1914-18 Australian armies were mainly equipped with
British guns, shells, and tanks, but in the Second World War we have
provided for practically all their needs except tanks, some aeroplanes,
and some other very specialized equipment. There was also a
considerable expansion of primary production, particularly in dairying,
and meat production By 1929 the number of sheep had just recovered,
after a period of droughts and low prices from 1890 to 1910, to the
figure reached in 1891 (106,000,000), but they went on increasing to
the record numbers of 116,000,000 in 1939. Production of butter,
cheese, meat, sugar and dried fruits also went on increasing, but the
wheat farmers still suffered adversity. Prices on the whole remained
low and unprofitable for many, and the area under wheat declined though
the production on the average showed no fall. A number of farmers gave
up wheat-growing for other occupations. Reviewing the period of the
depression and recovery, there were some exciting events when feelings
ran high and at times some people feared disorder and even
revolutionary risings. The communists were a bogey to the respectable
classes and much was made of the 'red menace,' particularly at
elections. But in actual fact their numbers were small and the danger
was exaggerated, although their ideas did gain more sympathy and
support in the dark days of depression. But as prosperity returned and
men got jobs and better wages, the influence of communist ideas
declined. The experience of the depression left its mark on peoples'
minds, however, and public opinion grew in favour of governments doing
more to control booms and slumps, and taking measures to protect people
from the disastrous effects of unemployment. Governments and the
Commonwealth Bank were both doing something in this direction, and in
1938 the Lyons government passed a National Insurance Act to insure
wage-earners against unemployment, sickness, old-age, and invalidity.
But many sections were dissatisfied with the actual measure, and it did
not come into operation.</p>

<p>The whole period from 1919 to 1939 appears, in fact, to have been
almost barren of great social reforms. It is in no way comparable to
the period before 1914, when old age pensions and industrial
arbitration were introduced, and the Commonwealth Bank established. We
do find some States passing social legislation; in particular
Queensland introduced Unemployment Insurance (1923), and New South
Wales introduced Child Endowment (1927). The Commonwealth had
introduced a limited scheme of child endowment for its own public
servants in 1920, but there was no system for Australia as a whole
until it was introduced by the Menzies government under the pressure
for higher wages in 1941. Australians seem to have been too complacent
about their 'high standard of living,' and to be unaware of the
improvements that were going on in other parts of the world. It is true
that they sent representatives to the annual conferences of the
International Labour Office, set up at Geneva in 1919 for the
improvement of social and labour conditions throughout the world.
Sometimes we even adopted the labour conventions framed at these
conferences in Geneva. But in general our representatives went in a
condescending manner, thinking they had nothing to gain by this
international co-operation. They were mistaken, for a number of
countries were outstripping us in the field of social legislation. We
have begun to realize this, and it is possible that after the war we
shall take steps to carry out considerable social reforms.</p>

<p>But though there was little that was new in the field of social
legislation, there was a considerable expansion of existing 'social
services,' and of expenditure on health, education, and social welfare.
Between 1914 and 1939 the expenditure on health, old-age and invalid
pensions, and maternity allowances, increased from 5,000,000 pounds to
34,000,000 pounds. Allowing for growth of population and changes in the
value of money, this represented a threefold increase in real
expenditure per head. Because of rising incomes per head people were
also able to make increased provision on their own account against old
age and infirmity, through savings banks, friendly societies, and life
assurance. In education, also, we find increased expenditure by
governments, but the increase is not nearly so marked as in the field
of health and social welfare. Australia, in fact, has been lagging
behind in the provision of educational facilities, and the time is ripe
for considerable improvement and extension of education. Both
Commonwealth and State governments were obliged to make large grants of
money during the depression for the relief of unemployment, but the
assistance given was not very adequate. Also since the amount of
assistance for each person was a matter for the States, it tended to
vary from one State to another. In the future we may hope to have a
high level of employment, and the Commonwealth has introduced a Social
Security Act (1944), so that those who may become unemployed will be
better cared for. It is worth noting that the death-rate in Australia,
and in particular the infant death-rate, are among the lowest in the
world. That is partly due to our relatively high income per head and
our healthy climate, but it is also due in large part to our public
health services and the increased expenditure on them. But there is
still room for improvement, and no grounds for complacency.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that population grew between 1929 and 1939
by only 560,000 compared with more than 1,000,000 in the previous ten
years. The depression largely accounted for this, since it discouraged
immigration and for five years out of the ten we actually lost people
by emigration. Taking the ten years as a whole we only gained about
10,000 people by immigration, whereas in the previous ten years we
gained nearly 330,000. The rest of the difference was accounted for by
a lower birth rate, which during these years began to cause grave
concern. Our population was just reaching 7,000,000 at the end of 1939,
but it was growing very slowly.</p>

<p>In the field of international relations we might also have done more
to shoulder our obligations and responsibilities. Certainly our
governments co-operated readily in the work of the League of Nations,
and we still pay our contribution to its work. But on the whole we have
not taken as much interest in foreign affairs and international
relations as we should. We have not made a special study of the needs
of other countries, especially our Pacific neighbours, nor of the ways
in which we might co-operate with them to our mutual benefit. We have
been ready enough to give assistance in times of disaster, for example
at the time of the great Japanese earthquake which destroyed most of
Tokyo in 1923. On the other hand we have been rather unaware of the
effects, for example, of our trade and tariff policies; these add to
the difficulties of Asiatic countries, which have a much lower standard
of living than ours. During the depression and the recovery our trade
with Japan increased greatly, in spite of the Ottawa Agreements, and
Japan became our second best customer. But in 1936 we suddenly made a
change in our trade policy, which discriminated sharply against both
Japan and the United States. This 'Trade Diversion' policy, as it was
called, was intended to give Britain a larger share of our market, but
it at once brought retaliation from both Japan and the United States
and loss to ourselves in trade and good relations with our Pacific
neighbours. We had to abandon the policy within a couple of years, but
much harm had been done. Again although Australia carried out all her
formal obligations to the League of Nations in this period, it may be
doubted whether our governments did all they possibly could to make a
success of the League. It is true that when the League 'imposed
sanctions' on Italy for attacking Abyssinia, Australia broke off
trading relations with Italy in accordance with the decision. But it
can hardly be said that our governments fully realized the importance
of making a success of the League in the interest of our own security
and well-being. It is probable that they still thought that in case of
war Britain and the rest of the British Commonwealth would be able to
guarantee our safety. This idea proved to be quite wrong in 1942, but
the possibility should have been seen at an earlier date. Even when it
became clear that the League, because of the vacillation of its leading
members, could not prevent aggression, our governments still seemed
blind to our danger. In 1936, when Italy had conquered Abyssinia, both
Germany and Italy were helping to overthrow the Spanish Republic in
order to forward their own designs in Europe. But our government was
reducing taxation, and our defence expenditure was insignificant.
Compulsory military training had been suspended by the Scullin
government in 1929 as an economy measure, and it was not re-introduced
till 1940. In 1937 the defence expenditure was increased to 11,500,000
pounds, which was much less than we were paying for old-age and invalid
pensions. Our military forces, however, were much less numerous than
old-age pensioners, and were totally inadequate for a war footing. Even
in 1938 after the 'Munich Crisis,' when war almost broke out in Europe,
our defence budget was only 16,800,000 pounds, although this was
revised at the end of the year when it was decided to spend 63,000,000
pounds on defence over the next three years. But this was quite
insufficient, and before another budget was presented Australia was at
war.</p>

<p>But if the expenditure on defence in the years immediately before
the war was inadequate, at least the Commonwealth government had made
some preparations in other directions. Steps had been taken for the
production of military aircraft in Australia, and in June 1939 the
Government compiled a National Register of manpower, industry and
private wealth, in order to organize our resources for war purposes. A
survey was also made of our resources of raw materials in order to
build up stocks of those which were essential, especially those which
had to be imported. These, and many other measures were taken, so that
when the long-threatened war occurred we would not be entirely
unprepared.</p>

<p>The Second World War was finally precipitated by the German invasion
of Poland on 1st. September, 1939. Great Britain and France declared
war on Germany on 3rd September. Russia remained neutral, having made a
non-aggression pact with Germany in August, 1939. As a result of this
agreement the Germans felt quite safe in attacking Poland, for they
knew quite well that Britain and France on their own could do nothing
to prevent its conquest. Within a month the Germans had defeated the
Poles, and Russia and Germany divided Polish territory between them.
The war then entered a stage of comparative inactivity. The British and
French were maintaining a naval blockade of Germany, and there was some
activity by sea. German submarines sank Allied vessels, and they in
turn were hunted by Allied warships. But little else happened, and it
is not surprising that in America someone coined the phrase that it was
a 'phoney war.' The United States was neutral; so were Italy and Japan
at this stage. Only France and Britain, together with the members of
the British Commonwealth, were at war with Germany. And even of the
British dominions Eire remained neutral. The Germans said that France
and Britain might as well accept the conquest of Poland, and make
peace; the Russians agreed with them. But the British and French
leaders knew by now that hat there would be no peace, but only an
uneasy truce until Hitler was ready to pounce again. The Russians
really knew this too, and occupied the Baltic states of Latvia,
Esthonia, and Lithuania. The Finns, however, refused the Russian
demands, and Russia went to war against Finland in November, 1940. The
Finns fought bravely and skilfully through a winter campaign, but
within four months they were defeated by overwhelming weight of men and
material. By the spring of 1940 the Germans were ready to move again.
In April they quickly occupied Denmark and Norway by surprise tactics.
In May they over-ran Holland and Belgium, and burst through the
Ardennes and the Meuse valley into France. They drove a wedge between
the British expeditionary force in Belgium and the main body of the
French armies. By skill and good fortune the bulk of the British forces
were evacuated through Dunkirk, but all the heavy equipment and
material was lost. Within a month the French armies were rolled back
over the Seine, defeated and bewildered by the speed of the German
mechanised columns; by the middle of June a French government, headed
by Marshal Petain, capitulated to the Germans. Just before the fall of
France Mussolini declared war on Britain and France, being convinced
that Germany would be victorious and wishing to obtain some share of
the victors' spoils. Britain was now left alone, in a very vulnerable
situation, with only the help of the Empire to withstand the German and
Italian attack. But though she was greatly inferior in military
strength, Britain's naval superiority made a German invasion of England
difficult and dangerous. The Germans therefore tried to pave the way
for invasion by destroying British aerodromes. Hundreds of bombers were
sent over in daylight bombing attacks, but they were decisively beaten
in the great air battles of August to October, 1940. The skill of
British pilots and the quality of the Spitfire fighter planes saved
Britain from invasion. The Germans then tried to knock Britain out of
the war by the concentrated bombing of British cities by night. This
phase lasted for about eight months, to May, 1941, but it was no more
successful in its purpose. Meanwhile the Italians had attacked the
Greeks in order to obtain control of the eastern Mediterranean, and the
first rounds of the North African campaign had been fought in Egypt and
Libya. But the Greeks put up such good resistance that the Germans also
joined in the attack on Greece, overrunning Yugo-slavia on the way.
British troops again had to be evacuated; Greece fell in April and
Crete in June, 1941.</p>

<p>Confident in the power of Germany and Italy to conquer and control
the Mediterranean, Hitler now hurled his armies against Russia on 22nd
June, 1941, intending to smash Russian military strength and to obtain
control of Russian wheat, oil, and minerals. Doubtless he imagined that
when this was done the final defeat of Britain would be easy. But he
miscalculated. Though his armies bit deep into Russian territory and
millions of Russians were killed, the Russians were not defeated and
Britain and the United States sent them as much help as possible. Ever
since the fall of France, Franklin Roosevelt, as President of the
United States, had shown that he would do everything possible 'short of
war' to help Britain, and to prevent an Axis victory. When Russia was
attacked the same aid was readily given to her. It became clear that it
was probably only a matter of time before the United States was
actually in the war herself, but the matter was put beyond all doubt at
the end of 1941. On 7th December, 1941, the Japanese simultaneously
attacked the Americans at Pearl Harbour and in the Philippines, and
also the British in Malaya. The line-up of the rival powers was now
almost complete. On the one side were the Axis Powers, with most of
Europe under their control, and the active assistance of Hungary,
Rumania, and Finland. On the other side were the United Nations of
Britain, Russia and the United States, with the British Dominions
(except Eire), the 'free' forces of France, and of the refugee
governments of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Holland, Belgium,
Yugo-slavia and Greece. Also with the United Nations were the great
people of China, who had been fighting the Japanese without respite
ever since 1937. Most of the Central and South American countries also
joined the United Nations, though Argentina was a notable exception and
remained neutral.</p>

<p>The Japanese by their surprise attack at Pearl Harbour dealt the
American navy a heavy blow, and 1942 was a black year for the United
Nations. Within a few months the Japanese had conquered Malaya;
Singapore, the great British naval base, fell on 15th February. The
Philippines fell soon after and then Burma, while the American bases at
Guam and Wake Island had already gone. In Russia the Germans reached
the northern Caucasus, and the River Volga at Stalingrad. In North
Africa the Germans and Italians were only stopped at El Alamein, 90
miles west of Alexandria and Cairo. Australia came under the menace of
invasion with the fall of Malaya and of the Dutch East Indies, when the
Japanese advanced into New Guinea and the Solomons. On 19th February,
1942, for the first time in our history, Australia came under enemy
attack, when Japanese bombers practically wiped out Port Darwin. Broome
and Wyndham had their turn a couple of weeks later. Already in January,
1942, the Japanese had taken Rabaul, and early in March they landed in
strength on the mainland of New Guinea at Salamaua; they began to
advance towards Port Moresby by the Markham Valley. But by this time
American aid, particularly air and naval forces, had arrived to help
defend Australia. Australian ground forces repelled the advance by the
Markham Valley, while American air forces stopped the Japanese invasion
fleet at Salamaua. General MacArthur landed in Australia on 17th March,
1942, from the Philippines, and took charge of the Allied forces in the
South-West Pacific. Another southward drive by a Japanese invasion
fleet was checked by American air and naval forces in the Battle of the
Coral Sea in May, 1942. But on the New Guinea mainland the Japanese
still strove to take Port Moresby by land and sea advances. Both these
attempts were defeated, but not until the Japanese had reached within
30 miles of Port Moresby. The tide at last turned when Australian
troops pursued the Japanese back across the Owen Stanley Ranges in
October and November, but the chief factor in checking the Japanese
drive was the American success in the Solomons. In August, 1942,
American forces seized the Japanese airfield and base at Guadalcanal,
and after several months' desperate fighting threw the Japanese out of
the island with heavy losses.</p>

<p>From that time the fortunes of war began to swing in favour of the
United Nations; the Axis countries had reached the summit of their
success about August, 1942. At that time the Japanese were entrenched
as far to the south-east as New Guinea and the Solomons, and to the
south-west upon the eastern borders of India; the German armies were at
Stalingrad and in the Caucasus, and the Germans and Italians at El
Alamein. By the end of the year the Germans were reeling back from
Stalingrad and the Caucasus; in Egypt Rommel had suffered a decisive
defeat from Montgomery at El Alamein, and the Japanese had been
completely stopped by the Americans in the Solomons. In fact, by their
attack on the United States in December, 1941, the Axis Powers had made
their ultimate defeat certain. Although they gained some initial
advantages from the Japanese surprise attacks, and their early
successes, they also brought into the war the most powerful country in
the world. Once the United States had the time to mobilize her millions
of men, and to turn her tremendous wealth and productive forces to war
purposes, there could be little, doubt about the outcome. Once her
strength was effectively added to the already great resources of Russia
and the British Commonwealth the tide began to turn in their favour. In
November, 1942, American and British forces landed in Morocco and
Algeria, and by June, 1943, the Axis forces were defeated and thrown
out of Africa. The invasion of Sicily followed soon afterwards, and
then of the Italian mainland. This brought about the fall of Mussolini,
and Italy was defeated; but the Germans were in Italy in strength and
the complete freeing of Italian soil was to be a slow and painful
business. In Russia the Germans were driven back beyond the Don in
1943, and in New Guinea by hard fighting the Japanese were driven from
Salamaua, Lae, and Finschhafen. The year 1944 saw further great Russian
advances, the Germans being driven from Russian soil; in June the
Americans and British invaded France, and by a decisive victory in the
Battle of Normandy brought about the liberation of French territory.
Against the Japanese, General MacArthur carried out a series of
brilliant actions which gave him a chain of bases along the north coast
of New Guinea, and enabled him to carry out a successful invasion of
the Philippines. The beginning of 1945 (when this narrative is being
written) saw the liberation of Northern Burma by the Allied forces, and
the reopening of the Burma Road to Chungking; for 2 1/2 years it had
been closed by the Japanese conquest of Burma. In Europe, East Prussia
was being overrun by the Russians, who swept across Poland and invaded
Prussia and Silesia from the East. The Americans, British, French and
Canadians were hammering at the western frontier of Germany, and the
defeat of the second Axis partner in 1945 seemed certain. Then the
combined might of the United Nations could be turned against Japan; her
defeat also seemed inevitable. The nations would then be given an
opportunity to enter into a new set of relationships; if the terms of
peace settlement are wisely drawn up this great struggle may prove to
have been the starting point of an era of human happiness, peace and
prosperity. If not, there will probably be another period of uneasy
peace in a prelude to further disastrous conflicts between the nations
of the earth.</p>

<p>In the Second World War which began in 1939 Australians took part in
operations in many parts of the globe. The first squadrons of the Royal
Australian Air Force reached England in December, 1939. Their exploits,
for example, in the Sunderland flying-boats of Coastal Command, have
made them famous. Australian pilots in the Royal Air Force took part in
the Battle of Britain in August-October, 1940, and in subsequent years
thousands of Australian airmen trained under the Empire Air Training
Scheme fought in Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific and elsewhere.
The first divisions of the second Australian Imperial Force raised for
overseas service were despatched in 1940. The 6th Division was sent to
the Middle East; the 7th Division was also en route to Egypt, when the
fall of France caused it to be diverted to England, where it went to
action stations against the expected German invasion. Australian troops
in the Middle East proved a very useful addition to the Imperial forces
in that area, particularly after the fall of France. They took part in
the first Libyan campaign of December, 1940, to February, 1941, in
which General Wavell, the British commander, inflicted a crushing
defeat on the Italians; Bardia, Tobruk, Derna and Benghazi were
captured, and over 130,000 Italians were taken prisoners. Unfortunately
many of the troops were then sent to Greece (March, 1941), amongst them
some of the Australian 6th Division. This enabled Rommel, the German
commander in Africa, to carry out a counter-offensive which forced the
Imperial troops back into Egypt; but an Allied force, including the
Australian 9th Division, successfully held the port of Tobruk from
March until November when it was relieved by another British offensive.
Meanwhile the British and Imperial troops in Greece, after fighting a
delaying action against overwhelming odds, were forced to withdraw; the
evacuation took place at the end of April, 1941. Most of their heavy
equipment was lost, and many of them landed in Crete with practically
nothing. In May the Germans carried out an air-borne invasion of Crete,
and Australian and New Zealand troops took part in the bitter fighting
that followed, without any support from fighter planes; another defeat
and evacuation followed. Meanwhile reinforcements had built up the
strength of the A.I.F. to several times the strength of the original
6th Division. The British decided to occupy Syria in order to prevent
the Germans and the Italians from establishing themselves in Asia
Minor, in order to drive upon the Suez Canal from both sides. The Vichy
French Government seemed to be following a policy of collaboration with
Germany and Italy, and the occupation of Syria was the merest common
sense. Vichy troops resisted the occupation, but a five weeks' campaign
in June-July, 1941, brought Syria under Allied control. Australian
troops took part in this and in all the subsequent fighting backwards
and forwards across North Africa during 1941-42, until they were
withdrawn to meet the threatened Japanese invasion of Australia. The
last Australian division to leave the Middle East was the 9th, and it
did not leave until after the victorious offensive at El Alamein, in
which it did its full share in contributing to the eventual defeat of
the Axis forces in North Africa. The 8th Division of the A.I.F. had
been sent to Singapore in February, 1941, to form part of the British
force in Malaya. They took part in the Malayan campaign against the
Japanese from December, 1941, to February, 1942. Although they fought
gallantly they had little or no air support against Japanese bombers.
With the fall of Singapore some 17,000 troops of the 8th Division
became prisoners of war in the hands of the Japanese.</p>

<p>Since early in 1943 the sphere of operations of the Australian Army
has been confined to New Guinea and the adjacent islands. During 1942
they scored their first decisive success against the Japanese at Milne
Bay in August, when they severely defeated a Japanese landing assault.
This stemmed the coastal advance to Port Moresby. When the Japanese
were driven back over the Owen Stanley Ranges in October and November,
Australian troops linked up with Americans to capture Gona and Buna. In
February, 1943, they inflicted a sharp defeat on the Japanese at Wau,
which the Japanese tried to capture. The crushing defeat of the
Japanese in the Battle of the Bismark Sea in March, when a whole
Japanese convoy was wiped out by the American Air Force, paved the way
for further successes on land by the Australian troops. Woodlark and
the Trobriand Islands were occupied by the Allies in June, and in
September Salamaua, and Lae were taken. By October Finschhafen was
captured, and Satelberg followed in November. Along the Ramu Valley and
across the rugged Finisterre Ranges, Australian soldiers fought through
some of the worst jungle and mountain country in the world to link up
with American forces, and to drive the Japanese from the Huon Peninsula
in February, 1944. The American forces then went on to make successful
landings in the Admiraltys in March, and at Hollandia (Dutch New
Guinea) in April. In both these and subsequent landing operations
during 1944 at Wakde, Biak, Noemfors, Morotai, and the Philippines,
Australian air and naval units took part, while Australian troops
remained in New Guinea to deal with the Japanese garrisons that had
been by-passed during this series of operations.</p>

<p>The Royal Australian Navy has played an equally meritorious part in
operations during this great struggle. At the outbreak of war our naval
units had important duties in convoy and patrol work, while some were
posted to serve with the British Mediterranean squadron. It was here
that the cruiser H.M.A.S. <i>Sydney</i>, under Captain Collins, sank
the Italian cruiser <i>Bartolomeo Colleoni</i> in July, 1940. Thousands
of Australian naval men went to serve in British corvettes and
submarine chasers, especially in the dark days from June, 1940, to the
end of 1942, when the submarine menace was particularly grave. The
destroyers and sloops of the R.A.N. played their part in supplying and
reinforcing the garrison of Tobruk, during their world-famous defence
of the port from March to November in 1942. The Royal Australian Navy
suffered heavy losses, particularly after the Japanese entered the war;
in fact, in proportion to its numbers it has suffered much more heavily
than any of the other services. The cruiser H.M.A.S. <i>Sydney</i> was
sunk in the Indian Ocean in November, 1941, with the loss of all on
board, in circumstances which are not yet generally known. Presumably
she was sunk by a German raider, which itself went down before the
<i>Sydney</i> disappeared burning fiercely. In February, 1942, the
cruiser H.M.A.S. <i>Perth</i> and the sloop <i>Yarra</i> were lost in
the Battle of the Java Sea, when an Allied force under the Dutch
Admiral Helfrich engaged a Japanese fleet. The R.A.N. suffered another
heavy blow when the cruiser H.M.A.S. <i>Canberra</i> was sunk in action
in the Solomons in August, 1942. Three of our five cruisers had now
been lost in action, and in September the British Government presented
the cruiser <i>Shropshire</i> to the Australian Government to replace
the <i>Canberra</i>. But despite the losses the R.A.N. continued to
expand its numbers, and destroyers and smaller ships of war were built
to replace the lost vessels. The number of ships and men rose to higher
levels than ever before, and the Australian squadron continued to take
an active part in the war against the Japanese. It took part in all the
major landing operations in the campaign from New Guinea to the
Philippines. In these engagements two cruisers, the <i>Hobart</i> and
the flagship <i>Australia</i>, suffered considerable damage, but their
crews had the satisfaction of sharing in victories instead of suffering
reverses.</p>

<p>Thus in every branch of the services by air, land, and sea,
Australian forces played their part worthily in the struggle against
the Axis Powers. In 1942 when the nation was fully mobilised for war,
it was estimated that there were about 800,000 men in the Australian
forces, and some tens of thousands of women in the auxiliary
organizations. But a nation does not successfully organize for war
merely by putting people in uniform. It is necessary to provide all the
supplies and equipment that will enable them to fight at least on equal
terms with the enemy. In this field Australia was able to do far more
than she had done in 1914-18. Not only has she provided all the guns,
rifles and ammunition for her armies, but in 1940 when Britain was
faced with invasion she sent these in considerable quantities to
England. She has built aeroplanes, and practically all her materials of
war except tanks and some other very specialized and expensive
equipment. She has supplied some millions of tons of food, raw
materials and supplies to Britain, U.S.A., and her other Allies. These
things were not done easily or very quickly, and they called for
considerable changes in the way of life of the Australian people. They
were also accompanied by important political changes. In the first year
of the war the Commonwealth Government, led by Mr. R. G. Menzies,
started to organize Australian production for war, and to raise an
Australian army for service overseas. But it was not very clear whether
Australian troops would be wanted, or where they could be best used.
The chief step taken was to take part in the Empire Air Training
Scheme, to train airmen for service wherever they might be wanted; this
was begun in December, 1939. But at the outbreak of war there were
considerable numbers of men in Australia who were unemployed, and so
for the first year or so men could be recruited for the services, and
production could be expanded, without any shortage of labour or
lengthening of hours of work. In the first half of 1940 there was even
a widespread strike in the coal-mining industry, which lasted for many
weeks. But when the Germans invaded the Low Countries and burst into
France in May, 1940, the strike soon came to an end. With the fall of
France there was a rush of men to the colours, and factories began to
work overtime to turn out supplies. Compulsory military service for the
defence of Australia was re-introduced, although voluntary enlistment
for overseas service was retained. The general election in 1940
returned Mr. Menzies as Prime Minister, but his supporters in the House
only had an unstable majority of one, after a Speaker had been
chosen!</p>

<p>In 1941 Mr. Menzies visited Britain, going by air via Singapore and
the Middle East. His conferences with Mr. Churchill, the British Prime
Minister, and his own experiences during a period of terrific German
bombing raids on British cities, convinced him that Australia should
quicken the pace of her war preparation and increase the scale of
taxation. The situation called for efforts similar to those being made
in Britain; the cutting down of all unnecessary expenditure and a
sterner war effort. But his party, which was really a coalition of the
United Australia and Country parties, was not prepared to accept the
programme he proposed; doubtless they feared that their parties would
lose political popularity. Moves were made to replace Mr. Menzies by
another leader, and in August, 1941, Mr. A. W. Fadden, leader of the
Australian Country Party, succeeded Mr. Menzies as Prime Minister. But
his tenure of office was short-lived, for in October Mr. Fadden was
defeated on his budget, and Mr. John Curtin, the leader of the Labour
Party, became Prime Minister. At last, after ten years in opposition,
Labour again had charge of the government of the Commonwealth, although
it hardly had power. Its majority depended upon two independent members
of parliament, but the Curtin Government took up its task with such
vigour, determination, and sincerity that it maintained its position
until a general election was due in 1943. When this took place in
August, 1943, the Curtin Government was returned with an overwhelming
majority. The people of Australia had appreciated the way in which Mr.
Curtin and his government had successfully organized the nation for
war, particularly when Australia was under the threat of a Japanese
invasion. His measures called for self-sacrifice and hard work; men and
women worked longer, and submitted to rates of taxation never
previously contemplated. They contributed hundreds of millions of
pounds to war loans, and they submitted to rationing of tea, sugar,
butter, meat and clothing. Australians felt the pinch of war in a way
they had never felt it in the war of 1914-18, yet most of them put up
with all these shortages and inconveniences willingly in the national
interest. The presence of hundreds of thousands of American service men
in Australia also put a great strain upon Australian supplies and
services, but American help was indispensable in defeating the
attempted Japanese invasion.</p>

<p>With Labour in power as well as in office after August, 1943, it was
natural that the Curtin Government should try to introduce some of
Labour's social programme, and to realize some of the objectives
proclaimed in the Atlantic Charter by Winston Churchill and Franklin
Roosevelt in August, 1941. The Menzies Government, faced by a strong
demand for an increase in the basic wage in 1940 and 1941, had
introduced a system of Child Endowment in June, 1941, paying 5/- per
week for each child in a family after the first. In February, 1944, the
Curtin Government passed a Social Security Act to provide a national
health and unemployment scheme, and thus give security from poverty and
want. It also began to lay its plans for the return to Peace-time
conditions after the war, and passed a bill to alter the constitution,
so as to give the Commonwealth power to control employment and
production. These powers were possessed by the States, and to transfer
them to the Commonwealth it was necessary that the people should
approve the alteration of the constitution at a referendum. However, by
the time the referendum was held in August, 1944, the danger of a
Japanese invasion was past. The people were beginning to become weary
of the prolonged strain, and of the close control over their activities
that had been necessary in a time of danger. Only two States out of the
six voted in favour of the measure, and it was defeated by a
considerable majority. The figures were as follows:</p>

<pre>
STATE                NO VOTE  YES VOTE   INFORMAL   MAJORITY FOR NO

New South Wales     911,680    759,211    23,228       +152,469

Western Australia   128,303    140,399     3,637       - 12,096
Tasmania             83,769     53,386     2,256       + 30,383

</pre>

<p>It is possible that the people of Australia may suffer considerable
inconvenience as a result of their decision at this referendum, for at
the end of the war the return to peace-time conditions will present
governments with many difficult problems. These problems will be
nation-wide in scope and the national government, the Commonwealth,
would be able to deal with them much more effectively if it had wider
powers and was more clearly paramount over the States. In addition to
the internal problems to be faced, the Commonwealth Government will
also have to take its part in laying down the terms of a peace
settlement after the war. Our responsibility and our share in this will
not be nearly as great as in the case of great nations like the United
States, Russia, and Britain. But our voice will depend to a large
extent on the contribution we make to final victory, and it should be
heard. It is very desirable that our voice should be used to advocate a
wise and long-sighted settlement in order to obtain an era of lasting
peace among the nations of the earth. This would be the best reward for
the sacrifices endured by this generation in this country and many
others throughout the world.</p>

<p>The constitutions conferred upon the Australian colonies in 1855
contained the most liberal endowment of self government that had ever
been secured in the history of colonization by dependencies from a
mother-country. The attitude of British statesmen towards oversea
dominions had recently undergone a rapid and sweeping change. Only a
few years before, Lord Grey had maintained that Great Britain had a
perfect right to ship her felonry to the colonies despite their
reluctance to receive them. He could not understand the resistance
offered by the Cape of Good Hope, by Victoria, and by New South Wales.
But the same Lord Grey, having failed to perpetuate transportation,
became the sponsor of measures which left the Australian colonies free
to do as they pleased within very wide limits, while affording them
complete protection. Not all British statesmen agreed with this liberal
policy. Disraeli, for example, said some years later in a public
speech, that self-government in the colonies ought to have been
conceded as part of a great policy of Imperial consolidation. 'It ought
to have been accompanied,' he said, 'by an Imperial tariff, by
securities for the people of England for the enjoyment of the
unappropriated lands which belonged to the Sovereign as their trustee,
and by a military code which should have precisely defined the means
and the responsibilities by which the colonies should have been
defended and by which, if necessary, this country should call for aid
from the colonies themselves.' But Disraeli, who had also spoken of
'these wretched colonies' as millstones hanging round the neck of the
mother-country, never understood the problem or the people whom it
affected; and it is certain that attempts to control either the land or
the economic policy of Australia from London would have resulted in
failure. The colonies had to be free to work out their own
destiny--making mistakes, perhaps, but paying for those mistakes
themselves, and able to rectify them by their own means.</p>

<p>A school of English political thought, which had representatives in
high official places, believed that self-government would work towards
the separation of the colonies from the mother-country, and that it
would be no lamentable occurrence if such were the case. Frederic
Rogers, afterwards Lord Blachford, who was Permanent Under-Secretary of
the Colonial Office from 1869 to 1871, wrote, in a piece of
autobiography: 'I had always believed--and this belief has so confirmed
and consolidated itself that I can hardly realize the possibility of
anyone seriously thinking the contrary--that the destiny of our
colonies is independence, and that in this point of view the function
of the Colonial Office is to secure that our connection, while it
lasts, shall be as profitable to both parties and our separation, when
it comes, as amicable, as possible.' The views of Rogers were quite
commonly entertained in England, though they have often been falsely
attributed to some eminent men who both repudiated and worked against
them--to Gladstone, for example. But that they were the views of the
official who was mainly responsible for guiding British colonial policy
during a critical period indicates that relations were not likely to be
maintained on very sympathetic lines. Higinbotham's scornful reference
to the Colonial Office and its permanent chief during the exciting
Darling Grant crisis in Victoria, was a castigation of the official
attitude in terms that were meant to scorch, and did. 'It was said of
the Athenian republic in its best days,' said Higinbotham, 'that it was
governed by the poodle dog of a courtesan, and the BON MOT was made out
with great ingenuity. It was said that the poodle dog engrossed the
attentions of its mistress, the mistress engrossed her lover, and the
lover ruled the fierce democracy and controlled its policy. I believe
that a similar remark might be applied with far more truth to the
present relations between the Colonial Office and these countries. I
believe it might be said with perfect truth that the million and a half
of Englishmen who inhabit these colonies, and who during the last
fifteen years have believed they possessed self-government, have been
really governed during the whole of that time by a person named Rogers.
He is the chief clerk in the Colonial Office. Of course he inspires
every minister who enters the department, year after year, with
Colonial Office traditions, Colonial Office policy, Colonial Office
ideas.'</p>

<p>Yet, despite the frequently strained relations between ministers in
Australia and the Colonial Office officials, there never was any
antagonism between the Australian people and the mother-country. There
was always, on the contrary, a deep and sincere bond of affection
between them. Henry Parkes's famous and vivid phrase, 'the crimson
thread of kinship runs through us all,' was no mere piece of rhetorical
decoration. It was an expression of the living faith of the man and of
those for whom he spoke. How thoroughly British the population of
Australia has always been, how trifling has been the foreign admixture,
is a great fact in the history and in the psychology of the country
which has been all too inadequately appreciated. In an earlier chapter
it was pointed out that every name of those who framed the Commonwealth
constitution was a name of British origin. A related fact of much
significance is that from the very beginning of responsible government,
the head of every Government which has held office in any of the six
States, and in the Commonwealth, bore a British name. The names of
nearly all the judges and ministers of State answer to the same test of
origin.</p>

<p>Over thirty years after responsible government was initiated it
occurred to the Imperial Government that it might be advantageous to
confer with representatives of those oversea countries which had been
allowed to go their own way, and had not, to the surprise of many,
become independent republics. A new spirit began to make itself
manifest in the speeches of British public men. Lord Goschen told his
countrymen that 'statesmanship had never found a home at the Colonial
Office,' and that it was time that the relations between the parts of
the British Empire were seriously considered. The summoning of the
first Colonial Conference in 1887 marked the beginning of a new
era.</p>

<p>Yet it is doubtful whether there would have been a Conference then
had it not been that in 1887 Queen Victoria attained the Jubilee of her
accession, and representatives of the colonies had to be invited to
take part in the celebrations. To that circumstance in part, at all
events, is to be attributed the holding of the first of a series of
gatherings which opened the eyes of British politicians to the fact
that the colonies had grown into political communities whose opinions
must be regarded. 'There was a time perhaps,' said Deakin, one of the
Victorian representatives, at the first day's sitting, 'when an
invitation to a conference such as this would not have been sent from
the mother-country; but there has never been a time when such an
invitation would not have been cordially responded to by the Australian
colonies.' A purely consultative conference it necessarily was, but
some practical results nevertheless flowed from it, and it served above
all to awaken British ministers to the fact that these distant
English-speaking populations must be treated in a fashion different
from the old practice.</p>

<p>There was a second Conference in 1897, when the Colonial Secretary
happened to be a statesman who took his office seriously, and
entertained broad imperial views. He concurred in the opinion that such
gatherings ought to be held periodically, and not be dependent upon the
occurrence of such an event as a jubilee or a coronation. Ten years
between the first and the second Conference was too long a gap. In
1902, therefore, Chamberlain summoned a third Conference. By that time
Australia was a federation, and was represented by her Prime Minister,
Barton. A fourth--now called an Imperial, not a colonial--conference
was held in 1907, when again the Prime Minister (Deakin) was present;
and a fifth in 1911, when Fisher represented the Commonwealth. In
addition there have been special conferences for special purposes,
notably that on Imperial Defence in 1909, and that relating to the
European War in 1916. On these and many subsequent occasions the
dominions and the mother-country have conferred on subjects of common
interest, and their statesmen have met on equal terms in the
trusteeship of a great imperial heritage. The conferences completely
dissipated the old suspicion on the one side and official obtuseness on
the other, and removed the once prevalent feeling of inevitable
dissolution. Constructive statesmanship set its gaze on ideals of
growth towards closer union and complete co-operation.</p>

<p>The personal link between Australia and Great Britain since the dawn
of responsible government was the colonial Governor; since federation
the Governor-General has been an additional source of strength. The
Australian States have not followed the Canadian example, in choosing
provincial governors within the country. However, in 1931 the
Commonwealth Government, then led by J. H. Scullin, a Labour prime
minister, secured the appointment of a distinguished Australian, Sir
Isaac Isaaes, as Governor-General. It is the practice in making these
appointments for the Crown to be guided by the wishes of the government
of the day. But when Sir Isaac Isaaes retired in 1936 he was succeeded
as Governor-General by Lord Gowrie, and the practice of appointing
native-born Australians to the position has not become established,
although it may still be followed. In 1939 the appointment of the Duke
of Kent as the next Governor-General was announced, but owing to the
outbreak of war later in the same year, the prince did not take up his
office. In August 1942 the Duke of Kent was killed in an accident while
on an official mission, when his aeroplane crashed into a mountain in
Scotland. But the principle of appointing a member of the royal
household as Governor-General marked an important development in
relations between the Commonwealth and the mother-country. This
precedent was followed again when at the end of 1943, Mr. Curtin, the
Labour prime minister of the Commonwealth, announced that the Duke of
Gloucester, brother of the Duke of Kent and King George VI, had
accepted appointment to the office of Governor-General. A large number
of men have held the Sovereign's commission in Australia, before and
since the era of responsible government, and many of them have been men
of exceptional ability and high character. Some have had very difficult
situations to handle, and could not avoid giving offence to one party
or the other. But the rules which a Governor should follow are well
defined, and a man who follows them firmly, tactfully, and with as
little to say as need be, cannot go far wrong.</p>

<p>A step in the direction of closer trade relations with the
mother-country was made by the tariff of 1908, which gave a preference
of 5 per cent. to British goods over those of foreign origin. This
policy was one upon which Deakin felt keenly. The preference affected
British goods to the total of over 20,000,000 pounds, and the
diminished duty upon them amounted to over one million pounds per
annum. The preferential rate was maintained in subsequent amendments of
the tariff.</p>

<p>The student of British colonial history who makes a comparison
between the relations of the mother-country and her oversea possessions
under the old system, and those prevailing under the new, must be
struck with the violent contrast. When in the eighteenth century
England was fighting the French for dominion in North America, the war
was one in which the colonies themselves were vitally interested. If
the French had secured the waterway of the Mississippi and the Ohio,
and had connected Canada with Louisiana by a chain of forts, the
westward expansion of the English colonies stretched along the Atlantic
seaboard would have been blocked. The war was in behalf of the
colonies. Yet we find them not only reluctant to aid, haggling in
jealous distrust of each other, having to be bought, coaxed, and
bullied to supply men and equipment, but positively making money by
supplying goods to the enemy. We find the contrary result under free
institutions.</p>

<p>The first indication that Australia meant to play a part in Imperial
affairs on the wider field of world politics, occurred in 1885, when W.
B. Dalley, then acting-Premier of New South Wales, raised and equipped
an expedition for service alongside the British Army in the Egyptian
campaign. When the South African War broke out in 1899, Australia was
not yet federated, but each of the six States despatched contingents
which took part in the two-and-a-half years' fighting, and earned for
themselves a brilliant reputation for valour, initiative, and resource.
Before the South African War was finished another Australian expedition
took part in British operations in China (1900) connected with the
suppression of the Boxer rebellion.</p>

<p>Upon the outbreak of the great European War in August 1914,
Australia flew to arms on the instant. German military and Political
writers had predicted that, if a great war occurred, Australia would
declare her independence, and set up a republic. They might as
truthfully have prophesied that Yorkshire would declare its
independence, or that Manchester would become a republic.</p>

<p>It has stood for very much in the development of Australia that her
people have been proud of their race and sensitive to maintain its best
traditions. British history is their history, with its failings to be
guarded against and its glories to be emulated. British in origin, they
can at this distance of time survey the causes of the foundation of
settlement in their country, and be without regrets that for want of
better ones those proved fruitful, because this land thus became a
field for the exercise of their racial genius for adaptation and for
conquering difficulties.</p>

<p>To this country of fertility, sunshine, and vast spaciousness they
have brought whatever civilization Europe had to give them, and have
added to it the fruits of their own inventiveness. So it has also been
with their literature. The riches of English letters are theirs, and
the best things are read with no deeper zest anywhere than here. But
new scope for life, the spirit of an ancient race flourishing in fresh
conditions, call for new interpreters; and have found them. Tellers of
stories, writers of poems, painters of landscape--of these Australia
has had her own.</p>

<p>Henry Kingsley, in <i>Geoffrey Hamlyn</i> (1859) wrote a tale of
squatting life which has pleased many thousands of readers during half
a century, and is likely to stand the test of time. Marcus Clarke,
drawing his basic facts from authentic sources, produced the classic
novel of the convict days in his grim and powerful <i>For the Term of
his Natural Life</i> (1874). 'Rolf Boldrewood' (T. A. Browne) knew
intimately the life which he described in his tales, <i>Robbery Under
Arms</i> (1888), <i>The Miner's Right</i> (1890), <i>Nevermore</i>
(1892), <i>The Squatter's Dream</i> (1892), and others; and their
fidelity will give them endurance, though some readers may grow
impatient with the author's slipshod style. When <i>Robbery Under
Arms</i> first appeared as a serial in the <i>Sydney</i> <i>Mail</i> it
proved to be of thrilling interest to readers in the farthest corners
of Australia; and Browne used to relate that, when it was nearing its
conclusion, a party of shearers in a far-out sheep station, to whom the
instalments had been read, impatient to know the fate of 'Starlight,'
sent a messenger on horseback to the nearest telegraph office many
miles away, to telegraph to Sydney for the conclusion.</p>

<p>Henry Lawson wrote stories of 'back-blocks' life that are full of
vigour, vividness, and humour, especially those in his first prose
volume, <i>While the Billy Boils</i>. Louis Becke's many tales of the
Pacific Islands are pastels by a beach-comber whose talent for
story-telling and wealth of experience were discovered by J. F.
Archibald, the first editor of the Sydney <i>Bulletin</i>. Even the
very far interior has found an author to describe its way of living, in
Mrs. Gunn's truthful and entertaining <i>We of the Never-Never</i>.</p>

<p>Australia has never run short of poets. The rain may sometimes fail
to fall when it should, and the rivers may dry up in their glistening
beds, but the Pierian spring flows constantly and copiously. There are
things in verse which each generation can produce for itself, and
things which can only be the work of one man at one time. Of the former
kind there is very much in Australian literature, of the latter not a
large quantity. Amongst earlier generations of writers Henry Clarence
Kendall (1841-82), Adam Lindsay Gordon (1833-70) and James Brunton
Stephens (1835-1901) are worthily held in remembrance, but only the
first named of the three was Australian born. Kendall possessed a rich
and limpid lyric gift, loving the quiet places where meditation brought
forth flowers; and his verses breathe an atmosphere of 'unfooted dells
and secret hollows dear to noontide dew.' Gordon, horse-breaker,
steeple-chase rider, dreamer and ne'er-do-well, friend of jockeys and
shepherds, came to Australia in 1853. Educated at Cheltenham and the
Woolwich Military College, he never lost the mark of the scholar and
gentleman there impressed upon him; and the memory of his sporting life
in England coloured several of the poems he wrote in Australia:</p>

<pre>
   I remember the lowering wintry morn,
   And the mist on the Cotswold Hills
   Where I once heard the blast of the huntsman's horn,
   Not far from the seven rills.

</pre>

<p>But his main inspiration was Australian. Here he wrote things which
are known by heart and repeated in camps and shearing-sheds. It is the
kind of immortality that he would have liked. His horse ballads, with
the hoofs clattering along the lines, are his best guarantee of
popularity. He read his Horace by candle-light in redolent. stables,
and scribbled his poems in pencil on odd scraps of paper. To Swinburne,
whose fiery genius was in full efflorescence during Gordon's writing
period, he owed much, as is apparent in such lines as these:</p>

<pre>
   In the spring when the wattle gold trembles
   Twixt shadow and shine,
   When each dew-laden air-draught resembles
   A long draught of wine
   When the sky-line's blue burnished resistance
   Makes deeper the dreamiest distance,
   Some song in all hearts hath existence
   Such songs have been mine.

</pre>

<p>There is a fine vein of romance and an atmosphere of wide expanses
in Gordon, mingling with his native melancholy. He loved the life he
wrote about, and he loved writing about it.</p>

<p>Brunton Stephens was a scholarly clerk in a Government office in
Brisbane, with his Dante never very far from his elbow; and he wrote
some very noble verse, sincere in spirit, chaste in diction, and
charged with emotion. His best piece is his prophetic ode on 'The
Dominion of Australia' (1877):</p>

<pre>
   She is not yet; but he whose ear
   Thrills to that finer atmosphere--

</pre>

<p>he, the seer, knew that she must come to be, and that in the
attainment of unity--</p>

<pre>
   Our bounds shall be the girdling seas alone.
</pre>

<p>In a younger generation Australia has found a fresh band of poets to
sing her songs and chant her ballads of the life that is her own--of
the mines and the cattle camps, the forests and the mountains, of the
great wide expanses where the stockman,</p>

<pre>
   Sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,
   And at night the wondrous glory of the everlasting stars.
</pre>

<p>A deeper spiritual note, too, has been struck in the chants of
Bernard O'Dowd, who has woven into rhythms the thought of a complex and
swiftly changing age. Andrew Paterson ('The Banjo') has given his
countrymen, in 'The Man from Snowy River,' perhaps the most popular
poem that has ever been written in Australia, a piece of picturesque
ballad-writing that is known by heart by many a man who only knows
greater poets by name. Henry Lawson's often rough but very real poetry
is hot from the heart of a man of temperament and experience. There are
passages in his virile 'Star of Australasia' that ring like the
authentic message of prophecy, written as this poem was nearly a
quarter of a century before the name of Anzac blazed into being:</p>

<p>We boast no more of our bloodless flag, that rose from a nation's
slime; Better a shred of deep-dyed rag from the storms of the olden
time. From grander clouds in our 'peaceful skies' than ever were there
before I tell you the Star of the South shall rise--in the lurid clouds
of war.</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">
<pre>
   There are boys out there by the western creeks who hurry away from school
   To climb the sides of the breezy peaks or dive in the shaded pool,
   Who'll stick to their guns when the mountains quake to the tread of
      a mighty war--
   And fight for a Right or a Great Mistake as men never fought before;
   When the peaks are scarred and the sea-walls crack till the furthest
      hills vibrate,
   And the world for a while goes rolling back in a storm of love and hate.

</pre>

<p>Victor Daley was the most finished artist who wrote verse in this
country; and there is strong feeling in the often haggard stanzas of
Barcroft Boake.</p>

<p>Perhaps not many of the writings of these men are well known outside
Australia; but what of that? She has her own life, and it is good; they
wrote for her about the things that are hers; and they have helped her
people to understand their country, their destiny, and themselves.</p>

<p>The things which are most characteristic of Australia, in landscape
as in life, have only been truly seen by those who have steeped
themselves in the atmosphere of the land. It is interesting to observe
that pictures painted by artists of real merit in the early years seem
to-day to be not Australian pictures, so much as pictures of European
scenes 'with a difference.' The light, the colour, and above all the
character, are not Australian. To some observers, indeed, it seemed
that Australian scenery could never be attractive to the landscape
painter. A writer in an early edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia
Britannica</i> said that this was 'no very beautiful or picturesque
country, such as is likely to form or to inspire a poet.' There was
nothing in the scenery, the writer thought, 'to expand the heart or
fancy.' Barron Field, Charles Lamb's friend, in his <i>Memories of New
South Wales</i>, laid it down that 'no tree to my taste can be
beautiful that is not deciduous. What can a painter do with one cold
olive green?'</p>

<p>But a later school of painters, born in the country, knowing its
moods and familiar with its most intimate spirit, have found an
infinite diversity and depth of beauty where earlier comers saw only
sameness and dullness. The rich colour of the eucalypts makes the
canvases of Hans Heysen glow with a warmth that is transmitted to them
by a painter who loves the great trees of the forest. Such pictures as
Arthur Streeton's 'The Purple Noon's Transparent Might,' in the
Melbourne Gallery, and George Lambert's 'Black Soil Plains' in the
Sydney Gallery--both landscapes of striking beauty and power--are the
work of men who, having grown up amidst Australian scenery, have
afterwards studied abroad and brought to the interpretation of the
characteristics of their own country a technical accomplishment
acquired in the best schools.</p>

<p>In the creation of an Australian spirit the poets and the painters
have had their part; and in the days to come their service will be
esteemed hardly less than the excellence of their achievement.</p>

<p><a name="epilogue"></a></p>

<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>

<blockquote><b>Australian government from the beginning of settlement
to the present time has passed through all the phases from tyranny to
freedom. The five early governors--Phillip, Hunter, King, Bligh, and
Macquarie (1788-1820)--were little short of absolute rulers. The
Secretary of State, from his office in London, could check them if he
did not approve of their actions, but he was, in time-distance, nearly
six months away, his despatches were written at leisurely intervals,
and his comments rarely had much restraining
influence.</b></blockquote>

<p>From 1823-8 there was Crown-colony government, through the Governor
and a nominated Council. This system was modified from 1828-42 by the
admission of a few elected members. From 1842-56 there was
representative, but not responsible, government. In 1856 the era of
responsible government began.</p>

<p>The new system, however, was itself subject to a process of
development. Its full meaning was not grasped at the beginning, either
by governments in the Australian colonies or by Colonial Secretaries in
England. Thus, in 1878, when the Premier of Victoria, Graham Berry,
involved the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly in a
bitter quarrel, he went on a mission to London with the object of
persuading the Colonial Office to intervene. The Secretary of State
properly refused. Victoria had her constitution, which could be amended
by regular means, but it was not the duty of the Colonial Office to do
anything to alter that constitution. That was an example of a colonial
Premier failing to understand what was implied by responsible
government.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Secretary of State occasionally assumed an
unreasonable attitude. In 1888 the Governorship of Queensland being
vacant, the Premier of that State, McIlwraith, learnt that a certain
gentleman was likely to be chosen, who, he believed, would not be
<i>persona grata</i> to large numbers of the people. The Premier asked
to be consulted before the appointment was made. The Secretary of State
maintained that the Premier of a colony had no claim to be consulted. A
Governor was the representative of the Crown, and a colony must accept
the person whom the Secretary of State advised the Crown to appoint.
But as soon as this issue was raised it was seen that an unpopular
Governor would not be a fit representative of the Crown; so that the
Secretary of State had to retreat, and nominate another person. This,
and a similar case which arose a little later in South Australia,
established the practice of inquiring before a Governor was appointed
whether a gentleman whose name was submitted in confidence would be
acceptable to the colony concerned--a reasonable and courteous
procedure which worked perfectly.</p>

<p>A more serious instance of failure to consult an Australian
Government regarding a matter of importance occurred in 1907. In that
year the British Government came to an agreement with France regarding
the New Hebrides, and failed to inform the Government of the
Commonwealth that such action was even contemplated. In this instance
the explanation given was that a change of government had occurred in
Great Britain, and the new Secretary of State had overlooked the
obligation of informing Australia of what was proposed until the
agreement with France had been signed.</p>

<p>These misunderstandings arose not so much as to what responsible
government was, as about all that it implied. But there was good will
on both sides which prevented any serious differences from arising.
Tempers were somewhat ruffled for a short while, but no enduring sense
of grievance resulted.</p>

<p>Forms of government, however well designed they may be, can never
remain permanently rigid. Even despotisms are subject to modifications,
often with consequences unfortunate for the despots. Circumstances and
conditions of life change; the minds of men in successive generations
change; and the best government is not that which attempts to be in all
its parts fixed beyond amendment, but that which can be adapted to the
requirements of those who have to live under it. Changes should,
indeed, be made with studied prudence. Reckless change is madness. But
'panic dread of change' does not signify sanity. And no congregation of
law-makers is wise enough to frame a scheme of government which shall
stand like the Pyramids of Egypt, defiant of time. The ideal is a
government which shall fit the people like a glove, not restrain them
like a straight-jacket.</p>

<p>That British people in the homeland and in the Dominions have
effected a series of changes in their mode of government, adapting it
ever more closely to altered conditions and ideas, testifies to their
political intelligence. Respect has been shown for their history and
traditions by making these changes along lines of natural development.
The changes have been not revolutionary but evolutionary. Each reform
has grown out of preceding reforms; each has been brought about when
educated public opinion had become ripe for another step forward.</p>

<p>The first great change in the government of the Dominions flowed
from Lord Durham's important report on Canada in 1840. Thereby
responsible government was attained. But Durham did not propose to
leave the disposal of unoccupied land--of which there were immense
areas in Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand--to the
Governments of those countries. He would have left the control of crown
lands to the Colonial Office. He thought that the defence of the
colonies was entirely a matter for the Imperial Government. He did not
contemplate the probability that the colonies under responsible
government would adopt economic policies which did not harmonize with
the trading interests of Great Britain. He did not foresee that
Dominion Governments might desire to make treaties with foreign Powers.
Yet in these and several other important directions responsible
government did permit of the Dominions pursuing policies which were
within their self-governing powers, and did not lessen their fidelity
to the British Imperial system.</p>

<p>These developments were bewildering to foreign writers, who could
not understand how an Empire could continue to be an Empire unless all
its parts were controlled by a central authority. But they did not
puzzle people who had watched or studied the developments step by step,
and who knew how deeply the principle of self-government is implanted
in the minds of British people. For them, the process, and the reasons
for it, were plain.</p>

<p>The time came, however, when it was considered desirable to define
in legal form the position of the Dominions and their relations with
Great Britain. A step in that direction was taken by the Imperial
Conference in 1926 when it passed a resolution declaring that 'every
self-governing member of the Empire is now the master of its destiny.'
But that was somewhat vague. 'Destiny' is beyond 'mastery' by
definition. Many empires and nations which no longer exist supposed
themselves to be masters of their destiny, but were not saved from
extinction nevertheless. The Imperial Conference also adopted a
declaration, drafted by Mr. A. J. (afterwards Lord) Balfour, defining
the Dominions as 'autonomous communities within the British Empire,
equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another, in any aspect of
their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common
allegiance to the Crown and freely associated as members of the British
Commonwealth of Nations.' But the Imperial Conference, though composed
of very influential men, had no legislative authority. It could
formulate principles, but could not bring them out of the region of
opinion into that of law. What was wanted was a statement in black and
white, in the form of a statute, of the relations between Great Britain
and the Dominions. That purpose was attained by the passing of the
Statute of Westminster, 1931.</p>

<p>That Act sets forth that 'the Crown is the symbol of the free
association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.' It
guarantees the legislative independence of the Dominions by providing
that no law passed by the Parliament of a Dominion shall be void on the
ground that it is repugnant to the laws of England. No Act of the
Imperial Parliament shall extend to a Dominion unless a Dominion
requests to be brought under it. These two provisions, then, leave the
Dominions beyond control by any legislation of the Imperial Parliament,
and enable them to legislate free from restraint by the Imperial
Government.</p>

<p>This short Act of Parliament brought to a conclusion a process of
historical development within the British Empire. The Dominions, by its
means, form the group of States which are named in the Act itself 'the
British Commonwealth of Nations.' That descriptive group-name does not
separate them from the British Empire, but indicates that they occupy a
distinctive position within it. They are all Free States, and their
people enjoy the privileges of British citizenship.</p>

<p>This defined 'Dominion Status' implies obligations on both sides.
That the Imperial Parliament will not interpose in a matter affecting
the relations of the Commonwealth and the States was shown in 1934-5,
when the unfortunate movement in Western Australia for the secession of
that State resulted in a petition being prepared for presentation to
the Lords and Commons. The petitioners desired the Imperial Parliament
to pass an Act providing that after a proclaimed date Western Australia
should cease to be a State of the Commonwealth of Australia. The House
of Lords and the House of Commons appointed a joint committee to advise
whether the petition should be received. This committee in its report
(May 22, 1935) pointed out that in addition to the fact that the
Constitution of the Commonwealth, which Western Australia had accepted
in common with the other States, provided that all the States of
Australia had 'agreed to unite in one indissoluble constitution under
the Crown,' the Statute of Westminster affirmed the rule that the
Parliament of the United Kingdom would not pass any law affecting a
Dominion except at the request of that Dominion. The Western Australian
petition asked for legislative action 'which it would be
constitutionally incompetent for the Parliament of the United Kingdom
to take, except upon the definite request of the Commonwealth of
Australia conveying the clearly expressed wish of the Australian people
as a whole.' Therefore the petition was 'not proper to be received,'
and both Houses of the Imperial Parliament declined to receive it.</p>

<p>'Dominion Status' also implies that the advantages derived by the
Dominions from their association with the British Commonwealth of
Nations--the defensive power which they thereby acquire, the prestige
which they share from membership of a world-wide political
system--shall carry the obligation of fidelity to the British Empire in
the event of war. It is true that in the Second World War that began in
1939 the Irish Free State remained neutral, and legally all the other
Dominions were free to do the same if they had wished. But in fact all
the other dominions declared war on Germany, because once Britain was
at war they all considered that their own interests and security were
at stake. If the other dominions had followed the example of Eire, then
it would probably have spelt the end of the British Commonwealth of
Nations before very long. But the Australian people felt that so long
as they accept the advantages of membership of the British
Commonwealth, they must also share its dangers and
responsibilities.</p>

<p>The British Commonwealth is a great confederacy of nations,
independent within their own sphere, each member enjoying freedom to
shape its own destiny, as far as destiny can be shaped by policy. But
the whole is not only mightier than its parts, but grander. A French
author has expressed the view that the British Commonwealth 'furnishes
the most praiseworthy example of political creation which the world has
known since the dissolution of the Roman Empire.' And the British
Commonwealth is something more than a 'political creation.' It has a
moral cement which the Roman Empire lacked even in its best period. It
is founded on goodwill and animated by the spirit of co-operation. It
has grown into its present shape because its people desired that it
should develop in such a direction; and its achievement is beneficial
to them and to the world at large.</p>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES</h3>

<p>A sufficient bibliography of Australian history would absorb more
space than it would be judicious to allot to it in a work having the
scope and aim of this volume; nor is it proposed even to give a
complete list of the books which have been used by the author. But a
few brief notes concerning each chapter, to guide the reader who
desires to obtain more information on particular points, may be useful.
A valuable working bibliography is Mr. Arthur Wadsworth's CATALOGUE OF
THE LIBRARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENT (1912), which, though not
complete, is very full. It is arranged on the Dewey system, and has a
good index.</p>

<p>General histories of Australia include Rusden, HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA,
3 vols. (1897); Jenks, HISTORY OF THE AUSTRALASIAN COLONIES (1895),
especially valuable on legal points; Jose, HISTORY OF AUSTRALASIA (the
edition of 1911, published in Sydney, is excellent); and the same
author's AUSTRALASIA (London, 1901), which, though brief, is good.
Shann's ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA (Cambridge, 1930) is also very
useful.</p>

<p>CHAPTER I.--The pieces printed in R. H. Major's EARLY VOYAGES TO
TERRA AUSTRALIS (1859) are all of great value. They include Torres's
'Relation' of his voyage. Beazley's PRINCE HENRY THE NAVIGATOR gives a
good account of the Portuguese voyages. Markham, VOYAGES OF QUIROS,
translates and discusses the Spanish navigator's adventure at the New
Hebrides. Collingridge's FIRST DISCOVERY OF AUSTRALIA (1906) and the
same author's DISCOVERY OF AUSTRALIA (1895) are excellent surveys. The
best work on the subject is that of G. Arnold Wood, THE DISCOVERY OF
AUSTRALIA (1922). It is well illustrated with maps.</p>

<p>CHAPTER II.--J. E. Heeres, in THE PART BORNE BY THE DUTCH IN THE
DISCOVERY OF AUSTRALIA (printed in Dutch and English, 1899), gives a
well-illustrated account of that part of the subject. Backhouse
Walker's volume, EARLY TASMANIA (Hobart, 1902), includes an excellent
sketch of the life and voyages of Tasman. Coote's collection of
REMARKABLE MAPS (Amsterdam, 1895 et seq.) is an invaluable work.</p>

<p>CHAPTER III.--Dampier's VOYAGES have been reprinted, 1906. His Life,
by Clark Russell, is a good brief sketch. Cook's Journal, edited by
Admiral Wharton (1893), contains the authoritative account of the
<i>Endeavour</i> Voyage. Cook's log, and the journals of some of his
officers, are printed in Part I, Vol. I, of the HISTORICAL RECORDS OF
YEW SOUTH WALES. There are many biographies of Cook. The latest is by
Kitson (second edition, 1911).</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.--The principal documents respecting the foundation of
Sydney are printed in the HISTORICAL RECORDS OF NEW SOUTH WALES, Vol.
I., Part II. Becke and Jeffery's ADMIRAL PHILLIP is a serviceable
biography of the founder of Sydney. Phillip's AUTHENTIC JOURNAL (1788)
records the events of the voyage and the arrival of the First Fleet.
Scott's LIFE OF LAPEROUSE (Sydney, 1912) relates the reasons for the
appearance of the French ships in Botany Bay and the fate of the
expedition. Collins's ACCOUNT OF THE ENGLISH COLONY IN NEW SOUTH WALES
(reprinted 1910) is very valuable for this period.</p>

<p>CHAPTER V.--The literature concerning the convict system is
extensive. Many details are to be found in Vols. II. to VII. of the
HISTORICAL RECORDS OF NEW SOUTH WALES and the HISTORICAL RECORDS OF
AUSTRALIA. The reports of the House of Commons Committees on
Transportation, 1812 and 1837, and J. T. Bigge's reports, 1823, are of
the utmost value. Glimpses of the life of the convict settlement are
given in such books as R. W. Eastwick's MASTER MARINER, the MEMOIRS OF
JOSEPH HOLT, Roger Therry's REMINISCENCES, Macarthur's NEW SOUTH WALES
(1837), etc.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VI.--Documents relative to the governorships of Hunter,
King, and Bligh are printed in Vols. III. to VI. of the HISTORICAL
RECORDS OF NEW SOUTH WALES, and the despatches of Hunter and King are
contained in Vols. I. to V. of Series I. of the HISTORICAL RECORDS OF
AUSTRALIA. The EARLY RECORDS OF THE MACARTHURS OF CAMDEN (Sydney, 1914)
contains much useful information.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VII.--Bass's Journal of his whale-boat voyage to Westernport
is printed in Vol. III. of the HISTORICAL RECORDS. Scott's LIFE OF
FLINDERS (1914) treats of the work of Bass as well as of the subject of
the book; and the same author's TERRE NAPOLEON (1910) deals with
Baudin's French expedition. The LOGBOOKS OF THE <i>Lady Nelson</i> by
Ida Lee (London, 1915) is very valuable. Flinders's VOYAGE TO TERRA
AUSTRALIS (1814) is a fundamental authority. Collins is also of
first-class importance.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.--The material for this chapter is very scattered, and
much of the documentary information is unpublished. Amongst the books
which are useful are Bonwick's DISCOVERY AND SETTLEMENT OF FORT PHILLIP
(1856) and the same author's PORT PHILLIP SETTLEMENT (1883), West's
HISTORY OF TASMANIA (1832), Backhouse Walker's papers on the foundation
of Hobart and the first settlement of the Derwent in his EARLY TASMANIA
(1902), Labilliere's EARLY HISTORY OF VICTORIA (1878), and Gyles
Turner's HISTORY OF THE COLONY OF VICTORIA (1904).</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.--The HISTORICAL RECORDS OF NEW SOUTH WALES come to an
end with the commencement of Macquarie's governorship, but Vol. VII.
contains interesting material relative to his first two years of rule.
A COLONIAL AUTOCRACY by M. Phillips (1909) is an excellent study of his
administration. Bigge's Reports (1822-3) are of extreme importance.
Macquarie's Journals are in manuscript in the Mitchell Library,
Sydney.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X.--Cramp's STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS IN AUSTRALIA
(1913) summarizes the early constitutional enactments in a useful
manner. The history of the period has to be gleaned largely from the
columns of such journals as the <i>Australian</i>, the <i>Atlas</i>,
and the <i>Monitor</i>, all published in Sydney. Patchett Martin's LIFE
AND LETTERS OF ROBERT LOWE, VISCOUNT SHERBROOKE, is also useful.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XI.--Mrs. N. G. Sturt's LIFE OF CHARLES STURT (1899) and
Sturt's own TWO EXPEDITIONS INTO THE INTERIOR OF SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA
(1833) are invaluable records of these remarkable achievements.
Mitchell's THREE EXPEDITIONS INTO THE INTERIOR OF EASTERN AUSTRALIA
(1848) is an essential authority. Favenc's HISTORY OF AUSTRALIAN
EXPLORATION (1898) and the same author's EXPLORERS OF AUSTRALIA AND
THEIR LIFE WORK (1908) are very good and dependable works.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII.--The official papers respecting the foundation of
Western Australia, printed in the House of Commons Papers for 1829,
Vol. XXIV., 1830, Vol. XXI., are of primary importance. Irwin's STATE
AND POSITION OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA (1835) is a little book from the pen
of one who was a Governor of the colony. Evidence as to the
transportation system in Western Australia is contained in the ENGLISH
PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS for 1856, Vol. XVII. See also Battye's HISTORY OF
WESTERN AUSTRALIA (1924).</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIII.--Wakefield's ART OF COLONIZATION, published in 1849,
has been reprinted (1913). The best account of the application of
Wakefield's theories in Australia is in R. C. Mills, THE COLONIZATION
OF AUSTRALIA, THE WAKEFIELD EXPERIMENT IN EMPIRE BUILDING (1915).
Hodder's HISTORY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA (1893) was written largely from the
papers of George Fife Angas. The reports of the Colonization
Commissioners contained in the English Parliamentary Papers, 1836, Vol.
XXIX., and 1839, Vol. XVII.; and the reports of the select committee on
South Australia 1841, Vol. IV., are of the utmost value. Henderson's
LIFE OF SIR GEORGE GREY (1907) devotes particular attention to his work
in South Australia. A later work of importance is A. Grenfell Price's
FOUNDATION AND SETTLEMENT OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA (1924).</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.--The works of Labilliere and Gyles Turner, already
cited, and Bonwick's JOHN BATMAN (1867), are to be recommended. A paper
by the author on 'Lonsdale and the foundation of Melbourne' in the
VICTORIAN HISTORICAL MAGAZINE, Vol. IV. (1915), contains some fresh
material. Finn's ('Garryowen') CHRONICLES OF EARLY <i>Melbourne</i>
(1888) cannot be overlooked.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XV.--The histories of Tasmania by West and Fenton are the
best general sources of information. The Report of the House of Commons
Committee on Transportation, 1837-8, is full of interesting material.
Backhouse, NARRATIVE OF A VISIT TO THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES (1843),
Bonwick, THE LOST TASMANIAN RACE (1884) and Boxall, AUSTRALIAN
BUSHRANGING, are good.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVI.--Much of the important printed material concerning
squatting and land is contained in pamphlet literature and in the
legislation bearing upon the question. The whole subject requires more
study than has yet been given to it. The most comprehensive work is S.
H. Roberts's HISTORY OF AUSTRALIAN LAND SETTLEMENT (1924). The several
books of the Rev. Dr. LANG--PHILLIPSLAND (1847), COOKSLAND (1847),
HISTORICAL AND STATISTICAL ACCOUNT OF NEW SOUTH WALES (1834), etc.,
contain much that is interesting. Several memoirs by squatters, such as
Curr's RECOLLECTIONS OF SQUATTING IN VICTORIA (1883), the REMINISCENCES
OF ALEXANDER BERRY (1912), yield some interesting points. The EARLY
RECORDS OF THE MACARTHURS OF CAMDEN (1914) contains authentic
material.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII.--'The resistance to the convict transportation system'
is studied in a paper by the author in the VICTORIAN HISTORICAL
MAGAZINE, Vol. I. (1911). The reports of the English Prison
Commissioners for the period covered by the chapter explain what the
new system was. Lord Grey's COLONIAL POLICY OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF
LORD JOHN RUSSELL (1853) expounds the official case. The Sydney and
Melbourne newspapers of the period reveal the strength of the
resistance to the new transportation policy.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVIII.--The 'Papers re proposed alterations in the
Constitutions of the Australian Colonies' contained in the English
Parliamentary Papers, 1849, Vol. XXV., and those published during
1850-56 are of much interest, and the debates in the House of Commons
and the House of Lords on the Bill of 1850 are not negligible. Chapters
VII. and XL of Jenks's HISTORY OF THE AUSTRALASIAN COLONIES are a
valuable commentary on the constitutional history of the country.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIX.--Information concerning gold and other mining in
Australia is scattered over a wide variety of publications. The books
detailed in pp. 382-4 of the CATALOGUE OF THE COMMONWEALTH LIBRARY have
been taken as a guide for the chapter. A comprehensive treatise on
Australian mining from the historical and social point of view is much
required. The story of the Eureka Stockade is told in Gyles Turner's
OUR OWN LITTLE REBELLION (1912).</p>

<p>CHAPTER XX.--Grey's TWO EXPEDITIONS OF DISCOVERY IN AUSTRALIA
(1841), Eyre's JOURNALS OF EXPEDITIONS OF DISCOVERY (1845), McDouall
Stuart's EXPLORATION ACROSS THE CONTINENT OF AUSTRALIA (1861-2) and his
EXPLORATIONS IN AUSTRALIA (1865), Leichhardt's JOURNAL OF AN OVERLAND
EXPEDITION (1847), Landsborough's EXPLORATIONS OF AUSTRALIA (1867), and
his JOURNAL (1862), Sturt's NARRATIVE OF AN EXPEDITION INTO CENTRAL
AUSTRALIA (1849), Mitchell's JOURNAL OF AN EXPEDITION INTO THE INTERIOR
OF TROPICAL AUSTRALIA (1848), Forrest's EXPLORATIONS IN AUSTRALIA
(1875), are all first-hand narratives. Despatches respecting Burke and
Wills are in the English Parliamentary Papers, 1862, Vol. XXXVII.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.--Coote's HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND (1882) covers the early
period. Lang's COOKSLAND is useful. The story of the Port Curtis
settlement is told in J. F. Hogan's THE GLADSTONE COLONY (1898). Papers
on the separation of Moreton Bay from New South Wales are in the House
of Commons Papers for 1859, Vol. XVII.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXII.--The story of South Australia's undertaking to
administer the Northern Territory is contained in the documents in the
South Australian Parliamentary Papers from 1863-66. There are
interesting letters about the Port Essington settlement in the English
Parliamentary Papers, 1843, Vol. XXXIII.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIII.--The parliamentary debates and papers of the period
covered by the chapter need to be consulted to gain a thorough insight
into the controversies. Morris's MEMOIR OF GEORGE HIGINBOTHAM, (1895)
is good. Gyles Turner's HISTORY OF THE COLONY OF VICTORIA is strongly
biased against McCulloch and Berry. Sir George Bowen's THIRTY YEARS OF
COLONIAL GOVERNMENT (1889) is very valuable. Pratt's DAVID SYME (1908)
throws some sidelights on the questions at issue.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXIV.--The papers and parliamentary proceeding of the six
States, which are very voluminous records, are the chief sources of
information. Torrens's book on the SOUTH AUSTRALIAN SYSTEM OF
CONVEYANCING BY REGISTRATION OF TITLE (1859) explains his Real Property
Act. The facts about the various subjects discussed in the chapter are
drawn from too wide a field to be conveniently summarized.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXV.--The parliamentary papers relating to the Pacific and
New Guinea are of unusual interest. The New Guinea documents are in the
House of Commons Papers 1876, Vol. LIV., 1883, Vol. XLVII., 1884, Vol.
LV. The papers for 1884 also contain documents relating to New
Caledonia. The Kanaka labour traffic is dealt with in the papers for
1867-8, Vol. XLVIII. George Palmer, in his KIDNAPPING IN THE SOUTH SEAS
(1871), gives a personal narrative of experiences. Jacomb, FRANCE AND
ENGLAND IN THE NEW HEBRIDES (1914), is useful.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVI.--Quick and Garran's ANNOTATED CONSTITUTION OF THE
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH (1901) contains an excellent history of the
federation movement. The debates of the 1891 Convention were published
in one volume.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVII.--Quick and Garran, and Harrison Moore's COMMONWEALTH
OF AUSTRALIA (second edition, 1910), contain the best commentaries. The
debates of the 1897-8 Convention are printed in four volumes. B. R.
Wise, in THE MAKING OF THE AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH (1913), gives a racy
account of the process, but is not free from personal and political
prejudices.</p>

<p>CHAPTERS XXVIII and XXIX.--The materials for a study of the work of
the Federal Parliament and Government are to be found in the Acts,
Votes and Proceedings, Debates, and Parliamentary Papers. Gyles Turner
(1911) published a review of the FIRST DECADE OF THE AUSTRALIAN
COMMONWEALTH, strongly coloured by the political views of the author.
See also M. Willard's HISTORY OF THE WHITE AUSTRALIA POLICY (1923).</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXX.--The books relating to Australia's participation in the
war are numerous, and it is not proposed here to give a complete list
of them. The most important are selected. C. E. W. Bean (part author
and general editor), OFFICIAL HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA IN THE GREAT WAR, is
published under the authority of the Commonwealth Government. It is
very full, consisting of twelve volumes, and is lavishly illustrated.
Sir Charles Lucas (general editor), THE EMPIRE AT WAR, records the
Australian effort as part of the general imperial history. Sir John
Monash, THE AUSTRALIAN VICTORIES IN FRANCE, is of first-class
importance. P. F. E. Schuler, AUSTRALIA IN ARMS, A NARRATIVE OF THE
A.I.F., one of the earliest of the Australian war books, was written by
a young soldier who lost his life in the war. F. M. Cutlack, THE
AUSTRALIANS, THEIR FINAL CAMPAIGN, is a notably good work. Sir Ian
Hamilton, GALLIPOLI DIARIES, is a fascinating narrative by the
commander of the Gallipoli campaign. Staniforth Smith, AUSTRALIAN
CAMPAIGNS IN THE GREAT WAR, is a useful general summary. Sydney de
Loghe, THE STRAITS IMPREGNABLE, and John Masefield, GALLIPOLI, are both
eloquent and vivid. W. J. Denny, The Diggers; P. MacGill, THE DIGGERS,
THE AUSTRALIANS IN FRANCE; C. E. W. Bean, LETTERS FROM FRANCE; St. John
Adcock, AUSTRALASIA TRIUMPHANT; Sir E. Ashmead-Bartlett, DESPATCHES
FROM THE DARDANELLES, AN EPIC OF HEROISM; H. W. Nevinson, THE
DARDANELLES CAMPAIGN, are all notable books. W. S. Kent-Hughes, MODERN
CRUSADERS; and C. Barrett, AUSTRALIA IN PALESTINE, are valuable. L. E.
Reeves, AUSTRALIANS IN ACTION IN NEW GUINEA, and F. S. Bassett,
AUSTRALIA VERSUS GERMANY, THE STORY OF THE TAKING OF GERMAN NEW GUINEA,
deal with phases of the war in the Pacific. The following books are
concerned with the work of particular regiments and sections: A. D.
Ellis, THE STORY OF THE 5TH AUSTRALIAN DIVISION; F. C. Green, THE
FORTIETH; T. H. Darley, WITH THE NINTH LIGHT HORSE; W. Devine, THE
STORY OF A BATTALION; H. B. Collett, THE 28TH; E. Fairey, THE 38TH
BATTALION; M. B. B. Keatinge, WAR BOOK OF THE THIRD PIONEER BATTALION.
K. F. Cramp, AUSTRALIAN WINNERS OF THE VICTORIA CROSS, is also
useful.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXI.--The material for this chapter comes from a variety of
contemporary records, particularly the COMMONWEALTH YEAR BOOKS and
other official publications, especially for the war years the DIGEST OF
DECISIONS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXII.--The official reports of the Colonial and Imperial
Conferences contain material which is essential for the study of the
relations between the dominions and the mother-country in recent years.
The works of the writers mentioned in the chapter are all easily
procurable. There are several anthologies of Australian verse. The best
are those edited by Bertram Stevens (1906) and Walter Murdoch
(1918).</p>

<h3>APPENDIX - SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN AUSTRALIA</h3>

<blockquote><b>The original plan for a settlement of small
holdings--The growth of large estates--Organization on capitalist
basis--Rise of trade unions--Effect of gold discoveries on social
conditions--The growth of trade unions after 1850--The depression of
the 'nineties and the 'Great Strikes'--The growth of industrial

in Australia.</b></blockquote>

<p>The original plan of the British government was to establish a
settlement of small farmers and traders in Australia. Governor Phillip
had instructions to make small grants of land to convicts who had
served their sentences, and somewhat larger areas to free settlers and
members of the armed forces, who wished to settle. But free settlers
and officers soon found there was not enough profit to be made out of
small holdings, for the land round Sydney was not fertile and
productive. They began to buy up the land of ex-convicts and soldiers,
and to acquire large estates worked by labourers--mainly ex-convicts or
'assigned' convicts. The growth of large holdings was strongly
encouraged by John Macarthur's success in sheep-breeding, and by the
fact that he received a grant of 5,000 acres at Camden Park (near
Sydney) in 1805. Thereafter land grants were made in proportion to a
settler's capital, and so grants of thousands of acres were frequent.
These large holdings were partly necessary because of Australian soil
and conditions, but also because from about 1820 sheep-farming became
more important than agriculture. Crops were grown only for local
consumption, whereas grazing not only provided meat for the local
market but also exports of wool which steadily grew in importance. By
1850 Australia had become the world's chief EXPORTER of wool, and this
was nearly all produced on large 'runs.' This meant that the original
plan of settlement was scrapped; instead of Australia becoming a
country of small farms worked by their owners, as in Europe or in
Ireland, most farms were large and were worked by labourers.</p>

<p>Thus from an early period in Australian history there was a
relatively small class of employers and a relatively large class of
wage-earners. This is a fact of importance because until the
wage-earners were able to organize in strong trade unions, and to
obtain political rights, they were not able to do much to improve their
wages and working conditions, or their living conditions generally.
Thus while the 'squatters' were frequently able to make fortunes, or at
least to make very comfortable provision for their old age, this was
not so easy in the case of wage-earners who might often become a burden
on their families. Wages for shepherds employed on stations in the
period 1830-1850 were about 25 pounds a year with 'keep'; for
hut-keepers on 'stations' they were about 20 pounds a year with 'keep.'
These were perhaps the worst paid jobs and were mostly filled by 'old
lags' (ex-convicts), or even by 'assigned' convicts down to 1840. The
colonial-born Australians were generally able to earn better wages than
these; they took up more active jobs such as shearers and teamsters, or
horse-breakers and drovers, and were generally a much more independent
type. It is not difficult to understand why the squatters wanted
transportation to continue, for convicts were a source of cheap labour
to them. But by about 1835 British prisons were no longer able to
supply enough convicts to meet the needs of the growing wool industry.
That is partly why Britain began to assist emigrants to go to Australia
from 1832, by paying the greater part or even the whole of their
passage money. When transportation came to an end, the squatters were
glad to have these assisted immigrants, and right down to recent times
employers have been the chief supporters of assisted migration to this
country.</p>

<p>So long as employers depended mainly on 'assigned' convicts for
labour it was impossible of course to have trade unions. But gradually
in the towns, especially in Sydney, the number of free labourers began
to grow. As early as 1831 there were organizations among the skilled
artisans, such as printers and cabinet-makers, in Sydney. Since it was
illegal at this time to form trade unions they called themselves
'benefit societies'--to-day known as friendly societies--but there is
no doubt that they were also trade unions in the modern sense. Their
growth was slow until after 1850; they were confined to the capital
cities, and to skilled workers who were better able to take a stand
against their employers because their numbers were limited. The
assisted immigration of free labourers helped the growth of trade
unions a little, but it was the great flood of population that came
with the gold rushes after 1850 that enabled them to make their first
great advances.</p>

<p>The gold finds of the eighteen-fifties had revolutionary effects
upon Australian society. The total population, which had been about
438,000 at the end of 1851, was 1,168,000 by the end of 1861. About
three-quarters of the increase had come from immigration, and these
immigrants swamped the old ex-convict stock. But more than that, these
immigrants came in the first place to dig for gold, <i>to work for
themselves</i>. For the first ten years most of the gold was won by
'alluvial' mining--by washing the surface dirt. Then it became
increasingly difficult to make a living from 'alluvial' mining, and
those who stuck to mining had to take jobs with companies which had the
capital to sink deep shafts and install expensive machinery. But during
the eighteen-fifties there was a great shortage of labourers, because
so many went off to work on the 'diggings.' Moreover the rapidly
growing population meant a rapidly increasing demand for goods, so that
those who did take jobs could obtain higher wages. This was seen
particularly in the building trades, because there was a housing
shortage even worse than that at the end of the war of 1939-45. In 1857
more than 45,000 dwellings were of canvas, so that a large proportion
of the population were living in tents. Consequently between 1855 and
1858 the workers in the building trades in Sydney and Melbourne were
able to obtain an eight-hour day. They were able to do this, and also
to get higher wages, because of the greatly increased demand for labour
and a relative shortage of supply. Workers generally were able to
obtain higher wages; just before 1850 wages for skilled workers were
about 4/- to 5/- a day, but in 1855 they were 25/- to 30/-. Of course,
rates did not stay at this level. As unsuccessful 'diggers' went
looking for jobs wage-rates began to fall, and by 1860 they were down
to 10/- to 16/- a day. But wages never fell back to the old rates that
prevailed before 1850.</p>

<p>The rise in wages was due to several causes. In the first place
workers were producing a greater value per head, and so employers could
afford to pay more. But in addition there were other avenues opening up
for men beside a job at wages. The Selection Acts after 1861 made it
possible for men to take up small farms (40 to 320 acres, later up to
640 acres), and to buy them over a period of years on reasonable terms.
There was a good demand for their produce--wheat and dairy products--so
that sheep and wool-raising no longer had a practical monopoly of the
field. A third reason was that men were making more use of trade unions
to bargain with employers, and to maintain their wages and conditions.
Still another factor from 1865 was the rise of factory industries which
also offered alternative employments. It was no accident that Victoria
was the first State to use protective tariffs to establish industries,
because most of the gold miners were there and the Victorian government
was anxious that when they left mining they should not drift away. So
the first factories for woollen textiles, boots and shoes, and leather
goods were established in Victoria. Factory workers are easier to
organize than scattered rural workers, and so the growth of trade
unions was helped by factory development. Nevertheless, in spite of
closer settlement and new industries wages fell till about 1870, when
the daily wages for a skilled worker were from 8/6 to 10/-; still about
double what they had been twenty years earlier. They were kept at those
rates for the next twenty years, while a slight fall took place in the
cost of living. In 1903 Sir Timothy Coghlan, formerly Government
Statistician for New South Wales, said that the years 1872-1893 were
'the brightest period in Australia's history for the wage-earners.'</p>

<p>Trade unions played an important part in maintaining these gains in
this period. Outside the capital cities we see the first successful
trade unions being formed among the miners, first the coal miners of
the Newcastle district in 1861, and then the gold miners in the
Amalgamated Miners' Association of Victoria in 1872. A few years later
this became the Amalgamated Miners' Association of Australasia, taking
in members even in New Zealand, and reaching a membership of about
25,000. William Guthrie Spence became secretary of the A.M.A., and a
few years later he was asked to organize the shearers. Here was a field
where a trade union was certainly needed, for some of the 'bosses' gave
their 'hands' the roughest conditions imaginable. In 1886 shearers'
unions were organized in Queensland and Victoria; within a year Spence
had enrolled 9,000 members in the Amalgamated Shearers' Union. This
became the Australian Workers' Union (A.W.U.) in 1893, and ten years
later had a membership of 50,000. It still remains the chief
organization for rural workers--shearers, cane-cutters,
fruit-pickers--and is one of the leading unions. The Shearers' Union
was able to bring about great improvements in wages and conditions.</p>

<p>As a result of these developments the strength of the trade union
movement steadily increased down to about 1890. In 1840 there was only
one trade unionist in every 320 people in Australia; in 1885 there was
one in every 54. Nowadays there is about one in every seven, but the
law is very much more favourable towards them to-day than it was before
1885. Before 1850 trade unions were prohibited by law on pain of
imprisonment, but after 1855 Australian governments became more
tolerant, and ceased to prosecute workers for taking part in trade
union activities. Once again the 'diggers' were largely responsible for
this, just as they were for the Selection Acts to unlock the land, and
tariff protection to foster secondary industries. It was their pressure
in the eighteen-fifties which was largely responsible for, or the
adoption by, the States of democratic constitutions with MANHOOD
suffrage. With a democratic franchise governments had to treat
wage-earners more carefully--or risk defeat at the next elections.
Moreover the legislatures were no longer dominated by employers to the
same extent, and wage-earners were sometimes able to protect their
conditions by legislation. This was seen in matters of immigration,
when wage-earners in Victoria were able to obtain an act restricting
the immigration of Chinese as early as 1855. This was followed by
nearly all the other States, and was the beginning of the 'White
Australia' policy. But wage-earners also objected to their governments
bringing ASSISTED immigrants to Australia to compete in the labour
markets here, and so by 1890 Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales
and Tasmania, had all ceased paying for passages for assisted
immigrants. Moreover, through their political power, wage-earners were
able to gain improved status for trade unions. Although they were no
longer suppressed after 1850 trade unions were not recognized as 'legal
entities' in the way that joint-stock companies were. Consequently they
could not sue anyone in the courts to protect their property and funds.
South Australia was the first State to give legal recognition to trade
unions in this way in 1876, following the British example. All the
other States did likewise before 1890.</p>

<p>Another advance in this period was the organization of trade unions
on a national basis. Some of the workers, like the shearers and the
miners, were not confined within state boundaries. Their work might
take them across state boundaries, and it was clearly in the interest
of wage earners that wages and conditions should not be very different
in different States. So 'national' unions began to develop. Moreover it
was to the advantage of wage earners that the trade unions should as
far as possible have a common policy, whether they were state or
national. So in 1879 the first Australian Conference of Trade Unions
was held in Sydney, and these have been held frequently ever since.
These conferences were interested in such matters as getting uniform
factory laws in the various States, in a uniform immigration policy, in
obtaining payment for members of parliament and extending the
franchise. The first Shops and Factories Acts were also passed in this
period in order to limit the hours of work, and to see that working
conditions did not fall below a certain standard. By 1900 all States
except Tasmania had passed such legislation.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence above that wage-earners in Australia were
able to improve their 'standard of living' in many ways between 1850
and 1890. The average wage earner in 1890 was vastly better off than
his counterpart in 1850. But after 1890 this advance suffered a check,
and it took some ten years or more to recover from this setback. The
experience of the decade after 1893 showed very clearly that the
continued improvement of the 'standard of living' depended on the
general prosperity of the country being maintained. In 1893 began one
of the worst economic depressions in our history. It was caused in the
first place by the fall in prices of our exports such as wool, metals
and wheat. It became impossible to raise loans in England to build
railways and other necessary works, as had been done on a large scale
for some twenty years. So unemployment grew, wages fell, and working
conditions grew worse. Trade unions tried to resist the reduction of
wages, and the worsening of working conditions, and the years 1890-95
were marked by some of the most serious labour disputes in our
history--the 'great strikes of the 'nineties.' The conflict began with
a maritime strike, but soon the powerful shearers' union was involved,
and two more shearers' strikes occurred in Queensland during the next
few years. These were accompanied by acts of violence on both sides.
and the miners were also involved in a lengthy dispute at Broken Hill
in 1892. The unions were defeated in all these struggles because there
were so many unemployed as a result of the depression. Hungry men, with
no unemployment relief to keep them alive, volunteered for work which
the strikers refused; the solidarity of labour was broken. Neither the
employers nor strikers came out of the conflict with much credit, and
the general public suffered a great deal as a result of this turmoil.
There was a good deal of public sympathy with the trade unionists, and
little liking for some of the tactics of the employers, but in the end
the public got rather tired of being pushed around by the two
contending parties. They were very ready to find some scheme for
peaceful settlement of industrial disputes.</p>

<p>So the 'big strikes of the 'nineties' had several important results.
First, the trade union movement was broken for the time being, and it
did not regain its numbers for about fifteen years. It was in no
position to make any important gains for its members during this
period. But this had the effect of causing wage-earners to seek
improvements by political action, and led to the growth of the
political Labour Party. This actually began in New South Wales in 1890,
and it was soon in a position in the parliaments of the various states
to hold the balance of power between the two older political parties.
Thus they were able to obtain many concessions in return for supporting
one of the older political parties in office. Out of the failure of the
strikes also came the movement for industrial arbitration in
Australia--though of course this had to be introduced by political
action, by act of parliament. Thus came about the establishment of
Wages Boards in Victoria in 1896, and of a Court of Industrial
Arbitration in New South Wales in 1901. The industrial court has been
the form adopted by all the other states except Tasmania; it was also
adopted by the Commonwealth in 1904. The Commonwealth Court of
Conciliation and Arbitration is only concerned with disputes extending
beyond one state, but it quickly became the most important since most
trade unions are national in scope, with members in more than one
state. Trade unions are not obliged to resort to the court, but if they
favour industrial arbitration they register with it, and then all their
disputes must be referred to it. The dispute is settled if possible by
a conference of the parties involved, and if this fails then the court
gives judgment and imposes its decision.</p>

<p>A rather curious result of the defeat of trade unionism in the
'nineties was an attempt to found a socialist settlement called New
Australia in Paraguay. The inspirer of this Utopian venture was William
Lane, who settled in Brisbane in 1883. He had been the leading figure
in the Queensland labour movement while Spence had been busy in the
South. He did a great deal of hard work in building up the trade unions
in Queensland, and also a political party. But disillusioned by defeat
in 1894 he led a band of followers to build a new Jerusalem in
Paraguay. Socialism is not built, however, by adherents who run away
from their defeats to begin again in some 'green and pleasant land.' It
was no easier to establish socialism in Paraguay in 1894 than in
Queensland; in fact Queensland to-day is probably closer to socialism
than Paraguay, for although Lane departed others remained to work for
his ideal.</p>

<p>While the wage-earners were organizing to improve their conditions
there had also been a growth of a 'middle class,' especially of small
farmers. The selection acts helped to make land available for them, and
when an export-trade in wheat to England and Europe began about 1870 it
made possible a great expansion of wheat-farming. By 1890 Australia had
become one of the important wheat-exporting countries, and thousands
were occupied in growing wheat on farms most of which were worked by
the farmer and his family. The discovery of refrigeration and the cream
separator made it possible after 1885 to develop a similar export trade
in dairy products, and so thousands were also able to take up dairying
on small family-worked farms. Refrigeration also made it possible to
develop an export trade in frozen beef, mutton and lamb--and fat-lamb
raising could be carried on on medium-sized properties where there was
a good rainfall or irrigation. Irrigation began in Victoria after 1886,
and was mainly used in the Mildura and Renmark (South Australia)
districts for growing vines and citrus fruits. These are still the main
centres of the dried fruits and citrus fruit industry in Australia, and
they have been greatly expanded by a system of weirs and locks on the
river Murray. This encouragement of 'closer settlement' by small
farmers has continued right down to the present. As a result we do not
depend as much as we used to on the pastoral industry, though its
output is still more valuable than that of agriculture or dairying
alone.</p>

<p>But although closer settlement has helped to increase the number of
the middle class, their proportion of the population between 1911 and
1933 remained fairly steady. The censuses of these years showed that
wage and salary earners are easily the biggest class. In 1933 they made
up 77 per cent. of the working population, while workers on their own
account (i.e. farmers, small shopkeepers etc.) were only 15 per cent.,
and employers 8 per cent. It was only natural therefore that under
political democracy both State and Commonwealth governments should take
account of the needs and wishes of wage-earners, especially with the
rise of political Labour parties.</p>

<p>It is mainly in the period since federation that governments in
Australia have undertaken to provide 'social services'--such as public
health and education--for the people, and raised the money for these
purposes by taxation. This has come about largely because it is cheaper
for the State (or Commonwealth) to provide these on a large scale, and
also because if the government did not provide these services in many
cases they would not be provided at all. So governments, sometimes
local governments, have also provided railways, tramways, gas and
electricity supply, water supply and irrigation, in response to public
needs and demands. All parties have done their part in this growth of
collective action to provide public services, but probably the Labour
Party has been mainly responsible for measures of relief for the needy
and unfortunate though they certainly have not had a monopoly of
legislation of this kind. But measures such as the Workers'
Compensation Acts, providing compensation for injury incurred at work,
were introduced by the various States and the Commonwealth by 1915,
largely as a result of Labour pressure and in return for Labour
support.</p>

<p>The introduction of compulsory education goes back much before this
date. A system of 'free compulsory and secular' education was the ideal
of those who fought for democratic institutions in the days of the gold
rushes. This policy was adopted in Victoria in 1872, and by New South
Wales in 1880; it has been followed in all the States of the
Commonwealth. The provision for public education by the various States
has increased considerably since 1900; just before war began in 1939 it
was really about double the amount per head that was spent in 1901. But
there were many people who thought that much more needed to be done,
especially in certain States, and that the school leaving age should be
raised above 14 years. In Tasmania it has already been raised to 16
years, in New South Wales to 15, and Victoria is to make it 15 years as
soon as school accommodation has been provided for the increased
numbers. The Commonwealth also came into the field of education during
the war of 1939-1945, by providing allowances for University students
as well as money for research work to be done in the Universities. The
chief reason for this was that Australia needed more trained
scientists, doctors and engineers in order to make our best effort in
the common cause of the United Nations, but it seems likely that this
assistance to education will continue in the future. The opportunities
for everyone to obtain education are better now than they have ever
been--which is not the same as saying that they are as good as they
could or should be.</p>

<p>Just before federation the States began to make better provision for
public health, and South Australia passed a Public Health Act in 1898;
Queensland followed in 1900. By 1915 all the other States had passed
similar legislation to raise the standard of health of the people. The
Commonwealth also has powers to promote public health, especially
powers of quarantine to prevent the introduction of diseases from
overseas. But in addition the Commonwealth established its own
Department of Health in 1921. It makes its main contribution to the
health of the community by providing for a School of Tropical Medicine
(at Sydney), for research into causes of diseases, and also through the
Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The latter make available the
necessary serums for protecting the people by inoculation against
disease, and also undertakes the production of penicillin, the great
new discovery in the field of medicine.</p>

<p>Closely allied to the work of public health is the care for the
welfare of old people and invalids, of widows and orphans, of mothers
and babies. Some of these 'welfare services' have been carried out by
the health departments of the various States, for example by the
establishment of baby health centres which help mothers to look after
the health of their children. As a result of this work, of improved
medical care and knowledge, as well as the rising standard of living,
there has been a great reduction in the deaths of children in their
first year. In 1901 more than 10 per cent. of babies died in their
first year, but by 1941 it was only 4 per cent. There has also been a
great reduction in the death rate of the population as a whole, which
fell from nearly 15 per 1,000 in 1891 to less than 10 per thousand in
1941. The average length of life has grown because as a community we
have been growing richer, and because our knowledge of how to combat
disease has been increasing. But it is also because we have taken steps
to make better provision for the old, the needy, the sick and injured;
this work is no longer left mainly to voluntary charitable
organizations.</p>

<p>In 1908 the Commonwealth passed an Old Age Pensions Act, to provide
modest pensions for old people whose means were not sufficient for
their support. In 1912 it also provided maternity allowances to assist
mothers to meet the cost of bearing children. Invalid pensions were
also provided by the Commonwealth (1910) for people who by reason of
illness and incapacity are unable to maintain themselves. Pensions for
widows who are left with inadequate means of support have also been
introduced by the Commonwealth in the year 1942. In addition all the
States through the Workers' Compensation Acts see that people injured
in the course of their work are compensated. But one great evil
remained unprovided for by the governments until recently--that was
unemployment. Queensland introduced a system of Unemployment Insurance
in 1923, but there was no similar provision by other States.
Nevertheless during the great depression from 1930-34 all States found
it necessary to impose special unemployment taxes, and to spend large
sums on relief of the unemployed. This experience drew attention to the
need for a national system of health and unemployment benefits, and
after an abortive attempt in 1938 this was eventually provided by the
Commonwealth in the Social Security Act (1944). These measures have
been very important in raising the standard of living of the community
as a whole. The amount spent by the Commonwealth and States on public
health and welfare in this way amounted in 1939-40 to 34,000,000
pounds. This was nearly 5 pounds per head of population, and
represented three times as much as was being spent in the year before
the war of 1914.</p>

<p>Some people have criticized these measures for the welfare of the
poor and needy on the grounds that they will destroy people's
self-reliance, and their willingness to make provision for themselves.
The provision made, however, has not been so generous that people in
receipt of pensions or unemployment relief are as well off as if they
were fully employed. Nor is there any convincing evidence that public
care for the welfare of the people has decreased their will to save and
make provision for themselves. Before the introduction of old-age
pensions, workers' compensation and sickness benefits, wage-earners
commonly made provision against these things by membership of friendly
societies, such as the Australian Natives' Association, or through
their trade unions. In 1912 nearly 10 per cent. of the population
belonged to friendly societies, and it was still nearly 9 per cent. in
1938. The slight decline in reliance on the friendly society has been
due largely to the growth of private insurance. People have made more
and more use of life assurance, and 'industrial assurance,' to meet the
needs of old age, illness, and accident. Between 1920 and 1938 life
policies increased from 692,000 to 1,181,000, and their average value
from 243 pounds to 342 pounds; industrial policies grew from 904,000 to
2,368,000 and their average value from 29 pounds to 45 pounds. At the
same time deposits in savings banks went on increasing steadily, except
in the depression, and the average per head of population grew from 8
pounds in 1901 to 35 pounds in 1939. There is little indication here of
a decline in the willingness to save, but rather of a greater capacity
to save because of rising incomes.</p>

<p>The mention of rising incomes brings us to consider the question
whether the wage-earner is any better off than he was before the great
depression of the eighteen-nineties. Are his 'real' wages, that is,
measured in things that they will buy, any better? The answer is that
the average real wage in 1938 was over 30 per cent. higher than in
1891. How has this come about? Mainly because the working population
was able to produce more value per head because of better knowledge and
equipment. Over this period the output per person in work increased
about 50 per cent., and this made possible a rise in all incomes. But a
rise in the value of output produced does not AUTOMATICALLY bring a
rise in wages, any more than a fall brings about a reduction. These are
matters which have to be settled by bargaining--and sometimes by
strikes and lockouts. We have already seen how the suffering and loss
caused by industrial disputes in the 'nineties led to the introduction
of industrial arbitration. This has become the method by which
alterations of wages and working conditions are most commonly brought
about in Australia. The system of industrial arbitration which is in
vogue in Australia and New Zealand has not prevented strikes and
lock-outs in many cases, but it is fairly certain that it has greatly
reduced the amount of time lost through industrial disputes.</p>

<p>Nor has arbitration done away with the need for trade unions; on the
contrary it has fostered them, because the arbitration courts have
recognized trade unions as the representatives of the wage-earners. So
although some people are still very hostile to trade unions, and though
we may grumble when we suffer inconvenience, trade unions have come to
be accepted as one of our social institutions. For many years now it
has been recognized that our trade union movement is one of the most
effective in the world.</p>

<p>A particular feature of industrial arbitration in Australia is the
fixing of a basic wage, that is a minimum wage, for those industries
which are subject to awards of the Commonwealth or State Arbitration
Courts. The basic wage is the lowest wage that can be legally paid in
any industry that is subject to an award, but certain classes of
workers, for example domestic servants, do not work under awards.
However, the great majority of wage-earners have their wages regulated
by awards, or 'determinations' of wages boards. The basic wage was
first laid down by an award of the Commonwealth Court, which was given
by Henry Bourne Higgins in 1907 in the famous Harvester Judgment. This
wage was supposed to be the minimum sufficient for an unskilled worker
with a wife and three children. It became the basis of future awards
not only by the Commonwealth but also by the State arbitration courts.
It has been criticized by some who think it is too little especially
for a married man with children, and by others who claim it is too high
especially for unmarried men. With regard to the first criticism it
must be remembered that the majority of workers under awards receive
more than the basic wage, because they receive 'margins for skill' or
because of the prosperity of their industry which can afford to pay
rates above the basic wage. When Justice Higgins declared that a 'fair
and reasonable' wage for an unskilled worker would be 42/- a week, this
was a considerable advance on the average unskilled wage of 33/- in
1907. Since 1920 the basic wage has been adjusted to the cost of living
at regular intervals of six months, and since 1923 every three mouths.
In 1922 the basic wage was increased by the addition of 3/- a week by
Justice Powers--the 'Powers three shillings'--but in the depression in
1931 it was reduced by 10 per cent., which meant on the average a fall
in the basic wage from 86/- to 77/- a week. This reduction was partly
restored in 1934, and the real basic wage was more than fully restored
in 1937. It is possible that in view of the increase in output per
worker over the last forty years that the basic wage ought to be
higher, but few people in Australia quarrel with the PRINCIPLE that a
minimum wage should be prescribed.</p>

<p>There was certainly point in the criticism that the basic wage was
not enough for the married man with a large family. This was recognized
by the government of New South Wales which introduced a system of
allowances for children by a Child Endowment Act in 1926. But the
example was not followed in other States, and in 1940 the Commonwealth
introduced a system of child endowment. This was a payment of 5/- a
week, later raised to 7/6 a week, for each child in the family, after
the first, under the age of sixteen. In effect then the basic wage
became the minimum wage for the unskilled worker, his wife, and one
child; the incomes for all married workers with more than one child
were raised.</p>

<p>While wages have risen during the fifty years between 1891 and 1941
the average length of the working week has been reduced. Although many
unions had been able to get the eight-hour day, and the 48-hour week
for their members before 1891, the AVERAGE working week was much
longer. Even as late as 1907 the average working week was about 50
hours. This has been steadily reduced by awards until in 1940 the
average working week was 44 hours. In addition the working conditions
have also improved as a result of increased knowledge, and of the work
of factory inspectors, trade unions, arbitration courts and enlightened
employers.</p>

<p>As a result of improved social conditions the attitude of
wage-earners towards immigration seems to be changing. As Australia
began to recover from the long period of depression between 1893 to
1908 the demand for labour increased rapidly, and tens of thousands of
British immigrants came into Australia in the years just before the war
of 1914. Also the States returned to a policy of assisting these
immigrants by paying most of their passage money. This policy was
resumed after the war of 1914-18 as a result of joint action by the
Commonwealth and the British Governments. During the nineteen-twenties
there was considerable opposition from our trade unions to this
ASSISTANCE being given, since there was a certain amount of
unemployment from year to year even before the depression. There does
not at any time seem to have been any objection to those who came at
their own expense. With the onset of the depression the Scullin
(Labour) Government brought the scheme of assisted migration to an end.
It was never revived to any important extent down to 1939. But during
the nineteen-thirties people began to realize that our population was
growing very slowly, and that it might even cease to grow and begin to
decline within about forty years if things continued as they were. This
was regarded as undesirable for a number of reasons. Partly as a result
of this, partly because of the growth of 'social services,' and partly
because the policy of maintaining high employment has been accepted by
all parties, hostility towards assisted immigration has declined. The
Chifley (Labour) Government in 1945 began negotiations with the British
Government to help British people settle in Australia as soon as
conditions are suitable, and as soon ha housing conditions are good
enough. It is not likely, however, that immigration by itself will be
able to prevent an eventual decline in our population. The only certain
way to prevent this is some increase in the average size of the
Australian family.</p>

<p>Besides taking action to raise the standard of living by means of
social services, and by legislation to improve working and living
conditions, much has been done in other directions also. Commonwealth,
state and local governments have often undertaken to provide services
which are essential, or which tend to be 'natural monopolies.' In the
latter case public ownership and control are generally exercised so
that the public will not be exploited through excessive charges. So
state or local governments in Australia have undertaken to provide
tramway and other transport services, the supply of gas, water, and
electricity. Some of the most important public enterprises of this kind
are the State Electricity Commission's plant at Yallourn, Victoria, and
the Tasmanian Government's hydro-electric plant at Great Lake. Equally
important for a country of scanty rainfall are the great works which
store water for irrigation and other purposes, such as Burrinjuck
(N.S.W.), the Hume Weir on the upper Murray, and the weirs on the
Dawson and Stanley Rivers in Queensland. Railways are also a service
which have been provided almost entirely by the States and the
Commonwealth, and in relation to our population our railway mileage is
one of the largest in the world. The growth of motor traffic since 1900
has also led the various States to set up main roads boards to build
and keep up the main roads. Since 1926 they have been helped by the
Commonwealth, which has used some of the money raised by the import
duty on petrol to subsidise road-building by the States.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that Australians are a fortunate people.
Though they number little more than seven millions, (the figure reached
in 1939), they have a continent at their disposal. Though one-third of
this continent is sand or desert country, and another third is
semi-arid land good only for sparse grazing, there still remains a
large area that is suitable for closer settlement. Our country is
rather deficient in rivers and forests, but we can use our knowledge to
make the best of these resources and conserve them carefully. Our
mineral resources though not nearly so rich as those of America are
fairly good, and certainly adequate to develop the manufacturing
industries that we need. We are sometimes criticized because about
two-thirds of our population live in cities, but this in a common
feature in countries which have adopted modern mechanical methods of
production. We have been fortunate in having been able to draw on the
knowledge and resources of the Old World, and especially the British
Isles, to develop our country and to achieve a high standard of living.
Our rural industries are among the most efficient in the world, and if
we follow policies of wisdom our manufacturing industries should
gradually increase in efficiency and develop an important export trade.
But if we wish to continue in the peaceful enjoyment of our continent
it is not enough that we should be able to enjoy what is, relatively to
many other countries, an easy and pleasant life. We need to make our
