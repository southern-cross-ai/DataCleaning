  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; TIRED OF LIFE</h2>

  <p class="first">IT is sad enough at any time for a man to be compelled to
  confess himself a failure, but I think it will be admitted that it is doubly
  so at that period of his career when he is still young enough to have some
  flickering sparks of ambition left, while he is old enough to be able to
  appreciate at their proper value the overwhelming odds against which he has
  been battling so long and unsuccessfully.</p>

  <p>This was unfortunately my condition. I had entered the medical profession
  with everything in my favour. My father had built up a considerable
  reputation for himself, and, what he prized still more, a competency as a
  country practitioner of the old-fashioned sort in the west of England. I was
  his only child, and, as he was in the habit of saying, he looked to me to
  carry the family name up to those dizzy heights at which he had often gazed,
  but upon which he had never quite been able to set his foot. A surgeon I was
  to be, willy-nilly, and it may have been a throw-back to the parental
  instinct alluded to above, that led me at once to picture myself flying at
  express speed across Europe in obedience to the summons of some potentate
  whose life and throne depended upon my dexterity and knowledge.</p>

  <p>In due course I entered a hospital, and followed the curriculum in the
  orthodox fashion. It was not, however, until I was approaching the end of my
  student days that I was burnt with that fire of enthusiasm which was destined
  in future days to come perilously near consuming me altogether. Among the
  students of my year was a man by whose side I had often worked&mdash;with
  whom I had occasionally exchanged a few words, but whose intimate I could not
  in any way have been said to be. In appearance he was a narrow-shouldered,
  cadaverous, lantern-jawed fellow, with dark, restless eyes, who boasted the
  name of Kelleran, and was popularly supposed to be an Irishman. As I
  discovered later, however, he was not an Irishman at all, but hailed from the
  Black Country&mdash;Wolverhampton, if I remember rightly, having the right to
  claim the honour of his birth. His father had been the senior partner in an
  exceedingly wealthy firm of hardware manufacturers, and while we had been in
  the habit of pitying and, in some instances I am afraid, of looking down upon
  the son on account of his supposed poverty, he was, in all probability, in a
  position to buy up every other man in the hospital twice over.</p>

  <p>The average medical student is a being with whom the <i>world in</i>
  general has by this time been made fairly familiar. His frolics and
  capacity&mdash;or incapacity, as you may choose to term it&mdash;for work
  have been the subject of innumerable jests. If this be a true picture, then
  Kelleran was certainly different to the usual run of us. In his case the
  order was reversed: with him, work was play, and play was work; a jest was a
  thing unknown, and a practical joke a thing for which he allowed it to be
  seen that he had not the slightest tolerance.</p>

  <p>I have already said that my father had amassed a competency. I must now
  add that up to a certain point he was a generous man, and for this reason my
  allowance, under different circumstances, would have been ample for my
  requirements. As ill luck would have it, however, I had got into the wrong
  set, and before I had been two years in the hospital was over head and ears
  in such a quagmire of debt and difficulties that it looked as if nothing but
  an absolute miracle could serve to extricate me. To my father I dared not
  apply: easy-going as he was on most matters, I had good reason to know that
  on the subject of debt he was inexorable. And yet to remain in my present
  condition was impossible. On every side tradesmen threatened me; my
  landlady's account had not been paid for weeks; while among the men of the
  hospital not one, but several, held my paper for sums lost at cards, the mere
  remembrance of which was sufficient to send a cold shiver coursing down my
  back every time I thought of them. From all this it will be surmised that my
  position was not only one of considerable difficulty but that it was also one
  of no little danger. Unless I could find a sum either to free myself, or at
  least to stave off my creditors, my career, as far as the world of medicine
  was concerned, might be considered at an end. Even now I can recall the
  horror of that period as vividly as if it were but yesterday.</p>

  <p>It was on a Thursday, I remember, that the thunder-clap came. On returning
  to my rooms in the evening I discovered a letter awaiting me. With trembling
  fingers I tore open the envelope and drew out the contents. As I feared, it
  proved to be a demand from my most implacable creditor, a money-lender to
  whom I had been introduced by a fellow-student. The sum I had borrowed from
  him, with the assistance of a friend, was only a trifling one, but helped out
  by fines and other impositions it had increased to an amount which I was
  aware it was hopelessly impossible for me to pay. What was I to do? What
  could I do? Unless I settled the claim (to hope for mercy from the man
  himself was, to say the least of it, absurd), my friend, who, I happened to
  know, was himself none too well off at the moment, would be called upon to
  make it good. After that how should I be able to face him or any one else
  again? I had not a single acquaintance in the world from whom I could borrow
  a sum that would be half sufficient to meet it, while I dared not go down to
  the country and tell my father of my folly and disgrace. In vain I ransacked
  my brains for a loophole of escape. Then the whistle of a steamer on the
  river attracted my attention, filling my brain with such thoughts as it had
  never entertained before, and I pray, by God's mercy, may never know again.
  Here was a way out of my difficulty, if only I had the pluck to try it.
  Strangely enough, the effect it had upon me was to brace me like a draught of
  rare wine. This was succeeded by a coldness so intense that both mind and
  body were rendered callous by it. How long it lasted I cannot say; it may
  have been only a few seconds&mdash;it may have been an hour before
  consciousness returned and I found myself still standing beside the table,
  holding the fatal letter in my hand. Like a drunken man I fumbled my way from
  the room into the hot night outside. What I was going to do I had no notion.
  I wanted to be alone, in some place away from the crowded pavements, if
  possible, where I could have time to think and to determine upon my course of
  action.</p>

  <p>With a tempest of rage, against I knew not what or whom, in my heart, I
  hurried along, up one street and down another, until I found myself panting,
  but unappeased, upon the Embankment opposite the Temple Gardens. All round me
  was the bustle and life of the great city: cabs, containing men and women in
  evening dress, dashed along; girls and their lovers, talking in hushed
  voices, went by me arm in arm; even the loafers, leaning against the stone
  parapet, seemed happy in comparison with my wretched self. I looked down at
  the dark water gliding so pleasantly along below me, and remembered that all
  I had to do, as soon as I was alone, was to drop over the side, and be done
  with my difficulties for ever. Then in a flash the real meaning of what I
  proposed to do occurred to me.</p>

  <p>"You coward," I hissed, with as much vehemence and horror as if I had been
  addressing a real enemy instead of myself, "to think of taking this way out
  of your difficulty! If you kill yourself, what will become of the other man?
  Go to him at once and tell him everything. He has the right to know."</p>

  <p>The argument was irresistible, and I accordingly turned upon my heel and
  was about to start off in quest of the individual I wanted, when I found
  myself confronted with no less a person than Kelleran. He was walking
  quickly, and swung his cane as he did so. On seeing me he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Douglas Ingleby!" he said: "well, this is fortunate! You are just the man
  I wanted."</p>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">"You are just the man I wanted."</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>I murmured something in reply, I forget what, and was about to pass on. I
  had bargained without my host, however. He had been watching me with his keen
  dark eyes, and when he made as if he would walk with me I was not altogether
  surprised.</p>

  <p>"You do not object to my accompanying you I hope?" he inquired, by way of
  introducing what he had to say. "I've been wanting to have a talk with you
  for some days past."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm in rather a hurry just now," I answered, quickening my
  pace a little as I did so.</p>

  <p>"That makes no difference at all to me," he returned. "As I think you are
  aware, I am a fast walker. Since you are in a hurry, let us step out."</p>

  <p>We did so, and for something like fifty yards proceeded at a brisk pace in
  perfect silence. His companionship was more than I could stand, and at last I
  stopped and faced him.</p>

  <p>"What is it you want with me?" I asked angrily. "Cannot you see that I am
  not well to-night, and would rather be alone?"</p>

  <p>"I can see you are not quite yourself," he answered quietly, still
  watching me with his grave eyes. "That is exactly why I want to walk with
  you. A little cheerful conversation will do you good. You don't know how
  clever I am at adapting my manner to other people's requirements. That is the
  secret of our profession, my dear Ingleby, as you will some day find
  out."</p>

  <p>"I shall never find it out," I replied bitterly. "I have done with
  medicine. I shall clear out of England, I think&mdash;go abroad, try
  Australia or Canada&mdash;anywhere, I don't care where, to get out of
  this!"</p>

  <p>"The very thing!" he returned cheerily, but without a trace of surprise.
  "You couldn't do better, I'm sure. You are strong, active, full of life and
  ambition; just the sort of fellow to make a good colonist. It must be a grand
  life, that hewing and hacking a place for oneself in a new country, watching
  and fostering the growth of a people that may some day take its place among
  the powers of the earth. Ah! I like the idea. It is grand! It makes one
  tingle to think of it."</p>

  <p>He threw out his arms and squared his shoulders as if he were preparing
  for the struggle he had so graphically described. After that we did not walk
  quite so fast. The man had suddenly developed a strange fascination for me,
  and, as he talked, I hung upon his words with a feverish interest I can
  scarcely account for now. By the time we reached my lodgings, I had put my
  trouble aside for the time being, but when I entered my sitting-room and
  found the envelope which had contained the fatal letter still lying upon the
  table, it all rushed back upon me, and with such force that I was well-nigh
  overwhelmed. Kelleran meanwhile had taken up his position on the hearthrug,
  whence he watched me with the same expression of contemplative interest upon
  his face to which I have before alluded.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he said at last, after he had been some minutes in the house, and
  had had time to overhaul my meagre library, "what are these? Where did you
  pick them up?"</p>

  <p>He had taken a book from the shelf, and was holding it tenderly in his
  hand. I recognised it as one of several volumes of a sixteenth-century work
  on Surgery that I had chanced upon on a bookstall in Holywell Street some
  months before. Its age and date had interested me, and I had bought it more
  out of curiosity than for any other reason. Kelleran, however, could scarcely
  withdraw his eyes from it.</p>

  <p>"It's the very thing I've been wanting to make my set complete," he cried,
  when I had described my discovery of it. "Perhaps you don't know it, but I'm
  a perfect lunatic on the subject of old books. My own rooms, where, by the
  by, you have never been, are crammed from floor to ceiling, and still I go on
  buying. Let me see what else you have."</p>

  <p>So saying, he continued his survey of the shelves, humming softly to
  himself as he did so, and pulling out such books as interested him, and
  heaping them upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"You've the beginning of a by no means bad collection," he was kind enough
  to say, when he had finished. "Judging from what I see here, you must read a
  good deal more than most of our men."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not," I answered. "The majority of these books were sent up to
  me from the country by my father, who thought they might be of service to me.
  A mistaken notion, for they take up a lot of room, and I've often wished them
  at Hanover."</p>

  <p>"You have, have you? What a Goth you are!" he continued. "Well, then, I'll
  tell you what I'll do. If you want to get rid of them, I'll buy the lot,
  these old beauties included. They are really worth more than I can afford,
  but if you care about it, I'll make you a sporting offer of a hundred and
  fifty pounds for such as I've put upon the floor. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>I could scarcely believe I heard aright. His offer was so preposterous,
  that I could have laughed in his face.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," I cried, thinking for a moment that he must be joking
  with me, and feeling inclined to resent it, "what nonsense you talk! A
  hundred and fifty for the lot: why, they're not worth a ten-pound note, all
  told. The old fellows are certainly curious, but it is only fair that I
  should tell you that I gave five and sixpence for the set of seven volumes,
  complete."</p>

  <p>"Then you got a bargain such as you'll never find again," he answered
  quietly. "I wish I could make as good an one every day. However, there's my
  offer. Take it or leave it as you please. I will give you one hundred and
  fifty pounds for those books, and take my chance of their value. If you are
  prepared to accept, I'll get a cab and take them away to-night. I've got my
  chequebook in my pocket, and can settle up for them on the spot."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Kelleran, how can you afford to give such&mdash;" Here I
  stopped abruptly. "I beg your pardon&mdash;I know I had no right to say such
  a thing."</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it," he answered quietly. "I am not in the least offended,
  I assure you. I have always felt certain you fellows supposed me to be poor.
  As a matter of fact, however, I have the good fortune, or the ill, as I
  sometimes think, since it prevents my working as I should otherwise be forced
  to do, to be able to indulge myself to the top of my bent without fear of the
  consequences. But that has nothing to do with the subject at present under
  discussion. Will you take my price, and let me have the books, or not? I
  assure you I am all anxiety to get my nose inside one of those old covers
  before I sleep to-night."</p>

  <p>Heaven knows I was eager enough to accept, and if you think for one moment
  you will see what his offer meant to me. With such a sum I could not only pay
  off the money-lender, but well-nigh put myself straight with the rest of my
  creditors. Yet all the time I had the uneasy feeling that the books were by
  no means worth the amount he had declared to be their value, and that he was
  only making me the offer out of kindness.</p>

  <p>"If you are sure you mean it, I will accept," I said. "I am awfully hard
  up, and the money will be a godsend to me."</p>

  <p>"I am rejoiced to hear it," he replied, "for in that case we shall be
  doing each other a mutual good turn. Now let's get them tied up. If you
  wouldn't mind seeing to that part of the business, I'll write the cheque and
  call the cab."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later he and his new possessions had taken their departure,
  and I was back once more in my room standing beside the table, just as I had
  done a few hours before, but with what a difference! Then I had seen no light
  ahead, nothing but complete darkness and dishonour; now I was a new man, and
  in a position to meet the majority of calls upon me. The change from the one
  condition to the other was more than I could bear, and when I remembered that
  less than sixty minutes before I was standing on that antechamber of death,
  the Embankment, contemplating suicide, I broke down completely, and sinking
  into a chair buried my face in my hands and cried like a child.</p>

  <p>Next morning, as soon as the bank doors were open, I entered and cashed
  the cheque Kelleran had given me. Then, calling a cab, I made my way with a
  light heart, as you may suppose, to the office of the money-lender in
  question. His surprise at seeing me, and on learning the nature of my errand,
  may be better imagined than described. Having transacted my business with
  him, I was preparing to make my way back to the hospital, when an idea
  entered my head upon which I immediately acted. In something under ten
  minutes I stood in the bookseller's shop in Holy-well Street where I had
  purchased the volumes Kelleran had appeared to prize so much.</p>

  <p>"Some weeks ago," I said to the man who came forward to serve me, "I
  purchased from you an old work on medicine entitled 'The Perfect Chi-surgeon,
  or The Art of Healing as practised in divers Ancient Countries.'"</p>

  <p>"Seven volumes very much soiled&mdash;five and sixpence," returned the man
  immediately. "I remember the books."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad of that," I answered. "Now, I want you to tell me what you would
  consider the real value of the work."</p>

  <p>"If it were wanted to make up a collection it might possibly be worth a
  sovereign," the man replied promptly. "Otherwise, not more than we asked you
  for it."</p>

  <p>"Then you don't think any one would be likely to offer a hundred pounds
  for it?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>The man laughed outright.</p>

  <p>"Not a man in the possession of his wits," he answered. "No, sir, I think
  I have stated the price very fairly, though of course it might fetch a few
  shillings more or less, according to circumstances."</p>

  <p>"I am very much obliged to you," I said; "I simply wanted to know as a
  matter of curiosity."</p>

  <p>With that I left the shop and made my way to the hospital, where I found
  Kelleran hard at work. He looked up at me as I entered, and nodded, but it
  was lunch time before I got an opportunity of speaking to him.</p>

  <p>"Kelleran," I said, as we passed oat through the great gates, "you
  deceived me about those books last night. They were not worth anything like
  the value you put upon them."</p>

  <p>He looked me full and fair in the face, and I saw a faint smile flicker
  round the corners of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"My dear Ingleby," he said, "what a funny fellow you are, to be sure!
  Surely if I choose to give you what I consider the worth of the books I am at
  perfect liberty to do so. If you are willing to accept it, no more need be
  said upon the subject. The value of a thing to a man is exactly what he cares
  to give for it, so I have always been led to believe."</p>

  <p>"But I am convinced you did not give it because you wanted the books. You
  knew I was in straits and you took that form of helping me. It was generous
  of you indeed, Kelleran, and I'll never forget it as long as I live. You
  saved me from&mdash;but there, I cannot tell you. I dare not think of it
  myself. There is one thing I must ask of you. I want you to keep the books
  and to let the amount you gave me for them be a loan, which I will repay as
  soon as I possibly can."</p>

  <p>I was aware that he was a passionate man: for I had once or twice seen him
  fly into a rage, but never into a greater one than now.</p>

  <p>"Let it be what you please," he cried, turning from me. "Only for pity's
  sake drop the subject: I've had enough of it."</p>

  <p>With this explosion he stalked away, leaving me standing looking after
  him, divided between gratitude and amazement.</p>

  <p>I have narrated this incident for two reasons: firstly because it will
  furnish you with a notion of my own character, which I am prepared to admit
  exhibits but few good points; and in the second because it will serve to
  introduce to you a queer individual, now a very great person, whom I shall
  always regard as the Good Angel of my life, and, indirectly it is true, the
  bringer about of the one and only real happiness I have ever known.</p>

  <p>From the time of the episode I have just described at such length to the
  present day, I can safely say I have never touched a card nor owed a man a
  penny-piece that I was not fully prepared to pay at a moment's notice. And
  with this assertion I must revert to the statement made at the commencement
  of this chapter&mdash;the saddest a man can make. As I said then, there could
  be no doubt about it that I was a failure. For though I had improved in the
  particulars just stated, Fate was plainly against me. I worked hard and
  passed my examinations with comparative ease; yet it seemed to do me no good
  with those above me. The sacred fire of enthusiasm, which had at first been
  so conspicuously absent, had now taken complete hold of me; I studied night
  and day, grudging myself no labour, yet by some mischance everything I
  touched recoiled upon me, and, like the serpent of the fable, stung the hand
  that fostered it. Certainly I was not popular, and, since it was due almost
  directly to Kelleran's influence that I took to my work with such assiduity,
  it seems strange that I should also have to attribute my non-success to his
  agency. As a matter of fact, he was not a good leader to follow. From the
  very first he had shown himself to be a man of strange ideas. He was no
  follower or stickler for the orthodox; to sum him up in plainer words, he was
  what might be described as an experimentalist. In return, the authorities of
  the hospital looked somewhat askance upon him. Finally he passed out into the
  world, and the same term saw me appointed to the position of House Surgeon.
  Almost simultaneously my father died; and, to the horror of the family, an
  examination of his affairs proved that instead of being the wealthy man we
  had supposed him there was barely sufficient, when his liabilities were paid,
  to meet the expenses of his funeral. The shock of his death and the knowledge
  of the poverty to which she had been so suddenly reduced proved too much for
  my mother, and she followed him a few weeks later. Thus I was left, so far as
  I knew, without kith or kin in the world, with but few friends, no money, and
  the poorest possible prospects of ever making any.</p>

  <p>To the circumstances under which I lost the position of House Surgeon I
  will not allude. Let it suffice that I <i>did</i> lose it, and that, although
  the authorities seemed to think otherwise, I am in a position to prove,
  whenever I desire to do so, that I was not the real culprit The effect,
  however, was the same. I was disgraced beyond hope of redemption, and the
  proud career I had mapped out for myself was now beyond my reach for good and
  all.</p>

  <p>Over the next twelve months it would perhaps be better that I should draw
  a veil. Even now I scarcely like to think of them. It is enough for me to say
  that for upwards of a month I remained in London, searching high and low for
  employment. This, however, was easier looked for than discovered. Try how I
  would, I could hear of nothing. Then, wearying of the struggle, I accepted an
  offer made me, and left England as surgeon on board an outward-bound
  passenger steamer for Australia.</p>

  <p>Ill luck, however, still pursued me, for at the end of my second voyage
  the Company went into liquidation, and its vessels were sold. I shipped on
  board another boat in a similar capacity, made two voyages in her to the
  Cape, where on a friend's advice I bade her goodbye, and started for Ashanti
  as surgeon to an Inland Trading Company. While there I was wounded in the
  neck by a spear, was compelled to leave the Company's service, and eventually
  found myself back once more in London tramping the streets in search of
  employment. Fortunately, however, I had managed to save a small sum from my
  pay, so that I was not altogether destitute; but it was not long before this
  was exhausted, and then things looked blacker than they had ever done before.
  What to do I knew not. I had long since cast <i>my</i> pride to the winds,
  and was now prepared to take anything, no matter what. Then an idea struck
  me, and on it I acted.</p>

  <p>Leaving my lodgings on the Surrey side of the river, I crossed Blackfriars
  Bridge, and made my way along the Embankment in a westerly direction. As I
  went I could not help contrasting my present appearance with that I had shown
  on the last occasion I had walked that way. Then I had been as spruce and
  neat as a man could well be; boasted a good coat to my back and a new hat
  upon my head. Now, however, the coat and hat, instead of speaking for my
  prosperity, as at one time they might have done, bore unmistakable evidence
  of the disastrous change which had taken place in my fortunes. Indeed, if the
  truth must be confessed, I was about as sorry a specimen of the professional
  man as could be found in the length and breadth of the Metropolis.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>Reaching the thoroughfare in which I had heard that Kelleran had taken up
  his abode, I cast about me for a means of ascertaining his number. Compared
  with that in which I myself resided, this was a street of palaces, but it
  seemed to me I could read the characters of the various tenants in the
  appearance of each house-front. The particular one before which I was
  standing at the moment was frivolous in the extreme: the front door was
  artistically painted, an elaborate knocker ornamented the centre panel, while
  the windows were without exception curtained with dainty expensive stuffs.
  Everything pointed to the mistress being a lady of fashion; and having put
  one thing and another together, I felt convinced I should not find my friend
  there. The next I came to was a residence of more substantial type. Here
  everything was solid and plain, even to the borders of severity. If I could
  sum up the owner, he was a successful man, a lawyer for choice, a bachelor,
  and possibly, and even probably, a bigot on matters of religion. He would
  have two or three friends&mdash;not more&mdash;all of whom would be advanced
  in years, and, like himself, successful men of business. He would be able to
  appreciate a glass of dry sherry, and would have nothing to do with anything
  that did not bear the impress of a gilt-edged security. As neither of these
  houses seemed to suggest that they would be likely to know anything of the
  man I wanted, I made my way further down the street, looking about me as I
  proceeded. At last I came to a standstill before one that I was prepared to
  swear was inhabited by my old friend. His character was stamped unmistakably
  upon every inch of it: the untidy windows, the pile of books upon a table in
  the bow, the marks upon the front door where his impatient foot had often
  pressed while he turned his latchkey: all these spoke of Kelleran, and I was
  certain my instinct was not misleading me. Ascending the steps, I rang the
  bell. It was answered by a tall and somewhat austere woman of between forty
  and fifty years of age, upon whom a coquettish frilled apron and cap sat with
  incongruous effect. As I afterwards learnt, she had been Kelleran's nurse in
  bygone years, and since he had become a householder had taken charge of his
  domestic arrangements, and ruled both himself and his maidservants with a rod
  of iron.</p>

  <p>"Would you be kind enough to inform me if Mr. Kelleran is at home?" I
  asked, after we had taken stock of each other.</p>

  <p>"He has been abroad for more than three months," the woman answered
  abruptly. Then, seeing the disappointment upon my face, she added, "I don't
  know when we may expect him home. He may be here on Saturday, and it's just
  possible we may not see him for two or three weeks to come. But perhaps
  you'll not mind telling me what your business with him may be?"</p>

  <p>"It is not very important," I answered humbly, feeling that my position
  was, to say the least of it, an invidious one. "I am an old friend, and I
  wanted to see him for a few minutes. Since, however, he is not at home, it
  does not matter, I assure you. I shall have other opportunities of
  communicating with him. At the same time, you might be kind enough to tell
  him I called."</p>

  <p>"You'd better let me know your name first," she replied, with a look that
  suggested as plainly as any words could speak that she did not for an instant
  believe my assertion that I was a friend of her master's.</p>

  <p>"My name is Ingleby," I said. "Mr. Kelleran will be sure to remember me.
  We were at the same hospital."</p>

  <p>She gave a scornful sniff as if such a thing would be very unlikely, and
  then made as if she would shut the door in my face. I was not, however, to be
  put off in this fashion. Taking a card from my pocket, one of the last I
  possessed, I scrawled my name and present address upon it and handed it to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps if you will show that to Mr. Kelleran he would not mind writing
  to me when he comes home," I said. "That is where I am living just now."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the card, and, noting the locality, sniffed even more
  scornfully than before. It was evident that this was the only thing wanting
  to confirm the bad impression I had already created in her mind. For some
  seconds there was an ominous silence.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she answered, at length, "I'll give it to him. But&mdash;why,
  Heaven save us! what's the matter? You're as white as a sheet. Why didn't you
  say you were feeling ill?"</p>

  <p>I had been running it rather close for more than a week past, and the news
  that Kelleran, my last hope, was absent from England had unnerved me
  altogether. A sudden giddiness seized me, and I believe I should have fallen
  to the ground had I not clutched at the railings by my side. It was then that
  the real nature of the woman became apparent. Like a ministering angel she
  half led, half supported me into the house, and seated me on a chair in the
  somewhat sparsely furnished hall.</p>

    <p class="caption">Like a ministering angel she half led, half supported me
    into the house.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Friend of the master, or no friend," I heard her say to herself, "I'll
  take the risk of it."</p>

  <p>I heard no more, for my senses had left me. When they returned I found
  myself lying upon a sofa in Kelleran's study, the housekeeper standing by my
  side, and a maidservant casting sympathetic glances at me from the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I have put you to a lot of trouble," I said, as soon as I had
  recovered myself sufficiently to speak. "I cannot think what made me go off
  like that. I have never done such a thing in my life before."</p>

  <p>"You can't think?" queried the woman, with a curious intonation that was
  not lost upon me. "Then it's very plain you've not much wit about you. I
  think, young man, I could make a very good guess at the truth if I wanted to.
  How-somever, let that be as it may, I'll put a bit of it right before you
  leave this house, or my name's not what it is." Then turning to the maid, who
  was still watching me, she continued sharply, "Be off about your business,
  miss, and do as I told you. Are you going to waste all the afternoon standing
  there staring about you like a baby?"</p>

  <p>The girl tossed her head and disappeared, only to return a few minutes
  later with a tray, upon which was set out a substantial meal of cold
  meat.</p>

  <p>On the old woman's ordering me to do so I sat down to it, and dined as I
  had not done for months past.</p>

  <p>"There," she said, with an air of triumph as I finished, "that will make a
  new man of you." Then, having done all she could for me, and repenting,
  perhaps, of the leniency she had shown me, she returned to her former abrupt
  demeanour, and informed me, in terms there was no mistaking, that her time
  was valuable, and it behoved me to be off about my business as soon as
  possible. While she had been speaking, my eyes had travelled round the room
  until they lighted upon the mantelpiece (it was covered with pipes, books,
  photographs, and all the innumerable odds and ends that accumulate in
  <i>a</i> bachelor's apartment), where I discovered my own portrait with
  several others. I remembered having given it to Kelleran two years before. It
  was not a very good one, but with its assistance I proposed to establish my
  identity and prove to my stern benefactress that I was not altogether the
  impostor she believed me to be.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you how grateful I am to you for all you have done," I
  said, as I rose and prepared to take my departure from the house. "At the
  same time I am very much afraid you do not altogether believe that I am the
  friend of your master's that I pretend to be."</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut!" she answered. "If I were in your place I'd say no more about
  that. Least said soonest mended, is my motto. I trust, however, I'm a
  Christian woman, and do my best to help folk in distress. But I've warned ye
  already that I've eyes in my head and wit enough to tell what's o'clock just
  as well as my neighbours. Why, bless my soul, you don't think I've been all
  my years in the world without knowing what's what, or who's who?"</p>

  <p>She paused as if for breath; and, embracing the opportunity, I crossed the
  room and took from the chimneypiece the photograph to which I have just
  alluded.</p>

  <p>"Possibly this may help to reassure you," I said, <i>as</i> I placed it
  before her. "I do not think I have changed so much, since it was taken, that
  you should fail to recognise me."</p>

  <p>She picked up the photo and looked at it, reading the signature at the
  bottom with a puzzled face.</p>

  <p>"Heaven save us, so it <i>is</i>!" she cried, when the meaning of it
  dawned upon her. "You are Mr. Ingleby, after all? Well, I am a softy, to be
  sure. I thought you were trying to take me in. So many people come here
  asking to see him, saying they were at the hospital with him that you've got
  to be more than careful. If I'd have thought it really was you, I'd have
  bitten my tongue out before I'd have said what I did. Why, sir, the master
  talks of you to this day: it's Ingleby this, and Ingleby that, from morning
  till night. Many's the time he's made inquiries from gentlemen who've been
  here, in the hopes of finding out what has become of ye."</p>

    <p class="caption">"It's Ingleby this, and Ingleby that, from morning till
    night."</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"God bless him!" I said, my heart warming at the news that he had not
  forgotten me. "We were the best of friends once."</p>

  <p>"But, Mr. Ingleby," continued the old woman after a pause, "if you'll
  allow me to say so, I don't like to see you like this. You must have seen
  <i>a</i> lot of trouble, sir, to have got in such a state."</p>

  <p>"The world has not treated me very kindly," I answered, with an attempt at
  a smile, "but I'll tell Kelleran all about it when I see him. You think it is
  possible he may be home on Saturday?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so, sir, I'm sure," she replied. "You may be certain I'll give him
  your address, and tell him you've called, the moment I see him."</p>

  <p>I thanked her again for her trouble, and took my departure, feeling a very
  different man as I went down the steps and turned my face citywards. In my
  own heart I felt certain Kelleran would do something to help me. Had I known,
  however, what that something was destined to be, I wonder whether I should
  have awaited his coming with such eagerness.</p>

  <p>As it transpired, it was on the Friday following my call at his house
  that, on returning to my lodgings after another day's fruitless search for
  employment, I found the following letter awaiting me. The handwriting was as
  familiar to me as my own, and it may be imagined with what eagerness I tore
  open the envelope and scanned the contents. It ran:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">My Dear Ingleby</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter">"It was a pleasant welcome home to find that you are in
  England once more. I am sorry, however, to learn from my housekeeper that
  affairs have not been prospering with you. This must be remedied, and at
  once. I flatter myself I am just the man to do it. It is possible you may
  consider me unfeeling when I say that there never was such luck as your being
  in want of employment at this particular moment. I've a billet standing ready
  and waiting for you; one of the very sort you are fitted for, and one that
  you will enjoy, unless you have lost your former tastes and inclinations. You
  have never met Dr. Nikola, but you must do so without delay. I tell you,
  Ingleby, he is the most wonderful man with whom I have ever been brought in
  contact. We chanced upon each other in St. Petersburg three months ago, and
  since then he's fascinated me as no other man has ever done. I have spoken of
  you to him, and in consequence he dines with me to-night in the hope of
  meeting you. Whatever else you do, therefore, do not fail to put in an
  appearance. You cannot guess the magnitude of the experiment upon which he is
  at work. At first glance, and in any other man, it would seem incredible,
  impossible, I might almost say absurd. When, however, you have seen him, I
  venture to think you will not doubt that he will carry it through. Let me
  count upon you to-night, then, at seven.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Always your friend,</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Andrew Fairfax
  Kelleran</span>."</p><br>

  <p>I read the letter again. What did it mean? At any rate, it contained a ray
  of hope. It would have to be a very curious billet, I told myself, under
  present circumstances, that I would refuse. But who was this extraordinary
  individual, Dr Nikola, who seemed to have exercised such a fascination over
  my enthusiastic friend? Well, that I had to find out for myself.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; A NEW IMPETUS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE clocks in the neighbourhood had scarcely ceased striking
  as I ascended the steps of Kelleran's house and rang the bell. Even had he
  not been so impressive in his invitation there was small likelihood of my
  forgetting the appointment I had been waiting for it, hour by hour, with an
  impatience that can only be understood when I say that each one was bringing
  me nearer the only satisfying meal I had had since I last visited his
  abode.</p>

  <p>The door was opened to me by the same faithful housekeeper who had proved
  herself such a ministering angel on the previous occasion. She greeted me as
  an old friend, but with a greater respect than she had shown when we had last
  talked together. This did not prevent her, however, from casting a
  scrutinising eye over me, as much as to say, "You look a bit more
  respectable, my lad, but your coat is very faded at the seams, your collar is
  frayed at the edge, and you sniff the smell of dinner as if you have not had
  a decent meal for longer than you care to think about"; all of which, had she
  put it into so many words, would have been perfectly true.</p>

  <p>"Step inside," she said; "Mr. Kelleran's waiting for you in the study, I
  know." Then sinking her voice to a whisper she added: "There's duck and green
  peas for dinner, and as soon as the other gentleman arrives I shall tell cook
  to dish. He'll not be long now."</p>

  <p>What answer I should have returned I cannot say, but as she finished
  speaking a door farther down the passage opened, and my old friend made his
  appearance, with the same impetuosity that always characterised him.</p>

  <p>"Ingleby, my dear fellow," he cried, as he ran with outstretched hand to
  greet me, "I cannot tell you how pleased I am to see you again. It seems
  years since I last set eyes on you. Come in here; I want to have a good look
  at you. We've hundreds of things to say to each other, and heaps of questions
  to ask, haven't we? And, by Jove, we must look sharp about it too, for in a
  few minutes Nikola will be here. I asked him to come at a quarter past seven,
  in order that we might have a little time alone together first."</p>

  <p>So saying, he led me into his study, the same in which I had returned to
  my senses after my fainting fit a few days before, and when he had done so he
  bade me seat myself in an easy chair.</p>

  <p>"You can't think how good it is to see you again, Kelleran," I said, as
  soon as I could get in a word. "I had begun to think myself forgotten by all
  my friends."</p>

  <p>"Bosh!" was his uncompromising reply. "Talk about your friends&mdash;why,
  you never know who they are till you're in trouble! At least, that's what I
  think. And, by the way, let me tell you that you <i>do</i> look a bit pulled
  down. I wonder what idiocy you've been up to since I saw you last. Tell me
  about it. You won't smoke a cigarette before dinner? Very good! now fire
  away!"</p>

  <p>Thus encouraged, I told him in a few words all that had befallen me since
  we had last met. While I was talking he stood before me, his face lit up with
  interest, and to all intents and purposes as absorbed in my story as if it
  had been his own.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, thank goodness it is all over now," he said, when I had
  brought my tale to a conclusion. "I think I've found you a billet that will
  suit you admirably, and if you play your cards well there's no saying to what
  it may not lead. Nikola is the most marvellous man in the world, as you will
  admit when you have seen him. I, for one, have never met anybody like him;
  and as for this new scheme of his, why, if he brings it off, I give you my
  word it will revolutionise Science."</p>

  <p>I was too well acquainted with my friend's enthusiastic way of talking to
  be surprised at it; at the same time I was thoroughly conversant with his
  cleverness, and for this reason I was prepared to believe that, if he thought
  well of any scheme, there must be something out of the common in it.</p>

  <p>"But what is this wonderful idea?" I asked, scarcely able to contain my
  longing, as the fumes of dinner penetrated to us from the regions below. "And
  how am I affected by it?"</p>

  <p>"That I must leave for Dr. Nikola to tell you himself," Kelleran replied.
  "Let it suffice for the moment that I envy you your opportunity. I believe if
  I had been able to avail myself of the chance he offered me of going into it
  with him, I should have been compelled to sacrifice you. But there, you will
  hear all about it in good time, for if I am not mistaken that is his cab
  drawing up outside now. It is one of his peculiarities to be always punctual
  to the moment What do you make the right time by your watch?"</p>

  <p>I was obliged to confess that I possessed no watch. It had been turned
  into the necessaries of existence long since. Kelleran must have realised
  what was passing in my mind, though he pretended not to have noticed it; at
  any rate he said, "I make it a quarter past seven to the minute, and I am
  prepared to wager that's our man."</p>

  <p>A bell rang, and almost before the sound of it had died away the study
  door opened, and the housekeeper, with a look of awe upon her face which had
  not been there when she addressed me, announced "Dr. Nikola."</p>

  <p>Looking back on it now, I find that, in spite of all that has happened
  since, my impressions of that moment are as fresh and clear as if it were but
  yesterday. I can see the tall, lithe figure of this extraordinary man, his
  sallow face, and his piercing black eyes steadfastly regarding me, as if he
  were trying to determine whether or not I was capable of assisting him in the
  work upon which he was so exhaustively engaged. Never before had I seen such
  eyes; they seemed to look me through and through, and to read my inmost
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman, my dear Kelleran," he began, after they had shaken hands,
  and without waiting for me to be introduced to him, "should be your friend
  Ingleby, of whom you have so often spoken to me. How do you do, Mr. Ingleby?
  I don't think there is much doubt but that we shall work admirably together.
  You have lately been in Ashanti, I perceive."</p>

  <p>I admitted that I had, and went on to inquire how he had become aware of
  it; for as Kelleran had not known it until a few minutes before, I did not
  see how he could be acquainted with the fact.</p>

  <p>"It is not a very difficult thing to tell," he answered, with a smile at
  my astonishment, "seeing that you carry about with you the mark of a Gwato
  spear. If it were necessary I could tell you some more things that would
  surprise you: for instance, I could tell you that the man who cut the said
  spear out for you was an amateur at his work, that he was left-handed, that
  he was short-sighted, and that he was recovering from malaria at the time.
  All this is plain to the eye; but I see our friend Kelleran fancies his
  dinner is getting cold, so we had better postpone our investigations for a
  more convenient opportunity."</p>

  <p>We accordingly left the study and proceeded to the dining-room. All day
  long I had been looking forward to that moment with the eagerness of a
  starving man, yet when it arrived I scarcely touched anything. If the truth
  must be confessed, there was something about this man that made me forget
  such mundane matters as mere eating and drinking. And I noticed that Nikola
  himself was even more abstemious. For this reason, save for the fact that he
  himself enjoyed it, the bountiful spread Kelleran had arranged for us was
  completely wasted.</p>

  <p>During the progress of the meal no mention was made of the great
  experiment upon which our host had informed me Nikola was engaged. Our
  conversation was mainly devoted to travel. Nikola, I soon discovered, had
  been everywhere, and had seen everything. There appeared to be no place on
  the face of the habitable globe with which he was not acquainted, and of
  which he could not speak with the authority of an old resident. China, India,
  Australia, South America, North, South, East, and West Africa, were as
  familiar to him as Piccadilly, and it was in connection with one of the
  last-named Continents that a curious incident occurred.</p>

  <p>We had been discussing various cases of catalepsy; and to illustrate an
  argument he was adducing, Kelleran narrated a curious instance of lethargy
  with which he had become acquainted in Southern Russia. While he was speaking
  I noticed that Nikola's face wore an expression that was partly one of
  derision and partly of amusement.</p>

  <p>"I think I can furnish you with an instance that is even more
  extraordinary," I said, when our host had finished; and as I did so, Nikola
  leaned a little towards me. "In fairness to your argument, however, Kelleran,
  I must admit that while it comes under the same category, the malady in
  question confines itself almost exclusively to the black races on the West
  Coast of Africa."</p>

  <p>"You refer to the Sleeping Sickness, I presume?" said Nikola, whose eyes
  were fixed upon me, and who was paying the greatest attention to all I
  said.</p>

  <p>"Exactly&mdash;the Sleeping Sickness," I answered. "I was fortunate enough
  to see several instances of it when I was on the West Coast, though the one
  to which I am referring did not come before me personally, but was described
  to me by a man, a rather curious character, who happened to be in the
  district at the time. The negro in question, a fine healthy fellow of about
  twenty years of age, was servant to a Portuguese trader at Cape Coast Castle.
  He had been up country on some trading expedition or other, and during the
  whole time had enjoyed the very best of health. For the first few days after
  his return to the coast, however, he was unusually depressed. Slight swelling
  of the cervical glands set in, accompanied by a tendency to fall asleep at
  any time. This somnolency gradually increased; cutaneous stimulation was
  tried, at first with comparative success; the symptoms, however, soon
  recurred, the periods of sleep became longer and more frequent, until at last
  the patient could scarcely have been said to be ever awake. The case, so my
  informant said, was an extremely interesting one."</p>

  <p>"But what was the result?" inquired Kelleran, a little impatiently. "You
  have not told us to what all this is leading."</p>

  <p>"Well, the result was that in due course the patient became extremely
  emaciated&mdash;a perfect skeleton, in fact. He would take no food, answered
  no questions, and did not open his eyes from morning till night. To make a
  long story short, just as my informant was beginning to think that the end
  was approaching, there appeared in Cape Coast Castle a mysterious stranger
  who put forward claims to a knowledge of medicine. He forgathered with my
  man, and after a while obtained permission to try his hand upon the
  negro."</p>

  <p>"And killed him at once, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort. The result was one that you will scarcely credit.
  The whole business was most irregular, I believe, but my friend was not
  likely to worry himself much about that. This new man had his own
  pharmacopoeia&mdash;a collection of essences in small bottles, more like what
  they used in the Middle Ages than anything else, I should imagine. Having
  obtained possession of the patient, he carried him away to a hut outside the
  town and took him in hand there and then.</p>

  <p>"The man who told me about it, and who, I should have said, had had a good
  experience of the disease, assured me that he was as certain as any one
  possibly could be that the chap could not live out the week; and yet when the
  new-comer, ten days later, invited him to visit the hut, there was the man
  acting as his servant, waiting at table, if you please, and to all intents
  and purposes, though very thin, as well as ever he had been in his life."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear fellow," protested Kelleran, "Guerin says that out of the
  148 cases that came under his notice 148 died."</p>

  <p>"I can't help what Guerin says," I answered, a little warmly I am afraid.
  "I am only telling you what my friend told me. He gave me his word of honour
  that the result was as he described. The strangest part of the whole
  business, however, has yet to be told. It appears that the man had not only
  cured the fellow, but that he had the power of returning him to the condition
  in which he found him, at will. It wasn't hypnotism, but what it was is more
  that I can say. My informant described it to me as being about the uncanniest
  performance he had ever witnessed."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" asked Kelleran. "Furnish us with a more detailed account.
  There was a time when you were a famous hand at a diagnosis."</p>

  <p>"I would willingly do so," I answered; "unfortunately, however, I can't
  remember it all. It appears that he was always saying the most mysterious
  things and putting the strangest questions. On one occasion he asked my
  friend, as they were standing by the negro's bedside, if there was any one
  whose image he would care to see? Merton at first thought he was making fun
  of him, but seeing that he was in earnest he considered for a moment, and
  eventually answered that he would very much like to see the portrait of an
  old shipmate who had perished at sea some six or seven years prior to his
  arrival on the West Coast. As soon as he had said this the man stooped over
  the bed and opened the sleeping nigger's eyes. 'Examine the retina, he said,
  and I think you will see what you want.' My friend looked."</p>

  <p>"With what result?" inquired Kelleran. Nikola said nothing, but smiled, as
  I thought, a trifle sceptically.</p>

  <p>"It seems an absurd thing to say, I know," I continued, "but he swore to
  me that he had before him the exact picture of the man he had referred to;
  and what is more, standing on the deck of the steamer just as he had last
  seen him. It was as clear and distinct as if it had been a photograph."</p>

  <p>"And all the time the negro was asleep?"</p>

  <p>"Fast asleep!" I answered.</p>

  <p>"I should very much like to meet your friend," said Kelleran emphatically.
  "A man with an imagination like that must be an exceedingly interesting
  companion. But seriously, my dear Ingleby, you don't mean to say you wish us
  to believe that all this really happened?"</p>

  <p>"I am telling you what he told me," I answered. "I cannot swear to the
  truth of it, of course, but I will go so far as to say that I do not think he
  was intentionally deceiving me."</p>

  <p>Kelleran shrugged his shoulders incredulously, and for some moments an
  uncomfortable silence ensued. This was broken by Nikola.</p>

  <p>"My dear Kelleran," he said, "I don't think you are altogether fair to our
  friend Ingleby. As he admits, he was only speaking on hearsay, and under
  these circumstances he might very easily have been deceived. Fortunately,
  however, for the sake of his reputation I am in a position to corroborate all
  he has said."</p>

  <p>"The deuce you are!" cried Kelleran; while I was too much astonished to
  speak, and could only stare at him in complete surprise. "What on earth do
  you mean? Pray explain."</p>

  <p>"I can only do so by saying that I was the man who did this apparently
  wonderful thing."</p>

  <p>Kelleran and I continued to stare at him in amazement. It was too absurd.
  Could he be laughing at us? And yet his face was serious enough.</p>

  <p>"You do not seem to credit my assertion," said Nikola, quietly. "And yet I
  assure you it is correct. I was the mysterious individual who appeared in
  Cape Coast Castle, who brought with him his own pharmacopoeia, and who
  wrought the miracle which your friend appears to have considered so
  wonderful."</p>

  <p>"The coincidence is too extraordinary," I answered, as if in protest.</p>

  <p>"Coincidences are necessarily extraordinary," Nikola replied. "I do not
  see that this one is more so than usual."</p>

  <p>"And the miracle?"</p>

  <p>"Was in reality no miracle at all," he answered; "it was merely the
  logical outcome of a perfectly natural process. Pray do not look so
  incredulous. I am aware that my statement is difficult to believe, but I
  assure you, my dear Ingleby, that it is quite true. However, proof is always
  better than mere assertion, so, since you are still sceptical, let me make my
  position right with you. For reasons that will be self-evident I cannot
  produce the effect in a negro's eye, but I can do so in a way that will
  strike you as being scarcely less extraordinary. If you will draw up your
  chairs I will endeavour to explain."</p>

  <p>Needless to remark, we did as he desired; and when we were seated on
  either side of him waited for the manifestation he had promised us.</p>

  <p>Taking a small silver box, but little larger than a card-case, from his
  pocket, he opened it and tipped what might have been a teaspoonful of black
  powder into the centre of a dessert plate. I watched it closely, in the hope
  of being able to discover of what it was composed. My efforts, however, were
  unavailing. It was black, as I have already said, and from a distance
  resembled powdered charcoal. This, however, it could not have been, by reason
  of its strange liquidity, which was as great as that of quicksilver, and
  which only came into operation when it had been exposed to the air for some
  minutes. Hither and thither the stuff ran about the dish, and I noticed that
  as it did so it gradually lost its original sombre hue and took to itself a
  variety of colours that were as brilliant as the component tints of the
  spectrum. These scintillated and quivered till the eyes were almost blinded
  by their radiance, and yet they riveted the attention in such a manner that
  it was well-nigh, if not quite, impossible to look away or to think of
  anything else. In vain I tried to calm myself, in order that I might be a
  cool and collected observer of what was taking place. Whether there was any
  perfume thrown off by the stuff upon the plate I cannot say, but as I watched
  it my head began to swim and my eyelids felt as heavy as lead. That this was
  not fancy upon my part is borne out by the fact that Kelleran afterwards
  confessed to me that he experienced exactly the same sensations. Nikola,
  however, was still manipulating the dish, turning it this way and that, as if
  he were anxious to produce as many varieties of colour as possible in a given
  time. It must have been upwards of five minutes before he spoke. As he did so
  he gave the plate an extra tilt, so that the mixture ran down to one side. It
  was now a deep purple in colour.</p>

  <p>"I think if you will look into the centre of the fluid you will see
  something that will go a long way towards convincing you of the truth of the
  assertion I made just now," he said quietly, but without turning his head to
  look at me.</p>

  <p>I looked as he desired, but at first could see nothing save the mixture
  itself, which was fast turning from purple to blue. This blue grew gradually
  paler; and as I watched, to my astonishment, a picture formed itself before
  my eyes. I saw a long wooden house, surrounded on all sides by a deep
  verandah. The latter was covered with a beautiful flowering creeper. On
  either side of the dwelling was a grove of palms, and to the right, showing
  like a pool of dazzling quicksilver between the trees, was the sea. And
  pervading everything was the sensation of intense heat. At first glance I
  could not recall the house, but it was not long before I recognised the
  residence of the man who had told me the story which had occasioned this
  looked at it again, and could even see the window of the room in which I had
  recovered from my first severe attack of fever, and from which I never
  thought to have emerged alive. With the sight of it the recollection of that
  miserable time came back to me, and Kelleran and even his friend Nikola were,
  for the moment, forgotten.</p>

  <p>"From the expression upon your face I gather that you know the place,"
  said Nikola, after I had been watching it for a few moments. "Now look into
  the verandah, and tell me if you recognise the two men you see seated
  there."</p>

  <p>I looked again, and saw that one was myself, while the other, the man who
  was leaning against the verandah rail smoking a cigar, was the owner of the
  house itself. There could be no mistake about it. The whole scene was as
  plain before my eyes as if it had been a photograph taken on the spot.</p>

  <p>"There," said Nikola, with a little note of triumph in his voice, "I hope
  that will convince you that when I say I can do a thing, I mean it"</p>

  <p>So saying he tilted the saucer, and the picture vanished in a whirl of
  colour. I tried to protest, but before I had time to say anything the liquid
  had in some strange fashion resolved itself once more into a powder, Nikola
  had tipped it back into the silver box, and Kelleran and I were left to put
  the best explanation we could upon it. We looked at each other, and, feeling
  that I could not make head or tail of what I had seen, I waited for him to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"I never saw such a thing in my life," he cried, when he had found
  sufficient voice. "If any one had told me that such a thing was possible I
  would not have believed him. I can scarcely credit the evidence of my senses
  now."</p>

  <p>"In fact, you feel towards the little exhibition I have just given you
  very much as you did to Ingleby's story a quarter of an hour ago," said
  Nikola. "What a doubting world it is, to be sure! The same world which
  ridiculed the notion that there could be anything in vaccination, in the
  steam engine, in chloroform, the telegraph, the telephone, or the phonograph.
  For how many years has it scoffed at the power of hypnotism! How many of our
  cleverest scientists fifty years ago could have foretold the discovery of
  argon, or the possibility of being able to telegraph without the aid of
  wires? And because the little world of to-day knows these things and has
  survived the wonder of them, it is convinced it has attained the end of
  wisdom. The folly of it! To-night I have shown you something for which less
  than a hundred years ago I should have been stoned as a wizard. At my death
  the secret will be given to the world, and the world, when it has recovered
  from its astonishment, will say, 'How very simple! why did no one discover it
  before?' I tell you, gentlemen," Nikola continued, rising and standing before
  the fireplace, "that we three, to-night, are standing on the threshold of a
  discovery which will shake the world to its foundations."</p>

  <p>When he had moved, Kelleran and I had also pushed back our chairs from the
  table, and were now watching him as if turned to stone. The sacred fire of
  enthusiasm, which I thought had left me for ever, was once more kindling in
  my breast, and I hung upon his words as if I were afraid I might lose even a
  breath that escaped his lips. As for Nikola himself, his usually pallid face
  was aglow with excitement.</p>

  <p>"The story is as old as the hills," he began. "Ever since the days when
  our first parents trod the earth there have been men who have aimed at
  discovering a means of lengthening the span of life. From the very infancy of
  science, the wisest and cleverest have devoted their lives to the study of
  the human body, in the hope of mastering its secret. Assisting in the search
  for that particular something which was to revolutionise the world, we find
  Zosimus the Theban, the Jewess Maria, the Arabian Geber, Hermes Trismegistus,
  Linnaeus, Berzelius, Cuvier, Raymond Lully, Paracelsus, Roger Bacon, De
  Lisle, Albertus Magnus, and even Dr. Price. Each in his turn quarried in the
  mountain of Wisdom, and died having failed to discover the hidden treasure
  for which he sought. And why? Because, egotistical as it may seem on my part
  to say so, they did not seek in the right place. They commenced at the wrong
  point, and worked from it in the wrong direction. But if they failed to find
  what they wanted, they at least rendered good service to those who were to
  follow after, for from every failure something new was learned. For my part I
  have studied the subject in every form, in every detail. For more years than
  I can tell you, I have lived for it, dreamed of it, fought for it, and
  overcome obstacles of the very existence of which no man could dream. The
  work of my predecessors is known to me; I have studied their writings, and
  tested their experiments to the last particular. All the knowledge that
  modern science has accumulated I have acquired. The magic of the East I have
  explored and tested to the uttermost. Three years ago I visited Thibet under
  extraordinary circumstances. There, in a certain place, inaccessible to the
  ordinary man, and at the risk of my own life and that of the brave man who
  accompanied me, I obtained the information which was destined to prove the
  coping-stone of the great discovery I have since made. Only two things were
  wanting then to . . complete the whole and to enable me to get to work. One
  of these I had just found in St. Petersburg when I first met you, Kelleran;
  the other I discovered three weeks ago. It has been a long and tedious
  search, but such labour only makes success the sweeter. The machinery is now
  prepared; all that remains is to fit the various parts together. In six
  months' time, if all goes well, I will have a man walking upon this earth
  who, under certain conditions, shall live a thousand years."</p>

  <p>I could scarcely believe that I heard aright. Was the man deliberately
  asking us to believe that he had really found the way to prolong human life
  indefinitely? It sounded very much like it, and yet this was the Nineteenth
  Century and . . . But at this point I ceased my speculations. Had I not, only
  that evening, witnessed an exhibition of his marvellous powers? If he had
  penetrated so far into the Unknowable&mdash;at least what we considered the
  unknowable&mdash;as to be able to work such a miracle, why should we doubt
  that he could carry out what he was now professing to be able to do?</p>

  <p>"And when shall we be permitted to hear the result of your labours?" asked
  Kelleran with a humility that was surprising in a man usually so
  self-assertive.</p>

  <p>"Who can say?" asked Nikola. "These things are more or less dependent on
  Time. It may be only a short period before I am ready; on the other hand a
  lifetime may elapse. The process is above all a gradual one, and to hurry it
  might be to spoil everything. And now, my dear Kelleran, with your permission
  I will bid you good-night. I leave for the North at daybreak, and I have much
  to do before I go. If I am not taking you away too soon, Ingleby, perhaps you
  would not mind walking a short distance with me. I have a good deal to say to
  you."</p>

  <p>"I shall be very pleased," I answered; and the look that Kelleran gave me
  showed me that he considered my decision a wise one.</p>

  <p>"In that case come along," said Nikola. "Good-night, Kelleran, and many
  thanks for the introduction you have given me. I feel quite sure Ingleby and
  I will get on admirably together."</p>

  <p>He shook hands with Kelleran, and passed into the hall, leaving me alone
  with the man who had proved my benefactor for the second time in my life.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, old fellow," I said, as I shook him by the hand. "I cannot
  thank you sufficiently for your goodness in putting me in the way of this
  billet. It has given me another chance, and I shan't forget your kindness as
  long as I live."</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd," Kelleran answered. "You take things too seriously. I
  feel sure the advantage is as much Nikola's as yours. He's a wonderful man,
  and you're the very fellow he requires: between you, you ought to be able to
  bring about something that will upset the calculations of certain pompous old
  fossils of our acquaintance. Good-night, and good luck to you!"</p>

  <p>So saying, he let us out by the front door, and stood upon the doorstep
  watching us as we walked down the street. It was an exquisite night. The moon
  was almost at the full, and her mellow rays made the street almost as light
  as day. My companion and I walked for some distance in silence. He did not
  speak, and I already entertained too much respect for him to interrupt his
  reverie. More than once I glanced at his tall, graceful figure, and the
  admirably shaped head, which seemed such a fitting case for the extraordinary
  brain within.</p>

  <p>"As I said just now," he began at length, as if he were continuing a
  conversation which had been suddenly interrupted, "I leave at daybreak for
  the North of England. For the purposes of the experiment I am about to make,
  it is vitally necessary that I should possess a residence far removed from
  other people, where I should not run any risk of being disturbed. For this
  reason I have purchased Allerdeyne Castle, in Northumberland, a fine old
  place overlooking the North Sea. It is by no means an easy spot to get at,
  and should suit my purposes admirably. I shall not see you before I go, so
  that whatever I have to say had better be said at once. To begin with, I
  presume you have made up your mind to assist me in the work I am about to
  undertake?"</p>

  <p>"If you consider me competent," I answered, "I shall be only too glad to
  do so."</p>

  <p>"Kelleran has assured me that I could not have a better assistant," he
  replied, "and I am willing to take you upon his recommendation. If you have
  no objection to bring forward, we may as well consider the matter settled.
  Have you any idea as to the remuneration you will require?"</p>

  <p>I answered that I had not, and that I would leave it to him to give me
  whatever he considered fair. In reply he named a sum that almost took my
  breath away. I remarked that I should be satisfied with half the amount,
  whereupon he laughed good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we're neither of us good business men," he said. "By all the
  laws of trade, on finding that I offered you more than you expected, you
  should have stood out for twice as much. Still, I like you all the better for
  your modesty. Now my road turns off here, and I will bid you good-night. In
  an hour I will send my servant to you with a letter containing full
  instructions. I need scarcely say that I am sure you will carry them out to
  the letter."</p>

  <p>"I will do so, come what may," I answered seriously.</p>

  <p>"Then good-night," he said, and held out his hand to me. "All being well,
  we shall meet again in two or three days."</p>

  <p>"Good-night," I replied.</p>

  <p>Then, with a wave of his hand to me, he sprang into a hansom which he had
  called up to the pavement, gave the direction to the driver, and a moment
  later was round the corner and out of sight. After he had gone, I continued
  my homeward journey.</p>

  <p>I had not been in the house an hour before I was informed that some one
  was at the door desiring to see me. I accordingly hurried downstairs, to find
  myself face to face with the most extraordinary individual I have ever seen
  in my life. At first glance I scarcely knew what to make of him, but when the
  light from the hall lamp fell upon his face, I saw that he was a Chinaman,
  and the ugliest I have ever seen in all my experience of the Mongolian race.
  His eyes squinted terribly, and a portion of his nose was missing. It was the
  sort of face one sees in a nightmare, and, accustomed as I was by my
  profession to horrible sights, I must admit my gorge rose at him. At first it
  did not occur to me to connect him with Nikola.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to see me?" I inquired, in some astonishment.</p>

  <p>He nodded his head, but did not speak. "What is it about?" I continued. He
  uttered a peculiar grunt, and produced a letter and a small box from his
  pocket, both of which he handed to me. I understood immediately from whom he
  came. Signing to him to remain where he was until I could tell him whether
  there was an answer, I turned into the house and opened the letter. Having
  read it, I returned to the front door.</p>

  <p>"You can tell Dr. Nikola that I will be sure to attend to it," I said.
  "You savee?"</p>

  <p>He nodded his head, and next moment was on his way down the street. When
  he was out of sight I returned to my bedroom, and, lighting the gas, once
  more perused the communication I had received. As I did so a piece of paper
  fell from between the leaves. I picked it up, to discover that it was a
  cheque for one hundred pounds payable to myself. The letter ran:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">My dear Ingleby</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter">"According to the promise I made you this evening, I am
  sending you herewith by my Chinese servant, your instructions, as clearly
  worked out as I can make them. To begin with, I want you to remain in town
  until Monday next. On the morning of that day, if all goes well, you will be
  advised by the agent of the Company in London of the arrival in the river of
  the steamship <i>Dona Mercedes,</i> bound from Cadiz to Newcastle. On receipt
  of that information you will be good enough to board her and to inquire for
  Don Miguel de Moreno and his great-granddaughter, who are passengers by the
  boat to England. I have already arranged with the Company for your passage,
  so you need have no anxiety upon that score.</p>

  <p class="letter">"You will find the Don a very old man, and I beg that you
  will take the greatest possible care of him. For this reason I have sent you
  the accompanying drugs, each of which is labelled with the fullest
  instructions. They should not be made use of unless occasion absolutely
  requires."</p><br>

  <p>(Here followed a list of the various symptoms for which I was to watch,
  and an exhaustive <i>resume</i> of the treatment I was to employ in the event
  of certain contingencies arising.)</p>

  <p class="letter">"On the arrival of the vessel in Newcastle"&mdash;the
  letter continued&mdash;"I will communicate with you again. In the meantime I
  send you what I think will serve to pay your expenses until we meet.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Believe me,</p>

  <p class="letter">"Your sincere friend,</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Nikola</span>."</p>

  <p class="letter">"P.S.&mdash;One last word of warning. Should you by any
  chance be brought into contact with a certain Mongolian of very sinister
  appearance, with half an ear missing, have nothing whatsoever to do with him.
  Keep out of his way, and above all let him know nothing of your connection
  with myself. This, I beg you to believe, is no idle warning, for all our
  lives depend upon it."</p><br>

  <p>Having thoroughly mastered the contents of this curious epistle, I turned
  my attention to the parcel which accompanied it. This I discovered was made
  up of a number of small packets evidently containing powders, and two-ounce
  phials of some tasteless and scentless liquid, to which I was quite unable to
  assign a name.</p>

  <p>Once more I glanced at the letter, in order to make sure of the name of
  the man whose guardian I was destined for the future to be. De Moreno was the
  name, and it was his granddaughter who was accompanying him. In an idle,
  dreamy way, I wondered what the latter would prove to be like. For some
  reason or another I found myself thinking a good deal of her, and when I fell
  asleep that night it was to dream that she was standing before me with
  outstretched hands, imploring me to save her not only from a certain
  one-eared Chinaman, but also from Nikola himself.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE MYSTERIOUS CHINAMAN</h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER my meeting with Nikola at Kelleran's house, it was a
  new prospect that life opened up for me. I confronted the future with a
  smiling face, and no longer told myself, as I had done so often of late, that
  Failure and I were inseparable companions, and for any success I might hope
  to achieve in the world I had better be out of it. On the contrary, when I
  retired to rest after the receipt of Nikola's letter, as narrated in the
  preceding chapter, it was with a happier heart than I had known for more than
  two years past, and a fixed determination that, happen what might, even if
  his wonderful experiment came to naught, my new employer should not find me
  lacking in desire to serve him. As for that experiment itself, I scarcely
  knew what to think of it. To a man who had studied the human frame, its
  wonderful mechanism combined with its many deficiences and limitations, it
  seemed impossible it could succeed. And yet, strange as it may appear to say
  so, there was something about Nikola that made one feel sure he would not
  embark upon such an undertaking if he were not quite certain, or at least had
  not a well-grounded hope, of being able to bring it to a favourable issue.
  However, successful or unsuccessful, the fact remained that I was to be
  associated with him, and the very thought of such co-operation was sufficient
  to send the blood tingling through my veins with new life and strength.</p>

  <p>During the two days that elapsed between my meeting with Nikola and the
  arrival of the vessel for which he had told me to be on the look-out, I saw
  nothing of Kelleran. I was not idle, however. In the first place it was
  necessary for me to replenish my wardrobe, which, as I have already observed,
  stood in need of considerable additions, and in the second I was anxious to
  consult some books of reference to which Nikola had directed my attention. By
  the time I had done these things, I had not, as may be supposed, very much
  leisure left, either for paying visits or for receiving them. I was careful,
  however, to write thanking him for the good turn he had done me, and wishing
  him good-bye in case I did not see him before I left.</p>

  <p>It was between eight and nine o'clock on the Monday morning following that
  I received a note from the Steamship Company, to which Nikola had referred,
  advising me that their vessel the <i>Dona Mercedes</i> had arrived from Cadiz
  and was now lying in the river, and would sail for the North at eleven
  o'clock precisely. Accordingly I gathered my luggage together, what there was
  of it, and made my way down to her. As Nikola had predicted, I found her
  lying in the Pool.</p>

  <p>On boarding her I was confronted by a big, burly man with a long brown
  beard, which blew over either shoulder and met behind his head as if it were
  some new kind of comforter. I inquired for the skipper.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"
     name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

    <img src="0200611h-images/DrNikolasExperiment-05.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">I inquired for the skipper.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"I am the captain," he answered. "And I suppose you are Dr. Ingleby. I had
  a letter from the owners saying you were going North with us. You may be sure
  we'll do our best to make you comfortable. In the meantime the steward will
  show you your berth and look after your luggage."</p>

  <p>As he said this he beckoned a hand aft and sent him below in search of the
  official in question.</p>

  <p>"I think you have a lady and gentleman on board who are expecting me?" I
  remarked, after the momentary pause which followed the man's departure.</p>

  <p>"That I have, sir," he answered with emphasis; "and a nice responsibility
  they've been for me. I wouldn't undertake another like it if I were paid a
  hundred pounds extra for my trouble. But perhaps you know the old
  gentleman?"</p>

  <p>"I have never seen him in my life," I replied, "but I have to take charge
  of him until we get to the North."</p>

  <p>"Then I wish you joy of your work," he continued. "You'll have your time
  pretty fully occupied, I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" I inquired. "I shall consider it a favour if you will tell
  me all you can about him. Is the old gentleman eccentric, or what is the
  matter with him?"</p>

  <p>"Eccentric?" replied the skipper, rolling his tongue round the word as if
  he liked its flavour, "Well, he may be that for all I know, but it's not his
  eccentricity that gives the trouble. It's his age! Why, I'll be bound he's a
  hundred, if he's a day. He's not a man at all, only a bag of bones; can't
  move out of his berth, can't walk, can't talk, and can't do a single hand's
  turn to help himself. His bones are almost through his skin, his eyes are
  sunk so far into his head that you can only guess what they're like, and when
  he wants a meal, or when he's got to have one, I should say, for he's past
  <i>wanting</i> anything, why, I'm blest if he hasn't to be fed with pap like
  a baby. It's a pitiful sort of a plight for a man to come to. What do you
  think? He'd far better be dead and buried."</p>

  <p>I thought I understood. Putting one thing and another together, the reason
  of the old man's journey North could easily be guessed. At that moment the
  seaman, whom the skipper had sent in search of the steward, made his
  appearance from the companion, followed by the functionary in question. To
  the latter's charge I was consigned, and at his suggestion I followed him to
  the cabin which had been set aside for my accommodation. It proved to be
  situated at the after end of the saloon, and was as small and poorly
  furnished a place as I have ever slept in. To make use of the old nautical
  expression, there was scarcely room in it to swing a cat. Tiny as it was,
  however, it was at least better than the back street lodgings I had so lately
  left; and when I reflected that I had paid all I owed, had fitted myself out
  with a new wardrobe, and was still upwards of fifty pounds in pocket, to say
  nothing of being engaged on deeply interesting work, I could have gone down
  on my knees and kissed the grimy planks in thankfulness.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid, sir, it's not as large as some you've been accustomed to,"
  said the talkative steward apologetically, as he stowed my bags away in a
  corner.</p>

  <p>"How do you know what I've been accustomed to?" I asked, with a smile, as
  I noticed his desire for conversation.</p>

  <p>"I could tell it directly I saw you look round this berth," he answered.
  "People can say what they please, but to my thinking there's no mistaking a
  man who's spent any time aboard ship. What line might you have been in,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>I told him, and had the good fortune to discover that he possessed a
  brother who had served the same employ. Having thus established a bond in
  common, I proceeded to question him about my future charges; only to find
  that this was a subject upon which he was very willing to enlarge.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," he began, seating himself familiarly on the edge of my berth
  and looking up at me, "I don't know as how I ought to speak about the old
  gentleman at all, seeing he's a passenger and you're, so to speak, in charge
  of him; but this I do say without fear or favour, that who ever brought him
  away from his home and took him to sea at his time of life did a wrong and
  cruel action. Why, sir, I make so bold as to tell you that from the moment he
  was brought aboard this ship until this very second, he has not spoke as much
  as five words to me or to anybody else. He just lays there in his bunk, hour
  after hour, with his eyes open, looking at the deck above him, and as likely
  as not holding his great-granddaughter's hand, not seeming to see or hear
  anything, and never letting one single word pass his lips. I've known what it
  is to wait upon sick folk myself, having spent close upon eight months in a
  hospital ashore, but never in my life, sir, and I give you my word it's
  gospel truth I'm telling you, have I seen anything like the way that young
  girl waits upon him. You'll find her a-sitting by him after breakfast, and if
  you go in at eight bells she'll be still the same. She has her meals brought
  to her and eats 'em there, and at night she gets me to make her up a bed on
  the deck alongside of him."</p>

  <p>"She must indeed be devoted," I answered, considerably touched at the
  picture he drew.</p>

  <p>"Devoted is no name for it," replied the man with conviction. "And it's by
  no means pleasant work for her, sir, I can assure you. Why, more than once
  when I've gone in there I've found her leaning over the bunk, her face just
  as white as the sheet there, holding a little looking-glass to his lips to
  see if he was breathing. Then she'd heave a big sigh of relief to find that
  there was still life in him, put the glass back in its place, and sit down
  beside him again, and go on holding his hand, for all the world as if she was
  determined to cling on to him until the Judgment Day. It would bring the
  tears into your eyes, I'm sure, sir, to see it."</p>

  <p>"You have a tender heart, I can see," I said, "and I think the better of
  you for it. Do you happen to know anything of their history&mdash;where they
  hail from or who they are?"</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I <i>do</i> know," he answered, "and that is that
  they're English and not Spaniards, as the cook said, and as you might very
  well think yourself from the name. I believe the old gentleman was a merchant
  of some sort in Cadiz, but that must have been fifty years ago. The young
  lady is his great-granddaughter, and I was given to understand that her
  father and mother have been dead for many years. From one thing and another I
  don't fancy they've got a penny to bless themselves with, but it's plain
  there's somebody paying the piper, because the skipper got orders from the
  office, just before we sailed, that everything that could be done for their
  comfort was to be done, and money was to be no object. But there, here I am
  running on in this way to you, sir, who probably know all about them better
  than I do."</p>

  <p>"I assure you I know nothing at all, or at least very little," I answered.
  "I have simply received instructions to meet them here, and to look after the
  old gentleman until he reaches Newcastle. What will become of them then I can
  only guess. I presume, however, I may rely on you for assistance during the
  voyage, should I require it?"</p>

  <p>"I'll do anything I can, sir, and you may be very sure of that," he
  replied. "I've taken such a liking to that young lady that there's nothing I
  wouldn't do in reason to make her feel a bit happier. For it's my belief
  she's far from easy in her mind just now. I remember once hearing an Orient
  steward tell of a man what was tied up with a sword hanging over his head by
  a single hair; he never knew from one minute to another when it would fall
  and do for him. Well, that's the way, I fancy, Miss Moreno is feeling.
  There's a sword hanging over her head or her great-grandfather's, and she
  doesn't know when it'll drop."</p>

  <p>"What did you say her name was?" I inquired, for I had for the moment
  forgotten it.</p>

  <p>"Moreno, sir," he replied. "The old gentleman is Don Miguel, and she is
  the Dona Consuelo de Moreno."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," I said. "And now, if you will tell me where their cabin is, I
  think I will pay the old gentleman a visit."</p>

  <p>"Their cabin is the one facing yours, sir, on the starboard side. If it
  will be any convenience to you, sir, I'll tell the young lady you're aboard.
  I know she expects you, because she said so only this morning."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would be better that you should tell her," I replied. "If you
  will give her my compliments and say that I will do myself the pleasure of
  waiting upon her as soon as it is convenient for her to see me, I shall be
  obliged. I will remain here until I receive her answer."</p>

  <p>The man departed on his errand, and during his absence I spent the time
  making myself as comfortable as my limited quarters would permit. It was not
  very long, however, before he returned to inform me that the young lady would
  be pleased to see me as soon as I cared to visit their cabin.</p>

  <p>Placing my stethoscope in my pocket, and having thrown a hasty glance into
  the small looking-glass over the washstand, in order to make sure that I
  presented a fairly respectable appearance, I left my quarters and made my way
  across the saloon. Since then I have often tried to recall my feelings at
  that moment, but the effort has always been in vain. One thing is certain, I
  had no idea of the importance the incident was destined to occupy in the
  history of my life.</p>

  <p>I knocked upon the door, and as I did so heard some one rise from a chair
  inside the cabin. The handle was softly turned, and a moment later the most
  beautiful girl I have ever seen in my life stood before me. I have said "the
  most beautiful girl," but this does not at all express what I mean, nor do I
  think it is in my power to do so. Let me, however, endeavour to give you some
  idea of what Dona Consuelo de Moreno was like.</p>

  <p>Try to picture a tall and stately girl, in reality scarcely twenty years
  of age, but looking several years older. Imagine a pale, oval face, lighted
  by dark lustrous eyes with long lashes and delicately pencilled brows, a tiny
  mouth, and hair as black as the raven's wing. Taken altogether, it was not
  only a very beautiful face, but a strong one, and as I looked at her I
  wondered what the circumstances could have been that had brought her into the
  power of my extraordinary employer. That she was in his power I did not for a
  moment doubt.</p>

  <p>Closing the cabin door softly behind her, she stepped into the saloon.</p>

  <p>"The steward tells me that you are Dr. Ingleby," she began, speaking
  excellent English, but with a slight foreign accent. Then, holding out her
  tiny hand to me with charming frankness, she continued: "I was informed by
  Dr. Nikola, in a letter I received this morning, that you would join the
  vessel here. It is a great relief to me to know you are on board."</p>

  <p>I said something, I forget what, in answer to the compliment she paid me,
  and then inquired how her aged relative was.</p>

  <p>"He seems fairly well at present," she answered. "As well, perhaps, as he
  will ever be. But, as you may suppose, he has given me a great deal of
  anxiety since we left Cadiz. This vessel is not a good sea boat, and in the
  Bay of Biscay we had some very rough weather&mdash;so rough, indeed, that
  more than once I thought she must inevitably founder. However, we are safely
  here now, so that our troubles are nearly over. I don't want you to think I
  am a grumbler. But I am keeping you here when perhaps you would like to see
  grandpapa for yourself?"</p>

  <p>I answered in the affirmative, whereupon she softly opened the door again,
  and, beckoning me to follow, led the way into the cabin.</p>

  <p>If my own quarters on the other side of the saloon had seemed small, this
  one seemed even smaller. There was only one bunk, and it ran below the
  port-hole. In this an old man was lying with his hands clasped upon his
  breast.</p>

  <p>"You need not fear that you will wake him," said the girl beside me. "He
  sleeps like this the greater part of the day. Sometimes he frightens me, for
  he lies so still that I become afraid lest he may have passed away without my
  noticing it."</p>

  <p>I did not at all wonder at her words. The old man's pallor was of that
  peculiar ivory-white which is never seen save in the very old, and then,
  strangely enough, in men oftener than women. His eyes were deeply sunken, as
  were his cheeks. At one time&mdash;forty years or so before&mdash;it must
  have been a powerful face; now it was beautiful only in its soft, harmonious
  whiteness. A long beard, white as the purest snow, fell upon, and covered his
  breast, and on it lay his fleshless hands, with their bony joints and long
  yellow nails. The better to examine him, I knelt down beside the bunk and
  took his right wrist between my finger and thumb. As I expected, the pulse
  was barely perceptible. For a moment I inclined to the belief that the end,
  of which his great-granddaughter had spoken only a few moments before, had
  come, but a second examination proved that such was not the case. I gently
  replaced his hand, and then rose to my feet.</p>

  <p>"I can easily understand your anxiety," I said. "I think you are
  wonderfully brave to have undertaken such a voyage. However, for the
  future&mdash;that is to say, until we reach Newcastle&mdash;you must let me
  share your watch with you."</p>

  <p>"It is very kind of you to offer to do so," she replied, "but I could not
  remain away from him. I have had charge of him for such a long time now that
  it has become like second nature to me. Besides, if he were to wake and not
  find me by his side, there is no saying what might happen. I am everything to
  him, and I know so well what he requires."</p>

  <p>As she said this, she gave me a look that I could not help thinking was
  almost one of defiance, as if she were afraid that by attending to the old
  man's wants I might deprive her of his affection. I accordingly postponed
  consideration of the matter for the moment, and, having asked a few questions
  as to the patient's diet, retired, leaving them once more alone together.
  From the saloon I made my way up to the poop. The tide was serving, and
  preparations were being made for getting under way.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later our anchor was at the cathead, and we were steaming
  slowly down the river, and I had begun one of the most extraordinary voyages
  it has ever fallen to the lot of man to undertake. During the afternoon I
  paid several visits to my patient's cabin; but on no occasion could I
  discover any change in his condition. He lay in his bunk just as I had first
  seen him; his sunken eyes stared at the woodwork above his head, and his left
  hand clasped that of his great-granddaughter.</p>

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">He lay in his bunk just as I had first seen him.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>To my surprise, the motion of the vessel seemed to cause him little or no
  inconvenience, and, fortunately for him, his nurse was an excellent sailor.
  It was in vain I tried to induce her to let me take her place while she went
  up to the deck for a little change. Her grandfather might want her, she said,
  and that excuse seemed to her sufficient to justify such trifling with her
  health. Later on, however, after dinner, I was fortunate enough to be able to
  induce her to accompany me to the deck for a few moments, the steward being
  left in charge of the patient, with instructions to call us should the least
  change occur. By this time we were clear of the river, and our bows were
  pointed in a northerly direction. Leaving the miserable companion, which
  ascended to the poop directly from the cuddy, we began to pace the deck. The
  night was cold, and, with a little shiver, my companion drew her coquettish
  mantilla more closely about her shoulders. There was something in her action
  which touched me in a manner I cannot describe. In some vague fashion it
  seemed to appeal to me not only for sympathy but for help. I saw the
  beautiful face looking up at me, and as we walked I noted the proud way in
  which she carried herself, and the sailor-like fashion in which she adapted
  herself to the rolling of the ship. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and
  had the vessel remained upon an even keel, it would have been very pleasant
  on deck. To be steady, however, was a feat the crazy old tub seemed incapable
  of accomplishing.</p>

  <p>We had paced the poop perhaps half a dozen times when my companion
  suddenly stopped, and placing her hand upon my arm, said:</p>

  <p>"Dr. Ingleby, you are in Dr. Nikola's confidence, I believe. Will you tell
  me why we are going to the North of England?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"
     name="pic7"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0200611h-images/DrNikolasExperiment-07.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">"Dr. Ingleby, you are in Dr. Nikola's confidence, I
    believe."</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Her question placed me in an awkward predicament. As I have said above,
  her loneliness, not to mention the devotion she showed to her aged relative,
  had touched me more than a little. On the other hand, I was Nikola's servant,
  employed by him for a special work, and I did not know whether he would wish
  me to discuss his plans with her.</p>

  <p>"You do not answer," she continued, as she noticed my hesitation. "And yet
  I feel sure you must know. It all seems so strange. Only a few weeks ago we
  were in our own quiet home in Spain, without a thought of leaving it. Then
  Dr. Nikola came upon the scene, and now we are on board this ship going up to
  the North of England: and for what purpose?"</p>

  <p>"Did Nikola furnish you with no reason?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," she replied. "He told me that if I would bring my grandfather to
  England to see him he would make him quite a strong man again. For some
  reason or another, however, I feel certain there is something behind it that
  is being kept from me. Is this so?"</p>

  <p>"I am not in a position to give you any answer that would be at all likely
  to satisfy you," I replied, I am afraid, a little ambiguously, "for I really
  know nothing. It is only fair I should tell you that I only met Dr. Nikola,
  myself, for the first time a few days ago."</p>

  <p>"But he sent you here to be with my grandfather," she continued
  authoritatively. "Surely, Dr. Ingleby, you must be able to throw some light
  upon the mystery which surrounds this voyage?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head, and with a little sigh of regret she ceased to question
  me. A few minutes later she gave me a stately bow, and, bidding me goodnight,
  prepared to go below. Knowing that I had deceived her, and hoping to find
  some opportunity of putting myself right with her, I followed her down the
  companion-ladder and along the saloon to her cabin.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better see my patient before I retire to rest," I said, as
  we stood together at the door, holding on to the handrail and balancing
  ourselves against the rolling of the ship.</p>

  <p>She threw a quick glance at me, as if for some reason she were surprised
  at my decision; the expression, however, passed from her face as quickly as
  it had come, and opening the door she entered the cabin, and I followed her.
  She could scarcely have advanced a step towards the bunk before she uttered
  an exclamation of surprise and horror. The steward, who was supposed to have
  been watching the invalid, was fast asleep, while the latter's head had
  slipped from its pillow and was now lying in a most unnatural position, his
  chin in the air, his eyes open, but still fixed upon the ceiling in the same
  glassy stare I have described before. In her dismay the girl said something
  in Spanish which I am unable to interpret, and leaning over the bunk, gazed
  into her great-grandfather's face as if she were afraid of what she might
  find there. The steward meanwhile had recovered his senses, and was staring
  stupidly from one to the other of us, hardly able to realise the consequences
  of his inattention. Though all this has taken some time to describe it was in
  reality the action of a moment; then signing to the steward to stand back,
  and gently pushing the young girl to one side, I knelt down and commenced my
  examination of my patient. There could be no doubt about one thing, the old
  man's condition was eminently serious. If he lived at all, there was but
  little more than a flicker of life left in him. How to preserve that flicker
  was a question that at first glance appeared impossible to answer. It would
  have been better, and certainly kinder, to have let him go in peace. This,
  however, I was in honour bound not to do. He was Nikola's property, whose
  servant I also was, and if it were possible to keep him alive I knew I must
  do it.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dr. Ingleby, surely he cannot be dead?" cried the girl behind me, in
  a voice that had grown hoarse with fear. "Tell me the worst, I implore
  you."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" I answered, but without looking round. "You must be brave. He is
  not dead. Nor will he die if I can save him."</p>

  <p>Then turning to the steward, who was still with us, I bade him hasten to
  my cabin and bring me the small bag he would find hanging upon the peg behind
  the door. When he returned with it I took from it one of the small bottles it
  contained, the contents of which I had been directed by Nikola to use only in
  the event of the case seeming absolutely hopeless. The mixture was tasteless,
  odourless, and quite colourless, and of a liquidity equal to water. I poured
  the stipulated quantity into a spoon and forced it between the old man's
  lips. Somewhat to my surprise&mdash;for I must confess, after what I had seen
  of Nikola's power a few nights before, I had expected an instantaneous
  cure&mdash;the effect was scarcely perceptible. The eyelids flickered a
  little, and then slowly closed; a few seconds later a respiratory movement of
  the thorax was just observable, accompanied by a heavy sigh. For upwards of
  an hour I remained in close attendance upon him, noting every symptom, and
  watching with amazement the return of life into that aged frame from which I
  had begun to think it had departed for good and all. Once more I measured the
  quantity of medicine and gave it to him. This time the effect was more
  marked. At the end of ten minutes a slight flush spread over the sunken
  cheeks, and his breathing could be plainly distinguished. When, after the
  third dose, he was sleeping peacefully as a little child, I turned to the
  girl and held out my hand.</p>

  <p>"He will recover," I said. "You need have no further fear. The crisis is
  past."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment, and I noticed that her eyes had filled with
  tears.</p>

  <p>"You have done <i>a</i> most wonderful thing," she answered, "and have
  punished me for my rudeness to you on deck. How can I ever thank you?"</p>

  <p>"By ceasing to give me credit to which I am not entitled," I replied, I
  fear a little brusquely. "This medicine comes from Dr. Nikola, and I think
  should be as good a proof as you can desire of the genuineness of his offer
  and of his ability to make your grandfather a strong and hearty man
  again."</p>

  <p>"I will not doubt him any more," she said: and after that, having made her
  promise to call me should she need my services, I bade her good' night and
  left the cabin, meaning to retire to rest at once. The stuffiness of my
  berth, however, changed my intention. After all that had transpired, it can
  scarcely be wondered at that I was in a state of feverish excitement. In love
  with my profession as I was, it will be readily understood that I had
  sufficient matter before me to afford plenty of food for reflection. I
  accordingly filled my pipe and made my way to the deck. Once there, I found
  that the appearance of the night had changed; the moonlight had given place
  to heavy clouds, and rain was falling. The steamer was still rolling heavily,
  and every timber groaned as if in protest against the barbarous handling to
  which it was being subjected. Stowing myself away in a sheltered place near
  the alley-way leading to the engine-room, I fell to considering my position.
  That it was a curious one, I do not think any one who has read the preceding
  pages will doubt. A more extraordinary could scarcely be imagined, and what
  the upshot of it all was to be was a thing I could not at all foresee.</p>

  <p>Having finished my pipe, I refilled it and continued my meditations. At a
  rough guess, I should say I had been an hour on deck when a circumstance
  occurred which was destined to furnish me with even more food for reflection
  than I already possessed. I was in the act of knocking the ashes out of my
  pipe before going below, when I became aware that something, I could not
  quite see what, was making its way along the deck in my direction under the
  shadow of the starboard bulwark. At first I felt inclined to believe that it
  was only a trick of my imagination, but when I rubbed my eyes and saw that it
  was a human figure, and that it was steadily approaching me, I drew back into
  the shadow and awaited developments. From the stealthy way in which he
  advanced, and the trouble he took to prevent himself being seen, I argued
  that, whoever the man was, and whatever his mission might be, it was not a
  very reputable one. Closer and closer he came, was lost to view for an
  instant behind the mainmast, and then reappeared scarcely a dozen feet from
  where I stood. For a moment I hardly knew what course to adopt. I had no
  desire to rouse the ship unnecessarily, and yet, for the reasons just stated,
  I felt morally certain that the man was there for no lawful purpose. However,
  if I was going to act at all, it was plain I must do so without loss of time.
  Fortune favoured me, for I had scarcely arrived at this decision before the
  chief engineer, whose cabin looked out over the deck, turned on his electric
  light. A broad beam of light shot out and showed me the man standing beside
  the main hatch steadfastly regarding me. Before he could move I was able to
  take full stock of him, and what I saw filled me with amazement. <i>The
  individual was a Chinaman, and his head presented this peculiarity, that half
  his left ear was missing.</i></p>

  <p>As I noted the significant fact to which I have just alluded, the
  recollection of Nikola's letter flashed across my mind, in which he had
  warned me to keep my eyes open for just such another man. Could this be the
  individual for whom I was to be on the look-out? It seemed extremely unlikely
  that there could be two Mongolians with the same peculiar deformity, and yet
  I could scarcely believe, even if it were the same and he had any knowledge
  of my connection with Nikola, that he would have the audacity to travel in
  the same ship with me. It must not be supposed, however, that I stayed to
  think these things out then. The light had no sooner flashed out upon him and
  revealed his sinister personality, than the switch was turned off and all was
  darkness once more. So blinding was the glare while it did last, however,
  that fully ten seconds must have elapsed before my eyes became accustomed to
  the darkness. When I could see, the man had vanished, and though I crossed
  the hatch and searched, not a sign of him could I discover.</p>

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">Could this be the individual of whom I had to
    beware?</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Whoever he is," I said to myself, "he has at least the faculty of being
  able to get out of the way pretty quickly. I wonder what . . . but there,
  what's the use of worrying myself about him? He's probably a fireman who has
  been sent aft on a message to the steward, and when I see him in the daylight
  I shall find him like anybody else."</p>

  <p>But while I tried to reassure myself in this fashion I was in reality far
  from being convinced. In my own mind I was as certain that he was the man
  against whom Nikola had warned me as I could well be of anything. The chief
  engineer at that moment stepped from his cabin into the alley-way. Here, I
  thought to myself, was an opportunity of settling the matter once and for
  all. I accordingly accosted him. I had been introduced to him earlier in the
  day by the captain, so that he knew who I was.</p>

  <p>"That is not a very pretty fireman of yours," I began, "that Chinaman with
  half an ear missing. I saw him a moment ago coming along the deck here. Where
  does he hail from?"</p>

  <p>The chief engineer, who, I may remark <i>en passant,</i> was an
  Aberdonian, and consequently slow of speech, hesitated for a moment before he
  replied.</p>

  <p>"That's mighty queer," he said at length. "Ye're the second mon who's seen
  him the night. D'ye tell me ye saw him this meenit? And if I may make so
  bold, where might that have been?"</p>

  <p>"Only a few paces from where we are standing now," I answered. "I was
  smoking my pipe in the shelter there, when suddenly I detected a figure
  creeping along in the shadow of the bulwarks. Then you turned on your
  electric, and the light fell full and fair upon his face. I saw him
  perfectly. There could be no doubt about it. He was a Chinaman, and half his
  left ear was missing."</p>

  <p>The chief engineer sucked at his pipe for upwards of half a minute.</p>

  <p>"Queer, queer," he said, more to himself than to me, "'tis vera queer.
  'Twas my second in yonder was saying he met him at eight bells in this
  alley-way. And yet I've been officially acquented there's no such person
  aboard the ship."</p>

  <p>"But there must be," I cried. "Don't I tell you I saw the man myself, not
  five minutes ago? I would be willing to go into a court of law and swear to
  the fact."</p>

  <p>"Dinna swear," he answered. "I'll nae misdoubt yer word."</p>

  <p>With this assurance I was conducted forthwith to the chart room, where we
  discovered the skipper stretched upon his settee, snoring voluminously.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me that you really saw the man?" he inquired, when my
  business had been explained to him.</p>

  <p>I assured him that I did mean it. I had seen him distinctly.</p>

  <p>"Well, all I can say is that it's the most extraordinary business I ever
  had to do with," he answered. "The second engineer also says he saw him.
  Directly he told me I had the ship searched, but not a trace of the fellow
  could I discover. We'll try again."</p>

  <p>Leaving the chart room, he called the bos'un to him, and, accompanied by
  the chief engineer and myself, commenced an exhaustive examination of the
  vessel. We explored the quarters of the crew and firemen forrard, the galley,
  stores, and officers' cabins in both alley-ways, and finally the saloon aft,
  but without success. Not a trace of the mysterious Mongolian could we find.
  The skipper shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to think about it," he said.</p>

  <p>I knew that meant that he had his doubts as to whether I had not dreamt
  the whole affair. The inference was galling, and when I bade him goodnight
  and went along to my cabin, I wished I had said nothing at all about the
  matter. Nevertheless, I was as firmly convinced that I had seen the man as I
  was at the beginning. In this frame of mind I prepared myself for bed. Before
  turning into my bunk, however, I took down the small bag in which I kept the
  drugs Nikola had given me and of which he had told me to take such care. I
  was anxious to have them close at hand in case I should be sent for by Dona
  Consuelo during the night. To assure myself that they had not been broken by
  the rolling of the ship I opened the bag and looked inside. My astonishment
  may be imagined on discovering that it was empty. <i>The drugs were
  gone.</i></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE CHINAMAN'S ESCAPE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE night on which I discovered that Nikola's drugs had been
  stolen was destined to prove unpleasant in more senses than one. The
  sweetest-tempered of men could scarcely have failed to take offence had they
  been treated as the captain had treated me. I had told him in so many words,
  and with as much emphasis as I was master of, that I had distinctly seen the
  Chinaman standing upon the main deck of his steamer. The second engineer had
  also entered the same report; his evidence, however, while serving to
  corroborate my assertion, was of little further use to me, inasmuch as I had
  still better proof that what I said was correct&mdash;namely, that the
  medicines were missing. Under the circumstances it was small wonder that I
  slept badly. Even had the cabin been as large as a hotel bedroom, and the
  bunk the latest invention in the way of comfortable couches, it is scarcely
  possible I should have had better rest. As it was, the knowledge that I had
  been outwitted was sufficient to keep me tumbling and tossing to and fro,
  from the moment I laid my head upon the pillow until the sun was streaming in
  through my porthole next morning. Again and again I went over the events of
  the previous day, recalling every incident with photographic distinctness;
  but always returning to the same point. How the man could have obtained
  admittance to the saloon at all was more than I could understand, and, having
  got there, why he should have stolen the bottles of medicine when there were
  so many other articles which would have seemed to be of infinitely more value
  to him, scattered about, was, to say the least of it, incomprehensible. Hour
  after hour I puzzled over it, and at the end was no nearer a solution of the
  enigma than at the beginning. At first I felt inclined to believe that I must
  have taken them from the bag myself and for security's sake have placed them
  elsewhere. A few moments' search, however, was sufficient to knock the bottom
  out of that theory. Hunt high and low, where I would, I could discover no
  traces of the queer little bottles. Then I remembered that when I had sent
  the steward for them to the Don's cabin the previous afternoon, I had taken
  them from the bag and placed them upon the deck beside the old man's bunk.
  Could I have left them there? On reconsidering the matter more carefully,
  however, I remembered that before leaving the cabin I had replaced them in my
  bag, and that as I carried them back to my berth I had bumped the satchel
  against the corner of the saloon table and was afraid I might have broken
  them. This effectually disposed of that theory also. At last the suspense of
  irritation, by whichever name you may describe it, became unbearable, and
  unable to remain in bed any longer, I rose, dressed myself, and prepared to
  go on deck. Entering the saloon, I found the steward busied over a number of
  coffee-cups.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, sir," he said, looking up from his work. "If you'll excuse
  my saying so, sir, you're about early."</p>

  <p>"I was late in bed," I answered, with peculiar significance. "How is it,
  my friend, that you allow people, who have no right here, to enter the saloon
  and to thieve from the passengers' cabins?"</p>

  <p>"To thieve, sir!" the man replied in a startled tone; "I'm sure I don't
  understand you, sir. I allow no one to enter the saloon who has no right to
  <i>be</i> there."</p>

  <p>I glanced at him sharply, wondering whether the fellow was as innocent as
  he pretended to be.</p>

  <p>"At any rate," I said, "the fact remains that some one entered my cabin
  last night, while I was on deck, and stole the medicines with which I am
  treating the old gentleman in the cabin yonder."</p>

  <p>The man looked inexpressibly shocked. "God bless my soul alive,
  sir&mdash;you don't mean that!" he said, with a falter in his voice. "Surely
  you don't mean it?"</p>

  <p>"But I <i>do</i> mean it," I answered. "There can be no sort of doubt
  about it. When I left the old gentleman's cabin yesterday I carried the bag
  containing the medicines back with me to my own berth, locked it, and hung it
  upon the peg beside the looking-glass with my own hands. After that I went on
  deck, returned to my cabin an hour or so later, opened the bag, and the
  bottles were gone."</p>

  <p>"But, sir, have you any idea who could have taken them?" the man replied.
  "I hope you don't think, sir, as how I should have allowed such a thing to
  take place in this saloon with my knowledge?"</p>

  <p>"I hope you would not," I answered, "but that does not alter the fact that
  the things are missing."</p>

  <p>"But don't you think, sir, the young lady herself might have come in
  search of you, and when she found you were not there did the next best thing
  and took away the medicines to use herself?"</p>

  <p>"At present I do not know what to think," I replied with some hesitation,
  for that view of the case had not presented itself to me. "But if there has
  been anything underhand going on, I think I can promise the culprit that it
  will be made exceedingly hot for him when we reach our destination."</p>

  <p>Having fired this parting shot, I left him to the contemplation of his
  coffee-cups and made my way up the companion-ladder to the deck above. It was
  a lovely morning, a brisk breeze was blowing, and the steamer was running
  fairly steady under a staysail and a foresail. It was not the sort of morning
  to feel depressed, and yet the incidents of the previous night were
  sufficient to render me more than a little uncomfortable. Nikola had trusted
  me, and in the matter of the medicines at least I had been found wanting. I
  believe at the moment I would have given all I possessed&mdash;which was
  certainly not much, but still a good deal to me&mdash;to have been able to
  solve the mystery that surrounded the disappearance of those drugs. Shortly
  before eight bells the skipper emerged from the chart room and came along the
  hurricane deck towards the poop. Seeing me he waved his hand, and, after he
  had ascended the ladder from the main deck, bade me good morning. "I'm afraid
  our accommodation is not very good," he said, "but I trust you have passed a
  fairly comfortable night. No more dreams of one-eared Chinamen, I hope?"</p>

  <p>From the tone in which he spoke it was plain that he imagined I must have
  been dreaming on the previous evening. Had it not been for the seriousness of
  my position with Nikola, I could have laughed aloud when I thought of the
  shell I was about to drop into the skipper's camp.</p>

  <p>"Dreams or no dreams, Captain Windover," I replied, "I have to make a very
  serious complaint to you. It will remain then for you to say whether you
  consider that the assertion I made to you last night was, or was not, founded
  upon fact. As I believe you are aware, I was instructed by my principal, Dr.
  Nikola, to join this vessel in the Thames and to take charge of Don Miguel de
  Moreno until his arrival in Newcastle-on-Tyne. Dr. Nikola was fully aware of
  the difficulty and responsibility of the task he had assigned to me, and for
  this reason he furnished me with a number of very rare drugs which I was to
  administer to the patient as occasion demanded. In the letter of instructions
  which I received prior to embarking, I was particularly warned to beware of a
  certain Chinaman whose peculiar characteristic was that he had lost half an
  ear. In due course I joined your vessel, and attended the Don, used the drugs
  to which I have referred, and afterwards returned them to my cabin. A quarter
  of an hour or so later I made my way to the deck, where I found myself
  suddenly brought face to face with the Asiatic of whom I had been warned. On
  the recommendation of the chief engineer I reported the matter to you; you
  searched the ship, found no one at all like the man I described, and from
  that time forward set down the story I had told you either as a fabrication
  on my part, or the creation of a dream."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, my dear sir, not a fabrication," the skipper began: "only
  a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me in your turn," I replied: "I have not quite finished. As I have
  inferred, you treat the matter with contempt. What <i>is</i> the result? I
  return to my cabin, and, before retiring to rest, in order to make sure that
  they are ready at hand in case I should require them during the night, open
  the bag in which the medicines until that moment had been stored. To my
  consternation they are not there. Some one had entered my cabin during my
  absence and stolen them. I leave you to put what construction on it you
  please, and to say what that some one was."</p>

  <p>The captain's face was a study. "But&mdash;but&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Buts will not mend the matter," I answered, I am afraid rather sharply.
  "There can be no getting away from the fact that they are gone, and that some
  one must have taken them. They could scarcely walk away by themselves."</p>

  <p>"But supposing your suspicions to be correct, what possible use could a
  few small bottles of unknown medicine be to a man like that, a Chinaman? Had
  he taken your watch and chain, or your money, I could understand it; but from
  what you say, I gather that nothing else is missing."</p>

  <p>"Nothing else," I replied, in the tone of a man who is making an admission
  that is scarcely likely to add to the weight of the argument he is
  endeavouring to adduce.</p>

  <p>"Besides," continued the skipper, "there are half a hundred other ways in
  which the things might have been lost or mislaid. Last night the ship was
  rolling heavily: why might they not have tumbled out and have slipped under
  your bunk or behind your bags? I have known things like that occur."</p>

  <p>"And would the ship have closed the bag again, may I ask?" I answered
  scornfully. "No, no! Captain, I am afraid that won't do. The man I reported
  to you last night, the one-eared Chinaman, is aboard your ship, and for some
  reason best known to himself he has stolen some of my property, thereby not
  only inconveniencing me but placing in absolute danger the life of the old
  man whom I was sent on board to take care of. As the thief is scarcely likely
  to have jumped overboard, he must be on board now; and as he would not be
  likely to have stolen the bottles only to smash them, it stands to reason
  that he must have them in his keeping at the present moment."</p>

  <p>"And suppose he has, what do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to find him for me," I answered, "or, if you don't care to
  take the trouble, to put sufficient men at my disposal and allow me to do
  so."</p>

  <p>On hearing this the captain became very red and shifted uneasily on his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," he said a little testily, "much as I would like to put
  myself out to serve you, I must confess that what you ask seems a little
  unreasonable. Don't I tell you I have already searched the ship twice in an
  attempt to find this man, and each time without success? Upon my word I don't
  think it is fair to ask me to do so again."</p>

  <p>"In that case I am very much afraid I have no alternative but to make a
  complaint to you in writing and to hold you responsible, should Don Miguel de
  Moreno lose his life through this robbery which has been committed, and which
  you will not help me to set right."</p>

  <p>What the captain would have answered in reply to this I cannot say; it is
  quite certain, however, that it would have been something sharp had not the
  Dofia Consuelo made her appearance from the companion hatch that moment. She
  struck me as looking very pale, as if she had passed a bad night. The skipper
  and I went forward together to meet her.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," I said, as I took the little hand she held out to me. "I
  hope your great-grandfather is better this morning?"</p>

  <p>"He has passed a fairly good-night, and is sleeping quietly at present,"
  she answered. "The steward is sitting with him now while I come up for a few
  moments to get a little fresh air on deck."</p>

  <p>The skipper made some remark about the beauty of the morning, and while he
  was speaking I watched the girl's face. There was an expression upon it I did
  not quite understand.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you have not passed a very good-night," I said, after the
  other had finished. "Yesterday's anxiety must have upset you more than you
  allowed me to suppose."</p>

  <p>"I will confess that it did upset me," she answered, with her pretty
  foreign accent and the expressive gesticulation which was so becoming to her.
  "I have had a wretched night. I had such a terrible dream that I have
  scarcely recovered from it yet."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear that," the skipper and I answered almost together,
  while I added, "Pray tell us about it."</p>

  <p>"It does not seem very much to tell," she answered, "and yet the effect it
  produced upon me is just as vivid now as it was then. After you left the
  cabin last night, Dr. Ingleby, I sat for a little while by my grandfather's
  side, trying to read; but finding that impossible, I retired to rest, lying
  upon the bed the steward is kind enough to make up for me upon the floor. I
  was utterly worn out, and almost as soon as I closed my eyes I fell asleep.
  How long I had been sleeping I cannot say, but suddenly I felt there was some
  one in the room who was watching me: who it was I could not tell, but that it
  was some one, or something, utterly repulsive to me I felt certain. In vain I
  endeavoured to open my eyes, but, as in most nightmares, I found it
  impossible to do so; and all the time I could feel this loathsome thing,
  whatever it was, drawing closer and closer to me. Then, putting forth a great
  effort, I managed to wake, or perhaps to dream that I did so. I had much
  better have kept my eyes closed, for leaning over me was the most horrible
  face I have ever seen or imagined. It was flatter than that of a European,
  with small, narrow eyes, and such cruel eyes."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" I cried, unable to keep silence any longer, "can it be
  possible that you saw him too?"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the skipper, who had been leaning against the bulwarks, his
  hands thrust deep in his pockets and his cap upon the back of his head,
  suddenly sprang to attention.</p>

  <p>"Can you remember anything else about the man?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>The girl considered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I do not know that I can," she answered. "I can only repeat what I said
  before, that it was the most awful face I have ever seen in my
  life.&mdash;Stay, there is one other thing that I remember. I noticed that
  half his left ear was missing."</p>

  <p>"It is the Chinaman!" I cried, with an air of triumph that I could no
  longer suppress. And as I said it I took from my pocket the letter of
  instruction Nikola had sent me the week before, and read aloud the passage in
  which he referred to the one-eared Chinaman of whom I was to beware. The
  effect was exactly what I imagined it would be.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me I was not dreaming after all?" the Dona inquired,
  with a frightened expression on her face.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I <i>do</i> mean," I answered. "And I am glad to
  have your evidence that you saw the man, for the reason that it bears out
  what I have been saying to our friend the captain here."</p>

  <p>Then turning to that individual, I continued: "I hope, sir, you will now
  see the advisability of instituting another search for this man. If I were in
  your place I would turn the ship inside out, from truck to keelson. It seems
  to me outrageous that a rascal like this can hide himself on board, and you,
  the captain, be ignorant of his whereabouts."</p>

  <p>"There is no necessity to instruct me in my duty," he answered stiffly,
  and then going to the companion called down it for the steward, who presently
  made his appearance on deck.</p>

  <p>"Williams," said the skipper, "Dr. Ingleby informs me that a theft was
  committed in his cabin last night. He declares that a man made his way into
  the saloon, visiting not only his berth, but that of Don Miguel de Moreno.
  How do you account for this?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Ingleby <i>did</i> say something to me about it this morning, sir,"
  the steward replied: "but to tell you the plain truth, sir, I don't know what
  to think of it. It's the first time I've ever known such a thing happen. Of
  course I shouldn't like to say as how Dr. Ingleby was mistaken."</p>

  <p>"You had better not," I replied, so sharply that the man jumped with
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, sir," the steward continued, "I feel certain that if the man
  <i>had</i> come aft I should have heard him. I am a light sleeper, as the
  saying is, and I believe that a cat coming down the companion-ladder would be
  enough to wake me, much less a man."</p>

  <p>"On this occasion you must have slept sounder than usual," I said. "At any
  rate the fact remains that the man did come; and I have to ask you once more,
  Captain, what you intend to do to find my stolen property?"</p>

  <p>"I must take time to consider the matter," the captain replied. "If the
  man is aboard the ship, as you assert, I will find him, and if I do find him
  he had better look out for squalls&mdash;that's all I can say."</p>

  <p>"And at the same time," I added, "I hope you will severely punish any
  member of your crew who may have been instrumental in secreting him on
  board."</p>

  <p>As I said this I glanced at the steward, and it seemed to me his always
  sallow face became even paler than usual.</p>

  <p>"You need not bother yourself about that," said the skipper: "you may be
  sure I shall do so."</p>

  <p>Then, lifting his cap to the Dona Consuelo, he went forward along the
  deck; while the steward, having informed us that breakfast was upon the
  table, returned to the companion-ladder and disappeared below.</p>

  <p>"What does all this mystery mean, Dr. Ingleby?" inquired my companion, as
  we turned and walked aft together.</p>

  <p>"It means that there is more at the back of it than meets the eye," I
  replied. "Before I left London I was warned by Dr. Nikola, as you heard me
  say just now, to beware of a certain Asiatic with only half an ear. What
  Nikola feared he would do I have no notion, but there seems to be no doubt
  that this is the man."</p>

  <p>"But he has done us no harm," she replied, "beyond frightening me; so if
  the captain takes care that he does not come as far as the saloon again, it
  does not seem to me we need think any more about him."</p>

  <p>"But he <i>has</i> done us harm," I asserted&mdash;"grievous harm. He has
  stolen the medicine with which I treated your great-grandfather so
  successfully yesterday."</p>

  <p>On hearing this she gave a little start.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that if he should become ill again in the same way that he
  did yesterday, you would be unable to save him?" she inquired, almost
  breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"I cannot say anything about that," I answered. "I should of course do my
  best, but I must confess the loss of those drugs is a very serious matter for
  me. They are exceedingly valuable, and were specially entrusted to my
  care."</p>

  <p>"And you think that Dr. Nikola will be angry with you for having lost
  them?" she said.</p>

  <p>"I am very much afraid he will," I answered. "But if he is, I must put up
  with it. Now let us come below to breakfast." With that I led her along the
  deck and down the companion-ladder to the saloon.</p>

  <p>"Before we sit down to our meal I think it would perhaps be as well if I
  saw your great-grandfather," I said. "I should like to convince myself that
  he is none the worse for his attack yesterday."</p>

  <p>Upon this we entered the cabin together, and I bent over the recumbent
  figure of the old man. He lay just as he had done on the previous day; his
  long thin hands were clasped upon his breast, and his eyes looked upward just
  as I remembered seeing them. For all the difference that was to be seen, he
  might never have moved since I had left him so many hours before.</p>

  <p>"He is awake," whispered his great-granddaughter, who had looked at him
  over my shoulder. Then, raising her voice a little, she continued, still in
  English, "This is Dr. Ingleby, grandfather, whom your friend Dr. Nikola has
  sent to take care of you."</p>

  <p>"I thank you, sir, for your kindness," replied the old man, in a voice
  that was little louder than a whisper. "You must forgive me if my reception
  of you appears somewhat discourteous, but I am very feeble. A month ago I
  celebrated my ninety-eighth birthday, and at such an age, I venture to
  assert, much may be forgiven a man."</p>

  <p>"Pray do not apologise," I replied. "I am indeed glad to find you looking
  so much better this morning."</p>

  <p>"If to be still alive is to be better, then I suppose I must be," he
  answered, in a tone that was almost one of regret; and then continued, "The
  days of our age are threescore years and ten; and though men be so strong
  that they come to fourscore years, yet is their strength but labour and
  sorrow; labour and sorrow&mdash;aye, labour and sorrow."</p>

  <p>"Come, come, sir," I said, "you must not talk like this. You are not very
  comfortable here, but we are nearly at our journey's end. Once there, you
  will be able to rest more quietly and in greater comfort than it is possible
  for you to do in this tiny cabin."</p>

  <p>"You speak well," he answered, "when you say that I am nearly at my
  journey's end. God knows I am near it&mdash;very, very near it. The wonder is
  I have not reached it long since. But it will come at last, and when it comes
  I shall rest, as you say, more quietly than in this tiny cabin."</p>

  <p>Seeing that in his present humour there was not much to be done with him,
  I completed my examination, gave certain instructions to his
  great-granddaughter, and then left the cabin, feeling very much as if I had
  stepped into the nineteenth out of another and quite different century.
  Breakfast was laid in the saloon; and as the steward informed me that the
  skipper invariably had his sent forward to the chart room, while the Dona
  Consuelo usually partook of hers by the old gentleman's bedside, I sat down
  to it alone. The steward waited upon me, a trifle nervously I thought, and
  with an obsequiousness that told me he was anxious to make up to me for the
  robbery of the night before. Whatever he might think, however, I had not the
  smallest intention of allowing myself to be drawn into a discussion with him
  on the subject. The matter would have to be settled some way or another when
  we reached our destination, and then, in all probability, Nikola would look
  after it for himself.</p>

  <p>Whatever else may be said of the good ship Dona Mercedes, her warmest
  admirers could scarcely assert that she possessed a wonderful turn of speed.
  Even with everything in her favour it was as much as the chief engineer could
  do to knock nine knots out of her, but on the present occasion seven was
  somewhere nearer her mark. For this reason, instead of reaching our
  destination at midday, as I had hoped we should do, night had closed in on us
  before we had crossed the bar and could count ourselves safely in the river,
  while five bells in the first watch had been sounded before we lay at anchor
  in the Tyneside.</p>

  <p>As soon as I heard the cable rattling out through the hawse hole I made my
  way to the deck. The night was a dark one, but a more interesting picture
  than I had before me then could scarcely be imagined. Around me on every side
  were ships: colliers, tramps, passenger-vessels and merchantmen of every
  possible sort and description. The lights of the city could be plainly
  distinguished, and innumerable tongues of fire containing all the colours of
  the rainbow flashed up continually from factory chimneys. A couple of
  steam-launches were lying alongside, with at least a dozen small boats; and
  thinking Nikola might be in one of them, I went forward to the gangway in
  search of him, but though I scanned the faces below me, his was not among
  them. For the reason that we were so late getting into the river, and knowing
  that the vessel would be likely to remain for some time to come, I argued
  that in all probability he had put off boarding her until the morning. I
  accordingly turned away, and was about to walk aft when a hand was placed on
  my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Well, friend Ingleby," said a voice that there was no mistaking, and
  which I should have known anywhere, "what sort of a voyage have you had, and
  how is your patient progressing?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Nikola!" I cried in astonishment, as I turned and found him standing
  before me. "I was just looking for you in the boats alongside. I had no idea
  you were on board."</p>

  <p>"I came up by the other gangway," Nikola replied. "But you have not
  answered my question. How is your patient?"</p>

  <p>"He is still alive," I answered, "and I fancy, if possible, a little
  better than when we left London. But he is so feeble that to speak of his
  being well seems almost a sarcasm. Yesterday for a few moments I thought he
  was gone, but with the help of the drugs you gave me I managed to bring him
  round again. This morning he was strong enough to converse with me."</p>

  <p>"I am pleased to hear it," he replied. "You have done admirably, and I
  congratulate you. Now we must think about their trans-shipment."</p>

  <p>"Trans-shipment?" I replied. "Is it possible they have to make another
  journey?"</p>

  <p>"It is more than possible&mdash;it is quite certain," he answered.
  "Allerdeyne Castle is a matter of some fifty miles up the coast, and a steam
  yacht will take us there. A bed has been prepared for the old gentleman in
  the saloon, and all we have to do is to get him off this boat and on board
  her. You had better let me have those drugs and I'll mix him up a slight
  stimulus. He'll need it."</p>

  <p>This was the question I had been dreading all along, but the die was cast
  and willy nilly the position had to be faced.</p>

  <p>"I should like to speak to you upon that matter," I said. "I very much
  fear that you will consider me to blame for not having exercised greater care
  over them, but I had no idea they would be of any value to any one who did
  not know the use of them."</p>

  <p>"Pray what do you mean?" he asked, with a look of astonishment that I
  believe was more than half assumed. "To what are you alluding? Have you had
  an accident with the drugs?"</p>

  <p>While we had been talking we had walked along the main deck, and were
  approaching the entrance leading therefrom to the cuddy, the light from which
  fell upon his face. There was a look upon it that I did not like. When he was
  in an affable mood Nikola's countenance was singularly prepossessing: when,
  however, he was put out by anything it was the face of a devil rather than a
  man.</p>

  <p>"I exceedingly regret having to inform you that last night the drugs in
  question were stolen from my cabin."</p>

  <p>In a moment he was all excitement.</p>

  <p>"By the man of whom I bade you beware, of course&mdash;the one-eared
  Chinaman?"</p>

  <p>"The same," I answered; and went on to inform him of all that had
  transpired since my arrival on board, including my trouble with the captain
  and the suspicions I entertained, without much foundation I'm afraid, against
  the steward. He heard me out without speaking, and when I had finished bade
  me wait on deck while he went below to the Morenos' cabin. While he was gone
  I strolled to the side, and once more stood watching the lights reflected in
  the water below. On an old tramp steamer a short distance astern of us a man
  was singing. It was one of Chevalier's coster songs, and I could recognise
  the words quite distinctly. The last time I had heard that song was in Cape
  Coast Castle, just after I had recovered from my attack of fever; and I was
  still pursuing the train of thought it conjured up, when I noticed a boat
  drawing into the circle of light to which I have just alluded. It contained
  two men, one of whom was standing up while the other rowed. A second or two
  later they had come close enough for me to see the face of the man in the
  bows. To my amazement he was a Chinaman! So overwhelming was my astonishment
  that I uttered an involuntary cry, and, running to the skylight, called to
  Nikola to come on deck. Then, bounding to the bulwarks again, I looked for
  the boat. But I was too late. Either they had achieved their object, or my
  prompt action had given them a fright. At any rate, they were gone.</p>

    <p class="caption">To my amazement he was a Chinaman!</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"What do you want?" cried Nikola, who by this time had reached the
  deck.</p>

  <p>"The Chinamen!" I cried. "I saw one of them a moment ago in a boat
  alongside."</p>

  <p>"Where are they now?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"I cannot see them. They have disappeared into the darkness again; but
  when I called to you they were scarcely twenty yards away. What does their
  presence here signify, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"It signifies that they know that I am on board," answered Nikola, with a
  queer sort of smile upon his face. "It means also that, although this is the
  nineteenth century and the law-abiding land of England, if we were to venture
  a little out of the beaten track ashore to-night, you and I would stand a
  very fair chance of having our throats cut before morning. It has one other
  meaning, and that is that you and I must play the old game of the partridge
  and its nest, and lure them away from this boat while the skipper transfers
  Don Miguel and his great-granddaughter to the yacht I have in waiting down
  the river."</p>

  <p>"That is all very well," I interrupted, "but I am not at all sure the
  skipper would be willing. To put it bluntly, he and I have already had a few
  words together over this matter."</p>

  <p>"That will make no difference," Nikola answered. "I assure you you need
  have no fear that he will play us false: he knows me far too well to attempt
  that. I will confer with him at once, and while I am doing so you had better
  get your traps together. We will then go ashore and do our best to draw these
  rascals off the scent."</p>

  <p>So saying, Nikola made his way forward towards the chart room, while I
  went through the cuddy to my own berth. The steward carried my bags out on to
  the main deck, and, after I had spoken a word or two with Dona Consuelo, I
  followed him. Five minutes later Nikola joined me, accompanied by the
  captain. I had bidden the latter good-bye earlier in the evening, and Nikola
  was giving him one last word of advice, when I happened to glance towards the
  alley-way on the port side. Imagine my surprise&mdash;nay, I might almost say
  my consternation&mdash;on beholding, standing in the dark by the corner of
  the main hatch, the same mysterious Chinaman who I felt certain had committed
  the robbery of the drugs the previous night.</p>

  <p>"Look, look," I cried to my companions; "see, there is the man again!"</p>

  <p>They wheeled round and looked in the direction to which I pointed. At the
  same moment the man's right arm went up, and from where I stood I could see
  something glittering in the palm. An inspiration, how or by what occasioned I
  shall never be able to understand, induced me to seize Nikola by the arm and
  to swing him behind me. It was well that I did so, for almost before we could
  realise what was happening, a knife was thrown, and stood imbedded a good
  three inches in the bulwark, exactly behind where Nikola had been standing an
  instant before. Then, springing on to the ladder which leads from the main to
  the hurricane deck, he raced up it, jumped on to the rail, and dived headlong
  into the water alongside. By the time we reached the deck whence he had taken
  his departure, all we could see was a boat pulling swiftly in the direction
  of the shore.</p>

  <p>"That settles it, friend Ingleby," said Nikola.</p>

  <p>"We have no alternative now but to make our way ashore and do as I
  proposed. If you are ready, come along. I think I can safely promise you an
  adventure."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; ALLERDEYNE CASTLE</h2>

  <p class="first">When, nowadays, I look back upon the period I spent in
  Nikola's company, one significant fact always strikes me, and that is the
  enormous number of risks we managed to cram into such a comparatively short
  space of time. During my somewhat chequered career I have perhaps seen as
  much of what is vaguely termed life as most men: I have lived in countries
  the very reverse of civilised; I have served aboard ships where there has
  been a good deal more sandbagging and hazing than would be considered good
  for the average man's Christian temperament; and as for actual fighting,
  well, I have seen enough of that to have learnt one lesson&mdash;one which
  will probably cause a smile to rise on the face of the
  inexperienced&mdash;and that is to keep out of it as far as possible, and on
  all occasions to be afraid of firearms.</p>

  <p>I concluded my last chapter with an account of our arrival in Newcastle,
  and explained how we were preparing to go ashore, when the one-eared
  Chinaman, who I felt convinced had committed the robbery of the previous
  night, made his appearance before us and came within an ace of taking
  Nikola's life. Had it not been for my presence of mind, or instinct, by
  whichever term you please to call it, I verily believe it would have been the
  end of all things for the Doctor. As it was, however, the knife missed its
  mark, and a moment later the man had sprung up the ladder to the hurricane
  deck and leaped the rail and plunged into the river. Being desirous of
  preventing the Chinaman from following us and by that means becoming aware
  that we were leaving for the north in Nikola's yacht, we determined to make
  our way ashore and permit them to suppose that we were remaining in Newcastle
  for some length of time. Accordingly we descended into the wherry alongside,
  and ordered the boatman to pull us to the nearest landing-stage.</p>

  <p>"Keep your eyes open and your wits about you," whispered Nikola, when we
  had left the boat and were making our way up to the street. "They are certain
  to be on the look-out for us."</p>

  <p>As you may be sure, I did not neglect his warning. I had had one
  exhibition of that diabolical Celestial's skill in knife throwing, and when I
  reflected that in a big town like Newcastle there were many dark corners and
  alley-ways, and also that a knife makes but little or no noise when thrown, I
  was more determined than ever to neglect no opportunity of looking after my
  own safety. When we reached the street at the rear of the docks Nikola cast
  about him for a cab, but for some minutes not one was to be seen. At last a
  small boy obtained one for us, and when the luggage had been placed on the
  roof we took our seats in it. Nikola gave the driver his instructions, and in
  a short time we were bowling along in the direction of our hotel. Throughout
  the drive I could see no signs of the enemy. I was in the act of wondering
  how such a game as we were then playing could possibly help us if the
  Celestials had failed to see us come ashore, when Nikola turned to me, and in
  his usual quiet voice said:</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you have noticed that we are being followed?"</p>

  <p>I replied that I certainly had not, nor could I see how he could tell such
  a thing.</p>

  <p>"Very easily," he said: "I will prove that what I say is correct. Do you
  remember the small boy who went in search of a cab?"</p>

  <p>I answered that I did, whereupon he bade me examine our reflection as we
  passed the next shop window. I did so, and could plainly distinguish a small
  figure seated on the rail at the back. Save this atom, ourselves, and a
  solitary policeman, the street was deserted.</p>

  <p>"I <i>do</i> see a small boy," I answered; "but may he not be coming with
  us to try and obtain the job of carrying our luggage?"</p>

  <p>"He is engaged upon another now. When he came up from the river he was on
  the look-out for us, although, as you may have noticed, he pretended to be
  asleep in a doorway. He obtained the cab for us, and as you stepped into it
  he ranged up alongside and handed something to the driver. When we alight he
  will wait to see that our luggage is carried in, after which he will decamp
  and carry the information to his employers, who will endeavour to cut our
  throats as soon as the opportunity occurs."</p>

  <p>"You look at the matter in an eminently cheerful light," I said. "For my
  own part I have no desire to give them the chance just yet. Is there no way
  in which we can prevent such a possibility occurring?"</p>

  <p>"It is for that reason that we are here," Nikola replied. "I can assure
  you I am no more anxious to die than you are. There would be a good deal of
  irony in having perfected a scheme for prolonging life, only to meet one's
  death at the hand of a Chinese ruffian in a civilised English tower."</p>

  <p>"Then what is your plan?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you. But do not let us speak so loud: little pitchers have
  long ears. My notion is that we make for the hotel, the name of which I was
  careful to give the driver in the hearing of the boy. We will engage a couple
  of rooms there, order breakfast for to-morrow morning, still in the hearing
  of the boy, and afterwards get out of the way as quietly as possible."</p>

  <p>"It sounds feasible enough," I replied, "if only we can do it. But do you
  think the men will be so easily fooled?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that remains to be proved. However, we shall very soon find
  out."</p>

  <p>"A pretty sort of thing you've let yourself in for, Master Ingleby!" I
  thought to myself as Nikola lapsed into silence once more. "A week ago you
  were starving in a back street in London, and now it looks very much as if
  you are going to be murdered in affluence in Newcastle. However, you've let
  yourself in for it, and have only yourself to blame for the result."</p>

  <p>Consoling myself in this philosophic way, I held my peace until the cab
  drew up before the hostelry to which my companion had alluded. As soon as we
  were at a standstill, Nikola alighted and went into the hotel to inquire
  about rooms. As we had agreed, I remained in the cab until he returned.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Ingleby," he cried, as he crossed the pavement again.
  "They're very full, but we can have the rooms until the day after to-morrow.
  After that we must look elsewhere. Now let us get the traps inside."</p>

  <p>The porter emerged and took our luggage, and we accompanied him into the
  building. As we did so I saw the ragged urchin who had ridden behind the cab
  draw near the portico.</p>

  <p>The manager received us in the hall. "Numbers 59 and 60," he said to the
  porter. "Would you care for any supper, gentlemen?" We thanked him, but
  declined, and then followed the porter upstairs to the rooms in question.
  Having seen my luggage safely installed and the man on his way downstairs,
  Nikola showed himself ready for business.</p>

  <p>"When you get into these sort of scrapes," he said, "it is just as well to
  have a good memory. I know these rooms of old, and directly I saw the
  position we were in I thought they might prove of use to us. I once did the
  manager a good turn, and when I explain matters to him I fancy he will
  understand why we have taken up our abode with him only to leave again so
  suddenly. Have you a sheet of notepaper and an envelope in your bag?"</p>

  <p>I produced them for him, whereupon he wrote a note, and having placed a
  bank-note inside, addressed it to his friend.</p>

  <p>"I'll leave it on the chimneypiece, where the chambermaid will be certain
  to see it," he said. "I have told the manager that we are obliged to leave in
  this unceremonious fashion in order to rid ourselves of some unpleasant
  fellow-travellers, who have been following us about with what I can only
  think must be hostile intent. Until we return I have asked him to take charge
  of your baggage, so that you need have no fear on that score. I am sorry you
  should have to lose it, but I can lend you anything you may require until you
  get possession of it again. Now, if only we can get out of this window and
  down to the Tyneside once more, without being seen, I think we may safely say
  we have given Quong Ma the slip for good and all."</p>

  <p>So saying he crossed the room and threw open the window.</p>

  <p>"We are both active men," Nikola continued, "and should experience small
  difficulty in dropping on to the roof of the outhouse below; thence we can
  make our way along the wall to the back. Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>"Quite ready," I answered; whereupon he crawled out of the window and,
  holding on by both hands, lowered himself until his feet were only a yard or
  so above the roof of the outhouse to which he had referred. Then he let go
  and dropped. I followed his example, after which we made our way in Indian
  file along the wall, passed the stables, and dropped without adventure into
  the dark lane at the rear of the hotel. It was the first time in my life I
  had left a building of that description in such an unceremonious fashion,
  yet, strangely enough, I remember, it caused me no surprise. In Nikola's
  company the most extraordinary performances seemed commonplace, and in the
  natural order of things.</p>

  <p>"From now forward we must proceed with the greatest caution," said my
  companion, as we regained our feet and paused before making our way down the
  dark lane towards a small street at the farther end. "They are scarcely
  likely to watch the back of the hotel, but it will be safer for us to suppose
  them to be doing so."</p>

  <p>Acting up to this decision, we proceeded with as much caution as if every
  shadow were an enemy and every doorway contained a villainous Celestial. We
  saw nothing of the men we feared, however, and eventually reached the
  thoroughfare leading to the docks, without further adventure. But, fortunate
  as we had been, we were not destined to get away as successfully as we had
  hoped to do. We were within sight of the river when something, I cannot now
  remember what, induced me to look back. I did so just in time to catch a
  glimpse of a figure emerging from the shadow of a tall building. At any other
  time such a circumstance would have given rise to no suspicion in my mind;
  but, worked up to such a pitch as I was then, I seemed gifted with an
  unerring instinct that told me as plainly as any words that the man in
  question was following us, and that he was the Chinaman we were <i>so</i>
  anxious to avoid. I pointed him out to Nikola, and asked whether he agreed
  with me as to the man's identity.</p>

  <p>"We will soon decide that point," was his reply. "Slacken your pace for a
  moment, and when I give the word wheel sharply round and walk towards
  him."</p>

  <p>We executed this manoeuvre, and began to walk quickly back in the
  direction we had come. The mysterious figure was still making his way along
  the darker side of the street; and our suspicions were soon confirmed, for on
  seeing us turn he turned also, and a few seconds later disappeared down a
  side street.</p>

  <p>"He is spying on us, sure enough," said Nikola, "and I do not see how we
  are going to baffle him. Let us hasten on to the river and trust to luck to
  get on board the yacht without his finding out where we have gone."</p>

  <p>Once more we turned ourselves about, and in something less than five
  minutes had reached the landing-place for which we were steering. Then
  pulling a whistle from his pocket, Nikola blew three sharp notes upon it. An
  answer came from the deck of the yacht out in the stream. It had scarcely
  died away before a boat put off from alongside the craft and came swiftly
  towards us.</p>

  <p>"It is only a question of minutes now," said Nikola, throwing a hasty
  glance round him. "Time <i>versus</i> the Chinaman, and if I am not mistaken
  "&mdash;here the boat drew up at the steps&mdash;"time has the best of it.
  Come along, my friend; let us get on board."</p>

  <p>I followed him down the steps and took my place in the dinghy. The men
  pulling bent to their oars, and we shot out into the stream.</p>

  <p>"Look," said Nikola, pointing to the place we had just left: "I thought
  our friend would not be very far behind us."</p>

  <p>I followed with my eyes the direction in which he pointed, and, sure
  enough, I could just distinguish a dark figure standing upon the steps.</p>

  <p>"They would like to catch me if they could," observed the Doctor, with a
  shrug of his shoulders and one of his peculiar laughs. "If they have tried
  once they have done so a hundred times. I will do them the credit of saying
  that their plans have been admirably laid, but Fate has stood by me, and on
  each occasion they have miscarried. They tried it first at Ya-Chow-Fu, then
  at I-chang, afterwards in Shanghai, Rangoon, Bombay, London, Paris, and St.
  Petersburg, and I can't tell you how many other places; but as you see, they
  have not succeeded so far."</p>

  <p>"But why should they do it?" I asked. "What is the reason of it all?"</p>

  <p>"That is too long a story for me to tell you now," he replied, as the boat
  drew up at the accommodation-ladder. "You shall hear it another day. Our
  object now must be to get away from Newcastle without further loss of
  time."</p>

  <p>I followed him along the deck to where a short stout man stood waiting to
  receive <i>us.</i></p>

  <p>"Are you ready, Stevens?" asked Nikola.</p>

  <p>"All ready, sir," the other replied, with the brevity of a man who is not
  accustomed to waste his words.</p>

  <p>"In that case let us start as quickly as possible."</p>

  <p>"At once," the man replied, and immediately went forward; while Nikola
  conducted me down a prettily arranged and constructed companion-ladder to the
  saloon below. As we reached it I heard the tinkle of the telegraph from the
  bridge to the engine room, and almost simultaneously the screw began to
  revolve and we were under way. After the darkness outside, the brilliant
  light of the saloon in which we now stood was so dazzling that I failed to
  notice the fact that a bedplace had been made up behind the butt of the
  mizzen mast. Upon this lay the old Don, and seated by his side, and holding
  his hand, was the Dona Consuelo.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," said Nikola in his kindest manner, as he advanced
  towards her, "I fear you must be worn out. However, we are under way again
  now, and I have instructed my servant to prepare a cabin for you, in which I
  trust you will be fairly comfortable."</p>

  <p>Dona Consuelo had risen, and was standing looking into his face as if she
  were frightened of something he was about to say.</p>

  <p>"I am not at all tired," she said, "and if you don't mind, I would far
  rather remain here with my great-grandfather."</p>

  <p>"As you wish," answered Nikola abstractedly. Then, stooping, he raised the
  old man's left hand and felt his pulse. The long, thin fingers of the Doctor,
  indicative of his extraordinary skill as a surgeon, seemed to twine round the
  other's emaciated wrist, while his face wore a look I had never seen upon it
  before&mdash;it was that of the born enthusiast, the man who loves his
  profession more than aught else in the world. While, however, I was observing
  Nikola, you must not suppose I was regardless of the Dona Consuelo. To a
  student of character, the expression upon her face could scarcely have been
  anything but interesting. While Nikola was conducting his examination, she
  watched him as if she dreaded what he might do next. Fear there was in
  abundance, but of admiration for the man I could discover no trace. The
  examination concluded, Nikola addressed two or three pertinent questions to
  her concerning her great-grandfather's health during the voyage, which she
  answered with corresponding clearness and conciseness. The old man himself,
  however, though conscious, did not utter a word, but lay staring up at the
  skylight above his head, just as I had seen him do on board the <i>Dotta
  Mercedes.</i></p>

  <p>Fully five hours must have elapsed before we reached our destination;
  indeed, day had broken, and the sun was in the act of rising, when a gentle
  tapping upon the skylight overhead warned Nikola that our voyage was nearly
  at an end. Leaving the old man in his great-granddaughter's care, Nikola
  signed to me to follow him to the deck.</p>

  <p>"It may interest you to see your future home," he said, as we stepped out
  of the companion into the cool morning air, and looked out over the sea,
  which the rim of the newly risen sun was burnishing until it shone like
  polished silver. At the moment the yacht was entering a small bay, surrounded
  by giant cliffs, against which the great rollers of the North Sea broke
  continuously. The bay itself was in deep shadow, and was as dreary a place as
  any I have seen. I looked about me for a dwelling of any sort, but not a sign
  of such a thing could I discover: only a long stretch of frowning cliff and
  desolate, wind-swept tableland.</p>

  <p>"At first glance it does not look inviting," said Nikola, with a smile
  upon his face, as he noticed the expression upon mine. "I confess I have seen
  a more hospitable coast-line, but never one better fitted for the work we
  have in hand."</p>

  <p>"But I do not see the castle," I replied. "I have looked in every
  direction, but can discover no trace of it."</p>

  <p>"One of its charms," he continued triumphantly. "You cannot see it because
  at present it is hidden by yonder headland. When we are safely in the bay,
  however, you will have a good view of it. It is a fine old building, and in
  bygone days must have been a place of considerable importance. Ships
  innumerable have gone to pieces in sight of its turrets; while deep down in
  its own foundations I am told there are dungeons enough to imprison half the
  county. See, we are opening up the bay now, and in five minutes shall be at
  anchor. I wonder what result we shall have achieved when we next steam
  between these heads."</p>

  <p>While he was speaking we had passed from the open sea into the still water
  of the bay, and the yacht was slowing down perceptibly. Gradually the picture
  unfolded itself, until, standing out in bold relief upon the cliffs like some
  grim sentinel of the past, the castle which, for some time to come at least,
  was destined to be my home came into view. Who its architect had been I was
  never able to discover, but he must have been impregnated with the desolation
  and solemn grandeur of the coast, and in his building have tried to equal it.
  As Nikola had said, a place better fitted for the work we had come to do
  could not have been discovered in the length and breadth of England. The
  nearest village was upwards of twelve miles distant; farms or dwelling-houses
  there were none within view of its towers. Tourists seldom ventured near it,
  for the reason that it was not only a place difficult of approach, but, what
  was perhaps of more importance, because there was nothing of interest to be
  seen when you reached it. As I gazed at it, I thought of the girl in the
  saloon below, and wondered what her feelings would be, and what her life
  would be like, in such a dismal place. I glanced at Nikola, who was gazing up
  at the grim walls with such rapt attention that it was easily seen his
  thoughts were far away. Then the telegraph sounded, and the screw ceased to
  revolve, The spell was broken, and we were recalled to the realities of the
  moment.</p>

  <p>"I was miles away," said Nikola, looking round at me.</p>

  <p>"I could see you were," I answered.</p>

  <p>"You would be very surprised if you knew of what I was thinking," he
  continued. "I was recalling a place not unlike this, but ten thousand miles
  or more away. It is a monastery, similarly situated, on the top of enormous
  cliffs. It was there I obtained the secret which is the backbone of the
  discovery we are about to test. I have been in some queer places in my time,
  but never such a one as that. But we haven't time to talk of that now. What
  we have to do is to get the old man ashore and up to yonder building. If
  anything were to happen to him now, I think it would break my heart."</p>

  <p>"And his great-granddaughter's also," I put in; "for you must admit she is
  devoted to him."</p>

  <p>He threw a quick glance at me, as if he were trying to discern how far I
  was interested in the beautiful girl in the saloon below. Whatever conclusion
  he may have come to, however, he said nothing to me upon the subject. Having
  ordered the captain to see the boat&mdash;which had been specially prepared
  for the work of carrying the old gentleman ashore&mdash;brought alongside, he
  made his way to the saloon, and I accompanied him.</p>

  <p>"We have reached our destination, Dona Consuelo," he said, as he
  approached the bed, beside which she was sitting.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, there leapt into her eyes the same look of terror I had
  noticed before. It reminded me more than anything else of the expression one
  sees in the eyes of a rabbit when the snare has closed upon it. As I noticed
  it, for the first time since I had known him, a feeling of hatred for Nikola
  came over me. It was not until we were in the boat and were making our way
  ashore that I found an opportunity of speaking to her without Nikola
  overhearing us.</p>

  <p>"Courage, my dear young lady, courage!" I said. "Believe me, there is
  nothing to fear. I will pledge my life for your safety."</p>

  <p>She gave me a look of gratitude, and stooped as if to arrange the heavy
  travelling-rug covering her aged relative. In reality I believe it was to
  hide the tears with which her eyes were filled. From that moment there
  existed an indefinable, real bond between us; and though I did not realise it
  at the moment, the first mark had been made upon the chain with which Nikola
  imagined he had bound me to him.</p>

  <p>On reaching that side of the bay on which there was a short strip of
  beach, the boat was grounded. The four sailors immediately took up the litter
  upon which the old man lay, and carried it ashore. The path up to the castle
  was a steep and narrow one, and the work of conveying him to the top was by
  no means easy. Eventually, however, it was accomplished, and we stood before
  the entrance to the castle. Moat there was none, but in place of it, and
  spanned by the drawbridge&mdash;a ponderous affair, something like fifty feet
  long by ten wide&mdash;was an enormous chasm going sheer down in one drop
  fully two hundred feet. At the bottom water could be seen; and at night, when
  the tide came in, the gurgling and moaning that rose from it was sufficient
  to appal the stoutest heart.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to Allerdeyne Castle!" said Nikola, as we crossed the bridge and
  entered the archway of the ancient keep. Then, bending over the old man on
  the litter, he added: "When you cross this threshold again, my old friend, I
  hope that you will be fully restored to health and strength&mdash;a young man
  again in every sense of the word. Dona Consuelo, I am all anxiety to hear
  your opinion of the apartments I have caused to be prepared for you."</p>

  <p>Moving in procession as before, we crossed the great courtyard, which
  echoed to the sound of our footsteps, and, reaching a door on the farther
  side, entered and found ourselves standing in a well-proportioned hall, from
  which a staircase of solid stone, up which a dozen soldiers might have
  marched abreast, led to the floors above. With Nikola still in advance, we
  made the ascent, turned to the right hand, and proceeded along a corridor,
  upwards of fifty yards in length, out of which opened a number of lofty
  rooms. Before the door of one of these Nikola paused.</p>

  <p>"This is the apartment I have set aside for your own particular use, my
  dear young lady," he said; and with that he threw open the door, and showed
  us a large room, carpeted, curtained, and furnished in a fashion I was far
  from expecting to find in so sombre a building.</p>

  <p>"Should there be anything wanting," he said, "you will honour me by
  mentioning it, when I will do all that lies in my power to supply it."</p>

  <p>Her face was very pale, and her lips trembled a little as she faltered a
  question as to where her great-grandfather was to be domiciled.</p>

  <p>"I have come to the conclusion that, for the future, it would be better,"
  said Nikola, speaking very slowly and distinctly, as if in anticipation of
  future trouble, "that you should entrust him to my care. Ingleby and I,
  between us, will make ourselves responsible for his safety, and you may rest
  assured we will see that no harm comes to him. You must endeavour to amuse
  yourself as best you can, consoling yourself with the knowledge that we are
  doing all that science can do for him."</p>

  <p>As he said this he smiled a little sarcastically, as if her reading of the
  word science would be likely to differ considerably from his.</p>

  <p>"But surely you do not mean that I am to give him up to you entirely?" she
  cried, this time in real terror. "You cannot be so cruel as to mean that. Oh,
  Dr. Nikola, I implore you not to take him altogether from me. I cannot bear
  it."</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," said Nikola, a little more sternly than he had yet
  spoken, "in this matter you must be guided by me. I can brook no interference
  of any description. Surely you should know me well enough by this time to be
  aware of that."</p>

  <p>"But he is all I have to live for&mdash;all I have to love," the girl
  faltered. "Can you not make allowance for that?"</p>

  <p>Her voice was piteous in its pleading, and when I heard Nikola's chilling
  tones as he answered her, I could have found it in my heart to strike him. To
  have interfered at all, however, would have done no sort of good; so, hard as
  it seemed, I was perforce compelled to hold my tongue.</p>

  <p>"If you love your great-grandfather," he said, "you will offer no
  opposition to my scheme. Have I not already assured you that I will return
  him to you a different man? But we are wasting time, and these stone
  corridors are too cold and draughty for him. If you will be guided by me, you
  will rest a little after your exertions. There is an old woman below who
  shall come to you, and do her best to make herself useful to you." Seeing
  that to protest further would be useless, the girl turned and went into the
  room, trying to stifle the sobs that would not be kept back. The sight was
  one which would have grieved a harder heart than mine, and it hurt me the
  more because I knew that I was powerless to help her.</p>

    <p class="caption">Trying to stifle the sobs that would not be kept
    back.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>All this time the four sailors, who had carried the litter up from the
  beach, had been silent spectators of the scene. Now they took up their burden
  once more and followed Nikola, along the corridor, up some more steps, down
  still another passage, until I lost all count of the way that we had come.
  The greater portion of the castle had been allowed to fall into disrepair.
  Heavy masses of cobwebs stretched from wall to wall, a large proportion of
  the doors were worm-eaten, and in some instances had even fallen in
  altogether, revealing desolate apartments, in which the wind from the sea
  whistled, and the noise of the waves echoed with blood-curdling effect.
  Reaching the end of the second corridor, Nikola paused before a heavy curtain
  which was drawn closely from wall to wall, and ordered the men to set down
  their burden. They obeyed; and, on being told to do so, took their departure
  with as much speed as they could put into the operation. If I know anything
  of the human face, they were not a little relieved at receiving permission to
  clear out of a place that had every right to be considered the abode of a
  certain Old Gentleman whom it scarcely becomes me to mention.</p>

  <p>When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Nikola drew back the
  curtain and displayed a plain but very strong wooden door. From the fact that
  the workmanship was almost new I surmised that my host had placed it there
  himself, but for what purpose I could only conjecture. Taking a key from his
  pocket, he slipped it into the patent lock, turned the handle, and the door
  swung open.</p>

  <p>"Take up your end of the litter," he said, "and help me to carry it
  inside."</p>

  <p>I did as I was ordered; and, bearing the old man between us, we passed
  into that portion of the castle which, as I soon discovered, he had fitted up
  in readiness for the great experiment.</p>

  <p>Having passed the door, we found ourselves in a comparatively lofty room,
  or perhaps I had better say hall, the walls of which were covered almost
  entirely with anatomical specimens. From what I could see of them I should
  say that many of them were quite unique, while all were extremely valuable.
  Where and by what means he had collected them I was never able to discover,
  although Nikola, on one or two occasions, threw out hints. There they were,
  however, and I promised myself that during my stay in the place I would use
  them for perfecting my own knowledge on the subject.</p>

  <p>At the end of this hall, and looking over the sea, was a large window,
  while in either wall were several doors, all of which, like that in the
  corridor, were heavily curtained. The carpet was of cork and quite noiseless;
  the lights were electric, the batteries and dynamos being in a room below.
  The heating arrangements were excellent, while the ventilation was of the
  most modern and improved description. I noticed that Nikola smiled a little
  contemptuously at my astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You were unprepared for this surprise," he said. "Well, let me give you a
  little piece of advice, and that is, never be astonished at anything you may
  see or hear while you are with me. The commonplace and I, I can assure you
  once and for all, do not live together. I have homes in all parts of the
  world; I am in England to-day, engaged upon one piece of work, and in six
  months' time I may be in India, Japan, Peru, Kamtschatka, or if you like it
  better, shall we say playing tricks with niggers in Cape Coast Castle? But
  see, we are keeping our old friend waiting. I will find out if all the
  preparations I have ordered are complete; if so, we will convey him at once
  to the chamber set apart for him."</p>

  <p>With that he touched a bell, and almost before he had removed his finger
  from the button, a curtain at the farther end was drawn aside, and the same
  Chinese servant&mdash;the deaf-and-dumb individual, I mean, who had brought
  the letter to me at my lodgings in London the previous week&mdash;entered the
  room. Seeing his master, he bent himself nearly double, and when he had
  resumed his upright posture as curious a conversation commenced as ever I
  have known. I use the word "conversation" for the simple reason that I do not
  know how else to describe it. As a matter of fact it was not a conversation
  at all, for the reason that not a word was spoken on either side; their lips
  moved, but not a sound came from them. And yet they seemed quite able to
  understand one another. If, however, it was a strange performance, it had at
  least the merit of being an extremely successful one.</p>

  <p>"He tells me that everything is prepared," Nikola remarked, as the man
  crossed the room and drew back another curtain from a doorway on our left.
  "This is the room; but before we carry him into it I think we had better have
  a little light upon the subject."</p>

  <p>To press the electric switch was the work of a moment, and as soon as this
  had been done we once more took up our burden and carried it into the inner
  room. Prepared as I had been by the outer hall for something extraordinary, I
  was perhaps not so much surprised at the apartment in which I now found
  myself as I should otherwise have been. And yet it was sufficiently
  remarkable to fill any one with wonder.</p>

  <p>It was upwards of twenty feet in length by possibly eighteen in width. The
  walls and the ceilings were as black as charcoal, and, when the electric
  light was extinguished, not a ray of anything would be visible. In the centre
  was a strange contrivance which I could see was intended to serve as a bed,
  and for some other purpose, which at the moment was not quite apparent to me.
  In the farther corners were a couple of queer-looking pieces of machinery,
  one of which reminded me somewhat of an unusually large electric battery; the
  other I could not understand at all. A machine twice the size of those
  usually employed for manufacturing ozone stood opposite the door;
  thermometers of every sort and description were arranged at intervals along
  the walls; while on one side was an ingenious apparatus for heating the room,
  and on the other a similar one for cooling it. At the head and foot of the
  bed were two brass pillars, the construction and arrangements of which
  reminded me of electric terminals on an exaggerated scale.</p>

  <p>We placed the old gentleman on the bed. The litter was thereupon removed
  by the servant, and Nikola and I stood facing each other across the form of
  the man who was to prove, or disprove, the feasibility of the discovery my
  extraordinary employer claimed to have made.</p>

  <p>"For twenty-four hours," said Nikola, "he must have absolute peace and
  quiet. Nothing must disturb him. Nor must he taste food."</p>

  <p>"But is he capable, do you think," I asked, "of going without nourishment
  for so long a time?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly! On the draught I am about to administer to him, he could do
  without it, were such a thing necessary, for a much longer period. Indeed, it
  would not hurt him if he were to eat nothing for a month."</p>

  <p>He left the room for a moment, and when he returned he carried in his hand
  a tiny phial of the same description, though much smaller, as those which had
  been stolen from me on board the steamer. It contained a thick, red mixture,
  which, when he removed the stopper, threw off a highly pungent odour. He
  opened the mouth of the patient and poured upwards of a teaspoonful into it.
  As before, I expected to see some immediate result, but my curiosity was not
  gratified. Deftly arranging the bed-coverings, Nikola inspected the
  thermometers, tested the hot and cold air apparatus, and then turned to
  me.</p>

    <p class="caption">It contained a thick, red mixture.</p>

  <p>"He will require little or no supervision for some hours to come," he
  said, "so we may safely leave him. To while away the time, if you care about
  it, I will show you something of my abode. I think I can promise you both
  instruction and amusement."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; LIFE IN THE CASTLE</h2>

  <p class="first">LEAVING the room in which we had placed Don Miguel de
  Moreno, as described in the previous chapter, we returned to the hall, the
  same in which was contained the magnificent collection of anatomical
  specimens already mentioned. Tired as I was,&mdash;for it must be remembered
  that I had had but little sleep during the first night I had spent on board
  the <i>Dona Mercedes,</i> and none at all on that through which we had just
  passed, while I had had a great deal of excitement, and my fair share of hard
  work,&mdash;I would not have lost the opportunity of exploring Nikola's
  quarters in this grim old castle for any consideration whatsoever. Nikola
  himself, though one would scarcely have thought it from his appearance, must
  have possessed a constitution of iron, for he seemed as fresh as when I had
  first seen him at Kelleran's house in London. There was a vitality about him,
  a briskness, and, if I may so express it, an enjoyment of labour for its own
  sake, that I do not remember ever to have found in another man. As I was soon
  to discover, my description of him was not very wide of the mark. He would do
  the work of half a dozen men, and at the end be ready, and not only ready but
  eager, for more. In addition to this, I noticed another peculiarity about
  him. Unlike most people who are fond of work, he possessed an infinite fund
  of patience; could wait for an issue, whatever it might be, to develop itself
  naturally, and, unlike so many experimentalists, betrayed no desire to hurry
  it by the employment of extraneous means. In thus putting forward my reading
  of the most complex character that has ever come under my notice, I do so
  with an absolute freedom from bias. Indeed, I might almost say, that I do so
  in a great measure against my own inclinations, as will be apparent to you
  when you have finished my story.</p>

  <p>"As I informed you in London," said this strange individual, after he had
  closed the door of the patient's room behind him, had drawn the heavy
  curtain, and switched off the electric light, "I purchased this famous castle
  expressly for the experiment we are about to try. The owner, so my business
  people informed me, was amazed that I should want it at all; but then, you
  see, he did not understand its value. If I had searched the world, I could
  not have discovered a better. While we are near enough to civilisation to be
  able to obtain anything we may require in the way of drugs or incidental
  apparatus, we have no prying neighbours; such household stores as we require
  the yacht brings us direct from Newcastle; an old man and woman, who take
  care of the place when I am absent, have their quarters in the keep; my
  Chinese servant cooks for me personally, and attends to the wants, which are
  not many, of the other people under my care."</p>

  <p>"Other people under your care?" I echoed. "I had no idea there was any one
  in the house save yourself and your servants."</p>

  <p>"It is scarcely likely you would have any idea of it," he observed,
  "seeing that no one knows of it save Ah-Win, who, for reasons you have seen,
  is unable to talk about them, and myself, who would be even less likely to do
  so. Would you care to see them?"</p>

  <p>I replied that I would very much like to do so, and he was about to lead
  me across the hall towards the door, through which the Chinese servant had
  entered some little time before, when a curious circumstance happened. With a
  bound that was not unlike the spring of a tiger, an enormous cat, black as
  the Pit of Tophet, jumped from the room, and, approaching his master, rubbed
  himself backwards and forwards against his legs. Seeing my astonishment,
  Nikola condescended to explain.</p>

  <p>"You are going to say, I can tell, that you have never seen such a cat as
  Apollyon. I don't suppose you have. If he could talk, he would be able to
  tell some strange stories; would you not, old man? He has been my almost
  constant companion for many years, and more than once he has been the means
  of saving my life."</p>

  <p>Replacing Apollyon, whom he had picked up, on the floor, he conducted me
  towards the entrance of another corridor which led in the direction of the
  keep. Half-way down it was a rough iron gate, which was securely
  padlocked.</p>

  <p>Nikola undid it, and when we were on the other side carefully relocked it
  after him.</p>

  <p>"Though you might not think so," he said, "these precautions are
  necessary. Some of my patients are extremely valuable, and I have not the
  least desire that they should escape from my keeping and fall over the
  battlements into the sea below. Follow me."</p>

  <p>I accompanied him towards yet another door, which he also unlocked. The
  scene which met my gaze when he threw it open, to employ a hackneyed phrase,
  beggars description. The room was about the same size as that occupied by the
  Dona Consuelo, but it was not its proportions that amazed me, but its
  occupants. Accustomed as I had necessarily been, by virtue of my profession,
  to what are commonly called horrors, I found that I was not proof against
  what I had before me now. It was sufficient to make my blood run cold.
  Anything more gruesome could scarcely have been discovered or even imagined.
  Try to picture for yourself the inmates of a dozen freak museums, and the
  worst of the monstrosities of which you have ever read or heard, and you will
  only have some dim notion of the folk whom Nikola so ironically called his
  patients. Some were like men, but not men as we know them; some were like
  monkeys, but of a kind I had never seen before, and which I sincerely hope I
  may never see again; there were things, dull, flabby, faceless
  things&mdash;but there, I can go no farther. To attempt to describe them to
  you in detail is a work of which my pen is quite incapable.</p>

  <p>"A happy family," said Nikola, advancing into the room, "and without
  exception devoted to their nurse, Ah-Win, yonder, who, as you are aware, in a
  measure shares their afflictions with them. Some day, if you care about it, I
  should be only too pleased to give you a lecture, with demonstrations, such
  as you would get in no medical school in the world."</p>

  <p>Though I have attempted to set down his offer word for word, I have but
  the vaguest recollection of it; for, long before he had finished speaking, I
  had staggered, sick and faint with horror, into the corridor outside. Not for
  the wealth of England would I have remained there a minute longer. To see
  those loathsome creatures fawning round Nikola, clutching at his legs and
  stroking his clothes, was too much for me, and I verily believe an hour in
  that room would have had the effect of making me an idiot like themselves. A
  few moments later Nikola joined me in the passage.</p>

  <p>"You are very easily affected, my dear Ingleby," he said, with one of his
  peculiar smiles. "I should have thought your hospital experience would have
  endowed you with stronger nerves. My poor people in yonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't, don't," I cried, holding up my hand in entreaty. "Don't speak to
  me of them. Don't let me think of them. If I do, I believe I shall go mad. My
  God! are you human, that you can live with such things about you?"</p>

  <p>"I believe I am," he answered with the utmost coolness. "But why make such
  a fuss? Do like I do, and regard them from a scientific standpoint only. The
  poor things have come into this world handicapped by misfortune; I endeavour
  as far as possible to ameliorate their conditions, and in return they enable
  me to perfect my knowledge of the human frame as no other living man can ever
  hope to do. Of course, I know there are people who look askance at me for
  keeping them; but that does not trouble me. At one time they lived with me in
  Port Said, which, when you come to think of it, is a fit and proper place for
  such a hospital. Circumstances, however, combined to induce me to leave.
  Eventually we came here. Some time, if you care to hear it, I will tell you
  the story of their voyage home. It would interest you."</p>

  <p>I protested, however, that I desired to hear no more about them; I had
  both seen and heard too much already. That being so, Nikola led me along the
  passage and through the iron gate, which he locked behind him as before, and
  so conducted me to the hall whence we had first set out. Once there, he went
  to a corner cabinet, and from it produced a decanter. Pouring me out a stiff
  glass of brandy, he bade me drink it.</p>

  <p>"You look as if you want it," he said. And Heaven knows he was right.</p>

  <p>"And now," he said, when I had finished it, "if you will take my advice,
  you will lie down for an hour or two. For the convenience of our work, I have
  arranged that you shall occupy a room near me. This is it. Should I want you,
  I will ring a bell."</p>

  <p>The room to which he alluded adjoined his own, and was situated at the far
  end of the hall, the door, like those of the others I have described, being
  concealed behind a curtain. Never was permission to retire more willingly
  accepted, and within five minutes of leaving him I was in bed and asleep.</p>

  <p>It must have been between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon when I
  retired; and the afternoon was well advanced before I woke again. Heavily as
  I slept, however, it had not been restful slumber. All things considered, I
  had much better have been waking.</p>

  <p>Over and over again I saw the Dona Consuelo standing before me, just as
  she had done before Nikola that day; there was this difference,
  however&mdash;instead of asking to be allowed to remain with her
  great-grandfather, her prayer was that I should save both him and her from
  Nikola. While she pleaded to me, the faces of the terrible creatures I had
  seen in that room down the passage peered at us from all sorts of
  hiding-places. It was night, an hour or so before dawn. I had acceded to the
  Dona's request, and was flying from the castle, carrying her in my arms.</p>

  <p>At last, after I appeared to have been running for an eternity, we reached
  the shore, where I hoped to find a boat awaiting us. But not a sign of one
  was to be seen. While I waited day broke, and I placed my burden on the sand,
  only to spring back from it with a cry of horror. It was not the Dona
  Consuelo I had been carrying, but one of those loathsome creatures I had seen
  in that terrible room. A fit of rage came over me, and I was about to wreak
  my vengeance on the unhappy idiot, when I woke. I looked about me at the
  somewhat sparsely furnished room, and some seconds elapsed before I realised
  where I was. Then the memory of our arrival at the castle, and of all that
  had happened since, returned to me. I shuddered, and had it not been for that
  poor girl, so lonely and friendless, I could have found it in my heart to
  wish myself back in London once more. Having dressed myself, I went out into
  the hall. Nikola was not there. I waited for some time, but as he did not put
  in an appearance I left the room and made my way down the corridor in the
  direction of the Dona Consuelo's sitting-room. Not able to get any answer
  when I knocked, I continued my walk, ascended another flight of stairs, and
  eventually found myself upon the battlements. A better place for observing
  the construction of the castle, and of obtaining a view of the surrounding
  country, could not have been desired. On one side I could look away across
  the moorland towards a distant range of hills, and on the other along the
  cliffs and across the wide expanse of sea. In the tiny bay to my right the
  yacht which had brought us from Newcastle lay at anchor; and had it not been
  for that and a column of grey smoke rising from a chimney, I might have
  believed myself to be living in a world of my own. For some time I stood
  watching the panorama spread out before me. I was still looking at it when a
  soft footfall sounded on the stones behind me. I turned to find Dona Consuelo
  approaching me. She was dressed entirely in black, and wore a lace mantilla
  over her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven, I have found you, Dr. Ingleby," she cried, as she hastened
  towards me. "I had begun to think myself deserted by everybody."</p>

  <p>"Why should you do that?" I asked. "You know that could never be."</p>

  <p>"I am certain of nothing now," she answered. "You cannot imagine what I
  have been through to-day."</p>

  <p>"I am indeed sorry to hear you have been unhappy," I continued. "Is there
  any way in which I can be of service to you?"</p>

  <p>"There are many ways, but I fear you would not employ them," she replied.
  "I am hungering to be with my great-grandfather again. Can you tell me why
  Dr. Nikola takes him away from me?"</p>

  <p>"I fancied that he had told you," I answered; "but if it be any
  consolation to you, let me give you my assurance that he is tenderly cared
  for. His comfort is secured in every way; and from what Dr. Nikola has said
  to me, and from what I have seen myself, I feel convinced he will be able to
  do what he has promised and make your great-grandfather a hale and hearty man
  once more."</p>

  <p>"It is all very well for him to say that," she said, "but why am I not
  permitted to be with him? If he needs nursing, who would be likely to wait
  upon him so devotedly as the woman who loves him? Surely Dr. Nikola cannot
  imagine his secret would be unsafe with me if he reveals it to you, a rival
  in his own profession?"</p>

  <p>"It is not that at all," I answered. "I do not fancy Nikola has given a
  moment's consideration to the safety of his secret." Then, seeing the
  loophole of escape she presented to me, I added: "From what you know of him,
  I should have thought you would have understood that he has no great liking
  for your sex. To put it bluntly, Nikola is a woman-hater of the most
  determined order, and I fancy he would find it impossible to carry out his
  plans if you were in attendance upon the Don."</p>

  <p>"Ah well! I suppose I must be content with your assurance," she said with
  a sigh.</p>

  <p>"For the present, I am very much afraid so," I replied.</p>

  <p>At this moment the old woman whom Nikola had appointed to wait upon us
  made her appearance, and informed the Dona that her dinner awaited her. About
  my own meals she knew nothing, so I concluded from this that I was to take
  them with Nikola in our own portion of the castle. Such proved to be the
  case; for when we reached the Dona Consuelo's apartments on the floor below,
  we met Nikola awaiting us in the corridor.</p>

  <p>"I have been looking for you, Ingleby," he said, with a note of command in
  his voice. "You are quite ready for dinner, I have no doubt; and if you will
  accompany me, I think we shall find it waiting for us."</p>

  <p>As may be supposed, I would rather have partaken of it with Dona Consuelo;
  but as it was not to be, I bade her good morning, and was about to follow
  Nikola along the corridor, when he stopped, and, turning to the girl,
  said:</p>

  <p>"I can see from your face that you have been worrying about your
  grandfather. I assure you, you have not the least cause to do so; and I think
  Ingleby here, if he has not done so already, will bear me out in what I say.
  The old gentleman is doing excellently, and almost before you know he has
  been taken away from you, you will have him back again."</p>

  <p>"I thank you for your news," she replied; but there was very little
  friendliness in her voice. "I would rather, however, see him and convince
  myself of the fact." Then, bowing to us, she retired into her own apartments,
  while we made our way to the hall in search of our meal.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning," said Nikola, as we drew our chairs up to the table,
  "we must commence work in earnest. After that for some weeks to come I am
  afraid you will see but little of your fair friend down yonder. You seem to
  be on excellent terms with one another."</p>

  <p>As he said this he shot a keen glance at me, as though he were desirous of
  discovering what was passing in my mind. I was quite prepared for him,
  however, and answered in such an unconcerned way that I flattered myself,
  should he have got it into his head that there was anything more than mere
  friendship in our intimacy, he would be immediately disabused of the
  notion.</p>

  <p>As he had predicted, the following morning saw the commencement of that
  gigantic struggle with the forces of Nature, upon the result of which Nikola
  had pinned so much faith and which was destined, so he affirmed, to
  revolutionise the world. The most exhaustive preparations had been made, the
  duration of our watches in the sick-room were duly apportioned, and a minute
  outline of the treatment proposed was propounded to me.</p>

  <p>On entering the dark room in which the old Don lay, I discovered that the
  two bronze pedestals, the use of which had puzzled me so much on my first
  visit, had been moved near the bed, one been placed at its head and the other
  at its foot. These, as Nikola pointed out to me, were the terminals of an
  electric conductor for producing a constant current, which was to play
  without intermission a few feet above the patient's head. A peculiar and
  penetrating smell filled the room, which I had no difficulty in recognising
  as ozone, though Nikola's reason for using it in such a case was not at first
  apparent to me. The old Don himself lay just as we had left him the previous
  morning. His hands were by his sides; his eyes, as usual, were open, but saw
  nothing. It was not until I examined him closely that a slight respiratory
  movement was observable.</p>

  <p>"When I am not here," said Nikola, "it must be your business to see that
  this electric current is kept continually playing above him. It must not be
  permitted for an instant to abate one unit of its strength." Then, pointing
  to an instrument fixed at the further wall, he continued: "Here is a volt
  meter, with the maximum and minimum points plainly marked upon it Your record
  must also include temperature, which you will take on these dry and wet
  thermometers once every quarter of an hour. The currents of hot and cold air
  you can regulate by means of these handles. The temperature of the patient
  himself must be noted once in every hour, and should on no account be
  permitted to get higher or lower than it is at the present moment."</p>

  <p>Taking a clinical thermometer from his pocket, he applied it, and, when he
  had noted the result, handed it to me.</p>

  <p>"If it rises two points above that before the same hour three days hence,
  he will die&mdash;no skill can save him. If it drops, well, in eighty per
  cent, of cases, the result will be the same."</p>

  <p>"And suppose I detect a tendency to rise?"</p>

  <p>"In that case you must communicate instantly with me. Here is an electric
  button which will put you in touch with my room. I hope, however, that you
  will have no necessity to use it." Then, placing his hand upon my shoulder,
  he looked me full in the face. "Ingleby," he said, "you see how much trust I
  am placing in you. I tell you frankly, you have a great responsibility upon
  your shoulders. I am not going to beat about the bush with you. In this case
  there is no such thing as certainty. I have made the attempt three times
  before, and on each occasion my man has died simply through a moment's
  inattention on the part of my assistant. If the love of our science and a
  proper appreciation of the compliment I have paid you in asking you to share
  with me the honour of this great discovery do not weigh with you, think of
  the girl with whom you talked upon the battlements yesterday. You tried to
  make me believe that she was nothing to you. Some day, however, she may be.
  Remember what her grandfather's death would mean to her."</p>

  <p>"You need have no fear," I replied. "I assure you, you can trust me
  implicitly."</p>

  <p>"I do trust you," he answered. "Now let us get to work."</p>

  <p>So saying, he crossed the room and opened a square box, heavily clamped
  with iron, from which he took two china pots of ointment. Then, disrobing the
  old man, we anointed him with the most scrupulous care from head to foot.
  This we did three times, after which the second curious apparatus I had seen
  standing in the corner was wheeled up to the bedside. That it was an
  electrical instrument of some sort was plain, but what its specific use was I
  could not even conjecture. Nikola, however, very soon enlightened me upon the
  matter. Taking a number of large velvet pads, each of which was moulded to
  fit a definite portion of the human body, he placed them in position,
  attached the wires that connected them with the machine, and when all was
  ready turned on the current. At first no effect was observable. In about a
  minute and a half, however, if my memory serves me, the usual deathly pallor
  of the skin gave place to a faint blush, which presently increased until the
  skin exhibited a healthy glow; little by little the temporal veins, until
  then so prominent, gradually disappeared. In half an hour, during which the
  current had been slowly and very gradually increased, another dressing of
  both ointments was applied.</p>

  <p>"Take this glass and examine his skin," said Nikola, whose eyes were
  gleaming with excitement, as he handed me a powerful magnifying glass. When I
  bent over the patient and did as he directed, it was indeed a wonderful thing
  that I beheld. An hour before the skin had been soft and hung in loose folds
  upon the bones, while the pressure of a finger upon it would not leave it for
  upwards of a minute. Now it had in a measure regained its youthful
  elasticity, and upon my softly pinching it between my fingers I found that it
  recovered its colour almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"It is wonderful," I whispered. "Had I not seen it myself, I would never
  have believed it."</p>

  <p>When it had been applied for an hour, the electric current was turned off
  and the pads removed.</p>

  <p>"Now watch what happens very closely," said Nikola, "for, I assure you,
  the effect is curious."</p>

  <p>Scarcely able to breathe by reason of my excitement, I watched, and as I
  did so I saw the flush of apparent health gradually decrease, the skin become
  white and loose once more, while the superficial veins rose into prominence
  upon the temples. I glanced at Nikola, thinking that some mistake must have
  occurred and that he would show signs of disappointment. This, however, he
  did not do.</p>

  <p>"You surely did not imagine," he said, when I had questioned him upon the
  subject, "that the effect I produced would be permanent on the first
  application? No! we may hope to achieve a more lasting result in a
  fortnight's time, but not till then.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile, the effect must be produced in the same fashion every six
  hours, both day and night. Now give me those rugs; we must cover him
  carefully. In his present state the least draught would be fatal. Record the
  state of the volt meter, read your thermometers, and see that your
  ventilating apparatus is working properly. As I said just now, should you
  need me, remember the bell. One ring, when you have recorded your results,
  will inform me that all is progressing satisfactorily, while three will
  immediately bring me to your assistance. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>When I had assured him that I did, he left me. I accordingly switched off
  three of the electric lights, and sat myself down in a chair in
  semi-darkness, the centre of light being the patient on the bed. There was no
  fear of my feeling dull, for I had a great deal to think about. Taken
  altogether, the situation in which I found myself was as extraordinary as the
  most inveterate seeker after excitement could desire. Not a sound was to be
  heard. The stillness was that of the tomb, and yet I smiled to myself as I
  thought that, if Nikola's experiment achieved the result he expected of it,
  the simile was not an appropriate one, for it was not the silence of the tomb
  but of perpetual life itself. I looked at the figure on the bed before me,
  and tried to picture what the mystery he was unravelling would mean to
  mankind. It was a solemn thought. Should the experiment prove successful, how
  would it affect the world? Would it prove a blessing or a curse? But the
  thoughts it conjured up were too vast, the issues too great, and to attempt
  to solve them was only to lose oneself in the fields of wildest
  conjecture.</p>

  <p>For four hours I remained on duty, noting all that occurred; reading my
  thermometers, regulating the hot and cold air apparatus, and at intervals
  signalling to Nikola that everything was progressing satisfactorily. When he
  relieved me, I retired to rest and slept like a top, too tired even to
  dream.</p>

  <p>Of what happened during the fortnight following I have little to tell.
  Nikola and I watched by the bedside in turn, took our exercise upon the
  battlements, ate and slept with the regularity of automata. The life on one
  side was monotonous in the extreme; on the other it was filled with an unholy
  excitement that was the greater inasmuch as it had to be so carefully
  suppressed. To say that I was deeply interested in the work upon which I was
  engaged would be a by no means strong enough expression. The fire of
  enthusiasm, to which I have before alluded, was raging once more in my heart,
  and yet there had been little enough so far in the experiment to excite it.
  With that regularity which characterised the whole of our operations, we
  carried on the work I have described. Every sixth hour saw the skin tighten
  and become elastic, the hue of the flesh change from white to pink, the veins
  recede, and the hollows fill, only to return to their original state as soon
  as the electric current was withdrawn. Towards the end of the fortnight,
  however, there were not wanting signs to show that the effect was gradually
  becoming more lasting. In place of doing so at once, the change to the
  original condition did not occur until some eight or ten minutes after the
  pads had been removed. And here I must remark that there was one other point
  in the case which struck me as peculiar. When I had first seen the old man,
  his finger-nails were of that pale yellow tint so often observable in the
  very old, now they were a delicate shade of pink; while his hair was, I felt
  convinced, a darker shade than it had been before. As Nikola was careful to
  point out, we had arrived at the most critical stage of the experiment. A
  mistake at this juncture, would not only undo all the work we had
  accomplished, but, what was more serious still, might very possibly cost us
  the life of the patient himself.</p>

  <p>The night I am about to describe was at the end of the fourteenth day
  after our arrival at the castle. Nikola had been on watch from four o'clock
  in the afternoon until eight, when I relieved him.</p>

  <p>"Do not let your eyes wander from him for a minute," he said, as I took my
  place beside the bed. "From certain symptoms I have noticed during the last
  few hours, I am convinced the crisis is close at hand. Should a rise in the
  temperature occur, summon me instantly. I shall be in the laboratory ready at
  a moment's notice to prepare the elixir upon which the success we hope to
  achieve depends."</p>

  <p>"But you are worn out," I said, as I noticed the haggard expression upon
  his face. "Why don't you take some rest?"</p>

  <p>"Rest!" he cried scornfully. "Is it likely that I could rest with such a
  discovery just coming within my grasp? No; you need not fear for me; I shall
  not break down. I have a constitution of iron."</p>

  <p>Having once more warned me to advise him of any change that might occur,
  he left me; and when I had examined my instruments, attended to the
  electrical apparatus, and taken the patient's temperature, I sat down to the
  vigil to which I had by this time become accustomed. Hour by hour I followed
  the customary routine. My watch was early at an end. In twenty minutes it
  would be time for Nikola to relieve me. Leaning over the old man, I convinced
  myself that no change had taken place in his condition; his temperature was
  exactly what it had been throughout the preceding fortnight. I carefully
  wiped the clinical thermometer, and replaced it in its case. As I did so, I
  was startled by hearing a wild shriek in the hall outside. It was a woman's
  voice, and the accent was one of deadly terror. I should have recognised the
  voice anywhere: it was the Dona Consuelo's. What could have happened? Once
  more it rang out, and almost before I knew what I was doing I had rung the
  bell for Nikola, and had rushed from the room into the hall outside. No one
  was to be seen there. I ran in the direction of the corridor which led
  towards the Dona's own quarters, but she was not there! I returned and
  followed that leading towards that terrible room behind the iron gate. The
  passage was in semi-darkness, but there was still sufficient light for me to
  see a body lying upon the floor. As I thought, it was the Dona Consuelo, and
  she had fainted. Picking her up in my arms, I carried her to the hall, where
  the meal of which I was to partake at the end of my watch was already
  prepared. To bathe her forehead was the work of a moment. She revived almost
  immediately.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" she asked faintly. "What has happened?" But before I
  could reply, the recollection of what she had seen returned to her. A look of
  abject terror came into her face.</p>

  <p>"Save me, save me, Dr. Ingleby!" she cried, clinging to my arm like a
  frightened child. "If I see them again, I shall go mad. It will kill me. You
  don't know how frightened I have been."</p>

  <p>I thought I was in a position to understand exactly.</p>

  <p>"Hush!" I answered. "Try to think of something else. You are quite safe
  with me. Nothing shall harm you here."</p>

  <p>She covered her face with her hands, and her slender frame trembled under
  the violence of her emotion. Five minutes had elapsed before she was
  sufficiently recovered to tell me everything. For some days, as I soon
  discovered, she had been left almost entirely alone, and having nothing to
  occupy her mind, had been brooding over her enforced separation from her aged
  relative. The more she thought of him the more became her craving to see him,
  in order to convince herself that no harm had befallen him. A semi-hysterical
  condition must have ensued, for she rose from her bed, dressed herself, and,
  taking a candle in her hand, started in the hope of finding him. By some
  stroke of ill-fortune she must have discovered a passage leading to Ah-Win's
  portion of the castle, and at last found herself standing before the open
  door of that demon-haunted room.</p>

    <p class="caption">She found herself standing before the open door of that

  </div><br>

  <p>"What does it all mean?" she cried piteously "What is this place, and why
  are these dreadful things here?"</p>

  <p>I was about to reply, when the curtain at the end of the hall, covering
  the door of the laboratory, was drawn aside, and to my horrified amazement
  Nikola, who I imagined had taken my place in the patient's room, stood before
  us. As I saw him and realised the significance of the position, a cold sweat
  broke out upon my forehead. What construction would he be likely to place
  upon my presence there? For a few seconds he stood watching us, then an
  expression that I can only describe as being one of terror spread over his
  face.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean?" he cried hoarsely. "What have you done?" Then
  running to the door of the Don's room, he drew back the curtain and entered.
  Leaving the Dona where she was, I followed with such fear in my heart as I
  had never known before. I found Nikola fumbling with the case of the clinical
  thermometer, and trembling like a leaf as he did so. Thrusting it into the
  old man's mouth, he hung over him and waited as if his whole life depended on
  the result. Withdrawing it again and holding it up to the light, he gazed at
  it.</p>

  <p>"Too late!" he cried, and I scarcely recognised his voice, so changed was
  it. "His temperature has dropped a point! Ingleby, this is your doing. For
  all you know to the contrary, you may have killed him."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; LOVE REIGNS</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the preceding chapter I made you acquainted with the
  calamity which befell our patient, and of the serious position in which I
  found myself placed with Nikola in consequence. While knowing in my own heart
  that I was quite innocent of any intentional neglect of duty, I had yet to
  remember that had I remained on watch, instead of leaving the room to
  ascertain what had befallen the Dona Consuelo, it would in all probability
  never have happened. On the other hand, I had signalled Nikola and called him
  to my assistance before abandoning my charge. How it was he had not answered
  my summons was more than I could understand. As it transpired afterwards,
  however, and as is usual in such things, the explanation was a very simple
  one. In the last chapter I said that when he left me to go to the laboratory,
  he was quite exhausted; he had eaten nothing for many hours, and as a natural
  result the fumes of the herbs he was distilling had overpowered him and he
  had fallen in a dead faint upon the floor.</p>

  <p><i>As</i> long as I live I shall retain the recollection of the next
  fourteen hours. During the whole of that time Nikola and I fought death inch
  by inch for the body of the old Don. From midnight until the following
  afternoon, neither of us crossed the threshold of the sick-chamber; and
  during the whole of that time, save to give me brief directions, Nikola spoke
  no word to me at all. It was only when the mercury in the clinical
  thermometer was once more established on its accustomed mark that he
  addressed me. Rearranging the bed-covering and wiping his clammy forehead
  with his pocket-handkerchief, he turned to me.</p>

  <p>"I think he will do now," he said, "provided he does not lose ground
  within the next half-hour, we may take it for granted that he is out of
  danger."</p>

  <p>This was the opportunity for which I was waiting: I accordingly seized
  it.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, Dr. Nikola," I said, mustering courage as I progressed,
  "that you consider me to blame for what has happened." He looked sharply at
  me, and then said coldly:</p>

  <p>"I fail to see how I could very well think otherwise. I left you in
  charge, and you deserted your post."</p>

  <p>"But I assure you," I continued, "that you are misjudging me. I could not
  help myself. I heard the girl scream, and ran to her assistance. At the same
  time I took care to ring the bell for you before I left the room."</p>

  <p>"You should not have left it at all until I had joined you," he answered,
  still in the same icy tone. "As a matter of fact, I did not hear your
  summons; I had fainted. And one other question, What was the girl doing in
  this portion of the castle?"</p>

  <p>"She was hysterical," I answered, "and was searching for her
  great-grandfather. She did not know, herself, how she got here; but, as
  ill-luck would have it, she saw your terrible people, and was frightened
  nearly to death in consequence.</p>

  <p>"For common humanity's sake I could not leave her as she was. Having rung
  for you, I naturally thought you were with the Don, and that I was free to
  render her what assistance I could."</p>

  <p>"Your argument is certainly plausible; but supposing the man had died
  during your absence? How would you have felt then?"</p>

  <p>"I should have regretted it all my life," I answered. "But surely you must
  admit that would have been better than that a young girl should have been
  driven mad by fear."</p>

  <p>"You do not seem to understand," Nikola replied, "that I would willingly
  sacrifice a thousand girls to accomplish the great object I have in view. No!
  no! Ingleby, you have been found wanting in your duty; you have checked the
  progress of the experiment, and if that old man had died"&mdash;here he took
  a step towards me, and his face suddenly became livid with passion&mdash;"as
  I live at this moment you would never have seen the light of day again. I
  swear I would have killed you with as little compunction as I would have
  destroyed a dog who had bitten me."</p>

  <p>So menacing was his attitude, and so fiendish the expression on his face,
  that I instinctively recoiled a step from him, and yet I don't think my worst
  enemy could accuse me of being a coward. Was the man a lunatic? I asked
  myself; had the magnitude of his discovery turned his head? If so, I must be
  careful in my dealings with him.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I do not understand you, Dr. Nikola," I said, trying to
  appear calmer than I felt. "You talk in an exaggerated fashion, and one which
  I cannot permit. I confess to being in a certain measure to blame for what
  has happened; but if you feel that you can no longer repose the trust in me
  that you once felt, I would rather resign my post with you, and leave your
  house at once."</p>

  <p>For a moment I thought I had detected a sign of fear in his face. Then his
  manner changed completely.</p>

  <p>"My dear Ingleby," he said, patting me on the shoulder and speaking in
  quite a different tone, "we are wrangling like a pair of schoolboys. If I
  hurt your feelings just now, I hope you will forgive me and ascribe it to my
  anxiety. For the last two days, as you are aware, I have been overwrought.
  When I stated that I considered you to blame, I said more than I meant; for,
  of course, I know that you had no intention of injuring our patient, or of
  doing anything to prejudice the end we have in view. It was a combination of
  unfortunate circumstances, the ill-effects of which by good luck we have been
  able to remedy. Let us forget all about it."</p>

  <p>"With all my heart," I said, with a momentary friendliness I had never
  felt for him before, and held out my hand to him. He took it, when to my
  surprise I found that his hand was as cold as ice. In this fashion the cloud
  between us appeared to have been blown away; but though it was no longer
  visible to the naked eye, it still existed, for I was unable to dispel from
  my mind the recollection of the threat he had used to me. If he were not in
  earnest now, he had at least been so then; and, for my own part, I put more
  faith in his threats than in his protestations of friendship.</p>

  <p>"Come, come, this will never do," said Nikola, after the few moments'
  silence which had followed after our reconciliation. "It is nearly three
  o'clock. You had better go to your room and rest for a couple of hours, after
  which you can relieve me."</p>

  <p>Seeing his haggard and weary face, I offered to remain on duty while he
  went to lie down, but to this he would not consent. It was plain he was still
  brooding over what had happened, and that he did not intend to trust me any
  further than he was absolutely obliged. Accordingly, I did not press him;
  but, as soon as I had noted the various temperatures, and had done what I
  could to help him, I left him to his vigil and went to my own apartment. I
  had had nineteen hours in the sick-room, and in consequence was completely
  worn out. During that time I had heard nothing of the Dona Consuelo. But when
  I laid my head upon my pillow and closed my eyes, her terrified face, as I
  had seen it the previous night, rose before me. Even then I could feel the
  thrill which had run through me as I took that lovely body in my arms. What
  place was this terrible castle, I asked myself, for such a woman? How dreary
  was the life she was compelled to lead in it; without companions, and cut off
  from the one person who only a week before had been all her world to her.
  This suggested another and a sweeter thought to me. Was there only one person
  she loved? I remembered how she had clung to me in the hall, and how she had
  appealed to me to save her. The mere thought that there might be something
  more than simple liking in her attitude was sufficient to set my heart
  beating like a sledge-hammer. Was it possible I could be falling in love? I,
  who had thought myself done with that sort of thing for ever? I smiled at the
  idea. A nice sort of position I was in to contemplate such a thing. And yet I
  was so lonely in the world that it soothed me to think there might be some
  one to whom I was a little more than the average man, and that that some one
  was a beautiful and noble woman. With these thoughts in my brain I fell
  asleep. A moment later, so it seemed, the electric bell above my head brought
  me wide awake again. One glance at my watch was sufficient, however, to show
  me that I had been asleep two hours. I dressed as quickly as possible and
  returned to the Don's room, when, much to my relief, Nikola informed me that
  there had been no relapse, and that all was progressing as satisfactorily as
  he could wish. Bidding me exercise the greatest vigilance, he left me and
  staggered from the room.</p>

  <p>"A little more of this sort of thing, my friend," I said to myself, as I
  watched him pass out of the door&mdash;"only a little more, and you will be
  unfit for anything."</p>

  <p>But I had yet to learn the strength of Nikola's constitution. He was like
  a steel bow: he might often be bent, but never broken.</p>

  <p>It was not until the following morning that I saw Dona Consuelo again. We
  met upon the battlements as usual.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Ingleby," she said, after we had been standing together some time, "I
  feel there is something I should say to you. I want to tell you how sorry I
  am for what occurred the other night. But for my folly in wandering about the
  castle as I did, I should not have seen"&mdash;she paused for a moment, and a
  shudder swept over her at the recollection. "I should not have seen what I
  did, and you would not have got into trouble with Dr. Nikola."</p>

  <p>"But how did you know that I did get into trouble with Nikola?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Because Dr. Nikola spoke to me about it," she replied.</p>

  <p>On hearing this, I pricked up my ears. Had Nikola taken her to task for
  what she had done?</p>

  <p>In all probability he had blamed her. I tried to catch her on this point,
  but she would tell me nothing.</p>

  <p>"You will accept my apology, won't you?" she asked; "it has made me so
  unhappy."</p>

  <p>"You must not apologise to me at all," I answered; "I assure you none is
  needed. I would have given anything to have prevented your seeing&mdash;well,
  what you did, and still more to have prevented Nikola from speaking to you.
  He had no right to do so." Then, drawing a little closer to her, I took her
  hand: "Dona Consuelo," I said, "I am very much afraid your life here is a
  very unhappy one."</p>

  <p>"I was happier in Spain," she answered. "But I do not want you to think
  that I am grumbling; you have given me your promise that no ill shall befall
  my great-grandfather, and for this reason I have no fear. If he is well, what
  right have I to complain of anything that may happen to myself? Some day
  perhaps Dr. Nikola will allow us to go back to Spain, and then I shall forget
  all about this terrible castle."</p>

  <p>I wondered if the hope she entertained would ever be realised. But I was
  not going to permit her to suppose that I entertained any doubt at all about
  it. I felt I should like to have said more, but prudence restrained me. She
  looked so beautiful that the temptation was almost more than I could
  withstand. Whether she knew anything of what was in my mind, I cannot say;
  but somehow I fancied she must have done so, for, though I have no desire to
  appear conceited, I could not help thinking, when we bade each other goodbye,
  there was a look of sorrow in her face. Once more a fortnight went by. A
  month had now elapsed since our arrival at the castle, and, as I could
  plainly see, Nikola's experiment was at length achieving a definite result.
  The changes effected by the use of the electric batteries and the constant
  anointing which I have already described having ceased within a short time of
  the removal of the means by which they were occasioned, were now almost
  permanent, and were becoming more so every day. The patient's flesh was
  firmer and his skin was more elastic, while his usual pallor had given place
  to what might almost be described as a healthy tint. So far success had
  crowned Nikola's endeavours; but whether the final result would be what he
  desired was more than I could say. After the little <i>contretemps</i> which
  followed my mistake, already described, Nikola and I had agreed fairly well
  together. I was aware, however, that he was suspicious of my intimacy with
  the old Don's great-granddaughter; and from the way in which he glanced at
  the patient and the various instruments whenever he relieved me in the
  sick-room, I could tell that he was always anxious to satisfy himself that I
  had not done anything to prejudice the work he had in hand. It may easily be
  supposed therefore, that our partnership was far from being as pleasant as it
  had promised in London to be. To live in an atmosphere of continual suspicion
  is unpleasant at any time, but it becomes doubly so when another's happiness
  depends in a very large measure upon it. Of course, the reason was apparent
  to me; but there must have been something more in Nikola's mind than I could
  fathom, for I think I can assert most truthfully that never for a moment did
  I allow an effort to be wanting on my part to show how much I had his
  interest at heart. There was yet another thing which puzzled me. It was this:
  what was to happen when the required result had been achieved, and the old
  Don was transformed into a young man again? And more important still, what
  would become of his great-granddaughter? The whole thing seemed so
  absurd&mdash;so unnatural&mdash;if you like it better&mdash;that I could see
  no proper conclusion to it. Still, there was time to talk of that later on.
  The old Don was already, I am prepared to admit, in a certain sense, younger;
  that is to say, he did not present that appearance of great age which had
  been noticeable on board the <i>Dona Mercedes;</i> at the same time, he was
  still very far from being a young man.</p>

  <p>One day I found sufficient courage to speak on this point to Nikola.</p>

  <p>"That is one of the most remarkable points in my argument," he answered.
  "If he were to change his state so quickly, I should despair of success. As
  it is, I am more than hopeful, I am sanguine. To-morrow, if he continues to
  progress so favourably, we shall enter upon the third stage of the
  experiment. Granted that is successful, I shall be within measurable distance
  of the greatest medical discovery of this or any other century."</p>

  <p>Knowing it was useless attempting to question him further, I was compelled
  to possess my soul in patience until the time should arrive for him to
  enlighten me. The following morning, as soon as I had finished my period of
  duty in the Don's chamber, I informed Nikola of my intention of going for a
  short stroll. The time, he had decided, was not ripe yet for the third phase;
  and as I knew that I should be kept closely employed as soon as it was, I was
  anxious to obtain as much exercise as possible while I had the opportunity.
  Accordingly, I placed my hat upon my head and descended to the courtyard.
  Strangely enough it was the first time I had set foot in it since our arrival
  at the castle. It was an exquisite morning for walking, and the sky was blue
  overhead, a brisk breeze was blowing, and when I had crossed the drawbridge
  and looked down into the little bay where the waves rolled in and broke with
  a noise like thunder upon the beach, I felt happier than I had done for some
  considerable time past. I watched the white gulls wheeling above my head, and
  as I did so the recollection of the time when I had last seen them rose
  before my mind's eye. It was the day that I had come so near speaking words
  of love to Dona Consuelo upon the battlements. I remembered the look I had
  seen on her sweet face, and as I did so I realised how much she was to me.
  With a light step and a feeling of elation in my heart, I made my way down
  the path towards the beach. Not a soul was to be seen, for I remembered
  having heard Nikola say that the yacht had gone south for stores. Reaching
  the water's edge, I stood and looked back at the castle. It was a sombre
  enough place in all conscience, and yet there was something about it now
  which affected me in a manner I can scarce describe. I looked at it for a few
  moments, and then, turning my back upon it, I set off along the beach at a
  brisk pace, whistling gaily as I went. Eventually I reached the further side
  of the bay, opposite that on which the castle was situated. Here the sand
  gave place to large rocks, which in their turn terminated in a tall headland.
  The view from these rocks was grand in the extreme. Night and day the rollers
  of the North Sea broke upon them, throwing showers of spray high into the
  air. Clambering up, I struggled for fifty yards or so, and finally seating
  myself upon a rock somewhat larger than the rest, prepared to enjoy the view.
  A surprise was in store for me. Looking back upon the way I had come, I
  caught sight of a figure walking towards me on the sands. Needless to say, it
  was the Dona Consuelo. Whether she was aware of my presence upon the rocks, I
  cannot say; I only know that as soon as I saw her I rose from where I was
  sitting and hastened to meet her. How beautiful she looked, and how her face
  lighted up as I came closer, are things which I must leave to the imagination
  of my reader.</p>

    <p class="caption">A figure walking towards me on the sands.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"You are further abroad than usual to-day, are you not?" I said, as we
  shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Might I not say the same of you?" she answered with a smile. "The morning
  was so beautiful that I could not remain in that terrible old building. Every
  corner seems to suggest unhappy memories to me."</p>

  <p>"Do you really think all the memories connected with it will be
  unpleasant?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>She looked up at me in a little startled way, and blushed divinely as she
  did so.</p>

  <p>"Could you expect me to regard the time I have spent in it with any sort
  of pleasure?" she inquired, fencing with my meaning, and giving me a Roland
  for an Oliver. "Only think what I have suffered in it!"</p>

  <p>By this time we were strolling back together towards the rocks I have
  already described. The beach at this point narrowed considerably, and for
  some reason or another we walked a little nearer the cliff than I had done.
  Suddenly my companion stopped, and, pointing to the sand, said:</p>

  <p>"You had a companion this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I? I had no companion," I answered. "What makes you think so?"</p>

  <p>"Look here," she said, and as she spoke she pointed to some footmarks on
  the sand before us.</p>

  <p><a id="pic14"
     name="pic14"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0200611h-images/DrNikolasExperiment-14.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">"Look here," she said.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"As you went up the beach you walked near the water's edge, and as you
  came to meet me you passed midway between your former tracks and the cliff.
  If you did not have a companion, whose footprints are these? They must have
  been made this morning, for, as you are aware, when the tide is full, it
  comes right up to the cliffs, and would be certain to wash out anything that
  existed before."</p>

  <p>I stooped and examined the tracks carefully before I answered. They were
  evidently those of a man, and from the fact that the sand was hard the
  outline could be plainly distinguished. The foot that was responsible for
  them was a large one, and must have been clad in an exceedingly clumsy
  boot.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to think of it," I said. "One thing, however, is quite
  certain: I had no companion this morning. What about the old man and his wife
  at the castle?"</p>

  <p>"I happen to know that they have both been hard at work all the morning,"
  she answered. "Besides, what object could they have in following you? The
  beach leads nowhere, and from here to yonder point there is no place where
  you can reach the land above."</p>

  <p>I shook my head. The problem was too much for me. At the same time I must
  own it disquieted me strangely. Who was this mysterious person who had dogged
  my footsteps? and what could have been his object in following me? For a
  moment I inclined to the belief that it might have been Dr. Nikola, who was
  anxious to discover how I spent my leisure. But on second thoughts the
  absurdity of the idea became apparent to me. But if it were not Nikola, who
  could it have been?</p>

  <p>On reaching the rocks we seated ourselves, and fell to criticising the
  picture spread out before our gaze. There was something in my companion's
  manner this morning which, analyse it as I would, I could not understand. She
  was by turns light-hearted and sad; the two expressions chased each other
  across her face like clouds across an April sky. At last she returned to the
  topic which I knew must come sooner or later&mdash;that of her
  great-grandfather's condition.</p>

  <p>"I seem cut off from him for ever," she said with infinite sadness. "I
  hear nothing of him from week's end to week's end, and I see nothing of him.
  He is gone completely out of my life."</p>

  <p>"But only for the time being," I answered. "Dr. Nikola has assured you
  that he will restore him to health and strength. Think what that will mean,
  and how happy you will be together then."</p>

  <p>"I know it is very wrong of me to say so," she continued; "but I cannot
  keep it back, Dr. Ingleby&mdash;I distrust Dr. Nikola. He is deceiving me; of
  that I feel sure."</p>

  <p>Knowing what I did, I could not contradict her; but I saw my opportunity,
  and acted upon it.</p>

  <p>"But if you do not trust Dr. Nikola," I said, "am I to suppose that you do
  not trust me?"</p>

  <p>She was silent, and I noticed that she turned her face away from me, as if
  she were anxious to study the castle and the cliff. What was more, I noticed
  that her hand trembled a little as it rested on the rock beside me.</p>

  <p>Once more I put the question, and as I did so, I leant a little towards
  her.</p>

  <p>"I do trust you," she answered, but so softly that I could scarcely hear
  it.</p>

  <p>"Consuelo," I said, in a voice but little louder than that in which she
  had addressed me, "you cannot think what happiness it is to me to hear you
  say that. As I have tried to show you, there is nothing I would not do to
  prove how anxious I am to be worthy of your trust. We have known each other
  but little longer than a month. In that time, however, I have learnt to know
  you as well as any man could know a woman. I have learnt more than that,
  Consuelo; I have learnt to love you better than life itself."</p>

  <p>"No, no," she answered, "you must not say that. I cannot hear you."</p>

  <p>"But it must be said," I answered. "My love will not be denied. You do
  love me, Consuelo; I can see it in your face. Don't you think that I watched
  and longed for it?"</p>

  <p>Instead of turning her face to me, she turned it still further from
  me.</p>

  <p>I took her little hand in mine.</p>

  <p>"What is your answer, Consuelo?" I asked. "Be brave and tell me,
  darling."</p>

  <p>"If I were brave," she said, "I should tell you that what you ask must
  never be. That it is hopeless&mdash;impossible. That it would be madness for
  us to think of such a thing. But I am not brave. I am so lonely in the world,
  and have lost so much that I cannot lose you also."</p>

  <p>"Then you love me!" I cried, in such triumph as I had never felt for
  anything else in my life before. "Thank God, thank God for that!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I love you," she answered; and the great waves breaking on the rocks
  seemed to echo the happiness we both were feeling.</p>

  <p>Over the next half-hour I must draw a veil. By the end of that time it was
  necessary for me to think of returning to the castle. Nikola's watch would be
  up in an hour, and I knew it would not do for me to keep him waiting. I said
  as much to Consuelo, and we immediately rose and set out on our return. As I
  walked beside her, I would not have changed position with any living man, so
  happy was I. My peace of mind, however, was destined to be but short-lived.
  We had crossed the greater number of the rocks, and were approaching the sand
  once more, when I received a shock which I shall not forget as long as I can
  remember anything. Clambering over the sharp and slippery rocks was by no
  means an easy business. It was, however, delightful to hold my sweetheart's
  hand in the pretence of assisting her. Occasionally it became necessary for
  us to make considerable detours, and once I bade her remain where she was
  until I had climbed a somewhat bigger rock than usual in order to find out
  whether we could proceed that way. I had reached the top, and was about to
  extend my hand to her assistance, when something caused me to look behind me.
  Judge of my surprise and consternation at finding, in the hollow below me, a
  man crouching on the sand, watching me.</p>

  <p>It <i>was the Chinaman I had seen on board the Dona Mercedes, the man who
  had thrown the knife which had so nearly terminated Nikola's
  existence.</i></p>

  <p>How I managed to retain my presence of mind at that trying moment, I find
  it difficult now to understand. I only know this, that I realised in a flash
  the fact that it would be madness to pretend to have seen him. Accordingly, I
  stood for a moment looking out to sea, and then with a laugh that must have
  sounded far from natural, I rejoined Consuelo on the rock below and chose
  another path towards the sands.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" she inquired when we had proceeded a short distance.
  "Your face is quite pale."</p>

  <p>"I did not feel very well for a moment," I answered, making use of the
  first excuse that occurred to me.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you are not telling me the truth," she answered. "I feel
  convinced something has frightened you. Can you not trust me?"</p>

  <p>Under the circumstances I thought it would be better for me to make a
  clean breast of it.</p>

  <p>"I will trust you," I answered. "The fact of the matter is, I have
  discovered an explanation for the footsteps you pointed out to me upon the
  beach. We are being followed. When I jumped on the top of that rock, I found
  a man lying on the other side of it."</p>

  <p>"A man? Who could he have been, and why should he be spying upon us? Did
  you recognise him?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly; I should have known him anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Then who was he?"</p>

  <p>"The Chinaman we saw on board the steamer. The man who stole the drugs
  Nikola entrusted to my care."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean the man who entered my cabin and bent over to look at me?"
  she cried in alarm.</p>

  <p>I nodded, and threw a quick glance back over my shoulder to discover
  whether we were still being followed. I could see nothing, however, of the
  man; a circumstance which by no means allayed my anxiety.</p>

  <p>"What do you think we had better do?" inquired Consuelo.</p>

  <p>"Hasten home as fast as we can go, and tell Nikola," I answered. "It is
  imperative he should know at once."</p>

  <p>We accordingly continued our walk at increased speed, every now and then
  throwing apprehensive glances behind us. It is possible some of my readers
  <i>may</i> regard it as an exhibition of cowardice on my part to have sought
  refuge in flight; but when all the circumstances connected with it are taken
  into consideration, I am sure every fair-minded person will acquit me of this
  charge. Had I been alone, it is possible I might have turned and risked an
  encounter with the man; but Consuelo being with me rendered such a course
  impossible. For the first time since we had known it, the grim old castle,
  perched up on the cliffs, seemed a desirable place, and it was with a feeling
  of profound relief that I led my sweetheart across the drawbridge, and was
  able to tell myself that, for the time being at least, she was safe. On
  reaching the hall, I found that I had still twenty minutes to spare. I had no
  desire, however, for further leisure. What I wanted was to see Nikola at
  once, in order to tell him my unpalatable news.</p>

  <p>On entering the room, I found him engaged in taking the old man's
  temperature. He looked up at me as if he were surprised to see me return so
  soon, but said nothing until he had finished the work upon which he was
  engaged.</p>

  <p>"I can see from your face that you have had a fright, and that you have
  something to say to me concerning it," he began, when he had returned the
  thermometer to its case. "Our friend Quong Ma has turned up again, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"How did you know it?" I asked: for I had no idea that he was aware of the
  man's appearance in the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>"I guessed it," he answered, with one of his peculiar smiles. "You are the
  possessor of a most expressive countenance. Consider for a moment, and you
  will understand how it is I am able to arrive at a conclusion so quickly. In
  the first place, you have been for a walk with the young lady whom you love
  and who loves you in return."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you saw me," I replied sharply, feeling myself blushing to the
  roots of my hair.</p>

  <p>"I have not left this room," he answered. "There is a long black hair on
  your collar, which would not have been there if you had spent your liberty by
  yourself. The same thing tells me that you love her, and she loves you. As
  for the other matter, the caretaker and his wife have been busily employed in
  the castle all the morning, while Ah-Win never leaves his own portion of the
  premises. There is only one person outside the walls who could have put that
  expression into your face, and that person is Quong Ma. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right," I replied. "He followed me along the sands, and hid himself
  among the rocks. In recrossing them from the point, I, as nearly as possible,
  jumped on him."</p>

  <p>"I am very glad you did not quite do so," he answered. "Had you
  experienced that misfortune, you would not have been here to tell the tale.
  But enough of him for the present. Take your place here and watch our
  patient. In an hour's time his temperature should have risen two points. When
  it has done so, give him ten drops of this fluid in twenty drops of distilled
  water. A profuse perspiration should result, which will herald the return of
  consciousness and the new life. In twenty-four hours he should not only be
  conscious, but on his way to the commencement of his second youth; in
  forty-eight the improvement should be firmly established; while in a week we
  should have him on his legs, a living, moving, thinking man, and of my own
  creation. Watch him, therefore, and whatever happens do not leave this room.
  Meanwhile, I will have the drawbridge raised, and if Quong Ma can leap the
  chasm, and make his way into the castle, well, all I can say is, he is a
  cleverer man than I take him to be."</p>

  <p>With that, Nikola left me, and I sat down to watch beside the aged Don.
  Apart from my duty towards him, I had plenty to think about, and over and
  over again I found myself recalling the incidents of the morning. Consuelo
  loved me, and happen what might I would prove myself worthy of her love. At
  the end of the hour, as Nikola had predicted, the patient's temperature had
  risen two points. I accordingly measured out the stipulated quantity of the
  medicine he had placed in readiness for me, added the necessary quantity of
  water, and poured it into the old man's mouth. Then I sat myself down to
  wait. Slowly the hands of the clock upon the wall went round, and sixty
  minutes later, just as Nikola had prophesied, small beads of perspiration
  made their appearance upon his forehead. It was an exciting moment, and one
  for which we had been eagerly waiting. I immediately rang the bell for
  Nikola, and upon his arrival informed him of the fact.</p>

  <p>"At last, at last," he whispered. "It is certain now that I have made no
  mistake. From this moment forward his progress should be assured. In a week
  you will be rewarded by a sight such as the eye of man has never yet seen. Be
  faithful to me, Ingleby, and I pledge my word your future with the woman you
  love is assured."</p>

  <p>For the remainder of that day, and, indeed, until eleven o'clock on the
  morning following, there was but little change in the old Don's condition.
  The casual observer would have seen but little difference from the day on
  which I had first taken charge of him on board the steamer. To Nikola and
  myself, however, who had spent so much time with him, and who had noted every
  change, there was a difference so vast that it seemed almost
  incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>My watch next morning was from four o'clock until eight. At eight I
  breakfasted, and afterwards repaired to the battlements above in the hope of
  meeting Consuelo. Since Nikola had ordered the drawbridge to be raised, we
  had been compelled to make this our meeting-place, and, as it happened,
  Consuelo was first at the rendezvous.</p>

  <p>"You have good news for me!" she cried, after I had kissed her. "I can see
  it in your face. What is it? Does it concern my great-grandfather?"</p>

  <p>"It does," I answered. "It concerns him inasmuch as I am able to tell you
  that what Nikola promised you should happen has in reality come to pass.
  Everything has been satisfactory beyond our wildest hopes."</p>

  <p>"And do you mean that all need of anxiety is over?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"I do not mean that exactly," I answered. "But I think it very possible we
  shall soon be able to say so. Nikola is certainly the most wonderful man upon
  this earth."</p>

  <p>What she said in reply it would be vanity on my part to recall, and would
  be only another instance of the folly of lovers' talk. Let it suffice that
  for upwards of an hour our converse was of the sweetest description. Hand in
  hand we sat upon the battlements, looking out across the sunlit sea, and
  building our castles in the air. We were interrupted by Ah-Win, who suddenly
  made his appearance before us and beckoned me to follow him.</p>

  <p><a id="pic15"

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">We were interrupted by Ah-Win.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Bidding Consuelo good-bye, I followed the fellow to the hall, where he
  pointed to the old Don's room and left me. I found Nikola in a state of the
  wildest excitement.</p>

  <p>"I sent for you because the crisis is close at hand," he whispered. "At
  any moment now I may know my fate. Little by little I have built up this
  worn-out frame, strengthening, renewing, revivifying, and now the object of
  my ambition is almost achieved. A thousand years ago the secret was guessed
  by a certain secret sect in Asia. After working a hundred years or more upon
  it they at length perfected it But by the law of their order only one man was
  permitted to derive any benefit from it. I obtained their secret&mdash;how it
  does not matter, added to it what I thought it lacked, and here is the
  result."</p>

  <p>As he spoke a visible tremor ran over the form on the bed before us. The
  excitement was well-nigh unbearable. For the first time in more than thirty
  days, movement was to be detected, the eyelids flickered, the mouth twitched,
  and little by little the eyes opened. Nikola immediately stooped over him,
  and concentrated all his attention upon the pupils. Then, placing his
  fingertips so close that they almost touched the lashes, he drew them away
  again in long transverse passes.</p>

  <p>"Do you know me?" he asked, in a voice that shook with emotion. Almost
  instantly the man replied:</p>

  <p>"I know you."</p>

  <p>"Do you suffer any pain?"</p>

  <p>"I do not."</p>

  <p>"Sleep then, rest and gain strength, and in two days from this hour wake
  again a strong man."</p>

  <p>Once more he placed his hands before the patient's eyes, and as he drew
  them away the lids closed. Nikola bent over him and listened, and when he
  rose he nodded reassuringly to me.</p>

  <p>"It is all right," he said. "His respiration is as even and unbroken as
  that of a sleeping child."</p>

  <p>As usual, my watch that night was from eight o'clock until midnight. From
  the fact that Don Miguel continued to sleep as quietly as at the moment when
  Nikola had hypnotised him, it was neither as difficult nor as anxious as
  before. Nor was I altogether discontented with my lot. I was in love, and was
  loved in my turn; I was engaged in deeply interesting employment, which,
  should the experiment terminate successfully, would in all probability ensure
  my being able to start for a second time in my profession, and with an added
  knowledge that would bring me to the top of the tree at once. The room in
  which I sat was warm and comfortable; outside, however, a violent storm was
  raging. The rain and wind beat against the window in the hall with wildest
  fury. Now, ever since I had watched by the Don's bedside, I had made it my
  habit to carefully lock the door as soon as Nikola had left the room. On this
  particular occasion I had not departed from my custom. The hands of the clock
  on the wall stood at ten minutes past eleven, and I was reflecting that I
  should not be sorry when my watch was over, and I at liberty to retire to
  bed, when to my astonishment I saw the handle of the door slowly turn. At
  first I almost believed that my imagination was playing me a trick; but when
  the handle revolved and was afterwards turned again, I was satisfied that
  this was not the case. Who was the person on the other side? It would not be
  Ah-Win, for the reason that he had been particularly instructed on no account
  ever to touch the door; Consuelo would not venture into that portion of the
  castle again on any consideration whatsoever; while Nikola himself, being
  aware that I always kept it locked, would have knocked before attempting to
  enter. Whoever it was must have been satisfied that the task was a hopeless
  one. At any rate he desisted, and I heard no more of him. A few moments later
  the ventilator required my attention, and I was too busy to bestow any more
  thought upon the matter. Indeed, it was not until Nikola knocked upon the
  door and relieved me that it entered my mind again. It became apparent
  immediately that he attached more importance to the incident than I was
  inclined to do.</p>

  <p>"It's very strange," he said, "but it accounts for one thing which I must
  confess has puzzled me."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"I will show you," he answered, and led the way to the hall. At the
  farther end, near the window, he paused and pointed to a mark upon the floor.
  Not being able to see it very distinctly, I went down upon my hands and
  knees.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what it is?" asked Nikola.</p>

  <p>"I do," I answered. "It is the print of a naked foot."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Nikola, "and that foot was wet. It was more than that." Here
  he took a magnifying glass from his pocket, and also went down upon his hands
  and knees. "The chimney leading from Ah-Win's room," he said, "is almost
  exactly above our heads. In consequence, as you may have noticed, the
  battlements at that point are invariably covered with smuts. The naked foot
  which made this mark brought some of these particles with it, which tells us
  that there was only one way in which the owner could have come, and that was
  down a rope and through the window. Let us examine the window."</p>

  <p>We did so, but, so far as I could see, there was nothing there to reward
  us. The rain was pelting down, and the wind blew as I had never heard it do
  before.</p>

  <p>"The man, whoever he was, was certainly not deficient in pluck," said
  Nikola. "I shouldn't have called to lower myself over the battlements on a
  night like this."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that he did so lower himself?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure," Nikola answered. "How else could he have come? The old
  Don is safe for half an hour at least; get your revolver, I will get mine,
  and we will go upstairs in search of the intruder."</p>

  <p>I did as he directed, but with no great willingness. As you may suppose, I
  was quite convinced as to the identity of the mysterious visitor; and knowing
  his proficiency in the art of knife-throwing, I had not the smallest desire
  to become better acquainted with him. However, I was not going to allow
  Nikola to think I was afraid; so, putting the best face I could upon it, I
  did as he directed, and having assured myself that my weapon was loaded in
  every chamber, followed him along the corridor, up the stone staircase, and
  so out on to the battlements above. Of all the storms in my experience, I
  think that particular one was certainly the worst. The rain beat in our
  faces, and so great was the strength of the wind that the very castle itself
  seemed to shake and tremble before it. Revolver in hand, expecting every
  moment to be confronted by the man of whom we were in search, I followed
  Nikola in the direction of the engine-room chimney. I knew very well for what
  he was looking. He thought he would find a rope there, but in this he was
  disappointed. Nor were we able to discover any traces of human beings. We
  searched the whole length of the battlements in vain, and at last were
  perforce compelled to give up the hunt as hopeless. Returning to the stairway
  once more, we were about to descend, when I saw Nikola stoop and pick
  something up. Whatever it was, he said nothing to me until we had reached the
  light of the corridor below. Then he held it up for me to see. It was a grey
  felt hat, the same that I had seen upon the Chinaman's head that morning.</p>

  <p>"Mark my words," said Nikola, "we shall have trouble with Quong Ma before
  very long."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN we had returned to the corridor below the battlements,
  after our search for the man who had lowered himself down to the window of
  the hall, Nikola brought with him the soft felt hat I had observed upon the
  head of that villainous Chinaman, Quong Ma, that morning. Though neither of
  us was altogether surprised at finding that he was the man we suspected of
  being in the castle, we were none the more pleased at having our suspicions
  confirmed. The thing which puzzled us most, however, was how he had obtained
  admission, seeing that he had not been in sight when I had entered the castle
  that morning, that I had informed Nikola of my meeting with him within five
  minutes of my arrival, and that the drawbridge had been raised, if not at
  once, certainly within a quarter of an hour of my making my report. And yet
  it was plain, since he had been upon the battlements, that he <i>was</i> in
  the castle, and that his being there boded no good was as apparent as his
  presence.</p>

  <p>"I always knew they had original ideas," said Nikola, "but I had no idea
  they were as clever as this. We shall have to be very careful what we do for
  the future; for from what I know of them, they would stick at nothing.
  To-morrow morning we must search the castle from dungeon to turret."</p>

  <p>"And if we find them?"</p>

  <p>"In that case," said Nikola, "I fancy I know a way of dealing with them.
  Dona Consuelo locks her door at night, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>I informed him that I had advised her to do so.</p>

  <p>"It would be better that we should make certain," he answered, and,
  proceeding to the door in question, he softly turned the handle. It was
  securely fastened from the inside.</p>

  <p>"It seems all right," said Nikola. "Now we will return to our own
  quarters, and make everything secure there."</p>

  <p>We did as suggested, and when everything was made fast, securely locked
  the door in the corridor behind us. Reaching the hall once more, we made a
  careful survey of the various rooms, including not only the apartments
  leading out of it, but also the passage leading to Ah-Win's quarters. No
  sign, however, of the man we wanted was to be seen there. Returning to the
  hall, we assured ourselves that our patient was still sleeping quietly, and
  then I bade Nikola good-night, and prepared to go to my room.</p>

  <p>"I should advise you to lock your door," he said, as we parted. "You
  cannot take too many precautions when Quong Ma and his companion are about.
  Should I require your assistance during the night, I will ring for you."</p>

  <p>I promised to answer his call immediately, and was about to turn away,
  when it occurred to me to ask him a question to which he had promised me an
  answer upwards of a month before.</p>

  <p>"On the night that we left Newcastle," I said, "you were kind enough to
  say that when a fitting opportunity occurred you would tell me what has
  induced these men to follow you as they are doing."</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why you should not hear," Nikola replied. "To tell it
  in full, however, would be too long a story, but I will briefly summarise it
  for you. In order to obtain the information necessary for carrying out the
  experiment upon which we are now engaged, I penetrated, as I think I have
  already informed you, into a certain monastery situated in the least known
  portion of Thibet. My companion and I carried our lives in our hands if ever
  men have done so in the history of the world. The better to carry out my
  scheme, I might explain, I impersonated a high official who had lately been
  elected one of the rulers of the order. At a most unfortunate moment the
  fraud was discovered, and my companion and I were ordered to be hurled from
  the roof of the monastery into the precipice below. We managed to escape,
  however, but not before I had secured the precious secret for which I had
  risked so much. The monks traced us on our journey back to civilisation, and
  two of the order, who have had special experience in this sort of work, were
  detailed to follow us, in the hope that they might not only regain possession
  of a book which contained the secret, but at the same time revenge the insult
  which had been offered to them."</p>

  <p>"And you still have that book?"</p>

  <p>"Would you care to see it?" asked Nikola.</p>

  <p>I replied that I should like to immensely, whereupon he retired to his own
  apartment, to presently return bringing with him a small packet, which he
  placed upon the table. Untying the string which bound it, and removing a
  sheet of thin leather, he exposed to my gaze a small book, possibly eight
  inches long by four wide. The materials in which it was bound were almost
  dropping apart with age; the backs and corners, however, were clamped with
  rusty iron. The interior was filled with writing in the Sanskrit character, a
  great deal of which had faded and was barely decipherable. I took it tenderly
  in my hands.</p>

  <p>"And it is to regain possession of this book that these men are following
  you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"To do that," he answered, "and to punish me for the trick I played them.
  They have not, however, accomplished their task yet; nor shall they do so if
  I can help it. Let me once get hold of Quong Ma, and he'll do no more
  mischief for some time to come."</p>

  <p>As Nikola said this, his great cat, which for the past few moments had
  been sitting upon his knees, suddenly stood up, and, placing its forepaws
  upon the table, scratched at the cloth. Nikola was watching my face, and what
  he saw there must have considerably amused him.</p>

  <p>"You are thinking that Apollyon and I are not unlike. When we get out our
  claws, we are dangerous. It would be well for our Chinese friend if he
  understood as much. Now you had better be off to bed, and I to my watch."</p>

  <p>When Nikola relieved me at eight o'clock the morning following, it was
  plain that there was something important toward.</p>

  <p>"Get your breakfast as soon as you can," he said, "and when you have done
  we will search the castle. You heard nothing suspicious during your watch, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," I replied. "Everything has gone on just as usual."</p>

  <p>As soon as I had finished my breakfast, Ah-Win was summoned, and together
  we set off on our errand. Beginning with the battlements, we took the castle
  corridor by corridor, floor by floor, examining every corner and staircase in
  which it would be possible for a human being to hide himself. Having
  exhausted the inhabited portion of the building, we searched the rooms into
  which no one had penetrated from year's end to year's end. These we also drew
  blank. Then descending another flight of stairs, we reached the basement,
  explored the great kitchens, once so busy, and now tenanted only by rats and
  beetles, and examined the various domestic offices, including the buttery and
  armoury, still without success. If Quong Ma was in the castle, it looked as
  if he must certainly possess the power of rendering himself invisible at
  will. At last we reached the keep, where the old couple who, as Nikola had
  said, officiated as caretakers during his absence, had their quarters. At the
  moment of our arrival the woman was bitterly upbraiding her husband for some
  misdeed.</p>

  <p>"I tell 'ee," she was saying, slapping the table with her hand to
  emphasise her words, "that when I went to bed last night they vittals was in
  yonder cupboard. What I want 'ee to say is where they be now? Don't 'ee say
  'ee never saw them, or that it was the cat as stole 'em, for 'ee may talk
  till 'ee be black in the face and I'll not believe 'ee. Cats don't turn
  handles and undo latches, and mutton don't walk out of the front door on its
  own leg. If 'ee be a man, 'ee'll tell the truth an' shame the devil."</p>

  <p>I must leave you to picture for yourself the vehemence with which all this
  was said. The words poured from her mouth in a torrent, and every sentence
  was punctuated with slaps upon the table. So engaged were they in their
  quarrel that some moments elapsed before they perceived Nikola and myself
  standing in the doorway. When they did, the tumult ceased as if by magic.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be enjoying yourselves," said Nikola drily; "perhaps you will
  be kind enough to tell me what it is all about."</p>

  <p>He had no sooner finished than the irate old lady recommenced.</p>

  <p>"It's just this way, my lord," she said, though why she should have
  bestowed a title upon Nikola I could not understand. "Last night I was
  troubled with the rheumatiz mortal bad, and went to bed early. My old man
  there, beggin' your pardon for the liberty I'm takin', was a-sittin' by the
  fire smokin' his pipe, such bein' his custom of an evening. He had had his
  supper, and as I se'd with my own eyes when he'd a finished there was the end
  of a leg of mutton in yon cupboard. When I comes this mornin' to take it out
  for breakfast, <i>it's</i> gone, and with it the bread as I baked with my own
  hands but yesterday. And he stands there, savin' your presence, my lord, and
  wants I for to believe as how he's not touched it, and the latch of the
  cupboard down, as you can see for yourselves, honourable gentlemen both, with
  your own eyes. I've been married these three-and-forty years, and I don't
  know as how you will believe it, my lord&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Seeing that she was getting up steam once more, Nikola held up his hand to
  her to be silent.</p>

  <p>"What you tell me is very interesting," he said, fixing his dark eyes upon
  her; "but let me understand you properly. You say you went to bed leaving
  your husband smoking his pipe in this room. Before retiring you convinced
  yourself that the food which is now not forthcoming was in the cupboard. Is
  that so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord, and honourable gentlemen both."</p>

  <p>Then, addressing her husband, Nikola continued:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you went to sleep over your pipe?" The question had to be
  repeated, and his wife had to admonish him with, "Speak up to his lordship
  like a man," before he could answer. Even then his reply was scarcely
  satisfactory; he thought he might have fallen asleep, but he was not at all
  sure upon the point. He admitted he was in the habit of doing so; and, as far
  as Nikola was concerned, this settled the matter.</p>

  <p>"Quong Ma," he said, turning to me. "Now I understand where he gets his
  food from." Then, turning to the woman, he said, "Your husband is a heavy
  sleeper, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Why, bless you, sir," she replied, "he sleeps that heavy you can't wake
  him. And, as for snoring, why, the rattling of that old bridge out yonder,
  when they're a-drawin' of it up, ain't to be compared with him, as the sayin'
  is. I did hear of a man, when I lived down Sunderland, as did snore so that,
  when he woke up, the folks next door sent in to ask him to go on again, the
  stillness bein' that lonesome that they couldn't bear it."</p>

  <p>Nikola peremptorily bade the old woman be silent, and ordered her for the
  future to see that her door was locked at dusk every evening. Then,
  addressing her husband, he inquired if the latter was conversant with the
  subterranean passages of the castle, and when he had replied in the
  affirmative, bade him light a lantern, and show us all he could. The man did
  so, and having conducted us across the courtyard, entered a long, low
  chamber, which might once have been used as a bakehouse. In this was a large
  wooden door, secured with many bolts, but now falling into considerable
  disrepair. These bolts he drew one by one with an air of importance that was
  indescribably comic.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand how these bolts come to be fastened if the man
  is down below," said Nikola, addressing me. I shook my head, whereupon he
  bade the old man inform him whether there were any other entrances to the
  vaults in question.</p>

  <p>"Lor', sir," the man replied, "the castle be fair mazed with them. If 'ee
  likes, I can take 'ee into most any room in the place from down below."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought of that," said Nikola, more to himself than to me.
  "I am sorry I didn't question our friend here before. Quong Ma has evidently
  mastered the situation, and is playing a game of hide-and-seek. However,
  we'll examine the dungeons first, and the passages afterwards. So lead the
  way, my friend."</p>

  <p>The old man going ahead carrying the lantern, Nikola following, and Ah-Win
  and myself bringing up the rear, we made our way down the clammy stone
  staircase into the subterranean portion of the castle. It was an experience
  that would have been worth anything to a novelist seeking colour for a
  historical tale; but knowing what I did about the man we were after, I cannot
  say that I appreciated the incident so much. In addition to my nervousness,
  my head was aching, while hot and cold perspirations alternately contributed
  to my general discomfort. What was the matter with me I could not think. As
  it was, I was the only member <b>of</b> the party, I believe, who felt any
  symptoms of fright. The old man with the lantern knew nothing of his danger.
  Ah-Win was an Asiatic and a fatalist, and in his master's presence appeared
  not to care whom or what he faced; while, as for Nikola himself, I believe
  most implicitly that cold-blooded individual would have faced certain death
  as coolly and contentedly as he would have tossed off a glass of wine. Lower
  and lower we descended, glancing into dungeons into which no light of day had
  ever penetrated, and stooping to make our way along passages in which the
  moisture from the roof fell drip, drip, drip, upon our heads. Search as we
  would, however, we could discover no trace of that villainous Celestial.</p>

  <p>"We be close down alongside the sea now, your lordship," said the old man,
  "and when I tells 'ee that, I tells 'ee summat as not many folks as has bided
  in this 'ere castle ever knowed."</p>

  <p>"Most admirable of men," said Nikola, "you are telling me exactly what I
  want to know. Do you mean that it's possible for us to reach the sea from
  where we are now standing without crossing the drawbridge?"</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I <i>do</i> mean, my lord," he answered. "And if
  your lordship and the honourable gentleman will come wi' I, I'll let 'ee see
  for your own selves."</p>

  <p>Forthwith the old fellow, holding his lantern aloft, turned down a narrow
  passage, leading to the right, and a few minutes later brought us up to some
  steps, at the bottom of which the light of day could be plainly seen. To
  reach the bottom of the steps was the work of a moment, and once there a
  curious scene was revealed to us. The doorway opened into the chasm which I
  have described earlier, and was situated almost directly beneath the
  drawbridge and the keep. Kneeling down, Nikola and I looked over the edge and
  could plainly see a number of iron steps let into the rock one above the
  other. At the bottom&mdash;for it was now full tide&mdash;the sea washed and
  dashed with terrific force. Rising to his feet again, Nikola addressed the
  old man.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible at low tide," he said, "to reach the sands from here?"</p>

  <p>"Lor' bless you, yes, sir," the man replied. "When the tide is down, 'ee
  can get along from rock to rock without as much as wetting shoe leather."</p>

  <p>"That accounts for everything," said Nikola with considerable
  satisfaction. "I understand exactly how Quong Ma got into the castle now; he
  must have laughed to himself when he saw that we had raised the drawbridge in
  the hope of keeping him out. However, forewarned is forearmed, and this place
  shall be bricked up this morning. You, my old friend, had better see to it,
  and be sure that you make a good job of it'"</p>

  <p>The man promised to do so, and seeing that there was nothing further to be
  gained by remaining where we were, Nikola bade him conduct us back again to
  our own portion of the building by a secret passage if possible. The man
  assured us that he could do so, and was as good as his word. We climbed,
  crawled, and scrambled our way up the narrow steps and along a rabbit warren
  of a small passage behind our guide. At last he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Would your lordship be kind enough to say where 'ee think 'ee are now?"
  he added.</p>

  <p>"I have not the least notion," said Nikola.</p>

  <p>"Nor I," I added.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I will show 'ee," said the man, and after a little hunting he
  found and pressed something in the wall. There was a grating noise, a sound
  as of rusty hinges being slowly unfolded and then a portion of the wall swung
  outward and we found ourselves standing at the top of the great staircase
  within a few yards of Consuelo's apartments.</p>

  <p>"This is uncanny, to say the least of it," remarked Nikola. "Pray do any
  of these interesting passages open into the young lady's room opposite, or
  into the smaller hall occupied by this gentleman and myself?"</p>

  <p>"Not now, my lord," the man replied. "Time was when they did, but the old
  lord didn't take kindly to 'em, and they was bricked up as much as five year
  ago."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," said Nikola; and you may imagine that I echoed the
  sentiment. Nikola thereupon thanked the old man and dismissed him, at the
  same time reiterating his order that the opening in the chasm below the
  drawbridge should be made secure.</p>

  <p>The excitement of the search for Quong Ma and the damp of the passages had
  been too much for me, and by the time we reached the hall I could scarcely
  stand.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, Ingleby," said Nikola, as I dropped into a chair, "you're
  looking awfully ill. What is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"I can't exactly say," I answered. "I fear I must have caught a chill on
  the battlements last night."</p>

  <p>"And yet you accompanied me down to those damp passages this morning. Was
  that wise?"</p>

  <p>"I was not going to let you go alone," I replied.</p>

  <p>He glanced sharply at me, as if he would read my thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, I'll tell you what you must do: you must be off to bed at
  once. There can be no doubt about that."</p>

  <p>I tried to protest: I explained my desire to see the end of the
  experiment; but Nikola was adamant. To bed I must go, willy-nilly; and to bed
  I accordingly went, but not in my own room off the hall. An apartment farther
  down the corridor, next door to that occupied by Consuelo, was arranged for
  me; and when I was safely between the blankets, Nikola prescribed for me, and
  my sweetheart was duly installed as nurse. My indisposition must have been
  more severe than I had supposed, for before nightfall I was in a high state
  of fever, and by midnight was delirious.</p>

  <p>I remember nothing further until I opened my eyes and found Consuelo
  sitting by my side.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean?" I inquired, surprised to find her there.</p>

  <p>"It means that you have been very ill," she answered, "and that I am your
  nurse, and am not going to permit you to talk very much."</p>

  <p>To do this was a feat of which I was incapable, but I was not going to be
  silent until I had learnt something of what had happened.</p>

  <p>"How long have I been ill?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"More than a week," she answered; and then added, "You naughty boy, you
  little know what a fright you have given me. But you must not talk any more,
  or Dr. Nikola will be angry."</p>

  <p>She poured out some medicine for me, bade me drink it, and then reseated
  herself beside me. In five minutes I was wrapped in a heavy slumber, from
  which I did not wake for several hours. When I did, I found Dr. Nikola
  installed as nurse; Consuelo had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Well, Ingleby," said Nikola cheerily, as he felt my pulse, "you have had
  a sharp bout of it, but I am glad to see we have managed to pull you through.
  How do you feel in yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Much better," I answered, "though still a bit shaky."</p>

  <p>"I don't wonder at it," he said. "Do you feel hungry?"</p>

  <p>"I feel as if I could eat anything," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's a good sign. I'll see that something is sent you. In the
  meanwhile keep as quiet as possible. When I leave you, I'll send your
  sweetheart to you; she has been a devoted nurse, and between ourselves I
  rather fancy you owe your life to her."</p>

  <p>"God bless her!" I answered fervently. "But you call her my sweetheart.
  What do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I know everything. One night the young lady in question
  was rather concerned about you, and in her agitation she allowed the cat to
  slip out of the bag. You young people seem to have managed the matter pretty
  well in the short time you have known each other. Now keep quiet for a few
  moments while I see if I can find her."</p>

  <p>He was making for the door, when I stopped him.</p>

  <p>"You have not told me how the Don is," I said. "How does the experiment
  progress?"</p>

  <p>His face clouded over.</p>

  <p>"It has proved successful," he answered, but with a sudden sternness that
  surprised me. It was for all the world as if he were trying to convince me
  that what he said was correct, although in his own heart he knew it was not
  so. When he spoke again, it was very slowly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Ingleby," he said, as if he were weighing every word before he
  uttered it, "the experiment has proved a success. I have made the Don a young
  man, but&mdash;well, to tell the truth, I have made a mistake in my
  calculations&mdash;a mistake that I cannot explain and that I can in no way
  account for."</p>

  <p>"And the result?"</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me," he said, "for I am afraid I do not know myself. By the
  time you are on your feet again, I shall hope to have come nearer an
  understanding of the situation. Then I shall be able to tell you more of what
  I hope and fear. At present I scarcely like to think of it myself."</p>

  <p>To my surprise, as I watched him, I saw great beads of perspiration start
  out upon his forehead, and, for the first time since I had known him, I saw a
  look of terror in Dr. Nikola's face. I tried to question him further upon the
  subject, but he bade me wait until I was stronger, and, presently repeating
  that he would find Consuelo, he left me. When my sweetheart entered the room,
  looking more beautiful than I had ever seen her, I forgot, for the time
  being, about Nikola.</p>

  <p>"You are looking much better," she said, as she came toward me and put
  down upon the table the tray she carried in her hand. "Here is some beef-tea
  which I have made for you myself. If you don't drink it <i>all</i> up, I
  shall let the old woman in the kitchen make it for you in the future and
  bring it to you herself."</p>

  <p>"You had better not," I answered. "In that case, I should refuse to touch
  a drop of it, and should die of slow starvation in consequence."</p>

  <p>With a gentleness that was infinitely becoming to her, she lifted my head
  and held the cup while I drank. If I took longer over it than I should have
  done at any other time, the fact must, of course, be attributed to my
  weakness.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Nikola says he is very pleased with the progress you have made," she
  said, when she had replaced the cup upon the table. "But you are to be kept
  very quiet for some days, and to sleep as much as possible."</p>

  <p>"And when am I to get up?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Get up!" she cried in mock horror. "You must not even think of such a
  thing for a week at least."</p>

  <p>"A week!" I replied. "Do you think I've to stay here for a week?"</p>

  <p>"So Dr. Nikola says."</p>

  <p>The remainder of our conversation is too sacred to be set down in
  cold-drawn type. Let it suffice that, when I fell asleep again, it was with
  her hand in mine. I was more in love even than I had been before.</p>

  <p>As Consuelo had predicted, more than a week had elapsed before I was
  permitted to leave my room. Even then I was not allowed to return to my
  duties at once, but spent the greater portion of my time with Consuelo on the
  battlements gaining strength with every breath of sea air that I inhaled.</p>

  <p>Nikola I saw but little of. He examined me every morning, and on one or
  two occasions honoured us with his company for a brief period on the castle
  roof. At the best of times, however, he was not a good companion. He was
  invariably absorbed in his own thoughts, spoke but little, and struck me as
  being anxious to say goodbye almost as soon as he arrived. Since then I have
  learned the true reason of it all, and I have been able to see that complex
  character in a new light. It never struck me how lonely the man's life must
  be. During the whole time that I was associated with him I never once heard
  him speak of kith or kin. Friends he appeared to have none, while his
  acquaintances numbered only such men as were necessary to the particular work
  he happened to be engaged in at the moment of their meeting. His very
  attainments, his peculiar knowledge of the world, of its under and mystic
  side, were sufficient to make him hold aloof from his fellow-men. In all
  matters of comfort a rigid ascetic, the good things of life had no temptation
  for him. To sum it all up, of this I feel certain, so certain indeed that at
  times it becomes almost a pain, that Nikola, with all his sternness, his
  self-denial, his genius and his failings, hungered for one thing, and that
  was to be loved. Why should I say this, considering that the only evidence I
  have to offer tends to lead one's thoughts in a contrary direction? I do not
  know, but as I remarked just now, I feel convinced that my hypothesis is a
  correct one, as I am that I love Consuelo. But to return to my story. It was
  not until nearly a fortnight had elapsed, since my return to consciousness,
  that I was permitted to take up my duties again. When I did, I returned to my
  old quarters leading out of the hall, and I think Nikola was pleased to once
  more have my co-operation,&mdash;at any rate, he led me to suppose that he
  was.</p>

  <p>"When you think you are up to the mark, I shall be pleased to show you the
  Don," he said, "and to hear your opinion of him."</p>

  <p>I expressed myself as being quite equal to seeing him at once.</p>

  <p>"Very good," he answered, "but I warn you to be prepared for a great and
  somewhat unpleasant change in the man."</p>

  <p>So saying, he led me across the hall towards the room in which I had,
  before my illness, spent so many hours. Inserting the key in the lock, he
  turned it and we entered. I had expected to find it exactly as I had last
  seen it. A surprise, however, was in store for me. The bedplace in the centre
  was gone, as were both the electrical appliances. The clock and thermometers
  had been removed, the only things that still remained being the electric
  lights which were suspended from the ceiling and the enclosed fixtures for
  regulating the supply of hot and cold air. In point of fact, it was as bare a
  room as well could be imagined.</p>

  <p>"Don Miguel," said Nikola, "I have brought an old friend to see you."</p>

  <p>I looked about the room, but for a moment could see nothing of the old man
  in question. Then my eye lighted on what looked like a heap of clothes
  huddled up on a mattress in the corner. On hearing Nikola's voice, a face
  looked up at me&mdash;a face so terrible, so demoniacal I might say, that I
  involuntarily shrank from it. What there was about it that caused me such
  revulsion, I cannot say. It was the countenance of a young man, if you can
  imagine a man endowed with perpetual youth, and with that youth the cunning,
  the cruelty, and the vice of countless centuries.</p>

  <p>"Steady, my friend," I heard Nikola say, and as he did so he placed his
  hand upon my arm. "Remember, Ingleby, this is nothing more than an
  experiment."</p>

  <p>Then addressing the crouching figure, he bade him stand up. With a snarl
  like that of a dog, or rather of a wild beast, who is compelled to do a thing
  very much against his will, the man obeyed. I was able then to take better
  stock of him. Accustomed as I was to the old Don's face, I found it difficult
  to realise that the healthy, vigorous man standing before me was he, and yet
  I had only to look at him carefully to have all doubt upon the subject
  removed. He was the same and yet not the same. At any rate, he was an
  illustration of the marvellous, nay, the almost unbelievable, success of
  Nikola's experiment.</p>

  <p>"You remember the Don as he was, and you can see to what I have been able
  to bring him," said Nikola sadly, and for one moment without a trace of
  triumph. This, however, was soon forthcoming.</p>

  <p>"Out of an old man tottering on the brink of the grave, I have
  manufactured a young and vigorous creature such as you now see before you. I
  have made him, I have transformed him, I have subjected Nature to science, I
  have revolutionised the world, abolished death, and upset the teachings, and
  the essential idea, of all religions. I have proved that old age can be
  prevented, and the grave defied. And&mdash;<i>and&mdash;I have
  failed."</i></p>

  <p>Under the intensity of his emotion his voice broke, and something very
  like a sob burst from him. Never since I had known Nikola had I seen him as
  he was then. To all appearances he was well-nigh broken-hearted.</p>

  <p>"If you have done all this," I asked, "how can you say that you have
  failed?"</p>

  <p>"Are you so blind that you cannot see?" he answered. "Examine the man for
  yourself, and you will find that he is a human being in animal life only. I
  have given him back his youth, his strength, his enjoyment in living, but I
  cannot give him back his mind. In his body I have triumphed; in his brain I
  have completely failed."</p>

  <p>"But cannot this be set right?" I inquired. "Is the case quite
  hopeless?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing is hopeless," he answered; "but it will take years, centuries
  perhaps, of work to find the secret. I thought, when I built up the body, I
  should be building up the brain as well. It was not so. In proportion as his
  body renewed its youth, his brain shrunk. Let me give you an
  illustration."</p>

  <p>He went forward towards the man, who was now once more crouching upon the
  floor, watching us over his right shoulder, as if he were afraid we were
  going to do him harm.</p>

  <p>"Well, Miguel," said Nikola, patting him upon the head, and speaking to
  him in the same tone he would have used to a favourite monkey, "how is it
  with you to-day?"</p>

  <p>The man, however, took no notice, but bending down played with the lace of
  Nikola's shoe, now and again looking swiftly up into his face, as if he
  dreaded a blow, and as swiftly looking away again.</p>

  <p>"This should prove to you what I mean," said Nikola, addressing me. "In
  his present condition he is less than a man, and yet where would you find a
  finer frame? His heart, his lungs, his constitution, all are perfect."</p>

  <p>While he had been speaking, he had turned his back upon the beast upon the
  floor, and as he uttered the last words he moved towards me. He had not taken
  a step, however, before the Don was half on his feet. From childish idiocy
  his expression had changed until it was a fiendish malignity that surpasses
  all description in words.</p>

  <p>In another moment he would have thrown himself on Nikola. As it was, he
  glared at him until he turned, when in an instant the wild expression had
  gone, and he was crouching upon the floor once more, picking at his fingers
  and smiling to himself.</p>

  <p>"You can see for yourself what he is," said Nikola: "an imbecile; but for
  one ray of hope I should despair of him."</p>

  <p>"There is, then, a ray of hope," I said eagerly, clutching like a drowning
  man at the straw he held out. "Thank God for that!"</p>

  <p>"There is a ray," he answered, "but it is a very little one. I will give
  you an example."</p>

  <p>Turning to the wretched creature on the floor, he extended his hand
  towards him, and, gradually lifting it, bade him rise. The effect was
  instantaneous. The man rose little by little until he stood upright Once more
  pointing his hand directly at him, Nikola moved towards him, until the points
  of his fingers were scarcely an inch from the other's eyes. Then, slowly
  raising his fingers, he made an upward and a downward pass.</p>

  <p>The eyes closed, and yet the man still remained rigid against the wall.
  Turning to me, Nikola said:</p>

  <p>"You can see for yourself that he is absolutely under my influence and
  control."</p>

  <p>I approached and made a careful examination. There could be no doubt about
  his condition: it was one of hypnotic coma; and, on raising one of the
  eyelids, I found the ball turned upwards and wandering in its orbit.</p>

  <p>"You are satisfied?" inquired Nikola.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," I answered.</p>

  <p>"In that case let us proceed."</p>

  <p>"To whom am I speaking?" asked Nikola, addressing the man before him.</p>

  <p>"To Miguel de Moreno," was the answer, given in a perfectly clear and
  strong voice, and without apparent hesitation. "Do you know where you
  are?"</p>

  <p>"I am with Dr. Nikola."</p>

  <p>"Before you came to me, with whom and where did you live?"</p>

  <p>"I lived with my great-granddaughter in Cadiz."</p>

  <p>"Have you any recollection of coming to England?"</p>

  <p>"I remember it perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Now lie down upon that mattress, and sleep without waking until eight
  o'clock to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>The man did as he was ordered without hesitation. Nikola covered him with
  the blankets, and as soon as we had made sure of his safety, we left the
  room, carefully locking the door after us.</p>

  <p>"You can have no idea, Ingleby, what a disappointment this has been to me.
  Three times before I have tried and failed, but this time I made sure I had
  success within my grasp. I have progressed farther now than I have ever done
  before, it is true; but it is the brain that has beaten me. As long as I live
  I will persevere, and the perfect man, who shall retain his youth through all
  ages, shall eventually walk the earth. Now good-night."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand to me, and as I shook it Apollyon came up, and rubbed
  himself against my leg, as if to show that he too appreciated my sympathy. I
  was about to retire to my room, when it struck me that I had heard nothing of
  our friend Quong Ma since we had searched the subterranean portion of the
  castle for him. I asked Nikola if he had anything to tell me concerning
  him.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he answered, "save that last night I felt certain that I saw a
  man cross the courtyard. It was just before midnight, the moon was about the
  building, and I am ready to stake anything that I am not deceived."</p>

  <p>"But who could it have been?"</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I want to know," he answered. "You were safe in bed
  and asleep. It was not the caretaker, for I tried his door and found it
  locked, and from the sound that greeted me I had good proof it was not
  he."</p>

  <p>"But might it not have been Ah-Win?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I thought so, and before going in search of the figure I hastened to his
  room, only to find him also asleep."</p>

  <p>"In that case it must have been Quong Ma. But how does the fellow live?
  and why does he not strike?"</p>

  <p>"Because he has not yet found his opportunity. When he does, you may be
  sure he will avail himself of it. Now once more good-night You need not
  trouble about our patient; I shall take a look at him about midnight."</p>

  <p>"Good-night," I said, and went to my room, the door of which I carefully
  locked. My last waking thoughts were of Consuelo, and my speculations as to
  what her feelings would be when she realised the terrible change that had
  taken place in her great-grandfather were sufficient to give me a nightmare.
  Over and over again I was afflicted with the most horrible dreams; and when I
  was roused by a loud thumping on my door, and Nikola's voice calling for
  admittance, it seemed so much part and parcel of the horror my brain had just
  pictured for me, that for the moment I took no notice of it. It sounded
  again; so, springing from my bed, I ran to the door, and opened it.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" I asked, when he was standing before me. His usual
  pale face was now ghastly in its whiteness.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, man!" he cried, "you have no notion of what has happened.
  Dress yourself immediately and come with me!" He sat upon my bed while I
  huddled my clothes on; then, when I was ready, he seized me by the wrist, and
  half-dragged me, half-led me into the hall. Once there, he pointed to the
  figure of a man stretched out before his door. <i>It was Ah-Win; and his
  throat was cut from ear to ear!</i></p>

  <p>The sight was so sudden, and so totally unexpected, that it was almost too
  much for me. Recovering my presence of mind, however, I knelt down and
  examined him.</p>

  <p>"Look at his hands!" said Nikola. "They are cut to the bone by some
  sharp-bladed instrument. The murderer must have come here in search of me.
  Ah-Win must have met him, tried to prevent him reaching the door, was unable
  to warn us, and so have met his fate."</p>

  <p>We were both too much overcome to continue the discussion. <i>Quong Ma had
  struck at last!</i></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; WAR AND PEACE</h2>

  <p class="first">AT the conclusion of the preceding chapter, I described to
  you the terrible discovery we had made of the death of Ah-Win. That he had
  met his fate in an endeavour to prevent Quong Ma from reaching his master's
  room seemed quite in accordance with the evidence before us. Small wonder was
  it, therefore, that Nikola was affected. But even in his grief he proved
  himself unlike the average man. Another man would have bewailed his loss, or
  at least have expressed some sorrow at his servant's unhappy lot. Nikola,
  however, did neither, and yet his grief was plain to the eye as if he had
  wept copious tears. Having satisfied himself that the poor fellow really was
  dead, he bade me help him carry the body down the passage to an empty room
  which adjoined his former quarters.</p>

  <p>We laid it upon a bed there, and Nikola followed me into the passage,
  carefully locking the door behind him. When we were back in the hall once
  more, Nikola spoke.</p>

  <p>"This has gone far enough," he said. "Come what may, we must find Quong
  Ma. The fellow must be in the castle at this minute."</p>

  <p>"Shall we organise a search for him?" I said. "The man must be captured at
  any hazard; we are risking valuable lives by allowing him to remain at
  large."</p>

  <p>Though I used the plural, I must confess I was thinking more of my darling
  than of anybody else. How did I know that, when Quong Ma found it impossible
  for him to get hold of Nikola, he would not revenge himself upon
  Consuelo?</p>

  <p>"That we must find him goes without saying," Nikola replied. "I doubt very
  much, however, if it would be prudent for you to take part in the search. In
  the first place, you are still as weak as a baby; and in the second, the damp
  of the subterranean passages might very easily bring on a return of the
  fever."</p>

  <p>"You surely do not imagine that I should permit you to go alone," I
  said.</p>

  <p>Nikola gave a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"I do not want to appear boastful," he said, "but I am very much afraid
  you do not know me yet, my dear Ingleby. However, I will confess that if you
  really do desire it, and feel equal to the exertion, I shall be very glad of
  your company."</p>

  <p>"When do you propose to start?"</p>

  <p>"At once," he answered. "I shall not know a minute's peace until I have
  revenged Ah-Win."</p>

  <p>"And supposing we catch the fellow, what do you propose to do with him? It
  is a long way from here to the nearest police station."</p>

  <p>"I don't fancy somehow I shall trouble the police," he said. "But we will
  talk of what we will do with him when we have got him. Now, if you are ready,
  come along."</p>

  <p>Thereupon, for the second time we searched the castle for Quong Ma. As
  before, we first visited the battlements and the rooms on the next floor, the
  basement offices followed, and still being unsuccessful, we unbolted the door
  leading to the dungeons and entered the subterranean portion of the building.
  Cool as I endeavoured to appear, I am prepared to confess that, when the icy
  wind came up to greet us from those dark and dreary passages, I was far from
  feeling comfortable. I don't set up to be a braver man than my fellows, but
  it seemed to me to require more pluck to enter those dismal regions than to
  take part in a forlorn hope. With our revolvers in our hands, and Nikola
  holding the lantern above his head, we explored passage after passage and
  dungeon after dungeon. Rats scuttled away from beneath our feet, bats flew in
  the darkness above our heads; but, as before, not a sign of Quong Ma.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand it," said Nikola at last, and his voice echoed along
  the rocky passages. "We have explored every room in the castle and every
  dungeon underneath it, and not a trace of the man can we discover. We have
  bricked up the opening into the chasm, and lifted the drawbridge that
  connects us with the outside world, and yet we cannot catch him. He must be
  here somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Exactly; but where?"</p>

  <p>"If I knew, do you think I should be standing here?" Nikola replied
  sharply. "But let us try back again. I want to explore that secret passage
  the old man showed us the other day. I remember now that there was something
  that struck me as being rather peculiar about it."</p>

  <p>We accordingly retraced our steps, found the passage in question, and
  ascended it. Reaching the point where, on the previous occasion, we had
  turned off to find the trap-door, opening at the head on the great staircase,
  we found, as Nikola had supposed, a second and smaller turning half hidden in
  shadow and which bore away to the right, that is to say in the direction of
  the keep. Fortunately, it was now level going, but so narrow was the passage
  that it was still impossible to walk two abreast.</p>

  <p>"Hark! what was that?" Nikola suddenly cried, stopping and holding the
  lantern above his head.</p>

  <p>We stopped and listened, and sure enough a shuffling noise came from the
  passage in front. A moment later the same sound we had heard when the old
  caretaker had opened the secret door reached us.</p>

  <p>"If I am not mistaken, we have found his lair at last," my companion
  shouted and ran forward.</p>

  <p>But certain as we felt that it was Quong Ma we had heard, we were too late
  to convince ourselves of the fact. The secret door stood open; the man,
  however, was not to be seen in the passage outside.</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" I asked, for I was not familiar with the corridor in which
  we found ourselves.</p>

  <p>"Between the keep and Ah-Win's quarters," Nikola replied. "Now I
  understand how that fiend has found his way into the hall. But let me think
  for a moment: there is the gate between us and the hall, and I have the key
  in my pocket. There is no other exit in either direction, so it seems to me
  that we have got our man at last. Is your revolver ready?"</p>

  <p>"Quite ready," I replied.</p>

  <p>"Come along, then. But remember this: if he attacks you, show him no
  mercy. He'll show you none. Remember Ah-Win."</p>

  <p>With that we made our way along the corridor in the direction of the room
  where Nikola's&mdash;well, where the murdered man had been quartered.</p>

  <p>Nikola unlocked the door and looked in, while I remained in the passage
  outside. I really believe I was more afraid of what I should see in there
  than of Quong Ma himself.</p>

  <p>"He is not there," said Nikola when he rejoined me, and then went to the
  gate and tested it. "And he can't get out here. We've missed him somewhere,
  and must look back again."</p>

  <p>We accordingly retraced our steps, examining room by room and preparing
  ourselves every time lest, when we turned the handle, Quong Ma should jump
  out upon us. But in every case we were disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I was surprised just now," said Nikola, after we had left the last
  apartment and stood in the corridor once more, "but I am doubly so now. What
  on earth can have become of the fellow? He seems to vanish into thin air
  every time we get near him. There must be another secret passage hereabout of
  which we are ignorant. Before we return, however, I want to make quite
  certain of one thing; let us continue that passage by which we ascended from
  the dungeons just now."</p>

  <p>We did so, Nikola once more going ahead with the lantern.</p>

  <p>"Just as I thought," he cried. "Look here!"</p>

  <p>He stopped, and stood with his back to the wall. At this point the passage
  came to an abrupt termination, and on the floor before us was an old blanket,
  a quantity of straw, about a loaf and a half of bread, and an earthenware
  pipkin containing a quart or so of water. Under the blanket was a half-used
  packet of candles, and from the grease that bespattered everything it was
  easily seen how he had obtained his illumination.</p>

  <p>"We have found our bird's nest at last," said Nikola, "but I am afraid we
  have driven him away from it for good and all. But we will have him yet, or
  my name's not Nikola. Now let us go back to the hall; we can do no good by
  staying here."</p>

  <p>We returned, but not before we had taken possession of the things we had
  found, and had carefully marked the position of the secret door, in case we
  should want to use it again.</p>

  <p>"After breakfast we will have another try," said Nikola. "In the meantime
  we had better take a little rest. You look as if you stood in need of
  it."</p>

  <p>It would have been better for me had I abandoned any thought of such a
  thing, for with Ah-Win lying dead only a few yards away and Quong Ma still at
  large, the drowsy god was difficult, if not impossible, to woo. Every danger
  that it would be possible for a man to imagine, I pictured for Consuelo; and
  when at last I did fall asleep, the dreams that harassed me were of the most
  horrible description. Right glad was I when morning broke and it became
  necessary to attend to the duties of the day.</p>

  <p>"If I were you, I should say nothing to your sweetheart either of her
  great-grandfather's condition or of the tragedy of last night," said Nikola.
  I agreed with him, although I knew that it could not be very long before the
  former would become known to Consuelo.</p>

  <p>"But surely she will hear about Ah-Win before very long?" I said. "Will it
  not be necessary for you to communicate with the county police, and for an
  inquest to be held?"</p>

  <p>"Ingleby," replied Nikola, "ask me no questions I have no desire to draw
  you into the matter. It is sufficient for you to know that Ah-Win is
  dead,"&mdash;he paused for a minute, and then added,
  significantly&mdash;"<i>and buried!"</i></p>

  <p>Try how I would, I could not contain my surprise. How, when, and by whom
  had the poor Chinaman been buried? Had Nikola carried it out himself? It
  seemed impossible, and yet, knowing as I did the indomitable energy and
  working powers of the man, I felt it might very well be true. I would have
  questioned him further, but I could see that he was not in the humour to
  permit it. For this reason I held my peace, though I knew full well at the
  time that by so doing I was giving my consent to what was undoubtedly an
  illegal act.</p>

  <p>From what I have said, I fancy it will be readily agreed that the past two
  or three days had been as full of incident as the greatest craver after
  excitement could desire. I had recovered from a serious illness, had
  witnessed the result of one of the most extraordinary experiments the world
  had seen, Ah-Win had been murdered, we had discovered Quong Ma's hiding-place
  in the castle, and had had a most exciting chase after him. Now Ah-Win had
  been buried secretly by Nikola, and if what had been done was discovered by
  the authorities, there is no saying in what sort of trouble we might not find
  ourselves. As soon as we had seen the Don, who was still wrapped in the same
  hypnotic slumber, and had breakfasted, we organised another search, only to
  meet with the same result. Later, I spent an hour with Consuelo upon the
  battlements. I was careful, however, to tell her nothing of the death of
  Ah-Win, nor of the reappearance of the detestable Chinaman in the castle. It
  would have served no good purpose, and would only have frightened her
  needlessly. When she reiterated her desire to see her great-grandfather, I
  found myself, if possible, at a still greater disadvantage. On returning to
  Nikola in the hall, I placed the matter before him. To my surprise, he did
  not receive it in the same spirit as I had expected he would do. I had
  anticipated a direct refusal, but he gave me nothing of the kind.</p>

  <p>"Why should she not see him?" he said. "Provided she give me proper
  notice, I fancy I can arrange that he shall behave in every way as she would
  wish him to do."</p>

  <p>"When, then, may the interview take place?"</p>

  <p>"Let us say at midday. Will that suit you? But before we arrange anything
  definitely, let us examine him ourselves, and see how he is likely to conduct
  himself."</p>

  <p>We accordingly made our way to the patient's room. I had noticed by the
  hall clock that it wanted only three minutes of the hour at which Nikola had
  ordered the Don to wake. On approaching his bedplace, we found him still
  sleeping peacefully, in exactly the same position as when we had seen him
  last. With his eyes closed and one strong arm thrown out upon the floor, he
  looked a magnificent specimen of a man. If only Dr. Nikola could perfect the
  brain, here was a being seemingly capable of anything. But would he be able
  to do so? That was the question. Watch in hand, Nikola knelt down beside the
  bed, and for some time not a sound broke the stillness of the room.
  Punctually, however, as the long hand of the clock pointed to the hour, the
  Don gave a long sigh. I jumped to the conclusion that he was about to wake in
  obedience to Nikola's command; but, to our surprise, he did not do so.</p>

  <p>"Strange," I heard Nikola mutter to himself, and, stooping over the
  patient, he lifted the eyelids and carefully examined the pupils.</p>

  <p>Five minutes went by, and still he did not wake.</p>

  <p>"Don Miguel," said Nikola at last, "I command you to wake. You cannot
  disobey me,"</p>

  <p>A slight movement was visible, but still the sleeper did not comply with
  the order given him. It was not until a quarter of an hour had elapsed that
  consciousness returned to him. With the opening of his eyes the animal look
  which I had noticed on the previous day came back to him. Instead of rising
  to his feet as he was ordered, he crouched and cowered in the corner, pulling
  at his bedclothes, and watching us the while, as if he would do us a mischief
  on the slightest provocation. Dangerous as the man had appeared the day
  before, it struck me that he was even more so to-day.</p>

  <p>"It is very plain that we shall have to keep an eye on you, my friend,"
  said Nikola. "I am not quite certain that you are going to be docile much
  longer. Let me feel your pulse."</p>

  <p>He stooped, and was about to take hold of the other's wrist, when the man
  sprang forward, and, seizing the Doctor with both hands, laid hold of his arm
  with his teeth, just below the elbow. Fortunately, Nikola was wearing a thick
  velvet coat, otherwise the injury might have been a severe one. Seeing what
  had happened, I threw myself upon the man, and, tearing him off, forced him
  down upon his bed. He struggled in my grasp, snapping at me and foaming at
  the mouth like a mad dog; but I had him too secure, and did not let go my
  hold until Nikola had fixed his arms behind him.</p>

    <p class="caption">I threw myself upon the man.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Good heavens, Nikola!" I cried, scarcely able to contain my emotion,
  "this is too terrible! What on earth are we to do with him?"</p>

  <p>"I do not quite see what we can do," Nikola replied, wiping the
  perspiration from his forehead as he spoke. "However, I must try my hand on
  him once more. If you can manage to keep him still, and I can get him under
  my influence, we ought to be able to keep him quiet while we have time to
  think."</p>

  <p>I did as requested, while Nikola made slow mesmeric passes before the
  man's eyes. It was fully ten minutes, however, before he succeeded; but as
  soon as he did, the patient's heartrending struggles ceased, and he lay down
  upon his bed, sleeping quietly.</p>

  <p>"I began to be afraid I was losing my influence over him," said Nikola, as
  he rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"One thing is quite certain," I answered, "and that is, Consuelo must not
  see him while he is in this state. It would frighten her to death."</p>

  <p>"And she would never forgive me," said Nikola; and I thought I detected a
  note of sadness in his voice. "Are you going to leave him as he is?" I
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"For the present," Nikola answered. "I must make up something that will
  have a soothing effect upon him. You need have no fear; he will be quite safe
  where he is."</p>

  <p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth before a movement on the bed
  caused us both to look round. Little as we had anticipated such a thing,
  Nikola's influence was slowly but surely working off, and the man was
  returning to his old state again. Even now, I never like to think of what
  happened during the next ten minutes.</p>

  <p>Before we could reach him, the Don was on his feet and had rushed upon me,
  Nikola ran to my assistance, and, strong men as we both were, I assure you
  that at first we could not cope with him. The struggle was a terrific one. He
  fought like the madman he certainly was, and with an animal ferocity that
  rendered him doubly difficult to deal with. When, at last, we did manage to
  force him back on to his bed and make him secure, we were both completely
  exhausted; we could only lean against the wall and pant: conversation was out
  of the question.</p>

  <p>"This will never do," said Nikola, when he had sufficiently recovered to
  speak; "if this sort of thing goes on, he will murder some one."</p>

  <p>"But how are you going to prevent it?" I asked. "It is plain that your
  influence has lost its effect."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing for it but to administer an opiate," he answered. "Do
  you think you can manage to hold him while I procure one?"</p>

  <p>I fancied I could; at any rate, I expressed myself as very willing to try.
  Nikola immediately hurried away. He informed me afterwards that he was not
  gone more than a minute, but had I been asked I should have put the time down
  as at least a quarter of an hour. To describe to you my feelings during that
  wait would be impossible; the loathing, the horror, and the abject personal
  fear of the man writhing below me seemed to fill my whole being.</p>

  <p>"I don't think we shall have very much more trouble with him for an hour
  or two to come," said Nikola, when the drug had taken effect, and we were on
  our feet once more.</p>

  <p>"But we cannot go on administering drugs for ever," I answered; "what do
  you propose to do later on?"</p>

  <p>"That is what we've got to find out," he replied. "In the meantime we must
  keep him up like this, and take it in turns to watch him. You had better go
  out now and get a breath of fresh air. If you see your sweetheart, pacify her
  with the best excuse you can think of."</p>

  <p>"Are you quite sure you are safe with him alone?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I must risk it," he replied. But as I moved towards the door, he stopped
  me.</p>

  <p>"Ingleby," he said, speaking slowly and sadly, "I don't know whether you
  will believe me or not when I say how deeply I regret what has happened in
  this case. I would have given anything, my own life even, that things should
  not have fallen out in this way. And what is more, I do not say this for my
  own sake."</p>

  <p>"You are thinking of Consuelo," I said.</p>

  <p>"I am," he answered. "It is for her sake I feel the regret. As a rule, I
  am not given to sentiment, but somehow this seems altogether different. But
  there, go away and tell her what you think best."</p>

  <p>I left him and went in search of Consuelo. She was in her usual place in
  the tower above her room. And when she saw me she ran to greet me with
  outstretched hands. Something&mdash;it might have been my pale
  face&mdash;frightened her.</p>

    <p class="caption">She ran to greet me with outstretched hands.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"My darling," I said, "you are not ill, are you? What makes you look so
  alarmed?"</p>

  <p>"I have been frightened," she answered; "more frightened than I can tell
  you."</p>

  <p>For a moment I thought she must have heard about her great-grandfather,
  but such was not the case.</p>

  <p>"I have only been up here a few moments," she answered. "The caretaker's
  wife was in my room when I left. The door was open, and, as I climbed the
  turret stairs, I thought I heard her call me. Turning round, I was about to
  descend again, when I saw, standing at the foot of the stairs, a man. He was
  looking up at me. For a moment I could scarcely believe my eyes. Who do you
  think it was?"</p>

  <p>Though I could easily guess, I managed to force myself to utter the word
  "Who?"</p>

  <p>"He was the man you saw behind the rock, the same I saw bending over me in
  my cabin on board the <i>Dona Mercedes,</i> that terrible Chinaman with half
  an ear."</p>

  <p>I feared that she might see from my face that I knew more than I cared to
  tell; but, as good fortune had it, she failed to notice it.</p>

  <p>"Surely you must have been mistaken," I answered. "What could the man be
  doing in the castle?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," she answered. "But I am as certain I saw him as I am of
  anything. He was standing at the foot of the stairs, watching me. Then he
  began to move in my direction; but before he could reach the bottom step, I
  heard a door open along the corridor. This must have frightened him, for he
  fled round the corner, and I saw no more of him."</p>

  <p>"It must have been my opening the door that saved you," I said. "Thank God
  I came when I did!"</p>

  <p>"But what does it mean?" she asked. "Why did that man come on board the
  boat, and why has he followed us here?"</p>

  <p>"I think the reason is to be found in the fact that he is Dr. Nikola's
  enemy," I replied. "They had a private quarrel in China some years ago, and
  ever since then this man has been following him about the world, endeavouring
  to do him harm. The case is a serious one, darling, and as you love me you
  must run no risks. Be on your guard night and day. See that your door is
  locked at night, and never venture from your room after dusk, unless I am
  with you. It makes my blood run cold when I think of your running such risks
  as you did this morning."</p>

  <p>"But what about you?" she said, looking up at me with her beautiful,
  frightened eyes. "Oh, why cannot we take my grandfather and go away, and
  never see this dreadful place again?"</p>

  <p>"We must wait patiently," I answered; "the Don is not fit to travel just
  yet."</p>

  <p>She gave a little sigh, and next moment it was time for me to leave
  her.</p>

  <p>For the next two or three days following, Nikola and I took it in turns to
  act as sentry over the Don. If it was not difficult work, it was the reverse
  of pleasant; for as soon as the effect of each successive opiate wore off,
  his evil nature invariably reasserted itself. Sometimes he would sit for an
  hour or more watching me, as if he intended springing upon me the instant I
  was off my guard. At others he would crouch in a corner, tearing into atoms
  everything within his reach. More than once he was really violent, and it
  became necessary for me to signal to Nikola for assistance. The horror of
  those days I shall never forget. When I say that, not once but several times,
  I have left that room dripping with perspiration, the pure sweat of terror,
  my feelings may be partially imagined. It was not madness we had to contend
  with; it was worse than that. It was the fighting of a lost soul against the
  effect of man's prying into what should have been the realms of the
  unknowable.</p>

  <p>"This sort of thing cannot last much longer," said Nikola, when our
  patient was lying drugged and helpless upon his mattress on the third night
  after the death of Ah-Win. And I knew he was right. Outraged nature would
  avenge herself.</p>

  <p>When Nikola had bade me good-night, I examined the Don to make sure that
  he was not shamming sleep in order to try and get the better of me directly I
  was alone. Finding him to be quite helpless, I seated myself in my chair and
  prepared to spend my watch in as comfortable a fashion as possible under the
  circumstances. During the day I had passed a considerable portion of my time
  with my sweetheart in the open air, and, in consequence, I found myself
  growing exceedingly sleepy. Knowing it would never do to allow slumber to get
  the better of me in that room, I rose from my chair and began to pace the
  floor. This had the effect of temporarily rousing me, and, when I reseated
  myself, I thought I had dispelled the attack. It soon returned, however, and
  this time it would not be denied. I rubbed my eyes, I pinched myself, I got
  up and walked about. It was no good, however, I returned to my chair, my
  eyelids closed, and, almost without knowing it, I dozed off. When I woke
  again, it was with a start. I rubbed my eyes and looked about me. Heavens!
  what mischief had I done? <i>The Don was not in his corner, the key was gone
  from the hook upon which it usually hung, and, worse than all, the door stood
  open!</i></p>

  <p>For a moment I was so overwhelmed with horror that I could do nothing. But
  only for a moment. Then I knew that I must act, and at once. I rang the bell
  for Nikola, and, having done so, dashed into the hall. Almost simultaneously
  Nikola made his appearance, coming from his room.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" he cried. "Why do you ring for me?"</p>

  <p>"The Don has escaped!" I almost shouted. "Like the fool I am, I fell
  asleep, and during that time he must have recovered his wits, stolen the key,
  and escaped from the room. Oh, what have I done? If she should see him as he
  is, it will kill her!"</p>

  <p>For a moment it looked as if Nikola would have swept me off the face of
  the earth, but the look scarcely came into his eyes before it was gone
  again.</p>

  <p>"We must find him," he cried, "before he can do any mischief, and, what is
  more, we must not separate, for he would be more than a match for us
  single-handed."</p>

  <p>Accordingly we left the hall and proceeded towards the Dona Consuelo's
  apartments. I thanked Heaven when I found that the door was locked. Calling
  to her, in answer to her cry of "Who is there?" I told her that I only
  desired to assure myself of her safety, and after that we passed on up the
  turret stairs and along the battlements, but no sign of the Don could we
  discover there. Returning to the corridor again, we descended to the great
  entrance hall and searched the courtyard and basement.</p>

  <p>The moon shone clear, and the courtyard was as light as day. Had there
  been any one there, we must certainly have seen him. Suddenly there rang out
  the most unearthly scream it has ever been my ill-luck to hear. It came from
  the direction of the chapel, which lay between the keep and what had once
  been the banqueting hall. From where we stood the interior of the latter was
  quite visible to us. On either side it had tall windows, so that the light
  shone directly through. The scream had scarcely died away before we
  distinctly saw a short figure dash into the room, and out again upon the
  other side. An instant later and a taller figure followed, and also
  disappeared. Again and again the scream rang out, while Nikola stood rooted
  to the spot, unable to move hand or foot.</p>

    <p class="caption">Again and again the scream rang out.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"I see it all!" cried Nikola. "That was Quong Ma and the other was the
  Don. They'll kill each other if they meet."</p>

  <p>I thought of Consuelo, and of the terror she would feel should she hear
  that dreadful noise.</p>

  <p>"They must not meet!" I cried. "It is too terrible. At any cost we must
  prevent it Where do you think they are now?"</p>

  <p>As if to let us know, another scream rang out. This time it came from our
  own quarters.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" cried Nikola, and dashed into the building. As you may suppose,
  I followed close upon his heels. In this order we flew up the stairs and
  along the first gallery, intending, if possible, to reach the small hall by
  the staircase near the kitchen in which Ah-Win had worked, and thus cut them
  off. As we crossed the threshold however, a wild hubbub came from the passage
  ahead, and told us that we were too late. I knew what it meant, and, if I had
  not been by that time quite bankrupt of emotions, I should certainly have
  been doubly terrified now.</p>

  <p>Leaving the kitchen, we dashed along the passage, only to find that the
  room usually occupied by Nikola's unfortunates was empty. With the exception
  of one solitary specimen, who by reason of his infirmity was unable to fly,
  they had all vanished. Leaving him to his own desires, we passed the iron
  gate, now thrown open, and a moment later had entered the hall itself. Once
  more the cry sounded, this time coming from a spot somewhat nearer Consuelo's
  apartment. On hearing it, my heart seemed to stand still. What if she should
  imagine that I was in danger and should open her door? The same thought must
  have been in Nikola's mind, for I heard him say to himself&mdash;"Anything
  but that."</p>

  <p>Side by side we raced for her door, only to find it was still shut and
  locked.</p>

  <p>Almost at the same instant a scream, louder than any we had yet heard,
  sounded from the battlements above.</p>

  <p>"At last!" I cried, and led the way up the stone stairs. I can only say
  that of all the horrid scenes I have ever witnessed, that I saw before me
  then was the very worst. In the centre of the open space between the
  parapets, fighting like wild beasts, were the two men of whom we were in
  search. Their arms were twined about each other, and, as they swayed to and
  fro, the sound of their heavy breathing could be distinctly heard. Having
  reached the top of the stairs, we paused irresolute. What was to be done? To
  have attempted to separate them would only have been to draw their anger upon
  ourselves, and to have made the fight a general one. The moon shone down upon
  us, revealing the smooth sea on one side and the many turrets of the castle
  on the other. From fighting in the centre of the open space, they gradually
  came nearer the parapet of the wall. Quong Ma must then have realised how
  near he stood to death, for he redoubled his energy.</p>

  <p>"They will be over!" shouted Nikola, and started to run towards them. He
  had scarcely spoken before they reached the edge. For a moment, locked in
  each other's arms, they paused upon the brink; then, with a wild shriek from
  Quong Ma, they lost their balance and disappeared. I clapped my hands to my
  eyes to shut out the fearful sight. When I took them away again, all was
  over, and both Nikola and I knew that Quong Ma and Don Miguel de Moreno were
  dead.</p>

  <p>I suppose I must have fainted, for when I returned to my senses once more,
  I found myself seated on the top of the stairs, and Consuelo's arms about
  me.</p>

  <p>There remains but little more to tell.</p>

  <p>At the time of that dreadful scene upon the battlements it was full tide;
  and though Nikola and I searched every nook and cranny along the coast-line
  for many miles, the bodies of the two men could not be found. In all
  probability they had drifted out to sea. The same day I summoned up my
  courage, and prepared to tell my sweetheart everything; but when I sought her
  out, and was about to commence my confession, she stopped me.</p>

  <p>"Say nothing to me about it, dear," she began. "I cannot bear it yet. Dr.
  Nikola has told me everything. He exonerates you completely."</p>

  <p>"But what of ourselves?" I asked. "Consuelo, you and I are alone together
  in the world; will you give me the right to care for your future happiness?
  My darling, will you be my wife?"</p>

  <p>"When and where you please," she answered, holding out her hands to me and
  looking up at me with her beautiful, trusting eyes. I told her of my
  straitened means, and how hard the struggle would be at first.</p>

  <p>"No matter," she answered bravely, "we will fight the world together. I am
  used to poverty, and with you beside me I shall know no fear."</p>

  <p>A hour later I had an interview with Nikola in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Ingleby," he said, "this <i>is</i> the end of our intercourse. I have
  tried my experiment, and though I have succeeded in many particulars, I have
  failed in the main essential. How much I regret what has happened, I must
  leave you to imagine; but it is too late&mdash;what is done cannot be undone.
  I have given orders that the yacht shall be prepared. She will convey you to
  Newcastle, whence you can proceed in any direction you may desire. One thing
  is certain: Dona Consuelo must leave this place, and, as you are to be her
  husband, it is only fit and proper that you should go with her. I have only
  one wish to offer you: it is that you may be as happy as these past weeks
  have been sad."</p>

  <p>He held out his hand to me, and I took it.</p>

  <p>"We shall meet no more," he said. "Go away and forget that you ever met
  Dr. Nikola. Goodbye."</p>

  <p>"Goodbye," I answered. Without another word he turned and left the
  room.</p>

  <p>Shortly before midday we boarded the yacht. Steam was up when we arrived,
  and within a few minutes we were steaming out of the little bay. Consuelo and
  I stood together at the taffrail, and looked up at the grim old castle on the
  cliff above our heads. Standing on the battlements we could distinctly see a
  solitary figure, who waved his hands to us. Then the little vessel passed
  round the headland, and that was the last we saw of Dr. Nikola.</p>
