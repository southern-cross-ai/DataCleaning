<h2>The End Of a Childhood<br>
Four Further Chapters In The Life Of Cuffy Mahony</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Twelve months almost to a day after her husband's death, Mary
Mahony received a letter that greatly perturbed her.</p>

<p>It was handed to her straight from the sorting table.
Recognising the writing, she put on her spectacles and unthinkingly
slit it open. But she had not read far before her colour rose, and
with a covert glance at her two subordinates&mdash;the telegraph
operator, who sat lazily picking his nose, had a sly and roving
eye&mdash;she hastily refolded it and thrust it in her pocket.</p>

<p>There it remained; and all day long she was conscious of it, as
of something hot or heavy. Not until evening, when the office was
closed and the children lay asleep, did she draw it forth again.
Then, alone in her little parlour, she pulled the kerosene-lamp to
her and prepared to face the contents.</p>

<p>It was from her old friend Henry Ocock, and ran:</p>

<blockquote>Wendouree House,<br>
Ballarat.<br>
<br>
My dear Mrs. Mahony,<br>
<br>
My prolonged silence has not, I trust, led you to infer me grown in
any way indifferent to your welfare. Far from it, you have, if I
may say so, seldom been absent from my thoughts. But I have
hesitated to intrude, without due cause, on a grief that I regarded
as sacred. Now, however, when it may be assumed that Time, the
great Healer, has assuaged the first bitterness of your irreparable
loss, I venture to take up my pen on a subject of to me vital
importance.<br>
<br>
What I am going to say may, no doubt will surprise you. But the
wish, the fond hope, I am about to express, is, believe me, no new
one&mdash;I have cherished it longer than I should dare to tell
you. Dear friend, I cannot but think you have always been aware how
much I admired, how highly esteemed you&mdash;though doubtless
still appraising you below your true worth. It would be impossible
to minimise the heroism you have shown in battling with a
concatenation of circumstances that would have crushed a lesser
spirit. In my estimation, few women are worthy to be compared with
you, and of this esteem and veneration I now offer you tangible
proof, by asking you if you will do me the honour to become my
wife.<br>
<br>
I will not, in this connection&mdash;and I think you will
understand me&mdash;make use of such terms as love and passion. We
are neither of us in our first youth, and have each had our full
share of Life's Trials. But my appreciation of your many excellent
qualities of mind and heart have only increased with the years; and
should you, dear friend, consider that these sentiments suffice,
that you could, without trepidation, lay your fate in my hands, I
assure you you should never have reason to regret it.&mdash;There
are, besides, others than ourselves to think of. My children sadly
need a mother's care, yours a father's guiding hand.<br>
<br>
Let me entreat you not to reply too hastily. Take your own
time&mdash;as long as you will&mdash;to consider my proposal.<br>
<br>
Until then, believe me,<br>
Truly and devotedly yours,<br>
Henry Ocock.</blockquote>

<p>For a moment Mary continued to sit with this letter in her hand,
staring a little stupidly over the top of it. Then she dropped it,
even gave it a slight push away from her. In reading, she had grown
more and more uncomfortable. Till she came to the bit about the
children. At that, a kind of stiffening ran through her. What?
<i>Her</i> children?&mdash;Richard's children?&mdash;to need the
guidance of...of Henry Ocock? "Well, upon my world!"</p>

<p>But, no, you couldn't...she mustn't...look at it that way.</p>

<p>Taking off her spectacles&mdash;they were the cheap, ugly,
steel-rimmed kind&mdash;she settled herself squarely in her seat,
mouth and chin gripped fast in the hollow of one hand: an attitude
she often fell into when unpleasant things had to be
faced&mdash;bills for the mending of the children's boots,
complaints from Head Office, the contrariness of columns of figures
that would <i>not</i> tally.</p>

<p>Yes, unpleasant was the word: her first feeling was one of utter
repugnance. The thought of marrying again had never occurred to
her. She wasn't that sort. And now came Henry Ocock...<i>Sir</i>
Henry Ocock...for the fraction of a second her mind lingered on the
prefix. But in the next minute she heard Richard's voice saying:
"Confound his impudence!" and with so much of the familiar Irish
over-emphasis that she simply had to smile. Oh! she could just
imagine how angry Richard would be. <i>His</i> wife.... Henry
Ocock!</p>

<p>This violent personal antipathy she had never shared. She had
even been given to standing up for Mr. Henry, preferring as she did
to think that there was <i>some</i> good in everybody. And if
Richard could now come back and see what a friend Ocock had proved,
he'd have to admit she was right. Though of course if, all the
time, Mr. Henry&mdash;Sir Henry&mdash;had had <i>this</i> up his
sleeve...But there! why go poking and prying into people's motives?
(That was Richard again&mdash;not her.) Let her stick to facts.
Where would she and the children be to-day, if Ocock had not come
to their aid? Why, in the gutter...or the Benevolent Asylum.
Certainly not together; and that would have hit her harder than
anything. Then again her transfer, six months ago, from that
dreadful Gyrngurra, to this more civilised place, with a
forty-pound rise in salary, a decent <i>brick</i> house, and a
large garden for the children to play in: all this she owed to Mr.
Henry's influence. (Of course, that he had feelings just like
anyone else, <i>she</i> had known since the day when she saw
him...made him...cry.)</p>

<p>No, the truth had to be faced: Richard was gone and she couldn't
go on for ever letting herself be swayed and prejudiced by what he
had thought, by his likes and dislikes. Times changed, and you
changed with them. Looked at in this light, Ocock's letter was
nobody's business but her own. For who else knew the circumstances
that had led up to it? (Certainly not Richard.) And so, compressing
her lips, she began by admitting&mdash;a little
doggedly&mdash;that, in spite of its stiffness and pomposity, its
"estimations" and "venerations" where he might have said "like" and
"respect," ("concatenation" she'd never seen or heard of
before)&mdash;in spite of everything, Ocock's letter was a generous
one. Considering the&mdash;well, she wouldn't say "the snob he
was"&mdash;but considering the enormous value he set on money and
connections and social prestige; remembering, too, the nobody he
had been to start with, and the way he had climbed (and over
<i>what</i> obstacles!) to the top of the tree; she thought it,
now, more than generous of him, to put his pride in his pocket and
stoop to a poor little up-country post-mistress. (And not at all
patronisingly: his wordiness, his difficulty in coming to the
point, struck her as rather pathetic.) Yet to say "stoop" wasn't
being quite honest either. For every one knew who <i>she</i>
was...or had been. Richard's name still counted for something. And
if this affair had happened a few years earlier, she would have
been the one to stoop, not he.</p>

<p>Even as it was, the favours wouldn't be all on Ocock's side.
Nobody was more experienced than she in running a big
establishment&mdash;the scale of living at "Ultima Thule" would
have made Ocock himself open his eyes&mdash;how to keep it up to
the nines, yet without undue extravagance. She would even undertake
to manage him, too, if necessary; after Richard, no other man would
prove difficult. And it would surely be worth a great deal to Mr.
Henry, for once in his life to have some one to club with him and
support him. His nearest relations&mdash;his damaging old father,
his dissolute brothers, poor little Agnes with her fatal
weakness&mdash;one and all, in their separate ways, had been
weights to drag him down. With a different family at his back, he
might have ended as Prime Minister.&mdash;She would even guarantee
to get on with Agnes's children; though these were now in their
teens, of an age bitterly to resent the coming of a stepmother.</p>

<p>Yes! had that been all. In any of these ways she could have made
herself useful...even indispensable. (Indeed, the idea of showing
what she <i>could</i> do, in this line, made a kind of insidious
appeal to her.) But it wasn't all; and it wasn't enough. He didn't
want a housekeeper or a business companion; he wanted a wife. And
it was here her courage failed her. She had been so essentially, so
emphatically, a one-man woman; never had her inclination strayed;
having Richard, she had everything she needed. Of course, he had
caught her <i>very</i> young, very innocent. Perhaps, had she been
just a little older, with more knowledge of life...more
<i>nous</i>...For really, by nature...yes...well..."Well, you know
what I mean," said Mary to herself, a series of half-formed images,
which she would have shrunk from completing, chasing one another
across her mind. And at the thought of now having to begin all over
again&mdash;at <i>her</i> age&mdash;with a stranger; at the thought
of once more yielding her freedom, (which she had learned to value)
of an invaded privacy, the intimacies of the bedroom&mdash;no! it
was not to be contemplated, not for an instant: it simply could not
be done.</p>

<p>And there was another thing. If she married, she might still
have children&mdash;<i>his</i> children. And this was surely the
crucial test. For the unloved man's embraces might be borne: they
concerned yourself alone. But what must that mother feel, who had
to see appearing in the children she loved&mdash;and that you could
help caring for the little things you carried about with you for
nine long months was unthinkable&mdash;uglinesses of face and
character belonging to the father? Eyes set too close together, or
shifty eyes, or thin, cruel lips. Foxy
ways...unscrupulousness&mdash;double dealing. She could imagine
nothing, nothing more horrible.</p>

<p>But here she broke off, with an impatient click of the tongue.
For this string of faults and blemishes, whose were they but Henry
Ocock's as seen by Richard? Oh, it was hopeless, quite hopeless:
Richard would have her under his thumb to the end; and even more
than during his lifetime, when she could at least stand up to him
and fight for her own opinions. Well, one thing she had to be
thankful for: in <i>his</i> children there was nothing she need
fear to see develop. No ugliness of face or disposition
there!&mdash;And as she now sat and thought of them, and of what
they meant to her, she saw that all this arguing and disputing,
this palaver about what <i>she</i> could or could not put up with,
was a mere foolish beating of the air. In matters that affected the
children, she simply did not count. The sole query was, would they
benefit? Did they stand to gain by her re-marrying?</p>

<p>She felt a sudden need of being near them, of having them before
her eyes. Getting up she fetched a candlestick from the kitchen,
lit the candle, and went into the bedroom. But, in passing the
dressing-table, she caught a glimpse of her own shadowy figure; and
yielding to an impulse she crossed to the glass, holding the light
above her head.</p>

<p>There she stood and looked at herself: not as a mother, or a
wage-earner, but a woman&mdash;and a woman somebody still thought
worth marrying! On the wrong side of forty now, middle-aged, and
for all the world to see&mdash;since she had never a moment left in
which to care for her appearance. Her hair had worn best: it was
still glossy and fairly thick, nor had the straight white centre
parting spread. But it had gone very grey round the temples; and
these, and her forehead, were furrowed with lines; while wrinkles
fine as spiders' webs teased her lids, and ran out, fan-shaped,
from the corners of her eyes. The sharp steel of the glasses, too,
had cut a permanent red line on the bridge of her nose. The big
dark eyes, which had once been her chief feature, might still, if
freed from the disfiguring spectacles, have passed muster; but that
was all. Of the lower part of the face the less said the better:
the nose was pinched, the mouth thin-lipped and elderly; and all
sorts of odd twists and creases were forming on her once smooth
cheeks and chin.</p>

<p>And yet...and yet...such a store of energy still existed in her,
that, give her but half a chance to recuperate, a spell, say, of
nights unbroken by the rat-tat-tat of the night-mail, and the
consequent shivering of her sleep to atoms: give her these, and she
believed she would rise a different woman. Then, too, there would
be no more knitting and screwing up of the brows, or biting of the
lips, or straining of the eyes, over infinitesimal dots and dashes,
or dizzy rows of figures. No more denying herself in order that the
children should not go short; or pinching and scraping in order to
make a pittance of a hundred-and-twenty a year stretch to twice its
size. No more twelve-hour days on her feet&mdash;these hot, tired,
throbbing feet&mdash;or hands rough and red with rough work. No
more quailing before her subordinates&mdash;never, never again,
anything to do with young men of their class!&mdash;a telegraphist
who subtly, a postman who openly flouted her authority, both
knowing their jobs much better than she knew hers. Oh! what it
would mean to be rid of them, to retire into private life again,
did not bear thinking about. Seized by a sudden fear, she turned
from the glass.</p>

<p>In the dimity-hung double bed that stood against the wall,
little Lucie, her bed-fellow, slept the drunken sleep of childhood.
Bending over her, she was lying face downwards, Mary turned her on
one side, then, passing a finger under the fair thick mass of
curls, lifted them, for coolness' sake, and spread them out over
the pillow. It was a very hot night; and on his little
stretcher-bed in an adjoining cubbyhole, Cuffy lay drenched in
perspiration. Here, his mother's first act was to take a clean
little nightshirt from a drawer, sit him up, slip off the wet one
and pop the dry over his head, he opening his eyes for a second,
unseeingly, making a kind of growly noise in his throat, and
dropping back fast asleep, before she had finished with the
buttons. And, as she did this, other nights rose before her, scores
of them, on which she, or Nannan&mdash;even Richard
himself&mdash;had made the change. The habit dated from Cuffy's
babyhood.</p>

<p>It was only a trifle, but it seemed to unlock the flood-gates;
and sitting down beside him, her elbows on her knees, her chin in
her hands, remembering and remembering, she put the question that
mothers have asked themselves since the world began: who would do
these things for my children if I were not there?&mdash;But no,
that sounded too like being dead. What she meant was, if I were
prevented, belonged to some one else who had first claim on me, or
the right to object. Some one, too, who, from what she knew of him,
might easily turn jealous of her children and the love she bore
them. Who might not even like them. And indeed, he and Richard
having had such different natures, could she reasonably
<i>expect</i> him to like Richard's children? The probability was,
he wouldn't; and they would be pushed into the background, kept
down: as mere stepchildren made to play second fiddle to his
own.</p>

<p>But here, her mind taking a sudden leap, she came face to face
with the bug-bear that stalked her wakeful nights&mdash;the problem
of Cuffy's education. For the present, he went every morning for a
couple of hours' lessons to Mr. Burroughs, the clergyman; and it
was enough: Richard had always been against forcing him. But after
this?&mdash;say, a couple of years hence? Oh, when she thought of
all the plans and ambitions they had nursed for their
first-born...now blown to the four winds. Yet, even still, there
was something in her, something obstinate, irrational, which
refused to believe that Cuffy would be done out of public school
and university. And now, as always when she reached this point, she
declared to herself: "Well!...if the worst comes to the
worst!"&mdash;and with such emphasis that her lips moved to the
unspoken words. What she meant was: though I have never for myself
borrowed or owed a farthing, yet...when it's a case of my
children...And then once more she went over in thought those it
would be least galling to apply to for aid. Old Lady Devine, who
was for ever making them presents; Tilly, childless now herself;
and&mdash;yes, as long as he had been content to remain a friend,
the list had also included Henry Ocock. Now, Ocock had put himself
out of court. But, even if she married him, could she expect him to
share her ambitions and aspirations for a child that was not his
own? Or even understand them? He was none too fond of untying his
purse-strings. In all probability he would want to put Cuffy into
business, or thrust him, half-grown, half-educated, into a
Bank.</p>

<p>And there were other things, too, that he might not, would not,
understand.</p>

<p>The children had thriven in the past half-year; even Cuffy
having at last begun to fill out and grow. This was partly due to
them having a garden again to play in; they had always been used to
gardens. But the chief reason, no good shirking it, was that an
ugly shadow had been lifted from their lives. Children were not
built to stand what hers had been through. And, her first grief
over, she could not but feel glad for their sakes that Richard was
gone. Whether she had really done right, in taking him away from
the asylum, she sometimes wondered; when she saw how they had
blossomed out since his death. And yet...and yet...</p>

<p>That they had not got off scot-free she realised when it was too
late. For it was all very well to plume herself on them being their
father's children, in good looks and nice feelings. That wasn't the
whole truth. They had inherited other, less desirable traits as
well: Richard's ultra-sensitiveness, his finickiness (what they
would and would not eat, what they chose or did not choose to wear)
his Irish uppishness. In other words, they were both very highly
strung; and, in consequence, the strain of his illness, and the
unhappy years preceding it, had told on them more severely than if
they had been ordinary children. Look at Lucie. In her seven short
years Lucie had seen so many changes&mdash;the death of her little
twin sister, the racketing from place to place, the collapse of one
home after another, and, worse still, the collapse&mdash;of the
father who should have been her mainstay&mdash;that she, too, had
broken down, and was now little better than a bundle of nerves.
Having lost so much, the child lived in a constant fear lest her
last and dearest should also be snatched away. It was Mamma here,
Mamma there; and on those rare evenings when she, Mary, stepped
across the road for a chat with the Bank Manager's wife, she knew
that on her return, no matter at what hour, she would find the
child sitting bolt upright in bed, with frightened eyes and
perspiring hands, convinced that Mamma had gone away, or was dead,
and would never come back. Neither scoldings nor pettings took any
effect.</p>

<p>Cuffy, always excitable, had shortly after his father's death
developed a convulsive twitching and blinking of face and eyes that
was distressing to see. The doctor said the habit was purely
nervous, and would pass as he grew older. Meanwhile, there was
nothing to be done; except sometimes hold up a glass to show him
how ugly or how silly he looked. But did she think of him, of
either of them, going among strangers thus handicapped, to be made
fun of, or found fault with&mdash;perhaps even
<i>punished</i>&mdash;for failings they had done nothing to
deserve: at the mere thought of it, all her protective tenderness
was up in arms. No; Richard's children they were, for good or for
ill; and Richard's children they should remain. No one but the
father they were so like would be capable of understanding
them.</p>

<p>And here, as if to brace her in her decision, words she had once
heard, and which her memory had as it were stored up for use in
this crisis, came floating into her mind. "Henry Ocock is harsh
with children...is harsh with children."</p>

<p>That did it: now she knew where she stood. Well, he
shouldn't&mdash;she wouldn't give him the chance to be&mdash;with
hers. On no one but herself should their lives and happiness
depend.</p>

<p>Picking up the candle, she went back into the sitting-room where
the letter lay, just as she had left it, open on the table. Without
giving it a second glance, she took out pen and paper, and sat down
to frame her reply.</p>

<p>Oh yes, she knew quite well what she was doing when she wrote:
<i>deeply as I appreciate your kindness, I cannot marry you</i>.
Besides condemning herself to poverty, she was cutting herself
adrift from the friend who had most power to make things easier for
her. (Stung in his vanity, Ocock would hardly be big-minded enough
to go on pulling strings on her behalf.) She was also, in a sense,
taking leave of her womanhood. Many a year must elapse before
either of the children could come to her aid. By then she would be
old in earnest, and long past desiring. But she did not waver. Once
more it had been brought home to her where her heart really lay.
And then, with the ink still wet on her name, she smiled to
herself&mdash;a grim, amused little smile. In all this pro-ing and
con-ing, this weighing of profit and loss, she had taken no count
of the children's own inclinations: Richard's children, blessed (or
cursed) with Richard's faculty for pronounced likes and dislikes,
with his mercilessly critical eyes. Now, it was with almost a
feeling of compensation that she thought to herself: I wonder what
<i>they</i> would have had to say of HIM...as a father!</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Cuffy would soon be nine now; and very proud he felt of it. Not
quite so proud as if it was ten: ten was like a little platform,
where you stood and looked at a row of steps going down to one
(what were you before that?) and up to twenty. It was twenty he
thought of when he said: "When I'm a man." Twenty was awfully old;
any time after that you might die. Oh well, he knew people did go
on being older. Mamma and Bowey both had grey hairs on their heads,
and'd been alive so many years they didn't like to tell, but
pretended they'd forgotten. But he didn't think he would. Specially
not since he'd heard the text: who the God loves dies young. For if
you loved God, as you <i>had</i> to, and God loved you back,
then...</p>

<p>Another proud thing was his satchel; that he carried his
school-books in. This was a present from the same old Lady Devine
who'd given them their piano, so that they could go on practising.
Not <i>exactly</i> a present; she'd sent the money for it; and he'd
been allowed to go by himself and buy it, at the shop down the town
where they sold pens and paper. It was brown, and had two straps
with buckles on them. He always let Luce fasten one, to make up for
having to stop alone while he went to lessons. She came across the
road with him, and stood and waved; and when he'd run along the
rightaway and climbed the embankment to the top road, she was still
there. And her pinny was always dirty, from falling down, and her
socks hung over her shoes. Every time Mamma saw her she said: "For
goodness' sake, child, pull up your socks!" (Yet wouldn't let her
wear garters, because of spoiling the shape of her legs.) And when
he came home at eleven she was dirtier still. He tore down the hill
and she tore to meet him, and he kept her on the other side of him
because of the dam, which Mamma was afraid she'd fall into and be
drowned.</p>

<p>But he liked going to lessons; Mr. Burroughs was so nice. (The
Reverend John Noel Burroughs his whole name was.) Mamma was in a
dreadful hurry for him to get there punctually at nine; but once he
was on the top road and she couldn't see him, he didn't run any
more. For mostly Mr. Burroughs wasn't up yet; and he'd have time to
spread out his books and maps and pencils on the table, and
sometimes draw a whole ship, or a horse, before he came. And then
he'd just have put on his overcoat on top of his pyjamas. And he'd
laugh and say: "I <i>shall</i> have to pay another visit to the
ant, shan't I?" (which meant he was a sluggard.) But he was
<i>very</i> nice. He never made you feel you were only a little
boy. He'd come and put his arm round you and say: "Now then, old
chap, let's see what you've been up to!"&mdash;in your sums or
parsing. And he didn't say: "That's wrong...or three mistakes," but
only, ever so polite: "I think it would look better this way,
sonny!"&mdash;Really, sometimes in church on Sunday, when you saw
him come up the aisle in his black gown with the white one over,
and the blue silk thing hanging down his back, and his head bent
and carrying his sermon, it made you feel quite shy, to think how
<i>different</i> you knew him, sitting in his pyjamas with his arm
round your neck.</p>

<p>Another nice thing about him was that he never laughed at
you&mdash;no, not even when you "made your faces." Mostly, he'd
pretend not to notice. But if they were very bad he'd say: "Let's
take a breather, shall we?"&mdash;which was because the doctor had
said you were to have lots and lots of play. And then they'd leave
off doing lessons, and go out in the yard and play tipcat; or Mr.
Burroughs would show him how to bowl. And when he got too hot he'd
take off the overcoat and just be in his pyjamas.</p>

<p>Another time was when he'd asked that <i>silly</i> question
about the book. Mr. Burroughs read books all through lessons,
mostly with brown-paper covers on, to keep you from seeing what
they were called; after one day he'd caught you trying to make the
name out. Mamma said they were yellow-backs, and not proper books
for little boys. But once there hadn't been a cover on, and it was
such a funny name that he simply <i>had</i> to ask&mdash;Mr.
Burroughs never minded you asking questions, <i>he</i> said they
showed an intelligent mind. So he said: "But why is it spelt like
that? In the Bible it's always 'goeth' when it says: 'He who goeth
down to the sea to get on board a ship:'" (which wasn't a text at
all, he just made it up, because he liked ships so much, and now
they lived so far away from the sea.) And first Mr. Burroughs
didn't know what he meant. But when he did, he didn't laugh, but
just said, well, it hadn't got anything to do with "go," but was
the name of a man&mdash;one of the wisest men that ever
lived&mdash;and was called "Gertie." (But when he told them at
home, feeling rather proud about it, <i>they</i> laughed like
anything and wouldn't believe him; for Mamma said no man had ever
been called "Gertie," that was a little girl's name. And only after
he'd found out that it was a "foreigner name," then they had to.
Privately, he thought it was too funny for words, and that he'd
rather not be wise than have to have it for his.)</p>

<p>Then there was the time Mamma told on him; which he didn't think
she ought to have done. He had to learn Latin now: Mr. Burroughs
said you couldn't begin Latin too young. So he took <i>Mensa</i>;
and when Mr. Burroughs was surprised how quick he knew it, Mamma
said it was because he'd made a tune to it, and sang it while he
learned it. And Mr. Burroughs didn't even smile, but thought it was
a "brilliant idea," and said they'd go on having it to music. So
then he had to sing it when he said it, and Mr. Burroughs liked the
tune so much that he went and fetched Miss Burroughs in&mdash;he
didn't have a wife, only a sister&mdash;to hear it, too. And she
clapped her hands and said it was wonderful; and then they talked
together, and he heard them say something about a "natural
moddleation to a dommy-something"&mdash;but it couldn't have been
<i>Dominus</i>, for he had another tune for that: <i>Dominus</i>
sounded so <i>strict</i>. And Miss Burroughs said soon he'd have to
learn the organ and play for them in church, and Mr. Burroughs said
he'd have him in the choir, and then he'd teach him a plain
song.</p>

<p>Miss Burroughs was a lovely lady. As tall as her brother, who
was <i>very</i> high, with yellow hair, and the most beautiful
teeth when she smiled, and a neck like a swan. Well, people called
it that; but <i>he</i> thought a swan had a neck like a snake, and
hers was thick and round. She was so kind, too. He never had to
take any lunch with him; every morning she gave him a slice of
bread and jelly to finish up with; and in all his life he thought
he'd never eaten anything so delicious.&mdash;Mamma only made jam,
not jelly.</p>

<p>Yes, going to lessons was <i>most</i> int'resting: there was
always something new that you didn't know yet. How many masts a
ship could have, f'r instance, and what ships were called because
of them, and how they were rigged&mdash;Mr. Burroughs, he liked
ships, too. And how to draw a circle so that it was eszackly round,
with arms that went out from its middle, and what <i>they</i> were
called. And all about the Greeks and Romans, and what funny people
they were. The Greeks wore short dresses and bare legs&mdash;like
Luce&mdash;and the Romans rode on elephants when they went to war.
Goodness! <i>that</i> must have been exciting. Nowadays, if you
wanted to see an elephant at all, you had to go to the circus.</p>

<p>A funny thing happened about these Romans; he thought of it
directly he began to learn them; and it had to do with their noses.
And that was because every one in Yerambah said about Mr. Burroughs
that he had a Roman nose. This was so awfully interesting that it
did something to him inside, and wouldn't give him any peace till
he'd shown he knew (even though it sounded a little rude), and
asked: "What does it mean when you say a'Roman nose?' When the
Romans are all dead and gone?"</p>

<p>This time Mr. Burroughs did laugh&mdash;not to offend you,
though, he just sort of looked mischievous and half-shut one eye.
"It refers to the shape, my boy! If you want to see a good Roman
nose, look at mine. And then go home and look in the glass, and
you'll see another!" Which made him turn all hot and funny-feeling;
first to think <i>he</i> had one (when he was just beginning to
learn about the Romans) and then because he'd got something the
same as Mr. Burroughs, who everybody said was so
handsome.&mdash;And home he went to the glass in Mamma's bedroom,
and swung it low and examined himself. But his nose didn't show
properly against his face, and he couldn't look sideways because
Mamma hadn't got a hand-glass any more. And while he was there, she
came into the room and found him and said: "What on <i>earth</i>
are you doing, Cuffy?&mdash;staring at yourself like that! Looking
to see how ugly you are?"&mdash;But he didn't tell her, for fear
she'd tell again. He kept it as a secret with Mr. Burroughs.</p>

<p>He didn't tell Luce either; for hers was little and fat; and she
mightn't have liked it&mdash;or like him having something Mr.
Burroughs had, when she hadn't. She didn't enjoy him being away so
long in the morning, and watched for him ever such a time, and was
dreadfully glad to see him come back. But so was he. For though
lessons were jolly, the rest of the day was jollier, when they had
nothing to do but play. And play they did...oh, how they played!
Mostly just him and Luce. They knew some other children in
Yerambah, and sometimes went to parties; but their best games were
alone, by their two selves. Luce was quite happy as long as every
now and then she could go and look at Mamma; and she always played
what he liked: it was him who said what the game should be. Mamma
thought they were "the queerest children," because they never
wanted variety, but went on with one till they were finished with
it. When it was cool it had been hopscotch, and they'd played till
Luce's legs almost broke in two, and their boot-soles had holes in
them. In hot weather it was "knuckle-bones," which they collected
themselves, going down to the butcher to beg them. Then they sat
all day long on the back verandah, at an old table Mamma made them
out of a packing-case and some lids, and tossed the little bones up
in the air, catching and scooping and driving them home, as pigs to
market or horses to stall&mdash;till their own finger-bones were
sore.</p>

<p>There was a swing in this garden; and it wasn't like the swings
other children had, but was hung between two tall telegraph-posts,
so that you could go ever so high. And the most lovely thing about
it was that it was <i>dangerous</i>; for the seat was loose, not
fastened on, but just with two notches in it to fit the rope.
<i>He</i> wasn't a bit afraid of it coming off, and stood to swing,
working himself up so far that he almost turned over, and Luce got
frightened and fetched Mamma, and Mamma came and called out: "Stop
it, Cuffy! Stop it at once!" Luce, she sat to swing, and felt
seasick when she went the least little bit high. He'd never been
seasick, not in his whole life, Mamma said so; but had always
walked about a ship asking for his dinner.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, there were exciting things to do from the moment you
waked, about six, and jumped out of the hot, crumply bed straight
into the bath; which you could fill as full as you liked here, for
there was plenty of water, even though it was red. And for
breakfast, if you wanted to, you could take your bread and butter
in your hand and eat it running round the garden, with peaches or
figs or nectarines to it (when they were ripe); for there was lots
and lots of fruit, and you were allowed it all&mdash;except
almonds, which was because Mamma said Lallie had once died of
eating them. There was a 'normous long hose to water the garden
with; and sometimes, when it was very hot, they would play it was a
rainy day, and put on something very old, and umbrellas, and turn
the hose over each other, to make them cool. Mamma didn't like this
very much; she was afraid people would look through the fence and
see you and call you "those queer children" again, and whatever
were you doing? Besides, it made the verandah in such a mess.</p>

<p>But mostly Mamma was <i>very</i> nice now, and never
cross&mdash;or hardly ever: only if the Inspector was coming; or
when she was bothered about her "statement"; or if you broke a
plate; or climbed up on the roof and walked about on it, making a
noise on the iron like thunder. Then she thought you might fall off
and kill yourself.</p>

<p>And in the evening, when it was dark well, then he had a sort of
secret with Mamma; one even Luce didn't know (like his nose with
Mr. Burroughs.) It was when Bowey was giving Luce her bath to go to
bed. After the office was shut and the sun had gone down, Mamma
used to bring the rocking-chair out on the front verandah, where
she never went and they weren't allowed to go in the daytime,
because the office-window, where you asked for letters and stamps,
opened off it. But at night it was quite private. And then, though
he never, never did when it was light, he was much too
big&mdash;well, then somehow, when nobody was looking, he'd find
himself sitting on Mamma's knee; even though his legs were so long
now that they hung over it right down to the ground.</p>

<p>And there they'd sit, just Mamma and him, nobody else knowing
about it; and it was most awfully comfortable, when you were tired,
quite the most comfy place, with a kind of shelf for your head, and
Mamma's arms keeping you from falling off, and her chin against
your hair. You just sat there and didn't talk, not at all...you
wouldn't have liked to; it was too close for talking. Besides,
there was nothing to say.</p>

<p>Really what you did was just to lie and stare at things.
Sometimes the moon was up and sometimes it wasn't. But you could
always see the dam and the top road and the hill. This was the hill
the sun went down behind every night; and when there were
thunder-storms they came up behind it. Then, half the sky would
still be all blue&mdash;or starry&mdash;and half one 'normous black
cloud that rushed along as if it had wings, and made Luce very
afraid. Once, one of the little houses on top of the hill had been
struck by lightning, and the fire-bell had rung after everybody had
gone to bed, making such a terrific noise that everybody got up
again; and the house had first been nothing but flames that
stretched miles up into the sky, and then was burnt down. They went
to see it next morning and it was just a black smoky mass, with
nothing left: Mamma said that was the worst of wooden houses, they
burnt like match boxes. But <i>she</i> believed the people in it
had set fire to it themselves, to get money.</p>

<p>The time the comet came, too, it was over this hill. They were
allowed to get up to see it. Bowey wakened them when it was ready,
and put their ulsters on and brought them out; and they sat on the
edge of the verandah and looked...so long that Luce nearly went to
sleep again. But he didn't; he stared and stared at it&mdash;tail
and all&mdash;to make sure he'd never forget. But he wouldn't
forget the rest of the stars either; the whole sky was chock-full
of them. That was because there was no moon, and because it was
right in the middle of the night. (When the moon was round and big,
like a bladder hanging up at the butcher's, you couldn't see the
stars, it put them out.)</p>

<p>Sure as sure, though, just as he was lying thinking all this,
thinking, too, what they'd play at to-morrow, and what he'd ask Mr.
Burroughs at lessons, and how pretty Miss Burroughs was; then,
Bowey would call out from the back verandah, where the bathroom
was: "Your bath's ready, Cuffy!"</p>

<p>But he didn't move; and Mamma, she mostly made a kind of sigh
and said: "Oh dear! there she goes again. I really must call her
over the coals."</p>

<p>And he, just to stay sitting: "But why should <i>she</i>
say'Master Cuffy'...if she doesn't want to? Other children's
servants don't."</p>

<p>But Mamma knew why he did it, and only said: "Don't ask silly
questions. Off you go now! Or the water will be cold." And she
tipped down her lap till he had to stand on his feet.</p>

<p>But still he hung back. "Why does Bowey always have to give me
my bath? Why can't I do it myself?...why can't I? I'm nearly nine
now, and I learn Latin, and...and you could look at my ears
after!"</p>

<p>Mamma laughed. "There would be a great deal more of you than
your ears I'd have to look at. But you know quite well Bowey
wouldn't like it. She's bath'd you both ever since she came. And it
wouldn't do to offend her."</p>

<p>"Why not? We pay her money."</p>

<p>"There are some things all the money in the world wouldn't buy.
And what Bowey did for me was one of them."</p>

<p>Cuffy knew quite well what Mamma meant. But not for anything
would he have shown it. Papa and his illness were fast getting to
seem like a dream, a nasty dream&mdash;being chased by a black
horse, or trying to run with your legs in water-that you put far
away from you, and did your best never, never to remember.</p>

<p>Back he whisked to his original theme.</p>

<p>"Well, can I when I'm <i>truly</i> nine? Mamma! Say
yes!"&mdash;and he pumped her arm up and down.</p>

<p>"Oh well, perhaps. We'll see&mdash;now, <i>do</i> you want Bowey
to have to come and fetch you?"</p>

<p>Grudgingly Cuffy dragged his feet to the door. There, however,
he stood to finger and break a morsel from the edge of a damaged
brick; went back to the verandah's edge to flip it into the
roadway; then took aim with an imaginary ball down the length of
the verandah (oh, <i>why</i> did children, no matter how tired, so
hate to go to bed?) and only at a second, impatient shout from the
bathroom disappeared into the house.</p>

<p>He left his mother deep in thought. What he said was true: very
soon he would be a big boy, "little Cuffy" no more: the day of long
legs and lankiness was at hand.</p>

<p>And together with an inevitable regret, at seeing the child she
had fondled change and pass, came the baffling problem of his
future. What should she do? How give him the education to which, as
Richard's son, he had a right? Opposed, too, no doubt, by relatives
and friends, who would think her ambitions for him exaggerated,
absurd, and only likely to unfit him for his after life. Yes, she
would have to fight for him.&mdash;And as she sat there, looking
out into the shadowy silence of the bush street, where a line of
tall gum-trees stood, but never a street-lamp, and where no vehicle
moved after dark, Mary's face wore the dogged look with which she
fronted and overcame obstacles; tempered by a touch of the selfless
ecstasy which her children&mdash;or the thought of her
children&mdash;alone had power to wake in her, who stood with her
feet so firmly planted on this earth.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>She decided to make the journey to Melbourne. In this, she was
encouraged by Mr. Burroughs, whom she went to church one Sunday
specially to consult.&mdash;As a rule nowadays she was no
church-goer. Her Sundays were spent in making up arrears of
office-work, in overhauling the children's clothing, in cooking and
baking for the week to come. ("If God bothers his head about me at
all, He'll understand. ")&mdash;And after service Mr. Burroughs,
still in cassock and surplice, his stole&mdash;he had taken it off
while coming down the aisle&mdash;dangling from one hand, stood in
the porch and chatted to her, nodding and smiling at his departing
congregation, or taking aim with a stone at some inquisitive dog.
(Really, delightful man though he was, he had very little dignity
as a clergyman.)</p>

<p>He entirely agreed with her that the time was coming for Cuffy
to leave home.</p>

<p>"The boy has ability&mdash;learns quickly, remembers well. What
he needs, to make a man of him, is to be among boys of his own
age." And in relating the incident to his sister, he added:
"Otherwise, he'll turn into a regular oddity. He has all the
makings of one in him. Mammy-fed&mdash;that's what he is. Nothing
but women round him, and only a girl to play with."</p>

<p>So, at midwinter, Mary applied for and was granted "leave of
absence;" and wrote announcing her arrival to some of her old
friends. Just as she expected, she had heard no more of Henry
Ocock. But the Devines were to be relied on; and, after Ocock, Sir
Jake was the most influential person she knew. Through him she
would obtain particulars of the Melbourne Grammar School, the
terms, and rules of entry; and find out how the land lay with
regard to a possible scholarship.</p>

<p>It was to Sir Jake, too, she supposed, that the hated appeal for
a loan would eventually have to be made.</p>

<p>Next, she fell to furbishing up her clothes, turning, sponging,
pressing; inking the seams of black gloves; persuading old
bonnet-plumes back into curl with the aid of a silver fruit-knife;
cutting out and stitching a couple of new frocks for Lucie. The
child went with her, of course; there was never any question of
leaving Lucie behind.</p>

<p>Cuffy would stop at home, with Bowey and the Relieving Officer,
the latter by special request a woman, whom Bowey could put up and
do for. Hence, another of Mary's jobs before she set out was
thoroughly to clean the house. For the older she grew, and the
poorer, the more fanatically she clung to a spotless
nicety&mdash;it was all that was left her&mdash;and no stranger on
entering should ever be able to point to an "Irish curtain," or a
dusty corner; her carpets were hooked down, not nailed, and the
beds could every one be washed under. And having dragged the
dining-room furniture out into the middle of the floor, she was
horrified at the state of the walls: bare, they showed brown and
fly-stained, and bore numberless traces of greasy little fingers.
She might just as well, while she was about it, give walls and
ceiling a fresh coat of whitewash.</p>

<p>There was nothing unusual in this; she had always to be her own
handyman nowadays; taking sewing machine and clocks to pieces,
cleansing the parts and fiddling with them, till she got them fixed
and going again. (And oddly enough, thus late in the day, she had
discovered in herself an unsuspected interest in machines: they
seemed to her to have more meaning in them, more <i>sense</i>, less
room for vagaries, than most other things in life.) Once, to
retrieve a dead mouse, she had been obliged to take the action of
the piano apart. Whitewashing four walls and a ceiling was child's
play in comparison. So, tying up her head in a handkerchief, and
binding an apron round her waist, she climbed with her bucket to
the top of the tall wooden step-ladder. And soon the great flat
brush was sucking and splashing, the thick, milky drops were
flying.</p>

<p>At times like these the children were bidden to keep out of the
way. Thus they were in the garden when the accident happened.</p>

<p>What caused it, she never knew. Perhaps, in trying to drive her
brush into an awkward corner of the ceiling, she had leaned too far
to one side; or the bucket, perched on top of the steps, might have
threatened to tip over, and she have made too hasty a grab at it.
However it was, she lost her balance, struggled desperately to
regain it&mdash;the bare walls offered no hold&mdash;and came down
with a crash, bucket and steps on top of her. The noise, and the
scream that escaped her in spite of herself, reached Bowey, who was
scrubbing the kitchen; and in the old woman came running, drying
her hands on her apron, loud-voiced with alarm.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mahony, Mrs. Mahony! Now what <i>have</i> you done?
Whatever have you done now!"</p>

<p>"<i>Hush</i>, Bowey!&mdash;you'll frighten the children. It's
all right, I'm not dead. Quick, help me up before they come. It's
my leg I think&mdash;oh! my leg." And while Bowey pulled away steps
and bucket, and lugged and tugged at her, Mary bit her lips, white
with pain.</p>

<p>"Fetch me a drink of water, and then I'll try&mdash;no, stop, I
<i>can</i> straighten it, it's not broken&mdash;thank God for that!
Oh, Bowey, don't be so silly." For, in her relief, Bowey had flung
her apron over her head and sat down to cry. "Help me to the bed.
I'll rest for a bit."</p>

<p>There she remained, sick and giddy, the injured leg bound round
with cold-water bandages. The children came running in, full of
interest and excitement. <i>They</i> knew, from bitter experience,
what it meant to hurt your legs, graze your knees bloody, and have
to sit still with cloths tied round them. Now Mamma had done it;
and it was rather fun to perch on the edge of the bed and talk to
her while she drank her tea. Other days she never had time to
talk.</p>

<p>Next morning, though she ached from top to toe, Mary managed to
drag herself into the office, where she sat to work, her
leg&mdash;by now it was discoloured, and acutely painful to the
touch&mdash;stretched out before her on a stool. But in spite of
all her care it grew worse instead of better; and by the end of the
third day, being still unable to stand, she gave the journey to
Melbourne up as lost. Here she would need to stay.</p>

<p>Having handed over charge to her deputy, who had now to lodge at
the primitive hotel, she strove to resign herself to an inactivity
that was new to her. Not that she was idle: she mended, darned,
knitted, without stopping. Yet soon it began to seem to her, who
had so seldom been off her feet, that all she really did was to lie
there, hour after hour, day after day, listening to time tick past,
waiting for an improvement that <i>would</i> not come.</p>

<p>Every remedy she had ever heard of for the relief of a bruised
bone, she tried: bathing, poulticing, fomenting: everything, except
sending for the local doctor. She knew no good of him; and, anyhow,
her belief in doctors was small; she having always been behind the
scenes as it were in medicine. Or perhaps her long dependence on
Richard, and Richard's skill, had shaken her faith in anyone else.
And when at length she yielded to Bowey's entreaties and sent for
Dr. Forrest, it was just as she expected. The most ordinary little
up-country practitioner, he had nothing fresh to suggest; he merely
confirmed her in her treatment, and bade her to go on with it. Time
alone, said he, was needed for complete recovery.</p>

<p>While he was there, a strange thing happened. From so much
thinking and worrying, her brain had grown very woolly; and, as she
lay listening to him stumbling over his words, watching his fumbly
hands, she had a kind of lapse of memory, in which he got all mixed
up in her mind with some one else, a doctor just like him, who had
sat beside her and asked her questions&mdash;oh, years and years
ago, on Ballarat, when her first baby was born, and Richard had
been too nervous to attend her himself. And this confusion spread
and grew till the past seemed much more real than the present, and
she was once again the frightened girl-wife, lying on her first
sick bed.&mdash;Even after he had gone, she could not shake herself
wholly free.</p>

<p>The children and their chatter roused her, and Bowey carrying in
a tray. But at night there was nobody to call her back, and she
would drift, and drift, till she was very far away. Otherwise, she
had nothing to do but lie and count the throbs (in the darkness
they thudded like little hammers), struggling to make herself
believe they were getting easier; when all the time (and she knew
it) they were growing steadily worse. Then, her courage failed her;
and she, who had never been given to brooding, finding it simpler
just to shoulder her burdens and plod on&mdash;she, too, now fell
to questioning Providence, trying to dig out a meaning in, a reason
for what had happened. "It all seems so <i>stupid</i>. What's the
use of it? What good can it do anyone?" But more often she
reproached herself: "Oh, <i>why</i> couldn't I have left those
walls alone! So dirty they were not." And to these words, oddly
enough, there would come an answer. Somebody or something, that was
like, and yet not like herself; something that stood aloof, looking
coldly on, would say: "<i>You</i> could never have done that. It
isn't in you." To which she, her real self, gave back hotly: "I
can't bear <i>dirt</i>...if that's what you mean!" But as to this,
the thing that was her, yet not her, refused to be drawn. The sole
response, given in an icy tone, was: "No use talking now. It's too
late. As one's made, one's made"&mdash;which sounded like a knell.
And <i>was</i> the finish; for to: "Oh, I know that, I know! But
<i>why</i> was I made like it? Who's responsible?" never a word
came in reply.</p>

<p>Night after night she went through the same performance, to
which the unbearable thought was added: "Oh, <i>what</i> would
become of <i>them</i>, if...if..." or "Shouldn't I after all have
thought twice, before..." Until one night she became conscious that
she was talking aloud, getting audible answers. Then, panic seized
her, lest she should be going out of her mind; and, having faced
this new horror till day broke, she took a sudden decision, and
sent a cry for help to the friend who had never yet failed her;
whose great good sense would know what it was best to do.</p>

<p>And as fast as train and coach would carry her, Tilly came: a
Tilly greatly altered since the death of her child; in many ways
but a shadow of her former self; gaunt-looking and lean, where she
had once been round and comfortable. But at sight of Mary's
predicament all her old energy revived. In two twos she had grasped
and taken command of the situation.</p>

<p>More horrified than she dared to show by the appearance of the
wound, which by now was dark, and very puffy, she would hear of
nothing less than Melbourne, and a Melbourne doctor.</p>

<p>"What? Leave you here and let that ignorant brute lose your leg
for you? Not me!"</p>

<p>Mary's faint objections of the expense, of a "leave" that was
all but up, passed unheeded. The wires were set in motion, the
authorities informed, those good friends, the Devines, called on to
do their share. After which, Tilly spent half one night at the
sewing machine, manufacturing a loose dark garment, without
fastenings, that could be slipped on over the patient's head. Then,
since a journey in a crowded coach was out of the question, she
took a door off its hinges, placed a mattress on it, saw Mary laid
on this improvised stretcher, and carried out to a cart with its
flap down, for the long bush-drive to the nearest railway
station.</p>

<p>A further protest of: "Oh, but I <i>couldn't</i> leave Lucie
behind, Tilly&mdash;it's quite impossible. The child has never been
parted from me. She'd fret herself sick," again received scant
quarter.</p>

<p>"Then all I say is, <i>let</i> her! Is <i>this</i> a time, I'd
like to know, to pander to a spoilt child's whims!"</p>

<p>And it was of no use trying to explain. All the explanations in
the world would not have made Tilly understand.</p>

<p>Lying in the cart, Mary raised herself on her elbow for a last
look at her two: they stood hand-in-hand, the long-legged, the
small and fat, among the little crowd that had gathered to watch
her departure. Excitement had for the moment even dried Lucie's
tears. It was not for her to set them re-flowing. So all she said,
and in a matter-of-fact tone, was: "Now <i>do</i> be good, chicks,
and not give Bowey any trouble; she'll have her hands full. And I
shall soon be back. Till then, mind you look after Lucie,
Cuffy&mdash;whatever you do, take care of her."</p>

<p>Cuffy he just nodded. He thought she <i>needn't</i> have said
that about being good, in front of everybody. Or about Luce either.
For he always did&mdash;besides, she'd said it ever so often
before. So he only nodded, and looked at the horse and the man who
was driving it, instead of her. Anyhow, he didn't care much to look
at Mamma these days: her face was so red and hot-looking, not a bit
like it ought to be. He didn't like to see her dressed so funny
either, lying out there in a cart for all these people to stare at.
He wished she'd hurry up and go.&mdash;And soon she did; for Aunt
Tilly was dreadfully afraid they'd miss the train&mdash;though what
she said to the man was: "Now if you let your horse break into a
trot I'll brain you!" Then she climbed up and sat beside Mamma,
with a bottle and a parasol; and the horse walked away with them
through the township.</p>

<p>But all the same it was a very exciting going-away. And it was
<i>his</i> door Mamma was lying on; because it was the smallest.
Now, there was only a hole where the door had been. You could look
through it at night to where Luce slept with Bowey. Mamma had said
it was a good job he had holidays, because of Luce. But it didn't
really matter, for Luce never wanted to play now, only to stop with
Bowey. As long as she could do that, she left off crying.</p>

<p>So he played alone. Just at first Mamma's going left a sort of
hole in him (like the door.) But after that he thought he was
really rather glad. For when she wasn't there he didn't need to
think so much about her. She wasn't <i>nice</i> to think of, since
she fell off the steps&mdash;not able to walk properly, and her
face so red and swollen. He wanted her to look like she always
had.</p>

<p>But even though he could manage to forget her face, he wasn't
really happy. Because of a secret he knew&mdash;one he never told
anybody, not even Luce. As long as he was out in the garden it
didn't bother him much. But when he went to bed, before he was
sleepy, then it was just like a lump in his chest. It was something
he'd heard Aunt Tilly say to Bowey, when she didn't know he was
listening. How, if Mamma's leg didn't get better, she might have to
have a wooden one. And that was <i>simply dreadful</i>. He'd once
seen an old man with a wooden leg, strapped on where his own leg
stopped&mdash;just a long thin stick, with a lump at his
knee&mdash;and at the thought of Mamma having to go about as
hideous as that, he could have cried. Of course, ladies had dresses
which covered it up; but you couldn't stop the noise it made on the
floor, going clump, clump, clump; or the way the old man had to
roll about when he walked&mdash;oh, no, no! he couldn't <i>bear</i>
to think of Mamma like that, truly he couldn't. Why, the larrikins
would shout after her in the road. And when he went to school (and
she'd promised him faithfully he should) she might come and see
him, and then the other boys would laugh and make fun of her behind
her back, and he'd feel so ashamed he believed he'd die. Only to
think about it made his sheet get twisted like a rope, and the
blanket fall down to the floor. And Bowey heard him and came in and
picked it up, and scolded him for not being asleep. (As if you
could <i>make</i> yourself go to sleep, if your eyes didn't want
to!)</p>

<p>In the daytime he played his hardest. But heaps of days went by,
a whole week of them, and it began to be dreadfully dull, always
playing alone. Bowey wouldn't let him ask other children in: "I
don't know if your Ma would like it." In despair he took to doing
things he <i>knew</i> Mamma didn't like: hanging over the
garden-gate to see if somebody mightn't go past; or swinging on
it...till the cross-bar broke, and he had an awful time fixing it
up so that Bowey shouldn't know. After that he did another thing he
wasn't allowed to: opened the gate, and went into the street and
swung on the chains that were put on posts along the footpath, to
keep you from falling into the gutters (which were ever so deep)
when it was dark or you were tipsy. But while he was there, some
rude children came from the state school and asked if his mother
knew he was out. And he felt himself go so red that he didn't
remember the proper answer, which was, yes, she'd given you
sixpence to buy a monkey and were <i>you</i> for sale. Instead, he
jumped up and ran back into the garden.</p>

<p>But then one day he had an idea&mdash;a perfectly scrumptious
one, and Luce liked it too. They'd make a flag for when Mamma came
home&mdash;people always had flags when anything specially nice
happened. Bowey had given them their threepences for the week,
Mamma'd told her to. He'd spent his; for always, as soon as he got
it, he tore up to the little lolly-shop by the Chinese Camp, where
you got a simply enormous lot of chocolate-pipes for threepence
(because they were gone whitey); but Luce still had hers, and
thought it was a <i>lovely</i> idea, and would give it. (Instead of
putting it in her money-box.) So on Monday, when Bowey was busy
washing and hadn't time to see them, they ran down the street to
the township, and bought a beautiful piece of turkey stuff, bright
red, and ever so large; and he cut a stick for it, and they made
holes in it and tied it on, so that it was a flag. Only it looked
very bare, flags mostly had something painted on them; so they
decided they'd <i>write</i> something on theirs; and went indoors
and picked some beads off one of Mamma's cushions, and got a needle
and cotton from Bowey's work-box, and began to stitch "Mamma" in
white beads on the red stuff. It was <i>awfully</i> difficult; Luce
was a perfect donkey, and couldn't do anything, and his hands
weren't much good either. Most of the beads broke, when you tried
to poke the needle through them; and when he went to fetch some
more, all the others on the cushion began to run away and he
couldn't stop them. (He had to turn it with its face to the
wall.)</p>

<p>It made him perspire all over to sew, it was such hard work. And
the letters <i>wouldn't</i> go straight. It took ages; and he'd
only just got <i>mam</i> done when suddenly there was a telegram
from Aunt Tilly saying they were coming back&mdash;the very next
day! Then, he was far too excited to sew any more. He and Luce
rushed about the garden shouting; and he made a song that went:
Hurray, hurray, hurray, Mamma will be home to-day! (Which was
<i>nearly</i> true.) But in the night he didn't believe he hardly
slept at all, because of that about the wooden leg, which wouldn't
go out of his head.</p>

<p>They started to watch for the coach long before it was time.
They played at hearing it, and ran races down to the corner of the
road to see. Bowey didn't tell them they weren't to, to-day.</p>

<p>And at last they <i>did</i> truly hear it&mdash;the horses' feet
and the wheels rumbling&mdash;and he tore in and got the flag
(they'd hidden it in the summer-house, so that Bowey shouldn't
know), and then they both stood and held it, as high as ever they
could. (Only there was no wind to make it fly.)</p>

<p>And first they saw the red through the trees, and then the whole
coach. And no wonder it was so long coming, the horses were only
just <i>lolloping</i> along; because it wasn't the coach that
carried the mails. And it came to where they were, and pulled up,
and the driver twisted his reins round the brake, and climbed down
and opened the door. And after he had fetched a carpet-bag, Aunt
Tilly got out...backwards, her behind first. (By now his heart was
thumping so loud he thought people would hear it, because in a
minute now he'd know about the leg.) But then...why, what was this?
Instead of Mamma getting out next, the coachman shut the door, and
got back on his box, and untwisted the reins and shook them at the
horses. Hi! What was he doing? Why was he taking Mamma away again?
Cuffy's eyes felt as if they were popping out of his head, and his
mouth got so dry it stuck together. He just managed to make it say:
"But where's Mamma? Hasn't she come?"&mdash;And all of a sudden, as
he said this, his heart started to knock his chest so hard that
what it had done before hadn't been knocking at all.</p>

<p>And now Aunt Tilly turned round and was coming to them; and to
Bowey, too; and first she looked most dreadfully, <i>dreadfully</i>
angry, and then her face sort of shrivelled up, till she hadn't any
eyes left, and her mouth sort of went right inside her cheeks. And
then she began to cry...cry like anything...and took out her
handkerchief and tried to stop, and couldn't, and was angrier
still, and said, ever so fiercely: "No, she hasn't. She couldn't.
Your Mamma will never come again. She's dead."</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>In after years, Tilly would volunteer in self-defence: "Upon my
soul, I never <i>meant</i> to blurt it out like that. I was going
to prepare 'em...break it gently, and so on. But when I saw those
two chits standing there clutching that bit of rag&mdash;well, I
don't know, but if you ask me, I think it was this what got me.
Anyhow, there it was: I started to cry, and it just jumped out. But
I've often thought since, it was probably best so after all. They
had to know. And the sooner the better. Besides, it's not my way to
go beating about the bush.&mdash;Never shall I forget though, how
that child <i>blushed</i>!"</p>

<p>For, as the hard, cruel words came flying at him, like so many
stones, all the blood in his body seemed to rush to Cuffy's face
and stop there, scorching and burning. He forgot everything
else&mdash;Luce, the flag, Mamma not coming&mdash;he'd only one
thought: to get away from Aunt Tilly, somewhere where she...where
nobody could look at him any more. And so he turned and ran, ran
for his life, to the top of the garden, in behind the big cactuses,
holding his fingers to his ears so that he shouldn't hear if she
went on talking, or if they shouted for him to come back. And sat
there, his ears stopped up, his eyes shut, his face like as if
somebody had smacked it hard all over.</p>

<p>Later on, when time brought wisdom, he saw that what had driven
the blood to his head, his heels to flight, was shame: the shame
that was always to overcome him in face of another's shamelessness.
But as a small boy, he just went on sitting there, conscious of
nothing but his hot and angry cheeks. Nor, till he made sure nobody
was being sent to fetch him, did his fingers relax their hold.</p>

<p>Nobody came: and gradually his face cooled off, his heart
stopped thumping. Then he was able to think; and his thinking was:
it can't, it <i>can't</i> be true!...somebody must be telling it
wrong, or not know properly. Mamma would <i>never</i> go away and
die, and leave them like this. That was something that simply
couldn't happen.&mdash;And with the feeling that to hear more about
it might somehow make things different he got up and went down the
path.</p>

<p>This was quiet as quiet, not a sound anywhere: and for a second
the wild hope raced through him that the coach had come back, while
his ears were stopped, and taken Aunt Tilly away again. (Oh, if
only...if <i>only</i>!) First the drawing-room...nobody there. In
the dining-room there couldn't be anybody either, it was so still:
but he just went round the door to see&mdash;and oh, goodness
gracious! behind it, on the sofa, sitting close together, were Aunt
Tilly and Bowey: and what they looked like, he would never, never
forget. They weren't making not the very littlest sound, which was
why he hadn't known: they were too <i>deep</i> in crying for that,
their faces all wrinkles, their eyes shut and gone in, their mouths
stretched right across their cheeks, their heads nodding and
nodding like china mandarins.&mdash;Once more he turned and
fled.</p>

<p>Back in the garden he stood about, not knowing what to do or
where to go; and, in standing, picked the little new leaves and
buds off the Japanese honeysuckle. Everything looked just like it
always did and yet was somehow quite different. He felt as if he'd
never really seen things before: the summer house, the gum-trees,
the swing, the wood-stack, Bowey's empty kerosene-tins. They all
looked like strangers, the garden, too&mdash;oh, but what was he
doing? The tree he was pulling the leaves off now was not the
honeysuckle at all, but the elderberry, which he simply
<i>loathed</i>, and never touched if he could help it, it had such
a horrid smell.&mdash;This garden they were so fond of, where he
and Luce had played and played.</p>

<p>Luce! Where was she? What had become of her? Rushing indoors
again he looked everywhere, going into every room (only not the
dining-room.) And at last, from a teeny-weeny noise, he found her:
squeezed as far as she could go, right up by the wall, under
Mamma's bed. Alone, forgotten, she had crawled in there and hidden
herself, safe from every one but Mamma. She wasn't crying any more,
but her face was fat with it, and she wouldn't come out, he
couldn't make her. So he went in beside her, and said: "It's all
right, Luce, it's all right, I'm here, I'll take care of you." And
they just went on lying there together. Till all of a sudden,
feeling how hard the bare boards were (which was all Mamma would
ever allow under a bed) he remembered how he'd dreaded the thumping
noise a wooden leg would make on the floors. And that was too much
for him. Turning his head away, and hiding his face in his sleeve,
he began to sob and cry, like a small little child. And went on for
what seemed like hours, till he couldn't cry any longer.</p>

<p>Blowing her nose&mdash;so loud that anybody out in the street
could hear it&mdash;Aunt Tilly sent Bowey to find them and bring
them to be told "all about it." (The whites of her eyes were red
and blotchy, her face shone like an onion.)</p>

<p>"Well now, you poor children, I suppose you'll be wanting to
know just what happened. Well, my dears, it was exactly as I said
all along. This darned fool of a doctor here never found out the
real trouble, which was a piece chipped off the bone, which caused
all the mischief. And when we got to Melbourne it was too late, the
doctors couldn't save the leg; and when they went to cut it off,
your poor Ma was too far gone to stand it, and just pegged out.
After she went away from here she was light-headed most of the
time, and didn't know what she was talking about; but <i>I</i> knew
how she worried about what was to become of you two if she had to
go; and I gave her my solemn promise I'd look after you. And so I
will...for her sake. For she was the best friend I ever 'ave had,
and the oldest, too. We'd known each other since she wasn't much
bigger than you&mdash;long before she ever met your Pa, that was.
She used to live with me and my poor sister&mdash;Polly we called
'er then; little nimble busy Polly."</p>

<p>Hastily Cuffy averted his eyes: for, the way her face began to
twitch, he thought she was going to cry again. (Besides, they knew
all about when Mamma was Polly. She'd told it them heaps of
times.)</p>

<p>However, Aunt Tilly just sniffed hard up her nose, and swallowed
in her throat, and dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief, and went
on: "Well, you're not really big enough yet to understand all what
that means; but anyhow, my dears, I saw to it that she got a nice
grave&mdash;one out in the main avenue, easy to get at, not tucked
away in a corner. And it'll have a stone on it, too, with her name
and age and a text, all proper and right, as soon as the earth
sinks. And if you're good and do as you're bid, you shall go to
Melbourne one day and see it, too.&mdash;But now I must get started
to work. There's so much to think about and see to that I don't
feel I know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels."</p>

<p>Hand-in-hand Cuffy and Lucie went back to the garden, and sat
down on the wood of the wood-stack. There they stayed: they didn't
know what to do with themselves, and the day seemed to have lasted
years already. Very soon the rattle of the sewing machine came out
to them; and this went on and on; for the first thing Aunt Tilly
did was to sew mourning for them, out of some old black dresses of
Mamma's (the kind of stuff you didn't ever make <i>boys</i>'
clothes of!) But <i>she</i> didn't know that, or how to sew them,
and the things she made were simply awful: Mamma would <i>never</i>
have let them go out such sights. Luce's dress pinched her under
the arms, and one leg of his knicker-bockers hung down longer than
the other. But when he showed her it, she didn't take any notice,
and said a little thing like that didn't matter. (<i>Never</i>
would he be able to go to school in them!)</p>

<p>But it hurt even worse to see her opening Mamma's cupboard and
fetching out Mamma's clothes and turning them over and cutting them
up, just as if they belonged to her. In vain he protested: "When
Papa died we only had bands on our sleeves. Mamma wouldn't let us
wear black."</p>

<p>At these words, and at the tone they were said in, Aunt Tilly
gave him a very queer look, and left off sewing Luce a
petticoat.</p>

<p>"Now look here, my boy, just you listen to me. I'm not going to
stand any nonsense. You're older now by a year than you were when
your poor Pa died, and I'll see to it that you do what's right by
your Ma. She was the best woman that ever walked this earth, or
ever will; she hadn't her like&mdash;as you children 'll know some
day to your cost. And when you do, you'd be scandalised to think
you hadn't paid proper respect to her memory. So now not another
word! Black you'll have, and black you'll wear!"</p>

<p>The stuff scratched like ants walking over you. At night, when
Aunt Tilly was asleep, Bowey sewed tape round inside the necks to
keep it off you. (Bowey knew what funny skins you had.)</p>

<p>Next, Aunt Tilly went all through the house with her spectacles
on, and a pencil and paper, examining the furniture.</p>

<p>"What's she doing that for?"</p>

<p>"You'd better ask her yourself, my poor lamb," said Bowey; and
how she said it showed <i>she</i> didn't like Aunt Tilly much
either.&mdash;They were always "poor lambs" to Bowey now; she never
scolded, and cried so that he didn't often go near her, for fear
he'd have to cry again, too. (Aunt Tilly didn't know he ever had.
And shouldn't.)</p>

<p>Once more he plucked up his courage. "Why are you doing
that?"&mdash;Even to his own ears his voice didn't sound very
polite.</p>

<p>"Why do you suppose?" said Aunt Tilly crossly; she was getting
up all red and hot from looking under the sofa at its legs. "For my
own amusement?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Cuffy simply and truthfully.</p>

<p>At this she whisked off her spectacles and made a face as if she
was going to bite him. But then changed her mind, and said, just
irritated-like: "Sakes alive, Cuffy! you're not a baby any more, to
be asking such silly questions. Why, you'll soon be a man; and have
got to learn and behave like one. Now just listen to me. It's not a
bit of good you carrying on. Your poor Ma's gone; and all the
weeping and wailing in the world won't bring 'er back. It's the end
of 'er. But there's you two children left to be seen after and
provided for <i>some 'ow</i>, and money's what's needed to do it
with. The things 'ave got to be sold, my dear&mdash;and for what
they'll bring. Your Ma doesn't need them any more. She won't miss
them&mdash;where she's gone."</p>

<p>"But we can't live without furniture!" Never had Tilly seen such
wide, astonished eyes.&mdash;Oh, was there ever such a stupid
child! You could wear your tongue out, explaining.</p>

<p>"Or do you mean we're not going to live here any more?"</p>

<p>"Why, of <i>course</i> not, you silly! How could you? Why, the
new P.M. 'll be in before we can say Jack Robinson, and 'll need
the place for his own furniture."</p>

<p>"Where are we going?"&mdash;Cuffy's mouth felt so dry it would
hardly speak.</p>

<p>"Well, that's just what's not fixed yet. I'm waiting for your
Uncle Jerry, to talk things over."</p>

<p>But Uncle Jerry lived ever such a long way off; and it was two
whole days before he got there. Awful days, that seemed as if
they'd never end. He just <i>mooned</i> about, kicking things with
his feet, and feeling more mis'rable than he'd believed he ever
could any more (after Mamma dying.) But he didn't say a word to
Luce: he was afraid of making her cry again. As it was, Aunt Tilly
<i>despised</i> Luce, thought she was an awful baby, always liking
to be <i>with</i> somebody and never alone&mdash;she even tried to
make her not sleep in Bowey's bed. And when every night she found
her in it just the same, she said she was a very naughty girl.</p>

<p>Then it was Cuffy's turn to try and explain. Which was hard,
because he didn't have the right words.</p>

<p>"It's not <i>really</i> naughty, Aunt Tilly. Luce's always been
like that. She can't help it."</p>

<p>"Can't help it? Never did I hear such nonsense! A great girl of
eight!&mdash;Well, I know this, my boy, there's precious little of
your poor Ma in either of you. It's your Pa you take after, both of
you, more's the pity. He was just such another. What <i>she</i> had
to put up with, her life long, simply doesn't bear telling."</p>

<p>In these wretched days, funny things went on in his, Cuffy's,
mind. For one, he'd never known how much he'd hoped and
<i>believed</i> everything could stay like it was, and they just go
on living with Bowey and the furniture. He hadn't <i>wanted</i> to
know different, that was it: he'd just been a stupid boy. He hadn't
known either till now how fond he was of the "things." Even still
he couldn't imagine life without them. They'd always been there,
and everywhere Mamma and they went, they'd gone too: the big green
leather armchair, the leather sofa, Papa's bookcase with the books
in it, Mamma's bed, and her brushes with the ivory backs that had
turned all yellow. Oh, he simply couldn't bear to think of anybody
else using them, or sitting in them, or sleeping in them. Mightn't
Uncle Jerry, when he saw how much you liked them...and how
<i>mis'rable</i> it made you...mightn't he perhaps say you might
keep them, he'd let you?</p>

<p>But this fond hope was quickly routed. To begin with, Uncle
Jerry was in a dreadful hurry. Aunt Fanny was ill, which was why he
hadn't gone to Melbourne to Mamma's funeral; and now he'd only got
a very few days' leave, which mostly went in travelling. He told
this directly he got there; so you couldn't expect him to sit down
and listen to <i>you</i>. After he'd kissed Luce and him, and said
how most awfully sorry he was about Mamma, who'd always been his
favourite sister, and who he'd never forget, he went into the
dining-room with Aunt Tilly and shut the door, to talk
business.</p>

<p>But no sooner they'd started to talk than they began to quarrel.
Well, not exactly quarrel; but to talk <i>very</i> loud, and with a
tremendous lot of arguing. He could hear them from the garden,
going on and on, till at last he couldn't stand it any longer, and
went close up by the window (where the elderberry tree grew) to try
and hear. And it was Mamma they were talking about, all Mamma's
business; and without ever asking him or Luce a thing. (Oh,
<i>why</i> did he have to be so young? Why wasn't he allowed to
talk, too?)</p>

<p>Making himself small, he crushed up under the window-sill; and
then he could hear every word. Aunt Tilly was only a poor woman
(why, he'd thought she was <i>ever</i> so rich!) and had a husband
on her hands who'd never be good for anything again; but she was
quite ready to do her share&mdash;though <i>some</i> might think
she'd done it already, what with the illness, and the doctors'
fees, and the funeral, and paying for a first-class grave. Still;
as she said. But fair was fair and right was right, and after all,
in <i>her</i> case, there wasn't any blood-tie, nor any real claim
on her: what she'd done she'd done solely out of
friendship.&mdash;But Uncle Jerry, he was poor, too; he'd only got
his salary from the Bank to live on, and that was no prince's, but
a damnably tight fit, with a wife to keep, and three children to
educate; and though he wouldn't go so far as to call Fanny
extravagant, yet they needed every penny he had to get along; and
if he now took on two fresh burdens, why, it simply couldn't be
done. Besides, there was Fanny to be considered, and it would come
damnably hard on Fanny; for it would mean she had to deny herself
every luxury&mdash;all those little comforts he was just beginning
to be able to allow her.</p>

<p>But here the eavesdropper's courage, smitten to the core, failed
him altogether. And not caring whether they heard him or not, how
loudly his boots scratched the flag-stones, he scrambled to his
feet and ran away. Behind the cactuses, which was the most secret
place he knew, he flung himself face downwards on the ground. His
heart was full to bursting. Nobody...<i>nobody</i> wanted them, him
or Luce, any more.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that, when the thunderbolt fell, he was as
unprepared for it as Luce herself.</p>

<p>("I leave it to you, Jerry, to tell 'em what we've fixed. I've
had my fill of it. It's been nothing but trying to din into them
what's <i>got</i> to be, ever since I'm here.")</p>

<p>Uncle Jerry came out into the garden and called him, and talked
a lot to him. Again about how sorry he was about Mamma, and how
he'd never stop missing her, even though he hadn't seen much of her
lately, through living so far away. But a sister was a sister. And
then, how she hadn't left any money behind to keep them, and what a
lot this was going to cost, and how times were so hard and money so
scarce that he'd barely got enough to pay for Aunt Fanny and his
own children. The extra expense would be a sad drain&mdash;though
of course he'd do it, for Mamma's sake. And ever so much more which
wasn't easy to understand.</p>

<p>Not till Uncle Jerry'd been talking for a long time did it get
plain what he really meant. Which was that he and Luce were not to
stay together <i>any</i> more. One of them was going to live with
Aunt Tilly, and one with Aunt Fanny.</p>

<p>The blow was so unexpected, so crushing, that, even if he'd been
able to <i>think</i> of anything to say, he couldn't have said it.
His throat sort of shut up. He just stood and stared at Uncle Jerry
without really seeing him.</p>

<p>But the next minute things began buzzing round in his head like
angry bees. Here were two more he'd never thought of. One was that,
even though they weren't able to stop with Bowey, they would not
both be going to live with Aunt Tilly. Or not allowed to be
together. (And of all the dreadful things that had happened, this
last was the worst.) Hurriedly he tried to think some thoughts
about Aunt Fanny. But he couldn't...because he didn't know her;
he'd never even seen her! He only knew Mamma didn't like her
<i>very</i> much; Mamma always said Aunt Fanny was jealous of her
for being Uncle Jerry's favourite sister. And how she'd always been
so expensive and extravagant, wanting the best of everything for
herself and the children, and poor Uncle Jerry having to slave and
slave, and never able to put by anything for a rainy day. But that
was all, and he didn't like it; and he simply couldn't
imagine...And suddenly, compared with this stranger, Aunt Tilly, in
spite of her rude, rough way of talking, became something to hold
on to, cling fast to&mdash;a very anchor of refuge&mdash;because
she'd known Mamma so well, and all about Papa.</p>

<p>None the less, he just couldn't bring it over his lips to beg:
"Have us both, oh, have us both!" For Aunt Tilly didn't want both
of them; and it was such a new and dreadful feeling not to be
wanted.</p>

<p>Instead, as the next best thing, he managed to say: "Oh, Aunt
Tilly, please, <i>please</i>, let Luce stop with you! I'll go to
Aunt Fanny."&mdash;His voice amazed him by coming out quite low and
bass, as he said it.</p>

<p>And Aunt Tilly wasn't at all unkind. She looked at him a minute,
and then said: "Now, Cuffy, now, my dear, you <i>must</i> be
reas'nable. You're not old enough yet to understand, even if I told
you all about it. But your uncle and me have gone into the whole
thing and talked it out, and this is the only way to fix it."</p>

<p>"But why?" (Some day he would have a real bass voice
altogether.)</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing, because your Aunt Fanny's only got little
<i>girls</i>, and won't be bothered looking after a boy."</p>

<p>"But why not? I'm...I'm all <i>right</i>," he gave back
desperately. "I wouldn't be a scrap of trouble&mdash;<i>I</i> can
wash and dress myself, and Luce can't...not always. And I don't
mind playing with little girls&mdash;truly I don't; I've always
played with Luce." And as Aunt Tilly still only went on shaking her
head, he cast about, once more, for words to describe Luce's
funninesses. "You see, she doesn't <i>know</i> Aunt Fanny and these
children. And she's so dreadfully shy, and when she is, she gets so
silly and frightened.&mdash;And...and then...I said I'd look after
her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you did. But in this world, my boy, it's not always
possible to stick to one's promises. You'll find that out as you go
on. Things happen of 'emselves and put a stopper on
it.&mdash;Anyhow, there it is. Your Aunt Fanny's mind's made up,
and nothing <i>I</i> can say will change it."</p>

<p>And as Cuffy still stood fixing her, she added: "It's no good
looking at me like that. I've done all I can&mdash;with money so
tight, and your Uncle a dead weight on my hands."</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> uncle?" (This was as rude as rude; for he knew
quite well who she meant.)</p>

<p>"Why, your Uncle Purdy, of course. Lies there like a log, and
'll never do a stroke of work again."</p>

<p>"He's not my uncle!" But, in saying it, his voice broke, and
that was the end of it.</p>

<p>Luce, oh, Luce!...his poor fat little cry-baby sister, who'd
never once been away from Mamma (or him; or Bowey.) The agony of
imagining what might happen to her was too much for him: he had to
go and do hard, <i>cruel</i> things (to a bird, to the piano.)
Never, never, he knew it now, had he been so fond of anybody as
Luce. Even Mamma being dead didn't seem to matter so much.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Uncle Jerry was starting home next morning; there was only
to-day left to tell Luce and get her ready.&mdash;But when they
did, it was the funniest thing: she didn't cry at all, no, not one
single drop. She just stood and gaped at them, with her mouth half
open, looking more of a silly than ever. And she stopped like
this&mdash;all day. Bowey said the shock had been too much for her,
and she didn't properly understand what was going on. And kept
saying: "Cry, my poor lamb, cry, it'll do you good." Herself she
cried like anything, while she was packing Luce's things in one of
Papa's little old leather portmanteaux. But Luce didn't seem to
mind, and stood staring at her clothes as if she didn't recognise
them; till he couldn't help it either, and went and hid, and howled
and howled. But not even when he took her to the summer-house and
said: "Never mind, Luce, just you wait. As soon as ever I've saved
up enough money I'll come and fetch you, and we'll run
away&mdash;somewhere where they'll never find us again." Even then
she only said: "Will you, Cuffy?"&mdash;just as if she didn't
really care, and though he swore it on his "finger wet."</p>

<p>Uncle Jerry had hired a buggy to drive over from the railway in,
because the coach was so slow; and now he had to drive it back.
Early next morning he went and fetched it; and Luce's box, with a
rope round it, because the lock wouldn't hold, was tied on behind.
Luce was just the same as yesterday, and let Bowey dress her
without a word&mdash;Bowey said it was like dressing a doll, for
she didn't do a thing for herself, and held out her fingers to have
her gloves put on as if she was a little baby. Then they kissed her
good-bye and she was lifted up and put in. But Uncle Jerry
remembered something he'd forgotten and got out again; and Luce sat
up there by herself in the buggy, with a face like underdone
pastry, all alone with the horse. She was most <i>dreadfully</i>
afraid of horses; and it gave him a pain right through him only to
look at her and think how afraid she was. Still, he went on doing
it; but she never once looked at him, or turned her head, or called
out good-bye...or anything. She just drove away.</p>

<p>Then his own turn came.</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock&mdash;the time he used to get home from
lessons. And Luce would be standing at the gate watching for him,
in her dirty pinny; and Bowey'd scold because he dropped his
satchel down anywhere; and Mamma be sitting in the office, wanting
to hear how he'd "done." Now, everybody was gone (Bowey, too)
except him. And the rooms were quite empty: after the auction men
had brought carts and taken away all the furniture. The house was
the only thing left.&mdash;And suddenly it came over him with a
rush that he simply couldn't leave it like this. And though Aunt
Tilly and the luggage was standing in the road, afraid of missing
the coach (though it had been <i>told</i> to fetch them!) he tore
back up the garden and hurriedly felt through his pockets. What was
the dearest thing he had? Why, his knife, of course; the new one
with three blades Mamma had given him last birthday, which he'd
been so proud of. Just for a second, it was so precious, he
wavered; then, making a hole, he put it in, pressed it down as far
as he could, and filled in the earth again...like a grave. It
wouldn't grow into anything; but it would always be there,
something to remember&mdash;something to remember them by.</p>

<p>The coach! And Aunt Tilly shouting like mad where was he.
Cleaning his hands on his seat, back he flew.&mdash;And now there
was a most awful fuss till the bags and boxes were arranged, and
counted, and they could climb in themselves. (Aunt Tilly was the
dreadfullest old fidget he'd ever known, and kept on asking the
driver if he was quite sure they'd catch the train, till he was
ashamed of her.)</p>

<p>They were the only passengers; and as soon as they'd got through
the township, she untied her bonnet-strings and put her feet up on
the cushions and went to sleep. Though she groaned each time the
coach gave a lurch or a bump. (In her sleep.) Very gingerly Cuffy
opened the window, which she'd shut because of the dust, and stood
at it, with his back to her, pretending to look out. He didn't want
her to see his face. For all of a sudden, as the last familiar
landmarks went by, something funny happened to him. The dreadful,
hot, <i>angry</i> feeling he'd had in his inside ever since he'd
heard Mamma was dead, and would never come back (it'd made him
angry with everybody and everything, Mamma, too:) well, now,
suddenly he didn't seem to feel angry any more; and, as he realised
it, the tears began to race down his cheeks, like mad, and without
him being able to do a thing to stop them. And they went on
running; and were so blazing hot that they burnt. He didn't make
the least little sound though. He'd rather have died than let Aunt
Tilly know.</p>

<p>But after a time, as tears will, they ran dry; and then, very
gradually, other and pleasanter thoughts insinuated themselves. The
coach. He always had liked travelling in a coach&mdash;specially if
there was heaps of room. And after the coach would come the train
(a train-journey nobody could help enjoying!) and then another
coach: it'd be far the longest journey he'd ever gone! And that
wasn't all. Aunt Tilly (oh gommy! she did look a sight when she
went to sleep) had once said something about a pony...for him to
ride to school on. Oh, perhaps, perhaps...even though he
<i>couldn't</i> like her, he thought she was a silly, common old
woman...oh, please, <i>please</i>, dear God, let there be a pony!
And let me soon see Luce again, let her come and live with Aunt
Tilly, too, and stop there, so as I can teach her how to ride. (As
he prayed, he saw himself leading a pretty brown horse, with Luce
sitting on it, and him telling her everything what she had to do.
And she wasn't a bit scared of it any more; because <i>he</i> was
there, and she knew he&mdash;) Ho! but that was wattles: yes, there
they came, a whole crowd of them, in full flower...he'd smelt them
before he saw them! And shutting his eyes, the better to drink in
the adored scent, he sniffed and sniffed, till the dust all but
choked him, and his head went giddy.</p>

<p>And, from now on, his spirits continued steadily to rise, hope
adding itself to hope, in fairy fashion, just as mile after mile
combined to stretch the gulf, that would henceforth yawn, between
what he had been, and what he was to be.</p>

<h2>Growing Pains. Sketches of Girlhood</h2>

<h3>The Bathe. A Grotesque</h3>

<p>Stripped of her clothing, the child showed the lovely shape of a
six-year-old. Just past the dimpled roundnesses of babyhood, the
little body stood slim and straight, legs and knees closely met,
the skin white as the sand into which the small feet dug, pink toe
faultlessly matched to toe.</p>

<p>She was going to bathe.</p>

<p>The tide was out. The alarming, ferocious surf, which at flood
came hurtling over the reef, swallowing up the beach, had
withdrawn, baring the flat brown coral rocks: far off against their
steep brown edges it sucked and gurgled lazily. In retreating, it
had left many lovely pools in the reef, all clear as glass, some
deep as rooms, grown round their sides with weeds that swam like
drowned hair, and hid strange sea-things.</p>

<p>Not to these pools might the child go; nor did she need to prick
her soles on the coral. Her bathing-place was a great
sandy-bottomed pool that ran out from the beach, and at its deepest
came no higher than her chin.</p>

<p>Naked to sun and air, she skipped and frolicked with the delight
of the very young, to whom clothes are still an encumbrance. And
one of her runs led her headlong into the sea. No toe-dipping tests
were necessary here; this water met the skin like a veil of warm
silk. In it she splashed and ducked and floated; her hair, which
had been screwed into a tight little knob, loosening and floating
with her like a nimbus. Tired of play, she came out, trickling and
glistening, and lay down in the sand, which was hot to the touch,
first on her stomach, then on her back, till she was coated with
sand like a fish bread-crumbed for frying. This, for the sheer
pleasure of plunging anew, and letting the silken water wash her
clean.</p>

<p>At the sight, the two middle-aged women who sat looking on grew
restless. And, the prank being repeated, the sand-caked little body
vanishing in the limpid water to bob up shining like ivory, the
tips of their tongues shot out and surreptitiously moistened their
lips. These were dry, their throats were dry, their skins itched;
their seats burned from pressing the hot sand.</p>

<p>And suddenly eyes met and brows were lifted in a silent
question. Shall we? Dare we risk it?</p>

<p>"Let's!"</p>

<p>For no living thing but themselves moved on the miles of
desolate beach; not a neighbour was within coo-ee; their own shack
lay hid behind a hill.</p>

<p>Straightway they fell to rolling up their work and stabbing it
with their needles.</p>

<p>Then they, too, undressed.</p>

<p>Tight, high bodices of countless buttons went first, baring the
massy arms and fat-creased necks of a plump maturity. Thereafter
bunchy skirts were slid over hips and stepped out of. Several
petticoats followed, the undermost of red flannel, with scalloped
edges. Tight stiff corsets were next squeezed from their moorings
and cast aside: the linen beneath lay hot and damply crushed. Long
white drawers unbound and, leg by leg, disengaged, voluminous
calico chemises appeared, draped in which the pair sat down to take
off their boots&mdash;buttoned boots&mdash;and stockings, their
feet emerging red and tired-looking, the toes misshapen, and horny
with callosities. Erect again, they yet coyly hesitated before the
casting of the last veil, once more sweeping the distance for a
possible spy. Nothing stirring, however, up went their arms,
dragging the balloon-like garments with them; and, inch by inch,
calves, thighs, trunks and breasts were bared to view.</p>

<p>At the prospect of getting water playmates, the child had
clapped her hands, hopping up and down where she stood. But this
was the first time she had watched a real grown-up undress; she was
always in bed and asleep when they did it. Now, in broad daylight,
she looked on unrebuked, wildly curious; and surprise soon damped
her joy. So this was what was underneath! Skirts and petticoats
down, she saw that laps were really legs; while the soft and cosy
place you put your head on, when you were tired...</p>

<p>And suddenly she turned tail and ran back to the pool. She
didn't want to see.</p>

<p>But your face was the one bit of you you couldn't put under
water. So she had to.</p>

<p>Two fat, stark-naked figures were coming down the beach.</p>

<p>They had joined hands, as if to sustain each other in their
nudity...or as if, in shedding their clothes, they had also shed a
portion of their years. Gingerly, yet in haste to reach cover, they
applied their soles to the tickly sand: a haste that caused
unwieldy breasts to bob and swing, bellies and buttocks to wobble.
Splay-legged they were, from the weight of these protuberances.
Above their knees, garters had cut fierce red lines in the skin;
their bodies were criss-crossed with red furrows, from the variety
of strings and bones that had lashed them in. The calves of one
showed purple-knotted with veins; across the other's abdomen ran a
deep, longitudinal scar. One was patched with red hair, one with
black.</p>

<p>In a kind of horrid fascination the child stood and stared...as
at two wild outlandish beasts. But before they reached her she
again turned, and, heedless of the prickles, ran seawards, out on
the reef.</p>

<p>This was forbidden. There were shrill cries of: "Naughty girl!
Come back!"</p>

<p>Draggingly the child obeyed.</p>

<p>They were waiting for her, and, blind to her hurt, took her
between them and waded into the water. When this was up to their
knees, they stooped to damp napes and crowns, and sluice their
arms. Then they played. They splashed water at each other's great
backsides; they lay down and, propped on their elbows, let their
legs float; or, forming a ring, moved heavily round to the tune of:
<i>Ring-a-ring-a-rosy, Pop Down a Posy!</i> And down the child
went, till she all but sat on the sand. Not so they. Even with the
support of the water they could bend but a few inches; and wider
than ever did their legs splay, to permit of their corpulences
being lowered.</p>

<p>But the sun was nearing meridian in a cloudless sky. Its rays
burnt and stung. The child was sent running up the beach to the
clothes-heaps, and returned, not unlike a depressed Amor, bearing
in each hand a wide, flower-trimmed, dolly-varden hat, the ribbons
of which trailed the sand.</p>

<p>These they perched on their heads, binding the ribbons under
their chins; and thus attired waded out to the deep end of the
pool. Here, where the water came a few inches above their waists,
they stood to cool off, their breasts seeming to float on the
surface like half-inflated toy balloons. And when the sand stirred
up by their feet had subsided, their legs could be seen through the
translucent water oddly foreshortened, with edges that frayed at
each ripple.</p>

<p>But a line of foam had shown its teeth at the edge of the reef.
The tide was on the turn; it was time to go.</p>

<p>Waddling up the beach they spread their petticoats, and on these
stretched themselves out to dry. And as they lay there on their
sides, with the supreme mass of hip and buttock arching in the air,
their contours were those of seals&mdash;great mother-seals come
lolloping out of the water to lie about on the sand.</p>

<p>The child had found a piece of dry cuttlefish, and sat
pretending to play with it. But she wasn't really. Something had
happened which made her not like any more to play. Something ugly.
Oh, never...never...no, not ever now did she want to grow up.
<i>She</i> would always stop a little girl.</p>

<h3>Three In A Row</h3>

<p>Miss Ethel marched ahead carrying the candle, and so cupping it
with her hand that the light fell full on her round, horn-rimmed
spectacles, making these look like gigantic eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, girls," said she, throwing open a door, "this is the
best I can do for you&mdash;every other room's full. But I know you
won't mind turning in together. May's such a shrimp that you can
put her between you and never know she's there."</p>

<p>Dutifully the three who followed at her heels chorused: "Oh, not
at all," "We shall manage," "Very good of you to have us, Miss
Ethel," as instructed by their respective Mammas.</p>

<p>But once the door had shut on their hostess they gathered round
the bed&mdash;a narrow half-tester&mdash;in which they were
expected to lie three in a row, and let their real feelings
out.</p>

<p>"The old toad! Playing us such a scurvy trick!"</p>

<p>"On such a hot night, tool"</p>

<p>"And when she wrote she'd have heaps of room!"</p>

<p>"It's those Waugh girls from Bendigo that 've done it.
<i>their</i> father's a judge! But anything's good enough for
us."</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't come," piped Patty, the youngest, a short, fat
girl of eleven.</p>

<p>"Oh, you!&mdash;with your bulk you're safe for the lion's share.
But what did the old hag mean by her cheek about me?" snapped May,
who had come to the age of desiring roundnesses. "A shrimp,
indeed!"</p>

<p>"Don't know I'm sure," said thirteen-year-old Tetta, not quite
truthfully. (May's was just a case of the "girls from Bendigo" over
again.) Tetta was getting rid of her clothes at top speed, peeling
off her stockings, leaving one here, one there, her combinations on
the floor where they fell. Then, holding her nightdress like a sail
above her, she shot her arms into the sleeves, and was ready for
bed while Patty was still conscientiously twisting a toothbrush
round her gums, and May had got no further than loosening the
buttons of her frock.</p>

<p>"Tetta!&mdash;you haven't done your teeth...or anything."</p>

<p>"Don't want to. And I'm giving my teeth a rest. A dentist told
some one I know it wore teeth out if you were always brushing
them," gave back Tetta easily.</p>

<p>The "Lazy Liar!" this evoked was cut through by her shrill: "Oh
Lord, girls, <i>feathers</i>!" as she stooped to examine the build
of the bed. A further discovery, however, Tetta kept to herself.
This was that the bed had a distinct slope, out from the centre and
down at the sides&mdash;she tried each in turn. And having let a
few seconds elapse, for fear the others had noticed her wrigglings,
she said mildly: "Look here, Mabs, if you like I'll take the
middle. I don't mind being a bit crushed."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you don't!" retorted May suspiciously, suspending her
hair-brush. "I know what it means, my dear...when you're so willing
to oblige." May was ratty with herself for being
behind-hand&mdash;even that stupid Pat had raced her. But to go to
bed <i>properly</i> meant almost as much work as getting up in the
morning.</p>

<p>"Well, for goodness' sake, put some biff into it. The mean bit
of candle she's given us won't last for ever.</p>

<p>"No, I promised my mother to brush my hair twenty times every
night and morning, and I'm not going to break my word for anyone,"
said May dourly; and pounded away with upraised arm. At which young
Patty, who in her efforts to come in second had rather scamped the
prescribed "folding" of her clothes, suffered a pang of conscience,
and turned back to refold them. But Tetta thought: though she
brushed it a hundred times it would never be anything but bristly.
Yes, that was just what it was like the bristles in a brush.</p>

<p>Now she and Pat lay stretched out, a sheet drawn over them, a
hump of feathers between. Oh, it was a shabby pretence at a
"double"&mdash;why, there was really hardly room for two. And when
at last May came to join them&mdash;she had gargled her throat and
cleaned her nails (just as if she was going to a party)&mdash;the
rumpus began.</p>

<p>For Tetta said: "Blow out the candle first." This stood on the
dressing-table, and it would have fallen to her, who lay on that
side, to rise and extinguish it. May, the goose, doing as she was
told, had then to climb over and in between them in the dark. There
was a moment of wild confusion: dozens of legs, a whole army of
them, seemed to be trampling and kicking in an attempt to sort
themselves out. Tetta had taken a grip of the head-curtain, and so
kept her balance, but Patty, unprepared, found nothing to hold to
on the bare side of the bed, and, as May finally and determinedly
squeezed herself in, slid to the floor with a cry and a thump.</p>

<p>"You pig!" from Tetta. "You did that on purpose."</p>

<p>"Well, what next I wonder!...after you two had taken all the
room. Anyhow, now you'll just <i>have</i> to get up and make a
light again."</p>

<p>Grumblingly Tetta swung out her feet and groped her unknown way.
"Now where has that table gone to? Oh, <i>damn</i>!" For, coming
suddenly and unexpectedly upon it, her elbow caught the candlestick
and sent this flying. There was a crash; and the candle could be
heard rolling over the bare boards.</p>

<p>"Now you've done it, you clumsy ass! Ten to one old Ethel 'll
come pouncing in on us."</p>

<p>"If I get a bit of china in my foot it'll be me who pounces."
Tetta was on her knees, cautiously fumbling for the matches. These
found and one struck, the candle was recovered; but the candlestick
lay in fragments.</p>

<p>"Spill some grease on the floor and stick the candle to it,"
suggested May.</p>

<p>With some difficulty Tetta contrived this hold, clutching her
nightgown to her out of reach of the flame. Then she crossed to the
other side of the bed to see to Patty, who still lay where she had
fallen, snivelling over a bruised arm and a hefty bump on the
forehead.</p>

<p>As there was no butter handy, Tetta poured water into the basin,
soaked a sponge and held it to the wounded place, to keep it from
swelling&mdash;and over this the floor got rather wet and messy,
for the half-burnt, guttering candle, some three inches high, shed
its meagre circlet Of light only on the opposite side of the
room&mdash;then prodded the bruised arm to try for a broken bone.
Patty was <i>quite</i> sure she had.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Pat, it's only been your funny-bone," and Tetta rose
to her feet.</p>

<p>But the sight of May sprawling meanwhile at her ease in the
centre of the bed was too much for her. "It's all your greedy
fault, pushing and shoving like that so that you can lie on your
back. Well, you can't! There's only one way to lie and that's
spoons&mdash;on our same sides. Now then, Pat!"</p>

<p>But Pat whimpered, if she had to sleep on the outside she'd
never sleep at all, she'd always be expecting the whole night to
fall out again. She'd rather lie on the floor.</p>

<p>"Well, why not? That's quite a good idea," struck in May
brightly. "Then we should all have room."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't, Pat," said Tetta emphatically, with another glance
at May's luxurious recumbency. "At least not if you don't want
tarantulas crawling over you in the night...and perhaps centipedes,
too. There's sure to be squads about this dirty old house."</p>

<p>Before she finished speaking, Patty had leapt on to the bed, her
bare feet drawn up out of danger's way.</p>

<p>"Now then Mabs milady, shunt! You've just <i>got</i> to let her
in the middle. Are you ready?"&mdash;and with the same breath Tetta
puffed out the candle and sprang to secure what little space was
left.</p>

<p>With due care they arranged themselves, back fitted to front;
and for a few seconds, tightly wedged though they were, it seemed
as if there might be peace.</p>

<p>Then May said: "My mother always says it's dangerous to go to
sleep on your left-hand side. It makes your heart swell up. And you
could die in the night."</p>

<p>There was a faint squeal from Patty. "Here, let me...I'm not
going to"&mdash;and the bed rocked under her determined efforts to
turn to her right.</p>

<p>"Well, if she does, we've all got to. <i>are</i> you ready?"
sighed Tetta once more.</p>

<p>Gingerly and in unison they heaved.</p>

<p>But: "Tetta, you've taken every bit of sheet!" from May.</p>

<p>"I haven't!"</p>

<p>"You have!" And the sheet, reduced to a rope, was tugged
violently to and fro. "If you think I'm going to lie with my back
all bare...It's bad enough to have it hanging out over the
edge."</p>

<p>"The answer to that is, you shouldn't have such a big
behind."</p>

<p>"It's not! I haven't!" cried May, justly indignant. "It's not a
scrap bigger than your own. Now if you had Pat's running into you,
you <i>might</i> talk! Her's is simply enormous; it reaches down to
my legs."</p>

<p>"Oh, it <i>doesn't</i>!" wailed Patty, on the verge of tears
again. "It's <i>not</i> true&mdash;it's <i>not</i> enormous."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, you blubberer! What's it matter if it is?" snapped
Tetta, losing patience. "And anyhow the Turks admire them." But the
Turks were heathens, and Patty was not consoled. She lay chewing
over her injuries, to which another was now added: "It's no
good...I simply can't...I'm suffocating," she said in a weak voice.
"My head's right down in the crack between the pillows. I haven't
<i>any</i> of my own."</p>

<p>"Here, take half mine," said Tetta, and shoved it towards her.
May, who liked a pillow to herself, gave hers a hasty pull, which
over-shot the mark. Down and out it slid, she, attempting a rescue,
after it. "Ooh! I'm standing in water. The whole floor's
swimming."</p>

<p>Said Tetta when order was once more restored: "The only thing to
do 'll be to hold on. Here. Pat, you put your arm over me and round
my stomach, and May hers round you. That's it."</p>

<p>In her case it answered. But May, seeking an extra firm grip,
was unlucky enough to let her fingers stray on Patty's front, and
this was too much for the fat girl, who was ticklish. She began to
squirm, and the more May tried to hold her fast the more she
wriggled, screwing herself up, defending her middle with arms and
elbows, fighting with her knees, all to the accompaniment of a
shrill and unconquerable giggle.</p>

<p>The result was that May and Tetta found themselves standing one
on each side of the bed.</p>

<p>"You'll have to take the fool round her bally neck."</p>

<p>"Well, then I shall probably strangle her in her sleep," said
May darkly as she climbed in again.</p>

<p>They linked themselves anew, and once more there was a brief
spell of drowsy silence.</p>

<p>But it was, oh, such a hot night, and before long, out of the
heat and the darkness, May's voice was heard in a distracted: "But
Pat!...you're all wet."</p>

<p>"I'm not, oh, I'm <i>not</i>!" tragically protested the one thus
accused. Called abruptly back from a half-slumber, her mind in its
confusion had jumped to the day of infant peccadilloes.</p>

<p>"Idiot! I didn't mean that. But we're simply sticking together
like melting jellies."</p>

<p>"And oh, I do want a drink so, dreadfully badly! I think I'll
die soon if I don't have one," moaned Patty.</p>

<p>"That comes of being so fat.&mdash;Fetch her one, Mabs," ordered
Tetta, stifling the girlish equivalent of an oath, as she applied
yet another match to the stub of candle.</p>

<p>But May tilted the jug in vain. "I believe yes, you
<i>have</i>!...you've used up every drop. Well, Tetta Riley, if you
don't deserve to come to want some day!"</p>

<p>"There couldn't have been more than a cupful to start with. I
suppose the tank's going dry. Besides, who cleaned their teeth I'd
like to know?&mdash;Well, Pat, there's nothing else for it, you'll
have to suck the sponge."</p>

<p>And this Patty did, to the encouraging remark from Tetta that it
was only her own dirt she was eating.</p>

<p>But the problem of sleep had become a very real one. And the
night seemed to grow hotter with every minute that passed.</p>

<p>Here Tetta had a new idea: they should try one of them lying
crossways at the foot. Yes...that was all very well...but which?
And over this there ensued a wordy dispute. Patty was too fat;
she'd stick out too much...besides being so hot to put your feet
against. Tetta, on the other hand, or so she argued, was too tall:
"My head'd hang over one side, my legs the other." No, it must be
May or no one, and sourly and unwillingly the victim dragged
herself to the bottom of the bed and lay athwart it. But she
couldn't possibly sleep without a pillow...what was she to. do for
a pillow?</p>

<p>"Why, make a bundle of your clothes and ram them under your
head."</p>

<p>"My clothes? That I've got to wear to-morrow? All crumpled and
creased? Think I see myself!"</p>

<p>"Oh very well then, take mine! Thank the Lord I'm not such a
darned old fad as you." And by the last flicker of the dying
candle, Tetta darted round the room, redeeming her scattered
undergarments, her skirt, her petticoat...and not omitting her
prickly suspenders.</p>

<p>"There. Now turn over so that you face the foot."</p>

<p>"No, I mustn't do that. It'd mean lying on my left side."</p>

<p>"What tommy-rot! Not if you put your blinking head the other way
round!" cried Tetta in exasperation.</p>

<p>But this May could not be got to see; or else she would not see
it; and, by now both dog-tired and half-silly for want of sleep,
they barked and bit their way through what gradually deteriorated
into a kind of geometrical wrangle, and ended by Tetta snarling:
"It's easy to see <i>you've</i> never done any Euclid!"</p>

<p>This was a spiteful thrust; for May had failed at close of term
to get her remove, and so to reach a class in which she, too, would
have been held capable of writing <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>.
And ordinarily, for decency's sake, you did not allude to her
misfortune. But to-night bonds were loosed.</p>

<p>After this a silence fell...but not the silence of peace. May,
galled to the quick, lay revolving a means of revenge.</p>

<p>Presently to ejaculate: "Oh, Tetta...oh, your feet!...take them
away...oh, <i>puh</i>!"</p>

<p>"What the...what in the name of Christmas do you mean by that?
When I have had two baths today! day!"</p>

<p>"Then all I can say is, your <i>shoes</i> must be high!"</p>

<p>In answer to this, involuntarily, but very fiercely, the
libelled foot shot out in a straight kick. It landed on May's
nose&mdash;the soft and gristly part that is so tender. With a
scream May sat up and clapped her hands to it, and now, thoroughly
hurt and unnerved, fell to sobbing: "Oh, my nose, my nose! You've
broken it, you beast&mdash;you dirty beast! It's bleeding I can
feel the blood dripping from it."</p>

<p>Yet another of the precious matches went in verifying this. True
enough a few drops of blood <i>were</i> oozing, and the upper lip
had had a nasty jab against the top teeth. Once more the sponge was
requisitioned, and its last remaining moisture squeezed from.</p>

<p>In compensation for her injuries May now demanded to be allowed
to occupy Tetta's place at the head of the bed.</p>

<p>"Wait. First I'm going to find out what the time is. We seem to
have been here for years. It must surely be nearly morning now;"
and with this, Tetta opened the door and crept on tiptoe into the
passage, where a clock hung.</p>

<p>Returning, she said hoarsely and dramatically: "Look here, you
two, it's not even half-past twelve yet! There's still six blooming
hours before we can get up...can possibly get up. And the candle's
done, and there's no more water, and only two matches left. I'm fed
up to the neck...I can't stick it a minute longer. I'm going
out."</p>

<p>"Going out? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Where to? What for?"</p>

<p>"What do you think? On the verandah, of course. To get cool.
This room's as hot as...yes, as hot as <i>hell</i>...when you come
back into it."</p>

<p>"Tetta Riley!...your language! If only my mother could hear
you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, bing, bang and bung your mother! I'm sick of the very sound
of her."</p>

<p>"I'll tell her every word you've said."</p>

<p>"Oh, go to&mdash;to Sunday School!"</p>

<p>"I do. And I will. And I'll tell them, too. And you can just
<i>get</i> out on your old verandah, and stop there. It'll be jolly
good riddance to bad rubbish."</p>

<p>"I'm going. But you're coming, too. Think I mean to leave you
two snoring here while I kick my heels outside? Oh, no, my dears,
not me! Up you get and double-quick! Both of you."</p>

<p>And meekly, without a further word, the two so commanded obeyed.
For when Tetta, the easy-going, spoke like this&mdash;in what was
known as her "strong-minded" voice&mdash;they were her humblest
servants. Nor did they resent her mastery. Patty the sheep
invariably trotted tail-down after her elders; but May, for all her
spirit, was at heart Tetta's devoted crony; and as a rule each made
a friendly allowance for the other's failings: a slommicky laziness
on the one hand, an ultra-prim exactitude on the other.</p>

<p>Now, at Tetta's direction, skirts were slipped over
night-dresses, jackets buttoned on top. And turning their backs on
the hideously crumpled battlefield of the bed, they spread a
blanket on the verandah's edge, laid pillows and bolster on this,
and stretched themselves out, three in a row, with a sheet atop of
them.</p>

<p>Oh! the relief it was, to escape from those fondly clinging
feathers, those steep, sloping sides. Hard the boards might be, as
hard as your own bones, but they were at least dead level. Besides
that, you were free from the heat of your neighbour's body, and
could toss and turn as you chose.</p>

<p>The sweetness, too, of the summer-night air, after the
shut-upness of the stuffy room. Pat, who had staggered tipsily in
her companions' wake, drew but a couple of full breaths and was
fast asleep. May, correctly arranged on her right side, took
longer: privately, she thought what they were doing not quite
<i>nice</i>, and wondered what her mother would say when told of
it.</p>

<p>But Tetta lay wakeful. For one thing, it was so light. Not from
the moon, for there wasn't any; it was the stars that did it. The
sky was as thick with stars as...well, she who lived on the
seaboard had never seen anything like this bush sky: it was just as
if some one had taken diamonds by the handful, no, the bucketful,
and flung them out without caring&mdash;hundreds and thousands of
diamonds, all sharp and white and glittering, with hardly an inch
of space between, and what there was, gone a pale dove-grey.</p>

<p>"Oh, gosh, what tons! I never knew there <i>were</i> so many
stars, did you?"</p>

<p>But there was no reply. So she just lay there, with her hands
clasped under her neck, and stared up at the sky till her eyes
smarted. And then something else came into her head&mdash;a
familiar thought, and one she often amused herself with. It had to
do with her own identity. Did there, she was given to wondering,
somewhere or anywhere on earth exist a replica of herself? Was
there, hidden away in some corner of the globe, another girl called
Tetta Riley, thirteen years old, with a stub nose with freckles on
it, and all her other little funniosities, who had grown up as she
grew up, and who felt and thought like her? Herself, finding it
hard to believe in her own uniqueness, she was inclined to think
there might, there must be; and when, as now, she had nothing
better to do, she would send her mind round the world in a fanciful
search after her second self. To-night, in face of this starry
splendour, she let it stray to what she believed to be "other
worlds," as well, chasing her thought among the stars and planets
and the Milky Way, leaping from star to star...over gaps of palest
grey...till her head spun, her eyes dazzled; and sleep, descending,
gathered her too into the fold.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Canter</h3>

<p>Peggy's hair was so thick that she had to wear it in two plaits
instead of one; so long that when she sat down and let these fall
over her shoulders, their ends curled up in her lap. Nell, whose
own hair hung lank and short about her neck, was never tired of
playing with them, pushing a finger in and out between twists so
sleek and smooth that they felt like a rope come alive.</p>

<p>The two girls were in their favourite place, the hay-loft. For
here, if you pulled the ladder up after you, nobody could follow
you; though you could see what was going on in the yard below: the
men with the horses and carts, or customers taking a short cut to
the shop. But you were quite safe from the other girls; and that
was what she and Peg wanted&mdash;to be alone together. The others
teased so that it made you simply furious. F'r instance, once when
Peggy said she'd ever so much rather have had fair hair than dark,
and she, Nell, cried out at her, the other girls pulled faces, and
winked, and turned their eyes up to heaven till you could have
killed them.</p>

<p>Here, she and Peg sat with their behinds burrowed into the hay,
most comfortable, and all alone.</p>

<p>To-day was rather a special day; for Nell had something in her
blazer-pocket so secret and important that it almost burned her
through the stuff. This was a present for Peggy, and...well, now
the moment to give it had come, she was feeling just a teeny bit
uneasy. How dreadful if Peg didn't like it&mdash;after all the
trouble she had had to buy it. Her pocket-money&mdash;she got
threepence a week, got it honestly, not like one girl they knew,
who sometimes sneaked a threepenny-bit from her father's till,
under the old bookkeeper's nose. Well, for three whole weeks now,
she, Nell, hadn't spent a penny of <i>her</i> threepence (instead
of at once blueing it on chocs; she'd almost forgotten what they
tasted like) and with her savings she'd bought Peggy...a
hair-slide. Ninepence-halfpenny the exact price was, and she'd been
fairly stuck how to raise the extra halfpenny without waiting
another week. In the end, there had been nothing for it but to
pinch a stamp from her father's desk, and sell it.</p>

<p>This slide was now in her pocket, neatly wrapped in fine tissue
paper. But the longer it stayed there the more unsure she grew. The
point was, it was intended for a place on Peggy's head...well, for
the one piece of her that wasn't <i>quite</i> as pretty as the
rest. This was at the back of her neck where the plaits went off,
each on its own side. They seemed to leave such a big gap of white
skin showing...perhaps because they were so dark themselves. Peggy
of course didn't know this&mdash;you couldn't see yourself
behind&mdash;but she, Nell, did; and every time the patch caught
her eye, it gave her a slight stab that there should be
<i>anything</i> about Peg that wasn't quite perfect. Once, too,
she'd heard Madge Brennan make a simply horrid remark about people
who went bald very young. Peggy didn't understand; but she did, and
bled for her. It was then she'd made up her mind to get the
slide.</p>

<p>Another worrying thing was that she'd been lured away from the
plain, useful one she had gone into the shop meaning to buy, and
had taken one set with...diamonds. Not <i>real</i> diamonds, of
course; but they looked just like it. And now she was afraid Peggy
might think it too showy for everyday. And not know how to explain
it either to her dreadfully big family of brothers and sisters,
most of them older than her. They said such rude things sometimes.
And her mother, too. One evening when she, Nell, had been waiting
in the rightaway, hoping yes, truly, only <i>hoping</i> Peggy would
be allowed out again after tea, the mother, a great big fat woman
with an apron over her stomach, had opened the window and called
out: "Now then, Nellie Mackensen, just you be off! I won't have you
always hanging about here at mealtimes." As if she wanted their old
tea! Her own mother said Peggy's mother was cross because there
were so many of them and she'd so much to do. But it did make you
rather wonder what she'd say to the diamonds. (Perhaps she'd throw
them out of the window.) Oh dear, things were most frightfully
complicated. It would have' been much better, she saw it now, if
she'd bought, say, a nice little diary-book, that Peggy could have
carried in her pocket.</p>

<p>But she hadn't. And the slide was there. Faint-heartedly she
drew it forth.</p>

<p>Peggy, who had been talking all the time&mdash;Peg's pretty
mouth was always either talking or laughing&mdash;spotted the
little parcel at once and said: "Hullo, what's that,&mdash;For me?
A present for me? Truly? Let's see! Oh, Nell, you dear!...a
brooch...just exactly what I've wanted."</p>

<p>Nell felt herself go red as a beetroot. "Well, no, not a
<i>brooch</i>, Peg," she said in a small voice. "It's a...it's for
your hair...behind...a hair-slide."</p>

<p>Peggy's enthusiasm fizzled out. "A slide?" she echoed
disappointedly. "But&mdash;what for? Wherever could I wear a
slide?"</p>

<p>The fatal moment had come. Nell swallowed hard. "Why, I
thought...you see, I thought it would look most awfully nice, Peg,
if you...put it on at the back...I mean on your neck where the hair
leaves off."</p>

<p>But all Peggy said, and as disbelievingly as before, was: "On my
<i>neck</i>? Gracious! I should never be able to make it stick.
Besides, every time I move my head it 'ud run into me."</p>

<p>"Then you don't like it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it's all right. But whatever made you think of a
slide, Nell?" pressed Peggy, and reflected peevishly: just fancy
going and buying a thing like that, when there are such squads of
things I really do want.</p>

<p>Nell's voice was abject with apology as she replied: "Well, you
know, Peg darling, I've always meant to give you
something&mdash;something private...for yourself...from me.
And&mdash;But oh, you don't like it, I can see you don't," and her
lips began to tremble.</p>

<p>"Of course I do, silly! But what I'm asking you is, <i>why</i> a
hair-slide?" persisted Peggy, with a doggedness of which only she
was capable.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it: the truth had to come out. "Well...I
don't think you know, Peg, but&mdash;well, just at the back of
you...where there isn't any more hair...just there, it sometimes
looks so bare."</p>

<p>Now it was Peggy's turn to crimson. Very angrily. "<i>What</i>?
So that's it, is it? I suppose what you mean to say is I'm going
bald?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, no, indeed I don't...I <i>don't</i>...mean
<i>any</i>thing like that."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't believe you. And I think you're simply
horrid."</p>

<p>"I <i>don't</i>! It wasn't me at all. It was Madge
Brennan&mdash;I heard her...say something. And I thought...oh, I
thought..." But here Nell fairly broke down and put her knuckles to
her eyes.</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i>? Madge Brennan? That pig-eyed sausage? Said that
about me? That I was getting bald? Well, of all the <i>filthy</i>
cheek!" And, everything else forgotten over the personal injury,
Peggy went off into one of her hard white rages, when you might as
well have tried to melt a stone. "Oh, I'll pay her out for it, I'll
pay her out!"</p>

<p>Nell's cheeks were beginning to get a gloss on them with tears.
"Oh, now...you're so mad...you can only think about her. And when I
haven't spent a penny&mdash;I mean I haven't tasted a
choc&mdash;not for donkey's years. I've done nothing but save and
save. But you don't care...you don't care a bit."</p>

<p>But Peggy had been too badly stung to resist stinging in her
turn. "Well, if you must know, I think it was perfectly ridiklous
doing all that, just to buy something so&mdash;so <i>rude</i>. Why
not find out first what I really wanted?&mdash;instead of listening
to Madge Brennan. That's not how to give a present...to somebody
you make out to be fond of. Oh, I say, hang it, don't bellow like
that!" For Nell had flung herself face-downwards in the hay, and
was sobbing convulsively. All her money gone; and Peggy offended
and furious. She hadn't meant to say one word about the baldness:
it had just been dragged out of her. "And now you'll never, never
forgive me!"</p>

<p>"Rot. Though I don't know if I'll ever be able to like you
<i>quite</i> so much again. As for this, of course I'll keep it;
but it'll have to stay in a drawer. I'd sooner be hung than wear
it, as long as <i>that</i> putty-faced Jane's about!" said Peggy,
and gave the slide such a vicious jerk that it fell to the floor.
But even as she spoke she was wondering if, since she had prepared
the way for its disappearance, she couldn't exchange it on the sly
for something else. What about a nice silk handkerchief, with a
coloured border, to be worn in the breast-pocket of her blazer?</p>

<p>"But not altogether, Peg?&mdash;you won't leave off caring
altogether?" wept the gift-giver, callous now to any but the deeper
issue. "For oh, I do love you so."</p>

<p>"No, of course, not altogether." But Peggy wasn't really
thinking what she said; for she didn't stop to swallow before she
added, in a kind of stiff, iron voice: "I shall make my mother buy
me a hair-restorer right away."</p>

<p>(Oh, why hadn't <i>she</i> thought of this?) "But you don't need
it, truly you don't, Peg, it's as thick as thick...all over,"
moaned Nell, now only too eager to perjure herself. "It's just the
loveliest hair that ever was."</p>

<p>"Oh, get out! You only <i>say</i> that: you don't mean it."</p>

<p>"Honest Injun I do! And I wouldn't tell you a lie. For I love
you better than anybody in the world."</p>

<p>"More than your mother? Or father?"</p>

<p>"Much more. And there isn't anything I wouldn't do for you, word
of honour there isn't!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, I tell you what. You take this thing back where you
got it, and make them give you something, else instead."</p>

<p>At the cruel suggestion Nell's heart dropped to her boots. "Oh,
Peg!" she wailed, feebly, imploringly.</p>

<p>"There you are! Didn't I say it was all words?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't...I...I <i>will</i> do it!" (Though her
little-girl courage shrivelled to the size of a pea, at the thought
of facing Mr. Massey the draper over his counter: he had a long
angry kind of black beard, and great round spectacles, that gave
him enormous fish eyes.) "But then...oh, Peg, then you will like me
again, won't you?&mdash;as much as before. And like to come up
here. You do, don't you? You'd rather be here than <i>any</i>where
else?"</p>

<p>"Well, do it first, and then I'll say. But listen! That's
somebody calling. Oh, Nell, it's Rex&mdash;the new man. Come on,
let's go. He jumps us."</p>

<p>A bass voice shouted: "Now then, you two, what are you up to up
there? Oblige me by letting that ladder down at once!"</p>

<p>They hastened to obey, lowering the ladder by its ropes. Then
themselves crawled through the trapdoor and climbed down backwards,
Peggy leading, fastidiously mindful of her skirts. But when they
reached the last rung, some way short of the ground, they faced
about to meet two long arms, two big hairy hands, which, gripping
each twelve-year-old securely round the middle, swung her high
before setting her on her feet. Carelessly now the short skirts
fluttered and ballooned.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rex, one more&mdash;<i>just</i> one!" coaxed Peggy. And up
again she flew.</p>

<p>But at the sight of Nell's swollen eyes and blistery-looking
cheeks, the man rubbed the tip of his nose with a finger.</p>

<p>"Hullo! what have you been doing to her? Quarrelling, eh?"</p>

<p>Peggy made her sauciest face, wrinkling her nose, sticking out
her chin, showing the tip of her little pink tongue. "Who asks no
questions gets told no lies!"</p>

<p>"Eh? What? What's that?" and with a laugh Rex dived to catch
her. She skipped from his reach, there was a chase, a scuffle, and
then for the third time up she went. "There!&mdash;that's for you,
you little flirt, you!"</p>

<p>Deftly twisting the curls that served her in place of
hair-ribbons, Peggy turned, once she and Nell were out of earshot,
and said, in her most innocent tones: "I can't think <i>why</i> he
called me a flirt, can you?"</p>

<p>Now the correct answer, the wished-for and expected answer was:
because you are one. But, though Nell knew this quite well, and at
any other time would have given it, partly to please Peg, partly
because it made her happy to see Peg happy, to-day she was too numb
to care. So her only reply was a flat and toneless: "No."</p>

<p>Deeply aggrieved, Peggy threw her a side-glance which stood for:
oh, very well, my lady! and at once ran on, glibly and
enthusiastically: "I <i>do</i> like Rex, don't you?&mdash;better
than any of the other men. He's got such positively gorgeous
eyes&mdash;they look as if they could never stop laughing. He's so
strong, too; just like a lion&mdash;I believe he could fight lions
with his hands. (I say, <i>did</i> you see the hairs on them?) And
when he jumps you, it makes you feel as if you're never going to
come down again&mdash;and don't want to.&mdash;Well, I must hop it,
or I'll be late for tea. Now, don't <i>forget</i>&mdash;what you
promised.'bye."</p>

<p>"'bye," said Nell limply, and went on walking by herself, heavy
of heart and leg. Oh yes, she liked Rex, too, he was so kind and
jolly you couldn't help it; even though she didn't show off before
him, or put on airs so's to make him notice her. But
Peggy&mdash;well, there were times...and this was one of
them...when she felt that she didn't love Peg a bit&mdash;no, not
the least little tiny bit. Love her? She <i>simply hated</i>
her.</p>

<h3>Conversation in a Pantry</h3>

<p>It was no use, she simply could not sleep. She had tried lying
all sorts of ways: with the blanket pulled over her or the blanket
off; with her knees doubled up to her chin or stretched so straight
that her feet nearly touched the bottom of the bed; on her back
with her hands under her neck, or with her face burrowed in the
pillow. Nothing helped. Going on in her she could still feel the
bumps and lurches of the coach in which she had ridden most of that
day. Then the log that had been smouldering in the brick fireplace
burnt away in the middle, and collapsed with a crash; and the two
ends, rolling together, broke into flames again. These threw
shadows which ran about the ceiling, and up and down the white
walls, like strange animals.</p>

<p>She was spending the night with Alice, and they had had a fire
"just for luxury," and had sat by it for nearly an hour before
going to bed. It would be her last chance of anything like that,
Alice said: in schools, you never had fires, and all lights went
out to the minute. And their talk had been fearfully interesting.
For Alice was in love&mdash;she was over seventeen&mdash;and had
told her about it just as if she was grown up, too; looking into
the fire with ever such a funny little smile, and her blue eyes
quite small behind their thick, curly lashes.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you wish we could see into the future, Trix? And what
it's going to bring us?"</p>

<p>But though she said yes, she wasn't sure if she did, really; she
liked surprises better. Besides, all the last part of the time
Alice talked, she had been screwing up her courage to put a
question. But she hadn't managed to get it out. And that was one
reason why now she couldn't sleep.</p>

<p>With a fresh toss, she sighed gustily. And, where her tumblings
and fidgetings had failed, this sound called her companion back
from the downy meadows.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, child? Aren't you asleep yet?"</p>

<p>"No, I simply can't."</p>

<p>Alice sat up in bed, and shook her hair back from her face.
"You're over-excited. Try a drink of water."</p>

<p>"I have. I've drunk it all up."</p>

<p>"Then you must be hungry."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I am perhaps...a little."</p>

<p>"Come on then, let's forage." And throwing back the sheet, the
elder girl slid her feet to the floor.</p>

<p>One tall white figure, one short, they opened the door and
stepped out on the verandah.</p>

<p>Here it was almost as bright as day; for the moon hung like a
round cheese in the sky, and drenched everything with its light.
Barefoot they pattered, the joins in the verandah floor-boards,
which had risen, cutting into their soles. Had they to pass open
windows, dark holes in which people lay sleeping, Alice laid a
finger on her lips. From one of these came the sound of
snores&mdash;harsh snores of the chromatic kind, which went up the
scale and down, over and over again, without a pause.</p>

<p>Turning a corner, they stepped off the verandah and took a few
steps on hard pebbly ground. Inside the pantry, which was a large
outhouse, there were sharp contrasts of bluish-white moonlight and
black shadows.</p>

<p>Swiftly Alice skimmed the familiar shelves. "Here's lemon
cheese-cakes...and jam tarts...and ginger-snaps...and pound cake.
But I can't start you on these, or you'd be sick." And cutting a
round off a home-made loaf, she spread it thickly with dairy
butter, topped by a layer of quince jelly. "There, that's more
wholesome."</p>

<p>Oh, had anything ever tasted so delicious? as this slice eaten
at dead of night. Perched on an empty, upturned kerosene-tin, the
young girl munched and munched, holding her empty hand outspread
below, lest the quivering jelly glide over the crust's edge.</p>

<p>Alice took a cheese-cake and sat down on a lidded basket. "I
say, <i>did</i> you hear Father? Oh, Trix, wouldn't it be
positively too awful if one discovered <i>afterwards</i>, one had
married a man who snored?"</p>

<p>The muncher made no answer: the indelicacy of the question
stunned her: all in the dark as she was, she felt her face flame.
And yet...was this not perhaps the very chance she had been waiting
for? If Alice could say such a thing, out loud, without
embarrassment...Hastily squeezing down her last tit-bit&mdash;she
felt it travel, over-large, the full length of her gullet&mdash;she
licked her jellied fingers clean and took the plunge.</p>

<p>"Dallie, there's something I...I want to ask you
something...something I want to know."</p>

<p>"Fire away!" said Alice, and went on nibbling at the
pastry-edging that trimmed her tartlet.</p>

<p>"Yes. But...well, I don't quite...I mean I...</p>

<p>"Like that, is it? Wait a tick," and rather more rapidly than
she had intended, Alice bolted her luscious circle of lemon-cheese,
picked up her basket and planted it beside the tin. "Now then."</p>

<p>Shut away in this outhouse, the young girl might have cried her
words aloud. But leaning over till she found the shell of her
friend's ear, she deposited them safely inside. Alice, who was
ticklish, gave an involuntary shudder. But as the sense of the
question dawned on her, she sat up very stiff and straight, and
echoed perturbed: "<i>How</i>? Oh, but Kid, I'm not sure&mdash;not
at all sure&mdash;whether you ought to know. At your age!" said
seventeen to thirteen.</p>

<p>"But I must, Dallie."</p>

<p>"But why, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Because of something Ruth said."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ruth!" said Alice scornfully. "Trust Ruth for saying the
wrong thing. What was it?"</p>

<p>"Why, that...now I was growing up...was as good as grown up...I
must take care, for...for fear...But, Dallie, how can I?...if I
don't know?" This last question came out with a rush, and with a
kind of click in the throat.</p>

<p>"Well, well! I always have felt sorry for you children, with no
mother but only Ruth to bring you up&mdash;and she for ever
prinking before her glass. But you know you'll be perfectly safe at
school, Trix. They'll look after you, never fear!"</p>

<p>But there was more to, come.</p>

<p>It was Ella, it seemed, Ella Morrison, who was two years older
than her, who'd begun it. She'd said her mother said now she
mustn't let the boys kiss her any more.</p>

<p>"And you have, eh?"</p>

<p>Trixie's nod was so small that it had to be guessed at.
Haltingly, word by word, the story came out. It had been at
Christmas, at a big party, and they were playing games. And she and
some others, all boys, had gone off to hide from the rest, and
they'd climbed into the hay-loft, Harry MacGillivray among them;
and she rather liked Harry, and he liked her, and the other boys
knew it and had teased them. And then they said he wasn't game to
kiss her and dared him to. And she didn't want him to, not a
bit...or only a teeny weeny bit...and anyhow she wasn't going to
let him, there before them all. But the other boys grabbed her, and
one held her arms and another her legs and another her neck, so:
that he could. And he did&mdash;three times&mdash;hard. She'd been
as angry as anything; she'd hit them all round. But only angry.
Afterwards, though...when Ellie told her what her mother had
said...and now Ruth....</p>

<p>But she got no further; for Alice had thrown back her head and
was shaking with ill-repressed laughter. "Oh, you babe...you
blessed infant, you! Why, child, there was no more harm in that
than...well, than in this!" And pulling the girl to her she kissed
her soundly, some half-dozen times, with scant pause between. An
embarrassing embrace, from which Trixie made uneasy haste to free
herself; for Alice was plump, and her nightgown thin.</p>

<p>"No, you can make your little mind easy," continued the elder
girl on recovering her breath. "Larking's all that was and couldn't
hurt a fly.</p>

<p><i>It's what larking leads to</i>," said Alice, and her voice
sank, till it was hollow with mystery.</p>

<p>"What does it?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Alice in the same sepulchral tone. "You asked me just
now how babies came. Well, <i>that's how</i>, my dear."</p>

<p>"Yes, but..."</p>

<p>"Come, you've read your Bible, haven't you? The Garden of Eden,
and so on? And male and female created He them?"</p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p>"Well, Trix, in <i>my</i> opinion, you ought to be content with
that...in the meanwhile. Time enough for more when...well, when
you're married, my dear." Not for the world would Alice have
admitted her own lack of preciser knowledge, or have uncovered to
the day her private imaginings of the great unknown.</p>

<p>"But suppose I...Not <i>every</i> lady gets married, Dallie! And
than I'd never know."</p>

<p>"And wouldn't need to. But I don't think there's much fear of
that, Trix! You're not the stuff old maids are made of," said Alice
sturdily, welcoming the side issue.</p>

<p>Affectionately Trixie snuggled up to her friend. This tribute
was most consoling. (How awful should nobody want you, you remain
unchosen!) All the same she did not yield; a real worm for
knowledge gnawed in her. "Still, I don't quite see...truly I don't,
Dallie...how you <i>can</i> 'take care,' if you don't know
how."</p>

<p>At this outlandish persistence Alice drew a heavy sigh. "But,
child, there's surely something in you...at least if there isn't
there ought to be...that tells you what's skylarking and what
isn't? Just you think of undressing. Suppose you began to take your
clothes off in front of somebody, somebody who was a stranger to
you, wouldn't something in you stop you by saying: it isn't done,
it's not <i>nice</i>?"</p>

<p>"Gracious, yes!" cried Trixie hotly. "I should think so indeed!"
(Though she could not imagine herself <i>beginning</i>.) But here,
for some reason, what Alice had said about a husband who snored
came back to her, and got tangled up with the later question. "But,
Dallie, you have to...do that, take your clothes off...haven't
you?...if you...sleep in the same bed with somebody," was what she
wanted to say, but the words simply would not come out.</p>

<p>Alice understood. "But <i>only</i> if you're married, Trixie!
And then, it's different. Then everything's allowed, my dear. If
once you're married, it doesn't matter what you do."</p>

<p>"Oh, doesn't it?" echoed Trixie feebly, and her cheeks turned so
hot that they scorched. For at Alice's words horrid things, things
she was ashamed even to think, came rushing into her mind,
upsetting everything she had been taught or told since she was a
little child. But <i>she</i> wouldn't be like that, no, never, no
matter how much she was married; there would always be something in
<i>her</i> that would say "don't, it's not nice."</p>

<p>A silence followed, in which she could hear her own heart
beating. Then, out of a kind of despair, she asked: "Oh, <i>why</i>
are men and women, Dallie? Why have they got to be?"</p>

<p>"Well now, really'!" said Alice, startled and sincerely shocked.
"I hope to goodness you're not going to turn irreligious, and begin
criticising what God has done and how He's made us?"</p>

<p>"Of course not! I know everything He does is right," vowed
Trixie, the more hotly because she couldn't down the naughty
thought: if He's got all that power, then I don't see why He
couldn't have arranged things differently, let them happen
without...well, without all this bother...and so many things you
weren't supposed to know...and what you were allowed to, so...so
unpleasant. Yes, it <i>was</i> unpleasant, when you thought of
undressing...and the snores...and&mdash;and everything.</p>

<p>And then quite suddenly and disconcertingly came a memory of
Alice sitting looking into the fire, telling about her sweetheart.
She had never known before that Alice was so pretty, with dimples
round her mouth, and her eyes all shady. Oh, could it mean
that...yes, it must: Alice simply didn't <i>mind</i>.</p>

<p>Almost as if this thought had passed to her, Alice said: "Just
you wait till you fall in love, Trix, and then it'll be
different&mdash;as different as chalk from cheese. Then you'll be
only too glad, my dear, that we're not all the same&mdash;all men
or all women. Love's something that goes right through you, child,
I couldn't even begin to describe it&mdash;and you wouldn't
understand it if I did&mdash;but once you're in love, you can't
think of anything else, and it gives you such a strange feeling
here that it almost chokes you!"&mdash;and laying one hand over the
other on the place where she believed her heart to be, Alice
pressed hard. "Why, only to be in the same room with him makes you
happy, and if you know he's feeling the same, and that he likes to
look at you and to hold your hand&mdash;oh, Trix, it's just
Heaven!"</p>

<p>I do believe she'd even like him snoring, thought Trixie in
dismay. (But perhaps it was only <i>old</i> men who snored.)
Confused and depressed, she could not think of anything to reply.
Alice did not speak again either, and there was a long silence, in
which, though it was too dark to see her, Trixie guessed she would
have the same funny little smile round her mouth and the same funny
half-shut eyes, from thinking about George. Oh dear! what a muddle
everything was.</p>

<p>"But come!" cried Alice, starting up from her dreams. "To bed
and to sleep with you, young woman, or we shall never get you up in
time for the morning coach. Help yourself to a couple of
cheese-cakes...we can eat them as we go."</p>

<p>Tartlets in hand, back they stole along the moon-blanched
verandah; back past the row of dark windows, past the chromatic
snores&mdash;to Trixie's ears these had now a strange and sinister
significance&mdash;guided by a moon which, riding at the top of the
sky, had shrunk to the size of a pippin.</p>

<h3>The Bath. An Aquarelle</h3>

<p>It was December and a scorching afternoon: a north wind blew;
and the pale wind-streaked sky, the little verandahed houses, the
glaring roads, the very air itself, all were white with heat and
dust. In comparison the bathroom struck cool, being windowless, and
lit only by a raised skylight. A good-sized room, it was really
made for bathing in, was made to get wet, a concrete floor sloping
towards a drain in one corner. Except for a large hanging mirror
and a wooden table, it held nothing but a huge old zinc bath, the
sides of which were streaked rust-brown from the tide-marks of the
many waters that had filled it. Over the broad end hung a
shower-ring. This dripped without ceasing, drops forming
continuously on its under-surface, gathering volume, depending
perilously, then falling on the zinc with a toneless thud. The
water that oozed out when the large old-fashioned cock opened was
not unlike muddied milk, and for the most part lukewarm. But it
gushed freely, making up by abundance for its tepidness and want of
clarity.</p>

<p>To-day it ran very red, for a storm overnight had churned up the
mud bottom of the reservoir.</p>

<p>Four half-grown girls had come dancing into the room, and eight
hands were busy; for all four had cried as one: "A bath! Let us
have a bath!"</p>

<p>And while the water raced and sang, shoes were kicked off and
clothes fell, a bit here, an oddment there, in their owners' haste
to be rid of encumbrances.</p>

<p>First ready was a fattish little blonde; though, as the eldest
of the party, she had set to work more sedately than the rest. But,
in her hurry to reach the water, one of the four had pulled a knot,
and a brown and a red head were bent over it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Blonde sat on the side of the bath, swinging one leg.
Her skin was of a delicate transparency, through which the veins
showed blue as forget-me-nots. A wonderful prong, running down the
chest, forked and lost itself in the whiteness of the barely-hinted
breasts. Round her throat were two lines that might have been
scored by a thumb-nail in wet clay; and below the ribs were two
more&mdash;the lines of sitting beauty&mdash;deeply indented and
wavy, like the lines carved by ripples on the sea-shore.</p>

<p>The knot unravelled, Red Head was out of her clothes in a
twinkling, and now advanced, shoulders hunched, arms crossed and
hugging their uppers. While she stood waiting for the tide to rise,
rubbing the sole of one foot up and down the other leg, she made
her brown-haired little companion, the youngest of the four, and
still skinny and straight as a boy, look very dark; for, in Red
Hair, the promise of a pale face powdered with freckles was
fulfilled: her skin was white as milk from top to toe, and velvety
as rose-petals to the touch.</p>

<p>Last came the knot-puller&mdash;a tall, slim, brown-eyed
creature with a sallow face, flushed pink at the moment from heat
and hurry, and a head of short golden curls. Against the others she
stood out for the richness of her colouring; her skin was the shade
of old, old ivory, tinting to amber, to a dusky gold, in all
crevices: where the curls met her neck, and in the hollows of her
armpits. Her young breasts&mdash;at this moment laid flat, for she
was stretching with the abandon of a cat, both hands clasped tight
behind her neck&mdash;ended in rings the colour of blue grapes
dashed with sepia.</p>

<p>By now the bath was full to the brim. And while the four still
lingered, chattering, twittering, exulting in their freedom, there
was the sound of a heavy foot in the passage outside. And the room
had three doors, none of which locked. Whrr! Like a herd of
startled wild things, all made for the water at once, a phalanx of
cream, white, and dusky legs whisking over the side with incredible
rapidity. Amber came off worst: she was too tall; crouching did not
help her. So she lay at full length, the others half-leaning,
half-sitting on her, to keep her down. But the threatened intrusion
passed; and with a fresh run of giggles and trills the bathers rose
to their feet.&mdash;The water that trickled down their skins left
visible traces, like tears on a grimy face.</p>

<p>Then the shower was pulled. Amber and Brownie stood under it,
holding their heads to the gush and hiss, Amber raising an arm to
screen her eyes, the little one pressing her face against her
companion's ribs. And, bristling and stinging, the shower flew off
at right-angles, squirting madly out into the room. Blonde and Red
Head dodged and scuttled. Then it was their turn. Blonde would not
wet her hair; she leant her head and shoulders far back, stretching
her lined throat, meeting the brunt of the water on her chest; or,
stooping forward, let it hammer down the ridgeway of her spine.</p>

<p>Next, all tried to get under water at the same time. The result
was wildest confusion; for the one below kicked, and splashed, and
rolled over three slippery bodies, in her efforts to come to the
surface.&mdash;Taking Blonde by the toes, the others floated her up
and down.</p>

<p>An elderly woman looked in: the bathers gathered water in their
joined palms and pelted her, in a perpendicular shower. Then they
played at leaping. The game was: to go to the end of the room and
take a running jump over the side, to see who could splash highest.
Red Head was awkward, slipped and fell face downwards, to be
half-drowned by the one who came after. This led to a free fight.
The weapons were a big and little sponge: inflated to their
fullest, they were hurled against any portion of a body that
offered; and tireless hands, which scooped and flung, tweaked and
slapped. The walls ran water, the concrete floor was a-swim with
it.</p>

<p>In the midst of these gambols, a clock struck five. Like ghosts
surprised by the dawn, the four were out of the bath in a trice and
a-scramble for the towels that hung behind a door. There was a
hasty rubbing down of sides and fronts; towels seesawed over backs,
knees bent, curly toes wriggled dry. Grasped in two hands garments
were poised for a moment high in air, then dropped into place,
blotting out faces in the transit. And soon, of all that had lain
bare, no more was visible than four damp-ringed, motley-coloured
heads.&mdash;Though the long glass had given back in full the
madcap riot of the bath, none had troubled to cast so much as a
look at her naked self. Clothed, it was otherwise: here a sodden
mass of curls was twitched and fingered, there the sit of a frock
stroked into place.</p>

<p>Now a voice was heard calling&mdash;an urgent voice, that
brooked no delay. Without a further backward glance each in turn
followed the summons, vanishing swiftly. Four times the door opened
and shut; till the room was empty. The splashed walls and swimming
floor drained dry; the bath-water gurgled off; and the mirror's
surface lay blank, no conjurer being at hand to call to life the
lovely shapes that slumbered in its depth.</p>

<h3>The Wrong Turning</h3>

<p>The way he helped her into the boat was delicious, simply
delicious: it made her feel like a grown-up lady to be taken so
much care of&mdash;usually, people didn't mind how you got in and
out of things, as you were only thirteen. And before he let her
step off the landing he took her strap of books from
her&mdash;those wretched schoolbooks, which stamped her, but which
she hadn't known how to get rid of: her one chance of going for a
row was secretly, on her way home from school. But he seemed to
understand, without being told, how she despised them, and he put
them somewhere in the boat where they wouldn't get wet, and yet she
didn't need to see them. (She wondered what he had done with his
own.)</p>

<p>He was so <i>nice</i>; everything about him was nice: his
velvety brown eyes and white teeth; his pink cheeks and fair hair.
And when he took his coat off and sat down, and rolled up his
sleeves and spanned his wrists on the oars, she liked him better
still: he looked so strong...almost as if he could have picked the
boat up and carried it. He wasn't at all forward either (she hated
cheeky boys:) when he had to touch her hand he went brick red, and
jumped his own hand away as quick as he could.</p>

<p>With one stroke they were off and gliding downstream...oh, so
smoothly! It made her think of floating in milk...though the water
was <i>really</i> brown and muddy-looking. Soon they would be quite
away from the houses and the little back-gardens and allotments
that ran down to the water, and out among the woods, where the
river twisted like a snake, and the trees hung over the edge and
dipped their branches in...most romantically. Then perhaps he would
say something. He hadn't spoken yet; he was too busy rowing, making
great sweeps with the oars, and not looking at her...or only taking
a peep now and then, to see if she saw. Which she did, and her
heart thumped with pleasure. Perhaps, as he was so clever at it,
he'd be a sailor when he was a man and go to sea. But that would
mean him travelling far away, and she might never see him again.
And though she'd only known him for a fortnight, and at first he
hadn't liked to speak, but had just stood and made eyes at her when
they met going home from school, she felt she simply couldn't bear
it if he did.</p>

<p>To hide her feelings, she hung one hand over the side of the
boat and let it trail, through the water&mdash;keeping it there
long after it was stone cold, in the hope that he would notice it
and say something. But he didn't.</p>

<p>The Boy was thinking: I wonder if I dare tell her not to...her
little hand...all wet like that, and cold. I should like to take it
in both mine, and rub it dry, and warm it. <i>How</i> pretty she
is, with all that fuzzy-wuzzy hair, and the little curls on her
forehead. And how long her eyelashes are when she looks down. I
wish I could make her look up...look at me. But how? Why, say
something, of course. But what? Oh, if <i>only</i> I could think of
something! What does one? What would Jim say, if he wanted to make
his girl look at him?</p>

<p>But nothing came.</p>

<p>Here, however, the hand was jerked from the water to kill a gnat
that had settled on the other.</p>

<p>This was his cue. He parted hastily with his saliva.</p>

<p>"I say! Did it sting?"</p>

<p>She suppressed the no that was on her lips. "Well...yes...I
think it did, rather." And doubling her bony little schoolgirl
fingers into her palm, she held out the back of the hand for his
inspection.</p>

<p>Steadying the oars, the Boy leant forward to look, leant so far
that, for a wild moment, she believed he was going to kiss the
place, and half instinctively, half from an equally strong impulse
to "play him," drew it away. But he did not follow it up: at the
thought of a kiss, which <i>had</i> occurred to him, shyness lamed
him anew. So nothing came of this either.</p>

<p>And we've only half an hour, thought the Girl distractedly. If
he doesn't say something...soon...there won't be any time left. And
then it will all have been for nothing.</p>

<p>She, too, beat her brains. "The trees...aren't they
pretty?&mdash;the way they hang right down in the water." (Other
couples stopped under these trees, she'd seen them, and lay there
in their boats; or even went right in behind the weeping
willows.)</p>

<p>But his sole response was: "Good enough." And another block
followed.</p>

<p>Oh, he saw quite well what she was aiming at: she wanted him to
pull in to the bank and ship his oars, so that they could do a bit
of spooning, she lying lazy in the stern. But at the picture a mild
panic seized him. For, if he couldn't find anything to say even
when he was rowing, it would be ten times harder when he sat with
his hands before him and nothing to do. His tongue would stick to
the roof of his mouth, dry as a bone, and then she'd see for sure
how dull he was. And never want to go out with him again. No, thank
you, not for him!</p>

<p>But talk wasn't everything&mdash;by gum, it wasn't! He might be
a rotten hand at speechifying, but what he could <i>do</i>, that
he'd jolly well show her! And under this urge to display his
strength, his skill, he now fell to work in earnest. Forward swung
the oars, cleanly carving the water, or lightly feathering the
surface; on flew the boat, he driving to and fro with his jaws
grimly set and a heightened colour, the muscles standing out like
pencils on his arms. Oh, it was a fine thing to be able to row so
well, and have a girl, <i>the</i> girl, sitting watching you. For
now her eyes hung on him, mutely adoring, spurring him on to ever
bolder strokes.</p>

<p>And then a sheerly dreadful thing happened. So lost was he in
showing his mastery, in feeding on her looks, that he failed to
keep his wits about him. And, coming to a place where the river
forked, he took the wrong turning, and before he knew it they were
in a part where you were not supposed to go&mdash;a bathing-place
for men, much frequented by soldiers.</p>

<p>A squeal from the Girl roused him; but then it was too late:
they had shot in among a score of bathers, whose heads bobbed about
on the surface like so many floating footballs. And instantly her
shrill cry was taken up and echoed and re-echoed by shouts, and
laughter, and rude hullos, as the swimmers scattered before the
oars. Coarse jokes were bandied, too, at the unwarranted intrusion.
Hi! wasn't there nowhere else he could take his girl? Or was she
coming in, too? Off with her togs then!</p>

<p>Crimson with mortification at his blunder, at the fool he had
made of himself (before her), the Boy savagely strove to turn the
boat and escape. But the heads&mdash;there seemed to be hundreds of
them&mdash;deliberately blocked his way. And while he manoeuvred,
the sweat trickling down his forehead, a pair of arms and shoulders
reared themselves from the water, and two hands grasped the side of
the boat. It rocked; and the Girl squealed anew, shrinking sideways
from the nearness of the dripping, sunburnt flesh.</p>

<p>"Come on, missie, pay toll!"</p>

<p>The Boy swore aloud.</p>

<p>But even worse was to come. On one bank, a square of wooden
palisades had been built out round a stretch of water and a wooden
bath-house, where there were cabins for the men to strip in,
platforms to jump from, ropes strung for those who could not swim.
But in this fence was a great gap, where some of the palings had
fallen down. And in his rage and confusion the Boy had the
misfortune to bring the boat right alongside it; and
then...then...Inside the enclosure, out of the cabins, down the
steps, men were running, jumping, chasing, leap-frogging...every
one of them as naked as on the day he was born.</p>

<p>For one instant the Girl raised her eyes&mdash;one only...but it
was enough. She saw. And he saw that she saw.</p>

<p>And now, to these two young creatures, it seemed as if the whole
visible world&mdash;themselves, boat, river, trees and
sky&mdash;caught fire, and blazed up in one gigantic blush. Nothing
existed for them any more but this burning redness. Nor could they
escape; there they had to sit, knee to knee, face to face, and
scorch, and suffocate; the blood filling their eyes till they could
scarcely see, mounting to their hair-roots, making even their
finger-tips throb and tingle.</p>

<p>Gritting his teeth, the Boy rowed like a machine that had been
wound up and was not to be stopped. The Girl sat with drooped
head&mdash;it seemed to have grown strangely heavy&mdash;and but a
single wish: to get out and away...where he could not see her. For
all was over between them&mdash;both felt that. Something
catastrophic had happened, rudely shattering their frail young
dreams; breaking down his boyish privacy, pitching her headlong
into a reality for which she was in no wise prepared.</p>

<p>If it had been hard beforehand to find things to say, it was now
impossible. And on the way home no sound was to be heard but the
dip of the oars, the water's cluck and gurgle round the boat. At
the landing-place, she got out by herself, took from him, without
looking up, her strap of books, and said a brief good-bye; keeping
to a walking pace till she had turned the corner, then breaking
into a run, and running for dear life...as if chased by some
grotesque nightmare-shape which she must leave far, far behind
her...even in thought.</p>

<h3>"And Women Must Weep"&mdash;"For men must work"</h3>

<p>She was ready at last, the last bow tied, the last strengthening
pin in place, and they said to her&mdash;Auntie Cha and Miss
Biddons&mdash;to sit down and rest while Auntie Cha "climbed into
her own togs": "Or you'll be tired before the evening begins." But
she could not bring herself to sit, for fear of crushing her
dress&mdash;it was so light, so airy. How glad she felt now that
she had chosen muslin, and not silk as Auntie Cha had tried to
persuade her. The gossamer like stuff seemed to float around her as
she moved, and the cut of the dress made her look so tall and so
different from everyday that she hardly recognised herself in the
glass; the girl reflected there&mdash;in palest blue, with a wreath
of corn-flowers in her hair&mdash;might have been a stranger. Never
had she thought she was so pretty...nor had Auntie and Miss Biddons
either; though all they said was: "Well, Dolly, you'll <i>do</i>."
and: "Yes, I think she will be a credit to you." Something hot and
stinging came up her throat at this: a kind of gratitude for her
pinky-white skin, her big blue eyes and fair curly hair, and pity
for those girls who hadn't got them. Or an Auntie Cha either, to
dress them and see that everything was "just so."</p>

<p>Instead of sitting, she stood very stiff and straight at the
window, pretending to watch for the cab, her long white gloves
hanging loose over one arm so as not to soil them. But her heart
was beating pit-a-pat. For this was her first real grown-up ball.
It was to be held in a public hall, and Auntie Cha, where she was
staying, had bought tickets and was taking her.</p>

<p>True, Miss Biddons rather spoilt things at the end by saying:
"Now mind you don't forget your steps in the waltz. One, two,
together; four, five, six." And in the wagonette, with her dress
filling one seat, Auntie Cha's the other, Auntie said: "Now, Dolly,
remember not to look too <i>serious</i>. Or you'll frighten the
gentlemen off."</p>

<p>But she was only doing it now because of her dress: cabs were so
cramped, the seats so narrow.</p>

<p>Alas! in getting out a little accident happened. She caught the
bottom of one of her flounces&mdash;the skirt was made of nothing
else&mdash;on the iron step, and ripped off the selvedge. Auntie
Cha said: "My <i>dear</i>, how clumsy!" She could have cried with
vexation.</p>

<p>The woman who took their cloaks hunted everywhere, but could
only find black cotton; so the torn selvedge&mdash;there was nearly
half a yard of it-had just to be cut off. This left a raw edge, and
when they went into the hall and walked across the enormous floor,
with people sitting all round, staring, it seemed to Dolly as if
every one had their eyes fixed on it. Auntie Cha sat down in the
front row of chairs beside a lady-friend; but she slid into a chair
behind.</p>

<p>The first dance was already over, and they were hardly seated
before partners began to be taken for the second. Shyly she
mustered the assembly. In the cloakroom, she had expected the woman
to exclaim: "What a sweet pretty frock!" when she handled it. (When
all she did say was: "This sort of stuff's bound to fray.") And now
Dolly saw that the hall was full of <i>lovely</i> dresses, some
much, much prettier than hers, which suddenly began to seem rather
too plain, even a little dowdy; perhaps after all it would have
been better to have chosen silk.</p>

<p>She wondered if Auntie Cha thought so, too. For Auntie suddenly
turned and looked at her, quite hard, and then said snappily:
"Come, come, child, you mustn't tuck yourself away like that, or
the gentlemen will think you don't want to dance." So she had to
come out and sit in the front; and show that she had a programme,
by holding it open on her lap.</p>

<p>When other ladies were being requested for the third time, and
still nobody had asked to be introduced, Auntie began making signs
and beckoning with her head to the Master of Ceremonies&mdash;a
funny little fat man with a bright red beard. He waddled across the
floor, and Auntie whispered to him behind her fan. (But she heard.
And heard him answer: "Wants a partner? Why, certainly.") And then
he went away and they could see him offering her to several
gentlemen. Some pointed to the ladies they were sitting with or
standing in front of; some showed their programmes that these were
full. One or two turned their heads and looked at her. But it was
no good. So he came back and said: "Will the little lady do
<i>me</i> the favour?" and she had to look glad and say: "With
pleasure," and get up and dance with him. Perhaps she was a little
slow about it...at any rate Auntie Cha made great round eyes at
her. But she felt sure every one would know why he was asking her.
It was the lancers, too, and he swung her off her feet at the
corners, and was comic when he set to partners&mdash;putting one
hand on his hip and the other over his head, as if he were dancing
the hornpipe&mdash;and the rest of the set laughed. She was glad
when it was over and she could go back to her place.</p>

<p>Auntie Cha's lady-friend had a son, and he was beckoned to next
and there was more whispering. But he was engaged to be married,
and of course preferred to dance with his fiancee. When he came and
bowed&mdash;to oblige his mother&mdash;he looked quite grumpy, and
didn't trouble to say all of "May I have the pleasure?" but just
"The pleasure?" While she had to say "Certainly," and pretend to be
very pleased, though she didn't feel it, and really didn't want
much to dance with him, knowing he didn't, and that it was only out
of charity. Besides, all the time they went round he was explaining
things to the other girl with his eyes...making faces over her
head. She saw him, quite plainly.</p>

<p>After he had brought her back&mdash;and Auntie had talked to him
again&mdash;he went to a gentleman who hadn't danced at all yet,
but just stood looking on. And this one needed a lot of persuasion.
He was ugly, and lanky, and as soon as they stood up, said quite
rudely: "I'm no earthly good at this kind of thing, you know." And
he wasn't. He trod on her foot and put her out of step, and they
got into the most dreadful muddle, right out in the middle of the
floor. It was a waltz, and remembering what Miss Biddons had said,
she got more and more nervous, and then went wrong herself and had
to say: "I beg your pardon," to which he said: "Granted." She saw
them in a mirror as they passed, and her face was red as red.</p>

<p>It didn't get cool again either, for she had to go on sitting
out, and she felt sure he was spreading it that <i>she</i> couldn't
dance. She didn't know whether Auntie Cha had seen her mistakes,
but now Auntie sort of went for her. "It's no use, Dolly, if you
don't do <i>your</i> share. For goodness sake, try and look more
agreeable!"</p>

<p>So after this, in the intervals between the dances, she sat with
a stiff little smile gummed to her lips. And, did any
likely-looking partner approach the corner where they were, this
widened till she felt what it was really saying was: "Here I am!
Oh, <i>please</i>, take <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>She had several false hopes. Men, looking so splendid in their
white shirt fronts, would walk across the floor and <i>seem</i> to
be coming...and then it was always not her. Their eyes wouldn't
stay on her. There she sat, with her false little smile, and
<i>her</i> eyes fixed on them; but theirs always got away...flitted
past...moved on. Once she felt quite sure. Ever such a handsome
young man looked as if he were making straight for her. She
stretched her lips, showing all her teeth (they were very good) and
for an instant his eyes seemed to linger...really to take her in,
in her pretty blue dress and the corn-flowers. And then at the,
last minute they ran away&mdash;and it wasn't her at all, but a
girl sitting three seats further on; one who wasn't even pretty, or
her dress either&mdash;But her own dress was beginning to get quite
tashy, from the way she squeezed her hot hands down in her lap.</p>

<p>Quite the worst part of all was having to go on sitting in the
front row, pretending you were enjoying yourself. It was so hard to
know what to do with your eyes. There was nothing but the floor for
them to look at&mdash;if you watched the other couples dancing they
would think you were envying them. At first she made a show of
studying her programme; but you couldn't go on staring at a
programme for ever; and presently her shame at its emptiness grew
till she could bear it no longer, and, seizing a moment when people
were dancing, she slipped it down the front of her dress. Now she
could say she'd lost it, if anyone asked to see it. But they
didn't; they went on dancing with other girls. Oh, these men, who
walked round and chose just who they fancied and left who they
didn't...how she hated them! It wasn't fair...it wasn't fair. And
when there was a "leap-year dance" where the ladies invited the
gentlemen, and Auntie Cha tried to push her up and make her go and
said: "Now then, Dolly, here's your chancel" she shook her head
hard and dug herself deeper into her scat. She wasn't going to ask
them when they never asked her. So she said her head ached and
she'd rather not. And to this she clung, sitting the while wishing
with her whole heart that her dress was black and her hair grey,
like Auntie Cha's. Nobody expected Auntie to dance, or thought it
shameful if she didn't: she could do and be just as she liked. Yes,
to-night she wished she was old...an old old woman. Or that she was
safe at home in bed this dreadful evening, to which she had once
counted the days, behind her. Even, as the night wore on, that she
was dead.</p>

<p>At supper she sat with Auntie and the other lady, and the son
and the girl came, too. There were lovely cakes and things, but she
could not eat them. Her throat was so dry that a sandwich stuck in
it and nearly choked her. Perhaps the son felt a little sorry for
her (or else his mother had whispered again), for afterwards he
said something to the girl, and then asked <i>her</i> to dance.
They stood up together; but it wasn't a success. Her legs seemed to
have forgotten how to jump, heavy as lead they were...as heavy as
she felt inside...and she couldn't think of a thing to say. So now
he would put her down as stupid, as well.</p>

<p>Her only other partner was a boy younger than she
was&mdash;almost a schoolboy&mdash;who she heard them say was
"making a positive nuisance of himself." This was to a <i>very</i>
pretty girl called the "belle of the ball." And he didn't seem to
mind how badly he danced (with her), for he couldn't take his eyes
off this other girl; but went on staring at her all the time, and
very fiercely, because she was talking and laughing with somebody
else. Besides, he hopped like a grass-hopper, and didn't wear
gloves, and his hands were hot and sticky. She hadn't come there to
dance with little boys.</p>

<p>They left before anybody else; there was nothing to stay for.
And the drive home in the wagonette, which had to be fetched, they
were so early, was dreadful: Auntie Cha just sat and pressed her
lips and didn't say a word. She herself kept her face turned the
other way, because her mouth was jumping, in and out as if it might
have to cry.</p>

<p>At the sound of wheels Miss Biddons came running to the front
door with questions and exclamations, dreadfully curious to know
why they were back so soon. Dolly fled to her own little room and
turned the key in the lock. She wanted only to be alone, quite
alone, where nobody could see her...where nobody would ever see her
again. But the walls were thin, and as she tore off the wreath and
ripped open her dress, now crushed to nothing from so much sitting,
and threw them from her anywhere, anyhow, she could hear the two
voices going on, Auntie Cha's telling and telling, and winding up
at last, quite out loud, with: "Well, I don't know what it was, but
the plain truth is she didn't <i>take</i>!"</p>

<p>Oh, the shame of it!...the sting and the shame. Her first ball,
and not to have "taken," to have failed to "attract the
gentlemen"&mdash;this was a slur that would rest on her all her
life. And yet...and yet...in spite of everything, a small voice
that wouldn't be silenced kept on saying: "It wasn't my
<i>fault</i>...it wasn't my fault!" (Or at least not except for the
one silly mistake in the steps of the waltz.) She had tried her
hardest, done everything she was told to: had dressed up to please
and look pretty, sat in the front row offering her programme,
smiled when she didn't feel a bit like smiling...and almost more
than anything she thought she hated the memory of that smile (it
was like trying to make people buy something they didn't think
worth while.) For really, truly, right deep down in her, she hadn't
wanted "the gentlemen" any more than they'd wanted her: she had
only had to pretend to. And they showed only too plainly they
didn't, by choosing other girls, who were not even pretty, and
dancing with them, and laughing and talking and enjoying
them.&mdash;And now, the many slights and humiliations of the
evening crowding upon her, the long repressed tears broke through;
and with the blanket pulled up over her head, her face driven deep
into the pillow, she cried till she could cry no more.</p>

<h3>Two Hanged Women</h3>

<p>Hand in hand the youthful lovers sauntered along the esplanade.
It was a night in midsummer; a wispy moon had set, and the stars
glittered. The dark mass of the sea, at flood, lay tranquil,
slothfully lapping the shingle.</p>

<p>"Come on, let's make for the usual," said the boy.</p>

<p>But on nearing their favourite seat they found it occupied. In
the velvety shade of the overhanging sea-wall, the outlines of two
figures were visible.</p>

<p>"Oh, blast!" said the lad. "That's torn it. What now, Baby?"</p>

<p>"Why, let's stop here, Pincher, right close up, till we frighten
'em off."</p>

<p>And very soon loud, smacking kisses, amatory pinches and
ticklings, and skittish squeals of pleasure did their work.
Silently the intruders rose and moved away.</p>

<p>But the boy stood gaping after them, open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm <i>damned</i>! If it wasn't just two hanged
women!"</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Retreating before a salvo of derisive laughter, the elder of the
girls said: "We'll go out on the break-water." She was tall and
thin, and walked with a long stride.</p>

<p>Her companion, shorter than she by a bobbed head of straight
flaxen hair, was hard put to it to keep pace. As she pegged along
she said doubtfully, as if in self-excuse: "Though I really ought
to go home. It's getting late. Mother will be angry."</p>

<p>They walked with finger-tips lightly in contact; and at her
words she felt what was like an attempt to get free, on the part of
the fingers crooked in hers. But she was prepared for this, and
held fast, gradually working her own up till she had a good half of
the other hand in her grip.</p>

<p>For a moment neither spoke. Then, in a low, muffled voice, came
the question: "Was she angry last night, too?"</p>

<p>The little fair girl's reply had an unlooked-for vehemence. "You
know she wasn't!" And, mildly despairing: "But you never
<i>will</i> understand. Oh, what's the good of...of anything!"</p>

<p>And on sitting down she let the prisoned hand go, even putting
it from her with a kind of push. There it lay, palm upwards, the
fingers still curved from her hold, looking like a thing with a
separate life of its own; but a life that was ebbing.</p>

<p>On this remote seat, with their backs turned on lovers, lights,
the town, the two girls sat and gazed wordlessly at the dark sea,
over which great Jupiter was flinging a thin gold line. There was
no sound but the lapping, sucking, sighing, of the ripples at the
edge of the breakwater, and the occasional screech of an owl in the
tall trees on the hillside.</p>

<p>But after a time, having stolen more than one side-glance at her
companion, the younger seemed to take heart of grace. With a
childish toss of the head that set her loose hair swaying, she
said, in a tone of meaning emphasis: "I like Fred."</p>

<p>The only answer was a faint, contemptuous shrug.</p>

<p>"I tell you I <i>like</i> him!"</p>

<p>"Fred? Rats!"</p>

<p>"No it isn't...that's just where you're wrong, Betty. But you
think you're so wise. Always."</p>

<p>"I know what I know."</p>

<p>"Or imagine you do! But it doesn't matter. Nothing you can say
makes any difference. I like him, and always shall. In heaps of
ways. He's so big and strong, for one thing: it gives you such a
safe sort of feeling to be with him...as if nothing could happen
while you were. Yes, it's...it's...well, I can't help it, Betty,
there's something <i>comfy</i> in having a boy to go about
with&mdash;like other girls do. One they'd eat their hats to get,
too! I can see it in their eyes when we pass; Fred with his great
long legs and broad shoulders&mdash;I don't nearly come up to
them&mdash;and his blue eyes with the black lashes, and his shiny
black hair. And I like his tweeds, the Harris smell of them, and
his dirty old pipe, and the way he shows his teeth&mdash;he's got
<i>topping</i> teeth&mdash;when he laughs and says
'ra-<i>ther</i>!' And other people, when they see us, look...well I
don't quite know how to say it, but they look sort of pleased; and
they make room for us and let us into the dark corner-seats at the
pictures, just as if we'd a right to them. And they never laugh.
(Oh, I can't <i>stick</i> being laughed at!&mdash;and that's the
truth.) Yes, it's so comfy, Betty darling...such a warm cosy comfy
feeling. Oh, <i>won't</i> you understand?"</p>

<p>"Gawd! why not make a song of it?" But a moment later, very
fiercely: "And who is it's taught you to think all this? Who's
hinted it and suggested it till you've come to believe
it?...believe it's what you really feel."</p>

<p>"She hasn't! Mother's never said a word...about Fred."</p>

<p>"Words?&mdash;why waste words?...when she can do it with a cock
of the eye. For your Fred, that!" and the girl called Betty held
her fingers aloft and snapped them viciously. "But your mother's a
different proposition."</p>

<p>"I think you're simply horrid."</p>

<p>To this there was no reply.</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i> have you such a down on her? What's she ever done to
you?...except not get ratty when I stay out late with Fred. And I
don't see how you can expect...being what she is...and with nobody
but me&mdash;after all she <i>is</i> my mother...you can't alter
that. I know very well&mdash;and you know, too&mdash;I'm not
<i>too</i> putrid-looking. But"&mdash;beseechingly&mdash;"I'm
<i>nearly</i> twenty-five now, Betty. And other girls...well, she
sees them, every one of them, with a boy of their own, even though
they're ugly, or fat, or have legs like sausages&mdash;they've only
got to ogle them a bit&mdash;the girls, I mean...and there they
are. And Fred's a good sort&mdash;he is, really!&mdash;and he
dances well, and doesn't drink, and so...so why <i>shouldn't</i> I
like him?...and off my own bat...without it having to be all
Mother's fault, and me nothing but a parrot, and without any will
of my own?"</p>

<p>"Why? Because I know her too well, my child! I can read her as
you'd never dare to...even if you could. She's sly, your mother is,
so sly there's no coming to grips with her...one might as well try
to fill one's hand with cobwebs. But she's got a hold on you, a
strangle-hold, that nothing 'll loosen. Oh! mothers aren't
fair&mdash;I mean it's not fair of nature to weigh us down with
them and yet expect us to be our own true selves. The handicap's
too great. All those months, when the same blood's running through
two sets of veins&mdash;there's no getting away from that, ever
after. Take yours. As I say, does she need to open her mouth? Not
she! She's only got to let it hang at the corners, and you reek,
you drip with guilt."</p>

<p>Something in these words seemed to sting the younger girl. She
hit back. "I know what it is, you're jealous, that's what you
are!...and you've no other way of letting it out. But I tell you
this. If ever I marry&mdash;yes, <i>marry</i>!&mdash;it'll be to
please myself, and nobody else. Can, you imagine me doing it to
oblige her?"</p>

<p>Again silence.</p>

<p>"If I only think what it would be like to be fixed up and
settled, and able to live in peace, without this eternal dragging
two ways...just as if I was being torn in half. And see Mother
smiling and happy again, like she used to be. Between the two of
you I'm nothing but a punch-ball. Oh, I'm fed up with it!...fed up
to the neck. As for you...And yet you can sit there as if you were
made of stone! Why don't you <i>say</i> something? <i>Betty</i>!
Why won't you speak?"</p>

<p>But no words came.</p>

<p>"I can <i>feel</i> you sneering. And when you sneer I hate you
more than any one on earth. If only I'd never seen you!"</p>

<p>"Marry your Fred, and you'll never need to again."</p>

<p>"I will, too! I'll marry him, and have a proper wedding like
other girls, with a veil and bridesmaids and bushels of flowers.
And I'll live in a house of my own, where I can do as I like, and
be left in peace, and there'll be no one to badger and bully
me&mdash;Fred wouldn't...ever! Besides, he'll be away all day. And
when he came back at night, he'd...I'd...I mean I'd&mdash;" But
here the flying words gave out; there came a stormy breath and a
cry of: "Oh, Betty, Betty!...I couldn't, no, I couldn't! It's when
I think of <i>that</i>...Yes, it's quite true! I like him all
right, I do indeed, but only as long as he doesn't come too near.
If he even sits too close, I have to screw myself up to bear
it"&mdash;and flinging herself down over her companion's lap, she
hid her face. "And if he tries to touch me, Betty, or even takes my
arm or puts his round me...And then his face...when it looks like
it does sometimes all wrong...as if it had gone all wrong&mdash;oh!
then I feel I shall have to scream&mdash;out loud. I'm afraid of
him...when he looks like that. Once...when he kissed me...I could
have died with the horror of it. His breath...his breath...and his
mouth&mdash;like fruit pulp&mdash;and the black hairs on his
wrists...and the way he looked&mdash;and...and everything! No, I
can't, I can't...nothing will make me...I'd rather die twice over.
But what am I to do? Mother'll <i>never</i> understand. Oh, why has
it got to be like this? I want to be happy, like other girls, and
to make her happy, too...and everything's all wrong. You tell me,
Betty darling, you help me, you're older...you <i>know</i>...and
you can help me, if you will...if you only will!" And locking her
arms round her friend she drove her face deeper into the warmth and
darkness, as if, from the very fervour of her clasp, she could draw
the aid and strength she needed.</p>

<p>Betty had sat silent, unyielding, her sole movement being to
loosen her own arms from her sides and point her elbows outwards,
to hinder them touching the arms that lay round her. But at this
last appeal she melted; and gathering the young girl to her breast,
she held her fast.&mdash;And so for long she continued to sit, her
chin resting lightly on the fair hair, that was silky and downy as
an infant's, and gazing with sombre eyes over the stealthily
heaving sea.</p>

<h2>Two Tales of Old Strasbourg</h2>

<h3>Life And Death of Peterle Luthy</h3>

<p>Peterle was born in hospital.&mdash;The first hiccuppy breaths
drawn, his little body washed and swathed, he was wheeled, together
with his mother, down the corridor to another ward, and put to
sleep under a feather-bed in a blue-and-white checked covering.
Seven beds stood in this ward, with seven cots beside them, and
five were in use when Peterle came to his. The seventh was taken
possession of before sunset. Again the doors of the ward opened, to
admit two attendants pushing a truckle-bed. The new arrival was a
sturdy fellow, who had all but been the death of the young girl his
mother: she lay white as chalk, her eyes closed, her auburn hair
tumbled loose on the pillow.&mdash;Meanwhile Peterle, bottle to
mouth, was engaged in learning to suck; and the imbibing of a
smooth sweet fluid, that lulled and sated, was the first good joy
he knew.</p>

<p>Peterle was very puny: emotional visitors clasped their hands
and turned up their eyes at the sight of him. But he was of a
contented humour, and would occupy himself for minutes on end,
making worm-like movements of his fingers before his face, in a
vain attempt to guide them to his mouth. If a sunbeam tickled his
nose he sneezed, and then his tiny wizened face puckered into a
thousand fresh crinkles and creases&mdash;like the hands of a
laundress on Monday evening. Every day a square of sunshine took a
journey across him, his bed standing next one of the high windows
that opened on the garden. It travelled over his mother, too, who,
to begin with, so weak was she, could hardly raise her arm to pat
him when he cried; she lay and dozed in the warmth, a
delicate-looking girl, with fine princess hands, which years of
scouring and scrubbing had not disfigured.</p>

<p>On the third day, pulling herself up in bed, she moistened her
handkerchief and cleaned out the corners of the infant's mouth and
nose. In the afternoon came visitors. Peterle had just emptied a
bottle, and, exhausted with the labour of drinking, had fallen
asleep. On being handled he wakened, was sick, and uttered shrill
cries.</p>

<p>His grandmother shook her head.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" was her heaved sigh of comment on him, as she put
him back in his cot, where he fretted himself to sleep
again.&mdash;She was a pale, thin, tidy woman, with a face which,
in its ineffectual flatness, resembled a mask of scantly worked
clay. The grinding years, instead of deepening the charactery, had
blurred...erased.</p>

<p>With her were the babe's two brothers. Gustave, who had arrived
at breeches, neither felt nor feigned an interest in the newcomer.
Thumb in mouth, noisily shuffling his feet, he strayed round the
ward, staring with a child's audacious curiosity at the bedridden
women, and dragging a sticky finger unrebuked over tables and
chairs. But Willi, who had seen only three summers, gurgled with
joy on discovering his mother, and made for her outstretched arms
with all the speed his infirmity permitted: his legs were so bandy
that, when he walked, he staggered, like an old salt taking land.
And Peterle's mother forgot Peterle over him; for Willi was the
apple of her eye. In briefly responding to the elder woman's brief
questions, it was Willi's butter-coloured hair she smoothed,
Willi's eyes she looked into&mdash;two limpid, black-fringed pools,
that had caught and kept a glint of the May blueness on which they,
too, had opened.</p>

<p>A bell rang; the handful of strangers retired; the ward resumed
its everyday air. Sinking as into downy depths, the weary
childbearers surrendered themselves anew to a dreamless repose; and
the hush was broken only by the quickly stilled wail of an infant,
or the flip-flop of a nurse's bast shoes. For days Peterle lay at
peace in his generous bed: he slept, sucked, and stared into the
sunshine: and, except when raised to be stripped of his swaddling,
found life a very pleasant state of being.</p>

<p>On the morning when he was nine days old, his mother threw off
her coverings, and having reached a chair, dressed first herself,
then Peterle, whom she bound to a pillow. Downstairs in the
tesselated corridor, where lilac rapped and beckoned at the
windows, the perambulator was in waiting&mdash;a big-bellied
clothes-basket on wheels. Peterle, placed in it, was topped by a
feather-bed, and trundled out on his homeward journey.</p>

<p>It was May, and a dazzling morning; streets and houses lay as if
new-scoured in the strong, pure light. The steep roofs shone gaily
red; their dormer windows flashed and twinkled. In old walled
gardens, snowy masses of fruit-blossom seemed to focus the sunlight
and give it back intensified. On the banks of the river ancient
wood-encrusted buildings, square bridge-towers, the prim, delicate
lines of a chateau, all lived again, to their tenderest details, in
the water at their feet. Distances were marvellously clear. To the
north a chain of mountains drew its bold profile against the sky;
behind the town, a second chain rose a little more nearly, a little
less boldly: a ridge of infinitely blue hills, deeper in tint where
a cloud's shadow hovered or a valley narrowed&mdash;two natural
walls to the fertile, Rhine-washed plain. Peterle's mother had not
far to go, but she covered the ground painfully: the roads were
cobbled, and her unused feet burned. Her way led her through the
old inner town, where the winding streets were narrowest; the
electric tram-cars, which came bounding along in a series of jerks,
were so incongruously big that they called to mind unnatural stage
proportions. Twelve o'clock had not yet rung out from the many
steeples, but in shops and offices the midday rest had already been
called, and the pavements were black with people. In the roadway
companies of soldiers, in various uniforms, were returning to
barracks from drill on the military grounds outside the city gates:
at their head rode or strode their lieutenant, dusty and begrimed
as they. Peterle's mother paused, with a quickened interest, to
watch a handful of sappers salute a general: he pranced by, proud
and gaudy, and the parade-step hammered the stones. On a bridge
spanning the river she drew up anew, to look over at the fishers
who dotted the paved footpath that ran level with the water: they
stood vacant yet absorbed, lost in ponderous expectation of the
fish that never bit. Farther downstream were moored the floating
wash-houses&mdash;shallow, roofed barges, in which women knelt to
scrub, and rinse, and wring. Alongside of the tramway lines, sturdy
dogs strained at their harness in milk and ice-carts;
vegetablemongers cried their wares; yellow post-vans, manned by
blue-coated officials, lumbered heavily. Over all this noise and
colour, over toiling women, fishermen and soldiers, over a
congeries of gabled housetops, hooded chimneys, storks' nests, rose
the slender solitary tower of the immortal Minster, a landmark on
the plain for many a mile round&mdash;from afar off, when the rest
of the town still lay level with the horizon, this spire rose like
a giant finger pointing skywards&mdash;and, in wandering about the
place, did one by chance turn into a certain little narrow street,
the vast pile itself, all the red-brown glories of portal and
facade, broke upon the sight with a splendour that took the breath
away. Seen thus, by one standing midge-like in the shade of its
mighty walls, the lace-work of the tapering spire pierced so far
into the sky, was so little more than a streak of filigree against
the blue, that it was hard to believe it the work of human hands:
the ancient houses, six and seven stories high, that ringed in the
square, reached but to the foot of the great rose-window. And when
storms were abroad, and clouds raced and flew, it was possible to
fancy one saw, with the naked eye, the yielding swing of the frail
apex to the wind.</p>

<p>In his wheeled bed, Peterle blinked and averted his face from
the too vivid light. Before the open stall of an arcade he made a
long halt, his bald head bare to the sun, while his mother, over
some trivial purchase, drank in the gossip of the saleswoman, the
immense black bow of whose head-dress filled the narrow opening
like the outspread wings of a bat. Crossing a leafy square, the two
entered a side street. In this, Peterle's home to be, the pavement
formed a mere edging to the houses, from the Overhanging upper
stories of which the inmates could talk across in everyday
tones.</p>

<p>At a doorway two men were standing. One had a long black cigar
between his lips.</p>

<p>"<i>Boschur, Mamsell Henriette</i>!" he greeted affably,
steadying the cigar with his hand: it was an itinerant
vegetable-hawker, who lodged in the family attic. "Welcome home!
But you bring back more luggage than you started with. I see!"</p>

<p>A binder's apprentice from the ground floor capped the
pleasantry; and both laughed.</p>

<p>Peterle's mother did not turn colour. "<i>Boschur Bisamme</i>!"
she gave back politely and impassively. Then, since it was beyond
her strength to get the perambulator, with Peterle in it, up the
two high steps leading to the front door, she first carried in the
child, whom she laid on the wooden lid of the pump, just over the
threshold; then, returning, dragged, bumped and coaxed the unwieldy
carriage after.</p>

<p>It was a very old house, of generous proportions. In earlier
times, before the town had burst its girdle of river and canal,
this alley had been an aristocratic dwelling-place; and the heavily
brassed door, which now swung to and fro on its leather pad, had
remained shut to the street, in proud reserve. Both flights of
stairs ended in landings the size of a goodly room. On the first of
these, the walls were composed of enormous presses, built in, and
faced with mirrors&mdash;or what had once been mirrors; for the
glass had long since disappeared: great cupboards, in which a man
could stand upright. On the second story they were wanting: but, in
the low, spacious rooms themselves, the fireplaces, supplanted now
for a score or more years by unlovely iron stoves, were equally
ornate with those of the <i>bel-etage</i>: oil-paintings and small
looking-glasses were inserted in their woodwork, which was carved
by hand, and had once been white.</p>

<p>This upper landing, which Peterle's mother reached panting for
breath, was sand-strewn, and two oleanders grew in tubs. In a dark
little kitchen overlooking the courtyard, a man with his arm in a
sling sat smoking, an empty wine-carafe on the table before him.
His chin was sunk on his breast, and he did not glance up at the
ascending step; nor did Peterle's mother pause to greet him. She
went past, into the front room where she housed with her children,
and, in default of the perambulator, laid her infant on one of the
great feather beds, in a nest burrowed out by Willi and still
warm.</p>

<p>On entering the kitchen she found her stepfather in the same
dejected attitude.</p>

<p>"No better, Father?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, without speaking. He was down on his luck at
present. A stone mason, earning his six marks a day, he had had the
misfortune to break his arm: it had been set crooked by a quack in
the neighbourhood; and when he went, under protest, to the
hospital, the doctors had held it necessary to re-break and re-set
the limb.&mdash;In person, he was a small, blond, sallow man, with
a pair of ethereal blue eyes.</p>

<p>Peterle's mother, while waiting for a pan of milk to boil, drew
a chair to the table.</p>

<p>He eyed her lackadaisically. "Where's the child?"</p>

<p>She pointed with her thumb over her shoulder, wasting no words.
She was reckoning up the days that must elapse before she could go
out to work again.&mdash;Not that there was any very pressing need
for her to do so. Besides what Mother earned by charring, they had
three of their rooms let; and this was enough to keep them; for
they were thrifty folk. Still, Father, as a good German, liked his
chunk of beef in the pot at midday&mdash;liked a genuine meat soup,
not a sham one, such as was sometimes served in even the best
houses&mdash;and his keg of red wine in the cellar. The children
ran through boots and clothes; there was now an extra mouth to
feed; while she, too, if she was to dance this summer, must have a
new blouse, a neckerchief, a pair of pointed shoes.&mdash;And, as
she sat there, her hands open in her lap, her body as limp as
though some of the bones had been withdrawn from it, Henriette let
her thoughts stray to one of her partners of the year before: a
merry, black-eyed Italian overseer this, who had brought a gang of
navvies up over the Gotthard, and, on leaving, had more than
half-promised to return. In fancy she talked hot nothings with him
at <i>Fuchs am Buckel</i>, or tripped it at the <i>Messti</i> in
Ruprechtsau...</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though, such dreams were idle: there was Peterle to
watch and tend. And this, and much more, she did, with the mute and
stoic patience that was in her. Unaided, too. For, regularly at
seven of the clock, Peterle's grandmother pinned on shawl and
apron, took her big covered basket, and went forth to char. She was
in constant demand, being the pink of cleanliness, and honesty
itself; and never of her own free will did she spend a day at home.
This setting out of a morning was her panacea, <i>her</i> method of
surmounting the dullness of existence. She savoured the excitement
of seeing below the surface of strange households; forgot herself
and her home troubles in sipping at the overflow of other people's
fates. And so Henriette, left to herself, washed, dressed and fed
her children; cooked the family meals; held the house spotless; and
for a time her sole outing was to the market, whence she would come
back bearing, on top of the necessaries, such dainties as half a
pound of frogs' hind legs, delicate and juicy, a bowl of green
gherkins, or red cranberries, or blue bilberries; or, greatest
titbit of any, a lump of jellied eel.</p>

<p>In the sunny front room, Peterle, a tiny prisoner to life, lay
stretched and bound in his carriage bed. Between sunrise and sunset
a variety of things happened to him. Fairly early he was washed;
and thereby he learned to know the taste of yellow soap, and to
writhe under its cruel bite in the eye. Then, his top having been
coated, his naked legs were seized and thrust into a kind of
pillow-case, in which they were tied up. Only when a fresh
loincloth became necessary were they free to kick and
sprawl&mdash;two diminutive sticks, lean as the bare wish-bones of
a chicken. His feeding-bottle was his first love; and its
appearance had power to throw him into transports of delight, long
before he was able to recognise her who held it: as if mounted on
wires, his tiny arms would work towards it, his hampered legs
feebly trying to imitate the motion. Next in favour stood his
"comforter" though with this he could, on occasion, pick a quarrel.
But just awake, his judgment still cloudy with sleep, he would
start, did he find this friend at his lips, to suck with tremendous
energy, believing it to be the mouthpiece of his adored bottle; and
then, instead of the soft thick flow of milk, empty air-bubbles
would drive down his little gullet.&mdash;Gradually, there emerged
from chaos the gracious author of bottle and comforter, and he
learned to know the touch of the kind hands that caressed his body.
His brothers, on the contrary, were early objects of fear to him.
Gustave pinched him on the quiet, and made ugly faces at him, once,
too, dropping into the perambulator something slimy and ice-cold,
which hopped on to Peterle's face, and caused him to make agonised
protest. Willi was less to be dreaded. Willi snuggled down beside
him, slobbered over him, and indulged in wild bouts of tickling him
in the stomach. He practically never went out. His world was the
big old square wicker perambulator, the dark walls of which hemmed
him in on three sides, the fourth consisting of his featherbed,
beneath which, throughout the summer, he lay unresistant. For sky
he had the dingy ceiling of the room, on which the flies walked
upside down. These flies were his enemies: they descended by the
dozen to investigate his sticky little lids, to feed on his
succulent dribblings. And his blind strokes fought them in vain, or
dismayed them only for an instant: they retired, rubbed their
probosces clean, and came back to tickle and bite anew.</p>

<p>Thus the first tender weeks slipped away, added themselves to a
month, then to two, and to three. In the life around the
perambulator certain changes took place. Even twice-broken arms
heal at last; and, sooner or later after childbirth, the colour
comes back to the cheek, springiness to the step. Henriette's slim
form looked as girlish as of old. On her meek and placid face alone
was the stamp of her maternity visible; and even in this, which
time would surely hammer into a replica of her life-worn mother's,
the blue eyes could still flash with pleasure, the pupils darken
and dilate.</p>

<p>That was a hot summer. Day for day, the sun beat on the
hard-baked ground. At five o'clock of an afternoon, stone steps
were still too hot to be touched by the bare hand. The roads that
led countrywards from the several gates of the city were inches
deep in a dust that powdered white, trees, vehicles and people.</p>

<p>With the dusk, the river vanished beneath a pall of white mist;
mists hung over the woody swamps at its edge. Above these danced,
in millions, the giant Rhine-mosquitoes. At nightfall they raided
the town, where those sweating inhabitants, whom experience had not
rendered artful, became their prey. In Peterle's home no
extraordinary care was exercised; and the babe's bald head, his
soft face and hands, were soon a mass of sores.</p>

<p>Still, the young life made headway: the blue eyes learnt to turn
corners, to follow people about the room, to linger with approval
on the mother form. Then, however, a week broke that was big with
consequence for every one.</p>

<p>Now, it was midsummer: the tubbed oleanders, everywhere set out,
were masses of intolerable red sweetness. In the town park, the
green knobs that dotted the orange-trees were turning yellow; the
hanging-gardens on roofs and balconies shrivelled for want of
water, or ran wild. Dwelling-houses were deserted, given over to
easygoing caretakers. The German residents had fled, exasperated:
even the sun-loving Alsatian, rejoiced though he was by their
absence, thought it time to make a move: and were it only to a
hired cottage outside the walls of the town. Here might be seen
little black-eyed boys in barred stockings and without coats; here
were dolly little girls, and thin, natty women in black, or
masterful, high-bosomed business women, who had come out from the
counting-house of some <i>Magasin de Commerce</i>, some
<i>epicerie</i> or <i>patisserie</i>, to sit about in overgrown
vegetable-gardens, and inhale the rarer air. The inhabitants of the
most ancient quarters&mdash;the <i>Bungaverts</i>, or <i>Klein
Frankreich</i>&mdash;frequented the pavement-cafes, and made
excursions of a Sunday.</p>

<p>About this time Peterle's mother went out to dance. It was not
quite a novelty: more than once of late Henriette had rebelled
against the confinement of the long, sultry evenings, and Peterle
had wept for her ministrations in vain. But now came a certain
Sunday when even the blindest might have seen that something was in
the wind. Henriette, having gone about all the morning in petticoat
and bed-jacket, began to prepare herself festally directly the
midday-meal was over. Taking off her bodice, and exposing her grey
cotton corset, above which showed the unbleached linen of her
shift, she let down her black hair and combed it. Like that of most
aspiring merry-makers, her temper was none of the best; she grew
short even with Willi, when he clung to her skirts and hindered
her: she shook and slapped him: and both babies piped in unison.
Her arms and neck lathered and dried, she drew on her best blouse
and laid her shawl in readiness, moving about the room in her
stocking-soles; for the new pointed shoes, which she had just freed
from tissue-paper, were tight, and she spared herself their nips
and pinches till the last. Meanwhile her stepfather went in and
out, in a white dickey and a black suit, of which only the coat had
still to be donned: this hung brushed and folded over a chair. At
three o'clock the pair set off. Henriette was very cross indeed
when it came to leaving the children, and many were the reproaches
heaped on the absent grandmother's head. For Grandmother, after
promising to stay at home and mind them, had, in the end, let
herself be seduced by a wedding engagement; and, since none of the
three adults was willing to forgo a pleasure: skat, a wedding, and
the dance respectively: there was nothing for it but to shut the
door on the little ones, and trust to luck that they would come to
no harm.</p>

<p>But the six-year-old Gustave was also bent on holiday-making;
and having watched his elders turn the corner, he straightway
reached for the milk, being resolved to get the nourishing of the
infants, with which he had been entrusted, over once and for all.
In this, he was unlucky enough to upset the jug: he fled the
consequences, and played truant in the streets till evening. As
feeding-time drew near, Peterle and Willi became as restless as
caged animals in a Zoo; but their protests went unheard: and
finally Peterle, a baffled, empty, outraged babe, cried himself to
sleep, and slept till he was wakened by his grandmother's
hands.</p>

<p>To her cares ensued a period of sated repose. Then again he was
disturbed.</p>

<p>It was the middle of the night. High, angry voices, broken by
sobs, filled the room. The grandmother it was who wept; Henriette,
like a statue come to life, was talking, talking, in a passionate,
threatening way. Her stepfather sat at the table, his head between
his hands, sullen and malignant; a kitchen lamp, backed by a round
tin radiator, shed its blinding glare on his eyes, heavy with wine.
When Peterle woke and cried, Henriette snatched him from his bed
and cuddled him to her. The mother-arms soothed his wailing; and
over his head the bandying of taunts and accusations went on,
punctuated by the grandmother's lament of: "Ah! it's me that ought
to go. Yes, if <i>I</i> were out of the way!"</p>

<p>Henriette's black brows drooped over her wrathful blue eyes,
which glowered at her stepfather. "Mother had two when you took
her!"</p>

<p>"Two...yes!"</p>

<p>"What! You'd throw this up at me, would you?"&mdash;and she
jerked Peterle forward.</p>

<p>He pshawed. "But here you'd be off down over the Alps with this
blackamoor!"</p>

<p>"Blackamoor yourself! He's willing to marry me."</p>

<p>"And you'd go?...leave us all?...never come back? Henriette!
<i>Madele</i>!"</p>

<p>He pleaded with her, in a low voice, talking volubly. And
Henriette let herself be moved; she ceased to be angry, lost her
readiness of tongue, and drooped her head till it touched the head
of the child, fallen into a light sleep on her heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly the relative calm was broken by a rude hubbub without.
This proved to be the vegetable-hawker who lived in the attic: he
was mounting the stairs, plainly neither sober nor alone. An
indignant family met him on the landing and barred his way,
Grandmother even coming out of her bed, to which she had retired;
and the candle she held aloft illumined her wispy grey hair, her
night-costume of jacket and shift, her thin naked legs. All three
were justly irate: theirs was a respectable and orderly house, and
no <i>wackes</i> should carry on in it with promiscuous
<i>Frauenzimmer</i>, if they could help it! The hawker, too drunk
to argue, leaned against the wall and stuttered irrelevancies. But
the good-looking piece his companion was only mildly tipsy, and did
not shrink from parley. The rough dialect flew. At length she was
got downstairs and locked out into the street, where her abuse died
away; and the other inhabitants, who had been peeping curiously
from their doors, closed them and withdrew. The hawker was half
cajoled, half bullied up the third flight to his attic; after which
two nervous women, one with a fretful babe at her breast, sat in
the dark on the bottom stair, till the drunkard's light went out,
and snores told of his physical collapse.</p>

<p>In the further course of that night Henriette, having unwisely
drunk a glass of beer after eating stone fruit, was taken very
unwell. Time and again she started up from feverish dreams, in
which the dapper Italian, his languishing eyes, his milk-white
teeth and coal-black moustachios played the leading part&mdash;was
wakened by spasms of knifelike pain.</p>

<p>Next morning she was limp and distracted; and hasty-handed with
two peevish little children. She had a hard day's work before her,
too. In addition to her ordinary job, the main item of which was
"doing" the room of the second lodger, who, a late sleeper, rose at
the last possible moment, threw on her clothing and fled for the
shop in which she was employed, carrying her <i>brioche</i>
half-eaten in her hand, and leaving everything, even to the freeing
of her comb from its fluff of dead hair, to Henriette: in addition
to this, which always took a considerable time, to-day was the day
on which the big front room had to be turned out and set in
order.</p>

<p>For twenty-nine or thirty days in the month, the family had free
use of this room: and they availed themselves of it, with due
respect for its contents. For here were gathered the handsomest
strip of carpet, a console-pedestal and mirror, a suite of
furniture, an embroidered table cover, bunches of dried grasses and
artificial flowers. The room had two large windows, flanked by
scarlet geraniums, which blossomed furiously in the fierce sun; and
the bed stood in a curtained alcove. The tenant, an elegant and
formidable Councillor of justice, "in the best years," paid them
rent to the amount of twenty marks a month.&mdash;In person he was
tall, dark and colourless; and wore a shiny black pointed beard,
gold spectacles, buttoned patent-leather boots, and lemon-coloured
kid gloves.</p>

<p>So, throughout the morning, Henriette swept and scrubbed and
polished, sometimes heaving a sigh, sometimes rebuking her
children, but for the most part silent as a songless bird.</p>

<p>After dinner, when Gustave had gone back to, school, when
everything was clean and shining, and she herself washed and
dressed, she lingered by the flower-box to snip off the withered
leaves from the overgrown geraniums. The window in the mansard
opposite was open, and the man who was dying of consumption behind
it had pushed a sickly indiarubber-plant out into the guttering. No
sun fell on that side of the street, and the plant looked as
unwholesome as himself. On seeing Henriette, he pulled his blue
lips back over his gums, in what was meant to be a smile, and
addressed her in the stringy voice that made her think of a cracked
guitar.</p>

<p>"You look pale to-day."</p>

<p>Henriette heard the malice in his tone&mdash;the satisfaction
with which he verified the decrease of colour in another's
cheeks&mdash;and the attitude of defiance she instinctively assumed
was that of the living towards the dead.</p>

<p>She nodded vengefully.</p>

<p>"I was dancing last night."</p>

<p>"In this heat? I thank God it wasn't me!"</p>

<p>"And now I'm going out."</p>

<p>"Why not? I&mdash;I, too, shall go out next week!" he gave back,
devoured by hatred, well knowing that he would never set foot in
the sunlit streets again.</p>

<p>Henriette turned contemptuously away. The liar!...thinking he
could befool a person like that.&mdash;And she made a great show,
knowing he watched her, of pinning on her neckerchief and dressing
the children.</p>

<p>The idea of going out had been invented only to annoy him. Now,
however, she asked herself why not. Why should she not take the
afternoon off, and join father for the <i>Vierebrot</i>, at his
work on the banks of the Little Rhine?</p>

<p>With the aid of a neighbour she got the perambulator down the
stairs, and laid Peterle in it. At his feet she put his bottle, a
cake for Willi, and a surprise for Father in the shape of a big
white beer-radish. Above this came the feather-bed, and on top of
all perched Willi, his legs dangling over the side of the
carriage.</p>

<p>Henriette pushed this load through the summer streets, in bent
and muscle-less fashion. While in the crowded inner town, she
walked mainly in the middle of the roadway; for in places the
footpath was not much more than a glorified doorstep. But having
crossed a bridge, she came into the modern quarter, where the
streets were wide, and tree-lined. Arrived at the east gate, she
followed a narrow canal that linked the two rivers. High poplars
edged the path: she rested for a time on a shady seat. Barges, so
heavily laden that their rims were level with the water, moved
forward inch by inch; women sat at their helms and steered, or
dandled infants, or hung out washing; their little chimneys smoked,
noisy dogs raced yapping from stern to prow. These barges were
towed by men, three abreast, yoked like oxen and bronzed to
blackness, who crawled laboriously along the towing-path, head and
neck bent, eyes fixed on the ground. Beyond the canal was a
sprinkling of old French villas, painted in delicate pinks and
lavender-greys, one and all furnished with heavy green shutters,
and surrounded by damp, overgrown gardens. Stiff rows of poplars
led up to them. On some steps that ran down to the water,
washer-women were at work: they knelt and scrubbed garments with
brushes on the wooden steps. Now and then one of them would sit
back on her haunches, and hold up for scrutiny some gaudy red or
blue rag; after which, bending forward, she plunged it afresh into
the water. The swing-bridge was in motion when Henriette got to it,
and she made one of a group that watched, with idle interest, a
bigger barge than usual glide through. Crossing it, she shuffled
through the dust of the road. The bicycles that dashed to and fro
left long, slowly subsiding trails, as of smoke, in their wake. By
a weir stood the last little inn, in the garden of which workmen
and bargemen sat at <i>Vesperbrot</i>. But Henriette went further,
went round the corner and out among the sandbank cones, where she
found her stepfather smoking in sight of his work&mdash;the
repairing of the stone embankment that protected the low-lying,
wooded ground from the inroads of the swift and shifty Rhine.</p>

<p>Here they ate their meal. Not many words passed between them.
Willi had to be kept from under the wheels of the bicycles that
spun along to the end of the parapet: had to be dabbed with spittle
for the relief of gnat and mosquito bites. Peterle gave trouble,
too. For the first time in his life, after lustily crying for food,
he refused his bottle, averting his head when it was offered to
him, pushing the mouthpiece away with protruded lips. Henriette
felt the milk anxiously: it was still warm, as how could it fail to
be, considering it had been sat on by Willi, and used as a
foot-warmer by the babe himself? She tried it, but could taste
nothing wrong; so, following her stepfather's advice, she dropped
in several lumps of sugar, begged from the inn. Having shaken the
bottle till these dissolved, she forced the teat between Peterle's
lips; and now he drank, though not with his usual gusto.</p>

<p>Until both children slept, she caused the carriage to move
gently to and fro. Then, she felt herself nudged.</p>

<p>"Look here, my girl, would you like a new neckerchief?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I've got one."</p>

<p>"Aye, but a handsomer than that?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ne</i>, it's good enough."</p>

<p>"One with roses on it."</p>

<p>"Roses?" Her eyes ceased their straying; the pupils grew.</p>

<p>"Aye, great roses, and forget-me-nots, and madonna lilies! On a
yellow ground."</p>

<p>"Lilies? Where 'ud you get it from?"</p>

<p>"Where d'you think? <i>Madele</i>, <i>schau her</i>!" and from
an inner pocket the man drew forth a slim packet, folded in tissue
paper. Opening it, he disclosed the lovely cloth.</p>

<p>Henriette gasped.</p>

<p>"Makes you open your eyes, lass, what? Put it on!"</p>

<p>Dazzled, Henriette removed her own drab little cape, and laid
the new finery round her shoulders. Her eye hung reverently on the
silky texture; her fingers followed it. "How pretty!...oh, how
pretty!"</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" He spat, well content. "Cost me the
inside of a five-mark piece. And now just you remember it was me
that bought it&mdash;me, <i>Madele</i>...for you!"</p>

<p>Long after her stepfather had gone back to work, she sat with it
still about her; and more than one of his fellow-workmen sent a
glance at the girl in her grandeur, which set off, by vivid
contrast, her raven black hair, lake-blue eyes, and pale, oval
face.</p>

<p>Then, however, suddenly waking from her reverie, she saw that a
great army of storm clouds had come up and was resting on the
mountains, which in their turn had drawn perceptibly nearer.
Hastily removing the neck-cloth and tucking it into the
perambulator, she straightened out her children and pushed off on
her homeward journey. It was none too soon: as she entered the
house the first raindrops fell, the size of florins, and
simultaneously came a loud clap of thunder.</p>

<p>Not many minutes later a messenger handed in the fruit, flowers
and sweet-meats which the <i>Justizrat</i> never failed to provide;
and, shortly after, Mamsell Mimi herself arrived in person to
decorate and arrange.</p>

<p>These were gala evenings. Grandmother left her job early; Father
came straight home from work. For they all adored Mamsell Mimi,
who, when she had finished what she came to do, usually stayed for
supper with the family, bringing lollipops to the children, and to
their elders a goodly supply of piquant gossip. For Mamsell Mimi
knew life; she had also frank and cynical opinions about it, and a
sprightly, over-charged tongue. She was a big, handsome woman, with
golden hair, and a figure that swept in and out in astonishing
curves&mdash;like those of the letter S. In observing her, the
wonder grew that it was possible exactly to control such a
surplusage of flesh. And indeed, after she had eaten, and was
sitting at ease on the sofa, she herself offered scant apology for
loosening both bodice and corset.</p>

<p>"Or I shall explode with the heat, good people!...go off pop,
like a child's balloon. Heavens! The struggle it is to keep one's
figure!"</p>

<p>For figure was the <i>sine qua non</i> of her
profession&mdash;that of <i>Buffletdame</i> in a popular
restaurant&mdash;and the wasp waist and monstrous billowing of the
bosom were as necessary to success in it as a good head for
arithmetic and a pretty wit. She looked longingly forward, she told
them&mdash;between ear-splitting crashes of thunder&mdash;to the
day when, casting constraint and care for appearance behind her,
she would be able to live wholly in <i>neglig&eacute;e</i>. That
would come to pass when she retired from business and settled down,
it might be with a good, complaisant husband, it might also be
without. For herself, she would prefer to be free. Men were too
great a nuisance; one had always to be dancing to their tune. Now
in a village not far over the borders of Baden she had an old
motherkin, and there, too, lived her heart's darling, her little
cabbage, her <i>p'tit tonerl</i>, a strapping youngster some five
years old; and, if she pleased herself, she would take up her abode
with these two, and never again have to do with anything more
troublesome than pigs or hens. Of course, though, that would not be
for many a year yet; and Mamsell Mimi heaved a great boom of a sigh
that resembled a soundless laugh; then drew a rapid sketch of
herself in the faded years, and laughed in earnest. Well, well!
when the day did come, she would at least be able to drink her fill
of beer. Now, if they would believe her, she was prohibited a drop.
Oh! she did not want to say a word against a certain person: he was
very generous to her, and in every respect <i>ein anstandiger
Mensch</i>; but they would not misunderstand her if she called him
exacting. Only two months ago it had almost come to a rupture
between them; he had accused her of letting herself go, of growing
fat, of enjoying her <i>Munchener</i> on the sly: and&mdash;would
they believe it?&mdash;next time he had actually brought a
yard-measure in his pocket, to see if his suspicions were
justified. Fortunately, she had been able to persuade him that the
extra inch was due to a bulkier petticoat; but it had given her,
all the same, a shock, and the very next day she had purchased new
corsets, of the rigour of iron&mdash;yes, truly! an iron bandage,
in which she had ever since been encased. Except at night: that she
could not bring herself to. Some did, who were more ambitious than
she; but she&mdash;<i>Ach Herrje</i>!&mdash;she loved her ease too
well. One night she had made the effort, and in the morning had
been obliged, on rising, to part with the cheese and cucumber of
which she had partaken for supper. Such a thing had never happened
to her before. No, there was no doubt the skinny and
bony&mdash;though she did not envy them!&mdash;had the best of it.
It was simple enough for <i>them</i> to imitate nature; and here
followed several merry tales of the ruses "the scrags" resorted to.
But even they ran a constant risk&mdash;that of discovery. <i>Ach,
du mein Gottele</i>! women truly did not have an easy time of it in
this difficult world.</p>

<p>Thus talked Mamsell Mimi; and, of her three hearers, the smoking
man smiled cynically and nodded, while the two pale, pack-horse
women drank in, open-mouthed, their guest's gay wisdom. All the
time she talked, she dandled Peterle, who was restless and would
not sleep: it was the thunder had unsettled his stomach, said
Grandmother, and gave him her horny, work-seamed finger to suck.
Mamsell Mimi adored children: her dream would have been, she vowed,
to have a dozen of them round her, one always small enough to fill
her arms. But <i>Gott bewahre</i>! such joys were not for the like
of her: her single one, her Tonikin, had added a whole stone to her
weight. Love them, though, that she could!&mdash;and she hugged
Peterle to her great bosom, which&mdash;<i>nicht wahr, meine
Lieben</i>?&mdash;they would have judged able to nourish the dozen
of which she dreamed; whereas, if they could credit it, for her
treasure, her well-beloved little cock-chafer, it had yielded not
so much as a mouthful. And so she fondled Peterle, drawing him to
her, then holding him away again to look at him, many times in
succession, always with loud smacks of kisses in between.&mdash;In
the course of which Peterle hiccupped, and was very sick.</p>

<p>He was sick again after Mamsell Mimi's great deep laugh had died
away on the stairs, leaving its echo on the different floors, and a
pleased content in the hearts of all who heard it that something so
big and handsome and jolly as this woman should exist. He was sick
also several times later on; Henriette was in and out of bed with
him during the night. And next day the sickness continued; he could
not keep his milk down, and, unless she paced the floor with him,
cried unceasingly. She hardly dared to let him out of her arms, for
fear his wailing might disturb the inmates of the front room. In
the afternoon, as other violent symptoms set in, and he had twice
turned from milk altogether and was tossing as if in pain, she bore
him to a wise woman who lived in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>This person who, in the intervals of her profession as midwife,
carried on a kind of surreptitious practice, poohpoohed Henriette's
fears. It was merely an attack of indigestion: a "spoilt stomach."
She prescribed doses of camomile-tea; but, more especially,
cognac.</p>

<p>"A dash in each bottle, <i>Fra&uuml;lein</i>&mdash;that's all
that's needed. He'll take to it, you see, like a cat to fish."</p>

<p>But this was not the case: Peterle continued to avert his face
when his bottle was presented to him, to wail, and to slobber a
watery fluid. Next morning, as he looked pinched about mouth and
nose, and did not seem able to wake up properly, his mother put him
in the perambulator and wheeled him through the sunshine to a free
dispensary for children, in the new quarter of the town: among the
stratum of the population to which Henriette belonged, they were
held to know "double as much about children" as at the real
hospitals.</p>

<p>After waiting half an hour she was called into a room built
wholly of white tiles. The doctor was in a white overall, flanked
by a Sister, also in stiff, white starch. Henriette felt that she
and Peterle, well washed as their garments were, formed drab blots
on the snowiness of the room. Otherwise the doctor, a youngish man,
gave principally an impression of squareness: his yellow beard was
cut square, as was also his brushlike hair; he had a square
forehead, and large square hands. But he was not ungentle, and had,
besides, the shortsighted man's ingratiating habit of pushing up
his glasses while he talked, and smoothing out a tired eye with a
band three fingers broad. He examined Peterle&mdash;far too
cursorily to please Henriette&mdash;touched him here and there with
a big white forefinger, and looked inside his mouth.</p>

<p>Her lengthy explanations were cut short. "You've been
careless."</p>

<p>This charge she could honestly rebut.</p>

<p>"Haven't troubled to boil the milk, eh?"</p>

<p>Henriette denied this, but less surely; she remembered how, on
the afternoon excursion, she had been in a hurry to set off, and
had thought the milk would "do"&mdash;was hot enough, the day being
so hot&mdash;without waiting for it to spin and bubble.</p>

<p>The doctor made an entry in his notebook. "Well, leave him here.
We'll see what we can do for him."</p>

<p>But at this Henriette hugged Peterle to her. "I'd rather look
after him myself."</p>

<p>"At your own risk then!"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders: he had no time to argue and
persuade; other mothers hushed sickly wailings in the outer room.
So, giving her some instructions, he bade her come back with the
child next day. But as she disappeared he could not refrain from
saying hotly to the Sister at his side: "You women are not fit even
to look after your own children. They should be taken from you at
birth."&mdash;At which the woman who, being young, and radiant with
health, thought him the most wonderful man in the world, merely
smiled.</p>

<p>Henriette did not return: a wild fear gripped her lest they
should have some power policeman-like to wrest Peterle from her.
As, however, next morning the babe was perceptibly worse, she
carried him to one of the hospitals. Here, the doctor was less
gentle. He turned back Peterle's eyelid as carelessly as though it
had been a dead leaf, and said gruffly: "Why come here only when
the child is dying?" Still, he gave her the medicine she had been
counting on: you could always reckon on getting that at a proper
hospital: and the very size of the bottle, and the redness of the
fluid it contained, reassured her for the time being.</p>

<p>Next day, in despair, she fetched the wise woman. But now the
latter, too, only shrugged her shoulders, attributing the change
for the worse in Peterle's condition to want of faith in her
treatment.</p>

<p>"Take my advice, <i>Fra&uuml;lein</i>, and stick to milk.
Children don't never thrive on them barley messes."</p>

<p>But Peterle's day for milk was over. Inserted now dropwise
between his lips, it dribbled idly out again. He could not swallow:
his little mouth and throat were a bed of ulcers. All through the
long, hot afternoon, Henriette, unconscious of fatigue, paced the
floor with him, his head, hardly strewn yet with a light down,
lolling helplessly from side to side. And whenever she turned at
the door, to make the length of the narrow room again, she saw
fixed on her, at the opposite window, the glittering eye of the
living skeleton behind it&mdash;an eye alight with malignant
pleasure that it was no longer he only, who was to be called on to
leave daylight and the sun.</p>

<p>Towards evening her strength gave out: she laid the babe back in
the perambulator. Here, beneath a square of mosquito-netting, the
mountain of feather-bed sloping steeply up over him, Peterle, alone
and unaided, fought his tiny, blind, unknowing way towards the
great dark...</p>

<p>The <i>Madame</i> for whom Henriette had worked before her
confinement, hearing of his plight, came to see him. She, being
tender-hearted, could not listen unmoved to his puny moans, and
shed tears of pity as, lifting the net, she peered down at the
waste bit of humanity beneath it.</p>

<p>"Give him air. Take off the feather-bed," she pleaded. But
Henriette shook her head: Peterle had had his comforts while he was
well; they should not be withdrawn from him now.</p>

<p>Towards evening his moans grew fainter, his little feet turned
cold. And just as dusk was settling definitely into night, he
heaved a sigh and died.</p>

<p>Henriette went out at once to fetch a doctor; and a young man in
the neighbourhood, who had a small, working-class practice, was
found to certify that Peterle Luthy, a male, of the Protestant
religion, aged four and a half months, had just, by reason of
infant cholera, ceased to breathe. As it was late, and his work
over for the day, the doctor was in no hurry to be gone. He sat and
enjoyed with Father a glass of red wine and a slice of
bilberry-tart, over which, having discovered in each other "good
<i>sozis</i>," they cracked the obligatory jokes concerning
"Siegfried Meyer's" latest dodge with regard to Morocco.</p>

<p>Next morning there was much to be done. Father set off earlier
than usual for work, that he might register the decease by the way.
Grandmother stayed at home from her job, without even troubling to
send word of her intention, "a death in the family" being a fact of
sufficient importance to allow a break with precedent. Henriette
walked to the cemetery, to arrange about the grave; and, on her
road there, ordered the coffin. This was to be made by a joiner who
lived a few doors down the street, and was promised for that
evening; for, in such hot weather, and considering the nature of
the illness...</p>

<p>All day Peterle lay in state on the top of a chest of drawers.
He had several visitors&mdash;an ugly, shrivelled little yellow
doll, in a dress fantastically bunched up with blue ribbons. Two
real wax candles burnt at his head and feet. These were a present
from Mamsell Mimi, and had been brought by special messenger. There
was also a magnificent wreath of painted tin immortelles. The
kind-hearted <i>Madame</i>, on the news being carried to her, had
given Henriette three marks for a wreath. The latter chose, not
living flowers, which would be dead by the morning, but this solid
and enduring symbol, which would last for weeks, even months, to
come; which would still be there, still existent, when all that
remained of little Peterle had become a thing unspeakable, from
which thought shrank away...</p>

<p>His coffin, a small deal box, painted a light and vivid green,
was a misfit balcony flower-box, which the joiner seized this
opportunity to get rid of.</p>

<p>"For such a little man as him one must have something bright and
cheerful," he said chattily, while he inserted the body. Adding
piously, as he noted Henriette's downcast air: "And give thanks,
<i>Fra&uuml;lein</i>, that it has pleased the Lord to put an end to
his pain."</p>

<p>Next morning the perambulator, with the green box inside it, was
carried down the stairs once more. There was no need to-day for the
feather-bed. Henriette spread a shawl across the foot-end of the
box, and upon this perched Willi, his legs dangling over the side
of the carriage.</p>

<p>The cemetery was a long way off&mdash;was out beyond the
octroi-house and the city walls. The dusty road wound slightly
uphill, and Henriette had to exert all her strength. In the
vicinity of a barracks she passed many idle, lolling soldiers, and
heard expressions of curiosity about the contents of her box, only
one or two catching sight of the wreath and baring their heads. At
the grave there was no time for ceremony: Peterle was lowered and
covered over almost before you could count twenty, Henriette's
chief concern being to prevent Willi from falling in and getting
buried, too. The mound raised, she laid the tin wreath on it: by
this she would know in future where Peterle lay.</p>

<p>Her load was lighter now. But now, too, for the first time, she
felt how tired she was. And on the way home, Willi having fallen
asleep, she sat down at the table of a pavement-cafe to drink a
glass of beer. Her arms felt, and no doubt for a day or two would
feel, strangely empty. Still, it was better so. Two were enough,
more than enough. And she would take care&mdash;oh! such
care...</p>

<p>Her thoughts swam to a mist. She fell into a doze as she sat,
under the stainless violet-blue of the summer sky. Then, however,
waking with a start, she sprang to her feet with a guilty sense of
work undone; and laying the money for the beer on the table, pushed
with fresh zeal for home.</p>

<p>And before the sun went down that night, it was almost as though
Peterle had never been.</p>

<h3>The Professor's Experiment</h3>

<p><b>I.</b>
</p>

<p>The dusty sunlight of a June afternoon slanted in under the iron
shutters, which were lowered and thrust outwards, upon the
Professor and his sister, who sat at tea. The table was small, and
covered with a waxed cloth, the floor was laid with waxed linoleum,
and a tall, white, tiled stove stood like a gravestone in one
corner. The cups and saucers were Delft, and did not match.</p>

<p>For some moments the Professor was silent, twiddling the cord of
his eyeglasses between finger and thumb. Then, waking with a start,
he said: "Annemarie!...I will thank you to give me another cup of
tea."</p>

<p>For years he had, with these words, at this same hour of day,
passed his cup to be refilled. On the present occasion, however,
Annemarie, instead of taking it, jerked up her chin, gazed at him,
and ejaculated: "<i>Another</i>? But, Paulchen, you have already
had two!"</p>

<p>The Professor shot back his extended arm, and put his cup down
as though it had bitten him. "Indeed?" he said in confusion.
"I...that is, my thoughts must have been elsewhere."</p>

<p>"I think so, too," said Annemarie.</p>

<p>Raising the stocking she had on her pins to knitting level, she
became absorbed in the arithmetic of the heel. She was a tall,
angular woman, with large hands, a flat figure, and iron-grey hair.
Her speech had something of the drill-sergeant's bark; and it was
clear she was used to being obeyed, when, at the stroke of a clock,
she said shortly: "Five o'clock, Paulchen!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Annemarie. I heard it strike."</p>

<p>But, in place of rising to leave the room, the Professor
remained sitting, still fidgeting nervously with his cord.
Annemarie bore with this for a further second or two; then, letting
her knitting sink to her lap, she asked in a tone of stupefaction:
"But, Paulchen, is anything the matter? Is it possible you do not
intend to take your walk to-day?"</p>

<p>For the first time in his life the Professor felt that
Annemarie's emphasis was excessive, her regulation of his habits
overdone. Nevertheless, he at once got up, replacing his chair at
the table.</p>

<p>At which Annemarie added: "Besides, Marthe is waiting to clear
away the tea-things."</p>

<p>"Surely five minutes' delay will not seriously inconvenience
her, Annemarie?"</p>

<p>The protest was made in a tone of extreme diffidence, not to say
weakness; none the less, his attitude was so unheard-of that again
his sister sat dumbfounded. Worse still, he went out of the room in
the middle of her reply, leaving her with her words only half
uttered. Now, what in all the world!...Something must be seriously
amiss. Either Paulchen was going to be ill; or else some hitch had
occurred in connection with his <i>magnum opus</i>, the "Oscan
Declension," on which he had been at work for the past fifteen
years. It had happened more than once, during this time, that some
nimbler colleague had filched a valuable discovery from under his
very nose: Paulchen always cut his learned journals with a
trembling hand. Also, awkward crises had sometimes arisen when the
facts refused to fit into his theory of them. Being only a woman,
Annemarie understood little of learned details. But she knew that
these were black moments indeed, in her good Paulchen's life. Then
must all voices sink to a whisper, the felt-shod servant creep on
tip-toe past the study door; behind which Paulchen wrestled with
these devils of his own conjuring, and sought to bend them to his
will.</p>

<p>During the time it took Annemarie to meditate these things, in
picking her teeth with her spare needle, the Professor was dawdling
in the corridor&mdash;dawdling deliberately&mdash;for as long as he
dared. With his hat and umbrella laid in readiness, he made as
though he searched for his gloves&mdash;though these were snug in
his pocket&mdash;going into his bedroom on a pretended hunt for
them, and returning, openly bearing but one, while he smacked his
pockets for its fellow. The moment, however, a step on the stair
was heard, he snatched up hat and gamp, and in two-twos was outside
the door of the flat. Going down, he met the postman coming up, and
wordlessly held out his hand. The man, having once more peered
solemnly through his spectacles at a letter, handed it over, and
the Professor, after one hasty glance at the superscription, as
hastily thrust it into his pocket.</p>

<p>On emerging from the house, he opened a large grey cotton
umbrella, which he carried in a wrinkled grey cotton hand. It
shaded a grey felt hat, broad of brim and shapeless with age, which
would have suited a stage bandit. His blue-grey clothes, built for
ease rather than show, were so much too big for his short, thick
figure that the seat of the trousers hung far below that portion of
the body it was designed to fit; while the legs of the garment
descended in corkscrew folds over his elastic-sided boots. These
boots, shaped like spades, had as little pretence to form as the
rest of him, and continued a series of transverse lines which, in
their prodigality, would have delighted a Durer. But the eyes that
beamed from behind the double spectacles&mdash;cross-lined these,
too&mdash;were kindly, and the face, when pleased, had a childlike
candour and glow.</p>

<p>His way led him past small white villas, towered and turreted
like baronial halls; across shadeless, unfenced fields where
vegetables grew. It was very hot; and, on reaching the shade of an
avenue of poplars, the Professor sighed with relief. Entering the
town park and leaving a Gothic restaurant behind him, he crossed an
artificial lake, spanned by rustic bridges and dotted with
manufactured islets, and climbed a sham mountain path that wound
round an imitation precipice and led to a new plantation, where he
would be safe from interruption. Seating himself, the Professor
laid hat and umbrella at his side, and rubbed his spectacles free
of dust. His glasses on his nose again, however, he still let
several minutes go by before he drew from an inner pocket the
letter he had come out to read. He seemed timid of opening it. He
scrutinised it back and front, took in the size of the envelope,
the hour of posting, the wording of the address. At length, heaving
another sigh, he inserted his penknife and neatly slit it. It was
not a long letter, did not quite fill a page; and it was written in
a copperplate hand, minute as the strokes of an etching, regular as
print, the capitals alone opulent and handsome with their
prescribed loops and bows. In it the Professor could spy but two
errors: a redundant comma, and a slight tendency in the lines to
slant upward at the end. Perhaps, too...yes, perhaps the upper
strokes might have been a trifle lighter, the down a shade thicker.
That they failed in symmetry was no doubt due to the fact that,
while on the school-bench, the writer had let her mind
wander&mdash;had not kept perfect time with the teacher's beat,
according to which the whole class wrote in unison: a lift of the
baton for the up-strokes, a drop for the down. The little rogue!
The bewitching young lazy-bones! He could imagine her titivating at
a bow, or throwing sly glances at the spring buds that enticed
through the schoolroom windows. It was even possible that her
thoughts had strayed to this supreme moment of a female's
existence, of which none other than he was the begetter. Meanwhile,
his brain had swiftly taken in the contents of the letter. It was
what he had expected. There was mention in it of the great honour
done, of the happiness felt, of sincerest gratitude; and it bore
the signature "Elsa Braun." The Professor let the hand that held it
fall to his knee, and sat gazing at the arrangement of shrubs and
ferns on the rockery before him: they seemed suddenly to have grown
very lush and green. For the first time, too, he noticed that the
nightingales were uproarious in the surrounding bushes; while the
roses, trailing in festoons from post to post of the central
avenue, were a hot and scented mass of bloom.</p>

<p>The Professor was about to take the great step in life.</p>

<p>He had turned seven and forty, and it could not be said of him
that he was young for his age. Life had been something of a
struggle for him. For he had not been brought up to a profession,
but had spent his green years on the stool of a merchant's office.
He was well past the middle of the twenties before, finding himself
his own master, he had given the rein to his ambition, and begun to
equip himself for a learned career. Annemarie had joined her
slender means to his, both while he went through his course as a
student, and afterwards when he lived as unsalaried lecturer at the
university of his native town. Until he was ready to publish the
earliest results of his research&mdash;mere crumbs and droppings,
such as would not damage the appearance of his <i>magnum
opus</i>&mdash;brother and sister had scraped and pinched as one.
Shortly after the publication of his pamphlet, however, success had
come, and in a truly gratifying way. From <i>Privatdozent</i> he
had been made <i>Extra-ordinarius</i>; and, not six years later, an
invitation had reached him to fill the Chair of Comparative
Philology in his present place of abode.</p>

<p>Up till now, the Professor had lived absorbed in his work, as
blind to the visible world around him as the mole in its ebony
burrowings: roots, derivatives, and their subterranean branchings,
had been the world in which he was at home, a failure to trace a
radix his profoundest grief, success in this his most piquant joy.
But, having attained material prosperity&mdash;his income was the
princely one of six thousand marks a year; never again would he
feel the nip of poverty&mdash;he had grown conscious of a change in
himself. He was invaded by a set of soft, pushful feelings and
wishes, such as he had not dreamed were in him. He caught himself
remembering that he was, after all, only in middle age, with at
least fifteen years of energy and activity before him. And his eye
<i>would</i> range round the circle of his colleagues, whom he saw
one and all comfortably housed, with plump, devoted wives at their
elbows, their wives' furniture in their rooms, and knots of
thriving children at their heels. The comparison made his own home
seem the more cheerless. Annemarie's ideas of comfort had never
altered&mdash;were Spartan in their simplicity. And the wish rose
in him to line his own nest: to have at his side one to whom
<i>his</i> word would be law; to see his youth renewed in sons who
would look up to him and obey him.</p>

<p>These sensations were still chaotic in him when, as if in answer
to them, a suitable person crossed his path. First met on the
annual excursion of the Faculty to the mountains, in which
Annemarie did not join, owing to a corn on her foot, the young
woman in question, who was there under the wing of a friend, had at
once favourably impressed him, not only by her retiring, womanly
bearing, but also, it must be confessed, by a pleasing plumpness,
an air of only half-concealed drollery. He had had her as his
companion on the climb through a pine forest to a celebrated
nunnery; and later on, with a peculiar pleasure, had found himself
picking out her voice in the part-songs to which the moonshine
stirred the ladies. As he walked home from the railway-station, he
hummed what he believed to be these airs, while at the same time
his thoughts played round the mysterious charm of a woman's form.
Almost he forgot to enter the house quietly, so as not to disturb
Annemarie. In the weeks that followed he set a few private
inquiries on foot; engineered&mdash;with all caution, and so that
they committed to nothing&mdash;a couple of meetings with the lady
at the friend's house, and, finally resolved, with a great
heart-thump, with the sudden forcible-feeble courage of the weak,
to take the chance Fate offered, had, the day previously, made by
letter his proposal of marriage.</p>

<p>Things had gone smoothly with him; he had every reason to feel
satisfied; and he did&mdash;so long as he kept his mind off
Annemarie. At thought of her, the goose-flesh rose along his
thighs. How in all the world should he break the news to her, who
had no more suspicion of the truth than a babe unborn?</p>

<p>As far back as he could remember, Annemarie had lived for him
and domineered over him: she was eight years older than he, and her
word had always been law. In earlier life, he had accepted her
attitude as a matter of course. After entering on his present post,
however, it had begun to gall him; and now, with this momentous
step before him, it seemed sheerly unbearable. He was a person of
authority everywhere but in his own home. There, Annemarie held
sway; it was she who handled his salary, who prescribed his
expenditure: in spite of her pride in his learning, she was never
able to forget the days when she had cuffed him and cuddled
him.</p>

<p>The Professor was rebel against this yoke.</p>

<p>As he walked home&mdash;he had never in his life been late for a
meal&mdash;he told himself, for the dozenth time, that reason was
on his side; that the step he proposed to take was a natural one;
that he had neither selfishness nor unkindness with which to
reproach himself. That might be; but the seventeen years for which
Annemarie had gone through hardship and privation with him rose
like a century before his mind's eye. And, admit it or not, he knew
that he had acted in an underhand fashion. He had fixed the whole
matter before approaching her, making it firm, irremediable, an
instinct warning him that only in this way could he hope to bring
it off. The moisture broke out on his forehead; and the nearer he
drew to home, the more impossible did it seem that he could ever
tell her, in plain language, what he was about to do.</p>

<p>Annemarie was in the kitchen, slicing potatoes for a
salad&mdash;he saw her through a chink in the door&mdash;and before
he had been in his room for more than a couple of minutes came the
tinkle of the little hand-bell that called him to meals. A drop of
perspiration emerged from his hair, crossed his neck, and,
gathering momentum as it ran, trickled rapidly down his spine.</p>

<p>They sat opposite each other at table, and Annemarie prepared to
apportion the food. But the neat white heaps of cold potato shining
in oil, the red circlets of fat-flecked sausage were not fated to
be disturbed on their dishes. The guilty flurry, the red confusion
of the Professor's manner betrayed him; and, laying down spoon and
fork before these had touched the eatables, Annemarie demanded to
know what the matter was. His behaviour at tea-time had been
peculiar; Marthe had espied him receiving a letter, which he had
seemed to wish to hide&mdash;even the postman had made a joke about
it, on a later round&mdash;and she was resolved not to touch bite
or sup till she learnt what this meant. Had he come into conflict
with the university authorities?&mdash;he, her sober-minded,
order-loving brother? Or had the bank failed, that held their
scanty savings? Either of these would have been earthquake-events
in her life; but they were as nothing to the truth. When, at
length, from the Professor's stammerings, as from his last brutal
outburst, in which, despairing, he flung the truth like a ball at
her head: when Annemarie learnt the worst, she was paralysed. She
sat with her two hands pressed against the table and stared at him,
without uttering a word, till the poor little Professor shrivelled
in his seat, under sensations not unlike those he had felt when, as
a child, he had ripped a rent in the seat of new trousers, or, out
of curiosity to see if anything would happen to, him, had swallowed
his cherry-stones, instead of obediently parting with them as
ordered by Annemarie.</p>

<p>Then, she found her tongue, found words for her anger, her
contemptuous, unbounded amaze. Under their lash, the Professor
drank a hasty gulp of half-cold tea, wiped his forehead with his
table-napkin, and rose to pace the room. For now all manner of
unpleasant things came to light. He heard, for the first time, her
true opinion of him, heard of his weakness, his want of character.
It was very unpleasant, very unpleasant indeed.</p>

<p>But when she passed to herself, it was worse still.</p>

<p>"Have I failed in any way in my duty? Have I left anything
undone?"</p>

<p>"Annemarie! I assure you...On the contrary!"</p>

<p>"Then why have you served me this trick?"</p>

<p>"Annemarie, if...if...I&mdash;I..."</p>

<p>"I...I! If...if! Oh! that such a thing should happen...at your
age...an old man like you!...and after all I have done for
you."</p>

<p>"Annemarie!" said the Professor distractedly, and wrung his
hands. "Since you take it thus I will break off the match. I will
write to-night, and say it was a mistake-yes, all a mistake!"</p>

<p>"What?&mdash;and make yourself the laughing-stock of the town?
Have the person bring an action against you?&mdash;you?&mdash;at
your age? Is there no dignity in you? I knew it wasn't much, but so
little as this I never suspected it to be," cried his sister
shrilly. Oh, how painful was this scratching-up of the surface!</p>

<p>"Control yourself, Annemarie!" he implored her. "What if Marthe
should hear what you say?"</p>

<p>"What matters Marthe, when every one of our acquaintances must
soon know of your disgrace?"</p>

<p>Then she wept.</p>

<p>Her tears were the last straw. The Professor had never seen the
gaunt, manly woman cry, and, at the sight, was reduced to tears
himself. He outdid himself in expostulation and supplication,
knowing all the shame an erring son knows, when he sees his
mother's tears flow for his misdoing.</p>

<p>But she would not listen to him. "You've gone mad&mdash;mad!"
she cried, and, leaving him vainly reiterating: "My home will
always be yours," disappeared into her own room, and locked the
door.</p>

<p>The Professor spent a distracted night, and the letter he wrote
to his "bride" was stiff and cold. Annemarie's wrathful grief
numbed his faculties; now, he saw his action through her eyes, and
himself believed that he had not been far from madness when he
undertook it: reasons and excuses fell to pieces like burning
paper. All that beforehand had seemed to him natural and right took
on blackest shapes of folly and ingratitude.</p>

<p>Manlike, he had never thought out clearly what was to become of
his sister after his marriage; he had only said vaguely to himself
that she should never want. Now, the fatal promise that she should
continue to live with him given, he was chained to her as securely
as before. This had indeed not been a part of his scheme, and he
emitted sigh on sigh. Then, however, he shook himself, vowing that
nothing would be too much to atone to Annemarie for what she was
suffering: life comprised duty, not pleasure alone; and, after all,
blood-ties came before any other.</p>

<p>But this was not the end. Annemarie's tears dried, but her
tongue retained its sting; and in the days that followed she drove
home his crime to her brother, with wordy force: his ingratitude,
his cowardice, his age, the poltroonish figure he was going to cut:
till the Professor felt as if she had been saying these things to
him all his life. And, again and again, she put the unanswerable
question: "<i>How</i> did I fail to satisfy you?&mdash;I! I who
would have given the skin off my bones to serve you."</p>

<p>Explanation was useless: it would also have been no easy matter
so much as to hint at the spring-like sensations that had got into
his blood. Annemarie was a woman; such feelings were a closed book
to her. Repentant, galled, humiliated, he could only reiterate:
"There shall be no change&mdash;no difference. It will be the
business of our lives to make you happy."</p>

<p>But his use of the plural cut Annemarie to the heart. It also
stiffened her determination not to yield her place. For she was of
those who can suffer on behalf of another only so long as the
object of their devotion remains wholly theirs, their thing, the
ivy to their tree. To endure without reward, or under neglect, was
beyond her.</p>

<p>And of the stuff of which human sacrifices are made, she
essentially was not.</p>

</p>

<p>The bride-elect dutifully repeated her betrothed's assurances,
on that red-letter day when Annemarie so far manned herself as to
tie on her bonnet and pay the visit custom required of her. Arm in
arm brother and sister covered the intervening streets, Annemarie
looking straight before her with unseeing eyes. For, as they
walked, the matchless harmony of their steps brought home to her,
once more, their lifelong unity. Never should interloping stranger
come between!</p>

<p>Before this hardest of tests, Elsa Braun was fluttered and ill
at ease. She reddened to the ears had she to accost the Professor;
deferred meekly, in word and look, to her "dear sister-in-law;"
hung on Annemarie's lips, her own parted in a thin, ingratiating
smile that should beg for favour; and finally, her various little
arts failing of effect, found it as much as she could do to keep
from crying. All of which gave her manner something childishly
unformed.</p>

<p>Annemarie sat stubborn as a stone image on the plush sofa,
responding in dry monosyllables to the amiable efforts of Elsa and
her father. She took but a single sip at her wine glass; left her
aniseed biscuit unbroken. And the ten minutes prescribed by
convention at an end, she pushed wine and biscuit from her, and
rose to her feet. The Professor followed suit with alacrity. He had
sat on thorns, lest anything should be said to wound Annemarie's
sensibility. He was, besides, consumed with curiosity to hear her
opinion of his choice: after having all his life walked by her
judgment, he could not now suddenly dispense with it. And so,
farewell embraces having been exchanged, the rites and formalities
of passage and front-door were rapidly got over, to the grand
relief of all parties. Hardly had the sound of steps on the wooden
stair died away, before Elsa was dissolved in tears. At the same
time, she could not control a spasm of hysterical laughter at the
epithets which her father, who was free of speech, heaped on
Annemarie's head.</p>

<p>Elsa Braun was no longer young; she had passed her
four-and-twentieth year. She was plump, a little too plump now for
an unmarried girl, and tall, with a bright, cherry complexion,
which with the years had grown a shade too marked. Her eyes had
once been of the radiant, glancing kind, which leap to every sally;
and though time had tamed them, they could still twinkle merrily
when she laughed. And laugh she did, readily as a child; for little
things amused her, and the ridiculous was for ever popping up. In
few, she was one of those beings who are intended by nature to
advance joyously through life, to the tune of happiness; and who,
baulked in this, still retain a suppleness, a willowy grace of
movement, to be seen in those slim, fleet, dancing figures on vase
or frieze, in which has been caught and fixed the joy of motion.
Against her, as she went, a many-folded drapery should have
flattened or swayed.</p>

<p>There was a good reason why she had not married, at
marrying-time. Just turned eighteen, she had been indiscreet enough
openly to betray her feelings for a handsome young lieutenant. His
mess-room comments on her behaviour having got abroad, a buzz of
scandal ensued; and, for long after, Elsa had been asked nowhere.
Now, however, the tale of her indiscretion was of such old date as
to be a mere legend, and, assuredly, it had not reached the
Professor's ears. She lived alone with her father, who was retired
from business&mdash;a genial, red-faced, white-haired man, fond of
good living, of a racy story, and not at all displeased to be
widowed of his spouse, who had been thin and a grumbler.</p>

<p>So jubilant was he, over Elsa's late-found good fortune, that
the marriage settlements fell out better than the Professor had
dared to hope.</p>

<p>"Dear son-in-law, you have made me a proud and happy man!"</p>

<p>The bridal stock of household linen was large enough to satisfy
even Annemarie: Elsa had stitched at it since her earliest
school-days, tatting and crotcheting the laces that trimmed it,
drawing threads and embroidering monograms, her lips growing yearly
more pinched at the thought that she might never need it. Now, all
was changed; and she bloomed anew in the weeks that
followed&mdash;uplifting weeks of congratulatory visits, of the
sending of betrothal cards, the exchange of rings. She was not in
love with the Professor, and, with the best will in the world,
could not find him handsome: he was small and thick-set; hair and
beard were of a sandy red; his broad, flat nose had a crest of
little hairs feathering from the tip. But the blue eyes behind the
spectacles were mild and fatherly, and on this benignant gaze,
which was now often bent on her, Elsa set great store. She felt
passionately grateful to him for having singled her out from among
so many; and, when her feelings were drowsiest, would rehearse to
herself the several ways in which she might repay him: they ranged
from airing his house-jacket to tidying his writing-table, and
even, in moments of ecstasy, soared to copying his manuscripts.
Such a firing of her affection was most needful on coming in from
one of the bi-weekly walks which she now took on his arm, under the
chaperonage of Annemarie. Conversation drooped on such excursions;
for Elsa was tongue-tied, Annemarie adamant; while the Professor
had for so long been accustomed to think out the morrow's work as
he walked, that he could not at once break himself of the habit.
And so there often fell a silence between the three. Then, on
reaching home, Elsa would fling her arms round her father's neck
and hug and kiss him.</p>

<p>"There, there, snailkin!" said Herr Braun, and laughed, and
laughed. "Practising on poor old pa, what? Well, well! he must take
what he can get, while he can get it."</p>

<p>To give way to emotion in the presence of her betrothed or his
sister was unthinkable. Manlike, the Professor might have looked
with leniency on her lack of restraint; but the stern eye of
Annemarie would have blighted any fit of girlish expansiveness at
its core. And so it was with everything. In Annemarie's presence,
Elsa never lost the sense of being an unfinished child. Had she to
speak, her words came haltingly; to use her hands, they seemed all
thumbs; while the consciousness of her ignorance, her shallowness,
her utter incapacity, in short, was magnified tenfold. Humbly she
consulted Annemarie at every turn; and, what was more, took the
advice given&mdash;even in matters of dress. And this called for
considerable self-denial, her own tastes leaning to the airy and
bright, not to say gaudy; while Annemarie poured scorn on
flimsiness and colour, and looked only to the number of years a
stuff would wear. Elsa also sat meekly by while, with practised
hands, Annemarie disposed on the Professor's shelves the lavendered
dozens of sheets and cloths into which she, Elsa, had sewn so many
hopes. She would, too, dearly have liked a say in the arrangement
of the handsome furniture she brought with her, in the rooms that
would also be hers; but a timid hint to the Professor called forth
a mild, yet peremptory: "True, my love. But think of the occupation
it will afford Annemarie during our absence." To which there was
nothing to be said.</p>

<p>Her father was the only one of the party who did not sing
placebo. For him, the tall angular spinster stood for the epitome
of all a woman ought not to be. Blind to her sterling qualities, he
never tired of mimicking her, thereby sadly embarrassing his
daughter, who, having entered the Professor's family, feared to
impinge on her loyalty did she so much as smile at her father's
antics. To himself, Herr Braun called Annemarie "a dry-nurse...an
old he-goat," and wished an apoplexy might carry her off soon after
the wedding ceremony. All said and done though, she formed but a
trifling drawback to the match. At heart, the old man was as proud
as Punch at Elsa's rise in life; and, in frequenting his Ninepin
Club, played fast and loose with the phrase: "My son-in-law, the
Professor." Another thing: he no longer needed to worry his poor
old head over what was to become of Elsa when he was gone. And he
grew rounder and ruddier than before.</p>

<p>And society was in league with him, helping to forge the coming
fetters with a unanimity that smacked of malice. Annemarie's raven
prophecy was not fulfilled: no one rose up to find that the
Professor, by reason of his years, and his ancient bachelordom, cut
a sorry figure. On the contrary, he was greeted on every hand like
an overdue vessel that at long last makes harbour.</p>

<p>Met in Aula or Vestibule, those of his colleagues who already
wore the yoke wrung his hand with a new warmth; on their lips the
set patter of congratulation stood for his entry into a mystic
brotherhood. The unmarried were also well content with him; did not
his example light them along a road they were only too pressed to
follow?</p>

<p>But if the men looked more than they said, their women-folk made
up for this restraint. They buzzed and hummed round Elsa, a very
Greek chorus of approbation. Her decision was applauded to the
echo. Especially by the matrons. These deep-bosomed, wide-hipped
women of forty-odd were never weary of stressing the advantages
that would accrue to her from the match. Position and title came
first in order. After which, they sang the praises of her
betrothed's steady-going habits; and, in this connection, hinted at
dark dangers, the shoals and currents of the married state, which
she might count herself fortunate in escaping. Out of the depths of
their experience, they fished up dire tales of previous
attachments, of early entanglements, errant fancies&mdash;on the
part of these light-o'-loves, men&mdash;and though it was no more
than an infidelity of the eye. Ah, yes, she was a thrice lucky
girl.&mdash;They even made the best of Annemarie. What a prop, said
they, for a young wife to have at her side. What a mine of wisdom
to draw on, till she should be thoroughly schooled in all her
husband's wants, ways and wishes. Thus led, she, in her ignorance,
would run small risk of failing to please.</p>

<p>Wives of a briefer standing frankly envied her the title. But,
gossiping over their needlework, one and all agreed they would
choose to have no old maid interfering in <i>their</i> homes. As
for the shoals and shallows Elsa was to avoid, did not these give
the relish to marriage of mustard to meat? A husband with no little
excesses to make up for&mdash;a flirtation, a beer-journey, an
over-long seance at the skat-table&mdash;would, thought his wife,
prove but a dull and stingy partner; while the cream of wifehood,
that of comparing notes over the coffee-table, would be lost. In
short, none was exactly averse, at heart, to having a mild Lothario
for spouse.</p>

<p>The young girls of the circle made game, among themselves, of
the Professor's appearance&mdash;though, like Elsa, any of them
would have learned to overlook this, had his choice fallen upon
her&mdash;and went on nursing their secret girlish passions for
shapely lieutenants. However, they accepted Elsa's invitations to
coffee, and, in viewing and discussing the trousseau, ate enormous
quantities of cakes, pastry, and whipped cream; and Elsa, who had
begun to stand uncomfortably alone, too old for the unmarried, yet
shut out by her spinsterhood from the society of matrons, was again
re-admitted to the fold.</p>

<p>Thus, Annemarie alone stood for revolution, for a violent break
with tradition.</p>

<p>And the engagement was as short as decency permitted, there
being nothing to wait for, and the Professor falling every day more
deeply in love. The wedding&mdash;a very quiet affair&mdash;took
place early one morning in September. The Professor's hands and
feet were ice-cold, both at the civil marriage and afterwards in
the church. Elsa did not know whether to laugh or to cry, and did a
little of each. But Annemarie was neither nervous nor in doubt of
her feelings; and face and air, as she stood gauntly erect in her
brown silk dress, would better have befitted a funeral.</p>

<p><b>III.</b>
</p>

<p>The Professor could not take his eyes off Elsa as they stood on
the railway-platform, waiting for the train in to bear them south:
Elsa, in a drab-coloured dust-coat, a grey hat with a brown
gossamer veil flying from it, and yellow boots; with a little
travelling-bag slung across her shoulders, and carrying a band-box
and a brown-holland hold-all, on which, in red cotton, with many a
flourish, was embroidered: "A pleasant journey!" The charming sight
so worked on the Professor that, disregarding her protests, he
gallantly relieved her of the band-box; and, alone with her in a
compartment of the train, shut the door leading to the corridor,
sat down beside her, and took her hand in his. "My sweet little
wife!"</p>

<p>The honeymoon was planned to last six weeks; but a bare four had
elapsed when the postman delivered a letter announcing the pair's
return; and a couple of evenings later Annemarie stood waiting at
the front door, which was green-begarlanded, and topped by a large
"Welcome!" Then the travellers appeared from the dark well of the
staircase, Marthe toiling up with the baggage in their rear. The
Professor was in high feather at getting home; he rubbed his hands,
cracked jokes, and, as soon as Elsa had removed hat and mantle,
offered her his arm for a tour of inspection. They went from room
to room, while the Professor appraised the new wallpapers, the
placing of the new furniture, the rows on rows of shining crockery
and skyblue saucepans that decorated the kitchen shelves; winding
up with the study, where accumulated letters and papers so
engrossed him that, forgetting the ladies, he took root there, and
had to be rung to supper.</p>

<p>At table, his satisfaction with the world continued.</p>

<p>"All said and done, my loves, there is no place like home," he
declared, the while he helped himself to sausage and the little
golden potato-balls that accompanied it. "Home, home, sweet home!
Annemarie, my felicitations! We have not tasted so delicately
prepared a potato since our departure."</p>

<p>"I knew before you went, Paulchen, that foreign travel would not
agree with you," was Annemarie's retort as she diluted the tea.</p>

<p>"True, Annemarie, true! Still, it is a well-known fact that to
see other countries than one's own enlarges the mind. But now, my
dears, I must leave you," said the Professor, and therewith untied
his table-napkin, which he had worn knotted round his neck after
the fashion of a child's bib. "So vast a quantity of work awaits me
that it will take many a long day to make up for lost time. Well,
well, we know who is to blame for that!" And leaning over, he
mischievously tweaked his wife's ear.</p>

<p>Finding Annemarie's eye on him, however, he abruptly desisted.
"I hope we are not to have any nonsense of that kind here!" it
seemed to say. Aloud, Annemarie remarked dryly:'I think, Paulchen,
you are not aware that you are still wearing your best coat."</p>

<p>"Dear me, so I am," ejaculated the Professor, and made this an
excuse to hurry from the room.</p>

<p>Elsa had sat silent, with far-away eyes; she jumped when spoken
to, then smiled, in a hasty, apologetic kind of way. The journey
had greatly fatigued her; and as soon as she had unpacked her trunk
she went to bed. When, towards midnight, the Professor tore himself
from his desk and tiptoed into the bedroom, she lay rosy and
relaxed, fast asleep. And as he moved warily to and fro, shaking
out and folding up his coat, and hanging up his socks to air, his
heart warmed, as on the first day, towards this gracious creature
who had come to adorn his home.</p>

<p>The following morning Elsa paid a visit to her father; and,
sitting on the old man's knee, enlarged on her travels as she had
not yet had a chance of doing: in face of the Professor's measured
sentences, she had shrunk from stuttering out her delight; and her
letters had been of a pathetic poverty of expression. Now, with
neither pen nor husband to disconcert her, she gave full play to
her enthusiasm; and Herr Braun listened with admirable patience,
considering this kind of thing was not at all in his line. At
length, however, he cut her raptures short with a hearty kiss, and
set her down; for she was heavy, and made his old bones ache.</p>

<p>"Little Frau Professor!" said he, and patted her cheek; the
while he indulged anew the comfortable reflection that the
responsibility for her welfare now lay on some one else's
shoulders.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The first duty of the newly-wed was to pay a series of formal
calls on the Professor's colleagues; Annemarie drew up a list in
order of precedence. And thereafter, for many a week to come,
between twelve and one of a Sunday morning, Elsa in her best dress,
the Professor in voluminous frock-coat and curly-brimmed silk hat,
hurried from house to house, and up and down stairs of varying
quality: from shallow flights, richly carpeted, to steep and bare
stone steps. Over the breakfast-table frank calculations were made
how many visits could, with decency, be got through in a morning.
Elsa and he became virtuosi in the art of greeting their hosts,
sustaining an animated conversation for the fewest possible
moments, and then adroitly taking their leave, bringing it up,
despite distances, to the incredible figure of six visits per hour.
From so business-like a proceeding little pleasure was to be got.
And before many Sundays were over, Elsa had no feeling for anything
but the scandalous fleetness with which quarters-of-an-hour escaped
them.</p>

<p>"Tch, tch, tch!" the Professor would mutter, consulting his
watch as they padded down a stair. "We stayed there five minutes
too long. I <i>must</i> beg of you, Elsa, not to forget yourself in
conversation. At this rate, we shall hardly reach the Spiegelbergs'
before they go to table."</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, the callers were kept waiting, sat listening to
the seconds ticking by, while the lady of the house, busy in her
kitchen with the boiling of her Sunday roast, or the basting of a
vinegared hare, scrambled into her Sunday silk; so that when she
did appear, scarlet and soap-glazed, they had either to offer their
adieux with her apologies hardly cold on the air, or to break into
the quarter allotted to the recipient next on their list. And
setbacks of this kind grew commoner as they sank in the scale,
descending from the Ordinaries to the Extraordinaries and
<i>Privatdozents</i>.</p>

<p>Then came the return visits, when Elsa ceremoniously led each
lady to the sofa; and the Professor, at the first tinkle of the
door-bell exchanging his working-jacket for the black coat that
hung in readiness behind the study-door, emerged to give voice to
his pleasure and surprise. The receiving of calls did not make so
criminal an incursion on his time as the paying of them. All the
same, Elsa breathed more freely as the whole business drew to a
close, and ceased to provide the main topic of the dinner-table, in
the shape of endless grumbles from her husband, and comments of
the: "I knew it! I told you so!" order from Annemarie.</p>

<p>However, finally the day came when the last pair of callers
pressed the springs of the furniture; and therewith the long
formality was over. It constituted the sole concession the
Professor was willed to make to the claims of society. Before
marriage he had laid before Elsa, in detail, the manner of life she
would be expected to lead at his side&mdash;just as one instructs
the incoming domestic in his or her particular duties&mdash;and
Elsa had agreed and been content. So that now there was nothing in
the way of them taking up their regular routine.</p>

<p>Punctually at half-past six of a morning, a match was applied to
the wood-fire laid overnight in the stove of the Professor's
dressing-room. Breakfast was at half-past seven: by eight o'clock,
all trace of the meal had been cleared away. At this hour, the
Professor, carrying his newspaper under his arm&mdash;for he liked
to be first of his household to learn what had happened in the
world&mdash;but not unfolding it, for fear of distracting his mind:
at eight o'clock, the Professor withdrew to his study and was seen
no more till midday. Elsa watered the flowers, did a few light jobs
about the house, and answered the door-bell while Annemarie and
Marthe were at market. Did they return, she herself went out to
walk, or to do a little shopping, or to visit her father. After
dinner, which was served on the stroke of half-past twelve, the
Professor read his newspaper, informed his ladies of any news he
thought would interest them, and took a nap; during which not a pin
might fall. Annemarie, letting her knitting sink to her lap, nodded
in unison; and Elsa, her hands condemned to idleness, sat looking
at the two of them across her embroidery-frame. On those afternoons
when the Professor was on duty, she walked down the street with him
to the University, and met him again when the lecture was over. On
other days, he continued his habit of walking alone. After supper,
before retiring to his desk for the evening, he would read aloud to
them&mdash;preferably a French or an English book, for the sake of
the language&mdash;and this was the pleasantest hour of the
day.</p>

<p>Their programme never varied; was repeated week after week,
month after month, till it began to seem to Elsa that the three of
them were mere clockwork figures, wound up to perform a series of
mechanical actions. With words that fitted these, and appropriate
doll-like gestures.</p>

<p>She had no enterprise; and consequently never succeeded in
getting even a tithe of the housekeeping into her own hands. The
earliest arrangement, which was that of Annemarie continuing to
hold the keys while she gradually initiated Elsa into the
Professor's ways, remained the abiding one, except that, after a
very short time, the initiation ceased. The fond girlish dreams of
ministering to her husband's comfort, which she had nursed before
marriage, came to nothing; he did not care for her cooking, or her
schemes for variety: he was dyspeptic, and kept a rigid dietary,
his stomach warming only to Annemarie's familiar dishes. And so it
was with everything. If she aired his slippers or his house-jacket
for him, she saw, in spite of his attempt to look pleased, that he
was vexed not to find them in their accustomed places. For, at
heart, the Professor abhorred change&mdash;he called it
disorder&mdash;and, after one forcible-feeble effort to escape from
his crusted shell, he sank back into it with what was almost a sigh
of thanksgiving. For he, too, made a discovery in these early
months; and that was, that he prized above all else the peace and
tranquillity necessary to mental production. And fortune was on his
side. Elsa gave no trouble; put up no fight for self-assertion. On
the contrary, so faithfully did she obliterate herself that, his
first ardours over, the Professor began to take her presence in his
house as a matter of course, and, lost in the deeps of the Oscan
Declension, to forget all about her.</p>

<p>For company she was thrown wholly on Annemarie. From the first,
her own friends were not very welcome guests here: they ate too
many cakes and sweets to suit Annemarie's purse; brought too loud a
buzz of chat and laughter into the ordered stillness. Besides, they
could only be comfortably entertained during the Professor's brief
absences. No sooner was his key heard in the lock than Elsa fell
into a nervous twitter, and could think only of politely getting
rid of them. Otherwise, supper would be one long jeremiad. Nor was
it any better with the regulation coffee-parties given by the wives
of other Professors. Did she, Elsa, attend these, it meant
entertaining in return&mdash;and still worse grumbles. She soon
learnt her lesson, and became an adept at excusing herself.</p>

<p>It was Annemarie or no one. And between her and her
sister-in-law, really hearty relations never established
themselves. The two just rubbed along. Oddly enough, when it came
to the point, Elsa's very submissiveness and anxiety to please
formed the chief stumbling-block to their intimacy. For all her
martinet airs, Annemarie would have preferred to see her brother's
wife showing more spirit; venturing here and there to stand up for
her rights. As Elsa, however, only waxed more and more listless,
she despised her for her want of backbone as roundly as, at bottom,
she would have resented any show of independence.</p>

<p>Without even ordinary domestic tasks to fill them, Elsa's days
grew ever longer and drearier. She had already spent a third of her
life at her needle; and every bit of her was a-scream for a little
harmless variety&mdash;the variety she had fondly expected marriage
would bring her. Whereas life in the Professor's house was whittled
down to a monotony, a dead level of dullness, that passed belief.
She had known dull enough days at home, and the disgrace of a
prolonged spinsterhood had begun to weigh heavy on her. But life
there had had a bright side. Her father had always been ready to
crack his jokes; and had liked nothing better than to hear her
laugh and see her merry. Nor had things ever needed to be up to
time&mdash;time, whose bondslave she now was&mdash;but had gone as
they listed, in a haphazard, chancy kind of way. There had also
been an abundance of talk, and gossip, and loving raillery. Here,
the primness, the soulless exactitude, the undeviating punctuality
she was called on to exercise ground her down; and before a year
was out the Professor seemed to her a mere dry little pedant,
without a single human stirring under his hard-baked surface. As
for Annemarie&mdash;well, enough to say, Elsa never dared to carry
out even the one little breach of discipline she was always
contemplating: that of some day coming in late for a meal. Before
Annemarie, she stood the eternal schoolgirl in face of her
mistress. And the heckling and pruning she had to submit to lent
body to this feeling. She knew she was untidy, and gave herself all
pains to cure the fault; but it went beyond her; for she simply did
not know what Annemarie would call untidy next. If a curl caught by
the wind strayed on to her forehead; if a string slipped and her
petticoat showed beneath her skirt...oh, it did not matter
what...she was hauled up as for a crime. She could not open a book
unrebuked: they must always be commenting on what she read.
Annemarie disapproved of poetry; the Professor was sarcastic over
the light literature which, before marriage, had been her chief
fare. Music disturbed him; she might not play the piano save in his
short absences; she might not run, or sing, or even laugh too
loudly. And the fine inborn gaiety of her nature declined from day
to day.</p>

<p>She grew uncertain in temper: sulked, would not speak when
spoken to. Annemarie put up with this for some time, then
complained to her brother, and the Professor, grieved and
surprised, laid down his pen to point out the selfishness of giving
way to moods and whimsies. Elsa burst out crying, and locked
herself in the bedroom. Altogether, at this time, she cried easily:
sometimes of a morning, as she walked along the banks of the canal,
where barges swam and women washed linen, she could hardly see to
put one foot in front of the other, for the sudden mist of tears
that blurred her eyes. "Why did he marry me? Oh, why did he marry
me?" And the thoughts that darted through her brain in answer were
dark and unwifely.</p>

<p>But the day came when she ceased to question; when doubts and
frets were swallowed up in a vast satisfaction; and the Professor,
as father of the child that was to be, took on a new significance
in her eyes. She had been unjust to him, she saw it now: he was as
pleased at the prospect as she herself&mdash;if in a sedater way.
For now she had to sing: there was no keeping back the tunes that
rose to her lips. At last, too, she had found an occupation: with
Annemarie's help she cut out and stitched the many little garments
needed; and over this work she glimpsed unsuspected qualities in
even her stern old sister-in-law.</p>

<p>But both were kind to her now; being both highly satisfied with
the turn events had taken. Thought the Professor: it was the duty
of every woman to bear children; they were as exactly the
complement of her existence as work was of a man's; and would put
an end to all dumps and doldrums. Annemarie's reflections were of
the same nature&mdash;with a fine shade of difference. It was, of
course, proper that her brother's union should be blessed with
offspring; a family would, in her eyes, form its only
justification. Otherwise, she was tempted to wonder what had been
the object of bringing this weak, moping, untidy girl into their
well-regulated home. Poor dear Paulchen!...unless at his desk,
delving roots and their derivatives, he was as blind as a bat; and
quite unversed in the difficult task of appraising women. Man-like,
he had let himself be captivated by an agreeable exterior. What a
different choice she would have made for him! However, much would
now be forgiven Elsa if she did her part in a sensible and healthy
manner; by no flightiness or carelessness endangering the precious
young life that had been given into her keeping. For, towards the
unborn child, her brother's child, Annemarie's heart was already
tender.</p>

<p>All the same, she would not have been a woman if she had not
felt a slight malicious satisfaction. She did not begrudge Paulchen
his pride at becoming a father; but he had, she knew, as little
idea what it cost to bring a human being into the world, as the
unconscious arrival itself. Now, if a man would persist in
marrying, he must face the music; and she saw no reason why
Paulchen should have the experience softened for him. So she
impressed on him the necessity of making Elsa's welfare and Elsa's
wishes&mdash;no matter how strained and far-fetched these
seemed&mdash;the hub round which all else turned. And for the first
time in his life, the Professor found himself a person of secondary
importance.</p>

<p>Elsa held first place. And it did not offend her that this new
dignity was only, as it were, a kind of reflection cast by the
coming child. She had never had any morbid, modern sense of her own
individuality; had never, in fact, been conscious of it at all; and
she was, besides, already much more engrossed with the new arrival
than either of the others could be. In addition, she had two
thoughts for company which uplifted her far above petty
considerations. She said to herself: this little one that is coming
will be all mine, belong to me alone; for, young-motherlike, she
forgot in her way, just as Annemarie in hers, that two go to the
parenting of a child. Again, when she felt most crushed by her
sister-in-law's superior airs, she would remind herself: soon, now,
there will be something about which I shall know more than she
does. Which was a prop to sustain her.</p>

<p>She enjoyed, with her whole heart, the regime of
do-as-you-please idleness, to which by doctor's orders she was now
condemned: she might get up late in the morning, stay at home if
she did not feel moved to go out, spend several hours of each day
on the sofa. Her father came to see her every afternoon. The fat,
rubicund little man would tiptoe into the room, finger on lip, half
in order to amuse Elsa, half from a very genuine fear of disturbing
or calling forth his learned son-in-law, with whom he found it
impossible to fraternise. And Elsa never failed to laugh at the
threadbare joke, and pulled the joker down by his long, white
beard, to kiss him. He brought her sweets, which were not allowed
her; and the light and foolish novels she loved. And though these
might now have passed unscathed, she kept them tucked away under
the sewing in her work-basket.</p>

<p>Father and daughter shared a secret; and when, in their hearing,
Annemarie, whose say neither dared dispute, magisterially wished
the expected infant to be a boy, Elsa would look slily across at
her father, and lift her embroidery to her lips to hide the smile
that played there. For her part, she hoped otherwise. In a boy the
other two would claim too large a share; while a mere girl she
could have for her very own.</p>

<p>Now, the baking heat of summer was upon them; and Elsa seldom
left the house. Never a day passed, however, but what Herr Braun
toiled up the steep stairs to visit her. He panted more loudly each
time; his face was red as a boiled lobster; and so stout had he
grown that his beard stood out from his chest at right angles. The
doctor was uneasy, he said, because he did not transpire properly;
but he snapped his fingers at such a trifle.</p>

<p>Annemarie eyed his retreating figure with disapproval. "Your
father is letting himself go," she said severely: he had puffed
into the room that afternoon like a veritable grampus. Annemarie
could feel no respect for Herr Braun, because of the many
shortcomings of Elsa's up-bringing.</p>

<p>"But so long as he is happy?" gave back Elsa lightly, without
thinking what she said&mdash;as she often dared nowadays to
answer.</p>

<p>"Happy? Pray, what has that to do with it? You talk as if
happiness was the sole aim of existence!" snorted Annemarie, out of
patience with such soft, indulgent notions.</p>

<p>Elsa flushed an apology. She had never seriously reflected on
life or life's meaning. Now, in face of Annemarie's sterner
standards, the laxity of her ideas came painfully home to her.</p>

<p>Weeks passed, and all was going well, when one day Herr Braun
dropped dead in the street of an apoplexy. A foolish servant
carried the news hotfoot, and the grief to which Elsa yielded was
so immoderate that days of acutest anxiety followed. By doctor's
orders she was put to bed in a darkened room, and kept there; was
forbidden to move hand or foot, Annemarie sitting over her to
enforce obedience. And by the time the danger was over, and she
permitted to rise, Herr Braun lay, stiff-stretched and decorous,
under his new mound of earth, and would never be seen by mortal
eyes again.</p>

<p>Looking very wan in her new black dress, Elsa sat and moped and
fretted. The doctor recommended a thorough change of scene; and as
July was now well advanced, it was arranged that she and Annemarie
should set out forthwith for a watering-place in the mountains.
There, when the academic term ended, the Professor would join
them.</p>

<p>In their absence he was left to the mercy of the servant&mdash;a
thing that had not happened to him within living memory&mdash;and
he tasted all the many, petty discomforts of bachelorhood. His
meals were unpunctually served, indifferently cooked; and he, who
had never wanted for anything, might now tinkle his hand-bell or
raise his voice in vain. Marthe was never where she should be:
escaped from the unwinking control of Annemarie, she did what she
chose, went where she listed. Once, late in the evening when he
believed her to be in bed, the Professor came upon her at the
house-door, gallivanting with a soldier; and once, he was sure of
it, he heard not two but four feet ascending to the servants'
quarters at the top of the house. Listening on the landing in his
night-clothes, he could have sworn to apprehending a male snore. He
did not, however, dare to tackle Marthe outright; she took even a
mild reproof for dawdling, in saucy fashion. He was afraid of her,
and the traps he laid for her were underhand traps; but, try as he
would, he could not catch her. The chase assumed a morbid interest
for him; and the composure necessary to scientific literary
production went to pieces over it.</p>

<p>When, however, he joined his ladies, he found so marked an
improvement in Elsa that he forgave and forgot his tribulations as
a housekeeper. Her bloom took him back to the early days of his
courtship, and made him feel wondrous kind.</p>

<p>He playfully pulled her ear. "My pretty little wife once
more!"</p>

<p>The three of them, Elsa leaning on his arm, promenaded the flat,
pleasant roads, shaded by fruit-trees; and, now, brother and sister
suited their steps to hers. When the band played they drank coffee
in the <i>Kurpark</i>, while Annemarie knitted and the Professor
read; and Elsa, who had never been much from home, found occupation
enough in watching the crowd of summer visitors. If they went
farther afield, she rode in a bath-chair, which was pushed by an
old, one-eyed man.</p>

<p>Thus the summer passed.</p>

<p><b>IV.</b>
</p>

<p>On their return&mdash;it was the end of September, and the
evenings were beginning to strike chill&mdash;returning, Annemarie
found dirt and disorder everywhere, and plunged them into a belated
house-cleaning. Even the Professor saw the need of this; but, none
the less, it was a time of forlorn discomfort. He had never before
been present at a thorough-paced cleaning; and mournfully he picked
his steps over the dust and shavings of scraped parquet, or
avoided, with a sigh that was deep enough for an oath, pails of
steaming, strong-smelling water. The whacking of beds and
furniture, the scraping of floors, trampling feet and loud voices
murdered thought; and only his confidence in Annemarie's sound
judgment sustained him. He had had a further proof of her acumen:
her hawk eye had at once detected Marthe's backsliding; and, the
house in order again, you could hardly say Jack Robinson before the
miscreant's box was packed, and a new brawny-armed maidservant
dumped down the soup-tureen. Yes, some women were born to
generalship. Had it been Elsa now...Elsa?...<i>some</i> women, he
said.</p>

<p>After the many sacrifices they had made on her behalf, Elsa was
behaving poorly again. Pressed, she declared that the sight of the
house brought her loss back to her anew: it was here she had seen
her father last&mdash;now who would have thought she had so doted
on him? Annemarie did not mince her words; the Professor reasoned
and expostulated. As, however, nothing they could say took effect,
and she was twice found in tears, they called in the doctor.</p>

<p>"Try cheerful society," said he. "Your wife is too much
alone."</p>

<p>But out of Elsa's hearing he was more explicit, and even hinted
darkly at a constitutional weakness. Upon which, the eyes of
brother and sister met in a wordless flash. What!...this, too? In
trying to pick up the scattered threads of his work, the Professor
was mastered by a very human irritation: had he been the dupe of a
mere surface rosiness and plumpness? While Annemarie's big-boned
hands trembled, as she dished up potatoes in their jackets for
dinner. Was the last stroke to be put to Elsa's wish-washy
shallowness by her inability to bear a healthy child?</p>

<p>Well! they would do their duty, no matter at what cost. Grimly
Annemarie issued invitations for a coffee-party; the Professor as
grimly retired, with an armful of books, to the seclusion of a
sunless attic; and a round dozen of ladies, armed with work-bags
and satchels, arrived to sit in circle about the wax-cloth of the
dinner-table. But, cakes and coffee disposed of, the infant
trousseau duly examined and admired, an air of flatness settled on
the party. Elsa, who should have been its life, sat vacant and
aloof, taking no share in the gossipy talk. Thus the entertainment
planned to distract her proved a failure; and the Professor resumed
possession of his study with a sigh of relief, and the clearest of
husbandly consciences.</p>

<p>Had it only ended here! This, however, was but the first of a
series of derangements and discomforts, the like of which he could
never have believed possible. His home was no longer his own; his
day's routine was broken into, he himself pushed to one side, the
last person in the house to be considered. Or initiated. Annemarie
went about ropt in mystery and importance; the very maidservant was
more in the swim than he. He seemed merely in the way: a tripper
over unlooked-for baskets and cradles; an unwilling trespasser on
private conversations, which, at his entry, crashed into
silence.</p>

<p>There was, for example, that unfortunate afternoon when, going
to the bedroom to wash his hands, he found that he had blundered in
on a confabulation with the midwife, come to pay her visit of
ceremony: a burly, big-bosomed female, of a type hitherto unknown
to him, her top crowned by a vast, flower-laden hat. She sat with
her knees apart, a pudgy hand on each, and turned, at the opening
of the door, to fix the intruder with two beady, inquisitive little
eyes.</p>

<p>"<i>Aha! Der Herr Papa</i>!"</p>

<p>The Professor fled.</p>

<p>Again, the whole thing could not have happened, for him, at a
more inconvenient time. He was just prepared to issue, in pamphlet
form, a further slice of his life-work&mdash;the second in ten
years&mdash;and for this momentous undertaking he needed not only
the utmost tranquillity of mind, but the peace of the grave about
him. The deliberatings, the weighings of the fors and againsts,
that preceded his decision to publish, were a labour in themselves.
For the Professor suffered from so deep-seated a lack of
self-confidence that it amounted almost to mental paralysis;
causing him to sift and re-sift his findings till scarcely anything
of them remained. He had also to look to it that, whilst whetting
the appetite of his brother-philologists, he did not make them all
too free of his main issue: that master theory of the "Oscan
Declension," which was some day to settle the vexed question for
good and all. Yes! a thousand subtle doubts and inhibitions had to
be battled with and overthrown, ere the fruits of his learning
could come to birth.</p>

<p>Now, however, all preliminaries were behind him; and, as he
walked home one late November afternoon, under an avenue of maples
still richly hung with rosy-yellow leaves, he, too, felt as if
bathed in a sunset glow. On his desk the first proofs of his
booklet lay awaiting him. They had come by the morning post, but he
had resisted even stealing a peep at them, till his work in the
lecture-room was over. Proofs! Most seductive form of printed
matter! In fancy the Professor tasted the good things that lay
before him. First, he would drink a cup of tea, savouring to the
full the fine flavour of Annemarie's brew. Then, going into his
study and shutting the door on the world, he would change his coat,
seat himself at his desk, and let the galley-slips unroll: as it
were to see himself, see the very essence of him materialise, in
the black and white of the printed page. Oh! life held no purer joy
than this. Afterwards came the exquisite pleasure of correction.
Not the smallest inaccuracy escaped his eye; never yet had
malicious printer got the better of him! And, had a note to be
made, it trickled scroll-like, microscopic, a decoration in itself,
a-down the clean, white margin of the page.</p>

<p>Of things such as these did the Professor dream, hastening
towards them as another to the arms of his lover.</p>

<p>But they were fated to remain a dream. For, on entering the
house, he found himself in a scene of wild confusion. Elsa's hour
had come, and Annemarie and Mathilde were scuttling about, banking
up the stoves, disarranging the furniture, rearranging the beds.
Not even the kettle had been put on for his tea; and, dry-throated
and unrefreshed, he had to sally forth again to fetch doctor and
midwife.</p>

<p>For three nights he did not take his clothes off. His meals were
cold scraps, served at odd times; his bed remained unmade, his
boots uncleaned. When, at dawn on the third day, the surgeon's
forceps brought a puny infant into the world, and Elsa's cries
ceased, the Professor himself felt on the verge of collapse. The
strain on his nerves had been too great. He had also discovered in
himself an unsuspected tender-heartedness. Again and again, in
waiting, in listening, his eyes had filled and overflowed. None the
less, deep down in him, there housed a bitter resentment. Other
women bore children without this merciless ado. Why not his wife?
Why must all this happen just to him, who, loved peace and
tranquillity more than anything?...yes, verily, above
<i>anything</i> on earth.</p>

<p>Now, however, a divine quiet restored, he manned himself, and
went bravely through with his day's work. But he returned towards
evening feeling more dead than alive; and there being no change in
the sickroom, where Elsa lay in a heavy sleep, he retired to his
shakedown, losing consciousness as his head touched the pillow.</p>

<p>He seemed hardly to have closed his eyes when he found himself
sitting up in bed, trembling violently. What was it?...what had
happened? He listened into the darkness, straining his ears.
Nothing...nothing...and he was just on the point of sinking back
into a heavenly oblivion, when a shrill scream jerked him up again
and brought the sweat out on his forehead. So that was
it!...Elsa!&mdash;God in Heaven! she was beginning anew.</p>

<p>His first feeling was one of utter rebellion. Impossible!...he
could not, no, he could not...every nerve in his body rose in arms
at the prospect of being racked afresh. Between the second and the
third cry, there was almost time to fall asleep again. The fourth
roused him to a mood of murderous fury, as, utterly without shame,
it shrilled through the house.</p>

<p>Now some one was battering at his door.</p>

<p>"Paulchen!&mdash;get up, get up! The doctor! Something terrible
has happened." It was Annemarie's voice, choked,
unrecognisable.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! I'm coming."</p>

<p>Throwing back the feather coverlet, he dropped his legs over the
side of the bed and groped on the floor for his socks. And so dizzy
with sleep was he that for some seconds it did not occur to him to
light the candle. Again and again his lids fell to; and the effort
of putting on each single piece of clothing was enormous. But one
breath of the cold night air roused him.</p>

<p>This was at midnight; and so it went on till dawn, when Elsa
died without regaining consciousness.</p>

<p>For a fortnight after, the wailing of a sick child made the days
and nights a torture. Then, despite their care, the babe, too,
died; and he and Annemarie drove a second time to the cemetery, a
miniature coffin before them on the seat of the <i>Droschke</i>.
When they reached home, black as crows in their stiff, heavy
mourning, the house itself, sepulchrally dark, sepulchrally silent,
felt like a tomb. Annemarie went round drawing up the shutters.
Mathilde was bidden to prepare the tea.</p>

<p>While this was being done, the Professor retired to his study.
As he went, he drew a black-edged handkerchief from his
tail-pocket, and, for the dozenth time, blew his nose and wiped his
eyes. He was still deeply moved; it would be many a day before his
heart healed of its wounds. To lose wife and child thus, at one
stroke...the mere thought of his widowed state so touched him that
it was again necessary to fumble for his handkerchief.</p>

<p>This time, however, he did not find it&mdash;neither it nor the
pocket that hid it. For, following the habit of a lifetime, on
entering his room he had automatically exchanged his tail-coat for
the familiar grey working-jacket that hung behind the door. So he
had now to content himself with sniffing. For at the selfsame
moment he espied a bundle of letters lying on his desk. Not one had
yet been replied to. Crossing to the table he sat down. And then it
was, in handling the letters, that the forgotten proofs caught his
eye. They lay just as on the day Elsa was taken ill, virgin-pure of
ink-mark or correction. Putting out his hand, he drew them to him.
He read a sentence; he skimmed a paragraph. Whereafter, as always
for reading, he removed his spectacles and peered at the print with
a naked eye. A magic stillness reigned. He read on. Suddenly to
give vent to a click of the tongue. A wrong fount had been used.
And again: a ridiculous misspelling! Tch! the carelessness of
printers. Mechanically he reached for his pen.</p>

<p>When, a little later, Annemarie opened the door by a
hand's-breadth to peep in, he was too engrossed to hear her.
Noiselessly she withdrew.</p>

<p>Back in the sitting-room, she, too, looked about her for an
occupation. Her work-basket stood in a corner; taking from it a
half-finished sock, untouched now for weeks, she began to knit. The
table was spread; in a little while she would tinkle the hand-bell
that summoned Paulchen to tea.</p>

<p>Click-click, click-a-click, went the busy pins. And except that
her dress was black and crepe-laden, Annemarie sat as she had sat
for the past twenty years, and as she might be expected from now on
again to sit, day in, day out, waiting for the same meal, at the
same hour, turning the heels and narrowing the toes of Paulchen's
socks. But appearances deceived: for all her seeming placidity, her
brain was a whirl of new, queer thoughts. And soon this inner
commotion grew so strong that hands and pins fell to her lap, and
she sat idle, staring straight before her.</p>

<p>It began with her catching herself listening for an infant's
cry. And when the silence remained unbroken, and she reminded
herself that never again need she hope to hear that thin, fluty
wail, she felt a sudden stab of...of what was almost fear. Yes, let
her confess it, she was afraid: afraid of the stillness, the
vacancy, the deadness that had closed down again upon the house.
And on those in it. For a year past, she had had at her side some
one to parley with, to manage, to whip up. She had also learnt what
it meant to care for a little child. Now, the days to come yawned
empty as untenanted space. What should she do with them?...how
endure the creeping of the hours? For what had once satisfied her
was no longer enough. Never again could she sink back into the
automaton, the figurehead, who existed solely to smooth another's
path, smothering meanwhile every personal wish or want, to receive,
in return, hardly a thank-you for her pains.</p>

<p>Since last she had sat here knitting, knitting, knitting for
Paulchen, hanging on Paulchen's words, awaiting his pleasure, she
had passed through a great, a vital experience. The mysteries of
birth and death had been enacted before her: the coming of a new
soul, the going forth of one with whom you had shared your daily
bread. This was life&mdash;what it really meant to be
alive&mdash;not the humdrum monotony that had always fallen to her
lot, which she had put up with only because she knew no better.
Advantage had been taken of her ignorance. And by whom? By
Paulchen.&mdash;Paulchen? Who was Paulchen that he should demand
such a sacrifice? Was his life of so much more worth than hers? She
turned her eyes on him, and, as she looked, the scales fell, and
she saw him as she had never yet dared to see him; as a mouldy
little book-worm, a narrow blear-eyed little delver in abstruse
symbols, who lived wrapped up in himself, and for himself alone,
without thought or care for the well-being of those around him. As
long as he was ministered to, his comfort assured, nothing else
mattered. Even at this moment, with wife and child barely cold in
the grave, he found it possible to take up his old routine. And no
doubt confidently expected her to do the same. At this thought, the
suppressed, unconscious resentment of years came to the surface in
Annemarie, and she felt that she almost hated him. He and his Oscan
Declension! Was it worth a rap to anybody but himself? Did it do
anyone good?...help the sick and needy?...or those in travail? What
had it ever done for her, but rob her?...of all life might have
held for her as a woman. Had it not been for this fetish, this
Moloch, she, too, might have joined the ranks of happy wives, have
fulfilled her woman's mission, borne children. In a flash she saw
them, these lost children of hers, a whole row of them, rising step
by step from the toddlers up: <i>she</i> would not have died in
giving them birth, not she! And, in their stead, all that had been
offered her was the right to stand by and watch Paulchen work, for
his own honour and glory, at this bloodless abstraction. Oh! her
scorn, her bitterness, knew no bounds. His mole-like absorption;
his inflated self-importance; his pitiable worthlessness as a human
being.&mdash;"Mouldy...mouldy...mouldy...and <i>I</i> am to
moulder, too!"</p>

<p>Mathilde, carrying in tea, nearly dropped the pot at sight of
her mistress sitting stormily weeping, and not even troubling to
hide her face. Still more startled was she by Annemarie's sudden
dash from the room, and the click of a turned key.</p>

<p>"Now who'd ever have thought the old stick had so much feeling
in her!" was the girl's comment, in retailing the juicy incident to
the maid in the flat above.</p>

<p>And the Professor, in place of the peace and serenity he craved,
having knocked till his knuckles were sore and got but an angry
bidding to let her be, had not only for the first time in his life
to pour out his own tea, but to drink it in a solitude peopled by
gloomiest forebodings.</p>

<p>The while, behind her locked door, Annemarie continued to
indulge thoughts and hatch plans of the kind that herald
revolutions.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Succedaneum</h2>

<p><b>I.</b>
</p>

<p>With the brim of his wide-awake turned down, the collar of his
overcoat up to his ears, Jerome Mocs stepped into the street. It
was late afternoon, and the air smelt of coming rain; the sky was
spread with cloud as evenly as with mortar from a trowel. The young
man shot a single glance of distaste round him; then, hunching his
shoulders, made for a narrow street that led to the centre of the
town. He walked listlessly, dragging his feet. Yet rather than
chance brushing up against a passer-by, he went to the trouble of
stepping off the pavement into the road.</p>

<p>In his present mood the very sight of his fellow-men was odious
to him. For he was that most distracted of mortals, the creative
artist whose inspiration has failed him. The rich flow of musical
ideas, the power to bend these rhythmically to his will, to
compress them in the chosen form, everything alike had deserted
him, and as abruptly as once it had descended. He was left hollow
as a clock emptied of its works; left flat, cold, purposeless; a
<i>cui bono</i> in the flesh.&mdash;For, without this power that
was mine a moment back, who am I, what am I? A straw driven before
the wind; a null; a parasite at life's board.&mdash;And, on top of
this, the envy, the murderous envy, of those who were still masters
of their genius. No! envy was not the word: it was at once too much
and too little. What he felt was more like the hurt and
bewilderment of a child who has been shut out, for no conscious
fault, from a lamp-lit festivity, at which all but him make merry.
Sven Arped preached patience...but Sven was old in comparison: his
early fires had burned low. And he, Jerome Mocs, was still so
young. Beard in hand, Arped taught that these blanks, these breaks
in one's continuity, served an end: they obliged the artist to come
to grips with life in the raw, from which he might distil further
sublimates; had, in short, a reproductive value. Sven himself at
such times sought the company of women; found, in women's simple,
unsophisticated minds, a wholesome contrast to the subtleties of
art, to the eternal and damnable preoccupation with colour and
line. And, then, so wild were his extravagances that his name
burned on men's lips. But he, Mocs, had still no use for women as a
surrogate. His attitude to them was one either of contempt or of
exaggerated awe.&mdash;Again, there was Gregor Muthesius, the poet.
Gregor drowned suspense in alcohol, went blind and deaf to his
barrenness, till he could rise once more full of pristine vigour
for his task of beating out a super-reality in words. (But then
Gregor had the physique of a lion-hunter, and could permit himself
the luxury of debauch.) And so it was with all the rest: each had
his peculiar trick of surmounting these breaks in his artistic
being, when impulse died at the spring. He, Jerome Mocs, alone had
not learned wisdom. And this time the loss hit him harder than ever
before. For he had been on the edge of completing what he believed
to be his masterpiece, a free symphonic rhapsody that should carry
his name far beyond the select inner circle&mdash;had not the great
Ricchi himself promised it a hearing? And he had swept forward,
gaily, audaciously, prodigal of his riches, never doubting that
they would last him to the end. Then, the block had come, and he
had risen one morning to find his verve gone, his grip loosened,
his mind dry as a drained keg. Angry, incredulous, he had fought
like one possessed to recapture the flow: in vain. Worse still, he
began to be invaded by doubts, to look critically at his beloved
work; and gradually a feeling of aversion for it grew up in him
that fell not far short of hatred.&mdash;Oh! surely no other
anguish could compare with this?...just as no other human joy
touched the joys of creation: this acme of lightness, this sense of
walking on rainbows, this supreme surrender to a force outside
oneself! Some, he knew, went on doing hodman's work in place of a
creator's; claiming that a skill born of long practice carried you
over the bare patches. But Arped was not one of them, nor yet
Gregor, nor, by God, he, Jerome Mocs! He was still jealous as a
girl of his immaculateness. There was no room for compromise in
him. Rather, and savagely, he descended into hell. And in hell he
remained.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>At moments on this particular afternoon, when he touched bottom,
he threw back his head and swept the sky with a look that resembled
a shaken fist, or a dog's bared teeth. Put into words it would have
run: Oh, You up there!...You, Who have granted us artists but a
single faculty&mdash;that of aping You, of playing the Creator-and
Who then freakishly and thievishly rob us of the power to do
it...</p>

<p>At one such moment his sullen eyes, in falling, met those of a
girl who had paused on the kerb to decipher a scrap of writing. She
had glanced up unthinkingly as he drew near; but she did not look
away again&mdash;he saw to that! It pleased him suddenly to fix her
eyes with his, to pin them fast, paying out his own evil mood in
the look, till his victim reddened and made off. And he did not so
much as turn his head after her, though she had been both young and
winsome.</p>

<p>But the little encounter diverted him, and on the next likely
object he tried the trick anew. And again a woman started, and
shrank, and quickened her pace. The third, on the other hand, held
out his look and paid it back in kind. After this the thing became
a game, a means of killing time; and gradually he fell to classing
the eyes he caught. There were those that met his frankly, and as
frankly fled. Those that fell like smitten doves, only to flutter
up again a second later. Some peeped demurely from behind their
curtain of lash; others&mdash;the few&mdash;pretended to be
outraged, indignant. But there also met him the flattered eyes of
little work-girls, which fawned shyly, or laughed an arch response;
as well as those of riper women, which hung on his with the scantly
veiled allure of a Mona Lisa. Oh, these women's eyes.</p>

<p>Till, all at once, the biter was bit, the fisher tangled in his
own net. Suddenly he found himself gazing into two eyes which
neither fled, nor beckoned, nor repelled; which gave back his look
with the ingenuous freedom of a child's, and yet were very woman's
in their depth and knowledge. He had never seen eyes like them: he
could not tear his away. And so dreamlike was the state he had
fallen into, that it needed a push from a passer-by to wake him to
the fact that they were the eyes of no living person. What he stood
staring at was but the drawing of a woman's face, life-sized, and
traced by a master-hand.&mdash;With a laugh at his own folly he
turned on his heel.</p>

<p>Then, however, curiosity pricked him, and he stooped to see
whose was the face that had duped him. The picture was here used as
an advertisement, other posters surrounded it; but it was now some
days old, and of the lettering that had originally accompanied it,
not a trace remained. So he was none the wiser. Stepping back, with
his head tilted slightly to one side, he took another long look.
Then, since a fine rain had begun to fall, and his game for the day
was spoilt, he went to seek shelter.</p>

<p>But that night, when he fought by means of any trifle to ban the
thought of his impotence, of all the eyes whose secrets he had
filched, these counterfeits alone came back with any clearness.
Again he sank his own in them. And now he saw that they held a
vital spark, a kind of spiritual promise, which none of the living
had possessed: as if the unknown artist had condensed and
compressed in them a sum of human experience. And gradually it
began to seem that their message was aimed specially at him; as if
these eyes were striving to make some wordless revelation to him,
of mysteries in his art, in life, to which he had not yet
attained.&mdash;And this idea grew till it became a certainty.</p>

<p>Next morning, for the first time since the break, he did not sit
with his head between his hands, despairing. His coffee gulped
down, he went out and back on his steps of the day before. Walking
more and more swiftly as he drew near the place where the picture
had stood. For a sudden fear seized him lest it should have
vanished overnight, have been pasted over or torn off. And so it
was. In its stead he now faced the announcement of a <i>bal
pare</i>. Then the hunt began. He scoured the streets, head down
before a biting wind, running from one quarter of the town to
another, gyrating round advertisement columns, without success. Not
till late in the day was his search crowned. Then, once again, the
mysterious eyes met his. And this time, too, beneath the portrait,
he was able to make out the half-torn lettering of a name. Bianca
Josefa del S...Bianca Josefa del S...</p>

<p>Who was she? Where was she to be found?</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>"Has anyone seen young Mocs these days?"</p>

<p>Sven Arped put the question to his circle, having sucked in,
with a hiss, the foam left by a <i>Bock</i> on his drooping
moustachios and opulent beard. "Upon my soul, the lad has become a
living conundrum&mdash;a walking riddle! In place of a how-do, does
he now meet you, he buttonholes you to inquire, with dry lips:
harkee, have ever you heard tell of a Bianca Josefa&mdash;a Bianca
Josefa with an S? (An S, mark you!) Who is she? Where is she to be
found?...this Bianca Josefa and her appendage!&mdash;Boys, what
madness is this? For no farther does the fellow get. He stops
short&mdash;like a winged bird&mdash;and will say no more."</p>

<p>But when he walked the next night at his young friend's side,
now in the inky shadow of the houses, now in the river of light
which a full moon, riding the gabled roofs, sent coursing down the
narrow streets; here, Arped dropped his mockery. His tone was mild,
even fond.</p>

<p>"You are not working?"</p>

<p>"I am not working." And Mocs turned the palms of his hands
outwards, to express his inner dearth.</p>

<p>Arped laid a fatherly hand on his shoulder. "Patience, boy,
patience!...it will pass." But in continuing he grew emphatic, and
slashed at the air with his sombrero as if to carve it in slices.
"Meanwhile, repose...divert yourself. Let the tired nag stretch its
neck. Turn to women, my son! Lave your eyes in their beauty, your
mind in their childlike prattle&mdash;have I not always said, you
lose by holding aloof? Mark me, though, I say 'women!' With women
you remain in the shallows; a woman may lure you into the depths.
And from that, may the good God preserve you! For the artist is
permitted to enjoy the things of the heart in imagination only. For
him, women must be but the match to light the flame; never the
flame itself...which might consume him. And so I say to you, lad,
I, Sven Arped"&mdash;and he smacked his lips, and sucked, as after
a foamy draught&mdash;"I say to you, beware the pull! Love your
fill; freely give and freely take; but, should you feel the pull
threaten, then, yes, then it is time to flee. Avoid it, my child,
as you would the plague or the devil."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?...the pull," asked Mocs, with but
languid interest.</p>

<p>Arped, now thoroughly in the vein, threw out his chest.</p>

<p>"I mean, as long as you are able to enjoy
unthinkingly&mdash;enjoy and put your pleasure from you, once it is
over&mdash;you are safe. The danger comes when, absent from your
inamorata, you are yet conscious of her presence. When a memory of
her image tangles your thoughts, disintegrates your life. When,
apart from her, you feel a sense of longing and loss...we Danes
call it <i>savn</i>. When fantastic fears assail you, or a bitter
jealousy consumes: no, no! the artist dare have no traffic in
things such as these. Does he yield to the temptation, he dies to
his art.&mdash;You do not understand? Ah! you are still young,
cold, untouched. But the day will come, my Jerome, will surely
come. And then, remember Father Arped's warning!"</p>

<p>Mocs smiled.</p>

<p>Some twenty-four hours later, an old waiter approached the table
where the group of friends sat, and said with a bow:</p>

<p>"I ask pardon of the gentlemen...I overheard their talk. I can,
I believe, give them the information they seek. This young
gentleman here inquires for a certain Bianca Josefa del
Sanseverina, is it not so? It was a variety singer, sir, who
appeared at Tessino's cafe in a northern suburb: a person of a fine
presence, with a voice like a bird's. About a week or ten days ago,
if my memory serves me. Where to? To...let me think...yes, to N.,
where she was next billed to appear."</p>

<p><b>II.</b>
</p>

<p>Jerome Mocs gave chase. Overnight, without a word even to Arped,
he vanished from his friends' midst, a prey to one of those
ungovernable impulses that have their breeding-place in empty,
worked-out brains, and exasperated nerves.</p>

<p>Himself he felt as if, by yielding to the urge, he was escaping
from a world peopled by bloodless shades. Of which his art was as
chimerical as any. And at first the novelty of his
journeyings&mdash;until now he had travelled only in tones, with an
eye everlastingly bent on notes and staves&mdash;helped him to the
belief that he was in touch with reality at last. His way, too, led
him through many lovely places, the time of the year was spring,
and he but two-and-twenty.</p>

<p>But the clues he followed continued of the slightest&mdash;a
word here, a line of print there, a glimpse caught in passing of a
tattered paper face. And very soon they failed him altogether. A
little cafe-chantant artist seemed to enter a great city only to be
lost in the crowd; the prints of hundreds of other feet closed over
hers. Once again he was baffled; and, at this new check, the same
fiery anger ran through him as at the failure of his inspiration.
Now, though, it was directed against the unknown woman who, by her
witch-hold on him, was eating up his life. Woe to her when he found
her!</p>

<p>Thus, savage and despairing, he hawked from place to place.</p>

<p>Then a queer thing happened.</p>

<p>From the noisy streets of a city in central Europe, he turned
one night into a cafe for his evening meal. It was early, a mere
sprinkling of guests was present, and the waitresses loitered in a
group, idly gossiping. They seemed very merry. The one who came to
take his order was giggling; giggling when she planked his
<i>Krug</i> down on its mat. She had a fat, foolish face, on which
the one-time dimples had run to lines.</p>

<p>Mocs raised misanthropic eyebrows. "Pray, what's the matter with
you?"</p>

<p>The girl sniffed apologetically, drawing her knuckles across her
mouth. "Oh, nothing. It's just that Salli there. She mimics people
that it's a scream.&mdash;The little dark one...with her back to
us."</p>

<p>Having been the last customer to enter, Mocs cocked the
apprehensive eye of a very young man at the quizzing group of
girls. Two were just the ordinary plump pigeons. The third still
presented her back to him&mdash;a sturdy, broadish back, topped by
a small dark head. But, as he looked, she turned and faced
him...and then, at the hard, stony, disbelieving stare to which he
subjected her, her smile died out as if a sponge had been passed
over it, leaving her round-eyed, open-mouthed.</p>

<p>To the waitress, who was turning away, he cried: "Here,
you!...Berthe, Mizi, Trudl, or whatever your name is...send that
girl Salli to me!"</p>

<p>"But 'tisn't her table! She serves the row by the wall."</p>

<p>"Hers or not, she's to come here."</p>

<p>"My goodness me!&mdash;But you won't get far with Salli, young
sir. She's not that sort."</p>

<p>"That's my affair!"</p>

<p>With a perk and a toss, she rejoined her mates; Mocs saw the
four deep in confab. The pigeons eyed him with a spiteful
curiosity. But the little dark girl shook her head, and vanished
through the swing-doors leading to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Fat-face strolled back to him, wearing a thin, malicious
smile.</p>

<p>"Now then!...is she coming?"</p>

<p>"I guess not! Or not till you say what 'tis you want."</p>

<p>"Well and good then!" And picking up his glass, Mocs stalked
across the room to re-seat himself at a table by the wall.</p>

<p>"<i>Jesses</i>!...aren't you a one?" murmured the waitress
behind his retreating form, and pettishly swished the table with
her cloth.</p>

<p>Mocs sat with his eyes glued to the door. Now, she could not
escape him! And no sooner did she reappear than he raised a
customer's crooked finger and beckoned her to him. There was
nothing for it; she had to obey. Sulkily, unwillingly, she crossed
to his side.</p>

<p>He had not been mistaken. Before him, in this ordinary little
serving-girl, he had one of those staggering resemblances
occasionally to be met with between two mortals who are yet
unlinked by any ties of blood. It was, indeed, more of a replica
than a resemblance, though both features and outline gave the
impression of being slightly blurred, and though the whole face was
triter and commoner, entirely lacking in the wilfully heightened
charactery of the unknown artist's brush. But the eyes were the
very eyes of his haunting. Here, in this vulgar setting, shone the
twin stars that had robbed him of his peace.</p>

<p>Dazed, dumbfounded, he sat with the bill-of-fare in his hand,
meandering a finger down the list of meats without knowing what he
read. His one thought was, how to detain this image, how so to
arrange things that he might keep the face before him. He had made
a bad start; his cheeks still tingled from it. For, at first sight
of her, and almost against his will, the foolish words had leapt
from him: "What are you doing here?" At which she had turned a
fiery red, and with a puzzled: "Me?...doing here?" had pointed to
her chest like a child counting out in a game. Not in this way
should he go to work.</p>

<p>First, though, to give an order. He named a dish at random, and,
she having stiffly and dumbly retired, gripped his head with his
hands and sat with closed eyes, trying to plumb the sensations this
apparition had stirred in him. He felt strangely angry; words like:
"How dare she...how dare she!" went round and round in his brain.
For this flagrant, fantastic resemblance affected him like a
theft&mdash;like something filched, purloined, stolen. And by such
a one!...from the woman of his dreams. It was a desecration&mdash;a
crime. And yet...as he sat nursing his anger, he gradually became
aware that the presence of even this reflection of his eidolon was
sending small thrills through him, of excitement and anticipation.
And a growing desire to look again mastered him; along with a fear
lest he had offended her, and she should send one of the other
girls to wait on him in her stead.</p>

<p>But she herself returned, carrying a tray: and her reappearance
was the signal for a fresh shock...of recognition, of satisfaction.
Swiftly his mind was made up. Leaning forward and calling her by
her name, he said in a low, urgent voice: "Salli, there are
things...see, I <i>must</i> speak to you! When do you get off? What
time does this place close?" At the queer look she threw him,
however, he again turned uneasy; what if she was expecting
something else, something more personal? Spurred by the thought, he
tried to take her hand as it moved over the table.</p>

<p>But she jerked it away. "Don't! I won't have it!"</p>

<p>And then, aggrieved and bewildered: "What is it you want? Can't
you let me be?" She had a dry throaty voice that grated on his
car.</p>

<p>Both that night and the next, and the next again, he waylaid
her. The moon, three-parts full to start with, waxed at each
meeting, and their shadows grew nightly denser and stumpier. There
she stood, the typical little working-girl, in a round black-straw
hat, the brim of which cut off half her face, a prim little black
cape hanging from her shoulders. But, say what he would, he could
make no headway. She did not thaw&mdash;just stood and let him
talk, in watching the toe of her shoe draw circles on the
pavement.</p>

<p>Not until their third meeting would she agree to him walking
home with her: to the little wooden house by the river where she
lived with her mother, a "fancy ironer." And it took him over a
week to persuade her to throw up her job and go away with him. She
was "not that sort." Nor did the conventional "I love you," with
which he backed up and, as it were, decked out his persuasions,
deceive her. But in the course of this week he paid a private visit
to the mother, whom he found easy-going and compliant. So that in
the end, public opinion, voiced by this mother and the girl's
fellow-workers, who were loud in envy of her luck: "<i>such</i> a
pretty boy!" "Money, too, or I'll be eat!" "Fool, you, if you don't
get all you can out of him!" wore her resistance down.&mdash;And
Mocs carried her off.</p>

<p><b>III.</b>
</p>

<p>He christened her Bianca; and she came to the name as humbly as
a dog to any that his master chooses to bestow on him. It is so:
hence it must be so. A more spirited creature might at least have
shown some curiosity. Not so she: she had not a grain of spirit in
her. Altogether there was something dog-like about her: her
dumbness, her servileness, her...her stupidity. Yes, that word
fitted her best: stupid she was, and stupid she remained. Thus, at
the end of a day or two, he summed her up.</p>

<p>In this dullness, which warped their intercourse and made all
but the crude physical side of it a cumbrous and a laboured thing,
her eyes alone had no share. These continued to burn with a strange
inner light, and lost none of their power to move him. He still
felt, when she turned them on him, that in them some ancient wisdom
lay hid, which it was imperative he should make his own.
<i>When</i> she looked! The trouble was, she remained as mutinous
as ever about facing him: just in this, most crucial way denied
herself: casting none but sly, sloping glances, that fled even as
they touched him.</p>

<p>Hence, his original scheme, of snatching what he wanted and
letting her go, came to nothing. With a nature such as this he did
not know how to deal. None of his strokes told. Hitting at her was
like hitting into a lump of dough. Though that there was another
side to her he very well knew, remembering his first sight of her.
Again, one hot afternoon when she believed him sleeping, he heard
her chattering away in the wash-house below, where she was bearing
their landlady company.&mdash;For, in this semi-alpine village,
where the mountains tapered off into hills and the hills ran down
to the plains, they had found a lodging with the chief laundress of
the place, Frau Rosi, who stumped about her tubs the livelong day,
her bare feet thrust into clogs, her vast, unbound figure a-swing.
The soapy, steamy air of the wash-house was no doubt a homely
odour, to a girl used to the hot air of the ironing-room. At any
rate it served to loose her tongue. While as far as he was
concerned she might have been born without one.</p>

<p>He had approached her too roughly and precipitately in the
beginning...he saw that now. So, grown warier, he did his best to
hide from her how personally unattractive she was to him. (And, he
being her first lover, and she very young, it was not hard, he
flattered himself, to bluff her.) The plain truth was, nothing
about her pleased him. Her way of walking, for instance. Short and
thick-set, she advanced with a roll from side to side that was
little less than a waddle. Speedily he rid her of her intolerable
"Sunday best," now her daily wear, by buying her a peasant-dress,
which hid the worst points of her figure. Her hands were not so
easily got rid of&mdash;these short, fat, work-seamed hands, with
deeply bitten nails. He put one from him once, in a moment of
disgust; and simultaneously felt the shift of her lowered gaze from
it to his own slim, well-tended musician's hands. After that, she
carried hers tucked under her voluminous black apron, or doubled up
behind her back. And one day she capped the climax by appearing
with a pair of huge, clown-like, white-cotton gloves dangling from
the ends of her plump little arms. He was convulsed with inward
laughter, but made no comment; and together they walked paths
strewn with pine-needles, through woods into which the golden
sunshine fell only in streaks and blotches, she thus ludicrously
attired.</p>

<p>But, on their way home, he halted on the wooden bridge that
spanned the milky-green alpine river. Here, taking each glove in
turn by one of the long, clown-like fingers, he drew it off, and
rolling the two to a ball, dropped this in the swiftly flowing
water. It bobbed about, twirled, was swept away.</p>

<p>"And that's that!"</p>

<p>For a moment he thought she was going to cry. Her lips pouched
and trembled. But she said nothing; just hung her head and slid her
naked hands back under her apron. After this, though, they were
more carefully scrubbed; and gradually the ingrained black of the
seams yielded, the nails grew less unsightly. And before she had
finished, she could show quite a presentable little pair of
paws.</p>

<p>This affair showed an artless desire to please, and he counted
it to her credit. But it ended here, led nowhere: not an inch
further did he get because of it. She seemed to sit entrenched
behind a wall of her own making. A wall of mute resistance; an
entrenchment of sulks and sullens. But her very dumbness spoke for
her, and to him what it said was: you dragged me here against my
will; I didn't want to come, I didn't want you. I'll give what I am
bound to give, but no more; the rest is my own. And this, when all
he really wanted of her <i>was</i> this intangible, incorporeal
remainder! For the bodily intimacy they were forced into left him
cold; sensually she meant as little to him as he to her. His mind
hankered after just what she would not give; and day by day he grew
more incensed at the persistence with which she withheld
herself.</p>

<p>None of the little endearments of ordinary lovers&mdash;overflow
of the closer bond&mdash;passed between them. He was never driven
to smooth her hair, or to lay his arm about her and cup the place
where arm and shoulder met, or to stoop and put his lips to her
neck. Now, indeed, in his exasperation, he had to master a crazy
inclination to hurt her. And, taking her by the chin, to jerk her
stubborn face up to his, he would pinch her flesh between thumb and
finger till she turned red with pain.</p>

<p>So it went on till that day when he first saw her cry. When he
first made her cry.</p>

<p>In actual count of time they had been together but a week: but,
as they walked that morning through the dewy freshness of the
forest, he stalking ahead, she a couple of paces behind, he felt as
if, for the better part of his life, he had gone with this mute
shadow at his heels. There were men who complained of women's
eternal clacking: God! give him rather one who talked from dawn to
eve. And when they had reached their goal, and sat at a wooden
table before a mountain inn, alone but for the hens scratching
round their feet, and for a gaunt cat which, perched on a
neighbouring table, watched them with unwinking green
eyes&mdash;here he came to a swift decision. He would bring things
to a head here and now, force her out into the open, compel her to
speak&mdash;oh! to-day he felt ripe for a scene...was regularly in
the mood.</p>

<p>Leaning over the table, he snatched at rather than took her
hand, gripping it till the ring on his little finger cut into her
palm.</p>

<p>"Look here, my girl!&mdash;enough is enough. I'll stand no more.
I'm done, finished, played out. Now you shall say&mdash;you
<i>shall</i> say!...what's wrong with you. Or else we part."</p>

<p>That got her. Wincing, she shot him one of her most furtive
glances, and tried to stammer out: "But nothing!" Her dry lips
refusing, she feebly shook her head.</p>

<p>At this renewed prevarication, his last shred of patience fell
away. Careless of the woman of the inn, who was advancing with a
load of plates, he brought his fist down in a blow that made the
table dance and the woman retreat, sent the hens scuttling, the cat
flying. Then, with his eyes aflame, his head alternately thrown
back or menacingly forward, his loose black hair tossing, the
fingers of his free hand making spear like motions, he gave his
rage and indignation vent, pouring out all he had fumed over in
silence, and so working himself up that he did not even spare her a
recital of her physical shortcomings: her hands, her walk, her
voice, her manner of speaking, every thing about her that had
jarred on his nerves: by this means setting free not only his
present tangled emotions, but also the accumulated fire and passion
which, given a creative work, would have found their outlet in that
work: as well as the shame and misery his prolonged
unproductiveness had caused him, him orphaned of the art that was
his salvation. When, for sheer shortage of breath, he came to a
stop, he was white and trembling. But relieved as of a
load&mdash;relieved beyond the telling.&mdash;And she? The blood
that had driven up over neck, cheeks, forehead, slowly ebbed again,
leaving her, too, paler than before. There she sat, and, under the
lash of his tongue, turned her head helplessly from side to side,
like a tortured animal seeking refuge. But she could not escape:
her hand was held in a vice. There was nothing left for her to do
but weep, and weep she did; he had never seen such tears. They
rolled out from under her lids like large round glass beads, slid
one after the other down her cheeks and chin, losing shape as they
fell, and dripping unheeded into her lap. It was a very child's way
of weeping; she made no attempt to hide them, or to wipe them away.
But when the sobs came, and twisted up her face, she let her head
droop, lower and lower, till it ended by lying on the hand that
held hers. And then both their hands were wet.</p>

<p>His anger had puffed out like a candle-flame. And to feel these
tears on his hand did the rest. Lifting his other hand he put it on
her hair, so that for a moment her head was shut between them.</p>

<p>But in her, too, her tears set something free. He felt her lips
move, and bending, caught the words: "Oh, I've been so...so
afraid."</p>

<p>"Afraid?" he echoed uncertainly. "What of? Of me?"</p>

<p>She nodded. Then made space enough to whisper: "You see, it's
because...oh, if I could only understand&mdash;if I only
<i>knew</i> what it is you want. For it isn't...it's not
<i>really</i>...me. Me you don't even <i>like</i>&mdash;you're only
cruel to."</p>

<p>"Cruel?...I? Oh, no, little Bianca," he demurred, but
unthinkingly, his mind busy with her unlooked-for insight.</p>

<p>Again she nodded. "Yes. Why, this is the...the very first time
you've ever spoke kind to me."</p>

<p>And now, as if still further to astonish him, she raised her
head, dabbed her cheeks with her knuckles, and looked at
him&mdash;looked straight and full, giving her eyes as one might
give one's hands to a sorely-missed, long-absent friend.&mdash;His
vicious hold relaxed, turned to a warm and easy clasp.</p>

<p>His quest was ended. To this moment of time his devious steps
had led him. There he sat, and was now free to drink his fill, in
one of those long, searching looks from man to woman, when every
veil falls.</p>

<p>But the expected revelation did not take place. Mysterious
depths in these eyes there were none. All he could find in them,
peer and press as he would, was a disarming candour, the bare
simplicity of a child. Persuaded by their frankness, he began to
believe her stammered confession that fear alone had made her
shrink from him. And suddenly, to his own astonishment, he found
himself smiling at her, to cheer her, give her courage. To which,
though her lips were still a-twitch and a-tremble, she made a brave
effort to respond. And the way this little half-smile, the widening
and thinning of the lips, lit up her face was extraordinary. It
also called two dimples into play&mdash;two adorable, roguish
dimples&mdash;one in each cheek. Why! she was almost pretty when
she smiled.</p>

<p>But this admission, arrived at grudgingly, and as it were in
spite of himself, was trivial compared to the next.</p>

<p>It was only twenty-four hours later; but hours alive with the
throbs, the surprises, the delicious bagatelles of a rapidly
deepening feeling. She was cutting bread, and the great knife
slipped and gashed her hand. Out spurted the blood, running down
palm and wrist, and falling to her apron in thick red drops. Like
tears of blood. At the sight alarm seized him, to whom hands were
precious property, and he dashed from room to room in search of a
basin, cold water, a sponge, a bandage. Then, biting his lips on
his squeamishness, he washed and dressed the wound. But it left him
a-shake. And in the overflow of this nervous excitement he caught
her to him, and held her fast, with a: "Bianca...little Bianca!"
For a moment she was content to stand and nuzzle her face into the
stuff of his coat. Then, throwing back her head she looked up at
him and laughed, laughed from sheer happiness, the lashes of her
starry eyes turned back, a line of strong little white notched
teeth visible, the corners of her sweet mouth indented as by the
twist of a finger-tip, all her dimples a-play.</p>

<p>When she laughed she was lovely.</p>

<p>This discovery broke down the last barriers between them.
Henceforth, he was as utterly hers as, she whispered, at heart she
had always been his. But now there was no more room for doubts and
precautions, and she surrendered herself to him with an artless
abandon; while into his feelings for her stole a tender, jealous
passion that made him not only hotly overthrow his previous
cavillings, but even take up arms for her defects. Her voice,
formerly hoarse and displeasing to his ear, now grew to seem a
veiled contralto, and as if made to whisper endearments. Her way of
speaking was pithy, picturesque. At the base of each chubby finger
sat a tiny dimple, just big enough to drop a kiss in. Even her walk
became as lovable to him as it had once been grotesque. It belonged
to her, was hers only; he would have known her among a hundred
others because of it; for nothing in the world would he have had it
changed.</p>

<p>And in the days that followed, days of young love, of first
love, they knew a happiness without compare. A golden summer played
its part, dealing them out endless hours of sunshine, and nights of
cloudless or starry skies. Sometimes they lay stretched on the
smooth grass of an <i>Alm</i>, high above tree-level, where no
sound reached them but the scattered tinkling of the cow-bells, or
faint echoes of cries or whistles from the valley below. Or, in a
<i>Sennerin's</i> hut, they drank to each other over the rim of
glasses of foamy milk, strong of the stall. Again, of an evening,
his arm lying round her, all the warmth and ardour of her young
body calling to his, they would sit and watch the moon come up
behind the mountains opposite. These were black as pitch, their
outlines deeply graved on the violet sky. Until the immense silver
globe of the moon, sailing in splendour, cast loose from them and
floated away in space, turning the velvety black of the forest-clad
slopes to a pearly grey. Meanwhile, around them, all the scents of
the day were being set free: the fragrance of clover and new-mown
hay from the meadows; the resinous smell of new wood from the
sawmills; the scent of sun-warmed firs, of damp moss, of crystal
streamlets, with which, in the cool of the evening, the night wind
bore, heavily laden, down the mountain side.</p>

<p><b>IV.</b>
</p>

<p>And summer passed. With this woman of flesh and blood in his
arms, all thought of the phantom woman had faded from his mind.</p>

<p>So it was with a shock of something more than surprise, on
unfolding his newspaper one morning, that he saw before him, black
on white, the name he would once have given all he had to see. Now,
his first impulse was mentally to jump away from it. With a quick
glance at his companion, he turned over and crumpled up the sheet.
But as soon as she had left the room he went back to it, and
smoothed it out. What if his eyes had played him false? But there
it stood: an announcement that the singer, Bianca Josefa del
Sanseverina, would perform at a certain cafe, in the city of M., on
such and such an evening.</p>

<p>He threw the paper from him and laughed. He could afford to
laugh. What did she matter to him now?</p>

<p>But, matter or not, the mere sight or sound of the name had set
something stirring in him again. And, that night, he lay and went
back on all that had happened to him since the day when he hurled
his manuscript into a drawer and turned the key on it; went back on
his wild-goose chase and its fantastic issue; and, over this, the
image of the unknown woman came oddly to life again. He began to
wonder what his sensations would be, if, at long last, he found
himself face to face with her. Did the mysterious hold she had had
over him still persist? Curious?...yes, curious he
was&mdash;perhaps even more than curious. And admitting this
brought on a fit of restlessness, in which he tumbled and tossed.
Before him, on the whitewashed wall, the tiny, flower-encumbered
window printed a silver square. Beyond the window, a black ridge of
mountain cut across the sky. Not a sound broke the stillness. Or
only that of his watch which, hanging above his head, had suddenly
begun a frenzied ticking. He could close his eyes to the moonshine,
to the mountains, but the noise of this ticking he could not shut
out. And, as he lay and listened, it seemed to, grow in strength,
until it filled the room. He sat up in bed. To become aware that
every nerve in his body was beating in unison with it, and that it
had turned to a kind of menace, and what it said was: Time flies,
time flies, time flies! He snatched it from its hook and buried it
under the mattress, but this did not help, it had left its echo in
the air; time was still in flight...while he lay supine, inert. And
now he knew that he would go&mdash;would have to go. Once more this
stranger, this interloper, had thrust herself destructively in upon
his life.&mdash;The old fury blazed up in him. He lay and cursed
her.</p>

<p>To the girl beside him he said: "A day...at most a couple of
days, sweetheart!"</p>

<p>This for his own comfort as much as hers. For she did not
murmur, or try to dissuade him, or even put a question about the
business that was calling him away: a sweet reasonableness that
made her doubly dear to him.</p>

<p>At the very last moment, he was within an ace of jumping from
the train and letting his dreams go hang. Left standing alone on
the gravelled platform, she looked so childish and forlorn that his
heart misgave him. True, she smiled, showing, all her dimples, but
with lips pressed tight one on the other, to hide their trembling;
while her fingers rolled and twisted without pause at a corner of
the big black apron. But again something stronger than himself
prevailed. All he did was to lean from the window, and wave to her,
and swing his hat, till a turn in the line hid her from sight.</p>

<p>Arrived in M. he traced his way with ease, and that evening
found him sitting among a cluster of portly burghers and their
wives, who supped at tables set in front of a small stage. On this,
when he entered, a sinister-looking individual in evening clothes
and an opera-hat was cracking a riding-whip, to the strokes of
which and his shouts of command, a madonna-faced woman, sheathed in
black to her chin, to her finger-tips, her toes, with nothing of
her visible but a lasciviously white face under an enormous black
hat, capered like a horse. The performance earned scant applause.
Then came the turn of the singer. Or should have come. But an
interminable wait followed, in which raised voices could be heard
behind the scenes. The audience grew restive. Whereupon the tawdry
curtains rattled apart, and on to the stage walked...a
woman...<i>the</i> woman, his woman!&mdash;oh! one look, one only,
and it was as if, in a titanic burst of laughter, a merciless,
sardonic laughter, a giant bubble exploded and collapsed. For
this...<i>this</i>!...he had torn up his life by the roots, dragged
himself over half Europe. His eyes sought the ground.</p>

<p>At odds with custom, however, the voice had not suffered the
irreparable damage of the flesh. And over his lowered head it
trilled its way, serene and pure, through some half-dozen ditties,
each with a sting in its tail.</p>

<p>His first impulse had been to fly, to put distance between
himself and the catastrophe this apparition was to him. But he was
far from the entrance, and the right moment had passed. He remained
sitting. And, the turn at an end, he abruptly rose and pushed his
way through the papered door that gave behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Here the dispute had broken out afresh. Between the singer and
the man of the whip. Money, it seemed, was owing her; and money she
would and must have. But while she continued to vociferate,
snatching breaths with the skill of the practised singer, she was
also coolly taking in and appraising the young man who stood fixing
her; and more than one meaning glance was sped at him from under
her heavily blued and bistred lids. Still without ceasing in her
flow, she edged near enough to him to press his arm, touch his foot
with hers. Almost before he knew where he was, he found himself
engaged to take her out to supper.</p>

<p>She was <i>hungry</i>. Under the glaring lights of a gilt and
plush restaurant, he sat and watched her jaws go, in a kind of
<i>perpetuum mobile</i> of mastication, of talk. Never had he seen
such an eater, heard a like volubility. Whether her mouth was empty
or full, she carried on at the top of her voice, chewing the while
with many a juicy smack and suck, and much running of her tongue
round her teeth. Moments came, when every eye was upon her.</p>

<p>But she had, it seemed, her own ideas of honesty. One of those
who tried to diddle you, get something out of you for nothing, she
was not...not she!&mdash;she said this once, she said it a dozen
times; on her tongue it became a kind of theme with variations.
And, her appetite finally glutted, he had no choice but to follow
her to the mean little <i>hotel garni</i> where she lodged, and, at
her heels, climb a bare stone stair to a room on the second floor,
in the lock of which she fitted a key.</p>

<p>She switched the lights on, and he looked past a grimy portiere
into a dingy, disorderly bedroom.</p>

<p>Holding back the curtain with one hand, with the other she
signed to him to enter.</p>

<p>"Here you are! This is the way."</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Not till the second morning after, did he succeed in making his
escape.</p>

<p>Early though the hour was, a crowd of Saturday holiday-makers,
armed with sticks, ropes and knapsacks, was hastening to catch the
first train to the mountains. He mingled with them; pushed and
shoved his way; joined in the rude scramble for a seat.</p>

<p>But no sooner was the train in motion than he wandered
restlessly into the corridor, and planted himself at the window to
watch the country fly by. Free...free! And now for&mdash;But
no!...not again, not as long as he lived, would that name cross his
lips. It was fouled for him for ever...by arts indescribable.
Salli&mdash;little Salli! In fancy he held her to him, felt her
small head sleek to his chin, the skin of her neck blossom-soft and
cool. Oh! once with Salli again, and all would be well.</p>

<p>But would it? Was that true? Would her presence pacify him? Free
he might be, calm he certainly was not: deep down in him, a strange
excitement was brewing. An unnatural excitement, that had nothing
to do with Salli, or the joys of meeting. It recalled the throbbing
unrest which the tick of his watch had set a-going in him, that
moonlight night in the mountains. But was even more violent. He
eyed himself in dismay. His heart hammered, his fingers trembled
with suspense. He was like a man who stood waiting, with every
nerve on end, for a bomb that is timed to fall. What on earth was
happening to him?</p>

<p>With limbs as jerky as if hung on wires, he went back to the
carriage, and turned to rid himself of his hat by tossing it on to
the rack.</p>

<p>And then he knew.</p>

<p>He was still on his feet, still steadying himself by the rail,
when the miracle happened. Quite suddenly, it was as if walls
dropped away&mdash;from his brain, his sight, the carriage
itself&mdash;walls that had shut him in, blocking and hindering.
Now, with one accord they fell, but as noiselessly as soft
curtains. For an instant their collapse seemed to leave him alone
in space, without a hold, and feeling strangely shrunken. In the
next it was he who filled space, swelled by a power that ran
through him and overflowed him, magnificently spreading until it
embraced all living things. Then he knew. The gift of creation was
his again, he was one again with his daemon' his genius; with that
mystic force which alone justified his existence. Humbly, like one
accepting alms, he yielded to its oncoming; yet with a silent shout
of exultation: received it into himself&mdash;as the prone,
entranced body, lying deep in sleep, receives back the
night-wanderer that is its spirit.</p>

<p>With a kind of groan he sank to his seat, and hid his face in
his hands. For, in this moment, in this lightning-flash of
perception, he had seen his way: the link, the key was his, for
lack of which his work had shattered: the handful of notes, the
combination of tones, needed to start the chain of ideas that
should carry him rapturously to the end. His now&mdash;all his! But
he reached for neither pencil nor paper; before now he had known
the prosaic act of transcription break the flow. He just sat with
tight-closed eyes, and lived through, to its last intricate
windings, the revelation that had been made him; with such
intensity that each note might have been written in fire, each
phrase burnt with a hot iron on his brain. Sat, and let himself
sink into the state nearest bliss vouchsafed to mortal on this side
of the great divide; a bliss that shares the quivers of a sheerly
physical pleasure, yet is past expression subtle and pure: when the
creative artist, freed from the trammels of time, lives through
aeons in a few seconds of man's measuring.</p>

<p>At the first stop he left the train, and, some hasty purchases
made, fell to the drudgery that must follow even the most inspired
flights. The day passed; in a gloomy hotel-bedroom it was noon, it
was afternoon, then dusk, before he finally lifted his head: pale,
spent, famished; but a king again in his own right.</p>

<p>His first move was to seek for a calendar. And, this found, he
began hastily to reckon and dovetail dates. Yes! it was still
possible. With luck&mdash;oh, God give it!&mdash;he might yet be in
time. Luck, and a toil beggaring description, was he to have his
manuscript ready to lay in Maestro Ricchi's hands on the appointed
day.</p>

<p>There was not a moment to lose. First to get food; then for the
night train to the north.</p>

<p>But something troubled him; there was something at the back of
his brain that he could not get at. He put a hand to his forehead.
Then...why, of course, blamed fool that he was!...Salli.</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation he drew a sheet of paper to him
and wrote:</p>

<blockquote>My own love, my little Salli!<br>
<br>
All day you will have waited for me and hoped for my
coming&mdash;you are perhaps still waiting, still hoping&mdash;and
I...I shall not come. Not any more, little love&mdash;or not for a
very long time. And so I say to you, do not wait. Go back to your
old life, and take it up where you laid it down for my sake. But
don't forget me, child, or the many happy hours we have spent
together. From my heart I thank you for them&mdash;though I am
forced to act in what must seem an ungrateful way. I shall not
forget. I shall treasure the memory of all you gave me...like a
lovely flower that time cannot fade. It may be that some day I
shall come back. Who knows! Till then, farewell, my little love. I
thank you again and again.<br>
<br>
Your<br>
<br>
Jerome.</blockquote>

<p>But later in the evening, when he had eaten and drunk, and food
and wine were insinuating their warmth through his veins, he tore
this letter to small pieces. Salli!...little Salli. A longing for
her that was sharp as pain was upon him: to see her, to hold her to
him again, seemed the acme of his desire. He was still so young; he
stretched out his arm, the better to feel the youth and strength of
it; and he loved her, loved her. In thought he lived through their
meeting: the snatched hands, stammered words, the rush of body to
body, the sinking to sleep, work-worn and passion-spent, on her
breast. If he broke with her now, he would never see her but as in
his last glimpse of her&mdash;a picture to haunt him all his
days.</p>

<p>When his whole heart cried out for her.</p>

<p>And yet...To go back now, let this unique chance slip his grasp,
might&mdash;<i>would</i> mean hazarding his whole future as an
artist. And that he would never forgive himself. Not in this way
was happiness to be bought. When passion flagged...as passion
did&mdash;must flag...</p>

<p>Feverishly he sought an alternative. What if he took her with
him?...wrote and bade her follow him? But even as the thought came
to him he swept it aside. Absorbed in his work he needed no one,
could tolerate nobody beside him...let alone a woman: he the "Saint
Jerome" of his friends' gibes! To be perpetually aware of a
presence, no matter how mute, how humble, would hang him with
chains. Nor was it he alone who came in question. What of her, who
had so far known him only in a summer mood of idleness, of
relaxation, when he became cold, preoccupied, a victim of the
fierce nervous irritability to which creative work condemned
him?</p>

<p>And then...his friends...the clique his life was spent amongst.
What, take her, his little love, back among this ribald, scoffing
crew?&mdash;this artist-pack that respected no one and nothing
outside the products of their own genius? She would get scant mercy
at their hands. For it was not even as if...The plain truth being,
love had stolen a kind of march on him, dimming his vision, making
him in the end fond even to her unlovelinesses. But <i>they</i>
would judge her as inhumanly as he himself had once done; each of
her defects serve as the butt for a coarse witticism, an obscene
joke: he could imagine them, from Arped down, cynically winking and
chuckling. At the thought, such a wave of protective tenderness ran
through him, in this moment he so truly loved her, that doubts and
hesitations were swept away. Rather than expose her to so bitter an
obloquy, he would never see her again.</p>

<p>The rest was easy.</p>

<p>He wrote no second letter; better, since the break was
inevitable, that it be short and sharp. And having found a
telegraph-office, he pulled a form to him, and wrote the few words
that were all that remained to be said.</p>

<blockquote><i>Am not coming back. Return home</i>.</blockquote>

<p>This done, he flung out and strode through deserted streets,
where a gusty wind buffeted him at every corner, and the branches
of half-bare trees thrashed despairingly. Afterwards, in waiting
for the train, which was late, he paced a station open at both ends
to the dark, and cheerless as the night itself: a place of murky
shadows, and hollow, clanking sounds; of tears, partings,
irremediable regrets.</p>

<p>The thunder of the express, cries of porters, opening of doors
roused him; hoisting himself up, he picked his steps among
disgruntled sleepers. And soon, with more banging and shouting, the
train slid into motion, and began to bore its way through the
night, shrilled round on the high plains by the whistle of the
wind. In the corner of a shaded carriage, Mocs sat and listened to
the grotesque distortions ground out by the wheels, now of this
theme, now of that. And oftenest what he heard was one of a tossing
sea, sailed by a ship carrying lover back to lover. In its broken
rhythm, its restless upward surge, his own unrest, his growing
exaltation found vent: he, with his face set once more for what, to
him, had never ceased to be the one Reality...all else but a
ghostly surrogate.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Mary Christina</h2>

<p>Mary Christina was going to die.&mdash;For sixty years, come
March, she had been an inhabitant of the earth, and had suffered
her full share of life's vicissitudes: she had passed from girl to
woman, had loved and been loved, had borne children and tended
children, had watched young faces lose their youth, and harden, and
grow unbeautiful; she had cared for graves; had resigned herself,
in the course of years, to the creeping on of age: she had wept,
and laughed, and been indifferent, mostly indifferent, as is man's
way; but now she was going to cease to be, and nothing would please
her, or sadden her, or leave her merely cold, again.</p>

<p>She knew what was coming, before anyone else; for she had had a
presentiment: so, at least, she called it, one grey November
afternoon, when, with icy hands outspread, she crouched low over a
fire from which she could derive no heat.</p>

<p>That day, while a sharp wind was causing the last, tattered
leaves to whirl madly on their stalks, Mary Christina had journeyed
to a distant quarter of the town. Her business done, she entered a
crowded conveyance. As she sat and let her eyes range over the row
of faces opposite her, faces worn with toil, and reddened with
exposure to the wind, she said to herself: "My God, how ugly people
are!" But, in the same breath, a small, inner voice rebuked her:
"Be thankful to be among them, Mary Christina! What, if you were
never out of doors again?" To which, elliptically, she made answer:
"Better now than in spring, when things are freshening up."</p>

<p>Mary Christina was going to die.</p>

<p>That night, the hour being come, she took off for the last time
the wrappings in which the world had known her, and, with as little
covering as she would ever again need, lay down between the sheets
that witness the incoming and the outgoing of mortals.</p>

<p>But the lying down and folding of the hands is not enough; it is
no such easy matter as that to die. The way out of life is as
darkly mysterious as the way in.</p>

<p>Thus, after having ever been one of those stoics who look upon
illness as a moral failing, to which it is dishonourable to yield;
after having borne her casual ailments as mutely as a suffering
animal, Mary Christina now began to fling about on her bed, in such
a manner that every one within call was needed to restrain her; and
to utter shrill, shameless cries, which echoed through the house.
Beads of moisture rolled from her forehead and made round spots on
the sheet, or splashed the hands of those who held her.</p>

<p>A stranger, summoned in haste, sat beside her bed. Before him, a
scrupulous, womanly reserve dropped like a rent veil.</p>

<p>The well-known faces of her children&mdash;children now in the
eyes of Mary Christina alone&mdash;hung over her. Hand after hand
sought hers, sweat-bedewed; and from the lips of the youngest broke
man's most human cry: "Oh, Mother...Mother!"</p>

<p>But though these, of all living creatures, had been in Mary
Christina's thoughts ever since they had come into the world;
though she had watched, night for night, till she knew their eyes
closed in sleep, harassed by the fears that only a mother knows;
though, up to the last, her love had thrown out a thousand arms, to
safeguard them on their divers ways, she was now as indifferent to
them as to the several strangers who moved round her bed. And the
withdrawal of her warm affection seemed, to those who had been used
to shelter beneath it, like the first significant victory gained by
death over life.</p>

<p>For Mary Christina, the centre of existence had shifted:
henceforth, her desire was only to herself. First came the
idolatrous attention demanded by her body&mdash;this strong,
personable body, still ablaze with energy, and resolutely desirous
of living. It was made the object of a religious care; untiring
were the endeavours to ward off the inevitable. The minutest
variations in the heat of the blood, in the pulsations of the
heart, were verified and controlled. Hitherto, she had lived
unconscious of her vital functions; now she, too, shared the
palpitating interest in their course. For all these things, now of
a morbid importance, were possible disarmers of the great enemy, of
the griping, gutting pain, to repel which was her chief concern.
This came at intervals. It began somewhere in the distance, far
away, drew rapidly nearer, darkening the bed with the shadow of its
wings; it hovered over her, circling like a vulture, she lying
defenceless and terrified; then, with one swoop, it descended and
settled on her, plunging beak and claws into the shuddering flesh.
She looked at those about her with wild eyes, dumbly imploring
them, praying to them, as to gods, to shield her from it; but they
did nothing. It tore at her, sick and faint with anguish; the
muscles of her body twisted into knots; she heard her own shrieks
rend the air.</p>

<p>For longer than eight long days she fought this fight, returning
time and again to the encounter, in which, each single time, she
left more of her strength. Gradually, however, the force of her
struggles declined, and the hope that had sustained her, the hope
of once coming off conqueror, died out. She still swallowed, with
avidity, the bitter draughts that were held to her lips; she
submitted, gladly, to the importunate services of the nurse, which
broke in, by night and by day, on her hard-won rest; she still gave
desperate battle, when the agony sucked at her; but it became a
mere blind instinct to live, without faith in the issue.&mdash;And
the watchers round the bed began to avoid her eyes, in which, at
moments, the death-secret was legible.</p>

<p>For eight days and over, she disputed each inch of ground, and
those whose lot it was to stand and look on, felt the limits of
human endurance strain to breaking-point. Then, however, a change
was visible. The pain still wrung her, in savage bouts; but Mary
Christina did not answer to it, as at first: her nerves were losing
their fine power, both to feel, and to interpret the feeling. She
ceased to resist so ardently, let the anguish engirdle her, do its
worst. Now that her nerves were drowsier, too, she was able, the
moment she ceased to suffer, to sink into repose; a tranquil,
twilight state, on the borderland between sleeping and waking; and
the experiences of a lifetime had numbered no goodlier pleasure
than this: the wishless well-being that follows on a vanishing
pain.</p>

<p>Her dark hair, fine as silk, was gathered loosely round her
head; iced cloths were strapped to her brow; her large, worn hands
lay folded on the sheet. The watchers stifled their own flickering
hopes, and gave up asking her how she did; for she could hardly
bring herself to return a pressure of the hand: all else was
immaterial to her, so long as the agony was kept at bay, and she
not roused from her present sweet reprieve. They moved on tip-toe,
fearful of disturbing her; for they believed she slept. But she was
not asleep&mdash;as one saw, who bent more nearly over her: the
dark pupils were fixed, beneath the half-fallen lids, like the
unclosed eyes of one already dead.</p>

<p>In these benign moments, when her torture slackened, Mary
Christina lay and let pictures pass before her&mdash;pictures,
fragments, flashes&mdash;of the life which, until now, had been
hers; and, compared with this intensely personal past, which had
its rise in mistiest morning memories, even her children seemed
unfamiliar to her&mdash;the chance associates of an hour.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago!...The walls of the room expanded, then fell in,
like the sides of a card house. It was a wide and sunny square;
before an old-fashioned house with a shiny brass knocker, under a
pale-blue English sky heaped with bulbous masses of cloud, a group
of children played. One had hair of a light, flaxen colour, which
flapped to her waistline, floated behind her as she ran. She was
the wildest and merriest of all; she threw the ball highest; she
caught it most surely as it came to earth again. In a spirit of
wantonness, elated by her own skill, she threw it so high and so
far that it did not return: it had gone over the wall of a
neighbouring garden. They were not allowed to enter this garden;
the ball, her ball, of which she had been so proud, was lost for
ever, and through her own folly. She sat down on the steps, and
wept bitterly. Her play-fellows, unable to comfort her, stole
away...</p>

<p>Years had passed. Overhead, a lowering grey sky; which was yet
no greyer than the flat stretch of earth beneath. Snow was in
waiting, but, so far, only a few detached flakes had fluttered
down. On a hard-frozen pond, people were skating: a young girl
stood at the edge, and followed their bird-like dartings and
skimmings. She wore a scarlet hood on her head. Seen against the
prevailing dullness, this hood burnt like a flame. Two young men
passed, swinging their skates; one turned to look at her, and she
caught an admiring word. He had bright, merry eyes. She reddened;
then, obeying an impulse, took to her heels and ran, never pausing
till she had crossed the home threshold. Too big for such frolics,
they rebuked her; but she only smiled at them in return, not
grasping what they said. Her thoughts were singing; life seemed
suddenly to mean undreamed-of wonders&mdash;the unravelling of a
magic coil...</p>

<p>And again the years moved forward. It was summer now. The sun
went down, huge, flamboyant, in a violet-streaked sky. At the
bottom of a tangled old garden, in a thicket of raspberry-bushes,
she stood with heaving breast, striving to repress tears of shame
and disappointment. Throughout the afternoon, he had seemed to
avoid her, had kept at the side of her friend. Now, she made as if
she were gathering fruit; but the basket on her arm was empty: she
stared unseeingly at the streaky red and gold of the western sky.
While she stood thus, a world of bitterness in her young heart, a
hand was laid on hers, and a kind voice said: Mary Christina...I
missed you...I came to look for you...The little fancy basket
dropped from her nerveless fingers, dropped among the bushes, and
there it was left, to lie and rot. How foolish of her it had been
to forget that basket! It was made of green straw; had a pretty
twisted handle. Why had she never gone back to look for
it?&mdash;what had blotted it from her mind? Did it still lie,
where it had fallen&mdash;a shapeless, sodden mass? Or had strange
hands recovered it?...Who lived now in the home of her girlhood?
Did other young lips meet beneath the flames of the evening
sky?...other feet tread the familiar paths, whence hers had for
ever passed?</p>

<p>The sick woman stirred uneasily, and moved her head. It was deep
night; the house was still, the room sunk in shadow. The darkness
oppressed her; she tried to look about her, and moaned. At the
sound, a soft-footed Sister of Mercy rose from out a patch of
gloom, and bent over her, presenting a cup to her dry lips: as she
drank, Mary Christina's fixed and feverish eyes met the stiff white
linen of wimple and bands. The draught soothed her, at once her
lids half-closed again; and the watcher shrank back into the corner
from which she had sprung.</p>

<p>Before she had reached it and sat down again to her beads, Mary
Christina seemed to hold a living child in her arms, gathered two
tiny feet into the cup-shaped hollow of her hand. A fire burnt in
the grate; wine-red curtains were drawn against a night of lashing
rain. Out on the highways, and in the storm-swept fields, these icy
rain-stripes spelled a shuddering desolation, within, in the safe,
warm room, husband and wife knelt to examine each soft line and
curve of the miracle that was theirs.&mdash;Surely there was no
better joy than this joy?...See!&mdash;how his hand grasps mine! He
listens...he smiles. Never was such a child born before!</p>

<p>Another turn of the wheel, and the babe was cold to the touch:
she stood pressing a little dress to her face, and eating her heart
out in vain regret. How she had struggled, and rebelled! She had
then believed that no after-grief could equal this grief for the
little dead child (so long since become one with the earth it lay
in); for this faint life-spark, of which all but herself speedily
forgot the existence. It had not been so, many a greater grief had
overtaken her: with the passing of the years, it sometimes seemed
as though sorrow's bowed and grey-veiled form would never again
quit her side. She had learned that it is easier to see a child
die, unspoiled, than to watch it change, grow hard, betray its
soul; had even come to rely on death, as on the fundamental stay of
life&mdash;the bed rock, beneath loose and shifting sands.</p>

<p>But after this last precise vision of the waxen babe that
awaited her in the land of shadows, the memories came crowding
thick and fast: she could not follow each singly to an end. The
later years, too, had been so like, one to another; and they had
flashed past with a dizzy quickness: one day she had been thirty,
and it seemed only on the morrow that she was sixty&mdash;an old
woman stretched out to face death. With the far-reaching sight
granted to dying eyes, she lay and looked back at the confused
pattern of her life, as at some richly-worked arras, and surveyed
it; but without emotion. Now, the many happenings that composed it
struck no answering chord in her; and it passed belief to think
that she had once been stirred to the depths of her soul by them.
In this hour of profounder knowledge, she saw that they had only
been dreams and shadows&mdash;delusive images that had tricked her
brain. Nothing of them had persisted; nothing been real or lasting:
her hand had caught the frayed edge of no perdurable garment. The
wonders had been a chimera; the evils, too. And their hold upon her
had been an imaginary one: her inmost self, the vitalest part of
her, had remained unmoved by them, and unharmed. She had not
striven in mortal combat; for there had never been a combat to
engage in. That was still another illusion&mdash;perhaps the
greatest of all. Life, tapped at its core, stripped of its rainbow
gauds, meant&mdash;she knew it now&mdash;a standing dumbly by, to
let these dream-things pass. Now that she was done with it, with
life and living, and could view it as a whole, she saw that this
was what it came to: one was never really of it; it only seemed so,
at the moment. One's soul held aloof, shy, proud, chill, while past
it bore an unsubstantial pageant of varying places, and their
accompanying ghosts. Sometimes, these shapes held out their arms to
us; sometimes, we stretched yearning hands to them. For a brief
suspense, there appeared to be an entanglement; then, one or other
yielded, and the procession went on as before. Love had no more
reality, no more enduring-power, than the lover's arms; the
dream-child we reared, changed and passed; joy passed and pain, and
the windy excitements of the day.&mdash;And memory, turning on the
steps of death's threshold, for a last backward look at the
sun-tipped mirage, could impossibly distinguish one transient image
from another. Now, they all seemed alike; they <i>were</i> alike:
there had been no real difference between them. Joy and grief, love
and hate, rapture and despair, were, in very truth, one and the
same&mdash;the thin, blue spire of smoke, that ascended from a
phantasmal fire.</p>

<p>And having achieved this ultimate wisdom, the dying woman was
lapped by a great peace: not again would she choose to be of life.
Now, she asked for rest&mdash;only rest. Not immortality: no fresh
existence, to be endured and fought out in some new shadow-land,
among unquiet spirits; but deep, deep rest, with the heavy brown
earth flattened down above her, and every wish stilled at last.
Without substance, without meaning, it had all been an idle beating
of the air; but it was over now; and she thanked God that it was
so. Never again, the laceration of a sunset, the agony of a fading
autumn day. Only sleep; the sleep of nothingness: an eternal
forgetting...</p>

<p>She lay and let death's torpor steal over her, dimly noting its
progress. But towards evening, when the cold blue eastern shadows
fell, she made the instinctive effort of the dying: sought to flee
the unfleeable, while there was yet time.</p>

<p>"I will get up and go away...far away."</p>

<p>She was raised in her bed and propped by loving arms; then laid
down again; for she was unable to support the weight of her own
body: her head, all a-tremble, sank from side to side, like a
top-heavy flower on its stalk.&mdash;And the sensation of sinking,
of being sucked under by a current she could not stem, began anew.
It was as if she were caught and swept round in a whirlpool: for a
time she would ride high, on the same level; then came the dizzy,
downward drop, and she was by so much nearer to the black,
serpent-like, central shaft, so much farther from the blue roof of
the sky. Down...down...down!&mdash;a giddy whirl towards the
horrors of the dark; and so it would go on, in ever-contracting
circles, till the awful moment when she whirled no more, and when
the churning waters met, with a crash of thunder, above her
head.</p>

<p>Then, the vertigo ceased, and a merciful weakness came to her
aid. Her thoughts, drawing to an inseparable tangle, escaped her,
and were re-absorbed in the Supreme Thought, from which they had
primarily come forth. Though her eyes remained open, doctor and
nurse no longer hushed their voices when they spoke of her: for
them, she was already numbered among those mute or inarticulate
things, which, because they cannot make protest, are held
insensible to hurt and affront.</p>

<p>Life ebbed lingeringly, unwillingly. A muddy pallor overspread
her face; her breath came snortingly; the pinched nose strained
upwards. But the heart beat on, throbbing through the dead body
till long after midnight.</p>

<p>Then this, too, ceased.</p>

<p>The weeping watchers retired, with the sense of relief in their
breasts that accompanies death accomplished; and the withdrawal of
their lamentations left a great vacancy in the room. The
black-robed woman who remained, raked out the embers of the fire,
and pushed back the chairs from the bed. On the eyes of the thing
that had been Mary Christina, she laid two squares of damped
muslin; and, as she did so, she made fervid intercession with the
other Mary&mdash;the Gracious Namesake of this poor soul that had
gone unblessed into the darkness. The coverings decently stretched
and folded, she turned out the gas, and set a night-light in a
glass of water.&mdash;It threw living shadows on the wall.</p>

<h2>The Coat</h2>

<p>The train was late, and she shifted uneasily from foot to foot
as she stood, the coat clinging and dragging like the water-logged
clothes on a drowning man. For the weather had done one of its
perverse changes, the November morning broken sunny and mild. Just
her luck: yesterday she could have worn the wretched thing in
comfort. Now, the mere thought of what lay before her&mdash;the
traipsing to and fro, the crowded buses, the overheated
shops&mdash;exhausted her.</p>

<p>But there, thank goodness, came the train, slithering round the
bend like a sly brown serpent. And before it fairly stopped the
windows were black with heads, carriage-doors flew open, porters
shouted and were shouted for, bags and cases tumbled out. She had
posted herself much too far down; had to trudge almost the length
of the platform before she found Margaret, standing stolid and
composed amid the racket. Just the same old sober-sides. The same
old face, too: nature unadorned, not a touch of make-up: country
from hat to shoes. One felt very chic and towny by comparison; and
as the two of them moved to join the tail of the crowd at the
gates, she saw to it that the skirts of the coat swayed
becomingly.</p>

<p>More than once she thought she felt Margaret eyeing her, but:
"So good of you, Katherine, to undertake to pilot me round," was
all that was said. Or (ridiculously): "Even to crunch the London
soot underfoot is a treat." And when they were out of the station,
through the arch and on their way to the bus, there was nothing for
it but herself to focus the other's wandering attention.</p>

<p>"What do you think of my coat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, er...very nice, very nice indeed. But isn't it rather heavy
for such a warm day?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no. Fur of <i>this</i> quality is never heavy." And as
Margaret's sole response was an agreeable smile: "It was a present
from Harry, you see. On my last birthday. He paid a ruinous price
for it&mdash;he's a regular spendthrift where I'm concerned.</p>

<p>"Really? And so it has been a great success&mdash;your
marriage?"</p>

<p>This time she, too, contented herself with smiling.</p>

<p>"I hope I'm to be allowed to meet him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he has promised to join us for lunch."</p>

<p>Glibly she brought out the falsehood. But, a strenuous morning's
shopping over&mdash;the sums she had to sit by and see spent! For
the plainer and dowdier the clothes, the more it seemed they cost.
And only the best of everything was good enough. The "ruinous
price" attributed to Harry began to give her qualms. And in the
shoe-shop she took care to keep her own feet out of sight&mdash;no
Harry met them.</p>

<p>At midday, then, they sat alone at their table in the restaurant
of a great store.</p>

<p>"It looks as if he hadn't been able to get off. He's quite an
important person in the office nowadays you know."</p>

<p>"Splendid. Perhaps he'll rise to the head of it before he's
done. There's nothing like a steady climb, is there? So much the
most satisfactory way."</p>

<p>Oh, this harping on Harry. And even here, where the air was
thick with heat and food, she dared do no more than loosen a button
at her throat, while she sat and listened to Margaret poke and pry.
An inquisitive old maid, that was what the past three years had
turned <i>her</i> into.</p>

<p>"No children?"</p>

<p>What next! "Good Lord, no! Harry's much too considerate. You've
no <i>idea</i> what an old silly he is about me. When I scolded him
for buying such a coat, all he said was:'It ought to have been
mink'." And with a forced smile over the choke of the collar: "Next
year I'm to have a car. One of the best on the road."</p>

<p>Was she laying it on too thick? (<i>Could</i> her shoes have
been spotted?) Or did she only imagine the dryness, the lack of
acceptance, in Margaret's steady gaze? Anyhow, real or not, the
suspicion was enough to give her pause. In a flurry she snatched up
bag and gloves.</p>

<p>"I think...if you've quite finished? For it looks to me as if
it's going to turn foggy. That's the danger of such fine mornings
at this time of year." (The danger, too, that trains might not run,
and she be forced to take Margaret home with her. Oh,
<i>anything</i> but that! The "charming bungalow", the "spacious
garden".)</p>

<p>Outside, they had to cross the road; and at once there was a
muddle. Still rattled, she stepped off the pavement just as the
lights changed; and Margaret wasn't sharp enough. (You had to be a
Londoner to take chances.) To see what the fool was doing she
turned her head, and a bus chose just that moment to swing round
the corner and come charging down on her. Anything more appalling
than the nearness of this scarlet monster...like a house got loose,
a moving mountain...She had to jump for her life, blindly,
desperately: but jump she did, with a nimbleness that amazed her,
clogged as she was: and the next instant found herself safe on the
opposite pavement. But someone hadn't been so lucky: there was a
hideous shriek, a chorus of grinding brakes, shouts, cries, wildest
confusion. God! where was Margaret? That hat, she would have known
it anywhere. But not a trace, not a speck of its ludicrous
cock's-plume, in the crowd that ran together like fowls after food.
She tried to call out; but no voice came. And even if it <i>was</i>
Margaret, she couldn't go back. Accidents terrified her; the sight
of blood turned her sick. And so, palsied with fear, her heart
pounding fit to split her chest, she stood and watched the traffic
pile up, policemen spring from the earth, the crush thicken,
everyone pushing and shoving to catch a glimpse of what lay in the
road. Then, the bell of an ambulance, which, still walled in by
people, loaded its fearful burden and drove off. Whereupon the
crowd thinned and melted. But still no Margaret beckoned to her or
came over to join her. Finding her voice, she turned to a man who
stood by and asked if he could tell her who had been hurt. But he
didn't seem to hear her. A kind-faced woman, however, gave her an
odd look and a smile in passing, and, without being asked, said
gently: "It's all over. Don't be frightened."</p>

<p>Frightened? Fright was the least of it. For what now?&mdash;now
that, thanks to another's imbecility, she had been landed in this
hole. (Oh, that she had never set eyes on Margaret!) Now, she would
need to go to a policeman, allege faintness, say she missed her
friend; hear to which hospital the ambulance had driven, make her
way there, listen to gruesome details, perhaps even see and
identify the body. Horrible indeed: but it wasn't this that made
her shiver and quake. And, while she put a hand to her jaw, to stop
its chattering, her brain fumbled with thoughts of escape. Nobody
here had known she was to meet Margaret; at this end she was safe.
But down in the country, at Margaret's home, a letter might be
found bearing her name. If she did not come forward she would
probably be broadcast or advertised for...oh God, oh God!</p>

<p>Insensibly, however, she had begun to walk away: to follow, as
if drawn, in the direction of the ambulance. And here she was in
Portland Place. Or so she supposed. For sure enough fog had come
down, filling the eyes, throwing a haze over streets and people,
muffling the tall buildings till you couldn't tell one from
another. Still, she plodded on, in growing bewilderment: the coat
alone remaining true to itself and making a labour of each
step.</p>

<p>A seat!...a seat. She hailed it with a relief that went up like
a prayer of thanks. Never had anything come so opportunely. Alone,
too, and fog-screened, she could at last unbutton the coat. And
this she did, throwing it wide from neck to hem, drinking in deep,
luscious breaths of air; if air it could be called.</p>

<p>But not for long was she alone. A figure took shape in the murk,
and turned to a man, who sat down beside her. She edged away; for
he didn't look much, and she had her fur to think of.</p>

<p>Now, he was actually speaking, asking if she had lost
herself.</p>

<p>Of him she made short work. "Certainly not. I'm just taking a
rest."</p>

<p>"And the fog will gradually lift."</p>

<p>"Let us hope so." She meant to leave it at that, but found
herself adding:'What I <i>have</i> lost is the friend I came out
with."</p>

<p>"Can I help you?"</p>

<p>"You? How, I'd like to know!"</p>

<p>'Well, if you would perhaps remove your coat...</p>

<p>Aha! so that was what he was: a coat thief. She had read of such
things happening under cover of fog. Hurriedly she re-did her
fastenings. If he was after the coat he'd have to take her too. And
she was tall and strong.</p>

<p>But he made no move to attack her. And again some inner urge
forced her to go on speaking.</p>

<p>"The very idea of me sitting here without it! I should be much
too..."&mdash;"bare" was the word that presented itself, but she
choked it back, it sounded so odd, and said "cold" instead, though
she was perspiring freely.</p>

<p>"As you will," said the man. And evidently took the hint; for
when she looked round next he had gone.</p>

<p>Fool, oh, fool, she with her suspicions. After all he might have
known, have been able to tell her what it would be best to do. She
raised her handkerchief to her smarting eyes; and as she lowered it
saw another figure growing as it were out of the mist: a woman this
time, so no cause for alarm. But the be-stringed bonnet, the
antiquated mantle <i>could</i> only belong to a char-woman or some
such person; and again she made to edge away. But was brought up by
the end of the seat. And the new-comer plumped down almost on top
of her.</p>

<p>Thus wedged in she had to listen to the same fatuous
question.</p>

<p>"Can I help you?"</p>

<p>What the hell did they mean by it, all of them? (The next one
that came along she'd be beforehand with.) And her reply was as
crushing as she knew how to make it.</p>

<p>But a glance shot sideways, to see how the creature took the
snubbing, froze the words on her tongue. Round-eyed, open-mouthed,
she wrenched herself loose, to turn, to make sure.</p>

<p>"<i>Mother!</i>&mdash;you? What on earth are <i>you</i> doing
here? In this fog, with your rheumatism? You'll be ill again,
you'll be laid up!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me, my dear. It's you we have to think
of."</p>

<p>Which was Mother to the life. Always ready to belittle herself
and her ailments.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say. But oh, it seems too good to be true. For
you're just the person I need. I'm in such trouble, Mother, such
terrible trouble!" And breathlessly she poured out her tale: the
accident, her own lucky escape, her fears for Margaret, her laming
uncertainty.</p>

<p>Except for a gentle click or two of the tongue, she was listened
to in silence. But when she stopped speaking, in place of the
expected sympathy, the sound, motherly advice, all she heard was:
"But first take off your coat."</p>

<p>And that was like the stab of the drill on an inflamed
nerve.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>curse</i> the coat! Can't you any of you leave it alone?
Besides, I never heard such nonsense. How can I possibly take it
off? I should be much too&mdash;" Again she had to fight an impulse
to say something she didn't want to, or mean.</p>

<p>"You needn't mind being bare before me, little Katie."</p>

<p>There!&mdash;the word was out, and said not by her but
another.</p>

<p>Though staggered, she managed a mocking laugh. "Bare? It sounds
as if I had nothing on underneath. But 'little Katie'&mdash;how
good that sounds! No one has called me Katie
since...<i>since</i>&mdash;" The fraction of a second in which her
heart stood still, and she was on her feet, her balled fists
digging into her cheeks, her eyes wild with fear, all the blood in
her body galloping back to her heart.</p>

<p>"<i>Mother! You</i>? But&mdash;but how can it be? For you're
dead, Mother&mdash;<i>dead</i>!&mdash;and have been for years and
years."</p>

<p>"I will explain."</p>

<p>"Explain? Explain <i>that</i>? Oh Christ, what does it mean? Am
I going mad?" Her legs abruptly failing her, she fell face downward
on the seat, crying and sobbing.</p>

<p>"Quiet, child, quiet. But come now." And by some means or other
the coat was undone, loosened, pulled off her: bringing to light,
in all its meanness, the shabby, out-of-date dress that was her
sole wear. She shivered into herself as though she had been
stripped naked. And yet...rid of the coat's intolerable drag, the
fug of it, the stickiness...Now, she could move, sit up with ease,
turn her head, look about her. For the man had been right; the fog
was lifting, had shrunk to mere whiffs and puffs of mist in the
upper air. But&mdash;this was not Portland Place. No old Lister
with his sideboards, no rows of cars and taxis. Nor houses either:
just a wide, open, desolate space, with a single seat planked down
in the middle of it.</p>

<p>Stupefied she stared round.</p>

<p>"Where am I? What am I doing here?"</p>

<p>"Safe with me, little Katie."</p>

<p>"With you? How can I be?&mdash;Mother! You don't&mdash;you
can't...It was Margaret, I tell you, <i>Margaret</i>, not me! That
bus never touched me, I swear it didn't! Do you think I wouldn't
<i>know</i>?"</p>

<p>Again she was on her feet, went raging up and down, her bunched
hands shaking convulsively, in defiance, in despair.</p>

<p>"I won't, I won't be dead, I tell you, I
<i>won't</i>!&mdash;Besides, it's preposterous, it's insane. Never
have I felt so alive! Oh, there's some awful mistake somewhere.
Why, I've got years and years of life before me: I'm only
thirty-six: I mean to live to be an old, old woman. Oh, do
something, say something! Can't you see I'm going mad?" And
flinging herself on her knees she hid her face in her mother's
lap.</p>

<p>Now, her hat too was off; and she felt the touch of hands on her
hair.</p>

<p>"Talk on, my child. You have many things to say to me."</p>

<p>"You're wrong, I haven't, not one! Except that it's all a
mistake. Or else I'm dreaming. Yes, that's what it is: just a
hideous dream. The shock of seeing Margaret killed was too much for
me. I shall wake up, I know I shall&mdash;I <i>will</i>!&mdash;and
be able to laugh at myself."</p>

<p>In her ears there was now a kind of singing, or humming, which
added to her confusion. (But which was also a proof that she
dreamed.)</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>why</i> couldn't the woman have stopped where she was?
Why did she need to come to London? I never asked her to, I didn't
want her. And this, this is all I get for being kind to her."</p>

<p>"Was kindness your only motive, Katie?"</p>

<p>"What else?" And with a bitter laugh: "Do you think I enjoyed
dragging at her heels like a dog on a lead? Watching her fling
about with pounds as if they were shillings&mdash;<i>I</i>, who am
so poor, so poor? Don't you call that kind?"</p>

<p>To this there was no answer; except from the humming, which
seemed to grow momentarily louder. She shook her head as if to
chase off a winged pest, stopped her ears with her fingers; but
neither helped. To drown it she was compelled to go on
speaking.</p>

<p>"In every single shop we went to, her one thought was, to get
the best of everything. More money than she knew what to do with,
and no one but herself to spend it on. When she bought shoes,
Mother, I had to hide mine under the chair. And so...when the bus
got her and I knew I'd never have to see that smug, self-satisfied
face of hers again&mdash;oh, wasn't it only natural I couldn't feel
sorry? You must understand that, you must, you must!"</p>

<p>Here, the humming rose to a wail, like the whine of a high, thin
wind among the chimney-pots on an autumn night. (A sound that had
always got her down.)</p>

<p>"And you, you're trying to make out it wasn't her but
me&mdash;<i>me</i>! Oh, what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Talk on, my child. Only your mother hears you."</p>

<p>"Haven't I said enough? That I hated her&mdash;yes,
<i>hated</i>!&mdash;and was glad she was run over?" But it seemed
not, for once more she listened in vain for a response. Her face
hardened. "Very well then, if it's not her, if it's me, and I'm
dead, then I'll stop dead. And the dead don't talk."</p>

<p>For these words she paid dear. The whining swelled to a screech,
a chorus of screeches, like the fierce cawing and quacking of a
swarm of rooks about to pounce. Bitterly she rued her bravado;
tried to atone for it by carrying on, in a voice raised to all but
a shout against the din.</p>

<p>"The one single thing I had better than her was my coat. She
couldn't touch <i>that</i>. Oh, how thankful I was I'd worn it!
Though it nearly did for me. You were right, every one of you, when
you told me to take it off. This is the first time today I'm able
to breathe."</p>

<p>"Good, child, good. But go on, make haste."</p>

<p>"Why? What's the hurry?"</p>

<p>But even as she put the question, she too began to feel that
time was flying. To let it escape unused was somehow to court
disaster.</p>

<p>Yet still she fenced and hedged.</p>

<p>"Yes, there&mdash;the coat, I mean&mdash;I had her.
And&mdash;and Harry. For she'd never managed to get a husband;
nobody ever asked <i>her</i> to marry them. She's one of your born
old maids. <i>And</i> envious! When I told her about Harry, how
fond he is of me and the fuss he makes over me, she went green with
envy. But&mdash;Oh, Mother, Mother, what <i>is</i> the awful noise
inside my head? Is this what it means to die? I'm frightened, I'm
frightened. Oh, help me, for you can, you know how, if only you
will!</p>

<p>"No one can help you but yourself, child. But be quick, your
chance is passing."</p>

<p>In the knees she leant on she thought she felt a movement as if
to rise, and panic seized her.</p>

<p>"For God's <i>sake</i>, don't go, don't leave me! alone in this
fog."</p>

<p>For the mist was gathering again; had come as low as the face
above her, blurring its outlines. More: even as she looked these
seemed to change their shape, to be growing fluid. Terror at the
sight broke down her last defences. Taking the other's dress in
both hands, bringing it up round her face for a screen, she began
to speak, so fast, in so little above a whisper that, to any mortal
ear, what now came would have been inaudible.</p>

<p>"Stay with me, only stay, and I'll tell you everything. Oh, I've
been a wicked woman, Mother. I'm a liar and&mdash;and a thief, yes,
rotten through and through. Nothing I told Margaret was true. Harry
never gave me this coat. He never gives me anything. He doesn't
care a hang for me. Nor I for him. I hate him and despise him. I
only took him because there was no one else. And ever since I
married him I've tricked him and done him. The money I got for the
house, I've always kept back part of it. It didn't hurt him, for he
didn't know. He's the sort of man who never knows anything; what he
eats or what things cost. Or sees how shabby I go. And anyhow he
wouldn't care, he's got no pride in <i>him</i>. For months and
months I've been saving up to buy a coat. But it was never enough.
And when I heard Margaret was coming&mdash;<i>she</i> to see what I
had sunk to!&mdash;I couldn't bear it, Mother, I simply
couldn't."</p>

<p>The tears were streaming now, splashing hot on cheeks, hands,
dress.</p>

<p>"And so...I got a bunch of keys at the iron-monger's, and found
one that fitted the drawer where he keeps his money, for rates and
things, and took it and went out and bought this coat. But surely
as much for his sake as mine? That Margaret shouldn't know how
mean, how despicably mean he is? No, wait, stop, that's not true.
But at least I meant to sell it again after she went, and put the
money back. Or didn't I? Oh God, I don't know, don't know any more
what's true and what isn't. Perhaps I meant to keep it&mdash;he's
never at home by day to see what I wear. And it was going to be
quite easy to invent a burglary, turn the rooms upside down, say
the house had been broken into while I was out. But <i>now</i>
he'll open the drawer and find the money gone and see the coat and
know me for what I am&mdash;a common thief. Oh, just one day more,
<i>only</i> one, to put things right! You can do it, you can save
me...<i>mother</i>!"</p>

<p>Humming, wailing, cawing alike had ceased. In her and about her
lay a stillness that was as precious as balm to a wound, or the
sudden lull in a griping, gutting pain. But her joy in it was
short-lived, for now, past question, her mother was making ready to
go. She widened her hold, clung for dear life: but to what? To a
form which, from flesh and blood, was growing intangible as air.
And which, in thinning, was receding, fading back into the mists
from which it had sprung. She staggered up to follow, and, as she
did, caught her foot in the coat, lying on the ground. And some
impulse made her stoop to this, pick it up and drag it after her,
by one sleeve.</p>

<p>Too late. Now, all that remained to her was a voice: so faint,
so far, that it had no more body to it than the echo of an echo,
heard from the high hills.</p>

<p>"I shall be waiting for you...be waiting."</p>

<p>"Tch! I do believe she's coming to," said the nurse in the
Casualty Ward, and threw a troubled glance at the house-surgeon,
who, his job done, had turned aside. "Look!...actually trying to
speak."</p>

<p>With a swab of cotton-wool she wiped the blood and foam from
monstrously distorted lips, all that was now to be seen for
bandages of the dying face and, stooping, put her ear to them.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>"I'm afraid she's gone, your friend," she said a few minutes
later, to the shocked, benumbed woman who kept vigil in the
corridor. "But believe me it's better so. Though we haven't managed
to get hold of her husband yet."</p>

<p>Here she hesitated. And, with an eye to stuff, cut and cost of
the other's clothing, asked a little diffidently: "Is your...are
you by chance'Margaret'? Oh yes? So <i>it was</i> you she was
thinking of. She seemed to be trying to tell you something. It was
all very jumbled and confused, I only got a word here and there.
Something about a coat&mdash;the one she had on when she was
brought in, I suppose&mdash;and a thief. Perhaps she was afraid it
had been stolen. Though," very apologetically, "it did seem once as
if she was calling herself a thief. Still, they often talk nonsense
at the end. Well, sorry I couldn't make much of it. I'm afraid you
won't, either."</p>

<p>But, on coming face to face with the shabby, careworn little
man, of the sloping shoulders and limp, uncertain movements, that
was Harry, Margaret, deeply pitying, believed she understood.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Sister Ann</h2>

<p>"Sister Ann, Sister Ann, do you see anyone coming?"&mdash;from
poor cowering Fatima. And from the watcher on the look-out always
the same monotonous reply: "Naught but the dust that blows before
the wind!"</p>

<p>She was really Edith; but ever since as children they had acted
the <i>Bluebeard</i> play, she had been Ann to them&mdash;Sister
Ann. And the name fitted her like her own skin. For Ann quite
literally spent her life on the watch&mdash;for the next disaster,
she being the only one who might ward it off.</p>

<p>Of late, however, her vigilance had had a double aim.</p>

<p>Without counting her&mdash;and no one ever did, she was so
different&mdash;there were six of them, six girls in a row.
(Brother Stephen the lawyer came after Ann, and little Timothy, who
still rode every day to school, right at the end of the line.)</p>

<p>While they were still young, being so many hadn't troubled them.
But now that they were all but one of them grown up&mdash;and she
fast coming on&mdash;the calamity of their number was self-evident.
"Old O'Grady and his six gals" was the snigger that went the round.
And though it stung, it was bearable. But what if, some day, the
"old" was shifted from Papa, and "maids" took the place of "girls"?
Merely to think of it made their respective bloods run cold, though
at first each thought for herself, for even among sisters a fear of
this magnitude was hard to broach. Time, however, shattered their
delicacy and, nowadays, the likelihood (or unlikelihood) of their
ever finding husbands was openly discussed.</p>

<p>No help was to be expected from Papa. Stephen's training and
setting-up had cost <i>pots</i> of money; and of course the station
didn't pay. When Papa bought it and carried them off from town, it
was on the strength of a rumour that gold had been found there.
Characteristically (and adorably) he had swallowed the yarn,
prospecting, sinking shafts, and so on. But not a trace of the
colour showed; and the poorer by several thousands he had been
forced to turn squatter&mdash;and of squatting he knew no more than
a child. Things had gone from bad to worse with him; and ever since
last winter's floods swept away his three precious bridges over the
river, he seemed finally to have lost heart; and was now oftenest
to be found sitting in the porch, his red beard sunk on his chest,
a glass of rum and milk before him. Always just the least
bit...well, fuzzy...so that if you spoke suddenly to him he had to
look hard at you to make sure which you were.</p>

<p>It was Ann who had taken command: Ann, her skirts pinned up, in
leggings or jack-boots, a battered old straw on her head, who
stumped about from morning till night, seeing after hands, horses,
stock. Her skin was the colour of a well-baked pie-crust, her nose
scaly, her hair always half down. While the sun-wrinkles round the
corners of her eyes were fast running into her cheeks. But Ann
didn't care a threepenny-bit how she looked. Or what she did. When
an infuriated stallion broke loose from his paddock and came
thundering up to the house, it was Ann who intrepidly led him back
and replaced the slip-rail. Or when a new closet was needed, she
went out and superintended the digging of the pit and the
filling-in of the old one.</p>

<p>Not that the rest of them were idle&mdash;Ann wouldn't allow
that; each had her job, and grumbling didn't help. Car, next in age
to Ann, was dressmaker to the family; and a good part of her day
went at the treadle-machine. However, since her chief interest was
dress and the fashions, it didn't come too hard on her. She was
also a dab at cutting and fitting, and wore her own clothes with
such an air that they might have been bought in Paris&mdash;helped,
of course, by a marvellous, simply <i>marvellous</i> figure. Very
tall, with a rich, full bust, Car possessed a waist so tiny that
Gemma's seventeen-inch silver belt spanned it with ease.</p>

<p>The others, having no marked talents, fared worse. Deb toiled,
till her feet throbbed, in the flagstoned dairy, amid great flat
dishes of milk off which she skimmed cream wrinkled like parchment,
and as yellow; or churned butter; or made cheese. Ell had charge of
the fowls, the maddening fowls, for ever straying or laying out of
the nest; and so it went on, down to young Flo, who ought to have
been at boarding-school and wasn't, for lack of funds, and did her
resentful bit by flipping a feather-whisk over surfaces on which
you could have written your name in the gritty, white dust.</p>

<p>The single one of whom nothing was expected or asked was Gemma.
For Gemma was delicate, and unfit for exertion. The beauty of the
family, and Ann's darling, she was free to laze away her days
thinking of her health or her looks; not getting up from the bed
she shared with Ann (which Ann left at unearthly hours) till she
felt inclined to, sometimes only just in time for dinner.</p>

<p>Papa, himself so given to "sitting around", could not tolerate
idleness in others. He was for ever quoting the ant at Gemma, or
making pointed allusions to drones. He had also an Irish impatience
with "side" or vanity. And when poor Gemma, hungry for masculine
admiration, was it only her father's, went up to him one morning
and, with her chin in the air, showed off her newly-scrubbed and
polished teeth, all she got was: "Teeth? Where? I see nothing but
gums." And as he turned away: "My dear, they're not a patch on
Ann's!"&mdash;at which there was a general burst of laughter.
Really it took <i>papa</i> to pretend he preferred Ann's teeth,
large, white, even as these were, to Gemma's small pearls.</p>

<p>But Ann didn't laugh, she was furious.</p>

<p>"The old fool doesn't know what he's saying!"&mdash;And the
horse she was driving came in for a cut over the head.</p>

<p>Once a week she got out the buggy and drove the ten miles to the
neighbouring township, with a load of butter and eggs; or cheese;
or fowls. These articles were her own peculiar perquisites; and she
took no one with her to see what she made by them. The money was
earmarked for a special purpose: to meet the expense of
entertaining the guests she got together whenever possible. Young
men only, of course; and from town, not township. For her sisters'
qualms about their persistent maidenhood were slight compared with
hers; and Papa, who had done the damage by burying his family
alive, was now too inert to remedy it. For all he cared, these six
girls&mdash;of whom even the plainest was comely&mdash;might wither
unseen and unwed. And in a land, too, where women stood at a
premium!</p>

<p>It was ludicrous, it was absurd; and since the poor things' own
hands were tied, she herself had shouldered the job of finding them
husbands. So far, without success. Indeed, everything that could go
wrong had done so. Eligibles were rare, nor was she free to pick
and choose, she had just to take what offered: with the result that
Car, the stately, was philandering with a youth seven years her
junior; Bab's making sheeps-eyes at a totally ineligible, while
Gemma, the victim of a week of full moons and verandah hammocks,
was shedding secret tears over a tall dark handsome fellow who,
they had subsequently learned, was already bespoken. That must not,
<i>must</i> not be.</p>

<p>On this particular day she, Ann, carried a more than usually
heavy load. And the price she meant to ask for her goods was
stiffer. For during the last visit paid them by the "ineligible",
it had leaked out that he knew a wealthy squatter who was still a
bachelor; and straightway he had been half-whipped, half-wheedled
into a promise to bring this unicum with him, the next time he
came. A splash had now to be made, Gemma got up to kill.</p>

<p>On Gemma her hopes were pinned: Gemma who, did she seriously lay
herself out to please, was irresistible.&mdash;Which was one reason
why Papa's aspersions on the girls' looks&mdash;Papa had gone on to
say Gemma was getting fat, very soon she'd be able to boast a
double chin (at twenty-five!)&mdash;had bitten so deep. For after
all Papa was a man, and judged women with a man's eye. But there
was more in it than this. The love Ann bore her younger sister had
in the course of time grown to be a kind of passion; and it was
with something of a mother's savagery that she thought of dimples
running to lines, lovely lips thinning, the exquisite oval of the
face losing its shape.&mdash;And as she bumped down and up the bed
of a dry creek, breathed dust for air, fought the flies, she felt
that she would cheerfully have given years of her own life to keep
Gemma as she was.</p>

<p>He was short, thick-set, sandy-haired&mdash;such hair as
remained to him, it wasn't much&mdash;with pale, rather prominent
blue eyes, which fled did they chance to meet yours, seeming to
rest by preference on inanimate objects. Socially, too, he was a
dead weight. He either sat mum, or barked out short, staccato
sentences: the "and that's that!" style of thing which effectually
put a stopper on conversation. And his name was MacNab.</p>

<p>Gemma's recoil was instant and instinctive (poor lamb, poor
sacrificial lamb!). But feeling Ann's eyes glued sternly on her,
she did her best, her <i>level</i> best, in the hour that followed.
Her prettiest, too; making full play with her thickly-fringed lids
and what was known among them as: her "Ellen Terry" mouth. She had
him all to herself. Ann soon winked and grimaced and accompanied
Papa from the room; Babe and the "ineligible" had been bundled off
to gather mushrooms; while the remaining sisters&mdash;for fear of
alarming by their numbers they had not been produced&mdash;kept
religiously to the back of the house.</p>

<p>But "Gemma, what are you doing here?" from a dismayed Ann when,
entering the bedroom, she found Gemma sitting limply on the side of
the bed. "Where is he, child? What have you done with him?"</p>

<p>"<i>Done</i>? It's not me, it's Papa. He came back. And then he
went over to talk to him," flamed Gemma, confusing her pronouns in
her haste. "He <i>can</i> talk, too, if he wants to. He's not so
dumb as he makes out to be."</p>

<p>"You silly child, it's only shyness. He's not used to a pretty
woman's company. I saw that at a glance. Come now, darling," and
Ann held outspread the dress, cut low in the neck, and sleeveless,
to show the dimpled arms, in which Gemma should have continued her
work of enchantment.</p>

<p>But the girl's lips were trembling, and she pushed the dress
away.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>not</i> going to wear that thing. Oh, it's no use, Ann,
I can't&mdash;I couldn't <i>ever</i> like him."</p>

<p>But Ann was obdurate. Petting and cajoling, she hooked and
buttoned, and straightened the mass of chestnut hair. Then, taking
firm hold of Gemma's arm, led the unwilling victim back to the
forsaken guest.&mdash;"Or what will he think of you?"</p>

<p>But he wasn't thinking anything. Fortunately (or unfortunately)
he seemed to be getting on quite well with Papa. At least, there
the two of them sat pow-wowing, their glasses before them.
Unfortunately again, and thanks to her own misguided caution, today
that old fool Papa had all his wits about him, not a drop of liquor
having crossed his lips till now. And when sober he was no fool.
Even she saw how impossible it was for Gemma to chip in&mdash;on a
talk moreover that turned entirely on sheep! And having stood for a
moment, hat in hand as it were, Gemma gave her a flaming,
what-did-I-tell-you look, and stalked out of the room.</p>

<p>At supper it was the same. Though she sat next him, he didn't
even trouble to hand her the salt (after helping himself), but went
on speaking to Papa across her. It was plain the man hadn't an idea
in his head except business, and of business Gemma, alas! knew
nothing. Her one effort, made in obedience to Ann's fierce eyes,
merely exposed her ignorance. To cover it, Ann sprang in with a
remark on the existing wool prices (about which she knew
considerably more than Papa). And this led to a rather heated
argument, in which she found herself siding with MacNab against
Papa; for in all the former said there was a good deal of rough
horse-sense.</p>

<p>That night (after giving Papa a wigging he wouldn't forget) she
took the resentful girl in her arms and spoke long and earnestly.
It wasn't only herself Gemma had to think of, it was everyone of
them. Papa was literally on the rocks for money: if he couldn't
contrive to get a loan the station might be sold over his head. In
which case her sisters would have to turn out, go as governesses or
even worse. It lay with Gemma to prevent this. As a married woman,
with a substantial settlement and in a good position, she could
give these unfortunates their chance: take them about with her,
introduce them to the right people, see that they met likely men.
About herself she, Ann, wouldn't speak: except to say she didn't
know how much longer she'd be able to go on working as she did. She
was nearing forty; and the most trying years of a woman's life were
at hand.</p>

<p>Gemma's tears ran down her cheeks, trickling off her nose.</p>

<p>"I know, I know <i>all</i> that," she sobbed. "But, oh Ann, it's
so...so humiliating. Besides, I've got <i>some</i> feelings of my
own."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I know what they are, too, and why you're not putting
your heart into this affair. It's because you can't or won't forget
all that moonshine about young Spencer.''</p>

<p>"It's <i>not</i> moonshine. He said...Howard said..."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear. Nothing will alter <i>my</i> opinion of
him. Now, darling, just you listen to me."&mdash;And patiently Ann
set herself to begin again from the beginning.</p>

<p>She had the satisfaction next morning of seeing the pair go off
together, Gemma having been cajoled into showing the visitor round.
Never had Gem looked prettier: in a rose-besprinkled print, rose on
white, a sort of Dolly Varden hat tied under her chin with
rose-velvet strings. But from her spy-hole Ann was concerned to see
him halt at the pig-sties; and not for a moment only: they
continued to stand there in the sun, leaning over the wall.
(Gemma!...who never went within coo-ee of the pigs without a
handkerchief to her nose.) As was only to be expected, when at last
they moved it was to make a bee-line back to the house, Gem feeling
ill and needing to lie down. Not too ill though to say what she
thought of him.</p>

<p>Ann clicked her tongue, and went away to scratch her head and
ponder. The thing was plain: her schemes for Gemma's benefit were
not coming off. Nor was it <i>only</i> Gemma's fault: the man
seemed as little taken with her as she with him. Could it be that
she was not his "style"? Himself so short and stumpy, might he not
perhaps incline to women of more regal proportions? In that case,
there was no lack of choice to hand. What about Car, Car, the tall
and willowy, the superbly busted? The experiment was at least worth
trying. And so Car was commanded to appear at dinner, introduced as
if she had just come home. But it didn't work. For all the
attention he paid her she might have been a broomstick. He had
evidently no more eye for a fine figure than for a pretty face.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Car having frostily withdrawn to make merry over
him with the hidden sisters, Papa bottle-free and normally sodden,
Gemma declining to get off her bed; that afternoon there was
nothing for it, Ann saw, but herself to take him on. <i>She</i> had
no feminine shrinking from sties; it didn't matter to her how long
she stood over them, breathing in the odour of pig. No, <i>her</i>
difficulty was to keep from smiling when she heard him say: "As I
was telling your sister..." (Poor little Gemma!)</p>

<p>But soon she forgot to smile. For the man knew what he was
talking about, having, it seemed, worked out the precise amount of
artificial food required, in addition to household swill, to bring
a pig to its prime. If what he said was true, she had been putting
herself to unnecessary expense. The chance of saving so-and-so many
shillings per week was too good to miss; and she asked methodical
questions on weights and measurements.</p>

<p>The horses visited&mdash;there wasn't much about horse-flesh
either he didn't know&mdash;she got into her breeches and rode with
him to an outlying paddock where the hands were ring-barking. Here
again she grew interested in spite of herself. For though, as one
of them, he admitted the sheep-farmers' need for pasture, ever more
pasture, he sighed over the havoc that was being wrought to attain
it. Besides, it cut both ways. No grass without moisture; and the
countries with abundant rainfalls were those that were richest in
forests. How shortsighted then, to strip of its trees a land
already so poor in rain! The present generation might wilfully shut
its eyes to the folly of it; those to come would have theirs
opened, and be the sufferers.</p>

<p>He loved trees, too, it seemed, for their own sake.</p>

<p>With a hand on the trunk of one they stood by, he said: "It goes
to my heart to see a mighty specimen like this doomed to a
lingering death."</p>

<p>Yes, he certainly gave one something to think about.&mdash;And
that night Gemma was left in peace.</p>

<p>The following day the two of them went out together almost as a
matter of course. ("Ann's Old Man of the Sea!" tittered the
sisters.) And this time it was Ann who did most of the talking. As
they climbed a boulder-strewn hill, their bridles over their arms,
she found herself confessing to the struggle it was to keep the
place going, bemoaned her own inexperience, Papa's fatal lassitude.
And in doing so let slip, for the first time, the family's full
size. He listened attentively and sympathetically; and in return
gave her various useful tips how to cut down expenses and improve
her control; for he, too, it now transpired, had once been poor,
suffered hardship.</p>

<p>And so it went on. They walked, rode, talked together, for each
of the five days he stayed with them.</p>

<p>On the last morning&mdash;he was travelling by the next day's
coach&mdash;he turned to her, and abruptly, without a word of
preamble, asked her to marry him.</p>

<p>They stood by one of Papa's make-shift bridges, which the
oftener she saw them the surer Ann felt would be demolished by the
first spring flood. Her thoughts were with her eyes, and she didn't
grasp what he was saying till after she had been idiot enough to
ask him to repeat it. Red to the ears with embarrassment and in a
daze at what she heard, before she could stop herself she had
blurted out: "<i>Me</i>? Marry <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>It sounded terrible, cutting to a degree; and so, apparently, he
took it, going even redder than she was, and saying equally
bluntly: "I see. That settles it then."</p>

<p>"Oh no, it doesn't," spluttered Ann.&mdash;But this was even
worse, for he might misconstrue it, and she rushed on: "That is...I
mean...Of <i>course</i> I can't marry you. But...but it's very nice
of you to ask me."</p>

<p>Recovering from the snub he ventured: "But why not? What are
your reasons?"</p>

<p>"<i>Reasons</i>? Why, I've never even thought of
marrying&mdash;never! How could I? Desert all these poor
things?...who depend on me for everything? Impossible!"</p>

<p>He ignored the family's claims on her. "Nor had I. Till I met
you, Ann."</p>

<p>"Look here, I'm forty next birthday!"</p>

<p>"And I'm forty-five."</p>

<p>"That's different. No, please don't go on. It's not a bit of
use."</p>

<p>"Then it's definitely 'no'?"</p>

<p>"Quite, quite definitely."</p>

<p>They made their way home in silence. Not till considerably later
did Ann reflect that, of all the reasons she had urged on Gemma for
marrying, not one had occurred to her.</p>

<p>The pair's reappearance, before the morning was half over,
struck the sisters as odd, very odd. Car and Gemma also reported on
Ann's extraordinary dumbness at dinner, and the clapping on of her
hat directly after, MacNab being left to make the best of it with
Papa. Could they have quarrelled? Or had Ann at last had enough of
him?</p>

<p>Gemma was deputed to find out.</p>

<p>Ann was plaiting her hair for the night. She had taken off her
bodice for comfort and stood in her corset, arms and shoulders
bare, running her fingers nimbly down the first of the two long
thick ropes that fell to below her waist. None of them had hair
like Ann's&mdash;they, who would have known what to do with it!
Whereas she just bundled it up anyhow&mdash;being of course long
past vanity.</p>

<p>But one tail was finished, the other begun, it was now or never,
for, once in bed, Ann went straight to sleep.</p>

<p>Gemma cleared her throat&mdash;she didn't much fancy the job,
for Ann wasn't the sort of person you pumped&mdash;and her first
words came a little tentatively. "I say, Ann, what's up? Between
you and the octopus, I mean."</p>

<p>For a second Ann's busy fingers stopped their braiding.
"<i>Up</i>?" she echoed. "I don't know what you're talking
about."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you do," persuaded Gemma. "Why, at dinner anyone could
see something was wrong; you hardly opened your mouth. And going
off by your self like that afterwards."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Come, don't sit there half-undressed. I'm nearly
ready."</p>

<p>"Oh, get on, Ann, you can't deceive me. Have the two of you had
a row?"</p>

<p>"Mind your own business."</p>

<p>"I think it is mine!" said Gemma with some spirit. "Wasn't he
brought here in the first place solely on my account?"</p>

<p>"I daresay."</p>

<p>"You daresay?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ah</i>! you should have played your cards better, my
dear."</p>

<p>The covert sneer galled Gemma, and she retorted hotly: "I like
that! Played my cards indeed! Who with! That dry old stick?&mdash;a
person who's got no more guts in him than a ventriloquist's
dummy?"</p>

<p>"Now it's you who don't know what you're talking about."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't I?"</p>

<p>"One might even say <i>you</i> were the dummy. And consequently
failed to interest him."</p>

<p>"While you <i>have</i>, I suppose? No, really, Ann!" and Gemma
broke into a low, but very offensive laugh.</p>

<p>Ann paused in the shedding of her clothing and glanced sharply
up.</p>

<p>"My good girl, if I chose, I could make you laugh on the wrong
side of your mouth. As it is...Now stop your silly chatter and get
to bed."</p>

<p>"Silly chatter! But that's you all over. You never give anybody
credit for an ounce of brains but yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, brains I'm afraid you must allow me. But attractions and
so on, none worth mentioning, eh?"</p>

<p>"Naturally not. At your age!"</p>

<p>"Oh-o! Well it may amuse you still more to hear that everyone
isn't of the same opinion&mdash;I have had a proposal."</p>

<p>"You <i>what</i>?" exploded Gemma, shooting up from her seat at
the bedside. But there it remained. Relapsing, she just sat and
stared at her sister, open-mouthed, incredulous. And Ann had peeled
off both stockings and hung them up to air before Gemma came to
sufficiently to put the natural but superfluous question: "Who
from?"</p>

<p>"Who do you think?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say...want to tell me that man's asked you to
marry him? <i>You</i>!"</p>

<p>The tone bit. Ann flushed. "And why not? I'm neither a
chimpanzee, I suppose, nor do I yet hobble about on sticks!"</p>

<p>But Gemma could only sit and mutter to herself. "Well, I'm
<i>damned</i>! <i>Damned</i>, that's what I am!" Ann had poised her
long white nightgown above her head and wriggled into it before
Gemma asked faintly: "And...and what did you say?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind," said Ann. "That's my business." And puffing
out the candle she got into bed and pulled the sheet up over her
head.&mdash;Gemma had to finish undressing in the dark.</p>

<p>She couldn't sleep. And as soon as Ann's breaths began to come
heavily and regularly, she sidled out and padded barefoot to the
room where Car and Deb lay.</p>

<p>"Girls, wake up!" she hissed. "Hush! don't make a noise," for
Car, a light sleeper, was at once on the spot. "But I simply must
tell you. That...that creature has asked Ann to marry him!"</p>

<p>"<i>Ann</i>? <i>Ann</i>, do you say? Good <i>God</i>!" from Car,
sitting bolt upright.</p>

<p>"That's just what I said. And wasn't she in a paddy!"</p>

<p>Here Deb raised herself on one elbow. "Does she mean to take
him?"</p>

<p>"How do I know? She's huffed, and wouldn't say."</p>

<p>"<i>Well</i>...of all the&mdash;God, what a scream!" And Car
laughed so immoderately that she had to retire under the
bed-clothes.</p>

<p>"What the dickens 'll happen if she does?"</p>

<p>"Lord knows!"</p>

<p>"Well, he mayn't, but I do," said Deb. "If Ann goes, I'll never
set foot in the darned old dairy again!"</p>

<p>On coming in next morning from her early round, Ann was
confronted by a battery of eyes: eyes big and bold with curiosity,
or stealing furtive peeps from under their lids, but all alike
greedy for information. Better just take the bull by the horns and
be done with it.</p>

<p>Summoning the six to the bedroom and firmly closing the door,
she turned to them and, in what was privately known as her
"public-speaker" voice, "addressed the meeting".</p>

<p>"I see Gemma has told you. And I suppose it had to come out.
Though I didn't intend it till later...after the person concerned
had gone."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Then he <i>is</i> going?"</p>

<p>"Of course he is."</p>

<p>"So you refused him?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did!" said Ann again, this time with considerable
emphasis, and a sharp glance round. (Was it fancy, or <i>did</i>
she surprise a queer expression on more than one of these prying
faces?)</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" ventured Car.</p>

<p>"But why?" Deb asked outright.</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i>?" echoed Ann, seemingly unable to believe her ears.
"Well, of all the idiotical questions...Are you daft? What in the
name of fortune do you suppose would become of this
place&mdash;Papa and the whole lot of you?&mdash;if I weren't here
to look after things?"&mdash;To which, naturally, there was and
could be no reply.</p>

<p>But, though tongues were held, the silence was an uneasy one.
And presently it was broken by Gemma, the privileged, who murmured
as if to herself. "When I think of the dozens of reasons for taking
him that were rammed down <i>my</i> throat!"</p>

<p>At this Ann opened her eyes, opened them very wide indeed.
"What's that got to do with me? You're surely not trying to compare
us, are you?"</p>

<p>"Lord forbid! I hope I know my place. Still, <i>some</i> people
might say what's sauce for the goose can also be sauce for the
ganderess."</p>

<p>"Don't be impertinent."</p>

<p>"Impertinent? just because for once I venture to say what I
think?"</p>

<p>"I've no wish to hear it."</p>

<p>"Of course not! You never want to hear anybody but yourself.
Only what you think or say or do matters. You must always be cock
of the walk."</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" said Ann in a low descending scale, and with
an appreciatory nod to each word. "So <i>that</i>'S your opinion of
me, is it? That's your thanks for all I've done for you? Cock of
the walk!" And swinging round on her heel, to get the whole pack
under her eye: "Are any of you labouring under the delusion that I
enjoy being forced to slave as I do? To toil from morning till
night solely to keep the place together and a roof over your heads?
That I wouldn't rather have had a life of my own&mdash;like any
other woman? If so, you're even greater numb-skulls than I thought!
Fools&mdash;who ought to be thanking God on your knees that I saw
where my duty lay. Without me to look after you, you'd all end in
the gutter!"</p>

<p>"Gutter or no gutter, I'd be jolly glad <i>not</i> to be looked
after for a bit," from Deb, who sat with her feet on a chair.</p>

<p>Ann laughed contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Well do I know it! If I weren't here you'd every one of you be
lolling round&mdash;just like Papa. Eternally resting from
something you hadn't done!"</p>

<p>"What we'd like is a rest from <i>your</i> eternal bullying and
badgering&mdash;<i>in</i>cluding the dairy!"</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> the sewing-machine!"</p>

<p>"And those beasts of fowls!"</p>

<p>And dusting rooms and working in the kitchen, said the eyes of
the two youngest, whose tongues lacked the courage to speak
out.</p>

<p>This time the pause that followed had something ominous in it.
No one, nothing stirred: except Ann's eyes, which travelled cold as
ice from one to other of the rebel faces.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word!&mdash;And may I ask if that's all? Are
there any more insults, any more names you'd like to call me? I may
as well know exactly where I stand."</p>

<p>'It's <i>in</i> you, I suppose, to make slaves of people."</p>

<p>"Or it's grown on you. I don't believe you <i>could</i> stop
now, even if you tried."</p>

<p>"Papa says so, too."</p>

<p>"Says you won't even let us call our souls our own."</p>

<p>Ann's cheeks burnt a brick-red.</p>

<p>"Oh, he does, does he? So Papa's in it too, is he? Well, that
makes it <i>quite</i> plain&mdash;plain as my nose&mdash;what's at
the bottom of all this. It's just the dirty Irish blood in you
coming out!"</p>

<p>"You've got it, too!"</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I have!" And with a shattering bang of the door,
Ann flung not only from the room but the house.</p>

<p>At breakfast her chair stood empty.&mdash;And an uncomfortable
meal it was. Papa asking fatuous questions, where she could be,
what doing; MacNab sitting stolid as a lump of wood; themselves
suffering from a severe attack of cold feet as the aftermath of
their daring.</p>

<p>By this time Ann was miles away, having walked her hardest and
without a stop, to put distance between herself and the
house&mdash;the house that held them. In all her life she'd never
been so angry, felt so outraged. And fresh spasms of wrath kept
gripping her at each fresh memory of the things she had had to
listen to. How dare they, how <i>dare</i> they! The ingratitude,
the vile ingratitude, of their conduct was bad enough, but ten
times worse the impudence of it. These underlings&mdash;creatures
who had sat at her feet, eaten out of her hand ever since the
youngest of them came into the world. Whom she had washed and
dressed and dosed and punished. To whom her lightest word had been
law. Why, it was just as if a flock of tame domestic animals should
suddenly go berserk and tear the hand that fed them.&mdash;But
she'd make them pay! A bully, was she?...a slave-driver? Well, from
now on they should learn the real meaning of these words. No more
excusing, no more favouritism; all alike should work the clock
round; Deb, the ring-leader, answer for every ounce of butter she
failed to produce, Gemma be hauled out of bed at her, Ann's, own
hours.&mdash;And as she plunged forward, over stick and stone, her
lips curled with malice at the separate forms of revenge devised
for each single sister.</p>

<p>But, little by little, pace and distance told; and hurt got the
better of anger. For the wound to her self-love had been a cruel
one. Her own picture of herself&mdash;the pleasing, private image
nursed by each of us&mdash;was that of a superior being: able
business-woman, expert manager, sole brains and hence rightful head
of the family, looked up to in admiration by every one who came in
contact with her&mdash;and especially by her sisters, for the
masterly manner in which, Papa having failed them, she had leapt to
the rescue. Whereas it now turned out that they had given her as
small credit as thanks for the feat. Instead of prizing her,
priding themselves on having her, they had all the time been
secretly resenting her authority, thinking mean, underhand things
of her, poking fun at her behind her back. The sting of it, the
humiliation, was so harsh a mouthful that, like an overdose of
mustard, it brought tears hot as mustard to her eyes.</p>

<p>MacNab waylaid her trudging home, grim of face.</p>

<p>He attached himself to her, turned back with her, remarking as
he did: "I noticed you weren't at breakfast, Miss Ann."</p>

<p>These harmless words gave Ann just the peg she needed. She
laughed loudly and sarcastically.</p>

<p>"You don't say so. Now fancy that!"</p>

<p>He winced, and made an apologetic sound. "Is...er...is anything
the matter?"</p>

<p>Her only answer was to quicken her steps, in an attempt to shake
him off.</p>

<p>"I wondered...merely wondered...if <i>I</i> could be of any
use?"</p>

<p>"When I need help I'll ask for it."</p>

<p>"Miss Ann&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake, hold your tongue and let me be!" And with
that her face wrinkled and contracted, she began to cry in earnest.
(Devil take the man, with his poking and prying.)</p>

<p>Undeterred, he kept on at her side, suiting his pace to hers,
now quick, now slow.</p>

<p>Till she rounded on him: "If you can't take a hint...if you must
know...well, today I've made the pleasurable discovery what my
sisters really think of me...and feel about me."</p>

<p>If she thought to surprise him she was mistaken.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said unmoved. Adding in the next breath: "I saw that
from the first."</p>

<p>In her own surprise, Ann lowered her handkerchief to exclaim:
"<i>You</i>? How?"</p>

<p>"Oh, one has one's ways. One's not as big a fool as one
looks."</p>

<p>"You're no fool," she said warmly. "It's me. I'm the fool and
always have been. Blind as a bat. Hugging the belief that they
needed me, and...were glad of me. When all they want is to get rid
of me, to be left to their own devices."</p>

<p>"And don't you think it might perhaps be quite a good thing, for
them?" A question so inept, so inane, that it did not seem to Ann
worth answering.</p>

<p>However she raised no objection when, on coming to the pigsties,
he seemed to wish to pause there. For, with her face in the state
it was, she couldn't show herself at the house. Rigorously she
mopped her eyes, wiped her cheeks, blew a resounding peal on her
nose.</p>

<p>He gave her time, himself standing in an easy attitude, his arms
crossed on the top rung of the gate, one foot on the lowest,
looking down as if absorbed in the tumbling mass of piglets. But
when she ceased to sniff and had put her handkerchief away, he
turned.</p>

<p>"There's something I'd like to say to you, Miss Ann, and I do
hope you won't take it amiss. First, I'm exceedingly sorry for what
has happened&mdash;in a way I'm afraid I've been the innocent cause
of it&mdash;and sorrier still for the pain it has given you. But
it's like this...or at least this is how I look at it," he
corrected himself. "Your sisters&mdash;these very charming young
ladies&mdash;are all grown women now and you...well, of course one
sees how hard it must be for you to realise it, who have had them
in your care since they were children. But don't you think you are
perhaps holding the reins a little too tight? Keeping the curb on a
little overlong?"</p>

<p>"But, but&mdash;" spluttered Ann, incensed anew by this
busy-body interference.</p>

<p>He raised his hand. "I think I know what you're going to say.
That if you did not treat them as you do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort! If every one of them didn't pull her
weight, take a fair share of the work&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again he broke in. "Where would you be, eh? Or, rather, where
would they be? To which my answer is: very much poorer no doubt,
but also very much happier. As happy as you are."</p>

<p>"<i>Me</i>? I, happy?"</p>

<p>"Why certainly. Though you won't admit it. Believe me, Miss Ann,
you're one of the born workers, belonging by nature and bent to the
busy bees of this world. Were you forced to sit idle, you would
droop and pine. But every mortal has his own idea of happiness, and
yours is plainly not theirs. Now why not leave them to themselves
for a bit? Give them a taste of freedom? Frankly I don't think you
would regret it. They'd soon find their feet."</p>

<p>"Not if <i>I</i> know them."</p>

<p>"You're too hard on them."</p>

<p>Ann was pale with anger.</p>

<p>"Does this mean you're siding with them? Standing up for
<i>them</i>&mdash;against me? I've never heard anything so unfair!
Or such nonsense either! All this twaddle about happiness. Why,
Papa would go smash in six months and they'd be dragged down with
him! You've seen for yourself what he is."</p>

<p>He nodded. "But I've seen something else, too. That <i>you</i>
have washed your hands of him! He at least is free to follow his
'own devices'."</p>

<p>"I think you're a thoroughly unprincipled person.
Happy&mdash;and bankrupt!"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. If I could only persuade you, Miss Ann, to
give my plan a trial, I'd see to it that your father got a
substantial loan."</p>

<p>"A loan? A loan to Papa? Oh no you <i>don't</i>!"&mdash;as
crushingly as if he were out to borrow rather than lend. "Why, you
might just as well pour your money down the sink! You'd never see a
penny of it again."</p>

<p>"I called it a loan but...Come, come, Ann, be reasonable, show
yourself the sensible woman you are, and&mdash;and change your
mind."</p>

<p>For a moment she could do no more than echo his last words.
Then, however, their full significance dawned on her. "Look
here&mdash;is this an attempt to buy me off?" she plumped out, at
the same time rounding on him with a look that was meant to kill.
But it failed. For the small, pale eyes that met hers were so full
of kindliness, of understanding, and, yes, of a sort of mischievous
twinkle, that she hurriedly dropped her own. And even felt
something of a fool for her heroics. So <i>he</i> didn't take her
seriously either. Like the rest of them had probably all along been
smirking behind his hand at her expense. This discovery ought to
have been equally mortifying, but, strange to say, it wasn't. And
as she stood there, fumbly and unsure, she became conscious that
offence and anger alike were petering out. The goodwill that shone
from these eyes, after what she had gone through that morning, was
so grateful that it had a queer effect on her, making her feel soft
and silly. If he didn't stop looking at her like this, she'd end by
having to fish for her handkerchief again.</p>

<p>"Oh, the whole thing's so absurd...so utterly absurd," she
mumbled, with a hearty sniff to relieve her need.</p>

<p>"On the contrary it's the most sensible
proposition&mdash;business proposition&mdash;I've ever made. To
anyone."</p>

<p>"A business proposition? That I should desert them, leave them
in the lurch. Let Gemma&mdash;<i>Gemma</i>!&mdash;make what hash
she likes of her life?"</p>

<p>"But, my dear woman, it's her life. You can't live it for her.
And she's quite old enough to know what she wants. Now just you let
them choose their own sweethearts"&mdash;this with so much meaning
that Ann squirmed. "A beauty like Miss Gemma" (so he had thought
her pretty, had he? It sounded almost funny now) "will never lack
suitors. No doubt she already has a favourite up her sleeve."</p>

<p>"Oh, is there anything you <i>don't</i> know?" sighed Ann in
despair. "I declare you're enough to provoke a saint."</p>

<p>But he felt her weakening, and steadily pressed his advantage
home. Until she found herself reduced to the flimsy objection: "But
how can you be sure I shouldn't bully and slave-drive you,
too?"</p>

<p>"No chance of that, my dear, between people who're labouring for
the same end. And to whom work's a sort of gospel. Your sisters
now, you'll never feel safe or happy with them again. A scene like
this morning's&mdash;from which if I mistake not you're
quoting&mdash;will always stand between you.&mdash;See here, Ann:
the very first time I saw you I said to myself, there's the woman
I've been looking for, that's the wife for me!" And covering with
his the hand that lay on the wall, he fell to in earnest to raze
her last defences.</p>

<p>Round the spyhole from which, a few days previously, Ann had
stalked him and Gemma, were congregated the sisters, armed with an
old field-glass through which, by turns, they followed the couple's
every movement.</p>

<p>Minute by minute the excitement grew.</p>

<p>"<i>Lordy</i>! He's put his arm round her shoulders."</p>

<p>"Oh, let me see!"</p>

<p>"No, me! I'm next."</p>

<p>"Heavens! I do believe she's going to take him," from Car,
holding tight to the glasses and warding off the pushful with her
elbows.</p>

<p>"I believe she <i>has</i> taken him," said Deb solemnly, after a
further prolonged scrutiny, and freed her eyes to drink in the
effect of her announcement on the staggered group.</p>

<p>But not for long were they mum. And amid the self-congratulatory
hugs, the hoorays and polka-steps in which they let off their
feelings, Gemma's absence was noticed.</p>

<p>"Gem! I say Gem, where <i>are</i> you? Oh, come here, do! You're
missing all the fun."</p>

<p>But Gemma did not budge. Stretched in a hammock, her hands
clasped behind her head, her eyes fixed and distant, she was
already deep in her own problem. How, without loss of dignity, to
lure back the tall dark handsome lover so boorishly shown the door
by Sister Ann.</p>
