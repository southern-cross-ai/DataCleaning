<h2><a name="C00">A SILENT WOOING</a></h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The first of February, 1924, Jon Forsyte, convalescing from the
'flu, was sitting in the lounge of an hotel at Camden, South
Carolina, with his bright hair slowly rising on his scalp. He was
reading about a lynching.</p>

<p>A voice behind him said:</p>

<p>"Will you join our picnic over at those old-time mounds
to-day?"</p>

<p>Looking up, he saw a young acquaintance called Francis Wilmot, who
came from further south.</p>

<p>"Very glad to. Who's going?"</p>

<p>"Why, just Mr. and Mrs. Pulmore Hurrison, and that English
novelist, Gurdon Minho, and the Blair girls and their friends, and my
sister Anne and I. You could ride over horseback, if you want
exercise."</p>

<p>"All right; they've got some new horses in this morning from
Columbia."</p>

<p>"Why, that's fine! My sister and I'll ride horseback too, and some
of the Blair girls. The Hurrisons can take the others."</p>

<p>"I say," said Jon, "this is a pretty bad case of lynching."</p>

<p>The young man to whom he spoke leaned in the window. Jon admired
his face, as of ivory, with dark hair and eyes, and narrow nose and
lips, and his lissom attitude.</p>

<p>"All you Britishers go off the deep-end when you read of a
lynching. You haven't got the negro problem up where you are at
Southern Pines. They don't have it any to speak of in North
Carolina."</p>

<p>"No, and I don't profess to understand it. But I can't see why
negroes shouldn't be tried the same as white men. There may be cases
where you've got to shoot at sight; but how can you defend mob law?
Once you catch a man, he ought to be tried properly."</p>

<p>"We're not taking any chances with that particular kind of
trouble."</p>

<p>"But without trial, how can you tell he's guilty?"</p>

<p>"Well, we'd sooner do without an innocent darkie now and again
than risk our women."</p>

<p>"But killing a man for a thing he hasn't done is the limit."</p>

<p>"Maybe, in Europe. But, here, things are in the large, still."</p>

<p>"What do they think about lynching in the north?"</p>

<p>"They squeal a bit, but they've no call to. If we've got negroes,
they've got the Reds, and they surely have a wholesale way with
them."</p>

<p>Jon Forsyte tilted back his rocking-chair, with a puzzled
frown.</p>

<p>"I reckon there's too much space left in this country," said
Francis Wilmot; "a man has all the chances to get off. So where we
feel strong about a thing, we take the law into our own hands."</p>

<p>"Well, every country to its own fashions. What are these mounds
we're going to?"</p>

<p>"Old Indian remains that go way back thousands of years, they say.
You haven't met my sister? She only came last night."</p>

<p>"No. What time do we start?"</p>

<p>"Noon; it's about an hour's ride by the woods."</p>

<p>At noon then, in riding kit, Jon came out to the five horses, for
more than one of the Blair girls had elected to ride. He started
between them, Francis Wilmot going ahead with his sister.</p>

<p>The Blair girls were young and pretty with a medium-coloured,
short-faced, well-complexioned, American prettiness, of a type to
which he had become accustomed during the two and a half years he had
spent in the United States. They were at first extremely silent, and
then extremely vocal. They rode astride, and very well. Jon learned
that they, as well as the givers of the picnic, Mr. and Mrs. Pulmore
Hurrison, inhabited Long Island. They asked him many questions about
England, to which Jon, who had left it at the age of nineteen,
invented many answers. He began to look longingly between his horse's
ears at Francis Wilmot and his sister, cantering ahead in a silence
that, from a distance, seemed extremely restful. Their way led
through pine woods--of trees spindly and sparse, and over a rather
sandy soil; the sunlight was clear and warm, the air still crisp. Jon
rode a single-footing bay horse, and felt as one feels on the first
day of recovered health.</p>

<p>The Blair girls wished to know what he thought of the English
novelist--they were dying to see a real highbrow. Jon had only read
one of his books, and of the characters therein could only remember a
cat. The Blair girls had read none; but they had heard that his cats
were "just too cunning."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot, reining up in front, pointed at a large mound
which certainly seemed to be unnaturally formed. They all reined up,
looked at it for two minutes in silence, remarked that it was "very
interesting," and rode on. In a hollow the occupants of two cars were
disembarking food. Jon led the horses away to tether them alongside
the horses of Wilmot and his sister.</p>

<p>"My sister," said Francis Wilmot.</p>

<p>"Mr. Forsyte," said the sister.</p>

<p>She looked at Jon, and Jon looked at her. She was slim but
distinctly firm, in a long dark-brown coat and breeches and boots;
her hair was bobbed and dark under a soft brown felt hat. Her face
was pale, rather browned, and had a sort of restrained eagerness--the
brow broad and clear, the nose straight and slightly sudden, the
mouth unreddened, rather wide and pretty. But what struck Jon were
her eyes, which were exactly his idea of a water nymph's. They
slanted a little, and were steady and brown and enticing; whether
there was ever such a slight squint in them he could not tell, but if
there were it was an improvement. He felt shy. Neither of them
spoke.</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot reckoned that he was hungry, and they walked side
by side towards the eatables.</p>

<p>Jon said suddenly to the sister:</p>

<p>"You've just come then, Miss Wilmot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Forsyte."</p>

<p>"Where from?"</p>

<p>"From Naseby. It's way down between Charleston and Savannah."</p>

<p>"Oh, Charleston! I liked Charleston."</p>

<p>"Anne likes Savannah best," said Francis Wilmot.</p>

<p>Anne nodded. She was not talkative, it seemed, though her voice
had sounded pleasant in small quantities.</p>

<p>"It's kind of lonely where we live," said Francis. "Mostly
darkies. Anne's never seen an Englishman to speak to."</p>

<p>Anne smiled. Jon also smiled. Neither pursued the subject. They
arrived at the eatables, spread in a manner calculated to give the
maximum of muscular and digestive exertion. Mrs. Pulmore Hurrison, a
lady of forty or so, and of defined features, was seated with her
feet turned up; next to her, Gurdon Minho, the English novelist, had
his legs in a more reserved position; and then came quantities of
seated girls, all with pretty, unreserved legs; Mr. Pulmore Hurrison,
somewhat apart, was pursing a small mouth over the cork of a large
bottle. Jon and the Wilmots also sat down. The picnic had begun.</p>

<p>Jon soon realised that everybody was expecting Gurdon Minho to say
something beyond "Yes" "Really!" "Ah!" "Quite!" This did not occur.
The celebrated novelist was at first almost painfully attentive to
what everybody else said, and then seemed to go into a coma. Jon felt
a patriotic disappointment, for he himself was, if anything, even
more silent. He could see that, among the three Blair girls and their
two girl friends, a sort of conspiracy was brewing, to quiz the
silent English in the privacy of the future. Francis Wilmot's
speechless sister was a comfort to him, therefore, for he felt that
she would neither be entitled nor inclined to join that conspiracy.
He took refuge in handing victuals and was glad when the period of
eating on constricted stomachs was over. Picnics were like Christmas
Day, better in the future and the past than in the present. After the
normal period of separation into genders, the baskets were repacked,
and all resorted to their vehicles. The two cars departed for another
mound said to be two miles off. Francis Wilmot and the two Blair
girls believed that they would get back and watch the polo. Jon asked
Anne Wilmot which she wished to do. She elected to see the other
mound.</p>

<p>They mounted and pursued a track through the woods in silence,
till Jon said:</p>

<p>"Do you like picnics?"</p>

<p>"I certainty do not."</p>

<p>"Nor do I. But riding?"</p>

<p>"I just adore it more than anything in the world."</p>

<p>"More than dancing?"</p>

<p>"Surely. Riding and swimming."</p>

<p>"Ah! I <i>thought</i>--" And he was silent.</p>

<p>"What did you think?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought somehow you were a good swimmer."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Jon said with embarrassment:</p>

<p>"By your eyes--"</p>

<p>"What! Are they fishy?"</p>

<p>Jon laughed.</p>

<p>"Not exactly. They're like a water nymph's."</p>

<p>"I don't just know if that's a compliment."</p>

<p>"Of course it is."</p>

<p>"I thought nymphs weren't respectable."</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>water</i> nymphs--very! Shy, of course."</p>

<p>"Do you have many in England?"</p>

<p>"No. As a matter of fact I've never seen one before."</p>

<p>"Then how do you know?"</p>

<p>"Just a general sense of what's fitting."</p>

<p>"I suppose you had a classical education. Don't you all have that
in England?"</p>

<p>"Far from it."</p>

<p>"And how do you like America, Mr. Forsyte?"</p>

<p>"Very much. I get homesick sometimes."</p>

<p>"I'd love to travel."</p>

<p>"You never have?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I just stay at home and look after things.
But I reckon we'll have to sell the old home--cotton doesn't pay any
more."</p>

<p>"I grow peaches near Southern Pines, you know, up in North
Carolina; that's paying at present."</p>

<p>"D'you live there alone?"</p>

<p>"No; with my mother."</p>

<p>"Is she English?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you a father?"</p>

<p>"He died four years ago."</p>

<p>"Francis and I have been orphans ten years."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd both come and stay with us some day; my mother would
be awfully glad."</p>

<p>"Is she like you?"</p>

<p>Jon laughed.</p>

<p>"No. She's beautiful."</p>

<p>The eyes regarded him gravely, the lips smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"I'd just love to come, but Francis and I can't ever be away
together."</p>

<p>"But," said Jon, "you're both here."</p>

<p>"We go back to-morrow; I wanted to see Camden." The eyes resumed
their steady consideration of Jon's face. "Won't you come back with
us and see our home--it's old? Francis would like to have you
come."</p>

<p>"Do you always know what your brother would like?"</p>

<p>"Surely."</p>

<p>"That must be jolly. But do you really mean you want me?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do."</p>

<p>"I'd enjoy it awfully; I hate hotels. I mean--well, you know--"
But as <i>he</i> didn't, he was not so sure that she did.</p>

<p>She touched her horse, and the single-footing animal broke into a
canter.</p>

<p>Along the alleys of the eternal pinewood the sun was in their
eyes; a warmed scent rose from pine needles, gum and herbs; the going
was sandy and soft; the horses in good mood. Jon felt happy. This
girl had strange eyes, enticing; and she rode better even than the
Blair girls.</p>

<p>"I suppose all the English ride well?" she said.</p>

<p>"Most do, when they ride at all; but we don't ride much
nowadays."</p>

<p>"I'd love to see England; our folk came from England in
1700--Worcestershire. Where is that?"</p>

<p>"It's our middle west," said Jon. "But as unlike as ever you can
imagine. It's a fruit-growing county--very pretty; white timbered
houses, pastures, orchards, woods, green hills. I went there walking
one holiday with a school friend."</p>

<p>"It sounds just lovely. Our ancestors were Roman Catholics. They
had a place called Naseby; that's why we call ours Naseby. But my
grandmother was French Creole, from Louisiana. Is it true that in
England they think Creoles have negro blood in them?"</p>

<p>"We're very ignorant," said Jon. "<i>I</i> know the Creoles are
the old French and Spanish families. You both look as if you had
French blood."</p>

<p>"Francis does. Do you think we've passed that mound? We've come
all of four miles, and I thought it was only two."</p>

<p>"Does it matter? The other mound was rather over-rated."</p>

<p>The lips smiled; she didn't ever quite laugh, it seemed.</p>

<p>"What Indians hereabouts?" asked Jon.</p>

<p>"I'm not too sure; Seminoles, if any, I think. But Francis says
these mounds would be from way back before the present tribes. What
made you come to America, Mr. Forsyte?"</p>

<p>Jon bit his lip. To give the reason--family feud--broken love
affair--was not exactly possible.</p>

<p>"I went first to British Columbia; but I didn't get on too well.
Then I heard of peaches in North Carolina."</p>

<p>"But why did you leave England?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I just wanted to see the world."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. It was a quiet but comprehending sound; Jon was
the more gratified, because she had not comprehended. The image of
his first love did not often haunt him now--had not for a year or
more. He had been so busy with his peaches. Besides, Holly had
written that Fleur had a boy. He said suddenly: "I think we ought to
turn. Look at the sun!" The sun, indeed, was well down behind the
trees.</p>

<p>"My--yes!"</p>

<p>Jon turned his steed. "Let's gallop, it'll be down in half an
hour; and there's no moon till late."</p>

<p>They galloped back along the track. The sun went down even faster
than he had thought, the air grew cold, the light grey. Jon reined up
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry; I don't believe we're on the track we came by
from the picnic. I feel we've gone off to the right. The tracks are
all alike and these horses only came in from Columbia yesterday; they
don't know the country any more than we do."</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>"We'll be lost."</p>

<p>"M'm! That'll be no joke in these woods. Don't they ever end?"</p>

<p>"I reckon not, in these parts. It's an adventure."</p>

<p>"Yes; but you'll catch cold. It's jolly cold at night."</p>

<p>"And you've had 'flu!"</p>

<p>"Oh! That's all right. Here's a track to the left. Shall we go on,
or shall we take it?"</p>

<p>"Take it."</p>

<p>They cantered on. It was too dark now for galloping, and soon too
dark for cantering. And the track wound on and on.</p>

<p>"This is a pretty business," said Jon. "I am sorry." He peered
towards her riding beside him, and could just see her smile.</p>

<p>"Why! It's lots of fun."</p>

<p>He was glad she thought so, but he could not see it.</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> been an ass. Your brother'll be pretty sick with
me."</p>

<p>"He'll know I'm with you."</p>

<p>"If we only had a compass. We may be out all night at this rate.
Here's another fork! Gosh, it is going to be dark."</p>

<p>And, almost as he spoke, the last of the light failed; he could
barely see her five yards away.</p>

<p>He came up close alongside, and she touched his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," she said; "that spoils it."</p>

<p>Shifting his reins, he gave her hand a squeeze.</p>

<p>"You're splendid, Miss Wilmot."</p>

<p>"Oh! do call me Anne. Surnames seem kind of chilly when you're
lost."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. My name's Jon. Without an h, you know--short
for Jolyon."</p>

<p>"Jolyon--Jon; I like it."</p>

<p>"Well, Anne's always been my favourite name. Shall we stop till
the moon rises, or ride on?"</p>

<p>"When will the moon rise?"</p>

<p>"Not for hours, judging from last night."</p>

<p>"Let's ride on and leave it to the horses."</p>

<p>"Right! Only if they make for anywhere I'm pretty sure it'll be
towards Columbia, which must be miles and miles."</p>

<p>They pursued the narrow track at a foot's pace. It was really dark
now. Jon said: "Are you cold? You'd be warmer walking. I'll go ahead;
stick close enough to see me."</p>

<p>He went ahead, and soon dismounted, feeling cold himself; there
was utter silence among unending trees.</p>

<p>"I'm cold now," said the voice of Anne. "I'll get off too."</p>

<p>They had trailed on perhaps half an hour like this, leading their
horses, and almost feeling their way, when Jon said: "Look! There's
some sort of a clearing here! And what's that blackness on the
left?"</p>

<p>"It's a mound."</p>

<p>"Which mound, I wonder? The one we saw, or the other, or
neither?"</p>

<p>"I reckon we'd better stop here till the moon rises, then maybe
we'll see which it is, and know our way."</p>

<p>"You're right. There'll be swamps, I expect. I'll tether the
horses to leeward, and we'll try to find a nook. It <i>is</i>
cold."</p>

<p>He tethered the horses out of the wind, and, turning back, found
her beside him.</p>

<p>"It's creepy here," she said.</p>

<p>"We'll find a snug place, and sit down."</p>

<p>He put his hand through her arm, and they moved round the foot of
the mound.</p>

<p>"Here," said Jon suddenly; "they've been digging. This'll be
sheltered." He felt the ground--dry enough. "Let's squat here and
talk."</p>

<p>Side by side, with their backs to the wall of the excavated
hollow, they lighted cigarettes, and sat listening to the silence.
But for a snuffle or soft stamp now and then from the horses, there
was not a sound. Trees and wind, both, were too sparse for melody,
and nothing but their two selves and their horses seemed alive. A
sprinkle of stars in a very dark sky and the deeper blackness of the
pine stems was all they could see. Ah! and the glowing tips of their
cigarettes, and each other's faces thereby illumined, now and
then.</p>

<p>"I don't expect you'll ever forgive me for this," said Jon, with
gloom.</p>

<p>"Why! I'm just loving it."</p>

<p>"Very sweet of you to say so; but you must be awfully cold. Look
here--have my coat!"</p>

<p>He had begun to take it off when she said: "If you do that I'll
run out into the woods and get really lost."</p>

<p>Jon resumed his coat.</p>

<p>"It might have been one of those Blair girls," he said.</p>

<p>"Would you rather?"</p>

<p>"For your sake, of course. Not for my own--no, indeed!"</p>

<p>They were looking round at each other so that the tips of their
cigarettes were almost touching. Just able to see her eyes, he had a
very distinct impulse to put his arm round her. It seemed the natural
and proper thing to do, but of course it was not "done"!</p>

<p>"Have some chocolate," she said.</p>

<p>Jon ate a very little. The chocolate should be reserved for
her!</p>

<p>"This is a real adventure. It <i>is</i> black. I'd have been
scared alone--seems kind of spooky here."</p>

<p>"Spirits of the old Indians," muttered Jon. "Only I don't believe
in spirits."</p>

<p>"You would if you'd had a coloured nanny."</p>

<p>"Did you have one?"</p>

<p>"Surely, with a voice as soft as mush melon. We have one old
darkie still, who was a slave as a boy. He's the best of all the
negroes round--nearly eighty, with quite white hair."</p>

<p>"Your father couldn't have been in the Civil War, could he?"</p>

<p>"No; my two grandfathers and my great-grandfather."</p>

<p>"And how old are you, Anne?"</p>

<p>"Nineteen."</p>

<p>"I'm twenty-three."</p>

<p>"Tell me about your home in England."</p>

<p>"I haven't one now." He began an expurgated edition of his youth,
and it seemed to him that she listened beautifully. He asked for her
story in return; and, while she was telling it, wondered whether he
liked her voice or not. It dwelled and slurred, but was soft and had
great flavour. When she had finished her simple tale, for she had
hardly been away from home, there was silence, till Jon said:</p>

<p>"I'll go and see that the horses are all right; then perhaps you
could get a snooze."</p>

<p>He moved round the foot of the mound till he came to the horses,
and stayed a little talking to them and stroking their noses. A
feeling, warm and protective, stirred within him. This was a nice
child, and a brave one. A face to remember, with lots behind it.
Suddenly he heard her voice, low and as if pretending not to call:
"Jon, oh, Jon!" He felt his way back through the darkness. Her hands
were stretched out.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> so spooky! That funny rustling! I've got creeps down
my back!"</p>

<p>"The wind's got up a bit. Let's sit back to back--it'll keep you
warm. Or, look here, I'll sit against the bank; if you lean up
against me you could go to sleep. It's only an hour or two now before
we can ride on by moonlight."</p>

<p>They took up the suggested postures, her back against his side,
and her head in the hollow of his arm and shoulder.</p>

<p>"Comfy?"</p>

<p>"Surely. It stops the creeps."</p>

<p>They smoked and talked a little more. The stars were brighter now,
and their eyes more accustomed to the darkness. And they were
grateful for each other's warmth. Jon enjoyed the scent, as of hay,
that rose from her hair not far below his nose. Then came a long
silence, while the warm protective feeling grew and grew within him.
He would have liked to slip his arms round and hold her closer. But
of course he did not. It was, however, as much as he could do to
remain a piece of warmth impersonal enough for her to recline
against. This was the very first time since he left England that he
had felt an inclination to put his arms round anyone, so badly burnt
had he been in that old affair. The wind rose, talked in the trees,
died away again; the stillness was greater than ever. He was very
wide awake, and it seemed curious to him that she should sleep, for,
surely, she was asleep--so still. The stars twinkled, and he gazed up
at them. His limbs began to ache and twitch, and suddenly he realised
that she was no more asleep than he. She slowly turned her head till
he could see her eyes, grave, enticing.</p>

<p>"I'm cramping you," she said, and raised herself; but his arm
restored her.</p>

<p>"Not a bit; so long as you're warm and comfy."</p>

<p>Her head settled in again; and the vigil was resumed. They talked
a little now, of nothing important, and he thought: 'It's queer--one
could live months knowing people and not know them half so well as we
shall know each other now.'</p>

<p>Again a long silence fell; but this time his arm was round her, it
was more comfortable so, for both of them. And Jon began to have the
feeling that it would be inadvisable for the moon to rise. Had she
that feeling too? He wondered. But if she had, the moon in its
courses paid no attention. For suddenly he became conscious that it
was there, behind the trees somewhere lurking, a curious kind of
stilly glimmer creeping about the air, along the ground, in and out
of the tree-stems.</p>

<p>"The moon!" he said. She did not stir, and his heart beat rather
fast. So! She did not want the moon to rise any more than he! And
slowly the creeping glimmer became light, and, between the
tree-stems, stole, invading their bodies till they were visible. And
still they sat, unstirring, as if afraid to break a spell. The moon
gained power and a cold glory, and rose above the trees; the world
was alive once more. Jon thought, 'Could I kiss her?' and at once
recoiled. As if she would want! But, as though she divined his
thought, she turned her head, and her eyes looked into his.</p>

<p>"I'm in charge of you!" he did not exactly say.</p>

<p>Her answer was a little sigh, and she got up. They stood, gazing
into the whitened mysterious wood.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Jon; "It <i>is</i> the mound. There's the path down
to the hollow where we had the picnic. Now we can find the way all
right."</p>

<p>She made a sound that he could not interpret, and they went
towards the horses, untethered them, and mounted. They set forth,
riding side by side.</p>

<p>"This'll be something to remember," said Jon.</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall always remember it."</p>

<p>They said no more, except to consult about the way, but this was
soon so clear, that they cantered till they came out on the polo
ground close to the hotel.</p>

<p>"Go in and relieve your brother's mind. I'll take the horses
round, and then come on."</p>

<p>When he entered the hotel lounge Francis Wilmot, still in riding
clothes, was alone. His expression was peculiar, not exactly hostile,
but certainly not friendly.</p>

<p>"Anne's gone up," he said, "I reckon you haven't much bump of
locality. You surely had me scared."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," said Jon humbly, "I forgot the horses were
new to the country."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Francis Wilmot, and shrugged his shoulders. Jon
looked at the young man steadily.</p>

<p>"You don't think that I got bushed on purpose? Because you look as
if you did."</p>

<p>Again Francis Wilmot shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," said Jon, "but aren't you forgetting that your
sister's a lady, and that one doesn't behave like a cad with a
lady?"</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot did not answer; he went to a window and stood
looking out. Jon felt very angry. He sat down on the arm of a long
chair, suddenly extremely tired. He sat there looking at the ground,
and frowning heavily. Damn the fellow! Had he been bullying Anne? If
he had--! A voice behind him said: "I reckon I didn't mean it. I
certainly am sorry. It was just the scare. Shake hands!"</p>

<p>Jon stretched out his own impulsively, and they shook hands,
looking straight into each other's eyes.</p>

<p>"You must be about through," said Francis Wilmot. "Come on to my
room; I've gotten a flask. I've given Anne a dram already."</p>

<p>They went up. Jon sat in the only chair, Francis Wilmot on the
bed.</p>

<p>"Anne tells me she's asked you to come home with us to-morrow. I
surely hope you will."</p>

<p>"I should simply love to."</p>

<p>"That's fine!"</p>

<p>They drank, talked a little, smoked.</p>

<p>"Good night," said Jon, suddenly, "or I shall go to sleep
here."</p>

<p>They shook hands again, and Jon staggered to his room. He fell
asleep at once.</p>

<p>They travelled next day, all three, through Columbia and
Charleston, to the Wilmot's place. It stood in the bend of a red
river, with cotton fields around, and swampy ground where live oaks
grew, melancholy, festooned with Florida moss. The old slave
quarters, disused except as kennels, were still standing; the
two-storied house had flights of wooden steps running up on each
side, on to the wide wisteria-covered porch, and needed a coat of
paint; and, within, rooms ran one into the other, hung with old
portraits of dead Wilmots and de Frevilles; and darkies wandered
around and talked their soft drawled speech.</p>

<p>Jon was happier than he had been since he landed in the New World
three and a half years ago. In the mornings he sauntered with the
dogs in the sunlight or tried to write poetry--for the two young
Wilmots were busy. After the midday meal he rode with them or with
Anne alone. In the evening he learned from her to play the ukulele
before a wood fire lighted at sundown, or heard about cotton culture
from Francis, with whom, since that moment of animosity, he was on
the best of terms.</p>

<p>Between Anne and himself there was little talk; they had, as it
were, resumed the silence which had fallen when they sat in the dark
under the old Indian mound. But he watched her; indeed, he was always
trying to catch the grave enticing look in her dark eyes. More and
more she seemed to him unlike any girl he had ever known; quicker,
more silent, and with more "sand." The days went on, in warm sun, and
the nightly scent of wood smoke; and his holiday drew to an end. He
could play the ukulele now, and they sang to it--negro spirituals,
songs from comic operas, and other immortal works. The last day came,
and dismay descended on Jon. To-morrow, early, he was going back to
his peaches at Southern Pines! That afternoon, riding with her for
the last time, the silence was almost unnatural, and she did not even
look at him. Jon went up to change, with panic in his heart. He knew
now that he wanted to take her back with him, and he thought he knew
that she did not want to come. How he would miss watching for those
eyes to be fixed on him. He was thirsty with the wish to kiss her. He
went down moodily, and sat in a long chair before the wood fire,
pulling a spaniel's ears and watching the room darken. Perhaps she
wouldn't even come for a last sing-song. Perhaps there would be
nothing more but dinner and an evening <i>&agrave; trois;</i> not
even a chance to say he loved her and be told that she didn't love
him. And he thought, miserably: 'It's my fault--I'm a silent fool;
I've missed my chance.' The room darkened till there was nothing but
firelight, and the spaniel went to sleep. Jon, too, closed his eyes.
It was as if he could wait better, thus--for the worst. When he
opened them she was standing in front of him with the ukuleles in her
hands.</p>

<p>"Do you want to play, Jon?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jon, "let's play. It's the last time"; and he took his
ukulele.</p>

<p>She sat down on the rug before the fire, and began to tune hers.
Jon slipped down beside the spaniel and began to tune his. The
spaniel got up and went away.</p>

<p>"What shall we sing?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to sing, Anne. You sing; I'll just accompany."</p>

<p>She didn't look at him! She would not look at him! It was all up!
What a fool he'd been!</p>

<p>Anne sang. She sang a crooning phrase--some Spanish air. Jon
plucked his strings, and the tune plucked his heart. She sang it
through. She sang it again, and her eyes slid round. God! She
<i>was</i> looking at him. She mustn't see that he knew she was! It
was too good--that long dark look over the ukulele. Between him and
her were her ukulele and his own. He dropped the beastly thing. And,
suddenly shifting along the floor, he put his arm round her. Without
a word she drooped her head against his shoulder, as when they sat
under the Indian mound. He bent his cheek down to her hair. It
smelled, as it had then, of hay. And, just as she had screwed her
face round in the moonlight, she turned it to him now. But this time
Jon kissed her lips.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="C01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>A STRANGER</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The young man, who, at the end of September, 1924, dismounted from
a taxicab in South Square, Westminster, was so unobtrusively American
that his driver had some hesitation in asking for double his fare.
The young man had no hesitation in refusing it.</p>

<p>"Are you unable to read?" he said, softly. "Here's four
shillings."</p>

<p>With that he turned his back and looked at the house before which
he had descended. This, the first private English house he had ever
proposed to enter, inspired him with a certain uneasiness, as of a
man who expects to part with a family ghost. Comparing a letter with
the number chased in pale brass on the door, he murmured: "It surely
is," and rang the bell.</p>

<p>While waiting for the door to be opened, he was conscious of
extreme quietude, broken by a clock chiming four as if with the voice
of Time itself. When the last boom died, the door yawned inward, and
a man, almost hairless, said:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>The young man removed a soft hat from a dark head.</p>

<p>"This is Mrs. Michael Mont's house?"</p>

<p>"Correct, sir."</p>

<p>"Will you give her my card, and this letter?"</p>

<p>"'Mr. Francis Wilmot, Naseby, S. C.' Will you wait in here,
sir?"</p>

<p>Ushered through the doorway of a room on the right, Francis Wilmot
was conscious of a commotion close to the ground, and some teeth
grazing the calf of his leg.</p>

<p>"Dandie!" said the voice of the hairless man, "you little devil!
That dog is a proper little brute with strangers, sir. Stand still!
I've known him bite clean through a lady's stockings."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot saw with interest a silver-grey dog nine inches
high and nearly as broad, looking up at him with lustrous eyes above
teeth of extreme beauty.</p>

<p>"It's the baby, sir," said the hairless man, pointing to a sort of
nest on the floor before the fireless hearth; "he <i>will</i> go for
people when he's with the baby. But once he gets to smelling your
trousers, he's all right. Better not touch the baby, though. Mrs.
Mont was here a minute ago; I'll take your card up to her."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot sat down on a settee in the middle of the room; and
the dog lay between him and the baby.</p>

<p>And while the young man sat he gazed around him. The room was
painted in panels of a sub-golden hue, with a silver-coloured
ceiling. A clavichord, little golden ghost of a piano, stood at one
end. Glass lustres, pictures of flowers and of a silvery-necked lady
swinging a skirt and her golden slippers, adorned the walls. The
curtains were of gold and silver. The silver-coloured carpet felt
wonderfully soft beneath his feet, the furniture was of a golden
wood.</p>

<p>The young man felt suddenly quite homesick. He was back in the
living-room of an old "Colonial" house, in the bend of a lonely South
Carolina river, reddish in hue. He was staring at the effigy of his
high-collared, red-coated great-grandfather, Francis Wilmot, Royalist
major in the War of Independence. They always said it was like the
effigy he saw when shaving every morning; the smooth dark hair
drooping across his right temple, the narrow nose and lips, the
narrow dark hand on the sword-hilt or the razor, the slits of dark
eyes gazing steadily out. Young Francis was seeing the darkies
working in the cotton-fields under a sun that he did not seem to have
seen since he came over here; he was walking with his setter along
the swamp edge, where Florida moss festooned the tall dolorous trees;
he was thinking of the Wilmot inheritance, ruined in the Civil War,
still decayed yet precious, and whether to struggle on with it, or to
sell it to the Yank who wanted a week-end run-to from his Charleston
dock job, and would improve it out of recognition. It would be lonely
there, now that Anne had married that young Britisher, Jon Forsyte,
and gone away north, to Southern Pines. And he thought of his sister,
thus lost to him, dark, pale, vivid, 'full of sand.' Yes! this room
made him homesick, with its perfection, such as he had never beheld,
where the only object out of keeping was that dog, lying on its side
now, and so thick through that all its little legs were in the air.
Softly he said:</p>

<p>"It's the prettiest room I ever was in."</p>

<p>"What a perfectly charming thing to overhear!"</p>

<p>A young woman, with crinkly chestnut hair above a creamy face,
with smiling lips, a short straight nose, and very white dark-lashed
eyelids active over dark hazel eyes, stood near the door. She came
towards him, and held out her hand.</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot bowed over it, and said, gravely:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Michael Mont?"</p>

<p>"So Jon's married your sister. Is she pretty?"</p>

<p>"She is."</p>

<p>"Very?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"I hope baby has been entertaining you."</p>

<p>"He's just great."</p>

<p>"He is, rather. I hear Dandie bit you?"</p>

<p>"I reckon he didn't break the cuticle."</p>

<p>"Haven't you looked? But he's quite healthy. Sit down, and tell me
all about your sister and Jon. Is it a marriage of true minds?"</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot sat down.</p>

<p>"It certainly is. Young Jon is a pretty white man, and Anne--"</p>

<p>He heard a sigh.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad. He says in his letter that he's awfully happy. You
must come and stay here. You can be as free as you like. Look on us
as an hotel."</p>

<p>The young man's dark eyes smiled.</p>

<p>"That's too good of you! I've never been on this side before. They
got through the war too soon."</p>

<p>Fleur took the baby out of its nest.</p>

<p>"<i>This</i> creature doesn't bite. Look--two teeth, but they
don't antagonise--isn't that how you put it?"</p>

<p>"What is its name?"</p>

<p>"Kit--for Christopher. We agreed about its name, luckily.
Michael--my husband--will be in directly. He's in Parliament, you
know. They're not sitting till Monday--Ireland, of course. We only
came back for it from Italy yesterday. Italy's so wonderful--you must
see it."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but is that the Parliament clock that chimes so
loud?"</p>

<p>"Big Ben--yes. He marks time for them. Michael says Parliament is
the best drag on Progress ever invented. With our first Labour
Government, it's been specially interesting this year. Don't you
think it's rather touching the way this dog watches my baby? He's got
the most terrific jaw!"</p>

<p>"What kind of dog is he?"</p>

<p>"A Dandie Dinmont. We did have a Peke. It was a terrible tragedy.
He <i>would</i> go after cats; and one day he struck a fighting Tom,
and got clawed over both eyes--quite blinded--and so--"</p>

<p>The young man saw her eyes suddenly too bright. He made a soft
noise, and said gently: "That was too bad."</p>

<p>"I had to change this room completely. It used to be Chinese. It
reminded me too much."</p>

<p>"This little fellow would chaw any cat."</p>

<p>"Luckily he was brought up with kittens. We got him for his
legs--they're so bowed in front that he can hardly run, so he just
suits the pram. Dan, show your legs!"</p>

<p>The Dandie looked up with a negative sound.</p>

<p>"He's a terrible little 'character.' Do tell me, what's Jon like
now? Is he still English?"</p>

<p>The young man was conscious that she had uttered at last something
really in her mind.</p>

<p>"He is; but he's a dandy fellow."</p>

<p>"And his mother? She used to be beautiful."</p>

<p>"And is to this day."</p>

<p>"She would be. Grey, I suppose, by now?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You don't like her?"</p>

<p>"Well, I hope she won't be jealous of your sister!"</p>

<p>"I think, perhaps, you're unjust."</p>

<p>"I think, perhaps, I am."</p>

<p>She sat very still, her face hard above the baby's. And the young
man, aware of thoughts beyond his reach, got up.</p>

<p>"When you write to Jon," she said, suddenly, "tell him that I'm
awfully glad, and that I wish him luck. I shan't write to him myself.
May I call you Francis?"</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot bowed. "I shall be proud, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Yes; but you must call me Fleur. We're sort of related, you
know."</p>

<p>The young man smiled, and touched the name with his lips.</p>

<p>"Fleur! It's a beautiful name!"</p>

<p>"Your room will be ready when you come back. You'll have a
bathroom to yourself, of course."</p>

<p>He put his lips to the hand held out.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful," he said. "I was feeling kind of homesick; I miss
the sun over here."</p>

<p>In going out, he looked back. Fleur had put her baby back in its
nest, and was staring straight before her.</p>

<br>


<h2>CHANGE</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>But more than the death of a dog had caused the regarnishing of
Fleur's Chinese room. On the evening of her twenty-second birth-day
Michael had come home saying:</p>

<p>"Well, my child, I've chucked publishing. With old Danby always in
the right--it isn't a career."</p>

<p>"Oh! Michael, you'll be bored to death."</p>

<p>"I'll go into Parliament. It's quite usual, and about the same
screw."</p>

<p>He had spoken in jest. Six days later it became apparent that she
had listened in earnest.</p>

<p>"You were absolutely right, Michael. It's the very thing for you.
You've got ideas."</p>

<p>"Other people's."</p>

<p>"And the gift of the gab. We're frightfully handy for the House,
here."</p>

<p>"It costs money, Fleur."</p>

<p>"Yes; I've spoken to father. It was rather funny--there's never
been a Forsyte, you know, anywhere near Parliament. But he thinks
it'll be good for me; and that it's all baronets are fit for."</p>

<p>"One has to have a Seat, unfortunately."</p>

<p>"Well, I've sounded your father, too. He'll speak to people. They
want young men."</p>

<p>"Ah! And what are my politics?"</p>

<p>"My dear boy, you must know--at thirty."</p>

<p>"I'm not a Liberal. But am I Labour or Tory?"</p>

<p>"You can think it out before the next election!"</p>

<p>Next day, while he was shaving, and she was in her bath, he cut
himself slightly and said:</p>

<p>"The land and this unemployment is what I really care about. I'm a
Foggartist."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Old Sir James Foggart's book, that he published after all. You
read it."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, you said so."</p>

<p>"So did others."</p>

<p>"Never mind--his eyes are fixed on 1944, and his policy's
according. Safety in the Air, the Land, and Child Emigration;
adjustment of Supply and Demand within the Empire; cut our losses in
Europe; and endure a worse Present for the sake of a better Future.
Everything, in fact, that's unpopular, and said to be
impossible."</p>

<p>"Well, you could keep all that to yourself till you get in. You'll
have to stand as a Tory."</p>

<p>"How lovely you look!"</p>

<p>"If you get in, you can disagree with everybody. That'll give you
a position from the start."</p>

<p>"Some scheme!" murmured Michael.</p>

<p>"You can initiate this--this Foggartism. He isn't mad, is he?"</p>

<p>"No, only too sane, which is much the same thing, of course. You
see we've got a higher wage-scale than any other country except
America and the Dominions; and it isn't coming down again; we really
group in with the new countries. He's for growing as much of our food
as we can, and pumping British town children, before they're spoiled,
into the Colonies, till Colonial demand for goods equals our supply.
It's no earthly, of course, without whole-hearted co-operation
between the Governments within the Empire."</p>

<p>"It sounds very sensible."</p>

<p>"We published him, you know, but at his own expense. It's a 'faith
and the mountain' stunt. He's got the faith all right, but the
mountain shows no signs of moving up to now."</p>

<p>Fleur stood up. "Well," she said, "that's settled. Your father
says he can get you a nomination as a Tory, and you can keep your own
views to yourself. You'll get in on the human touch, Michael."</p>

<p>"Thank you, ducky. Can I help dry you?" . . .</p>

<p>Before redecorating her Chinese room, however, Fleur had waited
till after Michael was comfortably seated for a division which
professed to be interested in agriculture. She chose a blend between
Adam and Louis Quinze. Michael called it the 'bimetallic parlour';
and carried off "The White Monkey" to his study. The creature's
pessimism was not, he felt, suited to political life.</p>

<p>Fleur had initiated her 'salon' with a gathering in February. The
soul of society had passed away since the Liberal
<i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> and Lady Alison's politico-legal coterie
no longer counted. Plainer people were in the ascendant. Her
Wednesday evenings were youthful, with age represented by her
father-in-law, two minor ambassadors, and Pevensey Blythe, editor of
<i>The Outpost.</i> So unlike his literary style that he was usually
mistaken for a Colonial Prime Minister, Blythe was a tall man with a
beard, and grey bloodshot eyes, who expressed knowledge in paragraphs
that few could really understand. "What Blythe thinks to-day, the
Conservative Party will not think to-morrow," was said of him. He
spoke in a small voice, and constantly used the impersonal
pronoun.</p>

<p>"One is walking in one's sleep," he would say of the political
situation, "and will wake up without any clothes on."</p>

<p>A warm supporter of Sir James Foggart's book, characterising it as
"the masterpiece of a blind archangel," he had a passion for
listening to the clavichord, and was invaluable in Fleur's
'salon.'</p>

<p>Freed from poetry and modern music, from Sibley Swan, Walter
Nazing and Hugo Solstis, Fleur was finding time for her son--the
eleventh baronet. He represented for her the reality of things.
Michael might have posthumous theories, and Labour predatory hopes,
but for her the year 1944 would see the eleventh baronet come of age.
That Kit should inherit an England worth living in was of more
intrinsic importance than anything they proposed in the Commons and
were unable to perform. All those houses they were going to build,
for instance--very proper, but a little unnecessary if Kit still had
Lippinghall Manor and South Square, Westminster, to dwell in. Not
that Fleur voiced such cynical convictions, or admitted them even to
herself. She did orthodox lip-service to the great god Progress.</p>

<p>The Peace of the World, Hygiene, Trade, and the End of
Unemployment, preoccupied all, irrespective of Party, and Fleur was
in the fashion; but instinct, rather than Michael and Sir James
Foggart, told her that the time-honoured motto: 'Eat your cake and
have it,' which underlay the platforms of all Parties, was not 'too
frightfully' sound. So long as Kit had cake, it was no good bothering
too deeply about the rest; though, of course, one must seem to.
Fluttering about her 'salon'--this to that person, and that to the
other, and to all so pretty, she charmed by her grace, her
common-sense, her pliancy. Not infrequently she attended at the
House, and sat, not listening too much to the speeches, yet picking
up, as it were, by a sort of seventh sense (if women in Society all
had six, surely Fleur had seven) what was necessary to the conduct of
that 'salon'--the rise and fall of the Governmental barometer, the
catchwords and clich&eacute;s of policy; and, more valuable,
impressions of personality, of the residuary man within the Member.
She watched Michael's career, with the fostering eye of a godmother
who has given her godchild a blue morocco prayer-book, in the hope
that some day he may remember its existence. Although a sedulous
attendant at the House all through the Spring and summer, Michael had
not yet opened his mouth, and so far she had approved of his silence,
while nurturing his desire to know his own mind by listening to his
wanderings in Foggartism. If it were indeed the only permanent cure
for Unemployment, as he said, she too was a Foggartist; common-sense
assuring her that the only real danger to Kit's future lay in that
national malady. Eliminate Unemployment, and nobody would have time
to make a fuss. But her criticisms were often pertinent:</p>

<p>"My dear boy, does a country ever sacrifice the present for the
sake of the future?" or: "Do you really think country life is better
than town life?" or: "Can you imagine sending Kit out of England at
fourteen to some Godforsaken end of the world?" or: "Do you suppose
the towns will have it?" And they roused Michael to such persistence
and fluency that she felt he would really catch on in time--like old
Sir Giles Snoreham, whom they would soon be making a peer, because he
had always worn low-crowned hats and advocated a return to hansom
cabs. Hats, buttonholes, an eyeglass--she turned over in her mind all
such little realities as help a political career.</p>

<p>"Plain glass doesn't harm the sight; and it really has a focussing
value, Michael."</p>

<p>"My child, it's never done my Dad a bit of good; I doubt, if it's
sold three copies of any of his books. No! If I get on, it'll be by
talking."</p>

<p>But still she encouraged him to keep his mouth shut.</p>

<p>"It's no good starting wrong, Michael. These Labour people aren't
going to last out the year."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Their heads are swelling, and their tempers going. They're only
on sufferance; people on sufferance have got to be pleasant or they
won't be suffered. When they go out, the Tories will get in again and
probably last. You'll have several years to be eccentric in, and by
the time they're out again, you'll have your licence. Just go on
working the human touch in your constituency; I'm sure it's a mistake
to forget you've got constituents."</p>

<p>Michael spent most week-ends that summer working the human touch
in mid-Bucks; and Fleur spent most week-ends with the eleventh
baronet at her father's house near Mapledurham.</p>

<p>Since wiping the dust of the city off his feet, after that affair
of Elderson and the P. P. R. S., Soames had become almost too
countrified for a Forsyte. He had bought the meadows on the far side
of the river and several Jersey cows. Not that he was going in for
farming or nonsense of that sort, but it gave him an interest to punt
himself over and see them milked. He had put up a good deal of glass,
too, and was laying down melons. The English melon was superior to
any other, and every year's connection with a French wife made him
more and more inclined to eat what he grew himself. After Michael was
returned for Parliament, Fleur had sent him Sir James Foggart's book,
"The Parlous State of England." When it came, he said to Annette:</p>

<p>"I don't know what she thinks I want with this great thing!"</p>

<p>"To read it, Soames, I suppose."</p>

<p>Soames sniffed, turning the pages.</p>

<p>"I can't tell what it's all about."</p>

<p>"I will sell it at my bazaar, Soames. It will do for some good man
who can read English."</p>

<p>From that moment Soames began almost unconsciously to read the
book. He found it a peculiar affair, which gave most people some good
hard knocks. He began to enjoy them, especially the chapter
deprecating the workman's dislike of parting with his children at a
reasonable age. Having never been outside Europe, he had a somewhat
sketchy idea of places like South Africa, Australia, Canada, and New
Zealand; but this old fellow Foggart, it appeared, had been there,
and knew what he was talking about. What he said about their
development seemed quite sensible. Children who went out there put on
weight at once, and became owners of property at an age when in
England they were still delivering parcels, popping in and out of
jobs, hanging about street corners, and qualifying for unemployment
and Communism. Get them out of England! There was a startling
attraction in the idea for one who was English to a degree. He was in
favour, too, of what was said about growing food and making England
safe in the air. And then, slowly, he turned against it. The fellow
was too much of a Jeremiah altogether. He complained to Fleur that
the book dealt with nothing but birds in the bush; it was
unpractical. What did 'Old Mont' say?</p>

<p>"He won't read it; he says he knows old Foggart."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Soames, "I shouldn't be surprised if there were
something in it, then." That little-headed baronet was old-fashioned!
"Anyway it shows that Michael's given up those Labour fellows."</p>

<p>"Michael says Foggartism will be Labour's policy when they
understand all it means."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"He thinks it's going to do them much more good than anybody else.
He says one or two of their leaders are beginning to smell it out,
and that the rest of the leaders are bound to follow in time."</p>

<p>"In that case," said Soames, "it'll never go down with their rank
and file." And for two minutes he sat in a sort of trance. Had he
said something profound, or had he not?</p>

<p>Fleur's presence at week-ends with the eleventh baronet was
extremely agreeable to him. Though at first he had felt a sort of
disappointment that his grandchild was not a girl--an eleventh
baronet belonged too definitely to the Monts--he began, as the months
wore on, to find him 'an engaging little chap,' and in any case, to
have him down at Mapledurham kept him away from Lippinghall. It tried
him at times, of course, to see how the women hung about the
baby--there was something very excessive about motherhood. He had
noticed it with Annette; he noticed it now with Fleur.
French--perhaps! He had not remembered his own mother making such a
fuss; indeed, he could not remember anything that happened when he
was one. A week-end, when Madame Lamotte, Annette and Fleur were all
hanging over his grandson, three generations of maternity
concentrated on that pudgy morsel, reduced him to a punt, fishing for
what he felt sure nobody would eat.</p>

<p>By the time he had finished Sir James Foggart's book, the
disagreeable summer of 1924 was over, and a more disagreeable
September had set in. The mellow golden days that glow up out of a
haze which stars with dewdrops every cobweb on a gate, simply did not
come. It rained, and the river was so unnaturally full, that the
newspapers were at first unnaturally empty--there was literally no
news of drought; they filled up again slowly with reports of the
wettest summer 'for thirty years.' Calm, greenish with weed and tree
shadow, the river flowed unendingly between Soames' damp lawn and his
damp meadows. There were no mushrooms. Blackberries tasted of rain.
Soames made a point of eating one every year, and, by the flavour,
could tell what sort of year it had been. There was a good deal of
'old-man's-beard.' In spite of all this, however, he was more
cheerful than he had been for ages. Labour had been 'in,' if not in
real power, for months, and the heavens had only lowered. Forced by
Labour-in-office to take some notice of politics, he would utter
prophecies at the breakfast-table. They varied somewhat, according to
the news; and, since he always forgot those which did not come true,
he was constantly able to tell Annette that he had told her so. She
took no interest, however, occupied, like a woman, with her bazaars
and jam-making, running about in the car, shopping in London,
attending garden-parties; and, in spite of her tendency to put on
flesh, still remarkably handsome. Jack Cardigan, his niece Imogen's
husband, had made him a sixty-ninth-birthday present of a set of
golf-clubs. This was more puzzling to Soames than anything that had
ever happened to him. What on earth was he to do with them? Annette,
with that French quickness which so often annoyed him, suggested that
he should use them. She was uncomfortable! At his age--! And then,
one week-end in May the fellow himself had come down with Imogen,
and, teeing a ball up on half a molehill, had driven it across the
river.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you a box of cigars, Uncle Soames, that you don't do
that before we leave on Monday."</p>

<p>"I never bet," said Soames, "and I don't smoke."</p>

<p>"Time you began both. Look here, we'll spend to-morrow learning to
knock the ball!'</p>

<p>"Absurd!" said Soames.</p>

<p>But in his room that night he had stood in his pyjamas swinging
his arms in imitation of Jack Cardigan. The next day he sent the
women out in the car with their lunch; he was not going to have them
grinning at him. He had seldom spent more annoying hours than those
which followed. They culminated in a moment when at last he hit the
ball, and it fell into the river three yards from the near bank. He
was so stiff next morning in arms and ribs, that Annette had to rub
him till he said:</p>

<p>"Look out! you're taking the skin off!"</p>

<p>He had, however, become infected. After destroying some further
portions of his lawn, he joined the nearest Golf Club, and began to
go round by himself during the luncheon-hour, accompanied by a little
boy. He kept at it with characteristic tenacity, till by July he had
attained a certain proficiency; and he began to say to Annette that
it would do her all the good in the world to take it up, and keep her
weight down.</p>

<p><i>"Merci,</i> Soames," she would reply; "I have no wish to be the
figure of your English Misses, flat as a board before and behind."
She was reactionary, 'like her nation'; and Soames, who at heart had
a certain sympathy with curves, did not seriously press the point. He
found that the exercise jogged both his liver and his temper. He
began to have colour in his cheeks. The day after his first nine-hole
round with Jack Cardigan, who had given him three strokes a hole and
beaten him by nine holes, he received a package which, to his dismay,
contained a box of cigars. What the fellow was about, he could not
imagine! He only discovered when, one evening a few days later,
sitting at the window of his picture gallery, he found that he had
one in his mouth. Curiously enough, it did not make him sick. It
produced rather something of the feeling he used to enjoy after
'doing Cou&eacute;'--now comparatively out of fashion, since an
American, so his sister Winifred said, had found a shorter cut. A
suspicion, however, that the family had set Jack Cardigan on,
prevented him from indulging his new sensation anywhere but in his
picture gallery; so that cigars gathered the halo of a secret vice.
He renewed his store stealthily. Only when he found that Annette,
Fleur, and others had known for weeks, did he relax his rule, and say
openly that the vice of the present day was cigarettes.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said Winifred, when she next saw him, "everybody's
saying you're a different man!"</p>

<p>Soames raised his eyebrows. He was not conscious of any
change.</p>

<p>"That chap Cardigan," he said, "is a funny fellow! . . . I'm going
to dine and sleep at Fleur's; they're just back from Italy. The House
sits on Monday."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Winifred; "very fussy of them--sitting in the Long
Vacation."</p>

<p>"Ireland!" said Soames, deeply. "A pretty pair of shoes again!"
Always had been; always would be!</p>

<br>


<h2>MICHAEL TAKES 'A LUNAR'</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Michael had returned from Italy with the longing to 'get on with
it,' which results from Southern holidays. Countryman by upbringing,
still deeply absorbed by the unemployment problem, and committed to
Foggartism, as its remedy, he had taken up no other hobby in the
House, and was eating the country's bread, if somewhat unbuttered,
and doing nothing for it. He desired, therefore, to know where he
stood, and how long he was going to stand there.</p>

<p>Bent on 'taking this lunar'--as 'Old Forsyte' would call it--at
his own position, he walked away from the House that same day, after
dealing with an accumulated correspondence. He walked towards
Pevensey Blythe, in the office of that self-sufficing weekly: <i>The
Outpost.</i> Sunburnt from his Italian holiday and thinned by Italian
cookery, he moved briskly, and thought of many things. Passing down
on to the Embankment, where a number of unemployed birds on a number
of trees were also wondering, it seemed, where they stood and how
long they were going to stand there, he took a letter from his pocket
to read a second time.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"12 SAPPER'S ROW,</p>

<p>"CAMDEN TOWN.</p>

<p>HONOURABLE SIR,</p>

<p>"Being young in 'Who's Who,' you will not be hard, I think, to
those in suffering. I am an Austrian woman who married a German
eleven years ago. He was an actor on the English stage, for his
father and mother, who are no more living, brought him to England
quite young. Interned he was, and his health broken up. He has the
neurasthenie very bad so he cannot be trusted for any work. Before
the war he was always in a part, and we had some good money; but this
went partly when I was left with my child alone, and the rest was
taken by the P. T., and we got very little back, neither of us being
English. What we did get has all been to the doctor, and for our
debts, and for burying our little child, which died happily, for
though I loved it much this life which we have is not fit for a child
to live. We live on my needle, and that is not earning much, a pound
a week and sometimes nothing. The managers will not look at my
husband all these years, because he shakes suddenly, so they think he
drinks, but, Sir, he has not the money to buy it. We do not know
where to turn, or what to do. So I thought, dear Sir, whether you
could do anything for us with the P. T.; they have been quite
sympatical; but they say they administrate an order and cannot do
more. Or if you could get my husband some work where he will be in
open air--the doctor say that is what he want. We have nowhere to go
in Germany or in Austria, our well-loved families being no more
alive. I think we are like many, but I cannot help asking you, Sir,
because we want to keep living if we can, and now we are hardly
having any food. Please to forgive me my writing, and to believe your
very anxious and humble</p>

<p>"ANNA BERGFELD."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>'God help them!' thought Michael, under a plane-tree close to
Cleopatra's Needle, but without conviction. For in his view God was
not so much interested in the fate of individual aliens as the
Governor of the Bank of England in the fate of a pound of sugar
bought with the fraction of a Bradbury; He would not arbitrarily
interfere with a ripple of the tides set loose by His arrangement of
the Spheres. God, to Michael, was a monarch strictly limited by His
own Constitution. He restored the letter to his pocket. Poor
creatures! But really, with 1,200,000 and more English unemployed,
mostly due to that confounded Kaiser and his Navy stunt--! If that
fellow and his gang had not started their Naval rivalry in 1899,
England would have been out of the whole mess, or, perhaps, there
never would have been a mess!</p>

<p>He turned up from the Temple station towards the offices of <i>The
Outpost.</i> He had 'taken' that Weekly for some years now. It knew
everything, and managed to convey a slight impression that nobody
else knew anything; so that it seemed more weighty than any other
Weekly. Having no particular Party to patronise, it could patronise
the lot. Without Imperial bias, it professed a special knowledge of
the Empire. Not literary, it made a point of reducing the heads of
literary men--Michael, in his publishing days, had enjoyed every
opportunity of noticing that. Professing respect for Church and the
Law, it was an adept at giving them 'what-for.' It fancied itself on
Drama, striking a somewhat Irish attitude towards it. But, perhaps
above all, it excelled in neat detraction from political reputations,
keeping them in their place, and that place a little lower than
<i>The Outpost's.</i> Moreover, from its editorials emanated that
'holy ghost' of inspired knowledge in periods just a little beyond
average comprehension, without which no such periodical had real
importance.</p>

<p>Michael went up the stairs two at a time, and entered a large
square room, where Mr. Blythe, back to the door, was pointing with a
ruler to a circle drawn on a map.</p>

<p>"This is a bee map," said Mr. Blythe to himself. "Quite the
bee-est map I ever saw."</p>

<p>Michael could not contain a gurgle, and the eyes of Mr. Blythe
came round, prominent, epileptic, richly encircled by pouches.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he said defiantly: "You? The Colonial Office prepared
this map specially to show the best spots for Settlement schemes. And
they've left out Baggersfontein--the very hub."</p>

<p>Michael seated himself on the table.</p>

<p>"I've come in to ask what you think of the situation? My wife says
Labour will be out in no time."</p>

<p>"Our charming little lady!" said Mr. Blythe; "Labour will survive
Ireland; they will survive Russia; they will linger on in their
precarious way. One hesitates to predict their decease. Fear of their
Budget may bring them down in February. After the smell of Russian
fat has died away--say in November, Mont--one may make a start."</p>

<p>"This first speech," said Michael, "is a nightmare to me. How,
exactly, am I to start Foggartism?"</p>

<p>"One will have achieved the impression of a body of opinion before
then."</p>

<p>"But will there be one?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Blythe.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Michael. "And, by the way, what about Free Trade?"</p>

<p>"One will profess Free Trade, and put on duties."</p>

<p>"God and Mammon."</p>

<p>"Necessary in England, before any new departure, Mont. Witness
Liberal-Unionism, Tory-Socialism, and--"</p>

<p>"Other ramps," said Michael, gently.</p>

<p>"One will glide, deprecate Protection till there is more
Protection than Free Trade, then deprecate Free Trade. Foggartism is
an end, not a means; Free Trade and Protection are means, not the
ends politicians have made them."</p>

<p>Roused by the word politician, Michael got off the table; he was
coming to have a certain sympathy with those poor devils. They were
supposed to have no feeling for the country, and to be wise only
after the event. But, really, who could tell what was good for the
country, among the mists of talk? Not even old Foggart, Michael
sometimes thought.</p>

<p>"You know, Blythe," he said, "that we politicians don't think
ahead, simply because we know it's no earthly. Every elector thinks
his own immediate good is the good of the country. Only their own
shoes pinching will change electors' views. If Foggartism means
adding to the price of living now, and taking wage-earning children
away from workmen's families for the sake of benefit--ten or twenty
years hence--who's going to stand for it?"</p>

<p>"My dear young man," said Mr. Blythe, "conversion is our job. At
present our trade-unionists despise the outside world. They've never
seen it. Their philosophy is bounded by their smoky little streets.
But five million pounds spent on the organised travel of a hundred
thousand working men would do the trick in five years. It would
infect the working class with a feverish desire for a place in the
sun. The world is their children's for the taking. But who can blame
them, when they know nothing of it?"</p>

<p>"Some thought!" said Michael: "Only--what Government will think
it? Can I take those maps? . . . By the way," he said at the door,
"there are Societies, you know, for sending out children."</p>

<p>Mr. Blythe grunted. "Yes. Excellent little affairs! A few hundred
children doing well--concrete example of what might be. Multiply it a
hundredfold, and you've got a beginning. You can't fill pails with a
teaspoon. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Out on the Embankment Michael wondered if one could love one's
country with a passion for getting people to leave it. But this
over-bloated town condition, with its blight and smoky ugliness; the
children without a chance from birth; these swarms of poor devils
without work, who dragged about and hadn't an earthly, and never
would, on present lines; this unbalanced, hand-to-mouth, dependent
state of things--surely that wasn't to be for ever the state of the
country one loved! He stared at the towers of Westminster, with the
setting sun behind them. And there started up before him the thousand
familiars of his past--trees, fields and streams, towers, churches,
bridges; the English breeds of beasts, the singing birds, the owls,
the jays and rooks at Lippinghall, the little differences from
foreign sorts in shrub, flower, lichen, and winged life; the English
scents, the English haze, the English grass; the eggs and bacon; the
slow good humour, the moderation and the pluck; the smell of rain;
the apple-blossom, the heather, and the sea. His country, and his
breed--unspoilable at heart! He passed the Clock Tower. The House
looked lacy and imposing, more beautiful than fashion granted. Did
they spin the web of England's future in that House? Or were they
painting camouflage--a screen, over old England?</p>

<p>A familiar voice said: "This is a monstrous great thing!"</p>

<p>And Michael saw his father-in-law staring up at the Lincoln
statue. "What did they want to put it here for?" said Soames. "It's
not English." He walked along at Michael's side. "Fleur well?"</p>

<p>"Splendid. Italy suited her like everything."</p>

<p>Soames sniffed. "They're a theatrical lot," he said. "Did you see
Milan cathedral!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It's about the only thing we didn't take to."</p>

<p>"H'm! Their cooking gave me the collywobbles in '79. I dare say
it's better now. How's the boy?"</p>

<p>"A1, sir."</p>

<p>Soames made a sound of gratification, and they turned the corner
into South Square.</p>

<p>"What's this?" said Soames.</p>

<p>Outside the front door were two battered-looking trunks, a young
man, grasping a bag, and ringing the bell, and a taxicab turning
away.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you, sir," murmured Michael. "Unless it's the angel
Gabriel."</p>

<p>"He's got the wrong house," said Soames, moving forward.</p>

<p>But just then the young man disappeared within.</p>

<p>Soames walked up to the trunks. "Francis Wilmot," he read out.
"'S. S. Amphibian.' There's some mistake!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<br>


<h2>MERE CONVERSATION</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When they came in, Fleur was returning down-stairs from showing
the young man to his room. Already fully dressed for the evening, she
had but little on, and her hair was shingled. . . .</p>

<p>"My dear girl," Michael had said, when shingling came in, "to
please me, don't! Your <i>nuque</i> will be too bristly for
kisses."</p>

<p>"My dear boy," she had answered, "as if one could help it! You're
always the same with any new fashion!"</p>

<p>She had been one of the first twelve to shingle, and was just
feeling that without care she would miss being one of the first
twelve to grow some hair again. Marjorie Ferrar, 'the Pet of the
Panjoys,' as Michael called her, already had more than an inch.
Somehow, one hated being distanced by Marjorie Ferrar. . . .</p>

<p>Advancing to her father, she said:</p>

<p>"I've asked a young American to stay, Dad; Jon Forsyte has married
his sister, out there. You're quite brown, darling. How's
mother?"</p>

<p>Soames only gazed at her.</p>

<p>And Fleur passed through one of those shamed moments, when the
dumb quality of his love for her seemed accusing the glib quality of
her love for him. It was not fair--she felt--that he should look at
her like that; as if she had not suffered in that old business with
Jon more than he; if she could take it lightly now, surely he could!
As for Michael--not a word!--not even a joke! She bit her lips, shook
her shingled head, and passed into the 'bimetallic parlour.'</p>

<p>Dinner began with soup and Soames deprecating his own cows for not
being Herefords. He supposed that in America they had plenty of
Herefords?</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot believed that they were going in for Holsteins
now.</p>

<p>"Holsteins!" repeated Soames. "They're new since my young days.
What's their colour?"</p>

<p>"Parti-coloured," said Francis Wilmot. "The English grass is just
wonderful."</p>

<p>"Too damp, with us," said Soames. "We're on the river."</p>

<p>"The river Thames? What size will that be, where it hasn't a
tide?"</p>

<p>"Just there--not more than a hundred yards."</p>

<p>"Will it have fish?"</p>

<p>"Plenty."</p>

<p>"And it'll run clear--not red; our Southern rivers have a red
colour. And your trees will be willows, and poplars, and elms."</p>

<p>Soames was a good deal puzzled. He had never been in America. The
inhabitants were human, of course, but peculiar and all alike, with
more face than feature, heads fastened upright on their backs, and
shoulders too square to be real. Their voices clanged in their
mouths; they pronounced the words 'very' and 'America' in a way that
he had tried to imitate without success; their dollar was too high,
and they all had motor-cars; they despised Europe, came over in great
quantities, and took back all they could; they talked all the time,
and were not allowed to drink. This young man cut across all these
preconceptions. He drank sherry and only spoke when he was spoken to.
His shoulders looked natural; he had more feature than face; and his
voice was soft. Perhaps, at least, he despised Europe.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, "you find England very small."</p>

<p>"No, sir. I find London very large; and you certainly have the
loveliest kind of a countryside."</p>

<p>Soames looked down one side of his nose. "Pretty enough!" he
said.</p>

<p>Then came turbot and a silence, broken, low down, behind his
chair.</p>

<p>"That dog!" said Soames, impaling a morsel of fish he had set
aside as uneatable.</p>

<p>"No, no, Dad! He just wants to know you've seen him!"</p>

<p>Soames stretched down a finger, and the Dandie fell on his
side.</p>

<p>"He never eats," said Fleur; "but he has to be noticed."</p>

<p>A small covey of partridges came in, cooked.</p>

<p>"Is there any particular thing you want to see over here, Mr.
Wilmot?" said Michael. "There's nothing very un-American left. You're
just too late for Regent Street."</p>

<p>"I want to see the Beefeaters; and Cruft's Dog Show; and your
blood horses; and the Derby."</p>

<p>"Darby!" Soames corrected. "You can't stay for that--it's not till
next June."</p>

<p>"My cousin Val will show you race-horses," said Fleur. "He married
Jon's sister, you know."</p>

<p>A 'bombe' appeared. "You have more of this in America, I believe,"
said Soames.</p>

<p>"We don't have much ice-cream in the South, sir; but we have
special cooking--very tasty."</p>

<p>"I've heard of terrapin."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> don't get frills like that. I live away back, and
have to work pretty hard. My place is kind of homey; but I've got
some mighty nice darkies that can cook fine--old folk that knew my
grannies. The old-time darky is getting scarce, but he's the real
thing."</p>

<p>A Southerner!</p>

<p>Soames had been told that the Southerner was a gentleman. He
remembered the 'Alabama,' too; and his father, James, saying: "I told
you so" when the Government ate humble pie over that business.</p>

<p>In the savoury silence that accompanied soft roes on toast, the
patter of the Dandie's feet on the parquet floor could be plainly
heard.</p>

<p>"This is the only thing he likes," said Fleur, "Dan! go to your
master. Give him a little bit, Michael." And she stole a look at
Michael, but he did not answer it.</p>

<p>On their Italian holiday, with Fleur in the throes of novelty, sun
and wine warmed, disposed to junketing, amenable to his caresses, he
had been having his real honeymoon, enjoying, for the first time
since his marriage, a sense of being the chosen companion of his
adored. And now had come this stranger, bringing reminder that one
played but second fiddle to that young second cousin and first lover;
and he couldn't help feeling the cup withdrawn again from his lips.
She had invited this young man because he came from that past of hers
whose tune one could not play. And, without looking up, he fed the
Dandie with tid-bits of his favourite edible.</p>

<p>Soames broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Take some nutmeg, Mr. Wilmot. Melon without nutmeg--beats ginger
hollow."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When Fleur rose, Soames followed her to the drawing-room; while
Michael led the young American to his study.</p>

<p>"You knew Jon?" said Francis Wilmot.</p>

<p>"No; I never met him."</p>

<p>"He's a great little fellow; and some poet. He's growing dandy
peaches."</p>

<p>"Is he going on with that, now he's married?"</p>

<p>"Surely."</p>

<p>"Not coming to England?"</p>

<p>"Not this year. They have a nice home--horses and dogs. They have
some hunting there, too. Perhaps he'll bring my sister over for a
trip, next fall."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Michael. "And are you staying long, yourself?"</p>

<p>"Why! I'll go back for Christmas. I'd like to see Rome and
Seville; and I want to visit the old home of my people, down in
Worcestershire."</p>

<p>"When did they go over?"</p>

<p>"William and Mary. Catholics--they were. Is it a nice part,
Worcestershire?"</p>

<p>"Very; especially in the Spring. It grows a lot of fruit."</p>

<p>"Oh! You still grow things in this country?"</p>

<p>"Not many."</p>

<p>"I thought that was so, coming on the cars, from Liverpool. I saw
a lot of grass and one or two sheep, but I didn't see anybody
working. The people all live in the towns, then?"</p>

<p>"Except a few unconsidered trifles. You must come down to my
father's; they still grow a turnip or two thereabouts."</p>

<p>"It's sad," said Francis Wilmot.</p>

<p>"It is. We began to grow wheat again in the war; but they've let
it all slip back--and worse."</p>

<p>"Why was that?"</p>

<p>Michael shrugged his shoulders: "No accounting for statesmanship.
It lets the Land go to blazes when in office; and beats the drum of
it when in opposition. At the end of the war we had the best air
force in the world, and agriculture was well on its way to recovery.
And what did they do? Dropped them both like hot potatoes. It was
tragic. What do you grow in Carolina?"</p>

<p>"Just cotton, on my place. But it's mighty hard to make cotton pay
nowadays. Labour's high."</p>

<p>"High with you, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Do they let strangers into your Parliament?"</p>

<p>"Rather. Would you like to hear the Irish debate? I can get you a
seat in the Distinguished Strangers' gallery."</p>

<p>"I thought the English were stiff; but it's wonderful the way you
make me feel at home. Is that your father-in-law--the old
gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He seems kind of rarefied. Is he a banker?"</p>

<p>"No. But now you mention it--he ought to be."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot's eyes roved round the room and came to rest on
"The White Monkey."</p>

<p>"Well, now," he said, softly, "that, surely, is a wonderful
picture. Could I get a picture painted by that man, for Jon and my
sister?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," said Michael. "You see, he was a Chink--not
quite of the best period; but he must have gone West five hundred
years ago at least."</p>

<p>"Ah! Well, he had a great sense of animals."</p>

<p>"We think he had a great sense of human beings."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot stared.</p>

<p>There was something, Michael decided, in this young man
unresponsive to satire.</p>

<p>"So you want to see Cruft's Dog Show?" he said. "You're keen on
dogs, then?"</p>

<p>"I'll be taking a bloodhound back for Jon, and two for myself. I
want to raise bloodhounds."</p>

<p>Michael leaned back, and blew out smoke. To Francis Wilmot, he
felt, the world was young, and life running on good tires to some
desirable destination. In England--!</p>

<p>"What is it you Americans want out of life?" he said abruptly.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you might say we want success--in the North at
all events."</p>

<p><i>"We</i> wanted that in 1824," said Michael.</p>

<p>"Oh! And nowadays?"</p>

<p>"We've had success, and now we're wondering whether it hasn't
cooked our goose."</p>

<p>"Well," said Francis Wilmot, "we're sort of thinly populated,
compared with you."</p>

<p>"That's it," said Michael. "Every seat here is booked in advance;
and a good many sit on their own knees. Will you have another cigar,
or shall we join the lady?"</p>

<br>


<h2>SIDE-SLIPS</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>If Providence was completely satisfied with Sapper's Row, Camden
Town, Michael was not. What could justify those twin dismal rows of
three-storied houses, so begrimed that they might have been collars
washed in Italy? What possible attention to business could make these
little ground-floor shops do anything but lose money? From the
thronged and tram-lined thoroughfare so pregnantly scented with fried
fish, petrol and old clothes, who would turn into this small back
water for sweetness or for profit? Even the children, made with
heroic constancy on its second and third floors, sought the sweets of
life outside its precincts; for in Sapper's Row they could neither be
run over nor stare at the outside of Cinemas. Hand-carts, bicycles,
light vans which had lost their nerve and taxicabs which had lost
their way, provided all the traffic; potted geraniums and spotted
cats supplied all the beauty. Sapper's Row drooped and dithered.</p>

<p>Michael entered from its west end, and against his principles.
Here was overcrowded England, at its most dismal, and here was he,
who advocated a reduction of its population, about to visit some
broken-down aliens with the view of keeping them alive. He looked
into three of the little shops. Not a soul! Which was worst? Such
little shops frequented, or--deserted? He came to No. 12, and,
looking up, saw a face looking down. It was wax white, movingly
listless, above a pair of hands sewing at a garment. 'That,' he
thought, 'is my "obedient humble" and her needle.' He entered the
shop below, a hair-dresser's, containing a dirty basin below a dusty
mirror, suspicious towels, bottles, and two dingy chairs. In his
shirt-sleeves, astride one of them, reading <i>The Daily Mail,</i>
sat a shadowy fellow with pale hollow cheeks, twisted moustache, lank
hair, and the eyes, at once knowing and tragic, of a philosopher.</p>

<p>"Hair cut, sir?"</p>

<p>Michael shook his head.</p>

<p>"Do Mr. and Mrs. Bergfeld live here?"</p>

<p>"Up-stairs, top floor."</p>

<p>"How do I get up?"</p>

<p>"Through there."</p>

<p>Passing through a curtained aperture, Michael found a stairway,
and at its top, stood, hesitating. His conscience was echoing Fleur's
comment on Anna Bergfeld's letter: "Yes, I dare say; but what's the
good?" when the door was opened, and it seemed to him almost as if a
corpse were standing there, with a face as though some one had come
knocking on its grave, so eager and so white.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bergfeld? My name's Mont. You wrote to me."</p>

<p>The woman trembled so, that Michael thought she was going to
faint.</p>

<p>"Will you excuse me, sir, that I sit down?" And she dropped on to
the end of the bed. The room was spotless, but, besides the bed, held
only a small deal wash-stand, a pot of geranium, a tin trunk with a
pair of trousers folded on it, a woman's hat on a peg, and a chair in
the window covered with her sewing.</p>

<p>The woman stood up again. She seemed not more than thirty, thin
but prettily formed; and her oval face, without colour except in her
dark eyes, suggested Rafael rather than Sapper's Row.</p>

<p>"It is like seeing an angel," she said. "Excuse me, sir."</p>

<p>"Queer angel, Mrs. Bergfeld. Your husband not in?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Fritz has gone to walk."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mrs. Bergfeld. If I pay your passages to Germany, will
you go?"</p>

<p>"We cannot hope from that now, Fritz has been here twenty years,
and never back; he has lost his German nationality, sir; they do not
want people like us, you know."</p>

<p>Michael stivered up his hair.</p>

<p>"Where are you from yourself?"</p>

<p>"From Salzburg."</p>

<p>"What about going back there?"</p>

<p>"I would like to, but what would we do? In Austria every one is
poor now, and I have no relative left. Here at least we have my
sewing."</p>

<p>"How much is that a week?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes a pound; sometimes fifteen shillings. It is bread and
the rent."</p>

<p>"Don't you get the dole?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. We are not registered."</p>

<p>Michael took out a five-pound note and laid it with his card on
the wash-stand. "I've got to think this over, Mrs. Bergfeld. Perhaps
your husband will come and see me." He went out quickly, for the
ghostly woman had flushed pink.</p>

<p>Repassing through the curtained aperture, he caught the
hair-dresser wiping out the basin.</p>

<p>"Find em in, sir?"</p>

<p>"The lady."</p>

<p>"Ah! Seen better days, I should say. The 'usband's a queer
customer; 'alf off his nut. Wanted to come in here with me, but I've
got to give this job up."</p>

<p>"Oh! How's that?"</p>

<p>"I've got to have fresh air--only got one lung, and that's not
very gaudy. I'll have to find something else."</p>

<p>"That's bad, in these days."</p>

<p>The hair-dresser shrugged his bony shoulders. "Ah!" he said. "I've
been a hair-dresser from a boy, except for the war. Funny place this,
to fetch up in after where I've been. The war knocked me out." He
twisted his little thin moustache.</p>

<p>"No pension?" said Michael.</p>

<p>"Not a bob. What I want to keep me alive is something in the
open."</p>

<p>Michael took him in from head to foot. Shadowy, narrow-headed,
with one lung.</p>

<p>"But do you know anything about country life?"</p>

<p>"Not a blessed thing. Still, I've got to find something, or peg
out."</p>

<p>His tragic and knowing eyes searched Michael's face.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," said Michael. "Good-bye!"</p>

<p>The hair-dresser made a queer jerky little movement.</p>

<p>Emerging from Sapper's Row into the crowded, roaring thoroughfare,
Michael thought of a speech in a play he had seen a year or two
before. "The condition of the people leaves much to be desired. I
shall make a point of taking up the cudgels in the House. I shall
move--!" The condition of the people! What a remote thing! The
sportive nightmare of a few dreaming nights, the skeleton in a
well-locked cupboard, the discomforting rare howl of a hungry dog!
And probably no folk in England less disturbed by it than the gallant
six hundred odd who sat with him in 'that House.' For to improve the
condition of the people was their job, and that relieved them of a
sense of nightmare. Since Oliver Cromwell some sixteen thousand,
perhaps, had sat there before them, to the same end. And was the
trick done--not bee likely! Still <i>they</i> were really working for
it, and other people were only looking on and telling them how to do
it!</p>

<p>Thus was he thinking when a voice said:</p>

<p>"Not got a job about you, sir?"</p>

<p>Michael quickened his steps, then stood still. He saw that the man
who had spoken, having cast his eyes down again, had missed this sign
of weakness; and he went back to him. They were black eyes in a face
round and pasty like a mince pie. Decent and shabby, quiet and
forlorn, he wore an ex-Service-man's badge.</p>

<p>"You spoke to me?" said Michael.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know why, sir; it just hopped out of me."</p>

<p>"No work?"</p>

<p>"No; and pretty low."</p>

<p>"Married?"</p>

<p>"Widower, sir; two children."</p>

<p>"Dole?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and fair sick of it."</p>

<p>"In the war, I see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mespot."</p>

<p>"What sort of job do you want?"</p>

<p>"Any mortal thing."</p>

<p>"Give me your name and address."</p>

<p>"Henry Boddick, 94 Waltham Buildings, Gunnersbury."</p>

<p>Michael took it down.</p>

<p>"Can't promise anything," he said.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Good luck, anyway. Have a cigar?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, and good luck to you, sir."</p>

<p>Michael saluted, and resumed his progress; once out of sight of
Henry Boddick, he took a taxi. A little more of this, and he would
lose the sweet reasonableness without which one could not sit in
'that House'!</p>

<p>'For Sale or to Let' recorded recurrently in Portland Place,
somewhat restored his sense of balance.</p>

<p>That same afternoon he took Francis Wilmot with him to the House,
and leaving him at the foot of the Distinguished Strangers' stairway,
made his way on to the floor.</p>

<p>He had never been in Ireland, so that the debate had for him
little relation to reality. It seemed to illustrate, however, the
obstacles in the way of agreement on any mortal subject. Almost every
speech emphasized the paramount need for a settlement, but declared
the impossibility of 'going back' on this, that, or the other factor
which precluded such settlement. Still, for a debate on Ireland it
seemed good-tempered; and presently they would all go out and record
the votes they had determined on before it all began. He remembered
the thrill with which he had listened to the first debates after his
election; the impression each speech had given him that somebody must
certainly be converted to something; and the reluctance with which he
had discovered that nobody ever was. Some force was at work far
stronger than any eloquence, however striking or sincere. The clothes
were washed elsewhere; in here they were but aired before being put
on. Still, until people put thoughts into words, they didn't know
what they thought, and sometimes they didn't know afterwards. And for
the hundredth time Michael was seized by a weak feeling in his legs.
In a few weeks he himself must rise on them. Would the House accord
him its 'customary indulgence'; or would it say: 'Young
fellow--teaching your grandmother to suck eggs--shut up!'</p>

<p>He looked around him.</p>

<p>His fellow members were sitting in all shapes. Chosen of the
people, they confirmed the doctrine that human nature did not change,
or so slowly that one could not see the process--he had seen their
prototypes in Roman statues, in mediaeval pictures. . . . 'Plain but
pleasant,' he thought, unconsciously reproducing George Forsyte's
description of himself in his palmy days. But did they take
themselves seriously, as under Burke, as under Gladstone even?</p>

<p>The words 'customary indulgence' roused him from reverie; for they
meant a maiden speech. Ha! yes! The member for Cornmarket. He
composed himself to listen. Delivering himself with restraint and
clarity, the speaker seemed suggesting that the doctrine 'Do unto
others as you would they should do unto you' need not be entirely
neglected, even in Ireland; but it was long--too long--Michael
watched the House grow restive. 'Alas! poor brother!' he thought, as
the speaker somewhat hastily sat down. A very handsome man rose in
his place. He congratulated his honourable friend on his able and
well-delivered effort, he only regretted that it had nothing to do
with the business in hand. Exactly! Michael slipped out. Recovering
his 'distinguished stranger,' he walked away with him to South
Square.</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot was in a state of some enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"That was fine," he said. "Who was the gentleman under the
curtains?"</p>

<p>"The Speaker?"</p>

<p>"No; I mean the one who didn't speak."</p>

<p>"Exactly; he's the dignity of the House."</p>

<p>"They ought to feed him oxygen; it must be sleepy under there. I
liked the delegate who spoke last but one. He would 'go' in America;
he had big ideas."</p>

<p>"The idealism which keeps you out of the League of Nations, eh?"
said Michael with a grin.</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot turned his head rather sharply.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "we're like any other people when it comes down
to bed-rock."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Michael. "Idealism is just a by-product of
geography--it's the haze that lies in the middle distance. The
farther you are from bed-rock, the less quick you need be to see it.
We're twenty sea-miles more idealistic about the European situation
than the French are. And you're three thousand sea-miles more
idealistic than we are. But when it's a matter of niggers, we're
three thousand sea-miles more idealistic than you; isn't that
so?"</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot narrowed his dark eyes.</p>

<p>"It is," he said. "The farther North we go in the States, the more
idealistic we get about the negro. Anne and I've lived all our life
with darkies, and never had trouble; we love them, and they love us;
but I wouldn't trust myself not to join in lynching one that laid his
hands on her. I've talked that over many times with Jon. He doesn't
see it that way; he says a darky should be tried like a white man;
but he doesn't know the real South. His mind is still three thousand
sea-miles away."</p>

<p>Michael was silent. Something within him always closed up at
mention of a name which he still spelt mentally with an h.</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot added ruminatively: "There are a few saints in
every country proof against your theory; but the rest of us, I
reckon, aren't above human nature."</p>

<p>"Talking of human nature," said Michael, "here's my
father-in-law!"</p>

<br>


<h2>SOAMES KEEPS HIS EYES OPEN</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Soames, having prolonged his week-end visit, had been spending the
afternoon at the Zoological Gardens, removing his great-nephews, the
little Cardigans, from the too close proximity of monkeys and cats.
After standing them once more in Imogen's hall, he had roosted at his
Club till, idly turning his evening paper, he had come on this
paragraph, in the "Chiff-chaff" column:</p>

<p>"A surprise for the coming Session is being confectioned at the
Wednesday gatherings of a young hostess not a hundred miles from
Westminster. Her husband, a prospective baronet lately connected with
literature, is to be entrusted with the launching in Parliament of a
policy which enjoys the peculiar label of Foggartism, derived from
Sir James Foggart's book called "The Parlous State of England." This
amusing alarum is attributed to the somewhat fantastic brain which
guides a well-known weekly. We shall see what comes of it. In the
meantime the enterprising little lady in question is losing no chance
of building up her 'salon' on the curiosity which ever surrounds any
buccaneering in politics."</p>

<p>Soames rubbed his eyes; then read it again with rising anger.
'Enterprising little lady is losing no chance of building up her
"salon."' Who had written that? He put the paper in his
pocket--almost the first theft he had ever committed--and all the way
across St. James's Park in the gathering twilight he brooded on that
anonymous paragraph. The allusion seemed to him unmistakable, and
malicious into the bargain. 'Lion-hunter' would not have been
plainer. Unfortunately, in a primary sense 'lion-hunter' was a
compliment, and Soames doubted whether its secondary sense had ever
been 'laid down' as libellous. He was still brooding deeply, when the
young men ranged alongside.</p>

<p>"Well, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Soames. "I want to speak to you. You've got a traitor
in the camp." And, without meaning to at all, he looked angrily at
Francis Wilmot.</p>

<p>"Now, sir?" said Michael, when they were in his study.</p>

<p>Soames held out the folded paper.</p>

<p>Michael read the paragraph and made a face.</p>

<p>"Whoever wrote that comes to your evenings," said Soames; "that's
clear. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Very likely a she."</p>

<p>"D'you mean to say they print such things by women?"</p>

<p>Michael did not answer. Old Forsyte was behind the times.</p>

<p>"Will they tell me who it is, if I go down to them?" asked
Soames.</p>

<p>"No, fortunately."</p>

<p>"How d'you mean 'fortunately'?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, the Press is a sensitive plant. I'm afraid you might
make it curl up. Besides, it's always saying nice things that aren't
deserved."</p>

<p>"But this--" began Soames; he stopped in time, and substituted:
"Do you mean that we've got to sit down under it?"</p>

<p>"To lie down, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Fleur has an evening to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I shall stay up for it, and keep my eyes open."</p>

<p>Michael had a vision of his father-in-law, like a plainclothes man
in the neighbourhood of wedding-presents.</p>

<p>But in spite of assumed levity, Michael had been hit. The
knowledge that his adored one had the collector's habit, and flitted,
alluring, among the profitable, had, so far, caused him only
indulgent wonder. But now it seemed more than an amusing foible. The
swiftness with which she turned her smile off and on as though
controlled by a switch under her shingled hair; the quick turns of
her neck, so charming and exposed; the clever roving, disguised so
well but not quite well enough, of the pretty eyes; the droop and
flutter of their white lids; the expressive hands grasping, if one
could so call such slim and dainty apprehensions, her career--all
this suddenly caused Michael pain. Still she was doing it for him and
Kit! French women, they said, co-operated with their husbands in the
family career. It was the French blood in her. Or perhaps just
idealism, the desire to have and be the best of whatever bunch there
was about! Thus Michael, loyally. But his uneasy eyes roved from face
to face of the Wednesday gathering, trying to detect signs of
quizzicality.</p>

<p>Soames followed another method. His mind, indeed, was
uncomplicated by the currents awash in that of one who goes to bed
with the object of his criticism. For him there was no reason why
Fleur should not know as many aristocrats, Labour members, painters,
ambassadors, young fools, and even writing fellows, as might flutter
her fancy. The higher up they were, the less likely, he thought with
a certain na&iuml;vet&eacute; would they be to borrow money or get
her into a mess. His daughter was as good or better than any of them,
and his deep pride was stung to the quick by the notion that people
should think she had to claw and scrape to get them round her. It was
not she who was after them, but they who were after her! Standing
under the Fragonard which he had given her, grizzled, neatly
moustached, close-faced, chinny, with a gaze concentrated on nothing
in particular, as of one who has looked over much and found little in
it, he might have been one of her ambassadors.</p>

<p>A young woman, with red-gold hair, about an inch long on her
de-shingled neck, came and stood with her back to him, beside a soft
man, who kept washing his hands. Soames could hear every word of
their talk.</p>

<p>"Isn't the little Mont amusing? Look at her now, with 'Don
Fernando'--you'd think he was her only joy. Ah! There's young Rashly!
Off she goes. She's a born little snob. But that doesn't make this a
'salon,' as she thinks. To found a 'salon' you want personality, and
wit, and the 'don't care a damn' spirit. She hasn't got a scrap.
Besides, who is she?"</p>

<p>"Money?" said the soft man.</p>

<p>"Not so very much. Michael's such dead nuts on her that he's
getting dull; though it's partly Parliament, of course. Have you
heard them talk this Foggartism? All food, children, and the
future--the very dregs of dulness."</p>

<p>"Novelty," purred the soft man, "is the vice of our age."</p>

<p>"One resents a nobody like her climbing in on piffle like this
Foggartism. Did you read the book?"</p>

<p>"Hardly. Did you?"</p>

<p>"No jolly fear! I'm sorry for Michael. He's being exploited by
that little snob."</p>

<p>Penned without an outlet, Soames had begun breathing hard. Feeling
a draught, perhaps, the young woman turned to encounter a pair of
eyes so grey, so cold, in a face so concentrated, that she moved
away. "Who was that old buffer?" she asked of the soft man; "he gave
me 'the jim-jams.'"</p>

<p>The soft man thought it might be a poor relation--he didn't seem
to know anybody.</p>

<p>But Soames had already gone across to Michael.</p>

<p>"Who's that young woman with the red hair?"</p>

<p>"Marjorie Ferrar."</p>

<p>"She's the traitress--turn her out!"</p>

<p>Michael stared.</p>

<p>"But we know her quite well--she's a daughter of Lord Charles
Ferrar, and--"</p>

<p>"Turn her out!" said Soames again.</p>

<p>"How do you know that she's the traitress, sir?"</p>

<p>"I've just heard her use the very words of that paragraph, and
worse."</p>

<p>"But she's our guest."</p>

<p>"Pretty guest!" growled Soames through his teeth.</p>

<p>"One can't turn a guest out. Besides, she's the grand-daughter of
a marquess and the pet of the Panjoys--it would make the deuce of a
scandal."</p>

<p>"Make it, then!"</p>

<p>"We won't ask her again; but really, that's all one can do."</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Soames; and walking past his son-in-law, he went
towards the object of his denunciation. Michael followed, much
perturbed. He had never yet seen his father-in-law with his teeth
bared. He arrived in time to hear him say in a low but quite audible
voice:</p>

<p>"You were good enough, madam, to call my daughter a snob in her
own house."</p>

<p>Michael saw the de-shingled neck turn and rear, the hard blue eyes
stare with a sort of outraged impudence; he heard her laugh, then
Soames saying:</p>

<p>"You are a traitress; be so kind as to withdraw."</p>

<p>Of the half-dozen people round, not a soul was missing it! Oh,
hell! And he the master of the house! Stepping forward, he put his
arm through that of Soames:</p>

<p>"That'll do, sir," he said, quietly; "this is not a Peace
Conference."</p>

<p>There was a horrid hush; and in all the group only the soft man's
white hands, washing each other, moved.</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar took a step towards the door.</p>

<p>"I don't know who this person is," she said; "but he's a
liar."</p>

<p>"I reckon not."</p>

<p>At the edge of the little group was a dark young man. His eyes
were fixed on Marjorie Ferrar's, whose eyes in turn were fixed on
his.</p>

<p>And, suddenly, Michael saw Fleur, very pale, standing just behind
him. She must have heard it all! She smiled, waved her hand, and
said:</p>

<p>"Madame Carelli's going to play."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar walked on towards the door, and the soft man
followed her, still washing those hands, as if trying to rid them of
the incident. Soames, like a slow dog making sure, walked after them;
Michael walked after him. The words "How amusing!" floated back, and
a soft echoing snigger. Slam! Both outer door and incident were
closed.</p>

<p>Michael wiped his forehead. One half of the brain behind admired
his father-in-law; the other thought: 'Well, the old man <i>has</i>
gone and done it!' He went back into the drawing-room. Fleur was
standing near the clavichord, as if nothing had happened. But Michael
could see her fingers crisping at her dress; and his heart felt sore.
He waited, quivering, for the last chord.</p>

<p>Soames had gone up-stairs. Before "The White Monkey" in Michael's
study, he reviewed his own conduct. He regretted nothing. Red-headed
cat! 'Born snob!' 'Money? Not very much.' Ha! 'A nobody like her!'
Grand-daughter of a marquess, was she? Well, he had shown the
insolent baggage the door. All that was sturdy in his fibre, all that
was acrid in his blood, all that resented patronage and privilege,
the inherited spirit of his forefathers, moved within him. Who were
the aristocracy, to give themselves airs? Jackanapes! Half of 'em
descendants of those who had got what they had by robbery or jobbery!
That one of them should call his daughter, <i>his</i> daughter, a
snob! He wouldn't lift a finger, wouldn't cross a road, to meet the
Duke of Seven Dials himself! If Fleur liked to amuse herself by
having people round her, why shouldn't she? His blood ran suddenly a
little cold. Would she say that he had spoiled her 'salon'? Well! He
couldn't help it if she did; better to have had the thing out, and
got rid of that cat, and know where they all were. 'I shan't wait up
for her,' he thought. 'Storm in a teacup!'</p>

<p>The thin strumming of the clavichord came up to him out on the
landing, waiting to climb to his room. He wondered if these evenings
woke the baby. A gruff sound at his feet made him jump. That dog
lying outside the baby's door! He wished the little beggar had been
down-stairs just now--he would have known how to put his teeth
through that red-haired cat's nude stockings. He passed on up,
looking at Francis Wilmot's door, which was opposite his own.</p>

<p>That young American chap must have overheard something too; but he
shouldn't allude to the matter with him; not dignified. And, shutting
his door on the strumming of the clavichord, Soames closed his eyes
again as best he could.</p>

<h2>SOUNDS IN THE NIGHT</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Michael had never heard Fleur cry, and to see her, flung down
across the bed, smothering her sobs in the quilt, gave him a feeling
akin to panic. She stopped at his touch on her hair, and lay
still.</p>

<p>"Buck up, darling!" he said, gently. "If you aren't one, what does
it matter?"</p>

<p>She struggled up, and sat cross-legged, her flushed face smudged
with tears, her hair disordered.</p>

<p>"Who cares what one is? It's what one's labelled."</p>

<p>"Well, we've labelled her 'Traitress.'"</p>

<p>"As if that made it better! We all talk behind people's backs. Who
minds that? But how can I go on when everybody is sniggering and
thinking me a lion-hunting snob? She'll cry it all over London in
revenge. How can I have any more evenings?"</p>

<p>Was it for her career, or his, that she was sorrowing? Michael
went round to the other side of the bed and put his arms about her
from behind.</p>

<p>"Never mind what people think, my child. Sooner or later one's got
to face that anyway."</p>

<p>"It's you who aren't facing it. If I'm not thought nice, I can't
<i>be</i> nice."</p>

<p>"Only the people who really know one matter."</p>

<p>"Nobody knows one," said Fleur, sullenly. "The fonder they are,
the less they know, and the less it matters what they think."</p>

<p>Michael withdrew his arms.</p>

<p>She sat silent for so long that he went back to the other side of
the bed to see if he could tell anything from her face resting
moodily on her hands. The grace of her body thus cramped was such
that his senses ached. And since caresses would only worry her, they
ached the more.</p>

<p>"I hate her," she said, at last; "and if I can hurt her, I
will."</p>

<p>He would have liked to hurt the 'pet of the Panjoys' himself, but
it did not console him to hear Fleur utter that sentiment; it meant
more from her than from himself, who, when it came to the point, was
a poor hand at hurting people.</p>

<p>"Well, darling," he said, "shall we sleep on it?"</p>

<p>"I said I wouldn't have any more evenings; but I shall."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Michael; "that's the spirit."</p>

<p>She laughed. It was a funny hard little sound in the night. And
with it Michael had to remain discontented.</p>

<p>All through the house it was a wakeful night. Soames had the three
o'clock tremors, which cigars and the fresh air wherein he was
obliged to play his golf had subdued for some time past. He was
disturbed, too, by that confounded great clock from hour to hour, and
by a stealthy noise between three and four, as of some one at large
in the house.</p>

<p>This was, in fact, Francis Wilmot. Ever since his impulsive denial
that Soames was a liar, the young man had been in a peculiar state of
mind. As Soames surmised, he too had overheard Marjorie Ferrar
slandering her hostess; but in the very moment of his refutation,
like Saul setting forth to attack the Christians, he had been smitten
by blindness. Those blue eyes, pouring into his the light of
defiance, had finished with a gleam which seemed to say: 'Young man,
you please me!' And it haunted him. That lissome nymph--with her
white skin and red-gold hair, her blue eyes full of insolence, her
red lips full of joy, her white neck fragrant as a pine-wood in
sunshine--the vision was abiding. He had been watching her all
through the evening; but it was uncanny the way she had left her
image on his senses in that one long moment, so that now he got no
sleep. Though he had not been introduced, he knew her name to be
Marjorie Ferrar, and he thought it 'fine.' Countryman that he was and
with little knowledge of women--she was unlike any woman he had
known. And he had given her the lie direct! This made him so restless
that he drank the contents of his water-bottle, put on his clothes,
and stole down-stairs. Passing the Dandie, who stirred as though
muttering: 'Unusual! But I know those legs!' he reached the hall,
where a milky glimmer came in through the fanlight. Lighting a
cigarette, he sat down on the marble coat-sarcophagus. It cooled his
anatomy, so that he got off it, turned up the light, saw a telephone
directory resting beside him, and mechanically sought the letter 'F.'
There she was! "Ferrar, Marjorie, 3, River Studios, Wren Street."
Switching off the light, he slipped back the door-chain, and stole
out. He knew his way to the river, and went towards it.</p>

<p>It was the hour when sound, exhausted, has trailed away, and one
can hear a moth pass. London, in clear air, with no smoke going up,
slept beneath the moon. Bridges, towers, water, all silvered, had a
look as if withdrawn from man. Even the houses and the trees enjoyed
their moony hour apart, and seemed to breathe out with Francis Wilmot
a stanza from "The Ancient Mariner":</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>'O Sleep, it is a gentle thing,<br>
 Beloved from pole to pole!<br>
 To Mary Queen the praise be given,<br>
 She sent the gentle sleep from heaven<br>
 That slid into my soul!'</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>He turned at random to the right along the river. Never in his
life had he walked through a great city at the dead hour. Not a
passion alive, nor a thought of gain; haste asleep, and terrors
dreaming; here and there would be one turning on his bed; perchance a
soul passing. Down on the water lighters and barges lay shadowy and
abandoned, with red lights burning; the lamps along the Embankment
shone without purpose, as if they had been freed. Man was away. In
the whole town only himself up and doing--what? Natively shrewd and
resourceful in all active situations, the young Southerner had little
power of diagnosis, and certainly did not consider himself ridiculous
wandering about like this at night, not even when he suddenly felt
that if he could 'locate' her windows, he could go home and sleep. He
passed the Tate Gallery and saw a human being with moonlit
buttons.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, officer," he said, "but where is Wren Street?"</p>

<p>"Straight on and fifth to the right."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot resumed his march. The 'moving' moon was heeling
down, the stars were gaining light, the trees had begun to shiver. He
found the fifth turning, walked down 'the block,' and was no wiser;
it was too dark to read names or numbers. He passed another buttoned
human effigy and said:</p>

<p>"Pardon me, officer, but where are River Studios?"</p>

<p>"Comin' away from them; last house on the right."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot retraced his steps. There it was, then--by itself,
back from the street. He stood before it and gazed at dark windows.
She might be behind any one of them! Well! He had 'located' her; and,
in the rising wind, he turned and walked home. He went up-stairs
stealthily as he had come down, past the Dandie, who again raised his
head, muttered: 'Still more unusual, but the same legs!' entered his
room, lay down, and fell asleep like a baby.</p>

<p> </p>

<br>


<h2>ROUND AND ABOUT</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>General reticence at breakfast concerning the incident of the
night before, made little impression on Soames, because the young
American was present, before whom, naturally, one would not discuss
it; but he noted that Fleur was pale. In his early-morning vigil
legal misgivings had assailed him. Could one call even a red-haired
baggage 'traitress' in the hearing of some half-dozen persons with
impunity? He went off to his sister Winifred's after breakfast, and
told her the whole story.</p>

<p>"Quite right, my dear boy," was her comment. "They tell me that
young woman is as fast as they're made. Her father, you know, owned
the horse that didn't beat the French horse--I never can remember its
name--in that race, the Something Stakes, at--dear me! what was the
meeting?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about racing," said Soames.</p>

<p>But that afternoon at 'The Connoisseurs Club' a card was brought
to him:</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<p>LORD CHARLES FERRAR</p>

<p>High Marshes,</p>

<p>Nr. Newmarket. Burton's Club.</p>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>For a moment his knees felt a little weak; but the word 'snob'
coming to his assistance, he said drily: "Show him into the
strangers' room." He was not going to hurry himself for this fellow,
and finished his tea before repairing to that forlorn corner.</p>

<p>A tallish man was standing in the middle of the little room, thin
and upright, with a moustache brushed arrogantly off his lips, and a
single eyeglass which seemed to have grown over the right eye, so
unaided was it. There were corrugations in his thin weathered cheeks,
and in his thick hair flecked at the sides with grey. Soames had no
difficulty in disliking him at sight.</p>

<p>"Mr. Forsyte, I believe?"</p>

<p>Soames inclined his head.</p>

<p>"You made use of an insulting word to my daughter last night in
the presence of several people."</p>

<p>"Yes; it was richly deserved."</p>

<p>"You were not drunk, then?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Soames.</p>

<p>His dry precision seemed to disconcert the visitor, who twisted
his moustache, frowned his eyeglass closer to his eye, and said:</p>

<p>"I have the names of those who overheard it. You will be good
enough to write to each of them separately withdrawing your
expression unreservedly."</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the kind."</p>

<p>A moment's silence ensued.</p>

<p>"You are an attorney, I believe?"</p>

<p>"A solicitor."</p>

<p>"Then you know the consequences of refusal."</p>

<p>"If your daughter likes to go into Court, I shall be happy to meet
her there."</p>

<p>"You refuse to withdraw?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Good evening, then!"</p>

<p>"Good evening!"</p>

<p>For two pins he would have walked round the fellow, the bristles
rising on his back, but, instead, he stood a little to one side to
let him out. Insolent brute! He could so easily hear again the voice
of old Uncle Jolyon, characterising some person of the eighties as 'a
pettifogging little attorney.' And he felt that, somehow or other, he
must relieve his mind. 'Old Mont' would know about this fellow--he
would go across and ask him.</p>

<p>At 'The Aeroplane' he found not only Sir Lawrence Mont, looking
almost grave, but Michael, who had evidently been detailing to his
father last evening's incident. This was a relief to Soames, who felt
the insults to his daughter too bitterly to talk of them. Describing
the visit he had just received, he ended with the words:</p>

<p>"This fellow--Ferrar--what's his standing?"</p>

<p>"Charlie Ferrar? He owes money everywhere, has some useful horses,
and is a very good shot."</p>

<p>"He didn't strike me as a gentleman," said Soames.</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence cocked his eyebrow, as if debating whether he ought
to answer this remark about one who had ancestors, from one who had
none.</p>

<p>"And his daughter," said Soames, "isn't a lady."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence wagged his head.</p>

<p>"Single-minded, Forsyte, single-minded; but you're right; there's
a queer streak in that blood. Old Shropshire's a dear old man; it
skipped his generation, but it's there--it's there. His aunt--"</p>

<p>"He called me an attorney," said Soames with a grim smile, "and
she called me a liar. I don't know which is worse."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence got up and looked into St. James's Street. Soames had
the feeling that the narrow head perched up on that straight thin
back counted for more than his own, in this affair. One was dealing
here with people who said and did what they liked and damned the
consequences; this baronet chap had been brought up in that way
himself, no doubt, he ought to know how their minds worked.</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence turned.</p>

<p>"She may bring an action, Forsyte; it was very public. What
evidence have you?"</p>

<p>"My own ears."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence looked at the ears, as if to gauge their length.</p>

<p>"M'm! Anything else?"</p>

<p>"That paragraph."</p>

<p>"She'll get at the paper. Yes?"</p>

<p>"The man she was talking to."</p>

<p>Michael ejaculated: "Philip Quinsey--put not your trust in
Gath!"</p>

<p>"What more?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Soames, "there's what that young American overheard,
whatever it was."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Sir Lawrence: "Take care she doesn't get at <i>him.</i>
Is that all?"</p>

<p>Soames nodded. It didn't seem much, now he came to think of
it!</p>

<p>"You say she called you a liar. How would it be to take the
offensive?"</p>

<p>There was a silence; then Soames said: "Women? No!"</p>

<p>"Quite right, Forsyte! They have their privileges still. There's
nothing for it but to wait and see how the cat jumps. Traitress! I
suppose you know how much the word costs?"</p>

<p>"The cost," said Soames, "is nothing; it's the publicity!"</p>

<p>His imagination was playing streets ahead of him. He saw himself
already in 'the box,' retailing the spiteful purrings of that cat,
casting forth to the public and the papers the word 'snob,' of his
own daughter; for if he didn't, he would have no defence. Too
painful!</p>

<p>"What does Fleur say?" he asked, suddenly, of Michael.</p>

<p>"War to the knife."</p>

<p>Soames jumped in his chair.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said: "That's a woman all over--no imagination!"</p>

<p>"That's what I thought at first, sir, but I'm not so sure. She
says if Marjorie Ferrar is not taken by the short hairs, she'll put
it across everybody--and that the more public the thing is, the less
harm she can do."</p>

<p>"I think," said Sir Lawrence, coming back to his chair, "I'll go
and see old Shropshire. My father and his shot woodcock together in
Albania in 'fifty-four."</p>

<p>Soames could not see the connection, but did not snub the
proposal. A marquess was a sort of gone-off duke; even in this
democratic age, he would have some influence, one supposed.</p>

<p>"He's eighty," went on Sir Lawrence, "and gets gout in the
stomach, but he's as brisk as a bee."</p>

<p>Soames could not be sure whether it was a comfort.</p>

<p>"The grass shall not grow, Forsyte. I'll go there now."</p>

<p>They parted in the street, Sir Lawrence moving north--towards
Mayfair.</p>

<p>The Marquess of Shropshire was dictating to his secretary a letter
to his County Council, urging on them an item of his lifelong
programme for the electrification of everything. One of the very
first to take up electricity, he had remained faithful to it all his
brisk and optimistic days. A short, bird-like old man, in shaggy
Lovat tweeds, with a blue tie of knitted silk passed through a ring,
bright cheeks and well-trimmed white beard and moustache, he was
standing in his favourite attitude, with one foot on a chair, his
elbow on his knee, and his chin on his hand.</p>

<p>"Ah! young Mont!" he said: "Sit down."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence took a chair, crossed his knees, and threaded his
finger-tips. He found it pleasing to be called 'young Mont,' at
sixty-six or so.</p>

<p>"Have you brought me another of your excellent books?"</p>

<p>"No, Marquess; I've come for your advice."</p>

<p>"Ah! Go on, Mr. Mersey: 'In this way, gentlemen, you will save at
least three thousand a year to your rate-payers; confer a blessing on
the countryside by abolishing the smoke of four filthy chimneys; and
make me your obliged servant,</p>

<p>'SHROPSHIRE.'</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Mersey. Now, my dear young Mont?"</p>

<p>Having watched the back of the secretary till it vanished, and the
old peer pivot his bright eyes, with their expression of one who
means to see more every day, on the face of his visitor, Sir Lawrence
took his eyeglass between thumb and finger, and said:</p>

<p>"Your granddaughter, sir, and my daughter-in-law want to fight
like billy-o."</p>

<p>"Marjorie?" said the old man, and his head fell to one side like a
bird's. "I draw the line--a charming young woman to look at, but I
draw the line. What has she done now?"</p>

<p>"Called my daughter-in-law a snob and a lion-hunter; and my
daughter-in-law's father has called your granddaughter a traitress to
her face."</p>

<p>"Bold man," said the marquess; "bold man! Who is he?"</p>

<p>"His name is Forsyte."</p>

<p>"Forsyte?" repeated the old peer; "Forsyte? The name's
familiar--now where would that be? Ah! Forsyte and Treffry--the big
tea men. My father had his tea from them direct--real caravan; no
such tea now. Is that the--?"</p>

<p>"Some relation, perhaps. This man is a solicitor--retired; chiefly
renowned for his pictures. A man of some substance, and probity."</p>

<p>"Indeed! And <i>is</i> his daughter a--a lion-hunter?"</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence smiled.</p>

<p>"She's a charmer. Likes to have people about her. Very pretty.
Excellent little mother; some French blood."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the marquess: "the French! Better built round the
middle than our people. What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Speak to your son Charles."</p>

<p>The old man took his foot off the chair, and stood nearly upright.
His head moved sideways with a slight continuous motion.</p>

<p>"I never speak to Charlie," he said, gravely. "We haven't spoken
for six years."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir. Didn't know. Sorry to have bothered
you."</p>

<p>"No, no; pleasure to see you. If I run across Marjorie, I'll
see--I'll see. But, my dear Mont, what shall we do with these young
women--no sense of service; no continuity; no hair; no figures? By
the way, do you know this Power Scheme on the Severn?" He held up a
pamphlet: "I've been at them to do it for years. My Colliery among
others could be made to pay with electricity; but they won't move. We
want some Americans over here."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence had risen; the old man's sense of service had so
clearly taken the bit between its teeth again. He held out his
hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Marquess; delighted to see you looking so well."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my dear young Mont; command me at any time, and let me
have another of your nice books."</p>

<p>They shook hands; and from the Lovat clothes was disengaged a
strong whiff of peat. Sir Lawrence, looking back, saw the old man
back in his favourite attitude, foot on chair and chin on hand,
already reading the pamphlet. 'Some boy!' he thought; 'as Michael
would say. But what has Charlie Ferrar done not to be spoken to for
six years? Old Forsyte ought to be told about that.' . . .</p>

<p>In the meantime 'Old Forsyte' and Michael were walking homeward
across St. James's Park.</p>

<p>"That young American," said Soames; "what do you suppose made him
put his oar in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir; and I don't like to ask."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Soames, glumly. There was, indeed, something
repulsive to him in treating with an American over a matter of
personal dignity.</p>

<p>"Do they use the word 'snob' over there?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure; but, in the States to hunt lions is a form of
idealism. They want to associate with what they think better than
themselves. It's rather fine."</p>

<p>Soames did not agree; but found difficulty in explaining why. Not
to recognise any one as better than himself or his daughter had been
a sort of guiding principle, and guiding principles were not talked
about. In fact, it was so deep in him that he hadn't known of it.</p>

<p>"I shan't mention it," he said, "unless he does. What more can
this young woman do? She's in a set, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"The Panjoys--"</p>

<p>"Panjoys!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; out for a good time at any cost--they don't really
count, of course. But Marjorie Ferrar is frightfully in the
limelight. She paints a bit; she's got some standing with the Press;
she dances; she hunts; she's something of an actress; she goes
everywhere week-ending. It's the week-ends that matter, where people
have nothing to do but talk. Were you ever at a weekend party,
sir?"</p>

<p>"I?" said Soames: "Good Lord--no!"</p>

<p>Michael smiled--incongruity, indeed, could go no farther.</p>

<p>"We must get one up for you at Lippinghall."</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>"You're right, sir; nothing more boring. But they're the
<i>coulisses</i> of politics. Fleur thinks they're good for me. And
Marjorie Ferrar knows all the people we know, and lots more. It
<i>is</i> awkward."</p>

<p>"I should go on as if nothing had happened," said Soames: "But
about that paper? They ought to be warned that this woman is
venomous."</p>

<p>Michael regarded his father-in-law quizzically.</p>

<p>On entering, they found the man-servant in the hall.</p>

<p>"There's a man to see you, sir, by the name of Bugfill."</p>

<p>"Oh! Ah! Where have you put him, Coaker?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't know what to make of him, sir, he shakes all over.
I've stood him in the dining-room."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," said Michael.</p>

<p>Soames passed into the 'parlour,' where he found his daughter and
Francis Wilmot.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilmot is leaving us, Father. You're just in time to say
good-bye."</p>

<p>If there were moments when Soames felt cordial, they were such as
these. He had nothing against the young man; indeed, he rather liked
the look of him; but to see the last of almost anybody was in a sense
a relief; besides, there was this question of what he had overheard,
and to have him about the place without knowing would be a continual
temptation to compromise with one's dignity and ask him what it
was.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mr. Wilmot," he said; "if you're interested in
pictures--" he paused, and, holding out, his hand, added, "you should
look in at the British Museum."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot shook the hand deferentially.</p>

<p>"I will. It's been a privilege to know you, sir." Soames was
wondering why, when the young man turned to Fleur.</p>

<p>"I'll be writing to Jon from Paris, and I'll surely send your
love. You've been perfectly wonderful to me. I'll be glad to have you
and Michael visit me at any time you come across to the States; and
if you bring the little dog, why--I'll just be honoured to let him
bite me again."</p>

<p>He bowed over Fleur's hand and was gone, leaving Soames staring at
the back of his daughter's neck.</p>

<p>"That's rather sudden," he said, when the door was closed;
"anything upset him?"</p>

<p>She turned on him, and said coldly:</p>

<p>"Why did you make that fuss last night, Father?"</p>

<p>The injustice of her attack was so palpable, that Soames bit his
moustache in silence. As if he could help himself, when she was
insulted in his hearing!</p>

<p>"What good do you think you've done?"</p>

<p>Soames, who had no notion, made no attempt to enlighten her. He
only felt sore inside.</p>

<p>"You've made me feel as if I couldn't look anybody in the face.
But I'm going to, all the same. If I'm a lion-hunter and a snob, I'll
do it thoroughly. Only I do wish you wouldn't go on thinking I'm a
child and can't defend myself."</p>

<p>And still Soames was silent, sore to the soles of his boots.</p>

<p>Fleur flashed a look at him, and said:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but I can't help it; everything's queered;" and she
too went out of the room.</p>

<p>Soames moved blindly to the window and stood looking out. He saw a
cab with luggage drive away; saw some pigeons alight, peck at the
pavement, and fly off again; he saw a man kissing a woman in the
dusk; a policeman light his pipe and go off duty. He saw many human
and interesting things; he heard Big Ben chime. Nothing in it all! He
was staring at a silver spoon. He himself had put it in her mouth at
birth.</p>

<h2>POULTRY AND CATS</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He who had been stood in the dining-room, under the name of
Bugfill, was still upright. Rather older than Michael, with an
inclination to side-whisker, darkish hair, and a pale face stamped
with that look of schooled quickness common to so many actors but
unfamiliar to Michael, he was grasping the edge of the dining-table
with one hand, and a wide-brimmed black hat with the other. The
expression of his large, dark-circled eyes was such that Michael
smiled and said:</p>

<p>"It's all right, Mr. Bergfeld, I'm not a Manager. Do sit down, and
smoke."</p>

<p>The visitor silently took the proffered chair and cigarette with
an attempt at a fixed smile. Michael sat on the table.</p>

<p>"I gather from Mrs. Bergfeld that you're on the rocks."</p>

<p>"Fast," said the shaking lips.</p>

<p>"Your health, and your name, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You want an open-air job, I believe? I haven't been able to think
of anything very gaudy, but an idea did strike me last night in the
stilly watches. How about raising poultry--everybody's doing it."</p>

<p>"If I had my savings."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Bergfeld told me about them. I can inquire, but I'm
afraid--"</p>

<p>"It's robbery." The chattered sound let Michael at once into the
confidence of the many Managers who had refused to employ him who
uttered it.</p>

<p>"I know," he said, soothingly, "robbing Peter to pay Paul. That
clause in the Treaty was a bit of rank barbarism, of course,
camouflage it as they like. Still, it's no good to let it prey on
your mind, is it?"</p>

<p>But his visitor had risen. "To take from civilian to pay civilian!
Then why not take civilian life for civilian life? What is the
difference? And England does it--the leading nation to respect the
individual. It is abominable."</p>

<p>Michael began to feel that he was overdoing it.</p>

<p>"You forget," he said, "that the war made us all into barbarians,
for the time being; we haven't quite got over it yet. And your
country dropped the spark into the powder magazine, you know. But
what about this poultry stunt?"</p>

<p>Bergfeld seemed to make a violent effort to control himself.</p>

<p>"For my wife's sake," he said, "I will do anything; but unless I
get my savings back, how can I start?"</p>

<p>"I can't promise; but perhaps I could start you. That hair-dresser
below you wants an open-air job, too. What's his name, by the
way?"</p>

<p>"Swain."</p>

<p>"How do you get on with him?"</p>

<p>"He is an opinionated man, but we are good friends enough."</p>

<p>Michael got off the table. "Well, leave it to me to think it out.
We shall be able to do something, I hope;" and he held out his
hand.</p>

<p>Bergfeld took it silently, and his eyes resumed the expression
with which they had first looked at Michael.</p>

<p>'That man,' thought Michael, 'will be committing suicide some day,
if he doesn't look out.' And he showed him to the door. He stood
there some minutes gazing after the German actor's vanishing form,
with a feeling as if the dusk were formed out of the dark stories of
such as he and the hair-dresser and the man who had whispered to him
to stand and deliver a job. Well, Bart must lend him that bit of land
beyond the coppice at Lippinghall. He would buy a War hut if there
were any left and some poultry stock, and start a colony--the
Bergfelds, the hair-dresser, and Henry Boddick. They could cut the
timber in the coppice, and put up the fowl-houses for themselves. It
would be growing food--a practical experiment in Foggartism! Fleur
would laugh at him. But was there anything one could do nowadays that
somebody couldn't laugh at? He turned back into the house. Fleur was
in the hall.</p>

<p>"Francis Wilmot has gone," she said.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He's off to Paris."</p>

<p>"What was it he overheard last night?"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I asked?"</p>

<p>"Well, no," said Michael, humbly. "Let's go up and look at Kit,
it's about his bath time."</p>

<p>The eleventh baronet, indeed, was already in his bath.</p>

<p>"All right, nurse," said Fleur, "I'll finish him."</p>

<p>"He's been in three minutes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Lightly boiled," said Michael.</p>

<p>For one aged only fourteen months this naked infant had incredible
vigour--from lips to feet he was all sound and motion. He seemed to
lend a meaning to life. His vitality was absolute, not relative. His
kicks and crows and splashings had the joy of a gnat's dance, or a
jackdaw's gambols in the air. They gave thanks not for what he was
about to receive, but for what he was receiving. White as a
turtle-dove, with pink toes, darker in eyes and hair than he would be
presently, he grabbed at the soap, at his mother, at the
bath-towelling--he seemed only to need a tail. Michael watched him,
musing. This manikin, born with all that he could possibly wish for
within his reach--how were they to bring him up? Were they fit to
bring him up, they who had been born--like all their generation in
the richer classes--emancipated, to parents properly broken-in to
worship the fetich--Liberty? Born to everything they wanted, so that
they were at wits' end to invent something they could not get; driven
to restive searching by having their own way? The war had deprived
one of one's own way, but the war had overdone it, and left one
grasping at license. And for those, like Fleur, born a little late
for the war, the tale of it had only lowered what respect they could
have for anything. With veneration killed, and self-denial 'off,'
with atavism buried, sentiment derided, and the future in the air,
hardly a wonder that modernity should be a dance of gnats, taking
itself damned seriously! Such were the reflections of Michael,
sitting there above the steam, and frowning at his progeny. Without
faith was one fit to be a parent? Well, people were looking for faith
again. Only they were bound to hatch the egg of it so hard that it
would be addled long before it was a chicken. 'Too self-conscious!'
he thought. 'That's our trouble!'</p>

<p>Fleur had finished drying the eleventh baronet, and was dabbing
powder over him; her eyes seemed penetrating his skin, as if to gauge
the state of health behind it. He watched her take the feet and hands
one by one and examine each nail, lost in her scrutiny,
unselfconscious in her momentary devotion! And oppressed by the
difficulty, as a Member of Parliament, of being devoted, Michael
snapped his fingers at the baby and left the nursery. He went to his
study and took down a volume of the Encyclopaedia Britannica
containing the word Poultry. He read about Leghorns, Orpingtons,
White Sussex, Bramaputras, and was little the wiser. He remembered
that if you drew a chalk-line to the beak of a hen, the hen thought
it was tied up. He wished somebody would draw a chalk-line to his
beak. Was Foggartism a chalk-line? A voice said:</p>

<p>"Tell Fleur I'm going to her aunt's."</p>

<p>"Leaving us, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm not wanted."</p>

<p>What had happened?</p>

<p>"You'll see her before you go, sir?"</p>

<p>"No," said Soames.</p>

<p>Had somebody rubbed out the chalk-line to Old Forsyte's nose?</p>

<p>"Is there any money in poultry-farming, sir?"</p>

<p>"There's no money in anything nowadays."</p>

<p>"And yet the Income Tax returns continue to rise."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Soames; "there's something wrong there."</p>

<p>"You don't think people make their incomes out more than they
are?"</p>

<p>Soames blinked. Pessimistic though he felt at the moment, he could
not take quite that low view of human nature.</p>

<p>"You'd better see that Fleur doesn't go about abusing that
red-haired baggage," he said. "She was born with a silver spoon in
her mouth; she thinks she can do what she likes." And he shut Michael
in again.</p>

<p>Silver spoon in her mouth! How <i>&agrave;propos!</i> . . .</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>After putting her baby into its cot Fleur had gone to the
marqueterie bureau in the little sanctuary that would have been
called a boudoir in old days. She sat there brooding. How could her
father have made it all glaringly public? Couldn't he have seen that
it was nothing so long as it was not public, but everything the
moment it was? She longed to pour out her heart, and tell people her
opinion of Marjorie Ferrar.</p>

<p>She wrote three letters--one to Lady Alison, and two to women in
the group who had overheard it all last night. She concluded her
third letter with the words: "A woman like that, who pretends to be a
friend and sneaks into one's house to sting one behind one's back, is
a snake of the first water. How Society can stick her, I can't think;
she hasn't a moral about her nor a decent impulse. As for her
charm--Good Lord!" Yes! And there was Francis Wilmot! She had not
said all she wanted to say to him.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"MY DEAR FRANCIS," she wrote:</p>

<p>"I am so sorry you have to run away like this. I wanted to thank
you for standing up for me last night. Marjorie Ferrar is just about
the limit. But in London society one doesn't pay attention to
backbiting. It has been so jolly to know you. Don't forget us; and do
come and see me again when you come back from Paris.</p>

<p>"Your very good friend,</p>

<p>"FLEUR MONT."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>In future she would have nothing but men at her evenings! But
would they come if there were no women? And men like Philip Quinsey
were just as snakelike. Besides, it would look as if she were really
hurt. No! She would have to go on as before, just dropping people who
were 'catty.' But who wasn't? Except Alison, and heavyweights like
Mr. Blythe, the minor Ambassadors, and three or four earnest
politicians, she couldn't be sure about any of them. It was the thing
to be 'catty.' They all scratched other people's backs, and their
faces too when they weren't looking. Who in Society was exempt from
scratches, and who didn't scratch? Not to scratch a little was so
dreadfully dull. She could not imagine a scratchless life except
perhaps in Italy. Those Fra Angelico frescoes in the San Marco
monastery! <i>There</i> was a man who did not scratch. St. Francis,
too, talking to his birds, among his little flowers, with the sun and
the moon and the stars for near relations. Ste. Claire! Ste.
Fleur--little sister of St. Francis! To be unworldly and quite good!
To be one who lived to make other people happy! How new! How
exciting, even--for about a week; and how dull afterwards! She drew
aside the curtains and looked out into the Square. Two cats were
standing in the light of a lamp--narrow, marvellously graceful, with
their heads turned towards each other. Suddenly they began uttering
horrible noises, and became all claws. Fleur dropped the curtain.</p>

<br>


<h2>FRANCIS WILMOT REVERSES</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>About that moment Francis Wilmot sat down in the lounge of the
Cosmopolis Hotel, and as suddenly sat up. In the middle of the
parquet floor, sliding and lunging, backing and filling, twisting and
turning in the arms of a man with a face like a mask, was she, to
avoid whom, out of loyalty to Fleur and Michael, he had decided to go
to Paris. Fate! For he could hardly know that she came there most
afternoons during the dancing hours. She and her partner were easily
the show couple; and, fond of dancing, Francis Wilmot knew he was
looking at something special. When they stopped, quite close to him,
he said in his soft drawl:</p>

<p>"That was beautiful."</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Wilmot?"</p>

<p>Why! She knew his name! This was the moment to exhibit loyalty!
But she had sunk into a chair next his.</p>

<p>"And so you thought me a traitress last night?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I heard you call your hostess a snob."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar uttered an amused sound.</p>

<p>"My dear young man, if one never called one's friends anything
worse than that--! I didn't mean you to hear, or that poptious old
person with the chin!"</p>

<p>"He was her father," said Francis Wilmot, gravely. "It hurt
him."</p>

<p>"Well! I'm sorry!"</p>

<p>A hand without a glove, warm but dry, was put into his. When it
was withdrawn the whole of his hand and arm were tingling.</p>

<p>"Do you dance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, but I wouldn't presume to dance with you."</p>

<p>"Oh! but you must."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot's head went round, and his body began going round
too.</p>

<p>"You dance better than an Englishman, unless he's professional,"
said her lips six inches from his own.</p>

<p>"I'm proud to hear you say so, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Don't you know my name? or do you always call women ma'am? It's
ever so pretty."</p>

<p>"Certainly I know your name and where you live. I wasn't six yards
from you this morning at four o'clock."</p>

<p>"What were you doing there?"</p>

<p>"I just thought I'd like to be near you."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar said, as if to herself:</p>

<p>"The prettiest speech I ever heard. Come and have tea with me
there to-morrow."</p>

<p>Reversing, side-stepping, doing all he knew, Francis Wilmot said,
slowly:</p>

<p>"I have to be in Paris."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid, but--"</p>

<p>"Well, I shall expect you." And, transferring herself again to her
mask-faced partner, she looked back at him over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot wiped his brow. An astonishing experience, another
blow to his preconception of a stiff and formal race! If he had not
known she was the daughter of a lord, he would have thought her an
American. Would she ask him to dance with her again? But she left the
lounge without another glance.</p>

<p>An up-to-date young man, a typical young man, would have felt the
more jaunty. But he was neither. Six months' training for the Air
Service in 1918, one visit to New York, and a few trips to Charleston
and Savannah, had left him still a countryman, with a tradition of
good manners, work, and simple living. Women, of whom he had known
few, were to him worthy of considerable respect. He judged them by
his sister, or by the friends of his dead mother, in Savannah, who
were all of a certain age. A Northern lady on the boat had told him
that Southern girls measured life by the number of men they could
attract; she had given him an amusing take-off of a Southern girl. It
had been a surprise to this young Southerner. Anne was not like that;
she had never had the chance to be, anyway, having married at
nineteen the first young man who had asked her!</p>

<p>By the morning's post he received Fleur's little letter. 'Limit!'
Limit of what? He felt indignant. He did not go to Paris, and at four
o'clock he was at Wren Street.</p>

<p>In her studio Marjorie Ferrar, clad in a flax-blue overall, was
scraping at a picture with a little knife. An hour later he was her
slave. Cruft's Dog Show, the Beefeaters, the Derby--he could not even
remember his desire to see them; he only desired to see one English
thing--Marjorie Ferrar. He hardly remembered which way the river
flowed, and by mere accident walked East instead of West. Her hair,
her eyes, her voice--he 'had fallen for her!' He knew himself for a
fool, and did not mind; farther man cannot go. She passed him in a
little open car, driving it herself, on her way to a rehearsal. She
waved her hand. Blood rushed to his heart and rushed away; he
trembled and went pale. And, as the car vanished, he felt lost, as if
in a world of shadows, grey and dreary! Ah! There was Parliament!
And, near by, the one spot in London where he could go and talk of
Marjorie Ferrar, and that was where she had misbehaved herself! He
itched to defend her from the charge of being 'the limit.' He could
perceive the inappropriateness of going back there to talk to Fleur
of her enemy, but anything was better than not talking of her. So,
turning into South Square, he rang the bell.</p>

<p>Fleur was in her 'parlour,' if not precisely eating bread and
honey, at least having tea.</p>

<p>"Not in Paris? How nice! Tea?"</p>

<p>"I've had it," said Francis Wilmot, colouring. "I had it with
<i>her."</i></p>

<p>Fleur stared.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, with a laugh. "How interesting! Where did she pick
you up?"</p>

<p>Without taking in the implication of the words, Francis Wilmot was
conscious of something deadly in them.</p>

<p>"She was at the <i>th&eacute; dansant</i> at my hotel yesterday.
She's a wonderful dancer. I think she's a wonderful person
altogether; I'd like to have you tell me what you mean by calling her
'the limit'?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to have you tell me why this <i>volte face</i> since
Wednesday night?"</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot smiled: "You people have been ever so kind to me,
and I want you to be friends with her again. I'm sure she didn't mean
what she said that night."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Did she tell you that?"</p>

<p>"Why--not exactly! She said she didn't mean us to hear them."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>He looked at her smiling face, conscious, perhaps, of deep waters,
but youthfully, Americanly, unconscious of serious obstacle to his
desire to smooth things out.</p>

<p>"I just hate to think you two are out after each other. Won't you
come and meet her at my hotel, and shake hands?"</p>

<p>Fleur's eyes moved slowly over him from head to toe.</p>

<p>"You look as if you might have some French blood in you. Have
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. My grandmother was of French stock."</p>

<p>"Well, I have more. The French, you know, don't forgive easily.
And they don't persuade themselves into believing what they want
to."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot rose, and spoke with a kind of masterfulness.</p>

<p>"You're going to tell me what you meant in your letter."</p>

<p>"Am I? My dear young man, the limit of perfection, of course.
Aren't you a living proof?"</p>

<p>Aware that he was being mocked, and mixed in his feelings, Francis
Wilmot made for the door.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said. "I suppose you'll have no use for me in
future."</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" said Fleur.</p>

<p>He went out rueful, puzzled, lonelier even than when he went in.
He was guideless, with no one to 'put him wise'! No directness and
simplicity in this town. People did not say what they meant; and his
goddess--as enigmatic and twisting as the rest! More so--more so--for
what did the rest matter?</p>

<h2><a name="C11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>SOAMES VISITS THE PRESS</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Soames had gone off to his sister's in Green Street thoroughly
upset. That Fleur should have a declared enemy, powerful in Society,
filled him with uneasiness; that she should hold him accountable for
it, seemed the more unjust, because in fact he was.</p>

<p>An evening spent under the calming influence of Winifred Dartie's
common-sense, and Turkish coffee, which, though 'liverish stuff,' he
always drank with relish, restored in him something of the feeling
that it was a storm in a teacup.</p>

<p>"But that paper paragraph," he said, "sticks in my gizzard."</p>

<p>"Very tiresome, Soames, the whole thing; but I shouldn't bother.
People skim those 'chiff-chaff' little notes and forget them the next
moment. They're just put in for fun."</p>

<p>"Pretty sort of fun! That paper says it has a million
readers."</p>

<p>"There's no name mentioned."</p>

<p>"These political people and whipper-snappers in Society all know
each other," said Soames.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear boy," said Winifred in her comfortable voice, so
cosey, and above disturbance, "but nobody takes anything seriously
nowadays."</p>

<p>She was sensible. He went up to bed in more cheerful mood.</p>

<p>But retirement from affairs had effected in Soames a deeper change
than he was at all aware of. Lacking professional issues to anchor
the faculty for worrying he had inherited from James Forsyte, he was
inclined to pet any trouble that came along. The more he thought of
that paragraph, the more he felt inclined for a friendly talk with
the editor. If he could go to Fleur and say: "I've made it all right
with those fellows, anyway. There'll be no more of that sort of
thing," he would wipe out her vexation. If you couldn't make people
in private think well of your daughter, you could surely check public
expression of the opposite opinion.</p>

<p>Except that he did not like to get into them, Soames took on the
whole a favourable view of 'the papers.' He read <i>The Times;</i>
his father had read it before him, and he had been brought up on its
crackle. It had news--more news for his money than he could get
through. He respected its leading articles; and if its great
supplements had at times appeared to him too much of a good thing,
still it was a gentleman's paper. Annette and Winifred took <i>The
Morning Post.</i> That also was a gentleman's paper, but it had bees
in its bonnet. Bees in bonnets were respectable things, but
personally Soames did not care for them. He knew little of the other
papers except that those he saw about had bigger headlines and seemed
cut up into little bits. Of the Press as a whole he took the English
view: It was an institution. It had its virtues and its vices--anyway
you had to put up with it.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock he was walking towards Fleet Street.</p>

<p>At the office of <i>The Evening Sun</i> he handed in his card and
asked to see the Editor. After a moment's inspection of his top-hat,
he was taken down a corridor and deposited in a small room. It seemed
a 'wandering great place.' Some one would see him!</p>

<p>"Some one?" said Soames: "I want the Editor."</p>

<p>The Editor was very busy; could he come again when the rush was
over?</p>

<p>"No," said Soames.</p>

<p>Would he state his business? Soames wouldn't.</p>

<p>The attendant again looked at his top-hat and went away.</p>

<p>Soames waited a quarter of an hour, and was then taken to an even
smaller room, where a cheery-looking man in eye-glasses was turning
over a book of filed cuttings. He glanced up as Soames entered, took
his card from the table, and read from it:</p>

<p>"Mr. Soames Forsyte? Yes?"</p>

<p>"Are you the Editor?" asked Soames.</p>

<p>"One of them. Take a seat. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>Impressed by a certain speed in the air, and desirous of making a
good impression, Soames did not sit down, but took from his
pocket-book the paragraph.</p>

<p>"I've come about this in your issue of last Thursday."</p>

<p>The cheery man put it up to his eyes, seemed to chew the sense of
it a little with his mouth, and said: "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Would you kindly tell me who wrote it?"</p>

<p>"We never disclose the names of correspondents, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, as a matter of fact, I know."</p>

<p>The cheery man's mouth opened, as if to emit the words: "Then why
did you ask?" but closed in a smile instead.</p>

<p>"You'll forgive me," said Soames; "it quite clearly refers to my
daughter, Mrs. Michael Mont, and her husband."</p>

<p>"Indeed! You have the advantage of me; but what's the matter with
it? Seems rather a harmless piece of gossip."</p>

<p>Soames looked at him. He was too cheery;</p>

<p>"You think so?" he said, drily. "May I ask if you would like to
have your daughter alluded to as an enterprising little lady?"</p>

<p>"Why not? It's quite a pleasant word. Besides, there's no name
mentioned."</p>

<p>"Do you put things in," asked Soames, shrewdly, "in order that
they may be Greek to all your readers?"</p>

<p>The cheery man laughed: "Well," he said, "hardly. But really, sir,
aren't you rather thin-skinned?"</p>

<p>This was an aspect of the affair that Soames had not foreseen.
Before he could ask this Editor chap not to repeat his offence, he
had apparently to convince him that it <i>was</i> an offence; but to
do that he must expose the real meaning of the paragraph.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "if you can't see that the tone of the thing's
unpleasant, I can't make you. But I beg you won't let any more such
paragraphs appear. I happen to know that your correspondent is
actuated by malevolence."</p>

<p>The cheery man again ran his eye over the cutting.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have judged that. People in politics are taking and
giving knocks all the time--they're not mealy-mouthed. This seems
perfectly innocuous as gossip goes."</p>

<p>Thus backhanded by the words 'thin-skinned' and 'mealy-mouthed,'
Soames said testily:</p>

<p>"The whole thing's extremely petty."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you know, I rather agree. Good morning!" and the
cheery man blandly returned to his file.</p>

<p>The fellow was like an india-rubber ball! Soames clenched his
top-hat. Now or never he must make him bound.</p>

<p>"If your correspondent thinks she can vent her spleen in print
with impunity, she will find herself very much mistaken." He waited
for the effect. There was absolutely none. "Good morning!" he said,
and turned on his heel.</p>

<p>Somehow it had not been so friendly as he had expected. Michael's
words "The Press is a sensitive plant" came into his mind. He
shouldn't mention his visit.</p>

<p>Two days later, picking up <i>The Evening Sun</i> at The
Connoisseurs, he saw the word "Foggartism." H'm! A leader!</p>

<p>"Of the panaceas rife among the young hopefuls in politics,
perhaps the most absurd is one which goes by the name of Foggartism.
We are in a position to explain the nature of this patent remedy for
what is supposed to be the national ill-health before it has been put
on the market. Based on Sir James Foggart's book, "The Parlous State
of England," the main article of faith in this crazy creed would
appear to be the depletion of British man-power. According to its
prophets, we are to despatch to the ends of the Empire hundreds of
thousands of our boys and girls as soon as they leave school. Quite
apart from the rank impossibility of absorbing them into the life of
the slowly developing Dominions, we are to lose this vital stream of
labour and defensive material, in order that twenty years hence the
demand from our Dominions may equal the supplying power of Great
Britain. A crazier proposition was never conceived in woolly brains.
Well does the word Foggartism characterise such a proposition.
Alongside this emigration 'stunt'--for there is no other term which
suits its sensational character--rises a feeble back-to-the-land
propaganda. The keystone of the whole professes to be the doctrine
that the standard of British wages and living now preclude us from
any attempt to rival German production, or to recover our trade with
Europe. Such a turning of the tail on our industrial supremacy has
probably never before been mooted in this country. The sooner these
cheap-jack gerrymanders of British policy realise that the British
voter will have nothing to do with so crack-brained a scheme, the
sooner it will come to the still birth which is its inevitable
fate."</p>

<p>Whatever attention Soames had given to "The Parlous State of
England," he could not be accused of anything so rash as a faith in
Foggartism. If Foggartism were killed to-morrow, he, with his
inherent distrust of theories and ideas, his truly English
pragmatism, could not help feeling that Michael would be well rid of
a white elephant. What disquieted him, however, was the suspicion
that he himself had inspired this article. Was this that too-cheery
fellow's retort?</p>

<p>Decidedly, he should not mention his visit when he dined in South
Square that evening.</p>

<p>The presence of a strange hat on the sarcophagus warned him of a
fourth party. Mr. Blythe, in fact, with a cocktail in his hand, and
an olive in his mouth, was talking to Fleur, who was curled up on a
cushion by the fire.</p>

<p>"You know Mr. Blythe, Dad?"</p>

<p>Another Editor! Soames extended his hand with caution.</p>

<p>Mr. Blythe swallowed the olive. "It's of no importance," he
said.</p>

<p>"Well," said Fleur, "<i>I</i> think you ought to put it all off,
and let them feel they've made fools of themselves."</p>

<p>"Does Michael think that, Mrs. Mont?"</p>

<p>"No; Michael's got his shirt out!" And they all looked round at
Michael, who was coming in.</p>

<p>He certainly had a somewhat headstrong air.</p>

<p>According to Michael, they must take it by the short hairs and
give as good as they got, or they might as well put up the shutters.
They were sent to Parliament to hold their own opinions, not those
stuck into them by Fleet Street. If they genuinely believed the
Foggart policy to be the only way to cure unemployment, and stem the
steady drain into the towns, they must say so, and not be stampeded
by every little newspaper attack that came along. Common-sense was on
their side, and common-sense, if you aired it enough, won through in
the end. The opposition to Foggartism was really based on an
intention to force lower wages and longer hours on Labour, only they
daren't say so in so many words. Let the papers jump through their
hoops as much as they liked. He would bet that when Foggartism had
been six months before the public, they would be eating half their
words with an air of eating some one else's! And suddenly he turned
to Soames:</p>

<p>"I suppose, sir, you didn't go down about that paragraph?"</p>

<p>Soames, privately, and as a business man, had always so conducted
himself that, if cornered, he need never tell a direct untruth. Lies
were not English, not even good form. Looking down his nose, he said
slowly:</p>

<p>"Well, I let them know that I knew that woman's name."</p>

<p>Fleur frowned; Mr. Blythe reached out and took some salted
almonds.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you, sir?" said Michael. "They always get back on
you. The Press has a tremendous sense of dignity; and corns on both
feet; eh, Mr. Blythe?"</p>

<p>Mr. Blythe said weightily: "It's a very human institution, young
man. It prefers to criticise rather than to be criticised."</p>

<p>"I thought," said Fleur, icily, "that I was to be left to my own
cudgels."</p>

<p>The discussion broke back to Foggartism, but Soames sat brooding.
He would never again interfere in what didn't concern himself. Then,
like all who love, he perceived the bitterness of his fate. He had
only meddled with what <i>did</i> concern himself--her name, her
happiness; and she resented it. Basket in which were all his eggs, to
the end of his days he must go on walking gingerly, balancing her so
that she was not upset, spilling his only treasure.</p>

<p>She left them over the wine that only Mr. Blythe was drinking.
Soames heard an odd word now and then, gathered that this great
frog-chap was going to burst next week in <i>The Outpost,</i>
gathered that Michael was to get on to his hind legs in the House at
the first opportunity. It was all a muzz of words to him. When they
rose, he said to Michael:</p>

<p>"I'll take myself off."</p>

<p>"We're going down to the House, sir: won't you stay with
Fleur?"</p>

<p>"No," said Soames: "I must be getting back."</p>

<p>Michael looked at him closely.</p>

<p>"I'll just tell her you're going."</p>

<p>Soames had wrapped himself into his coat, and was opening the door
when he smelled violet soap. A bare arm had come round his neck. He
felt soft pressure against his back. "Sorry, Dad, for being such a
pig."</p>

<p>Soames shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," said her voice; "you're not going like that."</p>

<p>She slipped between him and the door. Her clear eyes looked into
his; her teeth gleamed, very white. "Say you forgive me!"</p>

<p>"There's no end to it," said Soames.</p>

<p>She thrust her lips against his nose. "There! Good night, ducky! I
know I'm spoiled!"</p>

<p>Soames gave her body a convulsive little squeeze, opened the door
and went out without a word.</p>

<p>Under Big Ben boys were calling--political news, he supposed.
Those Labour chaps were going to fall--some Editor had got them into
trouble. He would! Well--one down, t'other come on! It was all remote
to him. She alone--she alone mattered.</p>

<h2>MICHAEL MUSES</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Michael and Mr. Blythe sought the Mother of Parliaments and found
her in commotion. Liberalism had refused, and Labour was falling from
its back. A considerable number of people were in Parliament Square
contemplating Big Ben and hoping for sensation.</p>

<p>"I'm not going in," said Michael. "There won't be a division
to-night. General Election's a foregone conclusion, now. I want to
think."</p>

<p>"One will go up for a bit," said Mr. Blythe; and they parted,
Michael returning to the streets. The night was clear, and he had a
longing to hear the voice of his country. But--where? For his
countrymen would be discussing this pro and that con, would be
mentioning each his personal 'grief'--here the Income Tax, there the
dole, the names of leaders, the word Communism. Nowhere would he
catch the echo of the uneasiness in the hearts of all. The Tories--as
Fleur had predicted--would come in now. The country would catch at
the anodyne of 'strong stable government.' But could strong stable
government remove the inherent canker, the lack of balance in the
top-heavy realm? Could it still the gnawing ache which everybody
felt, and nobody would express?</p>

<p>'Spoiled,' thought Michael, 'by our past prosperity. We shall
never admit it,' he thought, 'never! And yet in our bones we feel
it!'</p>

<p>England with the silver spoon in her mouth and no longer the teeth
to hold it there, or the will to part with it! And her very
qualities--the latent 'grit,' the power to take things smiling, the
lack of nerves and imagination! Almost vices, now, perpetuating the
rash belief that England could still 'muddle through' without special
effort, although with every year there was less chance of recovering
from shock, less time in which to exercise the British 'virtues.'
'Slow in the uptak',' thought Michael, 'it's a bad fault in
1924.'</p>

<p>Thus musing, he turned East. Mid-theatre-hour, and the 'Great
Parasite'--as Sir James Foggart called it--was lying inert, and
bright. He walked the length of wakeful Fleet Street into the City so
delirious by day, so dead by night. Here England's wealth was
snoozing off the day's debauch. Here were all the frame and filaments
of English credit. And based on--what? On food and raw material from
which England, undefended in the air, might be cut off by a fresh
war; on Labour, too big for European boots. And yet that credit stood
high still, soothing all with its 'panache'--save, perhaps, receivers
of the dole. With her promise to pay, England could still purchase
anything, except a quiet heart.</p>

<p>And Michael walked on--through Whitechapel, busy still and
coloured--into Mile End. The houses had become low, as if to give the
dwellers a better view of stars they couldn't reach. He had crossed a
frontier. Here was a different race almost; another England, but as
happy-go-lucky and as hand-to-mouth as the England of Fleet Street
and the City. Aye, and more! For the England in Mile End knew that
whatever she felt could have no effect on policy. Mile on mile,
without an end, the low grey streets stretched towards the ultimate
deserted grass. Michael did not follow them, but coming to a Cinema,
turned in.</p>

<p>The show was far advanced. Bound and seated in front of the bad
cowboy on a bronco, the heroine was crossing what Michael shrewdly
suspected to be the film company's pet paddock. Every ten seconds she
gave way to John T. Bronson, Manager of the Tucsonville Copper Mine,
devouring the road in his 60 h. p. Packard, to cut her off before she
reached the Pima river. Michael contemplated his fellow gazers.
Lapping it up! Strong stable government--not much! This was their
anodyne and they could not have enough of it. He saw the bronco fall,
dropped by a shot from John T. Bronson, and the screen disclose the
words: "Hairy Pete grows desperate. . . . 'You shall not have her,
Bronson.'" Quite! He was throwing her into the river instead, to the
words: "John T. Bronson dives." There he goes! He has her by her
flowing hair! But Hairy Pete is kneeling on the bank. The bullets
chip the water. Through the heroine's fair perforated shoulder the
landscape is almost visible. What is that sound? Yes! John T. Bronson
is setting his teeth! He lands, he drags her out. From his cap he
takes his automatic. Still dry--thank God!</p>

<p>"Look to yourself, Hairy Pete!" A puff of smoke. Pete squirms and
bites the sand--he seems almost to absorb the desert. "Hairy Pete
gets it for keeps!" Slow music, slower! John T. Bronson raises the
reviving form. Upon the bank of the Pima river they stand embraced,
and the sun sets. "At last, my dinky love!"</p>

<p>'Pom, pom! that's the stuff!' thought Michael, returning to the
light of night: 'Back to the Land! "Plough the fields and
scatter"--when they can get this? Not much!' And he turned West
again, taking a seat on the top of a 'bus beside a man with
grease-stains on his clothes. They travelled in silence till Michael
said:</p>

<p>"What do you make of the political situation, sir?"</p>

<p>The possible plumber replied, without turning his head:</p>

<p>"I should say they've overreached theirselves."</p>

<p>"Ought to have fought on Russia--oughtn't they?"</p>

<p>"Russia--that cock won't fight either. Nao--ought to 'ave 'eld on
to the Spring, an' fought on a good stiff Budget."</p>

<p>"Real class issue?"</p>

<p>"Yus!"</p>

<p>"But do you think class politics can wipe out unemployment?"</p>

<p>The man's mouth moved under his moustache as if mumbling a new
idea.</p>

<p>"Ah! I'm fed up with politics; in work to-day and out
to-morrow--what's the good of politics that can't give you a
permanent job?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"Reparations," said his neighbour; <i>"we're</i> not goin' to
benefit by reparations. The workin' classes ought to stand together
in every country." And he looked at Michael to see how he liked
<i>that.</i></p>

<p>"A good many people thought so before the war; and see what
happened."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the man, "and what good's it done us?"</p>

<p>"Have you thought of emigrating to the Dominions?"</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"Don't like what I see of the Austrylians and Canydians."</p>

<p>"Confirmed Englishman--like myself."</p>

<p>"That's right," said the man. "So long, Mister," and he got
off.</p>

<p>Michael travelled till the 'bus put him down under Big Ben, and it
was nearly twelve. Another election! Could he stand a second time
without showing his true colours? Not the faintest hope of making
Foggartism clear to a rural constituency in three weeks! If he spoke
from now till the day of the election, they would merely think he
held rather extreme views on Imperial Preference, which, by the way,
he did. He could never tell the electorate that he thought England
was on the wrong tack--one might just as well not stand. He could
never buttonhole the ordinary voter, and say to him: "Look here, you
know, there's no earthly hope of any real improvement for another ten
years; in the meantime we must face the music, and pay more for
everything, so that twenty years hence we may be safe from possible
starvation, and self-supporting within the Empire." It wasn't done.
Nor could he say to his Committee: "My friends, I represent a policy
that no one else does, so far."</p>

<p>No! If he meant to stand again, he must just get the old wheezes
off his chest. But did he mean to stand again? Few people had less
conceit than Michael--he knew himself for a lightweight. But he had
got this bee into his bonnet; the longer he lived the more it buzzed,
the more its buzz seemed the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
and that wilderness his country. To stop up that buzzing in his ears;
to turn his back on old Blythe; to stifle his convictions, and yet
remain in Parliament--he could not! It was like the war over again.
Once in, you couldn't get out. And he was 'in'--committed to
something deeper far than the top dressings of Party politics.
Foggartism had a definite solution of England's troubles to work
towards--an independent, balanced Empire; an England safe in the air,
and free from unemployment--with Town and Country once more in some
sort of due proportion! Was it such a hopeless dream? Apparently!</p>

<p>'Well,' thought Michael, putting his latchkey in his door, 'they
may call me what kind of a bee fool they like--I shan't budge.' He
went up to his dressing-room and, opening the window, leaned out.</p>

<p>The rumourous town still hummed; the sky was faintly coloured by
reflection from its million lights. A spire was visible, some stars;
the tree foliage in the Square hung flat, unstirred by wind. Peaceful
and almost warm--the night. Michael remembered a certain evening--the
last London air raid of the war. From his convalescent hospital he
had watched it for three hours.</p>

<p>'What fools we all are not to drop fighting in the air,' he
thought: 'Well, if we don't, I shall go all out for a great air
force--all hangs, for us, on safety from air attack. Even the wise
can understand that.'</p>

<p>Two men had stopped beneath his window, talking. One was his
next-door neighbour.</p>

<p>"Mark my words," said his neighbour, "the election'll see a big
turnover."</p>

<p>"Yes; and what are you going to do with it?" said the other.</p>

<p>"Let things alone; they'll right themselves. I'm sick of all this
depressing twaddle. A shilling off the Income Tax, and you'll
see."</p>

<p>"How are you going to deal with the Land?"</p>

<p>"Oh! damn the Land! Leave it to itself, that's all the farmers
really want. The more you touch it, the worse it gets."</p>

<p>"Let the grass grow under your feet?"</p>

<p>The neighbour laughed. "That's about it. Well, what else
<i>can</i> you do--the Country won't have it. Good night!"</p>

<p>Sounds of a door, of footsteps. A car drove by; a moth flew in
Michael's face. "The Country won't have it!" Policies! What but
mental yawns, long shrugs of the shoulders, trustings to Luck! What
else could they be? <i>The country wouldn't have it!</i> And Big Ben
struck twelve.</p>

<h2><a name="C13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>INCEPTION OF THE CASE</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>There are people in every human hive born to focus talk; perhaps
their magnetism draws the human tongue, or their lives are lived at
an acute angle. Of such was Marjorie Ferrar--one of the most
talked-of young women in London. Whatever happened to her was
rumoured at once in that collection of the busy and the idle called
Society. That she had been ejected from a drawing-room was swiftly
known. Fleur's letters about her became current gossip. The reasons
for ejectment varied from truth to a legend that she had lifted
Michael from the arms of his wife.</p>

<p>The origins of lawsuits are seldom simple. And when Soames called
it all 'a storm in a teacup,' he might have been right if Lord
Charles Ferrar had not been so heavily in debt that he had withdrawn
his daughter's allowance; if, too, a Member for a Scottish borough,
Sir Alexander MacGown, had not for some time past been pursuing her
with the idea of marriage. Wealth made out of jute, a rising
Parliamentary repute, powerful physique, and a determined character,
had not advanced Sir Alexander's claims in twelve months so much as
the withdrawal of her allowance advanced them in a single night.
Marjorie Ferrar was, indeed, of those who can always get money at a
pinch, but even to such come moments when they have seriously to
consider what kind of pinch. In proportion to her age and sex, she
was 'dipped' as badly as her father, and the withdrawal of her
allowance was in the nature of a last straw. In a moment of
discouragement she consented to an engagement, not yet to be made
public. When the incident at Fleur's came to Sir Alexander's ears, he
went to his bethrothed flaming. What could he do?</p>

<p>"Nothing, of course; don't be silly, Alec! Who cares?"</p>

<p>"The thing's monstrous. Let me go and exact an apology from this
old blackguard."</p>

<p>"Father's been, and he wouldn't give it. He's got a chin you could
hang a kettle on."</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Marjorie, you've got to make our engagement
public, and let me get to work on him. I won't have this story going
about."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar shook her head.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, my dear. You're still on probation. I don't care a
tuppenny ice about the story."</p>

<p>"Well, I do, and I'm going to that fellow tomorrow."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar studied his face--its brown, burning eyes, its
black, stiff hair, its jaw--shivered slightly, and had a
brain-wave.</p>

<p>"You will do nothing of the kind, Alec, or you'll spill your ink.
My father wants me to bring an action. He says I shall get swinging
damages."</p>

<p>The Scotsman in MacGown applauded, the lover quailed.</p>

<p>"That may be very unpleasant for you," he muttered, "unless the
brute settles out of Court."</p>

<p>"Of course he'll settle. I've got all his evidence in my
vanity-bag."</p>

<p>MacGown gripped her by the shoulders and gave her a fierce
kiss.</p>

<p>"If he doesn't, I'll break every bone in his body."</p>

<p>"My dear! He's nearly seventy, I should think."</p>

<p>"H'm! Isn't there a young man in the same boat with him?"</p>

<p>"Michael? Oh! Michael's a dear. I couldn't have his bones
broken."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said MacGown. "Wait till he launches this precious
Foggartism they talk of--dreary rot! I'll eat him!"</p>

<p>"Poor little Michael!"</p>

<p>"I heard something about an American boy, too."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Marjorie Ferrar, releasing herself from his grip. "A
bird of passage--don't bother about him."</p>

<p>"Have you got a lawyer?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"I'll send you mine. He'll make them sit up!"</p>

<p>She remained pensive after he had left her, distrusting her own
brain-wave. If only she weren't so hard up! She had learned during
this month of secret engagement that "Nothing for nothing and only
fair value for sixpence" ruled North of the Tweed as well as South.
He had taken a good many kisses and given her one trinket which she
dared not take to 'her Uncle's.' It began to look as if she would
have to marry him. The prospect was in some ways not repulsive--he
was emphatically a man; her father would take care that she only
married him on terms as liberal as his politics; and perhaps her
motto 'Live dangerously' could be even better carried out with him
than without. Resting inert in a long chair, she thought of Francis
Wilmot. Hopeless as husband, he might be charming as lover,
na&iuml;ve, fresh, unknown in London, absurdly devoted, oddly
attractive, with his lithe form, dark eyes, engaging smile. Too
old-fashioned for words, he had made it clear already that he wanted
to marry her. He was a baby. But until she was beyond his reach, she
had begun to feel that he was beyond hers. After? Well, who knew? She
lived in advance, dangerously, with Francis Wilmot. In the meantime
this action for slander was a bore! And shaking the idea out of her
head, she ordered her horse, changed her clothes, and repaired to the
Row. After that she again changed her clothes, went to the Cosmopolis
Hotel, and danced with her mask-faced partner, and Francis Wilmot.
After that she changed her clothes once more, went to a first night,
partook of supper afterwards with the principal actor and his party,
and was in bed by two o'clock.</p>

<p>Like most reputations, that of Marjorie Ferrar received more than
its deserts. If you avow a creed of indulgence, you will be indulged
by the credulous. In truth she had only had two love-affairs passing
the limits of decorum; had smoked opium once, and been sick over it;
and had sniffed cocaine just to see what it was like. She gambled
only with discretion, and chiefly on race-horses; drank with strict
moderation and a good head; smoked of course, but the purest
cigarettes she could get, and through a holder. If she had learned
suggestive forms of dancing, she danced them but once in a blue moon.
She rarely rode at a five-barred gate, and that only on horses whose
powers she knew. To be in the know she read, of course, anything
'extreme,' but would not go out of her way to do so. She had flown,
but just to Paris. She drove a car well, and of course fast, but,
never to the danger of herself, and seldom to the real danger of the
public. She had splendid health, and took care of it in private. She
could always sleep at ten minutes' notice, and when she sat up half
the night, slept half the day. She was 'in' with the advanced
theatre, but took it as it came. Her book of poems, which had
received praise because they emanated from one of a class supposed to
be unpoetic, was remarkable not so much for irregularity of thought
as for irregularity of metre. She was, in sum, credited with a too
strict observance of her expressed creed: 'Take life in both hands,
and eat it.'</p>

<p>This was why Sir Alexander MacGown's lawyer sat on the edge of his
chair in her studio the following morning, and gazed at her intently.
He knew her renown better than Sir Alexander. Messrs. Settlewhite and
Stark liked to be on the right side of a matter before they took it
up. How far would this young lady, with her very attractive
appearance and her fast reputation, stand fire? For costs--they had
Sir Alexander's guarantee and the word 'traitress' was a good enough
beginning; but in cases of word against word, it was ill
predicting.</p>

<p>Her physiognomy impressed Mr. Settlewhite favourably. She would
not 'get rattled' in Court, if he were any judge; nor had she the
Aubrey Beardsley cast of feature he had been afraid of, that might
alienate a Jury. No! an upstanding young woman with a good blue eye
and popular hair. She would do, if her story were all right.</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar, in turn, scrutinised one who looked as if he
might take things out of her hands. Long-faced, with grey deep eyes
under long dark lashes, with all his hair, and good clothes, he was
as well preserved a man of sixty as she had ever seen.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to tell you, Mr. Settlewhite?"</p>

<p>"The truth."</p>

<p>"Oh! but naturally. Well, I was just saying to Mr. Quinsey that
Mrs. Mont was very eager to form a 'salon,' and had none of the right
qualities, and the old person who overheard me thought I was
insulting her--"</p>

<p>"That all?"</p>

<p>"Well, I may have said she was fond of lions; and so she is."</p>

<p>"Yes; but why did he call you a traitress?"</p>

<p>"Because she was his daughter and my hostess, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Will this Mr. Quinsey confirm you?"</p>

<p>"Philip Quinsey?--oh! rather! He's in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Did anybody else overhear you running her down?"</p>

<p>She hesitated a second. "No."</p>

<p>'First lie!' thought Mr. Settlewhite, with his peculiar
sweet-sarcastic smile. "What about an American?"</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar laughed. "He won't say so, anyway."</p>

<p>"An admirer?"</p>

<p>"No. He's going back to America."</p>

<p>'Second lie!' thought Mr. Settlewhite. 'But she tells them
well.'</p>

<p>"You want an apology you can show to those who overheard the
insult; and what we can get, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The more the better."</p>

<p>'Speaking the truth there,' thought Mr. Settlewhite. "Are you hard
up?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't well be harder."</p>

<p>Mr. Settlewhite put one hand on each knee, and reared his slim
body.</p>

<p>"You don't want it to come into Court?"</p>

<p>"No; though I suppose it might be rather fun."</p>

<p>Mr. Settlewhite smiled again.</p>

<p>"That entirely depends on how many skeletons you have in your
cupboard."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar also smiled.</p>

<p>"I shall put everything in your hands," she said.</p>

<p>"Not <i>them,</i> my dear young lady. Well, we'll serve him and
see how the cat jumps; but he's a man of means and a lawyer."</p>

<p>"I think he'll hate having anything about his daughter brought out
in Court."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Settlewhite, drily. "So should I."</p>

<p>"And she <i>is</i> a little snob, you know."</p>

<p>"Ah! Did you happen to use that word?"</p>

<p>"N-no; I'm pretty sure I didn't."</p>

<p>'Third lie!' thought Mr. Settlewhite: 'not so well told.'</p>

<p>"It makes a difference. Quite sure?"</p>

<p>"Not quite."</p>

<p>"He says you did?"</p>

<p>"Well, I told him he was a liar."</p>

<p>"Oh! did you? And they heard you?"</p>

<p>"Rather!"</p>

<p>"That may be important."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he'll say I called her a snob, in Court,
anyway."</p>

<p>"That's very shrewd, Miss Ferrar," said Mr. Settlewhite. "I think
we shall do."</p>

<p>And with a final look at her from under his long lashes, he
stalked, thin and contained, to the door.</p>

<p>Three days later Soames received a legal letter. It demanded a
formal apology, and concluded with the words "failing it, action will
be taken." Twice in his life he had brought actions himself; once for
breach of contract, once for divorce; and now to be sued for slander!
In every case he had been the injured party, in his own opinion. He
was certainly not going to apologise. Under the direct threat he felt
much calmer. He had nothing to be ashamed of. He would call that
'baggage' a traitress to her face again to-morrow, and pay for the
luxury, if need be. His mind roved back to when, in the early
'eighties, as a very young lawyer, he had handled his Uncle Swithin's
defence against a fellow member of the Walpole Club. Swithin had
called him in public "a little touting whipper-snapper of a parson."
He remembered how he had whittled the charge down to the word
'whipper-snapper,' by proving the plaintiff's height to be five feet
four, his profession the church, his habit the collection of money
for the purpose of small-clothing the Fiji islanders. The Jury had
assessed 'whipper-snapper' at ten pounds--Soames always believed the
small clothes had done it. His Counsel had made great game of
them--Bobstay, Q. C. There <i>were</i> Counsel in those days; the Q.
C.'s had been better than the K. C.'s were. Bobstay would have gone
clean through this 'baggage' and come out on the other side. Uncle
Swithin had asked him to dinner afterwards and given him York ham
with Madeira sauce, and his special Heidsieck. He had never given
anybody anything else. Well! There must still be cross-examiners who
could tear a reputation to tatters, especially if there wasn't one to
tear. And one could always settle at the last moment if one wished.
There was no possibility anyway of Fleur being dragged in as witness
or anything of that sort.</p>

<p>He was thunder-struck, a week later, when Michael rang him up at
Mapledurham to say that Fleur had been served with a writ for libel
in letters containing among others the expressions 'a snake of the
first water' and 'she hasn't a moral about her.'</p>

<p>Soames went cold all over. "I told you not to let her go about
abusing that woman."</p>

<p>"I know; but she doesn't consult me every time she writes a letter
to a friend."</p>

<p>"Pretty friend!" said Soames into the mouthpiece. "This is a nice
pair of shoes!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I'm very worried. She's absolutely spoiling for a
fight--won't hear of an apology."</p>

<p>Soames grunted so deeply that Michael's ear tingled forty miles
away.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Leave it to me," said Soames. "I'll come up to-night. Has she any
evidence, to support those words?"</p>

<p>"Well, she says--"</p>

<p>"No," said Soames, abruptly, "don't tell me over the 'phone." And
he rang off. He went out on to the lawn. Women! Petted and
spoiled--thought they could say what they liked! And so they could
till they came up against another woman. He stopped by the boat-house
and gazed at the river. The water was nice and clean, and there it
was--flowing down to London to get all dirty! That feverish,
quarrelsome business up there! Now he would have to set to and rake
up all he could against this Ferrar woman, and frighten her off. It
was distasteful. But nothing else for it, if Fleur was to be kept out
of Court! Terribly petty. Society lawsuits--who ever got anything out
of them, save heart-burning and degradation? Like the war, you might
win and regret it ever afterwards, or lose and regret it more. All
temper! Jealousy and temper!</p>

<p>In the quiet autumn light, with the savour of smoke in his
nostrils from his gardener's first leaf bonfire, Soames felt moral.
Here was his son-in-law, wanting to do some useful work in
Parliament, and make a name for the baby, and Fleur beginning to
settle down and take a position; and now this had come along, and all
the chatterers and busy mockers in Society would be gnashing on them
with their teeth--if they had any! He looked at his shadow on the
bank, grotesquely slanting towards the water as if wanting to drink.
Everything was grotesque, if it came to that! In Society, England,
Europe--shadows scrimmaging and sprawling; scuffling and posturing;
the world just marking time before another Flood! H'm! He moved
towards the river. There went his shadow, plunging in before him!
They would all plunge into that mess of cold water if they didn't
stop their squabblings. And, turning abruptly, he entered his
kitchen-garden. Nothing unreal there, and most things running to
seed--stalks, and so on! How to set about raking up the past of this
young woman? Where was it? These young sparks and fly-by-nights! They
all had pasts, no doubt; but the definite, the concrete bit of
immorality alone was of use, and when it came to the point, was
unobtainable, he shouldn't wonder. People didn't like giving chapter
and verse! It was risky, and not the thing! Tales out of school!</p>

<p>And, among his artichokes, approving of those who did not tell
tales, disapproving of any one who wanted them told, Soames resolved
grimly that told they must be. The leaf-fire smouldered, and the
artichokes smelled rank, the sun went down behind the high brick wall
mellowed by fifty years of weather; all was peaceful and chilly,
except in his heart. Often now, morning or evening, he would walk
among his vegetables--they were real and restful, and you could eat
them. They had better flavour than the green-grocer's and saved his
bill--middlemen's profiteering and all that. Perhaps they represented
atavistic instincts in this great-grandson of 'Superior Dosset's'
father, that last of a long line of Forsyte 'agriculturists.' He set
more and more store by vegetables the older he grew. When Fleur was a
little bit of a thing, he would find her when he came back from the
City, seated among the sunflowers or black currants, nursing her
doll. He had once taken a bee out of her hair, and the little brute
had stung him. Best years he ever had, before she grew up and took to
this gadabout Society business, associating with women who went
behind her back. Apology! So she wouldn't hear of one? She was in the
right. But to be in the right and have to go into Court because of
it, was one of the most painful experiences that could be undergone.
The Courts existed to penalise people who were in the right--in
divorce, breach of promise, libel and the rest of it. Those who were
in the wrong went to the South of France, or if they did appear,
defaulted afterwards and left you to pay your costs. Had he not
himself had to pay them in his action against Bosinney? And in his
divorce suit had not Young Jolyon and Irene been in Italy when he
brought it? And yet, he couldn't bear to think of Fleur eating
humble-pie to that red-haired cat. Among the gathering shadows, his
resolve hardened. Secure evidence that would frighten the baggage
into dropping the whole thing like a hot potato--it was the only
way!</p>

<h2><a name="C14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>FURTHER CONSIDERATION</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Government had 'taken their toss' over the Editor--no one
could say precisely why--and Michael sat down to compose his Address.
How say enough without saying anything? And, having impetuously
written: "Electors of Mid-Bucks," he remained for many moments still
as a man who has had too good a dinner. "If"--he traced words
slowly--"if you again return me as your representative, I shall do my
best for the Country according to my lights. I consider the
limitation of armaments, and, failing that, the security of Britain
through the enlargement of our Air defences; the development of home
agriculture; the elimination of unemployment through increased
emigration to the Dominions; and the improvement of the national
health particularly through the abatement of slums and smoke, to be
the most pressing and immediate concerns of British policy. If I am
returned, I shall endeavour to foster these ends with determination
and coherence; and try not to abuse those whose opinions differ from
my own. At my meetings I shall seek to give you some concrete idea of
what is in my mind, and submit myself to your questioning."</p>

<p>Dared he leave it at that? Could one issue an address containing
no disparagement of the other side, no panegyric of his own? Would
his Committee allow it? Would the electors swallow it? Well, if his
Committee didn't like it--they could turn it down, and himself with
it; only--they wouldn't have time to get another candidate!</p>

<p>The Committee, indeed, did not like it, but they lumped it; and
the Address went out with an effigy on it of Michael, looking, as he
said, like a hair-dresser. Thereon he plunged into a fray, which,
like every other, began in the general and ended in the
particular.</p>

<p>During the first Sunday lull at Lippinghall, he developed his
poultry scheme--by marking out sites, and deciding how water could be
laid on. The bailiff was sulky. In his view it was throwing away
money. "Fellers like that!" Who was going to teach them the job? He
had no time, himself. It would run into hundreds, and might just as
well be poured down the gutter. "The townsman's no mortial use on the
land, Master Michael."</p>

<p>"So everybody says. But, look here, Tutfield, here are three 'down
and outs,' two of them ex-Service, and you've got to help me put this
through. You say yourself this land's all right for poultry--well,
it's doing no good now. Bowman knows every last thing about chickens;
set him on to it until these chaps get the hang. Be a good fellow and
put your heart into it; you wouldn't like being 'down and out'
yourself."</p>

<p>The bailiff had a weakness for Michael, whom he had known from his
bottle up. He knew the result, but if Master Michael liked to throw
his father's money away, it was no business of his. He even went so
far as to mention that he knew "a feller" who had a hut for sale not
ten miles away; and that there was "plenty of wood in the copse for
the cuttin'."</p>

<p>On the Tuesday after the Government had fallen Michael went up to
town and summoned a meeting of his 'down and outs.' They came at
three the following day, and he placed them in chairs round the
dining-table. Standing under the Goya, like a general about to detail
a plan of attack which others would have to execute, he developed his
proposal. The three faces expressed little, and that without
conviction. Only Bergfeld had known anything of it, before, and his
face was the most doubting.</p>

<p>"I don't know in the least," went on Michael, "what you think of
it; but you all want jobs--two of you in the open, and you, Boddick,
don't mind what it is, I think."</p>

<p>"That's right, sir," said Boddick, "I'm on."</p>

<p>Michael instantly put him down as the best man of the three.</p>

<p>The other two were silent till Bergfeld said:</p>

<p>"If I had my savings--"</p>

<p>Michael interrupted quickly:</p>

<p>"I'm putting in the capital; you three put in the brains and
labour. It's probably not more than a bare living, but I hope it'll
be a healthy one. What do <i>you</i> say, Mr. Swain?"</p>

<p>The hair-dresser, more shadow-stricken than ever, in the glow of
Fleur's Spanish room, smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm sure it's very kind of you. I don't mind havin' a try--only,
who's goin' to boss the show?"</p>

<p>"Co-operation, Mr. Swain."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the hair-dresser; "thought so. But I've seen a lot of
tries at that, and it always ends in one bloke swallerin' the
rest."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Michael, suddenly, "I'll boss it. But if any of
you crane at the job, say so at once, and have done with it.
Otherwise I'll get that hut delivered and set up, and we'll start
this day month."</p>

<p>Boddick got up, and said: "Right, sir. What about my
children?"</p>

<p>"How old, Boddick?"</p>

<p>"Two little girls, four and five."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes!" Michael had forgotten this item. "We must see about
that."</p>

<p>Boddick touched his forelock, shook Michael's hand, and went out.
The other two remained standing.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mr. Bergfeld; good-bye, Mr. Swain!"</p>

<p>"If I might--"</p>

<p>"Could I speak to you for a minute?"</p>

<p>"Anything you have to say," said Michael, astutely, "had better be
said in each other's presence."</p>

<p>"I've always been used to hair."</p>

<p>'Pity,' thought Michael, 'that Life didn't drop that "h" for
him--poor beggar!' "Well, we'll get you a breed of birds that can be
shingled," he said. The hairdresser smiled down one side of his face.
"Beggars can't be choosers," he remarked.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> wished to ask you," said Bergfeld, "what system we shall
adopt?"</p>

<p>"That's got to be worked out. Here are two books on
poultry-keeping; you'd better read one each, and swop."</p>

<p>He noted that Bergfeld took both without remonstrance on the part
of Swain.</p>

<p>Seeing them out into the Square, he thought: 'Rum team! It won't
work, but they've got their chance.'</p>

<p>A young man who had been standing on the pavement came
forward.</p>

<p>"Mr. Michael Mont, M. P.?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Michael Mont at home?"</p>

<p>"I think so. What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I must see her personally, please."</p>

<p>"Who are you from?"</p>

<p>"Messrs. Settlewhite and Stark--a suit."</p>

<p>"Dressmakers?"</p>

<p>The young man smiled.</p>

<p>"Come in," said Michael. "I'll see if she's at home."</p>

<p>Fleur was in the 'parlour.'</p>

<p>"A young man from some dressmaker's for you, dear."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Michael Mont? In the suit of Ferrar against Mont--libel.
Good day, madam."</p>

<p>Between those hours of four and eight, when Soames arrived from
Mapledurham, Michael suffered more than Fleur. To sit and see a legal
operation performed on her with all the scientific skill of the
British Bar, it was an appalling prospect; and there would be no
satisfaction in Marjorie Ferrar's also being on the table, with her
inside exposed to the gaze of all! He was only disconcerted,
therefore, when Fleur said:</p>

<p>"All right; if she wants to be opened up, she shall be. I know she
flew to Paris with Walter Nazing last November; and I've always been
told she was Bertie Curfew's mistress for a year."</p>

<p>A Society case--cream for all the cats in Society, muck for all
the blow-flies in the streets--and Fleur the hub of it! He waited for
Soames with impatience. Though 'Old Forsyte's' indignation had
started this, Michael turned to him now, as to an anchor let go off a
lee shore. The 'old man' had experience, judgment, and a chin; he
would know what, except bearing it with a grin, could be done. Gazing
at a square foot of study wall which had escaped a framed caricature,
he reflected on the underlying savagery of life. He would be eating a
lobster to-night that had been slowly boiled alive! This study had
been cleaned out by a charwoman whose mother was dying of cancer,
whose son had lost a leg in the war, and who looked so jolly tired
that he felt quite bad whenever he thought of her. The Bergfelds,
Swains and Boddicks of the world--the Camden Towns, and Mile
Ends--the devastated regions of France, the rock villages of Italy!
Over it all what a thin crust of gentility! Members of Parliament,
and ladies of fashion, like himself and Fleur, simpering and sucking
silver spoons, and now and then dropping spoons and simper, and going
for each other like Kilkenny cats!</p>

<p>"What evidence has she got to support those words?" Michael racked
his memory. This was going to be a game of bluff. That Walter Nazing
and Marjorie Ferrar had flown to Paris together appeared to him of
next to no importance. People could still fly in couples with
impunity; and as to what had happened afterwards in the great
rabbit-warren Outre Manche--Pff! The Bertie Curfew affair was
different. Smoke of a year's duration probably had fire behind it. He
knew Bertie Curfew, the enterprising Director of the 'Ne Plus Ultra
Play Society,' whose device was a stork swallowing a frog--a long
young man, with long young hair that shone and was brushed back, and
a long young record; a strange mixture of enthusiasm and contempt,
from one to the other of which he passed with extreme suddenness. His
sister, of whom he always spoke as 'Poor Norah,' in Michael's opinion
was worth ten of him. She ran a Children's House in Bethnal Green,
and had eyes from which meanness and evil shrank away.</p>

<p>Big Ben thumped out eight strokes; the Dandie barked, and Michael
knew that Soames had come.</p>

<p>Very silent during dinner, Soames opened the discussion over a
bottle of Lippinghall Madeira by asking to see the writ.</p>

<p>When Fleur had brought it, he seemed to go into a trance.</p>

<p>'The old boy,' thought Michael, 'is thinking of his past. Wish
he'd come to!'</p>

<p>"Well, Father?" said Fleur at last.</p>

<p>As if from long scrutiny of a ghostly Court of Justice, Soames
turned his eyes on his daughter's face.</p>

<p>"You won't eat your words, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Fleur tossed her now de-shingled head. "Do you want me to?"</p>

<p>"Can you substantiate them? You mustn't rely on what was told
you--that isn't evidence."</p>

<p>"I know that Amabel Nazing came here and said that she didn't mind
Walter flying to Paris with Majorie Ferrar, but that she did object
to not having been told beforehand, so that she herself could have
flown to Paris with somebody else."</p>

<p>"We could subpoena that young woman," said Soames.</p>

<p>Fleur shook her head. "She'd never give Walter away in Court."</p>

<p>"H'm! What else about this Miss Ferrar?"</p>

<p>"Everybody knows of her relationship with Bertie Curfew."</p>

<p>"Yes," Michael put in, "and between 'everybody knows' and
'somebody tells' is a great gap fixed."</p>

<p>Soames nodded.</p>

<p>"She just wants money out of us," cried Fleur; "she's always hard
up. As if she cared whether people thought her moral or not! She
despises morality--all her set do."</p>

<p>"Ah! Her view of morality!" said Soames, deeply; he was suddenly
seeing a British Jury confronted by a barrister describing the modern
view of morals: "No need, perhaps, to go into personal details."</p>

<p>Michael started up.</p>

<p>"By Jove, sir, you've hit it! If you can get her to admit that
she's read certain books, seen or acted in certain plays, danced
certain dances, worn certain clothes--" He fell back again into his
chair; what if the other side started asking Fleur the same
questions? Was it not the fashion to keep abreast of certain things,
however moral one might really be? Who could stand up and profess to
be shocked, to-day?</p>

<p>"Well?" said Soames.</p>

<p>"Only that one's own point of view isn't quite a British Jury's,
sir. Even yours and ours, I expect, don't precisely tally."</p>

<p>Soames looked at his daughter. He understood. Loose talk--afraid
of being out of the fashion--evil communications corrupting all
profession of good manners! Still, no Jury could look at her face
without--who could resist the sudden raising of those white lids?
Besides, she was a mother, and the other woman wasn't; or if she
was--she shouldn't be! No, he held to his idea. A clever fellow at
the Bar could turn the whole thing into an indictment of the fast set
and modern morality, and save all the invidiousness of exposing a
woman's private life.</p>

<p>"You give me the names of her set and those books and plays and
dancing clubs and things," he said. "I'll have the best man at the
Bar."</p>

<p>Michael rose from the little conference somewhat eased in mind. If
the matter could be shifted from the particular to the general; if,
instead of attacking Marjorie Ferrar's practice, the defence could
attack her theory, it would not be so dreadful. Soames took him apart
in the hall.</p>

<p>"I shall want all the information I can get about that young man
and her."</p>

<p>Michael's face fell.</p>

<p>"You can't get it from me, sir, I haven't got it."</p>

<p>"She must be frightened," said Soames. "If I can frighten her, I
can probably settle it out of Court without an apology."</p>

<p>"I see; use the information out of Court, but not in."</p>

<p>Soames nodded. "I shall tell them that we shall justify. Give me
the young man's address."</p>

<p>"Macbeth Chambers, Bloomsbury. It's close to the British Museum.
But do remember, sir, that to air Miss Ferrar's linen in Court will
be as bad for us as for her."</p>

<p>Again Soames nodded.</p>

<p>When Fleur and her father had gone up, Michael lit a cigarette,
and passed back into the 'parlour.' He sat down at the clavichord.
The instrument made very little noise--so he could strum on it
without fear of waking the eleventh baronet. From a Spanish tune
picked up three years ago on his honeymoon, whose savagery always
soothed him, his fingers wandered on: "I got a crown, you got a
crown--all God's childern got a crown! Eb'ryone dat talk 'bout 'Eaben
ain't goin' dere. All God's childern got a crown."</p>

<p>Glass lustres on the walls gleamed out at him. As a child he had
loved the colours of his aunt Pamela's glass chandeliers in the
panelled rooms at Brook Street; but when he knew what was what, he
and every one had laughed at them. And now lustres had come in again;
and Aunt Pamela had gone out! "She had a crown--he had a crown--"
Confound that tune! "<i>Aupr&egrave;s de ma blonde</i>--<i>il fait
bon</i>--<i>fait bon</i>--<i>fait bon; Aupr&egrave;s de ma blonde, il
fait bon dormir."</i></p>

<p>His 'blonde'--not so very blonde, either--would be in bed by now.
Time to go up! But still he strummed on, and his mind wandered in and
out--of poultry and politics, Old Forsyte, Fleur, Foggartism, and the
Ferrar girl--like a man in a maelstrom whirling round with his head
just above water. Who was it said the landing-place for modernity was
a change of heart; the re-birth of a belief that life was worth
while, and better life attainable? 'Better life?' Prerogative of
priests? Not now. Humanity had got to save itself! To save
itself--what was that, after all, but expression of 'the will to
live'? But did humanity will to live as much as it used? That was the
point. Michael stopped strumming and listened to the silence. Not
even a clock ticking--time was inhospitable in 'parlours'; and
England asleep outside. Was the English 'will to live' as strong as
ever; or had they all become so spoiled, so sensitive to life, that
they had weakened on it? Had they sucked their silver spoon so long
that, threatened with a spoon of bone, they preferred to get down
from table? 'I don't believe it,' thought Michael, 'I won't believe
it. Only where are we going? Where am I going? Where are all God's
children going?' To bed, it seemed! And Big Ben struck: One.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="C201">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>MICHAEL MAKES HIS SPEECH</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When in the new Parliament Michael rose to deliver his maiden
effort towards the close of the debate on the King's Speech, he had
some notes in his hand and not an idea in his head. His heart was
beating and his knees felt weak. The policy he was charged to
express, if not precisely new in concept, was in reach and method so
much beyond current opinion, that he awaited nothing but laughter.
His would be a stray wind carrying the seed of a new herb into a
garden, so serried and so full that no corner would welcome its
growth. There was a plant called Chinese weed which having got hold
never let go, and spread till it covered everything. Michael desired
for Foggartism the career of Chinese weed; but all he expected was
the like of what he had seen at Monterey on his tour round the world
after the war. Chance had once brought to that Californian shore the
seeds of the Japanese yew. In thick formation the little dark trees
had fought their way inland to a distance of some miles. That
battalion would never get farther now that native vegetation had been
consciously roused against it; but its thicket stood--a curious and
strong invader.</p>

<p>His first period had been so rehearsed that neither vacant mind
nor dry mouth could quite prevent delivery. Straightening his
waistcoat, and jerking his head back, he regretted that the Speech
from the throne foreshadowed no coherent and substantial policy such
as might hope to free the country from its present plague of
under-employment, and over-population. Economically speaking, any
foreseeing interpretation of the course of affairs must now place
Britain definitely in the orbit of the overseas world. . . . <i>("Oh!
oh!")</i> Ironical laughter so soon and sudden cleared Michael's
mind, and relaxed his lips; and, with the grin that gave his face a
certain charm, he resumed:</p>

<p>Speakers on all sides of the House, dwelling on the grave nature
of the Unemployment problem, had pinned their faith to the full
recapture of European trade, some in one way, some in another. August
as they were, he wished very humbly to remark that they could not eat
cake and have it. <i>(Laughter.)</i> Did they contend that wages in
Britain must come down and working hours be lengthened; or did they
assert that European wages must go up, and European working hours be
shortened? No, they had not had the temerity. Britain, which was to
rid itself of unemployment in the ways suggested, was the only
important country in the world which had to buy about seven-tenths of
its food, and of whose population well-nigh six-sevenths lived in
Towns. It employed those six-sevenths in producing articles in some
cases too dearly for European countries to buy, and yet it had to
sell a sufficient surplus above the normal exchanges of trade, to pay
for seven-tenths of the wherewithal to keep its producers alive.
<i>(A laugh.)</i> If this was a joke, it was a grim one. <i>(A</i>
<i>voice: "You have forgotten the carrying trade.")</i> He accepted
the honourable Member's correction, and hoped that he felt happy
about the future of that trade. It was, he feared, a somewhat
shrinking asset.</p>

<p>At this moment in his speech Michael himself became a somewhat
shrinking asset, overwhelmed by a sudden desire to drop Foggartism,
and sit down. The cool attention, the faint smiles, the expression on
the face of a past Prime Minister, seemed conspiring towards his
subsidence. 'How young--oh! how young you are!' they seemed to say.
'We sat here before you were breeched.' And he agreed with them
completely. Still there was nothing for it but to go on--with Fleur
in the Ladies' Gallery, old Blythe in the Distinguished Strangers';
yes, and something stubborn in his heart! Clenching the notes in his
hand, therefore, he proceeded:</p>

<p>In spite of the war, and because of the war, the population of
their Island had increased by 2,000,000. Emigration had fallen from
300,000 to 100,000. And this state of things was to be remedied by
the mere process of recapturing to the full European trade which,
quite obviously, had no intention of being so recaptured. What
alternative, then, was there? Some honourable Members, he was afraid
not many, would be familiar with the treatise of Sir James Foggart,
entitled "The Parlous State of England." <i>("Hear, hear!" from a
back Labour bench.)</i> He remembered to have read in a certain
organ, or perhaps he should say harmonium, of the Press, for it was
not a very deep-voiced instrument--<i>(laughter)</i>--that no such
crack-brained policy had ever been devised for British consumption.
<i>("Hear, hear!")</i> Certainly Foggartism was mad enough to look
ahead, to be fundamental, and to ask the country to face its own
position and the music into the bargain. . . .</p>

<p>About to go over 'the top'--with public confession of his faith
trembling behind his lips--Michael was choked by the sudden thought:
'Is it all right--is it what I think it, or am I an ignorant fool?'
He swallowed vigorously, and staring straight before him, went
on:</p>

<p>"Foggartism deprecates surface measures for a people in our
position; it asks the country to fix its mind on a date--say twenty
years hence--a minute in a nation's life--and to work steadily and
coherently up to that date. It demands recognition of the need to
make the British Empire, with its immense resources mostly latent, a
self-sufficing unit. Imperialists will ask: What is there new in
that? The novelty lies in degree and in method. Foggartism urges that
the British people should be familiarised with the Empire by
organised tours and propaganda on a great scale. It urges a vast
increase--based on this familiarisation--of controlled and equipped
emigration from these shores. But it has been found impossible, as
honourable members well know, to send out suitable grown folk in any
adequate quantity, because confirmed town-dwellers with their town
tastes and habits, and their physique already impaired by town life,
are of little use in the Dominions, while the few still on the
English land cannot be spared. Foggartism, therefore, would send out
boys and girls, between the ages of fourteen, or perhaps fifteen, and
eighteen, in great numbers. The House is aware that experiments in
this direction have already been made, with conspicuous success, but
such experiments are but a drop in the bucket. This is a matter which
can only be tackled in the way that things were tackled during the
war. Development of child emigration is wanted, in fact, on the same
scale and with the same energy as was manifested in Munitions after a
certain most honourable Member had put his shoulder to that
wheel--multiplication a hundredfold. Although the idea must naturally
prove abortive without the utmost good-will and co-operating energy
on the part of the Dominions, I submit that this co-operation is not
beyond the bounds of hope. The present hostility of people in the
Dominions towards British immigrants is due to their very reasonable
distrust of the usefulness of adult immigrants from this country.
Once they have malleable youth to deal with, that drawback vanishes.
In fact, the opening up of these vast new countries is like the
progress of a rolling snowball, each little bit of 'all right'--I beg
the House's pardon--picks up another little bit; and there is no
limit to the cumulative possibilities if a start is made at the right
end and the scheme pushed and controlled by the right people." Some
one behind him said: "Talking through his hat." Michael paused,
disconcerted; then, snatching at his bitt, went on: "A job of this
sort half done is better left alone, but in the war, when something
was found necessary, it <i>was</i> done, and men were always
available for the doing of it. I put it to the House that the
condition of our country now demands efforts almost as great as
then."</p>

<p>He could see that some members were actually listening to him with
attention, and, taking a deep breath, he went on:</p>

<p>"Leaving out Ireland--" <i>(A voice: "Why?")</i> "I prefer not to
touch on anything that does not like to be touched--"
<i>(laughter)</i> "the present ratio of white population between
Britain and the rest of the Empire is roughly in the nature of five
to two. Child Emigration on a great scale will go far to equalise
this ratio within twenty years; the British character of the British
Empire will be established for ever, and supply and demand between
the Mother Country and the Dominions will be levelled up." <i>(A
voice: "The Dominions will then supply themselves.")</i> "The
honourable Member will forgive me if I doubt that, for some time to
come. We have the start in the machinery of manufacture. It may, of
course, be five, seven, ten years before unemployment here comes down
even to the pre-war rate, but can you point to any other plan which
will really decrease it? I am all for good wages and moderate working
hours. I believe the standard in Britain and the new countries,
though so much higher than the European, is only a decent minimum,
and in some cases does not reach it; I want better wages, even more
moderate working hours; and the want is common among working men
wherever the British flag flies." <i>("Hear, hear!")</i> "They are
not going back on that want; and it is no good supposing that they
are!" <i>("Hear, hear!" "Oh! oh!")</i> "The equalisation of demand
and supply <i>within the empire</i> is the only way of preserving and
improving the standards of life, which are now recognised as
necessary on British soil. The world has so changed that the old
maxim 'buy in the cheapest, sell in the dearest market' is standing
on its head so far as England is concerned. Free Trade was never a
principle--" <i>("Oh! oh!" "Hear, hear!" and laughter.)</i> "Oh!
well, it was born twins with expediency, and the twins have got
mixed, and are both looking uncommonly peeky." <i>(Laughter.)</i>
"But I won't go into that. . . ." <i>(A voice: "Better not!")</i>
Michael could see the mouth it came from below a clipped moustache in
a red, black-haired face turned round at him from a Liberal bench. He
could not put a name to it, but he did not like the unpolitical
expression it wore. Where was he? Oh! yes. . . . "There is another
point in the Foggart programme: England, as she now is,
insufficiently protected in the air, and lamentably devoid of
food-producing power, is an abiding temptation to the aggressive
feelings of other nations. And here I must beg the House's pardon for
a brief reference to Cinderella--in other words, the Land. The Speech
from the throne gave no lead in reference to that vexed question,
beyond implying that a Conference of all interested will be called.
Well, without a definite intention in the minds of all the political
Parties to join in some fixed and long-lasting policy for
rehabilitation, such a Conference is bound to fail. Here again
Foggartism--" <i>("Ho! ho!")</i> "Here again Foggartism steps in.
Foggartism says: Lay down your Land policy <i>and don't change
it.</i> Let it be as sacred as the Prohibition Law in America." <i>(A
voice: "And as damned!" Laughter.)</i> "The sacred and damned--it
sounds like a novel by Dostoievski." <i>(Laughter.)</i> "Well, we
shall get nowhere without this damned sanctity. On our Land policy
depends not only the prosperity of farmers, landlords, and labourers,
desirable and important though that is, but the very existence of
England, if unhappily there should come another war under the new
conditions. Yes, and in a fixed land policy lies the only hope of
preventing the permanent deterioration of the British type.
Foggartism requires that we lay down our land policy, so that within
ten years we may be growing up to seventy per cent. of our food.
Estimates made during the war showed that as much as eighty-two per
cent. could be grown at a pinch; and the measures then adopted went a
long way to prove that this estimate was no more than truth. Why were
those measures allowed to drop? Why was all that great improvement
allowed to run to seed and grass? What is wanted is complete
confidence in every branch of home agriculture; and nothing but a
policy guaranteed over a long period can ever produce that
confidence." Michael paused. Close by, a member yawned; he heard a
shuffle of feet; another old Prime Minister came in; several members
were going out. There was nothing new about 'the Land.' Dared he
tackle the air--that third plank in the Foggart programme? There was
nothing new about the air either! Besides, he would have to preface
it by a plea for the abolition of air fighting, or at least for the
reduction of armaments. It would take too long! Better leave well
alone! He hurried on:</p>

<p>"Emigration! The Land! Foggartism demands for both the same
sweeping attention as was given to vital measures during the war. I
feel honoured in having been permitted to draw the attention of all
Parties to this--I will brave an honourable Member's disposition to
say 'Ho, ho!'--great treatise of Sir James Foggart. And I beg the
House's pardon for having been so long in fulfilling my task."</p>

<p>He sat down, after speaking for thirteen minutes. Off his chest!
An honourable Member rose.</p>

<p>"I must congratulate the Member for Mid-Bucks on what, despite its
acquaintanceship with the clouds, and its Lewis Carrollian appeal for
less bread, more taxes, we must all admit to be a lively and
well-delivered first effort. The Member for Tyne and Tees, earlier in
the Debate, made an allusion to the Party to which I have the honour
to belong, which--er--"</p>

<p>'Exactly!' thought Michael, and after waiting for the next speech,
which contained no allusion whatever to his own, he left the
House.</p>

<br>


<h2>RESULTS</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He walked home, lighter in head and heart. That was the trouble--a
light weight! No serious attention would be paid to him. He
recollected the maiden speech of the Member for Cornmarket. At least
he had stopped, to-day, as soon as the House began to fidget. He felt
hot, and hungry. Opera-singers grew fat through their voices, Members
of Parliament thin. He would have a bath.</p>

<p>He was half clothed again when Fleur came in.</p>

<p>"You did splendidly, Michael. That beast!"</p>

<p>"Which?"</p>

<p>"His name's MacGown."</p>

<p>"Sir Alexander MacGown? What about him?"</p>

<p>"You'll see to-morrow. He insinuated that you were interested in
the sale of the Foggart book, as one of its publishers."</p>

<p>"That's rather the limit."</p>

<p>"And all the rest of his speech was a cut-up; horrid tone about
the whole thing. Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"MacGown? No. He's Member for some Scottish borough."</p>

<p>"Well, he's an enemy. Blythe is awfully pleased with you, and wild
about MacGown; and so is Bart. I've never seen him so angry. You'll
have to write to <i>The Times</i> and explain that you've had no
interest in Danby &amp; Winter's since before you were elected. Bart
and your mother are coming to dinner. Did you know she was with
me?"</p>

<p>"Mother? She abhors politics."</p>

<p>"All she said was: 'I wish dear Michael would brush his hair back
before speaking. I like to see his forehead.' And when MacGown sat
down, she said: 'My dear, the back of that man's head is perfectly
straight. D'you think he's a Prussian? And he's got thick lobes to
his ears. I shouldn't like to be married to him!' She had her
opera-glasses."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence and Lady Mont were already in the 'parlour' when they
went down, standing opposite each other like two storks, if not
precisely on one leg, still very distinguished. Pushing Michael's
hair up, Lady Mont pecked his forehead, and her dove-like eyes gazed
at the top of his head from under their arched brows. She was
altogether a little Norman in her curves; she even arched her words.
She was considered "a deah; but not too frightfully all there."</p>

<p>"How did you manage to stick it, Mother?"</p>

<p>"My dear boy, I was thrilled; except for that person in jute. I
thought the shape of his head insufferable. Where did you get all
that knowledge? It was so sensible."</p>

<p>Michael grinned. "How did it strike you, sir?"</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence grimaced.</p>

<p>"You played the <i>enfant terrible,</i> my dear. Half the party
won't like it because they've never thought of it; and the other half
won't like it because they <i>have."</i></p>

<p>"What! Foggartists at heart?"</p>

<p>"Of course; but in Office. You mustn't support your real
convictions in Office--it's not done."</p>

<p>"This nice room," murmured Lady Mont. "When I was last here it was
Chinese. And where's the monkey?"</p>

<p>"In Michael's study, Mother. We got tired of him. Would you like
to see Kit before dinner?"</p>

<p>Left alone, Michael and his father stared at the same object, a
Louis Quinze snuff-box picked up by Soames.</p>

<p>"Would you take any notice of MacGown's insinuation, Dad?"</p>

<p>"Is that his name--the hairy haberdasher! I should."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Give him the lie."</p>

<p>"In private, in the Press, or in the House?"</p>

<p>"All three. In private I should merely call him a liar. In the
Press you should use the words: 'Reckless disregard for truth.' And
in Parliament--that you regret he 'should have been so misinformed.'
To complete the crescendo you might add that men's noses have been
pulled for less."</p>

<p>"But you don't suppose," said Michael, "that people would believe
a thing like that?"</p>

<p>"They will believe anything, my dear, that suggests corruption in
public life. It's one of the strongest traits in human nature.
Anxiety about the integrity of public men would be admirable, if it
wasn't so usually felt by those who have so little integrity
themselves that they can't give others credit for it." Sir Lawrence
grimaced, thinking of the P. P. R. S. "And talking of that--why
wasn't Old Forsyte in the House to-day?"</p>

<p>"I offered him a seat, but he said: He hadn't been in the House
since Gladstone moved the Home Rule Bill, and then only because he
was afraid his father would have a fit."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence screwed his eyeglass in.</p>

<p>"That's not clear to me," he said.</p>

<p>"His father had a pass, and didn't like to waste it."</p>

<p>"I see. That was noble of Old Forsyte."</p>

<p>"He said that Gladstone had been very windy."</p>

<p>"Ah! They were even longer in those days. You covered your ground
very quickly, Michael. I should say with practice you would do. I've
a bit of news for Old Forsyte. Shropshire doesn't speak to Charlie
Ferrar because the third time the old man paid his debts to prevent
his being posted, he made that a condition, for fear of being asked
again. It's not so lurid as I'd hoped. How's the action?"</p>

<p>"The last I heard was something about administering what they call
interrogatories."</p>

<p>"Ah! I know. They answer you in a way nobody can make head or tail
of, and that without prejudice. Then they administer them to you, and
you answer in the same way; it all helps the lawyers. What is there
for dinner?"</p>

<p>"Fleur said we'd kill the fatted calf when I'd got my speech
off."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence sighed.</p>

<p>"I'm glad. Your mother has Vitamins again rather badly; we eat
little but carrots, generally raw. French blood in a family is an
excellent thing--prevents faddiness about food. Ah! here they come! .
. ."</p>

<p>It has often been remarked that the breakfast-tables of people who
avow themselves indifferent to what the Press may say of them are
garnished by all the newspapers on the morning when there is anything
to say. In Michael's case this was a waste of almost a shilling. The
only allusions to his speech were contained in four out of thirteen
dailies. <i>The Times</i> reported it (including the laughter) with
condensed and considered accuracy. <i>The Morning Post</i> picked out
three imperial bits, prefaced by the words: 'In a promising speech.'
<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> remarked: "Among the other speakers were
Mr. Michael Mont." And <i>The Manchester Guardian</i> observed: "The
Member for Mid-Bucks in a maiden speech advocated the introduction of
children into the Dominions."</p>

<p>Sir Alexander MacGown's speech received the added attention
demanded by his extra years of Parliamentary service, but there was
no allusion to the insinuation. Michael turned to Hansard. His own
speech seemed more coherent than he had hoped. When Fleur came down
he was still reading MacGown's.</p>

<p>"Give me some coffee, old thing."</p>

<p>Fleur gave him the coffee and leaned over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"This MacGown is after Marjorie Ferrar," she said; "I remember
now."</p>

<p>Michael stirred his cup. "Dash it all! The House is free from that
sort of pettiness."</p>

<p>"No. I remember Alison telling me--I didn't connect him up
yesterday. Isn't it a disgusting speech?"</p>

<p>"Might be worse," said Michael, with a grin.</p>

<p>"'As a member of the firm who published this singular production,
he is doubtless interested in pressing it on the public, so that we
may safely discount the enthusiasm displayed.' Doesn't that make your
blood boil?"</p>

<p>Michael shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever feel angry, Michael?"</p>

<p>"My dear, I was through the war. Now for <i>The Times.</i> What
shall I say?</p>

<p>"'SIR,</p>

<p>"'May I trespass upon your valuable space' (that's quite safe),
'in the interests of public life--' (that keeps it impersonal) 'to--'
er--Well?"</p>

<p>"To say that Sir Alexander MacGown in his speech yesterday told a
lie when he suggested that I was interested in the sale of Sir James
Foggart's book."</p>

<p>"Straight," said Michael, "but they wouldn't put it in. How's
this?</p>

<p>"'To draw attention to a misstatement in Sir Alexander MacGown's
speech of yesterday afternoon. As a matter of fact' (always useful)
'I ceased to have any interest whatever in the firm which published
Sir James Foggart's book, "The Parlous State of England," even before
I became a member of the late Parliament; and am therefore in no way
interested, as Sir Alexander MacGown suggested, in pressing it on the
Public. I hesitate to assume that he meant to impugn my honour' (must
get in 'honour') 'but his words might bear that construction. My
interest in the book is simply my interest in what is truly the
"parlous state of England."</p>

<p>'Faithfully, etc.'</p>

<p>That do?"</p>

<p>"Much too mild. Besides, I shouldn't say that you really believe
the state of England is parlous. It's all nonsense, you know. I mean
it's exaggerated."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Michael, "I'll put the state of the Country,
instead. In the House I suppose I rise to a point of order. And in
the Lobby to a point of disorder, probably. I wonder what <i>The
Evening Sun</i> will say?"</p>

<p><i>The Evening Sun,</i> which Michael bought on his way to the
House, gave him a leader, headed: "Foggartism again," beginning as
follows: "Young Hopeful, in the person of the Member for Mid-Bucks,
roused the laughter of the House yesterday by his championship of the
insane policy called Foggartism, to which we have already alluded in
these columns"; and so on for twenty lines of vivid disparagement.
Michael gave it to the door-keeper.</p>

<p>In the House, after noting that MacGown was present, he rose at
the first possible moment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Speaker, I rise to correct a statement in yesterday's debate
reflecting on my personal honour. The honourable Member for Greengow,
in his speech said--" He then read the paragraph from Hansard. "It is
true that I was a member of the firm which published Sir James
Foggart's book in August, 1923, but I retired from all connection
with that firm in October, 1923, before ever I entered this House. I
have therefore no pecuniary or other interest whatever in pressing
the claims of the book, beyond my great desire to see its principles
adopted."</p>

<p>He sat down to some applause; and Sir Alexander MacGown rose.
Michael recognised the face with the unpolitical expression he had
noticed during his speech.</p>

<p>"I believe," he said, "that the honourable Member for Mid-Bucks
was not sufficiently interested in his own speech to be present when
I made my reply to it yesterday. I cannot admit that my words bear
the construction which he has put on them. I said, and I still say,
that one of the publishers of a book must necessarily be interested
in having the judgment which induced him to publish it vindicated by
the Public. The honourable Member has placed on his head a cap which
I did not intend for it." His face came round towards Michael, grim,
red, provocative.</p>

<p>Michael rose again.</p>

<p>"I am glad the honourable Member has removed a construction which
others besides myself had put on his words."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, with a certain unanimity, both left the
House.</p>

<p>The papers not infrequently contain accounts of how Mr. Swash, the
honourable Member for Topcliffe, called Mr. Buckler, the honourable
Member for Footing, something unparliamentary. <i>("Order!")</i> And
of how Mr. Buckler retorted that Mr. Swash was something worse.
<i>("Hear, hear!" and "Order!")</i> And of how Mr. Swash waved his
fists <i>(uproar),</i> and Mr. Buckler threw himself upon the Chair,
or threw some papers. <i>("Order! order! order!")</i> And of how
there was great confusion, and Mr. Swash, or Mr. Buckler, was
suspended, and led vociferous out of the Mother of Parliaments by the
Serjeant-at-Arms, with other edifying details. The little affair
between Michael and Sir Alexander went off in other wise. With an
instinct of common decency, they both made for the lavatory; nor till
they reached those marble halls did either take the slightest notice
of the other. In front of a roller towel Michael said:</p>

<p>"Now, sir, perhaps you'll tell me why you behaved like a dirty
dog. You knew perfectly well the construction that would be placed on
your words."</p>

<p>Sir Alexander turned from a hair-brush.</p>

<p>"Take that!" he said, and gave Michael a swinging box on the ear.
Staggering, Michael came up wildly with his right, and caught Sir
Alexander on the nose. Their movements then became intensive. Michael
was limber, Sir Alexander stocky; neither was over proficient with
his fists. The affair was cut short by the honourable Member for
Washbason, who had been in retirement. Coming hastily out of a door,
he received simultaneously a black eye, and a blow on the diaphragm,
which caused him to collapse. The speaker, now, was the Member for
Washbason, in language stronger than those who knew the honourable
gentleman would have supposed possible.</p>

<p>"I'm frightfully sorry, sir," said Michael. "It's always the
innocent party who comes off worst."</p>

<p>"I'll dam' well have you both suspended," gasped the Member for
Washbason.</p>

<p>Michael grinned, and Sir Alexander said: "To hell!"</p>

<p>"You're a couple of brawling cads!" said the Member for Washbason.
"How the devil am I to speak this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"If you went in bandaged," said Michael, dabbing the damaged eye
with cold water, "and apologised for a motor accident, you would get
special hearing, and a good Press. Shall I take the silver lining out
of my tie for a bandage?"</p>

<p>"Leave my eye alone," bellowed the Member for Washbason, "and get
out, before I lose my temper!"</p>

<p>Michael buttoned the top of his waistcoat, loosened by Sir
Alexander's grip, observed in the glass that his ear was very red,
his cuff bloodstained, and his opponent still bleeding from the nose,
and went out.</p>

<p>'Some scrap!' he thought, entering the fresher air of Westminster.
'Jolly lucky we were tucked away in there! I don't think I'll mention
it!' His ear was singing, and he felt rather sick, physically and
mentally. The salvational splendour of Foggartism already reduced to
a brawl in a lavatory! It made one doubt one's vocation. Not even the
Member for Washbason, however, had come off with dignity, so that the
affair was not likely to get into the papers.</p>

<p>Crossing the road towards home, he sighted Francis Wilmot walking
West.</p>

<p>"Hallo!"</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot looked up, and seemed to hesitate. His face was
thinner, his eyes deeper set; he had lost his smile.</p>

<p>"How is Mrs. Mont?"</p>

<p>"Very well, thanks. And you?"</p>

<p>"Fine," said Francis Wilmot. "Will you tell her I've had a letter
from her cousin Jon. They're in great shape. He was mighty glad to
hear I'd seen her, and sent his love."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Michael, drily. "Come and have tea with us."</p>

<p>The young man shook his head.</p>

<p>"Have you cut your hand?"</p>

<p>Michael laughed. "No, somebody's nose."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot smiled wanly. "I'm wanting to do that all the time.
Whose was it?"</p>

<p>"A man called MacGown's."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot seized Michael's hand. "It's the very nose!" Then,
apparently disconcerted by his frankness, he turned on his heel and
made off, leaving Michael putting one and one together.</p>

<p>Next morning's papers contained no allusion to the blood-letting
of the day before, except a paragraph to the effect that the Member
for Washbason was confined to his house by a bad cold. The Tory
journals preserved a discreet silence about Foggartism; but in two
organs--one Liberal and one Labour--were little leaders, which
Michael read with some attention.</p>

<p>The Liberal screed ran thus: "The debate on the King's speech
produced one effort which at least merits passing notice. The policy
alluded to by the Member for Mid-Bucks under the label of Foggartism,
because it emanates from that veteran Sir James Foggart, has a
certain speciousness in these unsettled times, when every one is
looking for quack specifics. Nothing which departs so fundamentally
from all that Liberalism stands for will command for a moment the
support of any truly Liberal vote. The risk lies in its appeal to
backwoodism in the Tory ranks. Loose thought and talk of a
pessimistic nature always attracts a certain type of mind. The state
of England is not really parlous. It in no way justifies any unsound
or hysterical departure from our traditional policy. But there is no
disguising the fact that certain so-called thinkers have been playing
for some time past with the idea of reviving a 'splendid isolation,'
based (whether they admit it or not) on the destruction of Free
Trade. The young Member for Mid-Bucks in his speech handled for a
moment that corner-stone of Liberalism, and then let it drop; perhaps
he thought it too weighty for him. But reduced to its elements,
Foggartism is a plea for the abandonment of Free Trade, and a blow in
the face of the League of Nations."</p>

<p>Michael sighed and turned to the Labour article, which was signed,
and struck a more human note:</p>

<p>"And so we are to have our children carted off to the Antipodes as
soon as they can read and write, in order that the capitalist class
may be relieved of the menace lurking in Unemployment. I know nothing
of Sir James Foggart, but if he was correctly quoted in Parliament
yesterday by a member for an agricultural constituency, I smell
Prussianism about that old gentleman. I wonder what the working man
is saying over his breakfast-table? I fear the words: 'To hell!' are
not altogether absent from his discourse. No, Sir James Foggart,
English Labour intends to call its own hand; and with all the old
country's drawbacks, still prefers it for itself and its children. We
are not taking any, Sir James Foggart."</p>

<p>'There it is, naked,' thought Michael. 'The policy ought never to
have been entrusted to me. Blythe ought to have found a Labour
townsman.'</p>

<p>Foggartism, whittled to a ghost by jealousy and class-hatred, by
shibboleth, section and Party--he had a vision of it slinking through
the purlieus of the House and the corridors of the Press, never
admitted to the Presence, nor accepted as flesh and blood!</p>

<p>"Never mind," he muttered; "I'll stick it. If one's a fool, one
may as well be a blazing fool. Eh, Dan?"</p>

<p>The Dandie, raising his head from his paws, gave him a lustrous
glance.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="C203">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>MARJORIE FERRAR AT HOME</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Francis Wilmot went on his way to Chelsea. He had a rendezvous
with Life. Over head and ears in love, and old-fashioned to the point
of marriage, he spent his days at the tail of a petticoat as often
absent as not. His simple fervour had wrung from Marjorie Ferrar
confession of her engagement. She had put it bluntly: She was in
debt, she wanted shekels and she could not live in the backwoods. He
had promptly offered her all his shekels. She had refused them with
the words:</p>

<p>"My poor dear, I'm not so far gone as that." Often on the point of
saying 'Wait until I'm married,' the look on his face had always
deterred her. He was primitive; would never understand her ideal:
Perfection, as wife, mistress, and mother, all at once. She kept him
only by dangling the hope that she would throw MacGown over; taking
care to have him present when MacGown was absent, and absent when
MacGown was present. She had failed to keep them apart on two
occasions, painful and productive of more lying than she was at all
accustomed to. For she was really taken with this young man; he was a
new flavour. She 'loved' his dark 'slinky' eyes, his grace, the way
his 'back-chat' grew, dark and fine, on his slim comely neck. She
'loved' his voice and his old-fashioned way of talking. And, rather
oddly, she 'loved' his loyalty. Twice she had urged him to find out
whether Fleur wasn't going to 'climb down' and 'pay up.' Twice he had
refused, saying: "They were mighty nice to me; and I'd never tell you
what they said, even if I did go and find out."</p>

<p>She was painting his portrait, so that a prepared canvas with a
little paint on it chaperoned their almost daily interviews, which
took place between three and four when the light had already failed.
It was an hour devoted by MacGown to duty in the House. A low and
open collar suited Francis Wilmot's looks. She liked him to sit
lissom on a divan with his eyes following her; she liked to come
close to him, and see the tremor of his fingers touching her skirt or
sleeve, the glow in his eyes, the change in his face when she moved
away. His faith in her was inconvenient. P's and Q's were letters she
despised. And yet, to have to mind them before him gave her a sort of
pleasure, made her feel good. One did not shock children!</p>

<p>That day, since she expected MacGown at five, she had become
uneasy before the young man came in, saying:</p>

<p>"I met Michael Mont; his cuff was bloody. Guess whose blood!"</p>

<p>"Not Alec's?"</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot dropped her hands.</p>

<p>"Don't call that man 'Alec' to me."</p>

<p>"My dear child, you're too sensitive. I thought they'd have a
row--I read their speeches. Hadn't Michael a black eye? No? Tt--tt!
Al--er--'that man' will be awfully upset. Was the blood fresh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Francis Wilmot, grimly.</p>

<p>"Then he won't come. Sit down, and let's do some serious work for
once."</p>

<p>But throwing himself on his knees, he clasped his hands behind her
waist.</p>

<p>"Marjorie, Marjorie!"</p>

<p>Disciple of Joy, in the forefront of modern mockery, she was yet
conscious of pity, for him and for herself. It was hard not to be
able to tell him to run out, get licence and ring, or whatever he set
store by, and have done with it! Not even that she was ready to have
done with it without ring or licence! For one must keep one's head.
She had watched one lover growing tired, kept her head, and dismissed
him before he knew it; grown tired of another, kept her head, and
gone on till he was tired too. She had watched favourites she had
backed go down, kept her head and backed one that didn't; had seen
cards turn against her, and left off playing before her pile was
gone. Time and again she had earned the good mark of Modernity.</p>

<p>So she kissed the top of his head, unclasped his hands, and told
him to be good; and, in murmuring it, felt that she had passed her
prime.</p>

<p>"Amuse me while I paint," she said. "I feel rotten."</p>

<p>And Francis Wilmot, like a dark ghost, amused her.</p>

<p>Some believe that a nose from which blood has been drawn by a blow
swells less in the first hour that it does later. This was why Sir
Alexander MacGown arrived at half-past four to say that he could not
come at five. He had driven straight from the House with a little bag
of ice held to it. Having been led to understand that the young
American was 'now in Paris,' he stood stock still, staring at one
whose tie was off and whose collar was unbuttoned. Francis Wilmot
rose from the divan, no less silent. Marjorie Ferrar put a touch on
the canvas.</p>

<p>"Come and look, Alec; it's only just begun."</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said MacGown.</p>

<p>Crumpling his tie into his pocket, Francis Wilmot bowed and moved
towards the door.</p>

<p>"Won't you stay for tea, Mr. Wilmot?"</p>

<p>"I believe not, thank you."</p>

<p>When he was gone Marjorie Ferrar fixed her eyes on the nose of her
bethrothed. Strong and hard, it was as yet, little differentiated
from the normal.</p>

<p>"Now," said MacGown, "why did you lie about that young blighter?
You said he was in Paris. Are you playing fast and loose with me,
Marjorie?"</p>

<p>"Of course! Why not?"</p>

<p>MacGown advanced to within reach of her.</p>

<p>"Put down that brush."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar raised it; and suddenly it hit the wall
opposite.</p>

<p>"You'll stop that picture, and you'll not see that fellow again;
he's in love with you."</p>

<p>He had taken her wrists.</p>

<p>Her face, quite as angry as his own, reined back.</p>

<p>"Let go! I don't know if you call yourself a gentleman?"</p>

<p>"No, a plain man."</p>

<p>"Strong and silent--out of a dull novel. Sit down, and don't be
unpleasant."</p>

<p>The duel of their eyes, brown and burning, blue and icy, endured
for quite a minute. Then he did let go.</p>

<p>"Pick up that brush and give it to me."</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I will!"</p>

<p>"Then our engagement is off. If you're old-fashioned, I'm not. You
want a young woman who'll give you a whip for a wedding-present."</p>

<p>MacGown put his hands up to his head.</p>

<p>"I want you too badly to be sane."</p>

<p>"Then pick up the brush."</p>

<p>MacGown picked it up.</p>

<p>"What have you done to your nose?"</p>

<p>MacGown put his hand to it.</p>

<p>"Ran it against a door."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar laughed. "Poor door!"</p>

<p>MacGown gazed at her in genuine astonishment.</p>

<p>"You're the hardest woman I ever came across; and why I love you,
I don't know."</p>

<p>"It hasn't improved your looks or your temper, my dear. You were
rash to come here to-day."</p>

<p>MacGown uttered a sort of groan. "I can't keep away, and you know
it."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar turned the canvas face to the wall, and leaned
there beside it.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you think of the prospects of our happiness,
Alec; but I think they're pretty poor. Will you have a whisky and
soda? It's in that cupboard. Tea, then? Nothing? We'd better
understand each other. If I marry you, which is very doubtful, I'm
not going into purdah. I shall see what friends I choose. And until I
marry you, I shall also see them. If you don't like it, you can leave
it."</p>

<p>She watched his clenching hands, and her wrists tingled. To be
perfect wife to him would 'take a bit of doing!' If only she knew of
a real 'good thing' instead, and had a 'shirt to put on it!' If only
Francis Wilmot had money and did not live where the cotton came from,
and darkies crooned in the fields; where rivers ran red, Florida moss
festooned the swamps and the sun shone; where grapefruit grew--or
didn't?--and mocking-birds sang sweeter than the nightingale. South
Carolina, described to her with such enthusiasm by Francis Wilmot! A
world that was not her world stared straight into the eyes of
Marjorie Ferrar. South Carolina! Impossible! It was like being asked
to be ancient!</p>

<p>MacGown came up to her. "I'm sorry," he said. "Forgive me,
Marjorie."</p>

<p>On her shrugging shoulders he put his hands, kissed her lips, and
went away.</p>

<p>And she sat down in her favourite chair, listless, swinging her
foot. The sand had run out of her dolly--life was a bore! It was like
driving tandem, when the leader would keep turning round; or the
croquet party in "Alice in Wonderland," read in the buttercup-fields
at High Marshes not twenty years ago that felt like twenty
centuries.</p>

<p>What did she want? Just a rest from men and bills? or that fluffy
something called 'real love'? Whatever it was, she hadn't got it! And
so! Dress, and go out, and dance; and later dress again, and go out
and dine; and the dresses not paid for.</p>

<p>Well, nothing like an egg-nog for 'the hump'!</p>

<p>Ringing for the ingredients, she made one with plenty of brandy,
capped it with nutmeg, and drank it down.</p>

<h2>FONS ET ORIGO</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Two mornings later Michael received two letters. The first, which
bore an Australian post-mark, ran thus:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"DEAR SIR, "I hope you are well and the lady. I thought perhaps
you'd like to know how we are. Well, Sir, we're not much to speak of
out here after a year and a half. I consider there's too much gilt on
the ginger-bread as regards Australia. The climate's all right when
it isn't too dry or too wet--it suits my wife fine, but Sir when they
talk about making your fortune all I can say is tell it to the
marines. The people here are a funny lot they don't seem to have any
use for us and I don't seem to have any use for them. They call us
Pommies and treat us as if we'd took a liberty in coming to their
blooming country. You'd say they wanted a few more out here, but they
don't seem to think so. I often wish I was back in the old Country.
My wife says we're better off here, but I don't know. Anyway they
tell a lot of lies as regards emigration.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir, I've not forgotten your kindness. My wife says please
to remember her to you and the lady.</p>

<p>"Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>"ANTHONY BICKET."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>With that letter in his hand, Michael, like some psychometric
medium, could see again the writer, his thin face, prominent eyes,
large ears, a shadowy figure of the London streets behind his
coloured balloons. Poor little snipe--square peg in round hole
wherever he might be; and all those other pegs--thousands upon
thousands, that would never fit in. Pommies! Well! He wasn't
recommending emigration for them; he was recommending it for those
who could be shaped before their wood had set. Surely they wouldn't
put that stigma on to children! He opened the other letter.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Roll Manor,</p>

<p>"Nr. Huntingdon.</p>

<p>"MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>"The disappointment I have felt since the appearance of my book
was somewhat mitigated by your kind allusions to it in Parliament,
and your championship of its thesis. I am an old man, and do not come
to London now, but it would give me pleasure to meet you. If you are
ever in this neighbourhood, I should be happy if you would lunch with
me, or stay the night, as suits you best.</p>

<p>"With kind regards,</p>

<p>"Faithfully yours,</p>

<p>"JAS: FOGGART."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>He showed it to Fleur.</p>

<p>"If you go, my dear, you'll be bored to tears."</p>

<p>"I must go," said Michael; "Fons et Origo!"</p>

<p>He wrote that he would come to lunch the following day.</p>

<p>He was met at the station by a horse drawing a vehicle of a shape
he had never before beheld. The green-liveried man to whose side he
climbed introduced it with the words: "Sir James thought, sir, you'd
like to see about you; so 'e sent the T cart."</p>

<p>It was one of those grey late autumn days, very still, when the
few leaves that are left hang listless, waiting to be windswept. The
puddled road smelled of rain; rooks rose from the stubbles as if in
surprise at the sound of horses' hoofs; and the turned earth of
ploughed fields had the sheen that betokened clay. To the flat
landscape poplars gave a certain spirituality; and the russet-tiled
farmhouse roofs a certain homeliness.</p>

<p>"That's the manor, sir," said the driver, pointing with his whip.
Between an orchard and a group of elms, where was obviously a
rookery, Michael saw a long low house of deeply weathered brick
covered by Virginia creeper whose leaves had fallen. At a little
distance were barns, outhouses, and the wall of a kitchen-garden. The
T cart turned into an avenue of limes and came suddenly on the house
unprotected by a gate. Michael pulled an old iron bell. Its lingering
clang produced a lingering man, who, puckering his face, said: "Mr.
Mont? Sir James is expecting you. This way, sir."</p>

<p>Through an old low hall smelling pleasantly of wood-smoke, Michael
reached a door which the puckered man closed in his face.</p>

<p>Sir James Foggart! Some gaitered old countryman with little grey
whiskers, neat, weathered and firm-featured; or one of those
short-necked John Bulls, still extant, square and weighty, with a
flat top to his head, and a flat white topper on it!</p>

<p>The puckered man reopened the door, and said:</p>

<p>"Sir James will see you, sir."</p>

<p>Before the fire in a large room with a large hearth and many books
was a huge old man, grey-bearded and grey-locked, like a
superannuated British lion, in an old velvet coat with whitened
seams.</p>

<p>He appeared to be trying to rise.</p>

<p>"Please don't, sir," said Michael.</p>

<p>"If you'll excuse me, I won't. Pleasant journey?"</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"Sit down. Much touched by your speech. First speech, I
think?"</p>

<p>Michael bowed.</p>

<p>"Not the last, I hope."</p>

<p>The voice was deep and booming; the eyes looked up keenly, as if
out of thickets, so bushy were the eyebrows, and the beard grew so
high on the cheeks. The thick grey hair waved across the forehead and
fell on to the coat collar. A primeval old man in a high state of
cultivation. Michael was deeply impressed.</p>

<p>"I've looked forward to this honour, sir," he said, "ever since we
published your book."</p>

<p>"I'm a recluse--never get out now. Tell you the truth, don't want
to--see too many things I dislike. I write, and smoke my pipe. Ring
the bell, and we'll have lunch. Who's this Sir Alexander
MacGown?--his head wants punching!"</p>

<p>"No longer, sir," said Michael.</p>

<p>Sir James Foggart leaned back and laughed.</p>

<p>His laugh was long, deep, slightly hollow, like a laugh in a
trombone.</p>

<p>"Capital! And how did those fellows take your speech? Used to know
a lot of 'em at one time--fathers of these fellows, grandfathers,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"How do you know so well what England wants, sir," said Michael,
suavely, "now that you never leave home?"</p>

<p>Sir James Foggart pointed with a large thin hand covered with hair
to a table piled with books and magazines.</p>

<p>"Read," he said; "read everything--eyes as good as ever--seen a
good deal in my day." And he was silent, as if seeing it again.</p>

<p>"Are you following your book up?"</p>

<p>"M'm! Something for 'em to read when I'm gone. Eighty-four, you
know."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Michael, "that you haven't had the Press
down."</p>

<p>"Have--had 'em yesterday; three by different trains; very polite
young men; but I could see they couldn't make head or tail of the old
creature--too far gone, eh?"</p>

<p>At this moment the door was opened, and the puckered man came in,
followed by a maid and three cats. They put a tray on Sir James'
knees and another on a small table before Michael. On each tray was a
partridge with chipped potatoes, spinach and bread sauce. The
puckered man filled Sir James' glass with barley-water, Michael's
with claret, and retired. The three cats, all tortoise-shells, began
rubbing themselves against Sir James' trousers, purring loudly.</p>

<p>"Don't mind cats, I hope? No fish to-day, pussies!"</p>

<p>Michael was hungry and finished his bird. Sir James gave most of
his to the cats. They were then served with fruit salad, cheese,
coffee and cigars, and everything removed, except the cats, who lay
replete before the fire, curled up in a triangle.</p>

<p>Michael gazed through the smoke of two cigars at the fount and
origin, eager, but in doubt whether it would stand pumping--it seemed
so very old! Well! anyway, he must have a shot!</p>

<p>"You know Blythe, sir, of <i>The Outpost?</i> He's your great
supporter; I'm only a mouthpiece."</p>

<p>"Know his paper--best of the weeklies; but too clever by
half."</p>

<p>"Now that I've got the chance," said Michael, "would you mind if I
asked you one or two questions?"</p>

<p>Sir James Foggart looked at the lighted end of his cigar. "Fire
ahead."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, can England really stand apart from Europe?"</p>

<p>"Can she stand with Europe? Alliances based on promise of
assistance that won't be forthcoming--worse than useless."</p>

<p>"But suppose Belgium were invaded again, or Holland?"</p>

<p>"The one case, perhaps. Let that be understood. Knowledge in
Europe, young man, of what England will or will not do in given cases
is most important. And they've never had it. <i>Perfide Albion!</i>
Heh! We always wait till the last moment to declare our policy. Great
mistake. Gives the impression that we serve Time--which, with our
democratic system, by the way, we generally do."</p>

<p>"I like that, sir," said Michael, who did not. "About wheat? How
would you stabilise the price so as to encourage our growth of
it?"</p>

<p>"Ha! My pet lamb. We want a wheat loan, Mr. Mont, and Government
control. Every year the Government should buy in advance all the
surplus we need and store it; then fix a price for the home farmers
that gives them a good profit; and sell to the public at the average
between the two prices. You'd soon see plenty of wheat grown here,
and a general revival of agriculture."</p>

<p>"But wouldn't it raise the price of bread, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not it."</p>

<p>"And need an army of officials?"</p>

<p>"No. Use the present machinery properly organised."</p>

<p>"State trading, sir?" said Michael, with diffidence.</p>

<p>Sir James Foggart's voice boomed out. "Exceptional case--basic
case--why not?"</p>

<p>"I quite agree," said Michael, hastily. "I never thought of it,
but why not? . . . Now as to the opposition to child emigration in
this country. Do you think it comes from the affection of parents for
their children?"</p>

<p>"More from dislike of losing the children's wages."</p>

<p>"Still, you know," murmured Michael, "one might well kick against
losing one's children for good at fifteen!"</p>

<p>"One might; human nature's selfish, young man. Hang on to 'em and
see 'em rot before one's eyes, or grow up to worse chances than one's
own--as you say, that's human nature."</p>

<p>Michael, who had not said it, felt somewhat stunned.</p>

<p>"The child emigration scheme will want an awful lot of money and
organisation."</p>

<p>Sir James stirred the cats with his slippered foot.</p>

<p>"Money! There's still a mint of money--misapplied. Another hundred
million loan--four and a half millions a year in the Budget; and a
hundred thousand children at least sent out every year. In five years
we should save the lot in unemployment dole." He waved his cigar, and
its ash spattered on his velvet coat.</p>

<p>'Thought it would,' said Michael to himself, knocking his own off
into a coffee-cup. "But can children sent out wholesale like that be
properly looked after, and given a real chance, sir?"</p>

<p>"Start gradually; where there's a will there's a way."</p>

<p>"And won't they just swell the big towns out there?"</p>

<p>"Teach 'em to want land, and give it 'em."</p>

<p>"I don't know if it's enough," said Michael, boldly; "the lure of
the towns is terrific."</p>

<p>Sir James nodded. "A town's no bad thing till it's overdone, as
they are here. Those that go to the towns will increase the demand
for our supplies."</p>

<p>'Well,' thought Michael, 'I'm getting on. What shall I ask him
next?' And he contemplated the cats, who were stirring uneasily. A
peculiar rumbling noise had taken possession of the silence. Michael
looked up. Sir James Foggart was asleep! In repose he was more
tremendous than ever--perhaps rather too tremendous; for his snoring
seemed to shake the room. The cats tucked their heads farther in.
There was a slight smell of burning. Michael picked a fallen cigar
from the carpet. What should he do now? Wait for a revival, or clear
out? Poor old boy! Foggartism had never seemed to Michael a more
forlorn hope than in this sanctum of its fount and origin. Covering
his ears, he sat quite still. One by one the cats got up. Michael
looked at his watch. 'I shall lose my train,' he thought, and tiptoed
to the door, behind a procession of deserting cats. It was as though
Foggartism were snoring the little of its life away! "Goodbye, sir!"
he said softly, and went out. He walked to the station very
thoughtful. Foggartism! That vast if simple programme seemed based on
the supposition that human beings could see two inches before their
noses. But was that supposition justified; if so, would England be so
town-ridden and over-populated? For one man capable of taking a far
and comprehensive view and going to sleep on it, there were nine--if
not nine-and-ninety--who could take near and partial views and remain
wide awake. Practical politics! The answer to all wisdom, however you
might boom it out. "Oh! Ah! Young Mont--not a practical politician!"
It was public death to be so labelled. And Michael, in his
railway-carriage, with his eyes on the English grass, felt like a man
on whom every one was heaping earth. Had pelicans crying in the
wilderness a sense of humour? If not, their time was poor. Grass,
grass, grass! Grass and the towns! And, nestling his chin into his
heavy coat, he was soon faster asleep than Sir James Foggart.</p>

<br>


<h2>PROGRESS OF THE CASE</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When Soames said "Leave it to me," he meant it, of course; but it
was really very trying that whenever anything went wrong, he, and not
somebody else, had to set it right!</p>

<p>To look more closely into the matter he was staying with his
sister Winifred Dartie in Green Street. Finding his nephew Val at
dinner there the first night, he took the opportunity of asking him
whether he knew anything of Lord Charles Ferrar.</p>

<p>"What do you want to know, Uncle Soames?"</p>

<p>"Anything unsatisfactory. I'm told his father doesn't speak to
him."</p>

<p>"Well," said Val, "it's generally thought he'll win the
Lincolnshire with a horse that didn't win the Cambridgeshire."</p>

<p>"I don't see the connection."</p>

<p>Val Dartie looked at him through his lashes. He was not going to
enter for the slander stakes. "Well, he's got to bring off a
<i>coup</i> soon, or go under."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Except that he's one of those chaps who are pleasant to you when
you can be of use, and unpleasant when you can't."</p>

<p>"So I gathered from his looks," said Soames. "Have you had any
business dealings with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I sold him a yearling by Torpedo out of Banshee."</p>

<p>"Did he pay you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Val, with a grin; "and she turned out no good."</p>

<p>"H'm! I suppose he was unpleasant afterwards? That all you
know?"</p>

<p>Val nodded. He knew more, if gossip can be called 'more'; but what
was puffed so freely with the smoke of racing-men's cigars was hardly
suited to the ears of lawyers.</p>

<p>For so old a man of the world Soames was singularly unaware how in
that desirable sphere, called Society, every one is slandered daily,
and no bones broken; slanderers and slandered dining and playing
cards together with the utmost good feeling and the intention of
reslandering each other the moment they are round the corner. Such
genial and hair-raising reports reach no outside ears, and Soames
really did not know where to begin investigation.</p>

<p>"Can you ask this Mr. Curfew to tea?" he said to Fleur.</p>

<p>"What for, Father?"</p>

<p>"So that I can pump him."</p>

<p>"I thought there were detectives for all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>Soames went a special colour. Since his employment of Mr. Polteed,
who had caught him visiting his own wife's bedroom in Paris, at the
beginning of the century, the word detective produced a pain in his
diaphragm. He dropped the subject. And yet, without detectives, what
was he to do?</p>

<p>One night, Winifred having gone to the theatre, he sat down with a
cigar, to think. He had been provided by Michael with a list of
'advanced' books and plays which 'modern' people were reading,
attending and discussing. He had even been supplied with one of the
books: "Canthar," by Perceval Calvin. He fetched it from his bedroom,
and, turning up a lamp, opened the volume. After reading the first
few pages, in which he could see nothing, he turned to the end and
read backwards. In this way he could skip better, and each erotic
passage, to which he very soon came, led him insensibly on to the one
before it. He had reached the middle of the novel, before he had
resort in wonder to the title-pages. How was it that the publisher
and author were at large? Ah! The imprint was of a foreign nature.
Soames breathed more freely. Though sixty-nine, and neither Judge,
juryman, nor otherwise professionally compelled to be shocked, he was
shaken. If women were reading this sort of thing, then there really
was no distinction between men and women nowadays. He took up the
book again, and read steadily on to the beginning. The erotic
passages alone interested him. The rest seemed rambling, disconnected
stuff. He rested again. What was this novel written for? To make
money, of course. But was there another purpose? Was the author one
of these 'artist' fellows who thought that to give you 'life'--wasn't
that the phrase?--they must put down every visit to a bedroom, and
some besides? 'Art for Art's sake,' 'realism'--what did they call it?
In Soames' comparatively bleak experience 'life' did not consist
wholly of visiting bedrooms, so that he was unable to admit that this
book was life, the whole of life, and nothing but life. "Calvin's a
crank, sir," Michael had said, when he handed him the novel. "He
thinks people can't become continent except through being excessively
incontinent; so he shows his hero and heroine arriving gradually at
continence." 'At Bedlam,' thought Soames. They would see what a
British Jury had to say to that, anyway. But how elicit a confession
that this woman and her set had read it with gusto? And then an idea
occurred to him, so brilliant that he had to ponder deeply before he
could feel any confidence in it. These 'advanced' young people had
any amount of conceit; every one who didn't share their views was a
'dud,' or a 'grundy.' Suppose the book were attacked in the Press,
wouldn't it draw their fire? And if their fire could be drawn in
print, could it not be used afterwards as evidence of their views on
morality? H'm! This would want very nice handling. And first of all,
how was he to prove that Marjorie Ferrar had read this book? Thus
casting about him, Soames was rewarded by another brilliant thought:
Young Butterfield--who had helped him to prove the guilt of Elderson
in that matter of the P. P. R. S. and owed his place at Danby &amp;
Winter's, the publishers, to Soames' recommendation! Why not make use
of him? Michael always said the young man was grateful. And obscuring
the title of the book against his flank, in case he should meet a
servant, Soames sought his own bedroom.</p>

<p>His last thought that night was almost diagnostic.</p>

<p>'In my young days we read that sort of book if we could get hold
of it, and didn't say so; now, it seems, they make a splash of
reading it, and pretend it does them good!'</p>

<p>Next morning from 'The Connoisseurs' he telephoned to Danby &amp;
Winter's, and asked to speak to Mr. Butterfield.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Forsyte speaking. Do you remember me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, sir."</p>

<p>"Can you step round to the Connoisseurs' Club this morning some
time?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. Will twelve-thirty suit you?"</p>

<p>Secretive and fastidious in matters connected with sex, Soames
very much disliked having to speak to a young man about an 'immoral'
book. He saw no other way of it, however, and, on his visitor's
arrival, shook hands and began at once.</p>

<p>"This is confidential, Mr. Butterfield."</p>

<p>Butterfield, whose dog-like eyes had glowed over the handshake,
answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I've not forgotten what you did for me, sir."</p>

<p>Soames held out the book.</p>

<p>"Do you know that novel?"</p>

<p>Butterfield smiled slightly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It's printed in Brussels. They're paying five pounds a
copy for it."</p>

<p>"Have you read it?"</p>

<p>The young man shook his head. "It's not come my way, sir."</p>

<p>Soames was relieved. "Well, don't! But just attend a moment. Can
you buy ten copies of it, at my expense, and post them to ten people
whose names I'll give you? They're all more or less connected with
literature. You can put in slips to say the copies are complimentary,
or whatever you call it. But mention no names."</p>

<p>The young man Butterfield said deprecatingly:</p>

<p>"The price is rising all the time, sir. It'll cost you well on
sixty pounds."</p>

<p>"Never mind that."</p>

<p>"You wish the book boomed, sir?"</p>

<p>"Good Gad--no! I have my reasons, but we needn't go into
them."</p>

<p>"I see, sir. And you want the copies to come--as if--as if from
heaven?"</p>

<p>"That's it," said Soames. "I take it that publishers often send
doubtful books to people they think will support them. There's just
one other thing. Can you call a week later on one of the people to
whom you've sent the books, and offer to sell another copy as if you
were an agent for it? I want to make quite sure it's already reached
that person, and been read. You won't give your name, of course. Will
you do this for me?"</p>

<p>The eyes of the young man Butterfield again glowed:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I owe you a great deal, sir."</p>

<p>Soames averted his eyes; he disliked all expression of
gratitude.</p>

<p>"Here's the list of names, then, with their addresses. I've
underlined the one you call on. I'll write you a cheque to go on
with; and you can let me know later if there's anything more to
pay."</p>

<p>He sat down, while the young man Butterfield scrutinised the
list.</p>

<p>"I see it's a lady, sir, that I'm to call on."</p>

<p>"Yes; does that make any difference to you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir. Advanced literature is written for ladies
nowadays."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Soames. "I hope you're doing well?"</p>

<p>"Splendidly, sir. I was very sorry that Mr. Mont left us; we've
been doing better ever since."</p>

<p>Soames lifted an eyebrow. The statement confirmed many an old
suspicion. When the young man had gone, he took up "Canthar." Was he
capable of writing an attack on it in the Press, over the signature
'Paterfamilias'? He was not. The job required some one used to that
sort of thing. Besides, a real signature would be needed to draw
fire. It would not do to ask Michael to suggest one; but Old Mont
might know some fogey at the Parthenaeum who carried metal. Sending
for a bit of brown paper, he disguised the cover with it, put the
volume in his overcoat pocket, and set out for 'Snooks'.'</p>

<p>He found Sir Lawrence about to lunch, and they sat down together.
Making sure that the waiter was not looking over his shoulder,
Soames, who had brought the book in with him, pushed it over, and
said:</p>

<p>"Have you read that?"</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence whinnied.</p>

<p>"My dear Forsyte, why this morbid curiosity? Everybody's reading
it. They say the thing's unspeakable."</p>

<p>"Then you haven't?" said Soames, keeping him to the point.</p>

<p>"Not yet, but if you'll lend it me, I will. I'm tired of people
who've enjoyed it asking me if I've read 'that most disgusting book.'
It's not fair, Forsyte. Did <i>you</i> enjoy it?"</p>

<p>"I skimmed it," said Soames, looking round his nose. "I had a
reason. When you've read it, I'll tell you."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence brought it back to him at 'the Connoisseurs' two days
later.</p>

<p>"Here you are, my dear Forsyte," he said. "I never was more glad
to get rid of a book! I've been in a continual stew for fear of being
overseen with it! Perceval Calvin--<i>quel sale Monsieur!"</i></p>

<p>"Exactly!" said Soames. "Now, I want to get that book
attacked."</p>

<p>"You! Is Saul also among the prophets? Why this sudden zest?"</p>

<p>"It's rather roundabout," said Soames, sitting on the book. He
detailed the reason, and ended with:</p>

<p>"Don't say anything to Michael, or Fleur."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence listened with his twisting smile.</p>

<p>"I see," he said, "I see. Very cunning, Forsyte. You want me to
get some one whose name will act like a red rag. It mustn't be a
novelist, or they'll say he's jealous--which he probably is: the
book's selling like hot cakes--I believe that's the expression. Ah! I
think--rather think, Forsyte, that I have the woman."</p>

<p>"Woman!" said Soames. "They won't pay any attention to that."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence cocked his loose eyebrow. "I believe you're
right--the only women they pay attention to nowadays are those who go
one better than themselves. Shall I do it myself, and sign 'Outraged
Parent'?"</p>

<p>"I believe it wants a real name."</p>

<p>"Again right, Forsyte; it does. I'll drop into the Parthenaeum,
and see if any one's alive."</p>

<p>Two days later Soames received a note.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>

<p>"MY DEAR FORSYTE,</p>

<p>"I've got the man--the Editor of <i>The Protagonist;</i> and he'll
do it under his own name. What's more, I've put him on to the right
line. We had a spirited argument. He wanted to treat it <i>de haut en
bas</i> as the work of a dirty child. I said: 'No. This thing is
symptomatic. Treat it seriously; show that it represents a school of
thought, a deliberate literary attitude; and make it a plea for
censorship.' Without the word censorship, Forsyte, they will never
rise. So he's leaving his wife and taking it into the country for the
week-end. I admire your conduct of the defence, my dear Forsyte; it's
very subtle. But if you'll forgive me for saying so, it's more
important to prevent the case coming into Court than to get a verdict
if it does.</p>

<p>"Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>"LAWRENCE MONT."</p>

to Mapledurham, and spent the next two afternoons going round and
round with a man he didn't like, hitting a ball, to quiet his
mind.</p>

<h2>MICHAEL VISITS BETHNAL GREEN</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The feeling of depression with which Michael had come back from
the fount and origin was somewhat mitigated by letters he was
receiving from people of varying classes, nearly all young. They were
so nice and earnest. They made him wonder whether after all practical
politicians were not too light-hearted, like the managers of
music-halls who protected the Public carefully from their more
tasteful selves. They made him feel that there might be a spirit in
the country that was not really represented in the House, or even in
the Press. Among these letters was one which ran:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Sunshine House,</p>

<p>"Bethnal Green.</p>

<p>"DEAR MR. MONT,</p>

<p>"I was so awfully glad to read your speech in <i>The Times.</i> I
instantly got Sir James Foggart's book. I think the whole policy is
simply splendid. You've no idea how heart-breaking it is for us who
try to do things for children, to know that whatever we do is bound
to be snowed under by the life they go to when school age ends. We
have a good opportunity here of seeing the realities of child life in
London. It's wonderful to see the fondness of the mothers for the
little ones, in spite of their own hard lives--though not all, of
course, by any means; but we often notice, and I think it's common
experience, that when the children get beyond ten or twelve, the
fondness for them begins to assume another form. I suppose it's
really the commercial possibilities of the child making themselves
felt. When money comes in at the door, disinterested love seems to
move towards the window. I suppose it's natural, but it's awfully
sad, because the commercial possibilities are generally so miserable;
and the children's after-life is often half ruined for the sake of
the few shillings they earn. I do fervently hope something will come
of your appeal; only--things move so slowly, don't they? I wish you
would come down and see our House here. The children are adorable,
and we try to give them sunshine.</p>

<p>"Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>"NORAH CURFEW."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Bertie Curfew's sister! But surely that case would not really come
to anything! Grateful for encouragement, and seeking light on
Foggartism, he decided to go. Perhaps Norah Curfew would take the
little Boddicks! He suggested to Fleur that she should accompany him,
but she was afraid of picking up something unsuitable to the eleventh
baronet, so he went alone.</p>

<p>The house, facing the wintry space called Bethnal Green, consisted
of three small houses converted into one, with their three small back
yards, trellised round and gravelled, for a playground. Over the door
were the words: SUNSHINE HOUSE, in gold capitals. The walls were
cream-coloured, the woodwork dark, and the curtains of gay chintz.
Michael was received in the entrance-lobby by Norah Curfew herself.
Tall, slim and straight, with dark hair brushed back from a pale
face, she had brown eyes, clear, straight and glowing.</p>

<p>'Gosh!' thought Michael, as she wrung his hand. 'She <i>is</i>
swept and garnished. No basement in her soul!'</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> good of you to come, Mr. Mont. Let me take you over
the house. This is the playroom."</p>

<p>Michael entered a room of spotless character, which had evidently
been formed from several knocked into one. Six small children dressed
in blue linen were seated on the floor, playing games. They embraced
the knees of Norah Curfew when she came within reach. With the
exception of one little girl Michael thought them rather ugly.</p>

<p>"These are our residents. The others only come out of school
hours. We have to limit them to fifty, and that's a pretty good
squeeze. We want funds to take the next two houses."</p>

<p>"How many of you are working here?"</p>

<p>"Six. Two of us do the cooking; one the accounts; and the rest
washing, mending, games, singing, dancing, and general chores. Two of
us live in."</p>

<p>"I don't see your harps and crowns."</p>

<p>Norah Curfew smiled.</p>

<p>"Pawned," she said.</p>

<p>"What do you do about religion?" asked Michael, thinking of the
eleventh baronet's future.</p>

<p>"Well, on the whole we don't. You see, they're none of them more
than twelve; and the religious age, when it begins at all, begins
with sex about fourteen. We just try to teach kindness and
cheerfulness. I had my brother down the other day. He's always
laughed at me; but he's going to do a matin&eacute;e for us, and give
us the proceeds."</p>

<p>"What play?"</p>

<p>"I think it's called 'The Plain Dealer.' He says he's always
wanted to do it for a good object."</p>

<p>Michael stared. "Do you know 'The Plain Dealer'?"</p>

<p>"No; it's by one of the Restoration people, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Wycherley."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes!" Her eyes remaining clearer than the dawn, Michael
thought: 'Poor dear! It's not my business to queer the pitch of her
money-getting; but Master Bertie likes his little joke!'</p>

<p>"I must bring my wife down here," he said; "she'd love your walls
and curtains. And I wanted to ask you--You haven't room, have you,
for two more little girls, if we pay for them? Their father's down
and out, and I'm starting him in the country--no mother."</p>

<p>Norah Curfew wrinkled her straight brows, and on her face came the
look Michael always connected with haloes, an anxious longing to
stretch good-will beyond power and pocket.</p>

<p>"Oh! we must!" she said. "I'll manage somehow. What are their
names?"</p>

<p>"Boddick--Christian, I don't know. I call them by their ages--Four
and Five."</p>

<p>"Give me the address. I'll go and see them myself; if they haven't
got anything catching, they shall come."</p>

<p>"You really are an angel," said Michael, simply.</p>

<p>Norah Curfew coloured, and opened a door. "That's silly," she
said, still more simply. "This is our mess-room."</p>

<p>It was not large, and contained a girl working a typewriter, who
stopped with her hands on the keys and looked round; another girl
beating up eggs in a bowl, who stopped reading a book of poetry; and
a third, who seemed practising a physical exercise, and stopped with
her arms extended.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Mont," said Norah Curfew, "who made that splendid
speech in the House. Miss Betts, Miss La Fontaine, Miss Beeston."</p>

<p>The girls bowed, and the one who continued to beat the eggs, said:
"It was bully."</p>

<p>Michael also bowed. "Beating the air, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Oh! but, Mr. Mont, it must have an effect. It said what so many
people are really thinking."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Michael, "but their thoughts are so deep, you
know."</p>

<p>"Do sit down."</p>

<p>Michael sat on the end of a peacock-blue divan.</p>

<p>"I was born in South Africa," said the egg-beater, "and I know
what's waiting."</p>

<p>"My father was in the House," said the girl, whose arms had come
down to her splendid sides. "He was very much struck. Anyway, we're
jolly grateful."</p>

<p>Michael looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>"I suppose if you don't all believe in things, you wouldn't be
doing this? <i>you</i> don't think the shutters are up in England,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord, no!" said the girl at the typewriter; "you've only to
live among the poor to know that."</p>

<p>"The poor haven't got every virtue, and the rich haven't got every
vice--that's nonsense!" broke in the physical exerciser.</p>

<p>Michael murmured soothingly.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of that. I was wondering whether something
doesn't hang over our heads too much?"</p>

<p>"D'you mean poison-gas?"</p>

<p>"Partly; and town blight, and a feeling that Progress has been
found out."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," replied the egg-beater, who was dark and
pretty and had a slight engaging stammer, "I used to think so in the
war. But Europe isn't the world. Europe isn't even very important,
really. The sun hardly shines there, anyway."</p>

<p>Michael nodded. "After all, if the Millennium comes and we do blot
each other out, in Europe, it'll only mean another desert about the
size of the Sahara, and the loss of a lot of people obviously too
ill-conditioned to be fit to live. It'd be a jolly good lesson to the
rest of the world, wouldn't it? Luckily the other continents are far
off each other."</p>

<p>"Cheerful!" exclaimed Norah Curfew.</p>

<p>Michael grinned.</p>

<p>"Well, one can't help catching the atmosphere of this place. I
admire you all frightfully, you know, giving up everything, to come
and do this."</p>

<p>"That's tosh," said the girl at the typewriter. "What is there to
give up--bunny-hugging? One got used to doing things, in the
war."</p>

<p>"If it comes to that," said the egg-beater, "we admire you much
more, for not giving up--Parliament."</p>

<p>Again Michael grinned.</p>

<p>"Miss La Fontaine--wanted in the kitchen!"</p>

<p>The egg-beater went towards the door.</p>

<p>"Can you--beat eggs? D'you mind--shan't be a minute." Handing
Michael the bowl and fork, she vanished.</p>

<p>"What a shame!" said Norah Curfew. "Let me!"</p>

<p>"No," said Michael; "I can beat eggs with anybody. What do you all
feel about cutting children adrift at fourteen?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, it'll be bitterly opposed," said the girl at the
typewriter. "They'll call it inhuman, and all that. It's much more
inhuman really to keep them here."</p>

<p>"The real trouble," said Norah Curfew, "apart from the shillings
earned, is the class-interference idea. Besides, Imperialism isn't
popular."</p>

<p>"I should jolly well think it isn't," muttered the physical
exerciser.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the typist, "but this isn't Imperialism, is it, Mr.
Mont? It's all on the lines of making the Dominions the equal of the
Mother Country."</p>

<p>Michael nodded. "Commonwealth."</p>

<p>"That won't prevent their camouflaging their objection to losing
the children's wages," said the physical exerciser.</p>

<p>A close discussion ensued between the three young women as to the
exact effect of children's wages on the working-class budget. Michael
beat his eggs and listened. It was, he knew, a point of the utmost
importance. The general conclusion seemed to be that children earned
on the whole rather more than their keep, but that it was 'very
short-sighted in the long run,' because it fostered surplus
population and unemployment, and a "great shame" to spoil the
children's chances for the sake of the parents.</p>

<p>The re-entrance of the egg-beater put a stop to it.</p>

<p>"They're beginning to come in, Norah."</p>

<p>The physical exerciser slipped out, and Norah Curfew said:</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Mont, would you like to see them?"</p>

<p>Michael followed her. He was thinking: 'I wish Fleur had come!'
These girls seemed really to believe in things.</p>

<p>Down-stairs the children were trickling in from school. He stood
and watched them. They seemed a queer blend of anaemia and vitality,
of effervescence and obedience. Unselfconscious as puppies, but old
beyond their years; and yet, looking as if they never thought ahead.
Each movement, each action was as if it were their last. They were
very quick. Most of them carried something to eat in a paper bag, or
a bit of grease-paper. They chattered, and didn't laugh. Their accent
struck Michael as deplorable. Six or seven at most were nice to look
at; but nearly all looked good-tempered, and none seemed to be
selfish. Their movements were jerky. They mobbed Norah Curfew and the
physical exerciser; obeyed without question, ate without appetite,
and grabbed at the house-cat. Michael was fascinated.</p>

<p>With them came four or five mothers, who had questions to ask, or
bottles to fill. They too were on perfect terms with the young women.
Class did not exist in this house; only personality was present. He
noticed that the children responded to his grin, that the women
didn't, though they smiled at Norah Curfew and the physical
exerciser; he wondered if they would give him a bit of their minds if
they knew of his speech.</p>

<p>Norah Curfew accompanied him to the door.</p>

<p>"Aren't they ducks?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid if I saw much of them, I should give up
Foggartism."</p>

<p>"Oh! but why?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see it designs to make them men and women of
property."</p>

<p>"You mean that would spoil them?"</p>

<p>Michael grinned. "There's something dangerous about silver spoons.
Here's my initiation fee." He handed her all his money.</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr. Mont, we didn't--!"</p>

<p>"Well, give me back sixpence, otherwise I shall have to walk
home."</p>

<p>"It's frightfully kind of you. Do come again; and please don't
give up Foggartism."</p>

<p>He walked to the train thinking of her eyes; and, on reaching
home, said to Fleur:</p>

<p>"You absolutely must come and see that place. It's quite clean,
and the spirit's topping. It's bucked me up like anything. Norah
Curfew's perfectly splendid."</p>

<p>Fleur looked at him between her lashes.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said. "I will."</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="C207">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>CONTRASTS</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The land beyond the coppice at Lippinghall was a ten-acre bit of
poor grass, chalk and gravel, fenced round, to show that it was
property. Except for one experiment with goats, abandoned because
nobody would drink their milk in a country that did not demean itself
by growing food, nothing had been done with it. By December this poor
relation of Sir Lawrence Mont's estate was being actively exploited.
Close to the coppice the hut had been erected, and at least an acre
converted into a sea of mud. The coppice itself presented an incised
and draggled appearance, owing to the ravages of Henry Boddick and
another man, who had cut and stacked a quantity of timber, which a
contractor was gradually rejecting for the fowl-house and granary.
The incubator-house was at present in the nature of a prophecy.
Progress, in fact, was somewhat slow, but it was hoped that fowls
might be asked to begin their operations soon after the New Year. In
the meantime Michael had decided that the colony had better get the
worst over and go into residence. Scraping the Manor House for
furniture, and sending in a store of groceries, oil-lamps, and soap,
he installed Boddick on the left, earmarked the centre for the
Bergfelds, and the right hand for Swain. He was present when the
Manor car brought them from the station. The murky day was turning
cold, the trees dripped, the car-wheels splashed up the surface
water. From the doorway of the hut Michael watched them get out, and
thought he had never seen three more untimely creatures. Bergfeld
came first; having only one suit, he had put it on, and looked what
he was--an actor out of a job. Mrs. Bergfeld came second, and having
no outdoor coat, looked what she was--nearly frozen. Swain came last.
On his shadowy face was nothing quite so spirited as a sneer; but he
gazed about him, and seemed to say: 'My hat!'</p>

<p>Boddick, with a sort of prescience, was absent in the coppice.
'He,' thought Michael, 'is my only joy!'</p>

<p>Taking them into the kitchen messroom of the hut, he deployed a
thermos of hot coffee, a cake, and a bottle of rum.</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry things look so dishevelled; but I think the hut's
dry, and there are plenty of blankets. These oil-lamps smell rather.
You were in the war, Mr. Swain; you'll feel at home in no time. Mrs.
Bergfeld, you look so cold, do put some rum into your coffee; we
always do when we go over the top."</p>

<p>They all put rum into their coffee, which had a marked effect.
Mrs. Bergfeld's cheeks grew pink, and her eyes darkened. Swain
remarked that the hut was a 'bit of all right'; Bergfeld began making
a speech. Michael checked him. "Boddick knows all the ropes. I'm
afraid I've got to catch a train; I've only just time to show you
round."</p>

<p>While whirling back to town afterwards he felt that he had,
indeed, abandoned his platoon just as it was going over the top. That
night he would be dining in Society; there would be light and warmth,
jewels and pictures, wine and talk; the dinner would cost the board
of his 'down and outs' for a quarter at least; and nobody would give
them and their like a thought. If he ventured to draw Fleur's
attention to the contrast, she would say:</p>

<p>"My dear boy, that's like a book by Gurdon Minho; you're getting
sentimental." And he would feel a fool. Or would he? Would he not,
perhaps, look at her small distinguished head, and think: 'Too easy a
way out, my dear; those who take it have little heads!' And, then,
his eyes, straying farther down to that white throat and all the
dainty loveliness below, would convey a warmth to his blood and a
warning to his brain not to give way to blasphemy, lest it end by
disturbing bliss. For what with Foggartism, poultry, and the rest of
it, Michael had serious thoughts sometimes that Fleur had none; and
with wisdom born of love, he knew that if she hadn't, she never would
have, and he must get used to it. She was what she was, and could be
converted only in popular fiction. Excellent business for the
self-centred heroine to turn from interest in her own belongings to
interest in people who had none; but in life it wasn't done. Fleur at
least camouflaged her self-concentration gracefully; and with Kit--!
Ah! but Kit was herself!</p>

<p>So he did not mention his 'down and outs' on their way to dinner
in Eaton Square. He took instead a lesson in the royal Personage
named on their invitation card, and marvelled at Fleur's knowledge.
"She's interested in social matters. And do remember, Michael, not to
sit down till she asks you to, and not to get up before her, and to
say 'ma'am.'"</p>

<p>Michael grinned. "I suppose they'all all be nobs, or sn--er--why
the deuce did they ask us?"</p>

<p>But Fleur was silent, thinking of her curtsey.</p>

<p>Royalty was affable, the dinner short but superb, served and eaten
off gold plate, at a rate which suited the impression that there
really wasn't a moment to spare. Fleur took a mental note of this new
necessity. She knew personally five of the twenty-four diners, and
the rest as in an illustrated paper, darkly. She had seen them all
there at one time or another, stepping hideously in paddocks,
photographed with their offsprings or their dogs, about to reply for
the Colonies, or 'taking a lunar' at a flying grouse. Her quick
instinct apprehended almost at once the reason why she and Michael
had been invited. His speech! Like some new specimen at the Zoo, he
was an object of curiosity, a stunt. She saw people nodding in the
direction of him, seated opposite her between two ladies covered with
flesh and pearls. Excited and very pretty, she flirted with the
Admiral on her right, and defended Michael with spirit from the
Under-Secretary on her left. The Admiral grew warm, the
Under-Secretary, too young for emotion, cold.</p>

<p>"A little knowledge, Mrs. Mont," he said at the end of his short
second innings, "is a dangerous thing."</p>

<p>"Now where have I heard that?" said Fleur. "Is it in the
Bible?"</p>

<p>The Under-Secretary tilted his chin.</p>

<p>"We who have to work Departments know too much, perhaps; but your
husband certainly doesn't know enough. Foggartism is an amusing idea,
but there it stops."</p>

<p>"We shall see!" said Fleur. "What do you say, Admiral?"</p>

<p>"Foggartism! What's that--new kind of death ray? I saw a fellow
yesterday, Mrs. Mont--give you my word!--who's got a ray that goes
through three bullocks, a nine-inch brick wall, and gives a shock to
a donkey on the other side; and only at quarter strength."</p>

<p>Fleur flashed a look round towards the Under-Secretary, who had
turned his shoulder, and, leaning towards the Admiral, murmured:</p>

<p>"I wish you'd give a shock to the donkey on my other side; he
wants it, and I'm not nine inches thick."</p>

<p>But before the Admiral could shoot his death ray, Royalty had
risen.</p>

<p>In the apartment to which Fleur was withdrawn, she had been saying
little for some minutes, and noticing much, when her hostess came up
and said:</p>

<p>"My dear, Her Royal Highness--"</p>

<p>Fleur followed, retaining every wit.</p>

<p>A frank and simple hand patted the sofa beside her. Fleur sat
down. A frank and simple voice said:</p>

<p>"What an interesting speech your husband made! It was so
refreshing, I thought."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Fleur; "but there it will stop, I am told."</p>

<p>A faint smile curled lips guiltless of colouring matter.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps. Has he been long in Parliament?"</p>

<p>"Only a year."</p>

<p>"Ah! I liked his taking up the cudgels for the children."</p>

<p>"Some people think he's proposing a new kind of child
slavery."</p>

<p>"Oh, really! Have you any children?"</p>

<p>"One," said Fleur, and added honestly: "And I must say I wouldn't
part with him at fourteen."</p>

<p>"Ah! and have you been long married?"</p>

<p>"Four years."</p>

<p>At this moment the royal lady saw some one else she wished to
speak to, and was compelled to break off the conversation, which she
did very graciously, leaving Fleur with the feeling that she had been
disappointed with the rate of production.</p>

<p>In the cab trailing its way home through the foggy night, she felt
warm and excited, and as if Michael wasn't.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Michael?"</p>

<p>His hand came down on her knee at once.</p>

<p>"Sorry, old thing! Only, really--when you think of it--eh?"</p>

<p>"Of what? You were quite a li--object of interest."</p>

<p>"The whole thing's a game. Anything for novelty!"</p>

<p>"The Princess was very nice about you."</p>

<p>"Ah! Poor thing! But I suppose you get used to anything!"</p>

<p>Fleur laughed. Michael went on:</p>

<p>"Any new idea gets seized and talked out of existence. It never
gets farther than the brain, and the brain gets bored; and there it
is, already a back number!"</p>

<p>"That can't be true, Michael. What about Free Trade, or Woman
Suffrage?"</p>

<p>Michael squeezed her knee. "All the women say to me: 'But how
interesting, Mr. Mont; I think it's most thrilling!' And the men say:
'Good stunt, Mont! But not practical politics, of course.' And I've
only one answer: 'Things as big got done in the war.' By George, it's
foggy!"</p>

<p>They were going, indeed, at a snail's pace, and through the
windows could see nothing but the faint glow of the street-lamps
emerging slowly, high up, one by one. Michael let down a window, and
leaned out.</p>

<p>"Where are we?"</p>

<p>"Gawd knows, sir."</p>

<p>Michael coughed, put up the window again, and resumed his clutch
of Fleur.</p>

<p>"By the way, Wastwater asked me if I'd read 'Canthar.' He says
there's a snorting cut-up of it in <i>The Protagonist.</i> It'll have
the usual effect--send sales up."</p>

<p>"They say it's very clever."</p>

<p>"Horribly out of drawing--not fit for children, and tells adults
nothing they don't know. I don't see how it can be justified."</p>

<p>"Genius, my dear. If it's attacked, it'll be defended."</p>

<p>"Sib Swan won't have it--he says it's muck."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; but Sib's getting a back number."</p>

<p>"That's very true," said Michael, thoughtfully. "By Jove! how fast
things move, except in politics, and fog."</p>

<p>Their cab had come to a standstill. Michael let down the window
again.</p>

<p>"I'm fair lost, sir," said the driver's hoarse voice. "Ought to be
near the Embankment, but for the life of me I can't find the
turning." Michael buttoned his coat, put up the window again, and got
out on the near side.</p>

<p>The night was smothered, alive only with the continual hootings of
creeping cars. The black vapour, acrid and cold, surged into
Michael's lungs.</p>

<p>"I'll walk beside you; we're against the curb; creep on till we
strike the river, or a bobby."</p>

<p>The cab crept on, and Michael walked beside it, feeling with his
foot for the curb.</p>

<p>The refined voice of an invisible man said: "This is
sanguinary!"</p>

<p>"It is," said Michael. "Where are we?"</p>

<p>"In the twentieth century, and the heart of civilisation."</p>

<p>Michael laughed, and regretted it; the fog tasted of filth.</p>

<p>"Think of the police!" said the voice, "having to be out in this
all night!"</p>

<p>"Splendid force, the police!" replied Michael. "Where are you,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Here, sir. Where are you?"</p>

<p>It was the exact position. The blurred moon of a lamp glowed
suddenly above Michael's head. The cab ceased to move.</p>

<p>"If I could only smell the 'Ouses of Parliament," said the cabman.
"They'll be 'avin' supper there be now."</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Michael--Big Ben was striking. "That was to our
left."</p>

<p>"At our back," said the cabman.</p>

<p>"Can't be, or we should be in the river; unless you've turned
right round!"</p>

<p>"Gawd knows where I've turned," said the cabman, sneezing. "Never
saw such a night!"</p>

<p>"There's only one thing for it--drive on until we hit something.
Gently does it."</p>

<p>The cabman started the cab, and Michael, with his hand on it,
continued to feel for the curb with his foot.</p>

<p>"Steady!" he said, suddenly. "Car in front." There was a slight
bump.</p>

<p>"Nah then!" said a voice. "Where yer comin'? Cawn't yer see?"</p>

<p>Michael moved up alongside of what seemed to be another taxi.</p>

<p>"Comin' along at that pice!" said its driver; "and full moon,
too!"</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry," said Michael. "No harm done. You got any sense of
direction left?"</p>

<p>"The pubs are all closed--worse luck! There's a bloomin' car in
front o' me that I've hit three times. Can't make any impression on
it. The driver's dead, I think. Would yer go and look, Guv'nor?"</p>

<p>Michael moved towards the loom in front. But at that moment it
gave way to the more universal blackness. He ran four steps to hail
the driver, stumbled off the curb, fell, picked himself up and spun
round. He moved along the curb to his right, felt he was going wrong,
stopped, and called: "Hallo!" A faint "Hallo!" replied from--where?
He moved what he thought was back, and called again. No answer! Fleur
would be frightened! He shouted. Half a dozen faint hallos replied to
him; and someone at his elbow said: "Don't cher know where
y'are?"</p>

<p>"No; do you?"</p>

<p>"What do you think? Lost anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes; my cab."</p>

<p>"Left anything in it?"</p>

<p>"My wife."</p>

<p>"Lawd! You won't get 'er back to-night." A hoarse laugh, ghostly
and obscene, floated by. A bit of darkness loomed for a moment, and
faded out. Michael stood still. 'Keep your head!' he thought. 'Here's
the curb--either they're in front, or they're behind; or else I've
turned a corner.' He stepped forward along the curb. Nothing! He
stepped back. Nothing! "What the blazes have I done?" he muttered:
"or have they moved on?" Sweat poured down him in spite of the cold.
Fleur would be really scared! And the words of his election address
sprang from his lips. "Chiefly by the elimination of smoke!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said a voice, "got a cigarette, Guv'nor?"</p>

<p>"I'll give you all I've got and half a crown, if you'll find a cab
close by with a lady in it. What street's this?"</p>

<p>"Don't arst me! The streets 'ave gone mad, I think."</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Michael sharply.</p>

<p>"That's right, 'Some one callin' so sweet.'"</p>

<p>"Hallo!" cried Michael. "Fleur!"</p>

<p>"Here! Here!"</p>

<p>It sounded to his right, to his left, behind him, in front. Then
came the steady blowing of a cab's horn.</p>

<p>"Now we've got 'em," said the bit of darkness. "This way, Guv'nor,
step slow, and mind my corns!"</p>

<p>Michael yielded to a tugging at his coat.</p>

<p>"It's like No-Man's Land in a smoke barrage!" said his guide.</p>

<p>"You're right. Hallo! Coming!"</p>

<p>The horn sounded a yard off. A voice said: "Oh! Michael!"</p>

<p>His face touched Fleur's in the window of the cab.</p>

<p>"Just a second, darling. There you are, my friend, and thanks
awfully! Hope you'll get home!"</p>

<p>"I've 'ad worse nights out than this. Thank you, Captain! Wish you
and the lady luck." There was a sound of feet shuffling on, and the
fog sighed out: "So long!"</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said the hoarse voice of Michael's cabman. "I
know where I am now. First on the left, second on the right. I'll
bump the curb till I get there. Thought you was swallered up,
sir!"</p>

<p>Michael got into the cab, and clasped Fleur close. She uttered a
long sigh, and sat quite still.</p>

<p>"Nothing more scaring than a fog!" he said.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd been run over!"</p>

<p>Michael was profoundly touched.</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry, darling. And you've got all that beastly fog down
your throat. We'll drown it out when we get in. The poor chap was an
ex-Service man. Wonderful the way the English keep their humour and
don't lose their heads."</p>

<p>"I lost mine!"</p>

<p>"Well, you've got it back," said Michael, pressing it against his
own to hide the emotion he was feeling. "Fog's our sheet-anchor,
after all. So long as we have fog, England will survive." He felt
Fleur's lips against his.</p>

<p>He belonged to her, and she couldn't afford to have him straying
about in fogs or Foggartism! Was that the--? And then he yielded to
the thrill.</p>

<p>The cabman was standing by the opened door. "Now, sir, I'm in your
Square. P'r'aps you know your own 'ouse."</p>

<p>Wrenched from the kiss, Michael stammered "Righto!" The fog was
thinner here; he could consult the shape of trees. "On and to your
right, third house."</p>

<p>There it was--desirable--with its bay-trees in its tubs and its
fanlight shining. He put his latch-key in the door.</p>

<p>"A drink?" he said.</p>

<p>The cabman coughed: "I won't say no, sir."</p>

<p>Michael brought the drink.</p>

<p>"Far to go?"</p>

<p>"Near Putney Bridge. Your 'ealth, sir!"</p>

<p>Michael watched his pinched face drinking.</p>

<p>"Sorry you've got to plough into that again!"</p>

<p>The cabman handed back the glass.</p>

<p>"Thank'ee, sir; I shall be all right now; keep along the river,
and down the Fulham Road. Thought they couldn't lose me in London.
Where I went wrong was trying for a short cut instead of takin' the
straight road round. 'Ope the young lady's none the worse, sir. She
was properly scared while you was out there in the dark. These fogs
ain't fit for 'uman bein's. They ought to do somethin' about 'em in
Parliament."</p>

<p>"They ought!" said Michael, handing him a pound note. "Good night,
and good luck!"</p>

<p>"It's an ill wind!" said the cabman, starting his cab. "Good
night, sir, and thank you kindly."</p>

<p>"Thank <i>you</i>!" said Michael.</p>

<p>The cab ground slowly away, and was lost to sight.</p>

<p>Michael went in to the Spanish room. Fleur, beneath the Goya, was
boiling a silver kettle, and burning pastilles. What a contrast to
the world outside--its black malodorous cold reek, its risk and fear!
In this pretty glowing room, with this pretty glowing woman, why
think of its tangle, lost shapes, and straying cries?</p>

<p>Lighting his cigarette, he took his drink from her by its silver
handle, and put it to his lips.</p>

<p>"I really think we ought to have a car, Michael!"</p>

<p> </p>

<br>


<h2>COLLECTING EVIDENCE</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The editor of <i>The Protagonist</i> had so evidently enjoyed
himself that he caused a number of other people to do the same.</p>

<p>"There's no more popular sight in the East, Forsyte," said Sir
Lawrence, "than a boy being spanked; and the only difference between
East and West is that in the East the boy at once offers himself
again at so much a spank. I don't see Mr. Perceval Calvin doing
that."</p>

<p>"If he defends himself," said Soames, gloomily, "other people
won't."</p>

<p>They waited, reading daily denunciations signed: 'A Mother of
Three'; 'Roger: Northampton'; 'Victorian'; 'Alys St. Maurice'; 'Plus
Fours'; 'Arthur Whiffkin'; 'Sportsman if not Gentleman'; and 'Pro
Patria'; which practically all contained the words: 'I cannot say
that I have read the book through, but I have read enough to--'</p>

<p>It was five days before the defence fired a shot. But first came a
letter above the signature: 'Swishing Block,' which, after commenting
on the fact that a whole school of so-called literature had been
indicted by the Editor of <i>The Protagonist</i> in his able letter
of the 14th inst., noted with satisfaction that the said school had
grace enough to take its swishing without a murmur. Not even an
anonymous squeak had been heard from the whole apostolic body.</p>

<p>"Forsyte," said Sir Lawrence, handing it to Soames, "that's my
very own mite, and if it doesn't draw them--nothing will!"</p>

<p>But it did. The next issue of the interested journal in which the
correspondence was appearing contained a letter from the greater
novelist L. S. D. which restored every one to his place. This book
might or might not be Art, he hadn't read it; but the Editor of
<i>The Protagonist</i> wrote like a pedagogue, and there was an end
of him. As to the claim that literature must always wear a flannel
petticoat, it was 'piffle,' and that was that. From under the skirts
of this letter the defence, to what of exultation Soames ever
permitted himself, moved out in force. Among the defenders were as
many as four of the selected ten associates to whom young Butterfield
had purveyed copies. They wrote over their own names that "Canthar"
was distinctly LITERATURE; they were sorry for people who thought in
these days that LITERATURE had any business with morals. The work
must be approached aesthetically or not at all. ART was ART, and
morality was morality, and never the twain could, would, or should
meet. It was monstrous that a work of this sort should have to appear
with a foreign imprint. When would England recognise genius when she
saw it?</p>

<p>Soames cut the letters out one after the other, and pasted them in
a book. He had got what he wanted, and the rest of the discussion
interested him no more. He had received, too, a communication from
young Butterfield.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Sir,</p>

<p>"I called on the lady last Monday, and was fortunately able to see
her in person. She seemed rather annoyed when I offered her the book.
'That book,' she said: 'I read it weeks ago.' 'It's exciting a great
deal of interest, Madam,' I said. 'I know,' she said. 'Then you won't
take a copy; the price is rising steadily, it'll be very valuable in
time?' 'I've got one,' she said. That's what you told me to find out,
sir; so I didn't pursue the matter. I hope I have done what you
wanted. But if there is anything more, I shall be most happy. I
consider that I owe my present position entirely to you."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Soames didn't know about that, but as to his future position--he
might have to put the young man into the box. The question of a play
remained. He consulted Michael.</p>

<p>"Does that young woman still act in the advanced theatre place you
gave me the name of?"</p>

<p>Michael winced. "I don't know, sir; but I could find out."</p>

<p>Inquiry revealed that she was cast for the part of Olivia in
Bertie Curfew's matin&eacute;e of "The Plain Dealer."</p>

<p>"'The Plain Dealer'?" said Soames. "Is that an advanced play?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, two hundred and fifty years old."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Soames; "they were a coarse lot in those days. How is
it she goes on there if she and the young man have split?"</p>

<p>"Oh! well, they're very cool hands. I do hope you're going to keep
things out of Court, sir?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell. When's this performance?"</p>

<p>"January the seventh."</p>

<p>Soames went to his Club library and took down "Wycherley." He was
disappointed with the early portions of "The Plain Dealer," but it
improved as it went on, and he spent some time making a list of what
George Forsyte would have called the 'nubbly bits.' He understood
that at that theatre they did not bowdlerise. Excellent! There were
passages that should raise hair on any British Jury. Between
"Canthar" and this play, he felt as if he had a complete answer to
any claim by the young woman and her set to having 'morals about
them.' Old professional instincts were rising within him. He had
retained Sir James Foskisson, K. C., not because he admired him
personally, but because if he didn't, the other side might. As junior
he was employing very young Nicholas Forsyte; he had no great opinion
of him, but it was as well to keep the matter in the family,
especially if it wasn't to come into Court.</p>

<p>A conversation with Fleur that evening contributed to his
intention that it should not.</p>

<p>"What's happened to that young American?" he said.</p>

<p>Fleur smiled acidly. "Francis Wilmot? Oh! he's 'fallen for'
Marjorie Ferrar."</p>

<p>"'Fallen for her'?" said Soames. "What an expression!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; it's American."</p>

<p>"'For' her? It means nothing, so far as I can see."</p>

<p>"Let's hope not, for his sake! She's going to marry Sir Alexander
MacGown, I'm told."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Did Michael tell you that he hit him on the nose?"</p>

<p>"Which--who?" said Soames testily. "Whose nose?"</p>

<p>"MacGown's, dear; and it bled like anything."</p>

<p>"Why on earth did he do that?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you read his speech about Michael?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Soames. "Parliamentary fuss--that's nothing. They're
always behaving like children, there. And so she's going to marry
him. Has he been putting her up to all this?"</p>

<p>"No; <i>she's</i> been putting him."</p>

<p>Soames discounted the information with a sniff; he scented the
hostility of woman for woman. Still, chicken and egg--political
feeling and social feeling, who could say which first prompted which?
In any case, this made a difference. Going to be married--was she? He
debated the matter for some time, and then decided that he would go
and see Settlewhite and Stark. If they had been a firm of poor repute
or the kind always employed in 'causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres,' he
wouldn't have dreamed of it; but, as a fact, they stood high, were
solid family people, with an aristocratic connection and all
that.</p>

<p>He did not write, but took his hat and went over from 'The
Connoisseurs' to their offices in King Street, St. James's. The
journey recalled old days--to how many such negotiatory meetings had
he not gone or caused his adversaries to come! He had never cared to
take things into Court if they could be settled out of it. And always
he had approached negotiation with the impersonality of one
passionless about to meet another of the same kidney--two calculating
machines, making their livings out of human nature. He did not feel
like that to-day; and, aware of this handicap, stopped to stare into
the print and picture shop next door. Ah! There were those first
proofs of the Roussel engravings of the Prince Consort Exhibition of
'51, that Old Mont had spoken of--he had an eye for an engraving, Old
Mont. Ah! and there was a Fred Walker, quite a good one! Mason, and
Walker--they weren't done for yet by any means. And the sensation
that a man feels hearing a blackbird sing on a tree just coming into
blossom, stirred beneath Soames' ribs. Long--long since he had bought
a picture! Let him but get this confounded case out of the way, and
he could enjoy himself again. Riving his glance from the window, he
took a deep breath, and walked into Settlewhite and Stark's.</p>

<p>The chief partner's room was on the first floor, and the chief
partner standing where chief partners stand.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Forsyte? I've not met you since 'Bobbin
against the L. &amp; S. W.' That must have been 1900!"</p>

<p>"1899," said Soames. "You were for the Company."</p>

<p>Mr. Settlewhite pointed to a chair.</p>

<p>Soames sat down and glanced up at the figure before the fire. H'm!
A long-lipped, long-eyelashed, long-chinned face; a man of his own
calibre, education, and probity! He would not beat about the
bush.</p>

<p>"This action," he said, "is a very petty business. What can we do
about it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Settlewhite frowned.</p>

<p>"That depends, Mr. Forsyte, on what you have to propose? My client
has been very grossly libelled."</p>

<p>Soames smiled sourly.</p>

<p>"She began it. And what is she relying on--private letters to
personal friends of my daughter's, written in very natural anger! I'm
surprised that a firm of your standing--"</p>

<p>Mr. Settlewhite smiled.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble to compliment my firm! I'm surprised myself that
you're acting for your daughter. You can hardly see all round the
matter. Have you come to offer an apology?"</p>

<p>"That!" said Soames. "I should have thought it was for your client
to apologise."</p>

<p>"If such is your view, I'm afraid it's no use continuing this
discussion."</p>

<p>Soames regarded him fixedly.</p>

<p>"How do you think you're going to prove damage? She belongs to the
fast set."</p>

<p>Mr. Settlewhite continued to smile.</p>

<p>"I understand she's going to marry Sir Alexander MacGown," said
Soames.</p>

<p>Mr. Settlewhite's lips tightened.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Forsyte, if you have come to offer an apology and a
substantial sum in settlement, we can talk. Otherwise--"</p>

<p>"As a sensible man," said Soames, "you know that these Society
scandals are always dead sea fruit--nothing but costs and vexation,
and a feast for all the gossips about town. I'm prepared to offer you
a thousand pounds to settle the whole thing, but an apology I can't
look at. A mutual expression of regret--perhaps; but an apology's out
of the question."</p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred I might accept--the insults have had wide
currency. But an apology is essential."</p>

<p>Soames sat silent, chewing the injustice of it all. Fifteen
hundred! Monstrous! Still he would pay even that to keep Fleur out of
Court. But humble-pie! She wouldn't eat it, and he couldn't make her,
and he didn't know that he wanted to. He got up.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Settlewhite, if you take this into Court, you will
find yourself up against more than you think. But the whole thing is
so offensive to me, that I'm prepared to meet you over the money,
though I tell you frankly I don't believe a Jury would award a penny
piece. As to an apology, a 'formula' could be found, perhaps"--why
the deuce was the fellow smiling?--"something like this: 'We regret
that we have said hasty things about each other,' to be signed by
both parties."</p>

<p>Mr. Settlewhite caressed his chin.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll put your proposition before my client. I join with you
in wishing to see the matter settled, not because I'm afraid of the
result"--'Oh, no!' thought Soames--"but because these cases, as you
say, are not edifying." He held out his hand.</p>

<p>Soames gave it a cold touch.</p>

<p>"You understand that this is entirely 'without prejudice,'" he
said, and went on. 'She'll take it!' he thought. Fifteen hundred
pounds of his money thrown away on that baggage, just because for
once she had been labelled what she was; and all his trouble to get
evidence wasted! For a moment he resented his devotion to Fleur.
Really it was fatuous to be so fond as that! Then his heart
rebounded. Thank God! He had settled it.</p>

<p>Christmas was at hand. It did not alarm him, therefore, that he
received no answering communication. Fleur and Michael were at
Lippinghall with the ninth and eleventh baronets. He and Annette had
Winifred and the Cardigans down at 'The Shelter.' Not till the 6th of
January did he receive a letter from Messrs. Settlewhite and
Stark.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>"In reference to your call of the 17th ultimo, your proposition
was duly placed before our client, and we are instructed to say that
she will accept the sum of &pound;1,500--fifteen hundred pounds--and
an apology, duly signed by your client, copy of which we enclose.</p>

<p>"We are, dear Sir,</p>

<p>"Faithfully yours,</p>

<p>"SETTLEWHITE AND STARK."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Soames turned to the enclosure. It ran thus:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I, Mrs. Michael Mont, withdraw the words concerning Miss Marjorie
Ferrar contained in my letters to Mrs. Ralph Ppynrryn and Mrs. Edward
Maltese of October 4th last, and hereby tender a full and free
apology for having written them.</p>

<p>"(Signed)"</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Pushing back the breakfast-table, so violently that it groaned,
Soames got up.</p>

<p>"What is it, Soames?" said Annette. "Have you broken your plate
again? You should not bite so hard."</p>

<p>"Read that!"</p>

<p>Annette read.</p>

<p>"You would give that woman fifteen hundred pounds? I think you are
mad, Soames. I would not give her fifteen hundred pence! Pay this
woman, and she tells her friends. That is fifteen hundred apologies
in all their minds. Really, Soames--I am surprised. A man of
business, a clever man! Do you not know the world better than that?
With every pound you pay, Fleur eats her words!"</p>

<p>Soames flushed. It was so French, and yet somehow it was so true.
He walked to the window. The French--they had no sense of compromise,
and every sense of money!</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "that ends it anyway. She won't sign. And I shall
withdraw my offer."</p>

<p>"I should hope so. Fleur has a good head. She will look very
pretty in Court. I think that woman will be sorry she ever lived! Why
don't you have her what you call shadowed? It is no good to be
delicate with women like that."</p>

<p>In a weak moment he had told Annette about the book and the play;
for, unable to speak of them to Fleur and Michael, he had really had
to tell some one; indeed, he had shown her "Canthar," with the words:
"I don't advise you to read it; it's very French."</p>

<p>Annette had returned it to him two days later, saying: "It is not
French at all; it is disgusting. You English are so coarse. It has no
wit. It is only nasty. A serious nasty book--that is the limit. You
are so old-fashioned, Soames. Why do you say this book is
French?"</p>

<p>Soames, who really didn't know why, had muttered:</p>

<p>"Well, they can't get it printed in England." And with the words:
"Bruxelles, Bruxelles, you call Bruxelles--" buzzing about his ears,
had left the room. He had never known any people so touchy as the
French!</p>

<p>Her remark about 'shadowing,' however, was not easily forgotten.
Why be squeamish, when all depended on frightening this woman? And on
arriving in London he visited an office that was not Mr. Polteed's,
and gave instructions for the shadowing of Marjorie Ferrar's past,
present, and future.</p>

<p>His answer to Settlewhite and Stark, too, was brief, determined,
and written on the paper of his own firm.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Jan. 6th, 1925.</p>

<p>"DEAR SIRS,</p>

<p>"I have your letter of yesterday's date, and note that your client
has rejected my proposition, which, as you know, was made entirely
without prejudice, and is now withdrawn in toto.</p>

<p>"Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>"SOAMES FORSYTE."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>If he did not mistake, they would be sorry. And he gazed at the
words 'in toto'; somehow they looked funny. In toto! And now for "The
Plain Dealer"!</p>

<p>The theatre of the 'Ne Plus Ultra' Play-producing Society had a
dingy exterior, a death-mask of Congreve in the hall, a peculiar
smell, and an apron stage. There was no music. They hit something
three times before the curtain went up. There were no footlights. The
scenery was peculiar--Soames could not take his eyes off it till, in
the first Entr'acte, its principle was revealed to him by the
conversation of two people sitting just behind.</p>

<p>"The point of the scenery here is that no one need look at it, you
see. They go farther than anything yet done."</p>

<p>"They've gone farther in Moscow."</p>

<p>"I believe not. Curfew went over there. He came back raving about
the way they speak their lines."</p>

<p>"Does he know Russian?"</p>

<p>"No. You don't need to. It's the timbre. I think he's doing pretty
well here with that. You couldn't give a play like this if you took
the words in."</p>

<p>Soames, who had been trying to take the words in--it was, indeed,
what he had come for--squinted round at the speakers. They were pale
and young and went on with a strange unconcern.</p>

<p>"Curfew's doing great work. He's shaking them up."</p>

<p>"I see they've got Marjorie Ferrar as Olivia."</p>

<p>"Don't know why he keeps on an amateur like that."</p>

<p>"Box office, dear boy; she brings the smart people. She's painful,
I think."</p>

<p>"She did one good thing--the dumb girl in that Russian play. But
she can't speak for nuts; you're following the sense of her words all
the time. She doesn't rhythmatise you a little bit."</p>

<p>"She's got looks."</p>

<p>"M'yes."</p>

<p>At this moment the curtain went up again. Since Marjorie Ferrar
had not yet appeared, Soames was obliged to keep awake; indeed,
whether because she couldn't 'speak for nuts,' or merely from duty,
he was always awake while she was on the stage, and whenever she had
anything outrageous to say he noted it carefully, otherwise he passed
an excellent afternoon, and went away much rested. In his cab he
mentally rehearsed Sir James Foskisson in the part of
cross-examiner:</p>

<p>"I think, madam, you played Olivia in a production of "The Plain
Dealer" by the "Ne Plus Ultra" Play-Producing Society? . . . Would it
be correct to say that the part was that of a modest woman? . . .
Precisely. And did it contain the following lines? (Quotation of
nubbly bits.) . . . Did that convey anything to your mind, madam? . .
. I suppose that you would not say it was an immoral passage? . . .
No? Nor calculated to offend the ears and debase the morals of a
decent-minded audience? . . . No. In fact, you don't take the same
view of morality that I, or, I venture to think, the Jury do? . . .
No. The dark scene--you did not remonstrate with the producer for not
omitting that scene? . . . Quite. Mr. Curfew, I think, was the
producer? Yes. Are you on such terms with that gentleman as would
have made a remonstrance easy? . . . Ah! Now, madam, I put it to you
that throughout 1923 you were seeing this gentleman nearly every day.
. . . Well, say three or four times a week. And yet you say that you
were not on such terms as would have made it possible for you to
represent to him that no modest young woman should be asked to play a
scene like that. . . . Indeed! The Jury will form their own opinion
of your answer. You are not a professional actress, dependent for
your living on doing what you are told to do? . . . No. And yet you
have the face to come here and ask for substantial damages because of
the allegation in a private letter that you haven't a moral about
you? . . . Have you? . . ." And so on, and so on. Oh! no. Damages!
She wouldn't get a farthing.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Keeping Sir Alexander MacGown and Francis Wilmot in the air,
fulfilling her week-end and other engagements, playing much bridge in
the hope of making her daily expenses, getting a day's hunting when
she could, and rehearsing the part of Olivia, Marjorie Ferrar had
almost forgotten the action, when the offer of fifteen hundred pounds
and the formula were put before her by Messrs. Settlewhite and Stark.
She almost jumped at it. The money would wipe out her more pressing
debts; she would be able to breathe, and reconsider her future.</p>

<p>She received their letter on the Friday before Christmas, just as
she was about to go down to her father's, near Newmarket, and wrote
hastily to say she would call at their office on her way home on
Monday. The following evening she consulted her father. Lord Charles
was of opinion that if this attorney fellow would go as far as
fifteen hundred, he must be dead keen on settling, and she had only
to press for the apology to get it. Anyway she should let them stew
in their juice for a bit. On Monday he wanted to show her his
yearlings. She did not, therefore, return to Town till the 23rd, and
found the office closed for Christmas. It had never occurred to her
that solicitors had holidays. On Christmas Eve she herself went away
for ten days; so that it was January the 4th before she was again
able to call. Mr. Settlewhite was still in the South of France, but
Mr. Stark would see her. Mr. Stark knew little about the matter, but
thought Lord Charles' advice probably sound; he proposed to write
accepting the fifteen hundred pounds if a formal apology were
tendered; they could fall back on the formula if necessary, but it
was always wise to get as much as you could. With some misgiving
Marjorie Ferrar agreed.</p>

<p>Returning from the matin&eacute;e on January 7th, tired and elated
by applause, by Bertie Curfew's words: "You did quite well, darling,"
and almost the old look on his face, she got into a hot bath, and was
just out of it when her maid announced Mr. Wilmot.</p>

<p>"Keep him, Fanny; say I'll be with him in twenty minutes."</p>

<p>Feverish and soft, as if approaching a crisis, she dressed
hastily, put essence of orange-blossom on her neck and hands, and
went to the studio. She entered without noise. The young man, back to
the door, in the centre of the room, evidently did not hear her.
Approaching within a few feet, she waited for the effect on him of
orange-blossom. He was standing like some Eastern donkey, that with
drooped ears patiently awaits the fresh burdening of a sore back. And
suddenly he spoke: "I'm all in."</p>

<p>"Francis!"</p>

<p>The young man turned.</p>

<p>"Oh! Marjorie!" he said, "I never heard." And taking her hands, he
buried his face in them.</p>

<p>She was hampered at that moment. To convert his mouth from
despairing kissing of her hands to triumphal flame upon her lips
would have been so easy if he had been modern, if his old-fashioned
love had not complimented her so subtly; if, too, she were not
feeling for him something more--or was it less?--than passion. Was
she to know at last the sensations of the simple--a young girl's
idyll--something she had missed? She led him to the divan, sat down
by his side, and looked into his eyes. Fabled sweetness, as of a
Spring morning--Francis and she, children in the wood, with the world
well lost! She surrendered to the innocence of it; deliberately
grasped something delicious, new. Poor boy! How delightful to feel
him happy at last--to promise marriage and mean to perform it! When?
Oh! when he liked--Soon, quite soon; the sooner the better! Almost
unconscious that she was 'playing' a young girl, she was carried away
by his amazement and his joy. He was on fire, on air; yet he remained
delicate--he was wonderful! For an hour they sat--a fragrant hour for
memory to sniff--before she remembered that she was dining out at
half-past eight. She put her lips to his, and closed her eyes. And
thought ran riot. Should she spoil it, and make sure of him in modern
fashion? What was his image of her but a phlizz, but a fraud? She saw
his eyes grow troubled, felt his hands grow fevered. Something seemed
drowning before her eyes. She stood up.</p>

<p>"Now, my darling, you must fly!"</p>

<p>When he had flown, she threw off her dress and brushed out her
hair that in the mirror seemed to have more gold than red. . . . Some
letters on her dressing-table caught her eye. The first was a bill,
the second a bill; the third ran thus:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"DEAR MADAM,</p>

<p>"We regret to say that Cuthcott Kingston &amp; Forsyte have
refused to give the apology we asked for, and withdrawn their verbal
offer in toto. We presume, therefore, that the action must go
forward. We have every hope, however, that they may reconsider the
matter before it comes into Court.</p>

<p>"Your obedient servants,</p>

<p>"SETTLEWHITE &amp; STARK."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>She dropped it and sat very still, staring at a little hard line
on the right side of her mouth and a little hard line on the left. .
. .</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot, flying, thought of steamship-lines and staterooms,
of registrars and rings. An hour ago he had despaired; now it seemed
he had always known she was "too fine not to give up this fellow whom
she didn't love." He would make her the queen of South Carolina--he
surely would! But if she didn't like it out there, he would sell the
'old home,' and they would go and live where she wished--in Venice;
he had heard her say Venice was wonderful; or New York, or Sicily;
with her he wouldn't care! And London in the cold dry wind seemed
beautiful, no longer a grey maze of unreality and shadows, but a city
where you could buy rings and steamship passages. The wind cut him
like a knife and he did not feel it. That poor devil MacGown! He
hated the sight, the thought of him, and yet felt sorry, thinking of
him with the cup dashed from his lips. And all the days, weeks,
months himself had spent circling round the flame, his wings scorched
and drooping, seemed now but the natural progress of the soul towards
Paradise. Twenty-four--his age and hers; an eternity of bliss before
them! He pictured her on the porch at home. Horses! A better car than
the old Ford! The darkies would adore her--kind of grand, and so
white! To walk with her among the azaleas in the Spring, that he
could smell already; no--it was his hands where he had touched her!
He shivered, and resumed his flight under the bare trees, well-nigh
alone in the East wind; the stars of a bitter night shining.</p>

<p>A card was handed to him as he entered his hotel.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilmot, a gentleman to see you."</p>

<p>Sir Alexander was seated in a corner of the Lounge, with a crush
hat in his hand. He rose and came towards Francis Wilmot, grim and
square.</p>

<p>"I've been meaning to call on you for some time, Mr. Wilmot."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. May I offer you a cocktail, or a glass of sherry?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. You are aware of my engagement to Miss
Ferrar?"</p>

<p>"I was, sir."</p>

<p>This red aggressive face, with its stiff moustache and burning
eyes, revived his hatred; so that he no longer felt sorry.</p>

<p>"You know that I very much object to your constant visits to that
young lady. In this country it is not the part of a gentleman to
pursue an engaged young woman."</p>

<p>"That," said Francis Wilmot, coolly, "is for Miss Ferrar herself
to say."</p>

<p>MacGown's face grew even redder.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't been an American, I should have warned you to keep
clear a long time ago."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot bowed.</p>

<p>"Well! Are you going to?"</p>

<p>"Permit me to decline an answer."</p>

<p>MacGown thrust forward his face.</p>

<p>"I've told you," he said. "If you trespass any more, look out for
yourself."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I will," said Francis Wilmot, softly.</p>

<p>MacGown stood for a moment swaying slightly. Was he going to hit
out? Francis Wilmot put his hands into his trouser pockets.</p>

<p>"You've had your warning," said MacGown, and turned on his
heel.</p>

<p>"Good night!" said Francis Wilmot to that square receding back. He
had been gentle, he had been polite, but he hated the fellow, yes,
indeed! Save for the triumphal glow within him, there might have been
a fuss!</p>

<br>


<h2>PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Summoned to the annual Christmas covert-shooting at Lippinghall,
Michael found there two practical politicians, and one member of the
Government.</p>

<p>In the mullion-windowed smoking-room, where men retired, and women
too sometimes, into chairs old, soft, leathery, the ball of talk was
lightly tossed, and naught so devastating as Foggartism mentioned.
But in odd minutes and half-hours Michael gained insight into
political realities, and respect for practical politicians. Even on
this holiday they sat up late, got up early, wrote letters, examined
petitions, dipped into Blue Books. They were robust, ate heartily,
took their liquor like men, never seemed fatigued. They shaved clean,
looked healthy, and shot badly with enjoyment. The member of the
Government played golf instead, and Fleur went round with him.
Michael learned the lesson: Have so much on your mind that you have
practically nothing in it; no time to pet your schemes, fancies,
feelings. Carry on, and be careful that you don't know to what
end.</p>

<p>As for Foggartism, they didn't--<i>&agrave; la Evening
Sun</i>--pooh-pooh it; they merely asked, as Michael had often asked
himself: "Yes, but how are you going to work it? Your scheme might be
very good, if it didn't hit people's pockets. Any addition to the
price of living is out of the question--the country's taxed up to the
hilt. Your Foggartism's going to need money in every direction. You
may swear till you're blue in the face that ten or twenty years hence
it'll bring fivefold return; nobody will listen. You may say:
'Without it we're all going to the devil'; but we're accustomed to
that--some people think we're there already, and they resent its
being said. Others, especially manufacturers, believe what they want
to. They can't bear any one who cries 'stinking fish,' whatever his
object. Talk about reviving trade, and less taxation, or offer more
wages and talk of a capital levy, and, according to Party, we shall
believe you've done the trick--until we find you haven't. But you're
talking of less trade and more taxation in the present with a view to
a better future. Great Scott! In politics you can shuffle the cards,
but you mustn't add or subtract. People only react to immediate
benefit, or, as in the war, to imminent danger. You must cut out
sensationalism."</p>

<p>In short, they were intelligent, and completely fatalistic.</p>

<p>After these quiet talks, Michael understood, much better than
before, the profession of politics. He was greatly attracted by the
member of the Government; his personality was modest, his manner
pleasant, he had Departmental ideas, and was doing his best with his
own job according to those ideas; if he had others he kept them to
himself. He seemed to admire Fleur, and he listened better than the
other two. He said, too, some things they hadn't. "Of course, what
we're able to do may be found so inadequate that there'll be a great
journalistic outcry, and under cover of it we may bring in some
sweeping measures that people will swallow before they know what
they're in for."</p>

<p>"The Press," said Michael; "I don't see them helping."</p>

<p>"Well! It's the only voice there is. If you could get fast hold of
the vociferous papers, you might even put your Foggartism over. What
you're really up against is the slow town growth of the last hundred
and fifty years, an ingrained state of mind which can only see
England in terms of industrialism and the carrying trade. And in the
town-mind, of course, hope springs eternal. They don't like calamity
talk. Some genuinely think we can go on indefinitely on the old
lines, and get more and more prosperous into the bargain. Personally,
I don't. It's possible that much of what old Foggart advocates may be
adopted bit by bit, even child emigration, from sheer practical
necessity; but it won't be called Foggartism. Inventor's luck!
<i>He'll</i> get no credit for being the first to see it. And," added
the Minister, gloomily, "by the time it's adopted, it'll probably be
too late."</p>

<p>Receiving the same day a request for an interview from a Press
Syndicate whose representative would come down to suit his
convenience, Michael made the appointment, and prepared an elaborate
exposition of his faith. The representative, however, turned out to
be a camera, and a photograph entitled: 'The Member for Mid-Bucks
expounding Foggartism to our Representative,' became the only record
of it. The camera was active. It took a family group in front of the
porch: 'Right to Left, Mr. Michael Mont, M. P., Lady Mont, Mrs.
Michael Mont, Sir Lawrence Mont, Bt.' It took Fleur: 'Mrs. Michael
Mont, with Kit and Dandie.' It took the Jacobean wing. It took the
Minister, with his pipe, 'enjoying a Christmas rest.' It took a
corner of the walled garden: 'In the grounds.' It then had lunch.
After lunch it took the whole house-party: 'At Sir Lawrence Mont's,
Lippinghall Manor, Bucks'; with the Minister on Lady Mont's right and
the Minister's wife on Sir Lawrence's left. This photograph would
have turned out better, if the Dandie, inadvertently left out, had
not made a sudden onslaught on the camera's legs. It took a
photograph of Fleur alone: 'Mrs. Michael Mont--a charming young
Society hostess.' It understood that Michael was making an
interesting practical experiment--could it take Foggartism in action?
Michael grinned and said: Yes, if it would take a walk, too.</p>

<p>They departed for the coppice. The colony was in its normal
state--Boddick, with two of the contractor's men cheering him on, was
working at the construction of the incubator-house; Swain, smoking a
cigarette, was reading <i>The Daily Mall;</i> Bergfeld was sitting
with his head in his hands, and Mrs. Bergfeld was washing up.</p>

<p>The camera took three photographs. Michael, who had noted that
Bergfeld had begun shaking, suggested to the camera that it would
miss its train. It at once took a final photograph of Michael in
front of the hut, two cups of tea at the Manor, and its
departure.</p>

<p>As Michael was going up-stairs that night, the butler came to
him.</p>

<p>"The man Boddick's in the pantry, Mr. Michael; I'm afraid
something's happened, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Michael, blankly.</p>

<p>Where Michael had spent many happy hours, when he was young, was
Boddick, his pale face running with sweat, and his dark eyes very
alive.</p>

<p>"The German's gone, sir."</p>

<p>"Gone?"</p>

<p>"Hanged hisself. The woman's in an awful state. I cut him down,
and sent Swain to the village."</p>

<p>"Good God! Hanged! But why?"</p>

<p>"He's been very funny these last three days; and that camera upset
him properly. Will you come, sir?"</p>

<p>They set out with a lantern, Boddick telling his tale.</p>

<p>"As soon as ever you was gone this afternoon he started to shake
and carry on about having been made game of. I told 'im not to be a
fool, and went out to get on with it. But when I came in to tea, he
was still shakin', and talkin' about his honour and his savin's;
Swain had got fed-up and was jeerin' at him, and Mrs. Bergfeld was as
white as a ghost in the corner. I told Swain to shut his head; and
Fritz simmered down after a bit, and sat humped up as he does for
hours together. Mrs. Bergfeld got our tea. I had some chores to
finish, so I went out after. When I come in at seven, they was at it
again hammer and tongs, and Mrs. Bergfeld cryin' fit to bust her
heart. 'Can't you see,' I said, 'how you're upsettin' your wife?'
'Henry Boddick,' he said, 'I've nothing against <i>you</i>, you've
always been decent to me. But this Swain,' he said, ''is name is
Swine!' and he took up the bread-knife. I got it away from him, and
spoke him calm. 'Ah!' he said, 'but <i>you've</i> no pride.' Swain
was lookin' at him with that sort o' droop in his mouth he's got.
'Pride,' he says, 'you silly blighter, what call 'ave <i>you</i> to
'ave any pride?' Well, I see that while we was there he wasn't goin'
to get any better, so I took Swain off for a glass at the pub. When
we came back at ten o'clock, Swain went straight to bed, and I went
into the mess-room, where I found his wife alone. 'Has he gone to
bed?' I said. 'No,' she said, 'he's gone out to cool his head. Oh!
Henry Boddick,' she said, 'I don't know what to do with him!' We sat
there a bit, she tellin' me about 'im brooding, and all that--nice
woman she is, too; till suddenly she said: 'Henry Boddick,' she said,
'I'm frightened. Why don't he come?' We went out to look for him, and
where d'you think he was, sir? You know that big tree we're just
goin' to have down? There's a ladder against it, and the guidin' rope
all fixed. He'd climbed up that ladder in the moonlight, put the rope
round his neck, and jumped off; and there he was, six feet from the
ground, dead as a duck. I roused up Swain, and we got him in,
and--Well, we 'ad a proper time! Poor woman, I'm sorry for her,
sir--though really I think it's just as well he's gone--he couldn't
get upsides with it anyhow. That camera chap would have given
something for a shot at what we saw there in the moonlight."</p>

<p>'Foggartism in action!' thought Michael, bitterly. 'So endeth the
First Lesson!'</p>

<p>The hut looked lonely in the threading moonlight and the bitter
wind. Inside, Mrs. Bergfeld was kneeling beside the body placed on
the deal table, with a handkerchief over its face. Michael put a hand
on her shoulder. She gave him a wild look, bowed her head again, and
her lips began moving. 'Prayer!' thought Michael. 'Catholic--of
course!' He took Boddick aside. "Don't let her see Swain. I'll talk
to him."</p>

<p>When the police and the doctor came in, he buttonholed the
hair-dresser, whose shadowy face looked ghastly in the moonlight. He
seemed much upset.</p>

<p>"You'd better come down to the house for the night, Swain."</p>

<p>"All right, sir. I never meant to hurt the poor beggar. But he did
carry on so, and I've got my own trouble. I couldn't stand 'im
monopolisin' misfortune the way he does. When the inquest's over, I'm
off. If I can't get some sun soon, I'll be as dead as 'im."</p>

<p>Michael was relieved. Boddick would be left alone.</p>

<p>When at last he got back to the house with Swain, Fleur was
asleep. He did not wake her to tell her the news, but lay a long time
trying to get warm, and thinking of that great obstacle to all
salvation--the human element. And, mingled with his visions of the
woman beside that still, cold body were longings for the warmth of
the young body close to him.</p>

<p>The photographs were providential. For three days no paper could
be taken up which did not contain some allusion, illustrated, to "The
Tragedy on a Buckinghamshire Estate"; "German actor hangs himself";
"The drama at Lippinghall"; "Tragic end of an experiment"; "Right to
Left: Mr. Michael Mont, Member for Mid-Bucks; Bergfeld, the German
actor who hanged himself; Mrs. Bergfeld."</p>

<p><i>The Evening Sun</i> wrote more in sorrow than in anger:</p>

<p>"The suicide of a German actor on Sir Lawrence Mont's estate at
Lippinghall has in it a touch of the grotesquely moral. The
unfortunate man seems to have been one of three 'out-of-works'
selected by the young Member for Mid-Bucks, recently conspicuous for
his speech on 'Foggartism,' for a practical experiment in that
peculiar movement. Why he should have chosen a German to assist the
English people to return to the Land is not perhaps very clear; but,
largely speaking, the incident illustrates the utter unsuitability of
all amateur attempts to solve this problem, and the futility of
pretending to deal with the unemployment crisis while we still
tolerate among us numbers of aliens who take the bread out of the
mouths of our own people." The same issue contained a short leader
entitled: "The Alien in our Midst." The inquest was well attended. It
was common knowledge that three men and one woman lived in the hut,
and sensational developments were expected. A good deal of
disappointment was felt that the evidence disclosed nothing at all of
a sexual character.</p>

<p>Fleur, with the eleventh baronet, returned to town after it was
over. Michael remained for the funeral--in a Catholic cemetery some
miles away. He walked with Henry Boddick behind Mrs. Bergfeld. A
little sleet was drifting out of a sky the colour of the gravestones,
and against that whitish sky the yew-trees looked very stark. He had
ordered a big wreath laid on the grave, and when he saw it thus
offered up, he thought: 'First human beings, then rams, now flowers!
Progress! I wonder!'</p>

<p>Having arranged that Norah Curfew should take Mrs. Bergfeld as
cook in Bethnal Green, he drove her up to London in the Manor car.
During that long drive he experienced again feelings that he had not
had since the war. Human hearts, dressed-up to the nines in
circumstance, interests, manners, accents, race, and class, when
stripped by grief, by love, by hate, by laughter were one and the
same heart. But how seldom were they stripped! Life was a clothed
affair! A good thing too, perhaps--the strain of nakedness was too
considerable! He was, in fact, infinitely relieved to see the face of
Norah Curfew, and hear her cheerful words to Mrs. Bergfeld:</p>

<p>"Come in, my dear, and have some tea!" She was the sort who
stripped to the heart without strain or shame.</p>

<p>Fleur was in the drawing-room when he got home, furred up to her
cheeks, which were bright as if she had just come in from the
cold.</p>

<p>"Been out, my child?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I--" She stopped, looked at him rather queerly, and said:
"Well, have you finished with that business?"</p>

<p>"Yes; thank God. I've dropped the poor creature on Norah
Curfew."</p>

<p>Fleur smiled. "Ah! Yes, Norah Curfew! <i>She</i> lives for
everybody but herself, doesn't she?"</p>

<p>"She does," said Michael, rather sharply.</p>

<p>"The new woman. One's getting clean out of fashion."</p>

<p>Michael took her cheeks between his hands.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Fleur?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"There is."</p>

<p>"Well, one gets a bit fed up with being left out, as if one were
fit for nothing but Kit, and looking appetising."</p>

<p>Michael dropped his hands, hurt and puzzled. Certainly he had not
consulted her about his 'down and outs'; had felt sure it would only
bore or make her laugh--No future in it! And had there been?</p>

<p>"Any time you like to go shares in any mortal thing, Fleur, you've
only to say so."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't want to poke into your affairs. I've got my own. Have
you had tea?"</p>

<p>"Do tell me what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"My dear boy, you've already asked me that, and I've already told
you--nothing."</p>

<p>"Won't you kiss me?"</p>

<p>"Of course. And there's Kit's bath--would you like to go up?"</p>

<p>Each short stab went in a little farther. This was a spiritual
crisis, and he did not know in the least how to handle it. Didn't she
want him to admire her, to desire her? What did she want? Recognition
that she was as interested as he in--in the state of the Country? Of
course! Only--was she?</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "<i>I</i> want tea, anyway. Is the new woman
dramatic?"</p>

<p>Jealousy? The notion was absurd. He said quietly:</p>

<p>"I don't quite follow you."</p>

<p>Fleur looked up at him with very clear eyes.</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Michael, and left the room.</p>

<p>He went up-stairs and sat down before 'The White Monkey.' In that
strategic position he better perceived the core of his domestic
moment. Fleur had to be first--had to take precedence. No object in
her collection must live a life of its own! He was appalled by the
bitterness of that thought. No, no! It was only that she had a
complex--a silver spoon, and it had become natural in her mouth. She
resented his having interests in which she was not first; or rather,
perhaps, resented the fact that they were not her interests too. And
that was to her credit, when you came to think of it. She was vexed
with herself for being egocentric. Poor child! 'I've got to mind my
eye,' thought Michael, 'or I shall make some modern-novel mess of
this in three parts.' And his mind strayed naturally to the science
of dishing up symptoms as if they were roots--ha! He remembered his
nursery governess locking him in; he had dreaded being penned up ever
since. The psychoanalysts would say that was due to the action of his
governess. It wasn't--many small boys wouldn't have cared a hang; it
was due to a nature that existed before that action. He took up the
photograph of Fleur that stood on his desk. He loved the face, he
would always love it. If she had limitations--well! So had he--lots!
This was comedy, one mustn't make it into tragedy! Surely she had a
sense of humour, too! Had she? Had she not? And Michael searched the
face he held in his hands. . . .</p>

<p>But, as is usual with husbands, he had diagnosed without knowledge
of all the facts.</p>

<p>Fleur had been bored at Lippinghall, even collection of the
Minister had tried her. She had concealed her boredom from Michael.
But self-sacrifice takes its revenge. She reached home in a mood of
definite antagonism to public affairs. Hoping to feel better if she
bought a hat or two, she set out for Bond Street. At the corner of
Burlington Street, a young man bared his head.</p>

<p>"Fleur!"</p>

<p>Wilfrid Desert! Very lean and very brown!</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm just back. How's Michael?"</p>

<p>"Very well. Only he's in Parliament."</p>

<p>"Great Scott! And how are you?"</p>

<p>"As you see. Did you have a good time?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm only perching. The East has got me!"</p>

<p>"Are you coming to see us?"</p>

<p>"I think not. The burnt child, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes; you <i>are</i> brown!"</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, Fleur! You look just the same, only more so. I'll
see Michael somewhere."</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" She walked on without looking back, and then regretted
not having found out whether Wilfrid had done the same.</p>

<p>She had given Wilfrid up for--well, for Michael, who--who had
forgotten it! Really she was too self-sacrificing!</p>

<p>And then at three o'clock a note was brought her:</p>

<p>"By hand, ma'am; answer waiting."<br>
<br>
She opened an envelope, stamped 'Cosmopolis Hotel.'</p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"MADAM,</p>

<p>"We apologise for troubling you, but are in some perplexity. Mr.
Francis Wilmot, a young American gentleman, who has been staying in
this hotel since early October, has, we are sorry to say, contracted
pneumonia. The doctor reports unfavourably on his condition. In these
circumstances we thought it right to examine his effects, in order
that we might communicate with his friends; but the only indication
we can find is a card of yours. I venture to ask you if you can help
us in the matter.</p>

<p>"Believe me to be, Madam,</p>

<p>"Your faithful servant,</p>

<p>"(for the Management)."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Fleur stared at an illegible signature, and her thoughts were
bitter. Jon had dumped Francis on her as a herald of his happiness;
her enemy had lifted him! Well, then, why didn't that Cat look after
him herself? Oh! well, poor boy! Ill in a great hotel--without a
soul!</p>

<p>"Call me a taxi, Coaker."</p>

<p>On her way to the Hotel she felt slight excitement of the
'ministering angel' order.</p>

<p>Giving her name at the bureau, she was taken up to Room 209. A
chambermaid was there. The doctor, she said, had ordered a nurse, who
had not yet come.</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot, very flushed, was lying back, propped up; his eyes
were closed.</p>

<p>"How long has he been ill like this?"</p>

<p>"I've noticed him looking queer, ma'am; but we didn't know how bad
he was until to-day. I think he's just neglected it. The doctor says
he's got to be packed. Poor gentleman, it's very sad. You see, he's
hardly there!"</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot's lips were moving; he was evidently on the verge
of delirium.</p>

<p>"Go and make some lemon tea in a jug as weak and hot as you can;
quick!"</p>

<p>When the maid had gone, she went up and put her cool hand to his
forehead.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Francis. Much pain?"</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot's lips ceased to move; he looked up at her and his
eyes seemed to burn.</p>

<p>"If you cure me," he said, "I'll hate you. I just want to get out,
quick!"</p>

<p>She changed her hand on his forehead, whose heat seemed to scorch
the skin of her palm. His lips resumed their almost soundless
movement. The meaningless, meaningful whispering frightened her, but
she stood her ground, constantly changing her hand, till the maid
came back with the tea.</p>

<p>"The nurse has come, miss; she'll be up in a minute."</p>

<p>"Pour out the tea. Now, Francis, drink!"</p>

<p>His lips sucked, chattered, sucked. Fleur handed back the cup, and
stood away. His eyes had closed again.</p>

<p>"Oh! ma'am," whispered the maid, "he <i>is</i> bad! Such a nice
young gentleman, too."</p>

<p>"What was his temperature; do you know?"</p>

<p>"I did hear the doctor say nearly 105. Here is the nurse,
ma'am."</p>

<p>Fleur went to her in the doorway.</p>

<p>"It's not just ordinary, nurse--he <i>wants</i> to go. I think a
love-affair's gone wrong. Shall I stop and help you pack him?"</p>

<p>When the pneumonia jacket had been put on, she lingered, looking
down at him. His eyelashes lay close and dark against his cheeks,
long and innocent, like a little boy's.</p>

<p>Outside the door, the maid touched her arm. "I found this letter,
ma'am; ought I to show it to the doctor?"</p>

<p>Fleur read:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"MY POOR DEAR BOY,</p>

<p>"We were crazy yesterday. It isn't any good, you know. Well, I
haven't got a breakable heart; nor have you really, though you may
think so when you get this. Just go back to your sunshine and your
darkies, and put me out of your thoughts. I couldn't stay the course.
I couldn't possibly stand being poor. I must just go through it with
my Scotsman and travel the appointed road. What is the good of
thinking we can play at children in the wood, when one of them is
"Your miserable (at the moment)</p>

<p>"MARJORIE.</p>

<p>"I mean this--I mean it. Don't come and see me any more, and make
it worse for yourself. M."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>"Exactly!" said Fleur. "I've told the nurse. Keep it and give it
him back if he gets well. If he doesn't, burn it. I shall come
to-morrow." And, looking at the maid with a faint smile, she added:
"<i>I</i> am not that lady!"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, ma'am--miss--no, I'm sure! Poor young gentleman! Isn't
there nothing to be done?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I should think not. . . ."</p>

<p>She had kept all these facts from Michael with a sudden
retaliatory feeling. He couldn't have private--or was it public--life
all to himself!</p>

<p>After he had gone out with his 'Good God!' she went to the window.
Queer to have seen Wilfrid again! Her heart had not fluttered, but it
tantalised her not to know whether she could attract him back. Out in
the square it was as dark as when last she had seen him before he
fled to the East--a face pressed to this window that she was touching
with her fingers. 'The burnt child!' No! She did not want to reduce
him to that state again; nor to copy Marjorie Ferrar, who had copied
her. If, instead of going East, Wilfrid had chosen to have pneumonia
like poor Francis! What would she have done? Let him die for want of
her? And what ought she to do about Francis, having seen that letter?
Tell Michael? No, he thought her frivolous and irresponsible. Well!
She would show him! And that sister--who had married Jon? Ought she
to be cabled to? But this would have a rapid crisis, the nurse had
said, and to get over from America in time would be impossible! Fleur
went back to the fire. What kind of girl was this wife of Jon's?
Another in the new fashion--like Norah Curfew; or just one of those
Americans out for her own way and the best of everything? But they
would have the new kind of woman in America, too--even though it
didn't come from Paris. Anne Forsyte!--Fleur gave a little shiver in
front of the hot fire.</p>

<p>She went up-stairs, took off her hat, and scrutinised her image.
Her face was coloured and rounded, her eyes were clear, her brow
unlined, her hair rather flattened. She fluffed it out, and went
across into the nursery.</p>

<p>The eleventh baronet, asleep, was living his private life with a
very determined expression on his face; at the foot of his cot lay
the Dandie, with his chin pressed to the floor, and at the table the
nurse was sewing. In front of her lay an illustrated paper with the
photograph inscribed: "Mrs. Michael Mont, with Kit and Dandie."</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, nurse?"</p>

<p>"I think it's horrible, ma'am; it makes Kit look as if he hadn't
any sense--giving him a stare like that!"</p>

<p>Fleur took up the paper; her quick eyes had seen that it concealed
another. There on the table was a second effigy of herself: "Mrs.
Michael Mont, the pretty young London hostess, who, rumour says, will
shortly be defendant in a Society lawsuit." And, above, yet another
effigy, inscribed: "Miss Marjorie Ferrar, the brilliant granddaughter
of the Marquis of Shropshire, whose engagement to Sir Alexander
MacGown, M. P., is announced."</p>

<p>Fleur dropped paper back on paper.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>SHADOWS</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The dinner, which Marjorie Ferrar had so suddenly recollected, was
MacGown's, and when she reached the appointed restaurant, he was
waiting in the hall.</p>

<p>"Where are the others, Alec?"</p>

<p>"There are no others," said MacGown.</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar reined back. "I can't dine with you alone in a
place like this!"</p>

<p>"I had the Ppynrryns, but they fell through."</p>

<p>"Then I shall go to my Club."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, no, Marjorie. We'll have a private room. Go and
wait in there, while I arrange it."</p>

<p>With a shrug she passed into a little 'lounge.' A young woman
whose face seemed familiar idled in, looked at her, and idled out
again, the ormolu clock ticked, the walls of striped pale grey stared
blankly in the brilliant light, and Marjorie Ferrar stared blankly
back--she was still seeing Francis Wilmot's ecstatic face.</p>

<p>"Now!" said MacGown. "Up those stairs, and third on the right.
I'll follow in a minute."</p>

<p>She had acted in a play, she had passed an emotional hour, and she
was hungry. At least she could dine before making the necessary
scene. And while she drank the best champagne MacGown could buy, she
talked and watched the burning eyes of her adorer. That red-brown
visage, square, stiff-haired head, and powerful frame--what a
contrast to the pale, slim face and form of Francis! This was a man,
and when he liked, agreeable. With him she would have everything she
wanted except--what Francis could give her. And it was one or the
other--not both, as she had thought it might be. She had once crossed
the 'striding edge' on Helvellyn, with a precipice on one side and a
precipice on the other, and herself, doubting down which to fall, in
the middle. She hadn't fallen, and--she supposed--she wouldn't now!
One didn't, if one kept one's head!</p>

<p>Coffee was brought; and she sat, smoking, on the sofa. Her
knowledge of private rooms taught her that she was now as alone with
her betrothed as money could make them. How would he behave?</p>

<p>He threw his cigar away, and sat down by her side. This was the
moment to rise and tell him that he was no longer her betrothed. His
arm went round her, his lips sought her face. "Mind my dress; it's
the only decent one I've got."</p>

<p>And, suddenly, not because she heard a noise, but because her
senses were not absorbed like his, she perceived a figure in the open
doorway. A woman's voice said: "Oh! I beg your pardon; I thought--"
Gone!</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar started up.</p>

<p>"Did you see that young woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Damn her!"</p>

<p>"She's shadowing me."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I don't know her, and yet I know her perfectly. She had a good
look at me down-stairs, when I was waiting."</p>

<p>MacGown dashed to the door and flung it open. Nobody was there! He
shut it, and came back.</p>

<p>"By heaven! Those people, I'll--! Well, that ends it! Marjorie, I
shall send our engagement to the papers to-morrow."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar, leaning her elbows on the mantelpiece, stared at
her own face in the glass above it. 'Not a moral about her!' What did
it matter? If only she could decide to marry Francis out of hand,
slide away from them all--debts, lawyers, Alec! And then the 'You be
damned' spirit in her blood revolted. The impudence of it! Shadowing
her! No! She was not going to leave Miss Fleur triumphant--the little
snob; and that old party with the chin!</p>

<p>MacGown raised her hand to his lips; and, somehow, the caress
touched her.</p>

<p>"Oh! well," she said, "I suppose you'd better."</p>

<p>"Thank God!"</p>

<p>"Do you really think that to get me is a cause for gratitude?"</p>

<p>"I would go through Hell to get you."</p>

<p>"And after? Well, as we're public property, let's go down and
dance."</p>

<p>For an hour she danced. She would not let him take her home, and
in her cab she cried. She wrote to Francis when she got in. She went
out again to post it. The bitter stars, the bitter wind, the bitter
night! At the little slurred thump of her letter dropping, she
laughed. To have played at children! It was too funny! So that was
done with! 'On with the dance!'</p>

<p>Extraordinary, the effect of a little paragraph in the papers!
Credit, like new-struck oil, spurted sky-high. Her post contained,
not bills for dresses, but solicitations to feed, frizz, fur, flower,
feather, furbelow, and photograph her. London offered itself. To
escape that cynical avalanche she borrowed a hundred pounds and flew
to Paris. There, every night, she went to the theatre. She had her
hair done in a new style, she ordered dresses, ate at places known to
the few--living up to Michael's nickname for her; and her heart was
heavy.</p>

<p>She returned after a week, and burned the avalanche--fortunately
all letters of congratulation contained the phrase 'of course you
won't think of answering this.' She didn't. The weather was mild; she
rode in the Row; she prepared to hunt. On the eve of departure, she
received an anonymous communication.</p>

<p>"Francis Wilmot is very ill with pneumonia at the Cosmopolis
Hotel. He is not expected to live."</p>

<p>Her heart flurried round within her breast and flumped; her knees
felt weak; her hand holding the note shook; only her head stayed
steady. The handwriting was 'that little snob's.' Had Francis caused
this message to be sent? Was it his appeal? Poor boy! And must she go
and see him if he were going to die? She so hated death. Did this
mean that it was up to her to save him? What did it mean? But
indecision was not her strong point. In ten minutes she was in a cab,
in twenty at the Hotel. Handing her card, she said:</p>

<p>"You have a Mr. Wilmot here--a relative of mine. I've just heard
of his serious illness. Can I go up and see the nurse?"</p>

<p>The Management looked at the card, inquisitively at her face,
touched a bell, and said:</p>

<p>"Certainly, madam. . . . Here, you--take this lady up to
Room--er--209."</p>

<p>Led by what poor Francis called a 'bell-boy' into the lift, she
walked behind his buttons along a pale-gray river of corridor carpet,
between pale-grey walls, past cream-coloured after cream-coloured
door in the bright electric light, with her head a little down.</p>

<p>The 'bell-boy' knocked ruthlessly on a door.</p>

<p>It was opened, and in the lobby of the suite stood Fleur. . .
.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="C212">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>DEEPENING</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>However untypically American according to Soames, Francis Wilmot
seemed to have the national passion for short cuts.</p>

<p>In two days from Fleur's first visit he had reached the crisis,
hurrying towards it like a man to his bride. Yet, compared with the
instinct to live, the human will is limited, so that he failed to
die. Fleur, summoned by telephone, went home cheered by the doctor's
words: "He'll do now, if we can coax a little strength into him."
That, however, was the trouble. For three afternoons she watched his
exhausted indifference seeming to increase. And she was haunted by
cruel anxiety. On the fourth day she had been sitting for more than
an hour when his eyes opened.</p>

<p>"Yes, Francis?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to quit all right, after all."</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that--it's not American. Of course you're not
going to quit."</p>

<p>He smiled, and shut his eyes. She made up her mind then.</p>

<p>Next day he was about the same, more dead than alive. But her mind
was at rest; her messenger had brought back word that Miss Ferrar
would be in at four o'clock. She would have had the note by now; but
would she come? How little one knew of other people, even when they
were enemies!</p>

<p>He was drowsing, white and strengthless, when she heard the
'bell-boy's' knock. Passing into the lobby, she closed the door
softly behind her, and opened the outer door. So she <i>had</i>
come!</p>

<p>If this meeting of two declared enemies had in it something
dramatic, neither perceived it at the moment. It was just intensely
unpleasant to them both. They stood for a moment looking at each
other's chins. Then Fleur said:</p>

<p>"He's extremely weak. Will you sit down while I tell him you're
here?"</p>

<p>Having seen her settled where Francis Wilmot put his clothes out
to be valeted in days when he had worn them, Fleur passed back into
the bedroom, and again closed the door.</p>

<p>"Francis," she said, "some one is waiting to see you."</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot did not stir, but his eyes opened and cleared
strangely. To Fleur they seemed suddenly the eyes she had known; as
if all these days they had been 'out,' and some one had again put a
match to them.</p>

<p>"You understand what I mean?"</p>

<p>The words came clear and feeble: "Yes; but if I wasn't good enough
for her before, I surely am not now. Tell her I'm through with that
fool business."</p>

<p>A lump rose in Fleur's throat.</p>

<p>"Thank her for coming!" said Francis Wilmot, and closed his eyes
again.</p>

<p>Fleur went back into the lobby. Marjorie Ferrar was standing
against the wall with an un-lighted cigarette between her lips.</p>

<p>"He thanks you for coming; but he doesn't want to see you. I'm
sorry I brought you down."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar took out the cigarette. Fleur could see her lips
quivering. "Will he get well?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I think so--now. He says he's 'through with that
fool business.'"</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar's lips tightened. She opened the outer door,
turned suddenly, and said:</p>

<p>"Will you make it up?"</p>

<p>"No," said Fleur.</p>

<p>There was a moment of complete stillness; then Marjorie Ferrar
gave a little laugh, and slipped out.</p>

<p>Fleur went back. He was asleep. Next day he was stronger. Three
days later Fleur ceased her visits; he was on the road to recovery.
She had become conscious, moreover, that she had a little lamb which,
wherever Mary went, was sure to go. She was being shadowed! How
amusing! And what a bore that she couldn't tell Michael; because she
had not yet begun again to tell him anything.</p>

<p>On the day that she ceased her visits he came in while she was
dressing for dinner, with 'a weekly' in his hand.</p>

<p>"Listen to this," he said:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>'When to God's fondouk the donkeys are taken--<br>
 Donkeys of Africa, Sicily, Spain--<br>
 If peradventure the Deity waken,<br>
 He shall not easily slumber again.<br>
 Where in the sweet of God's straw they have laid them,<br>
 Broken and dead of their burdens and sores,<br>
 He, for a change, shall remember He made them--<br>
 One of the best of His numerous chores--<br>
 Order from some one a sigh of repentance--<br>
 Donkeys of Araby, Syria, Greece--<br>
 Over the fondouk distemper the sentence:<br>
 "God's own forsaken--the stable of Peace.'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>"Who's that by?"</p>

<p>"It sounds like Wilfrid."</p>

<p>"It is by Wilfrid," said Michael, and did not look at her. "I met
him at the 'Hotch-Potch.'"</p>

<p>"And how is he?"</p>

<p>"Very fit."</p>

<p>"Have you asked him here?"</p>

<p>"No. He's going East again soon."</p>

<p>Was he fishing? Did he know that she had seen him? And she
said:</p>

<p>"I'm going down to father's, Michael. He's written twice."</p>

<p>Michael put her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"All right, darling."</p>

<p>Fleur reddened; her strangled confidences seemed knotted in her
throat. She went next day with Kit and Dandie. The 'little lamb'
would hardly follow to 'The Shelter.'</p>

<p>Annette had gone with her mother to Cannes for a month; and Soames
was alone with the English winter. He was paying little attention to
it, for the 'case' was in the list, and might be reached in a few
weeks' time. Deprived of French influence, he was again wavering
towards compromise. The announcement of Marjorie Ferrar's engagement
to McGown had materially changed the complexion of affairs. In the
eyes of a British Jury, the character of a fast young lady, and the
character of the same young lady publicly engaged to a Member of
Parliament, with wealth and a handle to his name, would not be at all
the same thing. They were now virtually dealing with Lady MacGown,
and nothing, Soames knew, was so fierce as a man about to be married.
To libel his betrothed was like approaching a mad dog.</p>

<p>He looked very grave when Fleur told him of her 'little lamb.' It
was precisely the retaliation he had feared; nor could he tell her
that he had 'told her so,' because he hadn't. He had certainly urged
her to come down to him, but delicacy had forbidden him to give her
the reason. So far as he could tell through catechism, there had been
nothing 'suspect' in her movements since Lippinghall, except those
visits to the Cosmopolis Hotel. But they were bad enough. Who was
going to believe that she went to this sick man out of pure kindness?
Such a motive was not current in a Court of Law. He was staggered
when she told him that Michael didn't know of them. Why not?</p>

<p>"I didn't feel like telling him."</p>

<p>"Feel? Don't you see what a position you've put yourself in? Here
you are, running to a young man's bedside, without your husband's
knowledge."</p>

<p>"Yes, darling; but he was terribly ill."</p>

<p>"I dare say," said Soames; "so are lots of people."</p>

<p>"Besides, he was over head and ears in love with <i>her."</i></p>

<p>"D'you think he's going to admit that, even if we could call
him?"</p>

<p>Fleur was silent, thinking of Francis Wilmot's face.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know," she said at last. "How horrid it all is!"</p>

<p>"Of course it's horrid," said Soames. "Have you had a quarrel with
Michael?"</p>

<p>"No; not a quarrel. Only he doesn't tell <i>me</i> things."</p>

<p>"What things?"</p>

<p>"How should I know, dear?"</p>

<p>Soames grunted. "Would he have minded your going?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. He'd have minded if I hadn't. He likes that
boy."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Soames, "either you or he, or both, will have
to tell a lie, and say that he did know. I shall go up and talk to
him. Thank goodness we can prove the illness. If I catch anybody
coming down here after you--!"</p>

<p>He went up the following afternoon. Parliament being in recess, he
sought the 'Hotch-Potch' Club. He did not like a place always
connected in his mind with his dead cousin, that fellow young Jolyon,
and said to Michael at once: "Can we go somewhere else?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; where would you like?"</p>

<p>"To your place, if you can put me up for the night. I want to have
a talk with you."</p>

<p>Michael looked at him askance.</p>

<p>"Now," said Soames, after dinner, "what's this about Fleur--she
says you don't tell her things?"</p>

<p>Michael gazed into his glass of port.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he said slowly, "I'd be only too glad to, of course,
but I don't think they really interest her. She doesn't feel that
public things matter."</p>

<p>"Public! I meant private."</p>

<p>"There aren't any private things. Do you mean that she thinks
there are?"</p>

<p>Soames dropped his scrutiny.</p>

<p>"I don't know--she said 'things.'"</p>

<p>"Well, you can put that out of your head, and hers."</p>

<p>"H'm! Anyway, the result's been that she's been visiting that
young American with pneumonia at the Cosmopolis Hotel, without
letting you know. It's a mercy she hasn't picked it up."</p>

<p>"Francis Wilmot?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He's out of the wood, now. That's not the point. She's been
shadowed."</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Michael.</p>

<p>"Exactly! This is what comes of not talking to your wife. Wives
are funny--they don't like it."</p>

<p>Michael grinned.</p>

<p>"Put yourself in my place, sir. It's my profession, now, to fuss
about the state of the Country, and all that; and you know how it
is--one gets keen. But to Fleur, it's all a stunt. I quite understand
that; but, you see, the keener I get, the more I'm afraid of boring
her, and the less I feel I can talk to her about it. In a sort of way
she's jealous."</p>

<p>Soames rubbed his chin. The state of the Country was a curious
kind of co-respondent. He himself was often worried by the state of
the Country, but as a source of division between husband and wife it
seemed to him cold-blooded; he had known other sources in his
time!</p>

<p>"Well, you mustn't let it go on," he said. "It's trivial."</p>

<p>Michael got up.</p>

<p>"Trivial! Well, sir, I don't know, but it seems to me very much
the sort of thing that happened when the war came. Men had to leave
their wives then."</p>

<p>"Wives put up with that," said Soames, "the Country was in
danger."</p>

<p>"Isn't it in danger now?"</p>

<p>With his inveterate distrust of words, it seemed to Soames almost
indecent for a young man to talk like that. Michael was a politician,
of course; but politicians were there to keep the Country quiet, not
to go raising scares and talking through their hats.</p>

<p>"When you've lived a little longer," he said, "you'll know that
there's always something to fuss about if you like to fuss. There's
nothing in it really; the pound's going up. Besides, it doesn't
matter what you tell Fleur, so long as you tell her something."</p>

<p>"She's intelligent, sir," said Michael.</p>

<p>Soames was taken aback. He could not deny the fact, and
answered:</p>

<p>"Well, national affairs are too remote; you can't expect a woman
to be interested in them."</p>

<p>"Quite a lot of women are."</p>

<p>"Blue-stockings."</p>

<p>"No, sir; they nearly all wear 'nude.'"</p>

<p>"H'm! Those! As to interest in national affairs--put a tax on
stockings, and see what happens!"</p>

<p>Michael grinned.</p>

<p>"I'll suggest it, sir."</p>

<p>"If you expect," said Soames, "that people--women or not--are
going to put themselves out of the way for any scheme like this--this
Foggartism of yours, you'll be very much disappointed."</p>

<p>"So everybody tells me. It's just because I don't like cold water
at home as well as abroad, that I've given up worrying Fleur."</p>

<p>"Well, if you take my advice, you'll take up something
practical--the state of the traffic, or penny postage. Drop
pessimism; people who talk at large like that, never get trusted in
this country. In any case you'll have to say you knew about her
visits to that young man."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir, wife and husband are one. But you don't really
mean to let them make a circus of it in Court?"</p>

<p>Soames was silent. He did not <i>mean</i> them to; but what if
they did?</p>

<p>"I can't tell," he said, at last. "The fellow's a Scotchman. What
did you go hitting him on the nose for?"</p>

<p>"He gave me a thick ear first. I know it was an excellent
opportunity for turning the other cheek, but I didn't think of it in
time."</p>

<p>"You must have called him something."</p>

<p>"Only a dirty dog. As you know, he suggested a low motive for my
speech."</p>

<p>Soames stared. In his opinion this young man was taking himself
much too seriously.</p>

<p>"Your speech! You've got to get it out of your mind," he said,
"that anything you can say or do will make any difference."</p>

<p>"Then what's the good of my being in Parliament?"</p>

<p>"Well, you're in the same boat with everybody else. The Country's
like a tree; you can keep it in order, but you can't go taking it up
by the roots to look at them."</p>

<p>Michael looked at him, impressed.</p>

<p>"In public matters," said Soames, "the thing is to keep a level
head, and do no more than you're obliged."</p>

<p>"And what's to govern one's view of necessity?"</p>

<p>"Common-sense. One can't have everything."</p>

<p>And rising, he began scrutinising the Goya.</p>

<p>"Are you going to buy another Goya, sir?"</p>

<p>"No; if I buy any more pictures, I shall go back to the English
School."</p>

<p>"Patriotism?"</p>

<p>Soames gave him a sharp look.</p>

<p>"There's no patriotism," he said, "in fussing. And another thing
you've got to remember is that foreigners like to hear that we've got
troubles. It doesn't do to discuss our affairs out loud."</p>

<p>Michael took these sayings to bed with him. He remembered, when he
came out of the war, thinking: 'If there's another war, nothing will
induce me to go.' But now, if one were to come, he knew he
<i>would</i> be going again. So Old Forsyte thought he was just
'fussing'! Was he? Was Foggartism a phlizz? Ought he to come to heel,
and take up the state of the traffic? Was everything unreal? Surely
not his love for Fleur? Anyway he felt hungry for her lying there.
And Wilfrid back, too! To risk his happiness with her for the sake
of--what? <i>Punch</i> had taken a snap at him this week, grinning
and groping at a surrounding fog. Old England, like Old Forsyte, had
no use for theories. Self-conscious national efforts were just
pomposity. Pompous! He? The thought was terribly disturbing. He got
out of bed and went to the window. Foggy! In fog all were shadows;
and he the merest shadow of them all, an unpractical politician,
taking things to heart! One! Two! Big Ben! How many hearts had he
turned to water! How many dreams spoiled, with his measured
resonance! Line up with the top-dressers, and leave the Country to
suck its silver spoon!</p>

<h2><a name="C301">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>'CIRCUSES'</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In his early boyhood Soames had been given to the circus. He had
outgrown it; 'Circuses' were now to him little short of an
abomination. Jubilees and Pageants, that recurrent decimal, the Lord
Mayor, Earl's Court, Olympia, Wembley--he disliked them all. He could
not stand a lot of people with their mouths open. Dressing up was to
him a symptom of weak-mindedness, and the collective excitement of a
crowd an extravagance which offended his reticent individualism.
Though not deeply versed in history, he had an idea, too, that
nations who went in for 'circuses' were decadent. Queen Victoria's
funeral, indeed, had impressed him--there had been a feeling in the
air that day; but ever since, things had gone from bad to worse. They
made everything into a 'circus' now! A man couldn't commit a murder
without the whole paper-reading population--himself included--looking
over each other's shoulders; and as to these football-matches, and
rodeos--they interfered with the traffic and the normal course of
conversation; people were so crazy about them!</p>

<p>Of course, 'circuses' had their use. They kept the people quiet.
Violence by proxy, for instance, was obviously a political principle
of some value. It was difficult to gape and shed blood at the same
time; the more people stood in rows by day to see others being hurt,
the less trouble would they take to hurt others themselves, and the
sounder Soames could sleep by night. Still, sensation-hunting had
become a disease, in his opinion, and no one was being inoculated for
it, so far as he could see!</p>

<p>As the weeks went on and the cases before it in the List went off,
the 'circus' they were proposing to make of his daughter appeared to
him more and more monstrous. He had an instinctive distrust of
Scotchmen--they called themselves Scotsmen nowadays, as if it helped
their character!--they never let go, and he could not approve in
other people a quality native to himself. Besides, 'Scotchmen' were
so--so exuberant--always either dour or else hearty--extravagant
chaps! Towards the middle of March, with the case in the list for the
following week, he took an extreme step and entered the Lobby of the
House of Commons. He had spoken to no one of his determination to
make this last effort, for it seemed to him that all--Annette,
Michael, Fleur herself--had done their best to spoil the chance of
settlement.</p>

<p>Having sent in his card, he waited a long while in that lofty
purlieu. 'Lobbying,' he knew the phrase, but had never realised the
waste of time involved in it. The statues consoled him somewhat. Sir
Stafford Northcote--a steady chap; at old Forsyte dinner-parties in
the eighties his character had been as much a standby as the saddle
of mutton. He found even 'that fellow Gladstone' bearable in stucco,
or whatever it was up there. You might dislike, but you couldn't
sneeze at him, as at some of these modern chaps. He was sunk in coma
before Lord Granville when at last he heard the words:</p>

<p>"Sir Alexander MacGown," and saw a square man with a ruddy face,
stiff black hair, and clipped moustache, coming between the railings,
with a card in his hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Forsyte?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Can we go anywhere that's not quite so public?"</p>

<p>The 'Scotchman' nodded, and led him down a corridor to a small
room.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>Soames smoothed his hat. "This affair," he said, "can't be any
more agreable to you than it is to me."</p>

<p>"Are you the individual who was good enough to apply the word
'traitress' to the lady I'm engaged to?"</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"Then I don't see how you have the impudence to come and speak to
me."</p>

<p>Soames bit his lips.</p>

<p>"I spoke under the provocation of hearing your
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i> call my daughter a snob, in her own house. Do
you want this petty affair made public?"</p>

<p>"If you think that you and your daughter can get away with calling
the lady I'm going to marry 'a snake,' 'a traitress,' 'an immoral
person,' you're more mistaken that you ever were in your life. An
unqualified apology that her Counsel can announce in Court is your
only way out."</p>

<p>"That you won't get; mutual regret is another thing. As to the
question of damages--"</p>

<p>"Damn the damages!" said MacGown violently. And there was that in
Soames which applauded.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I'm sorry for you and her."</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"You will know by the end of next week, unless you revise your
views in between. If it comes into Court, we shall justify."</p>

<p>The 'Scotchman' went so red that for a moment Soames was really
afraid he would have an apoplectic fit.</p>

<p>"You'd better look out what you say in Court."</p>

<p>"We pay no attention to bullies in Court."</p>

<p>MacGown clenched his fists.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Soames, "it's a pity I'm not your age. Good
evening!"</p>

<p>He passed the fellow and went out. He had noted his way in this
'rabbit warren,' and was soon back among the passionless statues.
Well! He had turned the last stone and could do no more, except make
that overbearing fellow and his young woman sorry they'd ever been
born. He came out into the chilly mist of Westminster. Pride and
temper! Sooner than admit themselves in the wrong, people would turn
themselves into an expensive 'circus' for the gaping and the sneers,
the japing and the jeers of half the town! To vindicate her 'honour,'
that 'Scotchman' would have his young woman's past dragged out! And
fairly faced by the question whether to drag it out or not, Soames
stood still. If he didn't, she might get a verdict; if he did, and
didn't convince the jury, the damages would be shockingly increased.
They might run into thousands. He felt the need of definite decision.
One had been drifting in the belief that the thing wouldn't come into
Court! Four o'clock! Not too late, perhaps, to see Sir James
Foskisson. He would telephone to very young Nicholas to arrange a
conference at once, and if Michael was at South Square, he would take
him down to it. . . .</p>

<p>In his study, Michael had been staring with lugubrious relish at
Aubrey Greene's cartoon of himself in a Society paper. On one leg,
like Guy--or was it Slingsby?--in the Edward Lear 'Nonsense' book, he
was depicted crying in a wilderness where a sardonic smile was rising
on the horizon. Out of his mouth the word 'Foggartism' wreathed like
the smoke of a cigar. Above a hole in the middle distance, a
meercat's body supported the upturned face and applauding forepaws of
Mr. Blythe. The thing was devastating in treatment and design--not
unkind, merely killing. Michael's face had been endowed with a sort
of after-dinner rapture, as if he were enjoying the sound of his own
voice. Ridicule! Not even a personal friend, an artist, could see
that the wilderness was at least as deserving of ridicule as the
pelican! The cartoon seemed to write the word futility large across
his page. It recalled to him Fleur's words at the outset: "And by the
time the Tories go out you'll have your licence." She was a born
realist! From the first she had foreseen for him the position of an
eccentric, picturesquely beating a little private drum! A dashed good
cartoon! And no one could appreciate it so deeply as its victim. But
why did every one smile at Foggartism? Why? Because among a people
who naturally walked, it leaped like a grasshopper; to a nation that
felt its way in fog, it seemed a will-o'-the-wisp. Yes, he was a fool
for his pains! And--just then, Soames arrived.</p>

<p>"I've been to see that Scotchman," he said. "He means to take it
into Court."</p>

<p>"Oh! Not really, sir! I always thought you'd keep it out."</p>

<p>"Only an unqualified apology will do that. Fleur can't give it;
she's in the right. Can you come down with me now and see Sir James
Foskisson?"</p>

<p>They set out in a taxi for the Temple.</p>

<p>The chambers of very young Nicholas Forsyte were in Paper
Buildings. Chinny, mild and nearly forty, he succeeded within ten
minutes in presenting to them every possible doubt.</p>

<p>"He seems to enjoy the prospect of getting tonked," murmured
Michael while they were going over to Sir James.</p>

<p>"A poor thing," Soames responded; "but careful. Foskisson must
attend to the case himself."</p>

<p>After those necessary minutes during which the celebrated K. C.
was regathering from very young Nicholas what it was all about, they
were ushered into the presence of one with a large head garnished by
small grey whiskers, and really obvious brains. Since selecting him,
Soames had been keeping his eye on the great advocate; had watched
him veiling his appeals to a jury with an air of scrupulous equity;
very few--he was convinced--and those not on juries, could see Sir
James Foskisson coming round a corner. Soames had specially remarked
his success in cases concerned with morals or nationality--no one so
apt at getting a co-respondent, a German, a Russian, or anybody at
all bad, non-suited! At close quarters his whiskers seemed to give
him an intensive respectability--difficult to imagine him dancing,
gambling, or in bed. In spite of his practice, too, he enjoyed the
reputation of being thorough; he might be relied on to know more than
half the facts of any case by the time he went into Court, and to
pick up the rest as he went along--or at least not to show that he
hadn't. Very young Nicholas, knowing all the facts, had seemed quite
unable to see what line could possibly be taken. Sir James, on the
other hand, appeared to know only just enough. Sliding his light eyes
from Soames to Michael, he retailed them, and said: "Eminently a case
for an amicable settlement."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Soames.</p>

<p>Something in his voice seemed to bring Sir James to attention.</p>

<p>"Have you attempted that?"</p>

<p>"I have gone to the limit."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Forsyte, but what do you regard as the limit?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred pounds, and a mutual expression of regret. They'd
accept the money, but they ask for an unqualified apology."</p>

<p>The great lawyer rested his chin. "Have you tried the unqualified
apology without the money?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I would almost be inclined. MacGown is a very rich man. The
shadow and the substance, eh? The expressions in the letters are
strong. What do you say, Mr. Mont?"</p>

<p>"Not so strong as those she used of my wife."</p>

<p>Sir James Foskisson looked at very young Nicholas.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he said, "those were--?"</p>

<p>"Lion-huntress, and snob," said Michael, curtly.</p>

<p>Sir James wagged his head precisely as if it were a pair of
scales.</p>

<p>"Immoral, snake, traitress, without charm--you think those
weaker?"</p>

<p>"They don't make you snigger, sir, the others do. In Society it's
the snigger that counts."</p>

<p>Sir James smiled.</p>

<p>"The jury won't be in Society, Mr. Mont."</p>

<p>"My wife doesn't feel like making an apology, anyway, unless
there's an expression of regret on the other side; and I don't see
why she should."</p>

<p>Sir James Foskisson seemed to breathe more freely.</p>

<p>"In that case," he said, "we have to consider whether to use the
detective's evidence or not. If we do, we shall need to subpoena the
hall porter and the servants at Mr--er--Curfew's flat."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Soames; "that's what we're here to decide." It was
as if he had said: 'The conference is now opened.'</p>

<p>Sir James perused the detective's evidence for five silent
minutes.</p>

<p>"If this is confirmed, even partially," he said, at last, "we
win."</p>

<p>Michael had gone to the window. The trees in the garden had tiny
buds; some pigeons were strutting on the grass below. He heard Soames
say:</p>

<p>"I ought to tell you that they've been shadowing my daughter.
There's nothing, of course, except some visits to a young American
dangerously ill of pneumonia at his hotel."</p>

<p>"Of which I knew and approved," said Michael, without turning
round.</p>

<p>"Could we call him?"</p>

<p>"I believe he's still at Bournemouth. But he was in love with Miss
Ferrar."</p>

<p>Sir James turned to Soames.</p>

<p>"If there's no question of a settlement, we'd better go for the
gloves. Merely to cross-examine as to books and play and clubs, is
very inconclusive."</p>

<p>"Have you read the dark scene in 'The Plain Dealer'?" asked
Soames; "and that novel, 'Canthar'?"</p>

<p>"All very well, Mr. Forsyte, but impossible to say what a jury
would make of impersonal evidence like that."</p>

<p>Michael had come back to his seat.</p>

<p>"I've a horror," he said, "of dragging in Miss Ferrar's private
life."</p>

<p>"No doubt. But do you want me to win the case?"</p>

<p>"Not that way. Can't we go into Court, say nothing, and pay
up?"</p>

<p>Sir James Foskisson smiled and looked at Soames. 'Really,' he
seemed to say, 'why did you bring me this young man?'</p>

<p>Soames, however, had been pursuing his own thoughts.</p>

<p>"There's too much risk about that flat; if we failed there, it
might be a matter of twenty thousand pounds. Besides, they would
certainly call my daughter. I want to prevent that at all costs. I
thought you could turn the whole thing into an indictment of modern
morality."</p>

<p>Sir James Foskisson moved in his chair, and the pupils of his
light-blue eyes became as pinpoints. He nodded almost imperceptibly
three times, precisely as if he had seen the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>"When shall we be reached?" he said to very young Nicholas.</p>

<p>"Probably next Thursday--Mr. Justice Brane."</p>

<p>"Very well. I'll see you again on Monday. Good evening." And he
sank back into an immobility, which neither Soames nor Michael felt
equal to disturbing.</p>

<p>They went away silent--very young Nicholas tarrying in
conversation with Sir James' devil.</p>

<p>Turning at the Temple station, Michael murmured:</p>

<p>"It was just as if he'd said: 'Some stunt!' wasn't it? I'm looking
in at <i>The Outpost,</i> sir. If you're going back to Fleur, will
you tell her?"</p>

<p>Soames nodded. There it was! He had to do everything that was
painful.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="C302">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>"NOT GOING TO HAVE IT"</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In the office of <i>The Outpost</i> Mr. Blythe had just been in
conversation with one of those great business men who make such deep
impression on all to whom they voice their views in strict
confidence. If Sir Thomas Lockit did not precisely monopolise the
control of manufacture in Great Britain, he, like others, caused
almost any one to think so--his knowledge was so positive and his
emphasis so cold. In his view the Country must resume the position
held before the Great War. It all hinged on coal--a question of this
seven hours a day; and they were "not going to have it." A shilling,
perhaps two shillings, off the cost of coal. They were "not going to
have" Europe doing without British produce. Very few people knew Sir
Thomas Lockit's mind; but nearly all who did were extraordinarily
gratified.</p>

<p>Mr. Blythe, however, was biting his finger, and spitting out the
result.</p>

<p>"Who was that fellow with the grey moustache?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"Lockit. He's 'not going to have it.'"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Michael, in some surprise.</p>

<p>"One sees more and more, Mont, that the really dangerous people
are not the politicians, who want things with public passion--that
is, mildly, slowly; but the big business men, who want things with
private passion, strenuously, quickly. They know their own minds; and
if we don't look out they'll wreck the country."</p>

<p>"What are they up to now?" said Michael.</p>

<p>"Nothing for the moment; but it's brewing. One sees in Lockit the
futility of will-power. He's not going to have what it's entirely out
of his power to prevent. He'd like to break Labour and make it work
like a nigger from sheer necessity. Before that we shall be having
civil war. Some of the Labour people, of course, are just as
bad--they want to break everybody. It's a bee nuisance. If we're all
to be plunged into industrial struggles again, how are we to get on
with Foggartism?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about the Country," said Michael. "Aren't we
beating the air, Blythe? Is it any good telling a man who's lost a
lung, that what he wants is a new one?"</p>

<p>Mr. Blythe puffed out one cheek.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "the Country had a hundred very settled
years--Waterloo to the War--to get into its present state; it's got
its line of life so fixed and its habits so settled that
nobody--neither editors, politicians, nor business men--can think
except in terms of its bloated town industrialism. The Country's got
beyond the point of balance in that hundred settled years, and it'll
want fifty settled years to get back to that point again. The real
trouble is that we're not going to get fifty settled years. Some bee
thing or other--war with Turkey or Russia, trouble in India, civil
ructions, to say nothing of another general flare-up--may knock the
bottom out of any settled plans any time. We've struck a disturbed
patch of history, and we know it in our bones, and live from hand to
mouth, according."</p>

<p>"Well, then!" said Michael, glumly, thinking of what the Minister
had said to him at Lippinghall.</p>

<p>Mr. Blythe puffed out the other cheek.</p>

<p>"No backsliding, young man! In Foggartism we have the best goods
we can see before us, and we must bee well deliver them, as best we
can. We've outgrown all the old hats."</p>

<p>"Have you seen Aubrey Greene's cartoon?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Good--isn't it? But what I realty came in to tell you, is that
this beastly libel case of ours will be on next week."</p>

<p>Mr. Blythe's ears moved.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for that. Win or lose--nothing's worse for public life
than private ructions. You're not going to have it, are you?"</p>

<p>"We can't help it. But our defence is to be confined to an attack
on the new morality."</p>

<p>"One can't attack what isn't," said Mr. Blythe.</p>

<p>"D'you mean to say," said Michael, grinning, "that you haven't
noticed the new morality?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Formulate it if you can."</p>

<p>"'Don't be stupid, don't be dull.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Blythe grunted. "The old morality used to be: 'Behave like a
gentleman.'"</p>

<p>"Yes! But in modern thought there ain't no sich an animal."</p>

<p>"There are fragments lying about; they reconstructed Neanderthal
man from half a skull."</p>

<p>"A word that's laughed at can't be used, Blythe."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Blythe. "The chief failings of your generation,
young Mont, are sensitiveness to ridicule, and terror of being behind
the times. It's bee weakminded."</p>

<p>Michael grinned.</p>

<p>"I know it. Come down to the House. Parsham's Electrification Bill
is due. We may get some lights on Unemployment."</p>

<p>Having parted from Mr. Blythe in the Lobby, Michael came on his
father walking down a corridor with a short bright old man in a trim
grey beard.</p>

<p>"Ah! Michael, we've been seeking you. Marquess, my hopeful son!
The marquess wants to interest you in electricity."</p>

<p>Michael removed his hat.</p>

<p>"Will you come to the reading-room, sir?"</p>

<p>This, as he knew, was Marjorie Ferrar's grandfather, and might be
useful. In a remote corner of a room lighted so that nobody could see
anyone else reading, they sat down in triangular formation.</p>

<p>"You know about electricity, Mr. Mont?" said the marquess.</p>

<p>"No, sir, except that more of it would be desirable in this
room."</p>

<p>"Everywhere, Mr. Mont. I've read about your Foggartism; if you'll
allow me to say so, it's quite possibly the policy of the future; but
nothing will be done with it till you've electrified the country. I
should like you to start by supporting this Bill of Parsham's."</p>

<p>And, with an engaging distinction of syllable, the old peer
proceeded to darken Michael's mind.</p>

<p>"I see, sir," said Michael, at last. "This Bill ought to add
considerably to Unemployment."</p>

<p>"Temporarily."</p>

<p>"I wonder if I ought to take on any more temporary trouble. I'm
finding it difficult enough to interest people in the future as it
is--they seem to think the present so important."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence whinnied.</p>

<p>"You must give him time and pamphlets, Marquess. But, my dear
fellow, while your Foggartism is confined to the stable, you'll want
a second horse."</p>

<p>"I've been advised already to take up the state of the traffic or
penny postage. And, by the way, sir, that case of ours is coming into
Court, next week."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence's loose eyebrow shot up:</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said. "Do you remember, Marquess--your granddaughter and
my daughter-in-law? I came to you about it."</p>

<p>"Something to do with lions? A libel, was it?" said the old peer.
"My aunt--"</p>

<p>While Michael was trying to decide whether this was an ejaculation
or the beginning of a reminiscence, his father broke in:</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, an interesting case that, Marquess--it's all in Betty
Montecourt's Memoirs."</p>

<p>"Libels," resumed the marquess, "had flavour in those days. The
words complained of were: 'Her crinoline covers her considerable
obliquity.'"</p>

<p>"If anything's to be done to save scandal," muttered Michael, "it
must be done now. We're at a deadlock."</p>

<p>"Could <i>you</i> put in a word, sir?" said Sir Lawrence.</p>

<p>The marquess's beard quivered.</p>

<p>"I see from the papers that my granddaughter is marrying a man
called MacGown, a Member of this House. Is he about?"</p>

<p>"Probably," said Michael. "But I had a row with him. I think, sir,
there would be more chance with her."</p>

<p>The marquess rose. "I'll ask her to breakfast. I dislike
publicity. Well, I hope you'll vote for this Bill, Mr. Mont, and
think over the question of electrifying the Country. We want young
men interested. I'm going to the Peers' Gallery, now. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>When briskly he had gone, Michael said to his father: "If he's not
going to have it, I wish he'd ask Fleur to breakfast too. There are
two parties to this quarrel."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="C303">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>SOAMES DRIVES HOME</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Soames in the meantime was seated with one of those parties in her
'parlour.' She had listened in silence, but with a stubborn and
resentful face. What did he know of the loneliness and frustration
she had been feeling? Could he tell that the thrown stone had starred
her mirrored image of herself; that the words 'snob,' and
'lion-huntress,' had entered her very soul? He could not understand
the spiritual injury she had received, the sudden deprivation of that
self-importance, and hope of rising, necessary to all. Concerned by
the expression on her face, preoccupied with the practical aspects of
the 'circus' before them, and desperately involved in thoughts of how
to keep her out of it as much as possible, Soames was reduced to the
closeness of a fish.</p>

<p>"You'll be sitting in front, next to me," he said. "I shouldn't
wear anything too bright. Would you like your mother there, too?"</p>

<p>Fleur shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Just so," said Soames. "But if she wants to come, she'd better,
perhaps. Brane is not a joking judge, thank goodness. Have you ever
been in a Court?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"The great thing is to keep still, and pay no attention to
anything. They'll all be behind you, except the jury--and there's
nothing in them really. If you look at them, don't smile!"</p>

<p>"Why? Aren't they safe, Dad?"</p>

<p>Soames put the levity aside.</p>

<p>"I should wear a small hat. Michael must sit on your left. Have
you got over that--er--not telling each other things?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't begin it again. He's very fond of you."</p>

<p>Fleur nodded.</p>

<p>"Is there anything you want to tell <i>me?</i> You know I--I worry
about you."</p>

<p>Fleur got up and sat on the arm of his chair; he had at once a
feeling of assuagement.</p>

<p>"I really don't care now. The harm's done. I only hope
<i>she'll</i> have a bad time."</p>

<p>Soames, who had the same hope, was somewhat shocked by its
expression.</p>

<p>He took leave of her soon after and got into his car for the dark
drive back to Mapledurham.</p>

<p>The Spring evening was cold and he had the windows up. At first he
thought of very little; and then of still less. He had passed a
tiring afternoon, and was glad of the slight smell of stephanotis
provided by Annette. The road was too familiar to rouse his thoughts,
beyond wonder at the lot of people there always seemed to be in the
world between six and seven. He dozed his way into the new cut, woke,
and dozed again. What was this--Slough? Before going to Marlborough
he had been at school there with young Nicholas and St. John Hayman,
and after his time, some other young Forsytes. Nearly sixty years
ago! He remembered his first day--a brand-new little boy in a
brand-new little top-hat, with a playbox stored by his mother with
things to eat, and blessed with the words: "There, Summy dear,
that'll make you popular." He had reckoned on having command of that
corruption for some weeks; but no sooner had he produced a bit of it,
than they had taken the box, and suggested to him that it would be a
good thing to eat the lot. In twenty-two minutes twenty-two boys had
materially increased their weight, and he himself, in handing out the
contents, had been obliged to eat less than a twenty-third. They had
left him one packet of biscuits, and those had caraway seeds, for
which he had constitutionally no passion whatever. Afterwards three
other new boys had complained that he was a fool for having it all
eaten up like that, instead of saving it for them, and he had been
obliged to sit on their heads one by one. His popularity had lasted
twenty-two minutes, and, so far as he knew, had never come back. He
had been against Communism ever since.</p>

<p>Bounding a little on the cushioned seat, he remembered poignantly
his own cousin St. John Hayman pushing him into a gorse-bush and
holding him there for an appreciable minute. Horrid little brutes,
boys! For a moment he felt quite grateful to Michael for trying to
get them out of England. And yet--! He had some pleasant memories
even of boys. There was his collection of butterflies--he had sold
two Red Admirals in poor condition to a boy for one-and-threepence.
To be a boy again--h'm--and shoot peas at passengers in a train that
couldn't stop, and drink cherry brandy going home, and win a prize by
reciting two hundred lines of 'The Lady of the Lake' better than
'Cherry-Tart' Burroughes--Um? What had become of 'Cherry-Tart'
Burroughes, who had so much money at school that his father went
bankrupt! 'Cherry-Tart' Burroughes!</p>

<p>The loom of Slough faded. One was in rank country now, and he
ground the handle of the window to get a little fresh air. A smell of
trees and grass came in. Boys out of England! They had funny accents
in those great places overseas. Well, they had funny accents here,
too. The accent had been all right at Slough--if it wasn't a boy got
lammed. He remembered the first time his father and mother--James and
Emily--came down; very genteel (before the word was flyblown), all
whiskers and crinoline; the beastly boys had made personal remarks
which had hurt him! Get 'em out of England! But in those days there
had been nowhere for boys to go. He took a long breath of the wayside
air. They said England was changed, spoiled, some even said 'done
for.' Bosh! It still smelt the same! His great uncle 'Superior
Dosset's' brother Simon had gone as a boy to Bermuda at the beginning
of the last century, and had he been heard of since? Not he. Young
Jon Forsyte and his mother--his own first, unfaithful, still not
quite forgotten wife--had gone to the States--would they be heard of
again? He hoped not. England! Some day, when he had time and the car
was free, he would go and poke round on the border of Dorset and
Devon where the Forsytes came from. There was nothing there--he
understood, and he wouldn't care to let anybody know of his going;
but the earth must be some sort of colour, and there would be a
graveyard, and--ha! Maidenhead! These sprawling villas and hotels and
gramophones spoiled the river. Funny that Fleur had never been very
fond of the river; too slow and wet, perhaps--everything was quick
and dry now, like America. But had they such a river as the Thames
anywhere out of England? Not they! Nothing that ran green and clear
and weedy, where you could sit in a punt and watch the cows, and
those big elms, and the poplars. Nothing that was safe and quiet,
where you called your soul your own and thought of Constable and
Mason and Walker.</p>

<p>His car bumped something slightly, and came to a stand. That
fellow Riggs was always bumping something! He looked out. The
chauffeur had got down and was examining his mudguard.</p>

<p>"What was that?" said Soames.</p>

<p>"I think it was a pig, sir."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Shall I drive on, or see?"</p>

<p>Soames looked round. There seemed no habitations in sight.</p>

<p>"Better see."</p>

<p>The chauffeur disappeared behind the car. Soames remained seated.
He had never had any pigs. They said the pig was a clean animal.
People didn't treat pigs properly. It was very quiet! No cars on the
road; in the silence the wind was talking a little in the hedgerow.
He noticed some stars.</p>

<p>"It is a pig, sir; he's breathing."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Soames. If a cat had nine, how many lives had a pig? He
remembered his father James' only riddle: "If a herring and a half
cost three-a'pence, what's the price of a gridiron?" When still very
small, he had perceived that it was unanswerable.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" he said.</p>

<p>"In the ditch, sir."</p>

<p>A pig was property, but if in the ditch, nobody would notice it
till after he was home. "Drive on," he said: "No! Wait.'" And,
opening the near door, he got out. After all, the pig was in
distress. "Show me," he said, and moved in the tail-light of his car
to where the chauffeur stood pointing. There, in the shallow ditch,
was a dark object emitting cavernous low sounds, as of a man asleep
in a Club chair.</p>

<p>"It must belong to one of them cottages we passed a bit back,"
said the chauffeur.</p>

<p>Soames looked at the pig.</p>

<p>"Anything broken?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; the mudguard's all right. I fancy it copped him pretty
fair."</p>

<p>"In the pig, I meant."</p>

<p>The chauffeur touched the pig with his boot. It squealed, and
Soames quivered. Some one would hear! Just like that fellow, drawing
attention to it--no gumption whatever! But how, without touching, did
you find out whether anything was broken in the pig? He moved a step
and saw the pig's eyes; and a sort of fellow-feeling stirred in him.
What if it had a broken leg! Again the chauffeur touched it with his
foot. The pig uttered a lamentable noise, and, upheaving its bulk,
squealing and grunting, trotted off. Soames hastily resumed his seat.
"Drive on!" he said. Pigs! They never thought of anything but
themselves; and cottagers were just as bad--very unpleasant about
cars. And he wasn't sure they weren't right--tearing great things!
The pig's eye seemed looking at him again from where his feet were
resting. Should he keep some, now that he had those meadows on the
other side of the river? Eat one's own bacon, cure one's own hams!
After all, there was something in it--clean pigs, properly fed! That
book of old Foggart said one must grow more food in England, and be
independent if there were another war. He sniffed. Smell of
baking--Reading, already! They still grew biscuits in England!
Foreign countries growing his food--something unpleasant about living
on sufferance like that! After all, English meat and English
wheat--as for a potato, you couldn't get one fit to eat in Italy, or
France. And now they wanted to trade with Russia again! Those
Bolshevists hated England. Eat their wheat and eggs, use their tallow
and skins? Infra dig, he called it! The car swerved and he was jerked
against the side cushions. The village church!--that fellow Riggs was
always shying at something. Pretty little old affair, too, with its
squat spire and its lichen--couldn't see that out of England--graves,
old names, yew-trees. And that reminded him: One would have to be
buried, some day. Here, perhaps. Nothing flowery! Just his name,
'Soames Forsyte,' standing out on rough stone, like that grave he had
sat on at Highgate; no need to put 'Here lies'--of course he'd lie!
As to a cross, he didn't know. Probably they'd put one, whatever he
wished. He'd like to be in a corner, though, away from people--with
an apple-tree or something, over him. The less they remembered him,
the better. Except Fleur--and she would have other things to think
of!</p>

<p>The car turned down the last low hill to the level of the river.
He caught a glimpse of it flowing dark between the poplars, like the
soul of England, running hidden. The car rolled into the drive, and
stopped before the door. He shouldn't tell Annette yet about this
case coming into Court--she wouldn't feel as he did--she had no
nerves!</p>

<br>


<h2>CATECHISM</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar's marriage was fixed for the day of the Easter
Recess; her honeymoon to Lugano; her trousseau with Clothilde; her
residence in Eaton Square; her pin-money at two thousand a year; and
her affections on nobody. When she received a telephone message:
Would she come to breakfast at Shropshire House? she was surprised.
What could be the matter with the old boy?</p>

<p>At five minutes past nine, however, on the following day she
entered the ancestral precincts, having left almost all powder and
pigment on her dressing-table. Was he going to disapprove of her
marriage? Or to give her some of her grandmother's lace, which was
only fit to be in a museum?</p>

<p>The marquess was reading the paper in front of an electric fire.
He bent on her his bright, shrewd glance.</p>

<p>"Well, Marjorie? Shall we sit down, or do you like to breakfast
standing? There's porridge, scrambled eggs, fish--ah! and
grapefruit--very considerate of them! Pour out the coffee, will
you?"</p>

<p>"What'll you have, Grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I'll roam about and peck a bit. So you're going to be
married. Is that fortunate?"</p>

<p>"People say so."</p>

<p>"He's in Parliament, I see. Do you think you could interest him in
this Electricity Bill of Parsham's?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes. He's dead keen on electricity."</p>

<p>"Sensible man. He's got Works, I suppose. Are they
electrified?"</p>

<p>"I expect so."</p>

<p>The marquess gave her another glance.</p>

<p>"You know nothing about it," he said. "But you're looking very
charming. What's this I hear of a libel?"</p>

<p>She might have known! Grandfather was too frightfully spry! He
missed nothing!</p>

<p>"It wouldn't interest you, dear."</p>

<p>"I disagree. My father and <i>old</i> Sir Lawrence Mont were great
friends. Why do you want to wash linen in Court?"</p>

<p>"I don't."</p>

<p>"Are you the plaintiff?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What do you complain of?"</p>

<p>"They've said things about me."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Fleur Mont and her father."</p>

<p>"Ah! the relation of the tea-man. What have they said?"</p>

<p>"That I haven't a moral about me."</p>

<p>"Well, have you?"</p>

<p>"As much as most people."</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"That I'm a snake of the first water."</p>

<p>"I don't like that. What made them say so?"</p>

<p>"Only that I was heard calling her a snob; and so she is."</p>

<p>The marquess, who had resigned a finished grapefruit, placed his
foot on a chair, his elbow on his knee, his chin on his hand, and
said:</p>

<p>"No divinity hedges our Order in these days, Marjorie; but we
still stand for something. It's a mistake to forget that."</p>

<p>She sat very still. Everybody respected grandfather; even her
father, to whom he did not speak. But to be told that she stood for
something was really too dull for anything! All very well for
grandfather at his age, and with his lack of temptations! Besides,
<i>she</i> had no handle to her name, owing to the vaunted nature of
British institutions. Even if she felt that--by Lord Charles out of
Lady Ursula--she ought not to be dictated to, she had never put on
frills--had always liked to be thought a mere Bohemian. And, after
all, she did stand--for not being stuffy, and not being dull.</p>

<p>"Well, Grandfather, I tried to make it up, but she wouldn't.
Coffee?"</p>

<p>"Yes, coffee. But tell me, are you happy about yourself?"</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar handed him the cup. "No. Who is?"</p>

<p>"A hit," said the marquess. "You're going to be very well off, I
hear. That means power. It's worth using well, Marjorie. He's a
Scotsman, isn't he? Do you like him?" Again the shrewd bright
glance.</p>

<p>"At times."</p>

<p>"I see. With your hair, you must be careful. Red hair is
extraordinarily valuable on occasion. In the Eton and Harrow Match,
or for speaking after dinner; but don't let it run away with you
after you're married. Where are you going to live?"</p>

<p>"In Eaton Square. There's a Scotch place, too."</p>

<p>"Have your kitchens electrified. I've had it done here. It saves
the cook's temper. I get very equable food. But about this libel.
Can't you all say you're sorry--why put money into the lawyers'
pockets?"</p>

<p>"She won't, unless I do, and I won't, unless she does."</p>

<p>The marquess drank off his coffee.</p>

<p>"Then what is there in the way? I dislike publicity, Marjorie.
Look at that suit the other day. Anything of this nature in Society,
nowadays, is a nail in our coffins."</p>

<p>"I'll speak to Alec, if you like."</p>

<p>"Do! Has he red hair?"</p>

<p>"No; black."</p>

<p>"Ah! What would you like for a wedding-present--lace?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, please, dear. Nobody's wearing lace."</p>

<p>With his head on one side, the marquess looked at her. "I can't
get that lace off," he seemed to say.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd like a Colliery. Electrified, it would pay in no
time."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar laughed. "I know you're hard up, Grandfather; but
I'd rather not have a Colliery, thanks. They're so expensive. Just
give me your blessing."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said the marquess, "if I could sell blessings? Your
uncle Dangerfield has gone in for farming; he's ruining me. If only
he'd grow wheat by electricity; it's the only way to make it pay at
the present price. Well, if you've finished breakfast, good-bye. I
must go to work."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar, who had indeed begun breakfast, stood up and
pressed his hand. He was a dear old boy, if somewhat rapid! . . .</p>

<p>That same evening, in a box at the St. Anthony, she had her
opportunity, when MacGown was telling her of Soames' visit.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Why on earth didn't you settle it, Alec? The whole
thing's a bore. I've had my grandfather at me about it."</p>

<p>"If they'll apologise," said MacGown, "I'll settle it to-morrow.
But an apology they must make."</p>

<p>"And what about me? I don't want to stand up to be shot at."</p>

<p>"There are some things one can't sit down under, Marjorie. Their
whole conduct has been infamous."</p>

<p>Visited by a reckless impulse, she said:</p>

<p>"What d'you suppose I'm realty like, Alec?"</p>

<p>MacGown put his hand on her bare arm.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose; I know."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Defiant."</p>

<p>Curious summary! Strangely good in a way--only--!</p>

<p>"You mean that I like to irritate people till they think I'm--what
I'm not. But suppose"--her eyes confronted his--"I really am."</p>

<p>MacGown's grasp tightened.</p>

<p>"You're not; and I won't have it said."</p>

<p>"You think this case will whitewash my--defiance?"</p>

<p>"I know what gossip is; and I know it buzzes about you. People who
say things are going to be taught, once for all, that they
can't."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar turned her gaze towards the still life on the
dropped curtain, laughed and said:</p>

<p>"My dear man, you're dangerously provincial."</p>

<p>"I know a straight line when I see one."</p>

<p>"Yes; but there aren't any in London. You'd better hedge, Alec, or
you'll be taking a toss over me."</p>

<p>MacGown said, simply: "I believe in you more than you believe in
yourself."</p>

<p>She was glad that the curtain rose just then, for she felt
confused and rather touched.</p>

<p>Instead of confirming her desire to drop the case, that little
talk gave her a feeling that by the case her marriage stood or fell.
Alec would know where he was when it was over, and so would she!
There would be precious little secret about her and she would either
not be married to him, or at least not married under false pretences.
Let it rip! It was, however, a terrible bore; especially the
preparatory legal catechism she had now to undergo. What effect, for
instance, had been produced among her friends and acquaintances by
those letters? From the point of view of winning, the question was
obviously not without importance. But how was she to tell? Two
hostesses had cancelled week-end invitations: a rather prim Countess,
and a Canadian millionairess married to a decaying baronet. It had
not occurred to her before that this was the reason, but it might
have been. Apart from them she would have to say she didn't know,
people didn't tell you to your face what they heard or thought of
you. They were going to try and make her out a piece of injured
innocence! Good Lord! What if she declared her real faith in Court,
and left them all in the soup! Her real faith--what was it? Not to
let a friend down; not to give a man away; not to funk; to do things
differently from other people; to be always on the go; not to be
'stuffy'; not to be dull! The whole thing was topsy-turvy! Well, she
must keep her head!</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="C305">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>THE DAY</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>On the day of the case Soames rose, in Green Street, with a sort
of sick impatience. Why wasn't it the day after!</p>

<p>Renewed interviews with very young Nicholas and Sir James
Foskisson had confirmed the idea of defence by attack on modern
morality. Foskisson was evidently going to put his heart into
that--perhaps he'd suffered from it; and if he was anything like old
Bobstay, who had just published his reminiscences at the age of
eighty-two, that cat would lose her hair and give herself away.
Yesterday afternoon Soames had taken an hour's look at Mr. Justice
Brane, and been very favourably impressed; the learned judge, though
younger than himself--he had often briefed him in other times--looked
old-fashioned enough now for anything.</p>

<p>Having cleaned his teeth, put in his plate, and brushed his hair,
Soames went into the adjoining room and told Annette she would be
late. She always looked terribly young and well in bed, and this,
though a satisfaction to him, he could never quite forgive. When he
was gone, fifteen years hence, perhaps, she would still be under
sixty, and might live another twenty years.</p>

<p>Having roused her sufficiently to say: "You will have plenty of
time to be fussy in that Court, Soames," he went back and looked out
of his window. The air smelled of Spring--aggravating! He bathed and
shaved with care--didn't want to go into the Box with a cut on his
chin!--then went back to see that Annette was not putting on anything
bright. He found her in pink underclothes.</p>

<p>"I should wear black," he said. Annette regarded him above her
hand-mirror. "Whom do you want me to fascinate, Soames?"</p>

<p>"These people will bring their friends, I shouldn't wonder;
anything conspicuous--"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid; I shall not try to be younger than my
daughter."</p>

<p>Soames went out again. The French! Well, she had good taste in
dress.</p>

<p>After breakfast he went off to Fleur's. Winifred and Imogen would
look after Annette--they too were going to the Court--as if there
were anything to enjoy about this business!</p>

<p>Spruce in his silk hat, he walked across the Green Park, conning
over his evidence. No buds on the trees--a late year; and the Royal
Family out of town! Passing the Palace, he thought: 'They're very
popular!' He supposed they liked this great Empire group in front of
them, all muscle and flesh and large animals! The Albert Memorial,
and this--everybody ran them down; but, after all, peace and
plenty--nothing modern about them! Emerging into Westminster, he cut
his way through a smell of fried fish into the Parliamentary
backwater of North Street, and, between its pleasant little houses,
gazed steadily at the Wren Church. Never going inside any church
except St. Paul's, he derived a sort of strength from their
outsides--churches were solid and stood back, and didn't seem to care
what people thought of them! He felt a little better, rounding into
South Square. The Dandie met him in the hall. Though he was not over
fond of dogs, the breadth and solidity of this one always affected
Soames pleasurably--better than that little Chinese abortion they
used to have! This dog was a character--masterful and tenacious--you
would get very little out of <i>him</i> in a witness-box! Looking up
from the dog, he saw Michael and Fleur coming down the stairs. After
hurriedly inspecting Michael's brown suit and speckled tie, his eyes
came to anchor on his daughter's face. Pale but creamy, nothing
modern--thank goodness!--no rouge, salve, powder, or eye-blacking;
perfectly made up for her part! In a blue dress, too, very good
taste, which must have taken some finding! The desire that she should
not feel nervous stilled Soames' private qualms.</p>

<p>"Quite a smell of Spring!" he said: "Shall we start?"</p>

<p>While a cab was being summoned, he tried to put her at ease.</p>

<p>"I had a look at Brane yesterday; he's changed a good deal from
when I used to know him. I was one of the first to give him
briefs."</p>

<p>"That's bad, isn't it, sir?" said Michael.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"He'll be afraid of being thought grateful."</p>

<p>Flippant, as usual!</p>

<p>"Our judges," he said, "are a good lot, take them all round."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they are. Do you know if he ever reads, sir?"</p>

<p>"How d'you mean--reads?"</p>

<p>"Fiction. We don't, in Parliament."</p>

<p>"Nobody reads novels, except women," said Soames. And he felt
Fleur's dress. "You'll want a fur; that's flimsy."</p>

<p>While she was getting the fur, he said to Michael: "How did she
sleep?"</p>

<p>"Better than I did, sir."</p>

<p>"That's a comfort, anyway. Here's the cab. Keep away from that
Scotchman."</p>

<p>"I see him every day in the House, you know."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Soames; "I forgot. You make nothing of that sort of
thing there, I believe." And taking his daughter's arm, he led her
forth.</p>

<p>"I wonder if old Blythe will turn up," he heard Michael say, when
they passed the office of <i>The Outpost.</i> It was the first remark
made in the cab, and, calling for no response, it was the last.</p>

<p>The Law Courts had their customary air, and people, in black and
blue, were hurrying into them. "Beetletrap!" muttered Michael. Soames
rejected the simile with his elbow--for him they were just familiar
echoing space, concealed staircases, stuffy corridors, and the square
enclosures of one voice at a time.</p>

<p>Too early, they went slowly up the stairs. Really, it was
weak-minded! Here they had come--they and the other side--to
get--what? He was amazed at himself for not having insisted on
Fleur's apologising. Time and again in the case of others, all this
had appeared quite natural--in the case of his own daughter, it now
seemed almost incredibly idiotic. He hurried her on, however, past
lingering lawyers' clerks, witnesses, what not. A few low words to an
usher, and they were inside, and sitting down. Very young Nicholas
was already in his place, and Soames so adjusted himself that there
would only be the thickness of Sir James, when he materialised,
between them. Turning to confer, he lived for a cosey moment in the
past again, as might some retired old cricketer taking block once
more. Beyond young Nicholas he quartered the assemblage with his
glance. Yes, people had got wind of it! He knew they would--with that
cat always in the public eye--quite a lot of furbelows up there at
the back, and more coming. He reversed himself abruptly; the Jury
were filing in--special, but a common-looking lot! Why were juries
always common-looking? He had never been on one himself. He glanced
at Fleur. There she sat, and what she was feeling he couldn't tell.
As for young Michael, his ears looked very pointed. And just then he
caught sight of Annette. She'd better not come and sit down here,
after all--the more there were of them in front, the more conspicuous
it would be! So he shook his head at her, and waved towards the back.
Ah! She was going! She and Winifred and Imogen would take up
room--all rather broad in the beam; but there were still gaps up
there. And suddenly he saw the plaintiff and her lawyer and MacGown;
very spry they looked, and that insolent cat was smiling! Careful not
to glance in their direction, Soames saw them sit down, some six feet
off. Ah! and here came Counsel--Foskisson and Bullfry together, thick
as thieves. They'd soon be calling each other 'my friend' now, and
cutting each other's throats! He wondered if he wouldn't have done
better after all to have let the other side have Foskisson, and
briefed Bullfry--an ugly-looking customer, broad, competent and
leathery. He and Michael with Fleur between them, and
behind--Foskisson and his junior; Settlewhite and the Scotchman with
'that cat' between them, and behind--Bullfry and his junior! Only the
Judge wanted now to complete the pattern! And here he came! Soames
gripped Fleur's arm and raised her with himself. Bob! Down again! One
side of Brane's face seemed a little fuller than the other; Soames
wondered if he had toothache, and how it would affect the
proceedings.</p>

<p>And now came the usual 'shivaree' about such and such a case, and
what would be taken next week, and so on. Well! that was over, and
the judge was turning his head this way and that, as if to see where
the field was placed. Now Bullfry was up:</p>

<p>"If it please Your Lordship--"</p>

<p>He was making the usual opening, with the usual flowery
description of the plaintiff--granddaughter of a marquess, engaged to
a future Prime Minister . . . or so you'd think! . . . prominent in
the most brilliant circles, high-spirited, perhaps a thought too
high-spirited. . . . Baggage! . . . the usual smooth and sub-acid
description of the defendant! . . . Rich and ambitious young married
lady. . . . Impudent beggar! . . . Jury would bear in mind that they
were dealing in both cases with members of advanced Society, but they
would bear in mind, too, that primary words had primary meanings and
consequences, whatever the Society in which they were uttered. H'm!
Very sketchy reference to the incident in Fleur's
drawing-room--minimised, of course--ha! an allusion to himself--man
of property and standing--thank you for nothing! Reading the
libellous letters now! Effect of them . . . very made-up, all that! .
. . Plaintiff obliged to take action. . . . Bunkum! "I shall now call
Mrs. Ralph Ppynrryn."</p>

<p>"How do you spell that name, Mr. Bullfry?"</p>

<p>"With two p's, two y's, two n's and two r's, my lord."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>Soames looked at the owner of the name. Good-looking woman of the
flibberty-gibbet type! He listened to her evidence with close
attention. Her account of the incident in Fleur's drawing-room seemed
substantially correct. She had received the libellous letter two days
later; had thought it her duty, as a friend, to inform Miss Ferrar.
Should say, as a woman in Society, that this incident and these
letters had done Miss Ferrar harm. Had talked it over with a good
many people. A public incident. Much feeling excited. Had shown her
letter to Mrs. Maltese, and been shown one that she had received.
Whole matter had become current gossip. H'm!</p>

<p>Bullfry down, and Foskisson up!</p>

<p>Soames adjusted himself. Now to see how the fellow shaped--the
manner of a cross-examiner was so important! Well, he had seen
worse--the eye, like frozen light, fixed on unoccupied space while
the question was being asked, and coming round on to the witness for
the answer; the mouth a little open, as if to swallow it; the tongue
visible at times on the lower lip, the unoccupied hand clasping
something under the gown behind.</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs.--er--Ppynrryn. This incident, as my friend has called
it, happened at the house of Mrs. Mont, did it not? And how did you
come there? As a friend. Quite so! And you have nothing against Mrs.
Mont? No. And you thought it advisable and kind, madam, to show this
letter to the plaintiff and to other people--in fact, to foment this
little incident to the best of your ability?" Eyes round!</p>

<p>"If a friend of mine received such a letter about me, I should
expect her to tell me that the writer was going about abusing
me."</p>

<p>"Even if your friend knew of the provocation and was also a friend
of the letter-writer?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Now, madam, wasn't it simply that the sensation of this little
quarrel was too precious to be burked? It would have been so easy,
wouldn't it, to have torn the letter up and said nothing about it?
You don't mean to suggest that it made you think any the worse of
Miss Ferrar--you knew her too well, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es."</p>

<p>"Exactly. As a friend of both parties you knew that these
expressions were just spleen and not to be taken seriously."</p>

<p>"I can't say that."</p>

<p>"Oh! You regarded them as serious? Am I to take it that you
thought they touched the ham-bone? In other words, that they were
true?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"Could they do Miss Ferrar any harm if they were palpably
untrue?"</p>

<p>"I think they could."</p>

<p>"Not with you--you were a friend?"</p>

<p>"Not with me."</p>

<p>"But with other people, who would never have heard of them but for
you. In fact, madam, you enjoyed the whole thing. Did you?"</p>

<p>"Enjoyed? No."</p>

<p>"You regarded it as your duty to spread this letter? Don't you
enjoy doing your duty?"</p>

<p>The dry cackle within Soames stopped at his lips.</p>

<p>Foskisson down, and Bullfry up!</p>

<p>"It is, in fact, your experience, Mrs. Ppynrryn, as well as that
of most of us not so well constituted, perhaps, as my learned friend,
that duty is sometimes painful."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Mrs. Edward Maltese."</p>

<p>During the examination of this other young woman, who seemed to be
dark and solid, Soames tried to estimate the comparative effect
produced by Fleur and 'that cat' on the four jurymen whose eyes
seemed to stray towards beauty. He had come to no definite
conclusion, when Sir James Foskisson rose to cross-examine.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mrs. Maltese, which do you consider the most serious
allegation among those complained of?"</p>

<p>"The word 'treacherous' in my letter, and the expression 'a snake
of the first water' in the letter to Mrs. Ppynrryn."</p>

<p>"More serious than the others?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That is where you can help me, madam. The circle you move in is
not exactly the plaintiff's, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly."</p>

<p>"Intersecting, um?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Now, in which section, yours or the plaintiff's, would you say
the expression 'she hasn't a moral about her' would be the more, or
shall we say the less, damning?"</p>

<p>"I can't say."</p>

<p>"I only want your opinion. Do you think your section of Society as
advanced as Miss Ferrar's?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not."</p>

<p>"It's well known, isn't it, that her circle is very free and
easy?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Still, <i>your</i> section is pretty advanced--I mean, you're not
'stuffy'?"</p>

<p>"Not what, Sir James?"</p>

<p>"Stuffy, my lord; it's an expression a good deal used in modern
Society."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"Strait-laced, my lord."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, he's asking you if you're stuffy?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord. I hope not."</p>

<p>"You hope not. Go on, Sir James."</p>

<p>"Not being stuffy, you wouldn't be exactly worried if somebody
said to you: 'My dear, you haven't a moral about you'?"</p>

<p>"Not if it was said as charmingly as that."</p>

<p>"Now come, Mrs. Maltese, does such an expression, said charmingly
or the reverse, convey any blame to you or to your friends?"</p>

<p>"If the reverse, yes."</p>

<p>"Am I to take it that the conception of morality in your circle is
the same as in--my lord's?"</p>

<p>"How is the witness to answer that, Sir James?"</p>

<p>"Well, in your circle are you shocked when your friends are
divorced, or when they go off together for a week in Paris, say, or
wherever they find convenient?"</p>

<p>"Shocked? Well, I suppose one needn't be shocked by what one
wouldn't do oneself."</p>

<p>"In fact, you're not shocked?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I'm shocked by anything."</p>

<p>"That would be being stuffy, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Well, will you tell me then--if that's the state of mind in your
circle; and you said, you know, that your circle is less free and
easy than the plaintiff's--how it is possible that such words as 'she
hasn't a moral about her' can have done the plaintiff any harm?"</p>

<p>"The whole world isn't in our circles."</p>

<p>"No. I suggest that only a very small portion of the world is in
your circles. But do you tell me that you or the plaintiff pay
any--?"</p>

<p>"How can she tell, Sir James, what the plaintiff pays?"</p>

<p>"That <i>you,</i> then, pay any attention to what people outside
your circle think?"</p>

<p>Soames moved his head twice. The fellow was doing it well. And his
eye caught Fleur's face turned towards the witness; a little smile
was curling her lip.</p>

<p>"I don't personally pay much attention even to what anybody
<i>in</i> my circle thinks."</p>

<p>"Have you more independence of character than the plaintiff,
should you say?"</p>

<p>"I dare say I've got as much."</p>

<p>"Is she notoriously independent?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Maltese."</p>

<p>Foskisson down, Bullfry up!</p>

<p>"I call the plaintiff, my lord."</p>

<p>Soames uncrossed his legs.</p>

<h2><a name="C306">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>IN THE BOX</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar stepped into the Box, not exactly nervous, and
only just 'made-up.' The papers would record a black costume with
chinchilla fur and a black hat. She kissed the air in front of the
book, took a deep breath, and turned to Mr. Bullfry.</p>

<p>For the last five days she had resented more and more the way this
case had taken charge of her. She had initiated it, and it had
completely deprived her of initiative. She had, in fact, made the old
discovery, that when the machinery of quarrel is once put in motion,
much more than pressure of the starting button is required to stop
its revolutions. She was feeling that it would serve Alec and the
lawyers right if all went wrong.</p>

<p>The voice of Mr. Bullfry, carefully adjusted, soothed her. His
questions were familiar, and with each answer her confidence
increased, her voice sounded clear and pleasant in her ears. And she
stood at ease, making her figure as boyish as she could. Her
performance, she felt, was interesting to the judge, the jury, and
all those people up there, whom she could dimly see. If only 'that
little snob' had not been seated, expressionless, between her and her
Counsel! When at length Mr. Bullfry sat down and Sir James Foskisson
got up, she almost succumbed to the longing to powder her nose.
Clasping the Box, she resisted it, and while he turned his papers,
and hitched his gown, the first tremor of the morning passed down her
spine. At least he might look at her when he spoke!</p>

<p>"Have you ever been party to an action before, Miss Ferrar?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You quite understand, don't you, that you are on your oath?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"You have told my friend that you had no animus against Mrs. Mont.
Look at this marked paragraph in <i>The Evening Sun</i> of October
3rd. Did you write that?"</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar felt exactly as if she had stepped out of a
conservatory into an East wind. Did they know everything, then?</p>

<p>"Yes; I wrote it."</p>

<p>"It ends thus: 'The enterprising little lady is losing no chance
of building up her <i>salon</i> on the curiosity which ever surrounds
any buccaneering in politics.' Is the reference to Mrs. Mont?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Not very nice, is it--of a friend?"</p>

<p>"I don't see any harm in it."</p>

<p>"The sort of thing, in fact, you'd like written about
yourself?"</p>

<p>"The sort of thing I should expect if I were doing the same
thing."</p>

<p>"That's not quite an answer, but let me put it like this: The sort
of thing your father would like to read about you, is it?"</p>

<p>"My father would never read that column."</p>

<p>"Then it surprises you to hear that Mrs. Mont's father did? Do you
write many of these cheery little paragraphs about your friends?"</p>

<p>"Not many."</p>

<p>"Every now and then, eh? And do they remain your friends?"</p>

<p>"It's not easy in Society to tell who's a friend and who
isn't."</p>

<p>"I quite agree, Miss Ferrar. You have admitted making one or two
critical--that was your word, I think--remarks concerning Mrs. Mont,
in her own house. Do you go to many houses and talk disparagingly of
your hostess?"</p>

<p>"No; and in any case I don't expect to be eavesdropped."</p>

<p>"I see; so long as you're not found out, it's all right, eh? Now,
on this first Wednesday in October last, at Mrs. Mont's, in speaking
to this gentleman, Mr. Philip--er--Quinsey, did you use the word
'snob' of your hostess?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Be careful. You heard the evidence of Mrs. Ppynrryn and Mrs.
Maltese. Mrs. Maltese said, you remember, that Mr. Forsyte--that is
Mrs. Mont's father--said to you on that occasion: 'You called my
daughter a snob in her own house, madam--be so kind as to withdraw;
you are a traitress.' Is that a correct version?"</p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>"Do you suggest that he invented the word 'snob'?"</p>

<p>"I suggest he was mistaken."</p>

<p>"Not a nice word, is it--'snob'? Was there any other reason why he
should call you a traitress?"</p>

<p>"My remarks weren't meant for his ears. I don't remember exactly
what I said."</p>

<p>"Well, we shall have Mr. Forsyte in the box to refresh your memory
as to exactly what you said. But I put it to you that you called her
a snob, not once but twice, during that little conversation?"</p>

<p>"I've told you I don't remember; he shouldn't have listened."</p>

<p>"Very well! So you feel quite happy about having written that
paragraph and said nasty things of Mrs. Mont behind her back in her
own drawing-room?"</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar grasped the Box till the blood tingled in her
palms. His voice was maddening.</p>

<p>"Yet it seems, Miss Ferrar, that you object to others saying nasty
things about you in return. Who advised you to bring this
action?"</p>

<p>"My father first; and then my <i>fianc&eacute;."</i></p>

<p>"Sir Alexander MacGown. Does he move in the same circles as
you?"</p>

<p>"No; he moves in Parliamentary circles."</p>

<p>"Exactly; and he wouldn't know, would he, the canons of conduct
that rule in your circle?"</p>

<p>"There are no circles so definite as that."</p>

<p>"Always willing to learn, Miss Ferrar. But tell me, do you know
what Sir Alexander's Parliamentary friends think about conduct and
morality?"</p>

<p>"I can guess. I don't suppose there's much difference."</p>

<p>"Are you suggesting, Miss Ferrar, that responsible public men take
the same light-hearted view of conduct and morals as you?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you rather assuming, Sir James, that her view <i>is</i>
light-hearted?"</p>

<p>"As to conduct, my lord, I submit that her answers have shown the
very light-hearted view she takes of the obligations incurred by the
acceptance of hospitality, for instance. I'm coming to morals
now."</p>

<p>"I think you'd better, before drawing your conclusions. What have
public men to do with it?"</p>

<p>"I'm suggesting, my lord, that this lady is making a great to-do
about words which a public man, or any ordinary citizen, would have a
perfect right to resent, but which she, with her views, has no right
whatever to resent."</p>

<p>"You must prove her views then. Go on!"</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar, relaxed for a moment, gathered herself again. Her
views!</p>

<p>"Tell me, Miss Ferrar--we all know now the meaning of the word
'stuffy'--are public men 'stuffier' than you?"</p>

<p>"They may say they are."</p>

<p>"You think them hypocrites?"</p>

<p>"I don't think anything at all about them."</p>

<p>"Though you're going to marry one? You are complaining of the
words: 'She hasn't a moral about her.' Have you read this novel
'Can-thar'?" He was holding up a book.</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Don't you know?"</p>

<p>"I've skimmed it."</p>

<p>"Taken off the cream, eh? Read it sufficiently to form an
opinion?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Would you agree with the view of it expressed in this letter to a
journal? 'The book breaks through the British "stuffiness," which
condemns any frank work of art--and a good thing too!' It is a good
thing?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I hate Grundyism."</p>

<p>"'It is undoubtedly Literature.' The word is written with a large
L. Should you say it was?"</p>

<p>"Literature--yes. Not great literature, perhaps."</p>

<p>"But it ought to be published?"</p>

<p>"I don't see why not."</p>

<p>"You know that it is not published in England?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But it ought to be?"</p>

<p>"It isn't everybody's sort of book, of course."</p>

<p>"Don't evade the question, please. In your opinion ought this
novel 'Canthar' to be published in England? . . . Take your time,
Miss Ferrar."</p>

<p>The brute lost nothing! Just because she had hesitated a moment
trying to see where he was leading her.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think literature should be free."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't sympathise with its suppression, if it were
published?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't approve of the suppression of any book on the ground
of mere morals?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you unless I see the book. People aren't bound to
read books, you know."</p>

<p>"And you think your opinion generally on this subject is that of
public men and ordinary citizens?"</p>

<p>"No; I suppose it isn't."</p>

<p>"But your view would be shared by most of your own
associates?"</p>

<p>"I should hope so."</p>

<p>"A contrary opinion would be 'stuffy,' wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"If you like to call it so. It's not my word."</p>

<p>"What is your word, Miss Ferrar?"</p>

<p>"I think I generally say 'ga-ga.'"</p>

<p>"Do you know, I'm afraid the Court will require a little
elaboration of that."</p>

<p>"Not for me, Sir James; I'm perfectly familiar with the word; it
means 'in your dotage.'"</p>

<p>"The Bench is omniscient, my lord. Then any one, Miss Ferrar, who
didn't share the opinion of yourself and your associates in the
matter of this book would be 'ga-ga,' that is to say, in his or her
dotage?"</p>

<p>"Aesthetically."</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought we should arrive at that word. You, I suppose,
don't connect art with life?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Don't think it has any effect on life?"</p>

<p>"It oughtn't to."</p>

<p>"When a man's theme in a book is extreme incontinence, depicted
with all due emphasis, that wouldn't have any practical effect on his
readers, however young?"</p>

<p>"I can't say about other people, it wouldn't have any effect on
me."</p>

<p>"You are emancipated, in fact."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by that."</p>

<p>"Isn't what you are saying about the divorce of art from life the
merest claptrap; and don't you know it?"</p>

<p>"I certainly don't."</p>

<p>"Let me put it another way: Is it possible for those who believe
in current morality, to hold your view that art has no effect on
life?"</p>

<p>"Quite possible; if they are cultured."</p>

<p>"Cultured! Do you believe in current morality yourself?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you call current morality."</p>

<p>"I will tell you, Miss Ferrar. I should say, for instance, it was
current morality that women should not have <i>liaisons</i> before
they're married, and should not have them after."</p>

<p>"What about men?"</p>

<p>"Thank you; I was coming to men. And that men should at least not
have them after."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't say that was <i>current</i> morality at all."</p>

<p>In yielding to that satiric impulse she knew at once she had made
a mistake--the judge had turned his face towards her. He was
speaking.</p>

<p>"Do I understand you to imply that in your view it is moral for
women to have <i>liaisons</i> before marriage, and for men and women
to have them after?"</p>

<p>"I think it's current morality, my lord."</p>

<p>"I'm not asking you about current morality; I'm asking whether in
<i>your</i> view it is moral?"</p>

<p>"I think many people think it's all right, who don't say it,
yet."</p>

<p>She was conscious of movement throughout the jury; and of a little
flump in the well of the Court. Sir Alexander had dropped his hat.
The sound of a nose being loudly blown broke the stillness; the face
of Bullfry K. C. was lost to her view. She felt the blood mounting in
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Answer my question, please. Do <i>you</i> say it's all
right?"</p>

<p>"I--I think it depends."</p>

<p>"On what?"</p>

<p>"On--on circumstances, environment, temperament; all sorts of
things."</p>

<p>"Would it be all right for you?"</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar became very still. "I can't answer that question,
my lord."</p>

<p>"You mean--you don't want to?"</p>

<p>"I mean I don't know."</p>

<p>And, with a feeling as if she had withdrawn her foot from a bit of
breaking ice, she saw Bullfry's face re-emerge from his
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Very well. Go on, Sir James!"</p>

<p>"Anyway, we may take it, Miss Ferrar, that those of us who say we
don't believe in these irregularities are hypocrites in your
view?"</p>

<p>"Why can't you be fair?"</p>

<p>He was looking at her now; and she didn't like him any the better
for it.</p>

<p>"I shall prove myself fair before I've done, Miss Ferrar."</p>

<p>"You've got your work cut out, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Believe me, madam, it will be better for you not to indulge in
witticism. According to you, there is no harm in a book like
'Canthar'?"</p>

<p>"There ought to be none."</p>

<p>"You mean if we were all as aesthetically cultured--as
you."--Sneering beast!--"But are we?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then there is harm. But you wouldn't mind its being done. I don't
propose, my lord, to read from this extremely unpleasant novel. Owing
apparently to its unsavoury reputation, a copy of it now costs nearly
seven pounds. And I venture to think that is in itself an answer to
the plaintiff's contention that 'art' so called has no effect on
life. We have gone to the considerable expense of buying copies, and
I shall ask that during the luncheon interval the jury may read some
dozen marked passages."</p>

<p>"Have you a copy for me, Sir James?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"And one for Mr. Bullfry? . . . If there is any laughter, I shall
have the Court cleared. Go on."</p>

<p>"You know the 'Ne Plus Ultra' Play-Producing Society, Miss Ferrar?
It exists to produce advanced plays, I believe."</p>

<p>"Plays--I don't know about 'advanced.'"</p>

<p>"Russian plays, and the Restoration dramatists?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you have played in them?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes."</p>

<p>"Do you remember a play called 'The Plain Dealer,' by Wycherley,
given at a matinee on January 7th last--did you play in that the part
of Olivia?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A nice part?"</p>

<p>"A very good part?"</p>

<p>"I said 'nice.'"</p>

<p>"I don't like the word."</p>

<p>"Too suggestive of 'prunes and prisms,' Miss Ferrar? Is it the
part of a modest woman?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is it, toward the end, extremely immodest? I allude to the dark
scene."</p>

<p>"I don't know about extremely."</p>

<p>"Anyway, you felt no hesitation about undertaking and playing the
part--a little thing like that doesn't worry you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know why it should. If it did, I shouldn't act."</p>

<p>"You don't act for money?"</p>

<p>"No; for pleasure."</p>

<p>"Then, of course, you can refuse any part you like?"</p>

<p>"If I did, I shouldn't have any offered me."</p>

<p>"Don't quibble, please. You took the part of Olivia not for money
but for pleasure. You enjoyed playing it?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I shall have to ask the jury, my lord, to run their
eyes over the dark scene in 'The Plain Dealer.'"</p>

<p>"Are you saying, Sir James, that a woman who plays an immoral part
is not moral--that would asperse a great many excellent
reputations."</p>

<p>"No, my lord; I'm saying that here is a young lady so jealous of
her good name in the eyes of the world, that she brings a libel
action because some one has said in a private letter that she 'hasn't
a moral about her.' And at the same time she is reading and approving
books like this 'Canthar,' playing parts like that of Olivia in 'The
Plain Dealer,' and, as I submit, living in a section of Society that
really doesn't know the meaning of the word morals, that looks upon
morals, in fact, rather as we look upon measles. It's my contention,
my lord, that the saying in my client's letter: 'She hasn't a moral
about her,' is rather a compliment to the plaintiff than
otherwise."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that it was intended as a compliment?"</p>

<p>"No, no, my lord."</p>

<p>"Well, you want the jury to read that scene. You will have a busy
luncheon interval, gentlemen. Go on, Sir James."</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Ferrar--my friend made a point of the fact that you are
engaged to a wealthy and highly respected Member of Parliament. How
long have you been engaged to him?"</p>

<p>"Six months."</p>

<p>"You have no secrets from him, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Why should I answer that?"</p>

<p>"Why should she, Sir James?"</p>

<p>"I am quite content to leave it at her reluctance, my lord."</p>

<p>Sneering brute! As if everybody hadn't secrets from everybody!</p>

<p>"Your engagement was not made public till January, was it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"May I take it that you were not sure of your own mind till
then?"</p>

<p>"If you like."</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Ferrar, did you bring this action because of your good
name? Wasn't it because you were hard up?"</p>

<p>She was conscious again of blood in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p><i>"Were</i> you hard up when you brought it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very?"</p>

<p>"Not worse than I have been before."</p>

<p>"I put it to you that you owed a great deal of money, and were
hard pressed."</p>

<p>"If you like."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've admitted that, Miss Ferrar; otherwise I should
have had to prove it. And you didn't bring this action with a view to
paying some of your debts?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Did you in early January become aware that you were not likely to
get any sum in settlement of this suit?"</p>

<p>"I believe I was told that an offer was withdrawn."</p>

<p>"And do you know why?"</p>

<p>"Yes; because Mrs. Mont wouldn't give the apology I asked
for."</p>

<p>"Exactly! And was it a coincidence that you thereupon made up your
mind to marry Sir Alexander MacGown?"</p>

<p>"A coincidence?"</p>

<p>"I mean the announcement of your engagement, you know?"</p>

<p>Brute!</p>

<p>"It had nothing to do with this case."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Now when you brought this action did you really care one
straw whether people thought you moral or not?"</p>

<p>"I brought it chiefly because I was called 'a snake.'"</p>

<p>"Please answer my question."</p>

<p>"It isn't so much what <i>I</i> cared, as what my friends
cared."</p>

<p>"But their view of morality is much what yours is--thoroughly
accommodating?"</p>

<p>"Not my <i>fianc&eacute;'s.</i></p>

<p>"Ah! no. He doesn't move in your circle, you said. But the rest of
your friends. You're not ashamed of your own accommodating
philosophy, are you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then why be ashamed of it for them?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell what <i>their</i> philosophy is?"</p>

<p>"How can she, Sir James?"</p>

<p>"As your lordship pleases. Now, Miss Ferrar! You like to stand up
for your views, I hope. Let me put your philosophy to you in a
nutshell: You believe, don't you, in the full expression of your
personality; it would be your duty, wouldn't it, to break through any
convention--I don't say law--but any so-called moral convention that
cramped you?"</p>

<p>"I never said I had a philosophy."</p>

<p>"Don't run away from it, please."</p>

<p>"I'm not in the habit of running away."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad of that. You believe in being the sole judge of your
own conduct?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You're not alone in that view, are you?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think so."</p>

<p>"It's the view, in fact, of what may be called the forward wing of
modern Society, isn't it--the wing you belong to, and are proud of
belonging to? And in that section of Society--so long as you don't
break the actual law--you think and do as you like, eh?"</p>

<p>"One doesn't always act up to one's principles."</p>

<p>"Quite so. But among your associates, even if you and they don't
always act up to it, it <i>is</i> a principle, isn't it, to judge for
yourselves and go your own ways without regard to convention?"</p>

<p>"More or less."</p>

<p>"And, living in that circle, with that belief, you have the
effrontery to think the words: 'She hasn't a moral about her,'
entitles you to damages?"</p>

<p>Her voice rang out angrily: "I have morals. They may not be yours,
but they may be just as good, perhaps better. I'm not a hypocrite,
anyway."</p>

<p>Again she saw him look at her, there was a gleam in his eyes; and
she knew she had made another mistake.</p>

<p>"We'll leave my morals out of the question, Miss Ferrar. But we'll
go a little further into what you say are yours. In your own words,
it should depend on temperament, circumstances, environment, whether
you conform to morality or not?"</p>

<p>She stood silent, biting her lip.</p>

<p>"Answer, please."</p>

<p>She inclined her head. "Yes."</p>

<p>"Very good!" He had paused, turning over his papers, and she drew
back in the box. She had lost her temper--had made him lose his; at
all costs she must keep her head now! In this moment of search for
her head she took in everything--expressions, gestures, even the
atmosphere--the curious dramatic emanation from a hundred and more
still faces; she noted the one lady juryman, the judge breaking the
nib of a quill, with his eyes turned away from it as if looking at
something that had run across the well of the Court. Yes, and down
there, the lengthening lip of Mr. Settlewhite, Michael's face turned
up at her with a rueful frown, Fleur Mont's mask with red spots in
the cheeks, Alec's clenched hands, and his eyes fixed on her. A sort
of comic intensity about it all! If only she were the size of Alice
in 'Wonderland,' and could take them all in her hands and shake them
like a pack of cards--so motionless, there, at her expense! That
sarcastic brute had finished fiddling with his papers, and she moved
forward again to attention in the Box.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Ferrar, his lordship put a general question to you
which you did not feel able to answer. I am going to put it in a way
that will be easier for you. Whether or no it was right for you to
have one"--she saw Michael's hand go up to his face--"have you <i>in
fact</i> had a--<i>liaison?"</i> And from some tone in his voice,
from the look on his face, she could tell for certain that he knew
she had.</p>

<p>With her back to the wall, she had not even a wall to her back.
Ten, twenty, thirty seconds--judge, jury, that old fox with his hand
under the tail of his gown, and his eyes averted! Why did she not
spit out the indignant: No! which she had so often rehearsed? Suppose
he proved it--as he had said he would prove her debts?</p>

<p>"Take your time, Miss Ferrar. You know what a <i>liaison</i> is,
of course."</p>

<p>Brute! On the verge of denial, she saw Michael lean across, and
heard his whisper: 'Stop this!' And then 'that little snob' looked up
at her--the scrutiny was knowing and contemptuous: 'Now hear her
lie!' it seemed to say. And she answered, quickly: "I consider your
question insulting."</p>

<p>"Oh! come, Miss Ferrar, after your own words! After what--"</p>

<p>"Well! I shan't answer it."</p>

<p>A rustle, a whispering in the Court.</p>

<p>"You won't answer it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Ferrar." Could a voice be more sarcastic?</p>

<p>The brute was sitting down.</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar stood defiant, with no ground under her feet. What
next? Her counsel was beckoning. She descended from the Box, and,
passing her adversaries, resumed her seat next her betrothed. How red
and still he was! She heard the judge say:</p>

<p>"I shall break for lunch now, Mr. Bullfry," saw him rise and go
out, and the jury getting up. The whispering and rustling in the
Court swelled to a buzz. She stood up. Mr. Settlewhite was speaking
to her.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="C307">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>'FED UP'</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Guided by him into a room designed to shelter witnesses, Marjorie
Ferrar looked at her lawyer.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"An unfortunate refusal, Miss Ferrar--very. I'm afraid the effect
on the jury may be fatal. If we can settle it now, I should certainly
say we'd better."</p>

<p>"It's all the same to me."</p>

<p>"In that case you may take it I shall settle. I'll go and see Sir
Alexander and Mr. Bullfry at once."</p>

<p>"How do I get out quietly?"</p>

<p>"Down those stairs. You'll find cabs in Lincoln's Inn Fields.
Excuse me," he made her a grave little bow and stalked away.</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar did not take a cab; she walked. If her last answer
had been fatal, on the whole she was content. She had told no lies to
speak of, had stood up to 'that sarcastic beast,' and given him
sometimes as good as she had got. Alec! Well, she couldn't help it!
He had insisted on her going into Court; she hoped he liked it now
she'd been! Buying a newspaper, she went into a restaurant and read a
description of herself, accompanied by a photograph. She ate a good
lunch, and then continued her walk along Piccadilly. Passing into the
Park, she sat down under a tree coming into bud, and drew the smoke
of a cigarette quietly into her lungs. The Row was almost deserted. A
few persons of little or no consequence occupied a few chairs. A
riding mistress was teaching a small boy to trot. Some sparrows and a
pigeon alone seemed to take a distant interest in her. The air
smelled of Spring. She sat some time with the pleasant feeling that
nobody in the world knew where she was. Odd, when you thought of
it--millions of people every day, leaving their houses, offices,
shops, on their way to the next place, were as lost to the world as
stones in a pond! Would it be nice to disappear permanently, and
taste life incognita? Bertie Curfew was going to Moscow again. Would
he take her as secretary, and <i>bonne amie?</i> Bertie Curfew--she
had only pretended to be tired of him! The thought brought her face
to face with the future. Alec! Explanations! It was hardly the word!
He had a list of her debts, and had said he would pay them as a
wedding-present. But--if there wasn't to be a wedding? Thank God, she
had some ready money. The carefully 'laid-up' four-year-old in her
father's stable had won yesterday. She had dribbled 'a pony' on at a
nice price. She rose and sauntered along, distending her bust--in
defiance of the boylike fashion, which, after all, was on the
wane--to take in the full of a sweet wind.</p>

<p>Leaving the Park, she came to South Kensington station and bought
another paper. It had a full account under the headlines: 'Modern
Morality Attacked.' 'Miss Marjorie Ferrar in the Box.' It seemed
funny to stand there reading those words among people who were
reading the same without knowing her from Eve, except, perhaps, by
her clothes. Continuing her progress towards Wren Street, she turned
her latch-key in the door, and saw a hat. Waiting for her already!
She took her time; and, pale from powder, as though she had gone
through much, entered the studio.</p>

<p>MacGown was sitting with his head in his hands. She felt real pity
for him--too strong, too square, too vital for that attitude! He
raised his face.</p>

<p>"Well, Alec!"</p>

<p>"Tell me the truth, Marjorie. I'm in torment."</p>

<p>She almost envied him the depth of his feeling, however
unreasonable after her warnings. But she said, ironically:</p>

<p>"Who was it knew me better than I knew myself?"</p>

<p>In the same dull voice he repeated:</p>

<p>"The truth, Marjorie, the truth!"</p>

<p>But why should she go into the confessional? Was he entitled to
her past? His rights stopped at her future. It was the old
business--men expecting more from women than they could give them.
Inequality of the sexes. Something in that, perhaps, in the old days
when women bore children, and men didn't; but now that women knew all
about sex and only bore children when they wanted to, and not always
even then, why should men be freer?</p>

<p>And she said, slowly: "In exchange for your adventures I'll tell
you mine."</p>

<p>"For God's sake don't mock me; I've had hell these last
hours."</p>

<p>His face showed it, and she said with feeling:</p>

<p>"I said you'd be taking a toss over me, Alec. Why on earth did you
insist on my bringing this case? You've had your way, and now you
don't like it."</p>

<p>"It's true, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why not?"</p>

<p>He uttered a groan, recoiling till his back was against the wall,
as if afraid of being loose in the room.</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no! That I can't possibly tell you. And how many affairs have
you had?"</p>

<p>He paid no attention. He wouldn't! He knew she didn't love him;
and such things only mattered if you loved! Ah! well! His agony was a
tribute to her, after all!</p>

<p>"You're well out of me," she said, sullenly; and, sitting down,
she lighted a cigarette. A scene! How hateful! Why didn't he go?
She'd rather he'd be violent than deaf and dumb and blind like
this.</p>

<p>"Not that American fellow?"</p>

<p>She could not help a laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, poor boy!"</p>

<p>"How long did it last?"</p>

<p>"Nearly a year."</p>

<p>"My God!"</p>

<p>He had rushed to the door. If only he would open it and go! That
he could feel so violently! That figure by the door was just not mad!
His stuffy passions!</p>

<p>And then he did pull the door open and was gone.</p>

<p>She threw herself at full length on the divan; not from lassitude,
exactly, nor despair--from a feeling rather as if nothing mattered.
How stupid and pre-war! Why couldn't he, like her, be free, be
supple, take life as it came? Passions, prejudices, principles,
pity--old-fashioned as the stuffy clothes worn when she was a tot.
Well! Good riddance! Fancy living in the same house, sharing the same
bed, with a man so full of the primitive that he could 'go off his
chump' with jealousy about her! Fancy living with a man who took life
so seriously that he couldn't even see himself doing it! Life was a
cigarette to be inhaled and thrown away, a dance to be danced out. On
with that dance! . . . Yes, but she couldn't let him pay her debts,
now, even if he wanted to. Married, she would have repaid him with
her body; as it was--no! Oh! why didn't some one die and leave her
something? What a bore it all was! And she lay still, listening to
the tea-time sounds of a quiet street--taxis rounding the corner from
the river; the dog next door barking at the postman; that one-legged
man--ex-Service--who came most afternoons and played on a poor
fiddle. He expected her shilling--unhappy fellow!--she'd have to get
up and give it him. She went to the little side window that looked on
to the street, and suddenly recoiled. Francis Wilmot in the doorway
with his hand up to the bell! Another scene! No, really! This was too
much! There went the bell! No time to say 'Not at home'! Well, let
them all come--round her past, like bees round a honey-pot!</p>

<p>"Mr. Francis Wilmot."</p>

<p>He stood there, large as the life he had nearly resigned--a little
thinner, that was all.</p>

<p>"Well, Francis," she said, "I thought you were 'through with that
fool business'?"</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot came gravely up and took her hand. "I sail
to-morrow."</p>

<p>Sail! Well, she could put up with that. He seemed to her just a
thin, pale young man with dark hair and eyes and no juices in his
system.</p>

<p>"I read the evening papers. I wondered if, perhaps, you'd wish to
see me."</p>

<p>Was he mocking her? But he wore no smile; there was no bitterness
in his voice; and, though he was looking at her intently, she could
not tell from his face whether he still had any feeling.</p>

<p>"You think I owe you something? I know I treated you very
badly."</p>

<p>He looked rather as if she'd hit him.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, Francis, don't say you've come out of
chivalry. That'd be too funny."</p>

<p>"I don't follow you; I just thought, perhaps, you didn't like to
answer that question about a love-affair--because of me."</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar broke into hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or Don Punctilio! Because of you? No, no, my dear!"</p>

<p>Francis Wilmot drew back, and made her a little bow.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have come," he said.</p>

<p>She had a sudden return of feeling for that slim unusual presence,
with its grace and its dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm a free-lance again now, Francis, anyway."</p>

<p>A long moment went by, and then he made her another little bow. It
was a clear withdrawal.</p>

<p>"Then for God's sake," she said, "go away! I'm fed up!" And she
turned her back on him.</p>

<p>When she looked round, he <i>had</i> gone, and that surprised her.
He was a new variety, or a dead one, dug up! He didn't know the
rudiments of life--old-fashioned, <i>&agrave; faire rire!</i> And,
back at full length on the divan, she brooded. Well, her courage was
'not out'! To-morrow was Bella Magussie's 'At Home,' to meet--some
idiot. Everybody would be there, and so would she!</p>

<h2>FANTOCHES</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Michael, screwed towards Sir James Foskisson's averted face, heard
the words: "Well, I shan't answer," he spun round. It was just as if
she had said: "Yes, I have." The judge was looking at her, every one
looking at her. Wasn't Bullfry going to help her? No! He was
beckoning her out of the Box. Michael half rose, as she passed him.
By George! He was sorry for MacGown! There he sat, poor devil!--with
every one getting up all round him, still, and red as a
turkey-cock.</p>

<p>Fleur! Michael looked at her face, slightly flushed, her gloved
hands clasped in her lap, her eyes fixed on the ground. Had his
whisper: 'Stop this!' his little abortive bow, offended her? How
could one have helped sympathising with the 'Pet of the Panjoys' in
so tight a place! Fleur must see that! The Court was emptying--fine
birds, many--he could see her mother and her aunt and cousin, and Old
Forsyte, talking with Foskisson. Ah! he had finished; was speaking:
"We can go now."</p>

<p>They followed him along the corridor, down the stairs, into the
air.</p>

<p>"We've time for a snack," Soames was saying. "Come in here!"</p>

<p>In one of several kennels without roofs in a celebrated room with
a boarded floor, they sat down.</p>

<p>"Three chump chops, sharp," said Soames, and staring at the
cruet-stand, added: "She's cooked her goose. They'll drop it like a
hot potato. I've told Foskisson he can settle, with both sides paying
their own costs. It's more than they deserve."</p>

<p>"He ought never to have asked that question, sir."</p>

<p>Fleur looked up sharply.</p>

<p>"Really, Michael!"</p>

<p>"Well, darling, we agreed he shouldn't. Why didn't Bullfry help
her out, sir?"</p>

<p>"Only too glad to get her out of the Box; the judge would have
asked her himself in another minute. It's a complete fiasco, thank
God!"</p>

<p>"Then we've won?" said Fleur.</p>

<p>"Unless I'm a Dutchman," answered Soames.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," muttered Michael.</p>

<p>"I tell you it's all over; Bullfry'll never go on with it."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that, sir."</p>

<p>Fleur said acidly: "Then what <i>do</i> you mean, Michael?"</p>

<p>"I don't think we shall be forgiven, that's all."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Well, I dare say I'm all wrong. Sauce, sir?"</p>

<p>"Worcester--yes. This is the only place in London where you can
rely on a floury potato. Waiter--three glasses of port, quick!"</p>

<p>After fifteen minutes of concentrated mastication, they returned
to the Court.</p>

<p>"Wait here," said Soames, in the hall; "I'll go up and find
out."</p>

<p>In that echoing space, where a man's height was so inconsiderable,
Fleur and Michael stood, not speaking, for some time.</p>

<p>"She couldn't know that Foskisson had been told not to follow it
up, of course," he said, at last. "Still, she must have expected the
question. She should have told a good one and have done with it. I
couldn't help feeling sorry for her."</p>

<p>"You'd feel sorry for a flea that bit you, Michael. What do you
mean by our not being forgiven?"</p>

<p>"Well! The drama was all on her side, and it's drama that counts.
Besides, there's her engagement!"</p>

<p>"That'll be broken off."</p>

<p>"Exactly! And if it is, she'll have sympathy; while if it isn't,
he'll have it. Anyway, we shan't. Besides, you know, she stood up for
what we all really believe nowadays."</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, don't we talk of every one being free?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but is there any connection between what we say and what we
do?"</p>

<p>"No," said Michael.</p>

<p>And just then Soames returned.</p>

<p>"Well, sir?"</p>

<p>"As I told you, Bullfry caught at it. They've settled. It's a
moral victory."</p>

<p>"Oh! not moral, I hope, sir."</p>

<p>"It's cost a pretty penny, anyway," said Soames, looking at Fleur.
"Your mother's quite annoyed--she's no sense of proportion. Very
clever the way Foskisson made that woman lose her temper."</p>

<p>"He lost his, at the end. That's his excuse, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Well," said Soames, "it's all over! Your mother's got the car;
we'll take a taxi."</p>

<p>On the drive back to South Square, taking precisely the same
route, there was precisely the same silence.</p>

<p>When a little later Michael went over to the House, he was edified
by posters.</p>

<p>"Society Libel Action."</p>

<p>"Marquess's Granddaughter and K. C."</p>

<p>"Dramatic Evidence."</p>

<p>"Modern Morality!"</p>

<p>All over--was it? With publicity--in Michael's opinion--it had but
just begun! Morality! What was it--who had it, and what did they do
with it? How would he have answered those questions himself? Who
could answer them, nowadays, by rote or rule? Not he, or Fleur! They
had been identified with the Inquisition, and what was their
position, now? False, if not odious! He passed into the House. But,
try as he would, he could not fix his attention on the Purity of
Food, and passed out again. With a curious longing for his father, he
walked rapidly down Whitehall. Drawing blank at 'Snooks'' and The
Aeroplane, he tried the Parthenaeum as a last resort. Sir Lawrence
was in a corner of a forbidden room, reading a life of Lord
Palmerston. He looked up at his son.</p>

<p>"Ah! Michael! They don't do justice to old Pam. A man without
frills, who worked like a nigger. But we mustn't talk here!" And he
pointed to a member who seemed awake. "Shall we take a turn before
the old gentleman over there has a fit? The books here are
camouflage; it's really a dormitory."</p>

<p>He led the way, with Michael retailing the events of the
morning.</p>

<p>"Foskisson?" said Sir Lawrence, entering the Green Park. "He was a
nice little chap when I left Winchester. To be professionally in the
right is bad for a man's character--counsel, parsons, policemen, they
all suffer from it. Judges, High Priests, Arch-Inspectors, aren't so
bad--they've suffered from it so long that they've lost
consciousness."</p>

<p>"It was a full house," said Michael, glumly, "and the papers have
got hold of it."</p>

<p>"They would." And Sir Lawrence pointed to the ornamental water.
"These birds," he said, "remind me of China. By the way, I met your
friend Desert yesterday at The Aeroplane--he's more interesting now
that he's dropped Poetry for the East. Everybody ought to drop
something. I'm too old now, but if I'd dropped baronetcy in time, I
could have made quite a good contortionist."</p>

<p>"What would you recommend for us in the House?" asked Michael,
with a grin.</p>

<p>"Postmanship, my dear--carrying on, you know; a certain
importance, large bags, dogs to bark at you, no initiative, and
conversation on every door-step. By the way, do you see Desert?"</p>

<p>"I have seen him."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence screwed up his eyes.</p>

<p>"The providential," he said, "doesn't happen twice."</p>

<p>Michael coloured; he had not suspected his father of such shrewd
observation. Sir Lawrence swung his cane.</p>

<p>"Your man Boddick," he said, "has persuaded some of his hens to
lay; he's giving us quite good eggs."</p>

<p>Michael admired his reticence. But somehow that unexpected
slanting allusion to a past domestic crisis roused the feeling that
for so long now had been curled like a sleepy snake in his chest,
that another crisis was brewing and must soon be faced.</p>

<p>"Coming along for tea, sir? Kit had tummy-ache this morning. How's
your last book doing? Does old Danby advertise it properly?"</p>

<p>"No," said Sir Lawrence, "no; he's keeping his head wonderfully;
the book is almost dead."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I dropped <i>him,</i> anyway," said Michael, with
emphasis. "I suppose, sir, you haven't a tip to give us, now this
case is over?"</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence gazed at a bird with a long red bill.</p>

<p>"When victorious," he said, at last, "lie doggo. The triumphs of
morality are apt to recoil on those who achieve them."</p>

<p>"That's what I feel, sir. Heaven knows <i>I</i> didn't want to
achieve one. My father-in-law says my hitting MacGown on the boko
really brought it into Court."</p>

<p>Sir Lawrence whinnied.</p>

<p>"The tax on luxuries. It gets you everywhere. I don't think I will
come along, Michael--Old Forsyte's probably there. Your mother has an
excellent recipe for child's tummyache; you almost lived on it at one
time. I'll telephone it from Mount Street. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Michael looked after that thin and sprightly figure moving North.
Had he troubles of his own? If so, he disguised them wonderfully.
Good old Bart! And he turned towards South Square.</p>

<p>Soames was just leaving.</p>

<p>"She's excited," he said, on the door-step. "It's the reaction.
Give her a Seidlitz powder tonight. Be careful, too; I shouldn't talk
about politics."</p>

<p>Michael went in. Fleur was at the open window of the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Oh! here you are!" she said. "Kit's all right again. Take me to
the Caf&eacute; Royal to-night, Michael, and if there's anything
funny anywhere, for goodness' sake, let's see it. I'm sick of feeling
solemn. Oh! And, by the way, Francis Wilmot's coming in to say
good-bye. I've had a note. He says he's all right again."</p>

<p>At the window by her side, Michael sniffed the unaccountable scent
of grass. There was a South-West wind, and slanting from over the
housetops, sunlight was sprinkling the soil, the buds, the branches.
A blackbird sang; a piano-organ round a corner was playing
'Rigoletto.' Against his own, her shoulder was soft, and to his lips
her cheek was warm and creamy. . . .</p>

<p>When Francis Wilmot left them that evening after dinner at the
Caf&eacute; Royal, Fleur said to Michael:</p>

<p>"Poor Francis! Did you ever see any one so changed? He might be
thirty. I'm glad he's going home to his river and his darkies. What
are live oaks? Well! Are we going anywhere?"</p>

<p>Michael cloaked her shoulders.</p>

<p>"'Great Itch,' I think; there's no other scream so certain."</p>

<p>After their scream they came out into a mild night. High up in red
and green the bright signs fled along the air: 'Tomber's Tires for
Speed and Safety,' 'Milkoh Makes Mothers Merry.' Through Trafalgar
Square they went and down Whitehall, all moonlight and Portland
stone.</p>

<p>"The night's unreal," said Fleur. <i>"'Fantoches'!"</i></p>

<p>Michael caught her waist.</p>

<p>"Don't. Suppose some Member saw you!"</p>

<p>"He'd only sympathise. How nice and solid you feel!"</p>

<p>"No! <i>Fantoches</i> have no substance."</p>

<p>"Then give me shadow."</p>

<p>"The substance is in Bethnal Green."</p>

<p>Michael dropped his arm.</p>

<p>"That's a strange thought."</p>

<p>"I have intuitions, Michael."</p>

<p>"Because I can admire a good woman, can I not love you?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> shall never be 'good'; it isn't in me."</p>

<p>"Whatever you are's enough for me."</p>

<p>"Prettily said. The Square looks jolly, tonight! Open the doll's
house."</p>

<p>The hall was dark, with just a glimmer coming through the
fanlight. Michael took off her cloak and knelt down. He felt her
fingers stir his hair; real fingers, and real all this within his
arms; only the soul elusive. Soul?</p>

<p><i>"Fantoches!"</i> came her voice, soft and mocking. "And so to
bed!"</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><a name="C309">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>ROUT AT MRS. MAGUSSIE'S</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>There are routs social, political, propagandic; and routs like
Mrs. Magussie's. In one of Anglo-American birth, inexhaustible
wealth, unimpeachable widowhood, and catholic taste, the word hostess
had found its highest expression. People might die, marry, and be
born with impunity so long as they met, preferably in her house, one
of the largest in Mayfair. If she called in a doctor, it was to meet
another doctor; if she went to church, it was to get Canon Forant to
meet Dean Kimble at lunch afterwards. Her cards of invitation had the
words: "To meet" printed on them; and she never put "me." She was
selfless. Once in a way she had a real rout, because once in a way a
personality was available, whose name everybody, from poets to
prelates, must know. In her intimate belief people loved to meet
anybody sufficiently distinguished; and this was where she succeeded,
because almost without exception they did. Her two husbands had
'passed on,' having met in their time nearly everybody. They had both
been distinguished, and had first met in her house; and she would
never have a third, for Society was losing its landmarks, and she was
too occupied. People were inclined to smile at mention of Bella
Magussie, and yet, how do without one who performed the function of
cement? Without her, bishops could not place their cheeks by the
jowls of ballet-girls, or Home Secretaries be fertilised by
disorderly dramatists. Except in her house, the diggers-up of old
civilisations in Beluchistan never encountered the levellers of
modern civilisation in London. Nor was there any chance for lights of
the Palace to meet those lights of the Halls--Madame Nemesia and Top
Nobby. Nowhere else could a Russian dancer go in to supper with Sir
Walter Peddel, M. D., F. R. S. T. R., P. M. V. S., 'R. I. P.,' as
Michael would add. Even a bowler with the finest collection of ducks'
eggs in first-class cricket was not without a chance of wringing the
hand of the great Indian economist Sir Banerjee Bath Babore. Mrs.
Magussie's, in fine, was a house of chief consequence; and her long
face, as of the guardian of some first principle, moving above the
waters of celebrity, was wrinkled in a great cause. To meet or not to
meet? She had answered the question for good and all.</p>

<p>The "meetee" as Michael always called it for her opening rout in
1925 was the great Italian violinist Luigi Sporza, who had just
completed his remarkable tour of the world, having in half the time
played more often than any two previous musicians. The prodigious
feat had been noted in the Press of all countries with every
circumstance--the five violins he had tired out, the invitation he
had received to preside over a South American Republic, the special
steamer he had chartered to keep an engagement in North America, and
his fainting fit in Moscow after the Beethoven and Brahms concertos,
the Bach chaconne, and seventeen encores. During the lingering year
of his great effort, his fame had been established. As an artist he
had been known to a few, as an athlete he was now known to all.</p>

<p>Michael and Fleur, passing up the centre stairway, saw a man 'not
'arf like a bull'--Michael muttered--whose hand people were seizing,
one after the other, to move away with a look of pain.</p>

<p>"Only Italy can produce men like that," Michael said in Fleur's
ear. "Give him the go-by. He'll hurt you."</p>

<p>But Fleur moved forward.</p>

<p>"Made of sterner stuff," murmured Michael. It was not the part of
his beloved to miss the hand of celebrity, however horny! No portion
of her charming face quivered as the great athlete's grip closed on
hers, and his eyes, like those of a tired minotaur, traversed her
gracefulness with a gleam of interest.</p>

<p>'Hulking brute!' thought Michael, disentangling his own grasp, and
drifting with her over shining space. Since yesterday's ordeal and
its subsequent spring-running, he had kept his unacceptable
misgivings to himself; he did not even know whether, at this rout,
she was deliberately putting their position to the test, or merely,
without forethought, indulging her liking to be in the swim. And what
a swim! In that great pillared <i>salon,</i> Members of Parliament,
poets, musicians, very dry in the smile, as who should say: 'I could
have done it better,' or 'Imagine doing that!' peers, physicians,
dancers, painters, Labour Leaders, cricketers, lawyers, critics,
ladies of fashion, and ladies who 'couldn't bear it'--every mortal
person that Michael knew or didn't know, seemed present. He watched
Fleur's eyes quartering them, busy as bees beneath the white lids he
had kissed last night. He envied her that social curiosity; to live
in London without it was like being at the sea without bathing. She
was quietly--he could tell--making up her mind whom she wanted to
speak to among those she knew, and whom, among those she didn't yet
know, she wanted to speak to her. 'I hope to God she's not in for a
snubbing,' he thought, and as soon as she was engaged in talk, he
slipped towards a pillar. A small voice behind him said: "Well, young
Mont!" Mr. Blythe, looking like a Dover sole above Kew Bridge, was
squeezed against the same pillar, his eyes goggling timorously above
his beard.</p>

<p>"Stick to me!" he said. "These bees are too bee busy."</p>

<p>"Were you in Court yesterday?" asked Michael.</p>

<p>"No; one read about it. You did well."</p>

<p>"She did better."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Mr. Blythe. "By the way, <i>The Evening Sun</i> was at
us again this afternoon. They compared us to kittens playing with
their tails. It's time for your second barrel, Mont."</p>

<p>"I thought--on the agricultural estimates."</p>

<p>"Good! Governmental purchase and control of wheat. Stress use of
the present machinery. No more officials than are absolutely
necessary."</p>

<p>"Blythe," said Michael suddenly, "where were you born?"</p>

<p>"Lincolnshire."</p>

<p>"You're English, then?"</p>

<p>"Pure," said Mr. Blythe.</p>

<p>"So am I; so's old Foggart--I looked him up in the stud-book. It's
lucky, because we shall certainly be assailed for lack of
patriotism."</p>

<p>"We <i>are,"</i> said Mr. Blythe. "'People who can see no good in
their own country. . . . Birds who foul their own nest. . . . Gentry
never happy unless running England down in the eyes of the world. . .
. Calamity-mongers. . . . Pessimists. . . .' You don't mind that sort
of gup, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," said Michael, "I do; it hurts me inside. It's so
damned unjust. I simply can't bear the idea of England being in a
fix."</p>

<p>Mr. Blythe's eyes rolled.</p>

<p>"She's bee well not going to be, if we can help it."</p>

<p>"If only I amounted to something," murmured Michael; "but I always
feel as if I could creep into one of my back teeth."</p>

<p>"Have it crowned. What you want is brass, Mont. And talking of
brass: There's your late adversary! <i>She's</i> got brass all right.
Look at her!"</p>

<p>Michael saw Marjorie Ferrar moving away from the great Italian, in
not too much of a sea-green gown, with her red-gold head held high.
She came to a stand a small room's length from Fleur, and swept her
eyes this way and that. Evidently she had taken up that position in
deliberate challenge.</p>

<p>"I must go to Fleur."</p>

<p>"So must I," said Mr. Blythe, and Michael gave him a grateful
look.</p>

<p>And now it would have been so interesting to one less interested
than Michael. The long, the tapering nose of Society could be seen to
twitch, move delicately upwards, and like the trunk of some wild
elephant scenting man, writhe and snout this way and that, catching
the whiff of sensation. Lips were smiling and moving closer to ears;
eyes turning from that standing figure to the other; little
reflective frowns appeared on foreheads, as if, beneath cropped and
scented scalps, brains were trying to make choice. And Marjorie
Ferrar stood smiling and composed; and Fleur talked and twisted the
flower in her hand; and both went on looking their best. So began a
battle without sign of war declared, without even seeming recognition
of each other's presence. Mr. Blythe, indeed, stood pat between the
two of them. Bulky and tall, he was an effective screen. But Michael,
on the other side of her, could see and grimly follow. The Nose was
taking time to apprehend the full of the aroma; the Brain to make its
choice. Tide seemed at balance, not moving in or out. And then, with
the slow implacability of tides, the water moved away from Fleur and
lapped round her rival. Michael chattered, Mr. Blythe goggled, using
the impersonal pronoun with a sort of passion; Fleur smiled, talked,
twisted the flower. And, over there, Marjorie Ferrar seemed to hold a
little Court. Did people admire, commiserate, approve of, or
sympathise with her? Or did they disapprove of himself and Fleur? Or
was it just that the 'Pet of the Panjoys' was always the more
sensational figure? Michael watched Fleur growing paler, her smile
more nervous, the twitching of the flower spasmodic. And he dared not
suggest going; for she would see in it an admission of defeat. But on
the faces, turned their way, the expression became more and more
informative. Sir James Foskisson had done his job too well; he had
slavered his clients with his own self-righteousness. Better the
confessed libertine than those who brought her to judgment! And
Michael thought: 'Dashed natural, after all! Why didn't the fellow
take my tip, and let us pay and look pleasant.'</p>

<p>And just then close to the great Italian he caught sight of a tall
young man with his hair brushed back, who was looking at his fingers.
By George! It was Bertie Curfew! And there, behind him, waiting for
his turn 'to meet,' who but MacGown himself! The humour of the gods
had run amok! Head in air, soothing his mangled fingers, Bertie
Curfew passed them, and strayed into the group around his former
flame. Her greeting of him was elaborately casual. But up went the
tapering Nose, for here came MacGown! How the fellow had
changed--grim, greyish, bitter? The great Italian had met his match
for once. And he too, stepped into that throng.</p>

<p>A queer silence was followed by a burst of speech, and then by
dissolution. In twos and threes they trickled off, and there were
MacGown and his betrothed standing alone. Michael turned to
Fleur.</p>

<p>"Let's go."</p>

<p>Silence reigned in their homing cab. He had chattered himself out
on the field of battle, and must wait for fresh supplies of
camouflage. But he slipped his hand along till it found hers, which
did not return his pressure. The card he used to play at times of
stress--the eleventh baronet--had failed for the last three months;
Fleur seemed of late to resent his introduction as a remedy. He
followed her into the dining-room, sore at heart, bewildered in mind.
He had never seen her look so pretty as in that oyster-coloured
frock, very straight and simply made, with a swing out above the
ankles. She sat down at the narrow dining-table, and he seated
himself opposite, with the costive feeling of one who cannot find
words that will ring true. For social discomfiture he himself didn't
care a tinker's curse; but she--!</p>

<p>And, suddenly, she said:</p>

<p>"And you don't mind?"</p>

<p>"For myself--not a bit."</p>

<p>"Yes, you've still got your Foggartism and your Bethnal
Green."</p>

<p>"If <i>you</i> care, Fleur, I care a lot."</p>

<p><i>"If</i> I care!"</p>

<p>"How--exactly?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather not increase your feeling that I'm a snob."</p>

<p>"I never had any such feeling."</p>

<p>"Michael!"</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better say what you mean by the word?"</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well."</p>

<p>"I know that you appreciate having people about you, and like them
to think well of you. That isn't being a snob."</p>

<p>"Yes; you're very kind, but you don't admire it."</p>

<p>"I admire you."</p>

<p>"You mean, desire me. You admire Norah Curfew."</p>

<p>"Norah Curfew! For all I care, she might snuff out to-morrow."</p>

<p>And from her face he had the feeling that she believed him.</p>

<p>"If it isn't her, it's what she stands for--all that I'm not."</p>

<p>"I admire a lot in you," said Michael, fervently; "your
intelligence, your <i>flair;</i> I admire you with Kit and your
father; your pluck; and the way you put up with me."</p>

<p>"No, I admire you much more than you admire me. Only, you see, I'm
not capable of devotion."</p>

<p>"What about Kit?"</p>

<p>"I'm devoted to myself--that's all."</p>

<p>He reached across the table and touched her hand.</p>

<p>"Morbid, darling."</p>

<p>"No. I see too clearly to be morbid."</p>

<p>She was leaning back, and her throat, very white and round,
gleamed in the alabaster-shaded light; little choky movements were
occurring there.</p>

<p>"Michael, I want you to take me round the world."</p>

<p>"And leave Kit?"</p>

<p>"He's too young to mind. Besides, my mother would look after
him."</p>

<p>If she had got as far as that, this was a deliberate desire!</p>

<p>"But, your father--"</p>

<p>"He's not really old yet, and he'd have Kit."</p>

<p>"When we rise in August, perhaps--"</p>

<p>"No, now."</p>

<p>"It's only five months to wait. We'd have time in the vacation to
do a lot of travelling."</p>

<p>Fleur looked straight at him.</p>

<p>"I knew you cared more for Foggartism now than for me."</p>

<p>"Be reasonable, Fleur."</p>

<p>"For five months--with the feeling I've got here!" she put her
hand to her breast. "I've had six months of it already. You don't
realise, I suppose, that I'm down and out?"</p>

<p>"But, Fleur, it's all so--"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's always petty to mind being a dead failure, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"But, my child--"</p>

<p>"Oh! If you can't feel it--"</p>

<p>"I can--I felt wild this evening. But all you've got to do is to
let them see that you don't care; and they'll come buzzing round
again like flies. It would be running away, Fleur."</p>

<p>"No," said Fleur, coldly, "it's not that--I don't try twice for
the same prize. Very well, I'll stay and be laughed at."</p>

<p>Michael got up.</p>

<p>"I know you don't think there's anything to my job. But there is,
Fleur, and I've put my hand to it. Oh! don't look like that. Dash it!
This is dreadful!"</p>

<p>"I suppose I could go by myself. That would be more
thrilling."</p>

<p>"Absurd! Of course you couldn't! You're seeing blue to-night, old
thing. It'll all seem different to-morrow."</p>

<p>"To-morrow and to-morrow! No, Michael, mortification has set in,
my funeral can take place any day you like!"</p>

<p>Michael's hands went up. She meant what she was saying! To
realise, he must remember how much store she had set on her powers as
hostess; how she had worked for her collection and shone among it!
Her house of cards all pulled about her ears! Cruel! But would going
round the world help her? Yes! Her instinct was quite right. He had
been round the world himself, nothing else would change her values in
quite that way; nothing else would so guarantee oblivion in others
and herself! Lippinghall, her father's, the sea for the five months
till vacation came--they wouldn't meet her case! She needed what
would give her back importance. And yet, how could he go until the
vacation? Foggartism--that lean and lonely plant--unwatered and
without its only gardener, would wither to its roots, if, indeed, it
had any. There was some movement in it now, interest here and
there--this Member and that was pecking at it. Private efforts in the
same direction were gathering way. And time was going on--Big Ben had
called no truce; unemployment swelling, trade dawdling, industrial
trouble brewing--brewing, hope losing patience! And what would old
Blythe say to his desertion now?</p>

<p>"Give me a week," he muttered. "It's not easy. I must think it
over."</p>

<br>


<h2>THE NEW LEAF</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When MacGown came up to her, Marjorie Ferrar thought: 'Does he
know about Bertie?' Fresh from her triumph over 'that little snob,'
fluttered by the sudden appearance of her past, and confronted with
her present, she was not in complete possession of her head. When
they had moved away into an empty side room, she faced him.</p>

<p>"Well, Alec, nothing's changed. I still have a past as lurid as it
was yesterday. I'm extremely sorry I ever kept it from you. But I did
practically tell you, several times; only you wouldn't take it."</p>

<p>"Because it was hell to me. Tell me everything, Marjorie!"</p>

<p>"You want to revel in it?"</p>

<p>"Tell me everything, and I'll marry you still."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Marry! Oh! no! I don't go out of my depth any
more. It was absurd anyway. I never loved you, Alec."</p>

<p>"Then you loved that--you still--"</p>

<p>"My dear Alec, enough!"</p>

<p>He put his hands to his head, and swayed. And she was touched by
genuine compassion.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry, I really am. You've got to cut me out; that's
all."</p>

<p>She had turned to leave him, but the misery in his face stopped
her. She had not quite realised.</p>

<p>He was burnt up! He was--! And she said quickly:</p>

<p>"Marry you I won't; but I'd like to pay up, if I could--"</p>

<p>He looked at her.</p>

<p>Quivering all over from that look, she shrugged her shoulders, and
walked away. Men of an old fashion! Her own fault for stepping
outside the charmed circle that took nothing too seriously. She
walked over the shining floor, conscious of many eyes, slipped past
her hostess, and soon was in a cab.</p>

<p>She lay awake, thinking. Even without announcement, the return of
presents would set London by the ears and bring on her again an
avalanche of bills. Five thousand pounds! She got up and rummaged out
the list, duplicate of that which Alec had. He might still want to
pay them! After all, it was he who had spilled the ink by making her
go into Court! But then his eyes came haunting her. Out of the
question! And, shivering a little, she got back into bed. Perhaps she
would have a brain-wave in the morning. She had so many in the night,
that she could not sleep. Moscow with Bertie Curfew? The stage?
America and the 'movies'? All three? She slept at last, and woke
languid and pale. With her letters was one from Shropshire House.</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"DEAR MARJORIE,</p>

<p>"If you've nothing better to do, I should like to see you this
morning.</p>

<p>"Affectionately,</p>

<p>"SHROPSHIRE."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>What now? She looked at herself in the glass, and decided that she
<i>must</i> make up a little. At eleven o'clock she was at Shropshire
House. The marquess was in his workroom at the top, among a small
forest of contraptions. With coat off, he was peering through a
magnifying-glass at what looked like nothing.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Marjorie," he said; "I'll have done in a minute."</p>

<p>Except the floor, there seemed nowhere to sit, so she remained
standing.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said the marquess; "the Italians are wrong."</p>

<p>He put the spy-glass down, ran his hand through his silvery hair,
and drew his ruffled beard into a peak. Then, taking an eyebrow
between finger and thumb, he gave it an upward twist, and scratched
himself behind one ear.</p>

<p>"They're wrong; there's no reaction whatever."</p>

<p>Turning towards his granddaughter, he screwed up his eyes till
they were bright as pins. "You've never been up here before. Sit in
the window."</p>

<p>She seated herself on a broad window-ledge covering some sort of
battery, with her back to the light.</p>

<p>"So you brought that case, Marjorie?"</p>

<p>"I had to."</p>

<p>"Now, why?" He was standing with his head a little to one side,
his cheeks very pink, and his eyes very shrewd. And she thought:
'After all, I'm his granddaughter. I'll plunge.'</p>

<p>"Common honesty, if you want to know."</p>

<p>The marquess pouted, as if trying to understand the words.</p>

<p>"I read your evidence," he said, "if you mean that."</p>

<p>"No. I meant that I wanted to find out where I stood."</p>

<p>"And did you?"</p>

<p>"Very much so."</p>

<p>"Are you still going to be married?"</p>

<p>Really, he was a spry old boy!</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Whose doing? Yours or his?"</p>

<p>"He still says he'll marry me if I tell him everything. But I
don't choose to."</p>

<p>The marquess moved two steps, placed his foot on a box, and
assumed his favourite attitude. He had a red silk tie this morning
which floated loose; his tweed trousers were of a blue-green, his
shirt of a green-blue. He looked wonderfully bright.</p>

<p>"Is there much to tell?"</p>

<p>"A good deal."</p>

<p>"Well, Marjorie, you know what I said to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, Grandfather, but I don't quite see it. <i>I</i> don't want
to stand for anything."</p>

<p>"Ah! you're an exception in our class--luckily! But it's the
exceptions that do the harm."</p>

<p>"If people took one as any better than themselves, perhaps. But
they don't nowadays."</p>

<p>"Not quite honest, that," interrupted the marquess; "what about
the feeling in your bones?"</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"It's good to mortify oneself, Grandfather."</p>

<p>"By having a better time than you ought, um? So your marriage is
off?"</p>

<p>"Very much so."</p>

<p>"Are you in debt?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How much do you owe?"</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar hesitated. Should she compromise, or blurt it
out?</p>

<p>"No heel-taps, Marjorie."</p>

<p>"Well, then, five thousand about."</p>

<p>The old peer screwed up his lips, and a melancholy little whistle
escaped.</p>

<p>"A good deal of it, of course, is due to my engagement."</p>

<p>"Your father won a race the other day, I see."</p>

<p>The old boy knew everything!</p>

<p>"Yes; but I believe it's all gone."</p>

<p>"It would be," said the marquess. "What are you going to do
now?"</p>

<p>She had a strong desire to answer: "What are you?" but restrained
it, and said:</p>

<p>"I thought of going on the stage."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose that might be suitable. Can you act?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a Duse."</p>

<p>"Duse?" The marquess shook his head. "One must go back to Ristori
for really great acting. Duse! Very talented, of course, but always
the same. So you don't choose to marry him now?" He looked at her
intently. "That, I think, is right. Have you a list of your
debts?"</p>

<p>Marjorie Ferrar rummaged in her vanity bag. "Here it is."</p>

<p>She could see his nose wrinkling above it, but whether at its
scent, or its contents, she could not tell.</p>

<p>"Your grandmother," he said, "spent about a fifth of what you seem
to on about five times the acreage of clothes. You wear nothing
nowadays, and yet it costs all this."</p>

<p>"The less there is, Grandfather, the better it has to be cut, you
know."</p>

<p>"Have you sent your presents back?"</p>

<p>"I'm having them packed."</p>

<p>"They must all go," said the marquess. "Keep nothing he or any one
else gave you."</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"To frank you," he said, suddenly, "I should have to sell the
Gainsborough."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!"</p>

<p>Gainsborough's picture of his own grandmother as a little
girl--that beautiful thing. She stretched out her hand for the list.
Still holding it, he put his foot to the ground, and stood peering at
her with his bright, intent old eyes.</p>

<p>"The question is, Marjorie, how far it's possible to strike a
bargain with you. Have you a 'word' to keep?"</p>

<p>She felt the blood mounting in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I think so. It depends on what I've got to promise. But,
Grandfather, I don't <i>want</i> you to sell the Gainsborough."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately," said the marquess, "without doing your uncle
Dangerfield in the eye, I've nothing else. It's been my fault, I
suppose, for having had expensive children. Other people don't seem
to have had them to the same degree."</p>

<p>She stifled a smile.</p>

<p>"Times are hard," went on the marquess. "Land costs money,
collieries cost money, Shropshire House costs money; and where's the
money? I've got an invention here that ought to make my fortune, but
nobody will look at it."</p>

<p>The poor old boy--at his age! She said with a sigh:</p>

<p>"I really didn't mean to bother you with this, Grandfather. I'll
manage somehow."</p>

<p>The old peer took several somewhat hampered steps, and she noticed
that his red slippers were heelless. He halted, a wonderfully bright
spot among the contraptions.</p>

<p>"To come back to what we were saying, Marjorie. If your idea of
life is simply to have a good time, how can you promise
anything?"</p>

<p>"What do you want me to promise?"</p>

<p>He came and stood before her again, short and a little bent.</p>

<p>"You look as if you had stuff in you, too, with your hair. Do you
really think you could earn your living?"</p>

<p>"I believe I can; I know a lot of people."</p>

<p>"If I clear you, will you give me your word to pay ready money in
future? Now don't say 'Yes,' and go out and order yourself a lot of
fallals. I want the word of a lady, if you understand what that
implies."</p>

<p>She stood up.</p>

<p>"I suppose you've every right to say that. But I don't want you to
clear me if you have to sell the Gainsborough."</p>

<p>"You must leave that to me. I might manage, perhaps, to scrape it
up without. About that promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I promise that."</p>

<p>"Meaning to keep it?"</p>

<p>"Meaning to keep it."</p>

<p>"Well, that's something."</p>

<p>"Anything else, Grandfather?"</p>

<p>"I should have liked to ask you not to cheapen our name any more,
but I suppose that would be putting the clock back. The spirit of the
age is against me."</p>

<p>Turning from his face, she stood looking out of the window. The
spirit of the age! It was all very well, but he didn't understand
what it was. Cheapen? Why! she had <i>raised</i> the price of the
family name; hoicked it out of a dusty cupboard, and made of it
current coin. People sat up when they read of her. Did they sit up
when they read of grandfather? But he would never see that! And she
murmured:</p>

<p>"All right, dear, I'll be careful. I think I shall go to
America."</p>

<p>His eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"And start a fashion of marrying American husbands? It's not yet
been done, I believe. Get one who's interested in electricity, and
bring him over. There are great things for an American to do here.
Well, I'll keep this list and work it off somehow. Just one thing,
Marjorie: I'm eighty, and you're--what are you--twenty-five? Don't
get through life so fast--you'll be dreadfully bored by the time
you're fifty, and there's no greater bore than a bored person.
Good-bye!" He held out his hand.</p>

<p>She took a long breath. Free!</p>

<p>And, seizing his hand, she put it to her lips. Oh! He was gazing
at it--oh! Had her lips come off? And she hurried out. The old boy!
He was a darling to have kept that list! A new leaf! She would go at
once to Bertie Curfew and get him to turn it over for her! The
expression in his eye last night!</p>

<br>


<h2>OVER THE WINDMILL</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>During his period of indecision Michael struck no attitudes, and
used practically no words; the thing was too serious. Perhaps Kit
would change Fleur's mood, or she would see other disadvantages, such
as her father. The complete cessation, however, of any social
behaviour on her part--no invitation issued, or received, no function
attended, or even discussed, during that rather terrible week, proved
that the iron had really seared her spirit. She was not sulky, but
she was mum and listless. And she was always watching him, with a
wistful expression on her face, and now and then a resentful look, as
if she had made up her mind that he was going to refuse. He could
consult no one, too, for to any who had not lived through this long
episode, Fleur's attitude would seem incomprehensible, even
ridiculous. He could not give her away; could not even go to old
Blythe, until he had decided. Complicating his mental conflict was
the habitual doubt whether he was really essential to Foggartism. If
only his head would swell! He had not even the comfort of feeling
that a sturdy negative would impress Fleur; she thought his job a
stunt, useful to make him conspicuous, but of no real importance to
the country. She had the political cynicism of the woman in the
street; only what threatened property or Kit would really ruffle her!
He knew that his dilemma was comic. The future of England against the
present of a young woman socially snubbed! But, after all, only Sir
James Foggart and old Blythe so far seriously connected Foggartism
with the future of England; and if, now, he went off round the world,
even they would lose their faith.</p>

<p>On the last morning of that week, Michael, still in doubt, crossed
Westminster Bridge and sought the heart of the Surrey side. It was
unfamiliar, and he walked with interest. Here, he remembered, the
Bickets had lived; the Bickets who had failed, and apparently were
failing in Australia, too. Street after mean street! Breeding-ground
of Bickets! Catch them early, catch them often, catch them before
they were Bickets, spoiled for the land; make them men and women of
property, give them air and give them sun--the most decent folk in
the world, give them a chance! Ugly houses, ugly shops, ugly pubs!
No, that wouldn't do! Keep Beauty out of it; Beauty never went down
in 'the House'! No sentiment went down! At least, only such as was
understood--'British stock,' 'Patriotism,' 'Empire,' 'Moral Fibre.'
Thews and productive power--stick to the cliches! He stood listening
outside a school to the dull hum of education. The English breed with
its pluck and its sense of humour and its patience, all mewed-up in
mean streets!</p>

<p>He had a sudden longing for the country. His motor-cycle! Since
taking his seat in Parliament he had not been on a machine so
inclined to bump his dignity. But he would have it out now, and go
for a run--it might shake him into a decision!</p>

<p>Fleur was not in, and no lunch ordered. So he ate some ham, and by
two o'clock had started.</p>

<p>With spit and bluster he ran out along the road past Chiswick,
Slough, and Maidenhead; crossed the river and sputtered towards
Reading. At Caversham he crossed again, and ran on to Pangbourne. By
the towing path he tipped his machine into some bushes and sat down
to smoke a pipe. Quite windless! The river between the bare poplars
had a grey, untroubled look; the catkins were forming on the willows.
He plucked a twig, and stirred it round the bowl of his pipe before
pressing in tobacco. The shaking had done him good; his mind was
working freely. The war! One had no hesitations then; but then--one
had no Fleur. Besides, that was a clear, a simple issue. But now,
beyond this 'to stay or not to stay,' Michael seemed seeing the
future of his married life. The decision that he made would affect
what might last another fifty years. To put your hand to the plough,
and at the first request to take it off again! You might be ploughing
crooked, and by twilight; but better plough by dim light than no
light; a crooked furrow than none at all! Foggartism was the best
course he could see, and he must stick to it! The future of England!
A blackbird, close by, chuckled. Quite so! But, as old Blythe said,
one must stand up to laughter! Oh! Surely in the long run Fleur would
see that he couldn't play fast and loose; see that if she wanted him
to remain in Parliament--and she did--he must hang on to the line he
had taken, however it amused the blackbirds. She wouldn't like him to
sink to the nonentity of a turntail. For after all she was his wife,
and with his self-respect her own was bound up.</p>

<p>He watched the smoke from his pipe, and the low grey clouds, the
white-faced Herefords grazing beyond the river, and a man fishing
with a worm. He took up the twig and twirled it, admiring the
yellowish-grey velvet of its budding catkins. He felt quiet in the
heart, at last, but very sorry. How make up to Fleur? Beside this
river, not two miles away, he had courted--queer word--if not won
her! And now they had come to this snag. Well, it was up to her now,
whether or no they should come to grief on it. And it seemed to him,
suddenly, that he would like to tell Old Forsyte. . . .</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When he heard the splutter of Michael's motorcycle, Soames was
engaged in hanging the Fred Walker he had bought at the emporium next
to Messrs. Settlewhite and Stark, memorialising his freedom from the
worry of that case, and soothing his itch for the British School.
Fred Walker! The fellow was old-fashioned; he and Mason had been
succeeded by a dozen movements. But--like old fiddles, with the same
agreeable glow--there they were, very good curiosities such as would
always command a price.</p>

<p>Having detached a Courbet, early and about ripe, he was standing
in his shirt-sleeves, with a coil of wire in his hand, when Michael
entered.</p>

<p>"Where have you sprung from?" he said, surprised.</p>

<p>"I happened to be passing, sir, on my old bike. I see you've kept
your word about the English School."</p>

<p>Soames attached the wire.</p>

<p>"I shan't be happy," he said, "till I've got an old Crome--best of
the English landscapists."</p>

<p>"Awfully rare, isn't he, old Crome?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's why I want him."</p>

<p>The smile on Michael's face, as if he were thinking: 'You mean
that's why you consider him the best,' was lost on Soames giving the
wire a final twist.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen your pictures for a long time, sir. Can I look
round?"</p>

<p>Observing him sidelong, Soames remembered his appearance there one
summer Sunday, after he had first seen Fleur in that Gallery off Cork
Street. Only four years? It seemed an age! The young fellow had worn
better than one had hoped; looked a good deal older, too, less
flighty; an amiable chap, considering his upbringing, and that war!
And suddenly he perceived that Michael was engaged in observing him.
Wanted something, no doubt--wouldn't have come down for nothing! He
tried to remember when anybody had come to see him without wanting
something; but could not. It was natural!</p>

<p>"Are you looking for a picture to go with that Fragonard?" he
said. "There's a Chardin in the corner."</p>

<p>"No, no, sir; you've been much too generous to us already."</p>

<p>Generous! How could one be generous to one's only daughter?</p>

<p>"How is Fleur?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you about her. She's feeling awfully
restless."</p>

<p>Soames looked out of the window. The Spring was late!</p>

<p>"She oughtn't to be, with that case out of the way."</p>

<p>"That's just it, sir."</p>

<p>Soames gimleted the young man's face. "I don't follow you."</p>

<p>"We're being cold-shouldered."</p>

<p>"How? You won."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you see, people resent moral superiority."</p>

<p>"What's that? Who--?" Moral superiority--he resented it
himself!</p>

<p>"Foskisson, you know; we're tarred with his brush. I told you I
was afraid of it. It's the being laughed at Fleur feels so
bitterly."</p>

<p>"Laughed at? Who has the impudence--?"</p>

<p>"To attack modern morality was a good stunt, sir, with the judge
and the jury, and any one professionally pompous; but it makes one
ridiculous nowadays in Society, you know, when everybody prides
himself on lack of prejudice."</p>

<p>"Society!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but it's what we live in. <i>I</i> don't mind, got used
to it over Foggartism; but Fleur's miserable. It's natural, if you
think of it--Society's her game."</p>

<p>"She ought to have more strength of mind," said Soames. But he was
gravely perturbed. First she'd been looked on as a snob, and now
there was this!</p>

<p>"What with that German actor hanging himself at Lippinghall,"
Michael went on, "and my Foggartism, and this Ferrar rumpus, our
pitch is badly queered. We've had a wretched week of it since the
case. Fleur feels so out of her plate, that she wants me to take her
round the world."</p>

<p>A bomb bursting on the dove-cote down there could not have been
more startling. Round the world! He heard Michael murmuring on:</p>

<p>"She's quite right, too. It might be the very best thing for her;
but I simply can't leave my job until the long vacation. I've taken
up this thing, and I must stick to it while Parliament's
sitting."</p>

<p>Sitting! As if it were a hen, addling its precious eggs! Round the
world!</p>

<p>But Michael ran on:</p>

<p>"It's only to-day I've quite decided. I should feel like a
deserter, and that wouldn't be good for either of us in the long run.
But she doesn't know yet."</p>

<p>For Soames the dove-cote was solidifying again, now that he knew
Michael was not going to take her away for goodness knew how
long!</p>

<p>"Round the world!" he said. "Why not--er--Pontresina?"</p>

<p>"I think," answered Michael, slowly, like a doctor diagnosing,
"that she wants something dramatic. Round the world at twenty-three!
She feels somehow that she's lost caste."</p>

<p>"How can she think of leaving that little chap?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that shows it's pretty desperate with her. I wish to
goodness I <i>could</i> go."</p>

<p>Soames stared. The young fellow wasn't expecting him to do
anything about it, was he? Round the world? A crazy notion!</p>

<p>"I must see her," he said. "Can you leave that thing of yours in
the garage and come up with me in the car? I'll be ready in twenty
minutes. You'll find tea going down-stairs."</p>

<p>Left alone with the Fred Walker still unhung, Soames gazed at his
pictures. He saw them with an added clarity, a more penetrating
glance, a sort of ache in his heart, as if--Well! A good lot they
were, better than he had thought, of late! <i>She</i> had gone in for
collecting people! And now she'd lost her collection! Poor little
thing! All nonsense, of course--as if there were any satisfaction in
people! Suppose he took her up that Chardin? It was a good Chardin.
Dumetrius had done him over the price, but not too much. And, before
Chardin was finished with, he would do Dumetrius. Still--if it would
give her any pleasure! He unhooked the picture, and, carrying it
under his arm, went down-stairs.</p>

<p>Beyond certain allusions to the characteristics of the eleventh
baronet, and the regrettable tendencies of the police to compel slow
travelling over the new cut constructed to speed up traffic, little
was said in the car. They arrived in South Square about six o'clock.
Fleur had not been in since lunch; and they sat down uneasily to wait
for her. The Dandie, having descended to look for strange legs, had
almost immediately ascended again, and the house was very quiet.
Michael was continually looking at his watch.</p>

<p>"Where do you think she's got to?" said Soames, at last.</p>

<p>"Haven't an idea, sir; that's the worst of London, it swallows
people up."</p>

<p>He had begun to fidget; Soames, who also wanted to fidget, was
thinking of saying: "Don't!" when from the window Michael cried:</p>

<p>"Here she is!" and went quickly to the door.</p>

<p>Soames sat on, with the Chardin resting against his chair.</p>

<p>They were a long time out there! Minute after minute passed, and
still they did not come.</p>

<p>At last Michael reappeared. He looked exceedingly grave.</p>

<p>"She's in her little room up-stairs, sir. I'm afraid my decision
has upset her awfully. Perhaps you wouldn't mind going up."</p>

<p>Soames grasped the Chardin.</p>

<p>"Let's see, that's the first door on the left, isn't it?" He
mounted slowly, his mind blank, and without waiting for her to answer
his mild knock, went in.</p>

<p>Fleur was sitting at the satinwood bureau, with her face buried on
her arms. Her hair, again in its more natural 'bob,' gleamed
lustrously under the light. She seemed unconscious of his entry. This
sight of private life affected Soames, unaccustomed to give or
receive undefended glimpses of self, and he stood, uncertain. Had he
the right to surprise her, with her ears muffled like that, and her
feelings all upset? He would have gone out and come in again, but he
was too concerned. And, moving to her side, he put his finger on her
shoulder, and said:</p>

<p>"Tired, my child?"</p>

<p>Her face came round--queer, creased, not like her face; and Soames
spoke the phrase of her childhood:</p>

<p>"See what I've brought you!"</p>

<p>He raised the Chardin; she gave it just a glance, and he felt
hurt. After all, it was worth some hundreds of pounds! Very pale, she
had crossed her arms on her chest, as if shutting herself up. He
recognised the symptom. A spiritual crisis! The sort of thing his
whole life had been passed in regarding as extravagant; like a case
of appendicitis that will not wait decently.</p>

<p>"Michael," he said, "tells me you want him to take you round the
world."</p>

<p>"Well, he can't; so that ends it."</p>

<p>"If she had said: 'Yes, and why can't he?' Soames would have
joined the opposition automatically. But her words roused his natural
perversity. Here she was, and here was her heart's desire--and she
wasn't getting it! He put the Chardin down, and took a walk over the
soft carpet.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, coming to a halt, "where do you feel it
exactly?"</p>

<p>Fleur laughed: "In my head, and my eyes, and my ears, and my
heart."</p>

<p>"What business," muttered Soames, "have they to look down their
confounded noses!" And he set off again across the room. All the
modern jackanapes whom from time to time he had been unable to avoid
in her house, seemed to have come sniggering round him with lifted
eyebrows, like a set of ghosts. The longing to put them in their
places--a shallow lot--possessed him at that moment to the exclusion
of a greater sanity.</p>

<p>"I--I don't see how <i>I</i> can take you," he said, and stopped
short.</p>

<p>What was that he was saying? Who had asked him to take her? Her
eyes, widely open, were fixed on him.</p>

<p>"But of course not, Dad!"</p>

<p>Of course not! He didn't know about that!</p>

<p>"I shall get used to being laughed at, in time." Soames
growled.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you should," he said. "I suppose people do go
round the world."</p>

<p>Fleur's pallor had gone, now.</p>

<p>"But not you, dear; why, it would bore you stiff! It's very sweet
of you, even to think of it; but of course I couldn't let you--at
your age!"</p>

<p>"At my age?" said Soames. "I'm not so very old."</p>

<p>"No, no, Dad; I'll just dree my weird."</p>

<p>Soames took another walk, without a sound. Dree her weird,
indeed!</p>

<p>"I won't have it," he ejaculated; "if people can't behave to you,
I--I'll show them!"</p>

<p>She had got up, and was breathing deeply, with her lips parted,
and her cheeks very flushed. So she had stood, before her first
party, holding out her frock for him to see.</p>

<p>"We'll go," he said, gruffly. "Don't make a fuss! That's
settled."</p>

<p>Her arms were round his neck; his nose felt wet. What nonsense! as
if--! . . .</p>

<p>He stood unbuttoning his braces that night in the most peculiar
state of mind. Going round the world--was he? Preposterous! It had
knocked that young fellow over anyway--he was to join them in August
wherever they were by that time! Good Lord! It might be China! The
thing was fantastic; and Fleur behaving like a kitten! The words of a
comic ditty, sung by a clergyman, in his boyhood, kept up a tattoo
within him:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I see Jerusalem and Madagascar,<br>
 And North and South Amerikee. . . ."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Yes! Indeed! His affairs were in apple-pie order, luckily! There
was nothing to do, in Timothy's or Winifred's Trusts--the only two he
had on his hands now; but how things would get on without him, he
couldn't tell! As to Annette! She wouldn't be sorry, he supposed.
There was no one else to care, except Winifred, a little. It was,
rather, an intangible presence that troubled his thoughts, about to
forsake it for months on end! Still, the cliffs of Dover would be
standing, he supposed, and the river still running past his lawn,
when he came back, if he ever came back! You picked up all sorts of
things out there--microbes, insects, snakes--never knew what you'd
run into! Pretty business, steering Fleur clear of all that. And the
sightseeing he would have to do! For <i>she</i> wouldn't miss
anything! Trust her! Going round among a lot of people with their
mouths open--he couldn't stand that; but he would have to! H'm! A
relief when that young fellow could join them. And yet--to have her
to himself; he hadn't, for a long time now. But she would pick up
with everybody, of course. He would have to make himself agreable to
Tom, Dick, and Harry. A look at Egypt, then to India, and across to
China and Japan, and back through that great sprawling America--God's
own country, didn't they call it! She had it all mapped out. Thank
goodness, no question of Russia! She hadn't even proposed that--it
was all to pieces now, they said! Communism! Who knew what would
happen at home before they got back? It seemed to Soames as if
England, too, must all go to pieces, if he left it. Well, he'd said
he would take her! And she had cried over it. Phew! He threw the
window up, and in the Jaeger dressing-gown kept there for stray
occasions, leaned into the mild air. No Westminster Square did he
seem to see out there, but his own river and its poplars, with the
full moon behind them, a bright witness--the quiet beauty he had
never put into words, the green tranquility he had felt for thirty
years, and only permitted to seep into the back of his being. He
would miss it--the scents, the sighs of the river under the wind, the
chuckle down at the weir, the stars. They had stars out there, of
course, but not English stars. And the grass--those great places had
no grass, he believed! The blossom, too, was late this year--no
blossom before they left! Well, the milk was spilled! And that
reminded him: The dairyman would be certain to let the cows go out of
milk--he was a 'natural,' that chap! He would have to warn Annette.
Women never seemed to understand that a cow didn't go on giving milk
for ever, without being attended to. If he only had a man to rely on
in the country, like old Gradman in Town! H'm! Old Gradman's eyes
would drop out when he heard this news! Bit of old England there; and
wouldn't be left long, now! It would be queer to come back and find
old Gradman gone. One--Two--Three--Eleven! That clock! It had kept
him awake before now; still--it was a fine old clock! That young
fellow was to go on sitting under it. And was there anything in the
notions that kept him sitting there, or were they just talk? Well, he
was right to stick to his guns, anyway. But five months away from his
young wife--great risk in that! 'Youth's a stuff'--Old Shakespeare
knew the world. Well! Risk, or no risk, there it was! After all,
Fleur had a good head; and young Michael had a good heart. Fleur had
a good heart, too; he wouldn't have it said that she hadn't! She
would feel leaving the baby when it came to the point. She didn't
realise, yet. And Soames felt within him the stir of a curious
conflict, between hope that, after all, she might give it up, and
apprehension lest she should. Funny--that! His habits, his comfort,
his possessions . . . and here he was, flinging them all over the
windmill! Absurd! And yet--!</p>

<h2><a name="C312">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<br>


<h2>ENVOI</h2>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Away from Fleur five months at least!</p>

<p>Soames' astounding conduct had indeed knocked Michael over. And
yet, after all, they had come to a crisis in their life together, the
more serious because concerned with workaday feelings. Perhaps out
there she would become afflicted, like himself, with an enlarged
prospect; lose her idea that the world consisted of some five
thousand people of advanced tastes, of whom she knew at the outside
five hundred. It was she who had pushed him into Parliament, and
until he was hoofed therefrom as a failure, their path was surely
conjoined along the crest of a large view. In the fortnight before
her departure he suffered and kept smiling; wryly thankful that she
was behaving 'like a kitten,' as her father called it. Her nerves had
been on edge ever since the autumn over that wretched case--what more
natural than this reaction? At least she felt for him sufficiently to
be prodigal of kisses--great consolation to Michael while it lasted.
Once or twice he caught her hanging with wet eyes over the eleventh
baronet; once found her with a wet face when he awoke in the morning.
These indications were a priceless assurance to him that she meant to
come back. For there were moments when possibilities balled into a
nightmare. Absurd! She was going with her father, that embodiment of
care and prudence! Who would have thought Old Forsyte could uproot
himself like this? He, too, was leaving a wife, though Michael saw no
signs of it. One didn't know much about Old Forsyte's feelings,
except that they centred round his daughter, and that he was
continually asking questions about labels and insects. He had bought
himself, too, a life-saving waistcoat and one for Fleur. Michael held
with him only one important conversation.</p>

<p>"I want you," Soames said, "to keep an eye on my wife, and see she
doesn't go getting into a mess with the cows. She'll have her mother
with her, but women are so funny. You'll find her first-rate with the
baby. How will you be off for money?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly all right, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, if you want some for any good purpose, go to old Gradman in
the City; you remember him, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm afraid he'll remember me."</p>

<p>"Never mind; he's a faithful old fellow." And Michael heard him
sigh. "I'd like you to look in at Green Street, too, now and then.
Your aunt-in-law may feel my being away a little. I'll let you have
news of Fleur from time to time--now they've got this wireless she'll
want to know about the baby. I'm taking plenty of quinine. Fleur says
she's a good sailor. There's nothing like champagne for that, I'm
told. And, by the way, you know best, but I shouldn't press your
notions too far in Parliament; they're easily bored there, I believe.
We'll meet you at Vancouver, at the end of August. She'll be tired of
travelling by then. She's looking forward to Egypt and Japan, but I
don't know. Seems to me it'll be all travelling."</p>

<p>"Have you plenty of ducks, sir? You'll want them at this time of
year in the Red Sea; and I should take a helmet."</p>

<p>"I've got one," said Soames; "they're heavy great things," and,
looking suddenly at Michael, he added:</p>

<p>"I shall look after her, and you'll look after yourself, I
hope."</p>

<p>Michael understood him.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And thank you very much. I think it's most frightfully
sporting of you."</p>

<p>"It's to be hoped it'll do her good; and that the little chap
won't miss her."</p>

<p>"Not if I can help it."</p>

<p>Soames, who was seated in front of 'The White Monkey,' seemed to
go into a trance. At last he stirred in his chair, and said:</p>

<p>"The war's left everything very unsettled. I suppose people
believe in something nowadays, but <i>I</i> don't know what it
is."</p>

<p>Michael felt a fearful interest.</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling me, sir, what you believe in yourself?"</p>

<p>"What was good enough for my fathers is good enough for me. They
expect too much now; there's no interest taken in being alive."</p>

<p>"Interest taken in being alive!" The words were singularly
comprehensive. Were they the answer to all modern doubt?</p>

<p>The last night, the last kiss came; and the glum journey to the
Docks in Soames' car. Michael alone went to see them off! The gloomy
dockside, and the grey river; the bustle with baggage, and the
crowded tender. An aching business! Even for her, he almost
believed--an aching business. And the long desultory minutes on the
ship; the initiation of Soames into its cramped, shining, strangely
odoured mysteries. The ghastly smile one had to keep on the lips, the
inane jokes one had to make. And then that moment, apart, when she
pressed her breast to his and gave him a clinging kiss.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Michael; it's not for very long."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, darling! Take care of yourself. You shall have all the
news I can send you, and don't worry about Kit."</p>

<p>His teeth were clinched, and her eyes--he saw--were wet! And,
then, once more:</p>

<p>"Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Back on the tender, with the strip of grey water opening,
spreading, between him and the ship's side, and that high line of
faces above the bulwark--Fleur's face under the small fawn hat, her
waving hand; and, away to the left, seen out of the tail of his eye,
Old Forsyte's face alone--withdrawn so that they might have their
parting to themselves--long, chinny, grey-moustached, very
motionless; absorbed and lonely, as might be that of some
long-distance bird arrived on an unknown shore, and looking back
towards the land of its departure. Smaller and smaller they grew,
merged in blur, vanished.</p>

<p>For the whole journey back to Westminster, Michael smoked
cigarette on cigarette, and read the same sentence over and over in
the same journal, and the sentence was:</p>

<p>'Robbery at Highgate, Cat Burglar gets clear away.'</p>

<p>He went straight into the House of Commons. And all the afternoon
sat listening and taking in a few words now and then, of a debate on
education. What chance--what earthly chance--had his skyscraping in
this place, where they still talked with calm disagreement, as if
England were the England of 1906, and where the verdict on him was:
'Amiable but very foolish young man!' National unity--national
movement! No jolly fear! The country wouldn't have it! One was
battering at a door which everybody said must be opened, but through
which nobody could pass. And a long strip of grey water kept
spreading between him and the talkers; the face under the fawn hat
confused itself with that of the Member for Wasbaston; the face of
Old Forsyte above the bulwark rail appeared suddenly between two
Labour Leaders; and the lines of faces faded to a blur on a grey
river where gulls were flighting.</p>

<p>Going out, he passed a face that had more reality--MacGown's!
Grim! It wasn't the word. No one had got any change out of that
affair. Multum ex parvo! Parvum ex multo! That was the modern
comedy!</p>

<p>Going home to have a look at Kit and send Fleur a wireless, he
passed four musicians playing four instruments with a sort of fury.
They had able bodies in shabby clothes. 'By Jove!' thought Michael,
'I know that chap's face!--surely he was in my Company, in France!'
He watched till the cheeks collapsed. Yes! A good man, too! But they
had all been good men. By George, they had been wonders! And here
they were! And he within an ace of abandoning them! Though everybody
had his nostrum, and one perhaps was as good as another, still one
could only follow what light one had! And if the Future was
unreadable, and Fate grinned, well--let it grin!</p>

<p>How empty the house felt! To-morrow Kit and the dog were to go
down to 'The Shelter' in the car, and it would be still emptier. From
room after room he tried to retrieve some sight or scent of Fleur.
Too painful! His dressing-room, his study were the only places
possible--in them he would abide.</p>

<p>He went to the nursery, and opened the door softly. Whiteness and
dimity; the dog on his fat silver side, the Magicoal fire burning;
the prints on the white walls so carefully selected for the moment
when the eleventh baronet should begin to take notice--prints
slightly comic, to avoid a moral; the high and shining fender-guard
that even Magicoal might not be taken too seriously; the light coming
in between bright chintz. A charming room! The nurse, in blue, was
standing with her back to the door, and did not see him. And, in his
little high chair, the eleventh baronet was at table; on his face,
beneath its dark chestnut curls, was a slight frown; and in his tiny
hand he held a silver spoon, with which over the bowl before him he
was making spasmodic passes.</p>

<p>Michael heard the nurse saying:</p>

<p>"Now that mother's gone, you must be a little man, Kit, and learn
to use your spoon."</p>

<p>Michael saw his offspring dip at the bowl and throw some of its
contents into the air.</p>

<p>"That's not the way at all."</p>

<p>The eleventh baronet repeated the performance, and looked for
applause, with a determined smile.</p>

<p>"Naughty!"</p>

<p>"A--a!" said the eleventh baronet, plopping the spoon. The
contents spurted wastefully.</p>

<p>"Oh! you spoiled boy!"</p>

<p>"'England, my England!'" thought Michael, 'as the poet said.'</p>
